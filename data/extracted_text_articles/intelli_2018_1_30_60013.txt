INTRODUCTION
Accurate measurement of blood pressure plays an
important
role
in
the
assessment
and
analysis
of
cardiovascular
risk
factors
in
clinical
patient
health
monitoring because high blood pressure is a major risk for
stroke or heart disease [1]. The accurate measurement of
blood pressure is important for precise cardiovascular risk
assessment, and for real time monitoring of the treatment
effect by the doctors and health practitioners [1]. It has been
repeatedly demonstrated in the studies carried out by various
researchers that the blood pressure assessment in clinical
practice is not precise, especially when the blood pressure is
measured manually using the manual sphygmomanometer
[2][3].
The
deviations
in
blood
pressure
measurement
techniques can lead to inaccuracy and misclassification of
cardiovascular risk by the doctors and health practitioners
[4]. For example, measuring the pressure manually with the
arm positioned below the level of heart atria can lead to a
blood pressure overestimation by 7-10/8-11 mm Hg [5]. In
addition,
leg
crossing
during
manual
blood
pressure
estimation also leads to the deviation in blood pressure by 8-
10/4-5 mm Hg [6]. With the passage of time, the inaccurate
manual blood pressure measurement systems have been
replaced by Automated Blood Pressure (ABP) measurement
systems which employs AI based BP measurement systems
and digital display for the blood pressure readings. The
digital blood pressure measurement systems suffer from the
limitation of terminal digit preference i.e., rounding errors
[7]. Thus, there is a need for accurate blood pressure
measurement techniques and algorithms for the design of
precise and accurate blood pressure measurement systems.
This review paper focuses on the study and comparison
of various AI based BP estimation techniques and algorithms
which have been developed by various researchers in the
recent years for automated measurement of blood pressure
precisely and accurately. Section II provides an introduction
to blood pressure and various methods commonly employed
for blood pressure measurement. Section III describes and
compares the various non-invasive methods commonly used
for the estimation and measurement of blood pressure.

for
the
blood
pressure
measurement based on the stage at which the blood pressure
estimation is carried out. Section V describes and goes into
finer details of the various commonly employed AI based

measurement.

BLOOD PRESSURE
In clinical terms, the arterial blood pressure is defined as
the measure of pressure exerted by the blood against the
walls of the brachial artery (the main artery in the upper arm
of humans). The blood pressure is necessary to pump and
circulate the oxygenated blood across the body in order to
supply oxygen to the living cells, which is vital for the
human survival. The blood is oxygenated through the lungs
and circulated across the body via human heart at each
cardiac cycle. The blood circulation system of the human
body is shown in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1.
Human blood Circulation Model.
The heart operates like a pair of synchronized pumps and
two pairs of valves (one between each auricle and ventricle
and one between each ventricle and the blood vessel
connected to it). The oxygenated blood is carried from lungs
to the body by the left part of the heart, while the
de-oxygenated blood is collected from the body and sent
back to the lungs through the right part of the human heart.
During the left ventricle contraction, the oxygenated blood is
pumped into the aorta, which carries it to the various parts of
body. During the left ventricle contraction, the blood
pressure in arteries is highest and is known as arterial
Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), while the lowest pressure is
established during ventricle relaxation period which is called
Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) [8]. The arterial blood
pressure as a function of time is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Arterial blood pressure as function of time.
The low blood pressure signifies that the force with which
the blood is pushed from the aorta into the distributing
arteries in human body will be quite low. In other words, it
signifies that the blood could not be supplied in sufficient
quantity throughout the human body if blood pressure is too
low. Conversely, if the human blood pressure is too high,
the blood vessels may be injured [8]. The blood pressure is
generally measured in millimeters of Mercury (mm Hg) and
the standard blood pressure of a healthy human is generally
specified as 120/80 mm Hg, where the larger number
(i.e., 120 mm Hg) signifies the Systolic
Blood Pressure
(SBP) and the smaller number (i.e., 80 mm Hg) indicates
the Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP).
There are two basic types of methods which have been
generally employed for the measurement of blood pressure:
[9]
(a)
Invasive blood pressure measurement,
(b)
Non-invasive blood pressure measurement
The invasive methods of blood pressure measurement
are in-vivo methods, i.e. the blood pressure measurements
are performed by inserting a pressure sensor inside the
human body. The term ‘in-vivo’ is a Latin word which
means ‘within the living’. Table I compares the two basic
types of blood pressure measurement techniques.

III. NON INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE ESTIMATION METHODS
There are three common methods commonly employed
for non-invasive blood pressure estimation:
(a) Palpatory method, (manual BP measurement)
(b) Auscultatory method, (manual BP measurement)
(c) Oscillometric method (automated BP measurement)
15

The above mentioned methods rely on sensing side
effects generated on occluding an artery by inflating/
deflating a cuff around a subject’s limb. It is to be noted that
the palpatory and ausculatory methods of BP measurement
are manual methods and involve the doctor or nurse to note
the readings manually from the mercury scale, whereas the
oscillometric method of BP measurement is an automated
method which senses, measures and displays the BP
magnitude on a digital display readout. It is also to be noted
that the palpatory method was earlier used for measurement
of SBP and was not considered suitable for measurement of
DBP and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). However, a new
palpatory technique for DBP pressure measurement has
been proposed and is discussed in the following sections.
On the other hand, the auscultatory method is suitable
for measurement of both SBP and DBP. It is because of this
reason that the auscultatory method is more commonly used
for BP measurement over the palpatory method. The
palpatory method is limited for BP measurement by doctors
in emergency situations [10]. However, the cuff based
non-invasive manual BP measurement method requires the
patient to position his arm above the level of heart atria and
the mercury scale reading to be carefully observed by a
nurse or observer for the accurate measurement of
blood
pressure.
The
basic
principles
of
various
non-invasive
BP
measurement methods - auscultatory method, palpatory
method and oscillometric method will be described below in
detail.
A.
Auscultatory method of BP Measurement
The most common blood pressure measurement method
used by doctors and nurses in hospitals and clinics is the
auscultatory
method,
which
employs
the
usage
of
sphygmomanometer and stethoscope for blood pressure
measurement [13]. A sphygmomanometer comprises of an
inﬂatable cuff and mercury manometer. The inﬂatable cuff is 
placed around the subject’s upper arm (around the brachial
artery) and the subject’s arm is placed above the level of
heart atria for accurate pressure measurement, as shown in
Figure 3 [14].
Figure 3.
Auscultatory method of non-invasive BP measurement set up.
The cuff is inﬂated to suprasystolic pressure so that the 
artery is completely occluded. The cuff pressure is then
slowly released and a trained nurse or doctor listens to the
Korotkoff sounds with the help of a stethoscope placed
between the arm and the cuff in order to identify the SBP and
the DBP magnitudes, as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4.
SBP and DBP measurements.
The cuff pressure at which the ﬁrst Korotkoff sound is 
heard is the SBP and the pressure at which the sounds
becomes mufﬂed is the DBP. It should be noted that the 
auscultatory BP measurement method requires a trained
health practitioner to note the accurate SBP and DBP
magnitudes manually [14].
B.
Palpatory method of BP measurement
In the palpatory method of BP measurement, the
inﬂatable cuff is placed around the subject’s upper arm 
(around the brachial artery) at the same height as the human
heart for accurate pressure measurement [14]. The cuff is
inﬂated to suprasystolic pressure. The cuff pressure is 
slowly released and a trained nurse or doctor senses the
blood flow by placing a finger on the radial artery at
patient’s wrist, as shown in Figure 5 [12].
Figure 5.
Palpatory method of non-invasive BP measurement set up.
The pressure at which the pulse disappears during
inﬂation, and then subsequently, reappears during deﬂation 
is known as SBP. In a recent technique proposed for the
measurement of DBP by palpatory method, the doctor
places his first three fingers over the elbow bend and tracks
the pulsating thrill over the elbow bend as he/she inflates
and deflates the pressure cuff. The pressure measured on the
manometer scale at which this pulsating thrill disappears is
known as DBP [15]. Although it is a new technique for DBP
16

measurement by using the palpation method, this method
for BP measurement can lead to errors up to 25 percent and
is commonly used by doctors and nurses during emergency
medical situations [10].
C.
Oscillometric method of BP measurement
The oscillometric method of BP measurement is one of
the
most
common
techniques
for
automated
BP
measurement and is suitable for the measurement of SBP,
DBP and MAP [16]-[18]. The oscillometric principle of BP
measurement is based on sensing the pressure pulses within a
cuff wrapped over the brachial artery around the patient’s
arm or over the radial artery at the patient’s wrist. The cuff
wound around the patient’s arm or wrist is inﬂated to a 
suprasystolic pressure. The cuff is then slowly deﬂated and 
the pressure oscillations are sensed by means of the pressure
sensor in the cuff. Figure 6 clearly illustrates the principle
used to sense the pressure pulsations by using the pressure
sensor inside the cuff.
Figure 6.
(a) Occluded brachial Artery with cuff pressure greater than
120mm Hg, (b) Blood flowing through relaxed brachial artery when cuff
pressure is between 80mm Hg and 120 mm Hg, (c) Silent blood flowing
when cuff pressure is below 80 mm Hg .
As the cuff is inﬂated to a suprasystolic pressure                    
(i.e., greater than SBP), the cuff pressure leads to the
occlusion of the artery and the blood flow within the artery
stops, as shown in Figure 6(a). The cuff is then deflated
slowly which leads to the flow of blood exerting pressure on
the walls within the artery. The cuff is then deﬂated 
gradually to a subdiastolic pressure where the artery is no
longer compressed and the blood starts flowing silently
through the artery. During the deﬂation period (i.e., when 
the pressure is reduced in the cuff), the cuff pressure is
recorded by means of the pressure sensor and the cuff
pressure waveform is extracted at output of cuff pressure
sensor. This extracted waveform is known as the cuff
deﬂation curve, as shown in Figure 7.  
The cuff deflation curve is comprised of two main
components: (as shown in Figure 7)
(a) the slow-varying component due to the applied cuff
pressure,
(b) pressure
pulsations
caused
by
arterial
pressure
(Oscillometric Waveform - OMW)
Figure 7.
Oscillometric waveform for BP measurement.
The pressure pulsations, also known as Oscillometric
Waveform
(OMW) pulses, are extracted from the cuff
deflation curve by extracting the slowly varying component
through
filtering
techniques
[19]-[21]
or
detrending
techniques [22][23]. The ﬁltering method is based on 
removing the cuff deflation frequency components using a
bandpass filter [48]-[50]. The lower cut-off frequency of the
ﬁlter is usually set to 0.1–0.5 Hz and the upper cut-off 
frequency of the ﬁlter is set around 20 Hz. In the detrending 
method, the trending curve is subtracted from the cuff
deflation curve in order to obtain oscillometric waveforms
OMW, as shown in Figure 7. The trending curve is basically
a line of best fit which represents the decreasing cuff
pressure [24]. It is to be noted that the BP information lies
in the amplitudes of OMW and thus, the BP can be
estimated from it. Most of the oscillometric algorithms
proposed by various researchers for detection of BP are
based on analyzing the Oscillometric Waveform Envelope
(OMWE) [25]-[29].
The OMWE can be extracted and analyzed in terms of
peak-to-peak [23] [31], baseline-to-peak [25], or the area of
the oscillometric pulses during the cuff deﬂation period 
[33]. The peak-to-peak oscillometric waveform envelope
(OMWEp-p) is obtained by subtracting the consecutive peaks
and
troughs of oscillometric
waveform (OMW). The
baseline-to-peak
oscillometric
waveform
envelope
(OMWEb-p) is obtained by subtracting the baseline from the
peaks of the OMW where the baseline is the cuff deﬂation 
curve without the pressure oscillations. The computation of
the area of the oscillometric pulses is based on the
integration of the oscillometric pulses [29].

CLASSIFICATION OF BP ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS
In the past few years, various BP estimation algorithms
have been developed by various researchers. The BP
estimation algorithms are usually applied on the signals
recorded at the various stages which can be OMW, OMWE
or ECG in BP measurement process. However, the BP
estimation algorithms are generally applied on OMWE.

researchers for blood pressure estimation from the OMWE.

is the artificial neural networks. The Neural Networks

Figure 10. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) based BP estimation using raw OMWE data.
The various NN algorithms that have been employed by
researchers in the recent years in the field of BP estimation
are listed and explained below.
A.
Feed
Forward
Artificial
Neural
Network
for
BP
estimation using raw OMWE data
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a set of
interconnected artificial neurons arranged in the form of
layers forming a system, capable of learning in training
mode, and providing the desired output according to the
applied input in testing stage. The FFNN can be trained
based on the nature and size of sample data and, once
trained, the ANN can be tested by presenting different data
sets for validating the results. The ANN can be trained and
tested to estimate the SBP and DBP by presenting the raw
OMWE data sampled at speciﬁc increments [38] [39]. 
Figure 10 shows the methodology to embed neural
networks in the oscillometric BP estimation process. There
are
certain
limitations
of
neural
network
based
BP
estimation technique, as mentioned below:
1. The performance of ANN is purely based on the nature
of the data presented to the ANN when trained. The
effective representation of data can lead to improved
learning and the generalization of the network to be
employed for estimation purposes. Since the neural
network has to be trained for the specific OMWE data, it
leads to a poor generalization network [40].
2. The redundant input data leads to a larger number of
hidden layers in the neural network for better accuracy
[41].
3.
As the number of weights in the neural network
increases, a large data set is required to train the neural
network [43]. However, the collection of a large data set
is time consuming and expensive.
Therefore, the raw sampled OMWE data leads to a
neural network having more hidden layers and more weights
and thus, it may lead to a large ANN network design.
Therefore, the size of the ANN can be reduced by reducing
the sample size of the OMWE or parameters that capture the
essential features of the signal. Hence, the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) approach was introduced,
which involves pre-processing of OMWE raw data before
applying it to the ANN for training, as discussed in the
following subsection.
B.
PCA
based
Feed
Forward
Neural
Network
(PCA-FFNN) for BP estimation using raw OMWE data
The various features can be extracted from the envelope
of oscillometric waveform, such as, the amplitude of the
OMW pulses or height of OMWE, its derivative, width, etc.
The
basic
principle
behind
the
Principal
Component
Analysis (PCA) based FFNN approach for BP estimation
was to reduce the dimensionality of the OMWE by
discarding low-variance components that mainly reﬂect the 
noise. The compression of data set presented to the FFNN
for training can be reduced by feature extraction. A subset
of the extracted feature data set is used to train the ANN in
PCA based approach, thus ensuring the requirement of small
sized ANN for BP estimation since the input data set gets
reduced because of the compression of input training data
set
[41]-[45].
The
PCA
based
ANN
approach
implementation has been shown in the form of block
diagram in Figure 11. The feature set of OMWE data is
normalized before applying it to the ANN so that the data
set should lie within the specified range, which reduces the
chances of getting stuck at local minima [47]. The PCA
based ANN approach derives a reduced feature set of
OMWE instead of using the features for training the ANN.
The optimal parameters of the Gaussian functions can be
obtained by minimizing the least squares error between the
model signal and the true signal by using the Levenberg–
Marquardt algorithm (LMA) [45].

INTELLI 2018 : The Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Applications

These optimal parameters have been considered as the
features for training two separate Feed Forward Artificial
Neural Networks using Resilient Backpropagation (RBP)
learning algorithm [46] for estimation of SBP and DBP. The
RBP algorithm introduced in year 1994 has been used to
train the ANN instead of steepest decent algorithm [41] or
steepest descent algorithm with momentum [39] introduced
in year 1995 because the RBP has diverse advantages of fast
learning rate, small learning data set, do not get stuck at
local minima and is robust to noise. In [47], the PCA based
ANN approach was implemented for BP measurement from
the radial artery and the system was trained and tested using
425 BP readings (5 readings from each of 85 persons) and
the range of BP data set ranged from 42-99 mm Hg for DBP
and 78-147 mm Hg for SBP.
The number of hidden layers in the FFNN were chosen
iteratively for minimum Standard Deviation Error (SDE)
and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by performing the
experiments for minimal errors in the output during the
training. It was observed that, by reducing the number of
inputs from 48 to 5 and hidden layer neurons from 4 to 2,
the first layer weight is reduced from 192 to 10. Figure 12
and Figure 13 compare the performance of PCA based SBP
and DBP FFNN when tested with raw data for the first time
and principal feature based data in terms of number of input
layers, number of output layers required, hidden neurons,
weight of first layer and weight of second layer [47].
Figure 12. PCA based SBP FFNN performance when tested with raw and
feature based data [47].
It can be concluded from Figure 12 and Figure 13 that
principle feature based testing of feed forward neural
networks[47]:

(c)

the network in SBP and DBP estimation, and
(d)
employs lower weight magnitudes in the second layer
in the network in SBP and DBP estimation,
C. Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System for BP estimation
The ANFIS approach consists of three stages, as shown
below in Figure 14. In the first stage, the oscillation
amplitudes (OAs) of the oscillometric waveforms (OMW)
has represented as a function of the cuff pressure. In the
second stage, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has
been utilized to reduce the size of the input training data set
by extracting the most effective features from the oscillation
amplitudes. In the final stage, the ANFIS has been employed
to perform the BP estimation.
The proposed method was tested on the data feature set
derived from the 85 patients in 1994 and the results of
ANFIS approach was compared with the conventional
maximum amplitude algorithm (MAA). It was found that the
ANFIS achieved lower values of standard deviation of error
(SDE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as compared to
MAA approach [48]. The ANFIS system employed the
advantages of both ANN and fuzzy logic (FL) for BP
estimation. It was observed by B. Kosko in 1994 that, under
proper conditions, ANFIS can be used as an universal
approximator [48].

Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the performance of the
ANFIS based SBP and DBP networks when tested with raw
data and principal feature based data in terms of number of
input layers and number of membership functions [47].
Figure 15. ANFIS based SBP network performance when tested with raw
and feature based data [5].
It is to be noted that two separate ANFIS networks were
designed for Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic
Blood Pressure (DBP) estimation. The number of hidden
layers was chosen by performing the random experiments
for minimal Standard Deviation Error (SDE) and Mean
Deviation Error (MAE).
Figure 16. ANFIS based DBP network performance when tested with raw
and feature based data [49].
It can be concluded from Figure 15 and Figure 16 that
ANFIS employs:
(a) less number of input layers in both SBP and DBP
estimation, and
(b) less number of fuzzy membership functions in both
SBP and DBP estimation.
D.
PCA based Cascade Forward Neural Network (CFNN)
for BP estimation
In 2010, the PCA based Cascade Forward Neural
Network (PCA-CFNN) for BP estimation was employed for
BP measurement which was similar to the PCA based Feed
Forward Neural Network discussed in sub-section B above
but the difference lies in the fact that there existed a weight
connection from input to each layer and from each layer to
the successive layer. The experimentation was performed on
85 subjects and five readings were taken for each subject
leading to 425 reading set and the principle parameter set
was prepared from the subject data in order to constrain the
input data train data set used to train the cascade forward
neural
network

It can be concluded from the above Figure 18 that the
PCA-FFNN using Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA)
has the least MAE and SDE followed by the PCA-CFNN
using Back Propagation algorithm with momentum. It can
also be observed that the using the PCA approach leads to
lower MAE and SDE.

CONCLUSION
In this review paper, the performance of various AI
based BP estimation techniques have been analyzed and
compared in terms of SDE and MAE. The effect of
employing the PCA with the ANNs has also been reviewed
in this paper. It has been concluded that the feature based
testing of PCA-FFNN employs:
a) less number of input layers in both SBP/DBP estimation,
b) less number of output layers in SBP estimation,
c) lower weights in the first layer in the network for
SBP/DBP estimation, and
d) lower weights in the second layer in the network for
SBP/DBP estimation in comparison to the raw testing of
the feed forward neural testing.
Therefore, it has been concluded that the complexity of the
system gets reduced when using the principle features. It has
also
been
analyzed
and
concluded
from
the
above
discussion that using the PCA approach with ANNs leads to
a reduction in MAE and SDE. Further, the PCA-FFNN
using Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA) has the least
MAE and SDE in comparison with the other AI based
algorithms.
