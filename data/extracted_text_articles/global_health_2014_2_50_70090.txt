Abstract — Medical equipment contribute to the quality of 
healthcare services on several levels. They play a key role in 
the diagnosis, the treatment, and the rehabilitation of the 
medical impairment and diseases. However, as any operating 
machine, medical equipment would have a definite lifespan 
that expires after a period of time. Theoretically, Taylor K. 
specified ten years as the lifespan of medical equipment. In 
fact, the status of the medical equipment defines its age. This 
status should be addressed according to a list of criteria that 
evaluate the efficiency and the performance of these 
equipment. The purpose of this study is to develop a well-
designed plan for evaluating medical equipment. According to 
this evaluation, we can rank the equipment that should be 
replaced in the descending order of urgency taking into 
account many criteria and sub-criteria. 
Keywords-efficiency; 
healthcare; 
lifespan;

equipment; performance.  
I. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Assessment of medical equipment is increasingly 
becoming the concern of healthcare institutions. Many 
companies concentrated their studies on the evaluation of 
medical technology and the investigation of their accidents. 
In the early 1990s, the world raised the attention to the 
device-related activities and many regional offices were 
opened all over Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific 
[1]. Moreover, the International Medical Device Regulators 
Forum (IMDRF) discussed the future directions in medical 
device regulatory harmonization [2]. Furthermore, the 
International Organization for Standards (ISO) defined ISO 
13485 as a standard for assessing and maintaining the 
efficacy of medical equipment. It deals with the 
specifications of medical technology to meet healthcare 
requirements for healthier outcomes [3]. In addition, the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generated a Device 
Evaluation Intern Program (DEIP) to monitor the efficiency, 
safety, and degree of risk to public health of the medical 
equipment [4]. 
A. Kirisits and W. K. Redekop highlighted the economic 
evaluation as a critical key point that stands behind the 
decision making for an equipment-upgrading program [5]. 
The clinical investigation of medical devices in Europe 
focuses on outlining the risks that may threaten both the 
patient and the staff [6]. However, among all the calls 
regarding the evaluation of medical equipment, a study done 
by Sharareh Taghipour in 2011 assigned six main criteria in 
which some of them are branched intao sub-criteria [7]. 
Sharareh focused on the recalls and hazard alerts that may 
occur for medical equipment. Moreover, concerning the 
risks, a great deal of attention is given to the failure 
frequency, the possible redetect of the risk, and the failure 
consequences, where we investigated the safety and 
environment effect of the device.  
On the other hand, Sharareh raised the attention to the 
operational and the non-operational consequences of a 
failure, to inspect the cost of repair. This inspection 
investigates the ‘manpower’ and the ‘spare parts’ costs to fix 
a defect. Besides, the Canadian study boosted the attention to 
the out of service periods and the number of patients waiting 
due to those failures, which is defined as the downtime of the 
device.  
Here, a new evaluation technique, similar to the 
Canadian one, which will be highlighted later in the paper, is 
proposed but with less required data. In our model, we tried 
to make the investigation simple and direct so we focused on 
the function and the age of the medical equipment, as well as 
we focused on the mission criticality, the risks, and the 
maintenance requirements. Actually, collecting data for each 
criterion is very hard and requires a long questionnaire, so 
we designed a checklist questionnaire to gather the required 
data about each equipment. As a case study, we applied this 
model on a Lebanese public hospital and we came back with 
a list of equipment that should be replaced after a period of 
time as defined by the hospital.  
In this paper, we are going to propose the methodology 
of the study in the “Proposed Methodology” paragraph. Then 
we are going to show the way to derive the weights and the 
intensities of the tested criteria in the “Parameters” Section. 
After that, we are going to present the missions to 
accomplish the assessment plan through the “Mission” 
section. In the “Evaluation and Discussion” section, we will 
be analyzing the obtained results and make a decision 
accordingly. This will be followed by “Case Study” to test

the validity of the presented technique. Finally, we will end 
up with a conclusion and our further expectations through 
the “Conclusion”. 
II. 
PROPOSED METHODOLGY 
Medical devices play a significant role in providing 
healthcare as they affect the patient and the care providers 
directly. Besides, the design of the medical equipment gives 
a share in the safety of the environment [8]. The excessive 
use of the medical equipment is directly proportional to its 
performance with time, which will shorten its expected 
lifespan. The clinical evaluation of medical technology 
should be based on a comprehensive analysis that covers 
relevant criteria and parameters to appraise the efficiency of 
the equipment.  
This paper proposes a model to evaluate the medical 
equipment according to measurable criteria and quantitative 
parameters that identify the time after which this equipment 
should be replaced. To start, we are going to identify some 
main criteria in which some of them are branched into sub-
criteria. To make our work measurable, we assigned each 
criterion and sub-criterion to a specific weight that defines its 
criticality. 
Many methods can be used to appraise and weight 
clinical data. In our study, we take into account five main 
criteria in which some of them are divided into sub-criteria. 
Each criterion has a certain weight that specifies its weight in 
the study. Moreover, each criterion is limited to a certain 
range of choices, where every choice is assigned to certain 
intensity. 
After defining the grades and intensities for all criteria, 
the model will be ready for use to assess the devices. To 
compute the final score, we need to calculate the total score 
that is the summation of the product of intensities and 
weights for each criterion. After that, we should calculate the 
Normalized Score Value that indicates the relative 
importance of each device in comparison with other devices, 
from which we generated the Transformed Score Value. The 
transformed score value is the value that allows us to rank 
the medical device according to its importance. 
III. 
PARAMETERS 
For a measurable reliable ranking for the medical 
devices, we should introduce some grades known as 
intensities and weights for each criterion and sub-criterion. 
The grades may encounter several classes for one criterion. 
For example, the maintenance requirements of a device may 
be high, medium, or low. The definition of each class differs 
from one hospital to another depending on the decision 
makers at each hospital. Consequently, the term ‘low’ for 
maintenance requirements differs from hospital to another. 
If the criterion of a device contributes with its maximum 
capacity to the upper-level of this criterion, then its intensity 
should record a value of 1. 
According to Sharareh, the intensities and the weights 
are obtained from a pairwise comparison matrix of 
qualitative grades, which is built using expert opinion [7]. 
The weight of each grade is obtained using Equation 1:  
𝑣𝑖 =

In our model, we discarded the sixth criterion, which I 
“Recalls and Hazards” from the study as it is not available in 
the hospital where the study was done. We distributed 0.16, 
the weight of recalls and hazards, on the other criteria by 
adding 0.032 on each of the five criteria. For example, the 
weight of the criterion “Function” is 0.45. After adding 0.032 
it becomes 0.482. 
IV. 
MISSIONS 
Assessment 
of 
medical 
equipment 
requires 
five 
consecutive missions where each one deals with a criterion. 
The core of each mission is gathering data. Before going 
through any of the missions, we made up an identity card for 
each equipment by filling up its name, its serial number, its 
43

brand, and its manufacturer. This information will not affect 
our study, but the aim is rather to identify each equipment to 
make sure that there is no overlapping in case the equipment    
is shared among the units and departments. 
The intensities are obtained from a pairwise comparison 
of grades; experts construct these grades  
First Mission: In the first mission, we classified the function 
of each medical equipment into five categories: lifesaving, 
therapeutic, 
diagnostic, 
analytic, 
and 
miscellaneous 
according to the classification developed by Fennigkoh, 
Smith, and Dhillion [9]. The weight of the function and the 
intensity of each category are shown in Table III.

Second Mission: This mission accomplishes the second 
criterion; mission criticality of weight (0.132) is divided into 
two sub-criteria: the utilization and the availability of 
alternative devices, as shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Hierarchy for mission criticality. 
The usage of the device and its back-up devices identify 
the load of work on that device. Moreover, using the 
equipment excessively will increase the failure on the 
equipment [10]. In the first sub-criterion, utilization of a 
device is the total hours the device is used on average in a 
hospital (the unit can be defined as hours per day or days per 
week or weeks per year). In our proposed model, we 
considered the ‘average hours a device is used per week’ for 
the utilization criterion divided into three classes as shown in 
Table IV.

EQUIPMENT.

On the other hand, the availability of alternatives affects 
the mission criticality as it represents the number of similar 
or backup devices for one equipment. However, as the 
number of similar devices at hand becomes fewer because of 
lack of backup of the medical equipment the risks on that 
equipment will increase. Furthermore, having several similar 
devices with low demand may also harm the device by 
affecting its performance from one side and by costing the 
hospital regular preventive maintenance from the other side. 
The weight and the intensities of the availability of 
alternatives are shown in Table V.

Third Mission: The third mission deals with the third 
criterion, which is the age of the equipment. The age of the 
medical device is based on the actual age of a device and its 
predictable life span. In general, 10 years is the average life 
span for a medical device. The equipment are divided into 
five categories according to the actual age of the equipment 
divided by the life span as shown in Table VI. As the ratio 
approaches 1, the equipment is considered as old otherwise, 
it is considered to be new as the ratio approaches zero. The 
age ratio is expressed in equation 5: 
𝐴𝑔𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =  
𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑔𝑒

Fourth Mission: The fourth mission addresses the fourth 
criterion, which is the risk of a device of weight (0.192). In a 
patient-centric environment, managing risk is the top priority 
that occupies a worthy space under the umbrella of the 
healthcare [11]. The risk of a device is the summation of all 
risks threatening patients. These risks can be estimated from 
the actual failures, which have occurred in that device, are 
shown in the figure below. Figure 2, shows the three sub-
criteria of risks. The consequences associated to the risks of 
a device are assigned by the failure frequency, the 
detectability, and the failure consequences should be 
extracted or estimated from data history and device 
maintenance archive [12].

The frequency of failure tells whether the failure is 
occurring frequently or not. For that, we considered four 
levels for the frequency of failure shown in Table VII. If the 
failure is frequent, it means that the failure is likely to occur 
(several occurrences in 1 year). If the failure is occasional, it 
means that it probably will occur (several occurrences in 1 to 
2 years). If it is uncommon, it means that it is possible to 
occur (one occurrence in 2 to 5 years). If it is remote, it 
means that it is unlikely to occur (one occurrence in 5 to 10 
years).

Failure detectability is the ability to detect a failure when 
it occurs. This is the most important criteria to assess harm 
[11]. We can detect the failure at many different levels. In 
our model, we used four levels of detectability. The failure 
maybe detected by error; that is when the equipment stops 
working, by inspection during the regular preventive 
maintenance rounds, it might be visible by naked eye or it 
can be detected by self-announcement, as summarized below 
in Table VIII:

The failure consequences of weight (0.46) deal with the 
safety and the environment where we discuss the effect of 
the failure on the patient and the staff [13]. The failure of the 
medical equipment may harm the patient at different levels. 
It may cause death in extreme cases, injury in which it may 
disable the patient, inappropriate therapy, misdiagnosis, 
which makes the situation worse or the failure, which may 
cause a delay in the treatment. Finally, in some other 
situations, it may cause nothing. The intensities of those 
failures are summarized in Table IX.

The risk value can then be estimated as a function of 
frequency, consequence, and detectability for each failure 
mode. As a result, the risk of the device is the total risk of all 
its failure modes. 
Fifth Mission: The last criterion, which is the fifth one 
where we studied the maintenance requirement for every 
medical equipment, is covered in the fifth mission. The 
availability of the medical equipment should be based on 
maintenance history and the maintenance requirements [14]. 
According to Fennigkoh and Smith [15], equipment that is 
predominantly mechanical, pneumatic, or fluidic often 
requires the most expensive maintenance. A device is 
considered to have an average maintenance requirement if it 
requires only performance verification and safety testing. 
Equipment that receives only visual inspection, a basic 
performance check, and safety testing is classified as having 
minimal maintenance requirements. We defined each of 
these classes as high, medium, and low with their 
corresponding intensities as shown in Table X.

REQUIREMENTS.

Identifying the main and the sub-criteria of each 
equipment allows us to determine their relative importance 
according to their goal or their upper level criterion using 
Saaty’s eigenvector technique-a mathematical technique that 
assigns a total score value for each medical device under 
study. This technique is used in multi-criteria decision-
making missions [16]. This total score is generated from the 
weights and the intensities of those medical devices from the 
matrix of criteria and sub-criteria observed [17], [18]. Figure 
3, show a schematic diagram of the main, and sub criteria of 
the evaluation test.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 
After filling the above questionnaire for each equipment, 
we can compute the scores using the assigned weights and 
intensities. The total score of each equipment is the 
summation of the weight × intensity for the five criteria 
(Equation 6).

Where “w” is the weight of each criterion “j” = 1, 2 … 5 and 
“i” is the intensity of each class.  
At this stage, we listed the total score for the equipment in 
descending order from the highest score to the lowest score. 
This rank helps us in calculating the normalized score value 
that indicates the relative criticality of a device compared to 
other devices. Therefore, the Normalized Score Value of 
each equipment (Equation 7): 
𝑁𝑆𝑉 = 
𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒔𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒆𝒂𝒄𝒉 𝒅𝒆𝒗𝒊𝒄𝒆
𝑴𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒔𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆    (Equation 7) 
The aim of this study is to prioritize the medical devices 
according to their criticality. To do so, we have to calculate 
the transformed score value from the above procedure, which 
can be used for prioritizing or ranking of devices. The 
Transformed Score Value depends on the Normalized Score 
Value of each device involved in the model and on the 
minimum and the maximum scores that could be achieved. 
The transformed score value plays an important role in 
assessing the medical equipment according to a percentage. 
In our proposed model, devices can have a total score 
between (0.1257592, 1.0) where score 1.0 is for a device, 
which gets the highest intensity when assessed against every 
single criterion and 0.1257592 is obtained when the device 
gets the lowest intensity from all criteria. The calculation is 
shown below using equation 6:  
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒
= (0.482 × 0.11)
+ 0.132[(0.7 × 0.15)
+ (0.3 × 0.2)] + (0.092 × 0.12)
+ 0.192[(0.3 × 0.15)
+ (0.24 × 0.13) + (0.46 × 0.09)
+ (0.102 × 0.17) = 0.1257592 
However, the total scores of devices can be used as 
absolute measurements for classification. The ranking of the 
medical devices can be done according to the normalized 
score value, however, for a better reading we can express the 
results in percentage, and so the normalized score value can 
then be mapped to (0, 100%) Transformed Score Value 
using the following equation:   
𝑇𝑆𝑉 = 
𝑺𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒗𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆 −𝑴𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎
𝑴𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 −𝑴𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 × 𝟏𝟎𝟎        (Equation 8)

The obtained list of medical equipment can be classified 
into many categories according to the prioritizing plan of the 
hospital, which is related to the budget assigned by the 
decision makers. In our study, the criticality of a device is 
classified into three categories in which a transformed score 
value should belong. The first category is for those, which 
should be replaced urgently. The second one for those, which 
should be replaced after a year and a half (their replacement 
can be limited to a deadline defined by the hospital according 
to their budget). The third one is for those, which are still 
functioning normally and can work for several years ahead. 
Using the transformed score value we can sort the medical 
equipment according to their urgency using Table XII. 
Table XII. THE CRITICALITY OF A DEVICE FROM THE TRANSFORMED SCORE 
VALUE.

Using the above study, we can easily rank the equipment 
of a hospital in the order of their urgent need for 
replacement. If the equipment’s score is between 65% and 
100%, it means that the equipment should be replaced 
immediately. If its score ranges between 50% and 65%, then 
the equipment should be replaced after a while. Finally, if its 
score is less than 50%, this means that the replacement of the 
equipment does not need to happen in the near future. Keep

in mind that we can consider other intervals to sort the tested 
devices according to the hospital’s financial contribution. 
VI. 
CASE STUDY 
In this section, we are going to apply the assessment 
model on the medical equipment found in some units of a 
Lebanese hospital in order to evaluate them for an updating 
program. 
To do this, we have chosen the Dialysis and the critical 
care units as a sample study. In these critical units, we have 
the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), which is dedicated to treat 
patients, who are seriously ill. Besides, we have the 
Coronary Care Unit (CCU), where patients with a 
pacemaker, intra-aortic balloon pump, or with cardiac 
telemetry are treated. Moreover, there is the Cardiac Surgical 
Unit (CSU), where patients having open-heart, lung, or 
vascular surgery are recovered. In addition, there is the 
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is the unit that 
monitors the neonates, who are facing newborn problems. 
Finally, the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is the 
intensive care specialized for the pediatrics.  
In these units, we dealt only with the medical equipment 
that is in direct contact with the patient and that might affect 
the patients’ safety. The equipment that are related to the 
ward medical equipment, housekeeping equipment, mortuary 
equipment, general furniture and accessories, are considered 
as not urgent at all so they are kept away from the study with 
“to be replaced after a determined period of time” as an 
general status. We gathered the required data for 324 
equipment distributed over 35 different items and we came 
back with the results listed in Table XIII. As you can notice, 
from the obtained results, the same item may record different 
grades when used in different units. For example, the ECG in 
the ICU records a grade of 57.35 whereas the ECG in the 
NICU recorded a grade of 42.88. These two different grades 
for the same item reflect the different mode of use and 
different urgency of that equipment at its unit.

At this stage, we are able to make our decision. 
According to the hospital’s budget, we can set three 
consecutive categories; each bounded within an interval of 
grades that matches the updating strategic plan of the 
hospital. In our case study, we assigned the three categories 
based on a strategic updating plan set by the hospital. The 
decision makers at that hospital were planning to spend a 
certain budget after the results of the study, and another 
amount after a year and a half and finally another amount 
after three years. Consequently, we set the coming three 
missions, as seen in Table XIV; the equipment with grades 
between 65% and 100% should be replaced directly. Those

with grades between 50% and 65% can be replaced after a 
year and a half, and finally, those with grades below than 
50% can be replaced after three years from the first updating 
plan.

 To make sure that the obtained results are correct and the 
devices to be changed meet the hospital’s requirements, we 
designed a questionnaire that questions the physicians the 
technicians, and the doctors. In the questionnaire, we asked 
for the equipment that should be replaced directly and we 
came back with a list that matched the above list obtained by 
the scientific study. 
One can do some modifications on the result, especially 
for the equipment on the boundaries. For example, the 
endoscopy monitor recorded 64.39% so it should belong to 
the second category. However, if the doctors and the 
physicians, 
who 
work 
on 
the 
endoscopy 
monitor, 
recommended an urgent replacement for this monitor, we 
can move it to the first category and add it to the equipment 
to be replaced directly. This will not be considered an error 
since the endoscopy monitor is on the boundary so it may 
belong to both categories. 
Finally, once the hospital has the results, it should launch 
the procurement process for the first category list.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
Medical equipment is a critical interface between the 
patient and the diagnosis, the treatment, or the rehabilitation 
process. It provides an opportunity for a better medical 
service. Consequently, medical devices are expected to 
operate in the required way providing the ultimate results of 
accuracy, safety, and reliability for an efficient and healthy 
contribution. As such, this study provides a new model for 
assessing the life of medical equipment based on its actual 
usage and not only speculated based on its suppositional life 
span. This method would result in a more accurate scheme 
that would most probably extend the life and usage of the 
equipment thus resulting in substantial savings to the 
healthcare institution from one side and would serve as an 
assessment tool based on a multi criteria decision-making 
approach from the other side. 
Using such a model of evaluation, we can drag the wheel 
of change in the assessment of medical equipment to 
overreach several sectors in the world of machinery. 
Moreover, adapting an automated management system to 
monitor the evaluation of the medical equipment will be 
revolutionary move towards safety and efficiency.
