Abstract‚Äî Vehicular communications aims to provide 
effective and sustainable connections between vehicles and 
between vehicles and infrastructure. One of the key challenges 
in 
vehicular 
communications, 
especially 
vehicular-to-
infrastructure (V2I), is to safeguard the best performance at the 
lowest resource cost. In this paper, we propose a quality-of-
service (QoS) ensured V2I approach which is supported by 
cooperative communications via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) 
relaying, to maximize throughput and minimize energy 
consumption among different transmission schemes. Based on 
the closed-form expressions of the outage probability, 
throughput, energy efficiency and packet loss rate for various 
transmission 
schemes 
concerned, 
we 
demonstrate 
the 
performance and optimization strategy of the proposed 
approach. We also show how the best performance trade-off 
between system reliability and efficiency under various 
environmental conditions can be achieved.

 INTRODUCTION  
Vehicular communications in the form of vehicle-to-
vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructures (V2I), and their 
combinations called V2X are becoming one of key 
technologies to support connected and autonomous vehicles. 
They are also essential for enabling diverse applications 
associated with traffic safety, operation efficiency and 
infotainment [1] [2] [3].  In a vehicular network, road users 
are able to access Internet services such as traffic condition 
broadcast, video streaming, digital map downloading, and 
information of road hazard and accident alarm, via fixed 
roadside units though V2X communications. The most recent 
research in this area has been focused on the vehicular ad-hoc 
network (VANET) [4] [5], including its connection to the 
Fourth-Generation or Long-Term Evolution (LTE and LTE-
Advance) cellular networks and the provision of the required 
solutions for achieving low latency and high reliability in 
vehicular communications [6]. 
IEEE 802.11p is considered one of the popular standards 
designed for vehicular communications, but it has showed 
obvious drawbacks such as low reliability, unbounded delay, 
hidden node problem and intermittent V2I connectivity [7].  
To tackle the problem encountered when improving 
quality of service (QoS), cooperative communications 
techniques can be applied to enhance transmission reliability 
by creating diversity [8]. In this case, mobile nodes (vehicles) 
can help each other through relaying other node‚Äôs data and 
sharing their limited resources to improve loss performance 
and 
increase 
transmission 
coverage. 
However, 
the 
performance enhancement by using relays nodes is 
constrained by the power (energy) budget imposed and high 
mobility in the vehicular network [9]. This issue can 
potentially impede the delivery of QoS in the V2I approach. 
In addition, routing in vehicular networks through 
cooperative relaying plays an important role in forwarding the 
required data to other vehicles with enhanced system 
performance [10]. 
In this work, we examine the performance of both 
cooperative and non-cooperative transmission schemes in the 
context 
of 
a 
vehicular 
network, 
including 
energy 
consumption, throughput and packet loss rate under different 
conditions, such as transmission distance, relaying method 
and channel condition (path loss exponent). We also identify 
optimal transmission schemes for the whole network in a 
changing environment. To the best of our knowledge, the 
proposed approach is unique since it provides an efficient way 
to find the best method for transmission between any V2I 
links with the help of V2V and based on the models we derive. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II discusses the relevance of this research with other 
work. The system models for both cooperative and non-
cooperative transmission schemes for V2I communications 
are presented in Section III. Simulation results produced by 
Matlab and NS-2 and discussions are presented in Section IV. 
Finally, the paper is concluded in Section V.

RELATED WORK  
Cooperative communications technologies for VANETs 
have been studied extensively, where two of the most 
common protocols of this technology are Amplify-and-
Forward 
(AF) 
and 
Decode-and-Forward 
(DF) 
[11]. 
Cooperative or polarization diversity is implemented by 
applying these protocols to exploit the broadcast nature of

wireless channels and use relays to improve link reliability 
and throughput [12]. In addition, the use of graph theory to 
formulate the problem of cooperative communications 
scheduling in vehicular networks is proposed in [13], in order 
to improve the throughput and spectral efficiency of the 
network.  
Enhancing system efficiency is a key issue in applying 
cooperative communications in V2I approaches, depending 
on the connectivity probabilities in V2I and V2V 
communication 
scenarios 
in 
one-way 
and 
two-way 
platooning based VANETs [14]. Smart Antenna technologies 
can also contribute to the increment of the service coverage 
and system throughput of V2I [15]. The capacity of V2I 
communications can be maximized by an iterative resource 
allocation method [16] and the efficiency of V2I 
communications can be improved by applying a scheme 
called Distributed Sorting Mechanism (DSM) [17]. To 
improve power efficiency in V2I communication networks, 
[18] proposed a joint power and sub-carrier assignment policy 
under delay-aware QoS requirements. In addition, the strong 
dependence on the environment due to multipath propagation 
is also presented for a distributed energy-efficient routing 
method [19].   
Furthermore, [20] proposed an adaptive rate adaptation 
algorithm integrated with a power control scheme. It 
minimizes energy consumption by appropriately adjusting 
vehicle's transmitting power, reducing network congestion 
and improving collision avoidance in vehicular networks. In 
[21] a sub-channel power control algorithm is proposed and 
the associated optimization problem is formulated to handle 
increased co-channel interference due to high mobility of 
vehicles in the network. 
Although there have been different methods reported for 
improving performances in vehicular networks, there is a lack 
of information regarding how to choose specific transmission 
schemes that can ensure the best QoS under different 
conditions in terms of the number of relaying branches and 
the number of relays for a given distance between source and 
destination nodes. 
In this paper, based on the initial work proposed in [1] our 
focus will be the identification of the conditions for 
establishing appropriate transmission strategies among 
different commonly used transmission schemes, including 
both cooperative and non-cooperative schemes for V2I 
communications. 
In 
cooperative 
communications 
nodes/vehicles not only transmit their own information, but 
also relay other nodes' information to a common destination. 
On the other hand, in non-cooperative communications nodes 
send their information directly to the destination, without 
relaying for one another. Our approach is to utilize the 
analytical models derived for these transmission schemes and 
to evaluate their performances in reliability, energy efficiency 
and throughput. Based on the trade-offs between cooperative 
and non-cooperative transmission schemes, we will show 
how to achieve the best performance through adaptive 
cooperative communications.

SYSTEM MODEL 
 
In this section, the analytical models of the required 
transmitting power, outage probability, energy consumption, 
throughput and packet loss rate in the context of a V2I network 
are established for both cooperative and non-cooperative 
transmission schemes. Based on these models, an adaptive 
transmission strategy can be developed to optimize the system 
performance. 
 Given a V2X network with L vehicles, for any vehicle-to-
infrastructure pair (V, I), where V œµ {1, . . . , L}, the goal of the 
optimization proposed in this work in connection to QoS is 
achieved by either minimizing the total energy consumed per 
bit (or energy efficiency) given an outage probability target, or 
maximizing the end-to-end throughput, (or minimizing the 
packet loss rate) based on the transmission distance between 
V2I pairs, i.e.: 
 
  ùëÄùëñùëõ ‚àë ùê∏ùëèùëñ 
               s.t.{poutVI} or 
           ùëÄùëéùë• ‚àë ùëÜùë°‚Ñéùëñ 
 s.t.{dVI}                    (1) 
where Ebi and  Sthi  are the energy consumed per bit and 
throughput, respectively, of the i-th path between a vehicle 
(V)  and infrastructure (I), poutVI  and dVI  are the fixed outage 
probability target and the total transmission distance between 
V and I. As V2V is part of the overall V2I, so the outage 
probability given in (1) is for the end-to-end V2I route which 
includes initial V2V links. 
Four transmission schemes in the context of V2I are 
identified in Figure 1, including single-hop direct V2I (1a), 
multi-hop V2I via V2V (1b), cooperative V2I with a single 
relay in each relaying branch (1c), and cooperative V2I with 
multiple relays in each relaying branch (1d). In this work, we 
intend to examine the performances of different transmission 
schemes in terms of energy efficiency, throughput and packet 
loss rate, and to optimize them under different environmental 
conditions. In these schemes, the transmission path that forms 
a V2V link is selected based on the distance measurement and 
channel conditions in terms of the path loss exponent of the 
V2V link. 
We consider a V2I network in which transmission links 
are subject to narrowband Rayleigh fading with additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and propagation path-loss. The 
channel fades for different links are assumed to be statistically 
mutually independent. For medium access, vehicle nodes are 
assumed to transmit over orthogonal channels through using 
the service channels specified in IEEE 801.11p [5], thus no 
mutual interference is considered in this system model. These 
channels can be reused by other vehicle away from a certain 
distance.   
A. Non-Cooperative Transmission Scheme  
Consider the transmission scheme for a direct link (V, I) as 
shown in Figure 1a where no relaying paths are involved. We 
use PSDir to denote the source transmission power for this case. 
For direct transmissions in the V-I link, the received symbol rVI 
and the spectral efficiency Rs (bits/sec/Hz) can be modeled as

where dVI is the distance and hVI is the channel coefficient of 
the V-I  link, Œ± is  the path loss exponent, s is the transmitted 
symbol with unit power, and nSD represents the AWGN noise 
vector, with variance No/2 where No is the thermal noise power 
spectral density (W/Hz).

where XœÉ  is a zero-mean Gaussian distributed random variable 
with standard deviation œÉ and with some time correlation. 
This variable is zero if no shadowing effect exists. The PL(do)  
is the path loss at a reference distance do in dB. The Signal-
to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the V-I link is expressed as [22]:

where ùëÅ= ùëÅ0 ùêµ is the noise power, and ùêµ is the system 
bandwidth in Hertz. 
An outage occurs when the SNR at the receiver falls below 
a threshold Œ≤ which allows error free decoding. This threshold 
is defined as Œ≤=22Rs-1, where Rs is the required system 
spectral efficiency. The outage probability of the single-hop 
transmission is given by [22] [23]:

Energy consumption is largely proportional to the 
requirement of maintaining a certain level of transmission 
reliability or the successful transmission rate. In order to 
maintain a required level of reliability, denoted by U, which is 
related to the reliability of a transmission link, the minimum 
outage probability is defined as:

The main objective for the performance optimization of a V2I 
network is to minimize the total energy consumption under 
different environmental conditions. Thus, the transmit power 
required to satisfy the reliability requirement or constrained by 
the outage probability for the direct transmission must be:

We set the transmit power to be proportional to the 
distance between two communicating nodes. For broadcast 
transmission, e.g., when the source transmits, the longest 
distance, i.e., the distance between the source and the 
destination dSD, is considered. Hence, the power between two 
communicating nodes is given by:

on the distance of the vehicle-infrastructure (VI), relay-relay

The first term on the right-hand side of (20) corresponds to 
the consumed energy when the relay is not able to correctly

relays consume receiving power. The second term counts for 
the event that the V-I link is not in outage, hence the relay‚Äôs 
transmitting and processing power, and the extra receiving 
power at the infrastructure are involved.

where PS is the transmitted power of the source and PC is the

coefficients of the vehicle-relay link and the relay-
infrastructure link, respectively, nVr and nVr are the AWGN 
noise vectors of the vehicle-relay link and the relay-
infrastructure link, respectively. SNRVr and SNRrI are the 
signal-to-noise ratios of the V-r link and r-V link, respectively. 
Two types of cooperative transmission schemes are 
considered here: 1) using multiple cooperative relaying 
branches with a single relay in each branch (MBSR) (Figure 
1c), and 2) multiple relaying branches with multiple relays in 
each branch (MBMR) (Figure 1d). The selective decode-and-
forward (SDF) relaying protocol is used in these two schemes 
and relays perform cooperation when the information from 
the source is correctly received by them. For the transmission 
scheme shown in Figure 1c, the outage probability is given by 
jointly considering the outages in V-I, V-R and R-I links, i.e.:

The transmit power at relays can be reduced and 
consequently the energy efficiency will be improved by 
implementing the cooperative communications schemes, 
which are particularly suitable for long-range transmissions. 
The related results will be shown in Section IV.  
IV. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 In this section, we examine the performances of different 
transmission schemes through Matlab and NS-2 simulations, 
in terms of energy efficiency (energy consumption per bit), 
throughput, packet loss rate, and optimum required number of 
branches and relays for different transmission distances in V2I 
links. We then reveal the conditions for selecting the optimal 
transmission schemes through comparisons between them. 
The network settings used for simulation are listed in 
TABLE I. Assume the spectral efficiency Rs in this scenario 
to be 2 bits/sec/Hz, and the required system reliability level to 
be 0.999. To generate mobility, related mobility-files are 
created in NS-2 simulation. In addition, we assume that all the 
vehicles are running at the same speed and keeping the same 
distance with each other.  
In Figure 2, the energy performances of both cooperative 
and non-cooperative schemes are illustrated and compared. 
As we can see, the non-cooperative direct transmission has 
the lowest energy cost than all others transmission schemes 
for short-range (dVI<33 m); the non-cooperative transmission 
using multi-hop relays outperforms the direct transmission for 
the range 33m<dVI<43 m and, in particular, transmission 
using two intermediate relays (n=2) nodes has the lowest 
energy consumption for this range.

The cooperative transmission outperforms the non-
cooperative 
transmission 
schemes 
for 
the 
range 
43m<dVI<58m, and the transmission using one branch with 
two relays (K=1, n=2) has the lowest energy consumption for 
this range. As distance continuously increases, the lowest 
energy consumption is achieved by transmission using two 
branches with one relay (K=2, n=1) for 58<dVI< 80m, and by 
transmission using two branches with two relays (K=2, n=2) 
for dVI>80m, respectively. 
 
As shown in Figure 3, the non-cooperative direct 
transmission has much higher energy consumption than the 
optimum transmission scheme which is chosen based on the 
transmission distance between vehicles and infrastructure. 
The results in Figure 4 show the energy performance for 
multi-branch and multi-relay scenarios for five different 
transmission distances in V2I links, i.e., 20m, 40m, 50m, 70m 
and 90m. Under each distance the energy performance is 
examined against the number of relays (n) for a different 
number of branches K=1, 2, ‚Ä¶ 5, employed by cooperative 
communications. From this examination, the optimal number 
of relays per branch can be found among different scenarios.  
When dVI=20m, the direct transmission scheme which 
does not need any diverse branches can be the most energy 
efficient transmission scheme as shown in Figure 4a. 
However, when increasing the distance a clear trend is shown 
that cooperative transmission schemes are becoming more 
energy efficient than the direct transmission scheme for a 
certain range of the number of relays used per branch. And 
this range is widening as the distance increases. As we can 
see, cooperative transmission can outperform direct 
transmission for n<2 when dVI=40m, for n<3 when dVI=50m, 
for n<4 when dVI=70m, and for n<5 when dVI=90m, as shown 
in Figures 4b-4e, respectively.

and conditions discussed above. For instance, the cooperative 
transmission scheme with one branch (K=1) is optimal for 
n=2, 3 and 4 when dVI=70m, while the cooperative 
transmission scheme with two branches (K=2) is optimal for 
n=2, 3 and 4 when dVI=90m. This indicates that an adaptive 
strategy can be applied to select the transmission scheme 
dynamically so that the best performance can be achieved and 
remained.   
The overall system throughput is shown in Figure 5 for 
three different vehicle velocities. The optimum transmission 
schemes through cooperative communications clearly 
outperform the direct transmission schemes in all cases due to 
the impact of diversity created by cooperative transmission. It 
is also noticed that the throughput of the optimum 
transmission scheme decreases when the number of 
transmitting vehicles increases. This is mainly due to 
congestion in medium access and increased operation 
overhead at the nodes that have dual responsibilities as the 
source as well as the relay. 
 Again, the overall system throughput is examined in 
Figure 6 but against the total transmission distance of a V2I 
link for both direct and optimum transmission schemes. The 
optimum transmission schemes clearly outperform the direct 
transmission schemes for all transmission distances. It is 
shown that the throughput of the direct transmission scheme 
decreases dramatically compared with the optimum 
transmission scheme when the distance of the V2I link 
involved exceeds 30 m.  
Figure 7 depicts the overall packet loss rate for direct 
transmission and optimum transmission schemes versus the 
number of transmitting vehicles for different vehicle 
velocities. As it is shown, the packet loss rate increases when 
the number of transmitted vehicles increases for all the 
transmission schemes, which is caused by network congestion 
and correlated with the corresponding performance in 
throughput as shown in Figure 5.  
The overall system packet loss rates for direct 
transmission and optimum transmission schemes for each 
transmission distance are illustrated in Figure 8. The optimum 
transmission scheme clearly performs better than the direct

transmission scheme for all transmission distances. These 
results are also correlated with those in Figure 6 for 
throughput performance, i.e., the dramatic reduction in 
throughput when the distance exceeds 30m is mainly caused 
by a sharp increase in the packet loss rate when the distance 
increases. It is worth mentioning that the optimum 
transmission schemes have much lower packet loss rates than 
the direct transmission schemes since when relays are used 
the transmission distances between adjacent nodes are 
reduced and, at the same time, the transmission reliability is 
improved due to the diversity generated through cooperative 
communications. 
Due to the network settings in our work where most 
vehicles have a fairly large distance between them and the 
roadside base station, no major difference in performance is 
observed when increasing the velocity of vehicles, as shown 
in Figures 5 and 7. In contrast, as discussed above, the 
performance such as throughput is correlated with the number 
of vehicles which are connected to the same base station. 
There are a number of factors affecting performances such 
as energy consumption, throughput and packet loss rate in 
V2X networks. Cooperative transmission utilizes additional 
paths and intermediate nodes to create diversity, which may 
cost more energy. However, this can be compensated by the 
diversity generated that can lower the probability of link 
failure 
and 
consequently 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
retransmissions. Diversity can also be enhanced with the 
increased number of relaying branches, but this increase could 
be marginal when the number of branches is large and these 
branches are not all uncorrelated in this case.  
 Regarding improving the QoS performance, a clear 
advantage 
of 
cooperative 
transmission 
over 
direct 
transmission has been demonstrated in our results. The packet 
loss rate of cooperative transmission becomes much lower 
than that of direct transmission when the number of vehicles 
increases as shown in Figure 7. As a result, the throughput 
performance of cooperative transmission can always 
outperform direct transmission for a wide range of the vehicle 
density, as shown in Figure 4. It is also noticed that the direct 
transmission schemes can also perform better than cooperative 
transmission under certain circumstances, as discussed above 
and shown in Figures 2 and 4. 
To achieve the best energy performance for a specified 
application, proper transmission schemes should be selected 
in an environment affected by varying environmental 
conditions, such as overall distance, dSD; and channel quality 
in terms of Œ±.  The findings of this work can assist deciding 
when and how the cooperative or non-cooperative 
transmission scheme should be employed. Based on our 
investigation, an energy-efficient or throughput-centric 
transmission strategy can be formed in a V2X network by 
adaptively choosing proper transmission schemes under 
different network and transmission conditions. This involves 
determining the number of relaying branches and the number 
of relays if the cooperative scheme is to be used. By doing so, 
energy saving could be significant even with the direct 
transmission scheme in certain conditions, as demonstrated 
by our results. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We have investigated different transmission schemes for 
their performances on energy efficiency, throughput and 
packet loss rate in a vehicular network. Based on the models 
derived for outage probability, energy efficiency, throughput 
and packet loss rate, we have shown that both cooperative and 
non-cooperative transmission schemes can exhibit the best 
performance under certain environmental conditions. In 
addition, we have shown the required optimum numbers of 
branches and relays in each branch in order to enhance the 
system performance. The optimal transmission scheme can be 
identified given the distance between the source and 
destination nodes in a V2X network. The results presented in 
this paper can be used to form an adaptive transmission 
strategy that is able to select appropriate transmission schemes 
in a changing environment to maintain the best QoS 
performance in a dynamic way, in terms of achieving the 
highest throughput with a fixed energy budget or the lowest 
energy cost for a given throughput target.
