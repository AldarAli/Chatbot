Abstract— The continuous growth of the use of technology and 
mobile applications means that more people have access to 
information published on the web, including geographic 
information. However, for visually impaired people interaction 
is difficult if maps are not accessible. For this reason, in this 
paper we analyze accessibility barriers of webpages with 
geographic content presented on mobile devices. With the 
purpose of showing an alternative to improve accessibility in 
these pages, this study proposes the use of a technique called 
crowdsourcing, i.e., a group of people that voluntarily access to 
webpages and provide information about physical accessibility 
and a general description in each map element (point, line or 
polygon). This description is written into the Scalable Vector 
Graphics Tiny (SVG Tiny) code. SVG Tiny is used to represent 
geographic maps with HTML. In this way, screen readers can 
interpret the descriptions to visually impaired people, thus 
making maps more accessible.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The geographic maps are very important in everyday life. 
They are present in several media such as television, 
magazines, Internet, and newspapers. The advancement of 
technology, the increasing number of mobile phone users, 
and the rapid growth of geographic information systems 
(GIS), has caused mobile devices to become an essential tool 
for accessing geo-services for social, professional or personal 
purposes. 
We are witnessing a new era of geographic tools online 
such as Google Maps, Google Earth, NASA World Wind, 
OpenStreetMap, MapQuest and Microsoft MapPoint. These 
tools have a large number of users. For example, in the five 
largest European economies, 50% of users access online 
maps from their personal computers, and 35% of users 
access from their mobile phones on a daily basis [1].   
However, not all people can access geographic 
information on the Web with their mobile devices. Due to 
the graphical nature of geographic information, some groups 
of users, such as visually impaired people may experience 
problems when accessing geographic information.  
This study presents an alternative solution to improve 
accessibility of geographic maps. It uses the crowdsourcing 
technique and the specification Scalable Vector Graphics 
Tiny (SVG Tiny) for the implementation of geographic 
accessible maps. 
The next sections are structured as follows. In Section 2, 
this work reviews the state of the art. In Section 3, it 
presents definitions of crowdsourcing, SVG Tiny, and web 
accessibility that guide the readers to understand the use of 
these concepts in the research. In Section 4, this study 
shows the accessibility barriers in geographic content. In 
Section 5, it shows a proposal to implement accessible 
geographic maps using crowdsourcing and SVG Tiny. 
Finally, in Section 6, it shows the conclusions of our 
research. 
II. STATE OF ART 
Finding a satisfactory alternative that allows visual 
impaired people to browse geographic information is a very 
active research field. There are several practical solutions for 
mobile devices developed by different authors: although 
some of them are already implemented, most of them are still 
prototypes. In the following paragraphs, these relevant works 
are described. 
A. Mobile GIS based on SVG 
Mobile GIS applications are becoming very popular from 
the last few years. However, the mobile devices used to 
execute these applications have serious constrains in three 
areas: screen size, memory and speed. Wu and Bin [2] 
present a mobile GIS application based on Mobile SVG 
(Scalable Vector Graphics) for hand held devices with 
limited resources. 
Their case of study is a mobile application for tourism. 
This application uses mobile SVG as data carrier, display 
and parser of maps. It introduces constraints on content, such 
as attribute types, properties, and user agent behavior, due to 
low memory, low power and limited display. Wu and Bin [2] 
describes the application data format, presents the map, and 
points out the areas for future development. 
These authors conclude that Mobile GIS can help people 
with disabilities to move around cities and other places, both 
outdoors and indoors. For example, blind people can use a 
mobile GIS to find the directions to arrive at a chosen place. 
Or a person with a motor impairment (e.g., a person in a 
wheelchair) can use a mobile GIS to find an accessible route 
in an airport or a railway station.

B. Generic 
Multi-touch 
Presentation 
of 
Accessible 
Graphics  
Goncu and Marriott [3] present the design and evaluation 
of a new tool for accessing graphics. Graphics Viewer using 
Vibration, 
Interactive 
Touch, 
Audio 
and 
Speech 
(GraVVITAS) provides a generic approach for presenting 2-
D content. It supports dynamic, interactive use of graphics 
and could be integrated with existing applications. 
GraVVITAS is a multi-modal presentation device. Its core 
is a touch sensitive tablet PC that tracks the position of the 
reader’s fingers, allowing natural navigation. Haptic 
feedback is provided by small vibrating motors of the kind 
used in mobile phones, attached to the fingers and controlled 
by the tablet PC. This allows the user to determine the 
position and geometric properties of graphic elements. The 
tool also provides audio feedback to help the user with 
navigation and to allow the user to query a graphic element 
in order to obtain non-geometric information about the 
element [3]. 
C. Touching OpenStreetMap data in Mobile for Low Vision 
Users 
Kaklanis et al. [4] present an application that enables 
access to OpenStreetMap data for blind and low vision users 
using mobile devices. During the exploration, the user moves 
his finger on the touchscreen of the mobile device and 
receives feedback vibration when finger is on a road or a 
point of interest. Sonification and a text-to-speech module 
provide audio feedback about distance to the next crossroad 
and information of the road or point of interest [4]. 
D. Crowdsourcing techniques for augmenting traditional 
accessibility maps  
Rice et al. [5] present a contemporary approach to collect 
and capture geospatial data using crowdsourcing. It reports, 
locates, and defines transitory obstacles in a built 
environment. These obstacles represent a significant hazard 
for visually impaired people when navigating through known 
and unknown spaces. Efforts like this that allow to quickly 
report, geolocate, and define transitory obstacles would 
present a major advance in cartographic support for visually 
impaired people. The contemporary techniques described in 
this paper include: gazetteer-based geoparsing, active 
harvesting of navigational points of interest, and ambient 
geographic information (AGI) present in social media. These 
techniques contribute to the characterization of transitory 
obstacles and facilitate their display in a crowdsourced 
accessibility system [5]. 
 
The papers presented in this section focus on hardware 
devices and touch and haptic vibration responses. Although 
it is true that these studies help to improve accessibility of 
geographic information, many people cannot access these 
devices.  
Our study is a proposal to develop a technique at the 
software level (code) to describe details of the geographical 
maps that can be interpreted by screen readers. 
 
 
III. DEFINITIONS 
The following definitions are used in this work: 
A.  Crodwsourcing  
Crowdsourcing is a phenomena of 21st century in GIS to 
generate 
online 
information 
from 
individual 
action 
voluntarily, i.e., a group of people that voluntarily access 
different webpages and save various kinds of information 
such as points of interest, addresses, ideas or content. 
Crowdsourcing implies collecting large amounts of 
information and add it on the web through an interface. With 
this technique, geographic maps with a lot of descriptions of 
the places within can be obtained. 
The mapping through crowdsourcing is usually done by 
means of a process called Volunteered Geographic 
Information (VGI) [6]. For this, there are several kinds of 
software and/or websites that gather information through an 
algorithm developed specifically for maps. OurMap [7] and 
WikiCrimes [8] are examples of proposals for data collection 
using volunteer users to report problems related to cities, 
crimes and transportation. The information can be loaded 
manually and/or automatically. For example, OpenStreetMap 
add new data manually. 
Digital Globe Company sponsors the Tomnod mission 
that utilizes crowdsourcing to identify objects and places in 
satellite images. They created a web application where 
thousands of volunteers use satellite images to explore the 
Earth, solve real-world problems, and view images of the 
planet. When the Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane 
disappeared in the ocean, the Tomnod mission developed an 
application to gather recently collected imagery for any sign 
of Flight 370 that may have been recorded by a data 
collection sensor to help identify features, i.e., debris, raft, oil 
slick, and tag objects that could be useful to find the plane 
[9].  
Mobile GIS Solutions for Crowdsourced Data and Real-
time Database Editing is a mobile alert solution. It helps 
government agencies, utilities and transportation authorities 
by providing them with a reliable, cost-effective source of 
actionable information by allowing citizens in their 
communities to report incidents such as graffiti, illegal trash 
dumping, potholes, water leaks, broken street lights or signs 
[10]. 
B. Scalable Vector Graphic Tiny 
Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) has become popular for 
the development of webpages that contain images. SVG is an 
open standard defined by the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) for the representation of vector maps on the web. 
SVG contains SVG Tiny, which is a profile specially 
adapted for mobile devices. Although it has many 
applications, SVG Tiny can be of great help for the design of 
vector maps presented in navigation systems and geographic 
information systems (GIS) for mobile devices. Some of the 
advantages of this format are: 
 
It is an open standard. 
 
It is very light because it is based on XML.

 
It attaches metadata such as street names, geospatial 
information, geographic coordinates, RDF, and so 
on. 
 
It is scalable, so that it can zoom without 
deteriorating the quality of map. 
 
It is easily editable, since it based on XML. 
 
It can attach animations. This is useful for GPS 
navigation applications [11]. 
C.  Web Accessibility 
Web accessibility means that people with disabilities 
should be able to make full use of the web. Web 
accessibility is not interested in the specific conditions of 
people but on the impact these conditions have on their 
ability to use the web regardless of the technology used, 
such as personal computer, tablet, and mobile phone [12]. 
According to a report published by the United Nations in 
2011 [13], more than 1000 million people suffer some form 
of disability. In this work, we focus on visually impaired. 
According to estimates by the World Health Organization 
(WHO), about 285 million people suffer from some form of 
visual impairment and 39 million people are blind, 
representing 0.7% of the world population [14]. 
IV. ACCESSIBILITY BARRIERS IN GEOGRAPHIC 
CONTENT 
In this section we describe several accessibility barriers 
that mobile users face when accessing webpages with 
geographic content:  
 
Low contrast in content.  
 
Pages saturated of complex information and 
sometimes unintuitive.  
 
Contents not intended for use in mobile.  
 
Movement 
in 
the 
maps: 
distraction 
and 
concentration problems.  
 
Text represented as image: it means that the text 
that has an image is in image format. 
 
Problems with color: color blind people cannot 
distinguish certain shades of color.  
 
Mosaic maps: map consists of different images 
placed in an order so that they form a single image.  
 
Geographical maps without text. 
 
To achieve web accessibility, we need to be aware of the 
fact that not all users access the web with the same devices 
and also not all users are capable of correctly perceiving 
some kinds of content published on the web. This general 
idea can be summarized in two basic design principles for 
web accessibility:  
1. Create pages that offer content in different 
alternative formats.  
2. Offer content in an understandable presentation to 
facilitate navigation through the website. 
 
This study focuses on the second principle and proposes 
a mechanism to describe elements on geographic maps. 
V. PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT ACCESSIBLE  
GEOGRAPHIC MAPS USING CROWDSOURCING AND 
SVG TINY CODE 
At present, there are tools that help visually impaired 
people to manipulate mobile devices, such as screen readers, 
screen magnifiers and braille keyboards. These are assistive 
technologies that certainly help solve accessibility problems 
to access textual information, but do not help with 
geographic information such as maps, i.e., screen readers 
cannot read the maps in detail due to its complex design 
unless the code contains the appropriate tags. 
Also, the crowdsourcing technique can help to input 
information about physical accessibility characteristics. For 
example: existence of ramps, elevators with braille signs, 
escalators, parking for disabled people, etc. 
With SVG Tiny code, webpages with geographic 
information can be implemented and accessed regardless of 
the user's capabilities. SVG Tiny code includes elements 
which provide supplementary descriptive information about 
parent elements. Some specific examples are the <title> and 
<desc> elements, which can be a child of any graphic or 
container element in SVG Tiny code, and which contain 
textual descriptions of the parent element. The <title> tag is 
meant for a short text description of an element. If the text 
description is complex, the <desc> tag should be used 
because it is intended to provide arbitrarily long descriptions 
(nothing in the SVG Tiny code specification limits the length 
of these elements). These tags can be read via screen readers. 
The <desc> and <title> elements are not rendered as part of 
the SVG Tiny graphics. However, the <title> element can be 
displayed as a tooltip when the pointing device moves over 
particular elements. The container element <g> can be used 
to organize the content of the map at different levels (layers) 
that can be offered to the user on demand.  
The SVG Tiny code can be interpreted by the screen 
reader for visually impaired users that need to access 
geographic maps. 
The crowdsourcing technique can be used for adding 
information, i.e., the proposed application can allow 
volunteers anywhere in the world to access online the map 
and add physical accessibility information and general 
description for each of the elements of the map. This 
information is stored in the SVG Tiny code.  
For example, the geographic map shown in Figure 1 is a 
schematic representation of a university campus with 
buildings, parking lots, streets and green spaces. The 
buildings are represented by lowercase letters; the parking 
spaces with uppercase letters and the green areas with 
numbers. The goal is to use the crowdsourcing technique to 
add 
physical 
accessibility 
information 
and 
general 
description to the map. Focusing on the Parking A, when the 
user positions the cursor on the map, it shows a pop-up 
window to enter the title and description associated to a 
specific element.

          Figure 1. Map without physical accessibility information. 
 
Figure 2 shows an extract of the SVG Tiny code of the 
geographic map corresponding to Parking A. In this code, 
there are not elements as description or title. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. SVG Tiny code without physical accessibility information 
 
Once volunteer users add a title and a description, as 
shown in Figure 3, it is automatically entered in the SVG 
Tiny code of the geographic map. 
 
 
Figure 3. Map with physical accessibility information 
 
In Figure 4, from the code perspective, the tags <title> 
and <desc> have the following information: "University 
Campus" and “Parking of Electronic Engineering”. Within 
this element, another container that describes the <g id = 
"Handicapped Parking"> containing <title> "Handicapped 
Parking ", and description <desc> "Parking of Electronic 
Engineering. Number of handicapped parking 5".

Thus, the title and description tags of the SVG Tiny code 
can be used to provide physical accessibility information 
associated to the map: a screen reader can retrieve the 
information of the map and provide it to a visually impaired

user. If all the descriptions of the whole map are entered with 
the crowdsourcing technique using SVG Tiny code, then this 
would help visually impaired people know physical 
accessibility characteristics of places in online geographic 
maps. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This study linked concepts to improve accessibility 
including languages and tools such as crowdsourcing, SVG 
Tiny code, and use of screen readers. This helped to propose 
a solution to overcome a barrier of accessibility providing a 
textual equivalent to visual content. 
New applications in the geographic scope, such as 
OpenStreetMap and Google Maps make clear the need to use 
online geographic information opposite to the traditional use 
of printed maps. However, it is necessary to develop 
methods to provide more accessible information to the user 
in several levels such as form, scale and detail, especially for 
the user of mobile devices. 
Most of the studies concerning web accessibility have 
little or no interest in the application of web accessibility 
guidelines in the development of geographic solutions, since 
geographic maps are not generally available and are strictly 
visual. This shows a clear weakness in the development of 
geographic maps. 
Increased social interaction through the web creates 
behaviours among people, along with this, the need for 
mechanisms to obtain web users collaboration on a voluntary 
basis to solve real problems, such as transportation, 
pollution, safety, and accessibility. This is what the 
crowdsourcing technique is about. 
This paper presented some elements of SVG Tiny code, 
such as <g>, <desc> and <title> tags, for describing 
geographic map elements, i.e., polygons, lines and points, 
that makes possible to interpret the code by a screen reader,  
so the visually impaired users can manipulate geographic 
maps. 
Although SVG Tiny code was created to represent the 
images with dynamic content on mobile devices, the SVG 
Tiny characteristics also offer the possibility to include code 
that makes geographical maps accessible. 
Most of the efforts to improve accessibility of geographic 
maps are focused on hardware solutions, such as those 
presented in the state of the art section of this paper. We 
believe that integrating hardware with software may provide 
better results in terms of improving accessibility of 
geographic maps. 
In the future, we intend to combine the format SVG Tiny 
code, indoor navigation systems, augmented reality, 
crowdsourcing, and web accessibility guidelines for 
proposing new ways to access and display the geographical 
maps available on the web.
