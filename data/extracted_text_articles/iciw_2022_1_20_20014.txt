Abstract—We consider a two-player zero-sum game with ran-
dom linear chance constraints whose distributions are known to
belong to moments based uncertainty sets. We show that a Saddle
Point Equilibrium problem is equivalent to a primal-dual pair of
Second-Order Cone Programs. The game with chance constraints
can be used in various applications, e.g., risk constraints in
portfolio optimization, resource constraints in stochastic shortest
path problem, renewable energy aggregators in the local market.
Keywords—Distributionally robust chance constraints, Zero-sum
game, Saddle point equilibrium, Second-order cone program.
I. INTRODUCTION
A two-player zero-sum game is defined using a single payoff
function, where one player plays the role of maximizer and
another player plays the role of minimizer. More commonly,
a zero-sum game is introduced with a payoff matrix, where
the rows and the columns are the actions of player 1 and
player 2, respectively. A Saddle Point Equilibrium (SPE) is
the solution concept to study the zero-sum games and it exists
in the mixed strategies [1]. Dantzig and later Adler showed
the equivalence between linear programming problems and
two-player zero-sum games [2] [3]. Charnes [4] generalized
the zero-sum game considered in [1] by introducing linear
inequality constraints on the mixed strategies of both the
players and called it a constrained zero-sum game. An SPE
of a constrained zero-sum game can be obtained from the
optimal solutions of a primal-dual pair of linear programs
[4]. Singh and Lisser [5] considered a stochastic version of
constrained zero-sum game considered by Charnes [4], where
the mixed strategies of each player are restricted by random
linear inequality constraints, which are modelled using chance
constraints. When the random constraint vectors follow a
multivariate elliptically symmetric distribution, the zero-sum
game problem is equivalent to a primal-dual pair of Second-
Order Cone Programs (SOCPs) [5].
Nash equilibrium is the generalization of SPE and it is used
as a solution concept for the general-sum games [6] [7]. Under
certain conditions on payoff functions and strategy sets, there
always exists a Nash equilibrium [8]. The general-sum games
under uncertainties are considered in the literature [9]–[13],
which capture both risk neutral and risk averse situations.
In this paper, we consider a more general two player zero-
sum game as compared to [5]. Unlike in [5], the strategy set
of each player is defined by a compact polyhedral set, which
is further restricted by some random linear inequalities and
the information on the distribution of the random constraint
vectors is not exactly known. We consider two different uncer-
tainty sets based on the partial information on the mean vectors
and covariance matrices of the random constraint vectors. We
show that, there exists an SPE of the game Zα and an SPE
problem is equivalent to a primal-dual pair of SOCPs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The definition
of a distributionally robust zero-sum game is given in Section
II. Section III presents the reformulation of distributionally
robust chance constraints as second order cone constraints
under two different uncertainty sets. Section IV outlines a
primal-dual pair of SOCPs whose optimal solutions constitute
an SPE of the game.
II. THE MODEL
We consider a two player zero-sum game, where each player
has continuous strategy set. Let C1 ∈ RK1×m, C2 ∈ RK2×n,
d1 ∈ RK1 and d2 ∈ RK2. We consider X = {x ∈ Rm |
C1x = d1, x ≥ 0} and Y = {y ∈ Rn | C2y = d2, y ≥ 0}
as the strategy sets of player 1 and player 2, respectively.
We assume that X and Y are compact sets. Let u : X ×
Y → R be a payoff function associated to the zero-sum game
and we assume that player 1 (resp. player 2) is interested in
maximizing (resp. minimizing) u(x, y) for a fixed strategy y
(resp. x) of player 2 (resp. player 1). For a given strategy pair
(x, y) ∈ X × Y , the payoff function u(x, y) is given by
u(x, y) = xT Gy + gT x + hT y,
(1)
where G ∈ Rm×n, g ∈ Rm and h ∈ Rn. The first term of (1)
results from the interaction between both the players whereas
the second and third term represents the individual impact of

player 1 and player 2 on the game, respectively. The strategy
sets are often restricted by random linear constraints, which
are modelled using chance constraints. The chance constraint
based strategy sets appear in many practical problems, e.g.,
risk constraints in portfolio optimization [14]. In this paper,
we consider the case, where the strategies of player 1 satisfy
the following random linear constraints,
(a1
k)T x ≤ b1
k, k = 1, 2, . . . , p,
(2)
whilst the strategies of player 2 satisfy the following random
linear constraints
(a2
l )T y ≥ b2
l , l = 1, 2, . . . , q.
(3)
Let I1 = {1, 2, . . . , p} and I2 = {1, 2, . . . , q} be the index
sets for the constraints of player 1 and player 2, respectively.
For each k ∈ I1 and l ∈ I2, the vectors a1
k and a2
l are
random vectors defined on a probability space (Ω, F, P). We
consider the case, where the only information we have about
the distributions of a1
k and a2
l is that they belong to some
uncertainty sets D1
k and D2
l , respectively. The uncertainty sets
D1
k and D2
l , are constructed based on the partially available
information on the distributions of a1
k and a2
l , respectively.
Using the worst case approach, the random linear constraints
(2) and (3) can be formulated as distributionally robust chance
constraints given by

The conditions given in Assumption III.3 are Slater’s con-
dition, which are sufficient for strong duality in a convex
optimization problem. We use these conditions in order to
derive equivalent SOCPs for the zero-sum game Zα.
IV. EXISTENCE AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SADDLE
POINT EQUILIBRIUM
In this section, we show that there exists an SPE of the
game Zα if the distributions of the random constraint vectors
of both the players belong to the uncertainty sets defined in
Section III-A. We further propose a primal-dual pair of SOCPs
whose optimal solutions constitute an SPE of the game Zα.
Theorem IV.1. Consider the game Zα, where the distributions
of the random constraint vectors ai
k, k ∈ Ii, i = 1, 2, belong
to the uncertainty sets described in Section III-A. Then, there
exists an SPE of the game for all α ∈ (0, 1)p × (0, 1)q.
Proof. Let α ∈ (0, 1)p×(0, 1)q. For uncertainty sets described
in Section III-A, it follows from Lemma III.1 and Lemma
III.2 that the strategy sets S1
α1 and S2
α2 are given by (17)
and (18), respectively. It is easy to see that S1
α1 and S2
α2 are
convex and compact sets. The function u(x, y) is a bilinear
and continuous function. Hence, there exists an SPE from the
minimax theorem [1].
A. Equivalent Primal-Dual Pair of Second-Order Cone Pro-
grams
From the minimax theorem [1], (x∗, y∗) is an SPE for the
game Zα if and only if
x∗ ∈ arg max
x∈S1

y∗ ∈ arg min

We start with problem miny∈S2
α2 maxx∈S1
α1 u(x, y). The inner
optimization problem maxx∈S1
α1 u(x, y) can be equivalently
written as
