Abstract—In order to enhance the overall performance of the
visible light communications system and to achieve the efﬁcient
use of spectrum resources, by leveraging the characteristic of
channel frequency selection, we propose a novel visible light
communications system based on Carrier Interferometry Orthog-
onal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CI-OFDM) transmission
scheme. Through the frequency domain diversity, the system
performance can be efﬁciently improved. At the same time,
with a meticulous designed CI codes, the system Peak-Average
Power Ratio (PAPR) can be effectively reduced. Analysis and
simulation results demonstrate that, under the same Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR) condition, the proposed CI-OFDM scheme
performs signiﬁcantly better in BER than the traditional OFDM
system, and greatly reduces the PAPR of the transmitted signal.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless communication has become not only a pillar of
the world high-tech industry, but also an essential part for
global development of informationization. However, it still
faces the problem of system capacity expansion under the
existent technology, which contradicts with the explosive
growth of the growing business demand [1]. Visible light
communications will provide an effective way to address the
above problem. The high-speed ﬂashes of light and dark
signals issued by the light-emitting diode, which transmit
information, cannot be perceived by the naked eye but can be
captured by the photoelectric detector device. Therefore, the
data transmission can be supplied simultaneously with regular
illumination. Furthermore, the visible light communication
is immune from complicated electromagnetic interference to
provide a very rich spectrum of resources (extra wide spectral
band of approximately 375THz, 1THz = 1000GHz) for high-
capacity communications services [2].
However, in the visible light communication system, in or-
der to achieve better communication and illumination effects,
and to prevent the ”shadow” being produced, it is common to
arrange multiple Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights. Thus,
the light pulses of signal can be overlapped in time and
received by detectors through different transmission paths,
resulting in the occurrence of Inter Symbol Interference (ISI),
which requires an in-depth study of signal processing methods
to overcome it. Multi-carrier Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) technology modulates the high-speed
serial data in parallel onto multiple orthogonal subcarriers
to reduce the code rate and the impact of ISI. At the same
time, a protection interval is inserted between each OFDM
symbol to further eliminate the residual ISI [3]. However, the
visible light OFDM system has its own inherent shortcomings.
For example, without frequency diversity, the bit error rate is
severely affected by the zero channel spectrum, and the Peak
to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is so large that the ampliﬁer
nonlinear problem is launched [4][5].
To further enhance the overall performance of visible light
communication system, this paper introduces the Carrier In-
terferometry OFDM (CI-OFDM) modulation technology into
the visible light communication systems. Different from the
visible light OFDM scheme, in the CI-OFDM transmission,
the data after the constellation mapping and the serial to
parallel conversion is not just for their respective sub-carrier
modulation, but is simultaneously transmitted on all sub-
carriers. In order to enable the receiver to separate the different
simultaneous transmitted data, all the data are multiplied by
mutually orthogonal CI code during modulation. Research
shows that, through the frequency domain diversity, the above
transmission technology can on one hand effectively improve
the visible light transmission quality, on the other hand, the
CI code allows each data modulation is evenly staggered in
the time-domain waveform, instead of as a random sum of
multiple sinusoidal signals in the OFDM, which can effectively
reduce the OFDM transmission signal PAPR. Therefore, CI-
OFDM can be potentially applied as a multi-carrier transmis-
sion scheme in visible light communication system.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The system
structure and principle are presented in Section 2. In Section 3,
the performance analysis is performed. The simulation results
of our system are showed in Section 4. Finally, the conclusion
is drawn in Section 5.
II. SYSTEM STRUCTURE AND PRINCIPLE
A. CI Code and CI-OFDM
The concept of CI code was ﬁrstly proposed by Nassar,
et al. in 1999 [6]. It was then regarded as a new multiple
access technique and applied in the multi-carrier systems. The

PAPR performance of visible-light CI-OFDM and OFDM systems
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a visible-light communication
system and corresponding transmission scheme based on CI-
OFDM, which can function as an effective technique enhanc-
ing the performance of visible-light communication system.
Simulation results show that for a required BER of 10−3 in
the frequency selective channel, the visible-light CI-OFDM
can yield 1dB gain of SNR. Simultaneously, this method can
effectively reduce PAPR with the help of CI codes.
