Abstract—In this paper, a low complexity long pseudo noise
(PN) code acquisition scheme is proposed for spread spectrum
systems including global positioning system (GPS) and code
division multiple access (CDMA) system. By using a phase-
shift-network, the proposed scheme has less complexity than
the conventional dual correlating sequential estimation scheme.
From the analytic and numerical results, it is conﬁrmed that
the proposed scheme has the lower hardware complexity and
the same mean acquisition time performance compared with the
conventional scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
In spread spectrum (SS) receivers, the pseudo noise (PN)
code synchronization is one of the most important tasks,
which is generally carried out in two stages: code acquisition
and tracking [1]. In the code acquisition stage, the coarse
alignment between the received and locally generated PN
codes is performed, and subsequently, in the code tracking
stage, the ﬁne alignment between the two codes is performed.
In recent SS-based mobile communication systems includ-
ing global positioning system (GPS) and code division mul-
tiple access (CDMA) system, a long PN code is essential to
provide reliable positioning service or user distinction [2], [3].
However, acquisition of a long PN code leads to excessive ac-
quisition time and hardware complexity for serial and parallel
acquisition methods, respectively, which are typical acquisition
schemes in SS-based systems [4].
To deal with acquisition of a long PN code, several schemes
[5]-[7] have been proposed. Ward proposed an interesting
code acquisition scheme based on sequential estimation of
the received PN code [5], which is referred to as the tra-
ditional sequential estimation (TSE) scheme in this paper.
The TSE scheme has a shorter mean acquisition time (MAT)
and a lower hardware complexity than the serial and parallel
acquisition schemes, respectively; however, the TSE scheme
cannot achieve code acquisition when the PN code is inverted
due to data modulation. To overcome this drawback, Chiu
and Lee proposed an improved sequential estimation (ISE)
scheme, which can achieve code acquisition regardless of
whether the PN code is inverted or not by using an expanded
primitive polynomial [6]. By incorporating the TSE and ISE
schemes, Koller and Belkerdid proposed a dual correlating
sequential estimation (DCSE) scheme, which can not only
achieve acquisition for both inverted and non-inverted PN
codes, but also demodulate the SS signal [7], whose hardware
complexity is, however, inevitably high.
In this paper, thus, we propose a novel sequential estimation
scheme for acquisition of a long PN code, which can achieve
acquisition for both inverted and non-inverted PN codes and
can also demodulate data as in the DCSE scheme, yet with
only half the complexity of the DCSE scheme. We refer to
the proposed scheme as phase-shift-network-based differential
sequential estimation (PDSE) scheme since it employs a
differential operator and a phase-shift-network. The numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has a lower com-
plexity regardless of the length of PN code while maintaining
the same level of code acquisition performance compared to
that of the conventional DCSE scheme.
This paper is organized as follows. Details of the system
model and proposed PDSE scheme are described in Section
II. The performance analysis and complexity comparison of
conventional and proposed schemes are delineated in detail
in Section III. Section IV concludes this paper with a brief
summary.
II. PROPOSED SCHEME
Fig. 1 shows the structure of the PDSE receiver proposed
in this paper. At the receiver, as in the conventional DCSE
scheme, PDSE scheme requires n + 1 consecutive chips out
of L (= 2n − 1) chips of PN sequence period for PN
code acquisition. The kth chip of the received signal can be
expressed as
rk =
√
PTcD(2sk − 1) + wk, for k = 0, 1, · · · , n,
(1)
where P, Tc, and D are the power of the PN signal, duration
of a PN chip, and modulated data taking a value in {−1, 1}
with equal probability, respectively, sk ∈ {0, 1} is the kth chip

of the PN code with period of L, and wk is the kth additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) sample with mean zero and
variance of σ2
n = N0Tc/2.
First, rk is mapped into 1 or −1 at the hard limiter with
the threshold 0, and subsequently, the kth output ak of level
shifter1 is obtained by converting the value −1 (1) into 0
(1). To achieve code acquisition regardless of whether the PN
code is inverted (i.e., D = −1) or not (i.e., D = 1), we
use the differential operator whose output can be expressed
as bk = ak + ak+1 for k = 0, · · · , n − 1, which removes the
effect of data modulation. Speciﬁcally, bk equals to sk +sk+1
for both cases that D = 1 and D = −1 in the absence of
noise. Moreover, bk is equivalent to sk+l, the phase-shifted
version of sk with arbitrary phase difference l (0 ≤ l ≤ L)
due to the shift-and-add property [1]. This is the key idea of
the proposed PDSE scheme.
In the loading process (i.e., the loading control switch is set
to ‘S’), {bk}n−1
k=0 are loaded into registers {Rk}n−1
k=0 in the PN
code generator with coefﬁcients of the primitive polynomial
{cj}n−1
j=1 . After the loading process, loading control switch is
set to ‘P’ and we can construct a PN code {ˆbk}L−1
k=0 with length
of L, the l-shifted version of the PN code with correct phase.
Thus, in the absence of noise, we can write {ˆbk}L−1
k=0 as
{ˆbk}L−1
k=0 = {sk + sk+1}L−1
k=0 = {sk+l}L−1
k=0 .
(2)
To estimate the phase difference l between {ˆbk}L−1
k=0 and
{sk}L−1
k=0 , we express {ˆbk}L−1
k=0 in a polynomial forms as
mod{(1 + x), f(x)}/f(x) and mod{xl, f(x)}/f(x) from
equivalent expressions {sk + sk+1}L−1
k=0 and {sk+l}L−1
k=0 , re-
spectively, where f(x) is the primitive polynomial with coef-
ﬁcients {cj}n−1
j=1 . From the polynomial forms of {ˆbk}L−1
k=0 , we
can obtain the phase difference l, and then, delaying the phase
of the output for L−l by using phase-shift-network, the phase
of the output PN code comes to be the same as that of the PN

mask polynomial and expressed as [8]
m(x) = mod{x(L−l), f(x)}
= m0 + m1x + · · · + mixi + · · · + mn−1xn−1,
(3)
where mi ∈ {0, 1} denotes the ith coefﬁcient of the mask
polynomial.
To determine whether acquisition is achieved or not, we
obtain the correlation value U between {rk}n−1
k=0 and the output
of the phase-shift-network changed into bipolar PN code by
level shifter2. Then, the absolute correlation value |U| is
compared with a given threshold value η. If |U| is smaller than
η, the acquisition is determined to be failed and the receiver
repeats the acquisition process. If |U| is larger than η, it is
determined that the acquisition is achieved. Finally, the PDSE
receiver demodulate the data D by using the correlation U
comparing with the threshold of zero.
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
A. Mean acquisition time
The expression of MAT can be obtained by using a gener-
ation function ﬂow graph [9], [10]. Fig. 2 shows a generation
function ﬂow graph of the acquisition schemes based on
the sequential estimation including TSE, ISE, DCSE, and
PDSE, where Pc is the correct chip probability deﬁned as
the probability that the chip is estimated correctly, P v
c is the
correct chip probability of consecutive v chips (in DCSE and
PDSE schemes, v = n + 1), Pd is the detection probability
deﬁned as the probability to achieve the acquisition when all
v chips are estimated correctly, and Pfa is the false alarm
probability deﬁned as the probability that |U| is larger than
η when there exist at least one error in the process of the
sequential estimation. K is the penalty factor associated with
the false alarm. From Fig. 2, the generation function F(Z)
can be derived as
F(Z) =

1 − P vc (1 − Pd)Z − (1 − P vc ){PfaZK+1 + (1 − Pfa)Z}.

where Te is the estimation time spent for loading and estima-
tion process. As we can see in (5), the MAT of the DCSE and
PDSE schemes depends on the correct chip, detection, and
false alarm probabilities.
Since both the hard limiters of the DCSE and PDSE
schemes perform the same operation, those schemes have same
correct chip probability Pc. The correct chip probability of the
kth chip of the received signal is represented as
Pc = 1 − 1

When all consecutive n + 1 chips are estimated correctly
(i.e., correct estimation), in the PDSE scheme, the phase of
the generated PN code after loading process and that of the
PN code from the transmitter are same (the received PN code
is non-inverted) or opposite (the received PN code is inverted).
Thus, the probability density function (PDF) of the correlation
value U can be written in two cases. First, when the received
PN code is non-inverted, the PDF of the correlation value U
of the PDSE scheme can be written as
fU|c(x) =

where M (= L − n − 1),
√
PMTc, and σ2
N = N0MTc/2 are
the length of the correlation, the mean, and variance of U,
respectively. Next, when the received PN code is inverted, the
PDF of the correlation value U of the PDSE scheme can be
written as
f inv

{

(8) has an opposite mean and the same variance compared
with (7). Since the receiving probabilities of the inverted and
non-inverted PN codes are the same, the detection probability
of the PDSE scheme can be written as
Pd = 1
2P{|U| ≥ η|correct estimation, non-inverted}

2P{|U| ≥ η|correct estimation, inverted}

U|c are symmetric. Thus, we can rewrite (9)

(10)
where Φ(x) means the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance.
Since the DCSE scheme exploits the absolute correlation
value and threshold same as in the PDSE scheme for acqui-
sition, the detection probability of the DCSE scheme is the
same as that of the PDSE scheme.
In the other case, if there is at least one chip which is not
estimated correctly (i.e., wrong estimation), the phase of the
PN code generated after loading process is different with that
of the PN code from the transmitter. Let us assume that we use
long PN code thus the period of the PN code L is long enough.
If the PN codes are miss matched, then the correlation value
during M chips can be approximated as −1/L. Since L ≫ 1,
the correlation value can be approximated as 0, and thus, the
PDF of the correlation value of the PDSE scheme (same as
that of the DCSE scheme) in the case of wrong estimation can
be written as
fU|w(x) =
1
√
2πσN

{

(11)
From (11), the false alarm probability can be expressed as
Pfa = P{|U| ≥ η|wrong estimation}

fU|w(x)dx
= 1 − 2Φ( η

).
(12)
So far, we have analyzed the correct chip, detection, and
false alarm probabilities of the PDSE and DCSE schemes.
Finally, by substituting (6), (10), and (12) in (5), we can obtain
the MATs of the PDSE and DCSE schemes.
We prove the analytic results by using Monte Carlo sim-
ulations. Fig. 3 shows the MAT performances of the PDSE
and DCSE schemes. We use the primitive polynomials as
1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x8 and 1 + x3 + x10 and assume
Te = LTc; K = 10L. To calculate the threshold, the false
alarm probability is ﬁxed to 0.01. As the analytic results, the
simulation results demonstrate that the MAT performances of
both DCSE and PDSE schemes are same.
B. Complexity Comparison
In this section, we compare the hardware complexity of the
PDSE scheme with that of the DCSE scheme. To compare the
hardware complexity, we count the number of materials which
compose each scheme as in [11]. Table I shows the number

of hardwares for the PDSE and DCSE schemes. As shown in
Table I, the PDSE scheme needs a half of hardware complexity
of the DCSE scheme in terms of the required registers, correla-
tors, absolute operators, and threshold comparators (generally,
n ≫ 1). Moreover, the PDSE scheme only needs a differential
operator unlike DCSE scheme which requires logic blocks and
an inverting control switch in order to incorporate the TSE and
ISE schemes [7].
The proposed PDSE scheme can be applied to the synchro-
nization process of the SS-based communication systems such
as GPS and CDMA system, where the fast acquisition of long
PN sequence with low hardware complexity is necessary for
practical implementation.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a novel sequential es-
timation scheme for acquisition of a long PN code based
on differential estimation and the phase-shift-network. The
proposed scheme has a lower complexity compared with the
conventional scheme regardless of the length of PN code.
Analytic and numerical results conﬁrm that the proposed
scheme, with only half complexity, has the same level of the
MAT performance to that of the conventional scheme.
