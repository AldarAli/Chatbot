Abstract— In Brazil, many people cannot speak English and at
the same time there is increasing interest in learning mobile
development. Depending on the subject, it is easy to find good
video classes online in English in the form of tutorials and even
more traditional lectures from top universities. However, the
same is not true for videos in Portuguese, which are scarce and
often times poorer in quality. From that scenario, there is a
great opportunity to create video classes in Portuguese with
high quality that can impact the community interested to learn
mobile development. Aiming to help the community, this paper
presents the experience of an activity, which requested the
creation of video classes covering topics related to mobile
development from two multidisciplinary groups of students
coming from different courses at a university in South
America. These videos aimed to be short and offer direct
explanations using practical examples. That group of students
learned to develop mobile applications using the Challenge
Based Learning
(CBL) methodology, which provides an
efficient and effective framework for learning while solving
real-world challenges. This experience shows how different
approaches used to present CBL impacted the creation of
videos, and how the offered activity contributed positively to
the learning of the students and the mobile community in
Brazil.

INTRODUCTION
The Learning Pyramid [1][2] approach of study, also
known as “cone of learning”, developed by the National
Training Laboratory, suggests that most students only
remember 5% from traditional lectures and 10% from what
they read from textbooks. On the other hand, students retain
nearly 90% of what they learn through teaching others.
According to [1], active activities (e.g., to practice doing and
teaching other people) help to better retain contents than
passive activities (e.g., lecture and reading). Following that
idea, there are several new learning methodologies [3]-[5]
that look for a more fulfilling learning journey for students.
One of these methodologies is Challenge Based Learning
(CBL) [3] created by Apple in 2008. CBL fosters learning
while solving real-world challenges. In order to create
learning
opportunities,
CBL
offers
a
framework
that
motivates collaborative work among learners to identify big
ideas, ask thoughtful questions, and identify, investigate and
solve challenges. According to [3], this approach helps
students gain deep subject area knowledge and develop the
necessary skills to thrive in an ever-changing world.
This paper describes learning experiences with two
multidisciplinary
groups of
students,
who
came
from
different courses (e.g., computer science, engineering, law,
design,
communication
etc.)
from
an
activity
which
requested the creation of video classes related to themes
about mobile development. Both groups were participating
in an educational program that taught how to develop iOS
apps [8] using CBL.
As
many
students
did
not
have
any
previous
programming knowledge, an additional motivation was to
leave them to choose the theme for the video. However, the
requirement
of
being
a
subject
related
to
mobile
development in some way had to be respected – examples
ranged from creation of sounds to apps to publishing an app
in the App Store. According to CBL [6], students have to be
engaged to learn something. Thus, that freedom to choose a
theme was a strategy to engage them.
Another motivation to offer such activity was to produce
content in Portuguese that could contribute to the community
interested
to
learn
more
about
mobile
development.
According to [7], only around 5% of Brazilians state they
have some knowledge of English. Considering that scenario,
the second requirement for the activity was that all video
classes should be in Portuguese. Beyond describing how that
activity was offered, the paper explains how it contributed to
the learning of the students, how CBL influenced the video
classes created, and which additional impacts happened from
these new contents.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents an
overview of the CBL methodology. Section III describes the
profile of each students group that participated in the
activity, beyond explaining how that activity was offered.
Section IV presents results collected from the activity and
discusses this data. Lastly, Section V presents the final
considerations about the work performed.

THE CHALLENGE BASED LEARNING (CBL)
METHODOLOGY
According to [6], CBL provides an efficient and effective
framework for learning while solving real-world challenges.
The framework is collaborative and hands-on, asking all
participants (students, teachers, families, and community
members) to identify big ideas, ask good questions, identify
and solve challenges, gain deep subject area knowledge,
develop 21st century skills, and share their experience with
the world.
CBL is based on the foundation of experiential learning
and
is
divided
into
three
main
phases
[6],
Engage,
Investigate, and Act, which are explained below.

Engage. Learners move from an abstract big idea to
a concrete and actionable challenge using the
Essential Questioning process. This process allows
the generation of a variety of essential questions that
help learners to think about personal interests and
needs of the community. At the end, one essential
question should be chosen. From this question a
Challenge turns it into a call to action to learn in
detail about the subject.

Investigate. The learners plan and participate in a
journey that builds the foundation for solutions and
addresses academic requirements. This phase begins
generating Guiding Questions (GQs) related to the
Challenge. GQs are questions that need to be
answered to allow the development of a solution.
The necessary action that allows answering some
GQs is called guiding activity (e.g., interviewing an
expert in a specific area, reading some book etc.). At
the end, learners analyze the data and consolidate the
knowledge acquired from the research.

Act. In the Act phase, learners already have a solid
foundation to begin developing solution concepts.
After the approval of this solution concept, learners
develop prototypes, experiment and test. These
actions can contribute to raise new guiding questions
that need to be answered in the next steps to be
performed.
Thus,
learners
can
return
to
the
investigate phase to complete the research. After
developing their solutions, learners implement them,
measure outcomes, and reflect about the work. The
refinement of the solution can go on until learners
are satisfied.
Throughout
the
challenge,
learners
document
the experience using audio, video, and photography. This
ongoing collection of content provides the resources for
reflection, informative assessment and evidence of learning.

CREATION OF VIDEO CLASSES
In this section, we describe how the activity to create
video classes was offered for two groups of students. Thus,
this section is organized as follows. Subsection A presents
the profile of the participants. Subsection B describes when
and how the activity was executed with the first group, while
subsection C describes the application to the second group.
A.
Participants
Both groups engaged in the activity of creating video
classes while they were part of an educational program,
which taught how to develop iOS apps. Each group
participated during two years of the program and they were
required to be dedicated 20 hours per week. Hence, that
activity was offered during two years of program.
The first group, which received the activity, had 37
students coming from different courses, as shown in Table I.
That group began their learning journey in February, 2016
and ended in December, 2017. Every week students were
mentored by four teachers (3 related to computing and 1
designer), who guided them and provided additional support
throughout their learning process.

Approach Applied to Group 1
Aiming to explain when and how the activity of creating
video classes was offered to the first group, this subsection is
structured in three parts: (i) first, it is contextualized how the
students were using the CBL methodology, before receiving
84

ICSEA 2020 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

the activity; (ii) second, it is explained when and how the
activity was offered; and (iii) third, it is described how and
which data related to that experience were collected.
1) CBL application: When students began the program,
they were presented CBL in a lecture, which explained each
phase and the vocabulary of the methodology (e.g., big idea,
essential question, challenge, guiding questions etc.).
Before receiving the activity, students participated in
several challenges ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months. Each
challenge had different group formations, such as, free,
respecting a maximum number of members per team (3 or 4
people per group), teams with people who never worked
together before, groups pre-defined by teachers considering
the profile of the students (e.g., course and knowledge of
programming) etc. Hence, the main goals of the challenges
were: providing different learning and practical experiences,
engaging students to exchange knowledge between them,
learning technical and soft skills to be a world class iOS
developer, and enjoying their learning journey. Considering
that context, the term challenge was used to refer to the
activity of creating video classes.
In order to put students’ autonomy, proactivity, and
flexibility solving issues to test during challenges, teachers
avoided giving immediate answers to questions asked by
them. The approach adopted was to recommend resources
and ask questions that could motivate them to research and
start questioning themselves about how to find the desired
answers. These issues mapped were used by teachers to
make new lectures, which could help students by providing
additional context after having an actual experience with that
topic during the challenge.
2) Video class activity: The activity was offered to
students twice. The first time was in July, 2016 and the
second in July, 2017. The requirements of the activity
defined by teachers and presented to them were the
following.

Choosing any theme related to mobile development;

Validating the theme chosen with at least one
teacher;

Creating at least one video class;

Respecting the maximum of 10 minutes per video;

Creating
videos
in
Portuguese,
with
practical
examples, and avoiding explanations with slides
with a lot of text;

Choosing to work alone or with some colleague;

Creating and delivering a document that described
their CBL process was not necessary. During all
previous challenges, such document was requested
to students. Thus, that was an important difference.
Considering that one of the main goals was to contribute
to the community interested to learn more about mobile
development, a YouTube channel, called DEV PUC-Rio [9],
was created to share these videos.
In order to guarantee technical correctness and good
quality in the videos, a set of steps was followed by students
and teachers during the activity. Below, the order of these
steps is presented.
1.
Teachers offered a set of resources, which students
could use to create good video classes. Examples of
resources were: links that explained how to use
video edition tools, examples of videos classes etc.
2.
Students brought themes to create videos. Teachers
validated these themes 3 days after the activity was
announced. In general, the themes were accepted,
but a few cases (5 in total) of students with difficulty
in defining some theme were identified. In these
situations, teachers talked with them individually.
Aiming to help them, teachers tried to identify
passions that each student had. Next, some options
were considered together to support their final
decision.
3.
Students created the first version of the video classes
in 10 days. Teachers recommended students in the
first two days to bring a script, which described the
narrative of the video(s).
4.
Teachers
validated
the
videos
delivered.
Each
teacher
was
responsible
for
a
set
of
videos
considering their expertise. Thus, feedback was
written for each video content and shared with its
creator after 7 days the first version was delivered.
The main improvements identified by teachers were:
(i) adjusting the sound or image presented, (ii)
improving or correcting some explanation made,
such as including some resource that could support
it, and (iii) breaking videos in two parts, because, in
some cases, they exceeded the maximum time of 10
minutes.
5.
All students produced a new version of the videos.
Teachers validated and offered feedback for each
new version created. That process was repeated until
achieving a final version for all video classes. The
time it took was more than 20 days.
6.
Teachers published the validated videos on the
YouTube channel created. Thus, the community
could access them easily.
3) Gathering data: After finishing the second activity,
students received a survey with a set of questions. These
questions looked mainly to understand how the experience
with participating in both activities was, how they felt about
the learning acquired from the activity, and if the CBL
impacted the video classes created. To make students more
comfortable answering the survey, it was anonymous.
Below, there is a more detailed list with the points collected
from the survey.

C.
Approach Applied to Group 2
Following the structure presented previously, in the
current subsection we explain when and how the activity of
creating video classes was offered to the second group. Here,
the main differences are highlighted, such as how the second
group had the first contact with CBL, how the activity was
offered to them, and the approach used to gather data related
to that learning experience of students.
1)
CBL application: In the beginning of the program,
students had a first contact with CBL in a challenge offered
without having any previous lecture mentioning its terms and
definitions.
The
main
goal
was
to
understand
the
methodology from the practical experience, making the
process of understanding CBL more natural. Aiming to
engage students and relate the challenge to their lives, the big
idea (i.e., theme, area) offered was the city where they lived:
Rio de Janeiro. That challenge lasted 2 weeks, and students
had to propose something that could improve the city.
However, to propose some solution, students must first
motivate themselves for the challenge (Engage phase),
perform research (Investigate phase), and propose a solution
during a presentation (Act phase). At the end, the teachers
informed the students that the methodology applied was
CBL, and next a lecture presenting the original English terms
of the methodology was made.
Similarly to the first group (see subsection III.B), the
second one also had several challenges ranging from 2 weeks
to 3 months of duration, different group formation strategies,
mentoring with the same four teachers of the group 1, and
they had the same approach to learning that involved
motivating them to be more autonomous, proactive, and
flexible while solving issues.
Lastly, the term challenge was not used to describe the
activity to be offered. The main reason was that some
students did not perform the CBL steps that would contribute
with their learning. Thus, it was called as activity.
2) Video class activity: It was offered for the students
once in September, 2018. The requirements of the activity
and the steps adopted during its execution were the same as
the ones offered for group 1. Like the first group, all students
of group 2 also had to produce at least a second version of
each video. The necessary changes were the same identified
in group 1. At the end of the activity, the video classes were
also published in the YouTube channel created.
3) Gathering data: After the delivery of all video classes,
the same survey applied to group 1 was offered to the second
group. Thus, the survey was answered anonymously, making
students more comfortable to fill it.

DATA COLLECTED AND DISCUSSION
In this section, data gathered from the survey applied
to the students’ groups are presented and analyzed. As
group 1 had taken part in two activities related to creation
of video classes, teachers requested from them answers
based on both experiences. If some difference was
identified, this fact would be mentioned in the survey,
which offered an additional area for comments. On the
other hand, group 2 considered only the single experience
performing the activity offered to them.
Initially, Table III categorizes themes chosen by
students and the number of videos created per category.
Notice that by activity applied, i.e., two activities for group
1 and one for group 2, “front-end development and/or
UIKit” was the theme with the highest number of videos
created. According to [11], UIKit is a framework that
provides the required infrastructure for iOS or tvOS [14]
apps. It provides the window and view architecture for
implementing interfaces, the event handling infrastructure
for delivering Multi-Touch and other types of input to
apps, and the main run loop needed to manage interactions
among the user, the system, and the app.
According to teachers, having a good number of
students producing videos related to front-end was not a
big surprise, because many of them presented high interest
about the topic since the beginning of their participation in
the program. Besides, considering that some technologies
had increased visibility over time, such as Vision [12],
Augmented Reality [13], Machine Learning and IA, such
themes also aroused great interest from the students.
Another piece of information gathered from the survey
was the time spent to create each video. Table IV shows
that more than 50% of the students per group spent more
than
5
hours
creating
each
video.
Analyzing
the
information in more detail, many of them mentioned that
the process of defining the script, creating materials that
could support the videos, learning how to edit videos, were
examples of tasks which influenced the time.

The survey also aimed at understanding how students
felt about the experience of creating video classes for other
people. Table V shows that students from group 2
considered the activity more enjoyable than students from
group 1. Analyzing comments made by students from the
first group, it was possible to identify that some of them
were not as enthusiastic about creating content as when the
first activity was introduced. That feedback was important
and influenced the decision made by teachers to run the
activity with the second group only once.

Another important piece of information analyzed was
a
self-assessment
by
the
students
considering
their
knowledge
level
before
and
after
the
activity
was
performed. From Table VI, it is possible to realize that
both groups felt learning improvements in relation to the
themes chosen. For instance, group 1 had 34 students
answering 5 or higher, and the same happened with group
2, also with 34 students.

As these activities were the first experience of students
creating videos, the survey also looked for mapping which
additional contents related to it, they could have learned.
Thus, Table VII shows answers considering how many
students considered to have a good learning in relation to
the following topics: storyboard, screen capture, video and
audio editing. For both groups, more than 80% of the
students confirmed to have learned at least one of these
topics mentioned. In addition, group 1 had more people
learning these topics than group 2. Analyzing more deeply
the comments offered by students and analyzing the
profile of each group, teachers identified that the second
group had more people with some previous experience
related to video creation. Thus, it probably influenced the
answers collected.

Following the idea of mapping other topics learned by
students during the activity, an additional open question
was offered to them. Thus, as the answer to that question
students could share if they had learned something else.
The results showed improvements related to development
topics
(e.g.,
object
oriented
programming
[16],
87

architecture
and
modularization
[17][18]),
beyond
improvements in communicating to an audience. That was
the soft-skill that was the most mentioned by the students
(more than 20% per group).
The next question was more related to the learning
methodology applied in the program the students were
participating in. It looked to understanding what influence
CBL had on the video classes created according to the
students’ perspective. Table VIII shows that a good part of
the students considered
the impact of the learning
methodology minor (equal or less than 3): 23 students of
the first group and 14 students of the second group.
Aiming to better understand these answers, an additional
area in the survey was offered requesting explanations.

After analyzing these answers, it was possible to
achieve some important conclusions and learned lessons,
as follows.

According to some students from group 1, CBL
would be present if some document describing the
learning process was created. In all previous
challenges offered to group 1 such document was
requested, which could have influenced their
mindsets. From that feedback, teachers realized
they needed to improve how they presented the
idea of the methodology instead of sharing a view
that CBL depends on a formal document to be
delivered during the learning process.

In all challenges offered previously to the students
of
both
groups,
CBL
vocabulary
was
used
intensively. However, when the activity to create
video classes began, these terms were not used as
often by students and teachers. That approach
should be improved.

The activity was offered to the first group as a
challenge. However, after talking with students
and analyzing their experience, teachers realized
that some students did not follow the CBL steps,
such as deep research (Investigate phase) during
that work. To consider an activity as a challenge, it
is important to perform extensive research to help
support
some
solution
proposal.
From
that,
teachers decided to no longer present the activity
as a challenge to the second group, but simply as
an activity.

Some students, who had previous experience with
other active learning/teaching approaches (e.g.,
project based learning [15], design thinking etc.),
sometimes did not connect the steps of the CBL to
the actions that they were taking, such as to
answer the identified guiding questions. Only after
talks with teachers, students realized this. That
was an alert to improve CBL understanding.
Lastly, the survey requested the opinion of the students
if the activity offered was useful to their learning. Table IX
shows that group 2 thought it was more useful than group
1. However, almost 50% of the students (18 people) from
the first group thought it was useful (answered from 5 to
7).

After the activities performed by both groups, more
than 120 videos were made available on the YouTube
channel. Besides, the channel got more than 2 thousand
subscribers, and became an additional reference to new
editions of the educational program performed in Rio de
Janeiro. When some video of the channel becomes
outdated, teachers are looking to motivate the creators or
new students to produce a new version of the video.
An interesting situation that happened with some
students who made videos was to be recognized at national
and international events of development from people, who
were subscribers of the YouTube channel. Some videos
achieved more than 10 thousand views in a few months,
being a resource that the community has been interacting a
lot with through questions and feedback.
After the participation in the program, teachers
mapped on social media students who continued creating
contents for the community (e.g., videos, papers etc.) or
participating
in
events
related
to
development
(conferences, symposiums, hackathons etc.). From group
1, at least 15 people, and from group 2, at least 22 students
participated in these activities.
Having students interested in producing contents and
sharing experiences with other people, it is a way of
contributing to the learning of more people and making the
knowledge wheel spin even more.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Aiming to contribute to the Brazilian community
interested to learn more about mobile development, this
paper described the learning experience of an activity
related
to
video
class
creation
applied
in
two
multidisciplinary students’ groups. The videos produced
are available on a YouTube channel and focus on different
themes related to iOS development.

Considering that such activity was offered in an
educational program that applied CBL, it was important to
understand how students looked for the methodology and
how teachers could improve the approach to use it.
One future work intended is to propose a translation
of the CBL vocabulary, which is currently in English, into
Portuguese. Thus, many students who do not master
English will be able to learn from a CBL version using
their native language. When an immediate translation to
Portuguese is made, some of the CBL terms can be
ambiguous or misleading, as some participants of the
program report. Thus, performing a study that can gather
feedback from beginners or more advanced learners that
use CBL it a possible approach to be followed.
Another work that teachers are thinking to adopt in
the program is to identify from the very beginning which
students are interested to produce content in Portuguese.
Thus, a possible more personalized learning track related
to production of new contents could be introduced to
students. Hence, offering personalized tracks is a possible
approach to engage students to learn more contents and
maybe contribute to the learning of other people.
