Abstract— This paper deals with the mathematical modeling 
for the thermoacoustic phenomena in a simple geometry 
combustion chamber represented as the Rijke tube. The 
methodology developed to get an analytical model from the 
Luikov equations for the dynamical behavior of both variables 
of interest the temperature and pressure distributions into the 
cited chamber is described briefly. Through this model, the 
time and space Eigenvalues are calculated to interpret them in 
terms of the combustion chamber geometry; also the spatial 
distribution (modal shapes or Eigenvectors) of both variables 
into the confined volume in the chamber are analyzed by the 
boundary conditions. The obtained analytical model from the 
Luikov 
modified equations is complemented with an 
experimental modeling for the dynamics of the same variables 
of interest, but based on the wave equation and considering the 
same boundary conditions. To validate both models for the 
thermoacoustics dynamics, a Rijke tube experiment was 
developed, by getting the experimental data to support the 
analytical hypothesis from the synthetized models. The main 
purpose of this paper is to compare the two mathematical 
modeling methodologies to know the set of assumptions needed 
to have a real idea of the fundamental modal shapes for the 
temperature and pressure in this combustion chamber 
geometry when the thermoacoustic phenomena is presented.

INTRODUCTION  
 
Modern society needs to be conscience about all energy 
conversion process which affects the natural environment 
health. There are several efforts to maximize the natural 
energetic resources use by the synergy of thermodynamic 
technologies that combines systems for cooling and heating 
with several applications [1].  However, the achieved 
magnitude of both the worldwide population as well as the 
energy consumption for the ambient conditioning for living 
or for the perishables products conservation are considerable 
with the current natural energetic resources availability [2] 
[3]. 
In terms of the power generation technology which takes 
advantage from the synergy of two complemented 
thermodynamically cycles, we have the gas turbine 
technologies. The ammonia gas turbines combine the 
absorption ammonia cycle to diminish the surface 
temperature of the combustion chamber housing; then this 
transported energy heats the ammonia-air mixture to increase 
the combustion performance into the cited chamber [4]. This 
technology is applied for naval transportation where the 
ammonia use does not affect the population health and the 
engine performance is critical because of the fuel 
availability. In this context, the new trend for this technology 
is to apply it for the home services suppling using the 
industrial waste as fuel. 
Other example of the synergy from a modified 
thermodynamic cycle is the heat pumps technology; which 
works based on the vapor compression so it complements 
several air conditioning systems and this device works in 
both directions to heat or cooling [5]. Nowadays, because of 
the time market availability this technology cannot be 
considered innovation but it is one of the most representative 
examples of efficiency in terms of the resources use for the 
ambient conditioning. 
In the same technological synergy and because of its 
thermo-electrical nature Peltier’s devices are used for the 
heating and cooling purposes. In these experimental cases, 
the energy transportation is mainly performed by conduction 
(not convection) [6], so their implementations are more 
punctually located in terms of energy transportation. 
Cited technologies have been carefully designed to have 
the best thermodynamic performance in terms of the 
variables of interest listed as the temperature, energy and 
pressure; but these design engineering are based on the 
steady state behavior of the named variables, where the 
relationships between them do not considers the dynamical 
evolution of each one neither and their cross effects. 
The thermoacoustic phenomena can be described as the 
acoustical energy caused from an uncontrolled density of 
heat in a confined volume [7]. In the gas turbine technology 
point of view, thermoacoustics means that the heat released 
in a combustion chamber generates pressure oscillations 
inside which decreases the engine performance, [8]. This 
relationship between heat and air pressure (sound waves) 
was discover by Rayleigh [9] and formulate by Merkli [10]. 
Thermoacoustic unstable evolution may cause several 
problems in the fuel system of a gas turbine, therefore it 
induces: 
efficiency 
degradation, 
premature 
wear 
of 
components 
and 
catastrophic 
failure 
[11]. 
Also, 
thermoacoustic phenomenon combined with the high levels 
of both pressures and temperatures affects the fuel air 
mixture process and then de combustion performance, 
producing also highly polluting particles such as NOx [12]. 
Nowadays, the state of the art concerned with the 
thermoacoustic phenomenon effects on the gas turbines 
performance, has been mainly focused on the development 
of some techniques as well as the swirling flows [13-14]. 
These swirling flows provide aerodynamic stability to the 
combustion process by producing regions of recirculating 
flows which diminish the flame length and increase the 
residence time of the reactants in the flame zone [14]. 
Experimental analysis from combustion test rig using 
different kind of injectors, constrictors, air-fuel mixes have 
been performed to find the best technique for combustion 
system [15]. Also, in terms of the flow, others studies have 
included premixed fluid and Helmholtz resonator [16]. 
The gas turbine combustion modelling and simulations, 
along with the acoustic phenomenon perturbation, implies 
the necessity of implementing a control algorithm. The basic 
gas turbine model equations [17] are important for analysis, 
design and simulation of control system, especially for 
Combined Cycle Power Plants (CCPP) [18] and [19]. 
Focusing on acoustics, new passive and active control 
techniques for such thermoacoustic instabilities have been 
developed and implemented [20] as well as techniques of: 
Adaptive Sliding Phasor Averaged Control (ASPAC: 
adaptation of the valve-commanded fuel phase for flow 
variations) [21] and Multiscale extended Kalman (MSEK: 
prediction of the time-delayed states) are promising 
techniques to reduce the energy consumption produced by 
pressure oscillations [22], nevertheless, more research is 
required. 
In the same way, into the perturbation control topic, the 
dynamics model for the thermoacoustic phenomena 
proposed in this work has been envisaged to be the first part 
of a continuous control algorithm to diminish its effects into 
a combustion chamber. This research is carried out for the 
Engineering Center for Industrial Development (CIDESI) at 
Queretaro México, by the National Laboratory for Cooling 
Technologies Research (LaNITeF). 
This paper structure has been defined to follow up the 
methodology proposed to validate a mathematical model for 
the thermoacoustic dynamics in a Rijke tube combustor; 
which consist in a theoretical modeling based on the Luikov 
equations adapted for the confined volume of the gas flowing 
in the cited chamber, and which is described in Section II. 
Then in Section III the procedure to develop the analytical 
model of pressure oscillation trough air columns is 
presented. Section IV presents the results from a Rijke tube 
experiment; here the required Fourier analysis is detailed to 
find the fundamental oscillation mode, where because of the 
prediction the speed of sound and the medium properties 
such as density, are required to determined parameter values 
of pressure distribution model. Section V describes the

results and validation of both theoretical and analytical 
models. Conclusions are presented in Section V. 
II. 
THEORETICAL MODEL FOR THE TEMPERATURE AND 
PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION FROM THE LUIKOV EQUATIONS  
Luikov proposed a model for the heat and mass transfer 
in capillary porous bodies at 1966 [23], which mainly consist 
in a differential equation system of first order with two 
degrees of freedom (temperature and mass). This model has 
been modified several times as an alternative model from the 
Navier – Stokes equation [24] when its analytics solutions 
are needed for flow dynamics through different kinds of 
medias [25] [26] and [27]. 
A. Analitical solution of the Luikov equations 
Originally the Luikov equations were developed for the 
mass and energy transportation through porous bodies; but in 
this case, the confined volume into the combustion chamber 
is not a solid media neither a porous one. Therefore, the 
hypothesis to use this equation system is based on the 
concept of finite volume, where the mass transportation does 
not face an interface between them; it just does at the 
boundary conditions. The heat transportation between the 
finite volumes is no considered, because the energy 
transportation is done mainly by convection.  
Then the Luikov model is defined by a first order 
differential equation system, for temperature and pressure as 
well as it is:

where T and ρ are the temperature and air density

considered that the physical properties, which define the 
coefficients of (1), are constants and executing the 
substitution of the first order timed differential for the air 
density magnitude, equation (1) becomes

Another significant consideration in this proposal is that 
all function can be separable from the time domain to the 
space domain, so dimensional functions can be taken as

equation (3) can be organized as:

The theory for the dynamics analysis for systems is 
focused on the analysis of the impulse response, because it 
represents the system transient response when it changes 
from an equilibrium state (Transfer Function). Therefore, to 
analyze this system dynamics, it is considered that there is 
not heat injection (energy source) neither pressure 
perturbation 
 
                      
         
      (7) 
 
The different domains functions can be now separated 
from (7); therefore, by equating them to a constant parameter 
which has almost the same interpretation than the wave 
number concept

B. Rijke boudary conditions 
The next step to get the analytical solution is to calculate 
the constants in terms of the boundary conditions, so if it is 
considered the ambient temperature and air density as the 
reference for the first boundary condition of the Rijke tube 
shown in Fig. 1, then the constants for the dual dominium 
solution functions given by

The third boundary condition of the Rijke tube is located 
at point in which the thermal energy is supplied. Therefore, 
the temperature has a maximum point there while the air 
density is minimal. These boundary conditions are illustrated 
in Fig. 3. With these considerations the third set of 
coefficient are estimated as: 
 
               
   (18) 
where 
 
 
   
Given the final model version as: 
 
  
 (19) 
 
Both variables distributions along the axial longitude are 
the same; but, as well as it was discussed before, the 
temperature TL(t) at x=L/5 is maxima, and through 
convection with a controlled energy source QL(t) coefficient 
b4 can be written as: 
 
                      
    
    (20) 
 
In this point the temperature behavior can be written in 
terms just of b4 as 
 
 (21) 
 
By taking advantage of the equivalent axial distribution 
of both variables of interest, the b8 coefficient can be 
considered as: 
 
                         
              (22) 
 
Finally, the dynamics of the spatial behavior of both 
estimation variables can be written in terms of the boundary 
conditions and the energy supplied to the Rijke tube.

Here we can say that because of the constant volume, the 
air density and pressure variables have the same dynamical 
and spatial behavior.

ANALYTICAL MODEL FOR PRESSURE OSCILLATION 
FROM THE WAVE EQUATION 
 
Thermoacoustic phenomenon is defined as the direct 
transformation from thermal energy into acoustic energy. 
Three conditions are required for this transformation [1]:  
1. The medium must be a compressible fluid,  
2. A temperature gradient must exist, and  
3. The control volume must be contained by a 
physical border (chamber housing) [28].  
The wave equation is a linear second-order differential 
equation for both the time as spatial domains, which 
describes the propagation of oscillations in a continuous 
media. The goal of this section is to establish a wave 
equation relation for the pressure variable in an air column 
when the thermoacoustic phenomena appears into a Rijke 
tube. 
A. Stationary wave in an air column  
The wave equation for acoustic pressure is given by [29].

   the air density under equilibrium conditions.  
As well as it was performed for the Luikov equations, the 
wave equation solution for the acoustic was solved via the 
variables separation strategy. 
The concept of a standing wave is based on the spatial 
superposition of two waves with the same time and space 
frequencies, which travel in opposite directions in the 
medium with the same amplitude. For this Rijke tube 
experiment, the standing wave resulting from the wave 
equation for the air behavior, which is given as

law for fluid gradient [30] was used to formulate the pressure 
of standing waves in an air column, where

Equation (26) describes the distribution of pressures with 
no boundary conditions. Then again, as well as it occurs for 
the Luikov equation solutions, the boundary conditions for 
the air wave describes the Eigenvectors, which for this case 
are analyzed as nodes (see Fig. 4). 
 
B. Node analysis (modal shapes or Eigenvectors) 
A tube open at both ends provides a physical border for 
the concerned air column contained. Reflection causes nodes 
and antinodes of pressure and air displacement, as well as it 
is illustrated by Fig. 4. 
Figure 4. Pressure and displacement for the air in the columns. 
 
Air displacement nodes are associated with the motion of 
its molecules, which produce in this case the modal nodes. 
Therefore, at both ends of the column into the Rijke tube 
boundaries must be a pressure node because the atmosphere 
cannot present a significant pressure change induced by this 
phenomena [31]. Then the relationship between pressure and 
motion of the air can be written as (24). 
The generalized one-dimensional equation that describes 
the pressure distribution of an air contained in a cylindrical 
combustion chamber is obtained by considering the 
boundary conditions illustrated on Figs. 1 and 2. Then from 
(24), the pressure distribution model can have been

RIJKE TUBE EXPERIMENTE 
With the intention of confirming, thermoacoustic is 
concerned with the interactions between heat (thermos) and 
pressure oscillations in gases (acoustics). Then a “Rinke 
Tube”, named after its inventor, is a fundamental tool for 
studying thermoacoustic phenomenon. Rijke tube turns heat 
into sound, by creating a self-amplifying standing wave. This 
open cylinder resonator contains a metallic copper mesh 
positioned about one-fifth of the total tube length. When the 
mesh is heated by a burner flame and then when the flame is 
take out, the concerned mesh will produce a strong sound 
pitch at its resonant frequency for several seconds. 
A Rijke tube experiment was performed considering the 
experimental setup shown in Fig. 5 [32]. This Rijke tube 
consist on: a steel pipe of 0.5 m long and a 0.04445 m (1 ¾ 
in) diameter with a thickness of 0.00121 m, is selected and 
instrumented, as seen in Fig. 5. Let xm be the distance 
(0.12m) where metallic mesh was placed. 
 
 
Figure 5. Data adquisition for Rijke tube experiment . 
Rijke tube turns heat into sound, by creating a self-
amplifying standing wave just after the heat source provided 
by a gas burner was taken out. Gas burner add energy to the 
system until to metallic mesh rise a 600 °C of temperature; 
then, the heat source is moved aside and thermoacoustic 
phenomenon appears. It is important to consider that the 
position of pipe must be maintained vertical. 
A. Fourier analysis 
Time domain analysis is the interpretation of physical 
signals evolution with respect to time. It is beneficial when 
observing data such as temperature. However, because of the 
time response some applications require analyzing the 
frequency components of signals, such as pressure oscillation 
of the air. 
The acoustic pressure was measured using a microphone 
during Rijke tube experiment [33]. Time domain acoustic 
signal does not provide significant information for analysis. 
Hence, Fourier analysis is required. A fast Fourier transform 
(FFT) is an algorithm that samples a signal in time domain 
(or space domain) and turns it into frequency domain, 
exhibiting its frequency components. FFT helps to find the 
fundamental frequency produced by the air column 
resonance. 
The experiment is executed taking 44100 samples per 
second using the microphone. The Fast Fourier Transform 
was applied with a resolution of 15 bits. Frequency 
resolution is 1.34 Hz, i.e., every 743 ms the algorithm takes a 
package sample to analyze. 
The signal for amplitude in time domain and frequency 
domain obtained with the microphone is shown in Fig. 6. 
Here the first modal mode presence is identified at 301 Hz 
with an amplitude of 0.1941 Pa.  
 
 
Figure 6.Signal analysis of acoustic pressure 
B. Sound speed in the air 
The speed of sound is affected by changes in the medium 
(density, humidity, temperature, etc.). For our study case, the 
element that changed significantly is the temperature. 
The geometry of the combustor determines frequency 
and wavelength of the oscillating pressure produced by the 
thermoacoustic effect. The symbol   is the label for length 
of the wave. Fig. 7 illustrates a reflection wave on the pipe 
open ends. The output wave (green) and the reflected wave 
(red) only perform half a cycle each. The tube length is half 
the Wavelength.  
Considering idealistic conditions, the fundamental 
frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the tube.

Figure 7. First vibration mode in air column. 
In an ideal tube, the wavelength of the sound produced is 
directly proportional to the length of the tube. A tube with 
aperture at one end and closed at the other one produces 
sound with a wavelength equal to four times the length of the 
tube. In acoustics, end correction factor is a short distance 
added to the actual length of a resonance pipe, to calculate 
the precise resonance frequency of the pipe. The tone of a 
real tube is lower than the predicted theoretically. The end 
correction for a pipe is given as

At the end, the speed of sound resulted is 379.18 m/s. 
 
C. Temperature of the air 
Temperature is a physical quantity produced by motion 
of the molecules, giving a perception of hot and cold. 
Temperature is associated with friction. Molecular friction is 
associated with pressure and density in the air. The ideal gas 
law is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases 
under several conditions, although it has limitations. The 
most frequently form of a state equation is given by 
          
M
P  RT

   
 
    (31) 
 
 The acoustic wave velocity c depends of the material 
properties. Speed of sound is proportional to bulk modulus   
and inversely proportional to density of the air as dictate in 
(23), resulting in this case as 
  c2

 
Where 
 P
 and  is the heat capacity ratio. There is a 
strong relationship between pressure of the air, density of the 
air, temperature of the air and speed of sound [33]. This 
relationship is

Equation (33) is defined using nominal values of air. The 
density of a substance is the relationship between mass 
amount and volume occupied. The density can change by 
changing either the pressure or the temperature. Increasing 
the temperature generally decreases the density.

Pressure distribution along the can-combustor is 
described in Fig. 8. This paper becomes useful for several 
combustor chambers with similar geometries.  
Advanced FFT Spectrum Analyzer is used to verify in 
real-time the signal evolution, as depicted in Fig. 9. Due to 
expansion and compression ratio, the air will generate high 
pressure areas whose magnitude is directly proportional to 
the temperature of the medium. The temperature of the metal 
gauze oscillates around 600 °C at t=0, convectively 
transferring the thermal energy and change the properties of 
the medium. The average temperature of the column was 78 
° C.

Figure 9. Fundamental frecuency measure on Rijke tube experiment. 
It is experimentally proven with the results that the speed 
of sound has been altered by the temperature change in the 
medium that propagates the disturbance, which was 379 m/s. 
Following the relationship on (23), the fundamental 
frequency of the gaseous fluid contained in a cylindrical 
geometry is obtained. Thermoacoustic phenomenon presence 
is used to validate the pressure distribution model for the air 
oscillation inside the Rijke tube. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Taking as reference theoretical results from equations 
(19) and (28) both predicts a modal node just at the middle of 
the Rijke tube axial dimension for the air density and 
pressure, respectively. Also, (19) predicts an antinode for the 
temperature behavior. 
Experimentally, the air density and pressure modal node 
have been proven by the results reported in Fig. 8; where the 
thermodynamics relationship between the air flow speed 
(sound) and the internal temperature measured supports these 
results from the Eigenvalues gotten in Fig. 9. 
So that, at the end, the main conclusion is that the 
propagation of acoustic oscillation in a compressive medium 
(air in this case) may be induced by applying thermal energy 
to the chamber housing surface, so the thermodynamic 
relationship between pressure, density and temperature has 
been verified for a single geometry combustor chamber, a 
Rijke tube in this case. 
The pressure distribution model for the dynamic behavior 
of the pressure oscillation into a Rijke tube synthesized from 
the wave and Luikov equations, was validated by predicting 
the first mode frequency of the air column pressure inside, as 
well as it is shown in Fig. 10, where also the Fourier 
Analysis results are included.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Experimental Model validation. 
Experimental results illustrated in Fig. 10 were obtained 
by using a thermos-camera and a set of thermocouples at the 
Rijke tube external surface. Both models in the temperature 
space shows an acceptable prediction, but analysis needs to 
explain why boundary conditions has change in their average 
values. 
Based on the temperature results, the Luikov equation for 
pressure can be used with certain reliability to have a model 
for both variables. 
The next step is to use both models to predict the 
concerned variables behavior but by been taking into account 
the experimental measurement of their boundary values. 
For the National Laboratory of Cooling Technology 
Research, the results reported here are important in terms of 
the thermoacoustic technology development to provide an 
alternative for the cooling systems; because from these 
fundamentals both models are going to be used to develop 
control strategies for the cooling generation and ambient 
conditioning. 
For the P02 project from the CEMIE Eolic program, 
these results take importance because of the presence of the 
thermoacoustic 
phenomena 
in 
several 
additive 
manufacturing process, which disturbs the manufacturing 
finishing and composition.
