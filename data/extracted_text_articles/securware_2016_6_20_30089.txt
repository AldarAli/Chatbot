Abstract— This paper presents and evaluates theoretical
approaches applied to the interdependencies description of
important
critical
infrastructure
areas.
It
describes
the
theoretical
basis,
and,
in
some
cases,
their
practical
application, with an emphasis on the important critical
infrastructure sectors (e.g. Energy, Transport, Information
and Communication Technologies). Other important critical
infrastructure sectors (e.g. Water Management, Health Care,
and
Emergency
Services)
are
not
emphasized
in
this
publication because they are addressed in the security research
project RESILIENCE 2015. The aim of the article is to define
the linkage types as a framework and baseline for resilience
functional parameters definition, which is crucial for objective
and relevant critical infrastructure resilience establishment.
The article outcomes can also be seen as an analytical input to
the above mentioned project activities.
Keywords-

I.
INTRODUCTION
One of the basic attributes of the critical infrastructure is
its network nature. Therefore, the interdependence of the
various sectors and elements contained in it creates logical
patterns.
In the Czech Republic, considerable attention has been
given to important sectors of critical infrastructure (CI) in
recent years. In the process of identifying a designation of CI
elements, and addressing their protection, however, only
individual sectors were taken into account and impacts of
inter-linkages at inter-sectoral level were not considered. In
addition, research into this issue has not been adequately
developed. Reflection necessity of basic CI attribute, which
is the interaction between the different sectors and their
elements, was not been taken into account when assessing
the criticality of the process or in providing protection.
Recent prevailing approach, when the important CI sectors
protection of major is dealt separately [1], [2], with regards
to the basic characteristics of the system, need to be
perceived as a weak and unsustainable.
The following text summarizes selected theoretical
approaches to the classification of types of linkages between
important CI infrastructure sectors/elements, published in
domestic and foreign scientific literature, and, therefore
offers the possibility of their further use for the needs of the
research project.
The rest of the paper is divided in three
sections The
first
section discusses and
presents
the
theoretical and philosophical framework in context of critical
infrastructure dependencies and interdependencies in the
wider context. The second and main section presents the
outcomes of our state of the art analysis in connection with
types of linkages classification approaches. The analysis
structure
represents
the
needs
of
security
project
RESILIENCE 2015 which was mentioned above. The last
section presents the synthesis of the analysed solutions and
analysis in selected areas.
II.
TYPES OF LINKAGES CLASSIFICATION APPROACHES
ANALYSIS
Critical infrastructure is seen as a System of systems,
and, therefore a fundamental condition that must be met is
the linkages between the system's elements.
Generally, for linkages of any type within any system, it
is necessary to distinguish with regard to the designed level.
Figure 1 [3] illustrates this approach and distinguishes
linkages between the CI systems and linkages inside the
system between the individual elements.
Figure 1. Linkages inside the CI [11]
Research on dependency linkages between the important
CI and their elements in the Czech Republic is still a subject
of scientific interest. Therefore, in the literature, this topic is
addressed
only
marginally.
The
fundamental
works
published [4][5][6] are generally analysing the existing
foreign sources.
Foreign research studies that could
significantly
contribute
to
addressing
the
typology
of
linkages were also published in the Czech Republic.
In the foreign literature, the topic of linkages in CI
sectors is widely addressed. One of the most important
sources can be considered an article by Rinaldi et al. [7]
100

which bring together experts from the Czech Republic well
as foreign experts. The approaches in that publication are
also reflected partly or completely in published practical
applications [8][9][10], as well as in conceptual documents
[11].
Rinaldi et al. [7] offer several possible approaches to
categorizing linkages. In terms of the direction of functional
failure,
linkages
can
be
of
type
dependency
or
interdependency.
A linkage dependency is an expression that applies when
infrastructure
B
is
affected
by
infrastructure
A,
but
infrastructure A is not within the same infrastructure linkages
affected by B. Dependence is a one-sided type of linkage. An
example of such a link is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Example of dependency - dependency on electricity [7]
Linkage interdependency is an expression that applies
when CI A is dependent on CI B through a certain linkage,
and CI B is dependent on CI A through other linkage.
Linkage of interdependence is a two-sided type of linkage.
An example of such a linkage is shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Example interdependency - the interdependence between selected
CI sectors [11]
Regarding categorization of linkages in terms of their
action direction, Rostek, Markuci & Adamec [6] report that,
if CI A positively / negatively affects CI B through a
linkage, it is not a requirement that CI B was dependent on
CI A. It is, therefore, a sign that expresses a kind of
precursor
patterns
of
dependency
and
its
ability
of
stimulatory or inhibitory effect.
Rinaldi et al. [7] exclusively emphasize the use of the
term interdependency whose content concept corresponds to
the most real systems and their holistic perspective.
In the same publication from Rinaldi et al. [7], another
possible approach is further hinted at, which is based on the
ability of CI sectors and their components interactions.
Despite the fact that this case only dealt with the individual
sectors, respectively their elements characteristics, and did
not deal with direct linkages typology, this approach can be
considered
inspirational
to
the
general
perception
of
linkages between the CI sectors. From this perspective, it
provides the following types of sectors:
• Supported,
The industry is dependent on the function of other sectors
and their role is predominantly passive.
• Supportive,
The industry is able to influence the function of other
sectors and their role is predominantly active.
Categorization of linkages within the systems is not
addressed exclusively as part of research activities targeted
at CI analysis. For example, it is possible to include the
publication of Bühne et al. [12], which gives basic linkages
typology used in the process of phenomena modelling.
Bühne et al. [12] indicate linkages:
• Requirements,
Requires the existence / need another object (required).
• Exclusivity,
Linkage to selected object precludes the selection of another
object.
• Help / advice,
It describes the positive relationship - object has a positive
influence on another object.
• Obstacles,
It describes the relationship when the object has a negative
impact on another object.
Another approach to linkages classification was presented
by Rinaldi et. al [7] . In relation to the general classification,
according to the direction of dependency linkage and
interdependence linkage, in this context there is more
evolved the interdependency linkage types and further
categorized into the following classes of linkages, through
101

which they are transmitted effects between different CI
sectors and its elements:
• Physical,
The state of the CI sector is dependent on the material
output of other CI sectors.
• Cybernetic,
The state of the CI sector is dependent on information
linkage to other CI sectors.
• Geographical,
The state of the CI sector is dependent on emergencies
arising in the territory.
• Logic,
The CI sector is dependent on the status of a second CI
sector,
and
the
linkage
mechanism
is
not
physical,
cybernetic or geographical (dependence transmitted via
streams,
which
are
for
example
legislation,
financial
instruments).
The
same
linkages
typology
was
presented
by
Peerenboom et al. [13] or Chien-Cheng & Ssu-Min [14].
Dudenhoeffer, Permann & Boring [15] present their own
interdependence linkages typology, which, however, only
slightly differs from the classification referred by Rinaldi et
al. [7]. Dudenhoeffer, Permann & Boring [15] distinguishe
the following types of linkages:
• Physical,
Direct linkages between the CI sectors affecting the flow of
supply - consumption - production.
• Information,
Direct linkages between the CI sectors are given by the
information flow. An example might be the SCADA
systems.
• Geospatial,
Linkages between the CI sectors spatially tied.
• Political,
Linkages
between
the
CI
sectors
affect
decisions
framework.
Physical, geospatial and information linkage can be
considered equivalent to physical, cyber and geographic
linkages. Political linkage can be described in terms of
content meaning linked with subordinated logical linkage
featured by Rinaldi et al. [7], which has a more general
meaning.
The typology by Dudenhoeffera, Permanna & Boring
[15] extends Pederson’s et al. [16] typology by the type of
social linkages, which they perceive as the influence of
factors (public opinion, public trust, and sharing cultural
values) able to transfer to other CI sectors. In terms of
content focus, it can again be social linkage subsume, as in
the previous case by political linkages, under the logic
linkage.
In comparison with previously presented approaches,
Zhang & Peeta [17] present a completely different concept
of CI sectors linkages typology definition. According to this
concept the following types of linkages are proposed:
• Functional,
System functionality requires outputs from the other system
or it possibly can be substituted by a different system.
• Physical,
Some systems are connected by physical attributes. Strong
linkage, therefore, exists when systems jointly share the
right to flow, leading to the mutual capacity constraints.
• Budget,
Systems functionality is largely influenced by the flow and
distribution of public funds, especially in the context of
centrally controlled economies or in the recovery phase after
crisis or a disaster.
• Market,
The existence of shared market sources indicates that all
systems interact in the same economic environment. It
means that the systems always serve the same end-users,
who determine the final consumption of the commodity /
services - according to market opportunities.
A possible example of practical application of the
mentioned approaches to the linkages classification between
the CI sectors is also published in the defence research
project dealing with the so-called Location - Based Critical
Infrastructure Interdependence [8]. In this research, the
dependencies identification were reflected by Rinaldi et al.
[7] presented concept and consider the possible impact of
interdependence between various important CI sectors
through physical, cyber, geographical and logical linkages.
Within the model, some scenarios were simulated. One
scenario was the simulation of a shallow earthquakes with
an intensity of 7.3 modified Mercalli scale (scale was
compiled and based on observations of the earthquake
effects and is used to measure macro-seismic intensity) in a
seismically active region situated in the Strait Georgia,
British Columbia, Canada.
The functional earthquake effect was spatially visualized
in the project. High risk has been identified or a total of 23
objects important to the water infrastructure sector near
Vancouver, Canada. Severe damage is also expected near
Vancouver airport. Spatial analysis helped identify the level
of risk with regard to population density. Simulations
showed
that,
due
to
electricity
supply
failure,
the
functionality of another important CI will be disrupted.

According to the findings above, high pressure will be faced
from the part of emergency services, as an element of one
CI sectors (class no. 9 - Safety). Significant impact in this
field is also foreseen to the transport sector.

The classifications are generalized expression of the
possible
types
of addictions
and
transmission
effects
between the CI sectors.
Current literature offers several possible approaches to
classifying linkages between the CI sectors and their
elements. From selected international sources as well as
from the Czech Republic, we conclude that the most
frequently cited classification is the one presented by
Rinaldi et al. [7]. This classification distinguished the
linkages as physical, cyber, geographic and logical. This is
developed not only in the theoretical research, but it is also
used for practical applications needs and the assessment of
CI individual relations.
IV.
CONCLUSION
This article has possible applicability in the project
RESILIENCE 2015.
Dynamic
resilience
evaluation of
interrelated critical infrastructure subsystems should be
through the prism of this classification in order to see how
the flows within important CI sectors, particularly in the
sectors
of
energy,
transport
and
information
and
communication technologies affect each other and how they
affect
the
other
important
CI
sectors
through
interdependencies. The recommended theoretical concept of
reflection on the issue of CI sectors interdependence is also
used in the strategy plan of the new approach to the critical
infrastructure sectors protection at EU level [11]. The article
goal is to identify basic understanding of linkages type
modelling in the context of critical infrastructure. Linkage
type’s definition is seen as a significant input to the security
research project RESILIENCE 2015, mostly in relation to
functional parameters identification for the domino and
synergy effect assessment process. This article outcome
provides a philosophical and theoretical framework and
analysis implementation in the context of interdependencies
impact in connection with critical infrastructure resilience
assessment.
