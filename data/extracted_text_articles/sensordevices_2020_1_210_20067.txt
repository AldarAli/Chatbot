Abstract—World Health Organization considered air pollution 
the most dangerous threat to human health. This paper 
presents a novel system to mitigate risks derived from polluted 
air by introducing a portable device for vulnerable people able 
to detect hazardous pollution concentration and to suggest 
healthy behaviors. Along with the device, a tailored web server 
application, called Monitoring Outdoor Quality of Air 
(MOQA), is developed. The application will make the data 
collected from the device’s sensors more readable and will 
provide citizens with air quality information. That information 
will alert vulnerable people about air pollution hazards and let 
them take actions consequently. This system can reduce the 
health risks derived from air pollution for the weakest 
population in the short-term.

INTRODUCTION
SLow Onset Disasters (SLODs) are continuous, low 
intensity, and high frequency events that represent a serious 
risk for the health of people [1][2]. Among SLODs, the 
World Health Organization (WHO) declared air pollution as 
the biggest environmental threat [3]. Hence, developing a 
system that helps the whole community to mitigate the risks 
arising from polluted air would be of great benefit to 
everyone. 
Air pollution is caused by a range of factors including 
transportation, agriculture, waste, anthropogenic activities 
(e.g., respiration), construction, and building operations. 
Indeed, 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions are 
related to the building sector [4]. Within this context, Built 
Environment scenarios, that have low capacity to deal with 
heat absorption and rejection are more prone to expose their 
hosts (people) to SLODs. 
Moreover, the impact of air pollution on people is well 
documented, revealing that some demographic categories 
might be more disadvantaged than others. This vulnerable 
population comprehends toddlers [5], elders [6], and those 
suffering from respiratory issues (e.g., allergies, asthma) or 
cardiovascular problems [7]. Considering that 1) the arousal 
frequency of SLODs’ evidence is larger in urbanized context 
[8], 2) more than half of the world’s population lives in 
urban areas [9], handling strategies should be a priority. 
The effects of interactions between humans and their 
Built Environment (BE) have been studied for a long time 
[10]-[12]. At the same time, it is well documented the 
influence of BE in affecting the intensity of SLODs [13]-
[16]. Consequently, this trine relationship among people, BE 
and SLOD, represents a complex mechanism to depict. 
In Europe, researchers have been studied the progression 
of SLODs, identifying where these disasters are more prone 
to take place or to have a larger effect. For instance, the work 
in [3] reported Italy as one of the most critical areas of 
Central Europe, where the worst conditions have been shown 
for the municipality of Milan. Therefore, this territory 
represents a useful case study to test procedures that might 
reduce air pollution effects. 
Currently, air pollution can be noted and predicted but is 
harder to mitigate. This study aims to reduce risks derived 
from polluted air, by introducing a system that might help to 
protect vulnerable people. Exploiting the novel field of 
Citizen Science [17], in which ordinary people contribute 
information for scientific research, a wearable device has 
been made. The device can measure data about CO2, 
Particulate Matter (PM), and Total Volatile Organic 
Compounds (TVOCs), and send them to a tailored web 
server application, called Monitoring Outdoor Quality of Air 
(MOQA). Looking to the application, vulnerable people 
might understand when the quality conditions of the air are  
dangerous 
for 
their 
health 
and 
consequently, 
take 
precautions. In a short-term period, the actions taken by 
alerted people can mitigate the risks deriving from the most 
extreme dangers, reducing the incidence of pollution on the 
weaker population [18].  
This study is unique in the following ways: i) to the best 
of our knowledge, this is the first research that comprehends 
the introduction of tailored software and a personal portable 
device that can retrieve air quality data; ii) the involvement 
of others citizen to collect air quality measurements, 
exploiting the principles of Citizen Science; iii) the 
implementation of an alert system to increase the safety of 
vulnerable people by mitigating the risks derived from air 
pollutants concentration event. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
presents the background of this research. In Section III are 
reported methods and tools, that comprehend hardware and 
software description. Those instruments will be deployed in 
a case study described in Section IV. Finally, the conclusion 
and future works are discussed in Section V.

BACKGROUND
Typically, air quality is monitored by stationary 
monitors, able to measure pollutants as well as temperature 
and relative humidity. However, these monitoring stations 
are difficult to operate, bulky, and expensive. Each 
instrument can cost from about 6000 euros to tens of 
thousands euros [19], in addition to a relevant amount of 
resources to be dedicated to maintenance. Moreover, those 
monitors are sparsely distributed in specific locations, 
therefore, they might represent pollutant levels, that vary a 
lot spatially and temporally [20],  only in limited areas near 
the stations. Hence, recently, there has been an emerging 
trend of using low-cost, portable sensors to provide air 
quality data as an alternative monitoring option. Indeed, 
compared to the more expensive air monitors, the introduced 
personal sensors had an overall cost of less than one hundred 
euros. Those sensors are easy to deploy, operate, and 
maintain, thus present significant characteristic to be used at 
multiple locations [21].  
However, low-cost sensors generate data with lower 
precision and accuracy than those registered by monitors 
[22], thus several studies develop calibration models 
deploying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to improve 
the performance of the low-cost sensors. For instance, 
Alhasa et al., used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to 
calibrate three EC AlphaSense sensors, obtaining an r score 
in the range of 0.89 to 0.92 [23]. Among different ML 
algorithms, Neural Networks (NNs) and ensemble methods 
(e.g., XGBoost) produce the best results, with the former 
performing generally slightly better than the latter, albeit 
requires greater efforts in tuning the hyperparameters [24].  
III.
METHODS AND TOOLS
The method adopted in this study is represented in Figure 
1, reporting the  Research Schema. The first step involves 
volunteer who collects data as a part of a scientific inquiry, 
adopting the principles of Citizen Science. This information 
is useful to depict the effects given by the interactions 
between humans and the built environment, which can 
influence SLODs trend. The measurements are collected  
exploiting the usability of the mobile software application 
and low-cost sensors devices. The portable device, unlike the 
stationary monitors, could provide representative data for a 
whole urban area, helping to form a clearer picture of 
pollution field trends. 
To facilitate involved citizens’ work, a tailored mobile 
software application is introduced to retrieve and store the 
data measured by the portable device. To calibrate and 
validate those data, a measurement campaign was carried out 
near the air quality monitor sensors situated in Città Studi. 
The data gathered with this system are then compared with 
those collected by the ARPA (Agenzia Regionale per la 
Protezione Ambientale) station.  
Figure 1. Research Schema. 
The calibration is carried out by an Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN) that takes the data from low-cost sensors as 
input and transform them into corrected measurements using 
ARPA dataset. 
The ANN has allowed increasing the precision of the 
device's measurements, reducing the difference with the 
pollutant level measured by the station. Once the model is 
trained, citizens can measure air pollution in different areas 
using the data corrected by the ANN and, in case of a 
dangerous situation, modify their behavior (e.g., bring their 
inhaler or decide to remain at home). Finally, in the next sub-
sections are described the hardware components used to 
build 
the portable device, 
the 
developed 
software 
application, and the data taken from the regional open data 
repository. 
A. Hardware 
To accomplish the objectives of the Research Schema, 
this study introduced a portable device able to measure 
pollutant levels in the air as well as atmospheric information 
such as temperature and relative humidity. The main board 
of the device is an Arduino, whereas the following sensors 
measure information about air quality: 

1 SparkFun Environmental Combo Breakout - 
CCS811/BME280 - SEN-14348: this sensor 
measures 
Temperature, 
Relative 
Humidity 
(RH), 
Atmospheric 
pressure 
as 
well as 
pollutants’ amount such as equivalent CO2 
(eCO2) and Total Volatile Organic Compound 
(TVOC). The eCO2 output range is from 400 to
8192 ppm, whereas the TVOC output range is 
from 0 to 1187 ppb.   

1 PM sensor SDS011: this sensor detects PM in 
the air. The PM output range is from 0 to 999 
μg/m3 and the humidity working range of the 
sensor is 0-70%. 
The core part of the wearable device is shown in  
Figure 2.

The device makes a measurement every 90 seconds and 
sends it to the web application via wi-fi. 
B. Software 
To collect, store, and visualize data measured by the 
device, this research has introduced a new cross-platform 
application called Monitoring Outdoor Quality of Air 
(MOQA). 
To fetch data and send them to the server, the users 
should be registered via email and password. The database 
used is a Relational DataBase Management System (DBMS), 
which guaranteed the fundamental properties for a database 
of this type: i) atomicity, ii) consistency, iii) isolation and, iv) 
durability. The entity-relationship diagram (Figure 3) shows 
the main sources of the application. 
To encourage widespread adoption of the app, a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed and the 
features of the application are divided by screens as follows: 

Authentication: the user log-in the application 
by his/her email and password; 

Arduino: the user has a quick view of the last 
data retrieved by the wearable device. Besides, 
it is also possible to send and store the data to 
the remote server; 

Map (Figure 4): this screen displays the data 
coming from the Arduino board (blue circles) 
and ARPA dataset (red circles) on a map. The 
radius of a circle depends on the value of the 
data associated; 

Chart: the user can see the data coming from the 
Arduino board and ARPA dataset on a line plot. 
Moreover, a table with a computation of the 
quartile deviation is provided; 

Filter (Figure 5): The user could pick the 
measure to visualize. Once the category is 
selected, the user can choose the time range and 
whether to show the ARPA data corresponding 
to a defined station; 

Settings: the user can change his/her personal 
information, as well as edit the IP address and 
port where Arduino is available.

In Figure 6, it is shown the use case diagram, taken from 
the documentation available on the GitHub repository of the 
MOQA application [25], that shows the flow of operations 
triggered by an actor, which could be the user or the system 
that wants to perform a task. Inside the diagram, the actions 
colored in light blue are performed by the application 
whereas the green one represents the data source.

The major benefits driven by MOQA will be its usability 
and its data reading easiness that allows non-expert users to 
monitor air quality conditions. 
C. ARPA Data 
The data collected with the portable device are compared 
to those downloaded from the Lombardy Region’s open data 
repository (ARPA Lombardia). This database is quite 
extensive and contains all the measures registered by the 
stations, divided into yearly historical series. Each yearly 
dataset for each Air Quality (AQ) station is composed of 
approximately 2.5 million records. Therefore, data for all the 
available AQ sensors have been cleaned, removing negative 
or absent values, and keeping only the validated (VA) 
records. The analysis of the data provided by ARPA can 
provide useful insights about how the pollutants are 
distributed throughout the year and what affects them. For 
instance, in Figure 7, it is reported the analysis of PM10 data 
distribution from 2017 to February 2020. It is clear how the 
PM10 concentration is dependent on the heating period in 
Italy for climate zone E: 15th October to 15th April as stated 
by the DPR n. 74/2013. Indeed, in those periods, the total 
amount of PM10 exceeds the threshold of 50 μg/m3 set by 
the European Environment Agency [26]. 
IV.
RESULTS
The portable sensor had been tested against a reference 
one, i.e., the monitor situated in Città Studi and managed by 
ARPA, to verify its reliability. More than five hundred 
measures of CO2, temperature, and relative humidity of the 
two sensors included in the portable device were used in the 
test. 
Figure 8 shows a comparison between the simultaneous 
reading of the portable sensor and a reference sensor. The 
difference between the measure of the reference sensor and 
the portable one is computed according to the following 
formula: 
Δܥܱଶ = (ܥܱଶ,௥ −  ܥܱଶ,௣)
ܥܱଶ,௥
൘
      (1) 
Figure 7. PM10 from 01/01/2017 to February 2020 registered by the AQ 
station Pascal Città Studi (ARPA). The blue line represents the daily 
average, whereas the orange line shows the 1 month moving average. 
Where: 
Δܥܱଶ is the difference between two measures 
ܥܱଶ,௥ is the reference sensor measure 
ܥܱଶ,௣ is the portable sensor measure 
The reliability of the sensor is not suitable for most 
scientific applications, since during the test period 73.64% of 
the Δܥܱଶ were either bigger than 50% or lower than -50%. 
The difference between the reference and the portable 
sensor readings may depend on many factors. Among these, 
temperature and relative humidity can influence the data 
collected by the device. Figure 9, it shows the difference 
between the two sensors CO2 measures as a function of the 
difference between temperature and relative humidity 
readings. For instance, in some temperature conditions,

Figure 9 highlights a direct correlation between relative 
humidity and CO2 error. 
To calibrate the device’s sensor to the monitor’s 
measures a deep learning model is implemented. The ANN 
designed is a feedforward neural network [27] with an input 
layer, three hidden layers and, an output layer. The net uses 
two types of hidden layer: a) linear layer, i.e., a trainable, 
fully connected net layer that computes w·x+b, where w 
represents the weights, x the input features, and b the bias; b) 
Tanh layer, i.e., a layer that applies the hyperbolic tangent 
function to its input. The net has twelve neurons on each 
layer except for the input and the last two layers. To train the 
network, 80% of the available data were fed to it, whereas 
the remaining 20% has been used for test evaluation. 
Figure 8. The percentage difference between reference and portable sensor 
readings. 
Figure 9. Differences in CO2 sensor readings (color scale) as a function of 
the difference of temperature (X axes) and relative humidity (Y axes). 
The performance of the network on the test dataset is 
shown in the scatter plot in Figure 10. The trained net 
performs very well since the Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient computed for actual and forecasted CO2 is 
R2=97.59. 
Summing up, the ANN allows for much better precision. As 
reported in Figure 11, the difference between portable 
sensor’s measures improved using the ANN and the ones of 
the reference sensor computed according to (1). The Δܥܱଶ, 
in this case, is between -5% and +5% in 92.97% of the 
readings, hence the errors that occurred with non-calibrated 
data are almost canceled. Moreover, most of the incorrect 
correlations are around 900 ppm values (both predicted and 
actual), thus a further investigation on that aspect might 
hone the results. In conclusion, the data adjusted by the 
network might be used to make measures in different zones 
far from the reference station and thus, help to depict 
polluted areas dangerous for vulnerable people. 
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Although SLODs are among the major causes of death, 
few studies have been carried out on their diffusion in the 
built environment, especially in big cities. There are too few 
air quality monitoring stations in cities to understand the 
exact relationship between pollutants and the built 
environment. A crowdsourcing data collection on SLODs 
may help to solve this issue, but low-cost sensor devices are 
needed.

Figure 11. The percentage difference between reference and portable sensor 
readings after ANN correction. 
Thus, a portable air quality monitoring device had been 
made. The small and cheap device and the bespoke mobile 
application allowed for citizen involvement in collecting 
data, but their reliability appeared to be too low during a test 
with reference sensors. To overcome this hurdle, ML had 
been used to calibrate the portable sensor. This approach 
proved to be effective and the data collected from citizens 
are now sufficiently reliable to continue with the next stages 
of research.  
Future works will include the implementation of a 
warning system inside the mobile application that will alert 
vulnerable people in case of dangerous conditions and make 
them act accordingly. This step will help non-expert users to 
be aware of the risks without the need to have a thematic 
knowledge of air pollution and pollutants threshold levels.

Meanwhile, the work on the portable device will continue 
and will be twofold: i) optimization of the hardware (better 
connection, a 3D printed shell, on board software 
optimization, etc) and ii) try to improve machine learning 
performance by deploying further approaches with higher 
model complexity.
