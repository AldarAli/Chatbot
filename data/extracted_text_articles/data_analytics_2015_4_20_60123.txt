Abstract—This work focuses on the analytics and metrics of a
service adaptation. Adaptation is analysed based on activity and
churn behaviour. In a non-binding registration service, churn may
not be a permanent phenomenon, but partial churn prediction
could be more useful as a metric. Based on the ﬁndings service,
adaptation remains similar as the customer base broadens. The
burst type usage data are challenging for churn predictions, but
combinations and merged variables beneﬁt the analysis. As in
the future, the ﬁndings may be integrated as part of a retention
campaign or applied in the development of the service.

INTRODUCTION
This work focuses on the analytics and metrics of a service
adaptation. Data about the temporal adaptation of a service
will provide knowledge and decision support for many causes.
These are for example customer retention and churn, customer
value prediction, and service development actions. Customer
churn is not a measure of success itself, but understanding
causes for it and taking actions to minimize the amount of
churners may produce additional value.
In this work, we have formulated few research questions,
while assuming the service in question is not under develop-
ment during the time period. The hypothesis are based on the
visual interpretation of the Figure 1. In Figure 1, is presented
customer lifetime distribution of four groups, grouped by
registration date. Each customer lifetime is measured from
date of registration to the date of last visit. Number of trial
customers are restricted to 100 for visual clarity. It seems that
the share of active customers remains same and the trial users
and churners could be visible in the data already after two
months (60 days). In this study, we ask:
•
Does the adaptation of the service change as cus-
tomers base increases to include more users than early
adopters?
•
What would be a reasonable time horizon to follow
customers after the registration?
•
How much would additional data add value to the
churn prediction accuracy?
The empirical study conducted in this work is based on the
usage data of a browser based service received from a Finnish
publishing company. The service in question is a publishing
platform with various articles, stories and other content offered
via browser. The study is based solely on back-end data about
article views, browser speciﬁcs and reading times. In service
adaptation, a fundamental concept is customer churn. This
work address the issue by implementing predictions of possible
churners and evaluate them over time.
The number of page views and click-through rates are
widely used measures of success of web browser based ser-
vices. There exists several ready made tools, both freemium
and commercial-of-the-self type solution, for the analysis of
page views and usage data statistics. These are outside the
scope of this paper as the focus is on the service adaptation
over time and the empirical study is based on the user speciﬁc
data and not aggregated values.
The customer lifetime and service usage characteristics has
been studied before. For example, how innovations spread
and take hold [1] and about the nature of e-services and
the e-service experience [2]. For this work, it is sufﬁcient to
recognize that in any new service implementation and roll out
users may behave differently in early stages than later on as the
so called early adopters may place higher value on different
aspects than other users.
The customer event history has been studied from time
window perspective before, c.f. [3]. The work by Poel et al. [3]
focus on an already existing service and the aim is to predict
churners with customer lifetime spanning for years. This work
focus on new service and how the service adaptation develops
over time. Jahromi et al. have studied the churn behaviour
in business-to-business (B2B) context [4] and found out that
similar methodology is suitable as in business-to-consumer
(B2C) context.
This paper makes the following contributions: (1) prob-
lem description on a practical research topic, (2) empirical
experiments of tools and methods for the analysis of service
adaptation, (3) presents key ﬁndings how analytics beneﬁts
the selected domain, and (4) discuss possible future research
aspects and implementations.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section I we discuss
related research. In Section II we presents tools and methods
in more detail which are used in this study. The empirical
study is presented in Section III. Section III presents source
data, pre-processing and results. In Section IV we state our
conclusions and discuss about future research topics.

METHODOLOGY
A. Modelling customer churn
Customer churn has been studied and modelled before in
various context. Understanding churners and possible causes
for it is a way to analyse service adoption over time. Table
I presents examples of customer churn studies. In the table,
there are business sector and the amount of empirical data
presented. As can be seen from the Table I, customer churn
is highly interesting in sectors such as banking, insurance
and telecommunication. Why interest is high in general on
these sectors? Although few companies and services may have
individual drawbacks, high churn rates are present in services
and sectors where competing products are very similar and
complement products are available, switching costs are low
and customers need only one of them, for more see c.f. [5].
Current study focuses on churn from service adoption point of
view in publishing sector.
In short, churners are predicted to increase overall satisfac-
tion of a service. The process can be described in two phases,
c.f [4] or [15]. In ﬁrst phase the customer base is analysed
and possible churners are identiﬁed. Then the churners are
targeted with retention campaigns. Two widely used criteria
for detection are either the most probable churners with the
highest probability of defection or to weight future proﬁt from
lifetime value with the probability of defection.
In sectors such as publishing churn modelling and cus-
tomer relationship management (CRM) are challenging in part
because of rare event data. Rare event data may include
individual events or numerous events, but which happen in
bursts and may have long time periods in between. The case
with rare event data has been studied by Ali et al. in [6],
where rarity is addressed by sampling and observations from
different time periods. Imbalanced data where churners are few
in number may also be called as rare event data [6].
In publishing sector, the share of attention time is impor-
tant concept. Electronic articles as well as all reading is in
part entertainment and the amount of time customers spend
in various channels is a zero-sum game. This implies that
customers may be partial churners. Partial churners have been
studied previously by Miguéis et al. [16] in grocery retail
sector. Miguéis et al. [16] have analysed the importance of ﬁrst
impression as a measure of future customer loyalty. Instead of
already established business or service, this work focus on the
beginning phase of a service and how adaptation develops over
time.
B. Predicting customer churn
In Table I, there are also presented methods applied to
churn analysis or churn prediction. In literature more often than
not the churn is either predicted by probability or classiﬁed in
binary classes. Two of the most widely applied techniques are
logistic regression and decision trees [15]. Other techniques,
such as bayesian inference, partial least square, or support
vector machines may produce additional value (c.f. [17]). In
addition, dimension reduction and feature selection could also
be applied if the amount of data or frequency is large (c.f.
[18]).
In customer activity analysis, a complete churn is usually
a rare event. This implies that class imbalance may create
problems. Weiss et al. [19] names several challenges which
may arise from class imbalance. These are for example,
improper evaluation metrics, lack of data and noise. Class
imbalance in churn prediction has been studied by Poel et
al. [20]. Boosting techniques could be used in case of lack of
data, c.f. [17].
C. Deﬁnition of customer churn
Deﬁning customer churn in a non-binding registration
service is complex and challenging. As described above, the
publishing industry and its services compete with the other
forms of entertainment, and with partial churners it is difﬁcult
to detect the exact time for churn. More importantly the partial
churn maybe even more important from business perspective
than the actual churn.

habits.

In this study churn is deﬁned as a form of inactivity. There
are numerous other ways to deﬁne churn, for example based
on monetary value [16] or cancellation of an account [9]. We
choose ﬁrst six months of 2014 as the data set for the churn
analysis. In Figure 2, examples of the derivation of partial
churn are presented. We deﬁne churn based on article views.
Leaving bounce visits unnoticed, the churners are customer
who are inactive during the month in focus.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
As mentioned in the introduction, our research questions
were formulated based on the visual interpretation of customer
lifetimes and frequency of visits. In Figure 1 lifetime distri-
bution of four customer groups were presented. It seems that
the churners could be detected already early on the duration
of the customer relationship. However, before we can predict
churners we will ﬁnd out if the customer population changes
during the time period.
A. Source data
The service in question was launched in the second half
of 2013. For this study we selected customers who registered
in the ﬁrst half of 2014. In Figure 3 is shown the amount of
customers registered on weekly basis during time period. The
selection of customers from early 2014 allowed us to monitor
the status of each customer for at least six months since the
registration.
The data set in this study included 5956 customers in total.
Figure 3. Selected set of customers based on the registration date.
It is worth noting that we selected our data set based on
customer IDs and sorted them based on the registration date.
However, we used different data sets for reading habit and
activity analysis and churn prediction.
For reading habits and activity, we collected and analysed
data from each customer of the ﬁrst six months of their
customer lifetime. Examples of this type aggregated values are
presented in Figure 2. In the ﬁgure data from each customer
has been aggregated on monthly basis from six months but for
example different months (m1-m6) might not refer exactly to
the same period in the calendar between customers.
For customer churn prediction, we selected customers who
registered between January and April. Each group consisted of
customers registered in a given month. From these customer
groups we formulated seven set of customers for churn predic-
tion. Illustration of the source data and churn prediction time
period is presented in Figure 4. The division of sets aims to
provide information about the reasonable time horizon after
registration and would the additional data provide value in
customer churn context.

for the prediction of customer churn.
B. Reading habits
One of our research questions was how adaptation of the
service change during the beginning of phase of the service.
For this we calculated information about frequency of visits
for each customer. We also calculated monthly data table for
each customer about the articles viewed. In the service for
each article view information about the channel was saved.
The channel is unique for each piece and describes source

of the content. In Figure 5 examples of the data collected
by channels are presented; the ﬁgure presents data from one
customer. There were 14 different channels in total.
Figure 5. Examples of the derivation of reading habits variables in various
content channels (c1-c14) of one customer.
Based on the reading data and frequency of visits, we
classiﬁed customers to ﬁve activity segments. The ﬁve seg-
ments were formed to give information about the share of
customers registered in a given month which are active after
six months from registration. Out of the ﬁve segments one
included trial users and one passive users. The share of each of
these segments are presented in Figure 6. In Figure 6 is visible
that the share of trial, passive and different types of active
customers remain closely aligned. The customer base can be
assumed to be similar among the customers who registered in
the beginning of 2014.

reading habits and visit frequency. The segments describe how active a set
of customers are after six months from the registration.
C. Customer churn
1) Variables in training and test data: To predict customer
churn we selected 24 variables for each customer. The ag-
gregation of source data was done according to the principle
presented in Figure 4. Table II presents description of the
variables selected. Variables were formulated based on expert
knowledge and available data. We selected only customers with
lifetime over ﬁve days.
For the division of training and test set data, we selected
all active customers and twice as many churners. We assigned

of the churning customers was simply to avoid over estimation
of one class.
In addition to the crisp division between training and test
sets, we applied ﬁve-fold cross validation [21] to the churn
prediction model ﬁt.

CONCLUSION
In this study, service adaptation and customer churn were
analysed. We asked three questions in the study. The initial
hypothesis were made based on visual interpretation of the
data, see Figure 1. For each of these questions, we formulated
suitable metrics and data based support. Classiﬁcaiton and
logistic regression techniques were applied in the analysis.
Based on the ﬁndings, it seems that the user character-
istics and behaviour does not change signiﬁcantly. The so
called early adopters do not have notable differences in usage
behaviour. Thus, we can compare customer behaviour from
different time periods to those of another. The adaptation
overall is tilted towards short customer lifetimes. Majority of
the customers have tried the service and thus we classiﬁed
them as trial users.
As the service was novel at the time of data collection
and the service has non-binding registration, we analysed the
time period for how long it is reasonable to follow inactive
customers. We are aware that all customers are important and
no service provider will cancel any account on their part.
However, as the trial and test users were signiﬁcant population,
for the service provider it is beneﬁcial to have understanding
of the lifetimes of the recently registered customers.
From the prediction results can be seen that the best
results are found in either from the very recent data set or
from the most extensive data set. For our research question,
it is reasonable to conclude that more data produces higher
accuracy for predictions.
A. Future research directions
In this work, churn was deﬁned based on customer activity.
Future research could focus on other systematic methods to
formalize churning customers and active customers. The non-
binding registration is challenging for the service provider as
the exact moment of churn is difﬁcult to detect. However,
as registration already exists, the service development could
beneﬁt from a closer user studies in the future. Another
beneﬁcial direction for the future research could be to include
and research usefulness of other variables.
It is unclear for us how these results can be generalized
over a wider range of services. The churn studies are already
extensive in academic literature. It would be beneﬁcial to
extent and validate these ﬁndings with other databases in other
services. As the churn prediction is usually combined with
customer retention campaign, it would be beneﬁcial to conduct
comprehensive studies with retention campaign and a follow-
up. In [22] is presented directions and ideas how analytics
could beneﬁt the CRM overall.
From the methodology point of view, this study applied
only logistic regression. Future studies may utilize other meth-
ods and scoring variations. For example, decision trees might
provide value and additional information about the source data
and variables. In case the amount of usage data and possibly
the number of users will increase, feature selection methods
could be applied before the classiﬁcation and prediction results
are computed.
