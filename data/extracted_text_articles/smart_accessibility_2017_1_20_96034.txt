Abstract—Google is the most important information provider
on Internet. Within the Google ecosystem, Maps is a relevant
tool, which is used to calculate routes and to find points of
interest. As part of this effort, it has defined Google Transit
Feed Specification (GTFS), a format to specify data of public
transport. Now public transport agents can provide a “feed”
complying with this specification and Google can use them and
represent them on Maps. In spite of their relevance for
accessibility in mobility, Google Maps does not offer detailed
information about accessibility facilities to transit, and GTFS
does not specify the necessary structure to provide that
information about public transport. In this work, we propose
an extension to GTFS to provide relevant data to represent
accessibility elements on Google Maps and similar systems to
offer different social accessibility services.

I. INTRODUCTION
Google says “Discover the world with Google Maps.
Experience 
Street 
View, 
3D 
Mapping, 
turn-by-turn
directions, indoor maps and more across your devices”. But,
what about accessibility information? On December 2016,
the Verge announced that “Google Maps now shows if a
location is wheelchair accessible” [1]. The novelty is that
Google Maps, an app favored by nearly 70 percent of iPhone
users and installed by default in Android, will now list
wheelchair accessibility alongside other information, such as
traffic and store hours. The new addition makes easier for
people with disabilities to use the app; this also applies to
other groups, such as parents with strollers and the elderly.
With regard to the accessibility information provided by
Maps, even with this addition, it is only including wheelchair
accessibility, that is, it just takes into account mobility
disabilities or mobility special needs. And what about other
disabilities? Is it possible to provide accessibility information
to ease the mobility for blind or deaf people? It would be
interesting to offer new social accessibility services to help
people with different needs. In this way, we feel that it is
necessary to express the accessibility information of public
transport in a more detailed way, taking into account that this
information is even more important to impaired people. In
this work, we propose a method to publish such accessibility
data for the public transport. This method has been already
validated against real data for the subway in the city of
Madrid, Spain (METRO Madrid [2]).
Our proposal to specify the accessibility data of public
transport is based on the Identification of Fixed Objects in
Public Transport (IFOPT [3]) standard, which is an extension
of the European Reference Data Model for Public Transport
Information (Transmodel [4]) standard. IFOPT defines a
model for the main fixed objects related to access to Public
Transport, which also includes constructions to describe
accessibility data.
The article is structured as follows: Section 2 describes
the GTFS. Section 3 describes our proposal, specifying the
context of this work, the modification proposal of GTFS and
a case study. In Section 4, the conclusions and future work
are presented.
II.
ACCESSIBILITY IN GOOGLE TRANSIT FEED
SPECIFICATION
GTFS [5] is a format for public transportation schedules
and associated geographic information. A feed of GTFS is a
collection of a maximum of six CSV files, with a .txt
extension. Currently, only two of these files include some
information about accessibility and special needs: stops.txt
and trips.txt.
With regard to the stops.txt file, GTFS defines that “A
stop is a location where vehicles stop to pick up or drop off
passengers. Stops can be grouped together, such as when
there are multiple stops within a single station. This is done
by defining one stop for the station, and defining it as a
parent for all the stops it contains. Stops may also have zone
identifiers, to group them together into zones”. The stops.txt
file includes an optional column named wheelchair_boarding
to indicate accessibility this kind of information about a stop.
GTFS states that “It identifies whether wheelchair boardings
are possible from the specified stop or station. The field can
have the following values:
0 (or empty): Indicates that there is no accessibility
information for the stop.
1: Indicates that at least some vehicles at this stop can
be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair.
2: Wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop”.
GTFS also specifies that “When a stop is part of a larger
station complex, as indicated by a stop with a
parent_station value, the stop's wheelchair_boarding field
has the following additional semantics:

0 
(or 
empty): 
The 
stop 
will 
inherit 
its
wheelchair_boarding value from the parent station, if
specified in the parent.
1: There exists some accessible path from outside the
station to the specific stop / platform.
2: There exists no accessible path from outside the
station to the specific stop/platform”.
With regard to the trips.txt file, GTFS defines that “A
trip represents a journey taken by a vehicle through stops.
So, a single trip represents one journey along a transit line
or route”. This file includes two columns, both optional,
related to accessibility limitations or special needs:
wheelchair_accessible and bikes_allowed. In this work, we
only address accessibility aspects and therefore we will not
discuss the bikes_allowed field. The wheelchair_accessible
field has the following additional semantics:
0 (or empty): Indicates that there is no accessibility
information for the trip.
1: Indicates that the vehicle being used on this particular
trip can accommodate at least one rider in a wheelchair.
2: Indicates that no riders in wheelchairs can be
accommodated on this trip.
In summary, Google Transit Feed Specification only
specifies the accessibility information related to mobility
needs, not taking into account other disabilities. For
instance, we provide a subset of METRO Madrid real data
following GTFS in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1 is a
portion of stops.txt file, which contains data of Sol stop
place. The first line of the file is the header, the second one
shows data about the stop place in Sol (stop_id = est_4_12)
and its wheelchair accessibility (wheelchair_boarding = 1),
that is, “at least some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by
a rider in a wheelchair”. Moreover, as Sol stop place is
located in a larger station complex, the file also specifies a
parent_station value and additional information. For this
reason, the following seven lines describe other stops
associated to Sol (parent_station = est_4_12), and they
inherit its wheelchair_boarding value from the parent station
(wheelchair_boarding = 0).
Figure 2 is a portion of trips.txt file, which contains the
services associated to trips of line 3 (Sol is a stop place in
lines 1, 2 and 3). The first row of the file is the header, next
rows
represent, for each line, the associated service
performing the trip. Each line has an associated value for
wheelchair_accessible (in this case value number 1, that is,
there exists some accessible path from outside to the
specific stop / platform).
These data have been provided by the Regional
Consortium for Public Transports of Madrid (CRTM) [6].
As you can see in previous figures, GTFS only makes
possible to express that Sol stop place is not fully
accessible. It just states that in Sol stop place “at least some
vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a
wheelchair” (motor disability). That is, it is impossible to
describe the needs for people with audible or visual
disabilities, which intend to travel starting or finishing the
trip on Sol stop place.
III. OUR PROPOSAL
A. The Context: CoMobility and Access@City Projects
This work is being developed in the context of two
related research projects: CoMobility and Access@City.
CoMobility [7] defines a multimodal architecture based
on linked open data for a sustainable mobility. Its main
goals are improving the citizen mobility, optimizing their
trips combining public transport and the sharing of private
transport (e.g., car sharing), and also providing a means for
accessible trips.
Access@City is a coordinated project, which defines a
technological framework to process, manage and use open
data about public transport with the goal to promote its
accessibility. Multiply@City is a subproject within it, which
is focused on processing and armonizing accessibility data
of public transport in a semantic way, taking into account
that data is provided by different sources and will have
different formats. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate
accessibility data from open data, together with web
scraping, and accessible routes, obtained by crowsourcing
from the users who use mobile technologies. Figure 3
provides a general depiction of this project.

The Regional Consortium for Public Transports of
Madrid (CRTM) [6], the Madrid public bus company (EMT

an interest in our CoMobility and Access@City projects’
results.
B. Proposal of the GTFS Modification
The intent of our proposal is to improve accessibility
information to support new social accessibility services. We
have then integrated information relevant to blindness,
hearing and mobility impairments and we have included the
following pieces of information:
1) Stops.txt file: We have added two new colums, which
are blindness_accessing and deaf_accessing. The values of
these columns follow the same pattern as the GTFS
specification for the mobility disability:
0 (or empty): There is no accessibility information for
the stop.
1: Indicates that at least some vehicles at this stop can
be boarded by blind (resp. deaf) people.
2: The access for blind or deaf people is not possible at
this stop.
Moreover, GTFS specifies: “When a stop is part of a
larger station complex, as indicated by a stop with a
parent_station value, the values of the blind_accessing and
deaf_accessing have the following additional semantics:
0 (or empty): The stop will inherit its value from the
parent station blind_accessing and deaf_accessing fields, if
specified in the parent.
1: There exists some accessible path for blind or deaf
people from outside the station to the specific stop or
platform.
2: There exists no accessible path for blind or deaf
people from outside the station to the specific stop/platform.
2) Trips.txt file: We have also added two new colums,
which are blind_accessible and deaf_accessible. The values
of these columns follow the same pattern as the GTFS
specificaction. The meanings of these values are:
0 (or empty): Indicates that there is no accessibility
information for the trip
1: Indicates that the vehicle being used on this particular
trip has elements to assist blind or deaf people.
2: Indicates that there are no elements to help blind or
deaf people on this trip.
C. Case Study: Proposed GTFS extension with data of
METRO Madrid
In this subsection we describe the process to represent
the accessibility data of METRO Madrid on Google Maps,
using our proposed extension.
To realize the case study, it was necessary to use real
data of METRO Madrid, namely lines, stations in each line
and their accessibility. METRO Madrid specifies the
accessibility in two different ways. The first one is on the
stations web page. There, the user can determine if a station
is accessible or not by means of icons (e.g., a wheelchair
icon is shown to identify if a station is absolutely accessible,
i.e., it has universal accessibility). The second way is on the
specific accessible stations web page. In that case, METRO
Madrid only indicates the accessible stations for each line.
There are three different types of accessibility:

Universal accessibility (UA): A stop place with UA
indicates that any person should be able to access to
the stop place, regardless of potential disabilities.

Complementary accessibility measures without lifts
and/or ramps (CAM): A stop place with CAM
indicates that there are facilities to simplify the
access of blind or deaf people, but the access of
mobility impaired people could present issues.

Lifts 
and/or 
ramps
without 
complementary
accessibility measures (LAR): A stop place with
LAR indicates that there are facilities to simplify the
access of mobility impaired people, but there are not
special resources for blind or deaf people.
As METRO Madrid does not provide the means for
downloading these data, we used a scraper to determine
which stations are accessible, and their kind of accessibility
in every case. This information was stored as a CSV file.
To integrate this information with previous GTFS data
in the new structure proposed for GTFS, we have defined
the following correspondences (see 0):

Figure 4. New GTFS stops.txt file, including improved accessibility information in the Sol stop place
Following these specifications, we added these new
attribute values to GTFS stops.txt file and trips.txt files.
Figure 4 shows the stops.txt file with the values concerning
the accessibility in the Sol stop place. We have omitted
some fields in the central part of every row with the purpose
of highlighting the additional accessibility fields added,
which are also emphasized. This new accessibility
information could be represented in Google Maps. In Figure
5 we mark the accessibility by means of colours in the Sol
area:
Figure 5. Adding detailed accessibility in Google Maps.
The key box points to the Sol stop place. It is annotated
with three colours: this is done to highlight that universal
accessibility also includes lifts or/and ramps (LAR) and
complementary measures of accessibility (CAM). However,
when a stop place is only marked with dark blue colour, it
has only ramps or/and lifts to access. When a stop place is
only marked with green colour, it has only complementary
measures of accessibility.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Google Maps is probably the most widely used service for
mobility. But currently it does not show the accessibility
elements available in public transport. To represent the
public transport information on the map and to calculate
routes, Google uses the “feeds” (specified in GTFS)
provided by transport companies. Due to the relevance of
accessibility in mobility, we think it is necessary to calculate
accessible routes, and to represent accessibility on Maps. In
this work, we have extended the GTFS specification to
support new social accessibility services.
This extension consists of adding relevant fields in the
stops.txt and trips.txt files. To prove the validity of this
extension, we have used real data of METRO Madrid. After
obtaining
them, we have
identified the accessibility
correspondences between GTFS and METRO Madrid data,
and we added these new values to the stops.txt and trips.txt
files. Next, we have represented them on the map: if a
station has universal accessibility, complementary measures
(for blind and deaf people) or only lifts or/and ramps (for
mobility impairments).
For future work, we intend to provide fully accessible
routes (from a stop to other) using these accessibility data.
