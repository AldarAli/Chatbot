Abstract—Cognitive wireless local area network over fiber
(CWLANoF), which employs remote antenna units (RAUs)
connected to a central cognitive access point through optical
fibres, can provide a cost-effective and efficient architecture for
devices to equally share the industrial, scientific, and medical
band by taking advantage of cognitive radio capabilities. Based
on the CWLANoF architecture, we propose two methods to
reduce collisions among stations, with multiple independent
channels operating at each RAU, and transmitter and receiver
diversity through cooperation of adjacent RAUs. Multi-channel-
operation method is enabled by wide-band optical fibres and
diversity
method
is
enabled
by
distributed
RAUs
in
the
CWLANoF architecture. Extensive simulations show substantial
improvements in Transmission Control Protocol throughput and
packet error rate reduction of constant-bit-rate traffic streams,
especially under dynamic traffic conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are widely used for
connecting computing equipment in homes and offices to the
Internet. Cognitive wireless local area network over fiber
(CWLANoF) is a new architecture [1] that applies advanced
cognitive radio [2] and broadband radio over fiber (RoF) [3]
technologies to infrastructure-based IEEE 802.11 WLAN
Extended Service Sets (ESSs) comprised of multiple access
points (APs), each forming its own Basic Service Set (BSS).
This architecture is intended to provide centralized radio
resource management and access control through cooperative
spectrum sensing.
Since WLANs share the industrial, scientific, and medical
(ISM) band with other independently-operated license-free
devices such as Bluetooth radios and microwave ovens, they
must tolerate interference from these devices. Cognitive radio
techniques have been recently proposed for secondary users to
exploit spectrum holes left unused in licensed frequency bands
by primary users of the allocated spectrum. In this paper, we
exploit
cognitive
radio
techniques
in
the
CWLANoF
architecture for equal access in the license-free ISM band to
enhance
system
performance
via
spectrum
sensing,
interference avoidance and coexistence.
Successful simultaneous transmissions of multiple WLAN
channels over low-cost multi-mode optical fibres [4]-[7] and
clarification
of
WLAN
medium
access
control
(MAC)
operation in RoF structures [8]-[10] motivate the proposal of
CWLANoF as an architecture that offers huge potentials to
increase system capacity and improve quality-of-service. The
ever-decreasing cost of optical fibers and wavelength-division
multiplexing components has resulted in commercial fiber-
based indoor wireless networks being deployed to penetrate
large buildings such as stadiums [11], hospitals [12], business
buildings and shopping malls [13]. It would be expensive to
cover these buildings with cable-based networks due to the
ever-increasing cable cost. It is also difficult to monitor and
manage the radio environment within such large buildings if
antennas cannot be efficiently coordinated. The success of
these
commercial
indoor
wireless
networks
further
demonstrated potential markets for CWLANoF networks.
In this work, we focus on how to reduce access collisions in
a WLAN through methods made possible by the CWLANoF
architecture, which would be difficult if not impossible to
realize in a conventional WLAN.
In a conventional WLAN, each AP performs carrier sensing
independently and only over the channel it operates on. In
contrast, CWLANoF applies cognitive radio techniques to
enable a WLAN ESS to more efficiently utilize the ISM band.
The centralized architecture of CWLANoF systems enables
cooperative sensing and consequently reduces the interference
detection
time
while
improving
the
detection
accuracy.
Moreover, the multi-channel carrying capability of advanced
broadband RoF systems can significantly increase available
radio resources at each WLAN AP. By implementing dynamic
radio resource management based on accurate spectrum
sensing, interference avoidance or mitigation can be easily
accomplished. Effectively, the CWLANoF architecture enables
the new concept of applying cognitive radio techniques for
equal spectrum access in the ISM band.
In a conventional WLAN, each AP has an 802.11 radio
modem and is digitally bridged to the distribution system,
usually an 802.3 Ethernet. In a CWLANoF, radio modems and
bridges in the APs are moved to a centralized unit referred as
the cognitive access point (CogAP); the resulting simplified
APs are now named as remote antenna units (RAUs). RAUs
are connected to the CogAP via analog radio frequency signals
transmitted
over
optical
fibers.

broadband RF signals received from the RAUs, the CogAP has
a complete picture of the radio spectrum usage in the coverage
area of the WLAN ESS. The Distributed Coordinated Function
of 802.11 MAC employing carrier-sensed multiple access with
collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is carried out at the CogAP
instead of at individual APs as in a conventional WLAN. These
changes enable a CWLANoF to more effectively combat
packet collisions that inevitably occur over a random-access
channel. A typical CWLANoF system and the structure of the
CogAP are illustrated in Fig. 1.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review
related work on how to improve WLAN system capacity. In
Section III, two methods are proposed to reduce collisions
among WLAN stations: load balancing to reduce collisions
caused by heavy traffic, and transmitter and receiver diversity
to reduce the effects of collisions. The performance of
proposed methods is evaluated through extensive Monte-Carlo
simulations in Section IV. We conclude by summarizing the
paper and discussing future work in Section V.
II.
RELATED WORK ON WLAN
Much recent research on WLANs aims to increase system
capacity of individual WLAN BSSs, and reduce co-channel
interference (CCI) and adjacent-channel interference (ACI)
among BSSs in WLAN ESSs.
The system capacity of a WLAN BSS can be increased
through three methods: enhancing existing MAC protocols by
either adjusting parameters or adding new MAC flavors to
achieve a higher MAC efficiency, exploiting capture effects,
and introducing multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) to
exploit spatial multiplexing. Enhancing the WLAN MAC
protocol usually requires an update of station hardware or
firmware. We therefore mainly review recent advances on
exploiting capture effects and employing MIMO in WLAN.
The capture effect has been initially studied within the
context of an ALOHA network [14]. It refers to the fact that
when two packets arrive at one station at the same time, the
packet with stronger signal strength will be synchronized and
“captured” by the station. Luo and Ephremides [15] showed
that with the capture effect, system throughput is maximized
when all nodes transmit at maximum power. This conclusion,
however, is based on an optimistic assumption that any packet
can be successfully received as long as it has the highest power
level at the receiver, regardless of how many overlapping
packets are being received at lower power levels. After taking
interference into account, Hadzi-Velkov and Spasenovski
investigated
the
capture
effect
and
its
interaction
with
RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) in 802.11b networks
[16]. Kochut et al. studied the capture effect by comparing
system throughput at the physical and transport layers in
802.11b networks [17]. Their comparisons showed that capture
effect is magnified through variations of contention window
size in the MAC layer and congestion window size in the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) layer. Based on Bianchi's
model [18], WLAN performance is derived in [19] by
considering the capture effect. Capture effect and successive
interference cancellation were later studied in a direct sequence
spread
spectrum
(DSSS)-based
ZigBee
network
[20].

Capture effect in 802.11a networks was studied in
[21][22] through real-world experiments using commercial
WLAN devices. It was shown that with an arrival time
difference of up to 50 µs, the stronger 802.11a packet can
still be captured. Different from previous 802.11b capture
effect studies where the stronger frame has to arrive within
the preamble time of the weaker frame, this observation
suggests that even when the arrival time difference of two
packets is larger than the preamble length of the first packet,
the stronger packet could still be captured. Such phenomena
have been observed in commercial 802.11a/b/g adapters
working in either DSSS mode or orthogonal frequency
division modulation mode.
The capture effect was further exploited in the form of
“message in message” (MIM) to increase system throughput
[23][24]. The AP sends the message with smaller channel
gain first and the message with larger channel gain later such
that the weaker packet’s preamble can be successfully locked
by one recipient and the stronger packet can also be locked
by another recipient. The AP abuses CSMA rule and stations
use delayed ACKs. Using MIM requires the AP to update the
system interference map periodically.
Exploiting diversity in WLAN is classified into micro-
diversity and macro-diversity. The IEEE 802.11n standard is
developed to enable micro-diversity in WLANs using
MIMO. Previous work on macro-diversity includes the
concept of distributed radio bridges proposed in [25] and
their subsequent applications in WLAN [26][27].
A WLAN ESS is a multi-cell WLAN system in which
the WLAN controller assigns channels and sets maximum
AP transmit power to different BSSs to reduce CCI and ACI
among
them.
Sub-optimal
radio
resource
management
algorithms have been extensively studied for this purpose.
These algorithms address three basic problems: channel
allocation across APs [28], user association (or load
balancing) [29], and AP transmit power control [30]. The
conflict set coloring method jointly optimizes channel
allocation and load balancing [31]. Measurement-driven
guidelines in [32] provide a heuristic method to jointly
address the three basic problems. However, due to the
limited number (usually one) of channels that each BSS can
support, these algorithms have limited abilities to handle
dynamic traffic, and become extremely complicated when
channel allocation, load balancing and AP transmit power
control are jointly considered. Authors of [33] investigated
how to coordinate MAC mechanisms across multiple APs in
the ESS by switching from contention-based access to time-
slotted access when the ESS is heavily loaded with audio and
video streams. The MAC switching reduces packet collisions
and thus provides better quality-of-service for multimedia
streams. However, the signaling protocol required by the AP
coordination was not given in [33].
III.
COLLISION REDUCTION
A collision happens when two stations access the channel
at the same time, or when one station fails to sense an on-
going packet transmission due to fading or hidden terminal
problem and starts a new transmission. Based on the
CWLANoF architecture, in this paper we propose a load-
balancing method to reduce collisions caused by heavy
traffic, and a transmitter and receiver diversity method to
reduce the impact of packet collisions by increasing the
chance of successful reception. The two methods used to
reduce collisions in CWLANoF are illustrated in Fig. 2.
A.
Load Balancing Method
A practical load balancing technique facilitated by the
CWLANoF architecture is to distribute the total traffic load
in the frequency domain. The broadband RoF connection
between each RAU and the CogAP allows more than one
channels to be allocated to any RAU. Consider the case of
two RAUs covering a given area: RAU1 operates on the
channel f1 and RAU2 operates on f2. When the collision rate
on f1 is higher than a target threshold, the CogAP can use the
“disassociation” process to force some of the stations to be
dissociated from this channel, while simultaneously sending
beacons on a different channel f3. Stations dissociated from f1
will then have two options. If a dissociated station receives
beacons on channel f2 from RAU2, it can request to associate
with RAU2 on this channel. This effectively transfers a
portion of the traffic load of RAU1 to RAU2, creating a
distributed
load
balancing
solution
among
RAUs.
Alternately, a dissociated station will receive beacons on
channel f3 from RAU1, and request to associate with RAU1
over this channel. In this case, load balancing occurs over the
frequency domain within the same RAU, where a portion of
the traffic at RAU1 is switched from overloaded channel f1 to
channel f3. The second case is particularly made possible by
the broadband RoF connections between RAUs and CogAP.
In contrast, conventional WLAN APs are generally not
equipped for multi-channel operations.

The gain in system throughput in the above example is
two-fold: one from increased MAC efficiency due to
decreased contention among stations accessing the same
channel, and another from the use of three channels instead
of two. We are more interested in the latter owing to its
potential of linearly increasing system throughput. However,
to fairly compare a CWLANoF with a conventional WLAN,
we investigate the worst case where the new channel
assigned to RAU1 is the same as that assigned to RAUs, i.e.,
f2. We shall examine the throughput gain that can be
achieved in the presence of co-channel-interference on f2.
WLAN operations on f1 and f2 can be independent and as
such we refer to this load-balancing method as multiple-
independent-channel-operation. Let us compare a two-AP
conventional WLAN, where AP1 operates on f1 and AP2
operates on f2, with a two-RAU CWLANoF, where RAU1
operates on f1 and f2 and RAU2 operates on f2. We can
certainly focus on the throughput on f2. It is clear that the
CWLANoF provides the worst throughput on f2 when the
spatial frequency re-use is impossible, i.e., when all stations
associated on f2 can perfectly hear each other. We now argue
that even in such a situation, the CWLANoF could provide a
higher
throughout
than
a
conventional
WLAN.
For
simplicity, we only consider downlink traffic. In the
conventional WLAN, AP2 can only send one data packet at a
time.
In
the
CWLANoF
with
RAU1
and
RAU2
independently operated, they might simultaneously send two
data packets on f2. Owing to capture effects, the two packets
may both survive from the collision, thus generating a
throughput gain.
B.
Transmiter and Receiver Diversity Method
Besides operating channels independently, the CogAP
can also manage channels to exploit macro-diversity since
signals received from widely separated RAUs tend to be
uncorrelated. If each RAU is also equipped with multiple
antennas, we can further implement micro-diversity in
conjunction with macro-diversity. However, if we keep the
number of fibers between each RAU and the CogAP the
same, i.e., one to transmit and one to receive, wavelength
division multiplexing would then be required to deliver RF
signals from/to different antennas attached to the same RAU.
Here we focus on macro-diversity enabled by distributed
RAUs.
1)
Receiver Diversity
Consider an area covered with two RAUs, using the same
set of frequencies to serve a group of stations. If maximum-
ratio combining (MRC) is used at the CogAP for uplink
signals, not only do we achieve an array gain of 3 dB due to
the increased receive antenna gain, but also obtain a diversity
gain if the two paths from the station to the two RAUs
experience independent fading. Both gains will help reduce
the effects of packet collisions, resulting in increased
throughput and reduced packet error rate (PER). When the
number of RAUs increases to four, we expect a higher
performance improvement due to 3 dB more in array gain
and a higher diversity gain.
An
immediate
effect
of
receiver
diversity
is
an
improvement in sensing capability at the CogAP, and hence
a reduction in WLAN packet collisions between downlink
packets and uplink packets. Another effect of diversity gain
is to reduce unfairness among stations in terms of their
chances to access the channel due to their different distances
from the RAUs.
2)
Transmitter Diversity
For the downlink, we can use transmitter diversity to
improve signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the stations without
requiring them to have additional capabilities. Multiple
copies of each packet are distributed to RAUs and then to the
destination
such
that
when
some
copies
are
largely
attenuated due to poor channel conditions, other copies can
still reach the destination; hence, transmitter diversity. By
reciprocity of the channel, transmitter diversity at the CogAP
through multiple RAUs achieves the same SNR gain as
receiver diversity, subject to a total transmit power constraint
on all RAUs.
We investigate equal-gain combing (EGC) and MRC
using transmitter diversity. In EGC scheme, each RAU is
subject to a given per-RAU transmit power constraint, which
reduces distortions due to nonlinearity at optical-electrical
converters of RAUs. In MRC scheme, RAUs are only
subject to a total transmission power constraint, and
therefore have a larger freedom on transmission power
allocation across RAUs, providing a larger SNR gain than
EGC.
Both EGC and MRC require that signals from different
RAUs can be added coherently at the receiving station.
Therefore, the CogAP must have exact channel state
information (CSI) from all participating RAUs to the
receiving station right before a packet is sent, such that
signal phases can be properly shifted at the different RAUs.
This makes CSI estimation for transmitter diversity more
difficult than receiver diversity, where the CogAP can
always rely on the physical-layer header of WLAN packets
to estimate CSI.
IV.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
We
utilize
the
NS-2.33
simulator
[34]
with
its
dei80211mr WLAN rate adapter package [35] to evaluate the
performance of the proposed methods. The interference-
recorded channel model incorporated in this package greatly
enhances the accuracy of simulations involving channel
capturing.
A.
Simulation Model
The simulation model includes two RAUs connected to
one CogAP, which is then connected to a fixed host
computer. Stations are either uniformly or non-uniformly
placed in a 30-by-60 m2 area. When no diversity is used, the
CogAP communicates with stations through their closest
RAUs. Traffic streams only flow between stations and the
fixed host. The wireless propagation model is a simplified
pathloss model [36] with shadowing and Rayleigh fading.
The WLAN uses 802.11g and two non-overlapping
channels are used. Each AP in the baseline conventional

WLAN operates on one channel only, while the CogAP in
CWLANoF operates on both channels through the two
RAUs
either
co-operatively
for
macro-diversity
or
independently. Data mode used by each station and the
CogAP is determined by the signal-to-noise-ratio-based
dynamic rate adaptor in dei80211mr package. No RTS/CTS
is used. Perfect CSI is assumed to be available at the CogAP.
The frequency plan used in the simulations is shown in
Fig. 3 and simulation parameters are listed in Table 1. The
synchronization interval (SI) is used to model the capturing
process. When the arrival times of two packets are within the
SI, it is assumed that the receiver is able to synchronize to
the packet with the stronger receive power.
The simulations employ two
types of traffic that
represent increasingly popular Internet applications: File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) over TCP in downlink representing
traffic from file downloading applications, and constant bit-
rate (CBR) traffic in both uplink and downlink representing
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and IP television
(IPTV). FTP over TCP traffic is saturated, i.e., stations
always have packets to send. VoIP and IPTV, as multimedia
traffic, have the same fixed packet interval yet different
packet length due to different amount of information
contained in their packets. We are mainly interested in file
downloading speed and voice and video quality; thus, TCP
downlink throughput and CBR PER are chosen as our main
performance
evaluation
criteria.
To
evaluate
proposed
methods for file sharing applications, we also evaluate TCP
uplink throughput in some simulation scenarios.

Effects of Receiver Diversity
We first investigate the effect of receiver diversity, i.e.,
receiving packets transmitted from one station using more
than one RAU. Assuming the channel gain of each path is
Rayleigh distributed, we know that the received signal power

over the whole area, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the
reduction on the outage probability when MRC or EGC is
used, compared to the case where diversity is not employed.
In both figures the blue surfaces correspond to EGC and the
red ones correspond to MRC. The black surface corresponds
to conventional WLAN in Fig. 4 and serves as the zero-
reference plane in Fig. 5. Results are based on simulations
using parameters in Table 1. Two RAUs (or APs in the
conventional WLAN) are fixed at locations (15, 15) and
(15, 45) in units of meters.
We observe that MRC always reduce outage probabilities
more than EGC, especially for stations at corner areas where
the pathlosses to the two RAUs largely differ. From Fig. 4,
we also observe that compared with EGC, MRC has a flatter
distribution of outage probabilities across the area, so that
stations located farther away from the RAUs will still be
heard by the CogAP. Therefore, their uplink packets will less
likely collide with downlink packets, and consequently their
contention
windows
will
not
suffer
as
much
from
exponential increases. With receiver diversity at the CogAP,
stations farther away from the RAUs still have good chances
to access the channel compared with those closer to the
RAUs.

C.
Spatially Uniformly Distributed Traffic
Stations are uniformly placed over the whole area to
represent spatially uniformly distributed traffic. For a given
number of active stations, 20 different station locations are
randomly generated. Simulated results under these scenarios
are then averaged for evaluations. From Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, we
observe
that
under
two
types
of
spatially
uniformly
distributed traffic, operating two channels in both RAUs
increases TCP throughput by 14%~18% when only 8
stations are active. When the number of active stations
increases, the TCP throughput gain also increases, reaching
36% for VoIP uplink/downlink plus FTP downlink traffic
and 20% for IPTV downlink plus FTP downlink traffic when
the number of active stations is 32. Downlink PER for CBR
traffic is also reduced by 50%. Uplink PER for CBR is zero
and thus not presented here. The reason is that uplink is not
heavily loaded without presence of saturated FTP over TCP
traffic. The performance gain of two-channel-operating can
be attributed to channel capturing effects on downlink data
packets in CWLANoF (see Section III.A).
Note that we use the number of stations to indicate the
intensity of traffic since all of stations have always-on CBR
and FTP/TCP traffic.
The confidence interval of obtained average PERs can be
estimated by berconfint function in MATLAB, provided that
the number of packet errors follows binomial distribution.
Each simulation run lasts 120 seconds with 20 ms packet
interval. Therefore, in 12-station case, 36,000 downlink and
36,000 uplink packets are generated, resulting a 95%
confidence interval [0.93%, 1.08%] at 1% average PER, and
[0.08%, 0.13%] at 0.1% average PER. A higher number of
stations or a higher average PER generates a tighter
confidence interval. To avoid clutter, we do not superpose
the confidence intervals on PER figures.
Comparing the diversity methods we have investigated,
using only MRC for uplink diversity slightly increases TCP
throughput and reduces downlink PER for CBR traffic, while
engaging additionally downlink EGC or MRC transmit
diversity further improves performance by providing a
higher TCP throughput gain and lower PER for CBR traffic.
The results also show that two-channel-operation always
outperforms the diversity methods in either TCP throughout
or downlink PER for CBR traffic. The advantage of multi-

channel operation originates
from additional operation
channels, which can linearly increase system capacity
(assuming no CCI), while diversity methods we investigate
here only logarithmically increase system capacity. When
the always-on VoIP traffic is not present, our simulation
results showed similar TCP throughput gains from both
multi-channel operation and diversity methods. The results
are not presented here to avoid repetition.
As shown in Fig. 8, heavy traffic streams like VoIP
uplink/downlink and FTP uplink/downlink largely increase
CBR
PER.
We
observe
that
diversity
methods
still
consistently improve TCP throughput when the number of
active stations changes. CBR PER, however, is only slightly
affected, and we regard the small difference of CBR PER
between conventional WLAN and diversity methods as
random effects in the simulations. In fact, our simulations
show little difference among diversity methods; therefore,
only MRC-uplink/MRC-downlink method is plotted in the
CBR PER figure to avoid clutter. The two-channel-operation
method improves TCP throughput and outperforms diversity
methods when the number of active stations is less than 10.
When the network contains more than 10 active stations,
TCP throughput of two-channel-operation method decreases
and even becomes worse than conventional WLAN when
there are 24 active stations.
To identify the reason of TCP throughput degradation of
two-channel-operation, we plotted the TCP uplink and
downlink throughput separately in Fig. 9. We observe that
two-channel-operation generates the highest TCP downlink
throughput but the lowest TCP uplink throughput, which
taken together causes the lowest total TCP throughput. To
explain the reason of TCP uplink throughput degradation, we
notice that when two-channel-operation method is used,
stations being served in one channel are found in areas twice
as large as those in the conventional WLAN, and therefore
suffer more packet collisions due to the hidden terminal
problem. The above observation suggests that when there are
too many active stations in the CWLANoF ESS, enough
number of channels should be operated to ensure proper file
sharing efficiency.
Compared with diversity methods and conventional
WLAN, the two-channel-operation method generates the
highest CBR PER when the number of active stations is less
than 12, and the lowest CBR PER when the number of active
stations is larger than 12. This phenomenon is not easy to see
in scenarios under VoIP traffic. To see it more clearly,
observe scenarios under IPTV downlink and FTP downlink
traffic, enlarged in Fig. 10. When two-channel-operation
method is used in lightly loaded networks, CBR PER is
increased because capturing a new packet causes a loss of

previously
being
received
packet;
in
heavily
loaded
networks, however, the reduced packet collisions due to
extra channels outweighs the disadvantage of CBR packet
loss due to channel capturing, causing lower overall CBR
PER than diversity methods and conventional WLAN.
Although two-channel-operation caused a bit higher CBR
PER for uplink packets, CBR PER in downlink is largely
decreased. For VoIP application, such balanced CBR PERs
provided by two-channel-operation would be very useful.
1)
Explanations on the performance improvement
TCP throughput gain and CBR PER reductions of
diversity-based CWLANoF systems come from independent
channel fading and more antennas involved at the receiver or
transmitter. Gains of two-channel-operating CWLANoF
systems come from channel capturing and channel fading
effects. We now further explain where these gains come
from.
Suppose a conventional WLAN ESS serves 10 stations
on channel 1 of AP1 and another 10 stations on channel 2 of
AP2. Assume these stations are associated to the AP closer
to them. Two-channel-operating actually splits the 20
stations into 4 groups, each assigned to one channel through
one RAU. The resulting CWLANoF system can be viewed
as four independently-operated conventional BSSs. Although
CCIs exist between these BSSs, we still gain system capacity
due to the linearly increased bandwidth while the signal-to-
interference-noise ratio is only logarithmically degraded. On
the other hand, a diversity-based CWLANoF controls RAUs
and forms BSSs with distributed antennas, serving stations
that spread out in the whole area.
An intuitive example can observed from Fig.
2:
apparently stations located in the middle of the area will
favor diversity technique since they have similar average
pathlosses to the two RAUs, while stations at corner areas
will favor multiple-independent-channel-operating method
since there will be less CCIs between corners. This
observation reminds us that when the location information of
stations is available at the CogAP, advanced location-aware
channel management techniques can provide even higher
system capacity.
How to achieve a balance between
multiple-independent-channel-operating
method
and
diversity techniques to better serve stations with dynamic
traffic would be our next research topic.
It should be noted that when uplink or downlink diversity
is used, if two or more packets collide, we discard both of
them in simulations. Therefore, the performance shown is
the lower bound of MRC or EGC performance in practice.
And once multi-user reception techniques such as sequential
interference cancellation are applied, diversity could obtain
higher TCP throughput and decrease the CBR PER more.
However, in multi-user access, the MAC layer needs a
careful joint-design with sophisticated signal processing at
the physical layer.
2)
Effects of SI values
Results in [1] only showed scenarios using SI = 5 µs. We
examine effects of different SI values on TCP throughput
under three types of traffic, as shown in Fig. 11. Effects of
SI on CBR PER is very small and thus omitted. Since
different SI values only affect two-channel-operation; only
one diversity method (MRC in uplink and downlink) is
plotted for comparison purpose.
We observe that by using SI = 1432 µs, TCP throughput
can be increased by 5.6%~10% when compared with SI = 5
µs, owning to the fact that larger SI values cause more
packet capturing than smaller SI values. However, we also
notice that there is little difference between SI = 1432 µs and
SI = 100 µs, indicating that by only looking for the strongest
signal during SI = 100 µs, a WLAN receiver can achieve
most of throughput gain due to capture effect. For the rest of
this work, 100 µs is used as SI value.

D.
Spatially Non-uniformly Distributed Traffic
When a hotspot area has much larger traffic demand than
other areas, we face a spatially non-uniformly distributed
traffic. We split the 30-by-60 m2 area into 3-by-6 sub-areas
and place the hotspot into one of these sub-areas to simulate
non-uniformly distributed traffic. Totally 8 stations are used
for background traffic and 4 other stations are placed in
certain hotspot location, as shown in Fig. 12. By geometric
symmetry, we only need study hotspot locations from 1 to 6.
To concentrate on studying the effects of dynamic traffic, we
fix the locations of background-traffic stations at the centers
of sub-areas 2, 4, 6, etc. Stations that generate hotspot traffic
are also fixed in the center part of their respective sub-area.
Only one set of station locations is used for simulations
followed.
As shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14, compared with
conventional WLAN, diversity methods in CWLANoF
achieve 10%~62% higher TCP throughput and two-channel-
operation
achieves
17%~48%
higher
TCP
throughput,
whereas only 14%~36% gain is achieved when the traffic is
spatially uniformly distributed (comparing Fig. 6 to Fig. 8).
CBR
downlink
PER
is
also
largely
reduced.
This
demonstrates CWLANoF’s enhanced capability to handle
dynamic traffic.

Not surprisingly, two-channel-operating achieves a larger
throughput gain when the hotspot is in the corners (e.g.,
location 1), while diversity methods achieve larger gains
when the hotspot is in the overlapping area of RAU1 and
RAU2 (e.g., location 3 and 6). In fact in such areas, MRC in
both uplink and downlink achieves higher TCP throughput
than two-channel-operating when the standard deviation of
shadowing increases to 10 dB.
When the hotspot moves to location 5, stations at the
hotspot are closer to RAU1. Therefore, CCI from stations in
BSS2 to those in BSS1 is less likely due to the capture effect.
Thus, we observe a larger TCP throughput gain in the tow-
channel-operation method, as shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.
Focusing on spatially non-uniformly distributed traffic,
we further study the effects of RAU-distance (i.e., the size of
BSS) and the maximum transmission power of cooperating
RAUs.
1)
Effects of RAU-distance
The RAU-distance is also the physical size of a BSS in
our simulations. Comparing Fig. 15 with Fig. 14, we observe
that both diversity and two-channel-operation methods
provide larger TCP throughput gains when the RAU-distance
is increased to 45 or 60 meters. SNR gains generated by
diversity methods have larger effects on throughput due to
increased
RAU-distance
and
consequently
increased
pathloss. Two-channel-operation method provides higher
throughput
gains
due
to
increased
RAU-distance
and
consequently reduced CCI, especially at hotspot location 5
where stations are less susceptible to CCIs from stations
being served by the neighboring RAU.
2)
Effects of total transmission power constraint of
cooperating RAUs
In previous simulations, the maximum transmission
power of each conventional AP is 10 mW. When MRC or
EGC is employed at an RAU, the maximum transmission
power of each RAU is set as 5 mW for a fair comparison
with conventional WLAN. However, an RAU is covering the
same area as a conventional AP. Therefore, an RAU can
transmit at 10 mW without causing excessive interference to
other ISM devices or health concerns on human bodies.

Effects of RAU-distance and RAU transmission power
constraints should be examined jointly since both parameters
affect system performance by changing SNR at receiver. Our
results in Fig. 16 indicate that for usual office WLAN
deployment (RAU-distance = 30~60 meters), both proposed
methods improve TCP throughput. Compared with diversity
methods subject to normal transmission power constraint,
when
the
RAU-distance
is
small,
increasing
RAU
transmission power constraint has negligible effects on TCP
throughput.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
CWLANoF systems can provide a cost-effective and
efficient method for devices to equally share the ISM band
by taking advantage of cognitive radio capabilities. In this
paper, we have proposed two methods that utilize the
specialized capabilities of the CWLANoF architecture to
improve system capacity by reducing packet collisions
through load balancing and employing diversity to reduce
the effects of packet collisions. By exploiting the wideband
RoF connections between RAUs and the CogAP in a
CWLANoF, multiple-impendent-channel-operation at each
RAU has been proposed to reduce the collision probability in
each channel by moving stations to different channels. By
configuring RAUs as distributed antennas in a CWLANoF,
we have demonstrated the use of macro-diversity to increase
the sensing capability of the CogAP. Simulation results show
that both methods can achieve 14%~18% TCP throughput
gain and 10%~50% CBR PER reductions for spatially
uniform traffic in an IEEE 802.11g network, and up to 62%
TCP throughput gain when hotspots exist. We also studied
effects of different SI values, RAU-distance, and total
transmission power constraint of cooperating RAUs. Similar
TCP throughput gain and CBR PER reduction are observed
in all scenarios.
While the CWLANoF architecture raises a rich set of
research problems, there is one promising direction to further
reduce WLAN packet collisions, using location-aware radio
resource management at the CogAP while employing
collision reduction among stations. By taking advantage of
its centralized signal processing capability, the CogAP can
determine the locations of the stations. Obviously, heavy
traffic from stations located in the overlapping area of RAUs
are better served by applying diversity methods, whereas
stations that do not benefit much from diversity can be off-
loaded to new channels. This strategy is a simple example of
how to dynamically exploit the performance gains between
macro-diversity
and
multiple-independent-channel-
operation. Further research is needed to jointly design signal
processing techniques in physical layer and the MAC in
CWLANoF systems such that multiple collided packets can
be successfully received and acknowledged in time.
