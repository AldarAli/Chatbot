Abstract—We report the strong visible light emission from 
silicon (Si) nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in a Si carbide (SiC) 
film. Compared to Si NC light-emitting diode (LED) by 
employing the Si nitride (SiNx) film as a surrounding matrix, 
the turn-on voltage of the Si NC LED with the SiC film was 
significantly decreased by 4 V. This was attributed to a smaller 
barrier height for injecting the electrons into the Si NCs due to 
a smaller band gap of SiC film than a SiNx film. The 
electroluminescence spectra increase with the forward voltage, 
indicating that the electrons are efficiently injected into the Si 
NCs in the SiC film. The power efficiency of the Si NC LED 
with the SiC film was 1.56 times larger than that of the Si NC 
LED with the SiNx film. The Si NCs in a SiC film show unique 
advantages, and are a promising candidate for application in 
optical devices.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, since the optical band gap of Si NCs can be 
easily tuned by changing the size of NCs due to a quantum 
confinement effect, Si NCs are of particular interest as a 
light-emitting 
diode 
(LED) 
covering 
whole 
visible 
wavelength range [1][2]. Si-rich oxide (SRO) film has been 
generally used as the surrounding matrix to synthesize the Si 
NCs [3][4]. The SRO film, however, has disadvantages in 
the formation of Si NCs as the surrounding matrix due to the 
trapping of the electrons in localized levels in the band gap 
of Si NC, a relatively high annealing temperature (> 1000 
°C), and the high operating voltage (> a few tens of V) 
caused by a large band gap of SRO film (> 9 eV). In our 
previous result [5], well-organized Si NCs in the silicon 
nitride (SiNx) film grown by a plasma enhanced chemical 
vapor deposition (PECVD) at a low temperature (250 °C) 
showed a clear quantum confinement effect depending on 
the size of Si NC, resulting that the band gap of Si NCs could 
be tuned from the near infrared (1.38 eV) to the ultraviolet 
(3.02 eV) range. In addition, we fabricated the mesa-type Si 
NC LED by applying an amorphous silicon carbide (SiC) 
film as an electron injection layer [6][7]. Because SRO and 
SiNx films, however, have a relatively high band gap 
(approximately 9 eV for SRO and 5.3 eV for SiNx, 
respectively), the tunneling probability between Si NCs 
decreases due to a high barrier height, resulting that the high 
operating voltage is required to inject the current into Si 
NCs. In the previous result [7], we have in-situ grown the 
well-organized Si NCs in a SiC matrix by using a PECVD. It 
was found that Si NCs in a SiC film showed a quantum 
confinement effect depending on the size of the Si NCs. In 
this work, we report the strong visible light emission from 
the LEDs by employing the Si NCs in a SiC film. The turn-
on voltage of the Si NC LED was approximately 5 V and 
also decreased by 4 V compared to that of the Si NC LED by 
using Si NCs in SiNx film. In addition, the wall-plug 
efficiency (WPE) was increased by 56 % compared to the Si 
NC LED with a SiNx film.

EXPERIMENTAL 
Si NCs in a SiC film with a thickness of 50 nm were in-
situ grown at 250 ºC by conventional plasma enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Ar-diluted 10 % SiH4 
and CH4 were used as the reactant gases. The plasma power, 
chamber pressure, and substrate temperature for the growth 
were fixed at 5 W, 500 mTorr, and 250 °C, respectively. The 
flow rates of SiH4 and CH4 gases were 60 and 10 sccm, 
respectively. An amorphous SiC layer (~ 10 nm) doped with 
phosphorous, which was used to inject the electrons into the 
Si NCs, was deposited onto Si NC layer at 300 ºC by using a 
PECVD. ITO layer (100 nm) used as a transparent current 
spreading layer was deposited onto n-SiC layer at 150 ºC by 
using a pulsed laser deposition method. The size of Si NC 
LED fabricated was 300 um×300 um. The Si NC LED with 
Si NCs in a SiNx matrix was also fabricated to compare the 
performance. The structure of Si NC LED investigated here 
was ITO (100 nm)/n-SiC (10 nm)/Si NCs in SiC (50 nm)/p+-
Si, as shown in Figure 1(a).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A RT photoluminescence (PL) spectrum taken from the 
Si NCs in a SiC film is shown in Figure 1(b), which is 
centered at ~ 650 nm. The average size of Si NCs into the 
SiC film was ~ 9 nm, which was confirmed by a HRTEM 
[8]. 
The I-V characteristics of Si NC LEDs with SiC and SiNx 
films measured at RT are shown in Figure 2(a), respectively. 
The turn-on voltage of Si NC LED with the SiC matrix was 
decreased by around 4 V compared to that of Si NC LED 
with the SiNx matrix.

NC LED structure with SiNx and SiC films. φb1 and φb2 are the barrier 
height for the SiNx film and the SiC film, respectively. 
The schematic band gap diagram of the Si NC LED 
structure with SiNx and SiC films is shown in Figure 2(b). As 
can be clearly seen in Figure 2(b), the barrier height (φb2) for 
the SiC film is lower than that (φb1) for the SiNx film. The 
barrier height is very crucial to inject the electrons into the Si 
NCs from the transparent current spreading layer. The 
smaller the barrier height, the better the electron injection 
into the Si NCs. As the barrier height decreases, the electrons 
injected into the Si NCs for an external applied voltage to the 
LED can be increased. The electron transport between the Si 
NCs can be, therefore, significantly increased, resulting that 
the electrical performance of Si NC LED can be greatly 
improved. Therefore, lowering the turn-on voltage of Si NC 
LED with a SiC film was attributed to a lower barrier height 
for injecting the electrons into the Si NCs from the 
transparent current spreading layer caused by a lower band 
gap of SiC film (~ 2.5 eV) compared to SiNx film (~ 5.3 eV). 
The electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the Si NC LED 
as a function of forward voltage measured at RT are shown 
in Figure 3(a). We found that both PL (shown in Figure 1(b)) 
and EL showed a similar peak centered at 650 nm. This 
indicates that the PL and EL processes could be related to the 
same origin. Even though the center of EL peak was around 
650 nm, overall EL peak showed the broad spectrum in the 
range of 500 ~ 850 nm. EL intensity was increased with the 
the forward voltage, as shown in Figure 3(a). 
The light output power of Si NC LED with a SiC film as 
a function of the forward voltage is shown in Figure 3(b). 
With increasing the forward voltage, the light output power 
was linearly increased, indicating that the light emission was 
increased as more electrons and holes were injected into the 
Si NCs into a SiC film. The WPE, which means the power 
efficiency (output power/input power), is very important in 
LED applications. Based on the I-V data and light output 
power, the WPE of Si NC LED with a SiC film at 20 mA (~ 
8 V) was estimated to be 1.94×10-9 %. The WPE was 
increased by 56 % compared to the Si NC LED with a SiNx 
film. Inset shows the optical microscope image of light 
emission from the Si NC LED measured at a forward voltage 
of 12 V. As shown in the inset of Figure 3(b), the uniformity 
of light emission was quite good.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
A strong visible electroluminescence from Si NCs 
embedded into a SiC film was demonstrated. Compared to 
the Si NC LED by employing the SiNx film, the electrical 
characteristics of the Si NC LED with the SiC film were 
significantly improved. This was originated from a smaller 
barrier height for injecting the electrons into the Si NCs due 
to a smaller band gap of the SiC film than the SiNx film. 
Moreover, WPE of the Si NC LED with the SiC film was 
enhanced by 56 % compared to that of the Si NC LED with 
the SiNx film. The light emission originated from the Si NCs 
in the SiC film was quite uniform.
