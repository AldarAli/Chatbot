Abstract—To successfully develop IEEE 802.11a based wire-
less mesh network solutions that can achieve the reliability and
capacities required to offer high quality triple play services
the use of multiple radios in each mesh node is essential.
Unfortunately, the co-location of multiple antennas in a single
device leads to a number of interference problems. In this paper
the impact of non-overlapping channel interference in IEEE
802.11a based multi-radio nodes is investigated. A detailed
explanation of the performance decreases and their relation
to radio settings is presented. The primary contribution of
this paper is the discovery of a channel interference effect
which is present over the entire 802.11a frequency space.
This interference appears if two radios are located less than
50 cm from each other and both are attempting to operate
as usual. The results were obtained by conducting exper-
iments in a well planned testbed to produce reliable and
reproducible results. The presented results incorporate multiple
parameters including transmission power, modulation coding
scheme, channel separation and physical layer effects such as
adjacent channel interference, carrier sensing, retransmissions
and packet distortion.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have
become increasingly popular. This is primarily due to the
high level of penetration achieved by Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) as an access technology for end user
devices and the widespread availability of low cost Wireless
Fidelity (WiFi) hardware. Another important factor is that
WiFi operates in the unlicensed Indistrial, Scientiﬁc and
Medical (ISM) radio spectrum, therefore, WMNs based on
this technology can be deployed without requiring the pur-
chase of expensive spectrum licenses. Moreover, the ability
of WMNs to provide last mile communication infrastructure
as a number of use cases such as campus, festival or
conference deployments. This ﬂexibility has driven a number
of interest groups to investigating WMN deploying issues.
As mentioned in the previous published work, [1], in-
terference between two interfaces on the same WMN can
be appear if both antennas are located relatively close to
each other. Interference can still occur even if the well-
known Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) requirements,
as described by Angelakis et al. [2], Nachtigall et al. [3]
and Cheng et al. [4], are fulﬁlled by setting the radios to a
channel separation larger than one.
The focus in the initial work [1] was not to provide
an exact set of data to derive necessary radio and inter-
face parameters such as Transmission Power (TxPower),
Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS) and channel separation,
for a network with reliable and stable links. It was rather
envisaged to go one step further than [2] and [4] to provide
a ﬁrst survey that the channel interference phenomenon is
related to the three parameters TxPower, MCS and channel
separation. Even in comparison to [3], the previous work [1]
showed that focusing solely on antenna separation (distance)
and channel separation does not give enough detail to fully
understand the radio environment. The work presented in
this paper expands on this previously published work with
a more detailed analysis of the evaluation of obtained Re-
ceived Signal Strength (RSS) and Noise Floor (NF) values,
new measurements to address the question whether data
frames or their Acknowledgements (ACKs) are affected by
ACI or Inter-Channel Interference (ICI) and with a more
detailed evaluation and discussion of the obtained measure-
ment results starting to quantify the different investigated
interferences.
As will be described in Section III-A, a testbed environ-
ment was established including scripts to conduct a number
of experiments automatically. These experiments comprised
every relation of TxPower, MCS and channel separation (as
long as some interference could be investigated) for antenna
separations up to 60 cm in 10 cm steps.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The
next Section II provides an overview of related work from
other groups, this is followed by Section III which gives
the detailed description of the experimental setup. Section
IV describes the ACI effect and its use to evaluate the
testbed hardware. Section V presents experimental results
which investigates the relationship of RSS and Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR), the ICI as well as the relationship
of Re-Transmission Rates (RTRs), Carrier Sense (CS) and
application layer losses. The paper is then concluded in
Section VI which summarises the paper.

II. RELATED WORK
In recent years the ACI effect has been well investigated
by different independent researchers. However, no work
appears to have been done for channel separations of more
than one; this paper aims at addressing this shortcoming.
Angelakis et al. [2] qualiﬁed the effect of ACI in terms
of throughput measurements within a single node equipped
with multiple interfaces. In this paper the authors developed
a mathematical model which showed that neighbouring
802.11a channels have a spectral overlap which produces
a signiﬁcant level of interference that can lead to lossy and
unstable links in dual-radio equipped nodes. However, their
experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions
using attenuators and couplers to demonstrate the ACI effect.
Due to this experimental environment the ACI effect on two
transmitters with a channel separation of two could not be
shown. The reason for this was based on the strength of the
attenuators which they used. The level of these attenuators
was too high and the transmit signal level was below the
sensitivity threshold of a common WiFi card. Therefore,
based on the obtained results it was not possible to conclude
what level of channel separation is required to provide stable
and reliable links. Even in their subsequent papers [5] and
[6] this issue has not been investigated further.
Mishra et al. [7] assumed that the overlap between
neighbouring channels in 802.11a is so low that it can
be ignored for practical purposes. The authors conducted
experiments for an 802.11b link and a channel separation of
three which represents two orthogonal channel as 802.11a
does. They did not observe any interference by measuring
the throughput for a distance of 10 m. Additionally, Mishra
et al. deﬁned an appropriate model for partially overlapping
channels which calculates the level of interference caused by
all non-orthogonal channels, as they appear in 802.11b/g.
However, just measuring the throughput is not sufﬁcient
to conclude that there is no interference in cases where
both radios are located closer than 10 m to each other. The
assumption of Mishra et al. that the only interference is due
to small partially overlapping channels of 802.11a does not
hold for distances below 30 cm, as will be shown later in
this paper.
This can easily be veriﬁed by previously published work,
such as [2] [3] [4], which investigated that ACI issues
must be taken into account when conducting multi-radio
measurements with Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) 802.11a hardware. One of the most im-
portant pieces of work in relation to this issue are the
results of Nachtigall et al. [3]. They demonstrated that the
number of available non-interfering channels depends on
both the antenna separation and the Physical Layer (PHY)
modulation for a dual-radio scenario. They also stated that
under their conditions only one channel can be used at the
same time, which is not necessarily true.
In order to verify the testbed and provide reproducible
results, Burchﬁeld et al. [8] proposed three necessary steps
based on an extended set of experiments in a real envi-
ronment as well as under laboratory conditions using coax
cables. In summary they recommend to check ﬁrst for
external networks using the same Medium Access Control
(MAC) protocol. Secondly, the medium should be checked
also for other interference which cannot be recognized by
the chipset but still senses the medium, e.g., a microwave in
case of deploying a 802.11b/g testbed. Finally, Burchﬁeld
et al. recommends the use a coaxial setup to verify the
system’s capabilities. However, a statistical evaluation after
conducting the experiment seems to be another much more
reliable step in terms of proving the mean values than
conﬁrm the experimental obtained graphs by replacing the
wireless links with coax cable. To verify the claim by
Burchﬁeld et al. similar coax experiments were conducted.
The results showed that even if both antenna outputs were
connected via coax cable with each other it was possible
to see regular beacons sent from another Access Point (AP)
which was located approximately 30 m away. Hence, the
proposed veriﬁcation by Burchﬁeld et al. using coax cables
does not seem to be 100 % accurate.
The most promising work was done by Nachtigall et al.
[3] who investigated the interference among the interfaces
of a multi-radio node and found that the radios located
close to each other interfere with each other signiﬁcantly.
They even stated that under their experimental conditions,
an antenna separation of 15 cm, only one channel within the
entire 5.2 GHz band can be used at the same time. They
concluded their work with the statement that the number
of available orthogonal channels depends on the antenna
separation and MCS.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
This section provides a detailed conﬁguration descrip-
tion of the experimental environment; it also provides an
overview of how the logged data was processed. It also
shows how the measurement process was designed in terms
of duration and conﬁguration using prior statistical evalu-
ation, for example the method of independent replications.
The use of the Fresnel formula to design the links properly
is also described.
A. Testbed Conﬁguration
The most important factor when planning the experimen-
tal testbed was to provide reliable and reproducible results
with the least number of external dependencies as possible.
To achieve this goal the testbed was deployed as shown in
Figure 1.
All three machines (Node A, B and C) were x86 Intel
based desktop machines running Ubuntu 32 bit server edition
and kernel version 2.6.28. Node A was equipped with two
wireless interfaces and both Node B and Node C each had

Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) since it has
no inherent congestion control mechanisms which would
compensate for link degradation and hence distort the re-
sults. The UDP payload size for each experiment was set to
a ﬁxed value of 1400 octets at all times.
As recommended by Burchﬁeld et al. [8], any research
carried out in the 802.11 domain that is based on obtaining
results from real deployments should be performed using
their recommendations. To follow this approach, it can be
conﬁrmed that the room in which the experiments were
conducted was free of any interference in the measured ISM
band. This was veriﬁed in two ways; ﬁrstly by snifﬁng the
medium for other WiFi radios. Secondly, in order to verify
that there was little or no interference from non WiFi devices
experiments were performed in which a single link between
two 802.11 radios was set up. These experiments showed
that the maximum possible UDP data rate without an RTRs
could be achieved, thereby showing that there was no sig-
niﬁcant level of interference. However, the recommendation
of Burchﬁeld et al. [8] that veriﬁcation of the testbed be
carried out using coax cables between the radios was not
conducted, as described in Section II.
B. Statistical Evaluation
In order to prove the reliability of the measured results
the Conﬁdence Interval (CI) was calculated for each sample
mean using the method of independent replications, as
described by Banks et al. [12]. This is shown in Equation
1 where ¯µ represents the sample mean, υ the Degree of
Freedom (DF), α the chosen CI and σ(¯µ) the standard error
or variance of the sample mean.
¯µ ± t (1−α)
2
,υ · σ(¯µ)
(1)
As proposed by Banks et al., the Student’s t-distribution was
used to deﬁne υ; this is because every measured sample
is independent and the common Gaussian distribution does
not cover this case accurately. Since every measurement
represents a set of non-normal data the number of samples
used to calculate the sample mean and the corresponding CI
should be at least 50 as recommended in Wang [13]. Hence,
to calculate the throughput sample mean each measurement
was performed over a period of 50 s with an interval of
0.5 s which gives a set of 100 values for the IPerf results.
The corresponding DF of υ = 1.99 can be derived for a
probability of 5 % to exceed the critical value. Further mean
values, e.g., RSS and NF, were taken directly from the
radiotap header which appears per MAC frame and results in
a DF of υ = 1.96 for total number of independent measured
values above 100 per sample mean and the probability of
exceeding the critical value.
C. Fresnel-Zone and Free Space Path Loss

that the experimental environment had to fulﬁl some basic
requirements. To achieve this there must be a direct Line of
Sight (LOS) connection between each pair of transmitting
and receiving antennas with no obstructions in the path
which could cause inference due to reﬂections or shadowing
effects. At a minimum the ﬁrst Fresnel zone must be largely
free from obstacles to avoid interference from reﬂected
waves.
Equation 3 shows the simpliﬁed formula to calculate
the nth Fresnel. Using this equation a radius Fn can be
obtained which describes a zone that surrounds the direct
LOS connection between both antennas that is completely
free from obstacles, e.g., trees, hills or walls. Since in the
experimental environment the only obstacle is the ground,
Equation 3 just comprises the distance d between both
antennas and is used to calculate the minimum antenna
height such that the ﬁrst Fresnel zone is clear. Therefore,
the general simpliﬁed Fresnel formula is:
Fn

To verify the accuracy of the results from the experimental
environment the overall system loss aS was computed
analytically. A comparison between the actual attenuation
experienced in the experimental set-up and the theoretical
attenuation predicted was then made. To compute the theo-
retical attenuation that should be experienced, the following
formula was used:
aS
=
aL1 − g1 + FSPL + aZ − g2 + aL2
(4)
Equation 4 is made up of the cable losses from Mesh Node
(MN)1 to antenna aL1 and from MN2 to antenna aL2, the
gain of both antennas g1 and g2, the free space path loss
described as
FSPL
=
92.4 + 20 log(d) + 20 log(f)
(5)
and some additional unpredictable losses aZ, as depicted in
Figure 2. Examples for unpredictable losses are interferences
due to multipath propagation especially for frequencies less
than 10 GHz and losses due to atmospheric absorption.

IV. ADJACENT CHANNEL INTERFERENCE IN
MULTI-RADIO NODES
There is currently a lot of interest in both the industrial
and academic research communities for using IEEE 802.11a
to provide backbone links for WMNs while simultaneously
using IEEE 802.11b/g to provide user access. This means
that each MN may have multiple 802.11a radios operating
in close proximity and hence ACI issues in 802.11a are of
particular importance.
Another important factor is the relatively short spacings
that can be achieved between co-located antennas. It is
simply not feasible to have antenna separations larger than
50 or 60 cm due to the dimensions of the MN casings and the
goal of having non-intrusive and easily deployed MNs. For
example it is not possible to have antenna separations of 2 m
as proposed by Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
Access (WiMAX) deployment guidelines. The cumulative
effect of both ACI and small antenna separations can have
a signiﬁcant affect on the performance of such systems and
these issues must be addressed prior to deploying an 802.11a
based WMN infrastructure. For this reason, the spectrum
mask of the WiFi cards used in the work was examined to
verify that it meets with the IEEE guidelines [14]. Figure 3
depicts the measured spectrum of a MikroTik R52 mini-PCI
WiFi card. These measurements were performed using the
IEEE recommended guidelines for spectrum measurements
of 802.11a systems; speciﬁcally the spectrum analyser was
set with a 100kHz Resolution Bandwidth (RBW) and a
30kHz Video Bandwidth (VBW) [14].
Although, Cheng et al. [4] had previously conducted this
spectrum analysis, they considered a spectrum mask that
should not exceed -20 dB at 11 MHz and -30 dB at 22 MHz.
Furthermore, Cheng et al. stated that they used TxPower
values of 30 dBm, 36 dBm and 99 dBm which were allegedly
performed using the MADWiFi driver. Since the consid-
ered Power Spectral Density (PSD) limits and the chosen
TxPower values do not ﬁt to IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b or
802.11g speciﬁcations, the work and results obtained cannot
be considered accurate. For operating in the 802.11a band
the IEEE recommend a 20 MHz channel spacing, a maximal
bandwidth of 18 MHz at 0 dBr and offsets of at least -20 dBr
at 11 MHz, -28 dBr at 20 MHz, and -40 dBr at 30 MHz.
Figure 3 depicts the measured PSD of the WiFi cards used
for the experiments presented in this work. To accurately
compare each of the different TxPower curves, the area
around the centre frequency fc of 5.2 GHz was normalised
to RSSN = 0. Therefore, for every TxPower curve the
sample mean ¯µa between 5.191 GHz and 5.209 GHz was
calculated and then added as a ﬁxed value to the series of
measurements. After applying the mean value to the whole
curve the new mean value for the range between 5.191GHz
and 5.209GHz was consistently above zero. To adjust the
normalisation process to the correct mean value that will

Due to the small SNR values of the lower TxPower mea-
surements, as shown in Figure 3, the PSDs for fc ±
[9 MHz, 11 MHz] could not be obtained as their values
were already equal to or less than the noise ﬂoor. However,
based on the obtained results shown in Figure 3 it is
reasonable to say that the MikroTik R52 WiFi cards meets
with the requirements of the IEEE guidelines.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents and describes results obtained from
experiments performed on the experimental testbed de-
scribed earlier.
A. Received Signal Strength and Noise Floor Level Mea-
surements
In 802.11 the term Received Signal Strength Indicator
(RSSI) is used as a generic unitless signal strength metric
and is the only value used to describe the signal strength
of a received packet. The RSSI is an arbitrary indication of
the actual RSS with a range that is deﬁned by each vendor
individually depending on the level of granularity required.
The lowest possible value is 0 and goes up to the highest
arbitrary value (e.g. 70 for MADWiFi).
An RSSI of 0 always represents the NF inside the radio.
To calculate the actual RSSI value MADWiFi takes the
RSS value from the card and adds 96 dB (NF) to it. This
corresponds to a maximal RSS of -26 dBm for MADWiFi
since this value is equal to an RSSI of 70. In order to easily
compare the RSS and CS threshold, and to be able to make
accurate assumptions about the card and driver behaviour
related to the signal strength, it is essential to use the RSS
instead of the RSSI. However, caution must be taken when
focusing solely on the RSS, as explained below.

Received Signal Strength and Noise Floor for a Radio With
Constant TxPower and an Additional Interferer
Each WiFi chipset has an internal adaptation mechanism
which adapts the noise ﬂoor level in response to the level
of external interference. Speciﬁcally, the higher the level
of interference, the lower the reported NF. It should be
noted that this relationship is not linear and appears to use
predeﬁned thresholds which are set inside the chipset and
are used to adapt the NF. This effect is depicted in Figure
4. It shows two radios placed at a distance of 10 cm from
each other. The TxPower of the ﬁrst radio is ﬁxed while the
TxPower of the second is incremented from 0 to 15 dBm.
In Figure 4 the x axis shows the TxPower of A1 as it
increases, whereas the y axis depicts the RSS (upper surface
with constant lines) measured by interface A2 with a ﬁxed
TxPower as well as its NF (lower surface with dotted lines).
From this Figure it is clear that both surfaces are equal. In
particular, when the neighbouring interface A1 increased its
power from 3 dBm to 4 dBm the measured RSS and NF at
radio A2 in C1 decreased by 12 dB.
Since the TxPower of A2 was set at a ﬁxed value of
15 dBm for the entire duration of the experiment, the drop in
RSS is quite unexpected. Indeed it was assumed that it would
report the same RSS for every received packet with only
a small and relatively insigniﬁcant difference in Standard
Deviation (StdDev). To investigate this issue in more detail
the SNR, as given in Equation 7, for both transmissions is
calculated as depicted in Figure 5.
SNR
=
RSSm − NFLm
(7)
As in the previous Figures the constant surface describes the
radio interface sending with a ﬁxed TxPower and the dotted
line represents the radio which incrementally increased its
TxPower. It is clear from Figure 5 that the SNR of the
connection −−−→
A2 C1 is constant over the entire measurement
space. As expected the SNR surface of the connection
−−−→
A1 B1 increases incrementally as the TxPower of the sending
interface A1 is increased.
The relationship between the measured RSS and NF to
the actual RSS can be described as:

B. Conducted Measurements
As already shown in the previously published work [1],
there are interference issues between neighbouring anten-
nas beyond a channel separation of one. This was one
of the main contributions of Robitzsch et al. and due to
the importance of the problem this has been investigated
further in this work. The presented results within this
paper however just incorporates TxPower settings. Since
the distance between every transmitter and receiver were
ﬁxed, both values, TxPower and RSS, are interchangeable.
Additionally, throughput measurements are known to give a
good indication of how well a link operates. However, they
do not tell the whole story if they are evaluated without any
further measured parameter such as RTR or application layer
loss.
To discover the reason the maximum theoretical through-
put cannot reached in some cases other metrics must also
be considered to investigate possible sources of interference.
In particular, the parameters RTR, MAC layer loss and
application layer loss give a more detailed view of why
the maximum throughput was not achieved. The importance
of the additional metrics will become clearer after this
section when a detailed description of the obtained graphs
is provided. For instance, if the throughput of a connection
is always 60 % lower than expected the question is whether
this is due to RTRs caused by interference or whether the
card backed-off a large number of times. Additionally, the
relation between the MCS to the inlevel of interference gives
a strong indication as well whether this MCS is suitable
under these conditions and provides enough robustness.
Figure 6 to Figure 13 show a complete set of throughput
measurements for an antenna separation of 20 cm including
the corresponding RTRs which gives an indication of the
weak link performance. As can be seen in Figure 7, radio
A2 was transmitting with a constant TxPower of 15 dBm
on channel 36, whereas the TxPower of interface A1 was
70
International Journal on Advances in Internet Technology, vol 3 no 1 & 2, year 2010, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/

increased incrementally from 0 dBm up to 15 dBm on chan-
nel 40. To make a comparison between the different results
easier, the surface of interface A2 (ﬁxed power surface and
channel 36) was mapped to the corresponding TxPower
settings of A1. For instance, if A1 (channel 40) was operating
with TxPower 5 the corresponding measured throughput
value for A2 was mapped to the same TxPower on the x-
axis, however, A2 was still sending with 15 dBm.
From Figure 6 it can be seen that once A1 has reached a
TxPower of 2 dBm both radios achieve the same throughput.
This could indicate that both radios are fairly sharing the
medium as if only a single channel is being used; this
occurs because the side-band from each causes the carrier
sensing mechanism in the neighbouring interface to detect
the channel as busy due to ACI. It could also indicate that
the PSD of the side-band from each is not high enough to
cause CS in the other radio but rather that there is large
number of RTRs due to corrupted received frames in either
B1, C1 or in both. To ﬁnd the source of this problem the
aggregated throughput is depicted in Figure 14. This shows
that a throughput value of 42 Mbps for a channel separation
of one and a PHY rate of 54 Mbps is achieved. This value
is close to the maximum possible throughput for a single
channel when using UDP and the highest MAC Service Data
Unit (MSDU) size.
The RTR in Figure 7 is always around 10 % which
indicates that there are quite high levels of interference. This
interference causes a reduction in the maximum possible
throughput of approximately 3 Mbps. Additionally, it can be
conﬁrmed that in these experiments the application layer
loss was always close to zero which indicates that there
was a small number of expired retransmissions. Combined
these results show that it is not only the card’s internal CS
mechanism that causes ACI in terms of less successfully
transmitted packets, but also distortion of the transmitted
packets from the neighbouring radio sending a packet after
the CS mechanism detected the medium to be idle. This
claim can be veriﬁed by the previous work of Angelakis
et al. who show the impact of the sideband of a 802.11a
20 MHz wide OFDM carrier, which can cause ACI if the
antennas are located quite close, e.g., 20 cm. However,
whether it was the data packet or the ACK frame that was
affected by the interference cannot be obtained from this set
of results. This will be examined in the next Section V-C.
It was expected that by increasing the channel separation
by one the ACI effect would no longer be present and
that the maximum expected throughput should be achieved
on each channel. However, as shown in Figure 8, this is
surprisingly not the case. In comparison to the previous
Figure 6 both surfaces have less variation as if a low pass
ﬁlter had been applied. However, as the TxPower of A1 is
increased the throughput of A2 decreases signiﬁcantly and
when a TxPower of 8 dBm is reached both surfaces are very
similar.

Retransmission Rate for Channel Separation of 1 and Antenna
Separation of 20 cm
The aggregated throughput in Figure 14 conﬁrms that
Tagg is still signiﬁcantly lower than double the maximum
throughput of a single channel that would be expected when
using two independent non-interfering channels. However,
the throughput value for the highest TxPower and MCS
reaches 47 Mbps which is just slightly above the theoretical
maximum throughput of a single connection. The corre-
sponding RTRs for this experiment, as depicted in Figure 9,
indicates that after the TxPower value of 8 dBm is reached
the RTR drops to almost 0 %; however, only for interface
A1 which increased its TxPower. Furthermore, interface A2
always sent packets without requiring any retransmissions,
except when the 64-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (64-
QAM) MCSs was used (i.e. 48 Mbps and 54 Mbps where
the RTR goes up to 1 %). Hence, this shows that after
reaching a speciﬁc ratio between a radio’s TxPower and its
neighbouring TxPower there is no longer interference from
the neighbouring radio; there is however interference from
an as yet uninvestigated source.
The channel separation was then increased to three, the
corresponding throughput and RTR values are presented in
Figures 10 and 11, respectively. As can be clearly derived
from Figure 10, the performance of the link −−−→
A2 C1 is no
longer signiﬁcantly affected by the neighbouring connection

A1 B1. However, as shown in Figure 14 the expected total

aggregated throughput is still not achieved. Rather an aggre-
gated throughput of 62 Mbps with a TxPower of 15 dBm and
a PHY rate of 54 Mbps is obtained. Taking the corresponding
RTRs into account from Figure 11 it can be seen that there
is still interference from A2 in A1 which causes packet
distortion reﬂected by the high RTR of the link −−−→
A1 B1. Once
A1 was conﬁgured with a TxPower of 13 dBm both links
share the medium equally but still with a low aggregated
throughput.
Since both sending interfaces still interfere with each other

maximum, the channel separation was increased to four with
A2 operating on channel 36 and A1 on channel 52. From the
corresponding throughput and RTR results shown in Figures
12 and 13 respectively, it can be seen that both links no
longer signiﬁcantly affect each other and that the aggregated
throughput is now almost twice the throughput of a single
connection, as depicted in Figure 14.

36-60 and 36-64, respectively, are illustrated in Figure 14.
As can be seen from these results, the aggregated throughput
is always equal to twice the throughput of a single 802.11a
UDP connection.
As mentioned earlier, experiments were conducted for
an antenna separation of 20 cm; however a full set of
experiments were also performed for the 10 cm case. Un-
fortunately, the stability and reliability of the links were
extremely poor meaning that the obtained results were
extremely difﬁcult to interpret. As can be seen in Figure
15 the obtained results are however good enough to show
the same general trends as seen in the 20 cm case. It
can be argued that under these conditions the higher the
channel separation, the better the aggregated throughput
of the system. However, only when a channel separation
of seven is reached - which means using channel 36 and
64 - does the aggregate throughput Tagg reach twice the
throughput of a single UDP transmission. This shows that
there are other signiﬁcant factors to be considered other than
just the side-band of a 20 MHz channel, as the side-band
will only impact the adjacent channels. In order to explain
these results it is assumed that each 802.11a chipset produces
some interference over the entire 802.11 frequency spectrum
that smoothely ﬂattens out at higher channel separations to
the frequency the adjacent radio is operating on.
Results for an antenna separation of 30 cm showing Tagg
for a TxPower of 15 dBm are presented in Figure 16. As

depicted, when a channel separation of two is used the
aggregate throughput achieved is equal to twice the possible
throughput of a single 802.11a UDP link; this indicates that
there is no more interference from the neighbouring radio
as was the case for channel separations from four to seven
in the 20 cm case (Figure 14).
C. Retransmissions, Carrier Sensing and Application Layer
Loss
As shown in the previous Section V-B, under certain
conditions two neighbouring transmitting radios can cause
CS, RTRs and packet distortion. This was shown to be due
to the effect of a high RTR which leads to a throughput de-
crease; however it is still not clear whether it is because the
transmitted packet or the ACK was destroyed. To investigate

this issue further another experiment was conducted.
The same experimental environment as described in Sec-
tion III-A was used, except in this case the channel con-
ﬁguration was changed to −−−→
A2 C1 on channel 52 and −−−→
A2 C1
on channel 64. The direction of link −−−→
A2 C1 was reversed
to −−−→
C1 A2. Later on the term Transmission-Receiving (TxRx)
will refer to the reversed testbed setting and Transmission-
Transmission (TxTx) to the settings where both neighbour-
ing antennas are transmitting data. Note, that for the sake
of simplicity only TxPower values of 1, 8 and 15 dBm
were considered for interface A1. Furthermore, the No
Acknowledgement (NoAck) policy of the MADWiFi driver
was used to force the card to send and not wait for ACKs.
Taking these settings and recording a log of the application
layer loss provided by IPerf, it was possible to investigate
whether the actual sent packet was destroyed or the returning
ACK (in the cases where the RTR was between 5 to 10 %).
To answer this question, Figure 19 and Figure 20 were
produced which depict the logged data for the throughput
of a TxRx use case where B1 and A2 were the transmitters
and the corresponding application loss chart, respectively.
With regard to the sent ACKs in the experiments described
in the previous section, it can be clearly seen from both
Figures that these management packets from B1 to A1 are
not destroyed by the neighbouring antenna A2 for any of
the TxPower settings in A2. This can be seen in Figure 19
where the throughput is equal to that of a single connection
with no interference for the lowest MCS. Furthermore, the
application loss presented in Figure 20 shows no losses
at all for channel 52. Additionally, it can be seen that if
both connections use the same TxPower of 15 dBm that
by using 64-QAM with both Coding Rates (CRs) 2/3 and
3/4 A1 destroys close to 80 % of the sent packets of C1
to A2. What has still not been investigated so far is the
question whether both radios affect the data packets sent
by the neighbouring interface for higher channel separations
than one. In order to do so further experiments have been
conducted. Figure 21 shows the chart for a TxTx set-up
where A2 again stays constant at a TxPower of 15 dBm

and A1 changes its TxPower to 1, 8 and 15 dBm. Taking
the corresponding application loss Figure 22 into account,
it is worth noting that as A1 increases its TxPower it got
more often access to the medium which leads to a higher
throughput. At the same time the throughput of A2 drops
down to the same level as A1 when both operating with the
same TxPower. Therefore, they consequentially share the
medium equally over all TxPowers, as depicted in Figure
23 which shows the aggregated throughput. That no packet
was destroyed on either A1’s or A2 side can be conﬁrmed
by taking the application loss, as depicted in Figure 22. It
is clearly observable from this ﬁgure that almost no packet
was affected except for the case where A1 sent at 1 dBm
and with MCS 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-
QAM). However, it can be conﬁrmed that by switching to
64-QAM there was no throughput value logged at all by
IPerf. Therefore, both MCSs 16-QAM and 64-QAM are
not robust enough to not get affected by the neighbouring
interface if the neighbour’s Equivalent Isotropically Radiated
Power (EIRP) is much high than the outgoing power from
the own antenna. Since the previous provided aggregated
throughput Figures 15 to 18 show solely TxPowers of
15 dBm this application loss for 16-QAM and 64-QAM
MCSs can be ignored.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The use of multiple radio equipped nodes within a WMN
is the most promising approach for signiﬁcantly increasing
network performance.
A key problem with this approach however, is that antenna
separations of less than 50 cm have a signiﬁcant impact
on the performance which can be achieved. The presented
work here shows that it is not only ACI which has an
impact but also ICI (channel separations of more than one).
This problem does not appear to have been investigated
previously and is the primary contribution of this paper.
The results were obtained based on experiments per-
formed in a real testbed environment which was evaluated
to produce reliable and reproducible results. This evaluation
used CIs calculations and prior ofﬂine planning by using
the Fresnel formula and statistical methods to design the
testbed. The results presented show that by increasing the
channel separation between co-located radios that the level
of ICI decreases. All presented results take the radio param-
eters TxPower, MCS, channel separation and physical layer
effects into account to explain the performance degradation
due to carrier sensing, packet distortion and backing-off.
The results obtained will be used to develop an algorithm
that takes the radio parameter settings, external dependencies
and some prior knowledge as an input and provides the
optimal global conﬁguration of nodes in a WMN so that
ICI will be minimised.
