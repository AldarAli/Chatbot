Abstract — Sensors are changing the way people live and  
considerable efforts are under way for their integration into 
daily devices. Recently, much attention has been given to 
sensor fields for flexible and printed electronics. Among all the 
processes, ultrasonic spray deposition is a simple and precise 
technique giving enormous potential for applications with low 
cost production, low waste of material and thin film 
uniformity. In this work, we are focusing on Zinc Oxide 
nanoparticles deposited by ultrasonic spray on a flexible 
substrate as sensitive layer for air quality monitoring. The 
flexible platform consists of Ti/Pt interdigitated electrodes for 
gas detection and a micro-heater device, both on Kapton HN 
substrate. A brief description of the process steps will be 
provided. Gas sensing properties have been investigated and 
the flexible sensors present repeatable responses toward 
ammonia (NH3) and ozone (O3) with fast responses and 
recovery times in a wide range of gas concentrations. The 
optimum 
working 
temperatures 
were 
experimentally 
determined at 300 °C for NH3 and 200 C° for O3. Overall, this 
work highlights the ultrasonic spray potential for fast 
processing flexible gas sensors based on zinc oxide solution.

 INTRODUCTION  
The market for printed, flexible and organic electronics 
is growing exponentially with huge potential and new 
applications in our daily life. New sensors are emerging in 
various applications, and the fabrication techniques could be 
key to reach some benefits such as improved performance, 
flexibility, 
transparency, 
reliability, 
and 
better 
environmental credentials. Ultrasonic spray deposition is a 
good candidate to fabricate thin film at a lower cost in a 
large area with low material waste avoiding expensive 
chemical solutions and high temperatures, which are not 
suitable 
with 
flexible 
substrates 
[1][2]. 
Moreover, 
“ultrasonic technology nozzle-less” delivers a thinner and 
more precise coating application than conventional spray 
nozzles, film coaters, roll coaters, and jetting technology.  
In this work, ZnO nanoparticle films were deposited by 
ultrasonic spray nozzle–less on DuPontTM Kapton HN 
polyimide substrate using ink solution from Genes’Ink 
company 
(reference 
ZnO5F12). 
The 
interdigitated 
electrodes and the micro–heater device were fabricated 
using photolithography [3]. In Section II, the sensor process 
will be described and the results will be discussed in Section 
III.

DESCRIPTION OF APPROACH AND TECHNIQUES  
Our flexible gas sensor consists of a 75µm thin Kapton 
polyimide film, with Ti/Pt interdigitated electrodes for gas 
detection, and a Ti/Pt micro-heater device allowing an 
efficient control of temperature, useful for detection of 
gases. Kapton polyimide film presents the advantage of 
working up to 400 °C with an excellent thermal stability. 
Furthermore, it is solvent resistant and flexible. The metal 
electrodes Ti/Pt were deposited by magnetron sputtering 
with thicknesses of 5 nm and 100 nm, respectively. In this 
work, ZnO nanoparticles were used as sensitive material 
with a thickness of 100 nm deposited by ultrasonic spray. It 
is a simple technique ideal for the thin and uniform 
application of several materials with low viscosity. 
Furthermore, it ensures very little waste of coating material. 
The deposition was done with a programmable nozzle–less 
spray machine Prism BT Benchtop X-Y-Z Coating System 
from Ultrasonic Systems, Inc. (USI manufacturer) that gives 
thin film thickness homogeneity with an error around ± 4 % 
on A4 sheet of Kapton HN. The operational principle 
consists in the product being applied into a rectangular tip 
through a liquid applicator. The spraying takes place by the 
vibration of a titanium transducer and due to the rectangular 
tip, the coating pattern is rectilinear, flat and uniform [4]. 
The ZnO films obtained were annealed for 3 hours at 300°C 
to improve their quality and stability. The gas measurements 
were carried out in a closed chamber by measuring the 
resistance through the sensitive material at different 
temperatures from 25°C to 350°C under a target exposure of 
1 minute in order to find the best operating conditions. We 
used a power supply to control the operating temperature 
and a source meter Keithley 6430 for the data acquisition.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Flexible gas sensors 
The gas sensor fabricated with ZnO nanoparticles as 
sensitive material and deposited by ultrasonic spray 
technique is presented in Figure 1.

B. Response to Ammonia and Ozone 
Figure 2 shows good sample responses and a wide range 
of detection from 10 ppm to 100 ppm for ammonia. The 
best working temperature has been determined at 300°C.

The response time is defined as the time taken by a sensor to 
achieve 90% of the total signal change when the sensor is 
exposed to a target gas [5][6][7]. Similarly, the recovery 
time is defined as the time it takes to reach 90% of the 
difference between the equilibrium resistance under target 
gas and the sensor resistance in dry air after the gas injection 
was stopped (i.e. in dry air with no gas) [8]. We observed 
good and fast responses, with recovery times of less than 2 
minutes, and a good detection range for ammonia. 
Responses to ozone during the same exposure time have 
also been registered and the best working temperature has 
been found at 200°C. Figure 3 presents the response at 
200°C under ozone from 5ppm to 300ppb. This exposure 
time did not allow reaching the response peak saturation as 
in the case of ammonia. However, for an exposure time of  
1 minute the responses are always fast for all concentrations 
as well as the time to come back to the baseline.

This coating technique presents important benefits such 
as good thin film distribution and good control of the 
deposit parameters.

CONCLUSION 
The gas measurements in our experiments showed good 
responses with fast response / recovery times towards 
ammonia (at 300 °C) and ozone (at 200 °C) in a wide range 
of gas concentrations. The obtained gas sensing properties 
on Kapton HN substrate and the use of ultrasonic spray 
deposition highlight the promising opportunity in the 
flexible electronic field to fabricate quality devices with fast 
and low cost production.
