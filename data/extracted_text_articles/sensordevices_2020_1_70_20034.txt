Abstract—The influence of post-processing conditions on the 
magnetic properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline 
microwires has been analyzed, paying attention on the effect of 
magnetoelastic and magnetocrystalline anisotropies on the 
hysteresis loops of Fe-, Ni- and Co-rich microwires. We 
demonstrated that the selection of appropriate chemical 
composition and geometry of as-prepared microwires and 
appropriate post-processing consisting of annealing or glass-
coated removal allow tuning of magnetic properties of glass-
coated microwires. Magnetic hardening of the microwires can 
be achieved by the devitrification of Fe-Pt-Si microwires.  
Keywords- magnetic microwires; magnetic softness; hysteresis 
loops; internal stresses; magnetic anisotropy. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
A family of amorphous and nanocrystalline materials 
prepared using rapid melt quenching is one of the most 
promising families of soft magnetic materials with a number 
of advantages, such as excellent magnetic softness, fast and 
inexpensive manufacturing process, dimensionality suitable 
for various sensor applications, and good mechanical 
properties [1]-[6]. Such excellent physical properties have 
been reported in amorphous materials with either planar 
(ribbons) [1]-[3] or cylindrical (wires) geometry [4]-[6].  
Amorphous and nanocrystalline wires can present quite 
peculiar magnetic properties, such as spontaneous magnetic 
bistability associated with single and large Barkhausen jump 
[7]-[9] or Giant Magneto-Impedance, GMI, effect [10]-[13]. 
In spite that both large Barkhausen and GMI effect have 
been also observed in crystalline wires [14][15], as well as 
in properly heat treated amorphous ribbons [3][12]. 
However, fast single domain wall, DW, propagation and 
high GMI effect have been observed in amorphous magnetic 
wires even without any post-processing [7]-[13].  
These features of amorphous and nanocrystalline 
microwires can be attributed to the combination of 
cylindrical 
geometry 
together 
with 
the 
specific 
magnetoelastic anisotropy. The latter is linked with the 
internal stresses distribution characteristic of rapid melt 
quenching, allowing to obtain a core-shell domain structure 
either with a high circumferential magnetic permeability (in 
negative magnetostrictive Co-rich compositions), or with 
the presence of an axially magnetized single inner domain 
responsible for the observation of a single and the large 
Barkhausen jump and the associated single DW propagation 
[16][17]. 
The main interest in GMI effect is justified by extremely 
high impedance sensitivity to an external magnetic field (up 
to 10 %/A/m) reported for magnetic microwires [18]-[20]. 
Several sensor applications, such as magnetic compass and 
acceleration sensors integrated in Complementary Metal-
Oxide-Semiconductor 
(CMOS) 
circuits, 
reduced-sized 
magnetometer suitable for magnetic field mapping, 
detection of a biomagnetic ﬁeld with the pico-Tesla 
sensitivity, magnetoelastic and temperature sensors have 
been developed [10][12][20]-[22]. 
On the other hand, magnetically bistable microwires are 
suitable various applications. Single and controllable DW 
propagation is suitable for magnetic logic, magnetic 
memory and electronic surveillance [23]-[26]. The former 
application is based on use of magnetic tags containing 
several 
microwires 
with 
well-defined 
coercivities 
(characteristic for magnetically bistable microwire) [26]. 
This application requires a variety of coercivity, Hc, values 
that can be achieved by the Hc tunability (either by 
compositional Hc dependence or influence of heat 
treatments on Hc -values). Accordingly, microwires with 
rectangular hysteresis loops and plurality of coercivities are 
requested in electronic surveillance applications. 
The additional advantages of glass-coated microwires 
are 
excellent 
corrosion 
and 
mechanical 
properties, 
biocompatibility, fast and simple fabrication method and

reduced dimensionality [4][5][27]-[30]. Such features allow 
to extend the applications possibilities. 
As 
reported 
elsewhere, 
magnetic 
properties 
of 
amorphous microwires are affected by the fabrication 
conditions (like quenching rate or glass-coating thickness), 
chemical composition of the metallic alloy and post-
processing conditions [9][12][15]. Accordingly, we will 
analyze the influence of various factors on the magnetic 
properties of glass-coated microwires and provide the 
guideline for selection of appropriate post-processing for 
optimization of properties of magnetic microwires. 
In section 2, we present the description of the 
experimental techniques, while in section 3 we describe the 
results on effect of fabrication and post-processing 
conditions on hysteresis loops of the microwires.  
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
We prepared and analyzed amorphous glass-coated 
microwires based on Fe-, Co- and Ni- alloys with minor 
metalloid additions (Si, B, C) necessary for preparation of 
amorphous alloys [9][15]. The employed Taylor-Ulitovsky 
technique is described earlier elsewhere [15]. 
We studied as-prepared and annealed samples. The 
annealing temperature, Tann, was between 200 °C to 700 °C 
for annealing time, tann, up to 256 min. Typically, the 
crystallization of amorphous microwires was reported for 
Tann ≥ 490 °C [31].  
Hysteresis loops of single microwires have been 
measured using the fluxmetric method previously described 
in details elsewhere [32]. In order to compare the samples 
with different compositions and subjected to different post-
processing, we represent the hysteresis loops as the 
normalized magnetization, M/M0, versus magnetic field, H, 
where M is the magnetic moment at a given magnetic field 
and M0 is the magnetic moment of the sample at the 
maximum magnetic field amplitude, Hm.  
In the case of magnetically hard microwires, the 
hysteresis loops have been measured using vibrating sample 
magnetometer by Physical Properties Measurements System 
by Quantum design.  
The magnetostriction coefficient, λs, of the studied 
microwire, was evaluated by the Small Angle Magnetization 
Rotation (SAMR) method recently adapted for microwire 
[33].  
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The magnetostriction coefficient, λs, sign and value 
affects the hysteresis loops of amorphous microwires (see 
Figure 1). The character of hysteresis loops of amorphous 
microwires with positive and negative λs-values is quite 
different: microwires with positive λs-values present 
rectangular hysteresis loops, while hysteresis loops of 
microwires with negative λs-values are almost non-
hysteretic with low coercitivity, Hc, values. Such influence 
must be attributed to the fact that the magnetoelastic 
anisotropy is the main source of magnetic anisotropy in 
amorphous materials [33]. 
The rectangular hysteresis loop observed in Fe-rich 
microwires with positive λs-values was interpreted in terms 
of axial magnetic anisotropy intrinsically related to a 
peculiar domain structure consisting of inner axially 
magnetized single domain and the outer domain shell with 
radial magnetization orientation [17].  
The remagnetization of such microwires is running by 
the single and large Barkhausen jump within the inner 
domain [8][17]. Perfectly rectangular hysteresis loop 
character is related to an extremely fast magnetization 
switching by single domain wall propagation. Such 
microwires with rectangular hysteresis loops are suitable for 
the electronic surveillance applications. However, plurality 
of Hc-values is required for such applications. One of the 
possibilities to tune the Hc-values is the control of the 
internal stresses. 
There are several factors responsible for the internal 
stresses value and distribution: (i) the difference in the 
thermal expansion coefficients of metallic alloy nucleus 
solidifying 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
glass 
coating 
surrounding it; (ii) the quenching stresses itself related to the 
rapid solidification of the metallic alloy nucleus from the 
surface inside the wire axis; and (iii) the drawing stresses 
[34]-[37].  
Most theoretical evaluations of the internal stresses 
value and distribution show that the largest internal stresses 
are associated with the difference in the thermal expansion 
coefficients of the metallic alloy and the glass coating [34]-
[37]. Accordingly, we must assume that the internal stresses 
value inside the metallic nucleus can be tuned by the ρ -ratio

between the metallic nucleus diameter, d, and the total 
microwire diameter, D (ρ = d/D) [34]-[37].  
Provided below hysteresis loops of Fe70B15Si10C5 
microwires with different ρ–ratio experimentally confirm 
such assumption (see Figure 2). The difference of the 
hysteresis loops of microwires with the same chemical 
composition must be related to different internal stresses, σi, 
values. Indeed, the magnetoelastic anisotropy, Kme, is given 
by [8][9][34][38]: 
 
Kme=3/2 λsσi

Naturally, controllable glass-coating removal is the other 
route to tune hysteresis loops of glass-coated microwires. 
The 
chemical 
etching 
of 
the 
glass-coating 
of 
Co68.5Si14.5B14.5Y2.5 microwire with higher negative λs-values 
allows transformation of linear hysteresis loop into 
rectangular (see Figure 3). As previously reported, after 
etching in 10% HF for 50 min, the glass-coating thickness 
decreases from 8.5 to 4 μm [39]. Accordingly, chemical 
etching of the glass-coating makes Co-rich microwires 
suitable for the electronic surveillance applications. Such 
remarkable influence of chemical etching must be 
associated with the relaxation of the internal stresses related 
to different thermal expansion coefficients of glass coating 
and metallic alloy. Accordingly, one can assume that the 
annealing allowing internal stresses relaxation must be the 
other route for adapting of glass-coated microwires for the 
electronic surveillance applications. Furthermore, such 
processing allows to keep the flexible and insulating glass 
coating. 
In the case of Fe70B15Si10C5 amorphous microwires, 
annealing allows a slight coercivity decrease, however the 
shape of the hysteresis loops remains the same (see Figure 
4). 
More remarkable and complex annealing influence is 
observed 
in 
Fe-Ni 
based 
microwires. 
As-prepared 
Fe62Ni15.5Si7.5B15 microwires present rectangular hysteresis 
loops (see Figure 5a) as expected for microwires with

positive λs-values (about 27 × 10−6). After annealing of 
Fe62Ni15.5Si7.5B15 microwires, a remarkable increase in 
coercivity, Hc, is generally observed (see Figures 5b–f). The 
hysteresis loop character remains unchanged: all hysteresis 
loops present rectangular shape. 
One of the origins of a rather different effect of 
annealing on coercivity of Fe and Fe-Ni based microwires 
can be a domain wall stabilization due to directional 
ordering of atomic pairs being considered [41]–[44]. 
However, local nano-sized precipitations and clustering 
observed in annealed Fe-Ni based microwires by the atom 
probe tomography can be the other origin of remarkable 
magnetic hardening and complex Hc(tann) dependence [42]. 
Furthermore, atom pair ordering and hence DW stabilization 
is reported for Fe-Ni and Fe-Co amorphous alloys [41]–
[44]. Such DW stabilization is considered as the main origin 
of the Hc rising upon annealing observed in amorphous 
materials containing two or more ferromagnetic elements 
[43][44]. Accordingly, annealing of Fe-Ni based microwires 
allows considerable variation of coercivity in Fe-Ni based 
microwire with rectangular hysteresis loops. 
Even more remarkable hardening upon conventional 
annealing has been reported in a variety of Co-rich 
microwires with vanishing λs-values [31][32]. Thus, 
transformation of linear hysteresis loop with low coercivity 
(Hc ≈ 4 A/m) into rectangular with Hc ≈ 90 A/m and 
considerable 
magnetic 
hardening 
are 
observed 
in 
Fe3.6Co69.2Ni1B12.5Si11Mo1.5C1.2 microwire upon annealing 
without stress (see Figure 6).  
Observed annealing influence must be attributed to the 
internal stresses relaxation and rising of the inner axially 
magnetized inner core diameter. Similar evolution of 
hysteresis loops upon annealing is confirmed in various Co-
based microwires with low and negative λs-values [9][45]. 
Consequently, similarly to glass-coating removal, annealing 
of Co-rich microwires allows for obtaining magnetically 
bistable Co-rich microwires. 
On the other hand, magnetically hard and semi-hard 
wires are desirable for various applications like the 
electronic article surveillance, compass needles, motors, 
tachometers, magnetic tips for magnetic force microscopy,

or dentistry [46]. For this purpose, Fe50Pt40Si10 microwires 
have been prepared. As-prepared Fe50Pt40Si10 microwires 
present amorphous structure. Magnetic hardening in 
Fe50Pt40Si10 microwires has been observed after annealing 
(see Figure 7). In this case, after devitrification of 
amorphous Fe50Pt40Si10 microwire, Hc ≈ 40 kA/m is 
observed. Such magnetic hardening has been attributed to 
the 
formation 
of 
L10-type 
superstructure 
after 
crystallization of as-prepared amorphous precursor. As can 
be appreciated, magnetic hardening is observed in a wide 
temperatures range. 
 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We showed that the magnetic properties of amorphous 
magnetic microwires can be tuned either in as-prepared state 
or by controlling the magnetoelastic anisotropy through the 
magnetostriction coefficient value and by the internal 
stresses values related to the fabrication conditions and 
geometry of microwires. Furthermore, appropriate post-
processing (including either conventional heat treatment, 
heat treatment in the presence of applied stress or magnetic 
field, or glass-coating removal) allows further tuning of 
magnetic properties of magnetic microwires. We showed 
that the microwires with coercivities from 1 A/m to 40 
kA/m can be prepared. Future work will focus on the 
influence of external stimuli (temperature, stresses) on the 
magnetic properties of magnetic microwires.
