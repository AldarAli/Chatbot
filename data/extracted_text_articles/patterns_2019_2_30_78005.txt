Abstract—In this paper, we present four patterns for nonpro-
fessional web developers. This is the third part of a series
of three thematically connected papers. The patterns in this
part of the series address backups, secure data storage and the
European General Data Protection Regulation. The reader will
be introduced to the basic knowledge of backups, followed by
an introduction to the new data protection regulations with an
explanation how to handle the associated additional responsibil-
ities regarding the handling and storage of personal data in the
internet.

INTRODUCTION
With the aid of guides and simple to use programs, setting
up websites, web shops, blogs and other web presences is
as easy as it ever was. The problem is however, the lack of
knowledge transfer about web security and privacy. Nonpro-
fessional web developers setting up web shops without proper
knowledge about the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) [1] may face charges for not obeying the European
law when it comes to safe data storage or data handling. Even
the lack of certain pieces of information on a commercial
website can lead to irreversible ﬁnancial data. Thus, blindly
trusting in guides is a bad idea. This is one of many reasons
why we decided to create web security and web privacy themed
design patterns to aid nonprofessional web developers and to
help to make the internet a safer place.
This paper constitutes the third part of a series of three
thematically connected papers, describing patterns from the
same pattern collection. The contribution of this paper is
an additional set of four patterns addressing backups, safe
and GDPR compliant data storage and GDPR compliance in
general. The ﬁrst paper of the three thematically connected
papers contains two meta-patterns. The second paper provides
a set of four patterns addressing updates, mail servers and the
security of web shops. Section II provides a short overview
over related word, Section III introduces four patterns with
the titles: ”When and how should I create backups?”, ”How
do I store data securely?”, ”Which data am I allowed to save?”
and ”What information do I have to provide to visitors of my
website?”. We will conclude this paper in Section IV.
II.
RELATED WORK
On 25 May 2018, the new GDPR was applied across
the European Union, enforcing new legal requirements as
a necessity to get data controllers to protect personal data
even more than before. However, data controllers are now
confronted with new challenges, to ensure the safety and to
comply with the GDPR. Two legal requirements which are
very important prove themselves as very controversial [2]–[4].
The ﬁrst one is the right to be forgotten and second the right
to withdraw consent. In the era of big data, cloud computing
and the Internet of Things, these laws might yield unforeseen
problems and consequences depending on interpretation and
implementation, especially for nonprofessionals in law and
web development as shown by Alnemr et al. [5] and Bob
Duncan [6]. Especially the right to be forgotten has a heavy
impact on backups and their archivation [7]. Due to this
circumstances operating websites, especially when handling
and working with personal data might prove as challenging
for novices in web development.
III.
PATTERNS
A. When and how should I create backups?
Intent: Creating regular backups can make your life easier
and less frustrating. Accidentally deleted, compromised or lost
ﬁles can easily be restored trough backups instead of being lost
forever.
Problem Statement: If ﬁles are deleted from a server, they
usually are irrevocably lost. There is no recycling bin to store
the deleted ﬁles in case you want to recover them. Corrupted or
compromised ﬁles and database entries can render a website
inoperable and in some rare cases they might even destroy
the whole website. In cases like these, backups can be a life
saver. A web shop for example that is ofﬂine for too long,
due to missing backups or faulty data, can lead to signiﬁcant
ﬁnancial losses. Apart from that, on-commercial websites that
are ofﬂine for a longer period of time, will notice a drop in
the rankings of searching engines.
Scenario: System relevant ﬁles were deleted due to a
system error. The functionality of the website is greatly limited.
After ﬁxing this problem with great effort because no backups
were available, you decide to inform yourself about backups.
Solution: Backups are, in simple words, basically du-
plicated version of (all or certain) ﬁles. A modern website
consists of multiple ﬁles ranging from ﬁles that contain the
design and style information, images, plugins and database
ﬁles where the posts and comments of users are commonly
saved. The best way to make a copy of all of those ﬁles is
to create a (full) backup. There are multiple ways to create
backups - either you create them manually by copying the
42

PATTERNS 2019 : The Eleventh International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

ﬁles one by one, or you use an automated script, a plugin or
a special backup software. However the backups are made,
you should always keep in mind that things can go wrong.
Therefore, it is mandatory to understand the backup process
in order to avoid mistakes and it is even more important to
validate the backups after they are created. A corrupt, faulty
or not working backup is as good as having no backup at all.
Backup Frequency - Backups should be created in regular
intervals. But especially before:
• (major)updated
of
the
operating
system
or
impor-
tant(server) software
• before moving to a new server (e.g., migration)
There is no golden rule for the frequency of backups.
Generally, it is up to you, to decide when it is the time to
create a backup. You have to think about the importance and
amount of the data and whether it is worth the time creating
a backup. It is possible to save some time, and skip backups
with the possible risk of minimal data loss in case something
happens. It is important to ﬁnd the balance.
A web shop or a well visited bulletin board lively and active
community, should do daily or real-time backups, as a data
loss could have a very high impact and could lead to ﬁnancial
consequences. For more information about web shops please
refer to pattern: How do I secure a web shop and what should
be taken into consideration? [8]. If the site in question is only
for information purposes or if the website does not receive
daily input, it is sufﬁcient to backup the site once a week.
Speaking of backups, there are a lot of possible forms. It
is possible to secure only parts (e.g., images, ﬁles or only the
database) of a page, or to do a full backup (i.e., saving the
whole website with all of its components). If, for example,
you have a well-visited website with only few postings and
comments, a full backup (all ﬁles and the database) should
be done once a week. A backup of the database, containing
the user postings and comments should be done in more
frequently. Two or three times a week seem reasonably if the
page is well visited and the user base is posting or commenting
frequently.
Note, however, not every type of backup makes it possible
to restore individual ﬁles. Therefore, each and every backup
method has to be tested and veriﬁed before you start relying
on a certain method.
Veriﬁcation of Backups - Backups are important! In case of
a unfortunate event or a disaster, they might help you to recover
individual ﬁles or even a whole system. Since backups might
be the last resort in critical moments, you have to be able to
count on them. This is why all backups should be tested and
veriﬁed if it is feasible.
• Test whether they are corrupt or functional.
• Verify whether the Backups can be used to recover a
system or ﬁles.
Automated Backups - Backing up a system manually (i.e.,
copy and paste important ﬁles by hand) can take a long time,
especially when it is a large and complex system. Therefore,
it is recommended to use backup software which offers the
possibility to automate the backup process. Examples of such
programs can be found in the ”Examples” section of this
pattern. Some hosting provider also offer automated backups
in their offers. It is recommended to keep that in mind, in case
you forgot to do backups by yourself. This might save your
day.
File and Database Backups - Before going deeper into spe-
ciﬁc backup solutions, it is important to be able to distinguish
between data/ﬁle backups and database backups. Because
depending of the type of data you want to back up, the
processes vary. A WordPress page will be used as an example
to explain the differences in the backup process depending on
what is going to be saved.
Files: Apart from the mandatory main installation ﬁles of
a WordPress installation,the term ﬁles also includes themes,
designs, plugins, images, scripts (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, etc.),
as well as other ﬁles and static pages. The ﬁles can be saved
by following methods:
• Files may be backed up by the hosting providers (if they
offer this service).
• Special backup software (e.g.,https://winscp.net/eng/docs/
introduction) can create backups of your site and store
them either locally or on a different server.
• There are WordPress plugins that create backups au-
tomatically at a certain time you can deﬁne (https://
wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/).
• Manually transfer data to your own computer or a hard
drive using a FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program
(e.g.,https://ﬁlezilla-project.org) or command line tools.
Basically, its about saving ﬁles from one location and then
copying them to a different location or storage device.
Databases: Database backups work differently compared
to ﬁle backups. However, a database backup is always done the
same way. Even automatically generated database backups by
WordPress plugins, are identical to those that have been gener-
ated manually. First of all, you have to access the database by
logging into it by using the database login credentials. Then
you have to select the database entries you want to save and
export them. This will result in a ﬁle, that can be used to
recover the database entries. In the case of standard WordPress
and phpMyAdmin installations, the database is called ”wp”.
Login into the database, select the database ”wp” and export
its contents. Viola, there you have the database backup.
It is recommended to make about 3 backup copies and
store them in different locations (e.g., hard disk, cloud or
server). This will help to be safe in case one or two of the
storage locations fail.
Examples: Backup Software - The following programs can
be used to back up individual ﬁles or complete systems. Please
follow the links provided below if you want to know how the
software works and whether it is suitable for your needs.

B. How do I store data securely?
Intent: This pattern addresses the problems of the secure
storage of user generated content and user data.
Problem Statement: The secure storage of data has to
be handled according to the EU General Data Protection
Regulation [1]. This is especially important if the data in
question is personal data.
Scenario: A website is allowing its users to write com-
ments and to upload data (images or similar). The comments
and content have to be transferred and stored on the web server
securely.
Solution:
• Keep your system and server safe and up-to-date.
◦ An up-to-date system equipped with an up-to-date anti
virus program and the latest (security) updates offers
less attack vectors for cyber criminals.
• SSL/TLS Encryption Communication
◦ An encrypted connection allows a secure data transfer
and guarantees data integrity.
• Save Received Data in Anonymous and/or Encrypted
Format.
◦ Important information, like passwords, should never be
stored directly in plain text. Encrypt the data before
storing it in the database.
◦ Some data may only be stored in encrypted and/or
anonymous form (e.g., personal data).
For more information, please refer to pattern:
Which data I am allowed to save? [17].
• Deﬁne and Set Access Rights.
◦ The fewer people have access to the data, the safer the
data generally is.
◦ Adjust access rights for users individually.
Everyone should only have access to ﬁles and
folders meant for them.
• Database Backup.
◦ It is not just about storing the data safely. Securing the
stored data is important as well.
• Encrypted Backups.
◦ Encrypting backups is an additional step to take to
secure the data even more. While this is totally optional,
an encrypted backup can make it much harder for
unauthorized people to access the ﬁles inside of them.
Examples:
Ensure Security Your System - An up-to-
date system offers less attacking vectors for potential cyber
criminals. It is mandatory to ensure the installation of the
latest (security) updates. More about this topic can be found
in pattern ”When and how often should I install updates?”
[18]. Securing your own computer or server is only the ﬁrst
step to ensure a secured system. It is also necessary to secure
the website itself. Pattern How do I check the security of my
website?” [19] explains in depth how this can be done.
Ensuring Data Integrity - Pattern ”How do I encrypt the
communication with my website? [20] explains how to enable
an SSL/TLS encrypted connection (HTTPS) on your own
website. With a secure HTTPS connection, the communication
between the users web browser and the encrypted website is
encrypted. This ensures, that all the data that comes from the
user is really from him.

C. Which data am I allowed to save?
Intent: This pattern addresses the question, what data you
are allowed to save on your website and what there is to
consider when doing so.
Problem Statement: With all the advances in web de-
velopment, nowadays it is possible to gather a lot of data
from website visitors. But what kind of data are you allowed
to gather and save according to GDPR (EU General Data
Protection Regulation) ?
Scenario: Website operators have to follow the new GDPR
and are required to adjust their website to match these regula-
tions.
Solution: Attention: This pattern is not a legal advice!
We addressed the GDPR (https://www.dsb.gv.at/gesetze-
in-osterreich [ger]) and applicable data protection reg-
ulations during our research for the patterns, however,
we are no legal advisors, nor are we lawyers or privacy
experts. We shall not have any liability whatsoever for the
accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing
of the provided information.
Current regulations for ﬁles, links and general user
content:
According to the Austrian E-Commerce Act 17 (exclusion
of responsibility for links) [26], the website operator is not
responsible for the content of links posted on his site (by other
persons), as long as he has no knowledge of content provides
via this link. However, if the operator determines that the link
contains or links to illegal activity or information (for example,
a link to a movie or a song ﬁle), the link has to be removed
immediately.
It is recommended to apply regulations and deﬁne whats
allowed on the website or not in the form terms of services.
The terms clarify which and whether content may be uploaded
by users, or that if content is uploaded, the user has to have
the appropriate usage rights for that content. Attention : Never
write anything in the terms and service, that you simply can
44

PATTERNS 2019 : The Eleventh International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

not do! For example, never specify that any content will be
checked before it is posted on your website. As this makes
you liable for each and any content on the website, regardless
who posted it. As this states, that you have checked and veriﬁed
that link in general and have knowledge about its content. The
operator of a website is also liable for the content of a link
posted by an employee or a person who is supervised by the
operator.
Special regulations for personal data currently described
in the GDPR:
• Website operators have to ensure the security of personal
data.
◦ It is deﬁned in the GDPR as Privacy by Design /
Privacy by Default, meaning, that everybody must use
appropriate technical measures and procedures (e.g.,
pseudonymization) to ensure data security.
• Users need to be informed. Especially about what happens
with their data and how their data will be used. In
addition, users must actively agree that data may be stored
by teh website.
◦ More information can be found in pattern:What infor-
mation do I have to provide to visitors of my website?
[27].
• Users have the right to have their data deleted (i.e., ”the
right to be forgotten”).

What is personal data?
• General personal Data
◦ Name, birthday date, age, address, e-mail-address,
phone numbers, pictures from the person, education,
job, marital status, nationality religious, as well as po-
litical attitude, sexuality, health data, holiday planning
and police record.
• Identiﬁcation (ID) numbers.
◦ Social security number, tax number, health insurance
number, ID card number, matriculation number.
• Banking Information
• Online Data
◦ Internet Protocol (IP) address, a cookie ID, location
data (for example the location data function on a mobile
phone).
• Physical Characteristics.
◦ Gender, skin color, hair color and eye color.
• Possession Features
◦ Car, property ownership, land registry entries, license
plate number.
• Customer data
◦ Orders, bank account informations, account data, etc.
• Personal data can be deﬁned as any information that
relates to an identiﬁed or identiﬁable living individual. For
example, a birthday alone can not always be linked to a
speciﬁc person without additional information. However,
if a name is added to this birthday, it is way easier to pin
it down to a certain person. Thus, you have to be careful
when displaying or providing personal data in general.

D. What information do I have to provide to visitors of my
website?
Intent: This pattern aims to inform website operators what
kind information they legally have to provide their users on
websites.
Problem Statement: The Internet is not a lawless place.
There are laws intended to protect internet users which have to
be respected by websites and theirs operators. Website owners
should know their rights, as well as theirs responsibilities and
should be at least be acquainted with the law.
Scenario: A website is almost ready to go online. What
information does it have to provide to its users in order to be
GDPR compliant?
Solution: Attention: This pattern is not a legal advice!
We addressed the GDPR (https://www.dsb.gv.at/gesetze-
in-osterreich [ger]) and applicable data protection reg-
ulations during our research for the patterns, however,
we are no legal advisors, nor are we lawyers or privacy
experts. We shall not have any liability whatsoever for the
accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing
of the provided information.
The website imprint, the terms of service and the privacy
policy must be easy to ﬁnd and access has always to be
guaranteed. It is advisable to place these things in a good
position where its visible all the time (e.g., in the header, or
in the footer of a website).
Attention! - For web shops additional conditions apply.
Please visit the following site for more information: General
Terms and Conditions - Details [ger] [33].
• Imprint
◦ The imprint is not an obligation for small private
websites (e.g., a travel blog or a page only for friends).
This is stated in Austrian Federal Law Consolidated
Version, Media Act 24. Nevertheless, it is advisable to
provide an imprint for the reasons of transparency.
◦ The imprint includes:
Name or Company Name of the page owner and
operator.
Registration number and place of registration.
Place of residence or registered ofﬁce of the page
owner.
◦ If the site is serving (directly or indirectly) commer-
cial purposes, the Austrian Federal Law Consolidated
Version, Media Act 25 applies.

CONCLUSION
This paper is the third and ﬁnal part of a series of three
thematically connected papers. It presents four additional pat-
terns with the aim to aid nonprofessional web developers un-
derstanding common privacy and security problems frequently
surfacing during the creation of websites. These patterns
explain the importance of updates and the difﬁculties of saving
and handling user data in a GDPR compliant way. While the
explanation of the underlying concept and beneﬁt of backups
is quite straightforward and can easily be stated in one pattern,
it is a different matter for the GDPR. Depending on the type
of website and which data is being handled, the regulations
and requirements deﬁned by the GDPR can vary extremely.
Thus, it is not possible to explain the complete GDPR in
this format. We tried to cover the most important question
by providing solutions, examples for possible problem cases
in order to provide a decent knowledge base for novice web
developers. Future work will mainly focus on the extension of
the pattern solutions while keeping the existing patterns up-to-
date to ensure future validity and usefulness.
