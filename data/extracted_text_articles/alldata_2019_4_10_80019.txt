Abstract—The digital transformation of business and society 
has led to the growth of networks in almost every field. Finding 
communities in real world networks has been considered 
crucial for modern network science. Moreover, the organization 
of communities into co-occurring disjoint, nested and 
overlapping structures adds to the complexity of community 
detection problem. Therefore, methodological rigor is crucial 
for community detection so as to foster cumulative tradition in 
data and knowledge engineering. This paper proposes an 
algorithm for overlapping community detection based on the 
concepts of rough set theory. Initially, subsets of links are 
formed by using neighborhood links around each pair of nodes. 
Subsequently, we iteratively obtain the constrained linkage 
upper approximation of these subsets. The notion of mutual 
link reciprocity is used as a merging criterion during the 
iterations. The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated 
on eight real-world networks. Comparative analysis with state-
of-the-art 
algorithms 
demonstrates 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
proposed algorithm.

INTRODUCTION 
       The technological advancement in contemporary digital 
world has led to the formation and mapping of systems 
which consist of many interconnected dynamical units. Such 
systems are collectively referred to as complex systems 
because their constituent units are capable of interacting not 
only with each other but also with the environment [1]. Some 
examples of complex systems include a social club that 
requires cooperation among its members to achieve a 
common goal, the Internet consisting of millions of 
interconnected routers and the human brain comprising 
millions of synaptically connected neurons [2]. All the 
networks arising from complex systems, irrespective of 
diversity in their origin, nature, size and scope, follow a 
common set of organizing principles [1]. Since the existence 
of cohesive subgroups (generally known as communities) is 
one of the fundamental properties of complex networks, 
identifying them is essential to explore and understand the 
dynamics of complex real-world systems. 
     Communities are considered as thickly connected 
subgroups of nodes within a complex network such that the 
link density within subgroups is much higher than the 
density of links between subgroups [3]. The dense inter-
community connectedness exists due to organizational or 
functional components within a network such as groups of 
friends in a social network of students, and groups of 
companies with interlocking directorates in organizational 
networks [2]. In this research work, we design a community 
detection algorithm based on the unexplored theoretical 
synergy of the concepts of link communities in network 
science and upper approximation in rough set paradigm. As 
discussed in Section III, this synergy is constituted by 
expanding each link and its link neighborhood component 
using the concept of upper approximation rather than 
expanding each node and its node neighborhood component 
which has been the focus in prior research [4]-[7]. 
     This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
briefly present the motivation behind this work. In Section 
III, the methodology of the proposed algorithm is explained. 
Section IV presents the experimental setup. In Section V, the 
experimental results are discussed. Finally, Section VI 
concludes this work.   
II. 
MOTIVATION 
     An effective community detection technique can 
transform business and society through its widespread 
applications. These applications range from topic detection 
in collaborative tagging systems, to event detection on social 
media content [3]. In the past, community detection 
techniques have been used to devise antiterrorism strategies 
and understand functional patterns of the human brain that 
can help in positioning and pricing of products [8][9].  
     Though researchers have been addressing the community 
detection problem for more than a decade, state-of-the-art 
algorithms still have several limitations [10]. A majority of 
the existing algorithms assign each node to only one 
community; some algorithms are domain specific; some 
require 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
about 
the 
number 
of 
communities; some are not scalable for large networks and 
some are unsusceptible to variations in size of communities. 
One of the major challenges encountered currently for 
community detection is the identification of overlapping 
communities which manifest the reality of today’s world 
[11]. For instance, in social networks, individuals may 
belong to multiple communities due to their friendships, 
professional associations, family relationships and so on. 
Moreover, communities may overlap not only partially but 
also entirely such that one community is contained in another 
[12]. An effective community detection algorithm must be 
receptive to distinctive features of community structure in 
complex networks and be capable of detecting co-occurring 
disjoint, nested and overlapping communities.

III. 
LUAMCOM – PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
     Soft computing techniques for community detection such 
as evolutionary computing, swarm intelligence, fuzzy logic 
and genetic algorithms have gained popularity in recent 
years [13]-[15]. However, rough set theory has not been 
explored to its fullest potential for mathematical modelling 
of complex networks thus indicating methodological gaps in 
the burgeoning community detection literature.  
     The proposed Link Upper Approximation Method for 
COMmunity detection is abbreviated as LUAMCOM. Since, 
links are more idiosyncratic in nature as compared to nodes, 
pervasive overlaps in community structure are better 
discovered by clustering of links rather than nodes [16]. The 
proposed algorithm considers links of a complex network as 
entities to be clustered wherein each link and its 
neighborhood links form initial components (granule in 
rough set terminology) [17]. These initial components are 
termed as Link Neighborhood Subsets (LNS). Then, the 
concept of upper approximation is used iteratively to grow 
these components in a constrained manner until they merge 
to form stable components. This step consists of iterative 
formation of First Linkage Upper Approximation (FLUA) 
and Constrained Linkage Upper Approximation (CLUA) 
until convergence. The converged or stable components are 
actually the identified communities within a network. The 
notion of Mutual Link Reciprocity (MLR) is used as a 
merging criterion during the iterations. As shown in Figure 
1, the iterative process followed by a fine-tuning process, 
ensures that the detected community structure displays high 
intra-community density of links, and low inter-community 
density of links. To the best of our knowledge, LUAMCOM 
is the first community detection algorithm based on 
integration of link granulation and upper approximation. 
IV.     EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
     We 
conducted 
experiments 
on 
network 
datasets 
representing complex systems in diverse domains. These 
networks consist of a network of friendships at a karate club 
(34 nodes, 78 links) [18], network of bones in human skull 
(35 nodes, 79 links) [19], network of associations between 
dolphins (62 nodes, 159 links) [20], network of friendships 
in a high school (69 nodes, 220 links) [21], network of 
political books sold online by Amazon.com (105 nodes, 441 
links) [22], co-appearance network of football teams (115 
nodes, 613 links) [23], an online network of friendships on 
Facebook (2888 nodes, 2981 links) and a human protein-
protein interaction network (3724 nodes, 8748 links) [24]. 
All the experimental work was conducted in the R 
programming environment. We used a system with Intel 
Core i5 processor and 8.00 GB RAM, running R version 
3.2.5. The version 0.8.2 beta of Gephi software has been 
used for visualization.  
     To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
algorithm, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art 
community detection techniques using evaluation criteria na- 
 
 
Figure 1. Flow Diagram of LUAMCOM 
 
 
-mely Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) [25], partition 
density [16] and overlapping modularity [26]. Each of these 
evaluation measures has its own relevance and importance 
for measuring the quality of community detection. NMI 
computes the agreement between detected community 
structure and true community structure. In this work, we 
have used a variant of NMI that is designed especially for 
overlapping communities and results in the same NMI values 
as the standard measure when there is no overlap. Another 
measure used in this work is an extended version of 
modularity that can be used for evaluation of overlapping 
communities. This measure was proposed to address the 
limitations of traditional modularity. Finally, we have used a 
measure called partition to evaluate the quality of link based 
communities. Since partition density measures the intra-
community density of links, it is considered more suitable 
for assessing the quality of overlapping community 
detection. 
     For comparison of the proposed algorithm with state-of-
the-art 
algorithms, 
we 
consider 
the 
most 
relevant 
overlapping community detection algorithms such as Ahn 
Bagrow Lehmann (ABL) [16], Community Overlap 
PRopagation Algorithm (COPRA) [27], Clique Percolation 
Method (CPM) [28] and Greedy Clique Expansion (GCE) 
[29].

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
     The proposed algorithm identifies five overlapping 
communities in the human skull network. These five 
communities, generally known as complexes in case of 
biological networks include a complex representing the 
group of facial bones, groups of cranial bones, cervical 
bones, left and right ear ossicles bones. The overlapping 
community structure detected by the proposed algorithm in 
the human skull network is highly consistent with the results 
reported in existing literature [19] and shows the functional 
and developmental dependencies of bones in the human 
skull.   
     The proposed algorithm identifies five overlapping 
communities, one nested and one disjoint community in the 
high school network. The nested community within grade-9 
corresponds to a subgroup of different ethnicity [21]. 
However, two nodes have been misclassified in the high 
school network. The proposed algorithm competes favorably 
with state-of-the-art community detection algorithms. 
Although the NMI value of GCE is slightly higher than that 
of the proposed algorithm, it detects only six communities 
and overlooks the nested community within grade-9 [21]. 
The overlapping nodes detected by the proposed algorithm 
are quite similar to existing overlapping community 
detection algorithms such as COPRA, GCE and ABL. 
     The experiment on karate club reveals two communities 
wherein all the nodes have been classified correctly. 
However, the proposed algorithm detects four nodes as 
overlapping, thus indicating evidence for dual memberships 
of some of the members within the karate club. This result is 
in accordance with the observation that some bridge nodes 
act as information carriers within the two communities of 
karate club [18]. The experiment on dolphin network divides 
the network into two communities consisting of 21 and 41 
nodes without any misclassification. However, three 
overlapping sub-communities were found in the larger 
community. The composite performance of the proposed 
algorithm outperforms ABL, CPM and GCE on karate and 
dolphin networks. However, COPRA obtained higher score 
on the karate club network because of its higher NMI.  
     The proposed algorithm identifies three communities with 
one overlapping node on a network of political books 
(polbooks). The composite score of the proposed algorithm 
in the case of the polbooks network is higher than ABL, 
COPRA, CPM and almost equal to GCE. On the football 
network, the proposed algorithm identifies 11 communities 
and outperforms ABL, COPRA and CPM, while being 
slightly behind GCE in terms of composite score.  
     We also performed experiments on larger networks such 
as, a network of friendships extracted from Facebook and 
human protein interaction network downloaded from an 
online database [30]. In an undirected version Facebook 
network, 16 communities identified by the proposed 
algorithm were found to be structurally similar to those 
identified by the edge label propagation approach [24]. On 
the Protein Protein Interaction (PPI) network, the detected 
community structure was very similar to that of an algorithm 
based on binary tree theory [31]. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
     In this paper, we proposed an algorithm based on 
granulation and upper approximation of links for overlapping 
community detection in complex networks. We have 
investigated the performance of the proposed algorithm on 
different types of networks. The proposed algorithm 
performs competitively with state-of-the-art community 
detection algorithms and effectively detects co-occurring 
disjoint, nested and overlapping community structures in 
complex real-world networks. While the proposed algorithm 
makes an important methodological contribution to the 
challenging problem of community detection, it is applicable 
only to undirected and unweighted networks. In the future, 
we intend to enhance the capability of the proposed 
methodology to detect communities in directed and weighted 
networks. We believe that the proposed algorithm will 
impart rigor while guiding future research in the field of 
complex network analysis.
