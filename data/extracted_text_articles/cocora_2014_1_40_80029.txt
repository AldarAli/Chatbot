Abstract—Two particular semi-blind spectrum sensing algo-
rithms are taken into account in this paper: Energy Detection
(ED) and Roy’s Largest Root Test (RLRT). Both algorithms
require the knowledge of the noise power in order to achieve
optimal performance. Since by its nature the noise power is
unpredictable, noise variance estimation is needed in order
to cope with the absence of prior knowledge of the noise
power: this leads to a new hybrid approach for both considered
detectors. Probability of detection and false alarm with this new
approach are derived in closed-form expressions. The impact
of noise estimation accuracy for ED and RLRT is evaluated in
terms of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and
performance curves, i.e., detection/misdetection probability as a
function of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Analytical results
have been conﬁrmed by numerical simulations under a ﬂat-fading
channel scenario. It is concluded that both hybrid approaches
tend to their ideal cases when a large number of slots is used for
noise variance estimation and that the impairment due to noise
uncertainty is reduced on RLRT w.r.t. ED.

I. INTRODUCTION
Among the functionality provided by Cognitive Radio [1],
Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) is devised as a dynamic
method to increase the overall spectrum efﬁciency by allowing
Secondary Users to utilize unused licensed spectrum. For this
Cognitive Radio System requires the implementation of a
spectrum sensing unit in order to gain awareness of available
transmission opportunities. This unit must indicate whether a
transmission is taking place in the considered channel. Among
several spectrum sensing methods put forward for Cognitive
Radio applications, techniques based on eigenvalues of the
received covariance matrix evolved as a promising solution
for spectrum sensing outperforming classical ED.
Semi-blind spectrum sensing algorithms, i.e., ED and RLRT,
are the optimum spectrum sensing techniques in a known
noise power level scenario. However, in real systems the
detector does not have a prior knowledge of the noise level.
In recent years, variation and unpredictability of the precise
noise level at the sensing device came as a critical issue,
which is also known as noise uncertainty. With the goal
of reducing the impact of noise uncertainty on the signal
detection performance of ED and Eigenvalue Based Detection
(EBD), several research has been proposed including [2], [3],
[4] for ED and [7], [8] for EBD. Hybrid spectrum sensing
algorithms based on the combination of ED and Feature De-
tection techniques have been put forward for the reduction of
the effect of noise variance uncertainty [5], [6]. Similar hybrid
spectrum sensing approach was discussed in [9] using the
positive points of ED and Covariance Absolute Value detection
methods while Sequeira et al. [10] used Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), Minimum Description Length (MDL) and
Rank Order Filtering (ROF) methods for estimation of noise
power in presence of signal for energy based sensing. In [7],
the importance of accurate noise estimation has been shown
for better performance of the EBD algorithms.
This paper presents an idea of auxiliary noise variance
estimation and focuses on the performance evaluation of
Hybrid Approach of semi-blind detection algorithms, namely
ED and RLRT, using the same estimated noise variance. The
rest of this paper is organized as follows: the system model is
developed in Section II, test statistics of detection algorithms is
noted in Section III, noise estimation approaches in relation to
ED and RLRT are discussed in Section IV, Hybrid Energy De-
tection and Hybrid Roy’s Largest Root Test schemes based on
the noise estimation approaches are discussed in Section V and
Section VI respectively, the simulation results and the effect of
noise variance estimation on considered detection algorithms
are discussed in Section VII and ﬁnally, Section VIII concludes
the paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider K sensors (receivers or antennas) for the ED
/ EBD detector, which senses and decides the presence or
absence of the single primary signal within a deﬁned spectrum
band W. In a given sensing time interval T, the detector
calculates its detection statistic TD by collecting N samples
from each one of the K sensors. The received samples are
stored by the detector in the K × N matrix Y.
Let
us

As all the signal samples s(n) of S and the noise vectors
v(n) of V are assumed statistically independent, the detector
must distinguish between Null and Alternate Hypothesis given
by Y|H0 = V and Y|H1 = hS + V where, h is the complex
channel vector h = [h1 · · · hK]T assumed to be constant and
memory-less during the sampling window.
Under H1, the average SNR at the receiver is deﬁned as,
ρ ≜ E∥x(n)∥2

where, ||.|| denotes the Euclidean norm and E the mean

and λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λK its eigenvalues sorted in decreasing order.
III. TEST STATISTICS
The test statistic of ED and RLRT algorithms based on the
scenario developed in Section II can be noted in the following
subsections.
A. Energy Detection (ED)
ED computes the average energy of the received signal
matrix Y normalized by the noise variance σ2
v and compares
it against a predeﬁned threshold ted.
TED =

(3)
If TED < ted it decides in favor of Null Hypothesis H0
otherwise in favor of Alternate Hypothesis H1. The detection
probability Pd = Prob{TED > ted|H1} and false alarm
Pfa = Prob{TED > ted|H0} probabilities for this detector
are well-known in the literature (e.g., [11]).
B. Roy’s Largest Root Test
Using the information of the received signal matrix Y and
assuming a perfect knowledge of the noise variance σ2
v and
the channel parameter h, test statistic for RLRT [12] is given
by
TRLRT = λ1
σ2v
.
(4)
RLRT is the optimum test algorithm under the “semi-blind”
class of EBD algorithms, which is considered as the reference
test in this class whose Detection and False Alarm Probability
could be noted as [7],

IV. NOISE ESTIMATION
It is evident that the knowledge of the noise power is
imperative for the optimum performance of both ED and
RLRT. Unfortunately, the variation and the unpredictability of
noise power is unavoidable. Thus, the knowledge of the noise
power is one of the critical limitations especially of semi-blind
detection algorithms for their operation in low SNR.
A. Ofﬂine noise estimation: Hybrid approach 1
In the ﬁrst type of hybrid approaches (HED1 and HRLRT1),
noise variance is estimated from S auxiliary noise-only slots
in which we are sure that the primary signal is absent.
Consider a sampling window of length M prior and adjacent
to the detection window containing noise-only samples for
sure. Then, the estimated noise variance from the noise-only
samples using a Maximum Likelihood noise power estimation
can be written as,
ˆσ2
v1 =
1
KM
K
X
k=1
M

|vk(m)|2
(10)
If the noise variance is constant, the estimation can be
averaged over S successive noise-only slots and (10) can be
modiﬁed by averaging over S successive noise-only slots as,
ˆσ2
v1(S) =
1
KSM
S
X
s=1

(11)
A possible scheme of RLRT/ED detection algorithm using
ofﬂine noise estimation approach is shown in Fig. 1: ttot
represents a periodic time interval divided into a training
phase (noise estimation) and a runtime phase (detection). The
runtime interval can be much longer than the training one,
however the noise estimation needs to be updated after ttot.
B. Online noise estimation: Hybrid approach 2
In a real time scenario, it is difﬁcult to guarantee the
availability of signal free samples so as to estimate the noise
variance. Some literature analyzed the performance of ED us-
ing estimated noise variance setting aside a separate frequency
channel for the measurement of the noise power [13]. How-
ever, it is not always suitable to assume uniformly distributed
noise in all the frequency bands of concern.

HED1 / HRLRT1 with ofﬂine noise estimation approach
The second hybrid approach does not resort to the existence
of auxiliary noise-only slots, but estimates the noise variance
information from the previous slots declared as H0 by the
algorithm. Now, the noise variance estimated from those S
auxiliary noise-only slots (previously declared H0) is used in
the following detection interval to get the decision about the
presence or absence of the primary signal.
Given PS the probability of receiving primary signal plus
noise, Pd is probability of detection, and S is the number of
slots, the Maximum Likelihood noise variance estimate ˆσ2
v2(S)
using M received signal samples declared noise samples by
the detector from K receivers is given by,

where, SS = SPS (1 − Pd) is the number of primary signal
slots missed by the detector and SN = S − SS is the number
of noise samples successfully detected.
Fig. 2 shows a possible scheme of RLRT/ED detection algo-
rithm using online noise estimation approach; after a transient
stage (ofﬂine noise estimation), the detector automatically
updates the noise estimation after S slots declared H0 (sliding
window). Unlike the ﬁrst approach, no further training ofﬂine
phases are required.
V. HYBRID ENERGY DETECTION
Incorporating the ofﬂine noise estimation and online noise
estimation described in Section IV in ED, hybrid approaches
of ED are developed and their performance parameters are
derived in the following subsections.
A. Hybrid ED approach 1 (HED1)
The Energy Detection Test Statistic in (3) can be modiﬁed
to HED1 test statistic using (11) as,
THED1 =

KN ˆσ2v1(S)
K

k=1

n=1
|yk(n)|2
(13)
Moreover, (13) can be considered as the parametric likelihood
ratio test when the signal to be detected is assumed to be
Gaussian with zero mean and variance σ2
s.
Under Null Hypothesis, after rigorous simpliﬁcation, the test
statistic in (13) could be approximated with a Normal Random
Variable whose Probability of False Alarm P HED1

Similarly, under Alternate Hypothesis, the test statistic in (13)
also approximates to Normal Random Variable with different

VI. HYBRID ROY’S LARGEST ROOT TEST
In a similar way as for ED, if we incorporate ofﬂine
noise estimation and online noise estimation in RLRT, hybrid
approaches of RLRT are developed and their performance
parameters are derived in the following subsections.
A. Hybrid RLRT approach 1 (HRLRT1)
HRLRT1 is a similar approach as HED1, which deals with
the study of detection performance of the RLRT algorithm
using estimated noise variance. Noise variance is estimated
from S auxiliary noise-only slots where we are sure that
the primary signal is absent. Using the ML estimate of the
noise variance (11), the decision statistic of HRLRT1 can be
expressed as,
THRLRT 1 =
λ1
ˆσ2v1(S)
(19)
Under Null Hypothesis, after rigorous simpliﬁcation, the test
statistic in (19) could be approximated to the ratio of a Tracy
Widom Random Variable of order 2 and a Normal Random
Variable. Hence, the False Alarm Probability P HRLRT 1
fa
for
number of sensors K, number of samples N, number of
auxiliary slots S for noise estimation using (11) and threshold
t1 is given by,
P HRLRT 1
fa
= 1 − FH1

with fT W 2(.) being the pdf of Tracy Widom Distribution and

Similarly, under Alternate Hypothesis, the test statistic in
(19) approximates to Normal Random Variable whose Proba-

(22)
where, µx (8) and σ2

B. Hybrid RLRT approach 2 (HRLRT2)
HRLRT2 is an alternate hybrid approach of RLRT where
noise variance given by (12) is estimated from the previously
received signal slots declared as H0 by the algorithm. The
decision statistic of HRLRT2 can be written as,
THRLRT 2 =
λ1
ˆσ2v2(S)
(23)
Under Null Hypothesis, after rigorous simpliﬁcation, the test
statistic in (23) could be approximated to the ratio of a Tracy

VII. SIMULATION RESULTS
This section shows the simulation of the ROC curves and
performance curves of hybrid approaches of ED and RLRT
spectrum sensing algorithms. The accuracy of the the closed-
form expressions is conﬁrmed by the results presented in Fig. 3
and Fig. 4, respectively, where the theoretical formulas are
compared against the simulated detection performance over
S auxiliary noise-only slots (S ranges from 1 to 8). Perfect
match of the theoretical and the numerical curve validates the
considered model. As it can be noticed, with the increase in
the number of auxiliary slots used for the estimation of the
noise variance, the probability of detection increases for both
hybrid approaches.
Fig. 5 illustrates the comparison of ED, HED1 and HED2
performance as a function of the SNR. Performance of HED1
and HED2 varies typically around 0 dB SNR but no visible
difference can be noted in extreme high or low SNR values.
Since there is a chance of mis-interpretation of noise plus
primary signal as only-noise samples (used to estimate the
noise variance) by ED in case of HED2, performance of HED2
is slightly lower than HED1 near 0 dB of SNR. By increasing
the number of slots used for the estimation of the noise
variance, the gap between HED1 and HED2 decreases and
both approaches approximate the known-variance ED curve.
The convergence of the hybrid approach of RLRT to an ideal
RLRT (known variance) is illustrated in Fig. 6. By increasing

The effect of the noise variance estimation uncertainty on
ED and RLRT algorithms is considered in Fig. 8. Assuming
the Gaussian distribution of the noise variance estimate with
mean equal to nominal value, the ROC for ED and RLRT is
plotted, setting var(ˆσ2
v) = 0.0032(−25dB). The result shows
that, for the same uncertainty of the noise variance estimate,
the performance gap between the ideal curve and the curve
with wrong variance is larger for ED as compared to RLRT.
Thus, it can be easily noticed that RLRT is more robust to
noise variance uncertainty as compared to ED algorithm.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the analysis of two semi-blind spectrum
sensing algorithms, ED and RLRT, is extended to hybrid ap-
proaches. Analytical expressions for the performance parame-
ters, Pd and Pfa, are derived for each algorithm. Analytical re-
sults are veriﬁed by Monte Carlo simulation and by numerical
methods. In addition, the impact of noise variance estimation
on ED and RLRT was carried out based on ROC curves. The
results showed that the ﬂuctuation of noise variance estimate
from nominal value is severe in case of small number of
auxiliary slots used for the estimation of the noise variance.
Moreover, for the same uncertainty on the noise variance
estimate, the performance gap between the ideal curve and
the curve with wrong variance is larger for ED as compared
to RLRT.
