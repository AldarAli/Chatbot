Abstract—The study and characterization of user behavior in 
the context of human computer interaction allows us to 
improve the design of interactive applications. Using certain 
sensors to analyze user behavior such as an eye tracking 
system can be intrusive and uncomfortable. In this paper, we 
report on an experiment to determine the minimum field of 
view that permits the user to perform an effective search task 
in a 3D virtual environment, by analyzing how the user 
controls the virtual camera. Our study exploits a model based 
on the use of several novel non intrusive temporal and 
quantitative measures of visual attention, such as: fixation, 
gaze, and movement. Seven out of ten measures gave 
significant results with the same findings.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The use of non intrusive visual attention measures to 
analyze users’ behavior in 3D virtual environments was 
originally proposed in our previous work [1]. Here, we 
extend this work by presenting more details about our study 
and its implementation in serious games.  
We commonly refer to the term “attention” to indicate 
the presence of important information. Attention is an ability 
function for selecting an object or stimulus among many 
others [2]. It describes the cognitive process of selectively 
concentrating on one aspect of the environment while 
ignoring others; it has also been defined as the allocation of 
processing resources [3]. 
Visual attention is the ability of a vision system, whether 
human or artificial, to quickly select the most pertinent 
information from the environment in which it operates [4]. 
Some diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, can currently 
be measured using attention measures, due to the fact that 
attention varies depending on physiological factors (e.g., 
fatigue and rest) or psychological factors (e.g., stress and 
motivation).  
The model presented in this paper was built during the 
design of Le Village aux Oiseaux. Le Village aux Oiseaux [5] 
is a therapeutic game for seniors who suffer from 
Alzheimer's disease. This game is designed to train the 
player’s attention network in order to decrease cognitive loss 
due to Alzheimer’s disease. The gameplay of Le Village aux 
Oiseaux has been developed as a 3D FPS (First Person 
Shooter) video game. The player takes the role of a 
photographer who helps the inhabitants of a small town to 
prevent the destruction of their town. The player’s mission is 
to take pictures of birds: they aim to fix a target (bird) on the 
screen and press a button to validate. FPS games, however, 
are usually designed for young male gamers; certain 
modifications are needed to make these games accessible for 
seniors.  
In order to provide such training, a major challenge is to 
know whether our player is focused on the game and to have 
an approximation of how high his/her attention capabilities 
are. Having such data allows us to (1) help the player to 
concentrate by adding special events (e.g., visual and sound 
effects) in the game, (2) modify the game difficulty to adapt 
to the player. 
Taking into consideration the physiological and the 
behavioral manifestations such as electro-dermal activity, 
heart rate, blood pressure, electromyographic activity, and 
encephalographic activity allows us to analyze user behavior. 
Currently, these signals are measured by sensors such as 
ECG, EEG sensors, or eye trackers.  
Eye tracking has been used to measure visual attention 
for many years. It is the process of using sensors to localize 
the position and the behavior of the eyes. Eye trackers work 
with micro-cameras that focus their targets on both eyes and 
record their movements when the user fixes his/her attention 
on a stimulus. They capture the contrast between the pupil 
and the retina using a projection of infrared light by 
analyzing the light reflected by the cornea of the human eye. 
Thus, from an initial calibration, the eye tracker can analyze 
eye movements from top to bottom and left to right. An eye 
tracking system helps us to determine what a person is 
looking at, what he/she is not looking at, but also what 
he/she does and does not pay attention to. Through eye 
tracking systems we can provide many visual attention 
measures, such as: fixation, gaze, and movement, in order to 
analyze users’ ocular behavior. 
A principal means of interacting with 3D VEs (Virtual 
Environments), in the case of video games, for example, is 
the use of the virtual camera, which is relatively easy to 
access and manipulate via game engines. The use of this 
virtual camera can show interesting results for non invasive 
study and characterization of user’s behavior - especially in 
the absence of eye tracking systems, which can sometimes 
be unavailable.

Our work is focused on the FOV (Field of View) effect 
of the virtual camera for determining the minimum FOV that 
allows users to perform an effective search task in a 3D VE. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II presents related work. Section III describes our 
experiment that analyzes user behavior in a 3D VE via the 
virtual camera. Section IV summarizes our paper and 
provides an outlook for future work.

RELATED WORK 
Gaming is an increasingly prevalent cultural pastime [6], 
and today the video game is one of the most popular types of 
software applications in the world. More than half of all 
Americans play video games, for example [7][8]. Analyzing 
user behavior allows us to monitor the cognitive status of 
users while they play video games. We can, for example,  
determine phases during which the player is motivated or 
bored, in order to give information to game designers, 
allowing them to improve the design of their game by 
identifying, the areas of interest that attract the player’s 
attention.  
Video games can provide a framework for testing many 
types of attention measures [9], e.g., playing video games, 
such as Pac Man, can improve the reaction times of older 
adults [10]. An action game can improve visual/attentional 
skills, a strategic game can improve the skills of executive 
control, and a puzzle game can enhance certain spatial skills 
[9].  
Numerous studies, both academic and industry-based, 
have been conducted to analyze user behavior. Le Village 
aux Oiseaux has been inspired by a study by Green and 
Bavelier. Their study shows that action games, particularly 
FPS games, improve the attention network of their players 
[6].  
Attention measures can be applied in serious games that 
are primarily tools for learning, e.g., we can imagine an 
artificial 
intelligence 
that 
adapts 
with 
the 
game’s 
environment based on user behavior. According to Guardiola 
et al., a serious game is a rule-based formal system with a 
variable and quantifiable outcome, where different outcomes 
are assigned different values; the player exerts effort in order 
to influence the outcome and feels attached to that outcome. 
Specifically, however, a serious game is combined with a 
defined real life objective [11]. This definition is based on 
the classic definition of games given by Juul [12].  
Games are designed to be pleasurable and interesting 
activities; games provide a powerful means of inspiring 
motivation in users. Generally, games are played for the sake 
of playing them. By contrast, therapeutic activities are 
designed to maximize their efficiency. 
The McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern 
Medicine1 proposes this definition of therapy: “A general 
term for any form of management of a particular condition, 
treatment intended and expected to alleviate a disease or 
disorder; any technique of recovery, which may be medical, 
psychiatric, or psychological.” The dictionary also proposes 
a list of more than two hundred different therapies. Some of

them are very general (e.g., physical therapy), while others 
are very specific (e.g., Nicotine replacement therapy). Le 
village aux Oiseaux aims to reduce the effects of Alzheimer's 
disease by training the patient’s attentional network [5].  
Early identification of cognitive decline is used in 
geriatric 
medicine 
to 
identify 
imminent 
functional 
impairment and/or to help delay disease progression 
[13][14][15], e.g., an adaptive intelligent computer game can 
be used to make an attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
diagnosis [16].  
During everyday interactions, our eyes provide a lot of 
information that reflects our emotional and mental states. 
Eye movement data reflect moment-to-moment cognitive 
processes during task execution [17]. Any given image 
contains multiple elements and the human eye fixes much 
more on some elements while others may receive little 
attention; when we look at an object in space (e.g., a wall 
with windows and doors), our eyes concentrate much more 
on some parts of this object (e.g., one of the windows), while 
the other parts of the object may receive less attention [18]. 
Studying ocular behavior in the context of human 
computer interaction (e.g., web browsing or video games 
[19][20][21][22]), allows us to identify and provide many 
indicators that can be used to evaluate user attention in order 
to improve the design of an user interface such as, for 
example, a digital library [23]. 
Much research has been conducted towards the study of 
ocular behavior during playing video games. Players of FPS 
video games concentrate their attention on one region of the 
game’s environment, paying more attention to the center of 
the screen around the reticule because they shoot enemies 
through the reticule. By contrast, the attention area is larger 
in an adventure game because the player’s attention is not 
constrained by any specific area of the screen [24][25].  
There are many types of eye behaviors: fixation, being 
the moment when the eyes are relatively stationary, taking in 
or encoding information with a minimum duration of 100 
milliseconds [26]; saccade, being the eye movement that 
occurs between fixations with durations of approximately 
150–200 milliseconds [27]; and gaze, being the moment 
when the eyes look at a display element [28]. When we look 
at an object in a visual display, we may make many fixations 
on this object. The number of these fixations shows the 
importance of the display area. A large number of fixations, 
however, can also reflect a poorly designed interface [28]. 
Some researchers use a positive score for each correct 
fixation in the environment, in order to examine user 
performance, by asking users to fix on specific objects in the 
environment among other objects (obstacles) [4]. 
To study user behavior in a 3D VE, a common approach 
is to ask users to complete search task in order to know how 
he/she interacts with the 3D VE [29], e.g., users may have to 
find objects that have specified numbers displayed on them 
[21], or to find a maximum number of hidden keys 
distributed in a 3D VE [30]. 
Our idea was to use the virtual camera of a 3D VE to 
examine several visual attention measures, such as: fixation, 
gaze and movement. The use of the 3D VE’s virtual camera 
provides an indirect method for analyzing the effect of FOV

on user behavior, given that the useful FOV is the total area 
of the visual field within which individuals can obtain useful 
information without moving their heads or eyes [31][32]. 
In order to study and characterize user behavior in a 3D 
VE through the virtual camera, we selected several visual 
attention measures employed by Gibbs et al. [19]. The 
measures selected are expressed by the number of fixations, 
fixation duration, and gaze duration. We also introduced new 
measures to give more information about how the user 
performs an effective search task in our 3D VE. The 
measures that we added are expressed by: the number of 
gazes, the number of movements, the movement duration, 
the sum total duration of all fixations per task, the sum total 
duration of all gazes per task, the sum total of all movements 
per task, and the total duration of each task. 
The principal motivation of this work is to build a novel 
method for non invasive study and characterization of user 
behavior in 3D VE (e.g., Le village aux Oiseaux), in order to 
show how users interact within 3D VE with a small FOV 
(Field of View). Our goal was to examine the FOV effect of 
the virtual camera on user behavior, and to determine the 
minimum FOV that allows the user to perform an effective 
search task in a 3D VE [1]. FOV size is very important for 
rapid extraction and identification of information in a 3D 
VE. The effective search task, in the context of our 
experiment, consists of a simple navigation within the 3D 
VE for the purpose of finding all objects (e.g., hidden 
buttons distributed around the VE) using: the least possible 
number of fixations and the shortest fixation duration; the 
least possible number of gazes and the shortest gaze 
duration; the least possible number of movements and the 
shortest movement duration; the shortest sum total duration 
of all fixations per task; the shortest sum total duration of all 
gazes per task; the shortest sum total duration of all 
movements per task; and the shortest total duration of each 
task. Our results provide information that can be of benefit to 
game designers, allowing them to improve gameplay, 
manage the difficulty of game environments, and optimize 
the distribution of visual resources. 
III. 
EXPERIMENT 
Gibbs et al. used an eye tracking system to determine 
whether ocular behavior differs between newspaper websites 
and TV-oriented websites. They used several visual attention 
measures to test ocular behavior, such as: number of 
fixations, fixation duration, and gaze duration. Within the 
contest of FPS video games, our research uses these 
measures employed by Gibbs et al., as well as our own 
measures to analyze user behavior, using the VE’s virtual 
camera instead an eye tracker. The aim of our experiment is 
to determine the minimum FOV that permits the user to 
perform an effective search task in a 3D VE, and to generate 
knowledge for game designers that can help them manage 
and adapt the difficulty of a 3D VE according to user 
behavior [1].  
The users in our experiment use a mouse and a keyboard 
to manipulate the virtual camera of our 3D VE as they would 
in a FPS video game (e.g., Half Life, Counter Strike). The 
measures employed in our experiment, consist of various 
types, such as: fixation, being a short pause in movement, 
represented quantitatively by the Number of Fixations (NF) 
and temporally by the Fixation Duration (FD), which vary 
between 100 and 300 milliseconds; gaze, which is the time 
spent looking at a display object, represented by the Number 
of Gazes (NG) and the Gaze Duration (GD), which starts 
from 300 milliseconds; the movement between two fixations 
or gazes, represented by the Number of Movements (NM) 
and the Movement Duration (MD), which starts from 100 
milliseconds. 
We also added four measures to those specified above: 
the Sum Total Duration of all Fixations per task (STDF), the 
Sum Total Duration of all Gazes per task (STDG), the Sum 
Total Duration of all Movements per task (STDM), and the 
Total Duration of each task spent by the user to complete the 
required task (TD).  
A total of 14 volunteers (10 male and 4 female) 
participated in this experiment. Their ages varied between 25 
and 42 years, with a mean of 30. All participants are right- 
handed, healthy, and have normal or corrected-to-normal 
vision. The experiment was performed on a desktop personal 
computer (Intel 3 GHz Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM) running 
Windows 7 Professional, with an LCD display with a 
resolution of 1920×1040 pixels. 
A. Procedure 
The purpose of the following experiment is to compute 
visual attention measures and to study the FOV effects on 
user behavior during a visual search task in a 3D VE. Fig. 1 
shows our 3D VE, which is a virtual art gallery similar to the 
static environment of Lee et al. [21]. We used the Unity3D 
game engine version 3.5 to create our 3D VE, including all 
the objects and the buttons. The virtual camera is positioned 
at the level of the eyes of the user’s avatar.

The participants were first invited to complete a short 
form to provide information including their name, age, 
gender, and whether or not they often play FPS video games.  
Secondly, the participants were asked to perform a free 
navigation in the 3D VE with a FOV of 80°, simply

navigating in the 3D VE and observing the virtual objects 
using the mouse and the keyboard to control navigation 
motion. This step was created as a training phase to learn 
manipulation of the virtual camera. The participants used the 
mouse to change the orientation of the virtual camera (yaw 
and pitch angles) and the keyboard to move the virtual 
camera. We used an ‘AZERTY’ format keyboard with the 
following key mapping: Z: forward, S: back, D: right, Q: left. 
Finally, the participants were asked to perform a visual 
search task to find and validate hidden buttons in the 3D VE. 
They had to find ten buttons randomly distributed on the 
surfaces of objects in the 3D VE (each object in our VE 
contains one hidden button).  
Each participant had to find all the hidden buttons using 
the reticule area (a rectangle 250×150 pixels situated in the 
center of the screen), and validate them by pressing the 
Space key. A number is displayed at the top left of the screen 
to indicate how many hidden buttons are left.  
The participant was asked to repeat the search task six 
times, knowing that we had changed the positions of all the 
objects and buttons, as well as the FOV size of the virtual 
camera before each of the six attempts at the task (10° for the 
first attempt, 20° for the second, 30° for the third, 50° for the 
fourth, 80° for the fifth, and 110° for the sixth attempt). The 
order of the attempts was randomized for each of the 
participants in order to eliminate the adaptation effect.  
The purpose of changing the FOV size (i.e., from 10° to 
110°) was to discover how FOV affects user behavior and to 
determine the minimum FOV that enables the user to 
perform an effective search task in a FPS type 3D VE, given 
that the default FOV in a FPS game ranges from 75° to 110°. 
Each one of our visual attention measures was computed 
for each attempt in real time and was recorded for a 
posteriori analysis.  
Fig. 2 shows our 3D VE using four different sizes of 
FOV. We can see that the navigation with a FOV of 10° (see 
Fig. 2.a) can be difficult, because the size of FOV is very 
small compared to the other sizes of FOV (e.g., 30°, 80°, or 
110°).

B. Results 
A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was 
conducted to see whether the FOV of the virtual camera 
affected user behavior during the search task in our 3D VE. 
A total of 14 subjects took part in the experiment. We sought 
to discover whether there is a significant difference between 
the measures that we obtained by changing the FOV size 
between 10°, 20°, 30°, 50°, 80°, and 110°. We expressed our 
measures by way of a natural logarithm and tested the 
measures’ normality using the Shapiro Wilk test [33]. Then, 
we used the ANOVA test to analyze the variance between all 
our measures. We note that, for our statistical analysis, we do 
not take into account the random spatial distribution of 
objects, nor the random order of the tasks. 
Table I shows the means, standard deviations, and 
analyses of variance of all our measures. Our ANOVA 
results show a significant difference between certain 
measures used in our experiments when we changed the 
FOV; such as: the Number of Fixations (NF), the Number of 
Gazes (NG), the Number of Movements (NM), the Sum 
Total Duration of all Fixations (STDF), the Sum Total 
Duration of all Gazes (STDG), the Sum Total Duration of all 
Movements (STDM), and the Total Duration of each task 
(TD). However Fixation Duration (FD), Gaze Duration 
(GD), and Movement Duration (MD) do not show any 
significant difference.  
 
Impact of FOV on the Total Duration of each task 
(TD): We observed that the TD decreases when the 
FOV increases (see Fig. 3). The boxplot presents the 
TD means of all participants in the six sizes of FOV. 
We found that the TD becomes convergent from a 
FOV of 30°. We also found that there was not much 
change in user behavior when he/she used a FOV of 
30°, 50°, 80° or 110°; however, a FOV of 10° or 20° 
shows a lot of change in user behavior. For example, 
users took a long time to complete the task when 
they used a FOV of 10° or 20°, while they took less 
time when they used other FOVs. 
 
Impact of FOV on the Number of Fixation (NF): We 
also observe that the NF measure decreases when the 
FOV increases (see Fig. 4).

The decrease in the NF measure allows us to note 
that the users of our application reduce their number 
of fixations as the FOV increases. This is because a 
large FOV offers a larger view of the environment 
and affords users comfortable navigation for 
performing the required search task. 
 
Impact of FOV on the Sum Total Duration of 
Fixations (STDF): We also found that the STDF 
becomes convergent from a FOV of 30° (see Fig. 5).

 
Impact of FOV on the Number of Gazes (NG): The 
NG in the fourth task (FOV = 50°) was high 
compared with the third, fifth, and sixth tasks 
(respectively: FOV = 30°, 80°, 110°). This is 
because users had difficulty in finding the hidden 
buttons in this task (see Fig. 6).

 
Impact of FOV on the Sum Total Duration of Gazes 
(STDG): We observed that the STDG in the sixth 
task (FOV = 110°) was high compared to the fifth 
task (FOV = 80°), due to the use of a large FOV (see 
Fig. 7).

Impact of FOV on the Number of Movements (NM): 
We also found that the NM in the fourth task (FOV 
= 80°) was high compared with the third, fifth, and 
the sixth tasks (respectively: FOV = 30°, 80°, 110°) 
(see Fig. 8). We can note also that the users needed 
fewer movements to accomplish the required task 
when they used a large FOV offering a large view of 
the environment. Consequently, users can perform 
the required search task quickly when they use a 
large FOV.

 
Impact of FOV on the Sum Total Duration of 
Movements (STDM): The boxplot presents the 
STDM means of all participants in each of the six 
sizes of FOV. We observed that there is a user in the 
third task (FOV = 30°) that is out the boxplot. This is 
because the user had difficulty in manipulating the 
virtual camera (see Fig. 9).  
As we noted above, we observed also that the STDM 
measure decreases as the FOV increases. This result 
allows us to observe that users need less movement 
time to accomplish the required visual search task in 
our 3D VE when they use a large FOV.

 
Difference between the video game players and the 
non-video game players using the Total Duration of 
each task (TD): After analyzing all our subjects 
without taking into consideration their video games 
experience, we divided our subjects into two 
categories: Video Game Players (VGP) and Non-
Video Game Players (NVGP). Fig. 10 shows a 
comparison between the video game players and the 
non-video game players using the TD measure. We 
found that the non-video game players took more 
time than the video game players to achieve the 
required visual search task.  
The video game players performed better that the 
non-video game players in our 3D VE. 
We can also see that the FOV for the video game 
players became more stable using a size of 50° (see 
Fig. 10), allowing us to observe that video game 
players need a minimum FOV of 50° to perform an 
effective visual search task in our 3D VE. We also 
notice much less variance in the results from the 
video game players.

 
The minimum Field of View (FOV) for user search 
task in 3D Virtual Environment (VE): To determine 
the minimum FOV that allows the user to conduct an 
effective search task within our 3D VE, we 
performed another Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
that examined all our visual attention measures 
between each pair of FOV that we used in our 
experiment.  
We defined two groups of FOVs according to visual 
attention measure values: Group 1, with FOVs of 
10° and 20°, and Group 2 with FOVs of 30°, 50°, 
80°, and 110° (see Fig. 11). The results of this 
ANOVA do not show a significant difference 
between a FOV of 10° and a FOV of 20° 
(p=0.0585), but they do show a significant difference 
between a FOV of 10° and a FOV of 30° 
(p=0.015*), 50° (p=0.012*), 80° (p=0.011*), and 
110° (p=0.0002***). The ANOVA results also show 
a significant difference between a FOV of 20° and a 
FOV of 110° (p=0.005**), but they do not show a 
significant difference between a FOV of 20° and 
other FOVs. Finally, this ANOVA shows that there 
is no significant difference between FOVs of 30°, 
50°, 80°, and 110°.  
Our visual attention measures become convergent 
from a FOV of 30°. We found that our subjects in 
Group 1 were slower than in Group 2 because they 
performed the visual search task quicker, with: the 
least possible number of fixations, the least possible 
number of gazes, the least possible number of 
movements, the shortest sum total duration of all 
fixations per task, the shortest sum total duration of 
all gazes per task, the shortest sum total of all

C. Discussion 
As evidenced by other studies, eye tracking systems have 
been used to measure visual attention for many years. These 
systems have provided many visual attention measures, such 
as fixation, gaze, and movement, for the purpose of 
analyzing users’ ocular behavior. They have also proved 
useful for evaluating the design of interactive applications.  
However, the use of this type of sensor can be intrusive, 
e.g., users of video games prefer to be comfortable while 
they are playing, making sensors like eye trackers, EEG, or 
ECG sensors unsuitable for use with video games. 
The use of an indirect method – for monitoring users of 
video games, for example – can offer advantages for the non-
intrusive study of user’s behavior and for improving the 
design of interactive applications, such as navigation in a 3D 
virtual environment. 
 Our model uses a novel non intrusive technique for the 
study and characterization of user behavior in a 3D virtual 
environment, by analyzing how the user controls the virtual 
camera. Our model can also help with determining the 
performance level of users when they perform a visual 
search task in 3D VE.  
Upon analyzing our results, we found that the Field of 
View (FOV) of the virtual camera in our 3D Virtual 
environment (VE) can affect user behavior when he/she 
performs a visual search task within the VE.  
The FOV size had a significant effect on user behavior 
during our experiment. We notice that in Table I there is a 
significant difference between the results based on most of 
our measures: the Number of Fixations (NF), the Number of 
Gazes (NG), the Number of Movements (NM), the Sum 
Total Duration of all Fixations (STDF), the Sum Total 
Duration of all Gazes (STDG), the Sum Total Duration of all 
Movements (STDM), and the Total Duration of each task 
(TD). This difference between these measures is due to the 
change in the FOV (i.e., between 10°, 20°, 30°, 50°, 80°, and 
110°), where we observe that the FOV affects user behavior 
during navigation within a 3D VE.  
We note that these measures decrease as the FOV 
increases, e.g., the NF mean value for all the subjects had a 
natural logarithm of 2.15 when we used a FOV of 10°, and 
this NF decreased to 1.57 when we used a FOV of 110°. 
Additionally, the NG mean value for all subjects had a 
natural logarithm of 1.93 when we used a FOV of 10°, and 
this NG decreased to 1.40 when we used a FOV of 110°. We 
observe also that the NM mean value for all our subjects had 
a natural logarithm of 2.35 when we used a FOV of 10°, and 
this NM decreased to 1.79 when we used a FOV of 110°. We 
found also that the STDF decreased as the FOV increased, 
where the STDF mean value for all the subjects had a natural 
logarithm of 4.37, and this STDF decreased to 3.78 when we 
used a FOV of 110°. The STDG mean value for all the 
subjects had a natural logarithm of 4.83, and this STDG 
decreased to 4.30 when we used a FOV of 110°.The STDM 
mean value for all subjects had a natural logarithm of 4.79, 
and this STDM decreased to 4.26 when we used a FOV of 
110°. Finally, the TD mean value for all subjects had a 
natural logarithm of 5.20, and this TD decreased to 4.69 
when we used a FOV of 110°. The decrease is important for 
determining the FOV within which one can navigate 
effectively within a 3D VE.  
As for Fixation Duration (FD), the Gaze Duration (GD), 
and the Movement Duration (MD), Table I does not show 
any significant difference in these visual attention measures. 
This shows that our users use stable and constant durations 
when performing the visual search task. We can also note 
that FOV size does not affect these types of visual attention 
measures in our 3D VE.  
The ANOVA preformed on each pair of FOVs allows us 
to define two groups of FOVs according to measure values: 
Group 1, with FOVs of 10° and 20°, and Group 2 with FOVs 
of 30°, 50°, 80° and 110°, given that there is not a significant 
difference between a FOV 10° and a FOV 20°; and between 
a FOV 30°, 50°, 80°, and 110°; but that there is a significant 
difference between a FOV of 10° and a FOV of 30°, 50°, 
80°, and 110°; and between a FOV of 20° and a FOV of 
110°.  
User behavior in Group 1 was less effective than user 
behavior in Group 2 because users in Group 2 performed the 
search task quicker with: the least possible number of 
fixations, the least possible number of gazes the least 
possible number of movements, the shortest sum total 
duration of all fixations per task, the shortest sum total

duration of all gazes per task, the shortest sum total of all 
movements per task, and the shortest total duration of each 
task. We found that these measures become convergent from 
a FOV of 30°. We note that the user can use a FOV of 30° as 
a minimum FOV for performing the search task in a short 
time with minimum movement of the virtual camera.  
We observe also that the user can perform an effective 
search task using this FOV of 30° in cases where we did not 
find much change in user behavior based on the virtual 
camera when he/she uses a large FOV, such as 80° or 110°. 
This shows that users in our experiment can perform an 
effective visual search task better when visual attention 
measures’ values are smaller. 
Finally, we showed also in Fig. 10 that the NVGPs spent 
more time than the VGPs to achieve a visual search task in a 
3D VE, and therefore we can deduce that the VGPs perform 
better on the required task than the NVGPs because the 
VGPs are accustomed to playing video games. We can also 
observe that the video game players’ ability to perform an 
effective search task seems to become more reliable and 
precise from a FOV of 50°.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have presented our experiment for 
determining the minimum field of view that permits the user 
to perform a search task in a 3D virtual environment using 
the virtual camera, which is accessible in all game engines. 
We used several novel non intrusive visual attention 
measures to monitor user behavior: the number of fixations, 
the fixation duration, the number of gazes, the gaze duration, 
the number of movements, the movement duration, the sum 
total duration of all fixations, the sum total duration of all 
gazes, the sum total duration of all movements, and the total 
duration of each task.  
Our results, which are based on the use of a virtual 
camera of a 3D virtual environment, show differences in user 
behavior resulting from differences in the field of view. 
The participants in our experiment could perform an 
effective search task better when the visual attention 
measures’ values were smaller. 
   We have shown that the field of view of the virtual 
camera affects user behavior during navigation within a 3D 
virtual environment to complete a visual search task.  
Our quantitative and temporal measures were evaluated 
by changing the field of view of the virtual camera. We 
found that the user needed less time to achieve his/her visual 
search task if he/she used a large field of view. We showed 
that the minimum field of view for performing an effective 
search task in a 3D virtual environment is 30°. Finally, we 
showed that video game players perform better in the 3D 
virtual environment. 
The results generated by our experiment could be 
usefully applied to the design of video games that are based 
in 3D virtual environments. 
For future work, we plan to increase the number of 
participants in our study and to test our model with a single 
category of users: video game players, which can give much 
more specific analysis (the obtained results using video game 
players had much less variance).  
We chose not to modify the color code of our 3D virtual 
environment in this study, as our 3D virtual environment was 
inspired by the static environment of Lee et al. [21], which 
used a dark plain color for the floor. We intend to consult a 
graphic designer/ergonomist in order to verify all the visual 
aspects of our 3D virtual environment. 
We plan to integrate an additional tool into our 
application to identify the regions of interest in our 3D 
virtual environment, using a video game, to provide 
additional information to game designers on how gameplay 
can be improved and difficulty managed by modifying the 
field of view of the virtual camera relative to difficulty level 
or the player’s needs.  
Finally, we also plan to test our model with Alzheimer’s 
patients in order to show how our model can be used in the 
service 
of 
cognitive 
rehabilitation: 
specifically, 
for 
facilitating search tasks and adapting the difficulty of a 3D 
virtual environment (e.g., Le Village aux Oiseaux is a 
therapeutic game for seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s 
disease).
