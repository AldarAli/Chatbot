Abstract—Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual 
Disabilities (ID) affect an increasing proportion of today’s 
population. Individuals with ASD/ID exhibit frequent forms of 
challenging behaviours such aggression and wandering off 
without warning. Wandering or elopement is common among 
such population and poses a great risk to the individuals and 
causes significant stress to their caregivers. Concurrent with 
wandering is sometimes anxiety and stress which may lead to 
disruptive challenging behaviours emerging from their varying 
internal 
emotional 
states 
and 
hyper-sensory 
to 
their 
surroundings. Caregivers and/or family members do need to 
keep track of such vulnerable population especially the ones 
with more severe autism/intellectual disabilities. The use of 
location tracking and emotional monitoring solutions can assist 
caregivers and family members by complementing their 
behavioural monitoring and intervention approaches. This 
paper reviews existing location tracking and physiological 
monitoring wearable products suited for this population. This 
can help caregivers and family members select suitable device 
for the person of concern taking account his/her unique user 
needs.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Autism 
Spectrum 
Disorder 
(ASD) 
is 
a 
neurodevelopmental condition characterised by deficits in 
reciprocal social interactions and communication skills, 
accompanied by restrictive and repetitive behaviours. 
Intellectual disability (ID), on the other hand, can be 
characterised by deficits in intelligence and adaptive 
behaviour that is at least two standard deviations below the 
mean of the general population. Individuals with ASD/ID 
exhibit frequent forms of challenging behaviours that reduce 
their well-being and quality of life. Individuals with ASD are 
at higher risk of developing challenging behaviours 
compared to the general population [1].  
One common kind of challenging behaviours is wandering 
and elopement. A recent research study reported that about 
half of children with autism spectrum disorder are prone to 
wandering [2] which can be very stressful for parents, 
particularly so for parents caring for children with 
developmental disorders, where the child’s ability to 
communicate with strangers may be impaired.  Also, it has 
been found that more than a quarter of children with 
developmental 
disabilities 
wander 
away 
from 
safe 
environments [3]. Further, researchers found that nearly a 
third of reported ASD missing person cases related to 
wandering/elopement from 2011 to 2016 in the United States 
ended in death or required medical attention [4]. 
Therefore, a mechanism that allowed parents and carers to 
track the locations of those individuals could have significant 
benefits and reduce risk. Secondly, such a device could 
potentially be used to monitor physiological signals which 
may correlate with internal emotional states, such as high 
levels of stress. This data may predict episodes of 
wandering/elopement, and could be used to ensure the 
intervention to reduce stress, or to identify their location in 
case being lost.  
Since external challenging behaviour such as wandering is 
accompanied with anxiety issues and varying emotions, it 
will be very useful for caregivers to monitor the internal 
physiological and emotional states of the care-receiver to 
help them understand what such individuals are experiencing 
in a real-time fashion. Building on such physiological 
information, caregiver can take necessary actions to help the 
individual calm down, in case he/she is experiencing stress, 
for example. Also, having a wearable device may help some 
individuals with autism spectrum disorder to increase their 
self-awareness of their internal emotional state and anxiety 
levels so that they can follow certain behavioural techniques 
and coping strategies to help them self-regulate their 
emotions [5]. This could be particularly useful for clients 
with comorbid alexithymia. 
This paper reviews commercial devices that can track 
location and physiological signals, with the potential for 
application to individuals with ASD/ID. Specifically, it 
presents the existing commercial solutions, compares their 
features and associated sensors, and comments on their 
effectiveness and open challenges for this application.  
II. 
ASD/ID AND THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS 
      ASD and ID are a broad spectrum of disorders ranging 
from mild to profound intellectual disabilities. Individuals 
with these conditions experience a full range of emotional 
states, which can be triggered by a variety of environmental 
and sensory cues, and internal experiences. For example, 
escalated levels of anxiety can potentially lead to what is 
called Challenging Behaviour. Challenging behaviour is 
defined as a culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such an

intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the 
person or others is likely to be placed in serious jeopardy [6]. 
Challenging 
behaviour 
include 
wandering/elopement, 
aggression, self-injury, property destruction, and tantrums. 
Prevalence rates as high as 94% have been reported for 
challenging behaviour in children with ASD [7]. Therefore, 
those individuals have unique needs. The widespread use of 
wearable technology offers an opportunity to help caregivers 
monitor and support such individuals. The use of wearable 
devices embedding sensing modalities such as location 
tracking and physiological sensing can offer a promising 
support for children and adults with ASD/ID who engage in 
challenging behaviour [5]. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
      A number of reviews of relevant literature have been 
published. For example, S. Majumder et al [8] conducted a 
review study on sensors used for remote monitoring for 
general 
population. 
The 
authors 
compared 
various 
physiological and activity monitoring solutions aimed for the 
elderly population. Specifically, separate comparative studies 
for wearable monitoring devices of cardiovascular system, 
body temperature, oxygen level parameters, and activity 
trackers were presented.  Another work focused on the 
wearable technology from clinical perspective such as 
wellness, safety, and home rehabilitation for older adults and 
individuals with chronic conditions was conducted by S. 
Patel et al [9].  
      More recently, there has been a focus of reviews on the 
application of wearable technology to specific populations 
which bring unique design and function needs. This is 
because some populations have different design and 
wearability requirements [5].  Example of such users are the 
ASD/ID population. According to a survey conducted by S. 
H. Koo et al [5], parents of individuals with ASD were 
particularly interested in being able to monitor their son or 
daughter’s physiological signals to understand anxiety levels 
and other emotions (72%). J. Cabibihan et al [10] surveyed 
the research literatures on different sensing technologies that 
are suitable for screening and intervention for ASD. Those 
sensing technologies were categorised into eye trackers, 
movement trackers, physiological activity monitors, tactile 
sensors, vocal prosody and speech detectors, and sleep 
quality assessment devices. The benefits and effectiveness of 
those devices in supporting the treatment of some symptoms 
of autistic individuals as well as their limitations were 
assessed. 
      According to S. H. Koo et al [5], tracking the 
individual’s activity or location is the third most requested 
information by parents of individuals with ASD after the 
emotional state and aiding of multi-step tasks. Also, M. T. 
K. Tsun et al conducted a review study on tracking devices 
in ASD population [11]. The authors investigated potential 
future assistive tracking solutions for children with 
cognitive disabilities. Various localisation techniques have 
been considered such as radio frequency, inertial 
measurement units, and Global Positioning System which 
can be utilised for indoor and outdoor localisation. 
      As it can be seen, existing review papers either: study 
wearable devices for general or elderly population [8], [9] 
focuses on the research prototypes designed for individuals 
with ASD or ID [10], or target the devices offering one 
functionality such as the work by M. T. K. Tsun et al [11]. 
To the author’s best knowledge, no consideration has been 
given to commercial solutions that enable emotional 
monitoring as well as location tracking devices. This paper 
focuses on devices that offer those two functions.  
IV. 
TECHNOLOGIES AND SENSING SIGNALS USED  
Building on the urgent need found in previous section, this 
section discusses the technologies and sensors used in the 
following subsections. 
A. Location Tracking Technologies 
Location tracking solutions use different technologies 
based on the required distance and the environment. For 
example, indoor monitoring devices can use accelerometer 
sensors, infrared tags, Bluetooth or WiFi wireless network 
available inside the building, or use a combination of 
technologies for more accurate tracking. Solutions targeted 
for outdoor location monitoring mostly use Global 
Positioning System (GPS) or cellular network service (such 
as GSM or third generation mobile communications).  
B. Physiological Sensing Technologies for Emotional 
Monitoring  
Emotional assessment for individuals with autism 
spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities can provide 
insights into the function of the challenging behaviour and 
supplement costly traditional observational approaches. 
Physiological monitoring is found useful to assess the 
varying emotional levels as it can be measured noninvasively 
[12]. Typical physiological signals used include: Heart Rate 
(HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Cortisol Level, 
Respiration Rate (RR), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Skin 
Temperature (ST), and Electromyography (EMG). Other 
potential technologies may be useful to apply, such as eye 
tracking, using ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) or brain 
signals but, due to the intrusive nature of the devices 
required for the individual with ASD/ID, they will be 
excluded in this study. It should be noted that various 
emotional states can be inferred from the measured values 
such as: low mood, high stress levels, agitation, excitement, 
and aggression.  
V. 
REVIEW OF EXISTING TRACKING AND MONITORING 
PRODUCTS 
      While the market is abundant with various products that 
are targeted for tracking and health monitoring of general 
population, there is a set of products that are designed 
specifically for individuals with autism and/or intellectual 
disabilities or can be adopted for this population. In this 
section, we provide a review of existing solutions listed for 
each category. The criteria for selection were: (1) devices 
that are designed specifically for individuals with ASD or 
ID, then (2) devices designed for general population but can

be adopted for ASD or ID population in terms of offering the 
functionality that delivers the service. Selected devices are 
consumer electronic device or medically approved ones. If a 
device is clinically validated, it is noted in the tables. 
This section gives an overview of the devices/solutions 
that can be used for monitoring the individuals with ASD/ID. 
Such solutions can be categorised into two groups: (a) 
solutions for tracking the location of the person of concern, 
and (b) solutions for monitoring the internal emotional state 
or physiological state identification. Those solutions will be 
reviewed in the following two subsections:        
A. Location Tracking Solutions 
      TABLE I. lists examples of related products. The 
following products are either commercially available in the 
market or still under development. For instance, Amber 
Alert GPS [13] is a tracking device that can be fitted in the 
backpack of the child or can be worn with a lanyard around

individual. Also, Angle Sense Location Tracker [26] is a 
GPS device that can be inserted into a sleeve that can be put 
in the pocket or in the interior of the clothing. Another 
device called Trackimo [21], from Trackimo, uses five 
tracking modules: GPS, GPS-A, GSM, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 
suitable for both indoor and outdoor tracking. Examples of 
other devices that can be attached to the person’s clothing 
are: Pocket Finder [27], Trax GPS Tracker [28], Securus 
eZoom and SPOT 3 Satellite GPS Messenger [18], Yepzon 
One [19], My Buddy Tag [20].  
      A recent acceptability study was conducted using 
questionnaires with individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder and their parents to see what types of devices they 
prefer to use. Accessories such as watches/wristband and 
bracelets have been found to be the most preferred wearable 
technology types [5]. Therefore, several companies have 
developed wristband/watch type devices such as FiLIP [29], 
for example, that can track the location of children both 
indoors and outdoors using GPS, GSM and WiFi with the 
ability to contact the caregiver in case of emergency. 
Another device is BeLuvv Guardian suited for short range 
tracking [23] that uses Bluetooth technology. Another 
product called, Trackimo GPS Track Watch, uses three 
ranges for tracking: GPS for outdoor, Wi-Fi for indoor 
tracking, and Bluetooth for short range tracking. 
      Smart clothing offers a seamless experience and thus 
can be used to track individuals with sensory sensitivities, 
who may not tolerate devices such as wristbands or watches. 
Furthermore, garments, such as t-shirts, have been found the 
second most preferred item for individuals with autism 
spectrum disorder [5]. Therefore, t-shirts and vests equipped 
with location trackers can be used to track those individuals 
by their parents or caregivers. Although most t-shirts with 
location tracking on the market are aimed for athletes, some 
may be adopted for individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder/intellectual disabilities. An example of those is 
Polar Team Pro that offers location and motion tracking 
sensors in addition to heart rate monitor [24]. Another one 
but still under development called D-Shirt by Cityzen 
Sciences which is also planned to measure heart rate, route, 
speed, and altitude [25].  
B. Emotional State Monitoring Solutions  
      The list of examples of physiological and/or emotional 
monitoring devices is presented in TABLE II. Wristbands 
and watches have also been the mainstream wearable device 
technology for physiological monitoring and emotional 
assessment. A brief description of the solutions/products is 
presented in the following paragraphs. 
      Simple consumer devices like Fitbit 2 can collect some 
physiological data such as heart rate. However, there are 
concerns pertaining to the reliability of such devices and 
their lack of capability to provide clinical data [30]. A more 
reliable solution which can provide more comprehensive 
physiological data is E4 Wristband from Empatica, Inc. 
which 
measures 
heart 
rate, 
heart 
rate 
variability, 
electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. However, this 
device can only collect raw physiological signals without

      More advanced solutions have been developed that use 
emotional identification algorithms to make meaningful 
information out of such data. For example, MyFeel 
wristband, from Sentio Solutions Inc [33], uses proprietary 
algorithms to process the data where it collects heart rate, 
electrodermal activity and skin temperature. 
 
      Another device that is still under development and 
targeted for the population with autism spectrum disorder 
called Reveal, from Awake Labs [34]. This device collects 
heart rate, electrodermal activity and skin temperature data 
to assess anxiety level of the individual and can notify the

caregiver when anxiety levels start to rise by applying data 
analytics techniques to make smart clinical decisions. 
Another more advanced solution called TouchPoints 
wristband and produced by TouchPoints Inc. [32]. This 
solution provides not only emotional monitoring but also 
claims to relieve stress using stimulating electrical pulses 
[44]. Other devices that can be worn include: BioHarness, 
Equivital Sensor Belt, Zepher belt and Hexoskin which is 
clinically validated to provide reliable ECG data. The last 
product listed is called AIO Sleeve, developed by Komodo 
Technologies but it is only a consumer device which does 
not provide clinical grade data.  
Recently, smart clothing is becoming the new trend for 
wearable devices especially for physiological monitoring 
and emotional assessment as it provides a seamless 
experience for the users compared to wristbands which can 
be obtrusive to some users. An example of such solutions is 
Hexoskin Smart Shirt, developed by Hexoskin Inc. [41], 
which incorporates fabric sensors that collect: ECG, heart 
rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and body 
movement data.  
The need to collect multiple data (e.g., physiological and 
positioning), based on the listed devices, may require the 
use of multiple devices which can cause inconvenience to 
the user. Thus, it is evident that having one device that can 
collect all relevant data (i.e., physiological, movement, and 
positioning) is more practical solution. EQ02 LifeMonitor, 
from Equivital Inc., offers this capability where it can also 
collect the previous parameters and has additional features 
including body movement and GPS location tracking 
system.  
VI. 
DISCUSSION 
The previous section has reviewed some existing or 
forthcoming products which are either designed for 
individuals with autism/intellectual disabilities or can be 
adopted for this population. 
It can be seen that most solutions provide either tracking 
or emotional monitoring which can be a drawback if they 
lack the other capability.  
As it was seen earlier, individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder /intellectual disabilities can exhibit different kinds 
of challenging behaviours such as wandering and anxiety at 
the same time.  From the reviewed products, it can be 
noticed that most commercial products can only offer one 
type of tracking. However, it would be more useful to 
inform the caregivers of the internal emotional state of the 
individual which may precede wandering so that they can 
take preventative measures to avoid harm for the individual 
or being exposed to unsafe environment. One listed device 
called, EQ02 LifeMonitor, is equipped with sensors that can 
provide the two functionalities. Using such a solution, 
clinicians and caregivers can objectively identify what the 
individuals with ASD/ID are experiencing physiologically, 
which could help in understanding the internal emotional 
state and the contexts and locations in which such behaviour 
is exhibited or escalated levels of anxiety are developed. 
From technical perspective, the target solution can use the 
unlicensed Bluetooth Low-Energy Protocol to transmit the 
physiological and positioning data to a remote recipient 
(e.g., smart phone) when the data can be processed locally 
in the wearable device and the useful information is only 
sent intermittently to the recipient to reduce the 
communication 
overhead 
and 
minimise 
the 
power 
consumption. It should be noted that other sensing 
modalities can include sound sensor and light sensor which 
can be useful to detect verbal aggression which is another 
kind of challenging behaviour.  
VII. 
   CONCLUSION 
In this work, we conducted a review on commercially off 
the-shelf wearable devices suitable for monitoring and 
tracking individuals with autism spectrum disorder and/or 
intellectual disability. Specifically, we briefly explained the 
unique issues that those individuals experience such as 
challenging behaviours. Then, we reviewed the related 
physiological, behavioural, and location related sensors that 
can be used to monitor the internal emotional state, their 
activities, and track their location. After that, we surveyed 
the existing and emerging products in the market with 
various form-factors, examined their usefulness in practice, 
and talked about lessons learnt and their shortcomings.
