Abstract—Cooperative spectrum sensing has been shown to 
enable Cognitive Radio (CR) networks to reliably detect 
licensed users and avoid causing interference to licensed 
communications. However, the performance of the scheme can 
be severely degraded due to presence of malicious users 
sending false sensing data. In this paper, we propose trust 
model-based cooperative sensing techniques to reduce the 
harmful effect of malicious users in cooperative sensing process. 
First of all, analysis model of anomalous behavior is devised to 
identify 
the 
malicious 
users. 
Then 
we 
employ 
PID 
(Proportional-Integral-Derivative) like controller to calculate 
the credit value of nodes, which is used as the weight of WBD 
(Weighted Bayesian Detection) to make spectrum decision. 
Simulation results demonstrate that, comparing with the 
existing methods, the proposed scheme performs better 
especially in the case that there exist a large number of 
malicious nodes.

Sensing; Trust Model; Weighted Bayesian Detection.

INTRODUCTION 
Cognitive radio (CR) techniques provide the capability to 
use or share the spectrum in an opportunistic manner, which 
is proposed to solve current spectrum inefficiency problem 
[1]. In CR networks unlicensed users (secondary users, SUs) 
detect spectrum environment and utilize the idle spectrum 
while tolerable interference is guaranteed to the licensed 
users (primary users, PUs). 
For CR networks, reliable spectrum sensing is an 
important step for any practical deployment. SUs should 
identify the presence of PUs over wide range of spectrum 
accurately without significant delay. This process is very 
difficult as we need to identify various PUs adopting 
different modulation schemes, data rates and transmission 
powers in presence of variable propagation losses, 
interference generated by other secondary users and thermal 
noise. Traditionally there are three spectrum sensing 
techniques, viz., energy detection, matched filter detection 
and cyclostationary feature detection [2]. If SUs are lack of 
knowledge about the characteristics of PU signal, energy 
detection is the optimal choice with the least complexity and 
generally adopted in recent research work. However, the 
performance of energy detection is always degraded because 
of signal-to-noise ratio wall or channel fading/shadowing [3]. 
Cooperation among SUs follows almost as a necessary 
consequence of the above constraints. Cooperative spectrum 
sensing has been shown to greatly increase the probability of 
detecting the PUs [4-6]. Each SU executes spectrum sensing 
by itself and sends the ―local‖ spectrum sensing information 
to a DC (Data Collector) which uses an appropriate data 
fusion technique to make final spectrum sensing decision. 
Since a DC utilises not only its own observations as a 
basis for decision making but also the observations of others, 
it is the obviously need to authenticate the shared 
observations. The DC needs to judge whether the 
observations from others are real or falsified. This is critical 
to prevent degradation of the network performance because 
of malicious behavior and to protect against the Byzantine 
attack. The Byzantine attack represents the case where a 
friend or acquaintance has, unbeknownst to the CR, become 
an adversary and represents the most difficult subset of this 
problem space. The Byzantine failure problem can be caused 
by malfunctioning sensing terminals or MUs (Malicious 
Users). They transmit false information instead of real 
detection results, which adversely affects the global decision.  
This problem has been discussed in [7-9], and several 
methods were proposed to reduce the impact of false 
information. But these proposals failed when the proportion 
of MUs increased. In this paper, we investigate techniques to 
identify the nodes which provide false sensing information, 
and nullify their effect on the cooperative spectrum sensing 
system. By analyzing the behaviors of SUs in cooperative 
sensing, DC can establish trust model with PID 
(Proportional-Integral-Derivative) like controller [10], which 
can acquire relatively high speed to track the behaviors of 
neighbors. At last, we use a fusion technique called WBD 
(Weighted Bayesian Detection) derived from Bayesian 
detection to make spectrum decision. Simulation results 
show that this method improves the robustness of data fusion 
against attacks even when a large proportion of malicious 
users exist.  
In Section II, we define the system model. In Section III, 
the proposed cooperative detection scheme is described in 
detail. Simulation results and analysis are illustrated in 
Section IV, and finally, a conclusion is given in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL  
In an ad hoc CR network, we consider a group of N 
second users in the presence of a primary user working on K 
different channels. The channels of PU and SUs use the 
HATA model for rural environments as the path loss model 
[11]. We assume perfect channel conditions for the control 
channel. Each of the SUs acts as a sensing terminal that is 
responsible for local spectrum sensing. The local detection 
results are reported to a DC that executes data fusion and 
makes the final spectrum decision. SUs use energy detector,

and the sensing report is local sensing decision which is a 
binary variable— ―1‖ denotes the presence of PU signal, and 
―0‖ denotes its absence. The data fusion problem therefore 
can be regarded as a binary hypothesis testing problem with 
two hypotheses represented by H1 and H0 (H1 means there 
exists primary user, and H1 means the channel is free). We 
consider three types of spectrum spoofing attacks: always-
false, always-busy and always-free. An always-false attacker 
always sends spectrum reports that are opposite to its real 
local sensing results, and an always-busy attacker always 
notifies spectrum to be busy while an always-free attacker 
always reports contrary results. 
III. 
TRUST MODEL-BASED SECURE COOPERATIVE 
SENSING  
This Section will detail a reactive protection mechanism, 
a trust model-based cooperation enforcement mechanism to 
improve robustness of data fusion technique. First of all, the 
anomalous behaviors of malicious users should be identified. 
We design two kinds of behavior analysis models to track 
the behaviors of SUs. Based on that observation, a sensing 
terminal’s reputation can be calculated with a PID-like trust 
model. Since the data fusion is a binary hypothesis testing 
problem, we propose a new technique called WBD to 
overcome the weakness of existing fusion techniques.  
A. Analysis of Anomalous Behaviors 
After receiving local reports of neighbors, DC should 
judge which one is believable, and make spectrum decision 
with appropriate reports. DC will get the ultimate sensing 
result U at the end of sensing period, which derives from i 
neighbors sensing k channels.

cik  0
 means 
that channel k is free. 
First of all, we focus on the analysis of abnormal sensing 
behaviors in single channel. 

 is the sensing

first m items are same, If 
m  i 2
，m nodes correspond to 
these items are judged to be normal while the others are 
malicious. Different kinds of users will be assigned 
corresponding credit values with the following algorithm in 
Section B. 
This is a kind of majority rule, which is feasible when the 
proportion of MUs is small. We consider CR networks with 
N SUs, among which M SUs are malicious. The false 
detection ratio with energy detection is  . The analysis of 
anomalous behaviors is effective under the condition

Since the correct detection ratio of energy detection is not 
ideal, the credit values of SUs calculated in single channel 
may not be assigned rightly (normal SU is regard as 
malicious node, whose credit value is decreased. v.v.). But in 
a sensing period multiple channels would be detected in the 
same way, and the credit value of each node will be updated 
in each channel. So the probability of miscalculation of 
credit value 
fP  could be shown as

Based on (2) (3), 
fP would be very small when the 
regulation of evaluating sensing nodes’ behavior is available, 
viz. the number of MUs is not more than SUs. (e.g., 
k 20

3.0
Q 

.0 016
fP 
). So we can make a 
conclusion that the 
majority rule at multi-channel 
environment is effective in identifying malicious users. 
When SUs have detected k channels in distributed 
manner in a sensing period, DC can deduce the numbers of 
available channels

from i different SUs

sensing report of node i. These numbers should be identical 
in theory, while difference always exists because of 
malfunction or intention of sensing nodes. For example, the 
number of available channels from the report of an always-
busy attacker would be zero. In order to identify malicious 
behaviors by analyzing the numbers of available channels, 
M should be amended using prior probability to eliminate 
the infection of malfunction. We can make use of a proposal 
devised in paper [7] to get the prior probability in different 
channels.

B. PID-Like Trust Model 
Considering that the sensing reports influence the   
allocation and accessing of spectrum resource directly, the 
credit values should track the behaviors of SUs rapidly in 
order to reduce the negative influence. On the other hand, 
energy detection is not ideal. Mistaken sensing reports may 
be send to DC by normal SUs which would be seen as 
malicious users. So the credit values should be modified in a 
smooth manner in order to avoid random mistake of normal 
SUs. We use a tuned PID controller in control systems to 
calculate the trust values of nodes [10]:

corresponding output. The right of the lower equation refers 
to the record of history about difference. According to the 
control theory, the input is zero order signal, and the 
controller can track the input in time and get no static 
difference. So this model can trace the behaviors of the 
neighbors at a higher speed and attain a smooth change of 
trust value. Based on (8) we can deduce

In addition, we define a threshold of trust value

time point, defined as the speed to trace the behaviors of

C. Weighted Bayesian Detection 
When DC has received sensing reports, it needs to 
employ an appropriate fusion technique to make an accurate 
spectrum sensing decision. We apply a likelihood ratio test 
named WBD on data fusion. WBD is based on Bayesian 
detection [12], which is a hypothesis test for sequential 
analysis.  
It requires the knowledge of prior probabilities of ir ’s 
when r is 0 or 1, i.e., 
r | H0
P i
and 
r | H1
P i
. It also requires 
the knowledge of a prior probabilities of r , i.e.,

SIMULATION  
A. Simulation Environments 
The simulation was run in MATLAB, and the same 
system environment with [7] was deployed to obtain 
comparable simulation results. The only difference was that 
we realized the simulation with multi-channel model. We 
compared three kinds of data fusion schemes, i.e., Bayesian 
detection, WBD and WSPRT [7]. We consider an ad hoc CR 
network with one PU as well as N SUs, among which M SUs 
are malicious. The primary user, a TV tower has twenty 
6MHz channels in TV band, and the duty cycle of all the 
channels is fixed at 0.2. It locates D meters away from the 
center of the CR network. N SUs locate in a 2000m×2000m 
square area randomly, and follow a random waypoint 
movement model with a maximum speed of 10m/s and a 
maximum idle time of 120s. The transmission range of SUs 
is 250m. Three types of malicious nodes (always-busy, 
always-false and always-free) are same with normal SUs 
except reporting forged sensing reports. The layout of the 
simulated network is shown in Figure 1.

. Another simulated fusion technique is WSPRT, 
the values of the parameters are the same with [7] except we 
deploy larger proportion of MUs. 
We compare the performance of the three data fusion 
techniques. The metrics are correct sensing ratio, miss 
detection ratio and false alarm ratio, which add up to one. So 
we just focus on the first two metrics. 
The number of malicious nodes increased from 0 to 100 
at an interval of 10 in the three different attacks. Figures 2-4 
show the simulation results when we consider always-busy, 
always-false and always-free attacks respectively. In all case, 
the correct sensing ratios of three types of data fusion 
techniques are more than 90% when the number of attackers 
is less than 30, which is acceptable based on the regulation of 
IEEE 802.22. But the performances diverge severely for the 
Bayesian detection with the number of MUs increasing, 
while the WBD is the most robust against attacks. The 
correct sensing ratios are above 80% with our proposed 
WBD under three types of attacks even the proportion of 
MUs is close to 1/3, while the miss detect ratios are 
acceptable at the same time. This shows that the trust model-
based weight scheme has taken effect. WSPRT [7] employs 
similar weighted scheme with different trust evaluation 
strategy. It can reduce false information to a certain extent. 
But the increasing of malicious proportion would disturb the 
weight assignation in WSPRT, and finally, it largely 
increases the false alarm ratio.  
  It can be observed in Figure 4(a) that all the data fusion 
techniques perform stable under always-free attack, which 
increase miss detection ratio and decrease false alarm ratio. 
Figure 4(b) shows that the miss detection ratio is larger than 
other attacks.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we design two analysis models to identify 
anomaly behaviors in cooperative sensing process, and a PID 
trust model is employed to assign the credit value of SUs 
which can trace and nullify the malicious nodes rapidly. 
Simulation results demonstrate that comparing with the 
existing method the proposed scheme performs better 
especially in the case that there exist a large number of 
malicious nodes. In the behavior analysis model and data 
fusion technique the prior probability values play a key role, 
but the calculation of that needs many priori messages about 
the CR networks which may limit the deployment of the 
secure cooperative sensing techniques.
