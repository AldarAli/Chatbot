Abstract— Underwater wireless communications present 
challenges due to the characteristics of water as a propagation 
channel medium. Regardless, wireless communications are 
needed for a range of systems that operate underwater. 
Commonly used technologies for these use cases (radio-
frequency, acoustic and optical communications) are lacking, as 
they generally suffer from strong attenuation, multipath effects 
and propagation delays. In this context, we explore the 
theoretical models for Path Loss of Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) systems underwater in regards to the 
salinity of the water. We also discuss RFID systems feasibility in 
such applications as aquaculture and fish stock management. 
This paper aims to discuss the theoretical transmission models 
for RFID systems underwater, separating them into near-field 
systems – which use Magnetic Induction (MI) to communicate – 
and far-field systems – that transfer data via Radio Frequency 
(RF). We determine the path loss for each case, the effect of the 
salinity in the model for the path loss, and present preliminary 
measurements of magnetic field strength underwater for 
different salinity values.

 INTRODUCTION 
 This paper is an extension of a previous conference 
submission [1].  Underwater wireless communications 
present some challenges due to the characteristics of the 
channel medium. The underwater environment has different 
characteristics and phenomena compared to those typical for 
terrestrial radio propagation channel [2]. Despite these 
difficulties, underwater wireless communications are needed 
for a variety of underwater systems. Practical applications 
include seismic activity monitoring, equipment monitoring 
and 
control, 
underwater 
wireless 
sensor 
networks, 
underwater robots and Underwater Autonomous Vehicles 
(UAVs), aquaculture, fish stock management and underwater 
environmental monitoring [3][4]. 
There are three commonly used technologies for 
underwater communications [2][5][6]. Radio-frequency (RF) 
communication consists of propagating electromagnetic 
waves, and it has high data rates at short ranges but suffers 
from multipath propagation, strong attenuation and Doppler 
effect [2]. Due to the increasing attenuation for higher 
frequencies, it requires that systems operate at lower 
frequencies to achieve longer ranges of transmission, which 
in turn demands the use of large antennas making it 
unsuitable for some applications. Acoustic communication 
makes use of propagating sound waves, which have low 
attenuation underwater, achieving the longest range [2]. 
However, this type of communication exhibits a large 
propagation delay due to the speed of sound underwater, 
suffers from multipath propagation, and is affected by a large 
delay spread that leads to inter-symbol interference. 
Temperature gradients and ambient noise are also problems 
for acoustic communications. Another technology that can be 
used for underwater use is optical communication, which 
uses electromagnetic waves in the visible spectrum to 
transmit data. Such technologies have large data rates with 
low propagation delay. However, they suffer severe 
absorption in water and strong backscatter due to turbidity 
(e.g., suspended particles in the medium) [2].  
Underwater Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is not 
an extensively explored topic due to the problems outlined 
above 
for 
RF 
communications, 
specifically 
strong 
attenuation and multipath propagation. However, some RFID 
systems communicate via Magnetic Induction (MI), which 
could provide an alternative for the existing technologies 
[4][7]. In this paper, we want to explore the potential for such 
technology to be used in the marine environment. We 
examine the different methods of communication that 
different RFID systems employ, separating them into two 
categories: 
near-field 
communication 
and 
far-field 
communication. Theoretical mathematical models exist for 
terrestrial 
RFID 
systems, 
from 
which 
the 
system 
functionality, communication properties and link budget can 
be derived. This paper aims to derive similar models for 
underwater RFID communications, by describing the 
underwater channel physical properties for near-field and far-
field electromagnetic fields by presenting the path loss for 
each. This can then be used to predict communication range, 
link budget and channel capacity.

This paper is organised as follows. Section II discusses 
the related work. In Section III, we give a brief overview of 
an RFID system and its components. Section IV then presents 
the model for underwater RFID for near-field and far-field 
communications. In Section V, we present preliminary 
results of measurements done of magnetic field strength in 
various water solutions of different salinity values. Section 
VI discusses underwater RFID in light of the theory presented 
and the measurement results. We conclude the paper in 
Section VII. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Underwater RFID is not a common topic due to the 
challenges that the underwater environment poses to RF 
communications. However, some preliminary work has been 
done. For example, [8] explores the use of Near-Field 
Communication (NFC) underwater. Using smartphones and 
smart cards operating at 13.56 MHz, they tested the read 
range achieved and the influence of dissolved salts in water 
in the read range. Another group used Low-Frequency (LF) 
RFID to track the sediment movements in a beach [9]. 
Transponders were coupled to pebbles, creating "smart" 
pebbles that could be detected at up to 50 cm underwater. 
They were then released into the beach and tracked to map 
the sediment movement. Systems that use LF RFID 
underwater can be found in Passive Integrated Transponder 
(PIT) tags used to uniquely identify fish in fisheries and 
research [10][11]. 
The authors in [12] summarised the current understanding 
of underwater RFID, examining the penetration depth in 
freshwater and seawater. However, the model presented is 
simplified and accounts only for the far-field operation. They 
also showcase other uses of RFID underwater, such as 
underwater pipeline monitoring. Other authors have explored 
MI 
communications 
underwater, 
where 
the 
system 
communicates via induction coupling. [13] provides an 
overview of the current research findings and challenges for 
MI. Models for MI can be found in [14]–[18].  
III. RFID SYSTEM 
A typical RFID system is comprised of a tag and a reader 
(initiator). The tag is used to identify or measure ambient 
parameters, typically temperature for instance [19]. 
Furthermore, a reader is used to read and write data from or 
into such tag located within its proximity or vicinity. The tag 
consists of a coupling or backscatter element such as a 
conductor loop or an antenna, and an RFID radio that stores 
the data or ultra-low-power embedded system to measure 
various ambient parameters and store relevant metadata. The 
reader also comprises similar antennas as a coupling element 
along with a control unit and an RFID radio. Generally, near-
field RFID uses inductive coupling between the reader and 
tag loop antennas to communicate with each other when 
located within each other’s proximity or vicinity. RFID 
operates at 120–135 kHz low frequency (LF) unregulated 
band and high frequency (HF) 13.56 MHz Industrial, 
Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. LF RFID follows the 
ISO/IEC 18000-2 standard and HF RFID follows ISO/IEC 
18000-3 standard along with additional smart cards ISO/IEC 
15693, ISO/IEC 14443A and 14443B standard [20]–[24][25, 
p. 
1][26]. 
Additional 
NFC 
standards 
ensure 
the 
interoperability of NFC-enabled devices and enable 
communication between them. The NFC standard defines the 
data rate (26.48 to 424 kbit/s), data frame formats such as 
NFC 
Data 
Exchange 
Format 
(NDEF), 
modulation, 
initialization, and collision control during initialization [27]. 
In Figure 1 the block diagram of a typical RFID sensing 
system is shown. The conductor loop antenna of the reader 
generates the magnetic alternating field. The magnetic flux 
(Φ) generated by the reader loop antenna is used as a power 
supply for the sensor tag. This is achieved by utilising the 
voltage which is induced in the tag antenna by mutual 
inductance (M) between the transmitter and receiver antenna. 
Due to this induced voltage, a current starts flowing in the tag 
antenna and its value can be theoretically calculated from the 
quotient of the voltage divided by the impedance of the tag 
antenna [28]. Furthermore, the NFC radio Analog Front End 
(AFE) consists of an RF interface and the energy harvesting 
circuitry, which will connect to the loop antenna. The 
harvested voltage will further be regulated using a low 
dropout regulator and will be used to power up an ultra-low-
power Microcontroller Unit (MCU), as well as a sensor [28]. 
The NFC radio consist of an Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) 
demodulator which will demodulate the messages from the 
reader and responds to the reader with the help of load 
modulation. The load modulation is achieved by varying the 
impedance of the tag antenna [28]. The NFC radio and sensor 
will be interfaced with MCU using the Inter-Integrated 
Circuit (I2C) Protocol. The sensor will start sensing a 
parameter and its raw value will be transmitted to the MCU 
through the I2C. The MCU will then generate an NDEF 
message with the sensed value and forward it to the NFC 
radio [19][29]. 
 
 
Figure 1. Block diagram of a RFID sensing system. 
 The tag receives the signal via the coupling element, and 
utilises the induced voltage to power up the tag’s RFID radio 
and other electronics. RFID radio then sends data back to the 
reader via load modulation or backscatter. In general, such a 
tag is battery-less, and it is powered by the Magnetic flux (Φ) 
generated by the reader. Other battery assisted power (BAP) 
system models exist incorporating an active RFID device that

consist of a battery as a power source. The added battery is 
used to power up additional tag electronics or sensors and to 
extend the communication distance range between the 
transmitter and receiver.  
Equation (1) shows the relationship between the quality 
factor of the antenna Q, the bandwidth (BW) and the resonant 
frequency (f) for the system. For example, larger bandwidth 
is required to cover the sidebands of communication for the 
ISO/IEC 14443B standard and is particularly important to 
have if using higher data rates such as 424 or 848 kbps. In 
addition, for other applications based on the ISO/IEC15693 
standard, the Q factor can be significantly higher, as the 
sidebands do not need such a wide bandwidth [30].

IV. RFID CHANNEL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
The antenna or coil of the RFID reader generates an 
electromagnetic field. These fields can be described as time-
harmonic fields in a lossy medium [31]:  
 
∇2𝑬 = 𝛾𝑬  
(2) 
∇2𝑯 = 𝛾𝑯  
(3) 
 
where γ is the propagation wave number, with α as the 
attenuation and β as the phase variables. The wavelength λ is 
λ=2π/β.

The magnetic permeability 𝜇 = 𝜇0 = 4𝜋 ⋅ 10−7H/m of 
the medium does not change for non-magnetic media. σ is the 
conductivity of the medium, which in this case is dependent 
on the salinity of the water, its temperature and pressure. The 
salinity of the water is proportional to the concentration of 
dissolved salts (chloride, sodium, sulphate, etc.). In marine 
water, the conductivity ranges from 2 S/m to 6 S/m for 
frequencies lower than 10 GHz, being considered constant 4 
S/m in most cases [12]. In freshwater, the considerations are 
the same. However, the salinity is lower, which means that 
the conductivity is lower (typically ranging from 30 to 2000 
μS/cm) [12]. Due to this high conductivity, Eddy currents are 
induced within the water, caused by the propagating magnetic 
field [32]. These Eddy currents are a source of attenuation of 
the magnetic field.  
The conversion between salinity and conductivity for 
seawater has been defined in the practical-salinity-scale PSS-
78 [33]. This scale defines a standard ratio between any 
measured combination of salinity, conductivity, and 
temperature in relation to a standard value of conductivity 
and temperature for seawater of salinity 35 g/Kg. 
  
Figure 2: Conductivity of pure, freshwater and seawater for different values 
of propagating frequencies. 
The dielectric permittivity of the medium ε is defined by 
𝜀 = 𝜀𝑟𝜀0, 𝜀0 = 8.854 × 10−12F/mbeing the permittivity in 
free-space and 𝜀𝑟 the relative permittivity of the medium. 
This relative permittivity is dependent on the composition of 
the medium that is polarised when placed under an electric 
field [34][35]. Equation (7) shows the relationship between 
the relative permittivity and the frequency of the propagating 
electromagnetic wave for pure water as modelled by Debye 
[35]. 
𝜀𝑟(𝜔) = 𝜀∞ +
𝜀𝑠−𝜀∞
1+𝑗𝜔𝜏  
(7) 
 
In this equation, τ is a time constant of the exponentially 
increasing orientation polarisation called relaxation time, and 
ε𝑆 and ε∞  are the static and infinite frequency relative 
permittivities of the medium. All these parameters are 
dependent on the temperature.  
However, for freshwater and seawater, due to the 
interaction between molecules and the presence of ions that 
increase the conductivity of the medium, the simple model is 
not enough to accurately predict the permittivity [34].  
For freshwater, there are extensive experimental studies 
and various models that predict the dielectric permittivity 
[36]–[40].  
Work has been done by [38][41]–[43] to empirically 
determine a model for the relative permittivity of seawater, 
but some results disagree with each other. The International 
Telecommunication Union released a recommendation [44] 
that advises the model to use when calculating the dielectric 
permittivity and conductivity of seawater based on its

this model.

The dielectric permittivity and the conductivity are then 
used to determine the attenuation factor α. In [45], the authors 
propose a review of this model to account for the difference 
between the theoretical calculations and the empirical data of 
the attenuation of radio waves underwater. The experiments 
show that the signal attenuation at higher distances (≫10 m) 
is not as strong as predicted. Therefore, they redefine α as a 
corrected absorption factor α' that matches experimental 
results closely:

For a given antenna, the space that surrounds it can be 
separated into three regions: (a) a reactive near-field, (b) a 
radiating near-field and (c) the far-field. There are no abrupt 
changes at their boundaries [46]. A representation of these 
regions can be seen in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4: Field regions for a propagating electromagnetic wave leaving an 
antenna. 
The Reactive Near-Field is the space immediately near 
the antenna where the reactive field predominates (magnetic 
field). For most antennas, the limit of this region is at 
0.62√𝐷3/𝜆 [46], where D is the biggest dimension of the 
antenna. The Radiating Near-Field is located between the 
reactive near-field and the far-field and is the space wherein 
radiation fields are dominant. The angular field distribution 
is determined by the distance from the antenna. This field 
existence depends on the ratio between antenna size D and 
the wavelength λ: if D/λ≪1 then this region does not exist. 
The Far-Field is the region wherein the electrical and 
magnetic components of the field become orthogonal to each 
other as they separate from the antenna and propagate as an 
electromagnetic wave. The lower boundary of this region is 
located at 2𝐷2 ∕ 𝜆 for any antenna [31], also considered to be 
λ/2π for dipole antennas. According to [28], a good 
approximate rule for RFID systems is to place the beginning 
of the far-field at λ/2π.  
The field boundary distance is different for each medium 
due to the difference in wavelength. Tables I and II show the 
values for the attenuation coefficient, wavelength, and far-
field boundary for freshwater and seawater, respectively. 
 Current RFID systems can be separated into two 
categories: near-field systems that work with inductive 
coupling due to the dominance of the magnetic field in the 
near-region, and far-field systems that receive power from the 
propagating electromagnetic waves in the far-field [47]. The 
frequencies used in each region are different. Since the lower 
frequencies – such as Low Frequency (LF) at around 
134.2kHz and High Frequency (HF) at 13.56MHz – have a 
far-field boundary that is further away, they are mainly used 
in inductive coupling systems. Higher frequencies are then 
used mostly in far-field systems.

A. Near-field 
In the near-field, the magnetic field created by the 
reader’s antenna induces a voltage in the transponder 
immersed in this field. This is called inductive coupling and 
the interaction between reader and transponder can be 
considered 
as 
coupled 
inductors. 
This 
method 
of 
communication can also be called Magnetic Induction (MI).  
Consider the equivalent circuit for the inductively 
coupled system shown in Figure 5. The transmitter antenna is 
fed by a source with internal impedance 𝑍𝑆 and the receiver 
antenna is terminated by a load impedance 𝑍𝐿 . The 
transmitter coil antenna has a impedance of 𝑍𝑇𝑋 = 𝑅𝑇𝑋 +
𝑗𝜔𝐿𝑇𝑋 + 1/(𝑗𝜔𝐶𝑇𝑋) and the receiver coil antenna is 𝑍𝑅𝑋 =
𝑅𝑅𝑋 + 𝑗𝜔𝐿𝑅𝑋 + 1/(𝑗𝜔𝐶𝑅𝑋).

where Φ21 = ∫ b𝐵 ⋅ 𝑑𝑺 is the magnetic flux through each 
turn, 𝑩 = 𝜇𝑯 the magnetic field and S the surface area of the 
coil. Considering that the reader’s and tag’s coils are aligned, 
and using (32): 
 
𝐵𝑧 = (
𝜇𝑁𝑎12𝐼
2(𝑎12+𝑧2)2/3) 𝑒−𝛼𝑧  
(34) 
 
Therefore, the mutual inductance 𝑀 = 𝑘√𝐿1𝐿2 is: 
 
𝑀 = (
𝜇⋅𝜋⋅𝑁1⋅𝑎12⋅𝑁2⋅𝑎22
2⋅(𝑎12+𝑧2)3/2 ) ⋅ 𝑒−𝛼𝑧  
(35) 
 
where α is the attenuation constant of the medium. 
The transmission power can be defined as the power 
consumed by the radiation resistance in the reader 
(transmitter) antenna:  
 
𝑃𝑇𝑋 =
1
2 𝑅𝑒(𝑍11) ⋅ |𝐼1|2  
(36) 
 
The received power is defined as the power consumed in 
the load:  
 
𝑃𝑅𝑋(𝑧) =
1
2 𝑅𝑒(𝑍𝐿) ⋅ |𝐼2|2  
(37) 
 
Using (30) and considering 𝑍𝑆 ≈ 0, the received power 
can be written as: 
 
𝑃𝑅𝑋(𝑧) = 𝑃𝑇𝑋
𝑅𝑒(𝑍𝐿)𝜔2𝑀2
𝑅𝑒(𝑍𝑇𝑋)|𝑍𝐿+𝑍𝑅𝑋|2  (38) 
 
 
Path loss in decibels (dB) can be defined as: 
 
𝑃𝐿 = −10 log10 (
𝑃𝑅𝑋
𝑃𝑇𝑋) (𝑑𝐵)  
(39) 
 
The path loss is a function of the number of turns and 
radius of both coils and the impedances of the system, as well 
as the frequency and the distance between reader and tag. The 
highest amount of power is transferred to the load when its 
impedance is matched with the impedance of the antenna. 
The path loss for the MI system increases with the 
increasing distance between reader and tag. Also, the path 
loss is higher for seawater due to the higher conductivity of 
the medium. As the frequency increases, the distance from 
the reader where the border between the near and the far-field 
is located decreases. This implies that the maximum 
theoretical range decreases with frequency. We can then 
conclude that there is an optimal combination of frequency 
and distance for each application. In addition to that, the 
attenuation factor α is higher for higher frequencies. 
The influence of the number of turns of the transmitter or 
the receiver coil in the mutual inductance M is linear. 
Therefore, the power received would increase quadratically 
with the increase in the number of turns. However, it also 
increases the energy losses in the internal resistance of the 
coil as it increases. It is also worth noting that a bigger coil 
diameter allows for more magnetic flux to pass through, but 
it also has the effect of increasing the internal resistance of 
the coil. 
A more in-depth model of underwater magnetic induction 
communication can be found in [15]. The model shown here 
assumes that the reader and tag coils are oriented in the same 
direction, with the field strength reaching zero if the angle 
between coils is 90°. To remove this limitation, the authors 
in [48] present a model of the Underwater MI channel for a 
tri-directional coil. To increase the achievable range of MI 
systems, waveguides can be used [14][49]. The authors in

[17] provide a different but similar model that is based on the 
quality factor of the coil inductor. 
 
1) Data transmission from tag 
When a transponder is located in the magnetic alternating 
field generated by the reader, the reader ’sees’ the 
transponder as the secondary wing of the transformer. This 
means that the transponder’s impedance is reflected back to 
the reader as the transformer impedance 𝑍𝑇.  
If the transponder antenna impedance changes, this is 
reflected back to the reader’s coil via the reflected impedance 
𝑍𝑇 . Therefore, a data stream can be transmitted via 
modulation of the voltage 𝑍𝐿 in the reader’s coil (called Load 
Modulation); this can be demodulated by the reader via 
rectification of the voltage [28]. This is only feasible in the 
near-field as if the transponder leaves the appropriate read 
range, the coupling is lost and the transmission link is not 
operational anymore. 
For an amplitude modulating system, due to the weak 
coupling between reader and transponder antennas, the 
voltage fluctuation is orders of magnitude smaller than the 
voltage provided by the reader. As a direct result, the reader 
has to integrate a complex circuitry to separate noise from the 
signal and detect the data stream. On the other hand, if the 
transponder modulates the signal at a frequency 𝑓𝑠, smaller 
than the frequency of the magnetic field (𝑓0), two spectral 
lines ±𝑓𝑠 are created and they can be filtered with a band-pass 
filter and demodulated more easily [47]. 
B. Far-field 
In the far-field, the electromagnetic fields separate 
completely from the reader’s antenna and become 
propagating waves, no longer retroacting upon the reader’s 
antenna. These waves are captured by the antenna on the 
transponder. The energy on the antenna is rectified and used 
to power up the IC. The frequency range commonly used for 
this type of transmission is the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) 
and Microwave.  
A linearly polarized plane EM wave propagating in lossy 
media in the z-direction can be described by the electric field 
strength 𝐸𝑥:  
 
𝐸𝑥 = 𝐸0𝑒𝑗𝜔𝑡−𝛾𝑧  
(40) 
 
with 𝛾 =  𝛼 +  𝑗 𝜔𝛽 as the propagating constant according to 
(5) and (6). 
The radiation power density S is the instantaneous value 
of the Poynting vector S=E×H. From [31] and considering 
(29): 
 
𝑺 =
1
2 𝑅𝑒(𝑬 × 𝑯) = 𝒂̂𝒛
|𝐸0|
2 𝑒−2𝛼𝑧𝑅𝑒 (
1
𝜂𝑐∗)  
(41) 
 
where ηC is the intrinsic impedance of the medium, given by 
(42). 
 
𝜂𝐶 = √
𝑗𝜔𝜇
𝜎+𝑗𝜔𝜀  (42) 
 
For the transmitting antenna in the free-space, 𝑠0 is the 
power supplied to it over the area of the spread surface: 
 
𝑆0 =
𝑃𝐸𝐼𝑅𝑃
4𝜋𝑧2 =
𝑃𝑇𝑋𝐺𝑇𝑋
4𝜋𝑧2   (43) 
 
Whereas the radiation power density in a lossy medium 
is then:  
 
𝑆 = 𝑆0𝑒−2𝛼𝑧  (44) 
 
For the receiving antenna, the average power received is 
the radiation power density times its effective receiving area 
𝐴𝑒 [45]:  
 
𝑃𝑅𝑋 = 𝑆 ⋅ 𝐴𝑒 = 𝑆 ⋅
𝐺𝑅𝑋𝜆2
4𝜋   
(45) 
 
 
The transmission equation then can be written as: 
 
𝑃𝑅𝑋 = 𝑃𝑇𝑋 (
𝐺𝑇𝑋𝐺𝑅𝑋𝜆2
(4𝜋𝑧)2 ) 𝑒−2𝛼𝑧  
(46) 
 
where 𝐺𝑇𝑋 and 𝐺𝑅𝑋 are the antenna gains for transmitter and 
receiver respectively, λ=(2π)/β is the wavelength and z is the 
distance between antennas. This equation assumes that the 
antennas are aligned and have the same polarization. The path 
loss 𝑃𝐿𝐸𝑀  in decibels is then defined as 𝑃𝐿𝐸𝑀 =
−10 log10(𝑃𝑅𝑋/𝑃𝑇𝑋). 
 
1) Data transmission from tag 
For passive RFID, the method of transmitting back to the 
reader is via Backscatter. Electromagnetic waves are 
reflected by objects that are larger than half the wavelength 
(𝜆/ 2) [28]. The efficiency of this reflection depends on the 
radar cross-section of the object: antennas that are resonant 
with the waves have a larger reflection cross-section. The 
reflection characteristics can be altered by changing the load 
that is connected to the antenna. For example, if a load 𝑅𝐿 is 
switched on and off while connected to the antenna, this 
changes the reflection characteristics of the antenna, 
generating a modulated backscatter signal [28]. The range is 
limited by the amount of energy that reaches the tag (path 
loss) and the sensitivity of the reader’s receiver to the 
reflected signal (reflected signal strength ∝ 1/𝑥4) [50]. The 
authors in [51] present a method for measuring the 
backscatter of an RFID tag and for calculating its radar cross-
section. They utilise a network analyser connected to an 
anechoic chamber.

V. 
MEASUREMENTS 
To explore the difference in magnetic field strength 
between free-space and water in the near-field region, a 
preliminary experiment was designed. The Anritsu 
MS2038C VNA Master [52] vector network analyser and the 
probe 100C from Beehive Electronics, USA [53] were used 
to measure the magnetic field strength at the system’s 
resonant frequency. Two Evaluation Kit RFID readers were 
used: MRD2EVM from Texas Instruments, USA that operates 
at 134.2 kHz [54] and Pepper Wireless C1 USB from Eccel 
Technology Ltd, UK that operates at 13.56 MHz [55]. Both 
have square loop antennae embedded on the printed circuit 
board, with sides of length 3.0 cm and 4.5 cm, and number of 
turns 14 and 3, respectively. 
For a square loop antenna with N-turns, the magnetic field 
strength in free-space can be written as [56]: 
 
𝐻0 =
𝑁𝐼
2𝜋(𝑧2
𝑙2+1
4)√𝑧2+𝑙2
2
  (47) 
 
where z is the distance from the centre of the antenna and l is 
the length of the side of the antenna. Using (29), for a lossy 
medium (in this case saline water), the magnetic field 
strength is then  
 
𝐻 = 𝐻0𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝛼𝑧)  
(48) 
 
Using α from (5) with the salinity and frequency, we can 
then calculate the theoretical values for the magnetic field 
strength for any distance and compare this with the 
measurements made with the probe.  
For both systems, the setup for the experiments was the 
same, as seen in Figure 7. The readers were placed and 
secured on the side of a plastic transparent container. The 
probe was placed in different distances z from the centre of 
the embedded antenna of the reader. A measurement ruler 
and grid paper were used for the precise placement of the 
probe. The free-space tests were done without water inside 
the container. For the other measurements, the probe was 
submerged in the water solution to get the measured field 
strength.  
For the experimental test, 4 water solutions were used, 
named as: distilled water, freshwater, brackish water, and 
saline water. The water solutions were prepared as follows. 
First the container was placed in a scale, and the mass of NaCl 
was added, according to the target value of salinity for each 
solution. Then, distilled water was added until the whole 
solution mass reached 700g (the volume of the plastic 
container used for the experiments). Table III shows the mass 
of salt for each solution and their salinity and calculated 
conductivity.

For each solution, the probe was placed and held at 
different distances from the centre of the antenna and the 
peak value of the magnetic field was measured using the 
VNA. After this was done, the probe was wiped so there was 
no contamination between solutions. 
The output power values measured by the probe 𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡 
were then converted from dBm to magnetic field strength in 
A/m using the probe manufacturer’s guidelines [53], using 
Equations (49) and (50), where 𝑓𝑀𝐻𝑧 is the frequency of the 
system in MHz, 𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the magnetic flux density, and 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑡

measured values of field strength and the theoretical values

DISCUSSIONS 
The most common method of wireless transmission 
underwater is acoustic communication. This is due to the long 
range that can be accomplished with this technology. 
However, some applications do not need such long range and 
are deeply affected by acoustic noise and refractions, 
reflections and multipath due to the proximity to the water 
surface, such as coastal environments. In these cases, wireless 
communication can be better served by other methods that do 
not suffer from these problems. We explore the possibility of 
using RFID technology to better serve these environments.

In the near-field region, the magnetic component of the 
electromagnetic 
field 
dominates. 
The 
method 
of 
communication for RFID in this region is MI. Compared to 
other methods of underwater communications, MI has 
several advantages. It is not affected by multipath 
propagation or fading and the magnetic field can cross the 
water to air boundary with low attenuation [14]. The signal 
propagation delay is negligible if compared to acoustic 
waves. The channel response is predictable, and a sufficiently 
large range can be achieved with modest data rates [13].  
For the far-field, the electromagnetic field propagates as 
a wave, and the communication is realized through 
radiofrequency. Due to the high attenuation, there is a severe 
constraint on data rates and propagation distances for this 
method [2]. Lower frequency signals have lower attenuation 
(due to conductivity of the water) but require larger antennas. 
This also limits the bandwidth of the system due to the lower 
frequency of operation. Higher frequency systems would 
then require more power to reach the same ranges. Shallow 
water environments, in particular, pose a problem to wave 
propagation due to the proximity to the water/air upper 
boundary and to the river/sea bed, which causes multipath 
propagation [5][6].  
Both technologies do not require line-of-sight and are 
unaffected by light and acoustic ambient noise. Moreover, the 
channel response is independent of water quality conditions, 
such as turbidity. The literature generally agrees that the 
achievable range for a given transmission power is not great 
for both MI and RF. The reasoning is due to the high 
attenuation caused by the medium conductivity which 
increases with the salinity of the water. From this, it follows 
that long-range transmissions underwater, particularly in a 
marine 
environment, 
are 
best 
served 
by 
acoustic 
communication based systems [2]. 
However, there are some evidence that this attenuation 
could be lower than expected. The authors in [57] managed 
to transmit a RF signal at 90 m distance in seawater with a 
lower attenuation than expected. To reflect this results, [45] 
propose the change in the attenuation factor α to α' according 
to Equation (27). In addition to that, the dielectric permittivity 
for saline water is not completely understood [34]. There are 
models available extrapolated from measurement data, but 
they do not agree completely. Since the dielectric permittivity 
affects the attenuation, it follows that the attenuation itself 
could have a different value. 
The results from our experiment in Figure 10 for the 
134.2 kHz system show that there is a difference between the 
expected theoretical value and the measured value, especially 
as the distance increases. Yet, the same cannot be said for the 
results in Figure 11 for the 13.56 MHz system. In this latter 
case, the measurements seem to be lower than the expected 
value. It is not clear what is the cause, but this suggests that 
higher frequencies suffer higher attenuation in a manner not 
considered in the model. 
As expected, a higher water salinity implies in a higher 
attenuation for the signal. Although the relative permittivity 
for seawater is slightly smaller than for freshwater, as can be 
observed in Figure 3, the conductivity for seawater is higher 
(see Figure 2) and dominates, increasing the attenuation 
factor. It is also worth noting that the 134.2 kHz system is not 
as affected by the increasing salinity of water as the 13.56 
MHz system, as it can be seen looking at the values in Tables 
IV and V. This means that a MI communication system for a 
marine environment should be designed with a lower 
frequency, keeping in mind the needed bandwidth to transmit 
data and other requirements. This would ensure that the 
system is efficient, as there is lower energy being lost in the 
transmission. 
Some authors argue that MI has a lower attenuation than 
RF for freshwater, and similar results for seawater [14]. This 
fact, combined with its immunity to multipath and fading, 
implies that MI could be a great alternative for wireless 
communications underwater. In addition, the achievable 
range of MI communications can be greatly extended by 
deploying waveguides that do not require power – simple 
passive relay coils that guide the magnetic field – such as 
demonstrated in [14][49]. For example, [14] uses an MI 
waveguide and achieves a range 26 times higher than a 
normal MI system. Another development that improves MI 
communications underwater is to use omnidirectional coils 
that remove the requirement of the transmitting and receiving 
coils being aligned [13][48]. 
However, to design an underwater RFID system it is 
required to balance a trade-off between range, transmission 
power and frequency (and therefore data rate and channel 
capacity). Nonetheless, the RFID system can always be 
engineered to achieve the best range given its power budget.  
For an MI system, the size and number of turns of the 
transmitting and receiving coils also has an impact on the 
path loss. A bigger coil diameter increases the generated and 
captured magnetic flux for the transmitter/reader and 
receiver/tag, which increases the mutual induction and 
decreases the path loss. However, this is also a trade-off, as a 
bigger coil has a bigger internal resistance, requiring more 
power to transmit. It is also worth noting that some 
applications have size restrictions. 
In the far-field category, the antenna can be carefully 
designed to provide the best radar cross-section, and therefore 
antenna gain, for the desired application. Again, the size of 
the antenna is important, as it is related to the wavelength. 
There is also a trade-off to be made for the frequency, 
attenuation, and antenna size: for a lower attenuation, the 
system would need a lower frequency, which requires a 
bigger antenna.  
An example application that would benefit from MI 
communication over acoustic would be sensors deployed in 
coastal areas and fish farms [58]. In these environments, the 
acoustic noise – from waves, animal life and vessels – and 
the proximity with the water surface negatively impact 
acoustic underwater communications. In such scenarios, MI 
underwater 
communication 
would 
better 
fulfil 
the 
communication mechanisms for the of the system.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Given the existing challenges in wireless underwater 
communications, it is worth exploring alternatives, such as 
RFID. However, underwater RFID communication is not a 
well-explored topic in the scientific community. In this paper, 
we expanded on the existing theoretical model for RFID 
channel characteristics to account for the attenuation that the 
electromagnetic field suffers underwater. The water salinity 
is an important factor, which is used to calculate the dielectric 
permittivity and the conductivity of the water, and therefore, 
the attenuation. The RFID operation was separated into two 
categories: near-field and far-field. For both cases, the 
physical characteristics of the transmission were presented 
and from this, the equation for path loss was obtained. 
In both technologies, the water salinity is a problem, as it 
increases the conductivity of the medium and, therefore, its 
attenuation of RFID signals. However, MI communication 
has advantages over RF in terms of immunity to multipath 
propagation and fading. In addition, a magnetic field can 
cross the air/water boundary, which is required for some 
applications. Therefore, near-field RFID communication is a 
promising 
alternative 
for 
underwater 
wireless 
communications. 
The model presented in this paper considers that both the 
transmitting and receiving antennas are located underwater 
with no transition borders and other losses. This model could 
be expanded to account for transition borders such as the air-
water interface located at the water surface or the interface 
with the waterproofing material of the reader and tag. 
In this paper, we presented measurements for magnetic 
field strength for two near-field systems in different water 
salinity conditions. The results for the 134.2 kHz show that 
the attenuation may not be as strong as expected, especially 
for higher distances. But the results for the 13.56 MHz follow 
more closely the expected values, sometimes being even 
lower. This seems to imply that there may be a relationship 
between the attenuation factor and the frequency that is not 
currently expressed in the model. More experimental data is 
needed to draw any significant conclusions. 
The results also suggest that a higher concentration of salt 
in the water increases the attenuation, which agrees with the 
model. However, the effect is more prominent the higher the 
frequency, which implies that the best communications 
solution for marine environments requires the use of lower
