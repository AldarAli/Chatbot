Abstract—Distributed embedded systems utilizing active sensors
that share a common media (e.g., light detection and ranging
sensors, LIDAR) have to be coordinated to eliminate or reduce
interferences between the different sensor nodes. For LIDAR
and similar sensor systems it is possible to apply media access
methods, like frequency, code and time division multiple access
(FDMA, CDMA or TDMA). FDMA and CDMA methods utilize
sensor speciﬁc parameters for medium access. This can be a
drawback, as it is no longer possible or far more difﬁcult to use
error correction or measurement enhancement techniques, like
multi-frequency measurements, that depend on these parameters.
A TDMA scheme frees these sensor speciﬁc parameters, but needs
additional infrastructure in the form of clock synchronization.
The implementation of the synchronization mechanism constrains
the TDMA schedules that can be executed. This paper provides an
algorithm to ascertain these constraints, and thus determine the
requirements for the synchronization mechanism implementation.

INTRODUCTION
With the advance of distributed sensor systems the need for
coordination in such systems arises. Tightly coupled distributed
sensor systems need to be coordinated to eliminate measure-
ment errors and correlate results from the individual sensor
nodes. For example, if active sensors (e.g., LIDAR or ultra-
sonic based) are deployed in vicinity, the correct management
of the sensor activation and measurement times is a central
issue. For applications, like factory automation or indoor
positioning, the sensors might be mounted on mobile units.
Therefore, simple coordination schemes, like wired triggers,
are no longer feasible.
For example, Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors [1] are avail-
able that combine a LIDAR measurement mechanism with
a charge-coupled device image sensor. ToF sensors generate
image (frame) data similar to a charge-coupled device sensor
where each pixel provides distance data in addition to a (gray
scale) image. Such a sensor relies on an infrared or laser
light source that is activated for each measurement for a
certain time. To avoid interference no other light source with
the same modulation pattern, e.g., same frequency, should
be active during this time. Standard media access schemes,
like, FDMA [2], CDMA [3], or phase hopping [4] have been
applied to ToF sensor systems. These schemes use different
frequencies and/or modulation patterns to eliminate or reduce
the interferences between multiple ToF sensors. For a ToF
sensor the maximum measurable distance and resolution is
determined by the frequency of the light source. Therefore, a
media access scheme that utilizes the light source modulation
itself, will constrain the sensor with regard to the measurable
distance and resolution.
By employing a TDMA scheme, these sensor parameters
can be freely used for measurement enhancement processes
and error corrections (e.g., [5] and [6]).
Ultrasonic sensors are another type of active sensor, that
can be applied for position measurement in a distributed sensor
system, e.g., Constellation [7], BUZZ [8], or Cricket [9]. These
systems are based on Time-of-Arrival measurements. A radio
signal and an ultrasonic signal are generated at the same
time by a sending node. The difference of the reception time
of these two signals is measured and used to calculate the
distance between sender and receiver. In the above mentioned
positioning systems multiple beacons are used so that a mobile
device can determine the position by correlating the reception
time differences. If transmissions of multiple beacons overlap,
the measurement results can be erroneous, as a wrong radio
signal to ultrasonic signal match can occur. Therefore, they
have to be detected and ﬁltered as explained by [9](p.p. 67)
or avoided altogether by coordinating the sensors.
Wired triggers (Synchronous BUZZ), radio signals from
a central unit (Constellation) or random signal generation on
each sender (Asynchronous BUZZ and Cricket) are typically
used to coordinate these sensors. In case of wired triggers,
the drawback is the need for additional infrastructure (the
trigger wires) and the constrained ﬂexibility of such a system
(i.e., this is not feasible for mobile sensors). In case of the
randomization, the interferences are reduced but not removed.
This reduction can be good enough for a small amount of
active transmitters in the system but will fall short for larger
systems. Even though the synchronization of the measurements
via a radio signal solves these problems, it still shares the
same weakness: the interoperability with similar systems that
are outside of the control of this scheme.
Similar to the ToF sensors, as explained above, various
media access schemes from the ﬁeld of telecommunication
have been evaluated and applied for ultrasonic based sensor
systems. For example, the Dolphin system [10] uses a direct se-
quence code division multiple access (DS/CDMA) scheme for
measurement coordination of ultrasonic sensors. [11] compare
DS/CDMA and frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
media access schemes for ultrasonic sensors and come to
the conclusion that FHSS provides a higher accuracy of the
measurement results in comparison to DS/CDMA.
Beside ultrasonic sensors, indoor location measurements
are also realized by evaluating the received signal strength

indicators (RSSI). [12] describes a location measurement based
on RSSI of IEEE 802.15.4 communication beacon messages.
Lau et al. ﬁnd that interferences from IEEE 802.11 trafﬁc
operating in the same frequency band cause a high degradation
of the precision of the localization measurement due to lost
IEEE 802.15.4 beacon messages. A solution for this problem
is the scheduling of exclusive time slots for each network
protocol.
Media access schemes are abundantly used in the ﬁeld
of telecommunication but can and are also applied to active
sensors. Methods that utilize the signal modulation, e.g.,
CDMA or FDMA, allow the usage of multiple sensors without
need for additional infrastructure. The drawback is that these
methods either constrain the measurements (FDMA in case
of ToF sensors) or do only reduce the interferences (CDMA
or random signal activation, e.g., asynchronous BUZZ). Wired
triggers, as central coordination method, limit the application
scenarios of the system (e.g., it is harder to support mobile
units). Using a centrally generated radio signal as trigger
source can be a feasible solution, as long as all sensors are in
range of the radio signal. If the measurement triggers cannot
be derived directly from a central source a distributed clock
synchronization is necessary to execute a TDMA schedule.
This can be provided by a higher level clock synchronization
protocol (e.g., IEEE 1588 or the network time protocol NTP)
or is part of the communication network itself (e.g., EtherCAT
or FlexRay). The constraints that are added to the system by
the clock synchronization and methods to incorporate these in
the schedule planning are explained and proposed in this paper.
A distributed system of four Time-of-Flight sensors is
presented in Section III. This section introduces the setup
of the sensor system, gives a short overview of the ToF
sensor principle and derives an ideal TDMA schedule based
on the core parameters of the system. Section IV deﬁnes the
constraints imposed by the clock synchronization on a TDMA
schedule. Section IV-E proposes an algorithm set that can be
used to calculate these constraints and build an interference-
free TDMA schedule that satisﬁes these constraints. A TDMA
schedule in accordance with the calculated upper bound for
the synchronization constraints and a supervisor for the syn-
chronization precision have been implemented in the presented
system and are described in Section V.
II.
BUILDING A SCHEDULE FOR A DISTRIBUTED SENSOR
SYSTEM
In a system that incorporates multiple active sensors it
is necessary to control measurements to reduce or eliminate
interference. The term active sensors refers to sensors that
generate a signal to execute their measurements (e.g., ToF or
ultrasonic sensors). These sensors are typically employed to
monitor an object or an area of interest in real time. Therefore,
data has to be generated by the sensors at a constant rate fmeas
and delay between measurements. Thus, a static schedule cycle
has to be built. Furthermore it is necessary to calculate the
worst case execution time for each measurement Twcet to
allocate a time slot in the schedule. The Twcet depends on
the sensor type used and is further speciﬁed for a Time-of-
Flight sensor in the following section. The utilization of the
TDMA schedule is the ratio of the allocated time (a sum of
all scheduled measurements per time unit) to the available
time (e.g., 1 second). In an ideal system it is possible to
utilize 100 % of the available time for measurements and to

execute the different measurements head-to-head as depicted
in Figure 1.
III.
A DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM OF TOF SENSORS
A system of four ToF sensor nodes of the type Sentis
M100 from the company Bluetechnix Group GmbH [13] is
used for demonstration as depicted in Figure 2. The sensor
measurement conﬁguration is the same for all four sensors.
The nodes are connected by 100BASE-TX connections via
a switch to a data collector workstation. The workstation is
used to calculate the TDMA schedule, conﬁgure the trigger
modules for each sensor that executes the schedule and to
collect measurement data as presented in Section V.
A. Time-of-Flight Sensor Background
A ToF sensor generates a gray scale image of a scene with
additional depth information for each pixel. It uses a modulated
light source to illuminate the scene. This source is activated
for a certain time, also referred to as integration time Tint.
This typically ranges from 100 µs to 10 ms. After this time
of activity of the light source and sensor the gathered data
has to be read from the sensor, which takes Tro (in case of
the Sentis M100, this is 1.35 ms). During this time another
ToF sensor can execute its measurement. However, this is
only possible for small integration times (Tint < Tro). The
distance and gray scale data for each pixel can be calculated
from a sufﬁcient set of phase measurements Nphase (typically
4, [1]). Additional phase measurements can be included for
each frame to reduce silicon speciﬁc asymmetries of the sensor
pixel implementation [1], or to reduce aliasing errors caused by
harmonics of the light source [14]. In addition for a worst case
measurement time it is necessary to deﬁne an upper bound for
the integration time, as this parameter can be varied between
phase measurements. Therefore, the worst case execution time
Twcet for one measurement can be calculated by the sum of the

different phase measurement times deﬁned by the upper bound
of the integration time Tint for each phase i and the read-
out time for the sensor Tro as depicted by (1). In case of the
example with the Sentis M100 sensor, each phase measurement
has the same integration time and read-out time, and thus, can
be simpliﬁed to a multiplication of the phase measurement time
with the amount of phase measurements Nphase as depicted
by (2).

B. ToF Sensor System Conﬁguration
For a schedulability analysis the total time Tsys that has to
be allocated can be calculated by the sum of the measurement
times for each sensor in the system. If all (Nsen) sensors share
the same conﬁguration regarding the measurement time Twcet
and the frame rate fmeas this can be done by applying (3).

SYNCHRONIZATION MECHANISM CONSTRAINTS
A. TDMA Schedule Problem
To execute a TDMA schedule in a distributed system a
common notion of time is necessary. This is provided by a syn-
chronization mechanism (e.g., IEEE 1588). This mechanism
can be characterized by two parameters. The synchronization
precision Π and the granularity of the global clock ∆g. These
parameters constrain the resource amount that can be allocated
for measurements as depicted by (5), (6), and Tloss in Figure 3.
In a physical system (Π and ∆g greater 0 s) it is not possible
to execute the TDMA schedule given in Figure 1 without
interference between the different tasks.
It is common practice to distribute the spare time evenly
between the tasks/measurements. For an interference free ex-
ecution of measurements it is necessary that the spare time
per measurement covers the time loss Tloss inﬂicted by the
synchronization mechanism. For the example system the time
that has to be allocated is Tsys
=
912 ms per second (a
utilization of 91.2%).
B. Synchronization Precision
The precision Πi is the maximum difference of any two
clocks of an ensemble at a speciﬁc point in time i. The
precision of the ensemble (the synchronization precision) Π
is the maximum of Πi over an interval of interest [15, p. 56].
C. Granularity of the Synchronized Global Time
The granularity ∆g of the global time is the period of
the global clock and further the resolution for the triggering
of actions (e.g., sensor measurements). Excess time after a
scheduled measurement but before the next global clock tick
cannot be used for a consecutive measurement.
D. Measurement Time Loss
The synchronization mechanism parameters have to be
taken into account for building a TDMA schedule. Talloc (4)
depicts the worst case execution time Twcet ((1) or (2)) that
has to be allocated per measurement with the addition of
the synchronization precision to eliminate interference with
consecutive measurements. Tloss (5) depicts the loss of mea-
surement time due to synchronization precision and clock
granularity for a speciﬁc measurement duration. The upper
bound for the ﬁrst term of this equation is ∆g, and therefore,
can be simpliﬁed to (6), which depicts the maximum loss per
scheduled task in the system.

E. Algorithm Set for the Synchronization Mechanism Con-
straints
Different synchronization mechanisms and implementation
strategies for these mechanisms provide different synchro-
nization precisions and clock granularities. The following
algorithm shows how the available slack of a given TDMA
schedule can be distributed between these two parameters of
the synchronization mechanism.
The time that is not utilized in the TDMA schedule is
available as slack Stot (7) and is given by the available
time Ttot and the necessary time that has to be allocated
Tsys. By dividing the total slack by the amount of scheduled
measurements in the system, the slack budget available per
scheduled task Stask (8) can be calculated. This can be used
to cover the time losses due to the synchronization precision
and clock granularity as given by (6).

precision and clock granularity

(10)
Therefore, if one of the two parameters is known, the upper
bound for the second parameter can be calculated.
F. Applying the Algorithm Set
Starting with the system conﬁguration as given in Table I
it is possible to ﬁnd a set of synchronization parameters that
is necessary to execute an interference free TDMA schedule,
and therefore, the necessary implementation strategy for the
synchronization mechanism. This can be done by setting either
the clock granularity or synchronization precision to a ﬁxed
value and applying the algorithms deﬁned in Section IV-E to
ﬁnd the corresponding upper bound for the other parameter.
The total slack Stot (7) and the available slack per scheduled
task Stask (8) have to be calculated to solve the inequality
(10) for the second synchronization parameter. In case of the
example system, (8) can be simpliﬁed as all four sensors share
the same conﬁguration (fmeas).
Stot = 1 − 0.912 = 88 · 10−3 s
Stask =
Stot
Nsen · fmeas
Stask = 88 · 10−3
4 · 20
= 1.1 · 10−3 s
In case of the example system, the available slack per
scheduled task (measurement) is 1.1 ms. This can be dis-
tributed between the synchronization precision and clock gran-
ularity.
Variant 1: Fixed Synchronization Precision
If a legacy system is extended by a synchronization mech-
anism the type of implementation for this mechanism might
be severely constrained. A range for the achievable synchro-
nization precision is given by the type of implementation and
the system characteristic (e.g., processor or network load). If
the synchronization precision for a system has been measured
or estimated it can be used to determine the necessary clock
granularity. A software based IEEE 1588 implementation is
capable of a synchronization precision Π below 1 ms.
for
Π = 1 · 10−3 s
∆g ≤ Stask − Π = 1.1 · 10−3 − 1 · 10−3 =
= 0.1 · 10−3 s
∆g ≤ 100 µs
In this case, the clock granularity ∆g has to be at most
100 µs to allow an interference free execution of the TDMA
schedule in the example system.
Variant 2: Fixed Clock Granularity
Implementing a ﬁne clock granularity might not be feasible
for a system where processor execution time is in high demand.
For example, a ToF sensor needs a high amount of execution
time for processing the frame data. If a software based imple-
mentation of IEEE 1588 is used, a ﬁne clock granularity would
add higher processor load to the system. In case of the example
system, a coarse granularity of 500 µs has been chosen to
reduce the additional processor load and the corresponding
upper bound for the second parameter, i.e. the synchronization
precision Π, is calculated.
for
∆g = 0.5 · 10−3 s
Π ≤ Stask − ∆g = 1.1 · 10−3 − 0.5 · 10−3 =
= 0.6 · 10−3 s
Π ≤ 600 µs
A synchronization precision Π of 600 µs can be reasonably
realized by, e.g., a software based IEEE 1588 implementation.
Whereas, a typical NTP implementation can achieve a preci-
sion down to a few milliseconds, which would not sufﬁce in
this case.
G. Choosing or Tuning the Synchronization Mechanism Im-
plementation
With the calculated bounds for the synchronization mech-
anism parameters it is possible to choose the necessary type
and implementation strategy for the system. For example, an
IEEE 1588 clock synchronization has two main implemen-
tation strategies. A software and a hardware based imple-
mentation. In short, a hardware based approach can deliver
a synchronization precision down to a few nanoseconds and
typically provides a clock granularity of a few nanoseconds.
Whereas a software based approach can deliver a synchro-
nization precision in the range of a few microseconds to a few
milliseconds. A software implementation of the clock typically
provides a clock granularity in the range of 100 µs to 1 ms.
More information regarding these strategies and the achievable
synchronization precisions is given in [16].
V.
SUPERVISOR FOR THE SYNCHRONIZATION PRECISION
By building a TDMA schedule with respect to the clock
synchronization constraints it is possible to supervise the
system by comparing the current precision with the upper
bound used to build the schedule. In the example system
a local supervisor has been implemented on each sensor. A
software version of IEEE 1588 has been implemented with
a clock granularity of 500 µs. The TDMA schedule for the
example system has been built with an upper bound for the
synchronization precision of 600 µs as calculated in variant 2
of Section IV-F.
The synchronization precision Πi is the highest offset
between two sensors in the system at a speciﬁc point in time,
as deﬁned in Section IV-B. The local supervisors do not have
access to values that are generated outside the sensor. Thus,
a local supervisor cannot calculate the actual synchronization
precision as access to the offsets of the other sensors is not
available. The local supervisor has access to the offset from
the master (OFM) of the sensor. As shown in Figure 4, the
OFM is symmetric around 0. Thus, it is reasonable to assume

that the resulting worst case synchronization precision is two
times the worst case OFM and the upper bound for the OFM
can be set to
1
2 of the upper bound for the synchronization
precision, i.e. 300 µs. If the OFM rises above this threshold
the sensor supervisor disables the measurements for the sensor
so that it will not interfere with other sensors.
The
synchronization
mechanism
(in
this
example
IEEE 1588) shares the communication network and the
processor execution time with the sensor measurement.
Therefore, sensor measurements have an impact on the
synchronization mechanism as they need processor time and
communication bandwidth.
Three different scenarios have been applied to the system.
The internally calculated values for the OFM are transmitted
over the communication network and are used ofﬂine to
calculate the synchronization precision for the system.
Scenario 1: Minimal System Load
In this scenario, no ToF measurements are executed and
the communication bandwidth and processor execution time
is freely available for the synchronization mechanism. The
synchronization precision over the elapsed time (1 hour) is
depicted in Figure 5 on the left. A histogram for the synchro-
nization precision is depicted on the right. The average syn-
chronization precision is 3.157 µs and the worst is 28.763 µs.
Scenario 2: Medium System Load
In this scenario, the ToF measurements are executed as
given by the system conﬁguration in Section III and the ToF
data of two sensors is transmitted over the communication
medium. This results in additional load both on the network
and the processor side of the system. The measurement results
are depicted in Figure 6. The average synchronization precision
is 40 µs and the worst is 586 µs, which is below the threshold
of 600 µs.
Scenario 3: Full System Load
In this scenario, the ToF measurements are executed as
given by the system conﬁguration in Section III and the ToF
data of all sensors is transmitted over the communication
medium. The measurement results are depicted in Figure 7.
The average synchronization precision is 65 µs and the worst
is 618 µs, which is above the threshold of 600 µs.
Extrapolation of Scenario 2 and 3
The network load for scenario 3 is twice that from scenario
2. The average synchronization precision rose by 61% from
scenario 2 to 3. Additional sensors, and therefore, additional
network load will further deteriorate the synchronization preci-
sion. Thus, for a system with more than four sensors, either the
clock granularity would have to be decreased, or the system
slack increased to allow the execution of an interference free
TDMA schedule. For the latter, the measurement parameters,
i.e. the integration time Tint and the frame rate fmeas, would
have to be reduced.
A. Comparison and Limitations
A non-TDMA based method, as presented by [17], shows
a reduction of the impact of interference down to 1.5 % of the
maximum measureable distance for a distributed ToF sensor
system. In comparison, the TDMA based approach, taking
the synchronization mechanism into account as proposed in
Section IV-F, shows a standard deviation of the measurement
results of 0.07 % of the maximum measureable distance. This
is equal to the standard deviation of the measurement of a
single sensor. The TDMA approach without a margin for
the synchronization parameters, and therefore, a head-to-head
scheduling of the sensors, results in a standard deviation of
0.6 %. The worst case scenario for the sensor system is a
measurement of all sensors at the same time. This results in
an erratic distribution of the measured distance values between
1 % and 1000 % of the actual distance.
By applying a TDMA schedule and the supervisor to the
system it is possible to eliminate the interferences between the
sensors, if the following points are accounted for:
•
The limits for the precision of the synchronization
mechanism. These have to be determined correctly
(typically ofﬂine) to build a valid TDMA schedule by
utilizing the proposed algorithm.
•
The accuracy of the online synchronization precision
measurement. This value will be used by the super-
visor to check against the previously (ofﬂine) deﬁned
limits for the synchronization precision.
It is also necessary to consider how the supervisor has to inter-
act with the system. It can either mark invalid measurements,
or disable measurements if the measured precision deteriorates
over a certain threshold. Thus, it has to be considered if
a missing measurement might actually cause more harm to
a system than a measurement with a certain error due to
interference.
VI.
CONCLUSION
As it has been shown in Section I, various sensor control
methods have been implemented by research groups, ranging
from simple central wired or wireless methods to typical media
access schemes, like CDMA. The advantages and disadvan-
tages of these methods for active sensors have been discussed.
A TDMA scheme provides a control method that is decoupled
from the measurement mechanism of active sensors but needs
a clock synchronization mechanism in the background and a
valid TDMA schedule for operation.

In Subsection IV-A, it has been shown that not every
schedule for a distributed sensor system is feasible if the un-
derlying synchronization mechanism is not taken into account.
The imposed synchronization mechanism constraints can be
calculated, and thus, incorporated into the schedule planning to
deliver a valid and executable TDMA schedule for the system.
An algorithm set for this calculation has been proposed in
Subsection IV-E.
This algorithm set can be used to set the bounds of the
constraints of the synchronization mechanism for the system,
especially the synchronization precision. Further, the synchro-
nization precision can be monitored in the system and proper
actions can be set, e.g., disabling task executions until the
precision is below a speciﬁed threshold. This is especially
interesting for a system of active sensors, for example, the ToF
sensor system described in Section III, where it is necessary
to eliminate interference of the scheduled measurements. A
simple local supervisor has been implemented in the example
system and measurements of the synchronization precision of
an IEEE 1588 software implementation for different scenarios
have been presented in Section V.
