Abstract— This paper introduces an approach how the Sensor
Web Enablement (SWE) framework of the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) will be used in order to build a franco-
lebanese observatory. We present the practical application of
SWE services as a source of real-time observation data and the
associated technical architecture for making the observations
available on the Web to end users near real-time. We discuss
the question of crossing sensor data with other data sources,
e.g., data provided by human observations. We illustrate our
approach with a first use case to monitor the snow weather
stations in Lebanese Mountains.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Lebanon is bordering the eastern Mediterranean Sea (See
Figure. 1). The Mediterranean basin is a priority area and a
Figure 1. Study area in Lebanon’s map of snow weather stations
leading area for the analysis of environmental data and for
the
extrapolation
of
trends
that
will
allow
a
better
management of the present and help envisage plausible
scenarios for the future. For this reason, actors of the French
and Lebanese scientific research community wished to
establish a shared observatory between France and Lebanon
called “Observatoire Libano-Français de l’Environnement”,
O-LiFE [1]. The main activity of the observatory is to study
the critical zone around the Mediterranean, of water
resources, biodiversity, natural hazards, and management of
the environment and ultimately the study of land use. To
carry out its mission, the O-LiFE observatory aims to
construct environmental databases of the critical zone in
consideration,
create
collaborative
software
tools
and
organize, share, sustain and enhance environmental data.
Building such an environmental observatory requires
defining a technical architecture that must be able to store
various types of data and to offer several services. The data
and knowledge being handled are mostly spatial and
collected from sensors and scientists. For this purpose, we
propose an open, standards-based, modular architecture
based on the OGC SWE framework. OGC SWE has indeed
become currently a very useful monitoring technique at
spatial and temporal scale especially after the considerable
improvement in the ICT communication infrastructure.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges for building the
technical architecture and present our first approach. The
next section introduces the framework we propose to use.
Section 3 details our context and the architecture we propose.
Section 4 illustrates this approach with our first use case
dedicated to snow while Section 5 concludes this paper.

OGC SENSOR WEB ENABLEMENT
In this section, we present the main ideas lying in the
standard
OGC
that
is
used
in
most
environmental
observatories and that makes it possible to exchange and use
data from such observatories. The OGC is an international,
non-profit,
voluntary
consensus
standards
organization

consisting
of
more
than
500
companies,
government
agencies and universities [2]. The goal of the OGC is the
creation and establishment of standards that enable global
infrastructures for delivery and integration of geospatial
content and services and to facilitate the adoption of open,
spatially
enabled
reference
architectures
in
enterprise
environments worldwide.
Within the last years, the Sensor Web Enablement
(SWE) architecture of the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC) has matured into its second generation [3]. The main
goal of this standards framework is the integration of sensors
and sensor data into Spatial Data Infrastructures and thus
makes it possible to use data measured by sensors in a broad
range
of
applications.
Thus,
sensor
data
become
an
additional
source
for
geospatial
information
besides
conventional
data
types
like
maps.
In
addition,
the
availability of sensor data offers the possibility to integrate
near real-time measurements with conventional geospatial
data for visualization purposes.
The SWE framework consists of a set of standards
defining data formats for sensor data and metadata, as well
as service interfaces to access sensor data, task sensors or
send and receive alerts based on sensor measurements [4].

PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION
In this section we discuss the similarities and specificities
of the O-Life Observatory and present how the OGC SWE
standards are integrated in the O-Life infrastructure so that
snow real-time data sources becomes available to end users.
A.
Similarities and Specificities of the O-Life Observatory
O-LIFE will be built, as a first step, by combining and
sharing data already collected and with direct access to in-
situ sensors.
A survey has been conducted for O-LiFE supported
research projects showed that there are existing databases
and data but most of these data are dispersed, diverse, not
updated,
unpublished,
insecure,
not
shared,
and
not
accessible to public. Furthermore, in many cases data from
many heterogeneous data sources might need to be compared
and/or combined and different data sources have to be
correlated. Moreover, there are different data sharing policy
within the scientific community that prevents access to data.
Sharing and leveraging data and research resources can avoid
duplication of very expensive and time-consuming efforts,
allowing scientists to spend more time in data analysis than
in data collection and discovery, and enable more people to
benefit from using environmental data. Advanced security
concept is necessary so that only authorized users are able to
insert/query data into the O-LiFE infrastructure.
Hence, it is necessary to develop a standardized system
for collecting data at national level and develop a data
sharing
policy
resulting
in
a
sustainable
database,
interoperable, shared, and regularly updated. This first step
aims
subsequently
to
create
an
ambitious
Circum-
Mediterranean observatory network.
B.
Crossing Data
O-LIFE aims to collect and exchange data from various
sources, including sensor and human observations. As
discussed in this paper, sensor data can easily be managed by
the Sensor Web infrastructure. However, in some cases it
may be difficult to manage human observations as such data
do not always have a compatible structure. For instance, the
way data are georeferenced, the type of data (e.g., textual
data) can make it difficult to integrate the data directly as an
input of Sensor Web. For this reason, we envision four
possibilities for crossing data that will be explored in our
work:
1)
Transforming non sensor data so as to consider all
data sources as inputs of Sensor Web;
2)
Loading non sensor data directly in relational tables
of the PostgreSQL database used to serialize Sensor
Web data;
3)
Crossing data thanks to an application within our
infrastructure, thus relying on an application server
to deliver the services;
4)
Crossing data outside our platform, this option
being taken by end-users after importing some data
from O-LIFE.
C.
Proposed Architecture
We choose to use the provided by 52° North German
initiative for Geospatial Open Source software, ‘Sensor
Observation
Service’
(SOS)
and
‘Observations
and
Measurements’ (O&M) [5]. The SOS is a web service to
query real-time sensor data and sensor data time series and is
part of the Sensor Web framework. A 52° North PostgreSQL
database
with
a
predefined
schema
by
52°North
implementation of the SOS will be used to store the sensors
data. The PostGIS spatial extension will be included in the
PostgreSQL database. Apache Tomcat will be used as
Servlet container. The proposed architecture is shown in
Figure 2.

O-LiFE architecture

SENSORCOMM 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications

The SOS provides an interface for requesting sensor data
sets based on temporal and spatial query parameters. The
responses of the SOS containing the requested data are then
returned using O&M. O&M is a model defining how to link
observed values with all relevant properties (i.e., location,
time, observed parameter, unit of measurement) that are
necessary to interpret them. In the SOS interface, O&M is
used in two operations:
1)
GetObservation: O&M is the default output
2)
InsertObervation: O&M is used for encoding all
values that shall be inserted into a SOS server
The database server contains environmental data from
different data providers for different thematic and structures.
Sensors data will be hosted on the same server.
IV.
CASE STUDY: SNOW WEATHER STATIONS
The observatory system is designed to support real-time
monitoring which can collect sensors data. Snow weather
stations will be used as our first use case.
A.
Presentation
Lebanon is a real water palace, of which the study of
snow and dynamics coats is instructive for several reasons:
trends, hazards and climate predictability, redistribution of
meltwater and impact on the availability of downstream
water.
The snow weather stations are installed in Lebanon as
part of an agreement for scientific and technical cooperation
for research on snow hydrology project and an observatory
of joint project of the snow in the Mediterranean between
CESBIO, the National Council for Scientific Research in
Lebanon and the Saint Joseph University in Beirut [6].
The three snow weather stations are located in three
different regions (Mzaar, Cedars, Laqlouq) comprising
sensors
measuring
temperature,
snow
height,
relative
humidity, precipitation, air pressure, wind speed and wind
direction. The outdoor sensors are powered by solar cells as
appears in Figure 3. Sensor observations are sent remotely
via a TCP/IP connection through the Internet to the SOS
server hosted in the O-LiFE observatory datacenter using
Figure 3. Snow weather stations in Laqlouq region, Lebanon
GPRS modem. Users will be able to query snow sensors data
and access animated visualization of spatial-temporal data,
including time series presentation. Table I shows a snapshot
of data generated by the snow weather stations.
B.
Expected Results
The proposed approach for in-situ sensor near real-time
data acquisition is supposed to be a first step towards
establishing
the
SWE
framework
within
O-LiFE
Observatory. The observatory aims to establish a national
Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for Lebanon ensuring
acquisition,
archiving
and
management
of
multi-scale
satellite imagery and in-situ datasets for the Lebanese
territory
and
making
it
accessible
by
the
scientific
community and by various public actors involved in
environment and management.
Data from in-situ or remote sensing devices form the
basis for analyzing gradual processes, such as snow melting,
water shortages, or increasing drought. In-situ and satellite
measurements are not directly comparable due to their basic
configurations.
In-situ
sensors
provide
point
based
measurements at ground level whereas satellites observe the
entire atmosphere. The near real time in-situ data could be
used to calibrate and validate remote sensing data and
models. Later, approaches to consolidate remote sensing
data, and in-situ data will be considered to get more accurate
results. This is highly prioritized by the O-LiFE observatory
to make use and share all available source of data.
Nevertheless, a special effort should be made to add
additional in-situ sensors in different research areas and to
include existing in-situ sensors in the country to the
Observatory SDI. Besides, solutions to include mobile
human sensors through mobile applications should be
considered and developed to have vast amount of incoming
georeferenced data and to allocate these data using the SWE
standards.

V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigate the possible ways for data
management within O-Life observatory. We discuss the
specificities of this context and we propose an architecture
based on the standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium.
This work is being currently implemented in the framework
of
a
collaboration
between
French
and
Lebanese
organizations. Many perspectives are associated to this first
approach. First, we aim at benchmarking our proposal with
real data collected in the various data sources. Second, we
aim at studying how our architecture can provide valuable
services to scientists both for raw data crossing and
exchanges and for analytical processing. Finally, we aim at
studying how the O-Life data can be shared through Open
Data for better enabling interoperability and linked to other
open resources [7].
