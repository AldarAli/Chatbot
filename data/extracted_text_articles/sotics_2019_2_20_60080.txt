Abstract—Toxic behavior, in its various forms, often disrupts 
constructive 
discussions 
in 
online 
communities. 
The 
proliferation of smart devices and mobile applications has 
further exacerbated these nefarious acts on various social 
media platforms. Largely, toxic behavior is regulated by 
human moderators employed by the platform operators. 
However, given the volume and speed of content posted on 
online platforms, identifying and deterring these behaviors 
remains challenging. In this study, we propose a Non-
negative 
Matrix 
Factorization 
(NMF) 
technique 
for 
predicting commenter toxicity on YouTube. We utilized the 
YouTube Data API to collect data from the Cable News 
Network (CNN) channel on YouTube.  Our final dataset 
consists of 144 videos, 243,344 commenters, and 421,924 
comments. We then utilized Google’s Perspective API to 
assign a toxicity score to each comment. We used the 
resultant dataset to create a commenter toxicity score 
prediction model. We tested our proposed NMF model 
against other popular prediction methods, comparing speed 
of model execution and the common Root-Mean-Square-
Error (RMSE) accuracy metric. This work sets the stage for 
a richer, more detailed analysis of toxicity on various online 
social media networks.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The 
advent 
of 
computer-mediated 
forms 
of 
interactions has posed several conceptual and practical 
challenges [1]. With emergent norms and conventions, the 
Web, more than any other medium, has offered lowered 
communication thresholds and a broadened geographical 
scope of human interactions [2]. However, despite the 
myriad advantages of utilizing this medium to connect to 
like-minded individuals, a consensus is emerging 
suggesting the presence of malicious actors, otherwise 
known as trolls [3]. These actors (hereafter referred to as 
toxic users) thrive on disrupting the norms of a given 
platform and causing emotional trauma to other users [4]. 
In this study, similar to extant literature, we give an 
operational definition of toxicity as “the usage of rude, 
disrespectful, or unreasonable language that will likely 
provoke or make another user leave a discussion” 
[3][5][6][7]. Therefore, in this regard, toxicity analysis is 
different from sentiment analysis, which is the attempt to 
assign sentiment scores of positive, neutral, and negative 
to text data.  
Social media was once perceived as a liberating 
platform but is now riddled with various forms of toxicity 
[5]. A report by the Pew Research Center indicated that 
73% of adult Internet users have seen someone harassed 
online, and 40% have experienced it personally [3][8]. 
Another survey by Duggan [8] highlighted that 19% of 
teens reported that someone has written or posted 
malicious or embarrassing things about them on social 
networking sites. Due to the growing concerns about the 
impact of online harassment, many platforms are taking 
several steps to curb this phenomenon [5][6][9][10]. For 
instance, on YouTube, a user can simply activate the 
safety mode to filter out offensive language [8]. 
Wikipedia has a policy of “Do not make personal attacks 
anywhere in Wikipedia” [5]. Likewise, platforms like 
CNN.com have moderators that reportedly remove over 
one in five comments that violate community guidelines 
on any given day [3]. The aforementioned are a few 
examples that highlight the negative impacts of toxic 
behavior on the community. Toxic behavior, if not curbed 
at the initial stage, can have a ripple effect. It can dissuade 
other people from joining a community by perceiving the 
community as a hostile environment [5]. 
According to Alexa, the web traffic monitoring service 
owned by Amazon, YouTube is the second most popular 
website globally with over 300 hours of videos uploaded 
every minute and 5 billion videos watched every single 
day [10]. While several studies have attested to the 
widespread manifestation of toxicity within comments on 
YouTube [5][11][12], the burden of access to such a large 
dataset has made a permanent extraction of toxic users 
challenging. Due to the extensive exploitation of these 
platforms by toxic users, automatic detection and 
extraction of toxicity has become a pressing need [9].  
Despite the rich vein of academic research on 
identifying various forms of online toxicity, tackling 
these behaviors at scale remains surprisingly challenging 
[3]. This, along with the immensity of the amount of data 
and the speed with which the data is generated and 
shared, motivated us to propose a Non-negative Matrix 
Factorization (NMF) technique for unraveling latent toxic 
commenter features on YouTube. The intuition behind 
25

using matrix factorization to solve this problem is that 
there should be some latent features that determine the 
toxicity of a commenter on a given video. For instance, 
two commenters may have higher toxicity on a video if 
they both dislike who or what the video is talking about, 
or perhaps, if they both mutually dislike the genre of the 
video. Hence, if we can automatically discover these 
latent features, we should be able to predict the toxicity 
of a certain commenter on a certain video. This work is 
novel in that the NMF approach has not previously been 
applied to this type of problem. The contribution of this 
work is to help understand the relationship between the 
impact of toxicity of a video on the comments, to enable 
us to predict the likely toxicity of a commenter based on 
their past history, and to allow us to determine what kind 
of comments a video will generate based on prior toxicity 
matrix. We selected the CNN news channel’s “must-see 
moments” videos section as an experimental dataset 
because it is rich in various forms of behaviors. 
The remainder of this paper is set out as follows. In 
Section 2, we present a theoretical formulation of the 
problem. Then, we give a brief review of extant literature 
that are most germane to our discussion in Section 3. 
Next, our methodology is described in Section 4, and the 
findings are discussed. Section 5 provides conclusions 
including the limitations of our work, and ideas for future 
work. 
II. 
PROBLEM FORMULATION 
We pose NMF as an optimization problem where, in 
addition to minimizing the reconstruction error of the 
commenter-video toxicity matrix, we also require that the 
factors capture prior knowledge as much as possible. The 
intuition behind using this approach is that there should be 
some latent features (characteristics that are not directly 
observed [30]) that determine the toxicity of a given 
commenter on a specific video. In trying to discover these 
latent features, we assume that the number of features 
would be smaller than the number of commenters and the 
number of videos. To validate the efficacy of this 
approach, we applied this method to a real-world 
YouTube dataset, making our work the first to conduct 
toxicity analyses using NMF on YouTube. 
Given a set of commenters 𝐶 = {𝑐1, … , 𝑐𝑁} and a set 
of videos 𝑉 = {𝑣1, … , 𝑣𝑀}, the toxicity expressed by 
these commenters on all the videos can be expressed in a 
toxicity matrix 𝑇 = [𝑇𝑐,𝑣] 𝑁 𝑥 𝑀 . In this matrix, 𝑇𝑐,𝑣 
represents the average toxicity of a commenter c on a 
video v and it is bounded in the range of [0,1]. Our 
objective in this study is as follows: Given a commenter 
𝑐 ∈  𝐶 and a video  𝑣 ∈  𝑉 for which 𝑇𝑐,𝑣  is unknown, 
predict the toxicity for 𝑐 on video 𝑣 using 𝑇. 𝑇 is 
asymmetric and usually very sparse.  
Let 𝑃 ∈ 𝑅𝐾 𝑥 𝑁and 𝑄 ∈ 𝑅𝐾 𝑥 𝑀 be latent commenter 
and video feature matrices, with column vectors 𝑃𝑐 and 𝑄𝑣  
representing 
K-dimensional 
commenter-specific 
and 
video-specific latent feature vectors of commenter c and 
video v, respectively. The resulting dot product 𝑃𝑐
  𝑇𝑄𝑣 
captures the interaction between commenter c and video 
v. This product approximates commenter c’s toxicity on 
video v, and it is denoted by  𝑇̂𝑐,𝑣 as shown in (1). 
  𝑇̂𝑐,𝑣   = 𝑃𝑐
  𝑇𝑄𝑣  
                                           (1) 
 
 
To learn the latent feature vectors (𝑃𝑐
  and 𝑄𝑣), we 
minimize the regularized squared error (2) on the set of 
known toxicity using stochastic gradient descent.  
 
𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∑
(𝑇𝑐,𝑣 −   𝑇̂𝑐,𝑣)2
(𝑐,𝑣)∈ℑ
+ 𝜆(||(𝑃𝑐|| + ||𝑄𝑣 || )

Here, ℑ is the set of the (c, v) pairs for which 𝑇𝑐,𝑣 is 
known (the training set). The conditional probability of 
the observed toxicity (3) is defined as: 
 
𝑝(𝑇|𝑃, 𝑄, 𝜎𝑇

and variance 𝜎2.

RELATED WORK 
   This section discusses the two categories of related 
work that correspond to our research. The first category 
includes works that have attempted to identify toxicity on 
social media. The second category includes the works that 
have attempted to utilize matrix factorization techniques. 
A. Identifying toxicity on Social Media 
 
Threads of extant literature on antisocial behavior 
suggest that toxicity, in its various forms, oftentimes 
disrupts constructive discussions in an online community 
[3][5][12][13]. Several researchers have tried to identify 
and suggest ways to mitigate toxicity in a community 
[5][13]. Using data collected via crowdsourcing, Wulczyn 
et al. [5] employed machine learning techniques, such as 
linear regression and multilayer perceptron to analyze 
personal attacks on social media. A study by Martens et 
al. [6] utilized Natural Language Processing techniques to 
detect the emergence of undesired and unintended 
behavior in online multiplayer games. Research by Chen 
et al. [14] and Yin et al. [15] used a set of regular 
expressions, n-grams, and supervised learning techniques 
to detect abusive language. Sood et al. [16] combined 
lexical and parser features to identify offensive language 
26

in comments extracted from a social news site. Davidson 
et al. [17] presented a dataset with three kinds of 
comments: hate speech, offensive but non-hateful speech, 
and neither. Hosseini et al. [18] demonstrated the 
vulnerability of most state-of-the-art toxicity detection to 
adversarial inputs. Despite the rich vein of academic work 
on toxicity detection, there is a need for systematic 
research that focuses on detecting, identifying, and 
categorizing toxicity at scale. 
B. Matrix Factorization Techniques 
 
Our work using NMF was heavily inspired by the need 
for an approach that scales to the huge amount of 
streaming data on YouTube. The idea behind matrix 
factorization is to decompose an interaction matrix into a 
product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices 
while 
minimizing 
the 
error 
associated 
with 
the 
decomposition [19]. This technique has been used 
extensively in recommendation systems to discover latent 
features underlying the interactions between users and 
items ratings [20][21]. Yang et al. [22] applied a matrix 
factorization technique for developing a model-based 
community detection algorithm that detects densely 
overlapping communities in a network. Ma et al. [20] 
utilized a probabilistic matrix factorization technique to 
solve the data sparsity and poor prediction accuracy 
problems by employing both users’ social network 
information 
and 
rating 
records 
to 
perform 
recommendation. Zhao et al. [23] employed a matrix 
factorization method on each of the communities in a 
unidirectional social network.  By advancing previous 
work, Jamali et al. [24] proposed a matrix factorization 
technique with trust propagation for recommendation 
systems. Chen et al. [25] proposed a novel social 
recommendation method that fuses user’s social status 
with homophily using a matrix factorization technique. 
Peng et al. [21] proposed a social trust and segmentation-
based matrix factorization recommendation algorithm. 
Ozer et al. [26] leveraged matrix factorization techniques 
to uncover political networks on Twitter. However, to the 
best of our knowledge, our work is the first to apply 
matrix factorization to unravel toxic features on YouTube.

METHODOLOGY 
 
Our methodology (Fig. 1) consists of three phases: 1) 
data collection and data processing; 2) data preparation 
and toxicity assignment; and, 3) matrix factorization of 
commenter-video toxicity matrix. 
 
Figure 1. Research methodology. 
A. Data Collection 
 
To build our dataset for illustrating our proposed 
method, we first utilized Google’s YouTube API to 
extract videos’ and commenters’ data from the “must see 
moments” video playlist from the CNN channel. To 
reduce “noise” in extracted data, several data processing 
steps were subsequently performed including data 
formatting, data standardization and data normalization 
using the Python programming language. Our final dataset 
consists of 144 videos, 243,344 commenters, and 421,924 
comments.  
B. Data Preparation 
 
The next step in our methodology was to assign 
toxicity scores to each comment in the dataset. To 
accomplish this, we leveraged a classification tool called 
Perspective API [27], which was developed by Google's 
Project Jigsaw' and 'Counter Abuse Technology' teams 
(Table I). This model uses a Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) trained with word-vector inputs to 
determine whether a comment could be perceived as 
“toxic" to a discussion [27][28]. The API returns a 
probability score between 0 and 1, with higher values 
indicating a greater likelihood of the toxicity label. Table I 
is an excerpt of the resultant toxicity dataset where 
toxicity scores have been assigned to each comment.

C. Data Analysis 
 
Before applying algorithms for toxicity prediction, we 
conducted some preliminary data analysis on our 
YouTube CNN video comments dataset. Fig. 2 shows the 
distribution of overall toxicity in our dataset. Although 
most of the comments (80%) were assigned a toxicity 
score of less than 0.5, a significant portion (20%) of the 
27

comments were assigned a toxicity score of greater than 
0.5 (over 84,000 comments). The mean toxicity score was 
about 0.27. 
 
Figure 2. Distribution of overall toxicity. 
 
Most of the toxic comments within the CNN dataset 
were categorized as being some type of “INSULT”—a 
negative comment towards a person or a group of people, 
followed closely by “THREAT”—an intention to inflict 
pain, injury, or violence against an individual or group 
(Fig. 3).  
 
Figure 3. Distribution of toxicity by toxicity dimension. 
Fig. 4 shows the box plots for each of the toxicity 
dimensions and reveals that the “INSULT” and 
“PROFANITY”—the usage of swear/curse words, or 
other obscene/profane language—had the widest spread 
with regard to the distribution of toxicity scores. 
However, compared to other toxicity dimensions, sexually 
explicit comments were the least severe. 
Figure 4. Box plot for each toxicity dimension. 
 
Word clouds generated from the dataset reveal some 
of the content that relates to these five toxicity dimensions 
(Fig. 5-7). As can be seen in the content of each word 
cloud, some of the categories are more obvious than 
others; for example, the prevalence of terms such as, 
“kill” and “shooting” within the “THREAT” toxicity 
dimension (Fig. 6). Similarly, the prevalence of terms 
such as, "black", "white", "fake", "Democrat", and 
"Republican" within the "IDENTITY ATTACK" toxicity 
dimension (Fig. 7) give indications of why these 
comments were categorized as belonging to this specific 
toxicity dimension. Some of the word clouds that we 
generated could not be included in this work because of 
the obscenity, profanity, and sexually explicit terms that 
they revealed. These word clouds corresponded to the 
toxicity dimensions of "PROFANITY" and "SEXUALY 
EXPLICIT".

D. Evaluation of the approach 
The next step in our methodology was to apply the 
algorithms for toxicity prediction and compare the results. 
The most commonly used metrics for assessing the 
effectiveness of predictive methods, such as the proposed 
NMF algorithm are the mean squared error and Root-
Mean-Square-Error (RMSE), the latter having been used 
in the Netflix Prize [19]. RMSE is a measure that can be 
used to compare predictions against real data. The smaller 
the RMSE value, the better the model. The error was 
computed, and gradient descent was performed to 
minimize the error. We used a random 70/30 split of our 
dataset to create training and test sets and applied 5-fold 
cross-validation. Using Surprise Python Scikit Package 
[29], we compared the result of the NMF approach with 
other techniques: CoClustering (Collaborative filtering 
algorithm) and NormalPredictor (Algorithm based on the 
normal distribution of the training set) (Table II).  
TABLE II. EVALUATING RMSE ON 5 SPLIT(S). SMALLER THE

CoClustering

NormalPredictor

Compared to CoClustering and NormalPredictor, the 
NMF approach performs better in terms of accuracy 
(having the lowest RMSE). Table III shows that the NMF 
approach 
outperformed 
NormalPredictor 
based 
on 
computation time, but not CoClustering. The mean 
computation time for NMF was 0.54 seconds, while 
NormalPredictor took 0.56 seconds and CoClustering 
took 0.45 seconds. This experiment was conducted on a 
machine with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-8893 v4 @ 
3.20GHz 3.19 GHz (4 processors) and 3.25 TB RAM.  
The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can 
be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly 
with the number of observations.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
 
In this study, we addressed the problem of identifying 
and predicting toxicity on online social media networks. 
We chose to focus on user comments posted on a sample 
of CNN videos posted on YouTube as a case study for 
illustrating 
our 
methodology. 
The 
challenges 
in 
addressing this problem include an ongoing issue of 
balancing freedom of expression with curtailing harmful 
content. The contribution of this paper is that it outlines a 
scalable methodology for first identifying toxicity within 
commenter text data posted on an online social media 
network and then predicting the toxicity levels of each 
commenter. We found that the proposed NMF-based 
approach performed better than some other techniques for 
predicting toxicity scores in terms of and accuracy and has 
the potential to perform better in terms of computation 
time. These findings demonstrate how the presence of 
toxicity in a set of text corpora can be identified, 
categorized, and measured, and how those metrics can be 
used for prediction. Our findings advance the research in 
this topic in that this analysis serves as a steppingstone in 
a long line of future work that can be done to better 
understand the origin, propagation and impact of toxicity 
on online social media networks. The general implications 
of this work are that by systematically assessing toxicity, 
this work sets the stage for developing a richer, more 
robust model for understanding the flow of toxicity on 
various online social media networks and for developing 
tools for toxicity control and prevention. There are a few 
limitations to this work, however. One is that it is 
challenging 
to 
model 
a 
cold-start 
commenter—a 
commenter that has never posted a comment—as new 
users will not have an initial toxicity score. Additionally, 
the commenter-video toxicity matrix can become very 
sparse with increasing volume of data thereby increasing 
the reconstruction error. Our immediate next steps will 
investigate possible solutions to address the limitations. 
Long term future work includes running experiments on 
multiple datasets and considering other variables to 
determine whether this can improve prediction accuracy. 
We anticipate applying the NMF method to data from 
other online social media networks. For instance, a 
sophisticated version of the NMF approach can be used to 
capture the bidirectional latent relations between user’s 
toxicity preferences across domain through transfer 
learning. Future work should also attempt to model the 
spread of toxicity on online social media networks and 
determine whether these metrics and predictions can be 
used for developing preventive measures.
