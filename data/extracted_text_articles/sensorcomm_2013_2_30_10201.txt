Ultra Wideband Impulse Radio (UWB-IR) transmission is a

However, the presence of multipath propagation presents a
signiﬁcant challenge in terms of ranging, as they can result in
biased distance estimates. In this paper, we present multipath
effects mitigation methods using bilateral transceiver-power con-
trol algorithms, which are capable of: (i) optimizing the signal to
noise ratio (SNR) of leading path signal and maintaining the
connectivity; and (ii) cooperating with a practical symmetric
double-sided two-way ranging protocol. Relevant aspects of power
control are discussed using an automatic control framework. We
evaluate the resulting performance and compare with existing
non-power control techniques. Experimental results show that the
proposed multipath effects mitigation approach is more robust
against the non-power control based ranging errors.

INTRODUCTION
Location-awareness becomes an essential aspect of wireless
sensor networks (WSNs) and will enable a wide variety of
applications, in both the commercial and the military sec-
tors. Ultra Wideband Impulse Radio (UWB-IR) transmission
provides robust signaling, as well as high resolution rang-
ing capabilities [1]. Therefore, UWB represents a promising
technology for ranging and localization applications through
time-of-arrival (TOA) technique [2], [3]. IEEE has recognized
the need to standardize UWB technology for use in personal
area networks (PANs) and has established the IEEE 802.15.4a
standard specifying a new UWB physical layer for WSNs [4].
In practical scenarios, however, a number of challenges remain
before UWB ranging and communication can be deployed.
These mainly include uncommon time reference, clock drift,
low sampling rate, multipath propagation and non-line-of-
sight (NLOS) propagation. The use of practical Symmetric
Double-Sided Two-Way (SDS-TW) ranging protocol [4] and
Energy Detector based TOA estimation methods [5]-[7] can
signiﬁcantly solve the uncommon time reference, clock drift
and low sampling rate issues. In real-world environment, the
multipath propagation issue is especially critical for 802.15.4a
ranging system, since uncertain multipath effects (like reﬂec-
tion, scattering and diffraction) introduce noise sources in the
TOA estimation, thus seriously affecting the Signal-to-Noise
(SNR) of the leading path signal and ranging performance.
Indoor environments have a high occurrence of multipath
propagation situations. It is therefore critical to understand the
impact of multipath propagation on 802.15.4a ranging systems
and to develop techniques that mitigate their effects.
Super-resolution TOA technique is proposed to estimate the
channel multipaths TOA and amplitude using MUSIC [8]. A
pattern to identify closely-spaced direct path and ground reﬂec-
tion is given in [9]. The main drawback of existing multipath
mitigation techniques is difﬁculty in determining the direct
path and the large number of multipath components especially
when paths overlapping. The Cramer-Rao lower bound of TOA
shows that SNR is, a more accurate indication of the link status
and ranging accuracy [10]. This paper considers a channel
quality improvement approach. In particular, we propose the
use of power control to optimize the SNR and thus performing
multipath mitigation. Power control algorithms for wireless
communication systems have been investigated and designed
to satisfy the QOS requirements [11]. The IEEE 802.15.4 (Zig-
bee) based mobile tracking system has used the power control
methods to solve the location error [12]. In this work, we
ﬁrstly performed an extensive indoor measurement campaign
with FCC-compliant 802.15.4a UWB radios to quantify the
effect of multipath propagation. From these channel impulse
responses, we extract features that are representative of the
multipath propagation conditions. We then develop multipath
effect mitigation algorithms based on bilateral transceiver-
power control protocol. Performance comparison is made with
the non-power control scheme.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces a practical ranging method and SNR estimation.
Section III analyzes the features of multipath propagation. Sec-
tion IV describes bilateral power control algorithms. Numerical

performance results are provided in Section V, and we draw
our conclusions in Section VI.

IEEE 802.15.4A RANGING AND SNR CALCULATION
To solve the uncommon time reference and clock drift
issues, 802.15.4a ranging system [14] employs a Symmetric
Double-Sided Two-Way (SDS-TW) ranging protocol [4] and
its architecture is illustrated in Fig.1 (a). It requires both
transceivers to record time-of-transmitting (TOT) values and
TOA values to measure round-trip times (RTT) and the time-
of- ﬂight (TOF). In practical implementation, the TOF calcu-
lation can be expressed as:
TOF = RTTL − DF + RTTF − DL
4
(1)
Where, RTTL = TOA2 − TOT1 is the round-trip time
of leader, DF = TOT2 − TOA1 is the response delay of
follower, RTTF = TOA3 − TOT2 is the round-trip time of
follower, and DL = TOT3 − TOA2 is the response delay of
leader. And the distance is:
d = ˙c × TOF
(2)
Where, d is the antenna-to-antenna distance and ˙c is the speed
of electromagnetic waves.
A. Performance Limits of TOA-based Ranging
Ideally, TOA estimate is given by the time instant cor-
responding to the maximum absolute peak at the output of
the marched ﬁlter over the observation interval. The perfor-
mance of the estimator achieves the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB) for signal SNR in AWGN channel as described in
[10]. The mean square error of any unbiased estimate ˆτ of the
true TOA τ can be lower bounded by:
V (ξ) ≥
1
2
√
2πB
√
SNR
(3)
Where, the V (ξ) is the variance of TOA error, ξ = bτ −τ is the
TOA error. B is the effective signal bandwidth. It shows that
SNR is a more accurate indication of the ranging performance.
B. SNR Calculation of 802.15.4a Impulse Signal
The SNR, computed by the receiver, is equal to the differ-
ence between the power of received signal and the noise power.
The received signal power depends on the transmission power,
the distance between transmitter and receiver, the environment
(walls, obstacles will reﬂect and distort the signal creating a
multipath effect) and interference from other sources. There
are many SNR models have been proposed, one is the most
correct SNR model [13] is:
SNR = (
N
X
i=1
(SNRi)−1)−1
(4)
Where, SNRi = Er/Ei, Er is the desired received signal
power, Ei is related to ith noise sources including multipath
components, multiple-user interference and thermal noise. It is
worth noting that due to multipath effects, a Gaussian random
path loss variable N(0, σ) exists in the path loss model with
a zero mean and σ standard deviation.
Fig. 1: (a) SDS-TW protocol and (b) Energy Detector based
TOA estimator.
The SNR of the received leading path signal is measured
in the leading path channel impulse response in this wrok,
see Fig.1 (b). The received leading path signal is ﬁrst passed
through a marched ﬁlter (MF). The observed signal forms the
input to the Energy Detector (ED), whose output is sampled
at every Tint seconds, Tint is the tick time units. Tob is
the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) observation duration.
n = Tob/Tint. The system searches the index with peak power
mp in the CIR. The received signal power is with two-sided
power spectral density in the CIR and the mp is the central
axis. According to signal sampling duration Ts, the effective
signal duration in the CIR should be 2κTint,κ = Ts/Tint. The
total signal power is then measured by P = Pmp+2κ
i=mp−2κ Pi.
Pi is the power of ith index. The average power of all
indices of the effective signal is Pa = P/4κ. The deviation
is then calculated as the noise part Pn = (Pmp+2κ
i=mp−2κ(pi −
Pa))/4κ. Hence, the effective signal part is calculated as
Pr = (Pmclp+2κ
i=mclp
pi) − 2κPn. mclp is the time stamp window
index, as indicated by ﬁrst byte of channel response read. The
SNR of received leading path is:
SNR = 10 log(Pr/Pn)
(5)
III.
MULTIPATH EFFECTS OBSERVATION
The aim of this experimental effort is to build a database
containing a variety of propagation conditions (without multi-
path and with multipath). The measurements were made using
two the world’s ﬁrst IEEE 802.15.4a standard compliant UWB-
IR transceivers that were developed by Decawave Company
[14]. Both transceivers (called leader and follower respectively)
set up a typical ranging system to measure the antenna-to-
antenna distance and record the ranging measurements. The
802.15.4a UWB-IR ranging parameters are listed in Table
I. To compare the features of non-multipath and multipath
propagation, ranging measurements were implemented in an
anechoic chamber (AC) (without multipath propagation) and
in an indoor ofﬁce (OFC) (with multipath propagation), using
a distance of 0.7m in LOS condition, see Fig.2 (a) and (b).
Various transmission ranges are selected to capture a variety
of operating conditions from 2.5m to 30m, see Fig.2 (c).
The ranging error is shown using the empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF).
The Channel Impulse Response observation duration is 992

evident at higher transmission powers. Few adjacent peaks
with comparable amplitude to the largest peak are exhibited
in the CIRs and leading path detection more straightforward.

adjacent peaks with comparable amplitude to the largest peak
are exhibited in the channel impulse responses (CIR). The
adjacent peaks increase the possibility that a reﬂection is
selected as the leading path resulting in the introduction of
ranging inaccuracy. Fig.4 shows the CDF of the ranging error.
In the anechoic chamber, the ranging error below 15cm/ 10cm
occurs 100% and 85% of the 7500 measurements, respectively.
In the indoor ofﬁce, the ranging error below 15cm/10cm occurs
20% and 5% of the 7500 measurements, respectively. Hence,
we can say this practical ranging method is reliable and
accurate; and the multipath propagation adversely affect the
ranging performance.
B. 802.15.4a Multipath Propagation Channel
In indoor environments, due to various obstructions, the
multipath effect is uncertain and random. Fig.5 shows the
multipath channel features ranging from 2.5m to 30m, using
different signal outputs (-31.5dBm, -22.5dBm and -13.5dBm).
At a ﬁxed distance, the higher the transmit-power, the lower
the SNR, see Fig.5 (b). With the distance increasing, Received
signal power (Pr) decreases almost linearly, see Fig.5 (a).
However, the SNR increases with distance increasing before
10m, see Fig.5 (b). After 10m, the SNR obtained using
minimum transmit-power (-31.5dBm) decreases. However, the
SNR increases when using higher transmit-power (-13.5dBm).
The noise power (Pn) decreases and reaches to the noise ﬂoor,
see Fig.5 (c). It means that the multipath effects become
less impact on the UWB signal transmission with distance
increasing. The greater the transmission range, the poorer
the connectivity and the lower the signal receive rate (SRR),
see Fig.5 (d). Hence, there is a tradeoff between SNR and
connectivity.

BILATERAL TRANSMITTER POWER CONTROL
ALGORITHMS
A. Power Control Aspects
Being subjective, some relevant aspects of the power con-
trol in 802.15.4a UWB ranging system should be considered.
• Ranging algorithm. This is the basic framework for UWB
ranging system. Power control loop should be integrated into
this framework.
• Power constraints. The transmission powers are consid-
ered due to the device limitations and the FCC limits.
• Time delays. Measuring and control signaling take time,
resulting in time delays are typically ﬁxed due to standardized
signaling protocols.
• Tradeoff management. The one is the most correct BER
expression [1] is:
BER = 1
2erfc(
r
1
2SNR)
(6)
Where, the erfc is the error function. The BER is used to
manage the tradeoff between receive-power and SNR. A set-
point SNR value can be selected and related directly to BER.
B. Power Control Methods
According to the ranging algorithm, see Fig.1(a), a TOF is
calculated through the bilateral communication links between
the leader and the follower. Hence, both UWB transceivers
need to implement the power control loop integrated into
the ranging algorithm. Consider the arrangement of power
control scheme at one UWB transceiver in Fig.6, the transmit-
power level is increased/decreased depending whether the SNR
decoded (γj(t)) from the jth remote signal rj(t) is above or
below the target SNR (γT ), and implemented as:
ej(t) = γj(t) − γT
(7)
pj(t + 1) = pj(t) + ∆ej(t)
(8)
pj(t + 1) =min{Pmax, pj(t) + ∆ej(t)}
∥ max{Pmin, pj(t) + ∆ej(t)}
(9)
From equation (7) to (9), the ej(t) is the power update
command, ∆ is the minimum interval of the device power
settings. Pmax is maximum transmit-power of the FCC limits
and Pmin is the minimum power of the device limits. The
Pmax and Pmin are controlled to ensure the inherent hard-
ware saturation limitations are not surpassed. pj(t + 1) is an
integrating controller with Cj{∆ej(t)} = ∆ej(t) in one-slot
cycle. This can be denoted as quick power control (QPC). At
the same time, the SNR of the leading pulse measured at local
mote γi(t) is sent back to the remote UWB mote for remote
power control implementation.
Another power control algorithm is that makes it possible
to emulate slower update rates, or to turn off power control by
transmitting a series of ej(t). It can be denoted as slow power
control (SPC). In a n-slot cycle (k = 1...n), the power update
command ej(t) in equation (10) is computed according to:
ej(t) =
Pn
k=1 ek(t)
n

control loop at local transceiver.
The decision feedback where the sign of error ej(t) is fed
back resulting in equation (11):
sj(t) = sign(γj(t) − γT )
(11)
An adaptive ﬁxed step size power law (FPC) is considered. The
power pj(t) is increased or decreased by βdBm depending on
the sign of error sj(t) as equation (12):
pj(t + 1) = pj(t) + {−β,sj(t)<0
+β,sj(t)>0
(12)
In the ranging architecture, see Fig.1 (a), the delay, is set
for mitigating the clock drift issue (about 300ms). Hence,
cooperating with this ranging algorithm, there is enough time
for measuring and control signaling delay (D1) in the power
control loop. The other delay (D2) is the system delay which
is also considered into the ranging algorithm.
V.
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
The above power control methods and a pre-existing non-
power control (NPC) method are critically assessed using a
multipath propagation issue scenario. Stationary (from 2.5m
to 30m) and mobile (from 1m to 8m with a trolley) ranging
experiments are set up inside a real building, see Fig.2 (c) and
(d). A target SNR value of 43dB is selected for both UWB
transceivers, guaranteeing a BER of < 3e−11, veriﬁed using
equation (6). The ∆ is set to be 1.5dBm and the ej(t) is
round to integer. The maximum transmit-power (-13.5dBm)
is selected at the beginning for strongest links. A frame is
a record of the receive-time of the leading pulse according to
the ranging algorithm. Basically, a ranging frame-time is about
0.6s which is equal to 2 delays (300ms) plus 2 TOFs.
A. Stationary power control test
For the purposes of clarity, the response of power control
methods at a distance of 17.5m are presented graphically in
Fig.7 to Fig.8. The NPC uses maximum transmit-power (-
13.5dBm), see Fig.7 (d), and the response shows that system
can not reach to the target SNR (43dB), see Fig.8 (d). The QPC
method, using equations (7)-(9), updates the signal outputs per
frame, see Fig.7 (a), and the instant SNR measured reaches the
target SNR (43dB) at the ﬁrst frame, see Fig.8 (a). The SPC
method updates signal output every 10 frames, see Fig.7 (b),
and maintains the target SNR after about 15 frames. The FPC
method updates with a ﬁxed step size, reaching to the target
SNR is slower than the QPC but faster than the SPC, see Fig.7
(c) and Fig.8 (C).

respectively. The worst case is 20cm. Without power control,
using the NPC method, ranging error below 10cm/5cm occurs

troller conﬁguration is deﬁned as the average transmit-power
consumed by two transceivers operating using a particular
power control algorithm for the duration of an experiment.
For example 100% transmit-power efﬁciency in this context
would imply that the mote is transmitting using its minimum
output power setting. Fig.10 plots the percentage transmit-
power efﬁciency for each of the mote control conﬁgura-
tion. The utilization of power control methods can get more
transmit-power efﬁciency (up to 99%) than non-power control
method (47%). With the distance increasing from 2.5m to 30m,
the transmit-power efﬁciency of the power control methods
decreases from 99% to 50%, that because of the controller
increases the output power to maintain SNR and connectivity.
B. Mobile power control test
The mobile ranging test is made to observe the performance
of the power control method in the real-world environment
with uncertain factors such as the motion of the leader and
time-varying wireless channel. Being subjective, the SPC
method with lower power updating rate is not powerful for the
mobile ranging when compared to the QPC and FPC methods.
Thus, in this section, we only consider the NPC, FPC and
QPC. The follower (F) is stationary for the duration of the
experiment. The leader (L) moves from 1m (from the follower)
in a straight line to a distance of 8m with an approximate
constant velocity of (20.4 sec/m), see Fig.2 (d).
The QPC (blue line) and FPC (violet line) methods adjust
transmit-power according to whether the SNR is greater or
less than the target SNR (43dB), see Fig.11 (a). The NPC
method keeps the maximum transmit-power (red line). Before
the 100th frame point, both UWB transceivers employing QPC

and FPC use minimum transmit-power (-31.5dBm) and the
SNRs are less than 43dB. However, the value of the SNRs
increases with distance increasing, see Fig.11 (b). Whereas, the
SNRs obtained from the NPC are always less than 38dB, but
the value increases with distance increasing from the starting
point (32dB). In Fig.11 (c), the leader moves from 1m (starting
at about 13 frames point) to the end (8m test-point) with a
approximate velocity (34frames/m). When employing power
control methods (QPC and FPC), the slopes of the ranging
curve of both transceivers approximately meet the velocity.
The power controlled ranging channel is more stable than non-
power control (NPC) which obtains highly variable ranging
estimates (0 ∼ 4m difference) during the moving period.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the bilateral transmitter output
power control algorithm to deal with the effects of multi-
path propagation. This technique does not require changing
the ranging protocol and time-of-arrival estimation method. To
validate this technique in realistic scenarios, we performed an
extensive indoor measurement campaign using FCC-compliant
IEEE 802.15.4a impulse UWB radios. The bilateral power
control method that is capable of dynamically controlling the
outputs of the 802.15.4a transceivers to optimize the SNR of
leading path signal. We observe that our bilateral power control
method can: (1) cooperate seamlessly with a practical symmet-
ric double-sided two-way ranging method; (2) compensate for
uncertain multi-path effects and maintain connectivity and (3)
signiﬁcantly improve the ranging performance for multipath
environments for both the stationary and mobile case in line-
of-sight conditions.
