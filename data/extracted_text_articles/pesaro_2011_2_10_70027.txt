Abstract—This paper studies the impact of channel signaling
resolution on the performance of a (coherent) distributed beam-
forming (DBF) algorithm. This analysis is done in the context of
a wireless access network, whose ultimate goal is to give adequate
broadband coverage for users inside buildings. In this situation,
instead of trying to reach the serving base station (BS) directly,
we assume that each indoor subscriber receives assistance from
a cooperative network that is deployed in its premises. This
surrounding cooperative network is formed by a (relative) large
number of low-cost relay nodes (RNs) with only one antenna. To
simplify the analysis, communication in the ﬁrst link (i.e., from
the subscriber’s terminal to RNs) is assumed costless, making the
bottleneck lay in the second link (i.e., from RNs to serving BS). To
carry out the analysis, a suitable closed-form approximation for
the outage probability that correspond to a given received signal-
to-noise power ratio (SNR) threshold is derived. Our analysis
reveals that the power gain sacriﬁced when using a small amount
of phase feedback information is not considerable in the light of
the performance loss that is observed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Standardization activities on wireless communication net-
works advance rapidly, fueling the creation of new research
topics to cope with the ever-increasing demand of higher data
rates for mobile radio access. Given that most part of current
voice calls and data usage takes place inside buildings [1], the
provision of adequate broadband coverage in indoor environ-
ments is a crucial issue [2], [3]. Since indoor users are often
behind walls with high attenuation, the penetration losses that
radio signals experience put the mobile terminals in a very
disadvantageous position, increasing the energy consumption
required for signal transmission and reducing the amount of
information that can be transfered effectively. Trying to give
a solution to this problem, recent developments showed that
such difﬁculties can be overcome by deploying femtocells
(i.e., small and low-power wireless access points that connect
mobile devices to the cellular network via the wired con-
nection of the subscriber) [4]. Nevertheless, a rather different
approach is analyzed in this work, where we propose to boost
the communication performance of indoor users deploying a
cooperative network in the premises of the subscriber. This
network will be formed by a large number of low-cost relay
nodes (RNs), that will assist the communication between
the mobile terminal (i.e., main transmitter) and the network
base station (i.e., main receiver) implementing a distributed
beamforming (DBF) strategy.
The main idea behind DBF is simple: distribute a common
message within many low-power single-antenna RNs, and
then coordinate the re-transmission of this information in the
direction of the intended destination (conﬁguring a virtual
transmit antenna array) [5], [6]. When the main transmitter and
the RNs share the same environment (e.g., the same room), the
communication in the ﬁrst link can be carried out with almost
no cost (in terms of time and power). In this situation, the
bottleneck of this system lies in the second link, and can be
mitigated by adjusting the channel response (i.e., amplitudes
and phases) that the main receiver sees from each individual
RN. This enables the coherent combination of the multiple
replicas of the original message at the intended destination.
The potential beneﬁt of deploying a DBF scheme is well
known in the literature: full diversity beneﬁt and M-fold power
gain for M active RNs in the network1 [7]. However, in
absence of channel state information (CSI) at the RNs, the use
of distributed space-time coding was suggested to obtain full
diversity gains in the second link (no power gain is possible
in this situation) [8].
The main challenges in a DBF scheme are in the synchro-
nization of the RF carriers of all RNs, and in the estimation of
each individual channel gain that the main receiver observes
in the second link. An adaptive 1-bit feedback DBF algorithm
that tries to solve these problems was developed by Mudumbai
et al. in [9]. The basic idea behind Mudumbai’s DBF algorithm
is interesting: make independent random phase adjustment at
the RNs in each iteration, and retain only those phases that
increase the received signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) at the
main receiver. Even though Mudumbai’s DBF algorithm has
shown many interesting convergence properties, in this paper
we focus in a rather different approach. We assume that the
main receiver has the capability to estimate the individual
channels from each RN in the second link (using a N-bits
uniform quantizer). Since the locations of RNs remain ﬁxed
during the whole data communication, only the phase portions
of the channel gains are assumed to take random (unknown)
values at the beginning of the phase conﬁguration process. A
closed-form approximation for the outage probability of this
deterministic DBF algorithm is derived. Based on this analysis
1The power gain increases to a factor of M2 if each RN transmits always
at full power, independently of the number of active RNs in the network.

it is possible to conclude that a relatively small amount of
phase signaling information (i.e., N = 3 phase feedback bits
per channel) is sufﬁcient to obtain a performance close to the
one observed in presence of perfect channel phase information
at the RNs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents the system model, the assumptions on the limited
feedback DBF algorithm, and the details of the performance
criterion that will be used to carry out the analysis. Section III
provides expression for the distribution of the received SNR,
while Section IV presents the numerical results and studies the
impact of the number of feedback bits per channel (i.e., N) and
the number of active RNs (i.e., M) to the outage probability
of the system. Finally, Section V presents the conclusions of
the work.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
The general layout of our cooperative relaying system is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The system consists of a main transmitter,
a main receiver, and M active RNs that share the same physical
space with the main transmitter (e.g., the same room or ofﬁce).
All devices are equipped with a single transmit/receive antenna
(in accordance with the low-cost requirement for RNs). In
our system model, main transmitter and RNs operate in a
half-duplex mode in a decode-and-forward (DF) fashion. Thus,
during the ﬁrst hop of duration T1, message intended for the
main receiver is sent from main transmitter to the nearby
RNs. During the second hop of duration T2, the message
is sent from the RNs to main receiver. Attenuation on this
ﬁrst link is assumed to be small, and channel is either static
or slowly varying (e.g., line of sight channel model). This
makes possible to assume that communication on the ﬁrst link
can be accomplished with (almost) no cost in terms of power
and/or time. The long distance between clustered RNs and
main receiver implies a large attenuation on the second link,
when compared to the attenuation on ﬁrst link. This situation
makes the second hop the bottleneck of the system, and its
analysis the main goal of this paper.
As depicted in Fig. 1, a low-rate, reliable, and delay-free
feedback channel exists between the main receiver and the
active RNs. Main receiver uses this channel to convey a
quantized version of the phase adjustment that each RN should
apply in transmission (to maximize SNR in reception). In other
words, the limited feedback information that main receiver re-
ports is used to establish a virtual antenna array (VAA) in the
second link. Note that since all RNs share the same physical
location with the main transmitter, no multi-hop strategy is
able to provide a better performance than the one obtained
with a direct connection between main transmitter and main
receiver. Therefore, the only valid option to reach the main
receiver is that multiple active RNs transmit cooperatively at
the same time, focusing the resulting VAA beam toward the
direction of the intended destination over the second link.
Based on the above model, the received signal at transmis-
sion time interval i is of the form
r[i] = H[i]s[i] + n[i],
(1)
where H[i] is the resulting sum channel, s[i] is the complex
modulation symbol, and n[i] refers to an additive white Gaus-
sian noise (AWGN) sample. Power control is not applied in
the RNs and thus, the total transmit power Pt in the second
hop remains ﬁxed during the whole communication.
In case of unitary noise power, the received SNR in the
second hop is given by
Γ[i] =

M
X
m=1
p
γm[i] wm[i]ejψm[i]
2
,
(2)
where γm[i] represents the received SNR from the m-th RN,
ψm[i] is the corresponding channel phase response, and wm[i]
is the transmit weight that the m-th RN applies.
In our system model it is also assumed that:
• All devices admit ﬁxed location. Thus, channel is not
changing in time and we have γm[i] = γm, ψm[i] = ψm.
• Weights w[i] are used to make phase adjustments in
RNs. Required feedback message for adjustments may
be spread over a time span, denoted by i = 1, 2, . . . , I.
• Performance analysis considers the resulting sum channel
when all phase adjustments are done (i.e. after I time
intervals). The corresponding weights in this situation are
denoted by wm (i.e., time index can be dropped since
phase adjustments have been done and channel is static).
• Phases ψm are not calibrated in RNs, but they behave as
independent, random samples. In the analysis we study
the performance over any initial phase conﬁguration.
Therefore, we assume that phases ψm are independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform random vari-
ables (RVs) that take values on interval (−π, π).
• To fulﬁll the accurate timing requirement, RNs monitor
the standard synchronization signals either from destina-
tion (i.e., main receiver) or source (i.e., main transmitter).
The signal phase shifts that RNs apply easily create fre-
quency selectivity, which is seen as an increased multipath
effect in the resulting wireless channel. Yet, in our system
model we assume that the synchronization error of RNs is
small when compared to symbol length. Then, it is possible
to assume that the duration of the effective channel impulse
response is not (considerably) increased in this situation.
A. Assumptions on Limited Feedback Scheme
As shown in Fig. 1, in the second stage of the communica-
tion there are M active RNs transmitting a common symbol
s to the main receiver. In order to maximize the SNR in the
main receiver, each RN adjusts its transmission signal using a
complex, individual beamforming weight

We note that the individual power (i.e., the module of wm) is
selected based on the number of active RNs in the cooperative
system, so that total transmission power is always normalized

(and fair comparisons are possible). The error free feedback
indicating the best index n is provided through the dedicated
feedback channel. Number of feedback bits per RN is N.
Phases φm are selected in the main receiver as follows:
Receiver ﬁrst estimates the phases ψm from RN speciﬁc
reference signals. After that, it selects the phases φm from
quantization set Q such that |θm| = |φm − ψm| is minimized.
As a result, adjusted phases θm will be uniformly i.i.d. on the
interval (− π
2N ,
π
2N ) [10]. Thus, phase adjustments are done
independently, using a common phase reference at the receiver
side.
B. Performance Criterion: Outage Probability
There are two main performance measures that have been
deﬁned in the literature to carry out (theoretical) performance
analyses: the ergodic capacity and the outage capacity [11].
The ergordic capacity is the long-term average transmission
rate, and can be achieved implementing coding schemes that
span code words over several coherence time intervals of the
fading channel. This measure is feasible for applications with
no strict delay constraints. However, in case of constant-rate
delay-limited transmissions with coding over a single channel
realization, the outage capacity becomes a more appropriate
performance indicator. The outage capacity deﬁnes the maxi-
mum constant rate that can be maintained for a given outage
probability.
In practical system implementations, however, a slightly
different criterion is widely used. When mobile system perfor-
mance is evaluated, it is assumed that reception is successful if
SNR at the receiver (for the given transmission time interval)
is large enough. In other words, a user is said to be supported
if its instantaneous received SNR satisﬁes
Γ[i] ≥ γ0,
(5)
where the threshold γ0 is deﬁned to guarantee a certain level
of service (for the given transmission rate). In this situation,
the statistical performance requirement
Pr {Γ[i] ≤ γ0} = Pr out(γ0)
(6)
is deﬁned as the outage probability for a given target SNR
threshold. This is the performance measure that will be used
throughout this work.
III. PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTED BEAMFORMING
WITH LIMITED FEEDBACK
According to the system model presented in Section II, the
relevant expression for SNR is of the form
Γ[i] = |H[i]|2 = Pt
M

M
X
m=1
√γmejθm[i]

,
(7)
where individual received SNRs {γm}M
m=1 are known before-
hand, and remain constant during the whole communication
process. Since we want to analyze the effect of the amount of
feedback signaling (i.e., N) based on the performance measure
presented in (6), a suitable expression for the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) F (Γ[i]|γ1, . . . , γM) should be
obtained. Unfortunately, a tractable closed-form expression
for this distribution can only be obtained for very speciﬁc
situations (i.e., not for all M and N). However, since in this
paper we are interested in studying the outage probability
when the number of active RNs is high (i.e., when M ≥ 10),
we will use the central limit theorem to show that RV (7)
can be successfully approximated as the sum of two indepen-
dent chi-squared (χ2) distributed RVs (one central and one
non-central) with 1 degree of freedom each.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section we analyze the performance of the proposed
(coherent) DBF algorithm based on the previously presented
approximation. To do so we study the outage probability for
different amounts of channel phase signaling (i.e., diverse N),
distinct channel amplitude models (dependent on the physical
location of the cooperative RNs in the system), and for various
numbers of active RNs (i.e., diverse M).
Regarding to the channel amplitude models we note that
in all cases, total transmission power over all relays is 0 dB
and signal gains √γm are assumed to be ﬁxed over the whole
transmission period. In addition, in those cases where RNs are

grouped in two different clusters (with exactly half the number
of active RNs in each one), we use notation

γ(2)
(29)
to represents the power imbalance situation between both
groups. Here, γ(1) and γ(2) represent the individual SNRs of
the active RNs in the ﬁrst cluster (stronger channel gains) and
the second cluster (weaker channel gains), respectively. We
will use the following models for the channel amplitudes:
• Amplitudes are random but ﬁxed samples from i.i.d.
Rayleigh statistics.
• Amplitudes admit perfect power balance (i.e., δ = 0 dB),
• Medium channel power imbalance (i.e., δ = 6 dB), or
• High channel power imbalance (i.e., δ = 10 dB).
When channel amplitudes are (constant) Rayleigh distributed,
it is assumed that individual channel SNRs are i.i.d. exponen-
tial distributed with unitary mean value.
Figure 2 and Fig. 3 show the outage probability for a SNR
threshold when using the proposed DBF scheme for different
amounts of channel phase signaling in case of M = 10
and M
= 20 active RNs, respectively. In this scenario
(constant) Rayleigh distributed channel amplitudes were used
to model the amplitudes. The solid curves are plotted based on
approximation (19) with appropriate ﬁtting parameters, along
with asymptotic upper bounds in case of full CSI at RNs
(dashed line) 3. In all cases, simulated point values (‘∗’) are
also included to verify the validation of the analytical results.
Based on the results it is observed that our approximation
follows simulated values well. As expected, the accuracy of
3Full CSI is actually a synonym of perfect channel phase information
because no channel amplitude information is considered in this work.

the approximation is better when the number of active RNs
in the system is higher. The outage probability in absence of
channel phase signaling is used as a baseline. It is found that
performance in terms of outage probability clearly increases
with additional phase bits in the feedback link. We also note
that if N = 3, then the performance of DBF scheme is very
close to the one observed with full CSI at RNs.

grouped in two clusters (of the same size), that are located at
different distances from the main receiver. Solid curves, dashed
curves, and dotted curves represent perfect channel power
balance (i.e., δ = 0 dB), medium channel power imbalance
(i.e., δ = 6 dB), and high channel power imbalance (i.e.,
δ = 10 dB) situations, respectively. Based on the results
we observe that, the power imbalance level in the channel
amplitude model increases the outage probability of DBF
algorithm for low SNR thresholds. The larger is the number
of phase bits N, the smaller is this impairment. The same
behavior is visible when the number of active RN increases.
This is because of the increasing variability that main receiver
faces in its SNR in both situations, causing a less abrupt
improvement on CDF curve as the value of γ0 grows.
Finally, Fig. 6 presents the the maximum SNR threshold
that can be guaranteed for a given outage probability when
implementing our DBF algorithm in a perfect channel power
balance case (i.e., δ = 0 dB). These curves admit almost linear
behavior with respect to the number of active RNs. Based on
these curves we observe that, as N grows, the gap between
the different outage probability curves decreases. This is in
accordance with the behavior of the expected value of the real
part of the sum channel (i.e., µR), given in equation (25) and
presented in Fig. 7.
In the light of all results we see that there is no reason to
use more than N = 3 bits for phase feedback per RN. Yet,
the performance that is obtained with N = 1 bit is not good
enough. However, the performance obtained with N = 2 bits
represents a reasonable tradeoff between the cost of signaling
overhead, and the beneﬁt of the outage probability performance
improvement that is observed.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper we studied the performance of a dis-
tributed beamforming (DBF) algorithm in presence of dif-
ferent amounts of channel phase feedback information. This
analysis is done in the context of wireless system, where
the subscriber (main transmitter) receives assistance from a
cooperative network to boost its communication to base station
(main receiver). This cooperative network is formed by a
large number of low-cost relay nodes (RNs), deployed in the
premises of the subscriber. Location of the RNs are assumed
to be ﬁxed during the whole duration of the data transmission.
Due to short distances, the communication over the ﬁrst hop
(i.e., from main transmitter to RNs) is assumed to be cheap
in terms of transmission power and radio resource usage.
Therefore, the bottleneck lies in the second hop (i.e., from
RNs to the main receiver).
The outage probability for a given target signal-to-noise
power ratio (SNR) is used as performance measure. To carry
out the analysis, a suitable closed-form approximation for
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of received SNR is
derived. The parameters for this CDF approximation are
obtained from the ﬁrst two raw moments of the resulting
sum channel that main receiver observes. The derived CDF
expression is validated using simulations. Our analysis reveals
that the use of DBF with a small amount of phase feedback
information allows to reap a large fraction of the power gain
that is available in the second hop.
