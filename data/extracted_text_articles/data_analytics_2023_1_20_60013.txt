Abstract— This paper describes the comparison between the 
Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) of the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA) and the predicted number 
of accidents calculated through analytical models, regarding 
Unconventional Roundabouts. The novelty of this comparison 
lies precisely in the fact that the 3 roundabouts analyzed fall 
into the category of so-called Unconventional Roundabouts, 
i.e., arrangements with "roundabout circulation", which do 
not fall within the types listed in the Italian Legislation 
(Ministerial Decree 19-04-2006). In roundabout intersections, 
among the various types of accidents that may occur, those of 
the rear-end collision type occur more frequently, for which it 
was decided to use the formulas of the accident models relating 
to this type of conflict. In particular, the conflicts type 
"Approach" for the Maycock & Hall model and the conflict 
type "Rear end" for the Arndt & Troutbeck model were taken 
into consideration. As mentioned, in addition to the application 
of analytical models, possible points of conflict (of the same 
category, i.e., "Rear end") were evaluated using dynamic 
simulation models. In particular, the dynamic simulation 
software Aimsun™ was used as a means to obtain the 
necessary inputs for the evaluation of the surrogate safety 
carried out through SSAM, a software application that reads 
the trajectory files generated by the simulation programs. In 
the final part of this paper, the conclusions on the comparison 
and some possible future ideas for further research 
developments have been included.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper starts from the idea of the authors to develop 
the work carried out by Vasconcelos et al. in the article 
"Validation of the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model for 
Assessment of Intersection Safety” [1]. In particular, the 
authors have decided to resume the research work carried out 
and extend it with their contribution, starting from their 
conclusion that the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model is a 
quite promising approach to assessing the safety of new 
facilities, innovative layouts and traffic regulation schemes. 
Then, the present work started from the fact that it is difficult 
to calculate the possible number of accidents in roundabouts 
with innovative layouts, because, unlike the conventional 
ones which are "geometrically identifiable", they have highly 
variable geometric parameters and therefore it is difficult to 
able to describe their road safety with a single model. So, 
this research tried to describe the comparison between the 
Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) of the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA) and the predicted number 
of accidents calculated through analytical models, regarding 
Unconventional Roundabouts. The extension of the work of 
Vasconcelos et al. and therefore the novelties lie precisely in 
the fact that the 3 roundabouts analyzed fall precisely into 
the category of so-called Unconventional Roundabouts, i.e., 
arrangements with "roundabout circulation", which do not 
fall within the types listed in the Italian legislation 
(Ministerial Decree 19-04-2006: "Functional and geometric 
rules for the construction of road intersections" [2]). These 
roundabouts have shapes and dimensions that are out of the 
ordinary concept of roundabout intersection. As regards the 
accident models, it was decided to consider the formulas of 
the conflict type "Approach" for the Maycock & Hall [3] 
model and those of the conflict type "Rear end" for the Arndt 
& Troutbeck [4] model. This choice is based on the fact that 
among the various types of accidents that can occur in 
roundabout intersections, rear-end collisions occur more 
frequently (literature the values vary from 20% to 25%). As 
far as the surrogate safety evaluation is concerned, it was 
carried out using SSAM (a software application that reads 
the trajectory files generated by the simulation programs) 
[5]. It was decided to use Aimsun™ as a dynamic 
microsimulation software, with which it was possible to 
obtain the ".trj files", i.e., the trajectory files, essential for 
calculating the possible points of conflict, which, by 
definition, are the points where two vehicles can potentially 
collide with each other at road intersections.

Also, in this case, the points of conflict of the "Rear end" 
category have been taken into consideration. Finally, to 
improve the visualization style of the points of conflict 
extrapolated from SSAM, it was decided to use the software 
Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS); in this 
application, the files extrapolated from SSAM were inserted 
and geolocated. The following sections will follow: a first 
more theoretical section which will deal with the Italian 
Unconventional Roundabouts with some examples that are 
taken into consideration; two sections concerning the SSAM 
approach from FHWA and the existing roundabouts accident 
models; the final section, followed by the conclusions and 
the future research work, which will explain the comparison 
of the two approaches. 
II. 
ITALIAN UNCONVENTIONAL ROUNDABOUTS 
The subsections that follow will primarily deal with the 
theory of the so-called Unconventional Roundabouts, with 
reference to the Italian Legislation; and then move on to 
some practical instances. 
A. Unconventional Roundabouts Theory and Italian 
Legislation 
First of all, it is appropriate to specify what is meant by 
Unconventional Roundabouts [6] and why the authors 
decided to develop their research on them. In the Italian 
legislation (Ministerial Decree 19-04-2006 [2]), there can be 
three basic types of roundabouts based on the diameter of the 
outer circumference: Conventional Roundabouts with an 
outer diameter between 40 and 50 m; Compact Roundabouts 
with outside diameters between 25 and 40 m; Mini 
Roundabouts with external diameter between 14 and 25 m. 
For arrangements with "roundabout circulation", which do 
not fall within the above typologies, we, therefore, speak of 
Unconventional Roundabouts and for them, the geometric 
dimensioning and verification must be adapted. When we 
talk about Unconventional Roundabouts must be considered 
both the so-called "new generation roundabouts" (Raindrop 
Roundabouts; Turbo Roundabouts [7] [8]; Two-Geometry 
Roundabouts [9] [10]), which are currently being built for 
the purpose of fulfilling safety and performance objectives in 
cases where classic roundabouts are unable to work well; 
both the so-called "old roundabouts" which had dimensions 
and geometries suitable for when precedence was on the 
branches instead of on the ring (first generation roundabouts) 
[11]. In Italy, there are many Unconventional Roundabouts 
of both "typologies", both because in terms of space there is 
the need to adopt solutions that are not conventional, and 
because for the moment there are always obsolete 
roundabouts on the national territory which have not been 
adapted and which in fact are often poor in terms of security. 
Precisely for this last consideration, in this discussion the 
authors have decided to take into consideration 3 
Unconventional Roundabouts of the latter type and have 
decided to analyse them in terms of safety, also because from 
this point of view there are no in-depth studies for them. A 
final introductory consideration concerns the type of 
accidents that the authors decided to analyse, i.e., rear-end 
collisions.  
They are the conflicts/accidents that occur on the 
entrance 
branches 
more 
frequently 
at 
"roundabout" 
intersections and for this reason they were chosen as a study 
parameter. 
B. Territorial framework and O/D Matrices of the 3 
identified Roundabouts 
This short paragraph lists the 3 Unconventional 
Roundabouts analyzed by the authors. All 3 roundabouts are 
situated in Italy, in the Tuscany region and are located in 
urban areas, therefore the speed referred to during the 
calculations is equal to 50 km/h [12]. In particular, in Fig. 1, 
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the 3 aerial images extracted from Google 
Earth are reported, where the progressive numbers of the 
branches of the roundabouts are also reported. Reference is 
made to them for the reconstruction of the Origin/Destination 
(O/D) matrices, reported in turn in Table I, Table II and 
Table III.

These matrices were elaborated starting from the data 
surveys carried out on the 3 roundabouts through the use of 
Sony DCR-SX34 digital cameras, positioned at specific 
points of the intersections, during the peak periods of the 
week [13]. 
III. 
SSAM APPROACH FROM FHWA 
This concise section has been included to define what is 
meant by surrogate security assessment and how it is 
possible to carry out such an assessment. Safety analysis is a 
decisive aspect in the evaluation of design choices both for 
the new road system and for the adaptation of the existing 
road network. The Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) has developed and made available the Surrogate 
Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) program, through which 
it aims to offer designers, researchers and companies 
specializing in road design and construction a tool for 
assessing the safety of an intersection by estimating the 
frequency of conflicts [14] [15].  
The concept of surrogate safety derives from the desire to 
develop alternative tools to the existing ones to evaluate the 
accident frequency of road infrastructure: in particular, while 
the ordinary methods derive from statistical evaluations 
based on accidents that have occurred, the surrogate safety 
methods are instead based on factors that do not require 
years of accident statistics. The SSAM program elaborates 
the trajectory files (.trj files) obtained in output from a 
dynamic simulation program (in the case of the present 
research it is decided to use the Aimsun™ program, but in 
general VISSIM™, TEXAS™, etc.). In detail, SSAM 
evaluates every single vehicle-vehicle interaction according 
to criteria with which it can establish whether there is a point 
of conflict and to which category it belongs. At the end of 
the elaborations, SSAM presents the results in tables, 
allowing the user to filter them according to parameters of 
his choice. As regards the classification of conflicts, the 
program contemplates four types: Rear end, Lane changing, 
Crossing and Unclassified. To classify them, the program 
evaluates the crossing angle of the trajectories, if this angle is 
less than 20° the conflict is of the Rear end type. In the 
present research, the latter have been taken into 
consideration, since, as already explained, they are the ones 
that occur most frequently in roundabout intersections. Their 
unit of measurement is expressed in conflicts/day. 
IV. 
EXISTING ROUNDABOUTS ACCIDENT MODELS 
Roundabouts, in general, are considered to be the safest 
road junctions as they have several advantages including 
reduction of points of conflict and lower movement and 
departure speeds. However, accidents can also occur on them 
and in particular, several studies state that the most common 
accident that can occur is a rear-end collision. To study the 
safety characteristics of the elements of the road system, 
there are several models for predicting accidents [16]. The 
authors have decided to use in this research two of the most 
used models, namely those of the Maycock & Hall model 
and the Arndt & Troutbeck model. They were chosen 
because they allow the number of accidents to be calculated 
taking into consideration both the traffic demand, the 
geometric characteristics of the intersection, and the dynamic 
ones (such as speed, for example). With these models, it is 
possible to calculate various types of accidents, but clearly, 
as explained above, it was decided to use the formulas of the 
Conflicts Type "Approach" for the Maycock & Hall [3] 
model (1) and those of the Conflict Types "Rear end" for the 
Arndt & Troutbeck [4] model (2), which indicate precisely 
rear-end collisions. Both models make it possible to estimate 
the number of accidents over a period of time and therefore 
their unit of measurement is expressed in accidents/years 
[17]. The two formulas (1) and (2) used are therefore 
reported below, specifying that the coefficients of these 
formulas are the standard ones calibrated for conventional 
roundabouts. In fact, another of the interesting aspects of this 
research was precisely that of verifying whether these 
coefficients 
could 
also 
work 
for 
Unconventional 
Roundabouts. To answer this question, see the next section.

Furthermore, the authors considered it necessary to also 
report an explanatory image of the surrogate safety 
assessment. In detail, the following image (Fig. 4) shows an 
extract of the QGIS software of one of the roundabouts 
chosen as an example (Roundabout 2), where the points of 
conflict have been inserted, georeferenced (with TTC = 1.5 
s) extracted from the SSAM software after processing the 
".trj file", which in turn was obtained from the Aimsun™ 
simulation software. The Time to Collision (TTC) is one of 
the SSAM software parameters and expresses the minimum 
collision time [18]. It can range from an infinite maximum 
value, when two vehicles never meet, to a minimum value of 
0 seconds when an accident occurs. Various studies have 
been conducted to identify a threshold value of the TTC, 
such as to separate major accidents from minor and 
negligible or without consequences accidents [19]. This 
value, depending on the study, was identified as a fixed value 
or as the result of a function dependent on the speed or 
deceleration of the vehicles. The authors have decided to 
keep the default value of the SSAM program which assumes 
the value TTC = 1.5 s.

reported on QGIS of 2nd Roundabout 
Below are the graphs (Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7) which 
summarize most of the research results. In particular, each 
graph refers to one of the 3 roundabouts and is structured as 
follows: the Qe (entrance vehicular flow) expressed in 
vehicles per day is shown on the abscissa axis; while there 
are two different y axes. The left y-axis is incident models 
(Arndt & Troutbeck / Maycock & Hall) and is expressed in 
accidents per year, while the right is the SSAM results and is 
expressed in conflicts per day.

Figure 7. Graph of Results for the 3rd Unconventional Roundabout 
On the graphs, as many points have been reported as 
there are entrance arms of the roundabout in question and a 
linear trend line passing through the origin (0; 0) has then 
been created for them. After that, the authors decided to 
calculate the coefficient of determination R2 for each trend 
line. It is a statistical value that allows us to understand 
whether a linear regression model can be used to make 
predictions. Its value is always between 0 and 1, or between 
0% and 100% if you want to express it in percentage terms. 
R2 = 0 indicates a model whose predictor variables do not 
explain the variability of y around its mean at all. R2 = 1 
indicates a model whose independent variables fully explain 
the variability of y around its mean; that is, knowing the 
values of the independent variables one can predict exactly 
what the value of y will be. Clearly, the values 0 and 1 are 
limit values, what emerges is that the greater the value of R2, 
the more the model has high predictive power, i.e., the better 
the ability of the explanatory variables to predict the values 
of the dependent variable. Usually, we talk about high R2 
values, when they are higher than 0.7. At this point, after 
having explained the type of graphs used and the reference 
values, it is possible to go into detail on the considerations 
relating to the actual results. For all the graphs, i.e., for all 
the roundabouts, the R2 values are generally excellent (they 
are always higher than 0.9, except for one case), both as 
regards the accident models and as regards the values of the 
conflicts obtained with SSAM. This is an excellent result as 
the 3 roundabouts to which the models have been applied are 
Unconventional Roundabouts, i.e., "different" intersections 
from the ones on which the models have been calibrated. 
Therefore, as a first result, it is certainly possible to state that 
the accident models used (Arndt & Troutbeck / Maycock & 
Hall), which are already valid and validated for conventional 
roundabouts, can also be used for Unconventional 
Roundabouts, using the same formulations and the same 
coefficients. Also, with regard to the SSAM results, the R2 
values are always higher than 0.9 and despite the different 
scales it is possible to state that the trend of the trend lines of 
the points deriving from SSAM is very similar to that 
relating to the accident models. This is therefore another 
excellent result that the authors have arrived at, namely that 
even 
for 
Unconventional 
Roundabouts 
there 
is 
a 
correspondence between the accident models and the 
calculation of the conflicts carried out with SSAM.  
Finally, the authors also noted a further fact regarding 
Fig. 7, i.e., the graph referring to roundabout number 3. The 
trend line of the Arndt & Troutbeck model has an R2 that is 
always acceptable, but clearly lower than all the others 
(0.7789). The explanation that the authors came up with is 
the following: roundabout number 3, in addition to being of 
an unconventional type, is also atypical from the point of 
view of the approaches, since, as can be seen from the 
territorial framework (Fig. 3) and the corresponding O/D 
matrix (Table III), the approach 4 is formed only by the input 
branch and not the output branch. This, together with the 
particular geometry of the roundabout, has led to a high 
difference between the incoming flow rate Qe and the 
circulating flow rate Qc of the adjacent approach 1 (this 
difference is underlined in Table V). So, another result that 
the authors have reached is the consideration that the model 
of Arndt & Troutbeck does not adapt perfectly to 
Unconventional Roundabouts in which there is, for some 
branches, a high difference between the incoming flows and 
circulating flows.

A final comparison was also made for the 3 
Unconventional Roundabouts as a whole. In fact, a last graph 
(Fig. 8), of the same typology as the previous ones, was 
constructed however by taking into consideration the 
roundabouts as a whole and no longer approach by approach. 
In this way, it was possible to compare the 3 roundabouts on 
a single graph and this led to the following consideration.  
 
 
Figure 8. Graph of Results for the three Unconventional Roundabouts 
together 
The values of R2 are excellent and also the roundabout 3 
which had a deficit on the Arndt & Troutbeck model due to 
the difference between the incoming flows and the 
circulating flows at one of the approaches, if it is considered 
as a whole, it is possible to homogenize with the other 
results.

VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH WORK 
This article describes the comparison between the 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Surrogate Safety 
Assessment Model (SSAM) and the predicted number of 
accidents calculated using the Arndt & Troutbeck and 
Maycock & Hall analytical models, as concern the 
Unconventional Roundabouts [20] [21]. 3 Unconventional 
Roundabouts located on the Italian territory that have 
different shapes and sizes from the regulatory standards were 
analysed. Other works and articles have been published 
regarding the comparison between the models mentioned, 
however, the novelty of this research proposed by the authors 
lies precisely in the different base data, i.e., the 
Unconventional Roundabouts. The type of accident and 
conflict chosen for the comparison made is that of rear-end 
collisions, as it is the most common present on roundabout 
intersections. In the sections of the article, various initial 
considerations follow one another which deepen the concepts 
of Unconventional Roundabouts, surrogate safety analysis 
models (SSAM) and accident models; up to section V where 
the results of the entire research were clearly explained. 
Summarizing these results, the authors found that: 1) the 
accident models used (Arndt & Troutbeck / Maycock & 
Hall) already valid and validated for conventional 
roundabouts, can also be used for Unconventional 
Roundabouts, using the same formulations and the same 
coefficients also because a certain correspondence was also 
found between them in terms of the number of accidents per 
year; 2) also for Unconventional Roundabouts there is a 
correspondence between the accident models and the 
calculation of the conflicts carried out with SSAM; 3) Arndt 
& Troutbeck model is not perfectly suited to Unconventional 
Roundabouts in which there is, for one or more branches, too 
high a difference between incoming flows and circulating 
flows. Before concluding the work, the authors decided to 
also propose some ideas of the possible future development 
of this research. First of all, this work can certainly be 
expanded by analysing further case studies and thus 
obtaining more points to use on the graphs obtained. 
Furthermore, the accident models utilised were used in the 
first 
analysis 
without 
the 
recalibration 
for 
the 
Unconventional Roundabouts; therefore another next steps 
could be proper to go and search for the actual accident data 
and thus verify whether the parameters used can be further 
improved and better recalibrated for Unconventional 
Roundabouts (it is emphasized that however, as explained in 
section V, the accident models used, can already be used also 
for Unconventional Roundabouts, given the statistical results 
obtained by the authors).
