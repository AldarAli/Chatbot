Abstract— Water regeneration is a top priority to achieve 
sustainability. 
Different 
alternatives 
to 
the 
traditional 
wastewater treatments that combine nitrification-anammox-
denitrification are becoming popular in the last few years. 
These systems combine bacteria and plants to remove the 
organic matter and generate harvestable biomass. Despite the 
importance of oxygen concentration for the degradation of 
organic matter, no studies analyse the variation of dissolved 
oxygen in those systems. In this paper, we are going to evaluate 
the temporal and spatial variability of dissolved oxygen in the 
ponds of a phytodepuration system composed of Typha 
domingensis to identify if the bottom of the ponds is in 
anaerobic/anoxic conditions or not. Thus, the concentration of 
dissolved oxygen in 6 points and at 4 depth are measured 
during 2 months. Our results indicate that there is a high 
temporal variability of dissolved oxygen, caused mainly by the 
entrance of water into the system. The variability was much 
lower in the bottom of the third (and last) tank. The spatial 
distribution of the oxygen in normal conditions follows a 
gradient, having the highest concentration (0.5 mg/L) on the 
surface of the first pond and the lower concentration at the 
bottom of the second and third ponds (≈0.1 mg/L). Finally, we 
relate the system's performance with the produced biomass, 
1.8 kg/m2, and the reduction of total dissolved solids, 80%.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The wastewater treatment is an urgent need to 
accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals and have 
clean waters. The regenerated waters can be a valuable 
resource for agriculture since they can be used to irrigate 
crops. In recent years, the use of regenerated water has 
increased, and the apparition of alternative systems, such as 
the phytodepuration, are becoming popular [1]. The 
phytodepuration consists of the combined use of bacteria and 
plants to regenerate the water in ponds.  
The operation principle of phytodepuration is that 
different bacteria in the water under anaerobic and aerobiotic 
conditions are capable of transforming the organic matter 
into nutrients through the combination of nitrification-
anammox-denitrification processes [2]. This process is 
facilitated thanks to the introduction of small amounts of 
oxygen in the water by the plants through their roots. On the 
other hand, the plants consume the excess of nutrients in the 
water. Thus, the water quality is improved as the plant grows 
by absorbing these nutrients. The excess of nutrients and 
organic matter might cause environmental damages in rivers 
and lakes, known as eutrophication. Moreover, the 
phytodepuration systems do not produce any sewage sludge.  
Recently, a research project to evaluate the use of small-
scale phytodepuration to regenerate the wastewater of a 
small region is started. A phytodepuration system based on 
three ponds was set up. In this paper, we want to evaluate the 
variability of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration along 
the ponds. First of all, we want to assess the generated 
vertical gradient of DO from the surface to the bottom. The 
plants inject oxygen into the water in the radicular area and 
while the bacteria are consuming this DO. On the other hand, 
and considering that the system will not work as a stationary 
system with a fixed and determined flow, we have to 
evaluate if this operation principle is functional. The system 
is injecting wastewater into the phytodepuration according to 
the water level of the reception tank.  
This phytodepuration system aims to combine the 
regeneration of wastewater with the cropping of vegetals 
which can be later used for different purposes. This method 
is very convenient for rural areas with small villages and 
agroindustry, which produce wastewater with very high 
organic matter levels. Furthermore, the phytodepuration 
might involve a new source of income by harvesting the 
cropped plants for the rural population. Specifically, in our 
system, we have southern cattails as a crop. It has several 
applications, mainly as livestock feed [3]. Even so, recent 
research has proved their use for bioenergy production [4].  
Although several authors pointed out the relevance of 
DO in converting organic matter into nutrients, no one paper 
shows the evaluation of its variability (temporal nor spatial) 
and its range in those systems. The inclusion of sensing 
technologies, or at least periodic monitorisation with probes, 
must be considered to evaluate the system's performance. 
Despite the importance of monitorisation in agriculture, 
where we find several monitoring systems [5], the 
monitorisation of phytodepuration is still in an early 
development stage.  
In this paper, we analyse the variability of DO in our 
system. We will evaluate its temporal and spatial variability 
for 6 measuring points (at the entrance and exit of each 
pond) and 4 different depth per point (from the surface to the 
bottom). We will compare the stability of conditions in each 
pond for two months to define if they are reaching nearly 
anoxic conditions, which are required in the bottom of the

ponds. A commercial optical probe was used to measure the 
DO. Data was gathered, as average, once per week. Thus, we 
will present the harvested biomass, which is growing over 
the water and injecting oxygen at the end of the study, in kg 
and kg/m2. Furthermore, the rate of total dissolved solids 
removal is given. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows; Section 2 
outlines the related work. Section 3 describes the materials 
and methods. The obtained results are analysed in Section 4, 
highlighting the implications of DO on the system's 
performance. Finally, Section 5 summarises the conclusions 
and future work.  
II. 
RELATED WORK 
In this section, we are going to summarise the studied 
DO characteristics in phytodepuration and similar processes.  
In [6], Borges et al. studied the variability of several 
parameters on constructed wetland system to treat water 
from the Corumbataí River. Their system consists of 4 
reactors on continuous water flow. The water input is the 
river which is considered reactor 1. In reactor 2, they have 
macrophytes (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms), covering 
80% of the water surface. Water was sampled at the end of 
each reactor. In their case, the initial DO level of water at the 
entrance of reactor 2 was 9 mg/L, and the DO after reactor 2 
8.9 mg/L. Thus, they do not found any extra relevant 
oxygenation by the macrophytes (the water was fully 
oxygenated from the beginning). Their data indicates a 
reduction of total suspended solids of 54.5%. The authors 
also found an increase in the chemical demand of oxygen 
(CDO) of 26.7% after reactor 2.  
Caselles-Osorio et al. [7] evaluated the modification of 
studied 
parameters 
on 
a 
horizontal 
subsurface-flow 
constructed wetland using Cyperus articulatus L. Authors 
pumped the wastewater from a septic tank to a set of 4 tanks, 
2 of them with plants and the other 2 vertical perforated 
pipes. Their study had a duration of 3 months with a total of 
43 measurements. The water exit from the septic tank with a 
DO concentration of 0.17 mg/L. The DO in the tanks with 
the plants reaches 2.1 (±1.2) mg/L. On the other hand, the 
tanks with the perforated pipes only went to 1.7(±1.2) mg/L. 
After finishing the experiment, the harvested biomass was 5 
kg/m2 in the tanks with plants.  
García-Perez et al. in [8] evaluate the temporal variability 
of DO in a recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland. In 
their system, they pump the water from a septic tank. Their 
pond has 6 x 6 x 1.2 m. Gravel was added to cover 50% of 
the volume of the wetland. Thus, 25% of the wetland were 
uncovered. As plants for consuming the nutrients, the 
authors used maize. The authors measured the DO in 6 
periods over the 220 days of the experiment. The water input 
had an average DO of 1.2 mg/L. Their results indicate that 
the wetland was in aerobic conditions with average values of 
5.3 mg/L (maximum and minimum values of 7.1 and 34 
mg/L). Nonetheless, the authors do not specify precisely 
where are the water samples were taken (surface or bottom).  
A final example can be found in which Palta-Prado and 
Morales-Velasco used different Poaceae for domestic 
wastewater phytodepuration [9]. The authors pumped the 
wastewater from a reduced region into 4 treatments. The 
wastewater had an average DO of 5.67 mg/L. The different 
treatments consist of diverse plant species. Their results 
indicate that none of the treatments increased the DO values 
in water. Average DO values for each treatment were 5.5 to 
5.16 mg/L. Thus, CDO was nearly halved in all the cases. 
As far as we know, no one paper has analysed the 
distribution of DO in the phytodepuration system and their 
trend along with the system or depth. Furthermore, it has not 
been studied for constructed wetlands or natural wetlands 
used for remediation regardless of their soil/bottom 
characteristics. Thus, it is necessary to have a preliminary 
approximation before performing an exhaustive analysis or 
studying its variation when the flow is modified or before 
adding a more complex (polluted) water input. 
III. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In this section, we are going to detail the characteristics 
of the phytodepuration system and the measuring process.  
A. Description of the phytodepuration system. 
The system has been built in "IMIDRA - El Encin" 
facilities at Alcalá de Henares (Spain). The phytodepuration 
system consists of an initial tank of 40 m3. This tank has a 
coarse grating grid, acting as a primary decanter. The first 
tank receives the wastewater from the "El Encín" facilities, 
and it is estimated that 20% of the CDO is removed. Then, 
water reaches the rectangular ponds, which contain the 
floating plants. The phytodepuration system comprises three 
pools of 9.6 x 3.6 x 0.8 m each (27.6 m3 per pool), with a 
volume of 83 m3 (Figure 1). Based on previous experiences, 
a depth of the water layer of 80 cm has been established, 
considering a maximum root length of 50 cm. Thus, a lower 
zone of 25-30 cm remains for the decomposition of the 
sludge in which anoxic conditions are required. 
B. Description of the phytodepuration system. 
The concrete structure, consisting of three ponds, was 
finished in the middle of January of 2020, see Figure 2 (a). 
The selected plant was Typha domingensis Pers. An 
autochthonous plant is well adapted to eutrophic conditions 
and used widely for wastewater treatment [10][11]. The T. 
domingensis was located over floating plates. The floating 
plates have the function of keeping the plants on the water 
surface but also preventing the entrance of DO from the 
atmosphere to the water. Thus, it facilitates the generation of 
the required anoxic conditions for the bacteria in the bottom.

The placement of floating plates and plants began on 
25/06/2020 (16 plants/m2). The T. domingensis came from 
the "Viveros Forestales La Dehesa SL", a specialised aquatic 
plant nursery for phytodepuration. The plants come from an 
alveolus tray, with a height of 15 cm in the aerial part and 
roots of 10 cm in length. They were kept in the shade under 
irrigation for seven days before their installation. Once the 
plant reached 1.67 m height and 35 cm root (02/09/2020), 
the study period starts. The studied period finished on 
11/11/2020 when autumn tones began to appear, and the 
plants were harvested. Pictures of the different moments are 
shown in Figure 2. The dates of the photographs are Figure 2 
(a) 18/05/2020, Figure 2 (b) 09/07/2020, and Figure 2 (c) 
02/09/2020. 
C. Measurement of DO in the ponds 
Measurements of DO had been taken at two points per 
pond, one at the entrance and one at the exit of each pond. 
Thus, we have a total of 6 measurement points. In each point, 
DO was measured at four depth (6, 25, 50 and 75 cm). The 
measurements started on the water surface and finished at the 
bottom.  
DO was measured with a probe HI98198 optical meter 
(HANNA [12]). The probe was calibrated with a 0 mg/L 
oxygen solution prior to data collection. For each measure, 
we wait until the value of DO is stabilised. A picture of the 
data gathering process and the probe is in Figure 2 (d). 
IV. 
RESULTS 
In this section, we analyse the variability of measured 
DO in the ponds. First of all, a general overview of the 
gathered data focusing on the temporal variations between 
points is shown. Then, the spatial variability along with the 
depth and the ponds is analysed. Following, we statistically 
analyze the data. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our 
study and the implication of the gathered data. 
A. General overview of DO and its temporal distribution 
The first step in order to analyse the variability of the DO 
is to have a general overview of the obtained values along 
the studied period. We can see the mean value of DO for 
each pond and each depth in Figure 3 (a) to (d). The different 
letters represent different depth from 6 cm to 75 cm, 
respectively. We can see that in general terms, the DO values 
are low. They never exceed the 2.6 mg/L. Although in some 
days, the DO increases, the detected increments are smaller 
for more profound points of the pond.  
Concerning the temporal variability, we can identify 
mainly two peaks in the DO concentration. The first peak is 
found in the second measured day (7 days after starting the 
measurements). This peak increases the DO at all depth, but 
it only has an adverse effect (DO higher than 1mg/L) on the 
first pond. The second and third ponds have DO 
concentrations lower than 1 mg/L at all the depth. In fact, the 
DO values of the third pond are almost the same as in the 
previous measures. Meanwhile, in the second pond, we only 
found differences in the most superficial point. The second 
DO peak is found in two consecutive days, 41 and 49 days 
after starting the study. On day 43, the maximum DO 
concentration was found in the second pond with an average 
concentration of 1.44 mg/L at the most shallow depth. 
Meanwhile, the day 49, the DO concentration reached 
2.47mg/L. On day 43, the second pond was the one with the 
higher concentration at all depth. Nonetheless, for day 49, 
the third pond had a higher concentration than the other at 50 
and 75 cm depth. This trend might be explained by an 
accidental introduction of oxygen in the system at some 
moment before day 43.  
B. Spatial distribution of DO in the ponds and their depth 
After outlying the temporal distribution of DO 
concentration, we are going to focus on spatial variability. In 
Figure 4 (a) to (d), we represent the spatial distribution of the 
four measured points, entrance and exit of the first pond, and 
exit of the second and third pond, in the horizontal axis, and 
the four depth in the vertical axis. Figure 4 (a) to (c) displays 
the aspects of the ponds at different days, being Figure 4 (a), 
(b), and (d) the representation of normal distribution and 
Figure 4 (c) the spatial distribution in non-regular conditions. 
The different colours indicate the DO concentration (higher 
in blue tones and lower in green tones). 
Focusing on the system's data in regular conditions, we 
can see how the DO decrease from the surface to the bottom 
of the pond and along with the ponds (from measured point 1 
to 4). Comparing both days, the DO levels are higher in (a) 
than in (b) since that day there was a peak in the OD. 
Nonetheless, the spatial distribution is expected in the 
system. Figure 3 (c) shows that the aforementioned trend is 
not followed in unstable conditions.

In (c), we can identify a point with having a higher DO 
concentration than the previously measured point. This point 
is the measurement at the exit of the first pond. As detailed 
before, a possible explanation is that an accidental 
introduction of oxygen happened in the system, caused by 
diverse conditions of water input or an increased flow.  
Concerning the area with low DO (nearly anoxic or 
anoxic-dark green colour), we see that in regular conditions, 
we can see that in Figure 4 (a) and (c), most of the ponds 
present DO concentrations of up to 0.75 mg/L. Thus, only 
some points of pond 3 present the optimal conditions for the 
operation of the bacteria.  
On the other hand, focusing on Figure 4 (b) and (d), the 
whole volume of the ponds has a concentration of DO lower 
than 0.75 mg/L. Thus, up to 50% of the ponds are in a nearly 
anoxic condition in Figure 4 (d) and up to ¾ in Figure 4 (b).  
C. Temporal variability in each measured point 
Following, we are going to focus on the temporal 
variability in each one of the measured points. In this case, 
we are going to represent all the measured points, including 
the beginning and end of each pond (6 measured points).  
The average value of DO for each sampling point and 
each depth can be seen in Figure 4, represented in vertical 
coloured bars. Meanwhile, the black error bars indicate the 
standard deviation of gathered data. In general terms, we can 
see that the average values follow the trend of decreasing DO 
along with the measured points and the depth. Nevertheless, 
there is a point that does not follow this trend. Measured 
point 3 has a higher DO concentration than measured point 
2. The peak causes this detected on 15/10/2020; this data can 
be considered as an outlier value. The average values at the 
bottom are almost identical for the two measured points of 
the third point (point 5 and 6).  
With regards to the standard deviation, we can see that 
the higher variation is found for measured points 3 and 4 
(depth of 6 and 25 cm). Again, this is caused by the peak of 
DO on 15/10/2020. For measured points 1 and 2, the 
standard deviation values are between 0.41 and 0.34 
(relatively stable along the pond and the depth). Concerning 
pond 3 (measured points 5 and 6), the standard deviation is 
much lower in the bottom (0.25 and 0.16 mg/L) than in the 
surface (0.71 and 0.48 mg/L). Thus, we can affirm that we 
can find more stable conditions in the third point and less 
DO than in the previous ponds. This is explained by the 
characteristics of pumped water in the ponds. The pumped 
water might suppose an input of oxygen in the system. 
Moreover, the included oxygen is consumed by the bacterial 
during the denitrification process.  
D. Limitations of the study and evaluation of 
phytodepuration performance 
In this section, we are going to analyse the limitations of 
the presented research and the implications of the DO 
concentration on the performance of the phytodepuration.  
First of all, the main limitation of our study is the limited 
number of measurements. Therefore, it will be more accurate 
to have an in-situ sensor with continuous measurements. 
Nonetheless, considering the scope of phytodepuration, it is 
not feasible to bear the costs of the acquisition of this 
monitoring technology. Therefore, punctual samples are 
required to evaluate the operation of the whole system. 
In addition, there is a limitation in our study considering 
the input of water. In our case, the pumped water into the 
system comes from a small area, including the work centre 
of a research area and a small amount of agroindustry 
wastewater. Nonetheless, no control has been done regarding 
the water flow. Thus, we cannot know the flow in our system 
since it varies over the days, and we cannot estimate a fixed 
retention time. Moreover, we have performed the study 
during a rainy period in which abrupt changes in water flow 
are expected. Finally, we do not know the water conditions 
in the water reception tank.  
Finally, we will evaluate the effect of DO concentrations 
on the performance of the process. Considering that the 
majority of the denitrification happened in the bottom of the 
ponds, we are going the classify if the denitrification process 
is optimal (nearly anoxic conditions 0 to 0.5 mg/L), good 
(0.5 to 1 mg/L) or not good (>1 mg/L), see Figure 6. For the 
first measured point, the entrance of pond 1, in 70% of the 
measures, the conditions are nearly anoxic; only in 1 case, 
we find a condition characterised as not good for the 
bacteria. Similar results are found for the ending of the first 
pond. Focusing on the second pond, only 10% of the time 
operates in non-optimal conditions. Lastly, the third pond is 
always 
optimal 
(90%) 
or

(10%) 
conditions.

Although the system has been operating without any 
restriction or condition in the water flow, we can confirm its 
proper operation based on water quality values and the DO 
values. In all the analysed period, both the input and the 
output of the phytodepuration were periodically measured. 
The data of total suspended solids confirms that there is a 
reduction of 80% as average. However, CDO values are 
relatively low (at the entrance and exit), and the effect of 
phytodepuration on the reduction or increase of CDO is not 
yet apparent. Although in some cases CDO decreased, in 
other cases, it increases. Thus, more research is needed. 
Concerning the system's productivity, a total of 187.88 kg of 
typha biomass was harvested on 11/11/2020. It supposes 
average productivity of 1.8 kg/m2.  
According to our data, the Typha domingensis injects a 
minimal amount of oxygen in the water and has nearly no 
impact on the measured DO. In similar papers [7], authors 
have shown how other species have much higher oxygen 
transference rates. Although the low DO concentration, the 
combined nitrification-anammox-denitrification process is 
operating well, and the crops have grown.   
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, the temporal variability of DO in 
phytodepuration ponds is analysed. In phytodepuration, we 
need a stable and low DO in the bottom to allow 
denitrification, which converts the organic matter into 
valuable nutrients for the plants above the water. Thus, the 
optimal operation of bacteria ensures the cleaning of the 
water and the growth of the crops.  
Our results indicate that the DO is low in the three ponds 
in general terms, mainly due to the water input and a 
decreasing DO concentration along with the ponds. The DO 
also follows a negative gradient along with the depth of the 
pond. Thus, we have confirmed that our design of a small-
scale phytodepuration system with no control on the flow 
accomplishes DO's expected values and variability.  
As future work, we want to evaluate the denitrification 
process in each pond. We will include low-cost water quality 
sensors measuring the turbidity and the organic matter 
developed in [13]. On the other hand, we will study the crop 
performance in each pond to evaluate if the different 
amounts of nutrients in the ponds affect crop performance.
