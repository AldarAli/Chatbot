Abstract— The Internet of Things (IoT) involves the 
interconnection of devices and humans to the Internet. IoT is 
rapidly being adopted in different sectors of life, including the 
health sector. Numerous sensing devices are used to gather 
patients’ information, generating a large volume of data. The 
traditional applications and algorithms are not efficient in 
processing and managing the patients’ data, which presents a 
challenge. Much research on the Internet of Things in 
healthcare focuses mainly on hospitals with little focus on care 
homes. This research uses care homes as a case study as these 
are regarded as the homes of service users for an extended 
period of time, much longer than the time they spend in 
hospitals. This research proposes a system that would enable 
healthcare staff to monitor the pressure sores in service users 
with low mobility and provide them with a secured system 
against attacks from cyber criminals. The system implements 
the use of sensors to monitor pressure exerted from bedridden 
service users in real-time using ThingSpeak, provides a secure 
system by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for 
caregivers for safe login, transmitting data securely over a safe 
network using raspberry pi 4 as the edge devices, and applying 
machine learning to help monitor the network for intrusion 
detection from hackers. With the current gap in research in 
care homes, this paper emphasises the need for the adoption of 
real-time monitoring and having a secured system framework 
for care homes to improve their services provided.

 INTRODUCTION 
A. Importance of  IoT  In Healthcare 
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that is believed 
to be the future of the Internet. It is the interconnectivity of 
devices with humans, thereby linking the virtual world with 
the physical world and is seen as a massive network of 
things: people-to-people, people-to-devices, devices-to-
devices [1]. Communication in IoT thrives from the constant 
advancements in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio 
Frequency Identification (RFID), Mobile Communication, 
Cloud technology, among a few others. IoT has hugely 
helped advance people's standard of living and made life 
easier as devices and the different sectors of life are adopting 
smart technology. With the rapid adoption in the utilization 
of IoT applications, CompTIA predicted that roughly 50.1 
billion devices would be connected to the Internet by 2020 
[2] of which the number of devices connected to the internet 
has increased. The Internet of Things has in recent years 
become the key focus of research as millions of devices are 
becoming intelligent and being used in different fields such 
as healthcare, business, security, schools, asset tracking, 
agriculture, automobiles, smart cities, smart homes, smart 
metering [3]. 
The architecture of an IoT system is made up of a 
variety of layers built with sensors and actuators embedded 
as part of their structure. While the sensors gather 
information from its surroundings and process this data to 
produce useful information, actuators, on the other hand, 
adjust or modify the condition of their environment based 
on the information received from the sensors. Some 
examples include transceivers, thermometers, thermostats, 
cloud administrations, etc. With the accelerating growth and 
rapid adoption and use of these smart devices, the security 
of the sensitive data being shared, the applications and 
platforms on which they are used becomes top priority to 
avoid data being compromised. From a functionality and 
implementation point of view, the IoT systems architecture 
should be built with a very high and secure level of 
cryptographic abilities to ensure data authentication, 
integrity, confidentiality, and validation. Systems having 
these security features would be protected against all forms 
of attacks from hackers and cybercriminals that target 
vulnerable systems with low security.  
The constant expansion and growth of the Internet of 
Things has led to the emergence of Edge Computing. Quite a 
high number of IoT edge devices that are used very often 
have high vulnerabilities, and users of these devices are 
advised to use the inbuilt security features in each device to 
avoid cyber-attacks [4]. This paper presents an overview of 
the IoT systems architecture, IoT enabling technology, and 
its security at the edge. We focus on the application of IoT in 
healthcare by monitoring pressure sores in patients with low 
mobility. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
discusses the literature review of IoT security in healthcare. 
Section III is the methodology. Section IV addresses the 
experimental setup. Section V presents the conclusion and 
future work.

B. Monitoring Pressure Sores 
Pressure sores, also called bedsores, are known as 
injuries to the skin and the underlying tissues due to 
continuous pressure being applied on the skin for a 
prolonged period, which results in a shortage of blood flow. 
This pressure occurs most of the time around parts of the 
body that are quite bony and prone and faced with 
continuous friction, immobilization, and malnourishment 
[5]. Pressure sores have long posed a massive burden in 
healthcare [6]. People at risk of developing pressure sores 
are mostly the elderly, disabled patients in wheelchairs, and 
bedridden patients in hospitals and care homes. In care 
homes, high profile beds are used especially for patients that 
are prone to bedsores. Pressure relief cushions are used in 
chairs and wheelchairs as well to help relieve pressure when 
sitting. 
While in bed, hourly repositioning is done for 
patients to relieve pressure on the sides laid. It is also done 
when patients sit in their recliners and wheelchairs; these 
actions are known as pressure relief mechanisms. Patients 
are assisted to stand up for a few minutes and if they can, 
take a short walk to help relieve the pressure that has built 
up while they were seated for a while. Barrier creams are 
also regularly applied to the pressure points to protect the 
skin and act as a barrier. Moody et. al. [7] proposed a 
platform that shows the pressure distribution map of the 
body, collects information from sensors embedded in the 
patient's bed, has the data analysed to create a timestamp, 
and has the actuators readjust its surface profile to make 
sure pressure is distributed all over the body. 
Different solutions have been proposed to reduce 
bedsores, like smart beds, sensors, and artificial intelligence 
to monitor the whole body lying in bed or sitting in a chair. 
Nair et al. [8] proposed a smart air mattress that can inflate 
and deflate, thereby relieving the body pressure. Benet et al. 
[9] also proposed an algorithm that automatically detects 
parts of the body that have been relieved by pressure points 
from under a supine subject without assumptions or input by 
users. 
II. 
RELATED  WORK 
Much research is being carried out in the use of IoT and 
its security in the healthcare sector with the main focus on 
hospitals, and not necessarily in care homes, and this is what 
this research focuses on. In care homes recently, IoT is 
being deployed like using sensor mats to detect falls, 
wearable devices to monitor the patients' vitals, temperature 
sensors, humidity sensors, and a few others. Many care 
homes still implement the traditional method of storing 
patients’ data and monitoring sensors via their care plans 
and daily logbooks. Real-time monitoring of patients’ vitals 
and information in care homes is not common. It is mostly 
their personal records and information that can be accessed 
online, and it is mostly managers, nurses and senior carers 
who have access to these. Most existing research focuses on 
highlighting the trends and current challenges, and 
proposing more solutions which IoT can offer the health 
sector in general as carried out by [10], but there has been 
little research on implementing a more secured IoT system. 
Most 
care 
homes 
do 
not 
implement 
two-factor 
authentication (2FA) to ensure a more secure system, and it 
is just staff login details that grant them access to the 
system. This is not very safe and can be very detrimental 
should a third party hack the system and steal or alter 
patient’s information; that is what this research is focusing 
on, providing a 2FA system for more security and providing 
a more secure system while transmitting these patients’ data 
using edge devices. [11] presented the main problems facing 
narrowband IoT (NBIoT) currently and presented some 
solutions to help tackle these challenges. [12] addressed the 
important areas of IoT technologies for smart sensors, big 
data analytics and advanced health care systems. They used 
various case studies to identify possible perspectives by 
highlighting ongoing research issues like interoperability, 
scalability, security, and device-network-human interfaces. 
[13] focused on the applications and networks of IoT 
devices in healthcare, attacks on these devices, the security 
requirements for the IoT systems, and the organizational 
approach towards the development and implementation of 
IoT security. [14] investigated the current IoT security and 
privacy requirements and provided a new framework that 
sorts out all aspects of these security and privacy measures, 
requirements, and recommendations in healthcare. [15] shed 
light on the importance of IoT-based elderly healthcare 
systems and their classification by reviewing different 
research studies focused on developing and utilising these 
systems. This research also addressed the security and 
architecture of IoT systems in healthcare and how they are 
implemented in the home and hospital. [16] designed a 
system for smart homes to assist care for people with special 
needs for a prolonged period. The system tracks and 
analyses how residents behave at different time intervals 
and provide caregivers with reports and alerts. [17] 
proposed a novel healthcare IoT system model that provides 
information on the current health status of patients. Using a 
Raspberry Pi 3, patients can get an immediate response 
about hospitals close to them and if the physicians are 
available to see them. [18] proposed a multi-agent approach 
to advanced continuous threat detection using machine 
learning for predictive analysis in identifying security 
vulnerabilities and patterns to make predictions and 
recognize outliers. 
A. IoT Systems 
The IoT systems involve simple, smart devices ranging 
from wearables to more complex systems such as the 
recently developed self-driving cars. These devices aim to 
bring more comfort to the lives of people. IoT systems have 
improved the quality of life of people greatly. It has made 
room for everything around us to be automated. Every sector 
of life uses IoT to improve the services they provide [19]. A 
combination of all these smart systems gave rise to smart

healthcare, smart transportation, smart homes, and smart 
industries. 
B. Security Issues in Internet of Things (IoT) 
With the security of the IoT being a top priority, many 
researchers propose different solutions using different 
technologies to help reduce cyberattacks [20]. Many 
research projects have been carried out to address the 
modelling of the system, its design, setup and the IoT 
enabling technologies that allow for the proper functioning 
of the system and, most importantly, its security. The 
continuous integration of IoT and its applications has drawn 
attention to several security issues which should be 
addressed. The more devices become a part of the Internet 
framework, the more global exposures would give rise to 
more security vulnerabilities giving room for attackers and 
cybercriminals to exploit these security flaws. Hewlett 
Packard, in a survey, stated that a high percentage of IoT 
devices that are often used are vulnerable and defenceless to 
attacks [21]. IoT devices can be exposed to these security 
risks due to inadequacies in their systems design, which 
may lack security features such as authentication and 
authorization and have deficient communication media. 
Some of the main security issues in IoT include Botnet, 
Malware attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and Denial of 
Service attacks [22]. Hackers can attack IoT devices due to 
the default software configuration, inconsistent software 
updates and the extended distance between the patch release 
and its installation [23]. Security in IoT is crucial and needs 
to constantly be maintained to protect the billions of devices 
connected to the Internet. 
      The design of the IoT system should involve the 
following security features: 
· Confidentiality 
· Integrity 
· Authenticity 
· Authorization 
· Availability 
C. Edge Devices in Healthcare 
IoT in healthcare consists of edge devices used to sense 
and process data. These edge devices connect a very high 
number of sensing devices that are smart [24]. They come 
between the source of information and the cloud [25]. Edge 
devices provide healthcare with smart systems that allow for 
speedy health diagnosis and help in providing precise, 
effective treatments. IoT sensors and its healthcare 
applications have greatly changed and improved the 
healthcare approach, with the number of IoT healthcare 
devices estimated to be more than 162 billion in the year 
2020 [26]. The structure of Edge-based IoT healthcare has 
aided remote monitoring with the help of smart sensors for 
patients. Data obtained from sensors are sent over to the 
edge devices for prepossessing before they can be trained 
using machine learning to also help in monitoring illnesses 
in real-time and treat these diseases. Solutions for remote 
monitoring of patients in real-time and the secured 
transmission of their health reports have for many years 
been the main area of research for health researchers [27]. 
[28] suggested the use of computers and microcontroller-
based monitoring systems like the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
and heartbeat sensors to monitor the heartbeat and notify 
high heart rate. Because of their limited resources, Edge 
devices are quite vulnerable to different types of threats that 
could affect their performance. Hence, the cryptographic 
algorithms should be deployed to increase security. 
D. Embedded Devices and Edge devices in IoT 
Edge Computing means data being processed at the edge 
of a network as close to the source of data as possible. It is 
the expansion of the Internet of Things that led to Edge 
Computing. Commonly, edge devices are regarded as 
microcontroller-based systems [29]. As data is being 
collected from various IoT Edge devices, it is first pre-
processed before it is sent to the cloud. Unlike the 
centralized cloud computing, edge computing is a distributed 
architecture even though it is based on cloud technologies. 
With traditional cloud computing being centralized and 
having all its computation and storage done in a single data 
centre, it faces some limitations with the continuous 
emergence of new technology that needs low latency, real-
time response and decision making. This is where edge 
computing comes into play as it is used to improve cloud 
computing [30]. Data generating devices are considered edge 
devices. Edge devices in the IoT context are mostly 
microcontroller-based systems that are resource-constrained 
and are short of memory and computing power, and they 
could also be remotely located, meaning they need to 
optimize their power consumption as they rely on small 
batteries. Some embedded devices in IoT include Raspberry 
pi, Jetson Nvidia, etc. 
Edge devices directly interact with the physical 
environment by using RFID tags, sensors, actuators, and 
embedded devices. The edge layer, which is a critical 
component of IoT application, is a major target to attackers 
as they try to gain access to the whole system in the bid to 
take it down. Figure 1 below shows the architecture of edge 
devices. 
 
 
Figure 1. Edge Architecture 
E. Security at the Edge in Healthcare 
Statistics published a few years back showed that one 
sector that faced the highest level of threat was the health 
sector [31]. Security and privacy are major concerns to the 
security of patient’s data. The slightest form of attacks on 
both patients' personal data, tampering with their medication

file, can be catastrophic to the patient and life-threatening 
[32]. Because of these security concerns, ongoing research 
on data security concentrates mainly on developing and 
implementing encryption, authentication, and solutions for 
wearable and implantable devices [33]-[35]. [36] evaluated a 
case study for patient biosignal data and designed a structure 
that uses edge devices to process the data sent to the cloud 
and enhance the processing and response time while 
maintaining a very high-level accuracy and data privacy. 
F. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools For IoT Security in 
Health Care 
Artificial Intelligence is a combination of different 
technologies. AI in healthcare deploys different software 
and algorithms to emulate human intelligence to process 
complex medical data and carry out analysis, tasks, 
reasoning, detecting patterns and solve problems with no 
direct human input [37]. AI has brought a massive change in 
diagnosing diseases, patient care and medical analysis [38]. 
Since its adoption in healthcare, AI has proven to be the 
most efficient technology used to process big data and 
enabling results analysis in real-time [39]. Some of the AI 
tools for security in healthcare are Machine Learning, Deep 
Learning, 
Big 
Data, 
Cloud 
Technology 
[40] 
and 
Blockchain. Based on research conducted, many papers use 
deep neural networks to tackle privacy and security in 
healthcare systems [41].

Machine Learning is an aspect of artificial 
intelligence that uses intelligent software to enable 
machines to work effectively. Training models in 
machine 
learning 
are 
Supervised 
and 
Unsupervised. Some of the ML algorithms are 
Decision Trees, support vector machine (SVM), K-
Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logistic Regression 
(LR), Naives Bayes, Discriminant Analysis. 
Popular software used for ML is MATLAB. 
- 
Deep Learning can be defined as learning by 
example using neural network architecture. It is a 
specialized ML technology where computer 
models are trained to classify data given such as 
images, sounds and texts and, with a result, achieve 
a high level of accuracy. 
- 
Big Data is a huge amount of data gathered from 
billions of IoT devices. Analysts expend these 
gathered data, and valuable information retrieved 
and conveyed to organizations. This valuable 
dataset can affect an organisation's decision-
making strategies, hence the need to employ 
advanced technology to help manage the high 
volume of data. 
- 
Cloud Technology can be used to store data that is 
easily accessed over the Internet or network. Cloud 
Computing works with smart devices such as 
sensors and allows this sensing data to be saved 
and used for intelligent monitoring and actuation. 
- 
Blockchain technology allows the storage and 
exchange of data based on peer-to-peer (P2P) 
network. Blockchain is open-ended and its 
operation is decentralised. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The research adopted in this investigation consists of 
investigating IoT, edge computing, security in IoT and on 
edge, and experimentation to evaluate a secured IoT system. 
A combination of qualitative and quantitative research will 
inform the design of such IoT systems for healthcare 
applications. 
A. Qualitative Research  
A survey was carried out in care homes, and this was 
aimed at nurses and carers who work with elderly patients 
who are prone to developing pressure sores. This survey 
aimed to identify the gap in knowledge in the use and 
adoption of IoT in healthcare to help reduce the occurrence 
of bedsores and the need for IoT systems and security. The 
following information was gathered to help gain a better 
understanding of the current situation; 
• 
The time intervals that service users are turned 
to prevent sores from developing 
• 
If pressure sores are monitored in real-time 
• 
How the patients’ data are viewed and logged 
• 
Security measures currently in place 
• 
The security measure that they would be applied 
to prevent attacks and detect intrusion.  
Below shows some feedback from the survey 
conducted:

Figure 2e. Preference of the passcode for the two-factor authentication 
Many healthcare staff are used to the traditional method 
of periodically checking on the patients and turning them. 
Many times, these patients are turned even before the next 
expected reposition time. Moreover, with this constant turn, 
not to forget, these carers hurt their backs with the frequent 
bending positions while repositioning patients. An IoT 
system in place would save the health staff time of checking 
patients' position and the level of pressure being exerted by 
different parts of the body, but they would be able to monitor 
the pressure being applied on the skin in real-time. 
B. Quantitative Research  
With the information gathered from the survey, 
experiments would be performed to design the system 
required to monitor patients prone to developing sores in 
real-time. A secured system using edge devices to monitor 
and detect intrusion by deploying machine learning would be 
developed. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  
The IoT based system would enable the healthcare staff 
to monitor patients’ vitals in real-time. This system will help 
prevent sores from developing in these patients. Different 
service users are turned at different time intervals depending 
on the skin’s vulnerability to developing sores, everyone 
hour, two hours, or three hours, but the most common is two-
hourly turns. Certain parts of the body are more prone to 
sores than other parts. The pressure sores monitoring system 
would monitor the pressure exerted in real-time on the 
ThingSpeak network so the health staff can keep track of the 
pressure being exerted on that part of the body and reposition 
the patient as needed. This system is designed to gather, 
process, store and analyze the data. 
The system consists of the pressure sensors, LED, 
Arduino UNO, Esp8266 and ThingSpeak network cloud 
platform. 
 
Figure 3. Architecture of the proposed system. 
A. Obtaining sensing data 
The pressure sensor reads when pressure is exerted on 
different body parts and passed through to the edge device 
and the cloud network. To provide a more secure system, a 
two-factor authentication (2FA) system would be deployed. 
Staff would be required to input a passcode while logging 
into the platform through a webpage.

B. Creating a Secured Website and Implementing the Two-
Factor authentication (2FA). 
A webpage was designed where the 2FA would be 
required to get into the system. The staff would need an 
authentication code to log into the system not just the 
traditional login method involving staff email and password. 
The authentication code was used based on the feedback 
that was received from the survey that was conducted. 
 
Figure 5. Staff login page 
 
Figure 6. Authentication page 
C. Obtaining the data from ThingSpeak and applying ML 
The sensor will be connected to the edge device, which 
would transmit the data safely over the network through the 
transceiver ESP8266, acting as a gateway to ThingSpeak. 
ThingSpeak provides a secured Transport Layer Security 
(TLS) protocol. The data obtained would be used in 
MATLAB to train the model to detect intrusion. To test that 
the system is functioning, unauthorized access data would 
be injected into the system for intrusion detection. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper we present our research on the IoT 
application in care homes. The care staff are still using the 
traditional paper-based methods of logging patients’ data as 
evident from the survey conducted. There is a need for a safe 
IoT system for storage, transfer, and easy retrieval of 
patients’ data on the cloud. The proposed IoT system is 
designed to fill this need. The system will enable a transfer 
of data from the IoT based sensors, such as pressure sensors, 
to the cloud (TTN and ThingSpeak) and will have strong 
security features. Two-factor authentication (2FA), which 
was implemented is proving to be one of the safest security 
features to ensure data protection and security and prevent 
unauthorized access. The staff will be able to access the 
cloud platform, record the data on the system and retrieve 
real-time information on patients’ data. In addition, the 
proposed system would involve analysis of the data on the 
ThingSpeak platform and using machine learning algorithms 
in MATLAB to run simulations and train machine learning 
models to detect safety breaches. Future work would be 
focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed 
system in a case study that will involve a monitoring of 
pressure to prevent pressure sores. The effectiveness of the 
system will consider the safe communication of the sensors 
data, storage, and retrieval of the information on a cloud and 
safe access to the data by the home care staff.
