Abstract — The Autonomic Computing (AC) concept has 
received strong interest amongst the academic and industrial 
research communities since its introduction exactly a decade ago. 
It is important, after the first decade, to evaluate the actual work 
done in achieving the original vision of this concept. In this short 
paper we present a brief report of our work in this direction. We 
have analyzed all the proceedings (2004 – 2011) of two leading AC 
conferences (ICAC and ICAS) to show the trends in and direction 
of AC research and to identify current and future research 
challenges.  
Keywords- autonomic computing; trends and direction 
 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The International Conference on Autonomic Computing 
(ICAC) and the International Conference on Autonomic and 
Autonomous Systems (ICAS) are two leading AC conferences 
and have together published about 647 high quality research 
papers in eight years of the first ten years of AC research. We 
believe that the two conferences give a true representation of 
the distribution of interest, work done, and trends in AC 
research. Papers used in this work are sourced from [1]. AC 
research is widely viewed to have started with the publication 
of [46] in 2001 introducing the concept of AC and [47] 
elucidating further the AC vision. However, only high level 
analysis, requirements and challenges of AC were presented. 
Jeffrey Kephart in a keynote during ICAC 2011 
presented an excellent analysis of the extent to which the 
original AC vision has been realized, and some discussion 
and speculation about the remaining research challenges [2]. 
While 
Kephart 
concentrated 
more 
on 
the 
various 
technological threads, their origins and how they have 
progressed, our focus is mainly on the level of maturity in 
terms of the types of, and scale of, problems targeted at the 
various stages. This enables us to reflect on the overall 
progress in the field, and to be able to identify current and 
future challenges. Our work is not just a review but also a 
validation of our earlier proposed roadmap (pathway) to 
achieving the goal of autonomic computing [21]. 
We reviewed a total of 647 research publications 
including keynotes (336 of which are from ICAC and 311 
from ICAS) using webometrics and direct analysis techniques. 
These are analyzed in terms of main application domain, 
emphasis, and technical approach as well as author 
distribution. Our result is an empirical evaluation of the 
overall impact, trends and state-of-the-art of AC research 
activity. 
An analysis-by-problem approach reveals a particular 
pattern (problem definition to issues of scale) in tackling the 
AC vision. On the horizon there is the challenge of 
coexistence 
and 
interoperability 
between 
Autonomic 
Managers and yet beyond the current state-of-the-art, and 
even further beyond state-of-practice are issues of validation, 
trustworthiness 
and 
certification, 
requiring 
solutions 
specifically tailored for run-time self-adaptive systems.  
Overall, very impressive progress has been made in the 
first decade, and this has been driven by the interest of the 
main sponsors – industry leaders such as IBM, Sun, Motorola, 
Google, Microsoft and Hewlet Packard, amongst others.  
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: 
Section II gives a high level and general analysis of all 
conference proceedings. Section III discuses trends and 
direction, showing the pattern of how the research challenge 
is being tackled by the AC research community while Section 
IV concludes the work. 
II. 
HIGH LEVEL AND GENERAL ANALYSIS 
Tables I and II are high level analysis of conference 
proceedings mainly taken from IEEE Computer Society 
Digital Library [1]. A select few areas have been chosen and 
some of these are discussed in this first report. In terms of 
authoring, 
the 
academic 
community 
has 
the 
most 
publications. While ICAS is academic dominant, ICAC has 
been predominantly industry driven until recently. This 
explains why on the average even though ICAS has more 
publications ICAC has a far greater number of datacenter-
oriented papers and has been somewhat dominated by this 
application domain. In terms of emphasis, contrary to popular 
assumption that self-optimization takes the top shot, our 
investigation actually shows that the predominance of work in 
the field continues to focus on self-healing followed by self-
configuration, self-optimization and then self-protection. Both 
conferences maintain the same trend. Out of all the self-CHOP 
(self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization and self-
protection) based publications in Tables I and II put together, 
35% focus on self-healing while 27% on self-configuration, 
22% are on self-optimization and 16% on self-protection 
(Figure 1). In terms of technical approaches, good progress 
has been made in using specific techniques including machine 
learning [3, 4, 5], fuzzy logic [6, 7], utility functions [8, 9] 
and policies [10, 11, 12] to define and achieve self-managing 
capabilities. 
Alternative 
autonomic 
architectures 
(e.g., 
Intelligent Machine Design [13]) have also been proposed.

In terms of application domain, the datacentre clearly 
tops the ranking in terms of interest to the community. This is 
partly because the AC vision is industry-borne and has 
continued to be driven by the industry. This is evidenced by 
the number of papers (including on datacentre) that are 
authoured, co-authoured or sponsored by the industry 
partners. Datacentres are very complex; in fact have many 
dimensions of complexity; which arise from their scale, 
necessary speed of operation, and large number of tuning 
parameters. In addition they have high power costs, including 
a significant cost component for the cooling systems. 
Autonomic Computing arose because of the need for 
automatic management of such complexity and successful 
autonomic techniques in this domain translate into significant 
financial reward for the owners and users of such systems. 
This high complexity is also attractive to academic 
researchers as it provides a rich domain in which to evaluate a 
wide range of techniques, tools and frameworks for AC. 
With the vested interest, it is clear why the industry 
takes the lead in datacentre related research when the industry 
led ICAC is compared with the academic led ICAS (Figure 2). 
While the influence is understandably obvious for ICAC, the 
academic community, in ICAS, has diversified the research to 
cover other areas more evenly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
But, there is also a noticeable industry influence on 
ICAS; In the first year (2005) of ICAS there was only one 
datacentre related paper but the second year saw a jump and 
at the same time the industry participation on ICAS also saw a 
jump almost with the same margin. This could be arguably 
one other reason why the academic community‟s interest has 
significantly drifted towards datacentre (Figure 3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, good progress has been recorded in achieving 
the AC vision with growing inter-disciplinary collaborations 
as well as industry and academic partnerships. The industry 
has a visible influence over the research direction 
notwithstanding the lead by the academia (in terms of number 
of publications –Tables I and II). This is a key factor in why 
datacentre is the most addressed application domain. Figure 3 
shows how the academic community is responding to this 
influence. Industry inspired and driven ICAC is one of the first 
conferences to address the AC vision while ICAS is a leading

academia response to the challenge. Kephart [2] also 
concludes that in terms of application domain, the datacentre 
has emerged as the primary area of interest to the AC research 
community. With this fact we draw, in Section III, the AC 
research trends, direction and remaining challenges using 
datacentre as case study.  
III. 
TRENDS AND DIRECTION  
We believe that trends in datacentre research will reflect 
similar patterns in other application domains. So the analysis 
in this section will mainly focus on datacentre. We use 
analysis-by-problem approach (Figure 4) to show the pattern 
(in terms of maturity stages) of how the research challenge is 
being tackled by the AC research community. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4 shows the stages (A - C) the community has 
adopted in addressing autonomic computing and our view of 
the future challenges (D and E) towards achieving the goal of 
autonomic computing. We keep this to a high level, but 
appreciate that finer-grained sub stages exist. We classify the 
stages against a maturity timeline, as shown in Table III.

Our investigation reveals that in the early stage research 
focused mainly on stating the problem and challenge of ever 
growing system complexity [14, 15], the need for solution and 
justifying autonomicity as that solution [16, 17]. Majority of 
work in this area are hinged on dynamic resource allocation 
[18, 19, 20] and are industry (e.g., IBM, HP, Sun, etc) 
dominant (Table III).  Towards the middle stage the 
community intensified effort in developing and applying 
techniques which have now been established and are 
increasingly used in today‟s research e.g., policy-driven 
autonomics [11, 41], utility functions [42, 43], fuzzy logic [6, 
44]  etc. Also progress was made in identifying and solving 
specific problems in isolation. A significant number of papers 
offered specific solutions to specific problems, e.g., [23, 24, 
25, 26, and 27]. Some examples of the variety of these 
include; [27] proposes a control scheme for dynamic resource 
provisioning in a virtualized datacentre environment to 
address issues of power management without trading 
performance. Experiments report that the controller, while 
still maintaining QoS goals, is able to conserve power by 
26%.  [25 and 26] investigate thermal load management to 
address heating in datacenters. While Justin et al [25] 
concentrated 
on 
predicting 
the 
effects 
of 
workload 
distribution and cooling configurations on temperature 
(deducing heat profile), Saeed et al [26] based their work on 
workload scaling. Radu Calinescu in [24] implemented an 
earlier proposed generic autonomic framework (based on 
service-oriented 
architecture) 
and 
demonstrated 
the 
effectiveness of his framework in resource allocation while 
[23] presents an automatic diagnosis framework to 
dynamically 
identify 
bottlenecks 
in 
large 
systems. 
Virtualisation and power management [27, 28] are also of 
interest in this area. Work in this stage largely comprise of 
implementations, 
demonstrations 
and 
presentation 
of 
experimented results of proposed ideas. Towards the end of 
our list of reviewed papers we discover that the community is 
now addressing the bigger picture with concern now more to 
do with scale [29, 30, 31], and generalisation of techniques so 
as to make re-usable solutions. At this stage issues of 
heterogeneity of services and platforms [32, 33] began to 
arise. The community is now addressing large scale 
datacentres with diverse heterogeneous platforms. The 
increase in scale and size of datacentres coupled with 
heterogeneity of services and platforms means that more 
Autonomic Managers could be integrated to achieve a 
particular goal. This has led to the need for interoperability 
between Autonomic Managers. 
Interoperability has been somewhat neglected as a 
challenge to date. Earlier work was fundamentally concerned 
with getting autonomic computing to work and establishing 
fundamental concepts and demonstrating viability. Many 
mechanisms and techniques have been explored. Now that the 
concept of autonomic computing is well understood and 
widely accepted the focus can shift to the next level; - i.e. 
how to manage multi-manager scenarios, to govern 
interactions between managers and to arbitrate when conflicts 
arise. These are the kind of problems on the horizon. For 
example, when more than one autonomic manager is needed 
to coordinate a system, there may be situations where one 
manager counters the decision of another. There have been a 
few mentions and general discussion around this problem [34, 
35, 37] lately. The community has not yet made good 
progress on this though there are efforts on the way. For 
example Richard et al [36] evaluates the nature and scope of 
the interoperability challenges for AC systems, identifies a set 
of requirements for a universal solution and proposes a 
service-based approach to interoperability to handle both 
direct and indirect conflicts in a multi-manager scenario. In

this approach, an Interoperability Service interacts with 
autonomic managers through a dedicated interface and is able 
to detect possible conflicts of management interest. In this 
way the Interoperability Service manages all interoperability 
activities by granting or withholding management rights to 
different autonomic managers as appropriate. 
On the other hand, beyond current mainstream thinking 
are problems of validation, trustworthiness and certification. 
A lot of questions have not been considered or fully 
answered. For example, „what are the processes to ensure that 
component upgrades that are tested and confirmed in isolation 
will not cause harm in a multi-system environment?‟, „how 
can certified autonomic systems be achieved?‟ and „how can 
users be confident that a system does what it says?‟ [38].  In 
Tables I and II a number of Validation, Trustworthiness and 
Certification (VTC) related papers have been published but 
only a few are actual VTC methodologies and only one of 
these [39] considers datacentre. The number for VTC includes 
mainly those papers that incorporated validation, testing and 
reliability 
into 
their 
architectures, 
frameworks 
or 
implementations and not necessarily as a core or critical 
feature. For example, in seven years of ICAS only one paper 
[37] proposes a method. The work in [37] presents a 
framework (based on model checking) for verifying and 
detecting constraint violation when two or more workflows 
are executed on the same system as a way of ensuring system 
trustworthiness. The few in ICAC include [38], [39] and [40]. 
Hoi et al [38] asks the critical question of “How can we trust 
an autonomic system to make the best decision?” and 
proposes a „trust‟ architecture to win the trust of AC system 
users. Shinji et al [39] proposes a policy verification and 
validation framework that is based on model checking to 
verify the validity of administrator‟s specified policies in a 
policy-based system. Because a known performing policy 
may lead to erroneous behaviour if the system (in any aspect) 
is changed slightly, the framework is based on checking the 
consistency of the policy and the system‟s defined model or 
characteristics. In all the reviewed papers, this is the only VTC 
method implemented with datacentre case study. Heo and 
Abdelzaher [40] presented „AdaptGuard‟, a software designed 
to guard adaptive systems from instability resulting from 
system disruptions. The software is able to infer and detect 
instability and then intervenes (to restore the system) without 
actually understanding the root cause of the problem –root-
cause-agnostic recovery.  
Our research group has been working on this problem 
for some time and in ICAS 2011 we presented several works 
[13, 21, and 22] identifying the problems of robust design, 
validation and related issues on trustworthiness leading to 
certification. In [21], we outline the challenges in current 
autonomic system validation methods and propose a strategy 
leading 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
autonomic 
systems 
certification. This strategy is a roadmap defining the stages or 
processes in the journey towards full autonomic computing. 
We posit that there are significant limitations to the way in 
which AC systems are validated, with heavy reliance on 
traditional design-time techniques, despite the highly dynamic 
behaviour of these systems in dealing with run-time 
configuration changes and environmental and context 
changes. 
These 
limitations 
ultimately 
undermine 
the 
trustability of these systems and are barriers to eventual 
certification. Haffiz, Richard and Mariusz [13] proposed a 
framework that will allow for proper certification of AC 
systems. Central to this framework is an alternative 
autonomic architecture based of Intelligent Machine Design 
which draws from the human autonomic nervous system. 
James, Richard and Miltos [22] demonstrated Teleo-Reactive 
(T-R) programming approach to autonomic software systems 
and shows how T-R technique can be used to detect 
validation issues at design time and thus reducing the cost of 
validation issues. We strongly believe that certification is 
critical to achieving the full goal of AC. We have a longer 
term vision to develop trustworthy and certifiable autonomic 
systems and hope to progress towards this through defining 
validation techniques. We propose that one vital step in this 
chain is to introduce robust techniques by which the systems 
can be described in universal language, starting with a 
description of, and means to measure the type and extent of 
autonomicity (autonomic functionalities) they provide [45]. 
Another of our current focus area is interoperability [36] 
where we are evaluating the nature and scope of the 
interoperability challenges for AC systems, identifying a set 
of requirements for a universal solution and proposing a 
service-based approach to interoperability to handle both 
direct and indirect conflicts in a multi-manager scenario. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION  
We have presented a review and analysis of the actual 
work done in achieving the original vision of autonomic 
computing (AC) after the first decade. We reviewed all ICAC 
and ICAS proceedings (2004 – 2011) and have shown what 
the trends and directions there are in the AC research. Our 
investigation transcends technologies and how they have 
progressed to include areas, origins and scale of maturity. Our 
results also show the current and future (or remaining) 
challenges facing the AC research community. Beyond being 
a review, this work also illustrates a pathway to achieving the 
goal of AC and validates our earlier proposed roadmap [21]. 
The community has made good progress in terms of 
autonomic technologies and in terms of collaboration or 
partnership between the industry and academia. Though the 
research is driven by the industry (the major sponsors) the 
academia has also woken to the challenge. In terms of 
application domain, the datacentre appears to dominate the 
interest of the community. This is chiefly because AC is 
industry borne and also the datacentre provides the academia 
a rich and complex environment for diverse implementations 
and testing. As systems grow in complexity and scale, the 
community must now deal with addressing issues of 
interoperability in multi-manager scenarios. This is one of the 
critical issues on the horizon. Beyond current thinking, the 
community will need to provide answers to issues of 
validation, trustworthiness, standardisation and certification 
of autonomic computing systems.
