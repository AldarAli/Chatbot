Abstract— The current energy crisis affects the whole Europe, 
making cross-border provision of climate data indispensable. 
Energy-related applications are thus becoming increasingly 
significant also for geospatial service development. Climate 
properties of the study areas are often critical for informed 
decisions in energy applications. Energy and climate are 
selected as important use cases in the GeoE3 (Geospatially 
Enabled Ecosystem for Europe) project involving five European 
countries. 
The 
cloud-based data integrations 
platform 
developed in the project facilitates harmonized access to climate 
properties provided by meteorological institutes in all of the 
participating countries. Various download and direct access 
methods are applied in getting the climate data to the platform, 
from which it is offered to the client applications via the OGC 
API Coverages service interface.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Consistent cross-border delivery of harmonized climate 
data has become indispensable with the current energy crisis 
ravaging whole Europe. It is particularly important to provide 
access to climate properties in connection of geospatial 
services [1][2], for example to support energy-related 
decisions in spatial planning and in the construction industry. 
Buildings are an important factor in energy-saving endeavors 
and it is thus critical to provide climate properties readily 
connected with building data. 
The Geospatially Enabled Ecosystem for Europe (GeoE3) 
project has been developing a cloud-based service platform 
for cross-border and cross-domain integration of geospatial 
data resources [3]. Climate data has been selected from the 
beginning as one of the key data sources in the project. 
Renewable energy is one of the three use cases of GeoE3, 
making buildings a central content theme for the project. 
GeoE3 involves five European countries: Finland, 
Estonia, Norway, the Netherlands and Spain. National 
Mapping and Cadastral Agencies (NMCAs) of each country 
are participating as members of the project consortium. Cross-
border access to 3D building models has been one of the main 
goals of the project. This goal has been quite successfully 
achieved, as 3D buildings from all members countries are now 
available from the GeoE3 integration platform [4]. 
The national meteorological institute is present in the 
project consortium only in case of Finland. However, open 
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been made 
available by the Norwegian, Dutch and Spanish national 
meteorological institutes. Dedicated access modules have 
been developed for the integration platform to accommodate 
the varying meteorological APIs available. 
Climate data is made available to client applications from 
the platform via the modern Open Geospatial Consortium’s 
(OGC) OGC API Coverages access interface that also enables 
climate properties to be attached to individual buildings [5]. 
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II 
introduces the GeoE3 integration platform. Section III 
discusses the solutions used for accessing climate data from 
the five participating countries. Section IV describes the 
approach applied for the harmonized provision of climate data 
via the OGC API Coverages service interface. The paper ends 
with conclusions in Section V. 
II. 
INTEGRATION PLATFORM 
The GeoE3 integration platform is a cloud-based service 
providing single point access to all thematic content offered 
by the project [6]. The platform is essentially based on 
pygeoapi, a Python implementation of the OGC API family of 
service interface standards [7]. On the GeoE3 platform, 
pygeoapi has been adapted to run on top of the web service 
development framework called Django [8]. In addition to the 
selected climate-related content themes: Temperature, 
Windspeed and Sunshine, the platform also provides 
harmonized access to the following themes: 2D/3D buildings, 
2D/3D roads, Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital 
Surface Model (DSM). At the moment the platform contains 
altogether 42 datasets/services (2D buildings: 7, 3D buildings: 
7, 2D roads 4, 3D roads: 2, DTM: 6, DSM: 5, temperature: 5, 
windspeed: 4, sunshine: 2). 
Dedicated content provider modules have been developed 
to access national legacy service end points providing data in 
national schemas. The integration platform takes care of all 
necessary harmonization procedures to make the content 
offering consistent across participating countries, and makes 
harmonized content available to client applications via the 
service interfaces conforming to the modern OGC API family 
of access standards. Physically the integration platform runs

Center for Science (CSC) in Kajaani, Finland [9].

ACCESS METHODS 
The development for the provision of climate data service 
interface on the GeoE3 integration platform started with the 
Finnish data, as Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) is one 
of the project members [10]. Access to meteorological APIs 
in Norway and the Netherlands was found via the respective 
NMCAs. With the help of the Spanish NMCA, an API 
facilitating download of climate data sets from Spain was then 
found. A data repository maintained by the FinEst Centre for 
Smart Cities finally enabled provisional access also to 
Estonian climate data resources. 
The solution for climate data access provided by FMI is 
based on OGC API Features implementation. The climate 
properties available from the FMI API include 30 years (1991-
2020) averages of temperature, windspeed and yearly 
sunshine hours [11]. The resulting data set includes 
temperature values from 99 observation stations, windspeed 
values from 25 stations and sunshine hours from 8 stations. 
From the station values and positions an interpolated grid 
representation is computed using Python libraries Pandas [12] 
and SciPy [13]. The interpolation method ‘linear’ is used, 
where observation station positions makes it possible, and the 
‘nearest’ operation is applied for the rest of the country’s area. 
The result is saved as a GeoTIFF image file on the integration 
platform. The stored image is used as the source of the 
platform’s content provision via OGC API Coverages until 
the file is removed, when the FMI API is accessed again. The 
same base processing pipeline (see Figure 4) is followed with 
all the climate themes across all countries’ meteorological 
APIs. 
In the case of Norway, a custom API called Frost was 
used, provided by MET Norway [14]. The API requires 
registration and use of an API key in all data access requests. 
The API follows the principles established for a RESTful API 
and provides the results in JSON encoding. The API provides 
access to 30 years temperature values from 275 observation 
stations and windspeed values from 230 stations. Long period 
averages are computed by the integration platform for the 
period 1991-2020 and the grid representation then saved into 
the GeoTIFF file. 
Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute has made 
available a data access solution called KNMI Data Platform 
[15]. It offers a flexible API-based file download mechanism. 
At the moment temperature is the only climate property 
accessed from KNMI Data Platform. The value is available 
for 28 observation stations and represents 30 years averages 
(1981-2010). Values are retrieved from the downloaded 
NetCDF file using a Python library netCDF4, interpolated into 
a grid representation and stored as a GeoTIFF file to the 
integration platform. 
The Spanish national meteorological institute Agencia 
Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) provides an open access 
data platform AEMET OpenData [16]. After registration, an 
API key is provided for accessing the site. The platform offers 
an Open API -based access interface for retrieval of 30 years’ 
(1981-2010) 
average 
temperature 
values 
from 
105 
observation stations, windspeed values from 103 stations and 
sunshine values from 85 stations. The values are accessed via 
the API by station, yearly averages are computed from 
monthly values, and various unit conversions are applied. The 
climate values are finally interpolated and saved to the 
GeoTIFF file. 
In the case of Estonia, the service development is still 
ongoing. Historical weather observations are available from 
the FinEst Centre for Smart Cities [17]. Observation stations 
datasets are manually downloaded as text files. The files are 
then processed to retrieve temperature averages for 98 
observation stations and windspeed averages for 39 stations. 
At the moment the Estonian dataset only covers a short period 
of a few months in 2022. 
IV. 
 SERVICE PROVISION 
On the GeoE3 integration platform, Climate data is offered 
to client applications via the OGC API Coverages service 
interface. This enables clients to retrieve grid representations 
for various image-based applications and analysis processes. 
The platform offers a basic visualization functionality for 
climate themes, together with simple download options (see 
Figure 1).

interface of the GeoE3 integration platform. 
Participating countries are treated as individual data 
collections inside the single theme-specific OGC API 
Coverages service instance. For example, the theme 
‘Temperature’ contains currently five data collections, one for 
each participating country. This arrangement enables natural 
cross-border data integration inside a single service end point.

Via the OGC API Coverages interface, climate properties 
can also be queried at arbitrary point locations across the 
whole data extent. This enables these properties to be 
connected as additional attributes for example to individual 
building features. On the GeoE3 integration platform, this 
connection is made to the 2D buildings. An example of a 
Finnish building with climate attributes displayed is presented 
in Figure 2.

attributes. 
Map visualization of the current integration platform’s 
user interface is based on OpenLayers library [18]. Support 
for OGC API Coverages has been added by custom code 
making use of OpenLayers source class ImageStatic.

and Norway. 
 
The so called cross-collection query mechanism facilitates 
cross-border content queries to be made. Currently this 
mechanism is officially defined only for the OGC API 
Features interface specification [19]. In the GeoE3 project, an 
experimental cross-collection query support has been 
developed for OGC API Coverages service. The query can be 
formulated as follows: 
 
.../geoe3/temperature/search? 
f=png& 
collections=temperature_NO,temperature_FI& 
subset=x(396919:3888202),y(7701052:11580281)& 
scale-size=x(900),y(1000) 
 
With the ‘collections’ parameter, the desired data 
collections can be identified. If the query extent, defined by 
the parameter ‘subset’, crosses a country boundary, the 
resulting image will be an integrated visualization of the 
output of the involved countries. Consistent color maps have 
been applied for all countries’ climate themes, making the 
visualizations comparable across national borders. As an 
example, the image resulting from the above query is shown 
in Figure 3. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
A dynamic content integration mechanism has been 
established on the GeoE3 integration platform. Participating 
countries’ datasets are treated as individual data collections 
inside an OGC API Features or OGC API Coverages service 
end point. This arrangement enables natural cross-border 
integration of geospatial content. This kind of integrated 
dataset can be accessed from the platform employing the so 
called cross-collection query mechanism, officially defined 
for OGC API Features and experimentally implemented for 
OGC API Coverages on the GeoE3 integration platform. 
Cross-domain integration has been achieved by accessing 
climate properties representing long period averages from 
various custom APIs provided by meteorological institutes. A 
dedicated provider module has been developed on the 
integration platform for each API to accommodate the 
differences in service protocol and content encoding. The 
result is stored in a GeoTIFF image as cache on the platform. 
Harmonized climate properties are then delivered via the 
OGC API Coverages interface, enabling both raster image and 
point value retrieval. Point values are integrated by the 
platform as additional attributes to the building features also 
available from the platform. 
The cross-border and cross-domain content integration 
functionality offered by the GeoE3 integration platform 
facilitates applications requiring access to harmonized, 
geospatially referenced climate data across Europe. In 
particular, combined with building datasets, the climate 
properties support applications aimed at saving of energy or 
finding new renewable energy solutions.
