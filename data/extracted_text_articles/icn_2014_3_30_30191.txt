Abstract—In this paper, we propose the adaptive Mobile Voice 
over Internet Protocol (mVoIP) service architecture in 
Software Defined Networking (SDN) networks to provide the 
best quality of mVoIP service to end-users. The key challenges 
in improving the mVoIP Quality of Experience (QoE) are 
forwarding data path optimization for VoIP flows and 
optimized codec selection with consideration of network 
congestion. Based on network Quality of Service (QoS) data 
and predicted mVoIP QoE data to be collected in SDN 
networks through mVoIP agents, the proposed service 
architecture improves mVoIP QoS. In particular, this paper 
focuses on the improvement of mVoIP QoS by adaptive codec 
selection optimization and proposes an algorithm for adaptive 
codec selection in SDN networks.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) [1] has become one 
of the most widely used protocols for voice service delivery. 
It has been used not only for public services, such as Skype 
and Viber, but also for private services for companies and 
organizations. The quality of a VoIP service mostly depends 
on the voice codec, which is determined by network 
capability and the number of users to be accommodated. 
Thus, to improve the quality of a VoIP service, two factors 
should be considered: VoIP flow control and optimized 
codec selection. 
In Software Defined Networking (SDN) [2] networks, 
which have provided advances in network management, 
VoIP flows can be controlled by an OpenFlow [2] controller, 
such as NOX/POX, Floodlight, Ryu, or OpenDaylight, to 
guarantee Quality of Service (QoS). To adjust for network 
congestion, flow tables of OpenFlow switches need to be 
managed by optimized forwarding path decisions. 
Codec selection is another important factor. Due to 
variation in the number of active users, a fixed voice codec 
negotiated between a VoIP server and VoIP clients without 
consideration of the network situation will cause inefficiency 
and unavailability. In particular, if using a low-quality codec 
under conditions of spare bandwidth, the utilization of 
network bandwidth is inefficient; if using a high-quality 
codec under conditions of insufficient bandwidth, the 
network bandwidth becomes unavailable. To overcome these 
limitations, a method of network situation-aware codec 
selection [3]-[7] is required. 
In this paper, we propose the adaptive Mobile VoIP 
(mVoIP) service architecture based on network QoS data and 
predicted mVoIP Quality of Experience (QoE) data in SDN 
networks. The design of our service architecture was guided 
by two principles: (1) Keep it simple, able to be applied 
without any modification of VoIP client applications, with an 
IP Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system, as a practice for 
VoIP services, (2) Satisfy the Service Level Agreement 
(SLA) for the VoIP service. 
In the proposed architecture, mVoIP QoS is guaranteed 
by forwarding data path control for VoIP flows and 
optimized codec selection with consideration of network 
congestion. To gather QoS data in a wireless network and 
predict the mVoIP QoE, mVoIP QoE measurement agents 
are deployed in the wireless network. An mVoIP QoS 
manager, as a SDN application, collects QoS data on the 
SDN network from OpenFlow switches and mVoIP QoE 
data from mVoIP QoE measurement agents. Then, it decides 
whether the forwarding path for mVoIP flows and the voice 
codec are optimal under specific network conditions. A 
selected voice codec is applied by an mVoIP QoS adapting 
agent within an IP PBX system in the SDN network. 
This paper focuses on adaptive codec selection followed 
by the network QoS and mVoIP QoE data, while the 
forwarding path decision in SDN networks depends on an 
OpenFlow controller and a network slicer such as FlowVisor 
[8]. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Related 
studies are discussed in Section II. In Section III, the 
adaptive mVoIP service architecture in SDN networks is 
described in detail, including the mVoIP QoS manager, the 
mVoIP QoS adapting agent, and the mVoIP QoE 
measurement agent. The algorithm for adaptive codec 
selection in SDN networks is also proposed. In Section IV, 
the conclusions are presented and future works are discussed. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Takahashi et al. [9] presented the factors that determine 
QoS for a VoIP service and a subjective/objective quality 
assessment. For subjective quality assessment, opinion rating 
and the opinion equivalent-Q method are introduced. 
Opinion models such as E-Model and speech-layer objective 
models such as Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality 
(PESQ), P.563, and P.AAM are introduced for objective 
quality assessment. Packet-layer objective models such as 
P.VTQ are also introduced for objective quality assessment, 
which is based merely on IP packet information except for

speech data in the payload. To investigate the relationship 
between subjective and estimated quality, the experiment 
using the modified E-Model was conducted, and the results 
were presented. Finally, a framework for the development of 
quality assessment research was proposed. 
Kim et al. [10] measured PESQ scores to compare the 
performance of various codecs, such as G.711, GSM, iLBC, 
Speex, and Skype’s codec, in wireless networks. The 
experiments were performed by transmitting audio signals 
from one VoIP client to another using the Jack audio router 
through the NIST Net emulator to measure the performance 
of the VoIP codecs. As a result of these experiments, these 
researchers found that Skype was the most robust against 
packet delay and packet loss. Among codecs other than 
commercial services, Speex was robust when packet loss was 
less than 10% and iLBC was very robust under network 
congestion. These results can be utilized to initialize default 
codec sets for the adaptive codec selection method that we 
propose in this paper. 
Sfairopoulou et al. [3] evaluated the performance of a 
combined Call Admission Control with Codec Selection 
(CAC/CS) algorithm proposed in [4], based on three 
policies: non-adaptive policies that start with the lowest and 
highest bandwidth codecs, and an adaptive policy that 
changes codec in randomly active calls. In particular, 
experiments were conducted applying the adaptive policy to 
three cases: applying codec selection (1) only to new call 
requests (on new), (2) only in the presence of rate changes 
(on rate), or (3) both for new calls and at any rate change (on 
both). The on new case presented a low blocking probability 
but high dropping probability; the on rate case maintained 
high estimated Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values under 
high traffic load; and the on both case presented a trade-off 
between blocking and dropping probabilities but the worst 
estimated MOS values. In our study, the proposed 
architecture involves controlling VoIP flow paths according 
to network congestion to guarantee a predefined Call Setup 
Success Rate (CSSR) and Call Drop Rate (CDR), comparing 
them with the CSSR and CDR obtained from an IP PBX 
system. Also, the codec selection method considers the 
number of active calls and the movement of each VoIP client. 
Ng et al. [5] proposed and evaluated an adaptive codec 
switching algorithm for VoIP applications in wired and 
wireless networks. Codec switching during active calling is 
achieved by renegotiating the audio session using a RE-
INVITE message in Session Description Protocol (SDP). To 
evaluate the proposed algorithm, a Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) proxy server was deployed on the real 
network and SIP clients were connected to the wireless 
Access Point (AP). To simulate network congestion, the 
network traffic emulator was also deployed on the wireless 
network. The result was effective in increasing the average 
MOS values when switching between PCMU and GSM, 
while the packet loss rate was more than 16%. However, 
only the packet loss rate was considered to adaptively 
determine the optimized codec in this study. To apply the 
proposed algorithm, SIP client applications should be 
modified based on the calculated packet loss rate. In our 
proposed architecture, both a client application and an IP 
PBX system require no modification to be practical. 
Roychoudhuri et al. [6] proposed adaptive rate control for 
audio packets, which is based on packet loss prediction and 
on-line audio quality assessment. Audio Genome was used to 
store the codec type, loss distribution, and delay to derive the 
audio quality of the ongoing transmission. The adaptive rate 
control framework was proposed to combine all audio 
codecs with Audio Genome to maintain optimized audio 
quality. In the proposed framework, the Rate-Quality 
Optimization problem is to maximize the audio quality under 
the constraints of available bandwidth and delay. The 
experiment for Rate-Quality Optimization was conducted 
with the codecs PCMU, G.721, GSM FR, G.728, and 
G.723.1 in six scenarios. In the scenario of low available 
bandwidth and low delay among them, the feasible solution 
was G.728 (61%) and PCMU (39%). In the worst-case 
scenario of low available bandwidth and high delay, the 
feasible solution was G.721 (72%), G.728 (19%), and 
PCMU (8%). One of our approaches is to determine the 
priority set of optimized codecs and quality options, when 
VoIP client applications and an IP PBX system are used 
without any modification. Thus, these results can be used to 
create default codec sets in our adaptive codec selection 
method with [10]. 
Qiao et al. [7] proposed a QoS control scheme that 
combines rate-adaptive and priority marking QoS control to 
improve speech quality. A VoIP simulation system with a 
NS-2 network simulator was used to simulate VoIP flow, 
which includes an encoder/decoder/marker for the Adaptive 
Multi-Rate (AMR) codec, a bitrate controller, and a loss 
simulator. The MOS scores were predicted using PESQ 
based on given AMR rates and packet loss. Because each 
VoIP client application supports different codecs, a set of 
diverse codecs including non-multi-rate codecs is applied in 
our adaptive codec selection method. 
III. ADAPTIVE MVOIP SERVICE ARCHITECTURE 
The quality of VoIP service depends on the codec used 
and the network condition. If high-quality codecs are used 
for the VoIP service, the voice quality is very good, but the 
number of VoIP channels is less than in the case of using 
low-quality codecs due to VoIP bandwidth consumption. 
The bandwidth consumption, which is represented by B, 
can be calculated by (1). The codec bit rate and packets per 
second (PPS) are calculated by dividing the codec sample 
size (SS) by the codec sample interval (SI) and dividing the 
codec bit rate by the voice payload size (PS), respectively. 
The total bandwidth consumption for the VoIP service can 
be calculated by multiplying the VoIP packet size (P) by 
PPS and the number of channels (C), while P is represented 
by the sum of data link layer header, the IP/UDP/RTP header, 
and the voice payload size. 
B = (SS × P × C) / (SI × PS)                    (1) 
In SDN networks, OpenFlow switches maintain their 
flow tables based on the FlowModify messages which are 
sent from the OpenFlow controller to determine the shortest

 packet paths. To improve and guarantee VoIP QoS, the flow 
paths between the IP PBX system and the VoIP clients 
should be determined by consideration of the network 
conditions, such as bandwidth and latency. After that, the 
optimized codec can be selected based on the bandwidth 
usage rate and the channel requirement. It allows the priority 
of the codec to be rearranged based on the network condition 
and the number of currently active users of the VoIP service. 
This paper proposes an adaptive mVoIP service 
architecture in SDN networks, which consists of the mVoIP 
QoS manager, mVoIP QoE measurement agents, and the 
mVoIP QoS adapting agent as shown in Fig. 1. The SDN 
network connects with an OpenFlow controller, OpenFlow 
switches, Non-OpenFlow wireless APs for connecting to 
mVoIP clients, and an IP PBX system. 
A. mVoIP QoE Measurement Agent 
In the proposed architecture, mVoIP QoE measurement 
agents on the dedicated systems conduct bandwidth and 
latency measurements from themselves to the IP PBX 
system. Although the controller has all the information on 
the network topology and can measure bandwidth and 
latency by itself, the agents need to measure them because 
non-OpenFlow APs are regarded as edge nodes in SDN 
networks, and the links between an AP and its connected 
devices may be critical bottlenecks. These measurements are 
not conducted by the agents on mobile devices due to 
excessive battery consumption.  
The agent on a mobile device merely collects the 
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) value from 
broadcasting information, sent by an AP, to judge the 
mobility of the VoIP clients. The movement of the VoIP 
client can be judged by GPS, gyroscope, and RSSI data. 
Because the GPS or the gyroscope sensor of a mobile device 
deals with movement in very wide or narrow areas, 
respectively, the RSSI value is used to judge the mobility of 
the device. It also directly reflects the wireless network 
condition. Thus, frequent variation of the RSSI value shows 
that a VoIP client is moving and implies that a codec with 
low bandwidth consumption is determined in spite of 
sufficient available bandwidth. 
The VoIP quality metrics are categorized as call setup 
quality and call quality. Call setup quality is estimated by 
CSSR and CDR, which can be gathered from the mVoIP 
QoS adapting agent that communicates with the IP PBX 
system. Low CSSR and CDR show that the flow path 
between the AP and the IP PBX system should be modified 
to avoid network congestion. 
Call quality can be measured by a subjective MOS test. 
Due to time-consuming efforts and expensive cost, the E-
Model is used as an alternative to human-based MOS 
estimation to predict call quality. The gross score, which is 
represented by the R-value, of the E-Model is computed by: 
R = Ro – Is – Id – Ie + A                        (2)

and echo effects; Ie represents impairments caused by low 
bit-rate codecs; and A is an advantage factor that allows for 
an advantage of access. R-value can be translated to MOS-
Conversational Quality Estimated (MOS-CQE) by (3) 
[11],[12]. 
MOS-CQE =                                                                     (3)

(R>100) 
R-value is calculated by using VoIP QoE measurement 
tools, such as VoIPmonitor [13] and pjsip-perf [14], and is 
transformed into a MOS scale by the agents. Then, the 
agents send all the gathered data to the mVoIP QoS manager, 
including the bandwidth, the latency, and the RSSI data, to 
adaptively select the optimized codec. 
B. mVoIP QoS Manager 
Based on the network QoS and estimated mVoIP QoE 
information, such as MOS-CQE, the mVoIP QoS manager 
determines the flow path between an AP and the IP PBX 
system and chooses the codec preference. The new flow path 
is updated by the OpenFlow controller, and the new codec 
preference is set by the mVoIP QoS adapting agent into the 
IP PBX system. Fig. 2 depicts data flow among the manager 
and agents on the proposed architecture. 
The algorithm for adaptive codec selection according to 
network conditions and VoIP service policies is described in 
Table I. First of all, before determining an optimized codec 
preference set, the flow paths among the APs and the IP 
PBX system are recalculated, particularly when CSSR or 
CDR does not satisfy the predefined threshold. For example, 
in Korea, the CSSR and CDR thresholds can be defined as 
95% and 5%, respectively, according to the standard 
proposed by Telecommunication Technology Association 
(TTA) [15]. 
In the proposed algorithm, the codec set consuming 
minimal bandwidth is selected when the number of current 
active users is greater than the designed channel requirement, 
the network latency is lower than the predefined latency 
threshold, or the mVoIP client is moving. A latency 
threshold can be defined at 150ms, as proposed by TTA [15]. 
For premium users, the codecs providing the best voice 
quality, such as PCM, under the available bandwidth are 
selected when not group-calling. For the other users, the 
codec with the highest MOS-CQE in the minimal bandwidth 
set among the default sets of the APs is set if the consumed 
bandwidth of the selected codec is under the available 
bandwidth and the average bandwidth-consuming current 
available channel with extra one channel is also under the 
available bandwidth.

C. mVoIP QoS Adapting Agent 
The mVoIP QoS adapting agent applies the new codec 
preference and quality options to the IP PBX system. Fig. 3 
shows the interaction between the agent and the IP PBX 
system in detail. In Fig. 3, Asterisk [16] is used as an IP PBX 
server, as it is the most popular IP PBX. The agent 
communicates with Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) to 
maintain the action table. 
The mVoIP QoS manager gathers information, such as 
the supported codec list, CSSR, and CDR, from the IP PBX 
system and updates the codec priority of each VoIP user and 
codec quality options to the IP PBX system through the 
mVoIP QoS adapting agent. 
IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper discusses previous studies of VoIP service 
and its performance in detail and proposes the adaptive 
mVoIP service architecture based on network QoS and 
mVoIP QoE data in SDN networks to improve mVoIP QoS. 
In this architecture, two key approaches are proposed: flow 
path optimization for mVoIP traffic using the SDN controller 
and the adaptive codec selection method. In particular, this 
paper focuses on a network condition-aware codec selection 
method and proposes an algorithm for adaptive codec 
selection for mVoIP in SDN networks. 
In the future, the performance of the proposed algorithm 
will be evaluated in real networks and flow path optimization 
according to the network condition, which is the other 
approach, will be studied between APs and an IP PBX 
system in SDN networks.
