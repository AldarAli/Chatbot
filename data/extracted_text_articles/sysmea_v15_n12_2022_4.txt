Abstract—This paper presents a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
based bias voltage control scheme to compensate for the 
resonant frequency drift of Capacitive Micromachined 
Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) due to fluid loading. A 
unified mathematical model for the resonant frequency of a 
CMUT that includes the electrostatic spring softening effect 
and the fluid loading effect due to the coupled fluidic layer has 
been developed that provides the basis of the proposed 
approach. The actual resonant frequency drift has been 
obtained by comparing the center frequencies of transmitted 
and received signals extracted through analog-to-digital 
conversion (ADC) and subsequent FFT of both signals. The 
frequency drift is then compensated by dynamically adjusting 
the DC bias voltage that modifies the electrostatic spring 
softening parameter. Analytical and COMSOL based 3D Finite 
Element Analysis (FEA) results show that the drift in the 
resonant frequency of a 6 MHz CMUT operated in water can 
be compensated by adjusting the bias voltage by 2% from its 
75% pull-in voltage value to render an improvement of 4% in 
lateral and axial resolutions in imaging applications. A bias 
voltage adjustment of 9% of the 75% pull-in voltage value is 
necessary to achieve an improvement of 20.74% when the 
CMUT is operated in glycerol. The scheme can be realized 
using 
standard 
commercially 
available 
microelectronic 
components to improve the accuracy and reliability of 
diagnostic imaging and non-destructive evaluation (NDE).

INTRODUCTION  
Fluid loading induced resonant frequency drift of 
capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) 
challenge their applications in biomedical imaging, non-
destructive evaluation (NDE), and high intensity focused 
ultrasound (HIFU) applications [1]–[4]. Specifically, the 
phenomenon contributes to lower imaging resolution and 
beamforming functionality compared to the piezoelectric 
ultrasonic transducers. A suitable solution to the problem is 
necessary to exploit the significant advantages of CMUTs 
over the piezoelectric ones, such as low cost fabrication, 
easier CMOS integration, improved signal-to-noise ratio, 
higher fractional bandwidth, and thermal stability.  
The CMUT is basically a reciprocal electrostatic 
transducer that relies on capacitance change between a 
movable and a fixed electrode separated by a small gap to 
generate or receive ultrasound [5][6]. The space between the 
electrodes is filled with either vacuum or a thin film of air. 
The movable electrode (typically a thin diaphragm) is 
supported at the edges by dielectric support posts. 
When a CMUT array operates in a fluidic medium, the 
coupled fluidic layer manifests itself as an inertial mass onto 
the diaphragm and as a viscous damper depending on the 
viscosity of the fluidic medium. As these fluid loading 
effects alter the effective mass of the CMUT diaphragm, a 
drift of the resonant frequency of the CMUT occurs. Since 
the elements in a CMUT array are designed to have a fixed 
pitch to satisfy the Nyquist criteria of spatial sampling in 
beamforming operations, a change in the CMUT resonant 
frequency compromises the functional characteristics of the 
array.  
Attempts to mitigate the fluid loading effects and thereby 
minimize the center frequency drift of CMUT arrays are 
diverse in nature but not too many [7]–[17]. Notably, the 
effects of fluid loading and waveguiding on the performance 
of a CMUT array were addressed in an analytical model 
presented in [7], where frequency dependent equivalent 
density was used as the effective CMUT diaphragm material 
density to account for the distributed fluid loading. The 
authors in [7] also presented the dimensional dependence of 
the equivalent density using a finite element method (FEM) 
model based data fitting technique. In [8], the acoustic 
parameters for an array consisting of parallel driven CMUT 
cells were derived as a complex mechanical fluid impedance 
that depends on the diaphragm shape function. As the 
CMUTs in [8] were modeled as piston radiators, the model 
lacks sufficient accuracy. The authors in [9] presented a 
generalized model for surface acoustic wave devices 
considering the mass and viscous fluid loading. The authors 
presented the frequency and phase changes occurring when 
the device is operated in immersion and the dependence of 
the frequency drift on the fluid properties was included to 
analyze the fluid loading effect. Numerical modeling of fluid 
interaction with oscillating surfaces is available in [10] from 
which reduced order models depicting the fluid interaction 
were developed based on the effective fluid volume, 
effective area of shear wave interaction, and effective length 
of viscous interaction. The sensitivity of CMUT equivalent 
circuit parameters to the fluid properties was investigated in 
[11], where a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device was

designed for sensing the fluid properties like mass density 
and viscosity. The phenomenon of drift in frequency of 
CMUTs operated in immersion or in contact with a fluid 
medium has been exploited to develop various biological and 
chemical sensing devices [12]–[17]. 
In this perspective, this paper presents a method to 
compensate the resonant frequency drift of a CMUT due to 
fluid loading by dynamically adjusting the DC bias voltage. 
The scientific basis of the proposed method lies in the spring 
softening effect associated with the DC bias voltage applied 
to a CMUT. Due to an applied DC bias, necessary for 
CMUT operation in both transmit and receive modes, the 
effective stiffness of the diaphragm reduces to lower the 
resonant frequency. As the amount of spring softening 
(lowering of the stiffness) depends on the DC bias, the DC 
bias voltage can be dynamically controlled using a suitable 
microelectronic circuit to adjust the spring softening amount 
to offset the effect of fluid loading on the resonant 
frequency. Excellent agreements between lumped element 
model analysis and 3D electromechanical finite element 
analysis conducted by the authors show that the method can 
effectively offset the resonant frequency drift due to fluid 
loading to validate the hypothesis. A microelectronics based 
compensation scheme to implement the proposed hypothesis 
has been designed and simulated using MATLAB and 
Simulink. The simulation results validate the efficacy of the 
proposed method, thereby proving the hypothesis. 
The rest of the paper has been organized in the 
following manner: Section II provides the problem statement 
and theoretical background of the proposed approach, 
Section III investigates the effect of fluid loading on CMUT 
resonant frequency in different fluids, Section IV presents 
the proposed frequency drift compensation method with 
simulation results of analytical and FEA analysis using 
COMSOL, Section V presents the design of microelectronics 
based compensation scheme along with simulation results 
and finally, Section VI provides the concluding remarks. 
II. 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
A CMUT array is comprised of several transmit and 
receive elements as shown in Figure 1(a). Each element in 
turn is designed to have several CMUT cells connected in 
parallel [10][18]–[21]. A conceptual cross-section of a 
typical CMUT cell is shown in Figure 1(b). 
Assuming the CMUT as a lumped element mass-spring-
dashpot system with a linear spring constant, the resonant 
frequency of the CMUT in air can be calculated following

where, k and m are the spring constant (stiffness) and mass 
of the CMUT diaphragm as shown in Figure 1(b), 
respectively.  
The array pitch, defined as the distance between 
corresponding points in the neighboring elements (Figure

sampling as expressed in (2) to minimize grating lobes.

In (2),   is the wavelength corresponding to the center 
frequency of operation.  
The frequency response of a CMUT cell with and 
without the fluid loading effect can be obtained using the 
Butterworth-Van Dyke (BVD) model as shown in Figure 2.  
[22]. The BVD model depicts an analog electrical equivalent 
circuit of a CMUT that includes both electrical and 
equivalent mechanical lumped element circuit parameters.

The inclusion of these additional mass and damping

On the other hand, assuming the small-signal model of a 
CMUT where the AC actuation signal is much smaller 
compared to the DC bias voltage (

back to its design value while generating the desired acoustic 
outputs.

INVESTIGATION OF FLUID LOADING EFFECTS 
To investigate the proposed approach, a linear CMUT 
array with a center frequency of 6 MHz has been 
considered. This center frequency is suitable for cardiac 
diagnostic imaging as reported in [25]. 
A. Analytical CMUT Resonant Frequency Calculation 
with Fluid Loading Effects 
Individual CMUT cells in the array have been designed 
to have the same resonant frequency as the array [26]. The 
element pitch p  has been selected following (2) to satisfy 
the Nyquist criteria of spatial sampling to obtain better 
directivity with minimum side lobes. The lateral and axial 
resolutions of the CMUT array are given by [2] as:

respectively, where 
Aa,
,S  and n  are the array aperture, the 
distance between the focus and the array surface at the center 
of the array, and the number of scanning pulses, respectively. 
Following (12) and (13), it is necessary for the CMUT and 
the array physical dimensions to correspond to the same 
wavelength or center frequency to achieve setpoint axial and 
lateral resolutions and avoid any deviation from Nyquist 
criteria of spatial sampling [27][28]. 
To investigate the effects of viscosity and density of the 
fluidic medium on the resonant frequency of the CMUT 
diaphragms, a square shaped CMUT diaphragm with the 
same 6 MHz center frequency in air as for the array has been 
investigated.  
Typical CMUT diaphragms are fabricated as a multilayer 
laminate where a thin insulating material is used as the 
structural layer to provide the necessary mechanical strength 
and a thin conducting layer is used on the top of the 
structural layer to act as the top electrode.  
Following [27], bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) has been 
used as the structural layer for this analysis. The BCB layer 
is coated with a thin layer of gold to form the top electrode. 
Low resistivity silicon has been used to constitute the bottom 
electrode (ground). BCB has also been used to fabricate the 
dielectric support posts. The major physical properties of the 
selected CMUT materials are listed in Table I.

A CMUT cell has been designed using the materials 
listed in Table I to obtain the target 6 MHz resonant 
frequency in air. The design incorporates the electrostatic 
spring softening effect due to the bias voltage. Analytical and 
3D electromechanical FEA methods were used to optimize 
the geometric dimensions as listed in Table II.  
The drift in resonant frequency due to the spring 
softening effect as given by (9) and (10) is shown in Figure 
4. The pull-in voltage of the CMUT has been determined 
from 3D electromechanical FEA using COMSOL as 395 
volts. The frequency responses of the CMUT biased at 
294.75 volts (74.68% of the pull-in voltage) in air, water, 
engine oil, and glycerol are shown in Figure 5. The physical 
properties of the fluids are listed in Table III.  
The frequency response in air without any DC bias 
voltage has also been shown in Figure 5. As it can be seen, 
there is a significant drift in the resonant frequency due to

B. 3D FEA Based CMUT Resonant Frequency Simulation 
with Fluid Loading Effects 
A 3D FEA of a single CMUT cell was conducted in 
COMSOL Multiphysics environment to investigate the fluid 
loading effects on the frequency response of the CMUT cell. 
The cell was modeled using the electro-mechanical module 
as shown in Figure 6. The air/fluid column was designed 
using the pressure acoustics frequency domain physics 
module.  
The CMUT diaphragm was set as a linear elastic 
material. The boundary between the electro-mechanics and 
pressure acoustics domain was defined as a fluid-solid 
coupled boundary that acts as a pressure load on the electro-
mechanics domain. The maximum element size was set to 
one-sixth of the smallest wavelength in a frequency sweep 
while meshing. An AC perturbation signal superimposed 
with DC bias voltage was applied to the CMUT cell using 
the default frequency domain modal analysis method in 
COMSOL. 
The COMSOL based 3D FEA generated modal 
frequency responses of the CMUT model for the fluids listed 
in Table III are shown in Figure 7. Table IV compares the 
analytical and 3D FEA results for the resonant frequencies of 
the CMUT in the investigated fluids. As Table IV reveals, 
the analytical and 3D FEA results are in excellent agreement 
with a maximum deviation of 2.8% for the liquids that 
validate the efficacy of the analytical and simulation 
methods.

COMPENSATING THE FLUID LOADING EFFECTS 
Investigation by the authors reveals that the resonant 
frequency drift due to the fluid loading effect can be 
compensated effectively if it is possible to offset the effects 
of fluid loading by dynamically adjusting the DC bias 
voltage following (9) and (11). Precisely, the spring 
softening parameter 
ksoft
 as expressed in (9) needs to be 
dynamically adjusted by adjusting the bias voltage 
VDC,
 to 
offset the fluid loading induced resonant frequency drift f
  
expressed in (14).

Figures 8-10 compare uncompensated (red) and DC bias 
compensated (black) frequency responses of the CMUT 
when operated in different fluidic media. From the figures, it 
is clear that a slight adjustment of the DC bias, (e.g., 0.75 VPI 
to 0.68 VPI for glycerol) is sufficient to alter the electrostatic 
spring softening parameter to offset the resonant frequency 
drift due to the mass loading.  
COMSOL based 3D FEA simulation results after 
adjusting the bias voltage to offset the resonant frequency 
drift 
f
  for water, engine oil, and glycerol are shown in 
Figures 11-13. The reference bias voltage was kept at 75%, 
of the pull-in voltage 
PI
V  of the CMUT structure as in the 
Section III. When the CMUT was operated in water, engine 
oil, and glycerol, the change in bias voltage applied was 2%, 
4.2%, and 9%, respectively. The simulation results confirm 
that the drift f
 in the resonant frequency can effectively be 
compensated by a small change in the DC bias 
VDC
 to 
validate the hypothesis. 
The improvement in the lateral and axial resolution that 
could be achieved with the proposed method is 4%, 10.78%, 
20.74% when operated in water, engine oil, or glycerol, 
respectively. Thus, the proposed method helps to achieve the 
expected resolution even when the array is operated in 
different fluidic mediums, thereby improving the imaging 
accuracy of a CMUT array.

COMPENSATION SCHEME IMPLEMENTATION 
An implementation method as shown in Figure 14 to 
realize the proposed compensation scheme has been 
developed and simulated using a  Simulink based model. The 
model incorporates commercially available analog-to-digital 
converters (ADC), fast Fourier transform (FFT) modules, 
and bandpass filters among others, to dynamically determine 
the drift amount and apply necessary compensation to 
stabilize the center frequency using a digital signal 
processing (DSP) based algorithm. 
A. Implementation Strategy 
The actual drift amount in the resonant frequency of a 
CMUT during an array operation can be determined by 
comparing the center frequencies of the transmitted and the

received signals. While the center frequency of the 
transmitted signal can easily be extracted from the excitation 
AC signal applied to the CMUT, appropriate conditioning of 
the received signal is necessary to extract the center 
frequency component of the received signal. Accordingly, a 
bandpass filter is necessary to signal-condition the received 
signal before converting to frequency domain. To extract the 
center frequencies, the AC excitation signal and the filtered 
received signal are digitized using high-speed analog-to-
digital converters (ADC) with a suitable sampling rate.  
The time-domain digitized signals are then transformed 
into frequency domain using fast Fourier transforms (FFT) to 
obtain center frequencies in both signals (
fres-ss
 and 
fres-ss-fl
 in 
Figure 14). A comparator then compares 
fres-ss
 and 
fres-ss-fl
 to 
determine the frequency drift f
  in real time.  
The mass 
f
m  of the loaded fluidic layer is then extracted 
from f
 using (10) and (11) as the other parameters in (10) 
and (11) are already known. The compensation scheme then 
calculates a modified effective stiffness

effects of 
f

B. Scheme Validation 
The proposed scheme as shown in Figure 14 was 
implemented and simulated in MATLAB and Simulink. 
First, a bandpass filter was used to remove the noise from the 
received signal. Next, both the AC excitation signal and the 
filtered received signal are sampled at a frequency, 
sampling

(15 MHz for the designed 6 MHz array) to 
digitize them. The digitized signals are then fast Fourier 
transformed to extract the frequency components. The 
spectra of the digitized signals after performing FFT for 
operation in water are compared in Figure 15. Similarly, the 
spectra of the digitized signals after performing FFT for 
operation in engine oil and glycerol are compared in Figures 
16-17, respectively. The drift in center frequency due to fluid 
loading is clearly visible in the figures with higher density 
and viscosity medium (glycerol) showing higher drift 
compared to lower density and viscosity medium (water).

Figure 16.  FFT of the filtered received signal when operated in engine oil. 
 
Figure 17.  FFT of the filtered received signal when operated in glycerol. 
Based on the magnitude of drift in center frequency, a 
modified DC bias voltage 
DC
V   is then calculated for each 
case following (14) – (16) to adjust the spring softening 
parameter to offset the fluid loading effect. The spectra of 
the filtered and digitized received signals with 
DC
V 
 after 
FFT are shown in Figure 18.  for all three cases along with 
the spectra of the transmit AC signal. As it can be seen, the 
adjustment of the DC bias compensates the frequency drift as 
expected.  
 
The amount of 
DC
V  in different fluidic media is different 
corresponding to the different amount of drift in different 
fluidic media. TABLE V. compares MATLAB and Simulink 
predicted 
DC

following the proposed scheme with the 
uncompensated DC bias

 for different fluidic media. 
Similarly, 
DC
V 
 obtained from 3D FEA simulation in 
COMSOL are compared in Table VI with uncompensated 
DC bias for different fluidic media.  
 
The tables show that the variations in DC bias are very 
small to minimally affect the target acoustic pressure. 
Furthermore, Tables V and VI show that the analytical 
results obtained from the simulated scheme in Matlab and 
Simulink are in excellent agreement with 3D FEA results to 
validate the implementation scheme.

CONCLUSION  
Microelectronic and digital signal processing techniques 
have been used to compensate fluid loading induced resonant 
frequency drift of a CMUT by dynamically adjusting the DC 
bias voltage. Analytical and 3D FEA based simulation 
studies revealed that the magnitude of DC bias voltage 
adjustment is small and is not expected to affect the acoustic 
power/pressure output of a CMUT array while improving 
lateral and axial resolution. The investigation shows that the 
method can improve the lateral and axial resolutions in water 
by approximately 4% to improve the accuracy of CMUT 
based biomedical diagnostic imaging. For NDE applications, 
the axial and lateral resolution improvements can be as high 
as 20.74% when glycerol is used as the coupling agent.  
MATLAB and Simulink based simulation of the 
proposed scheme shows that commercially available high-
speed data converters and digital signal processing (DSP) 
integrated circuits can be used to determine the frequency 
drift using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the digitized 
transmit and the processed received signal. A DSP based 
controller can then dynamically compute and apply the 
modified DC bias to offset the frequency drift. High-speed 
signal processing components are necessary to minimize the 
latency time. The compensation scheme will be realized and 
tested once necessary funding is available.
