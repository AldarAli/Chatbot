Abstract— In this paper, a design approach for gm-C complex 
filter for intermediate frequency (IF) is formalized. It is based 
on decoupled first order gm-C sections, each one centered at a 
different frequency with respect to the others that can be 
stacked in series to get the final band pass filter response, with 
order equal to the number of stages.  A simple case with two 
stages is presented to show selectivity improvement when 
difference between the two center-bands increase, with ripple 
increase as drawback. An optimal setup with good selectivity 
increment and still zero ripple (flat pass-band) is also shown. 
Then, the approach is extended to third order. The approach 
has been used for IF filtering in STMicroelectronics GNSS 
receivers, but it is applicable to other wireless receivers. 
Keywords- gm-C filter, complex filtering, low-IF receivers.

 INTRODUCTION  
The complex intermediate frequency (IF) filters have 
been proposed for radio frequency (RF) front-end (especially 
for the low-IF ones) for their characteristic of rejecting both 
out-of-band and image signals, due to their asymmetrical 
transferring function [1].  Several implementations have been 
disclosed in technical literature, such as [1]-[8], mainly based 
on active circuits, while related impairments has been also 
analyzed in [9] and the references therein. Amongst these 
implementations, it has been chosen the one based on 
decoupled first order stacked stages with operational trans-
conductor amplifier (OTA) and frequency shift of low-pass 
prototype. This choice presents lower current consumption, 
good response at high frequency and simple, reconfigurable, 
modular design [10].  
In the state-of-the-art implementation of gm-C multistage 
complex IF filter, each stage is centered on the same 
frequency with the same bandwidth, as in [1], [4] and [15] 
and the references therein. In this contribution, we formalize 
an approach considering different center frequency for each 
stage (and eventually different bandwidth). These center 
frequencies will be placed symmetrically around the center 
frequency of the final filter. This approach achieves better 
performances, especially in terms of out-of-band attenuation, 
image rejection and flatness in group delay response with 
lower current consumption (as shown in [10]). Moreover, it 
allows more freedom in shaping the filter frequency response 
for a given filter order. We adopted it in designing an IF 
filter for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) 
receivers described in [10]-[12]. 
Section II describes the complex IF filter architecture, as 
in [10]; Section III presents the proposed approach 
considering the second order complex filter case, providing 
equations for filter design, and comparing the behavior 
between coincident center and non-coincident center cases. 
Section IV gives a brief extension to third order, and the 
main conclusions are drawn in Section V. 
II. 
COMPLEX FILTER ARCHITECTURE 
Filter architecture is based on decoupled first order 
sections stacked in series to get the final band-pass filter 
order. Each single stage band-pass filter response is a 
frequency shifted version of a low-pass one, designed using 
active components with trans-conductors and capacitors (gm-
C or OTA-C). Fig. 1 shows the architecture used in [10]-[12] 
for the single-stage, where the first order low-pass frequency 
response is set by the OTA gm1 and capacitor C values, with 
bandwidth given by: fLP = (gm1/2πC). The structure with the 
gm2 OTA is a gyrator that creates a feedback between in-
phase (I) and quadrature (Q) branches performing the 
frequency shift of the low-pass prototype response, obtaining 
a band-pass centered at a frequency defined through gm2 and 
C values according to the formula: fcenter =(gm2/2πC). The 
transfer function can be obtained just putting the translation 
 jω→jω-jωcenter

with G = (gm3/gm1), where the third OTA, gm3, is used both to 
decouple each stage with the previous one and to provide a 
gain (as a free parameter).  
In [10], we performed several schematic level 
simulations for defining design parameters values as a better 
trade-off amongst requirements of bandwidth, in-band 
group-delay variation, image and out-of-band rejection. We 
considered a 3rd or 4th order filter comparing in detail two 
cases:

• stages with same center frequency and bandwidth; 
• stages with different center frequencies, same 
bandwidth. 
 
  
Figure 1.  Complex filter single-stage basic architecture.  
It was easily recognizable as the second case presents 
better performances, especially in terms of out-of-band 
attenuation, image rejection and flatness in group delay 
response. In fact, in [10], we have observed that, when all 
stages share the same center frequency, if wider bandwidth 
are needed with low-order filters, the properties of both out-
of-band and image rejection rapidly becomes not acceptable. 
On the contrary, the different center frequency configuration 
can achieve wider bandwidth while maintaining low-order IF 
filter with good rejection for both out-of-band and image 
signals. The drawback of this latter approach is that the 
implementation needs different gyrators, one for each stage, 
instead of only one type for all the stages. Once fixed the 
stages main parameters (fcenter, fLP and G), then gm1, gm2 and 
gm3 are fixed from the previous formulas and all the trans-
conductors can be designed. For the details of the circuit 
design and measurement results, see [10]-[12]. 
III. 
COMPLEX FILTER FORMALIZATION 
To formalize what has been observed both by simulation 
and by measurements on the implemented IF filters, it is 
better to take into account a simplified version with only two 
stages, obtaining a second order filter (but the approach and 
the conclusions can be straightforwardly extended to higher 
order complex analog filters). In this case, the transfer 
function for two equal stages is

Considering the first case, we want to calculate, also for 
non-coincident center, the single stage low-pass normalized

the two-stage filter. In general, we obtain a different value

we found the previous value

; when ωd 
increases then 
o
ω′ decreases: this means that each stage can 
have a narrower bandwidth for obtaining the desired 
resulting bandwidth of the whole two-stage filter, that is a 
normalized value equal to 2. This lead to higher slope of the 
out-of-band response, that is higher out-of-band attenuation 
with the same bandwidth, so it is possible to obtain a more 
selective filter. Just to make an example, choosing ωd =0.7, 
we obtain

In order to evaluate the selectivity improvement, the out-

cases, e.g. in ωc+10. For not coincident case from (15), 
substituting ωd=0.7 and 
ω′o = .1 0194

ωd =1
, 
that means when the center frequency separation of the two 
stage is equal to the bandwidth of the whole filter. In this 
point the 
o
ω′ required is zero, so it is only a theoretical limit. 
The second part for 
ωd >1
, that is center frequency 
separation of the two stages greater than the bandwidth of the 
whole filter, lacks of interest because the response of each 
stage is completely separated from the other, so not useful to 
obtain an appropriate overall pass-band response. 
Returning to the range 
1
2
1
<
≤
ωd
 in (23), as noted 
before, the decreasing characteristic of 
o
ω′ suggests more 
selective behavior for higher ωd; further, the presence of two 
peaks, as formalized in (11), (12) and (13), means presence 
of in-band ripple: when ωd increases, the minimum in ωc 
becomes lower and the ripple increases. It is important to 
check when ripple is too big. 
If the difference between maximum and minimum 
becomes greater than 3dB then we can consider the response 
completely separated into two distinct lobes, non-acceptable 
as band-pass characteristic. The limit of the center 
frequencies separation 
d
ω  that still gives us a unique filter 
band is given for ripple equal to 3dB, that is:

Figure 5.  Plot of Eq. 26, for the allowed values of ωd.  
So, choosing  = 1 √2  
⁄
 gives the resulting filter with 
higher selectivity and no ripple; if we can accept ripple, we 
can choose a greater value of ωd in the range 
1 √2 ≤  ≤ 0.77679
⁄
. In particular we can choose values 
nearer to 0.77679 for better selectivity despite of worse 
ripple. If for example we choose ωd = 0.77 from (23), ‘-’ 
case, we have 
 = 0.3389, very low compared with the 
one of the best values we can have for  < 
 , for example 
for ωd =0.7 from (16) we already found 
 = 1.0194 ≫
0.3389; in this way, with so low 
 , we have much more 
selectivity. If we compare it with the coincident center case, 
the 
difference 
is 
even 
bigger 
(from 
(9) 
it 
was 
1.554>>0.3389). Evaluating the attenuation in the same out-
of-band frequencies used in the examples in all the previous 
cases we obtain the values in Table I. 
Another interesting example can be considered for the 
“optimum” 
setup 
that 
gives 
maximum 
out-of-band 
attenuation with still zero ripple. As already discussed, it is 
for  = 1 √2  
⁄
in  ≥ 
  case, and for about ωd =0.7596 
in  < 
 case. The values of 
 are 1 √2
⁄
 and 0.7622 
respectively, while the related attenuations for ωc+3 and

case. For three stages with normalized centers, respectively, 
in ωc1, ωc2 and ωc the transferring function is

 and developing denominator in

 =

Maximum and minimum values will be related to 
minimum and maximum values of denominator in (30). So, 
let us consider the derivate of the denominator with respect 
to x equating it to zero (defining for which x there could be 
maximum and minimum values): 
 
623 + 42&3
. − 2

The first solution is x=0 => ωn=ωc; other solutions from:

setting x2=y, solution of (32) has the following expressions: 
 
87,. = −

Solutions (33) are real for 
. ≥ 12
.. If this last holds, 
these are acceptable solutions for x if and only if y1,2≥0. In 
this latter case, both solutions are non-negative; so there are 
two couples of frequencies to be considered: 
0.7

. 
(34) 
On the contrary, if y1,2<0, there will be only one real 
solution for (33) and for ωn=ωc the transfer function present 
only a  maximum and no ripple: 
 
|<|. =
$ =
# $()
$*
$ . 
(35) 
Considering y1,2≥0 for the frequencies in (34), the transfer 
function presents more solutions. In this case, we can have 
three maxima (one always from (35)) and two minima, and 
ripple will be present as in Fig. 6.  
 
Figure 6.  Third order complex filter transfer function (dot) and transfer 
function of each first order stage.  
For this case, we have to verify both that ωn=ωc+1 is cut-
off frequency and the in-band ripple; imposing the maximum 
value for this last parameter in order to verify if there are 
acceptable solutions for ω0 and ωd. For instance, for ω?
. =
12ω
.  the ripple is not acceptable. Moreover, it can be 
observed that the selectivity increases as a function of ωd. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
We have described an approach for multistage complex 
IF filter design able to reach a good tradeoff between in-band 
ripple and rejection of both out-of-band and image frequency 
using different center frequencies in each stage, also 
choosing properly their bandwidths. Formulas are also 
provided for the filter design in the two stages case, 
obtaining the desired selectivity and ripple just choosing the 
bandwidth and the center frequency of each stage. We have 
also briefly described the third order case and extension to 
higher order is quite straightforward. We have adopted this 
approach for IF filter design in STMicroelectronics GNSS 
receiver, [10]-[12].  
Future work could be the extension of the proposed 
approach to design filter where each stage shows different 
order, bandwidth and center frequency asymmetrically 
placed respect to the center of the passband.
