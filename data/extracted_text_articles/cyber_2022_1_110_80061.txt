Abstract— Black Swan situations and their consequences 
are considered extremely unlikely before they happen and 
make perfect sense afterwards. Two malicious exploits that 
triggered Black Swan situations, Emotet and WannaCry, are 
assessed, along with their attack sequences comprising of 
multiple attack vectors operating in sequence and targeted at 
known vulnerabilities. The early warning signs and the 
practical actions to prevent these types of Cyber Black Swan 
situations are outlined. Prevention is based on practical 
defence in depth controls, along with effective ongoing 
maintenance, with situational awareness guiding the cyber 
teams as to where to focus their response efforts.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
As an Australian, the notion of a Black Swan as an 
unexpected event is counter intuitive. While the swans in 
Europe may be white, in Australia the native swans are 
black. In a country of jumping kangaroos and duck-billed 
platypus, the unexpected is modus operandi. In his book: 
“Antifragility, things that gain from disorder,” Nassim Taleb 
[41] uses the term Black Swan to describe unexpected 
situations with 3 attributes: Before the situation occurs, it is 
considered extremely unlikely, if not impossible; When it 
occurs its consequences are significant, either in changing 
belief, or in consequence; After it has occurred, it makes 
perfect sense as something that could happen [14][41].  
With Australian insight it becomes clear that unusual 
creatures and events do not just suddenly appear, they 
evolve over time. Similarly, Black Swan situations develop 
over time and show early warning indicators. Noticing these 
early signs, and acting upon them, will make the difference 
between a dramatic event, a well-managed situation, or just 
another day doing business. The proposed mitigation on 
these Black Swans is based on situational awareness, basic, 
practical, and well-maintained cyber controls, and response 
to emergency situations.  
Two black swan cyber situations, the Emotet Trojan, 
and the WannaCry Worm, are reviewed along with their 
attack vectors and the vulnerabilities they target. These two 
cyber attacks that triggered Black Swan situations were 
selected due to their scale and impact, which in turn can be 
attributed primarily to the preparation and response of the 
target organisations. These attacks differed in their initial 
access approach, their style of attack, and the combinations 
of attack vectors they utilised [4][36]. For each of these 
black swan cyber situations, the potential for predictability 
and reduced impact through stringent maintenance and 
monitoring, situational awareness, and response to early 
warning indicators is assessed.  
Section 2 outlines the Emotet and WannaCry exploits 
and their respective impacts. Section 3 analyses their attack 
sequences for access, escalation, persistence, scanning, 
spread, exfiltration, and assault [43]. Section 4 looks at how 
these events could have been foreseen by reading the early 
warning indicators. Section 5 outlines how these attacks and 
others like them can be mitigated using practical cyber 
defence in depth with effective ongoing maintenance, 
situational awareness, and timely response.  
 
II.  EMOTET AND WANNACRY EXPLOITS AND THEIR IMPACTS 
Over the last decade two of the most successful cyber 
attacks, in terms of scale and impact, have been Emotet and 
WannaCry. Both utilised a combination of exploits to target 
Microsoft vulnerabilities and gain access to organisations, 
establish persistence, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate data 
whilst concurrently spreading, infecting, and implementing 
assault strategies across the network [4][5][16][20][27] 
[33][34][37]-[40]. 
Emotet started as a banking Trojan and has continued 
to evolve since it was first identified in 2014. In 2019, 
Emotet was responsible for approximately 60% of malware 
email spam [36]. By 2020 it had morphed into Botnet as a 
Service 
with 
global 
distribution. 
Infected 
devices 
themselves become C2 bots. In May 2019, 310 unique 
infected IP addresses were identified, of which two thirds 
(208) were confirmed bots, and 8% (17) of these were also 
infected with Trickbot [36] (see Figure 1). 
In January 2021, the German Bundeskriminalamt 
(BKA) federal police agency coordinated a combined effort 
of law enforcement agencies to shut down the global botnet 
of hundreds of Emotet servers [34]. The Trojan malware, or 
a copycat, returned in November 2021 and infected an 
estimated 1.2 million systems in 2022 [34].

addresses, June 2019 [36]. 
 
In May 2017, after infecting more than 300,000 
computers and crippling 150+ organisations worldwide. 
WannaCry was dubbed “the largest ransomware event in 
history.” The WannaCry ransomware attack was stopped by 
a MalwareTech cyber researcher [19] who identified a key 
design flaw and purchased the URL WannaCry referenced 
in its attack sequence (see Figure 2). 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Distribution of WannaCry infections  
14 May 2017, after 24 hours [5][19]. 
 
The situations triggered by WannaCry and Emotet could 
both be regarded as Black Swans. Each was considered 
extremely unlikely before they were experienced and 
identified. Each gained the attention of Europol and 
Eurojust due to their scale and the significant and costly 
consequences for those affected [34]. WannaCry brought 
the British NHS to a standstill [12], including the closure of 
public hospitals. Emotet was estimated as costing in excess 
of $1 million for every organisation it infected [4][34]. 
 
III.  ATTACK SEQUENCE ANALYSIS 
       While there are some commonalities in the zero-day 
exploits 
targeting 
Microsoft 
SMB 
remote 
control 
vulnerabilities, Emotet and WannaCry utilise different 
attack vectors in the infection process.   
A. Emotet access, escalation, persistence, scanning, 
spread, exfiltration, and assault 
Emotet utilises social engineering phishing campaigns 
to entice recipients to click on a link that downloads a 
macro-infected Microsoft office file. These emails appear to 
come from a friend or colleague, or from a known 
organisation 
and 
include 
PayPal 
receipts, 
shipping 
notifications, or “past-due” invoices [4] (see Figure 3). The 
macro executes the payload malware for the next stage 
where it establishes persistence using auto-start registry 
keys and services to embed a scheduled task at startup 
[4][33][34]. 
 
 
          Figure 3. Emotet malicious email Emotet [4]. 
 
Emotet spreads by extracting contact lists from 
infected users’ email accounts and using these to send 
phishing emails, so they will appear to come from a friend 
or colleague. Concurrently, Emotet spreads to systems 
across the network by enlisting a credential enumerator with 
service and bypass components. It utilises publicly available 
tools to recover passwords stored on: (i) the user’s system 
and external drives; (ii) web-browsers such as Google 
Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla etc.; and (iii) email 
providers such as Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail etc. 
It concurrently utilises a malicious-actor-developed 
spreader module that applies brute force with enriched 
password lists to move through the Windows Admin Shares. 
It uses these credentials to access accounts and copy itself to 
the ADMIN$ of other network hosts, before using Server 
Message Block (SMB) to schedule execution on these hosts. 
It locates writable share drives and infects the entire disk by 
writing the Emotet service component onto the network 
[4][33][34] (see Figure 4).

Figure 4. Emotet infection process [4]. 
 
 
      From 2016 Emotet incorporated a Trickbot banking 
trojan which evolved to exploit the Microsoft Windows 
SMBv1 and NBT Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities 
(CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0147), and the Windows 
SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-
0630, CVE-2019- 0633) [4][33]. The Trickbot is used to 
launch the malware payload, bypass Microsoft security 
measures, communicate with the command-and-control 
infrastructure, upload data and download DLL updates [33].  
B. WannaCry access, escalation, persistence, scanning, 
spread, exfiltration, and assault 
WannaCry identified its targets using EternalBlue to 
scan externally facing hosts across the internet where TCP 
ports 139 and 445 were open [42]. These ports are used to 
communicate using the SMB network protocol that enables 
remote code execution in MS Windows & sharing across 
networks [5][16][40].  
When it identified the Microsoft SMB Windows 
Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-
0144) and the Microsoft SMB Windows Server Remote 
Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0145) [39] which 
enabled remote code execution over SMB v1, EternalBlue 
then accessed the vulnerable target systems and installed the 
DoublePulsar exploit for persistence [5][20][27]. It 
continued to scan, access and replicate while it encrypted 
files and destroyed backups on every computer it infected: 
disrupting businesses by denying users access to their 
critical data [13][37]-[39]. It then displayed a ransomware 
image to the users of infected devices (see Figure 5).

IV.  PROACTIVELY LOOKING FOR THE EARLY WARNING 
INDICATORS 
Situational awareness is key to preventing malicious 
exploits developing into Black Swan situations. It enables 
organisations to notice the early warning signs and prepare 
for and respond to emerging situations. The early warning 
signs are there for Emotet and WannaCry, but they will only 
be noticed by those who actively seek them out. The early 
warning signs include: 
1. The current state of the organisation: 
a. 
The cyber-risk awareness of personnel, based 
on their click-rate on targeted phishing 
campaigns. 
b. The level of compliance with standards and 
guidelines for basic defence maintenance 
practices, 
including 
compliance 
to 
the 
Australian Signal Directorate’s Essential Eight 
cyber mitigations, in particular: the extent of 
unpatched 
Microsoft 
windows 
systems; 
privileged access management; ability to 
download macro-enabled email attachments; 
and availability of separately stored backup 
data [6].  
2. Critical vulnerability reports:  
a. 
Microsoft CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0145, 
& 
CVE-2017-0147 
vulnerability 
reports 
published in the Microsoft Vulnerability 
Update Guide on 14 March 2017 [22]-[24] and 
corresponding CVE reports [7]-[9] and NIST 
reports published on 16 March 2017 [28]-[30]. 
b. Microsoft CVE-2019-0630 & CVE-2019-0633 
vulnerability 
reports 
published 
in 
the 
Microsoft Vulnerability Update Guide on 12 
February 2019 [25][26] and corresponding 
CVE reports [10][11] and NIST reports 
published on 3 May 2019 [31][32].

3. Threat alerts and reports: 
a. 
Threat alerts and reports are readily available 
through research centres such as MalwareTech 
[19], Metasploit [15], and Talos [17]. 
b. Cyber teams in peer organisations sharing 
information. 
Organisations, 
such 
as 
the 
Australian Banks, openly share information in 
a joint effort to fight cyber crime. 
V.  PREVENTING THESE BLACK SWAN SITUATIONS 
Emotet, WannaCry and similar trojan and worm-based 
malware exploits can be prevented, and/or their effects 
limited by applying basic cyber defence maintenance 
practices. 
1. Address the weakest link. Educate all people in the 
organisation on the risks and indicators of cyber 
exploits, such as emails with links and attachments. 
Educate people to not click on links and to run their 
mouse over to see where it links to, even if the email 
comes from a trusted colleague or friend. Educate 
them to not click on online advertisements, and to 
never 
share 
unencrypted 
sensitive 
information 
through external email or on the phone [4][6]. 
2. Incorporate desired cyber practices into policies. 
For example, implement a policy requiring users to 
forward suspicious emails to the security team [4]. 
3. Control who accesses to what, when. Implement 
Privileged Access Management based on the principle 
of least privilege [6]. 
4. Maintain a technology defence barrier. Keep all 
operating system and application patching up-to-date, 
by applying tested patches and updates as a priority. 
In particular, apply critical patches within 48 hours. 
Five weeks prior to the main WannaCry attack, 
Microsoft had released updated CVE reports and 
emergency 
patches 
to 
the 
Windows 
SMB 
vulnerabilities that enabled WannaCry’s EternalBlue 
and DoublePulsar exploits [6].  
5. Set a Firewall rule to restrict inbound SMB 
communication 
between 
client 
systems, 
using 
Windows Group Policy Object, or if using a non-
windows host-based intrusion prevention system 
[HIPS], implement custom modifications for the 
control of client-to-client SMB communication [4].  
6. Using antivirus programs on clients and servers, with 
automatic updates of signatures and software will 
mitigate against many other malware exploits that are 
signature based [4][6]. 
7. Whitelist IP addresses and block suspicious and 
known malicious IP addresses at the firewall. Filter 
out emails with known malspam indicators, such as 
known malicious subject lines, by implementing 
filters at the email gateway [4][6]. 
8. Block or scan file attachments commonly associated 
with malware, such as .dll and .exe and those that 
include macros, as well as attachments that cannot be 
scanned by antivirus software, such as .zip files 
[4][6]. 
9. Disable macros and PowerShell to prevent macro 
driven PowerShell commands, such as those utilised 
by Emotet [4][6]. 
10. Implement Domain-Based Message Authentication, 
Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), a validation 
system that minimises spam emails by detecting email 
spoofing using Domain Name System (DNS) records 
and digital signatures [4]. 
11. Be prepared for the worst. Take daily backups for 
timely recovery and restoration of service to the 
business and its customers. Ensure these are stored on 
a separate network and restoration is tested regularly 
to prevent failure when restoration is really needed 
[1][2][4][6]. 
12. Maintain current situational awareness. Stay abreast 
of alerts and threat reports. 
13. Limit exposure of critical systems to zero-day 
exploits.Take vulnerable, critical systems off-line 
and/or restrict their external accessibility when a zero-
day exploit is underway. 
14. Apply emergency zero-day patches immediately. 
During the WannaCry event, Microsoft released 
emergency patches for out-of-support versions of MS 
Windows.  
VI.  CONCLUSION 
The Black Swan situations generated by the Emotet 
and WannaCry malicious exploits demonstrate the potential 
for preventing these situations from developing.  
Situational awareness enables organisations to notice 
the early warning signs, prepare for and respond to 
emerging vulnerabilities and threats. Preparation involves 
addressing the weakest link, privileged access management, 
maintaining a technical defence barrier and keeping reliable 
backups. Current situational awareness ensures the 
organisation can respond to zero-day exploits by limiting 
exposure of critical systems and immediately applying 
emergency patches to vulnerable systems.

The threat landscape is constantly changing and 
evolving, with new malicious actors entering the scene and 
malicious exploits being released into the wild that can 
easily be combined for increased effect. But the impact of 
these exploits is ultimately driven by the preparedness, 
situational 
awareness, 
and 
response 
of 
the 
target 
organisations.
