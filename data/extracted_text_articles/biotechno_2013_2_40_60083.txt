Abstract— For early detection of arteriosclerosis, the 
evaluation of endothelium function has attracted attention in 
recent years. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is the blood vessel 
dilation due to the smooth muscle relaxation, which is caused 
by the effect that the wall shear stress (WSS) on the 
endothelium induces the nitric oxide (NO) production. 
Therefore, for accurately evaluating the endothelial function, 
the quantitative %FMD and WSS must be measured 
simultaneously. In this study, with the aim of assessing the 
endothelium function accurately, a novel ultrasound system for 
simultaneous measurements of %FMD and quantitative WSS 
is presented. A feature of this system is to combine the %FMD 
and the WSS obtained by considering the ultrasonically-
estimated blood viscosity. The system performance was 
verified through in vitro experiment using bovine blood and in 
vivo measurement for healthy volunteers. These results 
revealed the effectiveness of developed system.

INTRODUCTION 
For early detection of arteriosclerosis, the evaluation of 
endothelium function has attracted attention in recent years. 
One method for evaluating endothelium function is the flow-
mediated dilation (FMD) measurement, as shown in Fig. 1(a). 
In the typical FMD measurement, blood vessel diameters 
dilating after avascularization during 5 minutes are measured 
(Fig. 1(c)), and compared with that before avascularization 
(resting phase; Fig. 1(b)). This dilating rate is referred to 
as %FMD, which is an evaluation index for the endothelium 
function. Here, one of stimulus sources for activating 
endothelium function is the wall shear stress (WSS). The 
WSS applied on the endothelium induces nitric oxide (NO) 
production, and the NO relaxes smooth muscle. Thus, the 
WSS is an important parameter for evaluating endothelium 
function. However, conventional equipments for the %FMD 
measurement measure only the blood vessel dilation. 
Therefore, for accurate evaluation of endothelial function, 
quantitative 
WSS 
and 
%FMD 
must 
be 
measured 
simultaneously. In this study, a novel ultrasonic evaluation 
system of endothelium function based on simultaneous 
measurements of %FMD and WSS is presented. The system 
performance was verified through in vitro experiment using 
bovine blood and in vivo measurement for healthy 
volunteers.

A DEVELOPED SYSTEM 
In the developed system, it is important to simultaneously 
measure the %FMD and WSS on the central sagittal section 
of blood vessel. Therefore, we used a H letter-typed 
ultrasound probe connected to the ultrasound diagnosis 
equipment (UNEXEF, UNEX, Japan), as shown in Fig. 2. 
This probe has center frequencies of 8 MHz for blood flow 
measurement and 10 MHz for vessel imaging and diameter 
measurement. Moreover, in order to identify the central 
sagittal section, three apertures for two short axis views and 
one sagittal view are mounted on the probe. By this 
configuration, precise positioning of the probe on the central 
sagittal section, and accurate measurements of %FMD and 
WSS are available. In the %FMD measurement, forearm 
artery parallel to the probe surface is often the target for 
measurement. Therefore, the oblique-incidence beam is 
available for blood flow measurement in the forearm artery, 
by using the beam steering technique. Here, the beam 
steering angle is fixed to 15 degrees. 
In 
the 
following 
subsections, 
methods 
for 
measuring %FMD and WSS are described. 
A. %FMD measurement 
Blood vessel diameter is detected as the inner diameter of 
blood vessel. Fig. 3 shows the echo signals from the vessel 
walls. Thus, the vessel walls can easily be detected as echoes 
with high intensity in the ultrasound image.  Therefore, by 
tracking the high intensity part, the temporal trend of blood 
vessel diameter can be measured and %FMD is calculated.

B. Wall shear stress measurement 
Shear stress is defined as a product of viscosity and shear 
rate. Therefore, the viscosity and shear rate are necessary for 
obtaining the quantitative shear stress. 
1) SV curve: Fig. 4 shows an example of shear rate-
viscosity (SV) curve in whole blood [1]. Since the whole 
blood is the non-Newtonian fluid, viscosity is higher in the 
lower range of shear rate and lower in the higher range of 
shear rate, as shown in Fig. 4. Although a set of methods for 
obtaining SV curve has presented in the past works [2-4], 
the methods are described briefly as follows. The 2-D 
velocity vector distribution is obtained by Doppler 
measurement and incompressible condition, and the 
viscosity coefficient is estimated by substituting the velocity 
vector distribution into the Navier-Stokes equations. In this 
methodology, non-Newtonian property of blood should be 
considered. First, to consider this property, intravascular 
area is divided into several ROIs. Next, in each ROI, 
kinematic viscosity coefficient is calculated, based on 
Navier-Stokes equations [2].

line indicates the maximum diameter after releasing avascularization.

Thirdly, in each ROI, shear rate is also calculated by 
spatially-differentiating the 2-D velocity vector distribution 
in blood flow [3]. Finally, shear stress is calculated in each 
ROI. Viscosity, shear rate and shear stress can be estimated 
by using only the 2-D velocity vector distribution in each 
ROI. Therefore, for gathering all ROIs, a SV curve is 
reconstructed [4]. 
2) Wall shear stress calculation using SV curve: The SV 
curve can be modeled as follows.

where

 indicates the wall shear rate (WSR), that is, the 
shear rate on the vessel wall. If α  and β  have already 
calculated by modeling the SV curve using viscosity and 
shear rate data in resting phase, the WSS trend can be 
calculated by measuring the only WSR 
ewall
. Therefore, the 
WSS can be obtained in real time, if Eq.(2) is used.

IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS 
Fig. 5 shows an in vitro experimental setup for verifying 
the system performance. Circulation system using silicone 
tube with a diameter of 4 mm was constructed. Mean 
velocity of flow is adjusted by a pump (31.6 cm/s). Fresh 
bovine blood with non-Newtonian property was circulated in 
the silicone tube at 37 degrees C. Hematocrit of the blood 
was 25 %.  
Fig. 6(a) shows the comparison between results of 
ultrasonic measurement and viscometer in the SV curve 
reconstructions. Both plots exhibited similar property. Fig. 
6(b) shows the comparison between the reference (true) 
shear stress and the measured shear stress. Here, the 
reference shear stress was obtained by multiplying viscosity 
by shear rate measured by the viscometer. 
As the result, the shear stress obtained by the developed 
system coincides well with that obtained by the viscometer.

IN VIVO MEASUREMENT 
As the next verification, in vivo measurements with the 
healthy male subjects were conducted. The echo data were 
acquired by using the developed system, and the temporal 
trends of blood vessel diameter and WSS were obtained. 
A. Protocol 
The measurement protocol is described as follows. 
The simultaneous trends of the vessel diameter and WSS 
were acquired during 10 seconds in resting phase, and then 
the trends were acquired during 5 minutes at the 
avascularization phase. Finally, the trends were acquired 
during about 2 minutes after releasing the avascularization. 
B. Results 
Fig. 7 shows the intravascular imaging of shear rate, 
viscosity, and shear stress, respectively. Fig. 7(a)-(c) indicate 
images in resting phase and Fig. 7(d)-(f) indicate images 
after releasing avascularization. While the shear rate exhibits 
the maximum values near the tube wall, the viscosity at the 
tube center shows the maximum value because the shear rate 
at the tube center is close to zero. In addition, obviously, the 
WSS after releasing avascularization is larger than that 
before avascularization. 
Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the examples of inner diameter 
and WSS trends, respectively. Left plots indicate the trends 
in resting phase, and right plots indicate the trends after 
releasing 
the 
avascularization. 
After 
releasing 
avascularization, the vessel diameter gradually expands and 
exhibits the maximum value after about 60 seconds in the 
post-avascularization phase. On the other hand, the WSS 
exhibits the maximum value immediately after releasing 
avascularization. 
In 
order 
to 
characterize 
these 
properties, 
the 
following %FMD and IRSS were introduced on a trial basis.

 indicates the difference between the mean

in the post-avascularization phase. The IRSS (Increasing rate 
of shear stress) means the ratio of the maximum value SSmax 
in the post-avascularization phase to the mean value SSrest in 
resting phase. 
The correlation between %FMD and IRSS for 4 subjects 
is presented in Fig. 9. High correlation between them was 
observed. Similarly, IR can also be calculated for mean 
velocity (MV), maximum velocity (MAXV), flow volume 
(FV), wall shear rate (WSR), and viscosity (VSC). Therefore, 
the result of each IR is also presented in Fig. 9. Based on this 
comparison, the highest correlation between the %FMD and 
WSS is suggested. Although this suggestion is still 
preliminary, it is expected that the quantitative WSS is 
available based on the SV curve in resting phase, and a 
quantitative evaluation of endothelial function is possible 
based on the relationship between the flow-mediated dilation 
and wall shear stress measured by the developed system.
