Abstract—This paper presents the results from combin-
ing Integrated Information and Computing System compo-
nents with classiﬁcation for the purpose of enabling multi-
disciplinary and dynamical use of information systems and
supercomputing resources for Archaeological Information Sys-
tems. The essential base are a ﬂexible collaboration frame-
work, suitable long-term documentation, structuring and clas-
siﬁcation of objects, computational algorithms, object rep-
resentations, and workﬂows as well as portable application
components like Active Source. Case studies of the successful
implementation of integration of archaeology and geosciences
information and facilitation for dynamical use of High End
Computing resources are discussed. The implementation shows
how the goal of integrating information and systems resources
and advanced scientiﬁc computing for multi-disciplinary appli-
cations from natural sciences and humanities can be achieved.

I. INTRODUCTION
In order to overcome many of the complex scientiﬁc
impediments in prominent disciplines we do need mighty
information systems but the more they are used for inter-
active use they show up needing capabilities for dynamical
computing. The studies and implementations of Integrated
Information and Computing Systems (IICS) have shown a
number of queuing aspects and challenges [1], [2]. In the
case if archaeological information systems needed for multi-
disciplinary investigation the motivation is the huge potential
of integrative beneﬁts and even more pressing that archives
are needed for multi-disciplinary records of prehistorical
and historical sites while context is often being changed or
destroyed by time and development. Besides the academic,
industrial, and business application scenarios in focus of the
GEXI collaborations [3] in order to integrate the necessary
computing facilities with these systems, on the technical
side the recent implementations for spatial control problems,
e.g., for wildﬁre control [4], integrating GIS, and parallel
computing are promising candidates for future support.
This paper is organised as follows. Section two introduces
with the complexity of required information and structure.
Section three shows the essential prerequisites for integrated
information and computing. Section four describes the basics
of Archaeological IICS. Section ﬁve discusses the imple-
mentation of the components: information sources, structure
and classiﬁcation, communication and computing. Section
six presents the system implementation in practice, with
various views from the components. Section seven evaluates
for the lessons learned and summarises conclusions and
future work.
II. INFORMATION AND STRUCTURE
It must be emphasised that the complexity of the ecosys-
tem of algorithms and disciplines necessary to achieve an in-
tegration of multi-disciplinary information and components
is by nature very high so besides the system components we
have not only to integrate unstructured but highly structured
data with a very complex information structure.
The overall information is widely distributed and it is
sometimes very difﬁcult and a long lasting challenge even to
get access to a few suitable information sources. The goal for
these ambitions is an integrated knowledge base for archae-
ological geophysics. Example data resources and methods
are [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. For all components
presented, the main information, data, and algorithms are
provided by the LX Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources [12].
Structuring information requires a hierarchical, multi-
lingual and already widely established classiﬁcation imple-
menting faceted analysis with enumerative scheme features,
allowing to build new classes by using relations and group-
ing. This is synonym to the Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation
(UDC) [13]. In multi-disciplinary object context a faceted
classiﬁcation does provide advantages over enumerative
concepts. Composition/decomposition and search strategies
do beneﬁt from faceted analysis. It is comprehensive, and
ﬂexible extendable. A classiﬁcation like UDC is necessarily
complex but it has proved to be the only means being able
to cope with classifying and referring to any kind of object.
III. INTEGRATED INFORMATION AND COMPUTING
The integration issues of information, communication,
and computing are well understood [1], [14], [15] from the
“collaboration house” (Figure 1) framework.

Collaboration house framework, integrating information and
scientiﬁc computing. Resources (blue), services (red), disciplines (green).
A. Collaboration and multi-disciplinary workﬂow
Based on the collaboration framework the IICS enables to
collaborate on disciplines, services, and resources and oper-
ational level. It allows disciplines to participate on multi-
disciplinary topics for building Information Systems and
to use scientiﬁc supercomputing resources for computing,
processing, and storage, even with interactive and dynamical
components [16]. The screenshot (Figure 2) illustrates some
features, as with Active Source, computed and ﬁltered views,
LX information, and aerial site photographs, e.g., from
Google Maps. Many general aspects of dynamical use of
information systems and scientiﬁc computing have been
analysed with the collaboration house case studies.
Figure 2.
Dynamical use of information systems and scientiﬁc computing.
B. Integrative and synergetic effects
With IICS we do have integrative as well as synergetic
effects from the participating disciplines. For example, the
Roman city of Altinum, next to Venice, Italy, would not have
been discovered without the combination of archaeological
information, aerial photographs, satellite images, and digital
terrain models [17]. Even in unorganised circumstances, like
with this discovery, the multidisciplinary cooperation can
lead to success. The more we need an integrated information
system approach for “disciplines on demand”. On the other
hand we have a synergetic effect with the same scenario of
archaeology and geosciences, too, the research does have
beneﬁts for archaeology and geosciences as the collection
of information from archaeological probing will help to
describe the underground, which is of immense importance
for the future of the area [18] and it’s attractiveness [19].
IV. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Anyway there should be a principle solution, considering
the hardware and software if so individually available, with-
out restructuring complex data all the time when migrating to
different architectures or to be prepared for future resources.
A. Archaeology and geosciences
So in case of Archaeological IICS, cultural heritage, and
geoscientiﬁc information, and computing systems, there is a
strong need for integration and documentation of different
data and information with advanced scientiﬁc computing,
e.g., but not limited to:
• Object, site, artifact, spatial, multi-medial, photographi-
cal, textual, properties, sources, referencial information.
• Landscape and environmental information, spatial, pho-
tographical information.
• Geophysical information, geological information.
• Event information.
Important aspects with all this information are the distribu-
tion analysis and spatial mapping. With dynamical informa-
tion systems for this scenario the components must enable
to weave n-dimensional topics in time, use archaeological
information in education, implement n-dimensional docu-
mentation, integrate sketch mapping, provide support by
multidisciplinary referencing and documentation, discovery
planning, structural analysis, multi-medial referencing.
B. Creating metadata for documentation and computing
It will need a number of metadata types, depending from
the variable type of content, describing all kind of relevant
information regarding the data and the use of this data.
Some important groups are category, source, batch-System,
OS version and implementation, libraries, information on
conversion, virtualisation environment, and automation. Cur-
rently only a few projects in some disciplines have worked
on long-term content issues [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].
Commonly only three categories are relevant to archae-
ological projects, project level metadata (e.g., keywords,
site, dates, project information, geodata), descriptive and
resource level metadata (e.g., comprehensive description,
documents, databases, geo-data), and ﬁle level metadata
(software, hardware, accompanying ﬁles). As we saw above,
from information science point of view this is by far not
sufﬁcient as there are, e.g., licensing and archiving restric-
tions, precision restrictions, network limitations, context of
37

environment, hardware, and software, hardware restrictions,
tools and library limitations and implementation speciﬁcs.
The long-term aspects for big heterogeneous data hold
very difﬁcult and complex challenges as big data storage
facilities, for users there are, e.g., free public access and
long-term operational issues, for context provisioning huge
amount of work have to be done, e.g., handling licensing,
archiving, context, hardware availability and many more.
V. IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPONENTS
A. Targets and means
The main target categories and means of information to be
addressed are interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, intercul-
tural, functional, application, and context information. The
main functional targets with IICS are integrative knowledge,
education, technological glue, linking isolated samples and
knowledge databases, language and transcription databases,
classiﬁed Points on Interest (POI), InfoPoints, multime-
dial information. The organisational means are commonly
grouped in disciplines, services, resources and operation.
B. Information sources
All media objects used here with components and views
are provided via the Archaeology Planet and Geoscience
Planet components [12]. The related information, all data,
and algorithm objects presented are copyright the LX
Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources [12]. It provides multi-
disciplinary information and data, e.g., for archaeology,
geophysics, geology, environmental sciences, geoscientiﬁc
processing, geoprocessing, Information Systems, philology,
informatics, computing, geoinformatics, cartography.
C. Information, structure and classiﬁcation
The following examples illustrate the retrieved object
information, media, and sources with examples for their
multi-disciplinary relations. The information is retrieved
from the LX Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources [12], [1], [25]
and categorised with means like UDC. Listing 1 shows an
excerpt of a LX object entry used with IICS. Listing 2 shows
a classiﬁcation set of UDC samples used with IICS.

Classiﬁcation set (UDC samples, excerpt).
The classiﬁcation deployed for documentation [26] must
be able to describe any object with any relation, structure,
and level of detail. Objects include any media, textual
documents, illustrations, photos, maps, videos, sound record-
ings, as well as realia, physical objects such as museum
objects. A suitable background classiﬁcation is, e.g., the
UDC. The objects use preliminary classiﬁcations for multi-
disciplinary content. Standardised operations with UDC are,
e.g., addition (“+”), consecutive extension (“/”), relation
(“:”), subgrouping (“[]”), non-UDC notation (“*”), alpha-
betic extension (“A-Z”), besides place, time, nationality,
language, form, and characteristics.
D. Communication and computing
The
central
component
groups
for
bringing
multi-
disciplinary information systems into practice are IICS and
documentation of objects, structure, and references. Listing 3
shows an example of a dynamical dataset from an Active
Source [16] component provisioning information services.

Batch and interactive features are integrated with Active
Source event management [16], e.g., allowing structure and
UDC based ﬁltering. Taking a look onto different batch and
scheduling environments one can see large differences in
capabilities, handling environments and architectures. In the
last years experiences have been gained in simple features
for different environments for High Throughput Computing
like Condor, workload schedulers like LoadLeveler and Grid
Engine, and batch environments like Moab / Torque.
VI. RESULTING IMPLEMENTATION IN PRACTICE
A. Scientiﬁc documentation
Scientiﬁc documentation is an essential part of a Uni-
versal IICS (UIICS), revealing associations and relations
and gaining new insight. Handling the available information
does provide transparent how puzzle pieces of a scientiﬁc
context do ﬁt, e.g., not only that terms like Bronze Age, Ice
Age, Stone Age are only regional but in quantity and quality
how the transitions and distributions in space and time are.
Information on objects, archiving, analysis, documentation,
38

sources and so on will be provided as available with the
dimension space. Besides the dynamical features the objects
carry information, e.g., references, links, tags, and activities.
B. Dimension space
The information matrix spans a multi-dimensional space
(Table I). It illustrates the multi-faceted topic dimension
containing important cognitive information for disciplines
and applications. Examples of multi-disciplinary information
in archaeological context are stony and mineral composition,
e.g., of dead freight or ballast in ship wrecks, mineral
material in teeth, ﬁngerprints of metals used in artifacts, and
genetic material of biological remains. Further there exists
a “vertical” multi-dimensional space to this information
matrix, carrying complementary information, e.g., color,
pattern, material, form, sound, letters, characters, writing,
and so on. The documentation can handle the holistic multi-
dimensional space, so we can ﬂatten the views with available
interfaces to three or four dimensional representations.

The dimensions are not layers in any way so it would
contradict to percept their documentation with integrated
systems in data or software layers. With these IICS we are
facing a multi-dimensional volume, like a multi-dimensional
“potato shapes”. Layer concepts are often used with car-
tographic or mapping applications but these products are
infeasible for handling complex cognitive context.
C. IICS dimension view
As with the structure the communication and compute
processes are getting resource intensive, the available storage
and compute resources are used with the IICS. The following
small example shows an excerpt of a tabulated dimension
view (Table II). The last column shows if an object is de-
posited on site (O) or distributed (D) and if additional media
is available and referenced. The table shows if a storage or
and additional compute request has been necessary for the
resulting object or media. Information is given if primarily
a storage request (S) for persistant media or a compute
request (C) deploying High End Computing resources is
dynamically used for creating the appropriate information.

E. Object space grouping
The objects are linked by relations in the n-dimensional
object space. The slices with a selected number of di-
mensions carry the common information, e.g., “Stone Age
ﬂint arrow heads” in a speciﬁc area. It is essential not to
sort objects into layers within a database-like structure. So
vectors and relations can help to represent their nature in
a more natural way. The views, even traditional layered
ones, are created from these by appropriate components.
The following ﬁgures illustrate structure and references for
collections, context, and integration of multi-disciplinary
information: museum topical collection (Figure 7), context
of amphores (Figure 8), and geology information (Figure 9).

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Structuring and classiﬁcation with LX and UDC support
have provided efﬁcient and economic means for using Infor-
mation System components and supercomputing resources.
With these the solution scales, e.g., regarding references,
resolution, and view arrangements. The concept can be
transferred to numerous applications in a very ﬂexible way.
The successful integration of IICS components and ad-
vanced scientiﬁc computing based on structured informa-
tion and faceted classiﬁcation of objects has provided a
very ﬂexible and extensible solution for the implementa-
tion of Archaeological Information Systems. It has been
demonstrated with the case studies that Archaeological
IICS can provide advanced multi-disciplinary information
as from archaeology and geosciences by means of High
End Computing resources. The basic architecture has been
created using the collaboration house framework, long-
term documentation and classiﬁcation of objects, ﬂexible
algorithms, workﬂows and Active Source components. For
future applications a kind of “tooth system” for long-term
documentation and algorithms for use with IICS and the
exploitation of supercomputing resources will be developed.
