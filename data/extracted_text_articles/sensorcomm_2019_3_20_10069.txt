Abstract—The soft-decision fusion scheme on sensor detection
in wireless sensor networks is able to improve the detection
performance on the ﬁnal decision made at the Fusion Center
(FC). In this paper, a bandwidth-efﬁcient transmission scheme
using the soft-decision fusion scheme is proposed for distributed
binary detection. In the scheme, the source coding is through
the quantization process, but the output of the quantizer is
analogously transmitted to the FC. In the FC, the Maximum-
a-Posteriori (MAP) fusion rule is adopted to make the ﬁnal
decision. The problem of huge channel bandwidth demand can
be avoided by using the considered data transmission scheme.
The proposed scheme is illustrated with numerical examples
highlighting its signiﬁcant improvement in error performance at
the FC as compared with the hard-decision scheme.
Keywords–Distributed detection; bandwidth efﬁciency; fusion
rule; wireless sensor networks.

INTRODUCTION
Distributed detection fusion using multiple sensors has a
lot of applications in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [1]
[2]. Conventionally, in the distributed parallel fusion network,
a phenomenon in a speciﬁed environment is ﬁrst observed by
a sensor, and a decision based on the observation is made
without exchanging the information with other local sensors.
Then, each sensor transmits a signal to the Fusion Center (FC),
where the ﬁnal decision is made.
In contrast to the binary local decision case [3], many
works have also studied the case of soft-decision fusion, in
which the sensor observation is divided into M regions, where
M is an arbitrary integer with M > 2 [4]–[11]. However, all
the works mentioned above assume that the information of soft
local decision is digitally transmitted to the FC, in which the
information of each quantization level is mapped to several
digital bits and the local quantizer output corresponding to the
received quantization level is then utilized by the FC to make
its ﬁnal decision. As opposed to the existing works mentioned
above, this study considers bandwidth-efﬁcient transmission
between the local sensors and FC in designing the soft-decision
fusion scheme on the sensor observation. Speciﬁcally, the
output of the quantizer is analogously transmitted to the FC.
In the FC, the Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) fusion rule is
adopted to make the ﬁnal decision. Hence, by the proposed
scheme, the problem of huge channel bandwidth demand can
be avoided.
In the proposed scheme, the detection on the phenomenon
is divided into M regions, where M is an arbitrary integer
with M ≥ 2. When the detection falls within a speciﬁc
region, a conditional mean is adopted as a representation of the
observation in the region. The goal of the proposed scheme is
to minimize the decision errors at the FC with the MAP fusion
rule via optimizing the region allocation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
ﬁrst depicts the proposed M-ary scheme for binary distributed
detection problem. Section III shows the error performance
of the M-ary scheme and its comparison with that of the
conventional hard-decision scheme. Section IV concludes this
work and discusses possible directions in the future.
II.
DESIGN OF SOFT-DECISION FUSION SCHEME
In a binary detection environment under binary hypothesis
H0 and H1 shown in Figure 1, assume a phenomenon A either
H0 : A = γ or H1 : A = −γ, where γ > 0, occurs symmet-
rically with equal prior probability P[H0] = P[H1] = 0.5.
L sensors observe the measurements generated from H0 or
H1 and the observation value by the l-th sensor is denoted
by Wl, where l = 1, . . . , L. Wl is independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) from sensor to sensor. Also, assume H0 :
Wl = γ+ηl; H1 : Wl = −γ+ηl, where ηl is a standard normal
random variable. The probability density function (PDF) of Wl
conditioned on H0 or H1 is fWl|H0(w) = e−(w−γ)2/2/
√
2π
or fWl|H1(w) = e−(w+γ)2/2/
√
2π. In the considered parallel
fusion networks, the l-th sensor makes its own decision X,
independent of all other nodes.
In this study, an M-ary source coding algorithm is
applied on the observation at each sensor, where Wl at
the l-th sensor is divided into M
equally spaced re-
gions, as shown in Figure 1. When M is even (M
=
2N), the 2N regions are I−N, I−(N−1), . . . , I−1, I1, . . . , IN,
and the (2N − 1) boundaries are −(N − 1)∆, −(N −
2)∆, . . . , −∆, 0, ∆, . . . , (N − 1)∆. ∆ is the width of each
region except for the two end regions I−N and IN. Similarly,
when M is odd (M = (2N + 1)), the 2N + 1 regions are
I−N, I−(N−1), . . . , I−1, I0, I1, . . . , IN, and the 2N boundaries
are −(N − 1
2)∆, −(N − 3
2)∆, . . . , − 1
2∆, 1
2∆, . . . , (N − 1
2)∆.
We deﬁne pn = P[Wl ∈ In|H0] = Q(dlow −γ)−Q(dup −γ),
where n = −N, −(N − 1), ..., N, dlow and dup denote the
lower and upper bounds of In, i.e., In = {Wl|dlow < Wl <
dup}, Q denotes the Q-function, and P denotes the probability
function. pn is the probability that Wl falls within region In
when H0 occurs. (dup − dlow) is ∆ except for I−N and IN,

symmetry, P[Wl ∈ In|H1] = P[Wl ∈ I−n|H0] = p−n.
M-level quantization X is applied on the observation
and X = xn is the representation value of the n-th region
In. At the l-th sensor, xn is deﬁned as the conditional
mean when Wl falls in In, i.e., xn = E[Wl|Wl ∈ In] =
P[H0]E[Wl|H0, Wl ∈ In] + P[H1]E[Wl|H1, Wl ∈ In]. From
symmetry, x−n = −xn and x0 = 0.

error rate Pe of the ﬁnal decision at the FC via varying ∆ to

Figure 2. Fusion performance of the proposed soft-decision fusion scheme
We conduct the performance comparison of the proposed
soft-decision scheme and the hard-decision scheme. Figure 2
illustrates Pe of the WSN under the proposed soft-decision
fusion scheme with γ = 1. As it can be seen, Pe is lower than
that of the hard-decision fusion system and is improved as M
increases. No signiﬁcant difference exists between M = 50
and M = 101. Furthermore, the ﬂooring of the curves is
observed at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is due to
the fact that the erroneous behavior of the transmitted signal
to the FC vanishes as SNR increases and hence the error
performance is from the decision made by each sensor only.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new M-ary scheme on the decentralized
detection in WSN using analog transmission is proposed and
examined. The problem of huge channel bandwidth demand
is avoided by using the considered M-ary scheme. The goal
of minimizing the decision errors at the FC via optimizing the
region allocation is achieved. The error performance of the M-
ary scheme is better than that of the hard-decision scheme. The
behavior of the M-ary scheme when the transmitted signal to
the FC is under a fading environment is open to further study.
