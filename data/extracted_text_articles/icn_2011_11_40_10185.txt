Abstract—The paper is focused on the design of a new
reconﬁgurable tactical UWB impulse radio enabling indoor
communication and localization for military application. The
proposed system contains both a physical and a MAC (Medium
Access Control) layer. It proposes to answer military needs
for information sharing and for indoor localization of infantry.
The physical layer is based on IR-UWB (Impulse Radio Ultra
WideBand). Its goal is to ensure communication and distance
evaluation between the transmitter and the receiver. IR-UWB
is necessary for constraints such as low power consumption,
reconﬁgurability, through the wall propagation, ﬁne resolution
localization, low probability of detection and interception. These
advantages come from the use of a very large bandwidth with
very short pulses. The digital baseband implementation of a
reconﬁgurable IR-UWB transceiver is based on a coherent Rake
receiver and on a parallel search acquisition. Its synchronization
accuracy is of 0.33 ns. This enables distance evaluation with
a precision of 10 cm. The MAC layer deals with the multi user
access and the positioning. TDMA is used for sharing the channel
between users. WiDeCS, a master-slave TOA (Time of Arrival)
cross layer mechanism is implemented for time synchronization.
This algorithm can also determine the Time of Flight of the
IR-UWB signal due to timestamps at the physical layer. This
algorithm followed by triangulation and-or angle of arrival
techniques leads to 3D positioning.

I. INTRODUCTION
Positioning the infantry units is a strategic issue on a
battleﬁeld. For many years, Global Positioning System (GPS)
has allowed teammates, as well as commanding ofﬁcers, to
know in real time the position of units taking part in a battle.
This tactical advantage, as a consequence, is lost in indoor
environments such as buildings, or caves. There is a need for
indoor positioning equipment for ad-hoc networks. Although
millimeter precision is not mandatory for such applications, a
position error under 50 cm is sufﬁcient in order to distinguish
a teammate and other persons. The main requirements are
• indoor capability and through the wall positioning
• a fast acquisition of teammates’ location
• a reliable tracking of moving partners
• a secure transmission channel hard to detect and to jam
• a communication channel for health monitoring
Recent researches have focused on a new way to localize team
members in indoor environments. Most of them require the
previous installation of reference base stations to locate units
in absolutes coordinates.
This work is focusing on the possibility for each unit
to obtain the location of every other unit in both direct
and indirect range. For that, a system based on Impulse
Radio Ultra Wide Band is proposed. The IR-UWB allows
an accurate timestamping of emitted and received packets.
Over this physical layer, we propose to use a Synchronization
and Localization protocol named WiDeCS[1]. WiDeCS uses
timestamping at physical level, coupled with two-way ranging
to obtain both the time reference offset, and the Time of Flight.
The use of Smart antenna allows to obtain an information
about the Angle of Arrival, and then determine the position of
every node in range by combining ToF information and Angle
of Arrival.
In the ﬁrst section, this paper proposes a possible system
using the proposed schemes for localization of moving units.
Related works on this subject are then overviewed. The
proposed system, and its two major parts - the physical layer,
and the MAC layer with synchronization and localization -
are detailed in a third part. The last part deals with theoretical
performances of the system.
II. POSSIBLE INTEGRATION AND OPERATIONAL SYSTEM
ASSEMBLY
The proposed system is based on the use of two techniques
to determine the position of the nodes in range.
A. Smart antenna for fast rough localization
The ﬁrst step towards a positioning of all the units is to
determine roughly the position of neighboring units by the
means of Time of Arrival and Angle of Arrival. This step has
the main advantage of giving a ﬁrst rough estimation to the
user.
B. Map generation
In the same time, an array of distances and directions is
computed with the help of WiDeCS and is stored inside
the MAC layer. The MAC layer shares the information of
distance between nodes with nodes in range. A map can then
be determined owing to these information and a trilateration
algorithm.
III. RELATED WORK
Indoor positioning is a challenging subject gathering re-
sources from all around the world. Rough localization has been
made possible in the case of widely used wireless networks

such as WiFi and Bluetooth. However, the achievable accuracy
is limited by a major drawback of these technologies, the use
of a narrow band, making event time stamping hard to improve
[2].
Recent advances on this subject have improved the spatial
resolution of positioning systems. Most of the proposed sys-
tems use Ultra Wide Band (UWB) transceivers. The UWB
technologies allow large band emission, which present fast
changes in the time domain. These events can be used for
measuring the Time of Arrival (ToA) or Time Differential of
Arrival (TDoA). UWB makes it possible to implement low
power and low complexity systems. The three most widely
spread methods for UWB localization are [3]:
• Triangulation uses one distance and 2 angle informations
to compute the position of a node when the 2 reference
base stations have known positions. Its advantages are
the small number of base stations necessary to determine
the position coupled with no necessary synchronization
between base stations. However, a high accuracy of the
measured Angle of Arrival (AoA) is necessary.
• Trilateration is a method similar to triangulation with
the difference that it uses a ratio between distances
measured relatively to at least three base stations. This
distance can be estimated from the ToA. However, a high
synchronization is required between all the stations.
• Multilateration is derived from trilateration. Instead of
using absolute ToA to determine the distance, the TDoA
allows to not synchronize the localized node with the base
stations. Those base stations, on the other side, still need
to be synchronized.
A rough estimation of the relative position can be determined
if an information of distance is coupled with the Angle of Ar-
rival. The Received Signal Strength (RSS)[4] helps determin-
ing the approximate distance owing to the knowledge of the
channel path loss. The other possible way to know the distance
is based on a ToA measurement. However, this technique’s
performances are linked to the synchronization performances.
UWB appears to be a solution to the ToA measurement issue.
For example, Clarke et al. compared commercially available
positioning systems based on different modulation (e.g. Wi-Fi,
signal strength, radio frequency (RF), ultrasound, and UWB)
[2]. Implementations based on IR-UWB have been proposed
in the literature. Rahmatollahi et al. [5] described a solution
using base stations coupled with IR-UWB. However, this
system cannot be used without a previous deployment. The
main challenge in such systems is to detect the shortest path
among all the multipath pulses. Indeed, the most important
pulse is not always the one carrying the greatest amount of
energy. Recent publication show propositions based on the
detection of the ﬁrst pulse to arrive in the receiver [6] The
proposed system embeds the localization protocol in every
node in order to localize the nodes relatively to each other
instead of positioning them relatively to a previously deployed
infrastructure. It is then possible to localize persons equipped
with such system even in the case of a ﬁrst visit of the indoor
environment.
A. System view
The localization system is based on a network communi-
cation stack. Each node must gather Time of Flight (ToF)
information regarding its data exchanges with the other nodes
and compile them in an array. This array is the utilized at
application layer to determine location of all the nodes. The
ﬁgure 1 shows an example of deployed system.

Operational use case
A smart antenna is placed on the helmet to cover all the
possible incoming directions. These antennas are connected
to multiple instances of the physical layer. The ﬁrst instance
detecting the pulses and decoding them is supposed to be
attached to the antenna pointed in the direction of the shortest
path between the transmitting node and the receiving node.
This shortest path is assumed to be the Line Of Sight path
owing to the through the wall propagation performances of
IR-UWB.
The physical layer used in this system is an Impulse Radio
Ultra Wide Band protocol. This protocol is based on the use
of short pulses spread over an ultra wide bandwidth. The
possible achievable synchronization is then directly linked to
the occupied bandwidth and the receiver resolution. Details
about the use of IR-UWB in such systems are given in a ﬁrst
time.
Once the physical layers are synchronized, it is then impor-
tant to synchronize the clocks of the discussing nodes in order
to determine the Time of Flight (ToF) as precisely as possible.
The WiDeCS synchronization scheme is used for this purpose
[1]. The MAC layer also computes the ToF calculations and
delivers them to the application dedicated to maintaining a
map of neighboring teammates.
B. Physical layer speciﬁcities
The proposed physical layer is based on IR-UWB (Impulse
Radio Ultra WideBand). Its goal is to ensure communi-
cation and distance evaluation between the transmitter and
the receiver. IR-UWB uses pulse modulation for transmitting
information. IR-UWB suits to constraints such as low power
consumption, reconﬁgurability, through the wall propagation,

ﬁne accuracy localization, multi users scalability, low proba-
bility of detection and interception [7]. In addition, IR-UWB
technique has a low probability of pulse collision enabling
the support of multi user scenario with low complexity MAC-
level mechanism. The use of very short impulse confers an
excellent behavior regarding the fading caused by multipath
in comparison with the classical narrow band techniques [8].
IR-UWB is a very promising technology for both low power
communication and localization thanks to the use of a very
large bandwidth with very short pulses[9]. The localization and
the synchronization accuracy directly depend on the occupied
bandwidth of the IR-UWB signal. This latter deﬁnes the
resolution of the receiver, which is equal to the inverse of
the occupied bandwidth. The ﬁner it is, the more precise the
synchronization and the localization are. Time of arrival (ToA)
localization techniques suits to IR-UWB features [9]. The
shorter the IR-UWB pulse is, and the better the localization
accuracy is. The goal of ToA is to evaluate the time of ﬂight of
the pulse between the transmitter and the receiver, by measur-
ing the time of arrival of the received pulse. Thus, the proposed
system is able to evaluate the distance between the transmitter
and the receiver. At this stage it is only a 1-D positioning.
For achieving ﬁne localization accuracy a ﬁne estimation of
the pulse time of arrival is needed, implying an efﬁcient
synchronization algorithm at the receiver. This performance
requirement is also need for achieving IR-UWB communica-
tion. The localization is a classic IR-UWB communication.
The better the IR-UWB communication performances are, the
better the IR-UWB localization performances are.
The UWB occupied bandwidth is large and the UWB
channel has a dense multipath behavior, these confer to the
synchronization task a high level of complexity [10][11]. The
receiver resolution is small and equal to the inverse of the
occupied bandwidth. The number of multipath components
resolved is then large. The short impulse duration, the large
space search and the low power UWB signal levels are implied
in the high complexity of the IR-UWB synchronization. An
efﬁcient synchronization technique has to be fast and precise
for, respectively, avoiding a large decrease of the signal to
noise ratio and decreasing its cost. The synchronization criteria
can be used for evaluating the localization technique. In IR-
UWB many multipath components can be seen as solution
of the synchronization even if they result from a NLOS
contribution. This can imply an error in the distance estimation
mechanism since a NLOS multipath is not directly linked to
the distance between the transmitter and the receiver.
The proposed IR-UWB receiver, assuring both communi-
cation and distance evaluation, is based on a coherent BPSK
Rake receiver and on a parallel search synchronization. The
proposed IR-UWB transceiver allows ﬁne localization at low
cost and low power. It achieves reconﬁgurable performances
in data rate, bit error rate, radio range, spectrum occupa-
tion, power consumption, synchronization accuracy, process-
ing gain, transmitted power and pulse duration [12]. This
reconﬁgurable behavior allows to efﬁciently fulﬁll the distinct
applications needs and the evolutions of the environment at the
best cost. [12] demonstrates that decreasing the synchroniza-
tion accuracy implies a decrease of the power consumption.
Thus in function of the localization accuracy requirement,
deﬁned by the application needs, the proposed reconﬁgurable
IR-UWB transceiver can adapt its power consumption for
increasing its life operating duration.
The synchronization technique used allows to determine the
ﬁrst multipath received. The proposed implementation of the
IR-UWB transceiver is described in ﬁg. 2. It is implemented
according to the mostly digital implementation thus the per-
formances directly depend on the digital to analog and analog
to digital converters (DAC and ADC).
By considering the ADC sampling frequency Fe, the achiev-
able synchronization accuracy ϵ, in seconds, of the receiver is
deﬁned by:
ϵ[s] = 1
Fs
(1)
The localization accuracy β, in meters, is obtained as follow:
β[m] = vUW B × ϵ

with a precision of β = 10cm. The information conveyed

Illustration of the 1-D positioning offered by IR-UWB transceivers.
3-D positioning high level algorithm must be used such as
triangulation, trilateration, or multilateration. The PHY layer
sends to the MAC layer two timestamps information. At the
transmitter side, the PHY layer warns the MAC layer when
the ﬁrst pulse containing information is sent. Whereas at the
receiver side, the PHY layer wars the MAC layer when it
detects the ﬁrst multipath component of the ﬁrst received pulse
of information. Even in case of NLOS communication the use
of the ﬁrst multipath component is required for reducing the
average distance estimation accuracy as illustrated in the ﬁgure
3.
C. MAC Layer and cross layering for distance evaluation
The MAC layer used for this system is based on a static
TDMA frame with pre-assigned slots which includes an im-
plementation of the Wireless Deterministic Clock Synchro-
nization (WiDeCS) scheme. WiDeCS is a protocol allowing
high performance synchronization in wireless sensor networks
while keeping a low power consumption.
The proposed synchronization protocol takes advantage
of the restrictions linked to the application to make strong
assumptions and simplify the development of both the MAC
layer and the synchronization protocol.
1) General description: The Wireless Deterministic Clock
Synchronization (WiDeCS) protocol is based on the planning
of transmissions, and the respect of this planning. It is designed
for propagating the master time reference of a star network to
all the slaves.

Latencies involved and ﬂag positioning for WiDeCS
For ﬁrst experiments, a Time Division Multiple Access
MAC layer is used. This MAC layer divides time in slots
attributed to the nodes. The ﬁgure 5 details sources of delays
in the network link. Delays are measured on the ﬁrst effective
bit (events linked to preambles and serialization have to be de-
embeded). Efforts have been made to place this time stamping
as close as possible to the effective channel, thus reducing
uncertainties on the characterization of the propagation time on
the channel. WiDeCS uses time stamping at the time of the ﬁrst
effective bit at the output of the PHY layer in emission, and the
238

ﬁrst effective bit in input of the PHY layer in reception. These
ﬂags then enable precise measurement of the propagation time
except for the jitter linked to RF front-ends. We name these
ﬂags TX ONGOING for the ﬁrst bit of effective data out of
the PHY transmitter, and RX ONGOING for the ﬁrst bit of
effective data entering the PHY receiver.
Owing to this MAC layer, each node of the network is sup-
posed to talk at precise moments. Measuring delays between
expected receiving times and actual ones helps determining
the clock offset and the propagation time. WiDeCS Synchro-
nization protocol uses possibilities relative to time division
to determine the clock offset between each node and the
master. The ﬁgure 6 shows the different informations gathered
on different sides, and sent to the slaves by the master. The

Exchange of timing information
complete synchronization is based on 2 steps.
Phase 1: Pre-synchronization
This step is performed by every slave when joining the
network.
The master has the same communicating hardware the
slaves have. The function of the master is to create a frame,
and regularly send a preamble of the TDMA frame. The slaves,
when reset, or desynchronized, switch to reception only mode,
and wait for the master node to indicate the beginning of the
frame. When this message is detected, the slave resets its
frame counter to a predeﬁned reset value in order to begin
transmitting data in the dedicated slot. When this step is
passed, the slave switches to phase 2 of the synchronization
process.
Phase 2: Fine-synchronization
Once pre-synchronized, the nodes have a clock offset of 1
µs compared to the master clock.
This step consists in determining the offset with the greatest
precision possible. When the slave is allowed to transmit data,
it does it at one precise moment ti of the slot. This date
is coded in the protocol and is known by every slave, and
more importantly by the master. Data is sent to the PHY layer
when t = ti and a capture of the timer is done when the
TX ONGOING ﬂag is set. ti is then subtracted to this date,
and the result is stored as δti. Note that small deltas (δ) are
used for delays in transmitted packets, whereas capital deltas
(∆) are for delays in received packets The following equations
can be deducted from ﬁg 6. The equation 3 represents the clock
offset correction applied to the slave node in WiDeCS scheme.
∆tclk = (∆ti + δtm) − (δti + ∆tm)
2
(3)
In the case of distance evaluation, the Time of Flight is
necessary to determine the distance between the nodes. The
variant equation 4 deducts this Time of Flight information
from the same captured deltas.
ToF = (∆ti − δtm) + (∆ti − δtm)
2
(4)
WiDeCS can be used in every frame to maintain a clock as
precisely synchronized as possible for all the length of the
measurements. Another possibility is to train the slave with
an optimal number of frames, and then turn the reception
module in sleep mode for as long as blindness is allowed
in the network.
Phase 3: Distance evaluation sharing As explained in
phase 2, WiDeCS scheme does estimate the distance only
between the paster and every slave. A modiﬁcation to this
scheme is then necessary to allow distance evaluation between
every node. This modiﬁcation consists in measuring every
delay between planed reception and effective reception of
every node’s packet. An array of such delays cans the be
integrated in every node’s packet in order to calculate the ToF
between all the nodes.
The equation 5 shows the information transmitted between
slaves
Θij = ∆tj − δti
(5)
where i is the node transmitting the Θij, and j the node whose
delays are spoken of.
2) Application speciﬁc improvements and simpliﬁcation:
Usually, a network is composed of nodes coming and leav-
ing the network. The number of nodes changes with time.
In the context described before, the network is planed and
parametrized before its deployment. Simpliﬁcations are then
allowed, without risking uncontrolled behavior. The simpliﬁ-
cations used in this paper are listed below, and reasons are
given for their existence.
• Fixed number of nodes per piconet and pre-programmed
time slots:
As we explained before, the network architecture is ﬁxed,
and planned before deployment of the team. The number
of nodes for each network is then decided upon the
number of persons to localize.
• No jamming between neighboring networks:
IR-UWB has a low pulse collision probability. The use
of directive smart antenna - implying Spatial Division
239

Multiple Access (SDMA) - reinforces this fact. This
modulation then allows multiple TDMA networks to exist
on the same frequency band. This is possible by the
means of a tradeoff between number of networks, and
each network’s data rate.
• Symmetrical links:
Every node of the network is fabricated using the same
hardware. Delays in RF front-ends are then similar from
one node to another.
IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM’S PERFORMANCES
The IR-UWB modulation is based on the emission of short
pulses covering an Ultra Wide frequency Bandwidth. These
short pulses are then a very precise means of getting the
information of when it left the transmitter, and when it entered
the receiver. Considering that the physical layer described
previously allows a synchronization with the ﬁrst received
pulse. The resulting ﬁrst pulse detected is then the one that
followed the shortest possible way from the transmitter to
the receiver. The proposed PHY layer uses a synchronization
technique not based on the acquisition of the highest energy
multipath component. This approach reduces the error due to
NLOS scenario. The proposed PHY layer in synchronized on
the ﬁrst viable multipath component assuring communication.
The proposed transceiver achieves reconﬁgurability in data
rate (from 4 to 125MBits/s), chip duration (from 8 to
32ns), pulse duration (from 1 to 4ns), bit duration (from 8
to 256ns), processing gain (from 1 to 8 pulses/bit), occupied
bandwidth, radio range, BER performance, synchronization
accuracy (from 0.33 to 2.64ns), transmitted power density,
duty cycle (from 3 to 50 %), power consumption, spectrum oc-
cupation, and maximum supported UWB channel delay spread
(from 4 to 31ns) [12]. These performances depend on the used
FPGA and DAC/ADC. In our implementation, a FPGA Virtex
4 is used and DAC/ADC at 3GSPS. Reconﬁgurability allows
to support a large range of operating scenarion with distincts
requirements.
WiDeCS scheme [1], on the other hand has reached syn-
chronization accuracies of 1 clock period in simulations, and
of 3 clock periods on a speciﬁc testbench. The deductible ac-
curacy for the synchronization is then ∆t = 0.33ns×3 = 1ns.
The distance evaluation accuracy is then of :
∆d = c × ∆t = 30cm in vacuum.
The Smart antenna adds an information of Angle of Arrival.
However, directional antennas often have radiation patterns
with main lobe’s angle above 15◦. The angle error is then
±7.5◦.
The localization performances are linked to the communi-
cation performances. The proposed system achieves a 30 cm
resolution 3-D positioning when using triangulation.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed a physical and a MAC layer adapted to
localization of nodes without pre-deployed spatial references.
The estimated distances are measured for every node and can
be tranfered through the data link for each node to calculate a
map of partners’ positions. As an opening, a possible system
integration including the use of Smart Antennas for rough
localisation of neighboring nodes is proposed.
