Abstract— Scratch is a free visual programming language and
online community for students between ages of 8 and 16,
designed
to
help
them
learn
and
practice
computer
programming
while
working
on
personally
meaningful
projects such as animated stories and games. The goal of this
article is to introduce the Scratch software program for
children and demonstrate how it can be used for educators.
Keywords- Scratch, programming language education, K-12.
I.
WHAT IS SCRATCH?
Scratch is a free software program developed by the MIT
Media Lab [1]. It is designed to help students between ages
of 8 and 16 practice computer programming. Scratch has
been accepted by many students, educators and parents to
training children to create interactive stories, animations,
games, apps etc. [2]. Scratch can help students to develop
creative thinking and computational thinking skills for
future math and science learning and projects, including
simulations and visualizations of experiments, recording
lectures with animated presentations, to social sciences
animated stories, and interactive art [2].
II.
HOW DOES SCRATCH WORK?
There are two main work screens from left to right on
the home page of Scratch. The left screen is referred to as
the Stage area, where images, such as animations, turtle
graphics, etc. are displayed. This Stage area uses X and Y
coordinates. Users can choose many ways to create sprites
and stage background on the Stage area. For example, users
can upload any figures or images from their computers or
they can choose a sprite from the Scratch library. Users can
also draw their own sprite manually using the Paint Editor,
provided by Scratch. All sprites thumbnails are listed at the
bottom of the Stage area (See Figure 1) [2].

Next, we address the area on the right in Figure 1,
which is called Blocks area. Under the Scripts tab, all
available scripts are listed and categorized in groups such as
Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Data, Events, Control, Sensing,
and Operators (see Figure 2). Those scripts can be applied
by dragging them onto the Blocks Palette. Each script can
also be tested individually by double-clicking the mouse
(see Figure 3).

There are two additional tabs next to the Scripts tab,
which are Costumes tab and Sounds tab (see Figure 4). The
Costumes tab allows users to change the look of the sprite to
create various effects, including animation. The Sounds tab

(see Figure 5) allows users to insert/edit sounds and music
to a Sprite.

SCRATCH IN EDUCATION
The Scratch programming environment is a computer
programming language for children from 8 to 16 years old.
Scratch can be integrated into the computer and technology
curriculum so that students learn how to program and create
multimedia applications and games with ease. Next, we
discuss the use of Scratch in the educational curriculum.
Scratch has been widely introduced in after-school
centers and other informal educational settings, and has
broadened opportunities for children from under-represented
groups who may eventually become designers and inventors
[8]. Scratch allows students to create their own applications
using their own creativity and imagination to create
complex programming projects, even connecting with a
simple robot used for a couple of sessions. The experience
will help their own understanding of geometry, which will
help reinforce learning as they are introduced more formally
to the subject during mathematics lessons [8].
Creating a finished application involves many skills like
the ones used by professional computer programmers,
games
designers,
and
multimedia
producers,
and
the
children learn the process of moving from the requirements
of a desired application, though a design phase, to the
engineering
and
testing
of
the
finished
application.
Completed Scratch applications can be uploaded to a Web
server to create a showcase for parents and other children to
view [8].
It should be pointed out that introducing Scratch into
classrooms will require teachers to spend additional effort
preparing lesson plans for the technology sessions and
ensuring that they had the programming knowledge to keep
up with some of the more advanced young programmers
who were working on projects at home and downloading
projects from the Internet. Teachers and school districts
need access to the resources and training required to give
teachers the experience and confidence to incorporate
Scratch into their lesson plans for computer/technology as
well as other topics of the curriculum.
