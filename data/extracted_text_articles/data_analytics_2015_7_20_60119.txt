Abstract—In 2007, Plan Ceibal became the ﬁrst nationwide
ubiquitous educational computer program in the world based
on the 1:1 model. It is one of the most important programs
implemented by Uruguay’s Government to minimize digital
divide and is based upon three pillars: equity, learning and
technology. As of 2007, Plan Ceibal has covered all public
schools, providing every student and teacher in kindergarten,
primary and middle school with a laptop or tablet and internet
access in the school. To date, Plan Ceibal has close to 700,000
beneﬁciaries, each with their own device. Since 2011, the
Plan has focused on providing the learning community with
a wide range of digital content to enhance the teaching and
learning process, most notably Learning Management Systems,
Mathematics Adaptive Platform, remote English teaching and
an online library. Today, Plan Ceibal operates and integrates a
large scale of databases fed by a number of management and
educational activities. This abundance of data presents a great
challenge and a large opportunity to exploit and transform
mass data into rich information. The main goal of this article
is to describe the most relevant data sources and present an
ongoing data analysis research grounded by a case study. In
addition, this paper suggests next steps required to implement
a
learning
analytics
strategy
within
Plan
Ceibal.
If
well
exploited, this evidence based data can be used to support and
improve the current technology and learning educational policies.
Keywords–Plan Ceibal; Big Data; Learning Analytics.

INTRODUCTION
The amount of data in the world has exploded; the analysis
of large data sets is expected to become a new platform
for new business, underpinning new waves of productivity
growth, innovation, and consumer surplus [1]. This rapidly
increasing amount of information, due to the expansion of
social computing and the Internet has been coined as Big Data,
and this time period described as the age of Big Data [2]. It
is expected that Big Data will have a signiﬁcant impact in the
ﬁeld of education, the design of curricula and the study of
general patterns of teaching and learning activities [3][4].
Learning analytics is established as a proper ﬁeld of knowl-
edge [5]. The use of predictive modeling and other advanced
analytic techniques help target instructional, curricular and
support resources, to enhance the achievement of speciﬁc
learning goals [6]. In 2006, the Government of Uruguay
deployed Plan Ceibal as its main strategy to introduce Informa-
tion and Communication Technologies on a large scale across
the entire education system [7][8]. Plan Ceibal has successfully
provided a device to all teachers and students in public schools
from kindergarten to middle school, as well as internet access
in all educational centers and outdoor areas. As stated by
Fullan et al. [9], the delivery of computers (in some cases
tablets) and internet connection represent the ﬁrst stage of Plan
Ceibal. From 2011, a second stage arrived with the introduction
of a strong initiative to deliver digital content to teachers
and students. The Plan has focused on providing the learning
community with digital content to enhance and personalize the
teaching and learning processes. More speciﬁcally Learning
Management Systems, Mathematics Adaptive Platform, remote
English teaching, online library with digital and media content,
amongst many others. As of 2013, the third stage of Plan
Ceibal is being overwhelmed by sustainability and quality
aspects of its large-scale development and set of platforms,
resources and services for educational community.

The distribution of over 700,000 laptops and tablets, as
well as the deployment of internet connections for schools
and communities, facilitated higher levels of social inclusion.
Moreover, it also provided equity via reduction of the ‘digital
gap’ between the Information and Communication Technolo-
gies “haves” and “have nots” in all socio-economic contexts
[10]; see Figure 1.
The decreased digital gap has enabled Plan Ceibal to
focus on improving the quality of education by integrating
technology in classrooms, schools and student’s households.
Plan Ceibal is currently pursuing a consistent strategy for
the improved implementation of the Data Exploitation stage,
outlined in the value chain model of Data Analytics in Figure
2. This stage is one of many Plan Ceibal is simultaneously
working on.
This paper provides an initial exploratory review to un-
derstand the data sources available in the existing databases

exploit these sources are presented. In Section 4 a case study
that correlates the use of Adaptive Maths Platform (PAM) with
infrastructure performance as well as social and demographical
variables is described. Section 5 presents some preliminary re-
sults and Section 6 discusses the future associated to Learning
Analytics and the Plan.

DATA SOURCES
Plan Ceibal is currently addressing many obstacles related
to Big Data. Today, Plan Ceibal manages national scale
databases that are necessary to pursue a number of man-
agement (deployment and management of devices and wiﬁ
network) and educational activities (teachers and students use
of the tablet, laptops, platforms, websites, contents, etc.). The
matrix in Table I shows some of the most important sources
of information available as well as the volume, variety and
frequency of data generation:

For instance, the Tracker System for Statistically Monitor-
ing Computer Usage enables us to know what the most popular
applications and activities are among students, how much time
they spent on the computers, at what time of the day, and drive
behavior patterns throughout the weeks. From this speciﬁc
data source, we know that the main student activity is web
browsing, followed by video camera applications, followed by
drawing application is associated to 83% of students involved
in Plan Ceibal’s initiative between 6-11 years of age, in the
primary school system.
It is worth mentioning that in the customer relationship
management (CRM) database, Plan Ceibal records the devices
owned per user. The PAM database provides information
regarding the intensity of its usage by students and teachers.
Zabbix database is the School’s Network monitoring system
and CREA 2 is the learning management system supported by
Ceibal in schools based on a social network philosophy.
The different data sources are vital to understand the impact
and use of the laptops on the national scale[11].

Regarding the structure of the different data sources, some
of the most relevant issues today are:
•
Lack of Integration: there is very limited interoper-
ability among databases.
•
Lack of a common processing and visualization frame-
work: a unique interface for processing and visualiza-
tion is necesary.
•
Lack of traceability: the bulk is generated from dif-
ferent databases, providers, interfaces and the unit of
analysis depends on the database (school, device, end
user or classroom based).
Most of the variables and data generated through these
databases are collected and processed for managerial and
operational needs. Simultaneously, a business intelligence (BI)
system is being built on top of all databases for management
purposes.
III.
KEY QUESTIONS
What are the key parameters, signiﬁcant variables and
required data sources to include in the “data integration” and
“data exploitation” stages? These questions can be described
as:
•
How can we improve integration of the different data
sources in a more comprehensive and meaningful
way?
•
How to enable interoperability and consistency be-
tween information and variables retrieved from dif-
ferent data sources (i.e: the unit of analysis in some
cases are schools, classrooms or individual based
information)?
•
What are the more reliable analytical techniques to
identify strong correlations amongst key variables?
•
How can the integration of the different data sources
be applied to better understand ways of improving
institutional and pedagogical strategies?

IV.
CASE STUDY
A. Motivation
The primary objective of Plan Ceibal is the use of the
technological development to boost pedagogic tools. In 2012,
Ceibal took a step forward by acquiring an adaptive plat-
form for mathematics (in Spanish PAM) that allowed the
beneﬁciaries to exercise and learn algebra, geometry, etc.
That platform allowed teachers to monitor and control the
classroom’s performance in PAM.
To improve the conditions for the use of PAM, Plan Ceibal
made a strategic decision towards deploying an appropriate
connectivity network and the acquisition of more modern
devices. In order to provide students with high performance
experiences via the new equipments a High Performance
Network (HPN) is being deployed since 2014 in every urban
school.
B. Methodology
The ﬁrst hypothesis driving the investigation is:
•
The more powerful network infrastructure will fa-
cilitate a higher amount of exercises completed by
students in PAM.
The second hypothesis is:
•
The social-demographic features (metropolitan vs. in-
terior urban, and socio-cultural context) affect the use
of PAM.
C. Research Questions
1)
To what extent does network performance correlate
with PAM use? And what are the most reliable tech-
niques and data sources to explore this correlation?
2)
To what extent does the social-demographic features
mediate and moderate the relationships between High
Performance Networks and PAM intensity of use?
D. Universe and sample
The universe are schools and students belonging to those
schools that had its High Performance Newtork deployed
during 2014. That represents 100 schools with 13800 students
from 4th to 6th level.
From the schools a random and stratiﬁed by socio-
demographic context sample is taken: 18 schools with 3,823
students.
The time frame will be data collected in PAM for the
2014 school year.
V.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS
Regarding ﬁrst hypothesis, an increase of 35.6% active
PAM users has been detected between t0 and t1, being t0 the
period of time in 2014 the school had its initial wiﬁ/internet
access and t1 the period of 2014 in which the school had its
HPN installed. This is illustrated in Table III
Regarding the second hypothesis, two analyses have been
made:
1)
Comparison of average of usage between t0 and t1
by location, i.e, interior urban (IU) vs. Montevideo
metropolitan Area (MVD) shown in Figure 3.
TABLE III. NUMBER OF PAM ACTIVE USERS BEFORE AND AFTER HPN
DEPLOYMENT.

After HPN
# PAM active users

1093
# activities
53179
67523
2)
Comparison of average of usage between t0 and t1
by socio-cultural context, i.e, favorable vs. very
unfavorable contexts(data not shown).
Figure 3. Intensity of PAM use vs. location
The comparison by location highlights that interior urban
usage is one order of magnitude bigger than metropolitan use.
On the other hand, there is a signiﬁcant difference between
t0 and t1 in the urban areas of the provinces whereas in
Montevideo there is no signiﬁcant variation. This can be seen
in Figure 3.
The comparison by social-cultural context demonstrates
ﬁrst that unfavorable contexts have approximately one order of
magnitude lower intensity of use. Secondly, when compared t0
and t1 there is statistical signiﬁcance in unfavorable contexts
only.
VI.
DISCUSSION AND FURTHER RESEARCH
From a general perspective, there is a clear need for a more
comprehensive information cartography of all the available
information resources, as well as a better understanding of
how the integration of different data sets can help Plan Ceibal
to create better learning experiences, services, tools and public
goods specialized in education. The main questions that arise
for further research are:
•
How to recognize the critical indicators that are more
strongly correlated with student’s performance?
•
How to improve the data traceability of beneﬁciaries,
as well as a better understanding of how the different
technologies are being used?

•
Will these new forms of tracking students behavior
transform how we study the relationship between
learning and human-computer interaction, or narrow
the palette of research options and alter what ‘#edtech
research’ means?
•
Will the deployment of these analytic techniques usher
in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive
research initiatives? [12]
•
How to provide channels and platforms that provide
effective feedback for the beneﬁciaries, i.e., teachers,
students, parents. etc.?
•
What are the possible strategies to transit from holistic
and statistical approaches, like location and socio-
cultural context, to a student’s level approach?
Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phe-
nomenon, we argue that it is necessary to reﬂect on these
matters and consolidate good practices in the emerging ﬁeld
of learning analytics in order to monitor the inﬂuence of
technologies in the education ecosystem.
The ongoing research shows some preliminary results about
correlation between High Network Performance and PAM
intensity of use as well as correlation to independent variables
like location and socio-cultural contexts.
The next steps will delve deeper into the challenges faced
by Plan Ceibal during it’s process of transforming and exploit-
ing the vast amounts of data generated by the organization.
We highlight once again, the development of technical and
institutional capabilities will allow Plan Ceibal to provide
an improved framework towards learning analytics, evidence-
based decision making and personalized learning.
