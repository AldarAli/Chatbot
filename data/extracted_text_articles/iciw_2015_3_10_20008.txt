Abstract—Politeness exhibited in a commercial context 
influences a business. E-commerce emerges a major way to 
conduct business; by contrast, politeness issues in virtual 
commercial contexts receive rare attention. This work aims to 
investigate whether politeness influence customer satisfaction 
and loyalty in online storefronts. The present work extended 
the American customer satisfaction index (ACSI) model by 
taking the politeness construct into account. The instrument’s 
reliability and validity were confirmed through empirical data 
analysis. By using the extended model, business can examine to 
which extent the politeness will influence their customers’ 
satisfaction and loyalty. Besides its practical applications, this 
work sets a stage for future studies trying to investigate the 
relationships between the politeness construct and other 
constructs interesting business administrators.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Politeness broadly refers to legitimate and considerate 
interactions among persons, which was found as a 
foundation of modern civilization [1] and a key factor 
upholding prosperous and peaceful societies [2]. Particularly, 
politeness is significant within commercial contexts. A 
merchant will lose its customers gradually if it cannot treat 
them politely; even it has other merits such as competitive 
pricing, plentiful product choices, advanced facilities, 
convenient layout, etc. Impoliteness in commercial contexts 
often hurts people’s feelings and faces, thus will overshadow 
the above merits, and leave customers negative impression 
and words-of-mouth. Based on practical experiences and 
rationales, politeness in commerce contexts influences 
peoples’ perceptions, satisfaction, and loyalty. Many prior 
academic studies [3]-[5] confirmed the influence of 
politeness on customer satisfaction, which is a key driver of 
customer loyalty [6], sustainable revenue [7][8], and 
successful business. 
In addition, according to prior studies that developed 
measurements for measuring service quality in different 
segments, politeness was treated as one of the determinants 
of business’ service quality [9][10], which in turn has been 
proved as a significant influence on customer satisfaction 
[11][12], and on buyers’ re-purchasing and referral behaviors 
[13], which is called customer loyalty. 
In light of its significance in operating a successful 
business and the latent relationships with customer 
satisfaction and loyalty, the present work aims to formally 
investigate 
how 
politeness 
will 
influence 
customer 
satisfaction and loyalty in online storefronts and to which 
extent the influence will be. 
The remaining parts of this article are organized as 
follows: Section II briefs prior studies regarding the 
politeness and the ACSI model; Section III describes the 
research method; Section IV analyzes the research findings; 
and the concluding remarks, implications, and future 
directions were provided in Section V. 
II. 
PRIOR WORKS  REVIEW 
A. Politeness and Business Administration 
Prior study found that people expect politeness from 
computers reciprocally, just like they treat their computers 
with politeness [14]. The findings indicate that people do 
care about the politeness of computers with which they 
interact. Another study indicated that the politeness shown 
by computers will make users behave reciprocally with more 
politeness [15]. Besides, a number of prior studies [16]-[19] 
also 
confirmed 
the 
influence 
of 
politeness 
on 
human-computer interactions. 
Regarding the commercial contexts, Berry [20], 
Reynolds and Beatty [21] found that rapport consisting of 
enjoyable interactions and personal connections, is a major 
determinant affecting customers’ satisfaction and loyalty, 
which contribute to a successful business. Kim and Davis 
[22] further pointed out that politeness plays a key role in 
early 
stage 
of 
nourishing 
rapport 
between 
sales 
representatives and customers. The implication of the above 
studies is that merchants not likely to build a satisfying and 
loyal customer base without paying attention to the 
politeness issues in their commercial contexts. 
When waves of computer and Internet keep on 
permeating into various aspects of our daily life, customers 
eventually will well recognize the politeness issues in online 
storefronts, just like they do in physical commercial contexts. 
Whitworth [23] stated that impolite software is one kind of 
social error, which likely to drive away users. In light of the 
significance of politeness in widely-computerized societies, 
Whitworth established a “polite computing” framework [24] 
that took a multi-facet viewpoint to examine cyberspace’s 
politeness beyond linguistic strategies. The framework 
consists 
of 
five 
principles 
for 
judging 
whether 
computer-initiated actions in five different facets are polite

or not, based on users’ perceptions. The 5 principles for 
judging politeness are summarized as follows: 
 
1. Respect user’s rights; polite software respects and thus 
does not preempt users’ rights. Besides, polite software does 
not utilize information before obtaining the permission from 
its owner. 
2. Behave transparently; polite software does not change 
things in secret, in contrast, it clearly declares what it will do 
or is doing, the real purpose of the action, and who it 
represents. 
3. Provide useful information; polite software helps users 
make informed decisions by providing useful and 
comprehensible information, in contrast, they avoid 
providing information that distract or even mislead users. 
4. Remember users; polite software memorize its past 
interactions with a specific user, thus can bring that user’s 
choices and preferences to future interactions. 
5. Respond to users with fidelity; polite software must 
respond to users’ requests faithfully rather than trying to 
pursue its own agenda. 
B. Customer Satisfaction and the ACSI 
According to prior studies, customer satisfaction plays 
key role in improving revenue [25]-[27] and increasing profit 
[28]-[30]. Furthermore, because it also positively affects 
stock investment returns [31][32], smart investors incline to 
those enterprises with higher customer satisfaction. In view 
of its significance, enterprises must be concerned about how 
to satisfy their customers, in effective and efficient ways. 
The ACSI [33], is a benchmark for measuring customer 
satisfaction with the quality of products and services 
available to household consumers in the United States. The 
ASCI periodically reports customer satisfaction scores 
ranging from 0 to 100 on four different levels: national, 10 
economic sectors, 47 major industries, and more than 230 
companies/agencies, according to the perceived experience 
of consumers. To collect data, roughly 70,000 customers are 
randomly picked and surveyed annually.  
Many research works have been conducted based on the 
rationales of the ASCI model, some used the original ACSI 
model, while many others applied variant models that were 
adjusted according to specific requirements. By using the 
ACSI, profitability and firm value in the hospitality and 
tourism industry were proved to be related with customer 
satisfaction [34]. The reliability of ACSI was studies and 
confirmed in different industries of other countries [35]. 
Antecedents of aggregate customer satisfaction were 
investigated by analyzing the relationships between 
cross-country economic indicators and national customer 
satisfaction data [36]. A model derived from the ACSI was 
successfully applied to identify factors which most 
significantly affect customer satisfaction of low-priced 
housing industry in Beijing, China [37]. An index for 
gauging customer satisfaction in online re-tailing in Taiwan 
(e-CSI), was developed based on the ACSI and was found 
to be effective in measuring customer satisfaction and 
predicting customer loyalty accordingly [38]. Overall 
speaking, the ACSI methodology have been proved to be a 
reliable and valid instrument for gauging customer 
satisfaction in national, sector, industry, and company 
levels.  
III. 
RESEARCH METHOD 
A. Hypothesis Model Development 
Responses from surveyed customers are fed into the 
extended ACSI model, which is a multi-equation 
econometric model developed by the University of 
Michigan's Ross School of Business, American Society for 
Quality, and the CFI group in 1994. As Figure 1 illustrates, 
the extended ACSI model is a cause-and-effect model with 
4 constructs for representing antecedents of customer 
satisfaction on the left side: customer expectations, 
perceived quality, perceived value, and politeness; construct 
of customer satisfaction in the center; while two constructs 
for representing consequences of satisfaction on the right 
side: customer complaints and customer loyalty [39]. 
Customer loyalty consists of the re-purchase intention and 
the price tolerance;  the former gauges customer's 
professed likelihood to repurchase from the same supplier in 
the future, while the latter one gauges customer's likelihood 
to purchase a company’s products or services at various 
price points. Customer loyalty is a critical construct in the 
model since it is a key determinant of firm profitability.  
Each construct is a multivariable component, which 
could be measured by several questions that are weighted 
within the model, and the questions assess customer 
evaluations of the determinants of each construct. Since the 
present study adopted the extended ACSI model to 
investigate the antecedents and consequences of customer 
satisfaction. Being consistent with prior studies adopting the 
similar model, the following 11 hypotheses are made about 
customers' perceptions in the context of online commerce: 
 
H1: Customer expectations (CE) will have a positive impact 
on perceived quality (PQ).  
H2: Perceived quality (PQ) will has a positive impact on 
perceived value (PV).  
H3: Perceived quality (PQ) will has a positive impact on 
customer satisfaction (CS).  
H4: Customer expectations (CE) will have a positive impact 
on perceived value (PV).  
H5: Customer expectations (CE) will have a positive impact 
on customer satisfaction (CS).  
H6: Perceived value (PV) will has a positive impact on 
customer satisfaction (CS).  
H7: Customer satisfaction (CS) will has a negative impact on 
customer complains (CC).  
H8: Customer satisfaction (CS) will has a positive impact on 
customer loyalty (CL).  
H9: Customer complains (CC) will have a negative impact on 
customer loyalty (CL).

B. Instrument 
To verify the hypothesis model, a field study technique 
was employed through a survey. A structured questionnaire 
was 
used 
to 
survey 
customers' 
perceptions. 
The 
questionnaire contains total 21 items as Table. I shows; each 
construct (dimension) have number of corresponding items 
reflecting the manifest variables. The items basically came 
from the methodology report of the ACSI [40] and the polite 
principles proposed by Brian Whitworth and his colleagues 
[41], all these question items were devised according to the 
relevant studies and theories. All items in the survey were 
on a seven-point scale, ranging from strongly disagree (1) 
through neutral (4) to strongly agree (7). A pretest of the 
survey was conducted to check if there exist any ambiguous 
loadings before administration of the survey. 
C. Participants 
An online questionnaire was used to collect participants’ 
opinions; the participants were, in part, recruited from 
information management majored college students in 
Taiwan. Besides, to broaden the sampling population, 
friends and family members of the recruited students were 
also invited. Before answering the questionnaire, a short 
instruction was provided for guiding the participants to 
assess online storefronts. After the orientation, 536 
participants filled the online survey in May and June 2014, 
and 346 completed the survey effectively. The subjects 
whose responses were considered to be effective must have 
more than 5-year experience in online shopping. 182 (52.6%) 
out of 346 effective respondents were female, respondents 
were aged between 18 to 63 year-old, and their average age 
is 45.2.

an advanced statistics method - structured-equation model 
(SEM) was employed to carry out the subsequent analysis 
by applying the LISREL 9. The LISREL takes into account 
all co-variances in the data set and thus allows users to 
simultaneously examine the correlations, shared variances, 
the casual relationships between constructs (hypothesis), 
and the significance level and coefficient of the lines. 
A. Reliability of the Instrument 
Reliability of the questionnaire, which comprises 7 
constructs, was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha. As Table 
II shows, the Cronbach’s alpha values of all constructs were 
close to 0.6, except the customer loyalty (CL), which 
composite reliability value is 0.53. These values indicated 
the instrument has a moderate reliability. Besides, other 
measurement model fit indices all exceed the common 
threshold values recommended by domain experts [42][43]. 
The figures also indicated that all items load significantly on

B. Discriminant validity and goodness-of-fit 
Discriminant validity was assessed according to the 
Holmes-Smith [44] stating that variance extracted estimates 
should exceed square of the correlation between the two 
constructs. In this work, correlation matrix approach and 
factor analyses were applied to examine the convergent and 
discriminant validity. As summarized in Table III, the 
smallest within-factor correlations are adequate. Besides, 
each smallest within-factor correlation was considerably 
higher among items intended for the same construct than 
among those designed to measure different constructs. 
These 
data 
suggest 
that

convergent 
and

C. Influential Effects Analysis 
The LISREL was used to calculate the coefficients 
(factor loadings) indicating the extent to which the latent 
variables affect the measured variables. In summary, Figure 
2 and Table V show the standardized LISREL path 
coefficients and corresponding t-values. They show that 9 
out of the 11 original hypotheses (the corresponding 
relationships between construct nodes) are significant, 
except the two: one is between politeness and customer 
loyalty; another is between customer complaints and 
loyalty.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
A. Managerial Implications 
The research findings provide 3 major implications for 
online business administrators as follows: 
1) The customer expectations, perceived quality, 
perceived value, and politeness will influence customer 
satisfaction, but at different scales.  Among the 4 
antecedents, the perceived quality influence satisfaction 
most significantly, which means if customers cannot get 
products or service with good quality, they will be 
unsatisfied. This is rational for online customers because 
they usually spend some time on doing research before they 
purchasing particular items online, and the research work 
dilutes the impact of perceived expectation and value.  
2) The politeness in virtual contexts positively 
influences customer satisfaction. Thus, to construct a 
satisfactory 
virtual 
commercial 
environment; 
online 
merchants need to take politeness into account, besides 
those factors including visual design, functionality, 
operational procedure, and performance of Web sites. 
Although the findings did not support the direct the causal 
relationship between politeness and customer loyalty, but 
customer satisfaction does influence customer loyalty, 
which still implied the indirect impact brought by politeness 
on customer loyalty that is a key factor affecting company's 
performance. 
3) There was no significant and negative relationship 
between customer complaints and loyalty. That means 
customers who complained about an agent/vendor during 
the course of a prior transaction still might shop with the 
same agents/vendors in the future, or they will not incline to 
the same agent/vendor that they did not complain about. 
This is not in line with most prior studies adopting the ACSI 
model. A rational explanation is that customers can find 
new online merchants with ease, comparing with finding a 
substitute merchant in physical context. Thus, complaining 
toward an online merchant looks time-consuming since 
customers can switch to a new merchant easily, not to 
mention the processing duration and responses might be 
unpredictable in virtual contexts. In addition, unhappy 
online patrons usually tend to file complains toward a 
customer servant rather than to fill a Web form [45] since 
they usually can expect to obtain more instant and concrete 
responses from real persons. 
B. Conclusion and Contribution 
In a civilized society, people dislike verbal and 
behavioral impoliteness, regardless of contexts. Obviously, 
various forms of impoliteness in virtual storefronts that 
customers tend to avoid will be harmful to online merchants. 
Both prior studies and rationales told us that politeness in 
e-commerce 
contexts 
are 
well 
worth 
notice 
and 
consideration. 
In view of the politeness issue's significance in the 
contexts of commerce, this work developed a model and an 
instrument for examining the effects of the politeness. The 
findings confirmed that the instrument is reliable and valid, 
also indicated that 9 out the 11 hypotheses are accepted in 
the extended ACSI model. This extended model could be 
used by business to measure the impact of politeness on 
their customers’ satisfaction and loyalty. 
C. Limitation and Future Directions 
One major limitation of this work is that there might 
exist geographical and cultural factors contributing to the 
research findings; most surveyed subjects are domestic 
customers who possess different perspectives toward the 
politeness from customers in other regions or countries. 
However, e-business models spread over the globe 
nowadays. Therefore, broader sampling of subjects is 
necessary to study the same issue from a global viewpoint. 
Besides, demographic aspects of subjects including gender, 
age, income, and occupation may result in some of the 
differences in customer satisfaction, its antecedents and 
consequences, and is a worthy topic for further research. 
Furthermore, this work could be extended by adopting a

associated with e-commerce, such as Web site usability, 
service encounter, and trust into consideration.
