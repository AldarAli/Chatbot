Abstract - In Italy and many European countries energy 
production from biomass is encouraged by strong economic 
subsidies so that biomass energy plants are getting large 
diffusion. Nevertheless, it is necessary to define the 
environmental compatibility taking into account global 
parameters as well as environmental impacts at regional and 
local scale coming from new polluting emissions. The 
environmental balances regarding new energy plants are of 
primary importance within very polluted areas such as 
Northern Italy where air quality limits are systematically 
exceeded, in particular for PM10, NO2 and ozone. The paper 
analyses the renewable energy scenario relating to manure 
anaerobic digestion and biogas production for the Province of 
Cuneo, N-W Italy, and the environmental sustainability of the 
possible choices. The study is focused on energy producibility, 
heat and power, nitrogen oxides and ammonia emissions, GHG 
balances dealing also with indirect releases of CH4 and N2O, as 
well as emissions due to energy crops production. The most 
important conclusion that can be drawn is that the production 
of renewable energy from anaerobic digestion could cover up 
to 13% of the Province electricity consumption but 
sustainability in terms of CO2 emissions can be reached only 
through an overriding use of agricultural waste products 
(manure and by-products instead of energy crops) and 
cogeneration of thermal energy at disposal; the application of 
best available techniques to waste gas cleaning, energy 
recovery and digestate chemical-physical treatments allows 
positive emissive balances.

INTRODUCTION 
Renewable energy plants (based on biogas produced by 
anaerobic digestion of manure and energy crops, vegetable 
oil, wood and solid biomass) are getting large diffusion in 
Northern Italy because of the benefits deriving from the 
production of energy on one’s own, the reduction of odour 
nuisance from manure and the increase of its biological 
stability and, most of all, the economic return (pay-back 
times can be as short as 4-5 years in Italy) based on 
electricity production. The new energy scenario has to be 
considered within the environmental background of the area 
where it is introduced, involving air quality limits 
compliance, the use of best available techniques, energetic 
efficiency (also thermal), emissive balances, global 
warming issues, biomass origins, aspects dealing with the 
use of water and fertilizers for energy crops, nitrates 
leaching towards groundwater. This is the focus of the 
present study. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
In literature there are many references about bioenergy 
production and related environmental sustainability, in 
particular the individuation and utilization of indicators or 
methodologies corresponding to LCA have been studied; 
the evaluated aspects concern both the original definition of 
the evaluation scheme and subsequently the description of 
many practically interesting applicative situation have been 
obtained. As far as biogas production and utilization is 
concerned, in [1], the energy efficiency of different biogas 
systems was evaluated and specific energy balances were 
defined; the study provides bases for assessment of 
environmental compatibility, including management of 
spent digestate. It has been observed [2] that biogas systems 
lead to environmental improvements, arising from changed 
land use and handling of organic waste products, which 
often exceed the direct benefits from fossil fuel 
replacement; from the other side an impact factor, of 
different numerical value, can be originated, arising from 
the utilized raw material, the energy service that is provided, 
the replaced reference system. The use of LCA has been 
suggested by Colin et al. [3] to evaluate the contribution to 
climate 
change 
of 
biomethane 
production 
by 
monofermentation of cultivated crops, and it resulted 
adsolutely lower than the contribution of natural gas 
importation; also the effects on ecosystem quality and 
human health damages were evaluated. In order to define 
the required information concerning energetic aspects, 
experiences of co-digestion of energy crops and cow or pig 
manures have been conducted on different scales  [4][5], in 
order to define the influence of operating parameters on 
methane yield and post-methanation potential. From a

methodological point of view, a standard methodology has 
been outlined [6], to compare the greenhouse gas balances 
of bioenergy systems with those of fossil energy systems: a 
careful definition of system boundaries, and many operating 
issues have been dealt with in detail, with the final aim of an 
optimization from the greenhouse gas emissions point of 
view. In order to establish a reliable approach to the impact 
assessment of biomass cultivation phase, different LCA 
models were developed [7], and data from experimental 
fields were used for testing. The aspect of GHG balances of 
bioenergy 
systems 
producing 
electricity, 
heat 
and 
transportation biofuels has been examined in comparison 
with fossil reference systems in Cherubini [8] from standard 
LCA. In literature there are a lot of studies relating to this 
field. From the indicated references it is possible to establish 
that the 
environmental 
balances 
for 
energy 
crops 
exploitation are well defined and may examples are at 
disposal for useful comparisons; in any case a specific 
definition of the local context and the existing operating 
conditions must be carefully examined, in order to arrive to 
valid conclusions for a proposed application. 
III. 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF NORTHERN ITALY  
Air quality of Northern Italy is one of the most polluted 
of the world, maybe the worst in Europe, due to the strong 
human activities and the orography of its territory. PM10, 
NO2 and ozone concentrations measured at the ground level 
diffusely and permanently go beyond the quality standards. 
In particular, PM10 concentration is only partly due to 
particulate primary emissions because the chemical analysis 
of PM measured in Northern Italy confirm that secondary 
particles (deriving from NOx, SOx, NH3 and VOC) account 
for 60-70 % of total PM concentration [9]. Moreover, some 
European studies report [10] the following aerosol 
formation factors, to be considered by weight, starting from 
gaseous pollutants: NOx 0,88; SOx 0,54; NH3 0,64. As it is 
clear from the reported figures, in order to control and 
improve air quality in Northern Italy, the emissions of 
gaseous compounds such as NOx and ammonia (mostly 
emitted by agriculture) should be mainly reduced. Another 
strong environmental critical issue of Northern Italy is 
nitrate contamination of surface and ground-water resources 
mainly due to the use of fertilizers and the land-spreading of 
animal manures.  
IV. 
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPATIBILITY FOR ANAEROBIC 
DIGESTION PLANTS 
The main environmental concerns referring to animal 
manure management are odours due to uncontrolled 
fermentation, ammonia emissions from the storage and the 
land-spreading and greenhouse gases (GHG) release (CH4 
and N2O). Anaerobic digestion (AD) can be an answer to 
odour nuisance but it is totally ineffective on nitrogen 
content of digested materials; moreover, as we will see later 
on, also CH4 and N2O could be enhanced with respect to the 
ante operam conditions.  
Due to obvious economic drivers, manure is rarely 
digested alone; on the contrary, energy crops such as maize, 
triticale and sorghum and, sometimes, agro-residues are fed 
to digesters in order to increase the volatile solid (VS) 
content and then biogas production (higher methane yields). 
AD plants formally proposed in Northern Italy in the last 
months are several and they are all characterised by high 
crop/manure ratios within the mixture to be digested, (crops 
sometimes represent more than 50% of the feedstock).  
As previously mentioned, within anaerobic digesters, 
nitrogen contained in the primary mixture is not removed 
and almost the same amount can be found in the digested 
material, under different forms: as a matter of fact, a large 
part of nitrogen contained in proteins is hydrolyzed to 
ammonium ion (NH4
+) and dissolved ammonia (NH3) that 
can be volatilized; an increase in pH, NH3 concentration and 
temperature, 3 conditions that do occur after anaerobic 
digestion, enhance ammonia emissions during storage and 
after field application. Moreover, nitrogen content of the 
mixture to be digested is strongly increased by the use of 
energy crops (for example, maize silage contain 4.3 kg 
N/ton of FM) 
This way, the nitrogen amount to be managed along with 
digested materials can be strongly larger than that in 
primary manure and it is surely more suitable for 
volatilization. 
Based on reliable emission factors and international 
studies (CORINAIR, IPCC and IPPC BAT reference 
documents, Italian experimental results and so on) it is 
possible to assess that 34 ±11% of nitrogen contained in the 
storage is emitted as NH3-N from the storage and land-
spreading (almost 15% from the land-spreading) of fresh 
animal manure. This amount could be strongly enhanced by 
chemical-physical conditions induced by digestion; as a 
matter of fact, according to different crop/manure ratios, 
ammonia emissions can be much larger than those from 
fresh manure, up to three times when manure represents just 
one third of the mixture to be digested. 
As far as energetic scenarios at the regional scale are 
concerned, in the case we decide to send 10% of manure 
produced in the Piedmont region (1300 kt/y) to AD together 
with the same amount of energy crop (maize), 531 GWhel 
could be produced but ammonia emissions would show an 
increase around 2300 t/y and more than 700 t NOx/y would 
be emitted from the engine, that corresponds to a huge neo-
formation potential of more then 2000 t/y of PM10 (or, more 
correctly, PM2.5). These data can be also seen as a specific 
emission of secondary particulates around 4 g/kWhel due to 
energy production from AD, whereas the average secondary 
PM emission factor for the Italian national power system 
(SO2: 0,67 g/kWhel; NOx: 0,523 g/kWhel; PM: 0,024 
g/kWhel) is 0,85 g/kWhel. As obvious, the reported figures 
refer to plants without any ammonia abatement devices, that 
are not generally planned for new installations. The large 
amount of ammonia release could be strongly reduced by 
employing stripping-absorbing towers for digested materials

(H2SO4 solutions are usually applied as absorbents in order 
to obtain a fertilising by-product that could be sold); 
alternatively, the storage tank could be covered (a solid 
cover should be implemented because straw covers or 
natural crusts could be less effective in reducing NH3 
emissions and have the potential to increase GHG emissions 
[11]) and Best Available Techniques to the land spreading 
of digestates (immediate incorporation, use of deep 
injectors) should be applied. On the other hand, NOx 
emissions could be largely reduced by Selective Catalytic 
Reduction (up to 90%), but the technical feasibility of this 
solution depends on the poisoning potential of waste gas 
and the purification possibilities.  
As far as greenhouse gases balances are concerned, 
0,0032±0,0012 kg N2O-N/kg excreted N are expected to be 
emitted from the storage of fresh manure; moreover, an 
indirect N2O should be considered, dealing with volatilised 
nitrogen: the proposed emission factor is 0.01 kg N2O-N/(kg 
NH3-N + NOx-N volatilised). 
Another environmental aspect that should be analysed 
when dealing with anaerobic digestion is the post-
methanation potential, that is the uncontrolled emission of 
methane from the storage of digested materials. As a matter 
of fact, the post-methanation somehow depends on the 
volatile solid content of the slurry and it is well known that 
the VS removal efficiency of AD is never 100%; on the 
contrary VS conversion to biogas is for the most part a 
function of the biodegradability of the primary mixture to be 
digested and the dimension of the digester through the 
hydraulic retention time (HRT). Based on several 
experimental data, the VS removal efficiency is often lower 
than 50%.  
This way, taking into account the VS content in the 
digested material that sometimes can be remarkable (more 
than 50% of the original quantity) on the one hand, given 
the temperature of digested materials, the presence of 
specialized anaerobic biomass coming from the digesters 
and the long time at disposal for the storage (even more than 
100 days) on the other hand, the post-methanation could 
represent a considerable emission.  
Some authors [12] report that “typically 5-15% of the 
total biogas produced can be obtained from post-
methanation of residues” while the CROPGEN project [13] 
inform that up to 12-31% of total methane production can 
be recovered from post-methanation of digestates. The post-
methanation potentials measured within the CROPGEN 
project for digestates incubated for 100 days at 5, 20 and 
35°C were 1-9, 73-120, 133-197 l CH4/kg VS respectively. 
As far as the mentioned project is concerned, the post-
methanation potential doesn’t change during feeding 
regimes with 30-40% of crops in the feedstock. Other 
studies [14] report post-methanation potentials of 160-210 
at 35-55°C, 53-87 at 15-20 °C and 26 l CH4/kg VS at 10°C 
for a storage of 250 days. 
In order to develop proper GHG balances around the 
technical choice of  anaerobically digesting manure and 
crops, a post-methanation potential of 50 l CH4/kg VS and a 
VS removal efficiency of 50% can be used to calculate the 
indirect GHG emissions from the storage of digested 
materials. As far as GHG emissions from untreated manure 
are concerned, the emission factors proposed by IPCC can 
be considered a good reference: for a mixture of swine and 
dairy cattle manure and a climate between cool and 
temperate, an emission around 4 kg CH4/t of manure can be 
expected. 
As pointed out by Figure 1, co-digestion of manure and 
energy crops (when energy crops represent from 30 to 70% 
of feedstock), causes indirect GHG emissions that nullify 
the “energy bonus” due to CO2 avoided emissions [15]: 
based on our assumption the indirect emissions of GHG can 
be quantified as 400 ± 67 g CO2eq/kWhel, mainly due to 
CH4 releases from the storage of digestate, that is 
comparable to the Italian average CO2 emission factor for 
energy production (496 g CO2/kWhel): the reported figure 
represent the average value for three different post-
methanation models. Furthermore, it should be said that the 
proposed balances neglect the emissions of CH4 and N2O 
from the biogas engine, as well as CO2eq emissions relating 
to cultivation and transport of energy crops; these 
contributions would even worsen the reported GHG 
balances. This way, in the case energy bonus, that is 
strongly 
economically 
propelled, 
is 
cancelled 
by 
uncontrolled GHG released, the renewable energy mission 
of AD would be betrayed. 
 
 
Figure 1. Indirect GHG emissions for Anaerobic coDigestion and 
thermal credit due to cogeneration 
 
The negative impacts of indirect emissions from co-
digestion of manure and energy crop are confirmed by some 
recent studies [16] and [17]; the first presentation points out 
a range from 150 to 700 g CO2eq/kWhel for AD (the higher 
value corresponds to co-digestion of manure and energy 
crops and it is mainly due to production and transport of 
biomass), while the second author reports (personal 
communication) that “in extreme cases (open storage of 
digestate and low HRT) the CO2eq balance can reach levels 
of 600–700 g CO2eq/kWhel, that means: biogas production

causes the same GHG emissions as German conventional 
electricity production”. 
As one can easily observe from the mentioned data, 
energy production from AD could have a negative meaning 
as far as sustainability aspects are concerned. As obvious, 
the solution can be technological as higher HRT, 
thermophilic digestion regimes, gas-tight storage of 
digestates (and combustion of released methane in the 
biogas engine) and thermal oxidation of waste gas from the 
engine can strongly reduce methane indirect emissions. 
Moreover, cogeneration of thermal energy can save up to 
300 g CO2eq/kWhth, as showed by Figure 1, improving 
GHG overall balance. 
V. 
ENERGY-CROPS AND MANURE AVAILABILITY FOR THE 
PROVINCE OF CUNEO, ENERGY PRODUCTION SCENARIOS 
The Province of Cuneo is characterized by intensive 
livestock farming, more than 428.000 cattles and 824.000 
swines, producing a huge amount of manure, around 8 
millions tons per year. In the same area, 50.000 ha are 
destined to maize cultivation (173.000 in the Piedmont 
Region) and 30.000 ha (130.000 in the Region) to other 
cereals (wheat, sorghum, triticum). Based on the average 
producibility, the last regional planning on renewable 
energies (DGR 28/09/2009 n. 30-12221 “Relazione 
Programmatica dell'Energia della Regione Piemonte”) 
stated that up to 5% of cultivated fields could be used to 
produce energy crops, that is more or less 478.000 t/y of 
maize and 198.000 t/y of other cereals, still remaining 
within an environmentally and socio-economic sustainable 
context. That is to say that 200.000 t/y of energy crops 
could be produced in the province of Cuneo in order to 
improve biogas and energy production by means of 
anaerobic codigestion. In the following Table 1, data on 
manure and energy crops yearly production, dry matter and 
volatile solids content of materials, biogas producibility and 
power are reported. It is important to observe that AD of all 
manure produced by the province could generate 80 MWe, 
that is 12% of electricity consumption of the province would 
be provided.

At the same time 60 MWth (the thermal consumption of 
fermentation process, 30 % of available heat, has been 
already subtracted) could be produced and destined to the 
substitution of existing heating plants or some industrial use 
(drying of digestate, wood, cereals). In the case the choice is 
anaerobic co-digestion of all manure and energy crops 
according to the regional sustainability criteria, the 
produced electricity would be 91 MW (13,5% of total 
consumption) and 71 MW of extra thermal power. 
As a matter of fact, on 31th December 2010, 28 biogas 
plants are regularly authorized in the Province of Cuneo; on 
the whole, the feedstock is formed by 150.000 t/y of cattle 
manure, 68.000 t/y of swine manure, 114.000 t/y of maize 
and 43.000 t/y of other cereals, as reported by Table 2. That 
is to say that energy crops represents 42% of the feedstock, 
and they are very close to the maximum quantities admitted 
by regional sustainability criteria. The electricity production 
corresponds to 1,5% of the total consumption of the 
Province; unfortunately, the thermal energy at disposal, 
almost 9 MW (73,8 GWh/y), is dispersed for the main part, 
just 20-30% being use for small district heating or drying 
plants.

VI. 
GREENHOUSE GASES BALANCE 
In order to estimate the possible CO2 benefits arising 
from renewable energy plants it must be considered that, on 
the basis of the emission inventory for the Province of 
Cuneo (year 2006), agriculture and livestock farming 
represents 18% of total CO2eq emissions of the Province.  
In the case all manure of the Province is digested 
together with 200.000 t/y of energy crops (scenario in Table 
1), assuming that all available thermal energy is used to 
displace existing heating plants (fuelled by natural gas for 
70% and gasoil for 30%), that is optimal CHP, the benefit in 
terms of avoided CO2 eq is quantified by Table 4. the 
results lies on the following assumptions: 
1. electricity production: 496 g CO2/kWhe; 
2. replaced heating plants: 55 kg CO2/GJ for natural 
gas, 74 kg CO2/GJ for gasoil; 
3. 10314 
t 
CH4/y 
from 
traditional 
manure 
management are avoided;

4. post-methanation potential from the storage of 
digested materials: 5% of produced biogas (192 g 
CO2 eq/kWhe);  
5. GWP: 25 for methane, 298 for N2O; 
6. enhancement of ammonia volatilisation due to AD 
is neglected. 
The reported figures comprehend the indirect N2O 
emissions due to nitrogen oxides and ammonia emissions 
(calculated in the next chapter): if we use the overall factor 
suggested by Balsari [18] for AD without energy crops (250 
g CO2 eq/kWhe), the results would be very similar (total 
avoided: -621.017 t CO2 eq/y). The reported data outline 
that the described energy scenario would save 50% of the 
whole GHG emissions from agriculture, 10% of all CO2 eq 
emissions of the Province. This would be an extraordinary 
result as far as CO2 saving targets at 2020 are concerned 
(17% of final energy consumption has to be provided by 
renewables). The calculated CO2 benefit could be even  
better (up to – 818.328 t CO2 eq/y) in the case post-methane 
is recovered by means of gas-tight storage tanks.

On the contrary, the actual biogas plant authorized 
configuration (Table 2) would give the results showed by 
Table 4. In this case, the further assumptions are: 
1. replaced heating plants: only 25% of the available 
thermal energy is used to replace natural gas and 
gasoil boilers (70 and 30 % respectively); 
2. 258 t CH4/y from traditional manure management 
are avoided; 
3. indirect emissions for anaerobic co-digestion: 600 
g CO2 eq/kWhe [18];  
4. enhancement of ammonia volatilisation due to AD 
is neglected. 
In the actual conditions, biogas plant are not able to give 
any environmental advantage at the global scale (the 
balance is very close to break even) because the energy 
bonus due to the production of renewable energy is 
compensated by strong indirect GHG emissions and 
cogenerated thermal energy is not used in an effective way. 
The calculated results are confirmed by [19] that reported an 
indirect GHG emissions of 542 g CO2 eq/kWhe for a 
feedstock 50:50 manure/energy crops.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPATIBILITY AT THE LOCAL 
SCALE 
The environmental balance carried out in the previous 
chapter for GHG at the global scale should be enlarged to 
comprehend also criteria pollutants that are very important 
at the local and regional extent. The following Tables 5 and 
6 reports the total emissions dealing with the described 
energy scenarios for NOX, PM10, NH3 and SOX.

As one can easily observe, the emissive balance is not 
positive for both the analysed scenarios. In the case of the 
“sustainable configuration” (Table 1), NOx emissions at the 
local scale (+ 953 t/y) are not totally compensated by 
avoided emissions due to electricity production and 
cogeneration and the increase of ammonia releases is around 
330 t/y: the overall balance in terms of secondary particles 
(based on aerosol formation factors reported in the previous 
chapter) outlines an increase of 177 t PM10/y. As far as the 
authorized plant configuration is concerned, the balance is 
even worse, + 196 t PM10/y, mainly relating to additional 
ammonia emissions (+ 275 t/y) due to the use of large 
quantities of energy crops. Moreover, it should be 
remembered that in the latter configuration, a strong 
increase of nitrogen content (880 t N/y →1.546 t N/y) has to 
be faced when managing digested materials, according to 
the limits of land spreading (170-340 kg N/ha) while in the 
sustainable scenario, where manure represents 98% of the 
feedstock, the increase of nitrogen to be managed along 
with digestate would be negligible (30.663 t N/y → 31.463 t 
N/y).

VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
Renewable energy plants are strongly encouraged by 
European legislation but their effect on air quality and their 
sustainability in terms of CO2 emissions, in particular for 
biogas 
plants, 
could 
be 
negative, 
specifically 
for 
compromised areas such as Northern Italy. The analysed 
energy scenarios for the Province of Cuneo point out that, in 
order to obtain benefits in terms of CO2, energy crops 
should be avoided in favour of manure and agricultural 
waste products, thermal energy cogenerated by anaerobic 
digestion plants should be totally recovered to replace 
existing heating plants and the post-methanation production 
should be exploited. These conditions can help achieving 
CO2 targets at 2020 but are not enough to ensure a positive 
or neutal emissive balance at the local scale, that is a 
condition of primary importance in northern Italy. To this 
end, NOx emissions from the internal combustion engine 
should be minimized by means of SCR, cogeneration of 
thermal energy maximized and digestate nitrogen content 
should be properly treated in order to reduce ammonia 
emissions 
(covered 
storage 
tank, 
immediate 
incorporation/use of deep injectors for land-spreading) 
and/or produce a fertilizer (stripping-absorbing towers, 
dryers and/or evaporators) to be used in a more effective 
way if compared to traditional manure or digested materials. 
It is important to note that these conclusions are directed to 
the specific high criticality conditions of Province of Cuneo 
and North of Italy, but their qualitative meaning can also be 
extrapolated to other European situations of similar agro – 
industrial economy. A promising alternative solution that 
could ensure better environmental compatibility to AD is 
the production of biomethane by means of upgraded biogas. 
This solution could be very expensive in terms of gas 
purification chiefly, the advantages in terms of economic 
benefits 
from 
renewable 
energy 
production 
(green 
certificates) should be lost, but a better global environmental 
balance could be obtained, and a local emission impact 
should be avoided.
