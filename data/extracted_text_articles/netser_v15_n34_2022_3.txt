 INTRODUCTION 
Internet-of-things applications have become widespread 
across various domains, such as smart cities, industrial 
automation, healthcare, and “smart everything.” This has been 
introduced to leverage Internet connectivity to turn objects 
into smart objects and enables devices to exchange 
information with each other and make decisions. For instance, 
smart-city applications can provide a solution for the issues 
resulting from urbanization, including social needs, and 
governmental structures [2]. These applications have led to an 
explosive increase in the number of edge-node devices. In 
other words, success in this context depends on the effective 
deployment of advanced wireless network technologies. In 
this occasion, machine-type communications, which are quite 
different from traditional human-type communications, must 
be investigated extensively. The features of these systems 
include low power, broad coverage, ultra-density, and mobile 
edge computing [3]. In addition, smart-city solutions face 
unique limitations due to unpredictable and non-uniform 
traffic, and some areas may be outside the wireless network 
coverage, such as rural areas or areas where a natural disaster 
has occurred [4]. Disaster-resilient smart cities require secure 
and reliable wireless communication because it is of extreme 
importance when dealing with users’ health records and other 
sensitive information [5]. 
Various wireless communications and network protocols 
have been investigated to meet different requirements 
regarding the collection, distribution, security, and privacy of 
sensing data. Towards this end, wireless sensor networks 
(WSNs) have become an integral part of the future Internet 
framework to take advantage of various technologies across 
horizontal and vertical domains. One promising element of the 
solution for the above technique is the use of an information-
centric network (ICN), (e.g., a content-centric network or 
named-data 
network). 
This 
next-generation 
network 
architecture is poised to replace the current IP-based 
networks [6]. It natively supports features, such as abstraction, 
naming, and in-network caching, which enables decoupling 
the data from its original location and adopting individual 
data-based security at the network-layer level. Therefore, the 
idea of ICN with WSNs is a suitable combination for the 
aforementioned background, which yields information-
centric wireless sensor networks (ICWSNs). 
ICWSNs implement a packet flooding (broadcasting) 
strategy, which generates numerous requesting packets, 
resulting in high traffic and network congestion. Although this 
paper does not focus on congestion control, it is essential to 
consider congestion when aiming to enhance ICWSNs. 
Therefore, it is imperative to develop a new ICN-based 
network protocol and friendly wireless communications 
technologies. However, to the best of our knowledge, suitable 
wireless systems have not yet been sufficiently investigated 
with respect to integrating communication, caching, 
computing, control, sensing, and localization technologies [7]. 
Such systems present several technical concerns, including 
limited battery power, range between devices, bandwidth, 
disconnectivity, 
network 
overload, 
data 
redundancy, 
communication overhead, network 
lifetime, 
lack of 
information, and data integration difficulties. As a medium 
access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocol 
underpinning ICWSNs, the ad-hoc wireless networking, and 
multi-hop relay networking techniques can be used as clues 
for practical usage. These technologies enhance the domain of 
autonomous-distributed services at the cost of efficient 
utilization of system resources [8]. 
We propose a cooperative communication scheme for 
underpinning effective ICWSN frameworks. The concept of 
cooperative communications can be used to increase the gains 
by harnessing the effects of path diversity, i.e., by having a 
relay node send the same data to a destination node if the data 
transmission is not successful. The proposed scheme uses a 
network coding (NC) [9] technique to minimize network 
traffic on relay nodes. However, NC-encoded packets 
generate an area of epidemic-packet collisions and congestion 
because the neighbor relay nodes forward the packets at the 
same time. Furthermore, in some cases, WSN devices 
simplify the protocol stacks, and omit synchronization and

collision avoidance mechanisms. The proposed scheme can 
reduce the radio interference among multiple relay nodes 
during the data flooding process by using constructive 
interference—if 
receiver-side 
nodes 
can 
detect 
a 
superposition of baseband signals from multiple transmitter-
side nodes, the interference can be ignored [10]. 
The previous work [1] illustrated a blueprint of this study. 
On the other hand, the contributions of this paper are as 
follows: we propose a MAC/PHY protocol and evaluate the 
advantage of combining NC and constructive interference for 
the 
proposed 
scheme 
through 
fundamental 
PHY 
characteristics. We also evaluate the improvement to caching 
data deployment as a result of the proposed scheme. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents an overview of the basic principle of 
cooperative communications. Section III introduces the 
proposed scheme, and Section IV presents the numerical 
results. Section V provides related work. Section VI 
concludes the paper with a brief summary and mention of 
future work. 
II. 
COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES 
In this section, we introduce the key technologies, the NC 
technique and constructive interference that we use in the 
proposed scheme. 
A. Network coding for cooperative communications 
Communication between the source and destination takes 
place through different paths by means of cooperating entities 
called relays. Among the relay techniques in wireless (multi-
hop and ad-hoc) networks, the decode-and-forward relaying 
method is used to decode the data that reaches the relay node 
and then re-encode and forward them. Another technique, the 
amplify-and-forward relaying method, can be selected as a 
simple forwarding mechanism. In the example shown in 
Figure 1, we focus on nodes 𝔸, 𝔹, and ℂ and presume that 𝔸 
and 𝔹 send 𝔸’s data of 𝑨 and 𝔹’s data of 𝑩, and ℂ exchanges 
them as relay nodes. In this case, the data transmission is 
completed in four steps: sending 𝑨 from 𝔸 to ℂ, sending 𝑩 
from 𝔹 to ℂ, forwarding 𝑨 from ℂ to 𝔹, and forwarding 𝑩 
from ℂ to 𝔸. The NC technique is used here with the aim of 
improving throughput. When ℂ transfers the bit-by-bit mixed 
data of 𝑨  and 𝑩  by utilizing an exclusive OR (XOR) 
operation, the data transmission procedure can be reduced to 
three steps: sending 𝑨 from 𝔸 to ℂ, sending 𝑩 from 𝔹 to ℂ, 
and forwarding 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩  from ℂ  to 𝔸  and 𝔹  during 
broadcasting. After receiving 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩, 𝔸  can restore 𝑩  by 
(𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩) ⊕ 𝑨, and 𝔹 can restore 𝑨 in the same manner. Note 
that ⊕ denotes the XOR operator. 
We note that if it is unnecessary for the relay node to know 
the exact source data, in other words, if the relay node does 
not need to cache the data, a physical-layer NC (PHY-NC) 
method can be adopted. In the PHY-NC method, the NC data 
is not decoded the individual data separately, and the 
combined signals are received simultaneously from two nodes 
into NC data. Therefore, general NC is introduced to decrease 
the number of required time slots to three, whereas PHY-NC 
can further reduce until two slots [11][12]. 
B. Constructive interference 
Wireless communications cause interference whenever 
spatially close nodes transmit concurrently, namely, when 
they generate signals that overlap in time and space, and share 
the same radio frequency. Interference is generally disruptive 
and lowers the probability of successful packet reception. In 
contrast, when interference is constructive, if receiver-side 
nodes can detect a superposition of baseband signals from 
multiple transmitter-side nodes, the interference can be 
ignored. Namely, the superposition of several tolerable out-
of-phase carrier signals enables correct detection with high 
probability. Constructive interference is especially useful 
when more than two nodes transmit concurrently. For instance, 
a flooding-based communication, such as in WSNs, is suitable 
and can propagate a packet for several (multi-hop) 
transmissions through the entire network without serious 
collisions. 
III. 
PROPOSED SCHEME 
ICN decouples the data from its original location using a 
name-based data-centric network scheme, which enables to 
cache and delivering the data regardless of the availability of 
the original (source) publisher. Moreover, ICN can provide 
content-based security, i.e., all security-sensitive information 
can be exchanged via the wireless channel. In this section, we 
provide an overview of the proposed scheme, including the 
proposed cooperative scheme, MAC protocol, and PHY 
protocol. 
A. Proposed cooperative communications scheme 
In-network caching—where each node duplicates the 
frequently used data by leveraging their embedded local 
(cache) storage—helps to decrease the end-to-end delay and 
reduce the network traffic. To accelerate the effect of in-
network caching in ICWSNs, the nodes should actively 
accumulate the data as cached data. One of the key features of 
a wireless communication system is an overhearing 
phenomenon in which neighbor nodes can receive data 
whether or not it is desired. For example, in Figure 2(a), when 
𝔸 sends 𝑨 to ℂ, 𝔽, and 𝔻 can also receive 𝑨; likewise, when 
𝔹 sends 𝑩 to ℂ, 𝔾 can also receive 𝑩. Therefore, the scheme 
achieves in-network caching for the nodes located along the

coding technqiue in the proposed scheme

routing path (on-path caching) as well as those around the 
routing path (off-path caching). 
For two-way network traffic, in other words, when the 
routing paths overlap in opposite directions, the NC technique 
can reduce the number of forwarded packets. In the relay 
phase, as shown in Figure 2(b), ℂ transmits 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩 instead of 
𝑨 or 𝑩. Here, due to the overhearing phenomena, 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩 
from ℂ can be received from 𝔸 and 𝔹 as well as from 𝔻 and 
𝔼. Therefore, as the assist phase in the proposed scheme, as 
shown in Figure 2(b), 𝔻 and 𝔼 also send 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩 as a helper 
with ℂ by performing multiplexing. As a result, if 𝔸 fails to 
receive 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩 from ℂ, it can be recovered by utilizing 𝑨 ⊕
𝑩 from 𝔻 due to the benefit of path diversity afforded through 
the different wireless channels. By using this mechanism, the 
nodes located around 𝔻 and 𝔼 but outside the coverage area 
of ℂ can be additionally off-path cached, which expands the 
number of new cashable nodes. 
To support the cooperative mechanism, each node has 
three phases: transmit, relay, and assist. Every node regularly 
maintains standby (e.g., 𝔽 and 𝔾), and the status is changed to 
the transmit phase when the node makes a data transmission 
request (e.g., 𝔸  and 𝔹 ). While receiving surrounding 
(overheard) data, if the node receives two different data which 
should be forwarded, the status moves to the relay phase (e.g., 
ℂ). However, if the received data is NC-encoded data, the 
status switches to the assist phase (e.g., 𝔻 and 𝔼). The details 
of the proposed scheme’s signal processing will be described 
in Section III.D. 
B. Proposed MAC protocol 
We assume the pure (unslotted) Aloha method is used as a 
channel access protocol in the MAC layer, which has been 
widely adopted as a channel access protocol in commercial 
low-power wide-area networks. An uncomplicated protocol is 
assumed to simplify the device implementation (including 
low-energy consumption), and because the synchronization 
among nodes is not practically available in ICWSNs. The 
current wireless communication systems using the pure-Aloha 
method presuppose that the data transmission has a 
sufficiently long interval, implying that collision or 
interference among nodes will not be fatal issues. However, 
as shown in Figure 3, in the proposed scheme, the relay nodes 
and assist nodes forward the NC-encoded data immediately 
(in the relay and assist phases), so collision and interference 
in a regional area are inevitable. 
The proposed scheme utilizes constructive interference to 
tackle the issues regarding collision and interference caused 
by forwarding multiple NC-encoded packets. Namely, as 
shown in Figure 3, if the received NC-encoded packets (e.g., 
𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩) are immediately forwarded in the assist phase, the 
interference of these packets (that are transmitted by 𝔻 and 𝔼) 
can be reduced. The primary reason that we assume an 
unsophisticated MAC protocol is to integrate the constructive 
interference effectively in the assist phase. In WSNs, 
constructive interference has not been extensively exploited 
because it is difficult to attain sufficiently accurate 
synchronization and highly predictable software delays are 
required. However, this approach is suitable for the scenarios 
in which the proposed scheme is applicable (i.e., in the relay 
and assist phases). Note that in cases where different data are 
in conflict with each other (destructive), the proposed scheme 
cannot be applied, which is beyond the scope of our present 
study.

C. Proposed PHY protocol 
In 
the 
modulation 
scheme 
of 
digital 
wireless 
communication systems, 𝐾 (= log2 𝑀) bits data are placed 
on the phase and/or amplitude of the transmitted waveform. 
Let 𝑇 denote the time period required to transmit one symbol 
of the 𝑀 -ary modulation method. In the baseband 
representation of the modulated waveform, a symbol 
(𝑠I, 𝑠Q) ∈ ℝ2 is defined as 
 
(𝑠I, 𝑠Q) ≜ (𝑠𝑖1, 𝑠𝑖2), (𝑖 = 1, 2, ⋯ , 𝑀) 
() 
where ℝ denotes the set of real numbers. A transmitted signal 
waveform, 𝑠(𝑡)(0 < 𝑡 < 𝑇) is then represented by 
 
𝑠(𝑡) = ℜ(  𝑥(𝑡) ej2π𝑓c𝑡  ) 
() 
where the operator ℜ(⋅) denotes real part, 𝑓c denotes a radio-
frequency (RF) carrier waveform, and 𝑥(𝑡) ≜ sI + j𝑠Q. 
On the receiver side, if we ignore the effects of multipath 
fading and shadowing for simplicity, the wireless link is 
characterized as an additive Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. 
Then, the received signal waveform 𝑦ℓ(𝑡) is expressed as  
 
𝑦ℓ(𝑡) = 𝑠(𝑡) + 𝑛ℓ(𝑡) 
() 
where 𝑛ℓ(𝑡)  is the AWGN, i.e., its (stochastic) random 
variable is depended on a normal distribution. During the relay 
and assist phases, the total signals received from the 𝐿 nodes 
with a minute offset τ is given by 
 
𝑦(𝑡) = ∑
𝑠(𝑡) δ(t − τℓ) + 𝑛ℓ(𝑡)
𝐿
ℓ=1
 
() 
where the operator δ(⋅) means time shift by τ.  
D. Signal processing of MAC and PHY protocols 
The signal processing procedure of the proposed scheme 
is shown in Figure 4(a). The data frame corresponding to the 
sensing data is temporarily stored in the buffer memories and 
is pending until allowed to transmit from the transmission 
controller, along with the cooperative communications’ data 
for the relay and assist phases. Figure 4(b) shows the states of 
the transmission controller: receive, transmit, relay, and assist. 
The transmit, relay, and assist states correspond to the three 
phases and append the receive state for standby. These states 
are switched depending on the state sequences (arrows 
between states) that are triggered by the radio events. When 
the node device needs to transmit the data, i.e., the data frame 
has arrived at the data buffer, the state is switched from 
receive to transmit, and then the data are sent. Similarly, while 
the node device is overhearing incoming data from the 
neighbors, when the NC-encoded data arrives, the state is 
switched from receive to assist. After data transmission is 
complete, it is switched back from the transmit or assist states 
to receive. 
Meanwhile, the transmission controller periodically 
checks the status of neighbor nodes and has the database 
regarding the combination of relayed nodes, e.g., ℂ should 
know 𝔸  and 𝔹  are the combinations of relayed nodes. 
Therefore, when the node device contains two data from the 
relayed nodes, it switches from receive to relay, and then it 
fulfills the relayed procedures. In this paper, we assume that 
every node knows whether it needs to relay the data, that the 
NC-encoded data’s number of multi-hops is predefined, and 
that the nodes can determine their upper limitation of 
forwarding in order to avoid unlimited hops. Note that, if the 
node device is not in the receive state, it cannot switch 
between the transmit, assist, and relay states. 
In the transmitter, as shown in Figure 4(a), the data frame 
is disassembled to the bit stream. Then the bit-based data are 
mapped into bit-to-symbols at the modulator (mapper) and 
superimposed on the RF carrier waveform to the antenna. In 
the receiver, the received signal is down-converted to the

baseband, demodulated, and detected, and then the recovered 
data are reconstructed to the data frame. The received data are 
classified as NC-encoded data or otherwise and respectively 
stored to data buffers. In addition, the error control coding 
(ECC) encoder and decoder are inserted between the frame 
(de)structure and (de)modulator if necessary. Unlike ordinal 
flooding mechanisms, the proposed scheme does not add any 
backoff, and the nodes transmit the same packet 
simultaneously immediately after the packet reception in the 
assist phase. By exploiting constructive interference 
phenomena, the proposed scheme can maintain a high packet 
reception rate despite allowing concurrent transmission. 
Therefore, if the received NC-encoded packets are forwarded 
immediately in the assist phase, the interference of packets 
transmitted will be reduced. 
IV. 
COMPUTER SIMULATION 
To evaluate the proposed scheme, we investigated the 
restorability of the baseband signal by using constructive 
interference and improvement in data caching among nodes. 
A. Simulation environment for PHY performance 
Assuming an experimental network composed of a relay 
node, an assist node, and a receiver node, we implemented a 
scenario in which the relay node and the assist node send the 
same data packet to the receiver node. In other words, it is the 
same as when ℂ sends the NC-encoded data in the relay phase, 
𝔻 and 𝔼 forward the data in the assist phase, and then 𝔸 
receives them (Figure 2). The computer simulation is 
conducted using the Matlab simulator. The waveforms of the 
radio signal arriving from the assist nodes are generated using 
the same data and system but with a time gap of τ. 
The frame length was set as 1,000 × log2 𝑀 bits, and the 
information bits were assigned by random values on the basis 
of the Bernoulli distribution with equal probability. 
Considering the wireless module to be installed in the WSN 
node device, the modulation scheme uses phase shift keying 
(PSK), in which the bits are superimposed on the phase of the 
carrier waveform. In particular, in (1), we consider 𝑀 = 2, 4, 
and 8 for 𝑀-ary PSK methods, i.e., BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK, 
respectively. In addition, the bit-to-symbol mapping rule was 
used based on the optimum mapping pattern (Gray code). To 
minimize the complexity of the simulation and evaluate the 
fundamental performance of the proposed scheme, we ignore 
the fading and shadowing as in (3) due to SN mobility (i.e., 
assuming SNs are statically deployed and utilized). Namely, 
the channel is dominated by AWGN, and we assume that the 
number of assist nodes, 𝐿 = 2 in (4), and their transmission 
power are the same parameters. We used a normalized signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) (that is, strictly SNR per bit or 𝐸𝑏/𝑁0) to 
represent the transmitted power in order to compare the 
performance of the different modulation schemes as a same 
condition. 
B. Comparison of modulation methods 
The simulation parameters are listed in Table I, and the 
result of bit error ratio (BER) performance of the different 
modulation methods are illustrated in Figure 5. The 
parameters are 1) type of modulation: BPSK, QPSK, and 8-

PSK, 2) time gap: τ = 0, (1/4) 𝑇, (1/2) 𝑇, and (3/4) 𝑇, and 3) 
SNR. The curves of BPSK and QPSK were overlapped (i.e., 
the result of BPSK and QPSK were the same) because their 
signal constellations (i.e., bit-to-symbol mapping pattern in 
(1)) are orthogonal. This indicates that the BPSK/QPSK 
methods are more effective than the 8-PSK method, and the 
major error mechanism is the time gap. 
In the BPSK and QPSK methods, the SNR for 10-3 BER 
are 3.8 dB, 5.7 dB, 9.2 dB, 15.2 dB, and the SNR for 10-5 BER 
are 6.6 dB, 8.8 dB, 12.3 dB, and 18.3 dB for τ = 0, (1/4) 𝑇, 
(1/2) 𝑇, and (3/4) 𝑇, respectively. In contrast, in the 8-PSK 
method, the SNR for 10-3 BER are 7.0 dB, 10.5 dB, and 
22.2 dB, and the SNR for 10-5 BER are 10 dB, 14.1 dB, and 
25.9 dB, respectively. In particular, the bit errors cannot be 
reducible (BER floor) in the case of 8-PSK with τ = (3/4) 𝑇, 
even if the SNR is set as very large. Therefore, when the 
transmission data rate is higher (i.e., 𝑀 is set as a large value), 
it is difficult to gain the effect of constructive interference. 
However, this is not a serious concern because the application 
service in which the proposed scheme will be deployed does 
not 
require 
high-speed 
and 
high-capacity 
wireless 
communications. 
To investigate the effect of τ on the proposed scheme, in 
Figure 6, the results of the BER performance when τ is varied.  
The major parameters are considered as follows: 1) type of 
modulation: BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK, 2) SNR: 5 dB, 7 dB, 
and 10 dB, and τ. Increasing τ leads to a BER degradation, 
and the BER curve is not linear, i.e., the gradient of the BER 
curve becomes gradually relaxed, this means the effect on the 
 
Figure 7. Perforamnce of teceiver-side detector, including constellation diagram and eye diagram, for received signals with a time lag.

BER should be significantly considered in the region where τ 
is as small as possible. 
C. Received signal for detection 
In the receiver, Figure 7 shows a received signal to be 
handled, i.e., the signal to be demodulated and detected. The 
parameters are 1) type of modulation: BPSK, QPSK, and 8-
PSK, 2) time gap: τ = 0, (1/4) 𝑇, (1/2) 𝑇, and (3/4) 𝑇, 3) SNR 
set as 10 dB, and 4) the constellation and eye pattern 
(diagram) of the received signal. The results of the detector’s 
performance indicate that the cases of τ = 0, (1/2) 𝑇, and 
(1/2) 𝑇  had a clearly separated constellation of received 
signals and a clear eye pattern, while τ = (3/4) 𝑇 had the 
opposite result and thus the detector could not decide 
(estimate) the transmitted data. This result is also well linked 
to the effects of τ  on bit error probability, as shown in 
Figures 5 and 6. 
D. Effect of error control coding scheme 
In general, wireless communication systems mitigate 
packet errors using automatic repeat request and forward error 
correction. The former is out of scope in this paper because 
we particularly focus on the relay and assist phases, while the 
latter is considered in this section. If a powerful ECC scheme 
is adopted, the processing delay will increase significantly. 
This leads to an increasing τ, which is detrimental to the 
proposed scheme. In addition, as the aforementioned results 
show, the BPSK method performs more noise resistance (in 
terms of bit error probability) than other methods, and it is 
commonly used in the node devices (i.e., that is supported as 
a basic modulation method) that consist of the application 
services in which the proposed scheme is deployed. Therefore, 
the simulation parameters are listed in Table II, and the results 
of bit error probability with and without the ECC method in 
the BPSK method are shown in Figure 8. The parameters are 
1) type of modulation: BPSK, 2) type of ECC scheme: un-
coded and convolutional code with Viterbi decoding scheme, 
3) time gap: τ = 0, (1/4) 𝑇, (1/2) 𝑇, and (3/4) 𝑇, and 4) SNR. 
The results illustrate that for τ = 0, (1/4) 𝑇, (1/2) 𝑇, and 
(3/4) 𝑇, thanks to introducing the ECC scheme, the SNR for 
10-3 BER can improve by 2.0 dB, 2.5 dB, 3.2 dB, and 3.4 dB, 
and the SNR for 10-5 BER can improve by 3.2 dB, 3.8 dB, 
4.1 dB, and 4.1 dB, respectively. Meanwhile, in the regions 
with small SNR (less than 0.5 dB, 1.7 dB, 3.8 dB, and 9.0 dB 
for τ = 0, (1/4) 𝑇, (1/2) 𝑇, and (3/4) 𝑇), BER performance 
with ECC cannot be improved; thus, there is no advantage to 
using the ECC scheme in these SNR regions.  
E. Effectiveness of proposed scheme 
To illustrate the benefit of the proposed scheme, we 
performed another evaluation using computer simulation 
implemented in C++ language. This simulation aims to 
illustrate that the proposed scheme can assist in maximizing 
the number of nodes with caching data. In the simulation, 
10,000 nodes were deployed in a 1-km2 area, the 
communication range of the nodes was set to 100 m, and the 
unreachable probability of the data (i.e., packet error ratio) 
was set to 5%. In the conventional scheme, the relay node 
forwards the NC-encoded data three times, whereas in the 
proposed scheme, the assist nodes that receive the NC-
encoded data forward at the same time as the relay node. 
Because the assist nodes that receive the first-forwarded data 
from the relay station will transmit the data twice, and the 
nodes that receive the second-forwarded data will transmit 
them once. The end of the assist phase can align with the end

of the relay phase, and the proposed scheme can prevent 
infinite data flooding. 
As seen in Figure 9(a), the number of successfully cached 
nodes per 10,000 was improved by 43.5% as a result of the 
assist nodes. For spreading the NC-encoded data, as shown in 
Figure 9(b), when the forwarding trials were increased, the 
nodes were enhanced by 306% and 123% for the proposed 
scheme compared to just 4.98% and 0.234% for the 
conventional scheme. At the end of the relay and assist phases, 
the proposed scheme could cache 8.61 times as many nodes 
as the conventional one. Note that to decode the NC-encoded 
data, plain data is required, e.g., either 𝑨 or 𝑩 for 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩.

RELATED WORK 
The combination of NC and ICN has become a growing 
research interest. Montpetit et al. [13] utilized this 
combination in the internetworking layer by applying the NC 
technique to enhance the performance of data forwarding in 
ICNs. Mekbungwan et al. [14] proposed an NC-based data 
dissemination system made up of bulk data, such as photos, 
maps, and databases for situational awareness in post-disaster 
areas. Their system design was based on the store-carry-and-
forward method in delay-torrent networking store-carry-and-
forward method in order to reduce the amount of network 
traffic on relay nodes. For next-generation cellular networks, 
the packet duplication method is being introduced to meet the 
99.999% reliability requirement, where the original packet 
and its duplicate are transmitted via two different physical 
paths, the concept of which is the same as the path-diversity 
technique [15]. However, the radio resource consumption is 
proportional to the number of data copies, and this duplication 
of data caching leads to a significant waste of radio resources. 
To tackle this problem, Zhu et al. [16] proposed a task-
oriented communication method in which the waveform 
superposition property of a wireless channel is exploited to 
achieve over-the-air aggregation of data simultaneously 
transmitted by devices. The idea of overlaying signals can be 
seen as a kind of NC in the physical layer.

CONCLUSION 
We proposed a cooperative communication scheme using 
the NC technique with constructive interference for ICWSNs. 
The numerical results of our initial evaluation of the scheme 
indicated that a small gap of signals could be tolerated, and 
the proposed scheme could contribute to the distribution of 
cached data. In future work, because the recoverability of the 
received data depends on the signal gaps of the forwarded data, 
we should further investigate a technique that separates them. 
Moreover, we will expand the practical scenarios in which our 
scheme can be implemented to enhance the quality of service, 
lifetime, and robustness of the real smart-city site.
