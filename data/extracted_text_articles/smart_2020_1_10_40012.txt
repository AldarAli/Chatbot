Abstract—This paper introduces blockchain services for 
Mobility As A Service (MAAS) infrastructures, allowing to use 
public or private modes of transport during a trip. The 
blockchain system interacts with three classes of blockchain 
accounts: User, MAAS, and transport operators. It details 
some possible scenari 
and associated transactions. It 
demonstrates that this concept is realistic with emerging and 
existing technologies.

INTRODUCTION
The Mobility As A Service (MAAS, [1]) is an emerging 
concept, born in 2014 in Finland [2], allowing to use public 
or private modes of transport during a trip (see Figure 1). It 
involves the unification of mobility services, and a fusion of 
ticketing and multimodal information tools. According to [2] 
"The ecosystem consists of the transport infrastructure, 
transportation services, transport information and payment 
services". 
Figure 1. Mobility As A Service, MAAS 
In this smart city context [10], many modes of transport 
are implemented such as bicycles, electric scooters, scooters, 
electric cars, buses, metro, and taxis. Some of them 
(generally private) rely on mobile applications associated 
with bank cards; others require tickets delivered by dedicated 
machines or subscription cards. In Helsinki, the WHIM app 
[9] offers several subscriptions; for example a monthly 
package of 499 Euros, including unlimited public transport, 
taxis (up to 5 km), car-sharing and cycling. 
In this paper we introduce the concept of blockchain 
services for MAAS. The MAAS is a federation of transport 
operators, managing ticketing services and validators. The 
main idea is to store these tickets in blockchain interacting 
with several entities (transport operator, user, MASS 
operators) as illustrated by Figure 2. 
The paper is constructed according to the following 
outline. Section 2 presents blockchain benefits for MAAS, 
and some existing concepts. Section 3 introduces our use 
case. Section 4 details the functional architecture. Finally 
section 5 concludes this paper.

STATE OF ART
The first blockchain was deployed in 2009 by Satoshi 
Nakamoto [3], an anonymous creator (or group of creators). 
Bitcoin has had remarkable success, with a price reaching 
$20,000 at the end of 2017, for a valuation of $ 340 billion. 
Originally the blockchain carried out the transfer of crypto 
currency, but since 2015, several platforms appeared, such as 
Ethereum [4] or Hyperledger, which also allow the exchange 
of data or the execution of programs (smart contracts) 
charged in crypto currency. 
The services delivered by a blockchain are as follows: 

Generation of signed transactions: 

Gathering of transactions by a P2P (Peer To Peer) 
network;


Creation of transaction blocks by nodes of the P2P 
network. 

Chaining a new block to the existing block list (the 
blockchain), according to a consensus mechanism 
such as PoW (Proof of Work) or PoS (Proof of 
Stake). 
The main contribution of blockchain is the creation of 
trust, based on consensus, i.e., there is no trusted third party. 
Transactions are authenticated by cryptographic signatures 
and are time-stamped, when they are mined (i.e., inserted in 
a block). The database storing these blocks is very widely 
duplicated in nodes of the P2P network; WEB APIs allow 
ubiquitous and secure access to data hosted by the 
blockchain infrastructure. 
In the absence of a trusted third party, participants 
generate their keys. A private key is usually a 32 bytes (256 
bits) random number, from which a public key and the 
blockchain account identifier are calculated. Blockchain is 
by nature based on a consensus of players, and therefore 
could be the technological cornerstone of the new MAAS 
mobility, bringing together multiple players.  
An example of this concept is the "planar networks" 
project [5], which uses Ethereum smart contracts (see Figure 
3), for implementation of universal ticketing system. 
Figure 3. The planar networks project uses Smart Contracts for 
implementation of universal ticketing system. 
The creation of crypto currencies dedicated to MAAS is 
also an opportunity. The DOVU project [6] deploys a crypto 
currency (see Figure 4) dedicated to multimodal mobility 
services.

USE CASE
This section details an experimental implementation of 
the concept of "Blockchain for MAAS". The latter uses the 
ROPSTEN (Ethereum) test blockchain, a Near Field 
Communication (NFC) chip card performing transaction 
signature, and free software (BTOOLS [7]).

Blockchain Ticket 
Figure 5. A French SNCF ticket 
In order to clarify our approach, we consider the e-ticket 
illustrated in Figure 5. Reading the QR-Code (located at the 
top right) by a dedicated validator allows access to the 
mobility service. The ticket (content of the QR code) is a 
series of ASCII characters illustrated by the left part of 
Figure 6.

Blockchain MASS entiies 
Three types of blockchain accounts are involved in 
MAAS: 

User accounts, using addresses, deduced from 
previously generated private keys.  

MAAS entities, identified by their addresses. 

Transport operators, identified by their addresses. 
Figure 7 lists the MAAS actors (MASS entity, user, 
transport operator), and their associated addresses in the 
ROPSTEN blockchain. Transactions can be retrieved at [11].

FUNCTIONNAL ARCHITECTURE
The functional architecture of MAAS is illustrated in 
Figure 8. Three types of services are supported, the ticket 
generation, the ticket transfer to user, and the ticket use in a 
transport network. 
Figure 8. Functionnal Architecture 
A.
Ticket Generation 
Figure 9. Ticket generation from the transport operator to the MASS. 
The basic idea is to store the ticket in the blockchain 
account of the MAAS entity. Two modes of ticket generation 
are possible: 

Option 1: the transport operator generates the ticket 
in a transaction, whose recipient is the MAAS entity. 
This option is illustrated in Figure 9. This transaction 
can be retrieved at [12].  

Option 2: MAAS generates the ticket in a self 
addressed transaction. This transaction is illustrated 
in Figure 10; it can be retrieved from [13]. 
Figure 10. Ticket generation from the MASS to MASS. 
B.
Ticket Transfer to User 
The MAAS transfers the ticket to the client in a 
transaction, as illustrated in Figure 11. The ticket is 
thereafter stored in the client's blockchain account. This 
transaction can be retrieved at [14].

C.
Ticket Use 
The user is equipped with a Near Field Communication 
(NFC) card or a Host Card Emulation (HCE) smartphone. 
The NFC card (possibly virtual) hosts the private key 
associated to the blockchain account, and is able of carrying 
out the transaction signature.

Figure 12. Illustration of the CheckIn scenario. 
In an off-line approach (Checkin scenario, see Figure 12), 
the NFC card stores a ticket linked to an address, whose 
authenticity is proven by a signature, calculated using the 
private key. The user's blockchain address can be associated 
with a certificate issued by the MAAS, if a static 
authentication mechanism (off-line) is required. 
In an on-line approach (TapIn, TapOut scenario), similar 
to payment by contactless bank card in the London 
Underground, proof of customer identity is required at the 
start and end of the mobility service. The ticket (or contract) 
can be stored in the MAAS account, or paid by using a 
dedicated crypto currency.

Checkin Transaction. 
Figure 14. Illustration of a Checkin Transaction  
Figure 14 illustrates a transaction between user and 
MAAS entity which contains the ticket. It can be retrieved at 
[15]. This latter is authenticated by the signature generated 
using the private key bound to the user account. 
2)
TapIn, TapOut Transactions. 
Figures 15 and 16 illustrate respectively the TapIn and 
TapOut procedures. These transactions can be respectively 
retrieved at [15] and [16]. A self transaction, addressed to the 
user, proves its identity, and is thereafter time stamped by the 
blockchain infrastructure

CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented a blockchain infrastructure 
dedicated to MAAS services, which comprises three actors, 
MAAS entity, transport operator and user. A ticket can be 
generated in MAAS to MASS transaction or in transport

operator to MAAS transaction. The MAAS transfers this 
ticket to user account. Validators of the transportation system 
check ticket according to two operating modes CheckhIn and 
TapIn-TapOut. In the first mode the user generates a 
transaction to the MAAS entity in which the ticket in 
inserted; the ticket is bound to user’s identity and its use is 
time stamped by the blockchain. In the second mode the user 
proves its blockchain identity by self-addressed transaction; 
thereafter the transport system checks its subscription. 
In summary blockchain could create very attractive 
technological platform for MAAS services, due to the lack of 
third trusted party. Nevertheless such infrastructures should 
provide the required level of performances.
