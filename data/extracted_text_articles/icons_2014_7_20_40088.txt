Abstract—This paper presents a robust wind estimation 
scheme for a simple tethersonde system, which is to use a 
commercially available radiosonde for recalibration 
and 
recovery. A radiosonde system determines wind speed and 
direction by keeping track of the radiosonde’s position as it rises. 
However, the method used in the radiosonde system is not 
suitable for the tethersonde system due to tethering to the ground. 
Hence, the proposed scheme introduces a drag force caused by 
the movement of the tethersonde to estimate the wind speed. This 
paper also evaluates the scheme through simulation in terms of 
wind speed estimation. Simulation results show that a radiosonde 
can be utilized as a tethersonde for the low and middle 
atmospheric observation without modification.

I. INTRODUCTION  
A radiosonde is used in measuring vertical profiles of 
atmospheric temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and 
wind direction as a balloon ascends through the atmosphere. 
The balloon typically rises up to an altitude of 35 km from the 
ground at a rate of a few meters per second. As the balloon 
ascends, it expands and eventually bursts, and then the 
radiosonde falls to the ground. Therefore, a radiosonde is not 
desirable for repeated calibration checks and repeated 
measurement because the system is discarded after once use [1], 
[2], [3].  
On the other hand, a tethersonde is attached to the ground 
so that the limitations of a radiosonde can be mitigated by 
tethering to the ground. A tethersonde, in general, is to measure 
near the surface atmosphere up to an altitude of 1500 m and 
provides repeated calibration and measurement by adjusting 
the length of the tether line. Thus, detailed vertical profiles of 
meteorological atmosphere in the boundary layer can be 
obtained [4], [5]. A radiosonde system determines wind speed 
and direction by keeping track of its position through the use of 
global positioning system (GPS) receiver [6], [7]. However, 
unlike other parameters, the wind measurement method used in 
a radiosonde system is not appropriate for a tethersonde system 
because the tethersonde cannot move along the wind due to the 
tethering.  
For this reason, this paper presents a simple and robust 
wind estimation scheme for a tethersonde system. The scheme 
firstly computes elevation and azimuth angles from the position 
of the tethersonde. Then, the wind speed is determined based 
on the drag force and the elevation angle calculated from the 
force balance principle. The rest of this paper is organized as 
follows. In Section II, we describe system overview. Next, the 
wind speed and direction estimation algorithm is described in 
Section III. After that we analyze the proposed scheme in terms 
of wind speed estimation by simulation in Section IV. Finally, 
we conclude this paper in Section V. 
II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW  
A tethersonde system consists of a tethersonde, a balloon 
and tether line, and a ground receiver system, as shown in Fig. 
1. The scheme is to utilize a radiosonde as a tethersonde with 
or without modification. The tethersonde is equipped with 
sensors that measure temperature, air pressure, humidity, and 
GPS receiver to find its location. It periodically measures 
atmospheric parameters and transmits the parameters to the 
ground system in the 400 to 406 MHz meteorological band. As 
the tethersonde ascends, it reports in real time the temperature, 
humidity, pressure, and its position every second.  
The ground system receives the data transmitted from the 
tethersonde and processes them in a personal computer (PC). 
Then, the PC estimates wind speed and direction by keeping 
track of the position of the tethersonde. The balloon and tether 
line are to suspend the tethersonde and to control its height by 
winding and unwinding the line. After observation, the 
tethersonde and balloon are recovered by winding the line.

III. WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION ESTIMATION ALGORITHM 
To analyze the movement of a tethersonde caused by wind, 
a spherical coordinate system is considered. The coordinate 
system consists of the radius r, the elevation angle θ, and the 
azimuth angle φ, as shown in Fig. 2. In the figure, the 
tethersonde is released at the origin point at time 0, p(x,y,z)0, 
and after a time t the tethersonde is at a position, p(x,y,z)t.  
Once a tethersonde is launched, it travels horizontally at the 
same speed of the wind while the tether line is unwinding. 
When the tether line is released up to its maximum length, the 
tethersonde travels on the surface of the sphere whose radius is 
equal to the length of the line. Thus, the movement of a 
tethersonde can be classified into two stages, releasing stage 
and tethering stage.

radial distance, elevation angle, and azimuth angle , respectively. 
A. Releasing Stage Analysis 
Once a tethersonde is released into the atmosphere, the 
sonde is to rise by a lift force. The lift force consists of buoyant 
force and drag force, Fb and Fd. Consider that Fb includes the 
gravity force mg of the balloon, tethersonde and tether line. 
Then, the buoyant and gravity forces are calculated from 
approximately simultaneous tethersonde soundings.  
Similarly, the drag force is equal and opposite direction of 
the buoyant force. Since Fd = -Fb, the drag force can be 
determined by evaluating the buoyant force, which is readily 
calculated from the available data. The average density of the 
air is obtained from approximately simultaneous radiosonde 
soundings, and the cross sectional balloon is known. Then, the 
average lift force and lift speed of the balloon are defined as,

where ρ is the density of air, Vb is the lift speed caused by the 
buoyant force, Cd is the drag coefficient, and A is the cross 
sectional area of the balloon.  
Let Vl be the average lift speed over the measurement 
period T, which denotes the difference between time t and t-1. 
Then, Vl is given by the equation,

 According to (2) and (3), it is clear that the wind has an 
ascending air current if Vl is greater than Vb and a descending 
air current if Vl(t) is less than Vb .  
On the other hand, when the tethersonde is moved from 
p(x,y,z)t-1 to p(x,y,z)t, the horizontal wind speed and direction, 
Vw and  φw can be expressed as,

The values of p(x,y,z)t are known since they measured 
every second. With the information, the horizontal wind speed 
and direction can be estimated by (4) and (5). 
B. Tethering Stage Analysis 
When the tether line is released up to the maximum length, 
the tethersonde travels on the surface of the sphere whose 
radius equal to the maximum length of the line. Fig. 3 
represents the relation among buoyant, wind, and tension 
forces in the tethering stage, where the tethersonde stays at a 
point or moves on the surface of the sphere. The tethering stage 
can also be divided into two states, steady state and dynamic 
state, depending on the position changes of the tethersonde.  
Fig. 3 (a) shows the relation of the string tension FT to wind 
force and buoyant force in the steady state, which is

The cross sectional areas in (2) and (7) may be different 
depending on the directions, vertical side and horizontal side. 
On the other hand, in the dynamic state, the balloon is being 
moved from p(x,y,z)t-1 to p(x,y,z)t during the measurement 
period, as shown in Fig. 3(b). When the tethersonde moves 
through the air, a drag force acts opposite direction to the 
movement 
of 
the 
tethersonde. The relation between 
acceleration and net force is given by Newton’s second law of 
motion,

stage, where a tethersonde moves on the surface of the sphere. 
C. Wind  Estimation  Algorithm  
From the analysis, the wind speed and direction can be 
determined in the tethersonde system, as shown in Fig. 4. In the 
system, the GPS receiver in the tethersonde periodically reports 
its longitude, latitude, altitude, and wind speed. The ground 
receiver system then calculates the distance R between the 
origin point and current point from the received data. 
Depending on R, the algorithm goes into either the releasing 
stage or tethering stage. When the variation of wind speed is 
small enough, the algorithm may perform the wind estimation 
method of the steady state. On the other hand, although the 
algorithm may cause some error whenever the stages are 
changed, the error can be recovered in the steady state.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
To verify the proposed scheme, we considered simulation 
parameters similar to a radiosonde as described in Table I. 
From the parameters, we can obtain buoyant force, lift speed 
caused by buoyant force and the radius of the sphere.  
Fig. 5 shows the wind speed versus flight time and the trace 
of tethersonde in a spherical coordinate system. It was tested 
with the actual measurement data taken by a radiosonde system 
in a fine day at a location of longitude 127 o(E) and latitude 
37o(N). The measurement data include measurement time, 
latitude, longitude, altitude, and wind speed. The distance from 
origin to the tethersonde, elevation angle, azimuth angle, and 
lift speed variation are calculated from the measurement data. 
In Fig. 5(b), until flight time 270 seconds, the position trace is 
plotted from the measurement data. After then, the position

correspond to each other. Table II represents the detailed 
values of the three points. For example, the red circle indicates 
270 seconds of flight time, 611 m of horizontal distance, 1370 
m of altitude, and 4.2 m/s of wind speed. After 270 seconds, 
the tethersonde moves on the surface of the sphere according to 
the wind speed and direction. For example, the green triangle 
shows that the wind speed is increased up to 7.0 m/s at time 
469 seconds.   
The figure shows that the tethersonde moves up and down

Accordingly, the radius of the sphere is adjustable by 
changing the length of the tether line. In a similar manner, the 
scheme provides more detailed vertical profiles in the low and 
middle atmosphere by repeatedly winding and unwinding the 
tether line.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, a robust wind estimation scheme for a simple 
tethersonde system has been presented, which utilizes a 
commercial radiosonde as a tethersonde for the low and middle 
atmospheric observation. A radiosonde is not desirable for 
recalibration and recovery due to discarding after use. To 
mitigate the limitations, the proposed scheme is to use the 
radiosonde by tethering to the ground for ascending and 
descending. However, although the atmospheric measurement 
techniques in the radiosonde are useful, the method for wind 
speed and direction measurement is not suitable for the 
tethersonde system.  
The proposed scheme determines wind speed and direction 
by adopting a drag force in the dynamic state when the 
tethersonde moves on the surface of the sphere. Simulation 
results show that the scheme can be used in a simple 
tethersonde system for wind speed and direction measurement 
without additional wind sensor. The scheme also provides 
more detailed vertical meteorological profiles of the low and 
middle atmosphere by winding and unwinding the tether line. 
In addition, the observation altitude is extendable more than 
1500 m just by increasing of the length of the tether line.  
Further studies are needed to analyze the impact of tether 
line on wind speed estimation and verify the scheme under 
various environment conditions.
