Abstract—In this paper, we investigate a Lyapunov’s inequality
for a non-linear fractional differential equation, subject to the non
linear integral boundary condition. Such boundary conditions
are different from the ones widely considered for a class of
Lyapunov’s inequality. The main tools are the Fubini’s theorem
and the construction of the Green function which corresponds
to the given problem in consideration. In order to illustrate this
result, we give an example where we show that the non existence
of non trivial solutions of an appropriate eigenvalue fractional
boundary value problem obey this necessary integral condition.
Index Terms—Lyapunov’s inequality, non linear boundary
condition, Caputo fractional derivative, Green function.
I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we present a Lyapunov’s inequality for the
following boundary value problem:



(cDαu)(t) + q(t)u(t) = 0,
a < t < b,
0 < α ≤ 1,
u(a) + µ
R b
a u(s)q(s) ds = u(b),
(1)
where q is a continuous function deﬁned on [a, b] to R, a and b
are consecutive zeros of the solution u and µ is positive. cDα
stands for the Caputo derivative. It is evident to the reader to
see that u = 0 is a trivial solution, and therefore only non-
negative solutions are taken in consideration.
We prove that problem (1) has a non-trivial solution for α ∈
(0, 1] provided that the real and continuous function q satisﬁes
Z b
a
|q(t)| dt >
Γ(α)µα(b − a)
α(b − a + µ)(αµ + 1)(α−1)
(2)
The investigation of Lyapunov’s inequalities has begun very
recently, where the ﬁrst differential equation is based on
fractional differential operators as well as that of Ferreira. In
order to start with this new result, let us dwell with some
references.
 u′′(t) + q(t)u(t) = 0,
a < t < b
u(a) = u(b) = 0,
where a and b are consecutive zeros of u and the function
q ∈ C([a, b]; R). Lyapunov [1] showed the following neces-
sary condition of existence of non-trivial solutions
Z b
a
|q(t)| dt >
4
b − a.
(3)
Once this result is proved, similar type inequalities have been
obtained for other kind of differential equations and boundary
conditions see [2], [3], [4], [5].
Concerning differential equation with fractional derivative’s in
[6], Ferreira derived Lyapunov’s inequality for the problem



(aDαu)(t) + q(t)u(t) = 0,
a < t < b, 1 < α ≤ 2,
u(a) = u(b) = 0,
(4)
where q ∈ C([a, b], R), a and b are consecutive zeros of u, and
aDα is the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of order
α > 0 deﬁned for an absolute continuous function on [a, b] by
(aDαf)(t) =
1
Γ(1 − α)
dn
dtn
Z t
a
(t − s)αf(s) ds
where n ∈ N, n < α ≤ n + 1 (For more details of fractional
derivatives see [7]). The corresponding necessary condition of
existence that he proved in [6] reads
Z b
a
|q(t)| dt > Γ(α)

4
b − a
α−1
=
Γ(α)
(5)

22(α−1)
(b − a)(α−1)

,
which in the particular case α = 2 corresponds to Lyapunov’s
classical inequality (1) see [1].
Then, Ferreira [8] dealt with fractional differential boundary
value problems with Caputo’s derivative which is deﬁned for
a function f ∈ ACn[a, t] by
(C
a Dαf)(t) =
1
Γ(1 − α)
Z t
a
(t − s)αf (n)(s) ds.

For the boundary value problem

(C
a Dαu)(t) + q(t)u(t) = 0,
a < t < b, 1 < α ≤ 2,
u(a) = u(b) = 0,
(6)
where q ∈ C([a, b]; R) and a and b are consecutive zeros of
u, Ferreira [6] proved that if (6) has a nontrivial solution, then
the following necessary condition is satisﬁed
Z b

II. MAIN RESULTS
The aim of this section is to investigate the necessary
condition of existence of non trivial solutions of the given
boundary value problem (1). To do this, we need to use the
two following auxiliary lemmas.
Lemma 1: [7], [5] Let α > 0, then the differential equation
cDαh(t) = 0
has solutions h(t) = c0 + c1t + c2t2 + ... + cn−1tn−1,
ci ∈ R, i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n − 1, n = [α] + 1.
Lemma 2: [7], [5] Let α > 0, then
Iα
c Dαh(t) = Iαh(t) + c0 + c1t + c2t2 + ... + cn−1tn−1
for some ci ∈ R, i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n − 1, n = [α] + 1.
III. A LYAPUNOV-TYPE INEQUALITY FOR PROBLEM (1)
In order to prove the corresponding Lyapunov-type in-
equality for the non linear integral fractional boundary value
problem (1), let us re-write the considered problem in its
equivalent integral form. Indeed, the next lemma formulates
this fact.
Lemma 3: The solution u of (1) can be written in the integral
form as
u(t) =
Z t
a
G(t, s)q(s)u(s) ds +
Z b
t
G(t, s)q(s)u(s) ds,
where the Green function G(x, t) is deﬁned by
Γ(α)G(t, s) =

where g(t, s) :=
(b−s)α
(b−a)αΓ(α) −
(b−s)α−1
µ(b−a)Γ(α), for a ≤ t ≤ s ≤ b.
For the proof of Lemma 3, we use Lemma 1 and 2 to express
u(t) as
u(t) = c0 + c1(t − a) + c2(t − a)2 + ... + cn−1(t − a)n−1,
for some ci ∈ R, i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n − 1, from one side. From
another side, we have
Iα
c Dαu(t) = Iαu(t) + c0 + c1t + c2t2 + ... + cn−1tn−1.
In particular for 0 < α ≤ 1, we obtain
u(t) = Iαu(t) − c0 =
Z t
a
(t − s)α−1
Γ(α)
h(s)ds − c0,
(10)
where h(s) = u(s)q(s), for some constant c0 in R.
We make integration of each side of (10) between a and b,
and using Fubini’s integral theorem, we get
Z b
a
h(s) ds =
Z b
a
(b − τ)α
αΓ(α) h(τ)dτ − c0(b − a).
(11)
Employing the boundary condition (1), we obtain
u(a) = −c0,
(12)
and
u(b) =
Z b
a
(b − s)α−1
Γ(α)
h(s)ds − c0.
(13)
Now combining (1), (11) and (13) we get

Making insertion of (14) into (10) we ﬁnd

Therefore the Green function of the given fractional boundary
problem is obtained as described in (9). The next theorem is
an essential tool to prove the main theorem of the paper
Theorem 1: The Green function G satisﬁes:
(1)
G(t, s) ≥ 0
for all
a ≤ t, s ≤ b.
(2) maxt ∈ [a,b] G(t, s) = G(b, s),
s ∈ [a, b],
(3) G(b, s) has a unique maximum given by:
max
s ∈ [a,b] G(b, s) = α(b − a + µ)(αµ + 1)(α−1)
µα(b − a)αΓ(α)
,
provided that
0 < µ(b − a) < α.
For the proof of Theorem 1, we start by deriving the
function G(t, s) with respect to t, for s ≤ t, as follows
∂G
∂t = −(α − 1)(t − s)α−2
Γ(α)
,

which is positive since 0 < α ≤ 1. Thus, the Green function
G is increasing as a function of t. We have
G(s, s) < G(t, s) < G(b, s).
Let us start with the right hand side of this last inequality
which is G(b, s), and denote it by H(s). Then, we have
H(s) := G(b, s)
=
(b − s)α−1
Γ(α)
−
(b − s)α
(b − a)αΓ(α)
+
(b − s)α−1
µ(b − a)αΓ(α)Γ(α).
Deriving H with respect to s, we get
H′(s) = (αµ + 1)(b − s)α−1 − µ(b − s)α.
We may observe that H′ is equal to zero for s = b− αµ+1
µ
:=
s∗, and H′ is positive for s < s∗ and negative for s > s∗. We
conclude that the maximum of H is achieved at s = s∗. To
this end the maximum of the Green function G is attained at
s = s∗ and therefore
max
s≤t G(b, s) = G(b, s∗) = α(b − a + µ)(αµ + 1)(α−1)
µα(b − a)αΓ(α)
.
For the positivity of G, we consider G(s, s) as a function of
s deﬁned by:
K(s) := G(s, s) = −
(b − s)α
(b − a)αΓ(α) +
(b − s)α−1
µ(b − a)Γ(α).
Deriving K with respect to s, we obtain
K′(s) = µα(b − s)α−1 − α(α − 1)(b − s)α−2
µ(b − a)αΓ(α)
which is positive in view of 0 < α ≤ 1, and µ > 0. In
other terms, the function K is an increasing function of s and
therefore K satisﬁes
K(s) > K(a) := µα(b − a)α−1 − α(α − 1)(b − a)α−2
µ(b − a)αΓ(α)
.
Now, in light of the assumption of the Theorem 1, h(a) is a
positive function in a which leads the Green function G to be
positive. We note, in turn, that we derive G(t, s) with respect
to t for s ≥ t, we obtain:
∂G
∂t = −∂g
∂t = 0.
(17)
Thus, the maximum of G is achieved at s = s∗ for all s, t in
[a, b].
Finally, we are now ready to prove the aim of this paper
which is Lyapunov’s inequality for the non integral boundary
fractional boundary problem (1).
Theorem 2: Let u be a non trivial solution satisfying the
following boundary value problem



(aDαu)(t) + q(t)u(t) = 0,
a < t < b, 0 < α ≤ 1,
u(a) + µ
R b
a h(s) ds = u(b),
(18)
where a and b are two consecutive zeros of u and µ is a
positive constant in R. Then (18) has a non-trivial solution
provided that the real and continuous function q satisﬁes the
following integral condition
Z b
a
|q(t)| dt >
Γ(α)µα(b − a)
α(b − a + µ)(αµ + 1)(α−1) ,
(19)
provided that
0 < µ(b − a) < α.
For the proof of Theorem 2, we equip the
Banach space C[a, b] with the Chebychev norm
||u|| = maxt∈[a,b] |u(t)|.
As
u(t) :=
Z b
a
G(t, s)q(s)u(s) ds,
we have
||u|| ≤
Z b
a
max
t,s ∈[a,b] |G(t, s)| |q(s)| ds ||u||.
Then since u is a non trivial solution, in view of Theorem 1,
we get
1 ≤
Z b
a

Γ(α)
α(b − a + µ)(αµ + 1)(α−1)

|q(s)| ds.
Using the properties of G, the inequality (19) is obtained.
IV. APPLICATION
In order to illustrate Theorem 2, we give an application of
Lyapunov-type inequality (19) for the following eigenvalue
problem and we will get a bound for λ for which the
boundary value problem in consideration has a non trivial
solution. Precisely, we will show how the necessary condition
of existence can be employed to determine intervals for the
real zeros of the Mittag-Leffeler function.

For the proof of Theorem 3, it is sufﬁcient to use the integral
inequality (19). We assume that, if λ is an eigenvalue of
the boundary value problem (21), then there exists only one
