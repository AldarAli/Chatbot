Abstract— In this paper, we present a novel binary threshold
sensor, which is able to use the energy provided directly from
the
measured
relative
humidity
of
the
ambient
air
to
mechanically switch an electrical micro contact. This zero-
power switch behavior is realized by using the humidity-
sensitive volume swelling of a polymer layer as the detection
element deflecting a mechanical deformable silicon boss
structure, thus closing the electrical contacts of the switch. For
the
humidity-sensitive
sensor
switch
considered
here,
a
hydrogel blend of 15 wt% poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and 7.5
wt% poly(acryl acid) (PAA) was used. According to first
swelling experiments with a prototype the provided deflection
of approximately 36 μm of a 20 μm thin silicon flexure plate
seems very promising.

INTRODUCTION
The demand for improved processes in industry and the
personal environment of humans requires better sensors. As
a consequence, sensor industry has been growing in average
by 8 % per year since almost three decades. Remarkably, 70
% of all sensors in process control and more than 90 % in
building automation are sensors switches acting as threshold
switches when changes of particular conditions require
dedicated actions. For these purposes, sensors are required,
which binarily switch between two pre-defined states. Most
of the commercial sensors related to this task are based either
on a resistive, a capacitive or an optical measurement
principle [1]. Their advantages are a low response time, a
high accuracy and a continuous measurement. Unfortunately,
they need an electrical processing circuitry as well as an
external energy supply to monitor the desired parameter
continuously (Fig. 1).
This paper describes another approach for the two point
control of relative humidity as water vapor concentration in
air and the reduction of the system complexity (compare Fig.
1 with Fig. 2).

We propose a binary zero-power sensor (BIZEPS) (see
Fig. 3) where the humidity causes a transducing element
(here a humidity-sensitive hydrogel) to swell. This swelling
provides, in contrast to existing solutions, the energy to
trigger mechanically an electrical contact. As long as a
defined threshold is not reached, the electrical micro contact
remains open. The advantages of such polymers are their
easy processing technology, their low costs, the adequate
availability and the possibility to tailor their properties. The
effect of polymer swelling is already used in bimorph
sensors [2], biosensors [3] and in sensors for reflectometric
interference spectroscopy [4].
Fig. 3.
Operation principle of a binary sensor switch based on the
BIZEPS platform.
For our intention, two swelling properties can be used.
The approach with the largest sensitivity uses the volume
increase of the polymer (type B). Due to the absorption of
water
molecules
the
polymer
swells
but
remains
incompressible. By restricting the free space one can use the
resulting high swelling pressure. The second approach uses
the bimorph effect, which is based on two connected
material layers with different linear expansion coefficients
(type A). The expansion of one of the layers due to factors
such as temperature or, in our case, humidity, leads to a
bending of the bimorph in one direction.
The mechanical part of the sensor switch, which is
deflected by the polymer, will be realized with a silicon boss
structure as construction part of a thin silicon flexure plate. It
offers several advantages:

The flexure plate shows a suitable compliance with
respect to a large enough deflection for the switching
movement.

The boss structure can serve as the switching
contact.

Fast switching needs snap behavior. This can be
realized by applying a preload through an oxide
layer onto the silicon flexure plate to minimize the
effects of the swelling hysteresis.
Due to the expected low contact forces (< 1 mN)
provided by the dynamic behavior of the polymer layer, a
special contact design has to be applied. Gold nanowires are
a promising candidate to minimize the necessary contact
force, to decrease the contact resistance and to raise the
reliability [5]. They are used in our BIZEPS switch as
backplate electrode (Fig. 4).

EXPERIMENTAL
A.
Manufacturing of the humidity sensitive hydrogel
One key element of the BIZEPS platform is the
sensitive polymer, which interacts with the parameter to be
measured (% r. H., T, pH). Here a hydrogel blend of 15 wt%
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and 7.5 wt% poly(acryl acid)
(PAA) in a mass ratio of 4:1 is used. A polymer layer of
approximately
20
μm in
thickness
(measured in
dry
condition) was created by filling a casting mould of
poly(tetrafluorethylen) (PTFE) with the hydrogel solution.
PTFE was used because of its very low adhesion force and
its hydrophobic behavior. After the evaporation of the
solvent, the polymer was annealed at 130 °C for at least 40
min to ensure a high crosslinking. Afterwards, the polymer
layer was cut to size.

Type A – Investigation of the bimorph effect
The investigation of the swelling pressure caused by the
bimorph effect and the resulting deflection was done with the
sensor configuration shown in Fig. 5.

1. TO8-socket, 2. gold-wire bond, 3. glue, 4. PVA/PAA layer, 5. Si-chip,

A pressure sensor chip with a silicon flexure plate of
3800 x 3800 μm2 and a thickness of 20 μm was used as basic
transducer. A 3 μl drop of the hydrogel blend PVA/PAA was
coated directly onto the flexure plate and annealed. It showed
a circular shape with a diameter of 2.5 ± 0.8 mm. The

resulting thickness of the polymer layer varied between 5.5 ±
1.2 μm in the middle and 8.8 ± 1.5 μm at the edges.
Afterwards, the Si-chip was glued onto a TO8-socket with a
small hole which allows varying the pressure to the flexure
plate. The electrical contacts between the socket and the
resistance strain gauges were done by gold-wire bonding.
The sensor was placed into the conditioning cabinet
(Heraeus-Vötsch
HC0020)
to
maintain
a
constant
temperature of about 19.8 °C for 24 hours. During this time
the relative humidity φ was reduced in steps from 85 to 10 %
r. H. and the voltage output Ua(φ) of the resistance strain
gauges, which were connected to a Wheatstone bridge, was
measured. In the next step, the relative humidity φ was
maintained at 10 % and a pressure p between 0 and 40 kPa
was applied with a pressure controller (Druck DPI 510)
while the resulting output voltage Ua(p) was monitored.
By correlating the characteristic curves of Ua(φ) and
Ua(p), the dependence p(φ) between the pressure and the
relative humidity as an approximation of the swelling
pressure is obtained. The deflection dependence w(p) of the
silicon flexure plate was investigated with a two-beam
vibrometer
system
consisting
of
a
Polytec
OFV3001
vibrometer
controller
and
a
Polytec
OFV502
fiber
interferometer. One beam was focused on the edge of the
silicon chip while the other one was adjusted to the middle of
the flexure plate onto a reflex strip on top of the polymer.
This measurement was performed at 10 % r. H..
2)
Type B – Investigation of the volume swelling
The influence of the volume swelling to a silicon flexure
plate was investigated with the configuration according to
Fig. 6.
Fig. 6.
BIZEPS sensor switch based on volume swelling (type B): 1.
porous Al2O3 membran, 2. crosslinked PVA/PAA layer, 3. silicon chip
with a 20 μm silicon flexure plate, 4. silicone glue Scrintec® 901.
For this, the prepared polymer layer was fixed between
the sensor chip and a customized porous Al2O3 ceramic filter
with a thickness of 630 μm using a silicone glue (Scrintec
901). The pores within the ceramic filter was perforated with
a laser beam. The average distance between the pores is
about 200 μm, their diameter amounts to 50 μm. The filter
serves as mechanical restriction for the polymer in the lower
direction to lead the volume swelling in the upper direction
only deflecting the silicon membrane. On the other side, the
porous filter allows the diffusion of the water vapor (and
water) into the hydrogel to ensure the sensing function of the
polymer layer.
After fabrication, several drops of water were brought
into contact with the porous ceramics and the dry polymer.
As a result, the water diffused as expected through the holes,
and it lead to the volume swelling of the polymer layer. Due
to the mechanical stiffness of the ceramic filter the silicon
membrane was deflected upward, which was measured by
laserprofilometry (μScan, Nanofocus) and a chromatic
sensor.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1)
Sensor type A – Investigation of the bimorph effect
The influence of the relative humidity to the hydrogel
PVA/PAA coated onto a silicon flexure plate has been
studied. According to the results presented in Fig. 7 the
silicon flexure plate shows nearly linear deflection up to 23
μm in the range of 10 to 85 % r. H. while the approximated
swelling pressure is increasing up to 38 kPa.

Influence of the relative humidity on the deflection of a 20 μm
silicon flexure plate coated with a PVA/PAA hydrogel blend for the
BIZEPS sensor of type A based on the bimorph effect.
Because the polymer was not restricted in space during
swelling this deflection is mainly caused by the bimorph
effect. In detail, by raising the relative humidity, the
absorbed water molecules lead to a reduction of the young’s
modulus and a swelling of the hydrogel fixed to the silicon
flexure plate. Because of the geometrical dimensions the
polymer expands more in plane than out of plane leading to
the deflection of the silicon membrane.
2)
Sensor type B – Investigation of the volume swelling
After sensor preparation a first swelling/deswelling cycle
was performed. Fig. 8 shows the resulting silicon flexure
plate deflection. As can be seen a deflection change of about
36 μm occurs in the range of 10 to 100 % r. H. The initial
deflection at 10 % r. H. seems to be caused by a
superposition of the bimorph effect resulting from the initial
swelling cycle. Nonetheless, the amount of deflection seems
to be sufficient for switching devices. The porous ceramic
filter operated as expected both as stiff mechanical limitation
and element to allow the humidity to penetrate into the
hydrogel. However, for applications in fluids, alternative
materials like zeolite should be used.

3)
Suitability of hydrogels for humidity sensor switches
According to the presented experimental results the
hydrogel PVA/PAA is a very promising material to provide
the required forces to deflect a silicon flexure plate as needed
to close an electrical contact. This could be demonstrated
both for the volume swelling and for the bimorph effect.
However,
commercial
applications
need
a
more
comprehensive investigation of the properties. In particular,
several polymer-specific problems have to be considered.
First of all, the fabrication of thin polymer layers which
are not coated directly onto the final surface is problematic.
This regards the handling, the homogeneity of the layer
thickness, the shrinking due to the evaporation of the solvent,
the initial swelling and the cross-linking conditions which
have to be taken into account. Spin-coating seems to be the
more favored technique but did not lead to sufficient results
yet, because the layer could not be removed from the used
silicon wafer. So far the dipping method with the PTFE
casting mould was applied. For an industrial mass production
this process shows limited reproducibilty especially when the
solvent content in the hydrogel blend is unknown or
changingover time.
The second challenge regards the diffusion of water
molecules into the hydrogel. The favored all-sided volume
swelling is a very slow process.
Another problem is the temperature influence on the
maximum saturation vapor pressure and, hence, on the
relative humidity as well as the swelling behavior of the
polymer.
Swelling and deswelling processes in hydrogels show
different time constants which leads to hysteretic behavior
during humidity cycles. This hysteresis can be used for the
switching behavior of sensor switches but is challenging
with respect to the design parameters of the silicon sensor
chip and the hydrogel.
Studies on test chips with structured hydrogel of
approximately 15 µm revealed that the complete drying
(deswelling)
is
substantially
longer
than
the
wetting
(swelling). The time until the switch can be switched from
the line profile in figures 9 and 10 are not directly derived.

this concept is that the continuous monitoring does not need

swelling-related effects were studied: (type A) the direct
volume increase of the hydrogel and (type B) the bimorph
effect using the swelling of a hydrogel layer deposited on
aflexure plate. The experimental results showed that both
effects can provide sufficient deflections of the silicon
membrane up to 23 μm with the bimorph effect and 36 μm
by volume swelling. A nearly linear correlation between the
relative humidity and the deflection was found for the
bimorph effect. The estimated swelling pressure amounted to
38 kPa in the range of 10 to 85 % r. H.
