Abstract—Against the measuring problem of similarity be-
tween simulation time-series data and reference time-series 
data with different lengths or distorted timeline, a similarity 
measuring method based on DTW is proposed. Considering 
the trends of time-series data, a new windowing algorithm for 
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is presented. The correctness 
of the algorithm is proved. On this basis, simulation time-series 
data and reference time-series data are segmented according to 
event information, and the overall similarity between them is 
obtained by calculating DTW distance in different segments. 
Finally, an example is given to validate the reasonability and 
validity of the proposed method.

 INTRODUCTION 
As one of the significant means of learning and changing 
the objective world, the simulation technique is widely used 
in many fields, such as spaceflight, aviation, electronics and 
communication [1][2][3]. Simulation system is the applica-
tion form of simulation technique. Its credibility directly 
determines the success or failure of the simulation applica-
tion. Through investigating the difference of simulation sys-
tem state variables and output variables from actual system 
state variables and output variables, the simulation credibility 
can be measured. In other words, we need to investigate 
whether the similarity between simulation data and reference 
data is good enough. According to the difference of data ar-
rangement, simulation data can be divided into simulation 
time-series data and non-time-series data. In the same way, 
reference data can also be divided to reference time-series 
data and non-time-series data. This paper studies how to 
measure the similarity between simulation time-series data 
and reference time-series data. Without special instructions, 
simulation data and reference data respectively represent 
simulation time-series data and reference time-series data in 
the following content. 
Generally speaking, simulation data and reference data 
are considered a whole separately when investigating the 
similarity between them, and then their similarity is calculat-
ed with an appropriate measuring method. However, various 
events may occur in the running of actual system, such as 
“stage-1/stage-2 separation”, “fairing jettison”, “satellite-
rocket separation” during rocket flight. The occurrence of an 
event usually brings about violent changes in actual system 
state. Therefore, simulation data and reference data should be 
divided into segments，and the similarity between two cor-
responding segments is investigated alone. Combined with 
all the investigative results, the overall similarity between 
simulation data and reference data could be obtained. How-
ever, the occurrence time of an event is usually advanced or 
delayed owing to disturbance caused by outside factors. So, 
the same segments of simulation data and reference data may 
be distorted on the timeline, which puts forward special re-
quirements on time series similarity measure. 
At present, the commonly used time series similarity 
measures are Euclidean distance [4][5], Edit distance [6] and 
DTW distance [7][8][9]. The advantages of Euclidean dis-
tance include high calculation speed, simple principle and 
orthogonal transformation invariance. However, it simply 
regards time series as a point of multidimensional Euclidean 
space ignoring the time factor of data, and is very sensitive to 
abnormal points. The most crucial problem is Euclidean dis-
tance only applies to measure similarity between time series 
with synchronization on the timeline. Edit distance is appli-
cable to string sequence. If measuring object is not string 
sequence, it should be transformed into string sequence by 
some rule, and then use Edit distance to measure the similari-
ty between two string sequences. But the algorithm applied 
to transforming non-string sequence into string sequence is 
not accurate enough, which seriously affect the application 
effect of Edit distance. Besides, Edit distance also requires 
two string sequences keep a strict synchronization on the 
timeline. DTW distance does not require the sampling time 
of two time series are synchronous, not be sensitive to ab-
normal points, furthermore, it is able to measure the similari-
ty of time series with different lengths or distorted timeline. 
Therefore, we introduce DTW into system simulation field, 
and propose a method for simulation time-series data similar-
ity measure based on DTW. The layout of the paper is as 
follows: In Section 2, the basic concepts of DTW is intro-
duced. In Section 3, a method for measuring similarity be-
tween simulation data and reference data is proposed. In Sec-
tion 4, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated 
through an application example. In Section 5, conclusion is 
drawn.

DTW 
DTW is a nonlinear warping technique put forward by 
Japanese scholar Itakura in the 1960s, and was originally 
applied in speech recognition. In 1994, DTW was applied to

achieved great success. The basic concepts of DTW will be 
introduced briefly as following.

then we say P is a warping path between X and Y. 
There are exponentially many warping paths that satisfy 
the above conditions, as shown in Figure 1. However, we are 
only interested in the path which has the minimum cumula-
tive distance, and regard it as the basis of measuring similari-
ty degree between two time series.

The smaller DTW(X, Y) is, the higher degree of similarity 
between X and Y is. Otherwise it is lower.

SIMILARITY MEASURING METHOD BASED ON DTW 
This section discusses the warping window of DTW first, 
and constructs a new windowing algorithm. On the basis of 
the new windowing algorithm, a method for measuring simi-
larity between simulation data and reference data is proposed. 
A. Warping Window of DTW 
In the application of DTW, swing scope of warping path 
is generally limited. On the one hand, this can narrow the 
scope to search optimal warping path, and improve calcula-
tion speed of DTW distance. On the other hand, even more 
important, this can avoid a morbid warping path, and ensure 
the reasonableness of calculation result of DTW distance. At 
present, the most common windowing algorithm is: for any 
point pk=(ak, bk) in the warping path, it is required to satisfy 
|ak-bk|≤L. It is obvious that the value of L directly affects the 
reasonableness of calculation result of DTW distance. How-
ever, the value of L is generally given by experts in practice, 
which has strong subjectivity. In addition, warping window 
of the same width cannot precisely describe the distortion of 
time series in timeline. 
Against the above problems, a new windowing algorithm 
called TS algorithm is presented in this section. Its basic idea 
is through analyzing the trend of time series, data matching 
is limited to segments in which two time series have the 
same trend. So, it can effectively prevent the excessive dis-
tortion of warping path. The steps of TS algorithm are as 
follows: 
Step 1 Calculate the trend sequence of time series X=(x1, 
x2,…,xm) and Y=(y1, y2,…, yn), and get

, and then 
calculate the DTW distance between X and Y. 
TS algorithm has great objectiveness due to no need of 
expert knowledge, and can precisely describe the distortion 
of time series in timeline. 
Theorem 1 Suppose time series X=(x1,x2,…,xm) and Y= 
(y1,y2,…,yn). W is the warping window calculated with TS 
algorithm, then there exists at least one warping path be-
tween X and Y in W. 
Proof For proving that there exists a warping path be-
tween X and Y in W, we only need to prove the following 
two conditions: 
(1) (1,1)∈W, (m,n)∈W;

From the above, we know that there exists at least one 
warping path between X and Y in W. 
B. Steps of Algorithm 
Suppose reference data R=(r(t1), r(t2),…, r(tn)), simulation 
data S=(s(t1), s(t2),…, s(tn)), t1<t2<…<tn. Event sequence E= 
(e1,e2,…,eK) is happened to actual system during t1~tn, and its 
happening time is T1=(t1,1, t1,2,…, t1,K); The same event se-
quence E=(e1,e2,…,eK) is happened to simulation system 
during t1~tn, and its happening time is T2=(t2,1, t2,2,…, t2,K). 
To measure the similarity between reference data R and 
simulation data S, a similarity measuring method is proposed, 
in combination with research achievement in the DTW theo-
ry. Its steps are as follows: 
Step 1 According to the event sequence E, R is segment-
ed into

, as shown in (5) and (6). 
Step 2 Using group AHP to determine the weight of each 
segment. This step includes the following four substeps: 
Step 2.1 According to the actual situation of simulation 
object, a number of experts with relevant background and 
different knowledge structure are invited to set up an evalua-
tion team P={p1, p2,…, pm}. The subjective weight of expert 
pi is obtained from professional title, evaluation mode and 
the degree of familiarity with simulation object. The formula 
is as follows:

Step 2.2 The difference between R and S in each segment 
has different degree of influence on simulation credibility. 
So, expert ei is invited to make comparison between the in-
fluence degrees, then we get judgement matrix

APPLICATION EXAMPLE 
To avoid interception by our anti-aircraft missile, enemy 
attack missiles always tend to be changing orbit dramatically. 
Guidance law needs to be designed for our missile to inter-
cept enemy missile effectively. A guidance simulation model 
is set up to validate guidance law. Take lateral acceleration 
output of this model for example, the effectiveness of the 
proposed method in this paper is validated. 
Assume the motion of the target is as follows: 
1) 
Before orbital maneuver: keep 8000m height, do 
horizontal straight line motion with a speed in 600m/s; 
2) 
After orbital maneuver: keep 8000m height, do sine 
motion around the straight line, the sine law: 150sin(0.3t)m; 
3) 
The maneuver time t(s) obeys the normal distribu-
tion: N(6,0.22). 
Data sampling interval: 0.02s, Sampling period: 0s~10s, 
500 samples in total, as shown in Fig.2, where R is reference 
data of lateral acceleration and S is simulation data of lateral 
acceleration. 
 
Figure 2.  Comparison between reference and simulation lateral 
acceleration 
Using the proposed method to calculate similarity be-
tween R and S as follows: 
First, according to maneuver time of target, R is seg-
mented into R=
1
, 2
R R
, and S is segmented into S=
1
, 2
S S
, 
where R1=(r(t1),r(t2),…,r(t310)), R2=(r(t310),r(t311),…,r(t500)), 
S1=(s(t1),s(t2),…,s(t300)), S2=(s(t300),s(t301),…,s(t500)). 
Then, invite three experts to constitute an evaluation 
team P={p1,p2,p3}, and use (7) to calculate subjective weight 
of expert as follows: 
( )
1
s

0.485

λp

( )
3

0.273
λp

. 
The difference between R and S has influence on simula-
tion credibility, and the influence degree is different before 
and after target orbital maneuver. In the light of this, each 
expert gives an individual judgement matrix as follows: 
1

1/ 3

⎛

to calculate comprehensive judgement matrix which is

It is clearly observed that the proposed method can

data with different length, and it has a strong robustness on 
the distortion of timeline.

that the proposed method make up for the deficiency of tradi-

V. 
CONCLUSION 
The similarity between simulation data and reference 
data is generally investigated when we evaluate the credibil-
ity of simulation system. As system states usually change 
sharply after the occurrence of some event, so, data need to 
be segmented for analysis. Against simulation time and actu-
al time are not in synch, a similarity measuring method based 
on DTW is proposed, using a new windowing algorithm for 
DTW. Application example shows that the proposed method 
can effectively measure the similarity between simulation 
data and reference data with different lengths or distorted 
timeline, and has a good prospect in the field of simulation 
model validation.
