Abstract—Sensor networks can be useful for disaster recovery. 
It is essential how to realize time-efficient and pervasive 
surveillance over a wide disaster-affected area. A surveillance 
architecture based on collaboration among multiple electric 
helicopters is presented. Area division principles are used 
considering cost minimization as well as considering the 
requirements of allowable surveillance time, and transmission 
range and effective bandwidth of the wireless link. A simple 
model and methodology for area division considering the 
battery-capacity-limited flying range are presented. Numerical 
examples show the feasibility of the area division approach.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can 
contribute to the creation of disaster-resilient societies in two 
ways. One way is to increase the resilience and tolerance of 
communication infrastructure toward disasters. Second way 
is to develop new ICT technologies for promoting disaster 
recovery activities. In this study, we focus on use of ICT for 
surveillance of wide areas such as disaster-affected areas.  
A disaster, such as big earthquake, hurricane, etc. can 
affect quite a large area, e.g., as large as 100 km square. It 
would take enormous time to perform close, detail, and 
pervasive surveillance to cover the entire area and deliver the 
obtained surveillance results in real-time to the remote 
disaster recovery headquarter.  It is thus essential how to 
realize time-efficient and pervasive surveillance over a wide 
disaster-affected area.  
Surveillance can be performed on the ground or from the 
air. The latter provides a wider field of vision than the former, 
and is, therefore, especially efficient when the disaster-
affected area is wide. For realizing aerial surveillance, a 
single aerial vehicle such as air plane or helicopter can be 
used to cover the entire disaster-affected area. However, this 
solution may not be acceptable since it would take much 
time to complete one-round surveillance for a large area due 
to speed limit of the aerial vehicle. Furthermore, it is also a 
problem how to deliver the obtained surveillance results to 
the disaster recovery headquarter in real-time and 
continuously. An alternative approach using a number of 
very small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with fixed or 
rotary wings is attractive from the viewpoints of the 
investment required and operational ease. Indeed, this 
approach can be applied in various applications including 
surveillance and forms an active research area [1]-[16]. 
Multiple UAVs working in parallel may be required for 
monitoring a wide area. An approach called “three-
Dimensional Mobile Surveillance (3DMS),” was proposed in 
[15], where multiple Electric Vehicles (EVs) and very small, 
lightweight unmanned UAVs with rotary wings (helicopters), 
termed “Electric Helicopters (EHs),” were cooperatively 
engaged in surveillance over a wide area.  
 The contributions of this paper are as follows: 
1) A 
time-efficient 
and 
pervasive 
surveillance 
architecture based on the collaboration of multiple EHs, 
each with its partner EV, is presented. 
2)  Area division principles are given based on cost 
minimization, as well as considering requirements of 
allowable surveillance time and transmission performance. 
3) A simple model and methodology for area division 
devised by considering the battery-capacity-limited flying 
range are presented. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II summarizes related works. Section III 
discusses surveillance strategies for designing wide-area 
surveillance architectures. Section IV outlines the basic 
approach and surveillance architecture of the proposed 
system. Section V presents a surveillance area division 
scheme, and Section VI presents numerical examples. 
Finally, the conclusions of this paper are presented in Section 
VII.

RELATED WORK 
There exist many studies on Vehicular Ad hoc 
NETworks (VANETs) [17]. In these studies, vehicles with 
engines consuming fuels such as oil and gas were assumed 
implicitly, and applications useful during driving were 
extensively explored and developed. The benefits of using 
EVs in a disaster-affected area for providing emergency 
communication networks have been discussed [18]. 
UAVs can be used for improving the connectivity and 
performance of ad hoc networks on the ground [8]-[10]. It is 
easier to control UAV position in air given the lack of 
obstacles or physical boundaries. Therefore, UAV relay 
positioning methods have been studied extensively [11]-[14]. 
When multiple UAVs work in tandem for surveillance in 
a disaster-affected area, inter-UAV coordination for task 
assignment and responsibility is essential to improve 
surveillance efficiency. Coordination among helicopter 
UAVs for forest-fire surveillance was explored; here, the 
focus was on observing the fire’s expanding perimeter and

devising a parallel, non-overlapping, uniformly time-
consuming patrolling task assignment method [6]. In disaster 
surveillance, all areas should be monitored continuously, and 
repeatedly. This problem has not been fully discussed in the 
previous works. 
III. 
SURVEILLANCE STRATEGY 
A. Ground-based vs. Air-based 
Ground-based surveillance is indispensable for close, 
detailed, and pervasive surveillance, as well as the 
subsequent rescue activities. Rescue team members should 
be equipped with means of transportation such as vehicles 
that enable them to quickly move around the wide area 
within limited time. In addition to surveillance using ground 
vehicles, surveillance can be performed from the air. It is 
easier to view the entire disaster-affected area from the air. 
Aerial vehicles can monitor locations that ground vehicles 
cannot access owing to a lack of roads or the presence of 
obstacles. 
B. Manned vs. Unmanned 
Aerial vehicles can be either manned or unmanned. The 
former type is expensive, and the availability of human pilots 
is limited. Focusing on UAVs, the need for a human pilot on 
the ground should be avoided. In principle, the UAV can fly 
and work through autonomous piloting or remote automatic 
control by computer without human manual operation.  
C. Fuel vs. Electricity 
Both ground vehicles and UAVs can be powered by fuel 
oil or electricity. The use of EVs and electric UAVs is 
attractive in the disaster recovery phase because their 
batteries can be recharged using local power generation 
facilities such as solar panels, even under long blackouts, 
whereas fuel-based vehicles and UAVs cannot be refueled 
under a shortage of oil stock in a disaster-affected area. 
Focusing on UAVs, the spare battery can be immediately 
substituted for the spent battery, while it takes some time to 
refuel the oil tank. 
D. Supply of EV 
EVs can reduce the air pollution due to automobile 
exhaust gases. The EV market has recently experienced 
significant growth. 
Moreover, a very small EV with one or two seats, called 
a mini-EV, can potentially grow EV market in the near 
future, achieving significantly greater penetration in the 
community, especially in aging societies [18]. In such an 
environment, in the event of a large-scale disaster, it would 
be easy to divert EVs available in the community toward 
disaster recovery activities, thus reducing the reserves 
required for disaster recovery. Therefore, the supply of EVs 
for disaster recovery is expected economically feasible. 
E. UAV options 
UAVs include airships, helicopters, and airplanes. 
Airships allow for relatively long flying and hovering times 
over the disaster-affected area, which are desirable for 
continuously monitoring the same area in disaster 
surveillance. However, support services such as the 
supplementing of helium gas are required. Helicopters can 
hover as well, but require a greater amount of energy and 
have limited continuous operation times. Airplanes find it 
difficult to both hover as well as to adapt to the route 
according to the situation. In addition, similar to helicopters, 
their continuous operation times are limited. An airship 
requires a relatively large space for periodic topping-up of its 
helium gas, takeoff, and landing, and an airplane needs a 
long runway or special care for takeoff and landing. These 
support services are unnecessary for a helicopter. 
IV. 
SURVEILLANCE ARCHITECTURE 
A. Overview 
In the proposed architecture, an EV–EH pair is the key 
component for the surveillance of disaster-affected areas. 
Each EV functions as the carrier of its partner EH during the 
round trip to the designated destination and surveillance, 
providing its roof area for accommodation, takeoff, and 
landing of the EH. It also may support automatic piloting for 
its partner EH. Each EV and EH are equipped with sensing 
and wireless communication devices. For conducting time-
efficient and pervasive surveillance activities over a wide 
disaster-affected area, a number of EV–EH pairs may be 
used for simultaneous and parallel surveillance over said area. 
To start surveillance, each EV accompanied by its partner 
EH is driven to and parked at its target point in the disaster-
affected area. During this phase, the EH may get and provide 
information useful for EV driving, e.g., existence of 
obstacles and traffic congestion on streets, to the EV driver.  
A designated EV within the area is assigned the role of 
the data collection node (simply center EV, hereafter). The 
sensed data are delivered from each source EV or EH by 
means of wireless multi-hop communication relayed by a 
number of EVs or EHs on the way to the center EV, and then 
to the remote disaster recovery headquarter, using, for 
instance, a satellite communication link. Disaster-affected 
area surveillance by EVs on the ground and that by EHs in 
the air can work in a complementary, cooperative manner, 
thus significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of 
surveillance. 
B. Area division requirements 
Area division is useful for coordinating and assigning 
surveillance activities among multiple EV–EH pairs, where 
the entire surveillance area is divided into multiple non-
overlapping sub-areas filling the entire area and an EV–EH 
pair is assigned to each sub-area. Surveillance activities are 
independently and simultaneously performed in parallel 
within each sub-area. In general, the greater the number of 
EV–EH pairs, the less is the time required for one round of 
surveillance of the entire area; the required time can be 
reduced further, although at the cost of EV–EH pair 
resources.

C. Wireless multi-hop data delivery 
Upon reaching the target point in the assigned sub-area, 
each EV remains at this initial position during the following 
surveillance activities as the support station, while its partner 
EH flies over the entire assigned sub-area for surveillance 
and sends the gathered surveillance data to its partner EV, 
which works as the temporal data storage point. The EV then 
forwards the data to the neighbor EH flying over the adjacent 
sub-area, which is located on the designated path toward the 
center EV. The neighbor EH receives this data and forwards 
it to its partner EV, in addition to the data gathered by itself. 
This process is repeated and the data obtained by the source 
EH are eventually delivered to the center EV. In addition to 
EHs, EVs may gather and transmit surveillance data. Area 
division needs to be performed to ensure that an EH and its 
partner EV, and an EV and its upstream EH in the adjacent 
sub-area on the designated path toward the center EV are 
within the transmission range (Requirement 1). Each EV and 
EH may have multiple down-stream EHs and EVs, 
respectively. Simultaneous packet transmission to the same 
EH and EV may result in interference, and, thus, the use of 
non-overlapping 
channels 
is 
desirable 
for 
avoiding 
interference. 
D. Line-of-sight transmission using flying EH 
It is noteworthy that data packets can be transmitted 
between the EV and the EH in the proposed architecture, 
thereby avoiding EH–EH or EV–EV transmission. In the 
EH-EH, packet transmission could be unstable due to 
variations in the EH position or attitude in air even in the 
hovering state. In the EV-EV, line-of-sight may not be 
assured due to the obstacles on the ground, thus resulting in 
poor packet transmission performance. In contrast, it is easier 
to assure line-of-sight in the EH–EV packet transmission. 
Moreover, a directional antenna can be attached to the side 
of the EV, which can significantly extend the packet 
transmission range [19]. 
E. Flight time and range requirement 
To minimize EH total weight, the weight of the battery is 
strictly limited. This means that the EH’s battery capacity is 
also limited, allowing only relatively short continuous flight 
times and ranges. The EV’s battery can be used for 
recharging the partner EH’s spent battery, thus allowing the 
EH to engage in airborne surveillance repeatedly [15]. This 
functionality is termed as “on-EV charging.” A carrier EV 
can be equipped with spare EH batteries. By substituting a 
spare EH battery for the landed EH’s spent battery, the 
waiting time for on-EV charging can be shortened as 
mentioned in Section III.C. The spent battery from the EH is 
recharged on the EV for reuse. EH flight time must be set at 
least longer than the round trip time between the positions of 
its partner EV as the on-EV charging station and the farthest 
part within the sub-area (Requirement 2). 
V. 
SURVEILLANCE SCHEME 
A surveillance area is a square of size              , which is 
uniformly  divided  into              square  sub-areas, each  of  
size           , as shown in Figure 1. An EV–EH pair is 
Figure 1. Example of area division in square area modeling. 
assigned to each sub-area. Each EV is positioned in the 
center of the respective assigned sub-area. The center EV is 
positioned in the center sub-area. A sub-area is further 
divided into uniform squares, each of which, termed “a 
surveillance unit,” is the field of vision, with the length of 
each side,   , closest to and no greater than the given value,   , 
to make uniform division. Each surveillance unit can be 
surveyed by an EH flying over the center line crossing the 
center of the surveillance unit without approaching the edges 
of the surveillance unit. Let     be the maximum flight 
distance divided by the side length of the surveillance unit 
(normalized flight distance) of an EH. Requirement 2 in 
Section IV.E can then be represented by  
 
 
 
 
 
where  
Because the EH needs to return to its partner EV before 
running out of battery for on-EV charging to continue further 
surveillance, the normalized flight distance,  , required for 
completing one-round surveillance of a sub-area is 
represented as the following function of     and    : 

 
The upper bound of    ,     , is then given by substituting 
     with its lower bound in (1) 
 


    
In contrast, if there is no limit on the battery capacity, the 
EH can continue surveillance by taking an optimum route 
over the sub-area without returning to its partner EV. The 
lower bound of      ,       , is thus obviously given by

(4) 
The time required for completing one-round surveillance 
of a sub-area (one-round surveillance time),      is given as 
                                
 (5) 
where   is time required to cross the side length of the 
surveillance unit in flight. It is noteworthy that the time of 
on-EV charging is not included in (5) based on the remark in 
Section IV.E. The surveillance time,    , should be designed 
to be no greater than its upper bound     , which may be 
given as the design target parameter in surveillance system 
development, as shown below. 
 
 (6) 
Let    (MB/km2) be surveillance data size per unit area. 
The total surveillance data size of the surveillance area is 
then    . As described in IV.   , a designated path toward the 
center EV should be set for data transfer from each sub-area 
to the center area. Because surveillance data from each sub-
area are merged at each relay EV and EH, the transmission 
load increases for the upstream EVs and EHs closer to the 
center EV. Four most-upstream EHs are adjacent to the 
center EV in the square area modeling considered in this 
section. Assuming that the set of designated paths for the 
area is designed to balance the transmission load among the 
links, and neglecting the transmission overhead, the 
maximum link load,     (Mbps), can be represented as  
 
 
 
(7) 
 
 
An example of the designated path configuration is given 
in Figure 2. 
The transmission range of a wireless link can be defined 
as the maximum distance over which the packet loss rate is 
no greater than the given threshold. In general, the 
transmission range becomes shorter as the effective 
bandwidth increases; thus, the transmission range is a 
function of   , represented by        . The transmission 
distance can be the longest when the EV in the center of each 
sub-area transmits packets to the upstream EH at the far-end 
corner of the adjacent sub-area on the designated path to the 
center EV. For satisfying Requirement 1 in Section IV.C, the 
following relationship should be satisfied.  
 




In contrast, the number of EV–EH pairs covering the 
surveillance area should be maintained as low as possible for 
 
 
 
cost saving. 
An area division solution for the square area and sub-area 
models should thus obtain the minimum value of  for 
satisfying conditions (6) and (8), where    is substituted by  
(7). 
VI. 
NUMERICAL EXAMPLES 
Investigation of the characteristics of the function in (2) 
is an interesting research issue, but is out of the scope of this 
study. Instead, the upper bounds of the normalized flight 
distance,      , in (3) can be given numerically using the flight 
path configuration obtained by a heuristic approach (See 
Figure 3). The results, including the      of (4), are shown in 
Figure 4. The ratio of        to       is also shown in Figure 4. It 
is expected that the ratio roughly converges to around 1.2. 
The upper bounds of the one-round surveillance time are 
obtained by substituting     with       in (5) and shown in 
Figure 5, where L and EH velocity are 50 km and 60 km/h, 
respectively. As expected, the one-round surveillance time 
decreases with an increase in the number of divisions or the 
field of vision. Similarly, the transmission range requirement 
given in (8) decreases with an increase in the number of 
divisions, as shown in Figure 5. 
Assuming use of an adequate transmission system 
meeting required effective bandwidth and transmission range 
for each EH–EV or EV–EH link, link quality such as packet 
delivery ratio can be assured, while end-to-end path quality 
degrades as the number of divisions of sub-area increases. To 
improve end-to-end path quality, packet retransmission 
mechanism either in link or end-to-end may be required.

Figure 5. Upper bounds of one-round surveillance time and transmission 
range requirement with regard to number of divisions, n. 
The number of divisions,   , meeting the given one-round 
surveillance time requirements is obtained from (3), (5) and 
(6) and shown in Figure 6. The higher the one-round 
surveillance time requirement, the lower is the number of 
divisions of a sub-area. The corresponding maximum link 
load in (7) and transmission range requirements in (8) are 
shown in Figure 7. As the one-round surveillance time 
requirements rise, the surveillance data transmission 
frequency decreases, resulting in a decrease in the maximum 
link load. By contrast, the transmission range requirements 
increase owing to an increase in the sub-area size. Therefore, 
given the one-round surveillance time requirements, an 
adequate transmission device should be selected based on the 
requirements of decrease in the maximum link load and 
increase in the transmission range.  
In summary, the numerical examples in Figure 6 show 
that wide area as large as 100 km square can be monitored 
pervasively in one hour or so, operating a few hundred EV–
EH pairs. Transmission devices meeting the requirements as 
shown in the numerical examples in Figure 7 can be in the 
scope of the existing technologies.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A time-efficient and pervasive surveillance architecture 
based on the collaboration of multiple EHs was presented. A 
wide area is divided into a number of sub-areas. An EH and 
its partner EV, which supports automatic piloting and battery 
charging for the EH, are assigned to each divided sub-area. A 
wireless link is established between an EH and its partner EV, 
as well as between an EV and its immediate upstream EH for 
forming a wireless multi-hop path toward the data collection 
node in the area. Area division principles were used 
considering cost minimization as well as considering the 
requirements 
of 
allowable 
surveillance 
time, 
and 
transmission range and effective bandwidth of the wireless 
link. A simple model and approach for area division based 
on explicit flight route distances of an EH considering the 
battery-capacity-limited 
flying 
range 
were 
presented. 
Numerical examples showed the feasibility of the area 
division approach. 
Further studies on this subject include the development 
of a general algorithm for obtaining the explicit flight route 
of EHs for not only simple square area models but also for 
geographical areas of any shape under flight distance 
limitations. Communications aspects, such as performance 
evaluation 
and 
improvement 
of 
wireless 
multi-hop 
communication path composed of multiple EH–EV and  
EV–EH links, are also included in the further study issues.
