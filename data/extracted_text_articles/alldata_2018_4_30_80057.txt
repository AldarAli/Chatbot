Abstract— In order to meet China’s growing demand for
knowledge services and allergy early warning of pollinosis, the
paper
initially
explores
and
develops
a
system,
called
“Pollinosis Knowledge Graph and Allergy Warning Analysis
System” (PKGAWAS). The system’s data comes mainly from
professional websites, Chinese Wikipedia and texts, which
cover
four
fields:
medicine,
agriculture,
forestry,
and
geography. In order to effectively implement multi-source data
integration, this paper first uses machine and manual methods
to collect data from literature, books, and websites. Then, we
store the collected data in a temporary database. After the data
is normalized, we store data in different categories, and then
integrate the data based on the relationships between entities.
Specifically, the paper uses property graph for knowledge
representation of the knowledge graph, and other data are
analyzed from the three dimensions of space, time, and disease.
PKGAWAS not only can provide users with a full range of
knowledge services and help, but also has important physical
and practical significance for promoting "Healthy China
2030".

I.
INTRODUCTION
Pollen allergy first appeared in the 19th century. In 1828,
Bostock
published
its
first
report
on
hay
fever
[1].
Subsequently, in 1873, Blakely proved that pollinosis was
caused by pollen from grasses [2]. In the second half of the
20th century, the prevalence of allergic respiratory diseases,
such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis increased
dramatically, affecting millions of people [3]. Pollen allergy
is a common disease of allergies, and the incidence rate has
increased year by year, seriously affecting human health.
Pollinosis has become
a veritable epidemic. It is
estimated that due to the increase in urban green areas, more
than 50% of the population in industrialized countries will
experience hypersensitivity in the next 20 years [4], but it is
difficult to cure pollinosis.
In order to effectively reduce the incidence of hay fever,
we need to do a good job in prevention [5]. Airborne pollen
is routinely monitored in many parts of the world, such as
North America and Europe, and the first limited network has
also
been
created
for
monitoring
airborne
allergen
concentrations [6]. In contrast，the pollen allergy situation
in China is grim, but there is no specialized pollinosis
knowledge service and allergy early warning website. In
China’s 18-64 year-old population, the incidence of pollen
allergy is 0.5 ~ 1%, and high-risk groups may even reach 5%
[7]. However, China only conducted a nationwide survey on
the distribution of airborne allergenic pollen in the 1980s.
Nearly 30 years later, historical data cannot accurately
analyze and predict future pollen concentrations.
But allergic diseases are now receiving the attention of
the national government. On October 25, 2016, the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council issued and
implemented the “Health China 2030” Plan. The purpose of
this plan is to promote the construction of a healthy China
and improve people's health. During the same year, Beijing
Smart Park Summit, Gao Wei, deputy director of the Beijing
Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, announced that during
the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, Beijing will launch the
construction of smart garden system to provide citizens with
personalized recommendation services, such as allergens
Early warning and others.
In order to meet the growing demand for knowledge
services and early warning of pollinosis, this paper attempts
to
design
and
develop
a
system,
called
Pollinosis
Knowledge Graph and Allergy Warning Analysis System
(PKGAWAS).
The
study
uses
the
methods
of
data
integration to secondary develop and utilize of Web data
and texts, which span four fields of medicine, meteorology,
forestry and geography. Additionally, PKGAWAS can
provide users with scientific knowledge of pollen allergy,
knowledge graph and allergy early warning, personalized
customization services and so on. The development of
PKGAWAS is of great theoretical and practical significance
for the pollen allergy knowledge service and allergy early
warning website construction in China.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
describes the system architecture. Section III introduces the
system data management process, including data source, data
collection and preparation, data integration. Section IV
presents the system interface. Conclusion and the aspects for
future works are provided in Section V.
II.
METHODOLOGY
A.
Architecture
As it has been mentioned in Section I, the main goal of
the PKGAWAS-based on Cross-Border Data Integration is
to meet the growing demand for knowledge services and

ALLDATA 2018 : The Fourth International Conference on Big Data, Small Data, Linked Data and Open Data

allergy early warning of pollinosis. According to this
demand, the system needed to fulfill the following main
functional requirements:
1)
Cross-border data integration: System data come
from the fields of medicine, geography, agriculture and
history.
2)
Multidimensional correlation analysis: It aims to dig
deep into the relationship between pollen concentration and
space, climate, time and the impact of allergens and regional
differences on hay fever.
3)
Knowledge
organization:
Construct
a
disease-
centered dynamic interactive knowledge graph.
4)
Allergy early warning.
5)
Dynamic interactive visualization.
6)
Personalized custom service.
Based
on
the
above
functional
requirements,
the
overview of the system architecture of the PKGAWAS are
shown in Figure 1. The system mainly has four layers:
support layer, data storage layer, functional layer, application
layer.
B.
System Design
In order to make the website simple and intuitive, the
site link level cannot exceed three. The overall structure of
the system is shown in Figure 2. PKGAWAS has a total of
three layers.

The first layer is the home page. On the front page, we
can see the main functions of PKGAWAS at a glance. In
addition, users can not only search for pollen, doctors,
hospitals, medicines and pollen allergy related diseases,
but also direct access to doctor's database, hospital
database, medicine database and Pollen database.

The second layer is the columns page. This system has
five columns page, which are pollen allergy related
diseases, knowledge graph, airborne allergenic pollen
map, allergy early warning, and about. Pollen allergy
related diseases include six diseases, such as pollinosis,
allergic
rhinitis,
bronchial
asthma.
The
system's
knowledge graph is dynamically interactive, besides it
also has intelligent statistics and related recommended
functions. Airborne allergenic pollen map introduces
regional, monthly and disease spectrum of pollenfrom a
national and local point of view. In the allergy early
warning page, PKGAWAS provides users with allergy
tracker, future forecast, literature allergy prediction and
other services.

The third layer is the content page.
III.
DATA MANAGEMENT
A.
Data Source
The data of this study mainly comes from professional
websites, Chinese Wikipedia and texts, which cover four
fields:
medicine,
agriculture,
forestry,
and
geography.
Professional websites include Clinical Medicine Knowledge
Base (CMKB) [8], Beijing Meteorological Service [9], China
Figure 1. Overview of the system architecture
Weather Network [10], China Food and Drug Administration
(CFDA)[11], and Chealth online [12] and so on. The text
data refers to literature and a book entitled “Color Atlas of
Air-borne Pollens and Plants in China”. For literature data,
we searched the literature related to pollen allergy from 2000
to 2017 from Wanfang data and the National Knowledge
Base Database (CNKI). Chinese Wikipedia refers to Baidu
baike and Hudong baike.
B.
Data Collection and Preparation
In order to accurately and comprehensively collect data,
we must first identify which data to collect and plan the
representation of knowledge.
1) Preliminary: The paper adopts the property graph
model to perform the knowledge representation of the
knowledge
graph.
The
system's
property
graph
is
constructed manually and then evaluated by experts. It
contains two parts: nodes and relationships, such as Figure 3.
a) Node: Nodes s are the entities in the graph. They
can hold any number of attributes (key-value-pairs) called
properties. Nodes can be tagged with labels representing
their different roles in
your domain. In addition to
contextualizing node and relationship properties, labels may
also
serve
to
attach
metadata—index
or
constraint
information—to certain nodes.
b) Relationship:
Relationships
provide
directed,
named, semantically relevant connections between two
node-entities. A relationship always has a direction, a type,
a start node, and an end node. Like nodes, relationships can
also have properties [13].
The conceptual layers of the knowledge graph of this
system include: diseases, complications, doctors, hospitals,
drugs, medical examination methods, and drug companies.
For the entities in concepts and concepts in the knowledge
graph, the paper uses a top-down and bottom-up approach to
construct the knowledge graph. However, the top-down
approach is not constructed by building the top relational
ontology, but directly by the property and entity-to-entity
relationship in the property graph.
2) Data collection： Data collection refers to the process

Figure 2. Overall structure of the system
of identifying, selecting, and collecting data from data
sources. The data collection method of this study is mainly
machine collection, and manual collection of text data is
auxiliary.
c) Web Crawler: Using Web crawler technology to
crawl entities, property and entity-to-entity relationships
from websites, such as the CFDA, Chealth online, CMKB
and Chinese Wikipedia and so on. The data obtained using
Web crawling techniques is mainly medical data and
geographical data.
d) Data interface: We uses the API approach to collect
pollen
concentration,
weather
information,
such
as
temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and wind power
at the Beijing Meteorological Bureau and China Weather
Network.
e)
Manual
collection:
The
paper
uses
manual
extraction to extract data from literature and books. This is
because the amount of data in the literature is small, and the
content required is cluttered. Manual extraction can improve
accuracy. Through manual extraction, we collected pollen-
related information and medical data.
C.
Data Integration
This brief data integration process is shown in Figure 4.
First, we store the collected data in a temporary database.
After data cleansing, conversion, and other normalization
processes, we integrate and store the data. In this study, we
store data in different categories. The conceptual data and
entity data used to construct knowledge graphs are stored
and integrated by Neo4j graph database [13]. Then, other
pieces of information are stored in a relational database.
The paper integrates the data from three aspects, such as
the relationship between entities, different dimensions and
application integration.

The relationship between entities. The paper has
constructed
a
knowledge
graph
that
uses
the
relationships between entities. Knowledge graph
would dynamically present and manage the data that
cannot be statically stored and displayed, allowing
users to search for the medical information on
pollinosis and conduct data mining. There are
semantic relationships between diseases, doctors,
Figure 3. Data Model of Property Graph
hospitals, medicines, checkups and pharmaceutical
companies, such as “belong to”, “treat”, “examine”.
The paper first constructs a property graph for
knowledge graph to quickly and accurately construct
a disease-centered knowledge graph.

Different dimensions. We analyzed factors affecting
pollen concentration from different dimensions ，
such as space, time and disease. First, the paper
conducts a statistical analysis of pollen concentration
and geographic partition, climate types, months,
related diseases, allergens and other data. Then, an
airborne allergenic pollen map including the regional
spectrum, the monthly spectrum, and the disease
spectrum was constructed. In addition, we displayed
in a visual form, such as a nightingale's rose diagram,
a doughnut chart, map and so on.

Application integration. In order to make every page
of this system not isolated, this study integrates
applications so that they are "alive" and can be
associated with other Web pages.
IV.
AIRBORNE POLLEN PREDICTION MODEL
There are few studies on airborne pollen prediction
model. Several popular algorithm models include neural
network models [14][15] and multiple regression algorithms
[16][17]. Considering many factors, such as data volume,
localization, and authoritativeness, this system adopts the
airborne pollen prediction model announced by the Tianjin
Meteorological Bureau, which is funded by the China
Maritime
Affairs
Bureau's
new technology
promotion
project “pollen detection and service”.
This is a staged prediction model. According to the high,
low and stable development trend of pollen concentration,
the whole pollen period is divided into 6 stages: In the first
stage, the pollen begins to peak in spring; The second stage
is the peak period to the spring sub-peak; The third stage the
sub-peak to June; From the middle of June to the beginning
of August, it is the fourth stage; The fifth stage is from the
late August to peak in autumn; after the peak period, when
the pollen is over it drops to sixth stage. The multiple
regression model is as follows:

CONCLUSION
Compared with other existing websites, PKGAWAS has
the following four aspects of innovation: a) multi-source
cross-border data integration; b) multi-dimensional data
association analysis; c) dynamic interactive knowledge graph;
d) personalized custom service. However, due to the lack of
pollen concentration data, there is still much work to be done
in the future. First, we will use a crowdsourcing approach to
collect pollen concentrations in the country. The second is to
seek
cooperation
from
the
China
meteorological
administration to jointly carry out early warning service for
pollen allergy.
