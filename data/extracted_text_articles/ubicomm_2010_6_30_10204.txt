Abstract— This paper proposes, analyzes and evaluates a novel 
user-oriented Radio Resource Management (RRM) strategies 
for coexisting WiMAX/WLAN reconfigurable system. The 
proposed strategies are based on game theory concepts, where 
games are dynamically played depending on the system 
condition with the applications on the terminal modeled as 
players. User’s terminals have two interfaces, which can be 
used for enforcing reconfigurability by deploying RRM 
strategy that results in appropriate network selection for each 
application. The proposed RRM strategies are distributed and 
they map rationality behavior by adopting two game theory 
concepts: Nash and Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE). 
These RRM strategies are compared with SNR based strategy. 
The effects of particular strategy are evaluated in terms of 
user’s average throughput and the initiated application 
handovers. The results present guideline framework for 
distributed terminal management in reconfigurable systems.

 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, there are number of design and 
realization strategies for reconfigurable wireless systems 
due to their paramount importance in delivering 4G 
concepts [1]. Reconfigurable systems are envisioned as the 
future providers of rich multimedia content via various 
wireless links. The dynamic resource allocation strategies in 
such systems tackle crucial problems that lead to 
performance degradations in the wireless medium [2]. 
Furthermore, these strategies can be used to utilize 
particular network in the system by appropriate selection 
that will result in performance increase. The challenging 
task is the design of such strategies. 
This paper proposes, analyzes and evaluates novel user 
oriented 
dynamic 
allocation 
strategy 
for 
user 
reconfigurability based on game theory concepts. The 
strategy is distributed at each user terminal and evaluated in 
a simulated WiMAX/WLAN reconfigurable system. User’s 
terminals have two interfaces [3], one for each available 
network in the reconfigurable system. The result of the 
strategy is an appropriate network selection for the 
applications started on the terminal. This selection is made 
by game theory modeling, where players are the 
applications on the terminal and they can select WLAN or 
WiMAX. The result of the game differs due to the degree of 
rationality in the decision (Nash, QRE) and due to changes 
in the system (fluctuations of the received SNR from the 
networks). The general idea is to test how rationality of the 
distributed 
decision 
influences 
the 
overall 
user 
performances. Completely rational decision is modeled with 
the Nash equilibrium solution, whereas specific stochastic 
decision is modeled with QRE equilibrium. Furthermore, 
these two decisions (Nash based and QRE based) are 
compared with SNR based strategy.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section II gives short 
background of game theory and explains the decision 
making for Nash and QRE equilibrium solutions. Section III 
explains the deployment of both game theory based RRM 
strategies (Nash and QRE) and the classical SNR based 
strategy. Section IV elaborates details of the system model 
with simulation setup, analytical definition of utility and 
presents the performance results in terms of application 
throughput and the application handover initiation. These 
results are used for comparison between the three decisions 
based on Nash, QRE and SNR. Finally, Section V concludes 
the paper.

GAME THEORY SCOPE 
Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics. By 
using mathematical description and modeling, game theory 
concepts provide useful tool to analyze scenarios in which 
particular features can be modeled with games. The 
participants in the game are labeled as players. Each player 
has possible set of actions (strategies) that it can deploy and 
a preference that should be achieved during the game. The 
conflict of interest between the players implies that each 
player decision influences the preferences of the other 
participants in the game. Player’s preferences are modeled 
with a utility function that depends on the scenario and the 
game model [4].  The main objective of the players in the 
game is to maximize their preferences by optimizing the 
utility function with appropriate deployment of their 
strategies. The solution concept in which referent player in 
the game is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of 
the others and none of the players has any gain when 
unilaterally changes the strategy is Nash equilibrium [5]. 
The Nash equilibrium is a result of totally rationality of the

players, meaning that each player behaves in utility 
maximizing manner by playing the best possible response to 
other player’s strategies.  
Alternative approach to solve a game is the concept of 
bounded rationality. When the player’s behavior is modeled 
with bounded rationality they do not always play the best 
response to other player’s strategies. This approach implies 
stochastic decision for the strategy deployment where better 
actions are played with higher probability than worse 
actions. Stochastic decisions with bounded rationality can 
be more effective in particular cases. Nash equilibrium is 
optimal for rational players, however it may not be optimal 
for irrational players. The reason for irrationality occurrence 
may be due to dynamic changes of the modeled system or 
due to incomplete knowledge of all parameters that may 
influence the game outcome. Quantal Response Equilibrium 
(QRE) [6] is a solution concept of a game based on bounded 
rationality in which each player strategy is a stochastic best 
response to other player’s strategies. There is a precision 
parameter (  ) within the QRE choice function that defines 
the degree of rationality in the decision making process. 
When this parameter is set to zero, the decisions become 
totally random, whereas for infinity value of the precision 
parameter the QRE equilibrium converges to Nash 
equilibrium.   
The Nash solution is optimal for total rationality of the 
players. This rationality requires selection of the optimal 
strategy. For two possible strategies (A and B) and utility 
function u that maps the strategies in preferences, the 
rational player will do the following: 
 
u(A) > u(B), play А; 
 
u(A) < u(B), play B; 
 
u(A) = u(B), play random; 
The QRE solution is based on stochastic choice, where 
for two possible strategies (A and B) the player will do the 
following: 
 
u(A) + ξa  >  u(B)+ ξb, play А; 
 
u(A) + ξa  <  u(B) + ξb, play B; 
 
u(A) + ξa  =  u(B) + ξb, play random; 
where ξ is a random variable with zero mean value that can 
be observed as additional shock in utility calculation 
(mistakes in mapping the strategies to the preferences). The 
following equation denotes the probability for a player to 
play strategy A with the QRE solution:

The two game theory concepts map the degree of 
rationality in the decisions. The RRM strategies are based on 
this decision process, which is completely distributed. 
Hence, the obtained results evaluate the effect of rationality 
on overall user’s performances (application throughput and 
handover initiation) in a reconfigurable system. 
III. 
GAME THEORY BASED RRM 
The user oriented RRM strategies proposed in this paper 
are based on Nash and QRE solution concepts. The 
implementation of the RRM strategies is for a terminal that 
has two interfaces (WiMAX, WLAN) that enable 
communication with the reconfigurable WiMAX/WLAN 
system. There are two data applications on each user 
terminal labeled as players in the game. This is done only 
for simplicity. The same approach can be used for more 
applications which can only lead to more complex 
computation of the equilibrium. Possible strategies for the 
players are to use WiMAX or WLAN network. The player’s 
preferences in the game are defined with utility (application 
based metric) that depends on the application type and the 
specific PHY and MAC parameters of the component 
networks in the reconfigurable system. The general game 
setup is given in Table I, where P1 and P2 denote the players, 
WiMAX/WLAN are the possible strategies and with U as the 
appropriate utility for the particular strategy (e.g. Uwimax(1)  is 
the utility of P1 for the WiMAX strategy).

The outcome of the game is a network selection per 
application on each terminal. When Nash based strategy is 
deployed the decision for selecting network for the 
application is totally rational. In contrast, the QRE strategy 
deploys stochastic decision that depends on the precision 
parameter in the QRE choice function. The QRE strategy 
adopted in the paper deploys opposite strategy of the one 
selected with Nash. This can be achieved by adaptive tuning 
of the precision parameter that defines the probability for 
playing a certain strategy. To compare, if the Nash strategy 
selects the two applications to remain on one network, the 
modeled QRE strategy parts the applications on both 
networks. The game on each terminal is dynamically played 
and the decisions are updated, since the variations in the 
wireless channel and network availability change the utility 
perception of the mobile user.  
The two game theory based RRM strategies are 
compared with classical SNR based strategy. This approach 
selects the interface with higher SNR for both applications. 
Additional intelligence in the SNR decision making is 
introduced by mechanism that parts the applications on both 
networks only when the SNR on the inactive interface 
exceeds the SNR value on current active interface (both 
interfaces have very high SNR). Comparing the SNR and the 
game theory RRM, the latter provides further intelligence by 
specifying why and which application should be run on 
particular network (since they are modeled as players).

IV. 
SYSTEM MODEL & PERFORMANCES 
The following subsections elaborate the system model 
(simulation platform, utility functions) and present the 
evaluation of the decisions rationality within the game theory 
RRM. The results are compared with the SNR approach. 
A. Simulation platform  
The simulations are made in combined manner by 
utilizing three environments: QualNet [7], Java and Gambit 
[8]. The simulation platform is presented in Figure 1. 
Qualnet simulator is used to configure WiMAX/WLAN 
reconfigurable system and the terminals with two interfaces. 
 
 
Figure 1.Simulation concept 
 
The WiMAX cell has full coverage over the simulation 
area, whereas the WLAN has smaller coverage area which 
is completely within the WiMAX cell. As a result, the 
WiMAX network is always available for the users, whereas 
the WLAN is not because according to the mobility model 
the users can leave the WLAN coverage. The configuration 
parameters for the networks are given in Table II.

When the simulation in QualNet is finished, the 
following parameters for every terminal (user) are 
transferred in Java environment: 
 
The time when an SNRwlan value is received  
 
The appropriate SNRwlan value in dB  
 
The time when SNRwimax value is received  
 
The SNRwimax value in dB 
These values are used for definition of the user. The user 
is created from a defined Java class. Additionally, there are 
Java classes for the applications, strategy deployment and 
results monitoring. The strategy deployment in Java is done 
by coordination with the Gambit environment that provides 
Nash and QRE solution for the games. In Java, the 
parameters from QualNet and Gambit are combined and the 
results for average application throughput and the initiation 
of application handovers are obtained with event driven 
simulation. 
B. Analytical utility model 
The utility is application depended metric that shows 
how the application quality is perceived by the users. There 
are different approaches for estimating utility value for a 
particular application. References [9, 10] elaborate the 
concept of utility functions design and their application as 
metrics within RRM and optimization strategies in wireless 
systems. It shows that the utility function depends on the 
application type. For example, the on/off nature of the voice 
applications results in a steep utility function. References 
[11, 12] show approaches for estimation of the utility 
function for voice applications. The utility function for data 
application is a smooth curve due to the data elasticity. 
There are different utility functions designs depending on 
various technical parameters that “describe” the application 
flow in the wireless links.  
This paper proposes RRM strategies for elastic data 
applications with adaptive throughput that can vary due to 
the conditions in the channel and available network 
resources. Such model can be used for variable data services 
corresponding to file download. In addition, they can be 
used within the game theory model since they do not have 
delay constrains. The utility depends only on the 
throughput. The adopted function for modeling the utility is 
given in [13, 14]: 
                  
*log[ *

              (2) 
where R denotes the application throughput, PER is the 
packet error rate (predefined value 0,01) and a,b are 
dimensioning constants that depend on the maximum and 
minimum possible throughput in each network. The utility 
function depends only on the throughput and the specific 
modeling of the wireless system. The utility in WiMAX and 
WLAN is presented as follows, with a framework method 
that can be used for more complex approaches in utility 
based network dimensioning. 
1) WLAN 
The WLAN system in QualNet is based on IEEE 802.11a 
standard. The PHY modes that define the communication 
with the appropriate rate and SNR given in Table III [15].

   The effective throughput depends on the procedures on 
MAC layer. The adopted approach is to use only half of the 
physical bitrate as effective throughput due to the MAC 
procedures. This means that maximum available throughput 
(Rmax) for the application will be when the AP PHY mode 
is 6 and serves only one user. Minimal available throughput 
(Rmin) will depend on the predefined number of maximum

possible users on WLAN who share the network capacity. 
This number can be predefined with admission control 
procedure (adopted value Nmax=10). Adopting this 
approach, the equations (3, 4) are used for calculating the 
minimal and maximal throughput in the WLAN network. 
The maximum and minimum throughputs are then used to 
create system of two logarithmic equations according to (2). 
By setting maximum (=1) and minimum (=0.1) possible 
values of the utility function, system of logarithmic 
equations is formed.

These equations are used to define the utility values. The 
adopted approach for estimation of WLAN utility is done in 
simplistic manner by using only half of the physical 
throughput. Alternative approach for utility estimation of 
the WLAN can be with OFDM analysis. This type of 
estimation is done for the WiMAX system as elaborated in 
the following subsection. 
2) WiMAX 
The WiMAX system in QualNet is based on IEEE 
802.16e standard. Estimation of the utility for WiMAX is 
performed by PHY and MAC analysis of the WiMAX 
technology. The received SNR in WiMAX defines the 
modulation and the coding used for sending appropriate 
number of bits/symbol. This mapping is given in Table IV 
[16]. The number of subcarriers in the system is N=2048 
and the channel bandwidth is B=20MHz. The effective 
duration of the symbol is obtained in standard manner 
according to [17]:

where Ts=1/fs, and fs=8/7B. The guard interval between the

The total number of symbols (Tot_Sym) is obtained from the

standard, but for the analysis duration of 5ms is used.  
This total number of symbols (Tot_Sym) is obtained 
when the MAC frame duration is divided with the total 
symbol duration.  From the total number of symbols only 
the symbols used for data transfer are labeled as effective 
and are used for defining the utility function. The effective 
number of symbols (Eff_Sym) is given with the following

The approach for estimation the utility of the WiMAX 
system is done according to the analysis elaborated in [18], 
where the total number of symbols for all active users 
(Us_TotSym) in WiMAX depends on the frame duration

where R is the available throughput for the incoming user, 
Nssi is the number of serving users with appropriate

values for bits_symi in equation (12) correspond to the seven 
mappings (index i denotes particular row) in Table. IV. For 
example, if there are 3 users with SNR < 3, than for i=1 in 
(12), Nssi =3 and bits_symi =96 for the three users. The 
throughput is used to model the utility for WiMAX with

C. Performance evaluation 
The simulations with the proposed simulation platform 
are performed with 8 users in a square simulation 
environment (1000x1000m) with 16 running applications. 
The simulation duration is 600s in order to provide 
sufficient statistical regularity of the results. This implies 
that further increase of the number of users (and thus the 
number of the applications) will not change the trend of the 
results. The user’s follow random waypoint mobility model 
and communicate with the networks on two separate 
channels. The path loss model is two-ray and the shadowing 
factor is 4dB. The performance evaluation of the three RRM 
strategies based on Nash, QRE and SNR are presented with 
the following parameters of interest: 
 
Dynamic allocation of applications per networks 
 
Average application throughput on WiMAX 
 
Average usage of WLAN  
 
Application handovers 
The results for the dynamic allocation of the applications 
with Nash/SNR/QRE decisions observed on WiMAX and 
WLAN networks are given on Figure 2. and Figure 3.  
 
Figure 2. Dynamic distribution of the user’s application on 
WiMAX network with Nash/SNR/QRE decisions 
 
Figure 3. Dynamic distribution of the user’s application on 
WLAN network with Nash/SNR/QRE decisions 
The analysis of this parameter shows the load balancing 
feature of the distributed RRM in the reconfigurable system. 
Because the terminals do not have network related 
information (number of serving users, applications, etc.), 
they estimate their utilities dynamically for the game 
according to static network parameters and on their input in 
the network (two applications). The results show that using 
SNR and Nash strategies similar results are obtained for the 
load balancing, resulting in very rare usage of the WLAN. 
The QRE strategy, since it is tailored to do the opposite of 
Nash, results in frequent WLAN usage. In this sense, the 
QRE strategy provides better load balancing in the 
distributed decision making process. 
The average application throughput per user on WiMAX 
is shown in Figure 4. This parameter is averaged during the 
simulation time because WiMAX is always available (full 
coverage) for the mobile users in the scenario.  The average 
application throughput per user is a mean value of the 
throughput that both applications experience on the user 
terminal. The results show that QRE yields highest 
application throughput per user compared to SNR and Nash 
strategies which have similar performances. 
 
Figure 4. Average throughput per application for each user 
on WiMAX network with Nash/SNR/QRE decisions  
The average usage of WLAN AP is shown on Figure 5, 
measured as throughput. It shows how much the AP was 
used during the simulation time on average by the users.  
The QRE strategy invokes highest usage of the WLAN AP 
due to the dynamic distribution of the applications on both 
networks. SNR and Nash have similar average AP usage. 
This parameter is also linked to the previous parameter that 
showed the average throughput per application for each user 
on WiMAX. When the deployed RRM yields more frequent 
AP usage in the scenario it produces lesser load on WiMAX 
and thus WiMAX throughput increase on average basis.  
The application handovers are shown on Figure 6, in a 
normalized manner, where the strategy with the highest 
number of handovers (QRE) corresponds to 100%. This 
parameter shows how much handovers are occurred in the 
reconfigurable system for all of the user’s applications with 
each RRM strategy. In addition, this parameter shows how 
the RRM strategy is prone to performing vertical handovers 
in the system. This parameter is highest with QRE

technique, whereas Nash results in slightly higher handover 
initiation compared to SNR. There is an imminent 
degradation of quality when vertical handover occurs 
because the reconfiguration of the communication protocol 
stack on the link user-network disrupts the service quality. 
In this sense, the QRE results in highest performance 
degradation compared to SNR and Nash.

The performance results depend on the analytical 
modeling of the utility, the analysis of the networks and the 
scenario model.  However, the presented framework 
approach is general and applicable in similar environments 
where terminals deploy distributed RRM to explore 
reconfigurability benefits and maximize their preferences. 
Furthermore, the results show the tradeoff between the 
throughput of the application and the handovers initiations as 
degradation factor. Such tradeoff should be considered when 
managing terminals in reconfigurable systems. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes and evaluated novel user oriented 
RRM strategies for reconfigurable WiMAX/WLAN system. 
The strategies are distributed, based on game theory concepts 
(Nash and QRE), where the game is played by the 
applications on each terminal modeled as players. The RRM 
strategies result in appropriate network selection for each 
application on the user’s terminals and are compared to SNR 
based strategy. The results show the tradeoff between the 
load balancing, user’s throughput and handover initiation 
between the strategies. The provided framework can be used 
in distributed RRM strategies to tune user preferences by 
balancing application’s throughput demands and handover 
initiation between the networks in the reconfigurable system.
