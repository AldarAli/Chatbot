Abstract—Resource virtualization has been known and used
for a while as a mean of better hardware utilization and
cost reduction. Recently, the idea of virtualization of network-
ing resources has become of vital importance to networking
community. Among other things, this is connected with the
fact that the virtulization principle is built in many discussed
Future Internet (FI) architectures. In this study we deal
with the virtualization of networking resources offered by
Xen virtual machine monitor. We are especially interested
in the performance isolation across virtual network adapters.
Firstly, we demonstrate several problems with the performance
isolation. In particular, the results of a number of experiments
in which the activity of one virtual machine inﬂuences the
network performance of any other are presented. We also
examine the fairness, predictability and conﬁgurability of the
network I/O scheduler in Xen. Secondly, we propose solutions
to the problems revealed by our experiments. In particular,
we introduce prioritization into Xen Netback driver, add
a veriﬁcation mechanism to the output buffer and discuss
possibilities of some other improvements.

work scheduler.
I. INTRODUCTION
The increasing number of different IT services are making
the virtualization idea a very important aspect of computer
science. Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) bring about
the dynamic resource allocation and enable full utilization
even of the most powerful servers, while still maintaining
good fault isolation between virtual machines (VMs, also
called domains in Xen). However, the services provided
over the network may require a certain quality, which is not
easy to ensure in a virtualized environment. Several VMs
can share the same physical network interface as well as
other hardware (processor, memory etc.) what likely makes
one VM affect other VMs’ performance. Therefore, the
performance isolation is crucial in case of some applications
and has to be carefully veriﬁed.
In this paper, we focus on Xen VMM, [2], which is one
of the most popular virtualization platforms and an Open
Source project. Firstly, we present a study of the network
performance isolation between Xen virtual machines. Differ-
ent test scenarios allowed us to identify several problems.
Secondly, we carefully analyze the Xen CPU scheduler and
the network I/O scheduler to ﬁnd out their possible source
and resolution method.
The motivation behind our study is the fact that virtu-
alization of networking resources has recently became of
vital importance to networking community. This is partly
connected with the fact that the virtualization principle is
built in many projects dealing with propositions on the
Future Internet architecture, for example in 4WARD FP7,
[3], FIA MANA, [4], AKARI, [5], PASSIVE FP7, [6],
GENI, [7], IIP, [8]. As observed in [9], creating high-
level abstractions of networking resources, that cover the
underlying physical infrastructure and implementation may
help to overcome several drawbacks of the current Internet
architecture. For instance, virtualization allows coexistence
of multiple networking technologies in the network layer
and offers a possibility to deploy easily new architectures,
protocols and services.
The remaining part of the paper is structured as follows.
First, a short account of the literature connected with the
subject is given in Section II. In Section III-A, Xen general
architecture is overviewed. Then, a detailed Xen networking
structure is presented in Section III-B. A description of the
Xen schedulers is presented in Section III-C. Section IV-A
describes the testing environment and its parameterizations.
The results and discussion on them are contained in Section
IV-B. Finally, propositions of methods for improving the
network performance isolation in Xen are presented in
Section V. Conclusions are gathered in Section VI.
II. STATE OF THE ART
This study veriﬁes that there are problems related to the
performance and isolation of virtualized network resources.
Network adapter sharing and scheduling without virtualiza-
tion is well described in literature. Virtualized environments,
however, introduce additional software layer what does not
allow to apply directly the existing solutions. Consider-
ing virtualized environments several previous studies [10]–
[16], [27]–[29] focus on analysis of the performance of
I/O operations and some of them present partial solutions.
Unfortunately, these studies do not examine isolation and
manageability in the ﬁeld of resource sharing in considered
virtualization platforms. In [17], however, the authors tried
to approach the performance isolation problem focusing
on all kinds of resources. Unfortunately, this study was
performed on older version of Xen with an older CPU sched-

uler implementation. They assumed that the main source
of the problem is connected with CPU assignment and
scheduling. As they have proven such general improvement
idea can partially increase the performance isolation of
all resources. We think, however, that to achieve really
good performance isolation across virtual network adapters,
the proposed CPU scheduler improvement is not the only
change that has to be made because in the existing Xen
networking implementation packet scheduling is performed
randomly. We present that even on a low CPU utilization
the problem is still noticeable and is related to the network
scheduler itself. We have veriﬁed that applying a modiﬁed
(for virtualization purposes) Weighted Round Robin (WRR)
network scheduler improves the performance isolation and
provides better control over virtual network devices.
III. XEN VIRTUALIZATION ARCHITECTURE
A. Xen VMM
Different virtualization environments have been developed
throughout the years. Xen, due to its unique architecture
(Fig. 1), is one of the leading solutions. The core of Xen,
which is responsible for control over all virtual machines,
is a tiny operating system called Xen Hypervisor. Its main
tasks are CPU scheduling, memory assignment and interrupt
forwarding. In contrast to other VMMs, the virtualization of
all other resources is moved outside the hypervisor. Such
original approach has the following advantages:
• Device drivers are not limited to the hypervisor op-
erating system because they are installed on a virtual
machine (any OS),
• Device drivers, as the most vulnerable software, are
isolated from the hypervisor, signiﬁcantly increasing
the stability,
• Distributed virtualization of resources allows creation
of several driver domains, eliminating the single point
of failure,
• Small hypervisor operating system is much more reli-
able, efﬁcient and stable.
There are two main virtualization methods. The ﬁrst one
allows to run any kind of OS and emulates all the necessary
hardware to create an impression that the guest system is
running on a physical machine. Second approach is to run a
modiﬁed guest operating system, which is ”aware” of being
virtualized. The latter, called paravirtualization, is much
more efﬁcient, but limited to some operating systems only.
Xen provides both methods, but performs much better in the
paravirtualization mode, which will be the only method used
further in this paper.
To make the I/O operations as fast as possible, Xen
introduced also paravirtualized device drivers. Each guest
domain (Xen VMs are also called ”domains”) has the front-
end drivers installed. Such drivers, provided with Xen,
are communicating with the back-end drivers running on
a special driver domain (Dom0 in Fig. 1). All requests
addressed to a certain hardware are ﬁrst scheduled and
processed by the back-end driver, then are sent to the
standard device driver inside the driver domain and ﬁnally
reach the hardware. Thanks to Xen internal page-ﬂipping
mechanism called XenBus [18], [19] such solution is much
more efﬁcient than the standard emulation technique.
B. Xen networking architecture
To perform analysis of the network-related problems it
is necessary to explain Xen networking architecture in
detail. For each virtual interface the back-end network
driver, called Netback, creates a virtual network interface
in domain0 called vif. All virtual interfaces which share
140

the same physical device are connected with it using a
standard Linux level-2 bridge. The Netback process which
is responsible for handling trafﬁc of each virtual interface
is scheduling this trafﬁc and passing it to the bridge. The
existing scheduling scheme implemented in Xen by default
is a simple Credit Scheduler and will be described in section
III-C2. Finally, the bridge passes the packets to the device
driver output queue and the device driver sends the packets
to the hardware. Figure 2 presents the outgoing trafﬁc path
through Xen virtualization platform.
Such solution has several advantages. Firstly, the admin-
istrator has direct control over virtual interfaces from within
domain0. Secondly, it is possible to monitor and analyze the
packets passing through these interfaces using standard tools
like tcpdump [20] or wireshark [21]. Finally, the trafﬁc can
be ﬁltered and manipulated on the bridge level by creating
custom ethernet bridge rules using ebtables [22] utility. All
the above can be applied for both in and outgoing network
trafﬁc.
C. Xen schedulers
The main goal of this study is to examine the network
performance isolation across Xen guest domains. It means
to check if activity of one virtual machine inﬂuences the
network performance of any other. The resulting knowledge
is of great importance from the perspective of many network-
related applications.
There are two elements in Xen, which may inﬂuence
such isolation, namely the CPU scheduler and the network
I/O scheduler [23]. Despite the fact that the schedulers are
very simple algorithms, their analytical analysis is still far
from being solvable. Creating a mathematical model of such
systems even with large approximation is a very complex
task and very often proves to be impossible. In the following
two sections a description of the two schedulers is given.
1) CPU Scheduler: The fundamental part of each multi-
tasking operating system is the CPU scheduler. Its aim is to
create an impression that all running processes are executed
in parallel. Typically, there are much more processes than
available physical CPUs and the processes have to share
CPU time. The scheduler is responsible for this division.
Inside Xen VMM, the hypervisor is the main operating
system running on the physical machine. It is responsible
for scheduling physical CPU time among virtual machines.
To make the process easier the term virtual CPU (VCPU)
is introduced. Every VM in Xen can have multiple virtual
processors. Also, every domain is running operating system
with another scheduler, which divides a VCPU time among
processes running inside the guest operating system. The
hypervisor on the other hand, schedules the physical CPU
time among VCPUs.
The newest version of Xen uses the credit scheduler [24],
[25]. It assigns two parameters for each domain - weight
and cap. The weight deﬁnes how much CPU time a domain
gets comparing to other virtual machines. The cap parameter
is optional and describes the maximum amount of CPU a
domain can consume. Using this two parameters the number
of credits can be calculated. As a VCPU runs, it consumes
credits. While VCPU has existing credits, its priority is
called under and it gets CPU time normally. When there are
no credits left, the priority changes to over. Each physical
CPU maintains its own local VCPU queue. In the ﬁrst place,
the VCPU tasks with priority under from the local queue are
executed. Then, if there are no VCPUs with priority under,
the scheduler looks for such tasks in other CPU queues. If
there are no tasks with priority under, the tasks with priority
over from the local queue are executed. The credit scheduler
in Xen can be summarized in the following algorithm and
diagram (Fig. 3):
1) Process preemption - the scheduler takes control over
CPU.
2) Last taken VCPU inserted back into the local queue
according to its credits number.
3) Have the highest priority VCPU from the local queue
used all its credits?
• No: Highest priority VCPU taken from the local
queue.
• Yes: SMP Load Balancing - highest priority
VCPU taken from other CPU queues.
4) Switching context to the currently taken VCPU - the
VCPU takes control over CPU.
Considering this CPU scheduler in the context of the
network performance isolation, it is worth noticing that the
scheduler operates on virtual CPUs only, so it should not
have a strong impact on I/O performance. The network
I/O scheduler, on the other hand, works as a kernel thread
inside domain0 using its VCPUs so a fair VCPU scheduling
scheme should not inﬂuence its performance. However, it
may happen that one misbehaving VM will slow down
the total responsiveness and performance of other domains.
Also, as it was presented in [17], the Xen CPU scheduler
does not take into account the amount of CPU consumed by
the driver domain on behalf of other VM. This may also have
an impact on the network performance isolation, as some
domains may use more CPU time than they are allowed.
Furthermore, a different type of I/O request (e.g., more
demanding, like disk driver requests) can potentially slow
down the driver domain and affect the network performance
of other VMs.
2) Network I/O scheduler: Looking at Xen architecture
and analyzing its source code from the network performance
isolation point of view, one can easily note that the most
interesting part is the aforementioned Netback driver. It
contains another scheduler, responsible for gathering all I/O
requests sent to a certain physical network adapter. This
network scheduler is not a complex mechanism and probably
can be improved. Its only conﬁguration parameter is the

maximum rate (parameter rate) - in fact it can be perceived
as the credits number in the scheduler. The administrator can
specify only the maximal throughput achieved by a certain
virtual network adapter. Unfortunately, there is no way to
prioritize and control the quality of service in more details.

sets a callback to process the request in next periods. Such
solution is efﬁcient, but does not guarantee any fair share or
quality. In fact, a misbehaving VM can theoretically ﬂood
driver domain with requests because it processes all of them
even those which are further rejected.
IV. EXPERIEMENTS
A. Experimental setup
To perform the tests, we installed Linux Gentoo with Xen
4.0.0 on Intel Quad Core 2 (2.83GHz), 4GB RAM, with
hardware virtualization support. Two guest domains, each
having 1 VCPU and 1GB of RAM, were created. Although
there were separate physical CPU available for each VM,
both VCPUs were pinned to the same physical CPU. Such
conﬁguration was used in order to check the inﬂuence of
the CPU scheduler on the network performance. All network
measurements were taken using iperf application. The UDP
protocol transferring datagrams of 1500B to an external host
over 100Mb link was used. We used the 100Mb link (instead
of 1Gb) to demonstrate that the isolation problems are still
present without a heavy CPU utilization. Only the outgoing

B. Results
In the ﬁrst experiment, we observed how activity of one
VM can affect the performance of another, when both VMs
are conﬁgured with the same rate parameter. Four values
of rate were used in different test runs: 25Mb/s, 30Mb/s,
35Mb/s and 40Mb/s. In every run one machine started its
transfer at the very beginning and the other started after 5s
of delay. For every rate value, the experiment was repeated
10 times and the 0.95 conﬁdence intervals were derived. The
results are presented in Fig. 5.
Firstly, we can see that the actual rate is always a little
smaller than rate parameter. As for the performance isola-
tion, it is not too bad for low values of rate. However, with
growing rate, the conﬁdence intervals are getting larger and
larger - in sample runs we can observe stronger variations of
the throughput achieved by each VM. For the value of rate
equal to 35Mb/s, the performance isolation becomes rather
weak (although only about 60 percent of the total bandwidth
is consumed). It is also worth to mention that a single VM
throughput is stable even above 80Mb/s what proves that
this effect is in fact a performance isolation issue.
Thus the only way to achieve a good isolation is to limit
virtual adapters by far, which is not a satisfactory solution.
Also, it is worth mentioning that having only the upper limit
parameter is not enough in many cases. It would be much
better to have any means to prioritize certain virtual adapter
or even to have a minimum rate parameter and a scheduler
satisfying these requirements.
In the second experiment, different rate values per each
VM were used. Fig. 6 shows results for rate = 30Mb/s
in one VM, and rate = 40Mb/s in another. The isolation
problem still remains but, what is worth noticing, both VMs
affect each other similarly.
In the presented two experiments the performance iso-
lation problem was either mild or moderate, depending on
the conﬁguration. In the following two experiments, we will
demonstrate more severe performance isolation issues.
In the third experiment, we veriﬁed how Xen divides
available bandwidth among two VMs when the maximal rate
is not set. A sample path of the throughput achieved by each

In the fourth set of tests, we wanted to verify if a
very abusive virtual machine can take more bandwidth than
others. This time we wanted to check the performance
isolation of the network I/O scheduler only, therefore we
pinned one physical CPU to each VM.
In the ﬁrst test, one domain was trying to transfer data
over one connection using full available speed, while the
second domain was using two connections, both of them
trying to achieve full available speed. In the next test, the
second domain was using three connections at full available
speed.
The results are presented in Fig. 8. As it can be observed,
the more abusive domain is, the better throughput it achieves.
Naturally, if the rate parameter had been set, the overactive
domain would never have crossed the maximum rate. In the
lower ranges however, the problem remains.

In the last experiment, we wanted to check if non-network
I/O requests can inﬂuence the network performance isolation
of another domain. During the experiment one VM was
constantly sending datagrams at full speed, while the second
VM was performing some extensive disk operations (ﬁo tool
was used for this purpose). The results are presented in Fig.
9; t0 and t1 are points in time when the extensive disk
operations were initiated and ﬁnished, respectively.
We can see that other I/O request can also have a strong
impact on the network performance. This is probably caused
by driver domain not being able to process all the I/O
requests. Block device access is being handled by separate
block device back-end drivers. Disk operations are much
more demanding in the driver domain than the Netback

drivers because disk is used by many crucial system compo-
nents and when a disk request is in a blocked state waiting
for a response all other mechanisms using disk are blocked
as well causing the whole system to perform badly.

V. IMPROVEMENTS
After detailed analysis of the problem, we have gathered
some ideas on how to modify Xen to improve the net-
work performance isolation. Currently, in the driver domain
several Netback kernel threads can be running, depending
on the number of VCPUs. Furthermore, several virtual
network adapters are mapped with one Netback kernel thread
dynamically and this single Netback thread schedules the
work using a simple round-robin algorithm, additionally
taking into account rate parameter (omitting adapters, which
used up all their bandwidth in the current period). Our idea
is to introduce two additional parameters for every virtual
adapter, namely priority and min rate. To implement the
former, it would be necessary to change the round-robin
mechanism to a more advanced priority based queue. Of
course, we have to remember that the algorithm should not
increase signiﬁcantly the time complexity. The min rate
parameter could use the same prioritization mechanism,
assigning higher priorities to interfaces, which have not yet
achieved the minimum rate. Depending on the results, it may
be also necessary to introduce a user level application for
maintaining the niceness level of each Netback thread inside
the driver domain, according to actual needs.
1) Prioritization: The very ﬁrst step to solve all the
aforementioned problems is to introduce a prioritization
mechanism into Xen’s Netback driver. This will allow for
better control over virtual interfaces and additionally sched-
ule the packets in more predictable way thus preventing
guests domains to ﬂood the backend driver with requests
what should result in improved isolation. To achieve such
functionality we implemented the simple Weighted Round
Robin algorithm [26]. We decided to use the WRR because
of its simplicity, low complexity and to present that even
the basic scheduling scheme can improve the performance
isolation by far comparing to the native random scheduler.
The actual implementation is presented in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 The implemented version of WRR scheduler
min = infinity
for each vif do
vif.weight = vif.priority/mean pkt size
if min > vif.weight then
min = vif.weight
end if
end for
for each vif do
vif.packets to serve = vif.weight/min
end for
while true do
for each vif do
if vif.has packets to send() then
counter = 0
while counter < vif.packets to serve do
event = vif.wait for event()
if event = new packet to send then
vif.process packet()
set timer to end of transmission time
else if event = timer elpased then
counter + +
end if
end while
end if
end for
end while
In a virtualized environment where a packet passes several
virtual adapters before it reaches the actual real interface and
each interface has its own input buffer, the WRR scheduler
has to be modiﬁed to guarantee that the scheduled packets
will not be dropped before they reach the wire. Dynamic and
real-time priority assignment in this scheduler was created
by additional Linux kernel sysctl parameters, i.e., prioritize
and priorities. The ﬁrst parameter deﬁnes whether to use the
WRR scheduler or not. Second parameter is an array of the
actual priority values for each virtual adapter.
Each vif has a separate queue of data to transfer and
a priority. The latter corresponds to the weight in the
implemented WRR algorithm. Total bandwidth available
at the physical link is shared proportionally between all
active virtual interfaces according to their weights. Because
the packets are scheduled at the virtual driver level, they
are processed almost immediately. This may cause wrong
behaviour when the queue gets empty and after some time
recieves a new packet while the last one is still transmitting.
In standard WRR implementation the new packet would be
transmitted because of the blocking send operation. This is
why we had to introduce a waiting mechanism (in means
145

of a timer) so that all transmitted packets are actually sent
before switching to the next queue.
To test the prioritization we performed simple experiment
where two VMs transmit data to an external host. In the
meantime the priorities were changed every second. At the
beginning VM 1 had much bigger priority, in the end VM 2
was favored in the same proportion (i.e., 30/1). The results
are presented in Figure 10.

2) Buffer overﬂow in Domain 0: After implementing the
WRR scheduling scheme the results in terms of perfor-
mance and isolation were better but still not satisfactory
especially at high throughputs (i.e., around the output device
bandwidth). Gathering a small sample of output trafﬁc at
the physical device led us to the conclusion that the WRR
scheduler is working correctly for most of the time however
sometimes the packets from different vifs are not sent in
correct amounts (according to WRR weights).
Knowing the above and that the scheduler itself is imple-
mented correctly, it became obvious that the output trafﬁc
is being distorted after scheduling. Furthermore, looking at
Xen networking architecture (see section III-B), one can
easily notice that the scheduling is applied before packets get
to the bridge and ﬁnally to the physical device output queue.
Normally, when the output queue is getting full the driver
informs higher layers and stops packet transmission using
netif stop queue function. Xen Netback driver implementa-
tion lacks a mechanism of veriﬁcation the output buffer of
physical device before sending data to bridge. This results
in distorted scheduling and larger amount of packet drops.
We modiﬁed the Netback module adding such veriﬁcation.
After detecting that the physical device output queue is full
the packet is left in the vifs output queue. Of course this
may lead to situation when the buffer of virtual interface
gets full as well what ﬁnally results in netif stop queue at
domainU level what is desired and makes the vif operation
more similar to the operation of real hardware drivers.
3) Improved scheduler results: After applying the mod-
iﬁcation we have repeated the experiments to verify if the

Figure 12.
Results of the improved scheduler for one long measurement
without rate parameter.
modiﬁed scheduler indeed provides better isolation. Figures
11 and 12 present the results.
Comparing Figures 5 and 11 it can be easily seen that
the WRR scheduler makes the bandwitdh sharing fair and
stable. There does not seem to be any inﬂuence of one virtual
interface on another. There are, however, some ﬂuctuations
(even if only one vif is transmitting) which were not noticed
in the unmodiﬁed version what makes us think this is a
minor problem which can be resolved and will be a subject
of our further investigation.
Considering Figures 7 and 12 one can see that the
modiﬁed Netback driver again makes the bandwidth sharing
fair and predictable. Both virtual machines get more or
less the same result and none is favored nor discriminated.
In our opinion, this experiment shows the most signiﬁcant
beneﬁts of applying our modiﬁcation. In unmodiﬁed Xen
environment there is no actual network scheduling what
makes the outcome (both bandwidth and delays) dependent
only on CPU scheduling and assignment. Application of
WRR scheduler inﬂuences the way virtual interfaces send
data and thus require CPU. This, as we can see, signiﬁcantly
decreases the CPU scheduling inﬂuence. Unfortunately, the
disk I/O inﬂuence is still not fully addressed by our solution
as we changed only the packet scheduling mechanism.
Probably a good idea to minimize this effect would be to ad-
ditionally use the solution proposed in ?? but unfortunately
we could not verify this as we used a newer version of Xen.
It is worth to notice that the applied packet scheduler
by improving the fairness and isolation can also positively
inﬂuence the delays. We think that for our testing scenario,
where the packet sizes were constant and the most important
factor was the throughput, the WRR algorithm was a good
choice. However, for other scenarius and use cases it might
be better to implement a different scheduling scheme which
may improve the interesting parameters. For example, when
a real IP networks are concerned the packets have random
sizes and thus it would be good to choose the Deﬁcit
Round Robin (DRR) scheduling or in case when fairness
is concerned the Weighted Fair Queueing could be used.
Of course, the more complex scheduling algorithm is used
the more overhead is caused by the networking layer thus
some schedulers may be hard to implement. In case of our
implementation the overhead is minimal and does not affect
the overall system performance.
Both the prioritization and buffer modiﬁcation presented
above may be of great use for system administrators who
are providing services to external clients and wish to have
good control over network resources and at the same time
maintain the performance isolation at higher level.
4) Further improvements: Prioritization and the afore-
mentioned buffer modiﬁcation brings a lot of new pos-
sibilities and improves the performance isolation by far.
Nevertheless, in high CPU utilization scenarios it may be not
sufﬁcient. We may think of much more complicated mech-
anisms. Virtualization makes the problem very complex, as
three different schedulers may affect the isolation: CPU
Scheduler, Domain 0 VCPU Scheduler and Netback I/O
Scheduler. To achieve best results it might be necessary to
synchronize all schedulers. Thus, partial solutions providing
the minimal rate parameter for given virtual interface may
prove very valuable. Further, a modiﬁcation proposed in
[17] may also help to increase the performance isolation
taking the aggregate CPU consumption into consideration.
Finally, we would like to test the scalability of our solution
on a better hardware with more VMs running. All these are
subjects of our future study.
VI. CONCLUSION
Xen is a powerful and stable virtualization platform,
what accompanied with its Open Source formula makes
it one of the most interesting VMMs, especially for re-
search purposes. However, when the network virtualization
is considered, the weak point of Xen is its lack of proper
performance isolation. We demonstrated this using ﬁve sets
of tests. The problems with isolation are caused by several
factors mostly connected with CPU and I/O schedulers.
We proposed the Netback driver modiﬁcation using WRR
algorithm to provide prioritization. We have also brieﬂy
presented an idea for future improvements.
