Abstract—Reflection 
from 
silver 
irregular 
arrays 
of
nanostructures on quartz and oxidized silicon substrates is
studied. It is shown that localized plasmon resonances in
reflectance spectra cannot be easily identified by their peaks like
it is done in case of extinction spectra. To clarify positions of
resonances optical properties of samples are analyzed in relation
to their design and morphology. Extinction and reflection from
as prepared, plasma etched and SiO2 covered samples are
compared. It is concluded that coupling between nanoparticles,
phase shift of scattered light and reflection from film interfaces
lead to additional features in reflectance spectra in comparison
with extinction ones. Recommendations for identification of
plasmon resonances in reflectance spectra are proposed.

INTRODUCTION
Plasmonic nanostructures are widely used in sensors,
metamaterials, solar cells, photonics and spectroscopy [1]-[5].
Effective application of these structures is based on localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) demonstrated in
ultraviolet, visible and infrared. The wavelength of LSPR
depends on material and geometry of nanostructures, their
interaction with each other and electromagnetic properties of
environment, including substrate and capping layers. Despite
on near field nature, LSPR can be observed in far field optical
measurements due to variation in optical properties of the
studied structures. Extinction is the most popular method of
LSPR registration due to its simple implementation and
straightforward interpretation, i.e., maximum and width of
extinction peak correspond LSPR wavelength and damping,
respectively. However, extinction can be measured only for
non-opaque structures, e.g., for nanostructures on transparent
substrates or for plasmonic colloidal particles. Furthermore,
extinction spectra are not effective for overlapped peaks,
when spectral deconvolution is not obvious.
LSPR on opaque substrates can be visualized by different
kinds of reflection and scattering measurements. However,
peak and trough of specular reflectance do not correspond to
LSPRs and spectrum analysis becomes problematic.
Scattering measurements require special arrangement of light
illumination (dark field) to separate low scattering signal from
strong reflection background. It limits range of measured
samples by plasmonic nanostructures on substrate surface
and, for example, plasmonic nanoparticles inside of dielectric
matrix cannot be analyzed. In case of correlated scattering
centers, i.e., when array of coupled nanostructures is analyzed,
correspondence between scattered peaks and LSPRs is broken
and LSPRs should be observed in specular reflectance.
Additionally, scattering results are obtained in arbitrary units
and cannot be used for comparison of different experiments.
This happens, due to the problems with measurement of
scattered reference spectrum for calibration procedure. In
contrast, reflectance reference spectrum can be easily obtained
for any material. Combination of total reflectance and diffuse
reflectance is especially useful for analyzing plasmon
structures, because the last one provides measurement of
scattering in absolute values.
In this paper, we propose to use total reflectance for
identification of LSPR on opaque and transparent substrates.
It is demonstrated that wavelength position of LSPR
correlates with peak and trough of reflectance in a clear way.
Furthermore, 
overlapped 
peaks 
manifest 
themselves
separately in reflectance spectra and can be easily
distinguished.
This paper is organized in a following way. In the
subsequent Section II, the details of sample preparation and
the measurement procedures are presented. In Section III, the
results of the work are demonstrated by scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images as well as reflection and extinction
spectra of the fabricated samples. The effect of the substrate
and dielectric layers on reflectance of silver nanoparticles is
discussed in Section III as well. In Section IV, the conclusions
are drawn.

METHOD
Quartz or crystalline Si wafers (4” in diameter, 0.5-mm-
thick) were used as substrates. The Al2O3 layer was grown on
the substrate by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and SiO2
layer was created by thermal oxidation of the Si wafer. Silver
layers, with a thickness of 15 nm, were deposited by electron-
beam evaporation with the deposition rate of 0.5 nm/s.
Nanoparticle arrays were fabricated by ion beam mixing
(IBM) or annealing of silver films. In case of IBM, Ag films
were irradiated by 400 keV Ar ions at normal incidence and
at low (1×1016 Ar/cm-2 ) or high (2×1016 Ar/cm-2 ) ion fluence
to produce the nanoparticles as reported elsewhere [6]. One

sample was processed by IBM with Xe ions at dose 6×1015
Ar/cm-2. In the case of annealing, silver films were heated at
350 ºC during 10 minutes. Annealing was done in diffusion
furnace in nitrogen ambient. Further details about samples and
processing can be found elsewhere [7][8]. To cover the
nanoparticles with a SiO2 layer we used a plasma enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. Metal
deposition and ion irradiation were perfomed at room
temperature. ALD and PECVD processes were run at low
temperatures 200 ºC and 170 ºC, respectively to avoid Ag
oxidation. To examine the nanoparticle formation in the
structures created, the images of the samples were taken with
a Zeiss Supra 40 field emission scanning electron microscope.
Three such images, depicting effect of IBM dose and mixing
ions are shown in Figure 1(a)-(c). One more image of the
sample prepared by annealing of silver film is presented in
Figure 1(d). The details of nanopartile size distribution and
sample surface morphology can be found elsewhere [6][9].
The optical extinction and reflection spectra were
measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV-VIS
spectrometer in the range from 250 to 850 nm. Reflectance
spectra at the angle of light incidence 8º were obtained by
using an integrating-sphere detector incorporated in the
spectrometer. Either total reflectance or diffuse reflectance
only can be measured by placing spectralon plate at the
specular reflectance angle or removing it, respectively.

ANALYSIS OF REFLECTION AND EXTINCTION
SPECTRA
In this section, we study spectra of silver nanostructures
on different substrates. In subsections III-A and III-B, visible
parts of spectra are discussed, while the subsection III-B is
devoted to UV features of the spectra.
A. Ag Nanoparticles on a Quartz Substrate
Silver nanostructures on a weekly reflecting substrate
without any additional layers between nanostructures and the
substrate are studied in this subsection. It simplifies spectrum
analysis due to excluding from consideration interference
effects. In Figure 2 (a)(b) extinction, reflection and scattering

of silver nanoislands on quartz substrate are demonstrated for
high and low dose of IBM, respectively. The corresponding
SEM images of the samples are given in Figure 1. In the
spectra, there are distinctly visible two areas: right one
(wavelength more than 400 nm) with broad and intense peak
in visible (VIS) range and left one (wavelength is less than
400 nm) with weak peak in ultraviolet (UV) range. Further,
we call these parts as VIS and UV, respectively. The high
amplitude peak is usually attributed to dipolar LSPR, whereas
the low amplitude one is connected with quadrupolar LSPR
[3] [9][10]. Theoretically, LSPR exhibits itself at the same
wavelength in extinction and scattering [2]. However, it is
valid only for isolated nanoparticles without size variation. In
Figure 2 (a)(b) we observe difference in peak positions for
extinction and diffuse reflection, while coinciding for
extinction and total reflection peaks. Standard explanation of
the observed difference is the size variation of plasmon
nanoparticles. Scattering cross-section is higher for larger
nanoparticles possessing lower frequency LSPR, while
extinction cross-section is higher for smaller nanoparticles
having LSPR at higher frequency. As a result, extinction and
scattering peaks are separated. The same argument is used for
explaining an increased full width at a half maximum
(FWHM) of peaks in comparison with calculated ones [2].
Peak asymmetry is usually explained by shape deviation of
nanoparticles from sphere to ellipsoid. It results in splitting of
one LSPR in two separate resonances (redshifted and
blueshifted), which can lead to observable shape of dipolar
peak.
UV resonance manifestation is usually attributed to valley
near 360 nm in total reflection as well as to peak at 350 nm in
extinction [6][9][11] and is ascribed to quadrupolar
resonance. There is also a peak at 330 nm in total reflection
clearly visible in low dose sample (Figure 2 (b)). As a whole,
UV features are more intense in low dose sample than in high
dose one, but dipolar peak intensity is practically the same in
both samples.
In Figure 2 scattering spectra are also shown. In
comparison with total reflectance, for which wavelength of
maximum is independent on IBM dose, difference in position
of diffuse reflection peaks is 20 nm for the low and high dose
samples. Intensity of scattering is 20 times less than intensity
of total reflection and we can equate it with specular
reflection. The samples scatter most of radiation in direction
of specular reflection. It is only possible, if all radiating points,
i.e., silver nanoparticles work in phase and have similar
radiation patterns. If we consider our samples as diffracting
gratings, then specular reflection is possible at the zero-order
grating condition on the period Ȧ, which is expressed as [12]
߉<
ఒ
௡௦௜௡ఏା௡,


where ɉ is wavelength, Ʌ is incident angle and n is refractive
index of ambient. For Ʌ = 8º and n = 1 the inequality (1) is
simplified to ȁ < Ȝ. This condition is fulfilled for all
wavelengths in our experiments and provides specular
reflection of the arrays despite of scattering of any separate
nanoparticle. Phase shift ȟɔ appearing between incident and
emitted radiation can be calculated as [1]
ο߮ = ܽݎܿݐܽ݊
ଶఉఠ
ఠబ
మିఠమ,

where Ⱦ is a damping constant, ɘ0 is the plasmon resonance
frequency and ɘ is the frequency of incident wave. According
to (2), ȟɔ is changed from 0º at low frequency to 180º at high
frequency and is equal 90º at the resonance wavelength. In
irregular array, we can consider the most probable phase shift
ȟɔA of the whole array and variable phase shift ȟɔP of an
individual particle. If ȟɔAand ȟɔP are different for the same
wavelength, then the particle is atypical and contributes to
scattering, in the opposite case the particle takes part in
specular reflection. The largest difference ȟɔAǦȟɔP happens
at resonance wavelength of the atypical nanoparticle and leads
to highest scattering intensity of the nanoparticle. Therefore,
the peak of diffuse reflection indicates wavelength of LSPR
for ensemble of atypical particles, which shape and size are
far away from the most probable ones. This peak is redshifted
relatively specular LSPR due to larger size and asymmetrical
shape of atypical particles. Therefore, diffuse reflection is
more sensitive to shape and size fluctuations of nanoparticles
than specular reflection. In Figure 2 (a)(b) the low dose
sample has higher intensity and redshift of scattering than the
high dose sample, because with increasing of IBM dose
particle shape variation diminishes and particle size
distribution converges to average size. As a result of analysis
of Figure 2 (a)(b), we can conclude that extinction and diffuse
reflection both demonstrate positions of LSPRs. However,
these positions are attributed to LSPRs of different
nanoparticles, they do not coincide and the difference exceeds
50 nm.
The low dose sample was additionally treated by reactive
ion etching (RIE) as reported elsewhere [5][13][14]. As a
result, oxide between Ag nanoislands was removed and SiO2
pillars with a height of 50 nm were fabricated. Ag
nanoparticles were left at the top of pillars. The purpose of
experiment was to change the dielectric environment and to
reduce possible coupling between nanoparticles. The obtained
spectra of pillar sample are shown in Figure 2 (c).
Additionally, in Figure 2 (b)(c) is also shown absorption ൌ
1ȂȂR, where T and R are transmittance and reflectance,
respectively. The dipolar extinction, absorption and scattering
peaks were blueshifted on 30 - 50 nm, due to replacing SiO2
(ɂ = 2.5) between nanoparticles by air (ɂ = 1). However, the
peak of total reflection was left at the same position. Intensity
of extinction and total reflection decreased 1.5 and 3 times,
respectively, but intensity of absorption and scattering
increased 2 and 2.5 times, respectively. The UV peak of
absorption and extinction (peak and valley in reflection) was
replaced by shoulder in absorption (extinction) and broad
depression in reflection. Based on absorption results in VIS
part (Figure 2 (b)(c)) we conclude that above mentioned
deviation between absorption LSPR and reflection LSPR is
attributed to different sensitivity of both methods to coupling
of nanoparticles. We suppose that short wavelength dipolar
LSPR (around 420 nm) visible in absorption corresponds to

resonance of isolated, not coupled dipoles (nanoparticles).
The long wavelength LSPR (around 500 nm) visible in total
reflection 
corresponds 
to 
coupled 
dipoles, 
where
electromagnetic field is concentrated between dipoles in SiO2.
Removing of SiO2 causes significant increase of absorption
and decrease of reflection, because coupled particles
transform in isolated ones. However, large nanoparticles at a
small distance from each other remain coupled after RIE.
They contribute in total reflection, but at longer wavelengths
due to size dependence of LSPR. As a result, this redshift
compensates the blueshift due to decrease of ɂ and peak
wavelength of total reflection is not changed.
One more variation of dielectric environment was done by
covering (capping) of Ag nanoparticles by oxide layer. It was
realized by IBM of silver layer covered by 12 nm of SiO2,
which resulted in Ag nanoparticles embedded inside of SiO2
matrix. Figure 2 (d) shows spectra of Ag nanoparticles capped
by SiO2. Intensity of VIS extinction is a little higher than in
uncapped sample, due to higher amount of silver (capping
layer prevents Ag sputtering during IBM). Intensity of total
reflection increases due to stronger coupling between
nanoparticles in the medium with higher ɂ. It is known that
radiation of dipole pair (dimer) is more intensive than simple
sum of isolated dipole radiations [4]. The more dimers appear
after capping of nanoparticles, the higher is radiation intensity.
The same effect with opposite sign decreases the total
reflection of RIE processed samples (Figure 2 (c)). Coupling
also makes VIS peaks much wider, due to increased extinction
and reflection at long wavelengths. Scattering in capped
sample is weak due to total internal reflection in SiO2 layer.
Absorption band near 400 nm is quite broad, because it is
attributed to combine effect of redshifted quadrupolar
resonance (390 nm in SiO2) and dipolar LSPR.
B. Ag Nanoparticles on a Multilayer Substrate
In the subsection III-A, we demonstrated that substrate
facilitates coupling between nanoparticles. It, in turn,
increases intensity of radiation and results in splitting of one-
peak LSPR in blueshifted (transversal) LSPR and redshifted
(longitudinal) LSPR. Furthermore, multilayer substrate
provides additional reflection interfaces and corresponding
interference patterns in reflection. We start analysis of
multilayer substrates from demonstration of phase shifting
during LSPR. Figure 3 (a) shows spectra of Xe mixed Ag
nanoparticles on 100 nm thick Al2O3 layer above c-Si
substrate. Here is also given reflectance spectrum of 15 nm
thick  Ag  film  above  Al2O3 before IBM. This spectrum
demonstrates transparency of 15 nm thick silver film and high
quality interference in Al2O3 optical cavity with Si and Ag
mirrors. The minimum at 290 nm and maximum at 380 nm
are close to theoretical interference extrema, calculated with
bulk silver optical constants. After formation of nanoislands,
the minimum at 530 nm is replaced by new one at 460 nm,
which is quite close to wavelength of scattering peak at 510
nm, i.e., LSPR of Ag nanoparticles. When in the optical cavity
one of the mirrors is replaced with plasmonic structure, the
phase shift balance for extrema is [10]
ʹο߮௣௥௢௣ ൅ ο߮௥௘௙௟ ൅ ο߮௣௟ = ܰߨ,
where ȟɔprop is the phase shift due to propagation of the wave
through cavity, ȟɔrefl is the phase shift upon reflection at the
cavity mirror, ȟɔpl is the phase shift on plasmon structure, N
is integer. Wavelength of local minimum in Figure 3 (a) is 460
nm, what corresponds ʹȟɔprop = 1.47Ɏ (nAl2O3 = 1.69).
Additional phase shift ȟɔpl = 0.53Ɏ provides condition for
destructive interference (ȟɔrefl = Ɏ) at 460 nm according to
(3). This interference happens between light waves emitted by
upper and lower lobes of dipole radiation pattern. These lobes
are coherent and in phase immediately after scattering. Then,
the lower wave radiated in the substrate acquires additional
phase shift during propagation and reflection and interferes
with upper wave. As a result, presence of optical cavity splits
LSPR in two local extrema visible in total reflection. In
contrast to extinction, where LSPR exhibits only one peak, the
reflection spectrum demonstrates peak and valley at
frequencies below and higher than resonance one. For
example, in Figure 3 (a) LSPR is redshifted on 0.03Ɏ from the
local minimum, because ȟɔpl = 0.53Ɏ and ȟɔ = 0.5Ɏ at the
resonance.
To validate this suggestion for quadrupolar LSPR, the high
dose Ar mixed Ag nanoparicles on quartz substrate were
covered by 73 nm thick SiO2 layer and 15 nm thick silver.

Figure 4.
Spectra of Ar mixed Ag nanoparticles on 20 nm SiO2 /c-Si (a)
and of annealed Ag nanoparticles on 36 nm SiO2 /c-Si (b).
Total reflection for uncapped nanopaticles, as well as
extinction and total reflection after deposition of SiO2/Ag are
shown in Figure 3 (b). Without capping oxide the obtained
reflectance spectrum is similar to spectrum in Figure 2 (b).
Capping of Ag nanoparticles by SiO2 and  silver  results  in
interference picture and reduced intensity of reflection in UV
part. The minimum at 430 nm is connected with destructive
interference in the capping SiO2 layer, i.e., ʹȟɔprop = Ɏ.
According to extinction spectra (Figure 3 (b)), the quadrupolar
LSPR is redshifted in SiO2 and takes place at 390 nm. Phase
shift of this LSPR ȟɔpl transfers uprising trend in reflection
after minimum at 430 nm in decreasing trend between 395 nm
and 370 nm. At wavelength of local minimum 370 nm
ʹȟɔprop =1.15Ɏ, ȟɔrefl = ʌ at the uppermost Ag film. It means
that additional phase shift 0.85 Ɏ due to LSPR will bring
reflection to destructive interference. The quadrupolar LSPR
is located at phase distance 0.85Ɏ -0.5Ɏ = 0.35 Ɏ from the
minimum at 370 nm, i.e., between 370 and 395 nm.
Figure 4 (a) demonstrates total and diffuse reflection for
Ar mixed Ag nanoparticles prepared on Si substrate covered
by 20 nm of SiO2. The fabrication procedure is the same as for
samples on quartz substrate in Figure 2 (a)(b). The obtained
spectra look similar to spectra in Figure 2 (b) in UV part. They
contents the same peak 330 nm and valley 360 nm.
Nevertheless, VIS parts of the spectra in Figure 2 (b) and
Figure 4 (a) are different. There are two reasons for this:
splitting of LSPR due to dipole coupling and reflection from
Figure 5.
Spectra of annealed Ag nanoparticles on bare c-Si (a).
SiO2/Si interface. According to position of the scattering peak
LSPR of isolated nanoparticles happens at wavelength shorter
than 480 nm. It provides rise of reflection around 400 nm. The
increase of total reflection for wavelengths more than 510 nm
is explained by hybridized longitudinal LSPR. The valley at
510 nm is overlapping point of coupled and isolated
resonances. Phase shift increasing of isolated LSPR takes
place between 410 nm and 510 nm. At the wavelength of 410
nm, the ʹȟɔprop = 0.29Ɏ (nSiO2 = 1.47) and ȟɔrefl = Ɏ.
Additional phase shift ȟɔpl = 0.71 Ɏ leads to peak at 410 nm.
Again, LSPR in reflection can be found between local
extrema, at the phase distance 0.21 Ɏ from the peak. The
reflection spectrum of high dose sample demonstrates one
more quadrupolar resonance at 390 nm (compare with
extinction in Figure 3 (b)). It is attributed to Ag nanoparticles
submerged in SiO2 during IBM [9].
Spectra of Ag nanoparticles prepared by annealing on
oxidized Si substrate (36 nm thick SiO2) are given in Figure 4
(b). They are similar to spectra in Figure 4 (a) in UV part. The
VIS part of Figure 4 (b) has a broader dipolar peak and
redshifted valley as compared with similar features in Figure
4 (a). Dipole coupling happens mainly through Si substrate,
due to higher ɂ of silicon. This means that thicker oxide
decreases coupling and LSPR splitting. It can be observed as
less separation of LSPR wavelengths for isolated and coupled
nanoparticles. As a result, two peaks are transformed in one
broad peak. The trough is redshifted, because the longitudinal
LSPR is blueshifted.
Figure 5 demonstrates reflection and scattering of silver
nanoparticles on bare silicon substrate. This sample was
prepared by annealing. It has the same spectrum features as
IBM samples on quartz (Figure 2 (b)), only UV minimum of
reflection is redshifted to 380 nm. Due to higher ɂ dipolar
coupling is very strong and broad range of split LSPRs from
450 nm to 900 nm is observed.
C. UV features of the spectra
All studied samples, exclude the 100 nm Al2O3/Ag and
capped ones, demonstrate 330 nm peak and 360 nm trough in
the UV part of reflection spectra. Moreover, in the RIE
processed sample, both features were observed in as prepared
nanoparticle array and disappeared after RIE (Figure 2 (c)(d)).

Therefore, existing of reflective surface with phase shift close
to Ɏ below Ag nanoparticles is essential for obtained results.
Wavelength of UV peak (330 nm) does not depend on
nanostructure shape and substrate ɂ.  The  peak  can  be
attributed to variation of reflection phase at Ag/air and
Ag/substrate interfaces according with wavelength and
coincides with maximum of silver refractive index nAg.
Replacing air by SiO2 (capping) or reflective surface by pillars
changes reflection conditions and the mentioned UV features
disappear.
Position of UV peak in absorption (360 nm) strictly
coincides with the peak of diffuse reflection (Figure 2 (b),
Figure  4  and  Figure  5).  It  means  that  this  feature  is  a
quadrupole LSPR [10]. However, its position weakly depends
on dielectric environment and for Si substrate with high ɂ
valley is moved only to 375 nm (Figure 5). At the same time,
quadrupolar LSPR of submerged in oxide Ag particles is
shifted to 390 nm (Figure 4 (a)). Additionally, extinction
coefficient of silver has minimum and reflection has
maximum at the same wavelength 360 nm (see calculated
spectra at Figure 4 (b) and Figure 5), which in turn, facilitates
destructive interference. We believe that all these factors
contribute in stable position of 360 nm valley.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated that peaks and valleys in
reflectance spectrum of nanoparticles on multilayer substrates
do not correspond directly to plasmon resonances. However,
it is possible to identify position of LSPR with accuracy of
FWHM of resonance band. This position is situated between
two local extrema of reflectance spectrum, corresponding
phase shift variation during LSPR. The spectrum features in
UV range may be attributed either to quadrupolar resonance
or to variation of reflection phase. In the first case, the valley
position depends on dielectric environment and geometry of
plasmonic structures. In the second case, the peak is fixed at
330 nm and observed only in nanostructures having silver/air
interface and formed on smooth reflecting surface. The
obtained results can be used in analysis and design of
plasmonic nanostructures on opaque substrates.
