Abstract—The implementation of telemedicine can make use of
a sensor network that carries users’ biometric information, as
collected by tiny intelligent sensors attached to the human
body. We propose a communication system that can be used
for telemedicine to improve healthcare and quality of life by
making use of bio-sensors, a sensor network and a database
with mutual authentication to ensure security. This paper also
describes the priority control mechanism in the sensor network,
the
experimental
results,
and
clarifies
the
real-time
performance of the proposed communication sensor network
system.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, the relaxing effects of visible light and aroma
have been attracting attention. A network service in which
aroma generators installed at users’ locations are remotely
controlled through the network has been proposed [1]-[3].
We expect that pain clinic doctors will be able to provide a
health care service over the network using a combination of
light
and
aroma.
We
have
investigated
a
“healing”
communication system in order to improve patients’ quality
of life (QoL). The system uses an aroma generator and a
light wavelength controller, both of which are remotely
controllable. We implemented a prototype system, and
made both psychological and physiological measurements
using an electroencephalogram (EEG).
First, the psychological effect of colour was examined
in order to determine the actually comfortable healing
environments. We examined the effect of different colors in
lighting using a 7-point Likert scale from the viewpoint of
mental health and the psychological effects that different
visible light colors provide. The result is shown in Figure 1.
The general evaluation for a healing effect was highest for
the green light and the factor ratings were: Happiness factor
(5.2625), Popularity factor (4.901), Healing factor (4.886),
and Rest factor (4.781). The evaluation for restfulness was
highest for blue light, with these factor ratings: Rest factor
(4.946), Popularity factor (4.585), Healing factor (4.272),
and Happiness factor (3.537), as shown in Figure 1 [4].
EEG is often used in a variety of fields to evaluate
multiple cerebral states. It is well known that a specific
EEG waveform is generated when the subject is in a
specific state [5]. For example, in psychiatry, sleep stages
and mental illnesses are diagnosed by their characteristic
EEG waves [6].
Figure 1. Mental Health factors of visible light color
For state conditions such as healing, it is well known
that alpha and beta waves provide important evidence for
medical diagnosis. The existence of alpha waves in an EEG
has a strong correlation with the relaxation of a subject
with eyes closed. Conversely, the existence of beta waves
in an EEG has a strong correlation with a state of active
concentration or excitement.
In our previous study, to estimate the healing effect of
certain kinds of stimulation, we considered the presence of
alpha waves in EEG records.
In our experiment, the international 10-20 system was
used for EEG measurements and referential derivation was
applied. The EEG data at electrode O1, where alpha waves
are best observed, were used. The EEG data were sampled
(at a rate of 200 Hz) with a 0.64 sec (128-point) Hamming
window. Its logarithmic power spectrum coefficients were
calculated by FFT and the spectral range of alpha waves
(from 8 to 13 Hz) was used for analysis.
We found that the healing effect on subjects is larger
when a specific combination of stimuli (lavender aroma,
blue light, and music) is given to patients than when only a
single stimulus is given. However, we found that green
LED lighting also gives a significant human body healing
effect when the brightness of the LED light was controlled
to make the brightness vary inversely with frequency [7][8].
In this experiment, we compare the power of alpha
waves recorded from subjects after irradiation for five

minutes by green LED light with a continuous spectrum
and also with light having a 1/f fluctuation. The number of
subjects was 4. The values of the power of alpha waves of
all subjects were averaged. Figure 2 shows the results of
this experiment. The power in the alpha wave band after
irradiation by green LED light with 1/f fluctuation was
higher than that after exposure to a continuous spectrum. In
particular, the power for two subjects showed a significant
difference (p=0.05). This result indicates that green light
with a 1/f fluctuation has a healing effect.

light exposure spectrum
We
verified
the
corresponding
effects
using
physiological and psychological techniques [2].
It will be possible to realize the above-mentioned
healing environments inside a patient’s premises via a
network.
Currently, there is no objective method of evaluating
the above-mentioned environments, although they will in
the future be used to deliver "telemedicine". Therefore,
healing communication systems that are reliable enough for
use in commercial applications are yet to be developed. Our
final goal is to realize healing environments and safe
telemedicine services by making use of sensor networking
technology and biomedical sensor node communication
technology with a high level of security.
We proposed a mutual authentication method which
relies on GPS (Global Positioning System) information
[9][10]. Figure 3 shows the mechanism of this mutual
authentication method. In conventional telemedicine, the
hospital authenticates patients, to prevent leakage of
personal information, but the patient does not authenticate
the hospital.
Figure 3. Proposed mutual authentication mechanism
Today, the patient should be able to authenticate the
hospital because there is the potential of spoofing of the
hospital and because authentication is necessary to ensure the
security
of
network
services.
A
reliable
mutual
authentication
method
can
be
realized
by
effectively
combining GPS information, passwords, IDs, etc.
A secure remote diagnosis service can also be achieved
by not only using a combination of GPS information and the
user’s and the hospital’s passwords but also encrypting ID
codes that are transmitted over the network. Today, the level
of location precision determined by GPS is in the range of
several centimeters, so GPS can be reliably used for
authentication.
Examples of authentication data being exchanged by the
patient and the hospital before any treatment commences are
shown in Figure 3. Information sent by the hospital contains
authentication information as well as the prescription.
Information sent from the client contains authentication
information and data about the patient’s current physical
condition, such as blood pressure and temperature.

the

which provide the appropriate recipe to control the visible

light brightness, aroma type, 1/f fluctuation type, and so on,
in the remotely located patient’s premises. These various
kinds of stimulation need to be properly selected, to take
account of the patient’s current physical and mental
condition.
The
control
program
has
many
different
parameters for controlling the visible light. Environment
sensor information such as the temperature, atmospheric
pressure, and humidity will also be utilized to assess the
patient’s environmental conditions accurately. The patient’s
physical parameters such as brain waveforms, blood
pressure, heart rate, and so on can be fed back by making
use of a high speed network and the sensor network. By
utilizing
this
network
mechanism,
the
optimum
combination
of
stimuli
can
be
appropriately
and
dynamically provided in real time, improving the patient’s
physical and mental condition.
The hospital, or other
organizations related to various medical treatments, and the
patient’s premises can be mutually authenticated by the use
of detailed information provided by a GPS information
system to ensure security.
Even if the patient is being transported in an ambulance,
the patient and the hospital can authenticate each other
using a GPS database. Furthermore, mutual authentication
can
be
applied
between
hospitals
to
establish
a
communication link and to prevent a situation in which two
hospitals might both provide the same prescription to the
same patient.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section II, we describe the practical healing communication
system which makes use of an ID-based key sharing
scheme. Then, in Section III, we clarify the performance
evaluation results obtained when using the proposed
priority
control
mechanism
and
the
sensor
database
efficiently using a stream cipher. Finally, we provide our
conclusions from these studies in Section IV.

HEALING HEALTHCARE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
If the proposed system is to be used for medical
treatment, the following requirements must be met. First,
the health care organization, for example a hospital, must
prevent the leakage of personal information. Second, from
the user’s standpoint, reliable mutual authentication is
necessary.
The
proposed
system
achieves
reliable
authentication using the position information from a GPS
system in addition to a user ID and a password.
1) Configuration of the proposed system
The configuration of the proposed system is shown in
Figure 6. The system is composed of a Monitoring Centre
and a Remote Node. The former is equipped with a GPS
device, a sensor database and a recipe database. The
Remote Node is equipped with a sensor node, which
includes a GPS device and a pulse wave sensor which
measures the user’s biometric data, and a Gateway Node,
which controls actuators such as an aroma generator and a
light wavelength controller according to a recipe received
from the Monitoring Centre, after mutual authentication has
been established with the Centre.
The operational procedure applied to the proposed
system is as follows.
(1) A medical specialist in both aroma and lighting
accesses
the
Recipe
Database,
and
selects
the
appropriate healing recipe data for individual users.
There may be individual patient and disease-related
databases for providing the appropriate recipe to
select the color of visible light, aroma type and 1/f
fluctuation pattern type, and to control the visible light
brightness in the remotely located patient’s premises.
These different kinds of stimulation need to be
selected appropriately based on the patient’s current
physical and mental condition as indicated by the
biometric sensors. In addition to environmental sensor
information such as ambient temperature, atmospheric
pressure, light level and humidity, data obtained from
body sensors and relating to the patient’s body, such
as pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and so
on, will be utilized to accurately determine the
patient’s current physical and mental state. Data
relating to the patient’s current physical condition,
such as brain waveform, blood pressure, heart rate,
etc., can be fed back via the high-speed network, and
the optimum combination of stimulations can be
appropriately and dynamically provided in real time,
so that the patient’s physical and mental condition will
improve.

An example of the recipe data format is shown in
TABLE I.
TABLE I. HEALING RECIPE DATA FORMAT
(2) A client (the Remote Node) accesses the Monitoring
Centre via the Gateway Node, and sends his or her user
ID, password, and geographical position as determined
by GPS for mutual authentication.
(3) The Monitoring Centre sends the location information
registered beforehand to the Remote Node for mutual
authentication.
(4) The Monitoring Centre and the Sensor node execute
mutual authentication as follows. The Monitoring
Centre requests the Sensor node to send information
about
its
geographical
position,
and
determines
whether
the
Sensor
node’s
position
coincides
approximately with the position of the Remote Node.
(5) After mutual authentication has been established, the
Monitoring Centre sends the appropriate healing
recipe data via the Gateway Node.
(6) The Sensor node sends measured biometric sensor data
to the Sensor Database via the Monitoring Centre. The
sensor data acquired in real time are used to evaluate
the patient’s psychological and physiological status
after the healing recipe has been applied. The results
are fed back to the medical specialist to further
improve the patient’s condition.
2) Mutual Authentication and Key Sharing Scheme.
We propose the use of an ID-based key sharing
mechanism [11] for mutual authentication. Several key
sharing schemes have been developed for authentication over
the Internet, such as Diffie-Hellman, and Kerberos [12].
These are not suitable for sensor network applications
because the processing power of a sensor node is too limited.
Another conceivable scheme for mutual authentication is a
key pre-distribution scheme, in which each sensor node
receives common keys in advance from other sensor nodes.
Usually, we have been considering a sort of client-server
type system, with each sensor connected to the hospital.
However, when we make use of multiple sensors in a
ubiquitous environment sensor network, the different sensors
need to exchange information with each other. However, the
number of keys that each node must manage increases in
proportion to the number of sensor nodes, while the memory
capacity of each node is limited. In addition, this scheme
lacks extendibility. To avoid the problems of these schemes,
we propose an ID-based key sharing scheme. This allows
prompt mutual authentication because this key sharing
scheme
does
not
require
interactive
key
information
exchange operations. The configuration of the ID-based key
sharing scheme is shown in Figure 7.
The key sharing procedure uses secret private keys. The
key management server generates secret private keys based
on users’ ID information and transmits the keys to each node
in advance over a predetermined secure communication path.
The procedure for sharing keys between communication
nodes is handled only by the nodes which have been
authenticated by the key management server in advance.
Figure 7. ID-based key sharing scheme configuration
This procedure is the basis of the proposed mutual
authentication mechanism in which communication nodes
share common keys. The common keys generated by one
pair of communicating nodes differ from those generated by
another pair of communicating nodes. This provides for
network scalability. The mathematical background of the
proposed common key generation method is as follows [13].
Let D be a private symmetrical matrix generated by the
key management server.
The matrix I is a row vector, containing values which are
equivalent to the ID information of each node. G is
calculated based on matrix D and matrix I. The column
vector G corresponds to the secret keys of the ID information.
Matrix I is a row vector containing a set of values which are
equivalent to the ID information of each node.

Therefore, a symmetrical matrix can be obtained. An
example of the common key generation is provided below,
based on this calculation.
Two nodes, say Node A and Node B, exchange their IDs,
Ia and Ib, with each other and generate keys, Kab and Kba,
using the exchanged IDs and their private keys.
These expressions show that Kab is equal to Kba, and
that the procedure for key sharing between two nodes can be
executed. We can use this mutual authentication procedure to
implement a sensor network that deploys the priority control
mechanism on the proposed sensor network itself.

The security of the proposed scheme can be enhanced by
increasing the length of the ID code in addition to adopting
the elliptic curve method [14]. An appropriate level of
security can be established to suit the required security
policy and the sensor network environment.
3) Configuration of the Intelligent Sensor
We used a Sun SPOT from Sun Microsystems for the
sensor node. Since its control program can be written in the
Java language, it is easy to develop a prototype system. The
secret key used by the user authentication server for mutual
authentication is generated at each node. Using a pulse wave
sensor and a GPS device, the Sensor Node can measure
biometric
data
and
acquire
its
geographical
position
information. The pulse wave sensor measures changes in the
amount of hemoglobin in the blood. The pulse wave sensor
circuit used is shown in Figure 8. The pulse wave sensor
irradiates the tip of a finger with light, such as an infrared
beam. The light falling on hemoglobin is absorbed, and the
light falling on the sensor is light that has not fallen on
hemoglobin, but is reflected from the blood-vessel/bone
boundary. The light caught by the optical sensor is converted
into an electrical current. After processing the corresponding
electrical current through a differential amplifier it will be
transmitted via wireless communication. The electrical
current can be converted into blood pressure data using a
current-voltage converter, a low-pass filter, and a differential
amplifier. Changes in the amount of hemoglobin can thus be
acquired.
Figure 8. Pulse wave sensor circuit
4) Healing Recipes and the Evaluation of Physiological
and Psychological Conditions
The proposed system uses pulse wave data to determine
the specific healing recipe to be prescribed. Pulse wave data
are useful for determining the condition of the autonomic
nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is divided
into the sympathetic nervous system, which represents the
active state of a living body, and the parasympathetic
nervous system, which represents the resting or relaxed state
of the body. Since the autonomic nervous system directly
affects the physiological and psychological conditions of a
person, the psychological condition of a person can be
determined objectively by measuring and analyzing his or
her biometric data [15].
Some examples of the influence of the autonomic
nervous system on the human body are shown in Table II.
TABLE II. PHYSIOLOGICAL TENDENCIES RELEVANT TO THE AUTONOMIC
NERVOUS SYSTEM
The autonomic nervous system evaluation method is as
follows. In the autonomic nervous system function, the
sympathetic nerve is in a dominant state if the LF/HF value
is high, and the parasympathetic nerve is in a dominant state
if LF/HF value is low. Generally, for the analysis of
frequency characteristics, the maximum entropy method
(MEM) is used. MEM is a parametric technique and is used
for estimating the power spectrum by making use of a linear
prediction model. Even if only a few data points are
measured,
an
adequate
spectrum
analysis
with
high
resolution can be obtained by making use of MEM. That is
the reason why MEM is suitable for analyzing the frequency
spectrum just by using the minimum amount of data. In our
experimental
system,
we
used
MEM
to
analyze
the
autonomic system function [16]. The autonomic nervous
system function is measured by the acceleration pulse wave
[17].
The acceleration pulse wave can be obtained using the
second differential of the finger plethysmograms. The
waveform pattern of the acceleration pulse is shown in
Figure 10.

decreases with age. The “waveform index” is the degree of
aging of the blood vessel as measured by the change of the
shape of the waves [18]. Generally, the b wave feature
becomes shallow, and the d wave feature becomes deep
with aging. Therefore, we can calculate the change of the
waveform index due to aging by making use of the values
d/a and b/a. Then, an arteriosclerosis degree (score) that
describes the blood vessel can be obtained.
The calculated score expresses the degree of hardening
of the artery wall and the degree of functional strain.
A
score of under 20 indicates that the degree of blood vessel
aging is low, and the flexibility of the blood vessels is
much higher than average. A score from 20 to 34 also
indicates a low blood vessel aging rate, and the flexibility
of the blood vessels is notably higher than average. A score
of 35-39 indicates a low blood vessel aging rate, and the
flexibility of the blood vessels is slightly higher than
average. A score of 40-59 indicates that the flexibility of
the blood vessels is average. A score of 60-64 indicates that
the blood vessel aging rate is a little faster than average,
and the flexibility of the blood vessels is slightly lower than
average. A score of 65-69 indicates a rapid blood vessel
aging rate, and the flexibility of the blood vessels is much
lower than average. A score of over 70 indicates a very
rapid blood vessel aging rate, and the flexibility of the
blood vessels is much lower than the average [19]. The
arteriosclerosis degree (score) evaluation formula is as
follows.
Score = 50 + 10 (X1 mean - X1 peak value) / X1
standard deviation
*X1 (Waveform index) = d/a - b/a
For evaluating the stress value in a human being it is
often effective to measure the alpha amylase activity in
saliva.
With the alpha amylase activity in saliva, the degree of
stress can be measured as a biomarker. The density of the
alpha amylase, which is one of the digestive enzymes,
changes with any active change in the sympathetic system.
There are several biomarkers that measure the degree of
stress, and cortisol is one of the typical ones. In the case of
alpha amylase, the time interval from the stimulation to the
secretion is shorter than in case of the cortisol [20].
Therefore, in a situation with significant mental stress
(acute stress) a quantitative analysis of the degree of stress
is possible by measuring the alpha amylase in the saliva.
There are several advantages to assessing the stress
value by measuring the alpha amylase activity in saliva.
The procedure is:
(1)
Non-invasive
(2)
Rapid measurement
(3)
Rapid analysis
(4)
Simple and portable measurement
(5)
Low cost
It should be noted that the alpha amylase activity in
saliva differs for each individual and also changes during
the day, so measuring the degree of difference before and
after the stimulation is essential [21].
A spectrum analysis of historical data of pulse cycles is
known to be an effective method for determining the state
of the autonomic nervous system [22]. Past studies indicate
that the fluctuation of pulse cycles of low-frequency
components (LF: 0.02 to 0.15 Hz) is related to the strength
of the activities of both the sympathetic nervous system and
the parasympathetic nervous system. On the other hand,
high-frequency components (HF: 0.15 to 0.50 Hz) are
related
to
the
strength
of
the
activity of
only the
parasympathetic nervous system.
5)
Priority Control Mechanism used in the Sensor
Network
There have been no in-depth studies on how to achieve
real-time processing for the collection of sensor data, such
as pulse data, as is required of a sensor network. To achieve
real-time performance in addition to ensuring network
security, we propose to use the above-described ID-based
key sharing scheme for implementing priority control and
for ensuring security in the sensor network. We have
evaluated the network performance of the proposed priority
control mechanism while taking various elements of the
network environment into consideration.
6) Functional Requirements for the proposed system
The functions required for priority control in the sensor
network are described below.
To protect the sensor data from eavesdropping and
tampering, the data must be encrypted in an effective
manner. For encrypting sensor data, it is necessary to
ensure security of key sharing between the communication
nodes
using
mutual
authentication
between
the
communication sensor nodes. The proposed encryption
mechanism implemented on an experimental system is
shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11. Encryption mechanism of the experimental system
Figure 12 shows an example of the format of the
encrypted
transmission
data,
which
provides
adequate
confidentiality
and
security.
To
achieve
mutual
authentication between the sensor node and the sensor
database, the sensor data must first be promptly encrypted
over the end-to-end path using common keys. In addition,
the corresponding data can also be encrypted in a link by a
link procedure using different common keys. Figure 13
shows an example of the format of encrypted transmission
data between sensor node 3 and the sensor database, which is
the final destination. The encrypted data can finally be
decrypted in the sensor database using both the key which is
the common key with sensor node 3 for link-by-link
communication and the different common key used between
sensor node 1 and the sensor database.

EVALUATION OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
A.
Evaluation of the proposed priority control
mechanism
1) Conditions of the experiment
Traditionally,
sensor
network
applications
for
environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and so on,
do not require a prompt response, and do not have to handle
operations
with
different
QoS.
However,
real-time
communication services that make use of wireless sensor
networks are becoming indispensable, in particular for
healthcare monitoring [23]. Against this background, the
priority queue monitoring mechanism and the corresponding
communication protocols have been investigated [24].
However, most of the results obtained are based on
simulations, and the substantial tradeoffs between the
different QoS requirements have not yet been established.
Consequently,
we
first
examined
the
ability
of
the
commercially available and economical Sun SPOT sensor
nodes to send data while making use of the priority control
mechanism, and ascertained the feasibility of realizing a
queuing control system easily. Communications in sensor
networks can be broadly divided into two categories: local
coordination
and
sensor-based
communication.
Before
sending information to the transit sensor node, sensors within
a local area should cooperate in order to aggregate data and
ensure reliable data transmission. However, in this paper, we
disregarded these extra conditions in order to analyze the
transmission effectiveness of a sensor node that employs the
priority control mechanism. Based on these considerations,
we
evaluated
the
delay
time
performance
under
the
following conditions.
The basic configuration of the experimental system in
which
the
proposed
priority
control
mechanism
was
implemented is shown in Figure 14. A Sun SPOT node from
Sun Microsystems was used in the experiment.
In the experimental system, sensor data were transmitted
from two sensor nodes to the sensor database, which
collected sensor data via two intermediate hop nodes in order
to
ascertain
the
performance
of
the
priority
control
mechanism. We set two levels of priority in all relay sensor
nodes: high and low priority levels. For example, a high
priority level was assigned to pulse wave data to reduce both
delay and delay fluctuation. A low priority level was
assigned to temperature data because neither its transmission
delay nor its delay fluctuation needs to be small. A different
data buffer was used for each priority level.
Figure 14. Configuration of the Experimental System
A photo of the actual sensor network is shown in Figure 15.
Here several Sun SPOT nodes are used for a Sensor Node, a
Router Node (Transit node), and a Sink Node. According to
the
specifications
of
the
Sun
SPOT
it
adopts
the
IEEE802.15.4 wireless standard (2.4-2.4835 GHz), and can
transmit packet data using QPSK modulation technology.

The size of each packet of sensor data was 20 bytes (8 bit
quantization and sampled at 20 Hz). The sensor data were
transmitted once every second. The maximum transmission
speed of data transmitted over two hops was about 5120 bps
as dictated by the specification of Sun SPOT. Two nodes can
communicate by transmitting sensor data at speeds ranging
from 3520 bps to 4800 bps.
Figure 16. The mechanism providing priority control
In the sink nodes and transit nodes, we adopted a simple
priority control mechanism in which the operation of
switching to the lower priority output buffer can be done
only after the higher priority output buffer has become
empty, although the input data are stored continuously
inside the buffer in a FIFO manner. Operation will be
switched back again to the higher priority output buffer if
higher priority data are stored in the FIFO buffer, even
when the low priority data are being output, in order to
ensure real-time performance of the higher priority data, as
shown in Figure 16.
In
this
case,
we
found
that
the
communication
bottleneck among the Sun SPOT nodes was due to a
restriction in the internal data transfer rate between the
wireless module (C2420) and microcontroller (ARM920T),
which are controlled by Java squawk in the Sun SPOT node.
When the data size is 20 bytes, the maximum data
transmission speed is measured as 5120 bps. However,
even if the data transmission rate exceeds the specified
limit for a short time, the data can be transmitted provided
that the excess amount of transmitted data does not exceed
the Sun SPOT FIFO buffer size.
The entire queuing control was implemented in the
software. The Sun SPOT adopts the 180 MHz 32 bit micro-
processor (ARM 920T) and can make use of 512 Kbyte
RAM for programs and the FIFO control buffer.
The processing mechanism of the proposed priority
control system is mainly composed of two independent
processes, as shown in Figure 16.
Figure 17 (a) shows the process that registers the
received sensor data in the appropriate priority control
stack by identifying the priority of each data item by
checking the Priority ID of the data frame, which was
previously described in Figure 12.
Fig.17 (b) shows the process flow that transmits the
data stored in each control stack according to its inherent
priority level. The high priority control stack is identified
first, and all high priority data are transmitted until no high
priority data are left in the stack. In the next step, the
process checks the low priority control stack and sends the
low priority data if any exist. After finishing this procedure,
the data transmission process reverts to the first operation
and these operations are repeated continuously.
Figure 17. Processing flow of the proposed priority control mechanism
We carried out two experiments, one using priority control
and the other without it. The transmission rates of both the
high priority and the low priority data were the same. We
measured the average data-receiving interval at the sink
node, the average delay time and the average delay
fluctuation of the transmitted sensor data. Sensor data were
transmitted continuously for 12 seconds. Considering that
about 1 second is required for call set up, we used data
measured between 2 seconds and 12 seconds.
2) Experiment Results
We classified the experimental results into two parts:
first where the total transmitted data rate was less than
5120 bps, and second where it was more than 5120 bps. As
shown in Figure 18, the transmitted data rate of 5120 bps
corresponds to the Sun SPOT internal transfer rate, so the
maximum transmission throughput cannot exceed this limit.
However, if the period of continuous data transmission is
sufficiently small, then the use of the internal buffer may
allow
the
transmission
to
be
successful
in
some
circumstances. Figure 19 shows the experimental results of
the interval between receiving one packet and the next, the
average delay time and the average delay fluctuation.
The average receiving interval was approximately one
second, irrespective of whether priority control was used or
not. We confirmed that no errors were observed at the
destination sink node. The average delay and the average
delay fluctuation increased in proportion to the total
amount of sensor data transmitted from all nodes. In

addition, the difference in the average delay and the
average delay fluctuation between high priority data and
low priority data became greater as the total amount of
sensor data increased. The reason is due to the simple
priority queuing control mechanism, implemented by the
software as mentioned above. From these experiments, we
obtained the following conclusions when we made use of
Sun SPOTs as ad hoc sensor nodes.
(1) Restriction of the total volume of sensor data and
aggregation of this data are very important in
ensuring adequate real-time performance.
(2) The software control priority queuing scheme is
very efficient in minimizing both the delay time
and the delay variation simultaneously.
(3) When the total rate of sensor data transmitted is
less than the pre-assigned maximum transmission
speed of 5120 bps, the priority control mechanism
is effective.

B. Evaluation of sensor database performance
To ensure the confidentiality of personal information,
such as measured sensor data, the sensor data were encrypted,
and a secure method was used for accessing the sensor
database.
We
evaluated
quantitatively
the
real-time
performance of the Sensor Database [25][26].
1) Configuration of the Database
The proposed database consisted of a Sensor Database,
which stored encrypted data, and a Monitoring Centre, which
stored encryption keys. A stream encryption method that
requires low processing power was employed for data
encryption, as shown in Figure.20.
Figure 20. Proposed Encryption Method
In the proposed encryption method, sensor data, which
consist of a series of plain text characters, is divided into
segments of a certain number of bits. The simplest case is
using a string of multiple bits as one word. One of the
possible reversible logical operations, such as addition,
subtraction or exclusive-OR operation, is applied to combine
the binary values (the string of bits of value 0 or 1) of one
word with those of the following word. The result of the
calculation is then stored in the location of the second of
these words and the sequence then repeated moving on to the
next word. A different reversible operation may be selected
for each word in the sequence, depending on the encryption
key information stored in the authentication server.
The result of successive execution of a reversible
operation on the original binary data can be replaced by the
original data in each word. Although the above example uses
a “word” as the minimum unit of encryption, any size can be
selected as the minimum size of the bit length. Efficient
encryption and decryption can be achieved by selecting an
appropriate bit length execution. The information history
associated
with
the
sequence
of
selected
reversible
operations
mentioned
above
is
provided
as
metadata
managed by the monitoring center, and the actual operations
were executed on the test data for the evaluation.
For example, in encrypting an item of data consisting of
three consecutive words, suppose that “1” corresponds to a
binary addition, and “0” to a binary subtraction. If the
metadata is “101” for example, a binary addition is executed
for the first and second words, and the result is stored in the
second word. After that, a binary subtraction is executed on
the second and third words, and the result is stored in the
third word. After that, a binary addition is executed on the
third and fourth words, and the result is stored in the fourth
word. In this way, metadata is used until an operation is
executed on the last word in the sequence. To extract plain
text from data encrypted as above, in the absence of the
metadata, the number of random attempts required could be
as high as 2 to the power of the number of words in the worst
case. It is therefore difficult for a malicious third party to

decrypt the data. In addition, since the size of data segment
can be changed regularly, it can be made even more difficult
to decrypt the data.
2) Experimental Methodology
In accordance with the proposed method, the processing
power (including encryption) of the sensor database in the
monitoring center was evaluated in line with the following
principle. The parameters used in the experiments were the
number of simultaneous connections to the sensor database
(users), and the capacity of the I/O buffer used for direct
access to the sensor database via a network interface. The
rate at which data was stored in the sensor database was used
as the measurement criterion. We assumed quasi-client
terminals that contained sensor nodes.
We further assumed that 100 to 300 such terminals
accessed the database simultaneously. When a sensor node
accessed
the
monitoring
center,
it
conducted
mutual
authentication using the user authentication server.
After the sensor node had received the healing recipe
data, it transmitted a series of items of sensor data composed
of pulse wave data (1kB, 8-bit data with a sampling rate of 1
kHz, for example) to the Sensor Database at intervals of one
second for several seconds. In order to examine the real-time
performance
of
the
Sensor
Database,
we
conducted
evaluation experiments to determine the conditions under
which all sensor data from 300 terminals were successfully
stored, the operation being completed as quickly as possible.
The criterion used was the rate at which the data transmitted
continuously from each sensor node was stored. Normally, a
continuous measurement of 5 minutes is sufficient to infer
whether a person is in a relaxed state or not, so experiments
were conducted for 5 minutes.
3) Results of the Experiment
Figure 21 shows the evaluation results. Parameter A used
in this experiment is the total number of sensor nodes that
accessed the database. This number is equal to the number of
users. Parameter B is the capacity of the I/O buffer in the
database. Experiments were conducted using these as the
parameters. The results are shown below.
Figure 21. Results of the System Performance Evaluation
(1) Only for Conditions 1 and 3 did the amount of
sensor
data
stored
reach
100%
of
the
total
transmitted within 5 minutes of the start of the
experiment. However, if the number of users is
greater than that applied in the above conditions, it
will be necessary to adjust the capacity of the I/O
buffer in the database.
(2) The experiments using Conditions 4 to 6 revealed
that for a fixed number of users, the effect of
increasing the I/O buffer capacity for collecting data
beyond 30 MB is relatively small.
(3) The results of these experiments identified the size
of the DB I/O memory required to implement the
system. It was found that if the number of users is in
the range of 100 to 200, a 20 MB I/O buffer in the
database was sufficient, even when sensor data
collecting services were provided simultaneously to
all sensors.
This result can be used to build a sensor network that has
real-time performance sufficient for applications for future
telemedicine.
IV. CONCLUSION
We have proposed a health care communication system
that uses GPS technology and ensures confidentiality of
personal
information.
The
system
can
be
used
for
telemedicine to improve a user’s QoL.
In
addition,
we
have
proposed
a
priority control
mechanism that uses an ID-based key sharing scheme in the
proposed sensor network both to achieve adequate real-time
performance
and
to
ensure
security
of
sensor
data.
Evaluation using an experimental system confirmed that the
average delay time and the delay fluctuation of delay-
sensitive data were reduced effectively when such data were
transmitted with high priority compared with the method of
non-priority control. We have also confirmed that a sensor
database that uses an efficient encryption mechanism for
ensuring security and maintaining the confidentiality of users’
sensor data shows excellent real-time performance.
In the future, we will collaborate with medical hospitals
and social welfare centers to realize practical healthcare
applications.
