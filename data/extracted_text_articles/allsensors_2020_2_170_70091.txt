Abstract— In this paper, a non-linear model is presented for a 
magnetostrictive force sensor and the effective parameters in the 
sensor are highlighted. It was found that pre-stress and bias 
magnetic fields are the most significant parameters.  It was 
observed that the presented force sensor has linear behavior for 
an applied force range from 100 to 1700 N.  Response Surface 
Method (RSM) was employed to analyze the sensitivity of the 
sensor against the effective parameters. It was found that the 
pre-stress and bias magnetic field and their interactions play a 
significant role in the sensitivity of the force sensor. 
Furthermore, it was manifested that the linearity can be 
enhanced by increasing the pre-stress. On the other hand, the 
sensitivity of the sensor will be sacrificed by increasing the pre-
stress. Bias magnetic field plays the same role. The sensor’s 
sensitivity can be enhanced by increasing the bias magnetic field. 
Conversely, the sensor loses its linearity in a higher magnetic 
field. Therefore, there is a trade-off between sensor sensitivity 
and nonlinearity and both are adjustable by both, pre-stress and 
magnetic bias.

 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, the force sensing element is an inevitable 
feedback element in many control systems in industries.  
Warning alarms of the seat belt in automobiles, manipulators 
of robots, and oil/gas monitoring systems are highly 
dependent on the force/pressure sensing elements. Compared 
to the traditional force sensors using strain gages, smart 
materials 
are 
promising 
better 
static 
and 
dynamic 
characteristics. Piezoelectric elements have been employed as 
smart sensors for many years [1][2]. However, the 
piezoelectric element is brittle and its output signal 
transmission cannot be wireless. On the other hand, a 
magnetostrictive force sensor has some outstanding merits in 
comparison with the other force sensors such as machinability 
[3]-[6], high coupling factor between elastic and magnetic 
states (about 0.7), heavy loads withstanding [7], adaptive with 
a harsh environment [8], low response time (about a few 
microseconds), zero-energy consumption [9] and is suitable 
for wireless applications [10]. It is required to mention that 
magnetostrictive materials suffer from some disadvantages 
such as Hysteresis behavior, Eddy current loss, and thermal 
instability. Talebian presented a good enough model for 
Hysteresis [11] and Eddy current loss [12].  Furthermore, 
Ghodsi et al. employed a thermoelectric cooler to remove heat 
generated by the excitation coil [13][14]. Magnetostrictive 
force sensors are based on the Villari effect [15]. Therefore, 
when subjected to a mechanical force, their magnetization 
varies and we can measure the variation of magnetic field 
density passing through the magnetostrictive bar. This 
variation can be proportional to the applied mechanical load. 
Calkins et al. and Stachowiak investigated the effects of pre-
stress on the dynamic performance of Terfenol-D 
transducers/actuators [16][17]. Many researchers developed 
various types of magnetostrictive force sensors. Zhu et al. 
proposed a model for a giant magnetostrictive force sensor 
and investigated the effect of frequency on the output voltage 
of the sensor [18].  A precise impact force sensor using 
Galfenol has been developed by Shu et al. They showed that 
the cantilever type is more sensitive than the rod type [19].   
Galfenol was employed to develop a high sensitivity and 
linearity tactile magnetostrictive force sensor in 2019 [20]. 
Despite high linearity, this cantilever force sensor is suitable 
for a low range of force detection less than 5 N.  
In this paper, after presenting the principle of the sensor in 
Section 2, a non-linear magneto-mechanical model for giant 
magnetostrictive force is combined with Faraday’s law to 
predict the generated voltage by a search coil.   Furthermore, 
the sensitive analysis of the sensor and the effects of 
parameters on the sensor’s performance will be discussed in 
Section 3.

PRINCIPLE AND MODELING OF FORCE SENSOR 
A. Principle of Operation 
The proposed force sensor consists of a core made of Giant 
Magnetostrictive Material (GMM) which is in the presence of 
a bias magnetic field, a search coil, and an excitation coil to 
generate a bias magnetic field (Figure 1). The bias magnetic 
field can be generated by permanent magnets or a coil 
energized by a variable DC power supply. Applied force 
changes the magnetic flux density pass through the Terfenol-
D. Based on Faraday's law, the variation of magnetic flux can 
be detected by the generated voltage across the resistive load 
connected to the ends of the search coil. The amplitude of the 
generated voltage (V2) is proportional to the amplitude of the 
applied force (Fm). The proportional relationship can be 
changed to an equal relationship by (1).        
𝑉2 = 𝑘 (𝐻0, 𝐹0) 𝐹𝑚                                   (1)  
k is the coefficient, which is dependent on the magnetic bias 
and pre-stress applied to the Terfenol-D.  The effect of 
magnetic bias and pre-stress will be examined in the next 
section. 
B. Non-linear Analytical Modeling 
This section aims to find a relationship between the 
amplitude of the applied force and the amplitude of the 
induced voltage. By applying axial harmonic force consists 
of bias force to the magnetostrictive bar, Terfenol-D, the 
sensitive part of the sensor is subjected to tensile and 
compressive normal stresses. By assuming the vibration as 
the axial harmonic force, the non-linear magneto-mechanical 
relation of Terfenol-D can be presented in (2) [21].

        (2) 
where 𝐵 is magnetic flux density, H is the magnetic field  , 
and  are strain and the applied stress, respectively. For 
Terfenol-D, the best value of  and Ms are -347 and 0.8, 
respectively [12][22].  The magnetic field consists of two 
components of (a) magnetic field bias, H0, (b) magnetic field 
caused by generated current, 𝐻.
̂  Using Ampere’s law, the 
magnetic field can be concluded as (3). 
𝐻 = 𝐻0 + 𝐻̂ = 𝐻0 + 𝑁𝑖2

                                  (3) 
where N is the number of turns of the search coil, i2 is induced 
current due to the applied force and l0 is the length of the 
Terfenol-D bar. Based on Faraday's law, the relationship 
between magnetic flux and generated voltage can be written 
as follow: 
𝜑 = 𝐵𝐴 = − 1
𝑁 ∫ 𝑣2𝑑𝑡                                       (4)  
By substituting (3) and (4) into (2) and considering F=A and 
v2=Ri2 the induced current can be derived by solving 
differential (5).

To solve this non-linear differential equation, we 
employed the Simulink of MATLAB (Appendix A). The 
parameters of the force sensor are shown in Table I. The 
sample of output voltage calculated by Simulink is shown in 
Figure 2 while the sensor is under harmonic force. Figure 3 
shows the simulated relationship between applied force and 
output voltage when the magnetostrictive force sensor is under 
various magnetic fields from 100 to 20 kA/m, and constant 
bias compressive force is about 1000 N.  It is obvious that the 
force sensor has a linear behavior in the range from 100 to 
1700 N. Furthermore, magnetic bias has a positive effect on 
the sensitivity of the sensor while its nonlinearity is magnified 
for force amplitude larger than 1700 N. The effect of bias force 
(pre-stress) is simulated in Figure 4.  It is found that higher 
pre-stress causes lower sensitivity. However, pre-stress is 
helpful to enhance the linearity of the sensor in a force range 
higher than 1700 N.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE FORCE SENSOR 
Referring to the (5), and the sample of the voltage output 
shown in Figures 2 to 4, the magnetic bias and pre-stress seem 
to be effective on the measured voltage across the search coil.  
To examine this assumption, the Design Of Experiments 
(DOE) was exploited [23][24].  The goal of this part is to 
determine the optimum operating conditions while the pre-
stress and bias magnetic fields are assumed adjustable. The 
variable factors in this force sensor are F0 and H0.  To 
maximize the output voltage, the Response Surface Method 
(RSM) is employed to find proper values for each factor to 
have optimum output voltage [25][26]. To specify a regression 
equation between the amplitude of output voltage and pre-
stress and magnetic bias, Minitab 17 software is used.  Table 
II shows two factors with five levels for each. Based on the 
design proposed by RSM and selection of= 1.44, it is found 
that nine simulation results including one center point are 
required (Table III). Table IV shows the Pvalue and the 
coefficients of each factor.  Since the Pvalue of H0× H0 is greater 
than 0.05, the effect of this term, H0×H0, is ignorable on the 
output voltage. However, F0, H0, and their interaction are 
effective, since their Pvalue is smaller than 0.05. R-Sq = 98.38% 
shows the goodness of the model represented by RSM.

and H0  
 
 
Figure 6.  Interaction between F0 and H0 
 
 
Figure 7.  RSM optimizer to predict the maximum output 
Based on the coefficients presented in Table IV, the output 
voltage can be modeled by (6): 
 
V2 (v) = 0.07411+0.05982 F0 + 0.04381 H0 + 0.02801 F0× F0 
+ 0.02575 F0× H0                                                           
                                                                                      (6) 
Therefore, among the factors and their interactions, F0 has the 
highest effect since its coefficient is the largest. Figures 5 and 
6 show the main effects and interactions between the main 
factors. One of the biggest advantages of RSM is determining 
the maximum output voltage. Figure 7 predicts that the 
maximum amplitude of output voltage (Vm) can be enhanced 
to 0.32 V, when both F0 and H0 are 1060 N and 8.6 kA/m, 
respectively.  This prediction is confirmed when these values 
are substituted in (5) and the amplitude of output voltage (Vm) 
reaches 0.4 V.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
A magnetostrictive force sensor was modeled using non-
linear magneto-mechanical coupling equations. The effect of 
the pre-stress and bias magnetic field was investigated on the 
sensitivity and nonlinearity of the force sensors. It was 
highlighted that the presented applied force has linear 
behavior for the applied force range from 100 to 1700 N.  
Response Surface Method (RSM) was employed to analyze 
the sensitivity of the sensor against the effective parameters. 
It was found that the pre-stress and bias magnetic fields and 
their interactions play a significant role in the sensitivity of the 
force sensor. Furthermore, it was manifested that the linearity 
can be enhanced by increasing the pre-stress. On the other 
hand, the sensitivity of the sensor will be sacrificed by 
increasing the pre-stress. Bias magnetic field plays the same 
role. The sensor’s sensitivity can be enhanced by increasing 
the bias magnetic field. Conversely, the sensor loses its 
linearity in a higher magnetic field. Consequently, there is a 
trade-off between sensor sensitivity and nonlinearity and both 
are adjustable by both, pre-stress and magnetic bias.
