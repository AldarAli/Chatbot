Abstract—Two oscillators are needed for passive wireless
sensor readers: a radiofrequency local oscillator generating the
carrier within the bandpass of the sensor, and a clock triggering
analog to digital conversion of the signals returned by the
sensor. We assess the inﬂuence on measurement resolution of
these two oscillators, hinting at some design rules of the sensor
based on the characteristics of the oscillators as driven by
cost, size, or power consumption. We demonstrate that local
oscillator phase noise is a signiﬁcant parameter in assessing the
resolution of passive acoustic sensor probed through a wireless
link, although with different characteristic conditions whether
the sensor is in a delay line conﬁguration (short term –far from
carrier – response) or a resonator (long term – close to carrier
– response).

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless passive sensors are either piezoelectric or dielec-
tric transducers coupling with an incoming electromagnetic
ﬁeld following conditions dependent on the physical prop-
erty under investigation. For instance, surface acoustic wave
(SAW) delay lines convert an incoming electromagnetic
pulse to a mechanical wave propagating on a piezoelectric
substrate. Mirrors patterned on this substrate reﬂect a frac-
tion of this wave back to the interdigitated transducer (IDT)
connected to the antenna: the direct piezoelectric effect
converts these acoustic pulses to electromagnetic signals
detected by the receiver. Hence, a passive acoustic delay
line reader operates following principles similar to RADAR,
with a delayed echo not associated with reﬂections of the
emitted signal over dielectric or conductive interfaces, but
with delays associated with a measurement. Thus, all the
well known RADAR techniques have been applied to passive
wireless sensing, whether dielectric [1], [2], [3] or based on
piezoelectric substrates [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]: wideband
pulsed RADAR [10], [11], FMCW RADAR [12], [13],
FSCW RADAR [14], [8], [9], and chirped RADAR [15],
[16].
Since it is well known that the local oscillator character-
istics drives the detection capability of RADARs as will be
discussed in the ﬁrst introductory section of this presentation
(Fig. 1), one might consider how local oscillator phase noise

affects passive wireless sensor resolution [17]. We extend in
the third section the discussion from the classical passive
target to the short-term – wideband – delay line acoustic
sensor conﬁguration in which the phase noise characteristics
far from the carrier deﬁnes the measurement resolution.
Since wideband acoustic delay lines are only compatible
with the allocated 2.45 GHz band, we consider in the fourth
section the same approach applied to narrowband resonators,
compliant with the narrowband 434 MHz radiofrequency
band, and the phase noise characteristics now shifted to the
region close to the carrier. Such considerations will bring us
in the ﬁfth section to consider a second oscillator usually
found on such circuits: the clock deﬁning the analog to
digital conversion rate. Thus, the reader is led throughout
this paper to consider the various regions of the phase noise
spectrum as a limiting factor for acoustic sensing resolution
depending on the transducer characteristic time constants.
II. PHASE NOISE INFLUENCE ON CW RADAR
This introductory section reminds the reader of basic
concepts related to phase noise of oscillators and their
effect on RADAR detection capability. We will focus on
the continuous wave (CW) RADAR where the explanation
is straight forward.
CW RADARs are used whenever a velocity information
is considered without ranging capability: a radiofrequency
(RF) wave is generated by an oscillator. This signal is on
the one hand fed to an antenna (after being ampliﬁed by a
power ampliﬁer, PA) and on the other hand a fraction of the
output of the oscillator is sent to one input of a mixer. The
second input of this mixer is fed with the signal detected by

either a second antenna in a bistatic conﬁguration, or at the
output of a circulator in a monostatic conﬁguration, after
ampliﬁcation by a low noise ampliﬁer (LNA). The output
of the mixer m is the product of the frequency generated at
time t by the oscillator but shifted by the Doppler frequency
due to target motion δf, and the oscillator frequency delayed
by a duration τ due to the electromagnetic wave propagation
in air to and from the target:
m = cos (2π (f(t) + δf)) × cos (2π (f(t + τ)))
∝ cos (2π (f(t) + δf ± f(t + τ)))
(1)
with only the difference term remaining after ﬁltering the
output by a low pass ﬁlter aimed at removing the signal
at frequencies above f. Let us consider the case of slowly
moving targets, where δf will be considered negligible; then
m ≃ cos (2π (f(t) − f(t + τ))). Ideally this term should
vanish when the target is not moving and assuming the
oscillator ideally stable, i.e., f(t) constant; the only beat
frequency would be associated to δf. However, oscillators
do exhibit phase noise, and thus f(t + τ) and f(t) differ:
the phase noise spectrum of an oscillator is deﬁned as
the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the
oscillator output frequency [18].
The classical CW RADAR detection limit concludes that
a moving target will only be detectable if its RADAR cross
section is large enough so that the returned power (echo)
is stronger than the power spectrum of the local oscillator:
the phase variation is expressed in dBc/Hz, or a power with
respect to the carrier power at an offset 1/τ from the carrier
frequency. As a concluding remark, long range RADAR is
interested in the behavior of the oscillator close to the carrier
(since τ = 2d/c with d the distance to the target and c the
velocity of an electromagnetic wave: d = 5 − 50 km yields
τ = 33 − 333 µs in vacuum and thus the behavior of the
oscillator at 3 to 33 kHz from the carrier is of interest). On
the other hand, RADAR aimed at detecting moving walking
people with targets in the sub-100 m range will only be
affected by the phase noise above 1.5 MHz from the carrier.
III. APPLICATION TO SAW REFLECTIVE DELAY LINE
SENSING
One implementation of SAW delay line readers acts
exactly as a CW reader: a carrier is chopped in pulses
containing as many periods as there are electrodes in the
sensor IDT (Fig. 2).
The reader on the one hand emits these pulses whose
frequency is centered on the oscillator frequency output,
and the returned signal from the sensor is centered on the
same frequency, but shifted in time by a duration dependent
on the physical property under investigation (which most
signiﬁcantly affects the acoustic wave velocity on the piezo-
electric substrate). Thus, the mixer output exhibits a series
of pulses whose rough delay is estimated through maximum
returned power (threshold) or cross-correlation; but it is well

The mixer might be replaced by an I/Q demodulator in practical systems.
Let us now add to the time delay from the acous-
tic wave propagation another contribution to the detected
phase: the local oscillator intrinsic noise as characterized
by its phase noise. The phase noise of a signal V (t) =
(V0 + ε(t)) sin (2πf0t + ∆ϕ(t))
is deﬁned as [21] the

Based on these informations, we will compute the phase
noise ﬂuctuations of the local oscillators during time inter-
vals τ which are now given by the travel duration of the
electromagnetic wave in the medium surrounding the sensor
(negligible since readout ranges are in the tens of meters at
most, or tens of nanoseconds) and the acoustic delay which
is typically in the 1 to 5 µs range: the offset to the carrier
of interest to acoustic sensing is in the 200 kHz to 1 MHz
range.
This frequency range usually lies above the Leeson
frequency fL = fLO/(2QLO) with fLO and QLO the

local oscillator resonator frequency and quality factor. This
characteristic frequency deﬁnes a frequency offset from the
carrier at which the resonator no longer acts as an energy
tank and becomes transparent to the feedback ampliﬁer
noise. Above this frequency, the phase noise of the oscillator
is constant and solely deﬁned by the power injected in the
resonator, the noise factor of the feedback ampliﬁer and
the operating temperature. We shall come back to such
considerations in the design section.
Two practical applications will focus on a poor oscillator
assumed to exhibit -130 dBc/Hz, and an excellent oscillator
assumed to exhibit -170 dBc/Hz as the frequency offset of
interest. Another numerical application using -90 dBc/Hz is
justiﬁed by the fact that the returned signal noise ﬂoor is the
maximum of either the initial oscillator noise ﬂoor raised by
the power ampliﬁer (PA) and low noise ampliﬁer (LNA), or
the LNA noise ﬂoor set by its thermal noise FLNAkBT/PR
with FLNA ≃ 1.5 dB the noise factor of the reception
ampliﬁer, 10 log10(kBT) = −174 dBm the product of
the Boltzmann constant with the temperature T = 290 K,
and PR the received power. From this consideration, the
measurement resolution will ﬁrst be constant as long as
the LNA noise ﬂoor is lower than the LO noise ﬂoor,
and drops once the returned power becomes so low that
the LNA noise ﬂoor rises above the LO noise ﬂoor. The
received power is related to the emitted power PE – limited
to PE = +10 dBm by radiofrequency emission regulations
in 434 and 2450 MHz ISM bands – through the free space
propagation losses and the sensor insertion losses. Free space

are associated with
energy distribution on a sphere generated by the emitter, and
in the case of a RADAR the link budget requires the use
of FSPL4 since the target itself acts as a point-like source
generating a spherical wave. The SAW sensor insertion loss
IL is a signiﬁcant source of energy loss when probing
SAW delay lines since a typical IL value is -35 dB. Thus,
PR = PE × FSPL4 × IL and switching to a logarithmic
description, the noise ﬂoor on the return branch reaching the
mixer is either the ﬂoor of the oscillator raised by the noise
ﬂoor of PA and LNA, or the noise ﬂoor of the LNA ampliﬁer
FLNA,dB +10 log10(kBT)−10 log10(PE ×FSPL4)−IL).
The lower the oscillator phase noise ﬂoor, the smaller the
range at which the LNA noise ﬂoor becomes dominant, as
shown in the numerical application of Table I.
In such cases, the phase variations due to the local
oscillator are ∆ϕRMS =

numerical application yields to phase ﬂuctuations from 0.2o
to 0.002o (for -130 and -170 dBc/Hz cases respectively).
We must now relate these phase ﬂuctuations with the
phase variations due to a physical quantity variation: we

piezoelectric substrate at velocity v and the time-difference

phase shift of

with the Hewlett Packard HP2830A resonator-based probes
is challenging.
Beyond the compliance with radiofrequency emission
regulations, the use of ultra-wideband (UWB) interroga-
tion strategies, e.g., Ground Penetrating RADAR based
approaches [22], yields the question of optimum operating
frequencies. Indeed, we have seen that the time delay is a
function of the acoustic velocity and propagation path length
(deﬁned respectively by selecting appropriate single-crystal
piezoelectric substrate orientations, and design considera-
tions in positioning the mirrors on the sensor surface), but
also of the operating frequency:
∆ϕ = 2πd/λ = 2πdf/v = 2πfτ
where τ is the propagation duration of the pulse, i.e., ∂∆ϕ =
2πf∂τ ⇔ ∂τ = 1/(2πf)∂∆ϕ, providing the relationship
between phase noise and delay noise through the inverse of
the frequency.
The remaning design issue lies in the selection of the echo
pair used for computing acoustic propagation time delay and
thus identifying the physical quantity under investigation.
The ﬁrst and last echos of a tag (start and stop bits) are
usually considered for such purposes. However, the further
away mirrors are, the longer the delay and thus the larger
the local oscillator ﬂuctuations, associated with phase noise
rise. One should thus take care that the inverse of the
propagation delay does not reach the Leeson frequency fL
where the noise ﬂoor meets the rising phase noise slope:
fL = f0/(2Q). Considering a (very favorable) Q = 20000
resonator used for generating a 2.45 GHz oscillator, fL =
60 kHz and the associated propagation delay is 16 µs,
far above any practical limitation (such a delay would be
associated with a 24 mm-long propagation path). However,
for a more reasonable Q = 2000 [23], the Leeson frequency
reaches 600 kHz or a propagation delay of 1.6 µs. In this
case, using echos returned by mirror at extreme positions of
the delay line should be avoided (i.e., exhibiting propagation
delays larger than 1.6 µs) and adjacent echos should yield
results with higher resolutions.
IV. SENSOR DESIGN WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL
OSCILLATOR CHARACTERISTICS
Consider two applications: a 434 MHz delay line (which
would not comply with RF regulations) and a 2450 MHz
delay line. Resonators in the former frequency range exhibit
typical quality factors of 10000, and fL = 22 kHz, well
below the 200-1000 kHz range we have been considering:
a classical delay line design will be probed at best by the
reader. However at 2450 MHz, since the product Q × f is
constant for a given technology, the local oscillator Q drops
to 1800, and the Leeson frequency rises to 680 kHz. The
designer of a 2450 MHz delay line would be wise to avoid
the phase noise rise below fL and limit the maximum time
delay on the acoustic path to 1.5 µs. Since electromagnetic
clutter fades within the ﬁrst 700 ns (assuming 100 m
range) and the typical pulse length is 40 ns spaced by
at least 100 ns to account for manufacturing variability,
limiting the delay to 1.5 µs still leaves enough space for
5 reﬂections, more than enough for multi-parameter-sensing
(one reference pulse and 4 pulses for probing 4 different
physical quantities, e.g., temperature [24], pressure [25] and
two chemical compounds [26].
V. APPLICATION TO SAW RESONATOR SENSING
SAW resonator probing aims at identifying a characteristic
frequency: in one embodiment of this approach, a frequency
sweep network analyzer sequentially probes multiple fre-
quencies in order to identify the frequency at which the
sensor returns a maximum power. SAW resonators store
energy during the electromagnetic signal emission phase,
and release this energy (as an electromagnetic wave at the
sensor resonance frequency f0) during the listening stage:
the time constant of each step is Q/(πf0) with Q the
sensor quality factor. The fastest approach to the best of
our knowledge [27] for probing a resonance frequency of a
resonator requires two signals at different frequencies, one
above and one below f0 (Fig. 5).

Figure 5.
For a dual-mode resonator, required for a differential measure-
ment, a minimum of 4 measurements each lasting 2Q/(πf) seconds, with
f the resonance frequency of one mode and Q its quality factor, is needed
(red). A more classical approach of a frequency sweep network analyzer
requires up to 128 measurements in the 434-MHz European ISM band
(blue).
Hence, the minimum measurement duration is 2Q/(πf0)
for each probed frequency. For f0 = 434 MHz and Q =
10000 in a dual resonator conﬁguration, eight time constants
(two resonators, and for earch two-measurement points, and
for each one time constant for loading and unloading the
resonator) yield 59 µs measurement duration, so that the
oscillator stability at 17 kHz from the carrier is of interest.

The result of this calculation is summarized in table III,
assuming that the Q × f product is constant, as is usually
considered for a given technology, with values representative
of SAW resonators patterned on a quartz substrate. The
temperature resolution – last column of Table III – is
computed assuming a 60 ppm/K sensitivity. This last result
scales as the temperature sensitivity of the substrate: a sensor
allowing for a 170 K measurement range within the 1.7 MHz
wide 434 MHz European ISM band – as sold by SENSeOR
(Mougins, France) – only exhibits a 5.7 ppm/K sensitivity
and hence the values in the last column are multiplied by
10.
Here again, for resonators acting as temperature sensors
with 2.5 kHz/K temperature sensitivity (in order to ﬁt
a 170 K measurement range within the 1.7 MHz wide
434 MHz Industrial, Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) band, ac-
counting for manufacturing variations), the 25 Hz frequency
resolution (10 mK resolution) is only met if a reasonably
stable local oscillator is used as reference, with a phase noise
below -105 dBc/Hz. This result is consistent with the phase
noise spectra provided in [28], with a phase noise around
-105 dBc/Hz in the 500-5000 Hz carrier offset range at the
434 MHz DDS output. The former range boundary is met
when probing 128-samples in a frequency-sweep network
analyzer approach: 128 points each requiring 2Q/(πf0)
requires a duration of 1.8 ms or an update rate of 530 Hz.
VI. ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERSION JITTER
We now change oscillator type to consider the analog
to digital conversion (ADC) stage. The phase measurement
requires two simultaneous measurements of the I and Q
components of the returned signal after mixing with the local
RF oscillator. The typical pulse duration is 30 ns so that the
ADC bandwidth must be at least in the fs = 60 MHz range,
or practically (3 points/period at least) 100 MHz.
Measuring a phase with 0.13 rad resolution over the full
2π range requires bits = 6 bit resolution. Since the jitter
on the clock controlling the ADC yields a resolution loss
(linear scale) of SNR = (2πfsσt), the jitter σt must not
exceed
σt ≤ 2−bits/(2π × fs)
which is here equal to 42 ps [29]. However, increasing 10-
fold this resolution yields a 9 bit ADC resolution and a
maximum jitter of 5 ps.
On the other hand, let us estimate the jitter induced by an
oscillator exhibiting a -130 dBc/Hz phase noise level in the
200 kHz-200 MHz range, representative of the inﬂuence of
the clock controlling the ADC sampling at 100 MS/s for a
maximum duration of 5 µs. The RMS jitter (in seconds) is
given [30] by
σt =
√
2 × 10−130/10 × 108
(2π × 108)
which is equal to 7 ps, dropping the lower integration limit
(200 kHz) by assuming that the constant phase noise level
extends to the carrier. Thus, although even a very poor refer-
ence oscillator controlling the ADC meets the requirements
of 9-bit resolution needed for high resolution temperature
measurements, care should nevertheless be taken to reach
sub-10 ps jitter. As an example, the Digital PLL gener-
ating the clock output of an iMX27 CPU as used on the
APF27-board from Armadeus Systems (Mulhouse, France)
for prototyping our experiments is speciﬁed at a maximum
of 200 ps, hardly usable for the application described here
[31].
VII. CONCLUSION
While the debate on the advantages between delay line
and resonator approaches is still ongoing, local oscillator
characteristics brings some hint on which strategy might
bring the most accurate result. From a local oscillator
perspective, moving the frequency offset as far as possible
from the carrier, i.e., allowing for as short a duration
between various measurements of the sensor characteristics
as possible, clearly hints at an advantage towards delay
lines. However, this partial picture does not include the
receiver noise level, especially the high bandwidth on the
ADC sampling required to recover and digitize the fast delay
line response: only an extremely stable (low jitter) clocking
circuit for the receiver ADC will provide measurements with
resolutions comparable to those of resonators. Furthermore,
as opposed to FMCW or frequency sweep approaches which
require tunable frequency sources (VCO, frac-PLL, DDS),
a pulsed (UWB-like) delay line approach only requires a
ﬁxed frequency source generating a stable signal within
the bandpass of the sensor, hence allowing for improved
stability. Such results are most signiﬁcantly the target of
high quality factor piezoelectric resonator based oscillators
aimed at reaching the targetted radiofrequency band.

Design rules concerning the oscillator characteristics are
provided for delay lines: the maximum two-way trip duration
should be lower than the inverse of the Leeson frequency,
while only low noise ﬂoor enables high resolution mea-
surements as explicitly stated with relationships between
local oscillator phase noise densities and measured returned
signal phase resolution. For resonator probed through a
frequency sweep network analyzer approach, the tunable
local oscillator source is clearly a limiting factor in the
measured resonance frequency resolution.
