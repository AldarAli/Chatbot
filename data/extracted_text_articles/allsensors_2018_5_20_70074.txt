Abstract—There is a need for a multi-functional probe for small-
scale measurements of different soil properties measured within
identical soil volumes. Dual Probe Heat Pulse (DPHP) sensors are
an economical solution for this since they measure simultaneously
temperature, volumetric water content, and soil thermal proper-
ties: diffusivity and volumetric heat capacity. However, all DPHP
sensors to date have very complex manufacturing processes. This
paper aims to design and build a DPHP sensor based only on a
Printed Circuit Board (PCB) board, which comprises the probes
and all supporting electronics leading to a low cost and simple
manufacturing process. The proposed system includes signal-
processing circuits, a microcontroller, and communicates by a
Serial Digital Interface at 1200 baud protocol (SDI-12). Probe
spacing calibration results showed a reasonably good agreement
between measured and ﬁtted data. In conclusion, results also show
that it is possible to build the multi-functional DPHP sensor in a
low cost process, and this was the ﬁrst time that a multi-functional
probe was build using a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) as support.

probe; heat-pulse sensor; thermal conductivity; thermal sensors.

INTRODUCTION
The heat pulse-based soil moisture sensors, of which stand
out Dual Probe Heat Pulse (DPHP) sensors, are an economical
solution for soil moisture measurements. Since Campbell [1],
much research has been done and reported that the heat pulse
technique is an economical technique to measure soil thermal
properties and soil moisture content [1]–[19]. The DPHP-based
sensor has two elements, the heat probe and the temperature
sensor probe, separated by a short distance, r. A voltage pulse,
with ﬁnite duration t0, is applied to the heater element causing
the heat to ﬂow in all directions around the heater element.
Heat ‘traverses’ the surrounding soil and the temperature rise
will be measured by a sensor on the temperature probe.
However, in almost all developed sensors [1]–[14], the heating
probe is composed of a needle where a conductive wire (with a
high resistivity, suitable for producing resistances for heating)
is inserted inside. The probe with the temperature sensor
is elaborated in the same way, by inserting the temperature
sensor (thermocouple or thermistor) inside a needle. Both
needles are then ﬁlled with an epoxy glue of high thermal
conductivity and low electrical conductivity. Therefore, the use
of this process is laborious and difﬁcult, if not impossible, for
industrialization. Other authors have attempted, without known
success, to develop soil moisture sensors based on the heat
pulse without the use of needles. In this group, there are the
works of [15]–[17], [19] who developed microelectronics to
try to improve the manufacturing process and in other works
a button-shaped sensor was developed [14], [18]. Most of the
work done with DPHP sensors uses data-loggers to acquire
data from temperature probe, to control heat pulse duration
and to perform calculations. A recent work [12] overcomes
this problem but still uses needle type probes. In this paper,
we resolve these shortcomings. In particular, we make the
following contributions:
•
Place all the electronics near the probes (heating and
temperature probes). This contribution (Section III),
although already achieved by [12], uses only a tem-
perature probe, making the construction of the sensor
simpler at the expense of measuring the ﬂow of water
in the soil.
•
We present a new form of sensor construction which
uses the PCB, also used for the rest of electronics,
as a support for the temperature and heating probes
(Section III). This is a great achievement as it will
enable the industrial production of the sensor at a
reduced cost.
•
All calculations of the model used (Section II) are
performed inside of the on-board microcontroller. The
results of the calibration using agar (Section IV)
showed good results of the model used.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the models implemented for the calculation of the

soil thermal properties and volumetric water content. Sec-
tion III details all the fabrication process of the DPHP sen-
sor, calibration method of the distance between heater and
temperature sensor, and SDI-12 communication commands
implemented. Section IV addresses the sensor calibration re-
sults and shows sensor prototypes. The acknowledgement and
conclusions close the article.

THEORY
There are some models to describe the operation of sensors
based on the DPHP method. The simpler model, described
by Campbell [1], considers that the heat source is an inﬁnite
line and the heat pulse is released instantaneously. The other
models [2] increase the constraints of the model of Campbell,
considering that the heat pulse is ﬁnite, that the source line
is ﬁnite and, ﬁnally, that it is not a source line, but a
cylinder. Of these models the most common is the model
which considers the ﬁnite heat pulse generated by an inﬁnite
source line [2]. In the present work, this will be the adopted
model due to its precision and relative ease implementation in
a microcontroller-based system. The solution for conducting
radial heat from a short-duration, t0 , heat pulse away from an
inﬁnite source line, for t > t0 is
∆T(r, T) =

where, ∆T is change in temperature (◦C), r is radial distance
from the line source (m), t is time (s), q′ is the energy input
per unit length of heater per unit time (W m−1), ρc is the volu-
metric heat capacity (J m−3 ◦C−1), κ is the thermal diffusivity
(m2 s−1) of the medium surrounding the heater, and −Ei(−x)
is the exponential integral [20]. The thermal diffusivity (κ) and
volumetric heat capacity (ρc) can be determined from heat-
pulse measurements using the single-point method [3], or a
nonlinear curve ﬁtting where (1) is ﬁtted to measured ∆T(r, t)
data [5]. It was showed that, accuracy in ρc will be limited by
the accuracy of r, and accuracy in κ will be limited by the
accuracy of both r and time of maximum temperature change,
tM [3]. The single-point method makes use of the fact that
the temperature response at some distance r from the heater
displays a maximum, so that we can take the derivative of (1)
with respect to time, set the result equal to zero, and obtain the
time, tM, to the maximum temperature change (∆TM). This
yields an expression for estimating κ where

tM and t0. For ρc estimation, in addition to κ from (2) and r,
are needed accurate measurements of q′ and ∆TM. Volumetric
heat capacity ρc of soil can be determined as the sum of the
heat capacities of the individual constituents and considering
that the air is ignored and solids deﬁned to include the mineral
and organic matter fractions then soil water content θv can be
deﬁned as a function of volumetric heat capacity [21],
θv = ρc − ρbcs

where ρ is density, c speciﬁc heat, θv volumetric water content,
and the subscripts b, s and w indicates bulk, average properties
of the solids (minerals+organic matter), and water, respectively.
Since (ρc)w is known, measurements of ρc obtained with
the sensor can be used together with estimates (or preferably
measurements) of soil bulk density (ρb) and speciﬁc heat (ρs)
to obtain θv.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The developed sensor is a complete solution and this
approach, together with the non-use of needles for the heating
and temperature probes, is new. Next, all details of the sensor
construction, as well as its ﬁrmware, the communication pro-
tocol and as referred to in the previous section the knowledge
of the true value of r (reﬀ) through calibration in agar, will be
explained in detail.
A. Sensor System Description
In Figure1 is depicted the electronic layout of the sen-
sor system, the core unit is on-board 16 bit microcontroller
(PIC24F32KA301) with very low power consumption, 12-
channel 12 bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), serial
communications modules (UART - Universal Asynchronous
Receiver-Transmitter, SPI - Serial Peripheral Interface, and
I2C - Inter-Integrated Circuit), and hardware Real-Time Clock
(RTC) Calendar with alarms. The temperature sensor probe
consists of a 10 kΩ (NCP15XH103F03RC) thermistor, a pre-
cision (0.1 %) voltage reference of 2.048 V (LM4128) and
a 24 bit ADC (MCP3421). The heating probe consists of a
series of 15 resistors of 1 Ω, controlled by an electronic switch
composed of transistors. The system power is from the SDI-12
power (6 V to 12 V) that feeds a dual DC regulator: 2 V to 5 V
for powering the heat pulse (LM1117), and 3.3 V for the rest
of the system (MIC5219).
The microcontroller controls the heat pulse through the
transistors switch to enable/disable the power to the heater.
To determine accurately the value of q′ (heat input per unit

length per unit time), average current through the heater was
determined by sampling the voltage across a 0.18 Ω resistor
(1 %) in series with the heater 15 Ω resistor (15 × 1 Ω), and
the voltage across resistance series of the heater and current
measure resistor. The value q′ is determined by
q′ = Vheater × Iheater ×
1
lheater
(5)
where Vheater is the measured voltage across the heater,
Iheater is the current through the heater given by Iheater =
VR=0.18/0.18 Ω (VR=0.18 is the measured voltage across
the 0.18 Ω resistor), and lheater is the length of the heater
(0.0353 m). All voltages measured for q′ calculations, are per-
formed by microcontroller internal ADC (12 bit). Temperature
from the temperature probe was measured by sampling the
voltage drop across the thermistor in series with a 10 kΩ
(0.1 %) resistor. This was done on the 24 bit ADC to ensure
sufﬁcient sampling accuracy for determining temperature.
B. Sensor Construction
The prototype of the developed sensor, as shown in Fig-
ure 2, is based on the printed circuit board (PCB) as substrate.
In the PCB are welded all the components necessary for
the operation of the sensor. The design of the PCB was
made in the form of a fork with two ‘rods’ that form the
heating probe and the temperature probe. The thermistor in
the temperature probe is placed in a thermally insulated tab.
The distance between these two elements were designed to
be 6 × 10−3 m. However, this distance has to be calibrated
because as previously described an error in this parameter
contributed signiﬁcantly to the error in the determination of
κ and ρc [4].
The process of mounting the sensor is as follows:
•
Manufacture of PCB board;
•
Assembly of all electric components, except for the
ﬁrst resistance of the heating element due to the mold;

•
Sealing, using a mold as depicted on Figure 2, with
thermoplastic molding resin to achieve high quality
sealing and protection of components of the main
circuit. Overtec 820 15 Hotmelt Glue Gun, from
Techsil Limited, UK, was used with the respective
polyamide resin OverTec 5 FR;
•
Missing resistor placement;
•
Placement of an epoxy adhesive in the heating element
(in all resistors forming it) and in the thermistor.
As can be seen from the description of the process used
for the elaboration of the prototype, it can be turned into an
industrial process.
C. Firmware
The developed ﬁrmware, after all the initialization, enters
into sleep mode waiting for a SDI-12 command. After a aM!
command the ﬁrmware will perform a complete measurement
as presented on Figure III-C.
The presented values for the heater voltage (5 V), the
heating duration (8 s) and the time allowed for the next
measurement are the defaults. These values can be change as
described next.
D. Digital Communications
The sensor uses SDI-12 protocol for digital communication
of sensor data and change sensor parameters. SDI-12 is a
standard to interface battery powered data recorders with
micro-processor based sensors designed for environmental data
acquisition. All SDI-12 communications are transmitted using
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
at 1200 baud with 7 data bits and an even parity bit. The
standard also speciﬁes a communications protocol that allows
sensors to remain in a low-power sleep state until awoken by
a serial break signal sent by the master. The ﬁrst character of
each command is a unique sensor address, a, that speciﬁes with
which sensor the recorder wants to communicate. Table I lists

all the commands that the sensor will respond to. In addition
to the standard commands it was necessary to implement a
set of extended commands (with an X after the address) in
order to conﬁgure the sensor and obtain individual readings
of some parameters. These extended commands uses letter G
after the X to get extra data from the sensor (heater voltage,
heating power, heater current, spacing between heater and
temperature sensor, maximum temperature rise, time of the
maximum temperature rise, soil bulk density, and individual
sensor parameters readings: soil volumetric water content,
soil thermal diffusivity, and volumetric heat capacity), and a
letter S to set new values for heater applied voltage and heat
duration, to new spacing value, and to set new bulk density.
Access to metadata is also available as presented in version
1.4 of the SDI-12 speciﬁcation [22]. For calibration and
whenever necessary, the raw values (16 bit unsigned ﬂoating
point format) of the temperature curve can be requested using
the High Volume Binary Command (aHB!).
E. Probe Distance Calibration
The measurement of κ and ρc are highly sensitive to
effective separation distances, r, between the heater element
on heater probe and the thermistor on temperature sensor
probe [4]. Thus, calibration of this distance was crucial for ac-
curate measurements. The calibration was performed by insert-
ing the sensor in a gel that was made from a 4 × 10−3 kg L−1
agar solution, Figure 5. The agar has equal thermal properties
as water, yet does not create heat convection as would occur
by heating liquid water [1].
The measured temperature response in agar solution was
used to calibrate the sensor separation distance for each ther-
mistor by ﬁtting the measured temperature change to (1) using
known values of volumetric heat capacity (4174 kJ m−3 K)
and thermal diffusivity (1.436 × 107 m2 s−1) of water.
IV.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Since this work is only about a description of the design
and the construction of the sensor, only the results about the
sensor assembly and the calibration of the distance between
the probes will be discussed.
A. Assembled Sensor
Figure 6 shows the assembled sensor without the thermo-
plastic molding resin and the ﬁnal version of the sensor. The
sensor is small in size, compact, robust and easy to use. The
ﬁnal product is comparable to commercial versions of other
soil moisture sensors using other measuring methods, such as
the EC-5, 5TE and 5TM probes from Decagon Devices Inc.,
USA.
This type of sensor (DPHP sensor) compares with capac-
itive type of sensor in terms of accuracy (±3 % [23]), and is
very different from very low-cost resistive sensor. Resistive
sensors give only qualitative estimation of the moisture con-
tent [23].
B. Probe Distance Calibration
The probe distance calibration was determined by obtaining
ﬁve sensor readings in agar solution with an interval of 1 h be-
tween readings and with heating power of q′ = 51.65 W m−1.
Figure 7 presents the measured temperature response as a
function of measurement time of one of these readings.
The measured temperature data was ﬁtted using the non-
linear least-squares Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. There is
a good agreement between measured and ﬁtted data. The
ﬁtted values of effective separation distance, reﬀ, for all 5
readings are presented in Table II. The average value of reﬀ is
5.534 × 10−3 m. The differences between the designed PCB
layout value (6 × 10−3 m) and effective distances are likely
caused by unprecise placement of the components (heater

dustrial process this error could be minimized and lead to two
kinds of sensors: agar calibrated and uncalibrated lowering the
costs.
It can also be observed in the Figure 7 that, compared to
other works [3], [9], [24], just to mention a few, that uses
datalogger for reading and control of the DPHP sensor, this
prototype presents a better resolution (18 bit against 13 bit
of must dataloggers) and a better sampling rate (1 sample/s
against 3 samples/s). This will give a better precision on
calculating ∆TM and tM. We can also observe a good signal
to noise ratio (∆TM = 0.3728 ◦C for a value of 100 % of
θv, agar ⇒ water) even for a lower heat power (51.65 W m−1
against 60 W m−1 - minimum found in literature [3]). This
low power (could be less and adjusted depending on θv values
- lower values less power) is very important in order to use
the sensor in wireless systems (Internet of Things - IoT).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presents a novel design and an industrial process
to build a DPHP sensor based on PCB board as substrate. The
process is based on four steps and a calibration process in
agar. Results also show that it is possible to build the multi-
functional DPHP sensor in a low cost industrial process (PCB
and assembly). This was the ﬁrst time that a soil moisture
sensor, based on heat-pulse method, was build using a PCB
as support. Further work must be done to ﬁnd out the sensor
accuracy, test sensor readings variations with soil type, and
perform in-ﬁeld and long-term stability tests.

be placed to measure soil moisture using the capacitive method
and to measure soil Electrical Conductivity (EC).
