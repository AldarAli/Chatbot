Abstract— The environment plays a crucial role in the 
development of obesity. Obesity rates continue to escalate, 
bringing into question the efficacy of prevention, intervention, 
and treatment efforts. This paper identifies the previous 
research examining obesogenic environmental factors and sets 
out to determine whether physical, social, cultural, and 
economic environmental factors are associated with obesogenic 
dietary behaviors. The study searched five databases for full-
text English articles, of which 103 were included in the 
literature review. The selection was based on keywords 
searching, 
peer-reviewed 
publications, 
stated 
research 
methodology, strategic analysis, and substantial increments in 
knowledge. One of the results showed an increasing pace of 
urbanization, media influence, and advertising emphasis on 
unhealthy food are associated with obesogenic dietary 
behavior. The discussion focuses on the most susceptible 
factors for obesity and the implications for future research in 
communities with a dense population. The objective of 
addressing the obesity epidemic is to employ strategies to 
curtail sugar use, restrict marketing efforts of unhealthy food, 
and increase the availability of healthy food.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Research has shown increasing attention on how the 
environment affects population health [1] [2]. Considerable 
studies have evidenced that population obesity was a product 
of the environment 30 years ago, and environmental changes 
are associated with epidemic obesity rates in all age groups 
[3] [4]. The influence of environmental stimuli on obesity 
prevalence must be affected to some extent by people’s 
dietary and physical activity behavior, which ultimately leads 
to an imbalance in energy intake and thus to obesity [5] [6].   
The 
obesogenic 
environment 
is 
defined 
as 
an 
environment that influences or promotes obesity in 
individuals 
or 
populations, 
which 
constitutes 
all 
surroundings, opportunities, or life conditions that lead to 
obesity [7]. The problem of the dramatic increase in obesity 
is 
complex, 
and 
may 
involve 
factors 
related 
to 
socioeconomic status, personal preferences, family habits, 
physical factors, and perhaps genetics. The theoretical 
framework from the consumer socialization perspective 
suggests that factors influencing food choice operate at four 
distinct levels: individual (psychological, biological, and 
behavioral factors), interpersonal (family, friends, and peer 
networks), community (accessibility, school policy, and local 
facilities), and societal (mass media, advertising, social and 
cultural norms, production and distribution systems, and 
pricing policies) [9] [30] [39].  
Prior reviews of the obesogenic environment literature 
indicated that modern sedentary activities promote the 
overconsumption of food, thus causing weight gain [11] 
[22]. However, empirical study remains lacking in terms of 
an appropriately designed research investigating associations 
of environmental factors with individuals’ attitudes, genetics, 
and societal development. Insight probably can be gained by 
improving theory and methods of research [8] [29]. This 
study focuses on the measurement and evaluation of the 
obesogenic environment. Obesogenic food environments are 
considered to facilitate high energy intake by increasing 
access to stores that promote unhealthy food choices. In 
Section 2, three research questions are discussed and 
systematic review method is adopted to identify the previous 
research in the literature in relation to obesity and the food 
environment.  
II. 
QUESTIONS AND METHODS  
RQ.1 What is the previous research focus on the 
measurement and evaluation of the obesogenic environment? 
RQ2. What risk factors, such as the physical, social, 
cultural, and economic environment, are associated with 
obesogenic dietary behaviors?  
RQ3. How to use obesity prevention and intervention to 
decrease obesity?  
Systematic review is a method often used to investigate a 
broad set of literature related to environments linked to 
obesity study [20] [21] [24]. The coding category was 
adopted from previous studies and included the publication 
year, author(s), affiliated organization, country, study design, 
main environmental determinants, scale of the geographical 
study, postulated relationship of specific risk factors (i.e., 
physical, social, cultural, and economic environment; 
individual, interpersonal, population, and global level), and 
analysis between the environment and weight status [22] 
[32]. The inclusion criteria and procedure are discussed in 
the followings section.

Inclusion criteria 
A comprehensive scholarly and multi-disciplinary full 
text databases including Academic Search Complete [51], 
Health Reference Center [52], Medline [6] [24], Springer 
Link[53], and Proquest Medical Library [22] [32] were 
searched for studies published from 2004 onward in full-text 
English articles. This study included only peer-reviewed 
articles that present advances in assessment methods, 
analytical result, up-to-date research studies or substantial 
increments 
in 
knowledge 
examining 
obesogenic 
environmental factors and evidence. A systematic study was 
recommended to assess at least one environmental factor. 
The search terms such as “diet study” and either 
“obesogenic,” “intervention,” “prevention,” “obesity,” “food 
marketing,” “food advertising,” or “mass communication 
campaign” were included. The researchers screened 3,139 
de-duplicated records, of which 103 met the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Inter-rater percentage agreement between 
reviewers and Cohen’s kappa coefficients were calculated: 
Academic Search Complete, 90% and 0.213; Health 
Reference Center, 92% and 0.392; Medline, 95% and 0.421; 
Springer Link, 89% and 0.316; and Proquest Medical 
Library, 91% and 0.396, respectively. All disagreement in 
coding was discussed and consensus was reached by the 
coders and authors. In Section 3, the research findings are 
reported by answering the three research questions.  
III. 
RESEARCH FINDINGS  
A total of 99 journal articles and 4 book chapters were 
included in this study. The distribution of the publication 
year for the obesogenic environmental studies has been 
increased steady. Two articles were  published in the year of 
2004 and 20 publications were found in 2014. The 
publication of obesogenic environmental studies has 
increased and the prolific years were 2014 (n = 20, 19%), 
followed by the years of 2010 (n = 14, 14%), 2013 (n = 12, 
12%), and 2006 (n = 12, 12%). 
Examining 
the 
authors’ 
nationality 
of 
affiliated 
organization indicates the diversity of journal contributors. 
Authors’ affiliated organization from European countries 
were the main source of evidence (n = 58, 52%), followed by 
America (n = 33, 29%), Oceania (n = 10, 9%), and Asia (n =   
8, 7%). Specifically, the nationalities of the authors’ 
affiliated organization were mostly American (n = 29, 26%), 
followed by British (n = 20, 18%) and Finnish, Norwegian, 
Swedish, and Australian with the same number of papers 
published (n = 8, 6%).  
Table 1 illustrates the research methods used for the 
previous 
research 
published 
related 
to 
obesogenic 
environment determinants of diet. The most frequently used 
survey method was experiment (n = 36, 35%), followed by 
questionnaire (n = 19, 18%), review (systematic and scoping, 
n = 19, 19%), and mixed qualitative and quantitative method 
(n = 12, 12%). The previous 19 review studies only recruited 
publications with human as the subject of research. 
However, in this study, the result found 15 studies adopted 
mice or white swine for experiment to examine and improve 
the potential interactive effects of diet, exercise, and genetic 
background. These studies suggest that physiological 
reactions may not merely increase in response to obesity but 
may also have a direct causal role in obesity and biological 
resistance. Another four research methods such as content 
analysis, interview, observation, and focus group were used 
with a relatively low percentage in obesogenic environment 
study. We also discovered that a large proportion of articles 
omitted crucial information on their methodology (n = 13, 
13%), population description (n = 14, 14%), and sample size 
(n = 31, 30%).

Table 2 presents a summary of 14 selected studies with 
advances in assessment methods that specifies risk factors, 
such as physical, social, cultural, and economic environment, 
associated with obesogenic dietary behaviors. The most 
susceptible factors for obesity according to obesogenic 
studies confirm the importance of the societal development 
of urbanization, media influence, and marketing activities (n 
= 11, 38%), followed by specific cultural food diet (n = 9, 
31%), physical activity and habit (n = 7, 24%), and product-
related factors (n = 2, 7%). The effects of eating habits and 
preferences have been investigated at several levels with 
substantial increments in knowledge by five studies listed in 
Table 2 [13] [15] [17] [18] [44]. 
Table 3 summarizes the solutions to increasing obesity 
proposed by eight studies. The method of diet intervention 
and policy restriction for television advertising is shown. 
Intervention (n = 6, 75%) and prevention (n = 2, 25%) efforts 
such as diet and physical activity are indicated while 
regulation of food industry and treatment of obese population 
lacks equal research attention. In Section 4, the discussion 
was extracted from the included studies emphasizing the 
food environment, marketing efforts, and prevention and 
intervention efforts from communication and marketing 
perspectives regarding an unhealthy food environment.

Associations between the environment and

seen between the environment and dietary

overweight/obesity, however the dietary 
mechanisms that contribute to this remain 
unclear and the physical activity 
environment may also play an important 
role in weight gain and obesity.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
With an estimated 2.1 billion people overweight globally, 
tackling obesity is one of the most serious challenges, 
requiring a societal and systems change in our approach to 
food, lifestyle, and the environments [41]. 
 
A. Food Environments  
British researchers concluded that food retail access in 
urban areas does not have a profound or prolonged effect on 
dietary patterns [19]. However, for the Chinese community, 
vending machines, mini grocery shops, convenience stores, 
and supermarkets were all found to sell large quantities of 
sweetened beverages, snacks, or high-calorie, high-fat, and 
low-nutrient food [28] [38]. This food supply led to the 
association of unhealthy food products and obesity. The 
patterns of food product types lacked the elements of 
delivering essential food groups and correct dietary 
information [34]. The literature tends to indicate that 
consumers in all age groups are likely offered and 
encouraged to choose a diet with super-saturated fat and 
excessive salt. In addition, the research showed the 
importance of urban–rural differences and the contribution of 
fast food and soft drinks in children’s diets [12] [18]. 
Although snacks and drinks remained relatively insignificant 
in the total diet of most people, the researchers emphasized 
that the globalization of the fast food and other local or 
modern food sectors is affecting our eating patterns and 
exposes us to the threat of nutrition transition towards 
higher-fat diets in all regions of the world [34] [38].  
 
B. Marketing Efforts toward Obesity 
Several studies examined the array of food products 
available on television and concluded that fast food 
restaurants, sweetened soft drinks, and sweetened cereals 
consistently dominate television food advertising. The 
identified patterns of food product types are commonly 
associated with unhealthy diets [42] [43]. For example, the 
exposure of sampled youth to 100 TV ads for sugar-
sweetened soft drinks was associated with a 9.4% increase in 
their consumption of soft drinks [10]. Thus, advertising has 
been accused to be a catalyst in problems of obesity for some 
age groups and in some countries [15] [23] [37]. For 
marketing efforts related to obesity research, sufficient 
studies have shown an association between promotional 
activity and children’s food knowledge, preferences, and 
their choices of daily snacks at playtime [13] [16] [25] [26] 
[33] [36] [40]. These studies have supported the notion that 
children’s age is a critical factor in the influence of 
advertising, especially in regard to nutrient imbalance diets. 
  
C. Preventions and Interventions in Increasing Obesity 
The intake of fruit, 100% juice, and vegetable and regular 
physical activity are advised to be healthy behaviors related 
to obesity prevention at the individual level [31]. The 
emphasis of parental control may be another possible 
solution. The portrayal of family togetherness and parents’ 
role is effective for promoting a healthy eating environment, 
and also helps in regulating children from over-engaging in 
sedentary activities. For example, a survey [28] indicated 
that Chinese parental influence, especially the father’s role 
modelling, is significantly related to attraction toward 
physical activity in overweight children. For boys, both the 
father’s and mother’s influence is strong. Parenting style 
such as role modelling and encouragement can positively 
influence 
an 
overweight 
child’s 
physical 
activity 
involvement.  
Furthermore, modifying the larger context and the 
microenvironment associated with health education for 
knowledge of nutrient dense diets is crucial. It is argued that 
school environments should provide access to healthy food 
and help reduce exposure to cues that encourage overeating 
or underactivity [15] [33]. At the community level, the 
solution to increasing obesity by employing interactive and 
mass media campaigns to change health behavior for health 
promotion is proven to be effective [24]. The goals of public 
awareness campaigns are to increase the awareness of the 
obesogenic environment, improve access to a healthy diet, 
and tackle obesity problems. In Section 5, the limitation and 
suggestions for future research are included in the 
conclusion.   
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This review provides a systematic and objective process 
for collecting knowledge applied to diet-related behavior in 
an obesogenic environment. The reviews of 203 previous 
studies showed that few investigations of environmental 
associations have been replicated, and that most studies used 
weak research designs and non-validated self-report 
measures. 
Medical studies have found that certain people have an 
increased risk for obesity, for example, minority ethnic 
children [45], 16-year-old girls with stress-related eating [5], 
truck drivers with insufficient sleep and older than 40 years 
[46], adults at least 22 years old with abnormal blood 
pressure [47], women (60–80 years old) or men (55–80 years 
old) at high cardiovascular risk but without previously 
documented history of cardiovascular disease [48], and 
infants associated with maternal obesity [49].  
The present paper contributes to elucidating the role of 
obesogenic environmental factors by proposing a possible 
pathway linking obesogenic environmental determinants of 
diet and obesity prevention and treatment. Potential relevant 
factors such as political policy and regulation [50] and 
mental status to diet [44] have also been evaluated because 
of the complexity of the task. The objective of addressing the 
obesity epidemic was to employ strategies to curtail sugar 
use, restrict marketing efforts, and increase the availability of 
healthy food.  
As the number of published obesogenic research grows, 
we hope to see direct effects on health and wellbeing and

indirect benefits from increased support from related 
research. There are no large pediatric randomized trials and 
very few published papers in treatment of obesity. One of the 
limitations in this study was the publication bias in the 
sampled database. There was substantial heterogeneity 
among studies with respect to study samples, interventions, 
and outcomes. There is a need to develop refined tools and 
indicators to monitor environmental changes on the basis of 
the amount of data available in the scientific literature and 
the potential for intervention.   
There is an improvement in the following area. First, the 
research focus on the measurement and evaluation of the 
obesogenic environment has been led by Western countries. 
Further study in the rest of the world with highly dense 
populations should be conducted for comparison in the 
global obesogenic environment.  
Second, 
the 
solutions 
for 
ensuring 
individuals’ 
responsibility in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight 
from early life throughout their school years and into 
adulthood remain unclear. The relatively weak empirical 
evidence implies the absence of causal relationships between 
environmental factors and individuals’ diet. A longitudinal 
approach would provide more robust evidence concerning 
the links among media use, diet behavior, and obesity 
prevention and treatment.  
Third, a lack of appropriate research design exists in the 
previous studies, which may have reduced the validity of the 
results. Abundant previous review studies have used indirect 
methods to assess the environment and excluded nonhuman 
subjects from their analyses [20]. Future studies should adopt 
a rigorous methodological design to assist in providing 
strong evidence for the complex association of obesogenic 
environmental determinants of diet.  
To determine the casual relations between food intake 
and the obesogenic environment, the influence of interactive, 
social, mass, or community-based media should be 
examined. 
Raising 
public 
awareness 
of 
obesogenic 
environmental determinants of unhealthy diet is a costly and 
complex endeavor. As public awareness campaigns become 
increasingly sophisticated, additional studies would help to 
evaluate the success of campaigns, tracking changes in 
attitudes and behaviors of people with obesity.
