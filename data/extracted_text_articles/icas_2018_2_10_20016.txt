Abstract—Flat-panel 
displays 
have 
become 
increasingly 
important in recent years for use in handheld devices and 
video monitors. In this paper, we have considered the problem 
of detecting micro defects including pinholes, particles and 
scratches in patterned Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal 
Display (TFT-LCD) surfaces.  The proposed method is based 
on a global image reconstruction scheme using the Fourier 
transform.  A typical TFT-LCD panel consists of orthogonal 
gate lines and data lines with TFTs in each intersection of the 
lines, which result in a structural texture with repetitive 
patterns.  By eliminating the frequency components associated 
with the structural pattern of data lines, gate lines and TFTs, 
and back-transforming the Fourier domain image, the 
reconstructed image can effectively remove the background 
pattern and distinctly preserve anomalies.  A simple adaptive 
thresholding is then used to segment the defective regions from 
the uniform background in the filtered image.  Experimental 
results have shown that the proposed method can successively 
detect and locate various ill-defined defects in a TFT-LCD 
panel without designing and measuring the quantitative 
features of individual defect types.

INTRODUCTION 
Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) using thin film transistor 
(TFT) arrays are very important display devices used in 
smart phones, video monitors and televisions. In order to 
improve the display quality of LCD panels and increase the 
yield, the inspection of defects in the TFT-LCD panels 
becomes a critical task in the LCD manufacturing process. 
Surface defects of a TFT-LCD panel not only cause 
visual failure but also cause electrical failure to operate the 
panel.  Appearance defects in a TFT-LCD panel can be 
roughly classified into two categories: macro and micro 
defects. Macro defects include “MURA”, “SIMI” and 
“ZURE”. MURA means unevenness of color on a TFT-LCD 
panel.  SIMI means stains on a panel, and ZURE means 
misalignment of a panel. Micro defects include pinholes, 
particles and scratches (see Figures 7(b1)-(d1) for the sample 
images).  The macro defects appear as high contrast regions 
with irregular sizes and shapes. They are generally large in 
size and, therefore, can be detected by human inspectors.  
However, micro defects are generally very small in size, and 
cannot be easily found by human personnel or detected with 
electrical methods. In this paper, we propose a global Fourier 
reconstruction scheme that especially focuses on the 
detection of micro defects by utilizing the repetitively 
structural pattern of TFT-LCD panels.

Related work 
There are several electrical and optical based inspection 
techniques available for TFT-LCD defect inspection [1]–[3].  
The voltage-imaging technique measures the characteristics 
of a TFT-LCD array by directly measuring the actual voltage 
distribution on the TFT pixels.  The main disadvantage of 
such approaches is that the probes used for voltage 
measurement must be separately designed for each panel 
configuration.  
A number of vision-based techniques were developed for 
LCD defect inspection. Song et al. [4] developed a wavelet-
based method to detect the MURA defects in low-resolution 
LCD images that involve non-textured surfaces. Lu and Tsai 
[5] applied the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to 
detect defects in patterned LCDs. It can effectively detect 
local defects, but cannot extract the exact shape of a detected 
defect. Liu et al. [6] also studied the TFT-LCD inspection 
problem. It used the Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) to 
extract image features, and then applied the Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) for classification. The LLE must be carried 
out in each pixel defined in a small window and is time-
consuming to calculate. The SVM requires a training process, 
and could be sensitive to environment changes. Kim et al. [7] 
used adaptive multi-level defect detection and probability 
density estimation for TFT-LCD inspection. It mainly 
focuses on MURA defects in non-textured surfaces.  Lin et al. 
[8] presented an image processing method for defect 
detection in TFT-LCD images, where the inspection surface 
contains only simple data lines and gate lines. The genetic 
algorithm (GA) heuristic algorithm is applied to adjust the 
inspection function parameters. Gan and Zhao [9] used the 
active contour for defect inspection of LCDs. It aims at the 
MURA defects in non-textured image surfaces of the LCD. 
The active contour is generally very computationally 
intensive, and cannot be used for small defect detection in 
complicated pattern surfaces. Ngo et al. [10] also presented 
an automatic detection method for MURA defects. The 
method is based on an accurate reconstruction of the 
background by training the background from a set of test

images. The existing vision-based techniques generally need 
a pre-stored reference image for comparison. This approach 
requires precise environmental controls such as alignment 
and lighting for the TFT-LCD panel under inspection. In our 
previous work [11], we proposed a Fourier-based method for 
defect detection in directional textures. It works successively 
for the LCD panels in a low resolution image that shows no 
TFT patterns. It fails to detect small defects in the LCD 
surfaces that present data lines, gate lines and TFTs. 
B.
Overview of the proposed method 
In the LCD manufacturing process, perpendicular data 
and gate conductive lines are patterned onto the glass 
substrate.  A thin film transistor is located at each 
intersection of the data and gate lines.  Figure 1 demonstrates 
the magnified image of a TFT-LCD panel under the 
resolution of 120 pixels/mm.  It comprises repetitive, 
horizontal gate lines and vertical data lines, in which the 
small black rectangular component at each intersection of 
lines is the TFT. Since the geometrical structure of a TFT-
LCD panel surface involves repetitive, equally-spaced 
horizontal and vertical lines, it can be classified as a 
structural texture with oriented line pattern. The structural 
pattern of a TFT-LCD panel results in a homogeneously 
textured image that consists of an arrangement primarily of 
horizontal and vertical lines appearing periodically on the 
surface. The problem of defect detection in TFT-LCD panel 
surfaces can now be considered as a texture analysis problem 
in image processing. 
The proposed method does not rely on conventional 
methods of textural feature extraction. It is based on a global 
image reconstruction scheme using the Fourier transform. 
The Fourier spectrum is ideally suited for describing the 
directionality of periodical line patterns in an image. The 
proposed Fourier-based image reconstruction scheme fully 
utilizes the structural characteristics of TFT-LCD panels by 
setting the frequency components that are associated with the 
repetitive, orthogonal lines and TFTs of a TFT-LCD panel 
image to zero, and back-transforming the Fourier domain 
image.  The Fourier reconstruction process will then remove 
all background texture of the TFT-LCD panel surface, and 
distinctly preserve local anomalies in the filtered image.  
This converts the difficult defect detection in a complicated 
textured-image to a simple thresholding in a uniform image.
The statistical process control is then used to set up the 
control limits (i.e., thresholds) for distinguishing between 
defective regions and faultless regions in the reconstructed 
image.  
This paper is organized as follows: Section II first 
discusses the Fourier transform and the properties of 
repetitive TFT-LCD pattern in the Fourier plane.  The 
removal of repetitive line and TFT patterns in the TFT-LCD 
panel is then described. Section III presents the experimental 
results from a number of TFT-LCD panel surfaces that 
contain faultless regions and micro-defects of pinholes, 
particles and scratches.  The paper is concluded in Section 
IV.

 Removal of data and gate lines 
A typical TFT-LCD panel consists of horizontal gate 
lines on one plane, and vertical data lines on the other plane.  
It results in an image of structural texture that contains 
orthogonal lines.  Figures 2(a) and 3(a) show two TFT-LCD 
sample images: one is a faultless surface, and the other 
contains a pinhole defect.  Figures 2(b) and 3(b) present the 
power spectra of the respective TFT-LCD surface images as 
an intensity function, where the brightness is proportional to 
the magnitude of the power spectrum 
( , )
P u v
.  Note that the 
transform of periodical data and gate lines in the spatial 
domain image results in high-energy frequency components 
distributed along the horizontal and vertical lines passing 
through the center in the Fourier plane.  Compared to the 
Fourier spectrum of the associated faultless TFT-LCD 
sample image, Figure 3(b) reveals that the pinhole defect has 
significant contribution to the frequency components around 
the center of the Fourier plane. 
In order to remove the orthogonal data and gate lines in a 
TFT-LCD surface image, we can edit the Fourier domain 
image and set the associated high-energy frequency 
components to zero, and then apply the inverse Fourier 
transform to reconstruct the image.  Let w

 denote by the 
notch width that determines the neighborhood regions for 
high-energy frequency components along both the horizontal 
line and vertical line in the Fourier plane.  The high-energy 
frequency components associated with the orthogonal data 
and gate lines in the TFT-LCD plane are set to zero as 
follows: 
Delete the frequency components within the horizontal notch 
of width w

, i.e. 
F(u,v)= 0
  for all u’s, and
v = ,0 ±1, ± 2,..., ± [Δ / 2]
w
so that the repetitive data lines in the spatial domain image 
can be removed. Also, delete the frequency components 
within the vertical notch of width w

F(u,v) = 0
 for all v’s, and 
/2]

so that the repetitive gate lines can be removed.  With the 
newly assigned values of

can be obtained using the discrete inverse Fourier transform.

in both faultless and defective TFT-LCD sample images are 
basically removed, and the pinhole defect is well preserved 
in the filter image.  However, residuals distributed 
periodically along the vertical direction remain in both 
reconstructed images of the faultless and the defective TFT-
LCD panel surfaces.  The residuals in the filtered image are 
the result of the patterned TFTs that locate at each 
intersection of the data and gate lines. 
B.
Removal of TFTs 
Given the Fourier spectrum of any complicated gray-level 
image, the frequency components circularly around the 
center of the Fourier plane are low frequency bands that 
represent the coarse approximation of the original gray-level 
image, and those apart from the center are high frequency 
bands that represent the details of the original image.  As 
seen in Figure 3(b), the local anomaly embedded in a 
homogeneous texture contributes the frequency components 
around the center of the Fourier plane.  The details of the 
homogeneous background texture are spread in the high 
frequency zone in the Fourier plane. 
By applying the band reject filtering that deletes all 
frequency components outside the circle of a specific radius, 
the details of TFTs in the original gray-level image can be 
removed.  As the filter radius increases, more details will be 
preserved in the reconstructed image.  We can sufficiently 
remove all background texture of TFT-LCD panels and 
distinctly preserve anomalies in the filtered image by 
simultaneously deleting all frequency components on the 
horizontal and vertical lines passing through the center and 
those outside the circle of a given radius 
*r  in the Fourier 
plane, i.e.

for TFT removal is 30 pixels for both test samples.  The 
results in Figures 4(c) and 5(c) show that the reconstructed 
image of the faultless TFT-LCD panel surface in Figure 2(a) 
becomes a uniform white image, and that of the defective 
surface in Figure 3(a) contains only the pinhole defect. 
Finally, we use the simple statistical process control limit 
to set up the threshold for distinguishing defects from the 
uniform background in the reconstructed image.  The upper

EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we present experimental results from a 
variety of micro defects including pinholes, particles and 
scratches in TFT-LCD panel surfaces to evaluate the efficacy 
of the proposed Fourier reconstruction scheme.  Figure 6 
shows the schema of the proposed automated visual 
inspection system, and the scan trajectory of the camera of a 
large LCD panel. The camera and light source are straightly 
on the top of the TFT-LCD panel. Two green bar-shaped 
LED lights are used for the illumination.  The proposed 
Fourier-based method is fast enough to process the 
16

inspection while the camera is moving around the LCD 
panel. The test images are 
256 256
 pixels wide with 8-bit 
gray levels.  Figure 7(a1)-(d1) shows respectively four 
images that involve a faultless surface, and three defective 
surfaces of pinhole, particle and scratch under the image 
resolution of 60 pixels/mm.  These three micro defects can 
only be detected in images of a fine resolution, and cannot be 
reliably observed in images with a resolution below 50 
pixels/mm. 
The proposed method does not require defect-free TFT-
LCD images for reference, and is tolerable to environmental 
changes, such as shifting and lighting.  The notch width w

used for eliminating the frequency components associated 
with orthogonal data and gate lines is 1 pixel for all test 
images. Throughout a preliminary experiment, a radius 
*r
of 30 pixels is used for all test samples in the detection of 
pinholes, particles and scratches. A large control constant K
of 5 is used in this study for the final segmentation in the 
reconstructed image.  
Figures 7(a2) through (d2) show the reconstructed results 
of the four test images in Figure 7(a1)-(d1), respectively.  
Figures 7(a3)-(d3) present the defect detection results of the 
reconstructed images, where pixels with gray values falling 
outside the control limits are marked in black, and the ones 
falling within the control limits appear in white.  The results 
reveal that the resulting image of the faultless TFT-LCD 
surface is uniformly white, and the defects in all three 
defective surfaces are correctly segmented in the binary 
images. The suspect defects (i.e., the black points in the 
binary image) are further classified by evaluating the sizes 
(for particles and pinholes) and lengths (for scratches, using 
the Hough transform to accumulate the pixels on a line) in 
the binary image. An additional experiment that involves 100 
defect-free test samples and 63 defective test samples is also 
conducted. The experimental results show all defective 
samples including particles, pinholes and scratches can be 
identified without false alarms if the defect sizes are larger 
than 
5
5  pixels. The proposed method can detect a defect as 
small as 0.17 mm in physical size. The processing time of 
Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform is around 
0.1 seconds for an image of size 
256256
 on a typical 
personal computer.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have considered the problem of 
detecting micro defects embedded in TFT-LCD patterned 
surfaces.  The proposed method is based on a global image 
reconstruction scheme using the Fourier transform. The 
merit of the proposed method is that it can be used to detect 
various ill-defined defects in a TFT-LCD panel without 
designing and measuring the quantitative features of 
individual defect types, and requires no template for the 
comparison. 
The method proposed in this paper can be considered as a 
supervised one since the proper notch width w

 and filter 
radius r* must be predetermined.  It can be selected according 
to the structural pattern of a TFT-LCD panel under a given 
image resolution. The proposed method in this study mainly 
focuses on the detection of micro defects. It can be extended 
to the inspection of non-structured anomalies, such as 
MURA, or fingerprint in a low-resolution image of the 
patterned TFT-LCD panel.
