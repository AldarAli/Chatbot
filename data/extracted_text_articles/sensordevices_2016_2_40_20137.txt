Abstract—This paper is a short overview of some piezoelectric 
materials and devices for generating renewable electricity 
under mechanical motion actions. Piezoelectric materials, 
usually crystals or ceramics, have the capability to generate a 
small amount of current, when they are subjected to 
mechanical pressure, such as pushing, bending, twisting, and 
turning. A vibrating piezoelectric device differs from a typical 
electrical power source in that it has capacitive rather than 
inductive source impedance, and may be driven by mechanical 
vibrations of varying amplitude. Several techniques have been 
developed to extract energy from the environment. Generally, 
“vibration energy” could be converted into electrical energy by 
three techniques: electrostatic charge, magnetic fields and 
piezoelectric. Mechanical resonance frequency of piezoelectric 
bimorph transducers depends on geometric size (length, width, 
and thickness of each layer), and the piezoelectric coefficients 
of the piezoelectric material. This paper will discuss about the 
manufacturing processes and intended applications of several 
energy harvesting devices.
Keywords-renewable electricity; energy harvesting; 
vibration energy; generator; converter; piezoelectric; 
silicon on insulator (SOI).
I.
 INTRODUCTION
Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four 
distinct areas: power generation, hot water / space heating, 
transport fuels, and rural (off-grid) energy services.
The concept of “harvesting” is relatively recent, and 
presumes the capturing of the normally lost energy 
surrounding a system and converting it into electrical energy 
that can be used to extend the lifetime of that system’s power 
supply or possibly provide an endless supply of energy to an 
electronic device, namely power harvesting.
Energy harvesting or Scavenging energy is an attractive 
concept because so many energy sources, such as: light, heat, 
and mechanical ambient vibrations that exist in our ambient 
living could be converted into usable electricity. 
Among alternative energy sources can include: water 
energy, water waves, wind, solar, heat, random vibration, 
noise, nonlinear mechanical rotations, mechanical shocks, 
etc. 
Several techniques have been proposed and developed to 
extract energy from the environment. In general, vibration 
energy could be converted into electrical energy using one of 
three techniques: electrostatic charge, magnetic fields and 
piezoelectric.
Multiple such materials, placed near each other could 
increase the electrical energy. The process of energy 
conversion in a piezoelectric material is based on the 
principle of the piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric 
elements store electrical energy as an electric field. The 
direct piezoelectric effect describes the material’s ability to 
transform mechanical strain into electrical charge. Many 
conventional systems consist of a single piezoceramic in 
bending mode (unimorph) or two bonded piezoelectric in 
bending mode (bimorph). Cantilevered piezoelectric energy 
harvesters have been investigated in the literature for energy 
harvesting. Piezoelectric generators [1] appropriate to 
convert the smallest mechanical deformations directly into 
electrical energy. This solid state effect is free of degradation 
in a wide operation range.
Some structures can be tuned to have two natural 
frequencies relatively close to each other, resulting in the 
possibility of a broader band energy harvesting system. The 
energy produced by these materials is in many cases far too 
small to directly power an electrical device. 
Advances in low-power electronics and in energy 
harvesting technologies have enabled the conception of truly 
self-powered devices [2]. 
By driving one element to expand while contracting the 
other one, the actuator is forced to bend, creating an out-of 
plane motion and vibrations [3]. Cantilevered piezoelectric 
energy harvesters have been investigated in the literature for 
energy harvesting [4]. MEMS (Micro-electro-mechanical 
System) array with multi-cantilevers was designed with 
single cantilever behaving closer resonance frequency one 
after another [5].
The paper was structured in five sections: I. Introduction; 
II. Piezoelectric conversion; III. Piezoelectric generators; IV. 
Piezoelectric devices, and V. Conclusions and future works.

PIEZOELECTRIC CONVERSION
Piezoelectric materials, usually crystals or ceramics, have 
the capability to generate a small amount of current, when 
they are subjected to mechanical pressure, such as pushing, 
bending, twisting, and turning. 
Piezoelectric materials exhibit the property that if they 
are mechanically strained, they generate an electric field 
proportional to the strain [6]. Conversely, when an electric 
field is applied the material undergoes strain. These 
anisotropic relationships are described by the piezoelectric

strain constant, d, which gives the relationship between 
applied stresses while the electro-mechanical coupling 
coefficient, k, describes the efficiency () with which energy 
is converted between mechanical and electrical forms, and Q 
the quality factor. This latter coefficient is important in 
determining the efficiency of a resonant generator since the 
overall efficiency of a piezo element clamped to a substrate 
and cyclically compressed at its resonant frequency is [6]:

Electrostatic convertions
Electrostatic conversion is based on the formation of a 
parallel plate capacitor onto which a charge is introduced 
from an external power source. Once the external source is 
disconnected then varying the capacitor configuration (plate 
overlap area or plate separation) causes the voltage and/or 
charge on the capacitor to vary. The varying voltage or 
charge may be extracted to provide electrical energy to a 
load.
For a parallel plate capacitor with plate area A and plate 
separation d, the capacitance is approximately

where ε is the dielectric constant of the insulating material

Attempts to change the stored energy by moving the 
capacitor plates cause a reaction force. This reaction force 
depends on whether the gap or the overlap area of the 
capacitor is varied and on whether the voltage or the charge 
is constrained.
III.
PIEZOELECTRIC GENERATORS
Piezoelectric generators are appropriate to convert the 
smallest mechanical deformations directly into electrical 
energy. This solid state effect is free of degradation in a 
wide operation range.
The process of energy conversion in a piezoelectric 
material is based on the principle of the direct piezoelectric 
effect. When a piezoelectric element is mechanically 
stressed it generates electrical charges.
Piezo energy harvesting has been investigated only since 
the late '90s and it remains an emerging technology.
The piezoelectric elements store electrical energy as an 
electric field. The direct piezoelectric effect describes the 
material’s ability to transform mechanical strain into 
electrical charge. Figure 1 presents the piezoelectric 
generators principle.
Figure 1. Piezoelectric generators principle.
A.
Piezoelectric materials
Several types of piezoelectric materials used in for 
energy harvesting devices are: PZT, piezoceramic / polymer 
composites, piezoelectric polymers, etc.
The most common types of piezoelectric materials used 
in power harvesting applications are:
a) Lead zirconate titanate, a piezoelectric ceramic, or 
piezoceramic, known as PZT; 
b) Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). PVDF is a 
piezoelectric polymer that exhibits considerable flexibility 
when compared to PZT.
Other 
piezoelectric 
materials 
are 
Fiber-based 
piezoelectric (piezofiber) material consisting of PZT fibers 
of various diameters (15, 45, 120, and 250 μm) that were 
aligned, laminated, and molded in an epoxy (Macro Fiber 
Composite – MFC).  The Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) is 
the leading low-profile actuator and sensor offering high 
performance, durability and flexibility in a cost − 
competitive device. 
In the Table 1 we compared the electrical, piezoelectric 
and dielectric characteristics of piezoelectric materials from 
several companies (PZT - Brush Clevite Corporation, 
Morgan Advanced Materials; PXE – Philips; Piezolan - VEB

KKW Hermsdorf), where noted: Coupling coefficients (Keff, 
k), piezoelectric coefficients (g31, d31), strain coefficients (s), 
mechanical quality factor (Qm), Curie temperature (Tc). 
A vibrating piezoelectric device differs from a typical 
electrical power source in that it has capacitive rather than 
inductive source impedance, and may be driven by 
mechanical vibrations of varying amplitude.
A more attractive configuration is to form the 
piezoceramic into a cantilever arrangement, as shown in 
Figure 2, where layers of piezoceramics are bonded to a 
substrate, typically made from a suitable metal. This 
structure allows a lower resonant frequency to be achieved 
while producing large strains in the piezoceramic. Where 
two layers of piezo material are used, the structure is referred 
to as a bimorph. In this case, the piezo layers may either be 
connected in series or parallel. If only a single piezo layer is 
used, the structure is referred to as a unimorph [6]. 
Figure 2.  Piezoceramic cantilever resonator [6].
Piezoelectric 
unimorph 
cantilever 
consists 
of 
a 
piezoelectric layer which is sandwiched between two 
conducting electrodes and positioned on the top of shim 
layer. Alomari et al. [7] proposed a mathematical analysis of 
dynamic magnifier model for the piezoelectric unimorph 
beam. 
Bimorph actuators consist of two independent flat 
piezoelectric elements, stacked on top of the other. By 
driving one element to expand while contracting the other 
one, the actuator is forced to bend, creating an out-of plane 
motion and vibrations. Series and parallel operation modes 
for bimorph actuators are function of electrical connection 
and the polarization (P) orientation of piezoelectric layers 
(Figure 3). 
Series Operation refers to the case where supply voltage 
is applied across all piezo layers at once. The voltage on any 
individual layer is the supply voltage divided by the total 
number of layers. A 2-layer device wired for series 
operation uses only two wires, one attached to each outside 
electrode (Figure 3a). Parallel Operation refers to the case 
when a metallic blade is fixed between both piezoelectric 
layers and connected like in Figure 3b).

Spark generation
An important application of PZT elements is the 
conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy, with 
maximum efficiency and amount of energy [9].
A PZT cylinder hit with a mechanical shock can generate 
a high voltage electrical spark that processed by electronic 
circuits is stored in special batteries (Figure 5).
Figure 5. The principle of high voltage and spark generation [8]. 
In the experimental works we performed a set-up with a 
mechanical pendulum, which applied mechanical shocks on 
a fixed PZT tore of 6 mm thickness. According to the direct 
piezoelectric effect, PZT element converted the mechanical 
energy into an electrical one. The electrical signal picked up 
on the electrodes of PZT element has been detected and 
measured with a Tektronix oscilloscope with memory. The 
voltage peak can reach hundreds of volts (Figure 6).

A piezoelectric ceramic can be depolarized by a strong 
electric field with polarity opposite to the original poling 
voltage. The typical operating limit is between 500V/mm 
and 1 000V/mm for continuous application.
High mechanical stress can depolarize a piezoelectric 
ceramic. The limit on the applied stress is dependent on the 
type of ceramic material, and duration of the applied stress.
A part of the energy generated by the PZT transducer can 
be stored in a capacitor and can be used to power a circuit. 
IV.
PIEZOELECTRIC DEVICES
Some examples of piezoelectric devices and their 
applications are presented below.
A.
PVDF bimorph transducer
PVDF is a piezoelectric polymer that exhibits 
considerable flexibility when compared to PZT.
PVDF pre-polarized piezoelectric bimorph structure was 
realized on two PVDF thin films, with 25 μm thickness and 
31 pC/N d31 piezoelectric coefficient. The PVDF bimorph 
transducer started vibration at low alternative voltage, such 
as 10 V, developing more than 1 mm aperture displacement 
at its end. The piezoelectric bimorph actuators [3] can be 
well suited to be implemented in devices for laser system 
micrometry displacement. PVDF bimorph transducers have 
advantages, such as: small size and weight, greater 
flexibility, however they do not have sufficient mechanical 
rigidity so they cannot bear heavy seismic masses.
B.
MEMS piezoelectric energy harvesting device
Micromachined piezoelectric cantilever having low 
resonant frequency range between 60 Hz and 200 Hz, was 
developed by Shen at al. [10] appropriate for frequency 
range, common for environmental vibration sources.
As an application, we mention the MEMS PZT 
cantilever with an integrated Si proof mass, fabricated on a 
silicon 
on 
insulator 
(SOI) 
wafer, 
and 
a 
Pt/PZT/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si/SiO2 multilayer device is generated for 
low frequency vibration energy harvesting [9]. In 
manufacturing MEMS, thin film deposition and etching 
with patterns are used, as shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7. The schematic of the side view of a piezoelectric energy 
harvesting cantilever based on a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer [9].
The measured impedance and phase angle of the PZT 
cantilever versus the exciting frequency are shown in Figure 
8. The resonant frequency peak in the phase angle is about 
184.16 Hz [10]. 
Figure 8. Measured resonant frequency of the PZT cantilever device [10].
A MEMS (Micro-electro-mechanical System) array with 
multi-cantilevers was designed with single cantilever 
behaving closer resonance frequency one after another [11]. 
Each cantilever is one spring–mass–damper system with one 
degree of freedom. When cantilevers with closer resonance 
frequency are connected together as an array, the available 
bandwidth covers the range of minimum to maximum 
resonance value of the cantilevers in the array. MEMS 
fabrication technology ensures the advantage of mass 
production of cantilevers with various structure parameters 
in an array. 
In the application described by Shen et al. [10], a made-
up power generator array was realized by the MEMS 
process using cantilevers with different sizes (Figure 9): 12 
mm silicon layer thickness, 3.2 mm PZT layer thickness, the 
length and width in range of 2000–3500 mm and 750–1000 
mm respectively, having the resonant frequency in the range 
of 200–400 Hz. The micro-power generator array device 
was made by many PZT film transducers, in order to capture 
low-level vibrations from the environment. 
Serial connection among cantilevers of the array was 
investigated and the prototype performed well, such as: 3.98 
mW effective electrical power and 3.93 VDC output voltage 
on the load resistance. This device is promising to support 
networks of ultra-low-power, peer-to-peer, wireless nodes.

C.
Sensor network
Energy-harvesting can enable a new mode of operation, 
namely, the energy-neutral mode in which the system uses 
only as much energy as is available from the environment 
[12]. 
Figure 10. A generic sensor network node with energy harvesting device 
[13].
The power consumed by a network node can be split 
between the various functions. A structure of a general 
sensor network node is described by Benini et. al. [13], with 
the key elements shown in Figure 10. The power 
requirement of each element depends on the particular 
application.
D.
Energy harvesting piezoelectric circuitry
Piezoelectric generators are appropriate to convert the 
smallest mechanical deformations directly into electrical 
energy. This solid state effect is free of degradation in a 
wide operation range. A vibrating piezoelectric device 
differs from a typical electrical power source in that it has 
capacitive rather than inductive source impedance, and may 
be driven by mechanical vibrations of varying amplitude. 
Figure 11 describes a PZT element generator with diodes 
and parallel capacitor. 
Figure 11. PZT element generator with diodes and parallel capacitor. 
The principle of charge generation by a PZT disc to an 
electronic circuit performance are the shape of the PZT 
transducer, the manner in which the transducer is mounted 
and, of course, the nature of the electrical load (Figure 12). 
Figure 12. Mechanical force applied to a PZT disc followed by an energy 
converter. 
A PZT disc compressed between two metal surfaces will 
expand in the radial direction less than a thin cylinder. So the 
way in which the material is mounted will directly affect the 
energy conversion per unit volume. The general rule 
therefore is to allow the PZT body some freedom to expand 
radially since charge generation is directly coupled to 
deformation.
Typical energy harvesting circuitry consists of voltage 
rectifier, converter and storage (Figure 13).
Figure 13. Typical energy harvesting circuitry.
Generally, the device will include an appropriate 
transducer, converter of mechanical energy to electrical one, 
chopper, 
dc-cc 
converter 
and 
high 
performance 
microcontroller which will control the performances, and 
stability of the all system.  
E.
Low energy harvesting power source
A self-powered autonomous wireless sensor system 
composed of a power source and a wireless sensing 
communication system (Figure 14) was realized by Marsic 
et. al. [14].
Figure 14. Block diagram of a wireless sensor node powered by a vibration 
energy harvester. [14]
The 
design 
optimization 
[14] 
for 
low 
power 
consumption minimization ensures the system’s energy 
autonomous capability.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
Several techniques have been proposed and developed to 
extract energy from the environment. In general, “vibration 
energy” could be converted into electrical energy by three 
techniques: electrostatic charge, magnetic fields and 
piezoelectric.
Piezoelectric materials like PZT and PVDF embedded in 
different 
electronic 
configurations 
are 
suitable 
for 
applications, such as: unimorph, bimorph and multilayers 
transducers, energy harvesting circuitry, sensor network 
nodes with energy harvesting devices, multilayer devices 
generated for low frequency vibration energy harvesting, 
micromachining PZT cantilever, micro-power generator

array, energy harvesting sensor networks, networks of ultra-
low-power, peer-to-peer, wireless nodes, etc.
Mechanical 
resonance 
frequency 
of 
piezoelectric 
bimorph transducers depends on geometric size (length, 
width, and thickness of each layer), and the piezoelectric 
coefficients (d31 and s11) of the piezoelectric material.
In future work we will study the influence of mechanical 
impacts (shocks) on the behavior of piezoelectric elements 
function of the piezoelectric elements characteristics 
(material type, size, volume, thickness, impact value, etc.); in 
order to increase the values of generated electrical charges 
and device efficiency.
