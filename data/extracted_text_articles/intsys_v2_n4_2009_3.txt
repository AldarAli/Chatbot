Abstract- It is becoming increasingly important for coun-
tries like Japan, Finland and Italy to enable as wide as
possible home care for their elderly citizens because of the
rapidly changing age structure of the population and high
hospital costs. Wireless sensors hidden in furnishings ( as a
reference to a Finnish ongoing project ) can provide neces-
sary information for the high quality planning of home
care visits. The relative positions of the radios are now fixed
because of their relations to the furnishings. When conduc-
tive or metallic walls, floors or objects are found in the
apartment, an antenna can hit a radio fade caused by shad-
owing or the summing up of waves. The Link Quality Indi-
cator of a ZigBee® receiver can vary by up to 50 units
within a short distance because of the floor, compromising
the radio range. This paper describes the principles of a
radio construction which is able to move the antenna ele-
ment inside the enclosure of the radio unit along an X-
shaped path along the major mechanical plane of the radio
unit. Two electrical motors dynamically optimise the loca-
tion of the internal antenna element to fit the current radio
propagation environment. The paper also describes the
feasibility and cost factors associated with the new struc-
ture. The achieved effect is a useful countermeasure
against shadowing and multipath in the 2.44 GHz band but
provides only a partial solution to the problem in the 868
MHz band, due to the space limitations in a typical radio
unit. A prototype of the Diversity Adaptability radio was
built and the capability to remarkably enhance the received
power in difficult fading conditions was verified in an
anechoic chamber. The observed side effects to the direc-
tional pattern of the radio were analysed to be removable by
carefully selecting the route of the coaxial cable from the
radio unit to the moving antenna element.

I. INTRODUCTION
Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences ( MiUAS ) is
situated in the South-Eastern district of Finland that
has one of the most challenging predicted demographic
structures for the 2020s in Europe. The eastern part of
the district is expected to have 44700 inhabitants in
2020, 2130 of which will need daily care, 1580 be-
cause of memory disorders . The age structure of the
population can be characterised by calculating what
proportion of the population is children and of over 65
years old, divided by the number of people that are in
the working age. The fresh population forecast gives a
ratio 75,3% for Eastern Finland for 2020 /17/ . The
situation will be more challenging for Eastern Finland
than to the whole Finland. In Finland the ratio is
caused by the unusually high birth rates in 1945 – 1955
and in Italy and Japan by the low birth rates after 1980.
The forecasted population structures of these countries
show challenges in financing the health care for the
elderly [18].

Data communication from homes has become feasi-
ble due to GSM and Flash OFDM ( at 450 MHz )
WWAN networks. Wireless communication has also
become feasible at homes due to low cost short range
radios such as ZigBee ®. The MiUAS generated an
initiative to send to the hospital district home care visit
recommendations generated at a call centre and based
on real time event messages sent wirelessly from the
homes of the elderly [14]. The project is now financed
by the ERDF instrument of the European Structural
Fund ( ESF ) and governed locally. The project built
37 test homes in 2 cities, 2 towns and 2 municipalities.
We are aiming at 40% reduction in hospital days for a
selected group due to increased home care, with corre-
sponding cost savings. The main result will be the new
work process. Recommendations of action based on
real time sensor data have not been used in planning of
home visits before. The decision rules for extracting
recommendations of action from sensor data will also
be new. The main technical challenges are how to
maximise the time between replacing batteries to the
sensor that detects motion in the living room and by
providing countermeasures to the effects of RF shad-
owing and fading. Otherwise the ZigBee technology is
already quite field proven, e.g. in the U.S. networks
that read kWh-readings of consumed electricity from
homes. The first challenge is related to different tactics
to keep the receiver circuitry of the sensor device on as
little as possible. The second challenge is related to the
situation when the transmitter of the device is transmit-
ting sensor data in an environment with shadowing.
The battery life aspect was addressed in [2].
II.
MOBILE
CARE
IN
EASTERN
FINLAND PROJECT
The Mobile Care service will produce three kinds of
products: alarms, emergency voice calls and recom-
mendations of actions, like home care visits. The op-
erators generating recommendations can view the fol-
lowing events:
- usage of a selected electrical appliance , such as a
microwave oven
- motion in the living room
- pressure distribution on the bed
- whether the main door is opened or shut
- usage of the electrical cooker
- verification of taking medication pills out of
a smart pill box
- whether the inhabitant is inside / outside of the
apartment.
The homes have VoIP handsets with one button
call initiation. The Central Unit has both a WWAN
radio and a WLAN base station in addition to ZigBee.
This also enables IP cameras. A ZigBee wrist device
with an alarm button completes the set [14]. The re-
cently founded company IsCom Oy continues the work
of Riihonlahti Services Ltd in the project. The project
started a field test with 37 homes in October 2009. The
final project report is expected in April 2010.
A plan for the next phase includes a project that
takes UML descriptions of the decision rules of creat-
ing action recommendations out of sensor data ( a
result of the current project ) and develops an expert
system
that
will
deliver
recommendations
semi-
automatically under the supervision of a nurse. MiUAS
is now also a partner of a funding proposal to the EU
COST programme for deep co-operation between or-
ganisations that have similar goals than MiUAS in the
field of Smart Homes oriented to Health. The proposal
was filed in September 2009 by Coventry University.

RESEARCH NEEDS FOR REACHING
THE
REQUIRED
LEVELS
OF
RELIABILITY
The error control methods: error control coding and
retransmissions operate on a single wireless channel
and add redundancy to the data packets to improve
reliability. Their usefulness is however sometimes
compromised over real fading RF channels. If the
packet transmission both starts and passes the packet
deadline in a deep fade, the methods mentioned before
are usually not successful in delivering the packet [8].
The former reference is convinced that the incorpo-
ration of the spatial diversity approach into error-
control is a very promising approach.
In the Mobile Care Eastern Finland concept some of
the sensors can be invisibly embedded into furnishings.
This eliminates the possibility of moving the sensor
radio slightly so that heavy shadowing or a heavy slow
fading can be avoided. We then decided to study spa-
tial diversity to achieve as high as possible reliability
in delivering the measurement results of the sensors.
This is particularly important with the bed pressure
distribution sensor. The later applications of this sensor
can include e.g. an analysis of the breathing parameters
during sleep.
IV.
RADIO PROPAGATION ENVIRON-
MENTS RELATED TO USAGE AT
HOMES OF THE ELDERLY
A typical home where we are expecting to use the
Mobile Care service in Eastern Finland is a wooden
single family house. Typical dimensions for this house
type are: floor area 8 x 8 m, a second floor with nar-
rower rooms 2.7 m above the first floor and a fireplace
downstairs built of bricks. The radio propagation here
through the structures at 2.4 GHz has a fairly low level
of shadowing. The findings in [7] support this conclu-
sion. The metal casing above the stove and by the
chimney typically cause some effects.
Another frequency available in Finland is 868.3
MHz according to the standard EN 300 220-1, with a
longer range than for the ISM band with a 1 mW
transmit power.
It is however also common that the inhabitant lives
in a block of flats with steel reinforced concrete walls
and floors. There is some heavy shadowing and reflec-
tions present particularly due to washing machines,
water pipes and dish washers.
The reference [4] examined an office space of 30 x
15 m and found that the attenuation caused by a 0.14 m
thick concrete wall was in the order of 5 dB.
The reference [5] uses the parameter Link Quality
Indicator LQI to describe propagation effects. The LQI
was interpreted there to represent well the chip error
rate. In the case of a floor consisting of wood and poly-
styrene, sharp variations in LQI , 50 units out of the
total range of 255 units along a 0.25 metre section of
the propagation path were detected. The dielectric
constant of polystyrene at 1 MHz is of the order of
2.75 [9]. The bending of radio waves is heavily corre-
lated with the dielectric constant. It is evident that
more studies would be needed on the effects of floor
coverings made of different dielectric plastics materi-
als.
In [6] measurements of RSSI ( Received Signal
Strength Indicator ) were performed up to a distance of
32 metres in an indoor scenario. The Packet Error Rate
( PER ) was found to be low until the distance reached
25 metres. Severe degradation of 802.15.4 was how-
ever detected in the active space of a 802.11b/g
( WLAN ) base station, if the WLAN channels and the
SRR ( Short Range Radio ) frequencies overlapped.
There are however at least 4 pieces of 802.15.4 chan-
nels not severely overlapping with the 802.11b/g chan-
nels. The WLAN usage is at the moment very common
in Finnish blocks of flats.
The rationale to study a solution that can move the
antenna element to various positions inside the device
is based on the characteristics of current two-element
diversity antennas. These antennas have two elements
at fixed positions from each other. The reference [3]
points out that when the distance between the edges of
the antenna elements is e.g. 41.7 mm ( very suitable for
our purpose ), the gain of the combination has gain
minima -22 dB .. -18 dB deep on the horizontal plane
as can be predicted from the theory of antenna arrays.
We want to avoid the existence of these gain minima.
V. THE SPATIAL DIVERSITY SOLUTION
The design parameters of the 802.15.4 are well
suited to our usage scenario because our expected
required ranges as such are nearly always less than 25
metres. The challenge is mostly related to slow fading
caused by the summing of the signals related to a direct
path and reflections from metal surfaces.
The fitting of the sensor/radio devices discreetly
into furnishings usually prevents the moving of the
device with a built in antenna element which is re-
quired to avoid a deep fade. We decided to study the
possibility of arranging spatial diversity that would be
internal to the device and be arranged with only one

425
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
antenna element to minimise antenna, signal division
and cabling costs in addition to avoiding gain minima
at certain angles. No prior art studies about antenna
elements moving inside the enclosure of a device, in
connection with sensors for home care were found.
The typical device dimensions of a combined sen-
sor, logic and RF circuitry are 50 x 50 mm without the
battery compartment [10]. Willig [8] mentions that
antenna movements of even a few centimetres are
adequate to change the value of the spatial autocovari-
ance function. The half wavelength in the ISM band is
around 62 mm. If we move the antenna element along
a path with a 45 degree angle to the sides of the enclo-
sure, the available movement is of the order of 70 mm
in an enclosure also housing a typical 2500 mm2
printed circuit board.
Benefits found in printed circuit antennas include:
narrow bandwidth, mechanical strength, low cubic
volume and low cost. A modern antenna design is
presented in [3]. The bandwidth of a Hilbert inverted-
F-antenna ( IFA ) for 2400 MHz is 3.3% or 80 MHz.
This fits well with a scenario where we would use the
5th and the 10th channel of 802.15.4 so that they fall in
between two wider WLAN channels. The WLAN
channels are however this narrow only in the U.S., and
in Europe wider WLAN channels are admitted, bring-
ing more spectral overlapping to ZigBee and WLAN.
These particular ZigBee channels are separated by 25
MHz. The Hilbert IFA would then reject the major
parts of two WLAN channels and amplify only WLAN
channel 6 and the two selected ZigBee channels. The
dimensions of this Hilbert IFA are 2.7 x 5.6 x 1.5 mm
and the gain is 1.0 – 1.5 dBi.
The mechanical construction consists of a plastic
board with the movement route holes above the circuit
board, with the flexible antenna coaxial cable attached
to the centre of the circuit board.
Springs are attached to the 90 degree and 270 de-
gree corners of the plastic board. Opposite to the
springs there are two miniature electric motors. The
Kysan Electronics FF-K10WA-5Z215 miniature motor
has an 11.5 mm long chassis. It provides 0.06 mN/m
torque at 14000 rpm and 0.09 W [11]. If the used pul-
ley has a diameter of 3 mm, the required spooling for a
70 mm displacement is 7 full turns and the spooling
time is 30 milliseconds. The other dimensions of the
motor are: 6 x 8 mm. The antenna element slides along
the X-shaped path drawn by one of the motors at a
time. Whenever one motor is moving the antenna
sledge the other motor is idle.
The antenna sledge is attached to both springs and
both motors via lines. The basic orientation is with the
sledge at the crossing of the two paths. The force
against the spring is 0.04 N and the desired spring
constant is 0.1 N/m, slightly less than the motor can
stretch. The small pulleys for the motors can hold the
line attached to the sledge.
When the antenna diversity module is 60 x 60 mm,
the routes ( 2 ) of the sledge at 45 degree angles can be
70 mm long each, forming together an X-shaped
movement area. This means that the length of the route
from one end of the route to the centre is 35 mm and
the maximum additional movement to any of the re-
maining three corners is also 35 mm .
When the sledge is moving, the motor that is not
pulling the line, is releasing a maximum of 70 mm of
line. The springs are capable of overcoming the sliding
friction of the sledge. Therefore the sledge has also a
micro sized servo in it to stop the movement wherever
this is needed.
An example of a state-of-the-art servo is the Pico
from GWS [12]. The dimensions are: 22.8 x 9.5 x 15.5
mm and the axle turns 60 degrees in 0.12 seconds. The
activated servo will lock the sledge at the desired posi-
tion against the pull of the springs.
When used together with the frequency of 868.3
MHz, the ratio of the dimension of the path of the
antenna movement to the wavelength is only 0.2. It is
then uncertain that the maximum improvement in the
field strength would be as high as if operating at 2.44
GHz.
VI. EFFECTS ON THE SENSOR
DEVICES FROM THE ADDED
DIVERSITY ADAPTABILITY
FUNCTION
The coupling of the interference ( EMI ) from the
digital circuits to the antenna is considerable in relation
to the reception. The sharp edges of digital signals
generate interference energy at high frequencies. The
nonlinearities of the receiver can leak this energy into
the received signal due to nonlinear mixing results. A
sensitive receiver with fast digital circuits nearby is
therefore usually a result of an iterative designing and
prototyping process.
Now as we are moving the antenna unit above the
logic circuits, the design of the electronic module is
more challenging than ever. The complexity of the
circuitry is however much lower than in a 3G cellular
phone with fast processing and a GPS receiver.
Because of the Diversity Adaptability function the
cubic volume of the wireless sensor device grows big-
ger. The effect from the empty space in between the
electronics board and the plastic board is 36 cm3 if we
allow 10 mm vertical space for the flexible coaxial
cable for movement during the optimisation of the
reception. The two motors consume 1.1 cm3 of space
and the servo 3.4 cm3. The required space for the an-

426
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
tenna sledge compartment can be estimated to be 18
cm3. This can be compared with the volume of an AA
sized primary battery, 8 cm3. Because our advanced
device is now larger than a standard device, it is more
difficult to hide it in certain kinds of furnishings.
The additional cost is: two motors 4.9 € , servo 10.8
€ and cables plus additional mechanical gear and a
larger enclosure 1 €, bringing the additional cost to
16.7 €. This means roughly doubling the component
cost of the wireless sensor device. When compared to
the new ability to dynamically minimise the packet
error rate of ZigBee in changing propagation environ-
ments, the extra cost can sometimes be acceptable.
VII.
CONCLUSIONS
FOR
THE
THEORETICAL CONCEPT
The critical nature of delivering sensor measure-
ment results reliably in a service assisting the planning
of medical home care visits generated a concept where
one single antenna element is moving inside the wire-
less sensor device to minimise the packet error rate.
The optimisation can adapt to a changing environment
such as the later positioning of new home appliances in
or out of the line-of-sight paths between the radios.
The concept shows theoretical promise to help in
situations where the location of the sensor devices is
fixed and cannot be fine tuned to avoid fades. The
component cost of the device is doubled as is its cubic
volume when compared to a conventional device.
A clear benefit of the solution compared to a com-
peting scenario, the two-element diversity antenna, is
the absence of gain minima at certain angles, associ-
ated with the pair of antenna elements.
I also recognised the need for more study on the ef-
fects of dielectric floor coverings to ZigBee propaga-
tion due to the possible bending of waves in the floor
coverings.
VIII. DESIGNING A PROTOTYPE FOR THE
DIVERSITY AVAILABILITY ( DA ) FUNCTION
The design of the prototype was based on the princi-
ple presented at the 3rd International Conference on
Sensor Technologies and Applications /1/ , ( FIG 4).
This article describes a real transceiver pair designed
and built according to the concept from [1] and about
its measured performance. From the wide selection of
commercial ZigBee modules we chose devices from
the product line of Dresden Elektronik Ingenieurtech-
nik GmbH in Germany. The unit providing an interface
to the PC and to an external antenna is called the Sen-
sor Terminal Board ( STB ). The dimensions are 100 x
75 mm. It has connectors for the actual radio board.
The radio board is called the Radio Controller Board
RCB230SMA. It has horizontal dimensions of 53 x 52
mm coming very close to our previous size assump-
tions.
Figure 4.
DA realised with two motors pulling a sledge against
springs. The sledge has a servo for braking and an antenna element
on it.
The radio Controller Board is capable of transmitting
at +3 dBm. The transceiver chip is the Atmel
AT86RF230. The board manufacturer gave us great
co-operation and programmed the two STBs to use a
constant frequency of 2,44 GHz and a transmit power
of -10 dBm. These parameters would be suitable for
the later tests in an anechoic chamber. In addition, the
STB that would be selected to be the network device
and receiving continuous temperature measurement
data from the coordinator device was capable of out-
putting its own RSSI ( Received Signal Strength Indi-
cator ) measurement results continuously and at suit-
able 1 second intervals to the USB connector.
The prototype of the network device uses a flat chip
antenna instead of a higher quarter wave stub as origi-
nally planned. Samples of the interesting Hilbert IFA
[3] are not available anymore so we selected a very
small chip antenna from the manufacturer Yageo Cor-
poration. Again, we received excellent co-operation
and got samples of the Yageo 3216 PIFAs ( Planar
Inverted-F ) antennas. Instead of the 2,7 x 5,6 mm
dimensions from the original plan we now moved to
the 1,6 x 3,2 mm range. The mean effective gain for
Yageo is +0,14 dBi, slightly less than for the Hilbert
IFA of [3]. The directional pattern is not perfectly
omnidirectional as the maximum gain to a space angle
is +3,7 dBi [13].
We then built the printed circuit board for the PIFA
exactly according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions ( including the matching components ) and con-
nected the antenna unit to the SMA coaxial connector
of the Dresden RCB used as a network device with a
50 ohm cable of the type RG 178 B.
The structure of
the prototype network device can be seen from FIG. 5.
A good feature of the construction is the 20 x 30 mm

427
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
printed circuit board for the PIFA, having a large
ground plane visible on the picture against the elec-
tronics situated underneath. For the measurements the
antenna unit was turned 180 degrees vertically com-
pared to this picture.
The servo is the same unit as selected earlier, the
GWS Pico [12]. The motors of the prototype are Mo-
traxx K10WAs from Motraxx Elektrogeraete GmbH.
The specifications are very close to the ones from
Kysan [11].

motors are visible. The servo for the braking function is underneath
the board which has the X-shaped hole.

LABORATORY
TEST
ARRANGEMENTS
FOR
THE
PROTOTYPE
After investigating different service providers for
anechoic chambers we selected the Turku University of
Applied Sciences’ chamber. Their facility is situated in
SW Finland and uses a RFD-FA-100 room by ETS-
Lindgren. The internal dimensions are : 6,4 m x 3,44 m
x 3,0m (h). The level of internal reflections compared
to the direct wave is -20 dB. The overall appearance of
the anechoic chamber can be seen in FIG. 6.
The distance between the transmitter and the DA
receiver was chosen to be 3,27 m. The height of the
transmitter antenna from the floor was 1,15 m and 1,00
m at the receiver. The slight angle of 2,6 degrees for
the line connecting the antennas compared to horizon-
tal does not affect the received power. The transmitter
antenna was an omnidirectional quarter wave stub from
Dresden Elektronik.
The room has a non-reflective turning table that can
be remote controlled from outside the chamber.

LABORATORY TEST RESULTS
The simulated condition of a severe signal minimum
caused by multipath was created with one 0,6 x 1,2 m
aluminium plate hanging vertically and at a 90 degree
horizontal angle compared to the signal path. The
achieved weakening of the signal was 17dB.
The ZigBee radio working as a coordinator is seen in
FIG. 7.
Figure 7. The ZigBee coordinator radio in the anechoic chamber.
The DA effect was achieved by selecting 8 adaptation
positions for the DA antenna unit that is capable of
moving along the
X-shaped
path.
The
direction
“North” was at the receiver directly away from the
transmitter antenna. The DA positions were named as
NE ½ , NE1, SE ½ , SE1, SW ½ , SW1 , NW ½ and
NW1. The positions “ ½ “ were halfway from the cen-

428
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
tre of the X towards the ends of one of the four 35 mm
long DA paths. The positions “ 1 “ were 35 mm away
from the centre of the X.

Table 1. The RSSIs when using the DA function. The unrotated
RSSI before providing the back reflector was -59 dBm.
The elapsed time between DA0 and DA9 was 10
minutes. The usage of only one reflector caused a hys-
teresis of 4 dB during the DA test ( -74 dBm - -78
dBm).
The DA function was able to raise the RSSI by at
least 15 – 19 dB. The best position for this test setting
was the DA position SW ½ . The rotation of the an-
tenna element during the linear movement was negligi-
ble and as we can see from the second measurement
described below, the angular response at the angles
close to the angle used in the test above was nearly flat.
The second test was the examination of the direc-
tional pattern of the DA unit antenna gain against the
horizontal rotation angle.
The ZigBee network device on the electrically ro-
tatable measurement table can be seen in FIG. 8.
The measurements were taken every 5 degrees, rotat-
ing clockwise when seen from above the DA unit with
the starting point RSSI-0 pointing directly away from
the transmitter antenna. The average RSSI over 72
measurements over the angles was -62,3 dBm. The
average of the standard deviations of the powers at
angles was 0.45 dB when the sample size at every
angle was 20 samples. The dBm-readings were then
rounded to the nearest 0.5 dBm reading to the table,
because the radio gave the individual readings to the
terminal emulation software only at a resolution of 1
dBm. The typical 90% confidence level of the power
readings at the angles from the t-distribution with the
sample size 20 is + - 0.78 dB.

Table 2. The RSSIs of the DA prototype at different horizontal
rotation angles.
These results can be seen also in polar format on FIG.
9.
The diagram shows the numbers of the rotation
measurement stops from RSSI-0 to RSSI-73 with
RSSI-0 and RSSI-73 at the same angle.
When compared to the specification of the Yaego
3216 PIFA which itself is not perfectly omnidirec-
tional, we observed one new gain minimum caused by
the construction of the DA unit prototype. The gain
minimum corresponding to the rotation angle of 125
degrees caused an RSSI of -82 dBm. With the rotation
angles of 120 and 130 degrees, the gain was already
more than 10 dB higher.

When also taking into account the loss in the RG 178

cal prediction. Actually the received power was the

ADDITIONAL
MECHANICAL
PRINCIPLES
In addition to the current approach with one move-
ment plane with one X-shaped path, the function can
be realised with two movement planes. The lower
plane has one straight hole in the horizontal direction
of 45 degrees and is attached to an upper plane. The
whole lower plane can move around a knob situated
below. The second, upper plane has a corresponding
straight hole at an angle of 135 degrees and can move
along the hole that is at a 90 degree angle with the
lower hole.
The hole can also be circular in shape, e.g. from an
angle of 3 degrees to 357 degrees. The antenna element
would be attached to a pole corresponding to the hand
of a clock. The hand is attached to only one motor that
is situated at the centre of the circle.
If the original one-plane with two motors construc-
tion is used, one additional release mechanism is
needed close to one of the springs. This mechanism
selects the required one of two possible directions at 90
degree angles to what the spring is pulling the antenna
sledge.
For practical control of the position with good long
term stability, a measurement of the position of the

430
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
sledge would be required for control feedback. The
measurement can be optical, with an LED on the lower
side of the sledge and photodiodes attached to the radio
board under the movement plane.
XII.
ENERGY
MINIMISATION
ASPECTS
AND SHADOWING
The main addition to the energy consumption in
this concept compared to traditional solutions is during
the running of the two Motraxx electrical motors one at
a time. The usual starting position of the antenna
sledge is from the centre point of the x-shaped antenna
path. The efficiency of the motors is at a maximum
with a 3.0 V supply voltage and with a 0.12 A current,
providing rotation at 13800 RPM. The maximum dis-
tance travelled by the sledge during the measurement
phase is 4 times 70 mm, or 280 mm. After this, the
sledge simply moves to the most optimal measured
position in terms of the packet error rate. The average
distance travelled then is 17.5 mm. The end stage of
the motor driver circuit is a switching transistor with a
high efficiency.
With the planned pulley each 10 mm sledge move-
ment takes one turn of the axle and lasts for 4.3 ms.
The length of the steps is 10 mm. To find a new opti-
mum antenna position would take an average of 30
steps. The duration of the whole procedure is domi-
nated by the time to measure the new Received Signal
Strength or the packet error rate and not by the move-
ment periods of the antenna sledge.
The energy consumption of the motors during one
position search is 3.0 V * 0.12 A * 30 * 0.0043 s =
0.046 Ws. This can be compared to a typical battery
configuration with two pieces of
CR123A Lithium
primary batteries containing 9.0 Wh or 32400 Ws of
energy. The position optimisation procedure is usually
not a significant factor in the overall energy consump-
tion.
Instead, the key question when designing a ZigBee
radio network is the co-operation mode between the
coordinator and the device of a star network. With the
beaconed mode, the device can be asleep until the
active period begins after a selected inactive period.
During the inactive period the device can be asleep and
only providing power to a low power real time clock.
The power consumption of e.g ZigBee devices is
nearly the same during a reception operation and a
transmission operation. If the beaconed mode is used
the energy consumption can be predicted quite well.
To reduce the energy consumption further the un-
beaconed mode can be selected instead. Now the de-
vice can be asleep until it detects itself new sensor data
to be reported, wakes up and performs a carrier sense
operation. If no other device in the network is transmit-
ting at that moment, the device can then send the sen-
sor report.
In the case the service however wants to receive
sensor reports on demand, a novel principle was intro-
duced in [2]. If the beaconed mode is used and the
inactive period is very long the coordinator cannot get
sensor reports according to the needs of the higher
system. Instead of keeping the device in the beaconed
mode with periodically turning on the receiver cir-
cuitry, the waking up of the device is now arranged via
an UV detector that has a negligible energy consump-
tion. The coordinator emits bursts of UV light to wake
up the device via an interrupt line of the sleeping mi-
croprocessor. This concept needs an optical path from
the coordinator to the device.
The Diversity Availability system presented in here
can run into problems in the energy consumption if
there is a lot of movement of shadowing objects in the
path between the coordinator and the device. When
using the 2.4 GHz band the wavelength is of the order
0.13 metres. From the Limits of Exposure to RF Radia-
tion we know that the human body is not especially
much absorbing RF energy in the exact 2.4 GHz band
in general. That is why an external power density of
10 W/m2 is accepted in Finland at this band. However,
the used frequency is indeed used for heating food in
microwave ovens. The heat is produced by the vibra-
tion of the various dipoles of the molecules in the EM
field. There is no sharp absorption band for the water
molecule in this band against the common assumption
and e.g. also 915 MHz is used for heating food.
Therefore the presence of a human body close to the
device in between the coordinator and the device can
be seen as a normal shadowing case. When the dimen-
sion of the body is of the order twice the wavelength,
the scattering cross section of the body is remarkable,
or approx. 0.3 – 1 times the body dimension. When
seen from the wave penetration point of view, the skin
depth of a 2.4 GHz plane wave into the muscles and
organs of a typical human body is close to 1 cm. This
means that severe shadowing is experienced when a
human is standing close to a ZigBee device.
The effect to the energy consumption is dependent
on the frequency of the human movement related to the
antenna position optimisation cycle. Because many
RSS measurements are needed for each optimisation
cycle, the cycle lasts at least 20 seconds. The cycle
should be started only when shadowing has been ob-
served for at least 20 seconds. The worst case would
then be that the human changes the position in front of
the device slightly every 40 seconds. A remarkable
negative effect to the operational time would be ob-
served if 20% of the battery energy would have been
consumed to the mere continuous optimisation of the
position of the antenna sledge. The dominating factor

431
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
would be the need to keep the receiver on during the
optimisations, not the energy used by the motors. The
continuous receiver-on status would consume 20% of
our battery energy in just 3 hours. This should clearly
be taken into account when selecting the position of the
sensors at homes.
To optimise the overall combination of the data
transmission quality and energy consumption in a star
network one should analyse the needs of the higher
system using the services of the sensor network. The
energy consumption coming from the active usage of
the receiver circuitry is important in the overall energy
consumption [16]. The power consumption of the ex-
ample transceiver IC, Atmel AT86RF230 is 46 mW
when the receiver is on and the transmitter is off. The
difference between the power consumptions at the RF
output powers +3dBm and -17 dBm ( the whole range
that can be controlled by sw ) is in comparison only 21
mW.
The key question is how often does the higher sys-
tem need new sensor data. If sensor data updates are
needed at any moment according to the demand, long
periods of inactive time cannot be realised in the bea-
coned mode. The inactive period must be set to a lower
value than the maximum permissible delivery time for
a sensor data report. An alternative to this is to use an
optical turn-on activation principle together with un-
beaconed mode for the receiver, presented in [2] with
an erratum in [1]. This principle minimises the time
with receiver on.
When active, the IC can usually provide functions
that can be used to minimise the used energy. The main
functions are the RSSI measurement, the ED ( Energy
Detection ) calculation and the LQI ( Link Quality
Indicator ) calculation. RSSI indicates the received
power of an individual data frame. The ED calculates
an average of several RSSIs. These are related to the
received power only. The LQI studies what the esti-
mate for the PER ( Packet Error Rate ) is from ana-
logue parameters. The LQI then takes into account also
errors generated by possible RF interferers. The higher
the PER is, the more often we must retransmit the data,
consuming energy in the process. When the LQI shows
150, the PER is around 0.1 and when LQI is 220, the
PER is already negligibly small.
The DA functionality can be used to achieve the best
possible energy consumption in a given geometrical
configuration and multipath and interference environ-
ment. If the radio channel is selected first out of the 16
alternatives so that the LQI is maximised we have
avoided the interferers, including our own sensors, as
much as possible. After this, the DA function can be
used to find the best position for the antenna inside of
the sensor device. After that, the LQI can be used to
drop the transmit power until the PER is still accept-
able together with the retransmission rate following
from it.
XIII.
CONCLUSIONS FOR THE PROTOTYPE
MEASUREMENTS
The capability of the Diversity Adaptability func-
tion to increase the received signal power was verified
by measurements. The DA unit won extra link margin
for home care and other similar applications where the
position of the receiver cannot be chosen at the level of
+17 dB. If the sharply shaped space with high fading
would have had even deeper fading, even more benefit
could be possible. Here the depth of the fade was lim-
ited by the characteristics of the anechoic chamber.
The observed new minimum at the directional pat-
tern requires some examination. The coaxial cable
from the Dresden RCB runs in a horizontal position
beside the Yaego antenna element. The incoming field
was amplified less than with other angles, when the
first motor was at an angle of 195 degrees from the Tx-
antenna line. The starting angle of the first motor be-
fore rotation was +70 degrees. The horizontal coaxial
cable started from the angle +30 degrees. It was at 155
degrees when the minimum was detected.
The interaction with both the horizontal coaxial cable
and the first motor caused a strong deformation to the
angular response. The direction to the transmitter an-
tenna was 180 degrees when related to the set null of
the rotation experiment. There was deformation of the
field due to the shield of the coaxial cable whose po-
tential is close to the potential of the reference electri-
cal ground and which was now in the path between the
transmitter and the receiver antennas.
The second motor was respectively first situated at
-60 degrees from the Rx antenna element. It was be-
tween the Tx and the Rx antenna elements at the rota-
tion angle of 240 degrees. The angular gain of the
antenna construction was however good ( RSSI = -58
dBm ) in this case, at the rotation angle of 240 degrees.
The mentioned angles take into account the fact that
the Yaego element was not in the middle of the printed
circuit board of the antenna element.
The horizontal coaxial cable is the main cause for the
drop in sensitivity at the rotation angle of 125 degrees,
corresponding to the measurement angle no 26 on the
diagram. A motor alone did not remarkably disturb the
field. The diameter of the motors is only of the order 7
mm.
To overcome this side effect, the coaxial cable
should be led through the centre of the sledge when
designing an operational product. We concluded that
when this principle is applied, the observed gain mini-
mum will disappear. To verify this postulation, we

432
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
selected later, after the chamber measurements an open
field with low ground conductivity to test a modified
device. Because the RSSI function of the radio does
not work with powers lower than -91 dBm and the
notch detected at the rotation angle 125 degrees was 20
dB deep, we selected 7.0 meters to be the antenna
distance in the field test. The free space power ex-
pected with this arrangement is -69 dBm overall and
-89 dBm at the rotation angle of 125 degrees.
The measured power was -65 dBm indicating some
reflections from the ground. The receiver was again
rotated to find the notch angle. The notch was found at
the expected angle and the depth of the notch was now
18 dB.
The receiver was now modified so that the coaxial
cable comes to the antenna unit directly from the down
direction. The receiver was again installed on the field
and it was rotated to find out if the notch was still exis-
tent. The lowest detected power was now - 73 dBm
instead of the -83 dBm with the coaxial cable oriented
horizontally. The received power was still around the
level -65 dBm at most of the angles indicating the
performance of the antenna unit was now the same but
more even than before the modification.
The hysteresis experienced with the back reflector
arrangement suggests that very local and deep fades
might not be very common in practical situations.
Also another phenomenon could at least theoretically
reduce the number of situations where DA would be
mandatory in practical systems. This phenomenon is
the limited cross-polarisation ratio CPR of commonly
used antennas. CPR is the gain of the cross-polarised
component divided by the gain of the copolarised
component /15/. For a short vertical dipole the CPR is
larger ( less perfect ) at large elevation angles than at
small angles. The CPR ranges commonly around -20
… -10 dB and is caused especially by the physical
thickness and slight mechanical errors of the construc-
tions. After polarisation changes due to interaction
with conductive obstacles in the apartment a part of the
signal will leak into the receiver antenna also via the
polarisation that was not the original design criteria for
the antenna.
To study the level of probability that a DA receiver
would be mandatory in apartments a large simulation
set up could be arranged. Another possibility would be
to compare conventional and DA receivers in a real
and demanding multipath environment.
