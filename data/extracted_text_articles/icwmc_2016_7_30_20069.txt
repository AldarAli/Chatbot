Abstract—The wireless relay communication mobile radio 
system will be considered in this article. This system has two 
sections. The desired signal in both sections is subjected to κ-µ 
short- term fading. The outage probability is calculated for two 
cases. For the first case, the outage probability is defined as 
probability that the signal envelope in any sections falls below 
the specified threshold. For the second case, the outage 
probability is defined as probability that output signal 
envelope falls below the determined threshold. The influence of 
the Rician κ factor and multipath fading severity parameter on 
the outage probability is analyzed for both cases. 
Keywords-κ-µ distribution; cumulative distribution function; 
probability density function; outage probability

 INTRODUCTION 
In this article, the wireless communication relay system 
operating over κ-µ multipath fading environment is 
considered. The relay system has two sections. The κ-µ 
distribution describes signal envelopes in channels with 
dominant components [1] [2]. 
The κ-µ distribution is characterized by two parameters 
[3]. The parameter κ is Rician factor, which is defined as the 
ratio of dominant component power and scattering 
components power. The parameter µ is related to the number 
of clusters in propagation channel. The κ-µ small scale 
fading is more severe for less values of parameter µ. Also, 
the κ-µ multipath fading is more severe for lesser value of 
dominant component power and higher values of scattered 
components power. The κ-µ distribution is general 
distribution from which Rayleigh, Rician and Nakagami-m 
distribution can be derived [4]. The κ-µ distribution reduces 
to Nakagami-m distribution for κ=0, to Rician distribution 
for µ=1, and to Rayleigh distribution for κ=0 and µ=1. When 
Rician factor goes to infinity, κ-µ multipath fading channel 
becomes no fading channel. Also, when parameter µ goes to 
infinity, there is no fading in the channel [5]. 
There are two ways to define the outage probability in 
wireless relay systems. One way to define the outage 
probability is as a probability that signal level at any section 
falls below of the determined threshold.  In this case, the 
outage probability can be calculated from cumulative 
distribution function of the minimum of the signal envelope 
at sections of wireless communication system. In the second 
definition, the outage probability can be calculated as 
probability that signal envelope at output of wireless relay 
communication system falls below the determined threshold. 
For this case, the outage probability can be calculated as 
cumulative distribution function of product of two κ-µ 
distributions [6]. 
  There are some works in technical literature dealing 
with performance analysis of wireless relay communication 
systems in the presence of multipath fading [7]-[14]. Beside, 
several papers treated minimum, product and ratio of random 
variables and how they could be applied in performance 
analysis of relay communication systems [13] [14]. Since the 
distribution of random variables is of interest in wireless 
communications, the probability density functions of 
minimum of ratios of Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, 
Weibull and α-µ random variables are derived in [13]. These 
formulas are used for studying the outage probability in 
multi-hop systems working over fading channels in the 
presence of cochannel interference. The general, closed-form 
expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and 
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the ratio of the 
products of two independent α-μ variables are presented in 
[14]. The obtained solutions are applicable in analysis of 
multihop wireless communication systems in the presence of 
different fading. 
According to the authors' knowledge, relay radio system 
in the presence of κ-µ short-term fading in the first and the 
second sections is not processed in publicly available 
literature. Consequently, such system is analyzed in this 
work. The Rician factor and fading severity parameter are 
the same for both sections. In this paper, probability density 
function and cumulative distribution function of minimum of 
two κ-µ random variables are determined. The cumulative 
distribution function is the outage probability of the proposed 
wireless relay system. Furthermore, PDF and CDF of 
product of two κ-µ random variables are evaluated and also 
the outage probability of proposed system can be calculated 
from cumulative distribution function. The signal envelope at 
output of considered relay system can be evaluated as 
product of two κ-µ random variables. The results obtained 
here can be applied in performance analysis and design of 
relay radio systems working over κ-µ multipath fading 
channels. 
This article consists of five sections. After an 
introduction to the topic and description of the works in the 
field, in the second section, the probability density function 
and cumulative distribution function of minimum of two κ-µ 
random variables are performed. Then, in third section, PDF 
and CDF of product of two κ-µ random variables are carried

In wireless relay system, the outage probability can be 
defined in two different ways, as it is described above. When 
the signal level at any section falls under the defined 
threshold, the outage probability can be calculated from 
cumulative distribution function of the minimum of the 
signal envelopes at sections of wireless communication 
system.

Cumulative distribution function of minimum of two κ-µ 
random variables is the outage probability of wireless relay 
communication system with two sections over κ-µ multipath 
fading channel.

PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION AND CUMULATIVE 
DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION OF PRODUCT OF TWO Κ-µ RANDOM 
VARIABLES 
By the second definition, the outage probability of 
wireless relay system can be calculated as probability that 
signal 
envelope 
at 
the 
output 
of 
wireless 
relay 
communication system lessens below the predetermined 
threshold. For this case, the outage probability can be 
calculated as cumulative distribution function of product of 
two κ-µ distributed signals.

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The cumulative distribution function of minimum of two 
κ-µ random variables versus signal envelope is presented in 
Fig. 1. The CDF is plotted for μ1=μ2=2 and variable 
parameters κ1 and κ2. It is visible that CDF increases with 
increasing of the signal envelope. The cumulative 
distribution function decreases for larger values of Rician 
factor κ1. Also, one can see from Fig. 1 that CDF is bigger 
for higher values of Rician factor κ2.    
The cumulative distribution function of product of two κ-
µ random variables depending on the signal envelope is 
presented in Fig. 2. The parameters μ1 and μ2 are equal to 
each other and have a value of 2. It is possible to see from 
Fig. 2 that CDF becomes bigger with increasing of the signal 
envelope. Fig. 2 shows that CDF is less for higher values of 
Rician factors κ1 and κ2. 
The system performance is better for smaller values of 
the outage probability, i.e., cumulative distribution function. 
This can be achieved by increasing the Ricean factors κ1 and 
κ2.

random variables.

random variables. 
 
Since Rician factor is the ratio of dominant component 
power and scattering components power, it is evident that 
bigger dominant component powers and smaller scattering 
components give better system performance.   
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this article, the communication relay radio system with 
two sections is analyzed. Both sections are exposed to κ-µ 
multipath fading.  
The outage probability is defined in two ways. For the 
first, the outage probability is probability that signal 
envelope at one of sections becomes less than the specified 
threshold. The outage probability for this case can be 
calculated as a CDF of minimum of signal envelopes from 
both sections. The outage probability is calculated in the 
closed form. The influence of Rician κ factors on the outage 
probability is then analyzed.  
For the second way, the outage probability is presented 
as probability that communication relay system output signal 
envelope drops below the defined threshold. The outage 
probability for this case is equal to the CDF of product of 
signal envelopes at sections. The fading parameters influence 
on the outage probability is described also.  
The obtained formulas for the outage probability for 
relay (κ-µ)-(κ-µ) channels could be used for calculation the 
outage probability of other relay channels. For κ1=0 and 
κ2=0, (κ-µ)-(κ-µ) relay channel reduces to Nakagami- 
Nakagami relay channel; for µ1=1 and µ2=1, (κ-µ), (κ-µ) 
distribution becomes Rician-Rician channel [18]. Because of 
that, this article has general importance.  
Results of this analysis can be used by designers of relay 
systems in terms of the presence of fading with the κ-µ 
distribution. The designers of these systems can choose 
optimal parameters for given value of the outage probability. 
Because of the generality of the results, the presence of other 
types of fading can also be covered with this investigation.  
In our further work, the other system characteristics can 
be determined. Further, the outage probability for relay radio 
system with three sections can be derived. Besides, the 
performance for similar relay systems in the presence of 
other small-scale general fading distributions, such as α-µ, α-
η-μ, or α-λ-μ, can be calculated too.
