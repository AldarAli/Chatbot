Abstract—In this paper, we study a flexible routing strategy for 
demand protection and a corresponding optimization problem 
for networks that permanently experience fluctuations of the 
capacity available on their links. This is an important and 
novel topic as limited link availability is a fundamental feature 
of wireless networks; yet majority of work in survivable 
network design is restricted to total failures of single links. 
Hence, protection against partial failures of multiple links is 
considered as congestion avoidance. We assume a given finite 
set of network states. Each state is characterized by a vector of 
link availability coefficients specifying, for each link, the 
fraction of its nominal (maximum) capacity available in this 
state, and by a traffic coefficients vector specifying, for each 
demand, the proportion of its nominal traffic to be realized in 
the considered state. Our routing strategy allows for 
adjustment (thinning or thickening) of the reference path-
flows. For a given nominal value x of a path-flow, its 
thickening is limited to x where  is a given constant greater 
than or equal to 1. Thus, in each state, the value of every path-
flow can range from 0 to   times its reference value. It turns 
out that the corresponding link cost minimization problem 
(where link capacities and state-dependant path-flows are 
decision variables) is NP-hard. We present a non-compact 
linear programming formulation of the problem together with 
a solution algorithm based on path generation. We illustrate 
the effectiveness of the introduced routing strategy by 
presenting numerical results for a set of representative 
network examples.

 INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we study a routing strategy for demand 
protection called Flow-Adjustment Routing (FAR) together 
with the corresponding network optimization problem. FAR 
aims at protecting traffic demands against Multiple Partial 
Link Failures (MPLF) by appropriate adjustment of the 
reference (nominal) path-flows. Strictly speaking, FAR is 
not a rerouting strategy because no paths can be created to 
restore the affected flows. Instead, the nominal path-flows 
are thinned or thickened according to the current state of the 
links. To account for MPLF, we consider a nominal state 
and a set of link availability states   (containing the nominal 
state) and a finite set A fractional numbers. For each link e ∈ 
E and each availability state  ∈  , the corresponding link 
availability coefficient     ∈ A specifies the fraction of the 
nominal capacity of link e that is available in state s 
(        . FAR assumes that the nominal path-flows 
(i.e., path-flows defined for the nominal state with all links 
fully available) can be thinned or thickened to adapt to 
capacity fluctuations but not restored on paths not used in 
the nominal state. On top of this, we assume that the 
demand volumes to be realized in the availability states 
different from the nominal state are possibly reduced as 
compared to the nominal traffic. In the following, we use 
the 
terms 
availability 
states 
and 
failure 
states 
interchangeably. 
For the so-specified setting, we study the corresponding 
optimization problem referred to as Flow-Adjustment 
Problem (FAP). FAP aims at minimizing the cost of links 
under the following constraints: (i) the nominal path-flows 
and the state-dependent path-flows satisfy the nominal and 
the 
state-dependent 
traffic 
demand 
requirement, 
respectively, (ii) path-flows obey the maximum thickening 
assumption of the protection strategy, and (iii) for each link 
and each availability state, the link load does not exceed the 
currently available link capacity. As FAP is NP-hard 
(because a special case of FAP shown to be NP-Hard is 
studied 
by 
Tomaszewski 
et 
al. 
[13]), 
its 
Linear 
Programming (LP) formulations (see Section III) are 
unavoidably non-compact and require path generation to be 
solved to optimality. For generating paths we need to apply 
a mixed-integer pricing problem—here the difficulty of FAP 
is manifested. 
The introduced model is original. In fact, not much work 
has been done in survivable network optimization under the 
MPLF assumption. To the best of our knowledge, only the 
so called global rerouting (restoring flows from scratch in 
surviving capacity) has been studied in this context [1] – a 
strategy quite impractical in the considered wireless 
framework. It happens that multiple failures have so far 
been considered in survivable network design almost always 
(i.e., besides global rerouting) assuming total link failures 
(  
 ∈ {   }). The work done here is substantial (again, see 
[1][5] and the references therein) but this case is, 
unfortunately, not relevant for our framework.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next 
section, we give motivation behind the considered flow-
adjustment strategy. In Section III, we introduce the 
notation and formulate the basic FAP model. Section IV 
describes a path generation algorithm necessary to find 
optimal solutions for FAP. In Section V, we present results

of a numerical study that illustrates a potential value of the 
considered protection strategy in terms of the cost of the 
resulting network in comparison with global rerouting. In 
Section VI, we present the performance of the restoration 
process using simulations. Finally, in Section VII, we 
present concluding remarks. 
II. 
 FLOW ADJUSTMENT- A SIMPLE PROTECTION 
STRATEGY FOR MULTIPLE PARTIAL FAILURES 
The flow-adjustment routing strategy for MPLF 
proposed in this paper extends the Flow Thinning Routing 
strategy (FTR) presented in [2][3]. Both FTR and FAR are 
inspired by the idea of Elastic Rerouting (ER) presented in 
[4] and Path Diversity Protection (PDP) [1], [5]. We recall 
that both ER and PDP assume total link failures, i.e., failure 
scenarios which admit only binary vectors   
  characterizing 
the availability states (referred to as the failure states in this 
case) in   (i.e., A = {0,1}), that is, when links fail, then their 
entire capacity is lost. PDP is a protection strategy where in 
a failure state  ∈   path-flows through the failing links are 
simply disconnected, and the surviving path-flows must be 
sufficient to realize the demand volumes, possibly decreased 
with respect to nominal demand volumes. ER allows for 
decreasing the flows of unaffected demands, as well as for 
increasing (to a certain threshold) path-flows of affected 
demands. 
In this paper, we follow the concept of ER, but no 
distinction will be made between unaffected and affected 
demands. Hence, our strategy is allowed to thin or thick the 
nominal path-flow on any routing path. Thus, FAR assumes 
that each demand is in general routed over several paths, not 
necessarily disjoint, with over-dimensioned nominal path-
flows to ensure an assumed level of demand survivability. 
Contrary to conventional end-to-end restoration strategies, 
no flow is rerouted to recover from a failure. In fact, it 
seems that allowing only for thinning makes the resulting 
protection 
strategy 
less 
complicated 
for 
network 
implementations. Our strategy is an extension of FTR in 
which the path-flows are allowed only to be decreased. 
Instead, FAR admits both thinning and thickening allowing 
for less costly networks as compared with FTR. Yet, FAR 
and FTR are similar from the mathematical modeling point 
of view, especially the mixed-integer pricing problem. 
To clarify the idea of how FAR works, we wish to 
emphasize a few points. First, note that a common pool of 
link capacities is used for the nominal path-flows and in the 
remaining availability states. Hence, the selected routing 
paths carrying the flows are dimensioned so that the total 
traffic realized by the demand’s path-flows could in general 
be greater than the nominal traffic. The most important 
feature of FAR is handling partial failures without any flow 
rerouting at all. In other words, no paths besides the nominal 
paths are used for handling other availability states. 
Therefore, the proposed approach results in using a sort of 
limited dynamic routing, adapted to the network states. To 
summarize, for each demand there is a fixed set of nominal 
routing paths carrying nominal flows. In an availability state 
in general only a part of the total nominal demand flow will 
be realized on these paths, depending on the available 
capacity and the required demand restoration ratio. 
Consequently, the restoration will be practically done by 
thickening some of the path-flows, and no new (re)routing 
paths are allowed. 
III. 
FAP: FLOW-ADJUSTMENT PROBLEM  
The basic problem considered in this paper is referred to 
as FAP and is as follows. We minimize the cost of link 
capacity assuming that in the nominal state of network 
operation all demand volumes are realized by means of 
(nominal) path-flows. When the network is subject to a 
failure from a given set of failure states (we assume that a 
failure state consists of partial failures of multiple links) 
then the demand volumes, possibly reduced, are realized for 
the duration of the failure state by appropriate thinning or 
thickening of the nominal flows. The detailed formulation of 
FAP will be given in Subsection III-B. 
A. Notation 
The considered network is modeled using a graph 
 (    , undirected or directed, composed of a set of nodes 
  and a set of links  . In the sequel, we will always 
consider directed graphs unless stated explicitly otherwise. 
Thus, each link  ∈   represents a directed pair (     of 
some nodes    ∈  , and is assigned a non-negative unit 
capacity cost    which is a parameter, and a capacity 
reservation    which is an optimization variable. The cost of 
the network is given by the quantity  ∑
 ∈   
  . The 
demands are represented by the set  . Each demand  ∈   
is associated with a directed pair of nodes (end-nodes of  ) 
(  (  ;  (  ) for some  (    (  ∈  ; a volume   
  (a 
parameter) has to be sent from  (   to  (  (demand 
volumes and link capacities are expressed in the same 
units). Also, each demand   is assigned a set of admissible 
paths    composed of selected elementary paths from  (   
to  (   in graph  . (Recall that an elementary path does not 
traverse any node more than once.) Paths from    are used 
to realize the demand volume   
  by means of path-flows 
   
   ∈   , which are optimization variables. 
The given sets of admissible paths define the link-path 
incidence coefficients       ∈    ∈    ∈   , where 
       if path  ∈    traverses link  ∈   (i.e., if  ∈  , 
treating the paths as subsets of links:   ), and        if 
path  ∈    does not traverse link  . It is important to note 
that the sets of admissible paths     ∈  , are parameters 
in the FAP problem formulation considered in the sequel, 
although in general it assumes that all possible elementary 
paths can potentially be used if this is required to reach the 
optimum. 
Network links are subject to (partial) failures. The 
failure-less state (with all links fully available) is called the 
nominal state and is denoted by 0, and the flows    
   ∈

are referred to as nominal flows. The set of failure states is 
denoted by   (we call set   the failure scenario). Each 
failure state  ∈   is specified by a vector of link 
availability ratios    (     ∈   , where         for 
 ∈  . The link capacity available in state   is assumed to be 
equal to      . Hence,     is the fraction of capacity    that 
survives in state  . Certainly, in state 0 all the ratios   
  are 
equal to 1. In general, in a failure state more than one link 
can have its availability ratio less that 1 so in fact we are 
considering multiple partial failures of the network links. 
When a failure state  ∈   affects the network, in general 
not all the nominal flows    
   ∈    ∈    can be realized 
anymore as the available link capacity is decreased. It is 
assumed that the demand volumes to be realized in state 
 ∈   can be decreased, to values   
   ∈  . The demand 
volumes assumed for a failure state must be realized by 
means of the nominal flows that are appropriately thinned 
(decreased) or thickened (increased) so to fit to the reduced 
link capacity. The thinned nominal flows for state  ∈   are 
denoted by    
   ∈    ∈   . These flows are allocated to 
the admissible paths for the duration of the failure state. The 
state-dependent 
flows
   
   ∈    ∈    ∈   
 are 
optimization variables. The relation, for each demand  ∈
 , is defined by a given demand-dependent flow control 
factor   , where     . Note that when    = 1, then, the 
reference path-flows of demand   can only be thinned. Still, 
when     , they can be as well thickened, but only up to 
the factor    so that,    
       
   ∈    ∈    ∈   . 
B. Formulation of FAP 
FAP assumes that in each failure state  ∈  , only a part 
  
  of the nominal volume   
  has to be realized for each 
demand  ∈  . This is achieved by thinning or thickening 
the nominal flows    
  to values    
   ( ∈     so that the 
links capacities   
     ∈   available in state   are not 
exceeded. For given sets of admissible paths     ∈  , 
problem FAP can be represented by the following path-flow 
linear programming (LP) formulation involving variables 
   
  ( ∈    ∈

In the formulation, the quantities in brackets on the left-
hand sides are dual variables associated with the constraints 
(see Section I.2.2 in [5]). All these variables are, by 
assumption, nonnegative. Objective (1a) minimizes the total 
cost of links. Constraint (1b) makes sure that for each 
demand its paths have jointly sufficient capacity to satisfy 
the demand volume assumed for the nominal state. 
Constraint (1c) does not allow the nominal link loads to 
exceed the nominal link capacities. Next, constraint (1d) 
assures that in each failure state  ∈  , the adjusted flows 
are sufficient to realize the (possibly reduced) volume of 
each demand  ∈  . Then, constraint (1e) makes sure that 
in each state  ∈  , the surviving capacity of each link 
 ∈    is not exceeded. Finally, constraint (1f) relates the 
state-dependent path-flows to the reference flows.  
IV. 
PATH GENERATION 
Formulation (1) is a link-path LP formulation. It is non-
compact because of exponentially many path-flow variables 
  as we potentially consider all possible paths in the 
admissible path-sets     ∈  .  
Thus, in order to consider all possible routing paths in 
graph  (     in FAP, we need to apply the technique of 
linear programming known as column generation [7], [8], 
called Path Generation (PG) in our context. With PG, 
starting from some initial path-sets     ∈  , we generate 
new paths (corresponding to variables/columns    
   ∈
   ∈    and    
   ∈    ∈    ∈   ), and iteratively 
add them to the path-sets. As discussed below, this is done 
by solving an appropriate pricing problem using, as 
parameters, 
optimal 
dual 
variables 
associated 
with 
constraints (1b)-(1f), i.e., an optimal solution          of 
the problem dual to FAP formulated in the next subsection.

[1]):

Let  (   denote the problem defined by (2) for a given

Essentially, path generation is related to the so called dual 
separation problem. The problem consists in trying to find, 
for each demand  ∈  , a path  (   between  (   and  (   
such that adding the constraints (2c)-(2d) for  (   to 
formulation (2) makes the current optimal solution of  (    
infeasible for  (  { (  }   (see for example [1]). If there 
is no demand for which a path exists, then the current set   
is sufficient to find the optimum of FAP admitting all

possible admissible paths. The problem of finding paths 
 (    ∈   is called the pricing problem. 
B. Pricing problem 
Suppose       form an optimal solution of the dual 
problem  (   defined by (2). Then, to be sure that   and   
form an optimal solution also for the dual problem with all 
possible paths, we need to check whether for each demand 
 ∈  , and for each path   in graph  (     between the 
nodes  (   and  (  , there exist nonnegative numbers 
    ∈   such that: 
   ∑
   
 ∈

                         (   
      | |   ∈

Above, 
| |  ∑

 and 
| |  ∑
 ∈    
  ∈   
denote the state-dependent dual length of path   (note that 
to simplify the notation we do not use the link-path 
incidence coefficients     here). 
Certainly, for all paths  ∈    the above inequalities 
fulfilled by       
  are a part of the considered optimal 
solution of (2). So the question now is how to find a path q 
outside the assumed set   , if any, for which inequalities (3) 
are infeasible with respect to variables     ∈  . In fact, in 
path generation it is advantageous (to speed up the PG 
algorithm, see Subsection III-D) to find, for each  ∈  , not 
only a path (if any) in  ̂  that just separates the current dual 
solution    , but rather a path  ∈  ̂  for which the dual 
constraints (2c) and (2d) are maximally violated by the 
considered dual solution     (see [7], [8], [9]). This is 
especially true when finding such a path is not substantially 
more complex than finding an arbitrary path that violates the 
dual constraints. In our setting, the (negative) measure of 
violation of the dual constraints corresponding to path   is 
equal to 
‖ ‖  (   | |  ∑
| | 
 ∈  
)  (      ∑

)
(   
provided it is negative. The quantity ‖ ‖, is referred to as 
the generalized dual length of path q. Thus, the pricing 
problem for demand  ∈   can be specified as:

‖ ‖
                                    (   
The so-formulated pricing problem (6) is difficult because 
of the particular form of the dual length ‖ ‖. Nevertheless, 
the problem can be stated as a binary program using 
formulation (7). In the formulation, binary variables 
    ∈  , specify the path   we are looking for:   
{ ∈       }. Binary variables     ∈    in turn, identify 
the set    corresponding to the so defined path

equal to 1 when the length, with respect to   , of the path

C. Path Generation algorithm 
The path generation algorithm for FAP is as follows:

Define initial feasible path-sets     ∈  . 
Step 2: Solving 
Solve the dual problem  (   given by (2) to

Step 3: Update 
For each  ∈   solve the pricing problem (7). If 
the optimal objective L is negative, then add the 
resulting path q to the path-sets   . If for any 
demand no new path has been added then stop: the 
resulting path-sets are sufficient to solve FAP to 
optimality. Otherwise, go to Step 2.

In the following subsections, we will compare the 
Global Rerouting strategy (GR), the FTR strategy, and the 
FAR strategy in terms of cost-effectiveness. Recall that in a 
non-nominal link availability state, GR is allowed to restore 
flows for all demands in the available capacity from scratch, 
and that FTR is equivalent to FAR with    . For the 
experiments reported in this section, we assume a uniform 
availability ratio   for all the affected links in a given 
availability state, i.e.,       for all  ∈   and  ∈    (where 
   denotes the subset of links affected in state s), and 
        ∈    ∈     . Also, we assume the demand 
satisfaction ratio    , i.e.,   
     
    
  for all  ∈   
and  ∈ . In the comparisons,

FAR (respectively, the network cost for FTR and GR) with

A. Minimum network cost for single partial link failures 
We first consider the single partial link failures, as a 
reference to compare FAR with other rerouting strategies. 
We assume that each link can fail but one at a time, and 
when it fails its availability ratio is equal to  . Hence, the 
availability states can be identified with the links. In Figures 
2-5, we present GapFA and GapGR as a function of   for 
19 selected cases, varying   from 95% to 5%.

As illustrated by Figures 2 to 5, the overall cost of the 
network obtained when allowing thickening is substantially 
lower than that obtained using flow-thinning only, and this 
remains true for all considered availability scenarios and all 
networks. 
It turns out that network topology and demand density 
characteristics have a significant impact on the efficiency of 
the flow-adjustment routing strategy. Net_10 and Net_14 
have a high number of demands compared to their number 
of nodes (Net_10 has a full traffic matrix and Net_14 has a 
full undirected traffic matrix). For these networks the link 
cost optimized for FAR is close to the cost optimized for 
GR already for relatively low values of parameter   (1.75 to 
2). In contrast, Net_11 and Net_17 have a limited number of 
demands compared to their number of nodes and the optimal 
network cost for FAR requires a high value of parameter   
to meet the results of GR. We finally notice that for a sparse 
network with a high number of demands (as Net_17), 
allowing path thickening has a limited impact on the 
network cost for    . 
B. Minimum network cost for single partial node failures 
We now consider single partial node failures (each node 
can fail but one at a time). This kind of failures represents a 
local perturbation in a network affecting several links at the 
same time. In this case, the availability states correspond to 
the nodes, and the link capacities in a failure state   are 
given by     if e is incident to the failing node, and to    
otherwise. In Figures 6-9, we present GapFA and GapGR as

a function of   for 19 selected cases, varying   from 95% to 
5%. 
We notice that the graphs have similar shapes for all the 
considered networks. Indeed, the gain in the network cost 
using the flow-adjustment strategy increases until a certain 
threshold (which seems not to be dependent on the value of 
 ), and next decreases to 0% for full node failures ( =5%.) 
This shows that the flow-thinning strategy remains efficient 
for node failures for the extreme cases as sufficiently low or 
high perturbation levels. However, the gap between these 
two strategies and the global rerouting strategy is significant 
and reaches 80% to 90%, depending on the network, for a 
low availability ratio  =5%. (Recall that for     , the 
network cost for FAR converges to that of GR.)

Observe that whereas sparse networks (as Net_14 and 
Net_17) display a decrease of the network cost from 8% to 
10% with     (compared to flow-thinning), dense 
networks (as Net_11) have a limited decrease of the cost 
(maximum 5%). In fully meshed networks (as Net_10), it is 
virtually impossible to improve the network cost—the gain 
is less than 1%. However, further investigations are required 
to analyze this effect. 
C. Range of the perturbation 
Finally, we study the range of the perturbation, i.e., the 
number of paths which have their flow adjusted when a 
failure occurs. 
We have two routing paths update processes: thinning 
and thickening. Figures 10-11 show the average number of 
paths that will have their flow adjusted, for all failure states 
with a fixed capacity availability ratio   set to 50% for 
single link failures (Figure 10) and for single node failures 
(Figure 11). In these figures, the percentage of paths which 
has to be thinned (resp. thickened) is represented in solid 
(resp. dashed) bars.  
The figures show that FAR requires modifying flows on 
almost every path when a failure occurs. The percentage of 
“thickening operations” depends on the value of   and 
exhibits a similar behavior for all networks.

Figure 12 displays the number of distinct paths used by 
the other strategies: FTR and GR. We first notice that FTR 
requires less paths than FAR, and the gap increases with  . 
Now we compare the number of paths used by FAR and 
GR. When   is low, FAR requires less paths than GR. The 
difference decreases for higher values of   , and for    , 
for all networks, GR uses less paths than FAR to achieve an 
optimal solution. This is mainly due to the fact that FAR 
uses paths with very low value in the nominal state to be 
able to increase them in a failure state. In regard to 
scalability and management cost, the above observations 
suggest that FAR should be used with small values of  . 
Another way to limit the number of paths per demand used 
by this scheme is to modify the formulation (1) by adding 
specific constraints restricting the number of routing paths 
per demand, (which would surely have an extra 
computational cost). 
VI. 
FAILURE RECOVERY PROCESS 
The main interest in the flow-thinning strategy stems 
from the simplicity of the path-flow handling process. 
Indeed, the reaction to a particular availability state 
basically consists in decreasing the flow on (some of) the 
perturbed paths. In the following, we assume that a 
signaling protocol sends a message from the end nodes of a 
link to the source nodes of the paths passing through this 
link when its capacity decreases and reaches a certain 
threshold. Hence, the time required to recover from a failure 
state is equal to the time required for the signaling messages 
to traverse the longest path from the end nodes of the 
perturbed links to the source node of the disturbed demands. 
In the following, we study the FAR restoration process. 
A. Simulation of the FAR flow adjustment process 
The flow adjustment process in FAR is not as simple as 
in FTR. This process is composed of two simultaneous 
stages managed by the source and the destination of the 
traffic demands [12]. The source nodes of the demands will 
first decrease the flow of some concerned paths, in order to 
make room for enlarging the flows on some other paths. 
Next, the destination nodes can increase the flow of the 
latter paths. Finally, we do not ensure full synchronization 
as this can be time consuming; hence, some routing paths 
may need a certain time to become fully operational. This 
will depend on the number of paths to restore, and on the 
quantity of flow required to be added to these paths. 
B. Simulation results 
We study the evolution of the ratio of demands that is 
perturbed when a failure occurs, and the time required for 
complete restoration by doing a basic simulation. This 
simulation is called “basic” for 2 reasons: we first assume 
that the buffer size is not modified by the perturbation 
(which is not correct for TCP where a failure is managed 
using congestion-avoidance algorithm) and we also consider 
that the time to pass through any link is the same, equal to 1 
unit. 
Figure 13 reports the ratio of perturbed demands for a 
fixed link failure as a function of the time, for network 
Net_14 with      . With FAR there are about 20% of 
demands perturbed for this link failure situation. Then, the 
bandwidth of some paths is decreased to allow the 
bandwidth of some other paths to be increased. This leads to 
further demands to be temporarily perturbed with about 
55% of perturbed demands after 3 units of time. 
Nevertheless, the process converges very fast comparing to 
GR which reroutes all demands, perturbed or not.  
  
Figure 13.  Evolution of the ratio of perturbed demands for Net_14 (α=0,5). 
Finally, we notice that the ratio of perturbed demands 
remains too high compared to that with the flow-thinning 
strategy.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have studied flow adjustment routing—
a routing strategy for demand protection which allows for 
limited path-flow thickening on top of a commonly 
understood flow thinning mechanism. FAR is capable of 
handling multiple partial link failures that are observed in 
wireless 
networks 
or 
in 
upper 
layers 
of 
wired 
communication networks. FAR requires less capacity in the 
network as compared with a pure Flow-Thinning Strategy, 
and is cost-wise very close to Global Rerouting for some 
networks. Our computational results show that FAR 
achieves encouraging results in terms of the investment cost, 
at least for the sets of availability states consisting of partial 
single link failures or single node failures.  
We have noticed that the FAR restoration process affects 
a large number of path flows in the network and may lead to 
additional perturbation at the very beginning of the process if 
thinning and thickening operations are not coordinated. 
Hence, some non-perturbed demands may be affected for a 
short time when some bandwidth needs to be released from 
its paths. Making a distinction between paths of perturbed 
and non-perturbed demands could help to avoid this. On one 
hand, paths of non-perturbed demands should not be allowed 
to decrease their total flow more than their traffic 
requirement. On the other hand, paths of perturbed demands 
should be able to thin or thick their bandwidth. This leads to 
a restricted flow-adjustment routing strategy which is 
nothing else than an extension of the elastic robust rerouting 
strategy [11], with some constraints relaxed, applied to 
multiple partial link failures. Moreover, in its current form, 
FAR and FTR to a less degree, could require significant 
implementation effort as a large volume of paths are 
concerned and an important quantity of information is 
required to maintain all the connections at the routing nodes; 
this may impact the scalability of the strategy. These issues 
need further investigation and will be the subject of future 
work.
