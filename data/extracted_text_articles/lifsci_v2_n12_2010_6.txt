Abstract—The 
quality 
and 
sustainability 
of 
the 
healthcare system in Canada is dependent on the 
healthcare providers within it. If the system is to remain 
strong, it is critical that those who provide the services 
within it are strong and healthy. Unfortunately, 
downsizing in the Canadian healthcare system has led 
to extremely heavy workloads and high levels of 
burnout in healthcare providers, which not only affects 
their own health but also that of the patients they care 
for. In an attempt to provide support and resources for 
healthcare providers to improve their own health and 
well-being, the purpose of this project is to develop two 
online programs—one for physicians and medical 
students and one for other healthcare providers—that 
will (1) provide access to cutting-edge information 
related to health and wellness, (2) allow the users to 
evaluate their current fund of knowledge and health 
status and take action to improve it, and (3) direct the 
user to online and face-to-face resources and supports. 
The first step in the project involved identifying the 
needs of the target users for the two programs. This

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The content of this paper was first presented at 
the 2009 International Conference on Mobile, 
Hybrid, and On-line Learning, Cancun, Mexico [1].  
 
The quality and sustainability of the healthcare 
system in Canada is dependent on the healthcare 
providers within it. If the system is to remain strong, 
it is critical that those who provide the services 
within it are strong and healthy. Unfortunately, 
downsizing in the Canadian healthcare system has led 
to extremely heavy workloads for healthcare 
providers and high levels of burnout. One study 
showed that 46% of Canadian physicians are in 
advanced stages of burnout [2]. Another revealed 
that many new nurses are leaving their jobs within 
two years of graduation and have symptoms of 
burnout, depression, and emotional exhaustion [3]. 
Dyrbye et al. [4] found an association between 
burnout and an increased likelihood of suicidal 
ideation in medical students. These concerns 
resulting from burnout are not limited to the 
healthcare providers themselves; the well-being of 
healthcare providers can also impact patient care and 
satisfaction. Physician burnout has been associated 
with lower patient satisfaction outcomes and longer 
post-discharge recovery time. Further, more days are 
lost per worker each year in the health sector than for 
any other occupation in Canada [5]; the average 
number of days lost due to illness or disability is 
about double for workers in healthcare than in other 
sectors. The importance of improving the health of 
healthcare providers cannot be understated.  
 
According to the CanMEDS 2005 Physician 
Competency Framework, a key competency of 
physicians is to demonstrate a commitment to 
physician health and sustainable practice. This 
involves “balancing personal and professional 
priorities to ensure personal health and a sustainable 
practice; 
striving 
to 
heighten 
personal 
and 
professional awareness and insight; and recognising 
other professionals in need and respond[ing] 
appropriately”[6]. Through caring for themselves and 
their colleagues, physicians are able to demonstrate a 
commitment to their professional responsibilities [7] 
[8]. Not only is physicians’ health a health issue but 
also a professional one. 
 
In Canada, each province has its own provincial 
physician health program that provides support to

physicians and their families. Further, in efforts to 
improve medical student and physician health and 
wellness at the University of Ottawa, the Faculty of 
Medicine created Canada’s first Faculty Wellness 
Program in 2000. However, despite the efforts of 
these programs, many healthcare professionals and 
students seeking access to health and wellness 
resources and services are not able to access them or 
do not even know they exist. Clinicians and students 
are busy individuals and, due to time constraints and 
geographic location, many are not able to attend 
professional development programs that relate to 
health and well-being. Consequently, the purpose of 
this project is to develop two online programs—one 
for physicians and medical students that focuses on 
physician health and one for healthcare providers 
(including physicians) that focuses on workplace 
health—that will (1) provide access to cutting-edge 
information related to health and wellness, (2) allow 
the users to evaluate their current fund of knowledge 
and health status and take action to improve it, and 
(3) direct the user to online and face-to-face 
resources and supports. The first step in the project 
involved identifying the needs of the target users for 
the two programs. This paper summarises the 
findings from these needs assessments and provides 
recommendations 
for 
program 
design 
and 
development. 
II. METHODOLOGY 
 
In order to obtain multiple perspectives to inform 
the design and development of the programs, 
interviews were conducted with a sample of end-
users of the two programs: physicians and medical 
students for ePhysicianHealth.com and regulated 
healthcare providers for eWorkplaceHealth.com. 
Project 
stakeholders 
purposefully 
sampled 
individuals in order to obtain a wide variety of 
perspectives and represent gender, cultural, and 
occupational diversity. Eleven interviews were 
conducted in total: Six for the physician health 
program (five individual interviews and one focus 
group interview) and five for the workplace health 
program (three individual interviews and two focus 
group interviews). A total of 30 individuals were 
interviewed (13 for physician health and 17 for 
workplace health; see Table I).

Interview schedules (Appendixes A and B) were 
developed by members of the University of Ottawa 
Faculty Wellness program; subject matter experts in 
physician and workplace health, healthcare, and 
workplace learning; and the research team. The 
interviews lasted 30-60 minutes, were audio-taped 
with the participants’ permission, and took place at a 
location convenient for the participants. The 
interviews were transcribed verbatim and the 
transcripts analysed. In the initial step of the analysis, 
the transcripts were read and reread and a preliminary 
list of relevant emergent categories was developed. 
The researchers read the data until no additional 
themes or categories emerged. Once the categories 
reflected “the recurring regularities or patterns in the 
study” [9] and the researchers were satisfied the 
themes reflected the views of the participants, the 
data were assigned to the categories and the findings 
compiled into a report. Direct quotations were used to 
preserve the voice of the participants. 
III. FINDINGS 
 
The 
findings 
for 
the 
two 
programs 
(ePhysicianHealth,com and eWorkplaceHealth.com) 
were similar and therefore are presented together. 
Where differences emerged they are highlighted. Five 
themes 
emerged 
from 
the 
data: 
learner 
characteristics, privacy, usability, convenience, and 
content.

A. Learner Characteristics 
 
The interview participants identified a number of 
characteristics specific to physicians and medical 
students that should be taken into account when 
developing the program on physician health. These 
included (a) physicians are egotistical and therefore 
there is a need to “appeal to their ego”; (b) physicians 
and medical students are adult learners that need 
interaction; (c) physicians and medical students tend 
to be impatient; (d) physicians and medical students 
are under enormous pressure; (e) physicians are 
exposed to the stress of dealing with pain, illness, and 
death on a daily basis; and (f) physicians and medical 
students are incredibly short of time and therefore 
guidelines and/or suggestions (e.g., for living a 
healthier lifestyle) need to be realistic and practical.  
 
For both programs, participants foresaw a lack of 
time due to busy schedules and heavy workloads as 
the 
biggest 
potential 
barrier 
to 
healthcare 
professionals using the programs. One of the two 
most commonly cited themes in the interviews was 
that the key information in the programs must be 
presented in a concise style that takes no more than 
10 minutes to cover but that options for delving 
deeper into the content are included. One physician 
emphasised, “Short things are powerful, don’t be 
afraid of being short. I would support short modules 
and linking to other resources”. 
 
Participants indicated that it would be a problem, 
situation, or crisis involving themselves, a colleague, 
a family member, or a patient that they did not have 
the tools to deal with that would prompt them to visit 
an online program on physician or workplace health. 
For example, a medical administrator reported:  
What would be motivating me [to use an online 
program] would be an actual problem. Typically, 
when I go online it is usually to address an 
issue.… If I have some problems or my 
colleagues have some problems and [I] don’t 
know how to deal with them … an online 
module maybe the first place I would go. 
Further, one participant pointed out the privacy that 
can be provided through an online program offers 
options for physicians and medical students in 
vulnerable situations. Other participants hoped the 
program would be a resource they could use with 
their patients, colleagues, and friends. 
 
Participants agreed that the programs should be 
online to ensure they are accessible to this busy 
population and provide a means of accessing 
resources anonymously. They indicated the target 
audiences would all have access to high speed 
Internet and would possess intermediate to high level 
computer skills, with the exception perhaps of “older 
physicians”. One medical student expressed it this 
way: “Some of the older doctors who do not have a 
lot of computer experience may have some 
challenges. Our generation, everything is about 
computers,… it shouldn’t be a problem”. The 
participants felt that most users would access the 
programs from home, while a few said they thought 
the programs would be accessed from both home and 
work.  
 
Some physicians noted it would be beneficial to 
receive CME credits for completing the physician 
health program and felt this would serve as a 
motivator to do the programs. However, for students 
this was not an issue as they would not benefit from 
this. One physician noted it would be helpful to link 
the program to the CanMEDS competency roles, 
which would allow physicians to demonstrate how 
they are developing competencies within each of the 
roles. 
B. Privacy 
 
The second of the two most frequently cited 
themes related to privacy. Participants indicated that 
participation in the programs needed to be absolutely 
anonymous and that online programs could offer this 
anonymity. It was pointed out that learners coming to 
the site may be in a vulnerable state: “Clinically 
speaking, people experiencing depression, anxiety 
disorder, and so on typically feel cornered. Not all of 
them, but many of them don’t feel that they can reach 
out to get help” (physician). Another physician noted, 
“[the online environment] is a controlled atmosphere, 
less anxiety provoking”. 
 
Participants emphasised there should be no 
tracking or any way of telling who has logged onto 
the site: “Confidentiality is a big aspect for everyone 
in medicine.... When something is on the computer, 
everyone can access it. Ten years down the road, 20 
years down the road, the leak can happen. There is 
always a concern” (physician). A nurse further 
explained, “Confidentiality would be key. Employees 
need to feel confident that if they do access the 
information on managing workplace stress, [it] is not 
somehow 
coming 
back 
to 
their 
employer”. 
Consequently, not having a login name and password 
was preferred by the participants interviewed. 
 
Online anonymity was not the only privacy 
concern voiced by the participants. Those talking 
about the workplace health program were concerned 
about finding a private physical space to access the

program. An occupation therapist noted, “If a 
computer is in a common space, people could look 
over your shoulders”. That said, many felt they 
would not have time to access the program at work as 
many healthcare professionals are busy caring for 
patients during the day and do not have access to a 
computer. One physician suggested that the backing 
of the department might be beneficial to give 
healthcare professionals time to access the program. 
Another 
participant 
suggested 
having 
more 
computers that healthcare staff could access: “Our 
staff in the hospital would tell you that they need 
access to computers and the Internet” (medical 
administrator). 
C. Usability 
 
Another oft-cited theme that emerged from the 
interviews related to usability and having easy access 
to the programs. Participants suggested the names of 
the programs and the URLs should be easy to 
remember and flagged in prominent places. A couple 
of physicians pointed out that the program is not just 
about wellness but also illness and cautioned that in 
order to attract the intended audience, the title of the 
program should reflect this: “I wouldn’t call it ‘the 
wellness site’ or ‘physician wellness’. It is not only 
about wellness, but also about recognising some 
problems too. You need to catch those people who 
are not well” (physician). Participants advocated 
advertising the programs in renowned journals, 
professional 
magazines, 
online 
media, 
and 
newsletters. Using key words that would make the 
programs appear at the top of a Google search was 
also mentioned, as was having links to the programs 
on websites the target audience visit often (e.g., 
Faculty of Medicine homepages, Canadian Medical 
Association). Participants indicated the programs 
should be free of charge with no need to login. 
 
Participants noted the programs need to be 
appealing to the eye and easy to use and navigate, 
with minimal scrolling and moving from one page to 
another. 
A 
few 
participants 
highlighted 
the 
importance of having programs that did not require 
long wait times for components to download. 
Although some participants expressed interest in 
seeing the use of cutting edge technology in the 
programs, the majority appeared to prefer ease and 
speed over “bells and whistles” that may complicate 
the use of the programs due to downloading, 
uploading, or slow Internet speed. One medical 
student summed it up as follows: 
It definitely would help when there are things on 
the website you could click on or interact [with]. 
Sometimes computers load stuff slowly [though]. 
You won’t want anything that is slow. I would 
like to not have to download too much.  
 
Participants did not feel there would be much 
need for technical support. One student suggested: 
“Maybe include an instruction sheet about how to use 
the website and [provide] contact information [for] 
when you have problems. I don’t think we need much 
support”.  
D. Convenience 
 
Several participants said they wanted a program 
at their fingertips that provided a “one stop”, just-in-
time resource for healthcare professionals needing 
help or information at any time of day or night. One 
medical student pointed out the importance of 
“having all the information in one spot. You don’t 
have to look in all different places, you know the 
information you are looking for is reliable”. Another 
reiterated the convenience of “knowing that it is a 
trusted source. This is not something like a Google 
search [where] you don’t know whether the 
information is valid or not, or some other information 
[that is] just very general and doesn’t really help”. 
The convenience of such a program is especially 
relevant for healthcare professionals who may not 
feel comfortable broaching these topics with family 
members or colleagues due to the sensitivity of the 
issue.  
E. Content 
 
Participants provided great insight into the 
content for the programs. Their responses can be 
categorised into five sub-themes: engaging, depth and 
breadth, organisation and delivery, topics, and 
cultural sensitivity. 
1) Engaging: Participants emphasised the 
content in the programs should be concise, relevant, 
practical, and up-to-date. The content needs to be 
interesting and capture the users’ attention in the first 
five minutes. One physician commented: “It’s got to 
have a very attractive lure with a very sharp hook or 
we won’t stay online for very long”. Another 
physician suggested this could be achieved by 
“tell[ing] me something I don’t know.… Give me a 
point of view I hadn’t thought about. Put me in 
someone else’s shoes”. Many participants stressed 
the importance of respecting their current knowledge 
and not talking down to the user. One physiotherapist 
explained:  
We are educated and we are educators. We know 
that to keep our stress down we have to eat right 
 
 
66

and get some exercise. Tell us something we 
don’t know, something new, new findings we 
should be aware of, good resources.… Don’t talk 
down to me. 
 
Ensuring it is “really focused, high quality, 
[with] good evidence-based [content]” would further 
work 
to 
ensure 
the program 
was 
engaging 
(physician). Indeed, participants highlighted the 
importance of involving experts in the content 
development to add credibility.  
2) Depth and Breadth: The depth and breadth of 
the content included in the programs is an important 
consideration. One group of participants referred to a 
program that some of their colleagues had taken that 
was perceived as “a waste of their time”:  
They did a little questionnaire, ‘Are you 
depressed?’ or something like that. [They were 
then given] bits and pieces of information that 
they could look at. It wasn’t sophisticated 
enough. The information was at such a 
superficial level that if you pick up any of the 
magazines at the grocery store, you would have 
exactly the same information on diet, weight 
loss, and exercise. People are looking for 
something that can actually make a difference. 
(occupational therapist) 
 
Although there was a strong preference for 
relevant content presented in concise sections, 
participants agreed that the opportunity to go in-depth 
and learn more about topics should be an option. 
Time is an important consideration for the target 
audiences of these programs. Two participants said 
they would spend a maximum of 30 minutes on the 
resource and one physician said she would spend up 
to an hour. A medical student provided this insight: 
If it is just looking for information during lunch 
time, 10 minutes would definitely be max. But if 
you are looking for information for more serious 
issues, trying to learn something to resolve a 
growing problem for yourself, then you should 
spend 20 or 30 minutes or a longer time for in-
depth information. But not 2 hours. 
 
Participants suggested links to support groups 
and 
resources 
were 
essential. 
In 
particular, 
participants wanted guidance on where to go for 
more help. One physician commented the physician 
health program should provide information on 
“where to send their colleagues in the situation that 
they want to help but not take on the problem 
[themselves]” (physician). Similarly, a medical 
student suggested, “[Provide] links to help. For 
example, if you are a medical student [in a specific 
town or city] here are places/people you can turn to, 
here are faculty and departments you can go to”. One 
physician suggested including information on Code 
99, which helps physicians find their own primary 
care doctor.  
3) Organisation and Delivery: In terms of 
organising content, the following suggestions were 
provided by the participants: (1) use a table of 
contents to make finding information fast and easy; 
(2) provide “need to know” information followed by 
resources for those who “want to know” information 
in more depth; (3) be objective oriented; (4) use point 
form and key phrases and words; (5) organise the 
content into ten minute segments; (6) provide an 
abstract that covers the main ideas; and (7) send 
emails notifying of updated information in a headline 
format. 
 
Participants also talked about how they would 
like to see the content presented. Some expressed that 
they wanted to be engaged in interactive activities 
using cutting edge technology: “Show off up-front 
that you have some magic tricks to ‘wow’ the [user]” 
(physician). Others indicated they preferred content 
that was presented in straightforward text that 
required little or no downloading nor complex 
technology to access. These participants wanted 
something that they could read or easily print either 
for themselves or their patients; they were looking for 
“a quick link to information” (physiotherapist). A 
few suggested interactive activities and multimedia 
would be nice but should be optional. A physician 
explained: “Sometimes I just want to skim 
knowledge, other times I may want to listen to a 
podcast or watch a video”. Most participants 
indicated that time would be an issue if they had to 
complete interactive activities. 
Participants’ ideas regarding what kind of features 
and activities the programs should include spanned 
the full spectrum of pedagogical strategies: 
I envision those online learning tools, [such as] 
check boxes, clicking on things, filling the 
blanks may be appreciated by some people. 
Multiple 
choice, 
rearranging 
things. 
For 
example, [if] someone is mean to me in 10 
different ways, how do I rearrange them and 
target the most important things? (physician) 
 
Other approaches suggested by participants 
included problem-based learning rather than a 
didactic approach; reflective exercises—“some of the 
more intangible values are often best assessed by 
reflection” 
(physician); 
quizzes—though 
some 
 
 
67
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 2 no 1 & 2, year 2010, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

physicians did not want quizzes; Powerpoint slide 
presentations; flowcharts; graphics and diagrams that 
demonstrate key points—“sometimes difficult things 
can be conveyed in a way that it is more visual” 
(physician); cartoons; audio and video; and role 
playing—“say one has a certain type of situation, 
how to deal with this situation, how others reacted” 
(medical student).  
 
The form of content presentation that all 
participants were receptive to was short video 
vignettes portraying stories of colleagues who had 
overcome similar problems that they might face. One 
medical student suggested: “two or three minute 
vignettes for, not a serious problem but sort of a 
moderate range problem, that could maybe have the 
individual experience some revelation about the a 
minor change they can make”. Case studies, success 
stories, and testimonials were also mentioned by 
participants. 
 
Several 
participants 
indicated 
that 
self-
assessment exercises would be helpful, as would 
checklists that would allow them to identify warning 
signs and symptoms. 
One nurse said she would 
like self-assessment activities that would allow her to 
diagnose her problem and then provide solutions to 
solve 
it: 
“I 
can 
see 
some 
self-assessment 
questionnaire. For me, if I am feeling obsessively 
anxious then I would like to have something that tells 
me, ‘Yes, you are anxious and you need this and you 
can benefit from this’”. Self-assessments would also 
be an effective way of providing feedback on 
learning. One physician noted, “[Physicians] like 
getting feedback. They like to feel they have 
mastered [something] and then go on”. Another 
noted, “Personally, I like real time feedback. Keeping 
track of how things are going”. A medical student 
suggested that whether or not you provide feedback 
and what kind of feedback you provide depends on 
how the resource is being used: “If you use it for self-
help or assessment of somebody else, you may not 
want any feedback. If you are doing it for learning 
purposes, to get educated, that is different”. 
 
Although many participants acknowledged the 
benefits of having online discussions in the programs, 
participants recognised that there would be too many 
issues related to physician or patient confidentiality 
to include them. One physician reflected, “We could 
have an area for discussion or blog type post or using 
a wiki where things could be updated by the users. 
[But you would need to] take into consideration 
confidentiality; the question is how it could work?”.  
4) Topics: A variety of topics were suggested for 
inclusion in the two programs. For the physician 
health program, four areas related to health emerged: 
mental, emotional, professional, and physical health. 
The most common topics mentioned by participants 
were mental health issues such as depression, suicide, 
stress, anxiety, burnout, and substance abuse. The 
second most popular topics mentioned related to 
emotional 
health 
issues and 
included 
family 
management, 
relationship 
management, 
issues 
associated 
with 
different 
minorities, 
sexual 
orientation, the transgender community, culture and 
gender, emotional intelligence, family illness, and 
living or working with chronic illness. 
 
Professional health was also deemed extremely 
important by participants. This category included 
topics 
such 
as 
disruptive 
behaviour, 
time 
management, financial planning and managing debt, 
physician-patient 
boundary 
issues, 
choosing 
a 
residency and getting through it, legal issues, conflict 
resolution, and support for international medical 
graduates to help them transition into the Canadian 
culture and ensure professionalism. One physician 
summed up the types of content she would be looking 
for in the program: 
Not only diagnostic categories but some life 
management categories, such as how do I 
manage time?… How do I manage if there is too 
much work? How do I cope with the stress of 
family members when I am juggling three jobs? 
How do I cope with my crazy teenagers? What if 
I only have 20 minutes to exercise?… In the end, 
the management category is practical,… not just 
the illness but the wellness side is helpful. 
Physical health issues, although not mentioned 
as frequently, were also deemed important by several 
participants. Topics included fitness, relaxation 
techniques, heart disease, and blood pressure.   
Several of the topics suggested by participants 
for the workplace health program were the same as 
those identified by participants for the physician 
health program: stress, physical and mental health, 
time 
management, 
conflict 
resolution, 
professionalism, 
teamwork/relationships, 
and 
disruptive behaviour. Additional topics identified for 
inclusion were bullying, flu vaccine, fatigue 
management, dealing with the loss of a patient, care 
for the caregiver, manners, etiquette for sending 
email, how to run a committee, working in an 
interprofessional team, pandemic preparedness, and 
compassion.

Interview participants for the workplace health 
program were asked what factors in their work life 
most influenced their mental and physical health. 
Workload, environment, and relationships were the 
three factors that emerged. Workload was the most 
commonly cited stressor. The number of patients the 
healthcare providers had to see in a day meant that 
sometimes they were not able to give all the patients 
the time and attention they wanted to and this was a 
source of stress for them. Moreover, they noted that 
not having the autonomy to be able to decide when to 
eat lunch, when to go on vacation, or when to be able 
to go to the bathroom affected their health. 
The 
physical 
environment 
(e.g., 
lighting, 
ventilation, mould, infection control, having an office 
window, and access to adequate bathrooms) was 
identified as a cause of workplace stress for many 
healthcare providers interviewed. One medical 
administrator stated: 
The type of space you have, whether you have 
access to external light, clean air, and water 
[affects your stress level]. We have a number of 
older facilities and we have facilities that are 
going 
through 
transition, 
renovation, 
and 
whatnot, so that certainly has an impact on [the 
staff’s] stress level.  
Relationships in the workplace clearly affect 
health. 
All 
participants 
discussed 
how 
their 
immediate supervisor, colleagues, and the people 
they work with have a significant impact on their 
workplace health. Much of the stress identified 
appeared to be related to the organisation’s 
administration and management style and policies 
(e.g., slowing the  hiring process to reduce the deficit, 
establishing policies regarding absenteeism, not 
being recognised for the contributions made in the 
workplace). One nurse felt that workplace conflict is 
one of the highest stressors.  
5) Cultural Sensitivity: Participants indicated the 
programs need to be sensitive to gender and cultural 
issues. One physician said: 
Building something to reach everyone is a 
challenge. I hope there are a lot of sensitivities to 
this issue. Maybe the speakers could represent 
different cultural, religious, and gender groups. 
People who feel ostracised are likely people who 
would feel depressed and anxious. Chances are 
people from different cultures may want the least 
intrusive way to deal with this online. 
Participants pointed out the importance of being 
sensitive in the materials and resources chosen. One 
medical student suggested: “If you give out links to 
articles and those articles always concern white 
middle-age men that may be a problem. You need 
variety in the links and examples so that it concerns 
different genders, cultures, and backgrounds”. 
Similarly, a physician stated: “We have to be really 
sensitive to the context, the scenario, the vignette, the 
name chosen. Make sure different culture issues are 
covered”. 
Recognising the two official languages of 
Canada, participants suggested the programs should 
be bilingual; though they acknowledged the cost of 
this and thought this could come in a later phase. One 
physician noted, “It would be interesting to have 
culturally sensitive vignettes in both official 
languages”. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
 
It was clearly apparent from the needs 
assessment 
for 
ePhysicianHealth.com 
and 
eWorkplaceHealth.com that the needs for the two 
programs 
are 
very 
similar. 
Three 
possible 
explanations for the similarities are: (1) the content in 
both programs will be very similar as it will address 
the health of healthcare providers; (2) the target 
audience for both programs is busy adult healthcare 
professionals; and (3) interview participants for 
eWorkplaceHealth.com included physicians so the 
views of physicians were obtained for both programs. 
However, the other healthcare providers (i.e., nurses, 
physiotherapists, 
occupational 
therapists, 
psychologists, recreational therapists, social workers, 
and medical administrators) had similar perspectives 
to those of the physicians with regards to what they 
felt they and their colleagues wanted and needed with 
regards to the online programs.  
 
The two most common findings for the two 
programs that were voiced loud and clear were (1) 
that the information must be presented in a concise 
style that takes no more than 10 minutes to cover 
with the option of delving deeper into the content if 
desired and (2) individuals’ participation in the 
programs must be anonymous. Other key findings 
were that the programs needed to be easy to find and 
access; be easy to use; and contain evidence-based, 
meaningful, practical content.  
V. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The 
following 
is 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
recommendations for the design and delivery of the 
two programs:
