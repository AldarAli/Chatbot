Abstract—Consider the MIMO detection background. While
the hard-decision Sphere Decoder has been widely and recently
considered as the most promising near-optimal detector, this
perspective might fall down during the soft-decision extension
through a List Sphere Decoder (LSD). Due to the ﬁniteness of
the LSD list output - that does not necessarily allow for generating
explicitly the Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs), even through a
max-log approximation - the issue of how to set the missing
reliabilities has been addressed. This paper presents existing
works concerning the main trend. In particular, it consists in
setting the LLR to a pre-deﬁned value, this operation being
commonly referred as LLR Clipping. We discuss this choice that
has a signiﬁcant impact on the system performance, by providing
a brief state of the art of the existing solutions. In addition in
the presented work, a novel solution lies in the multi-level bit
mapping. Despite of its simplicity, it allows for low distortion
approximated LLR computation. By simulation, the superiority
of our method over the existing solutions, is shown.

I. INTRODUCTION
In order to achieve the 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE)
and 3GPP LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) requirements, Spatial Mul-
tiplexing Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (SM-MIMO) com-
munication schemes have been implemented. In such a conﬁg-
uration and from the receiver point of view, a linear superposi-
tion of separately transmitted information symbols is observed,
due to multiple transmit antennas that simultaneously send
independent data streams. The interest of the detectors consists
in recovering the transmitted symbols while approaching the
channel capacity [1], and corresponds to an inverse problem
with a ﬁnite-alphabet constraint.
As treated in several publications, the optimal - while
exponentially complex in the number of transmit antennas and
constellation size- Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector [2] can
be efﬁciently approximated although avoiding an exhaustive
search. In particular, some well-established techniques such
as Sphere Decoding (SD) [3], Lattice Reduction (LR) [4] or
a combination of both [5], have been shown to offer near-
optimal performance. In the practical case of coded systems
and due to their performance-complexity ﬂexibility, the afore-
mentioned detectors are straightforwardly modiﬁed in order to
provide Soft-Output (SO). In the particular case of the classical
K-Best, strongly presented in [6], a list L - of size |L| - of
candidate solutions is generated from a subset of lattice points.
This detector is denoted as the List SD (LSD) and will be
considered in the present article, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
In order to achieve the channel capacity, the acknowl-
edged way of bit transmission lies in providing redundancy
and interleaving, denoted as channel coding. By focusing on
the performance-complexity optimization, modern capacity-
approaching codes lie in probabilistic coding schemes [7].
In particular, convolutional codes [8] led to the widely em-
ployed turbo codes [1], that are considered in this paper. In
such schemes, soft-decisions of coded symbols are typically
produced from the detector output, plus any available side
information, and passed on to the decoder in the form of bit-
wise Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLR), with the sign representing
the decision and the magnitude representing the reliability.
In the present article, the logical {0, 1} bit patterns are
respectively mapped onto the - zero-mean - set of amplitude
levels {+1, −1}. From the decoder point of view, a close-to-
zero value corresponds to an unreliable bit.
By evoking ﬁrst that the LLR approximation is expressed
as a function of both the probability of any bit represen-
tation [9], given the data in reception, and since the LSD
output contains at least one solution, it is clear that a correct
LLR sign is robustly reached, leading to promising uncoded
performance [3], [4], [5]. However, due to the ﬁnite nature
of the output L of the LSD that only offers a reduced-
size list of candidates, its magnitude is regularly unknown,
namely when the list does not contain both the hypothesis
and its counter-hypothesis for a given bit. As a consequence,
the performance in coded communication systems may be
dramatically impacted.
While the exact LLR calculation is processed when possi-
ble, the main issue in the soft decision extension consists in
how to estimate the missing LLR magnitude. To the best of
the authors’ knowledge, two distinct trends have been explored
in the digital communications literature. B¨aro has early met
this problematic aspect and proposed a path augmentation [10]
that consists in considering a bit-wise granularity during the
tree construction. However, such a scheme requires high
computational complexity and poor performance is reached
if no apriori information is available [11].
A simple yet efﬁcient operation has been widely studied.

It is commonly referred as LLR Clipping (LC) [9], [12] and
lies on setting the missing LLR values to a predeﬁned value.
However, the choice of the clipping level has a strong impact
on the system performance [12], as addressed in the following,
and any optimization is valuable.
Contribution: Our contributions can be summarized as
follows:
• A multi-level bit mapping in the LC is presented, which
leads to a signiﬁcant coded performance improvement
and offers convenient result improvement;
• The introduced solution preserves a general approach that
makes it applicable to any LC.
Outline of the paper: In Section II, the notations are
given and the problem statement is presented. In Section III,
the necessity of introducing an accurate LC is explained and
a detailed description of existing solutions is presented. The
proposed solution is defended and introduced in Section IV.
Section V aims at providing simulation results that show
the superiority of the proposed solution. Finally, concluding
remarks and perspectives are given in Section VI.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider a nT -transmit and nR-receive nT × nR MIMO
system model. Assuming narrow-band ﬂat-fading, the receive
symbols vector y ∈ CnR typically reads
y = Hx + n,
(1)
where H ∈ CnR×nT is the complex channel matrix, assumed
to be perfectly known at the receiver, and n is a complex
additive white Gaussian noise of variance σ2
n. The entries of
the transmit symbol vector x are independently withdrawn
from a constellation set ξ, containing |ξ| symbols, and such
that x
∈
ξnT . Also, a layer ν is deﬁned as a spatial
stream, the number of spatial multiplexing data streams being
min{nR, nT }. Each channel inputs bn
k ∈ {±1}ν log2{|ξ|} is
assigned to a symbol according to any encoding scheme, where
n is any given layer and k is any bit position within the
corresponding symbol. The whole symbols vector is mapped
from a block of bit stream cl, by denoting l as the number
of bits of the codeword with 1 ≤ l ≤ ν log2{|ξ|}. At this
step, the uncoded or coded case is not distinguished. The
block code may consider channel coding through the addition
of redundancy and correlation, by introducing the code rate
R ≤ 1 - where R = 1 makes c corresponding to uncoded bits
-, and interleaving [13]. By applying an efﬁcient modulation
and code rate scheme, the channel capacity is almost achieved
at any SNR point [1].
The extrinsic LLR of the bit bn
receive signal and is denoted Λ(bn k is conditioned on the
k | y). Through the Bayes’
theory and by using the high SNR approximation, which makes
the classical max-log approximation accurate, it becomes
advantageously rewrites [9]:

transmit data and the bit index k within any symbol inside are
such that 1 ≤ n ≤ ν and 1 ≤ k ≤ log2{|ξ|}, respectively.
The importance of LC on both performance and complexity
is highlighted. With this aim in view, the ratio of the occur-
rence of a missing counter-hypothesis as a function of |L| is
depicted in Figure 1, for a 4×4 system, with QPSK or 16QAM
modulations on each antenna.
It appears that the number of to-be-clipped LLR values
depends on the SNR, on the list size |L| and on the modulation
scheme. In particular in the 16QAM case and for a high range
SNR, the ratio is 73% and 38% for |L| being 4 and 16,
respectively.
Beyond this consideration, it is also clear that also the
clipping value depends on the list size |L|. As seen in Figure 1
and in the case of large |L|, few missing counter-hypothesis
remain. However, since a large neighbourhood study of lattice
points has been processed, the corresponding bit sign is very
improbable and should be clipped to a large value. In the case
of a small |L|, more missing counter-hypothesis are contained
within the list output. Due to the partial nature of the study,
the bit sign is not completely improbable, leading to choosing
a small clipping value.
This idea has to be introduced in theory. It can be
done through the introduction of the mutual information
I{bn
k, Λclip(bn
k)} of any bit amplitude and any corresponding
LC value, denoted as Λclip(bn
k). By assuming that the bit sign
in the LC is correct and Pr{bn
k = +1} = Pr{bn
k = −1} = 1
2,
the mutual information reads:

be observed. In particular, a solution for determining the

Figure 2 plots the mutual information between bn

Λclip(bn
k) and for different values of Pr{Λclip(bn
k)}. Also,
the maximal mutual information - given any Pr{Λclip(bn
k)}
value - is pointed out by diamond marks and indicates the
optimal clipping value.
Consequently, it is clear that there exists an optimal value
that is not a constant. At least, it depends on the number
of missing counter-hypothesis. Its evolution is plotted in
Figure 2 with a dashed style. Also, while an efﬁcient balance
- namely Λclip(bn
k) = 3 [12] - can been found at intermediate
clipping values, it has to be noticed that the LC choice has
a signiﬁcant impact on the coded performance. In particular,
choosing the clipping level too high induces the decoder to
assume a too high reliability for the bits with missing counter-
hypothesis and consequently prevents error correction at these
bit positions. Setting the clipping level too low limits the
mutual information at the detector output and thus decreases
its performance.
In order to address this problematic aspect, numerous
techniques have been proposed and studied.
III. SUMMARY OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS
In case both the hypothesis and its counter-hypothesis
given any bit arise in L, the LLR is calculated according
to Equation (2). Naively, we can consider that the soft in-
formation about any given bit bn
k is essentially contained in
L. Indeed, if there are many entries in L with bn
k = −1,
then it can be concluded that the likely value for bn
k is
indeed minus one, whereas if few entries occur, then the likely
value is one. In the particular conﬁguration of no arising
counter-hypothesis within L, Hochwald et al. proposed ﬁrst
a solution. It consists in setting its corresponding LLR value
Λclip(bn
k) to an extremely large value [9], namely ±128, due
to their high improbability. However, by proceeding this way,
the importance given to unknown LLRs is too high and the
channel coding gain is impaired.
A. Fixed LLR Clipping
Ideally, Λclip(bn
k) should be different for each channel bit,
such that the mutual information is maximized [12]. Neverthe-
less, a simple while robust proposal has been introduced [9],
[5]. For a missing ±1 bit value on any of the ν log2(|ξ|)
locations, the corresponding LLR is set to ±8, based on the
argument that a missing bit value from the list of candidates
makes it unlikely. As previously discussed, such a Fixed LC
(FLC) value is efﬁcient in the case of large |L| only. It can
anyway be considered as a convenient upper bound [11], [14].
Another reasonably balanced FLC is commonly employed.
The FLC value can be set to ±3 and offers convenient
performance [12]. Again, it has been previously discussed that
such a FLC value is efﬁcient in the case of small |L| only.
In particular in [11], performance is depicted in the case of a
naive LSD and Λclipbn
compared to Λclipbn k = 3. Improved performance is offered
k = 8, except with a very large study,
namely with |L| = 64. Consequently, this simple although
efﬁcient technique will be used as a reference in the simulation
results.
By referring again to Figure 2, it must be highlighted that
a constant clipping value that is much lower than the optimum
value for a given bit position causes the channel decoder
to largely ignore the clipped detector output values, which
degrades its error-correction effectiveness. A clipping value
that is much higher than its optimum value forces the channel
decoder to assume that the clipped detector output values have
the correct sign. In the case that this assumption is not correct,
soft decisions on other bits must be compromised in order to
meet the code constraints, leading to error propagation. Con-
sequently, the optimal LC level strongly depends of the system
conﬁguration as well as the employed detector calibration.
B. Empirical LLR Clipping
Widdup et al. subsequently considered to use some in-
formation contained in the LSD output. In particular, since
the costs of only the best |L| solutions are known, the others
must be estimated from the knowledge that their cost is at
least as high as that of the worst known point, namely the
current radius [15]. This solution is also denoted as the last
list entry [11] and offers a signiﬁcant coded performance gain
compared to the naive solution. However, this solution does
not match with the widely used K-Best LSD nature, that does
not take advantage (without early termination condition) of
the radius constraint. Namely, contrary a depth-ﬁrst search,
the radius is not shrinked during the process. Even if the
largest Euclidean distance of the counter-hypothesis is con-
sidered, such a clipping does not give importance enough to
the fact that the counter-hypothesis does not appear in L.
Consequently, it leads to a signiﬁcant performance loss [11].
That is why Kawamoto et al. introduced a likelihood func-
tion generation for selecting an appropriate clipping value [16],
[17]. Brieﬂy, this solution lies in a statistical study of the radius
and an empirical result. In particular, the expectation of the
minimum squared Euclidean distance among the bits within
32

the list output that offers both the hypothesis and counter-
hypothesis is calculated. This value is then grown up by
50% [16] in order to increase its weight. Thus, the LC value
is obtained.
The presented solution lies in empirical results that offer
neither strong theoretical results nor convincing performances.
C. SNR-aware LLR Clipping
As previously mentioned, the LC value is expected to
depend on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), on |L| and on the
modulation scheme (not of the code rate, as clearly introduced
in [18], Theorem 1). However, the main issue relies on how
to take these factors into account.
Milliner et al. recently proposed an analytical expression,
especially detailed in [18] in the particular case of BPSK,
that is claimed to provide the optimal clipping value in the
AWGN case for any arbitrary code rate. Starting from the
exact LLR deﬁnition, an approximation is proposed through
the introduction of the channel state information based bit error
probabilities of a bit to be +1 and -1.
The Symbol Error Rate (SER) for the ML detector in the
case of a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) transmission
over an AWGN SISO channel with effective SNR [11] is:

i is the instan-

the transmit signal) [11]. Following classical QAM extensions

which the QAM BER can be easily obtained. The predicted

Λclip(bn

(5)
This solution offers convenient results. In particular, it outper-
forms any FLC solution [11]. However, a drawback remain.
Due to the AWGN assumption, the technique is optimal only
in mean over multiple Rayleigh channel realizations. Also, the
whole bit sequence is considered. In particular, the additional
knowledge about the bit position is not taken into account.
By considering the aforementioned techniques, a simple
while efﬁcient optimization is introduced in the following.
IV. PROPOSED SOLUTION
An original approach lies in taking into account the multi-
level bit mapping nature of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
(QAM) which is a multi-level bits-to-symbol mapping. Every
symbol correspond to a codeword. They are each characterized
by a different mean Euclidean distance, and hence a different
level of protection against noise and amplitude impairments.
This aspect depends on the bit position within the bit sequence.
In Figure 3, the example of 16QAM case is shown. In
particular for this case, two levels exist comprising Most
Signiﬁcant Bits (MSB), with a bold representation, and Least
Signiﬁcant Bits (LSB) for each signal point. For 64QAM, three
levels of protection exist while only one exists for 4QAM.
The latter being actually not strictly a multi-level mapping
since the protection level is the same among the codeword. In
the following, for the sake of simplicity and without loss of
generality, only the 16QAM case will be considered.
In the LTE-A downlink case [19], QAM modulations with
a multilevel Gray mapping can be partitioned into square
subsets with minimum mean intrasubset Euclidean distance.
In Figure 3, the MSBs of a signal point determine in which
subset it is located.
This idea is novel in this context. In [12], the multilevel

16QAM modulation constellation for LTE-A downlink [19]
bit mapping is considered in order to reduce the detector
complexity, which becomes nearly independent of the signal
constellation size. However, there is no link in the LLR
calculation, and in particular in the LC.
Analytical expressions could be introduced from [20] and
with required updates. However, Figure 4 exhibits more clearly
the multilevel impact on LLRs in the particular case of a trivial
4 × 4 AWGN MIMO channel with 16QAM modulations on
each layer. As it is shown, the LLRs are distributed differently
depending on the bit index and the SNR. In particular, there
is no maximal value for MSB, while there is a maximal value
for positive LSB, from a Soft-Decision ML output. Also,
consistently with previous discussions, this maximal value
is different according to the SNR. The idea presented here
consists in exploiting this additional knowledge in order to
apply different clipping values to generate lower-distortion
approximated LLR.
Through a SNR normalization, the positive LSB are shown
in Figure 5 to be still upper bounded by a constant value
in the Rayleigh channel case, this upper bound is marked
by diamonds. For multiple SNR, the distribution of LLRs
normalized by SNR is depicted in a 4 × 4 complex MIMO
system. Similarly to [11], the proposed technique is SNR-
aware and consider the modulation type as well. It does not
consider the list size and offers an optimization by considering
the additional knowledge of the bit position.
In particular, the positive LSB LLRs have been shown to

LLRs still depend on the SNR. This point is more clearly
illustrated in Figure 6, where the maximum normalized LLRs
from the soft-decision ML output are plotted as a function of
SNR for different bit positions. From Figure 6, an efﬁcient

clip
(bn

constant over the SNR range and independent of the number
of clipped bits. This is not the case for the other bit positions
which depend on the SNR and on the number of clipped bits.
Nevertheless, further note that the absolute clipping values for
MSB are the same:

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
For the sake of comparability of the provided simula-
tion results, the employed solution lies on considering a
reference Soft-Decision ML detectors, which provides all the
needed LLR values through an explicit computation. A certain
percentage of these values are arbitrary discarded. Such a
scheme is denoted as the eclipsed ML detector, and strictly
corresponds to a LSD. The interest lies in keeping under
control the percentage of missing LLR. The missing values are
then clipped according to the proposed solution. The position
of the discarded value is done randomly in order to make
the ratio uniformly distributed between all the bit positions.
Consequently, the real impact of the proposed solution is
shown. In particular in the presented simulations, the ratio is
deﬁned as the proportion of forced clipped value from the
soft-decision ML output. In the case of a ratio of p: p%
of the provided LLRs are clipped according to any clipping
technique. The 100 − p% other LLR values remain explicitly
computed. All the simulation results are compared to the ML
detector with max-log approximation, used as a reference, and
to the constant ±3 clipping value, which has been previously
shown to be a very efﬁcient empirical result.
By considering the simulation conditions below, Figure 7
shows the BER and BLock Error Rate (BLER) error perfor-
mance of the eclipsed ML detector in a 4 × 4 SM-MIMO
system. At the transmitter, binary information data bits are
ﬁrst serial-to-parallel-converted into four data streams and
are segmented into blocks containing a selected number of
bits per packet frame according to the employed Modula-
tion and Coding Scheme (MCS). The information data se-
quence is encoded by Turbo coding with memory 2 code
and 1 + D + D2 and 1 + D2 feedback and feedforward
polynomials, respectively. Also, the data is interleaved from
a Look-Up Table. The original coding rate R = 1
3 and then
punctured according to the coding rate of R = 3
4 when the
resultant encoded sequence is data-modulated. The considered
modulation format is 16QAM only with multilevel LTE-A bit
mapping. Blocks of information bits are fed to the channel
encoder, and subsequently transmitted over a Rayleigh fading

MIMO channel, by forcing the 1,049 transmit symbols per
block, independently of the employed modulation. It presently
corresponds to 1008 transmit redundant bits per block, to
within one rounding. For each block, 20 half iterations within
the turbo decoder have been performed. We consider it is
sufﬁcient for achieving the convergence of the turbo decoder
and consequently for reaching the maximal performance.
Both the BER and BLER performances conﬁrm the efﬁ-
ciency of our proposed technique for 38% of clipping values.
This proportion matches with the ratio obtained through a
naive LSD with |L| = 16 in a 4 × 4 MIMO system with
16QAM modulation on each layer, as depicted in Figure 1.
Such a LSD calibration may be shown to allow near-optimal
performance in the hard-decision case [6]. As it is shown in
Figure 7, the proposed technique outperforms the clipping of
±3 for every bit position proposed in [12] by 0.26 dB for a
BER of 10−3 and by 0.21 dB for a BLER of 10−1.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed a novel technique that allows for low
distortion approximated LLR computation at the output of a
soft-decision near-ML detector. Moreover, such approximation
is judiciously applied depending on the actual bit-mapping
indexing used by QAM constellations. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, no method presented so far exploited
this information to solve the problem of LC for the class of
receivers considered and such a technical solution offers a
signiﬁcant performance gain. Also, the presented technique is
general and may be applied to any more advanced technique.
