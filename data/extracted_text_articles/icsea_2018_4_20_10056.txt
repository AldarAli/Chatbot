Abstract—With the increasing use of the Internet, Web and 
mobile technologies at present, software startups, which are 
newly created software companies with no history, have 
become an important phenomenon in the software industry. 
They have a wide impact on the technology market and a 
significant impact on the global economy. However, even with 
the increase in the importance of software startups for the 
economy and communities, little research has investigated the 
challenges of this phenomenon, especially with new software 
markets, such as the Saudi Arabia market. This study aimed to 
investigate the challenges faced by the software startup 
industry in Saudi Arabia. It presents a mixed-methodology 
study based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. 
The findings of this study revealed a list of challenges that need 
to be considered in order to improve the industry for software 
startups. The lack of transparency and funding can be 
considered the biggest concern for software startups in Saudi 
Arabia. 
Keywords-Software startups; startup challenges; small 
software development; software industry; information startups 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Software startups are newly created companies with little 
or no history that aim to grow rapidly in the software 
industry [16]. Software startups aim at innovation and 
building software products within a limited time and with 
few resources [32]. Blank [9] described startups as 
temporary human organizations with no prior operating 
history that aim to create new, high-tech products or 
services. Software startups are considered to be an important 
phenomenon in the modern economy and society. This 
phenomenon creates approximately three million new jobs 
each year in the USA. Information technology companies, 
such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Dropbox, are 
good examples of how startups can transform into successful 
businesses, provide tremendous support to their national 
economies and have a significant impact on the global 
economy [18]. However, about 60% of startups do not 
survive the first five years [16]. Early stage software startups 
face key challenges to success in this industry such as lack of 
resources and experiences [18]. The competition in the 
industry drives most of the startups to exit the market within 
two years form creation [25].  Due to the high failure rates of 
software startups, communities, organizations and even 
countries are beginning to investigate this phenomenon. 
There is a current need for research to support startups with 
their software engineering practices [25]. This study is 
aiming to provide deep investigation of the challenges faced 
by the software startup industry in Saudi Arabia in order to 
address the current gap of knowledge. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
background and previous studies is reported in Section 2. 
Section 3 addresses the research methodology. Results are 
reported in Section 4. Then the discussion is presented within 
Section 5. Finally, the study concludes in Section 6. 
 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
Software startups are considered to face several 
challenges; they may encounter obstacles when attempting to 
sell their first products, acquire paying customers and 
establish entrepreneurial teams [32]. Giardino et al. [18] 
highlighted several challenges for software startups, 
including lack of resources, lack of experience, dependence 
on one product, the uncertainty of their conditions, time 
pressure and lack of sustainability. The nature of software 
startups, as newly created organizations working in uncertain 
markets and using cutting-edge technology, make them 
challenging endeavors [32]. Klonowski et al. [19] 
investigated software startups in Central and Eastern Europe 
and placed the challenges into four categories, namely 
problems with funding, problems with management, the 
change in corporate culture and acceptance of the business 
model and financial underperformance. Giardino et al. [16] 
also reported that the main challenges for many startups are 
thriving despite technological uncertainty and finding the 
first paying customers. Giardino et al. [17] reported similar 
challenges, as well as others such as obtaining initial 
funding, creating entrepreneurial teams, providing value to 
customers, starting to make a profit and configuration 
management. Little relevant research pertaining to software 
startups exists; Pateronster studied software startups via a 
systematic map study and reported a few studies in the area 
of software startups [25]. Unterkalmsteiner  et al. [32] stated 
that research on software startups has increased over the last 
year, but there is still a need for more investigation in this 
area.  
Alnafjan [2] investigated the applied software practices 
in Saudi Arabia and reported clear weaknesses in adopting 
software engineering practices, particularly for small 
organizations. Alnuem [3], who also investigated the 
software industry in Saudi Arabia, reported serious issues in 
the industry, such as culture, communications and 
understanding the requirements clearly. 
The software industry in Saudi Arabia is considered to be 
in the early stages. A few companies could survive in this 
industry. The Saudi government has established a new vision 
72

called “Vision 2030.” One of its goals is to help software 
startups to develop a successful market in order to support 
the national economy. The government also aims to support 
e-government transformation. On the other hand, there is a 
gap in the current knowledge regarding challenges faced by 
software startups in Saudi Arabia. There is a lack of 
empirical updated studies that provide deep investigation of 
the Saudi software industry. This paper aims to investigate 
this area in order to provide a better understanding of the 
challenges software startups face and to help the community 
to build a better software industry. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
This paper presents a mixed-methodology study that 
includes both quantitative and qualitative data. Semi-
structured interviews and questionnaires will be used as tools 
to collect data. The combination of quantitative and 
qualitative data aims to add more reliability and validity to 
the study’s results. Bryman [12] referred to mixed-methods 
research as follows: “This term is widely used nowadays to 
refer to research that combines methods associated with 
both quantitative and qualitative research”. Employing the 
mixed approach matches the study aims and objectives and 
should allow for a better understanding of the specific 
challenges of software startups in more detail. The 
quantitative form will provide the critical numbers and 
statistics needed to study the challenges, while the qualitative 
data will be applied as a secondary methodology to provide 
richer information and an explanation of the study findings. 
The findings from both approaches will be integrated to form 
a better understanding of software startup challenges.  
A. Research question  
This study aims to investigate the software industry in 
Saudi Arabia in order to provide a better understanding of 
the current barriers that software startups encounter by 
addressing the following research question: 
RQ: What are the main challenges encountered by 
software startups in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) 
from the perspective of software development? 
B. Data collection  
1) The quantitative data 
The quantitative data were collected via a self-completed 
online survey. About 10 people were invited to pilot the 
questionnaire, 
including 
project 
managers, 
software 
developers and testers, most of whom were experts in 
software development. The questionnaire was distributed 
during two main startup events in the KSA (the SAP Startup 
Focus Forum Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, 2016, and the Small 
and Medium Enterprise Forum in Jeddah, 2017). It was also 
distributed online to approximately 120 software companies 
in the Kingdom. By the end of the data collection phase, 74 
completed and eligible responses were received. The 
questionnaire investigated 19 phrases, which will be treated 
as possible hypotheses for the challenges faced by software 
startups in Saudi Arabia.

PH19 
These phrases represent the expected obstacles to 
software development based on previous studies. A five-
point Likert scale was used to explore the questionnaire 
respondents’ degrees of agreement with these challenges. 
Table Ι presents the invested hypotheses and their references 
from the previous studies. 
2)  The qualitative data 
The qualitative data were collected via structured 
interviews. The interviews were face-to-face and were 
recorded using a voice recorder. In addition, notes of the 
main ideas and answers were taken during the interviews. 
The transcribed documents were then compared to the notes 
from the interviews to ensure the reliability of the data. 
Following this, a thematic analysis, which is an approach to 
identify the themes and patterns from the collected 
qualitative data, was conducted [11][14]. In addition, the 
data-driven method was selected for the thematic analysis of 
this study [5]. The interpretation of data has been reviewed 
by a ccolleague to ensure its accuracy.  
IV. 
RESULTS  
This section reports the result of this study. First of all, it 
states the results of the descriptive analysis. Then, it will 
address the result of reliability test. Finally, the quantitative 
results and qualitative results will be reported.

A.  Descriptive analysis 
This section describes the background information about 
the study participants, including their experience, team size 
and the location of their development teams. 
1) Development experience 
Table ΙΙ shows the participants’ number of years of 
experience in software development. Most of the participants 
had from four to seven years of software development 
experience, while about 35% had from one to four years of 
experience. This shows that the study’s participants had 
substantial software development experience.

2) Team size 
Table ΙΙΙ below indicates the size of the team that 
developers usually have. Most of the participants (42%) 
came from teams with five to 15 members; the second 
highest figure was 15 to 25 team members (37% of the 
sample), while less than 13% of the sample were from teams 
that had more than 25 members, and only 8% of the 
participants came from teams with fewer than five team 
members. This information is expected due to the nature of 
startup companies’ sizes.

3) Outsourced development 
Table ΙV shows that most of the study’s participants had 
outsourced or offshore teams. About 87% of the sample 
explained that some of their functions were developed 
outside of the country. Only 10 participants did not have 
outsourced teams. This result could relate to the difficulty of 
the software industry in Saudi Arabia, which leads most 
companies to outsource some of their development.

B. Reliability 
According to Bryman and Cramer [12], “The reliability 
of measure refers to its consistency.” Pallant [23] also stated, 
“The reliability of a scale indicates how free it is from 
random error”. With multiple-item scales, such as the Likert 
scale, variables of internal reliability need to be tested. The 
aim is to examine whether each scale is measuring a single 
idea and how each item affects the internal consistency of the 
scale [12]. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient has been applied to 
test data reliability. This shows the correlation among all the 
items in the scale. The ideal Cronbach’s alpha level is above 
0.7 [23]. Table V shows the Cronbach’s alpha values for the 
challenges under investigation. The alpha value was 0.776, 
which means that the items were internally consistent.

Table VΙ shows the results of the normality test. The 
results show that the data were not normally distributed, with 
a significance of less than 0.05 for both the Shapiro-Wilk 
and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. This means that the data 
pertaining to those scales will be treated as nonparametric 
data [23]. The median and mode should be used to describe 
nonparametric data [10][12]. Table VII shows the mean, 
median and mode for each phrase. It also shows the results of 
testing each phrase. The hypothesis will be accepted if the 
median is above 2.5 and rejected if it is less than 2.5.

D. Qualitative results 
The results of the thematic analysis indicated eight main 
challenges, as described below:  
1) A1- Lack of funding and financial support:  
Finding sufficient financial support was considered to be 
one of the main issues for software startups in the KSA. 
Company A stated, “Providing the needed funding was one 
of our main concerns, you need to make sure you have 
enough cash flow.” Company B reported that “one of our 
main challenges was to have enough funds to start our 
project. We made many meetings with investors and 
investment companies but, unfortunately, we could not have 
any financial collaboration with them. In addition, the 
government’s financial support programmes were not 
sufficient and not available in many cases.” Companies C 
and D both agreed that the funding challenge was one of the 
main challenges for their projects.  
2) A2- Difficulty of gaining customers’ trust and access 
to the market: 
Company B, which was an online store, reported that 
“gaining customers’ trust was one of the main challenges; 
first, it is a challenge to have people sell their product using 
our on-line store and secondly, it is also a challenge to have 
people buy from our on-line store.” Company C stated, “It is 
a big challenge to access the market; we had our biggest 
challenge when we tried to sell our product.” Company D 
also reported that signing the first contract was the biggest 
challenge. Company E mentioned that it had experienced 
tremendous competition with social media stores and that it 
was difficult to compete with them in terms of cost.  
3) A3- Making a product that suited the market: 
Company A said that one difficulty was creating a 
product that did not suit the current market. The company 
cited the example of having had a product “website” that 
worked on meta search technologies and failing to sell it to 
the market because the market was not ready to use this 
technology to compare hotel prices at the time. Thus, their 
product was too far ahead of the current market. A few years 
later, a different company developed and launched an almost 
identical product and experienced a huge success.  
4) A4- Lack of transparency and market information: 
Company C reported that access to information and data 
were also major obstacles, citing difficulty when developing 
a business model due to the lack of transparency in the 
software market.  
5) A5- Government barriers: 
Company E reported issues with the government’s 
regulations because many steps and complicated processes 
are required in order to open a software startup. 
6) A6- Access to talent: 
According to Company C, graduates with degrees in 
software were not qualified to be professionals in the 
software market, and there was a lack of Saudi talent in the 
market. Company D’s CEO, who is also a professor at one of 
the larger universities in the Kingdom within the software 
field, reported a need to create partnerships between colleges 
and software companies to improve the quality of colleges’ 
graduate student outcomes. Company E reported a lack of 
75
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2018.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-668-2
ICSEA 2018 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

expert graduates in the field of software development 
management and that no courses covering the concepts of 
“lean” or “agile” were offered in academic programs.  
Company B used outsourced teams due to the lack of 
software developers in Saudi Arabia, which created other 
barriers in terms of language and cultural differences. 
7) A7- 
Lack 
of 
clear 
ideas 
about 
customer 
requirements: 
According to Company C, people do not have sufficient 
understanding regarding what software could do for their 
businesses. In addition, customers sometimes did not have a 
clear idea of their requirements. For example, many 
customers asked the company to compare their competitors’ 
websites and make better websites for their companies 
without providing a clear idea of their requirements.   
V. 
DISCUSSION 
This section will combine the results of the descriptive 
analysis (quantitative results) and the results of the thematic 
analysis (qualitative results). It will provide a general 
discussion about the challenges in light of previous studies. 
The challenges will be classified into two main groups. Table 
IX shows the links between the study’s results. It also 
organizes the challenges into two main groups. The first 
group contains challenges related to finance and market 
access, and the second is for software quality challenges.

A. Funding and transparency   
1) Lack of transparency 
The quantitative results revealed the lack of information 
and transparency in the software market in Saudi Arabia 
(CH1) as one of the main challenges within the market. 
Startups need information and transparency in order to build 
their business models and develop strategies. The qualitative 
data supported this: (A4) “Lack of transparency and market 
information.”  
2)  Lack of funding and financial support  
The first challenge that software startups face is finding 
funding resources. This barrier was revealed to be one of the 
main issues according to the quantitative results (CH6), and 
it was also revealed to be the main concern in the qualitative 
results. An investigation about the startup industry in 
Australia reported that around 67% of startups needed 
financial support to survive until their second year of 
business, and about 41% of the startups investigated had 
difficulty with funding [29]. Gilardino et al. [16] reported the 
challenge of not having initial funding for startups.  
3) Government regulations  
The government’s regulations were reported as a 
challenge for software startups (CH4 and A5). When 
establishing a new company, there are many regulations that 
make the task difficult for startups. Gilardino et al. [16] 
reported the same issue and agreed that government 
regulations need to be addressed during software startups’ 
development phases.  
4) Obstacles of market access 
Accessing the market is the second phase for startups. 
There are barriers to accessing the market (CH7). Startups 
will experience challenges in gaining customers’ trust (A2). 
They have no history and not enough experience. Customers 
usually prefer to work with big software names rather than 
with small, newly established software companies (CH8). In 
addition, due to a lack of experience, the software startups 
could have difficulty providing a product that suits the 
market (A3). Finally, providing products at competitive 
prices is a challenge (CH2). Gilardino et al. [16] referred to 
acquiring the first paying client as one of the main obstacles 
for software startups. Klonowski et al. [19] mentioned that 
identifying the available opportunities in the software market 
was not an easy task due to changes in the clients’ 
requirements and technological uncertainty. Furthermore, the 
market should be accessed in a time-efficient way [19]. 
B. Software quality and awareness 
1) Lack of quality software and talent 
Providing high-quality software was a challenge due to 
the development team’s capabilities (CH3). The startups had 
limited resources, which decreased their development 
capabilities. They usually had problems with building a 
sufficient business model (CH9). Furthermore, access to 
talent was a major challenge due to the lack of talent in the 
software industry in Saudi Arabia (CH10 and A6). Gilardino 
et al. [16] identified the general lack of resources as one of 
the main features of startups. Software startups use external 
solutions to address the limitations of their resources, such as 
outsourcing and open-source software [18]. The use of new 
concepts in software, such as agile methods, is poor, which 
could reflect on the quality of the software developed [2].   
2) Lack of clears idea about customer requirements 
Software startups are challenged by the lack of software 
awareness on the part of their customers (A7). Customers are 
not aware of how software could add value to their 
businesses (CH5). They are uncertain about paying for a 
software service because they are not sure how this service 
could improve their businesses. Furthermore, customers 
often lack a clear idea of their requirements.

3) Lack of communication and visibility 
The results from the quantitative data showed the lack of 
communication and collaboration during all stages of 
development (CH12). The visibility level of the development 
progress was low (CH13). Moreover, there was a lack of 
communication between the developers and the product 
owners (CH14). The quantitative data revealed that about 
88% of software projects had outsourced or offshore teams. 
The distance among teams affects the visibility level of 
development. The lack of communication could create 
barriers for customers when attempting to follow the 
progress of development and could make it difficult for 
developers to communicate with customers. Therefore, this 
could decrease the visibility of development [26]. Providing 
a high-quality communication channel could be expensive 
and add substantial costs to the project. Sometimes the 
development teams, particularly those offshore, experienced 
technical issues such as poor Internet connection or poor 
infrastructure. As a result, the cost of communication could 
be increased [35]. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The software startup industry in Saudi Arabia was 
investigated in this study. This paper applied a mixed-
method approach to collect both quantitative and qualitative 
data. The lack of transparency and funding can be considered 
to be the biggest concern. There is a lack of available 
information about the IT industry, including the size of the 
market and the existing companies in the market. In addition, 
the government’s regulations limited the startups and created 
serious difficulties in terms of their business models and 
plans. The second major difficulty experienced by software 
startups was access to the market. For a company with no 
history, gaining customers’ trust was considered a major 
challenge. Customers also lack software awareness and are 
not aware of how the software can help them to grow their 
businesses. Furthermore, there is a lack of quality software 
and 
talent. 
Accessing 
talented 
people 
in 
software 
development in Saudi Arabia is one of the main issues for 
the startups. This has an impact on the software’s quality and 
leads many startups to outsource development or to develop 
software offshore, which is a common practice in software 
development. However, this could create a lack of 
communication and decrease the visibility level of 
development.  
In summary, this study reported on the main challenges 
experienced by software startups in Saudi Arabia, and 
provided a general investigation into the software industry in 
order to provide a better understanding of the phenomenon 
of software startups. This information could be useful for the 
Saudi government to improve their regulations to support 
software development industry. The first recommendation of 
this study is to establish funding channels, either by the 
government or the private sector. The current regulations 
need to be updated to attract more investments to the 
industry. Moreover, it is important to update the current 
software curricula in universities and computer colleges to 
provide more qualified developers to the community.  
Future work will investigate the relationship between the 
challenges described and other factors affecting success in 
the software industry (such as cost, quality and time) in order 
to identify the factors for success in the Saudi software 
industry.
