Abstract—This paper presents an investigation of factors
that are likely to affect the security of an organization, in
particular, the number of security incidents. Using Intrusion
Prevention Systems (IPS) data, provided by the University
of Maryland, we derive three potential factors (attackers,
corrupted computers and attack types) and their respective
measurements. Based on empirical studies and information
security literature, we examine the effects of selected factors
on the number of security incidents. We use a regression model
to test the hypotheses empirically and also to study how those
factors are affected over time. We found that the number
of potential corrupted computers is positively related to the
security incidents while the number of potential attackers and
range of attack types does not signiﬁcantly affect the number
of security incidents. We also found empirical evidence that
factors could signiﬁcantly change over time.

I. INTRODUCTION
In information security, questions such as “Is security
improving over time?” and “Are we using effective con-
trols?” could be used to derive measurements to facilitate
decision making and improve performance and account-
ability. Researchers have been trying to measure security
using models from other disciplines such as economics, risk,
reliability engineering and statistics. However, as pointed out
by Jansen [1] much of what has been written about security
quantiﬁcation is deﬁnitional, aimed at providing guidelines
for deﬁning a security metric and specifying criteria for
which to achieve.
Currently, there are many suggestions in the security
community for what measures organizations should collect
in order to construct security measurement models [2], [3]
and [4]. However, as noted by Verendel [5], for most cases
it is unknown if the proposed models are valid or not in
representing security for systems in realistic environments
due to the lack of validation and comparison between such
methods against empirical data. In other words, little work
has been done to determine the value of these measures in
real-world operational environments [6]. Research is needed
to validate connections between measures and security, and
determine and understand possible correlations.
In this paper, we study connections between metrics
derived from intrusion prevention system (IPS) alert events
and the number of security incidents. The number of security
incidents is an important security indicator that in combina-
tion with other metrics can indicate the level of threats and
effectiveness of security controls.
Since security incidents may be the result of several
factors, from a computer infected with a virus to successful
attacks against servers, our aim is to investigate some of
these factors that could be derived from Intrusion Prevention
Systems (IPS) data. We empirically examine, using a multi-
ple linear regression model, the effects of potential attackers,
potential corrupted computers and attack signatures on the
number of security incidents reported by the Ofﬁce of
Information Technology (OIT) at the University of Maryland
[7]. We also analyze how those factors are affected over
time.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the
background on security incidents and intrusion prevention
systems. Section 3 introduces our hypotheses about the
relationship between factors and the number of security in-
cidents. Section 4 presents the empirical modeling approach
and the regression results. Section 5 discusses the threats to
validity of our study. We provide conclusions and directions
for future work in Section 6.
II. BACKGROUND
This section describes the background on security inci-
dents, intrusion prevention systems and security quantiﬁca-
tion that we will use in this paper.
A. Security Incidents
A security incident, according to the Center for Internet
Security [2], results in the actual outcomes of a business pro-
104

cess deviating from expected outcomes for conﬁdentiality,
integrity, and availability resulting from people, process, or
technology deﬁciencies or failures. There are many interact-
ing factors that affect the occurrence of a computer security
incident, for instance, virus, vulnerabilities, characteristics of
the population being attacked, distribution and prevalence of
vulnerable operating systems and applications and intensity
of attacks [8], [9]. Examining the factors that could lead to
security incidents is important to improve forecasting and
also to identify conditions which may result in the spread
of new incident types.
Security incidents may be reported using operational
security systems sources, such as anti-malware software and
intrusion detection systems (IDS), host logs and also reports
from users. In this work we are interested in studying the
number of security incidents.
The number of security incidents indicates the number of
detected security incidents that the organization has experi-
enced during a time period. However, the use of this metric
should be properly examined to avoid misinterpretation of
data. In combination with other metrics, the number of
security incidents can indicate the level of threats, incident
detection capabilities and effectiveness of security controls
and can be used as a security indicator of an organization.
Understanding which factors are likely to affect the number
of security incidents could begin to paint a picture of system
security.
B. Intrusion Prevention Systems
An IPS is considered as an extension of an IDS that mon-
itors malicious activity and reacts in real time by blocking
a potential attack [10]. An IDS is a passive device that
monitors activity whereas an IPS is an active device that
blocks the potential malicious activity.
The investigated IPS device is a signature-based IPS
where the blocking decision relies on a set of signatures that
are regularly released by the vendor as attacks are newly dis-
covered on the Internet. Basically, when the characteristics
of an attack match the ones of a deﬁned signature, the attack
is blocked and an alert is recorded.
Based on the data provided by the IPS, it is possible to
derive metrics to assess the volume and the nature of the
malicious activity. For instance, a set of metrics that includes
the number of alerts, number of distinct targets, number of
distinct IPS signatures and number of blocked attackers was
proposed by [11].
C. Security Quantiﬁcation
The ISO/IEC 27004 [12] standard includes speciﬁc guide-
lines about information security measurement such as: mea-
sures and measurement development, measurement opera-
tion, data analysis and measurement results reporting, and
also a template on which to describe a metric.
Jansen [1] provides an overview of the security metrics
area and look at possible avenues of research that could be
pursued to advance the state of the art. The author states
that much of what has been written about security metrics
is deﬁnitional, aimed at providing guidelines for deﬁning a
security metric and specifying criteria for which to achieve.
However, relatively little has been reported on actual metrics
that have been proven useful in practice.
Condon et al. [8], [9] describe the application of time
series models and software reliability models on computer
security incidents. They found that certain incidents are
caused by well-deﬁned vulnerabilities and might easily
patched against but others may exhibit propagation behavior
similar to contagious diseases in animals or still can result
from economic incentives external to an organization or
environment.
Considering other empirical analysis about security mea-
surement, Chrun et al. [11] presents a method that ranks
potentially corrupted computers using security metrics de-
rived from imperfect IPS event data. However, nothing was
said about the relationship between corrupted computers and
computer security incidents.
Cukier and Panjwani [13] conducted an empirical analysis
to quantify the link between vulnerabilities and malicious
connections. They conclude that a high number of vulnera-
bilities on services do not necessarily imply a high number
of malicious connections or successful attacks.
This study can be used as motivation to investigate another
relevant security issues such as: does the high number
of attacks on networks imply a high number of security
incidents? Does the high number of corrupted computers
on networks imply a high number of security incidents?
Our work focuses on extracting empirical relationships
between IPSs and computer security incidents datasets and
also how to use these results to improve the knowledge about
system security.
III. RESEARCH HYPOTHESES
In this section, we investigate the relationship between the
selected factors and their impact on the number of computer
security incidents. From this investigation, we formulate
hypotheses to guide us in the study.
A. Attackers
From models that predict the likelihood of burglary or
other conventional crimes, it has been demonstrated that
parameters such as a motivated offender, a suitable victim
and the absence of a motivated guardian can have a major
effect on the probability of crime [14].
In information security, the same analogy is hard to
achieve. According to Schechter [15], the number of po-
tential attackers is likely to be positively correlated with the
rate of security breaches and the resulting security risk. In
addition to that, certain variables such as means, motive and
105

SECURWARE 2012 : The Sixth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

opportunity to attack, may also inﬂuences the number of
potential attackers.
As pointed out by Chrun [16], the three major attacker’s
characteristics which inﬂuence on security are motivation,
qualities and expertise. For this reason, it is difﬁcult to
predict that the number of attackers increases the number of
incidents, for example. Besides, an attack could be initiated
from an external or internal source and insiders do not
generally demonstrate the same attack pattern that external
attackers do [17].
With this in mind, we propose the following alternate pairs
of exploratory hypotheses: i) H1(a) The number of attackers
increases the number of security incidents and ii) H1(b) The
number of attackers does not increase the number of security
incidents.
B. Attack signatures
According to Chrun et al. [10], analyzing the range of
attack types that target an organization might help the
security team identifying popular attack types and making
decisions for their network security. With this in mind, it is
reasonable to assume that the number of attack signatures
is a factor that might be linked to the number of security
incidents.
In the simplest case, we can say that an increase in
the number of attack signatures might be linked to the
number of incidents due to the higher number of attack
types that should be handled by the organization. We can
also consider the severity of attack signatures. IPS vendors
usually classify each attack signature based on the impact of
attack on the network. More severe attacks could represent
more security incidents. However, attack signatures may
have limited impact on the number of security incidents
due to the way that organizations react to different attack
types. In other words it is difﬁcult to predict that the number
of attack signatures increases the number of incidents, for
example.
Therefore, we propose the following alternate pairs of
hypotheses, also considering the severity of signatures: i)
H2(a) The number of attack signatures increases the number
of security incidents, ii) H2(b) The number of attack signa-
tures does not increase the number of security incidents,
iii) H3(a) The severity of attack signatures increases the
number of security incidents and iv) H3(b) The severity of
attack signatures does not increase the number of security
incidents.
C. Corrupted computers
A corrupted computer is a potential source of attack inside
an organization. Malwares, computer viruses, worms and
even unpatched applications are some feasible causes for
computer corruption.
The relationship between corrupted computers and secu-
rity incidents could be depicted using computer security data
breach reports. A study conducted by Verizon [18] using 141
breach cases, revealed that 38% of studied security incidents
were caused by a computer corrupted by malware. Other
study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers [19] using the
survey data of 539 respondent organizations showed that
14% of incidents were caused by viruses or malicious soft-
ware corruption. Besides that, 23% was caused by systems
failure or data corruption which could also involve corrupted
computers.
A similar survey [20] based on the responses of 351
computer security practitioners in U.S. corporations, govern-
ment agencies, ﬁnancial institutions, medical institutions and
universities, revealed that 67.1% of studied incidents were
provoked by malware corruption. Despite the differences
between the studies, the rate at which corrupted computers
affected the investigated attacks could be considered signif-
icant.
In face of these ﬁndings we propose the following hypoth-
esis: H4(a) The number of corrupted computers increases the
number of security incidents.
IV. EMPIRICAL MODELING APPROACH
This section presents the description of the dataset and
our empirical modeling approach.
A. Data and measurements
The dataset provided by the University of Maryland
consisted of over 2615 security incidents and 6.687.874.770
IPS alerts recorded during a period of four years and four
months (from September 4, 2006 to December 31, 2010).
The data were grouped in a weekly basis (t = 226 weeks),
with Monday as the ﬁrst day of the week. Grouping the data
in a time window is a technique to minimize the effects of
lag time between occurrence of an event and submission of
an incident report. However, due to the human interaction
in the incident reporting process, we cannot prove that an
incident reported in certain week would have been related
to IPS alerts from the same week.
The incidents dataset also included 21 different incident
types. Only one type called “nethicsreq” was removed from
the dataset. It represents the identiﬁcation of an illegal use
of copyrighted material like music and movies. This kind of
incident cannot be detected by the IPS and, therefore, is out
of scope of our investigation.
The IPS is located at the edge of the organization so
it cannot detect trafﬁc originating inside the organization
and targeting computers inside the organization. This dataset
includes two cases, represented by Figure 1: 1) where a com-
puter outside the organization is targeting the organization,
and 2) where a computer inside the organization is targeting
computers outside the organization.
Chrun et al. [11] proposed metrics for both cases. When
the organization is the target (case 1), the following metrics
were proposed: number of alerts, number of distinct targets,
106

number of distinct IPS signatures, number of alerts per
target and number of attackers per target. When focusing on
the trafﬁc originating inside the organization and targeting
computers outside the organization (case 2), the following
metrics were proposed: number of alerts, number of distinct
attackers, number of distinct IPS signatures, number of alerts
per attacker and number of targets per attackers. We derive
the investigated factors (attackers, corrupted computers and
attack signatures) from these two sets of metrics.
We derive the number of security incidents (denoted as It,
t = 1, . . . , 226) from the provided incidents dataset and the
number of potential attackers, attack signatures and potential
corrupted computers from the provided IPS alerts database.
We consider the number of potential attackers in this study
as the number of distinct external blocked attackers (denoted
as At, t = 1, . . . , 226) in the IPS as showed in case 1.
The number of attack signatures is extracted using two
measures, one from case 1, the number of distinct signatures
from external attackers (denoted as V et, t = 1, . . . , 226),
and one from case 2, the number of distinct signatures from
internal attackers (denoted as Sit, t = 1, . . . , 226). In this
way it is possible to estimate the attack types associated
with computers that are being exploited by external attackers
and also the attack types associated with computers that are
being used to launch attacks against external targets. The
same applies for the severity of a attack signature where
the severity level of a signature is classiﬁed by the vendor
in three levels: critical (denoted as SCet and SCit), major
(denoted as SMet and SMit) and minor (denoted as SNet
and SNit).
The number of potential corrupted computers could be
measured using two metrics from the IPS dataset: number
of distinct targets in case 1 (denoted as Cet, t = 1, . . . , 226)
and the number of distinct internal blocked attackers, showed
in case 2 (denoted as Cit, t = 1, . . . , 226).
In case 1, it is clear that the number of distinct targets
reﬂects the number of targeted computers and thus poten-
tially corrupted computers. The number of distinct internal
blocked attackers in case 2 could be seen in two different
ways: if a computer inside the organization is launching
an attack, it might the result of a willing attacker who
launches an attack, or it may be due to an already corrupted
computer launching attacks. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that the number of external targets and the number of
internal attackers could be used to approximate the number
of corrupted computers on a network. Table I presents the
descriptive statistics of these variables.
B. Empirical Modeling
In order to investigate how the variables deﬁned in the
previous section might be linked to the number of security
incidents, we built a multiple linear regression model. Our
dependent variable is the weekly number of incidents It
and the independent variables are At, Cet, Cit, Set, SCet,
SMet, SNet, Sit, SCit, SMit and SNit. The general
notation of the multiple regression functions can be written
as:
It = β0 +
j
X
k=1
βkXk + ǫt
(1)
where β0 is the constant term, β1 to βj are the coefﬁcients
on the jth independent variable, j is the total number of
independent variables, ǫt the error term and Xk represents
the set of independent variables that could include At, Cet,
Cit, Set, SCet, SMet, SNet, Sit, SCit, SMit, SNit.
In a multiple linear regression model, we assume that the
relationship between the variables is linear and the error
terms are distributed normally.
With a multiple linear regression model, it is possible
to detect the effect of the independent variables on the
dependent variable using a variable selection approach, that
is, the screening of the candidate variables to obtain a regres-
sion model that contains the ‘best” subset of independent
variables [21]. The main idea is to select the independent
variables, run the regression model and study its signiﬁcance
through the p-value obtained in each variable. Further infor-
mation about variable selection in multiple linear regression
models can be found in [22] and [23].
Our goal is to investigate the effects of attackers, attack
signatures and corrupted computers on the number of secu-
rity incidents using several variables. Therefore, we propose
ﬁve different regression models in order to investigate the
differences between using the number of attack signatures or
the severity of attack signatures, and also analyze the impact
of each single severity level.
In the ﬁrst model, we analyze the number of attackers,
attack signatures and corrupted computers. In the second
model we exclude the number of signatures, in order to
analyze the signature severity levels. In models 3, 4, 5 we
analyze the impact of each severity level. Model 3 includes
only the critical attack signatures, model 4 includes only the
major attack signatures and the model 5 includes only the
minor attack signatures. Table II summarizes the regression
models and results.
We noticed that in all proposed regression models, the
weekly number of attackers, At, cannot signiﬁcantly affect

the number of security incidents, supporting H1(b). Accord-
ing to our previous discussion, attacker’s characteristics such
as motivation, expertise and qualities inﬂuence the number
of potential attackers. Our results suggest that we cannot use
the number of attackers as an indicator of security incidents.
Besides that, we may also need to develop metrics to help
characterize the attacker in order to reﬁne the attacker’s
dataset. It may be necessary to study characteristics such as
attacker geographical origin, time of attack, targets and type
of attack to create a subset of possible relevant attackers.
According to Table II, the Model 1 shows that the number
of attack signatures, represented by Sit and Set, cannot sig-
niﬁcantly affect the number of security incidents, supporting
H2(b) and also consistent with the results presented in [13].
While the number of attack signatures may be used to ﬁnd
corrupted computers [10] and reveals the range of attack
types that target the organization, they are not related to the
number of security incidents.
This fact can be due to the limitation of signature-based
devices. The detection of new attacks in such devices depend
on how fast the vendor will provide new signatures for them.
In other words, new attacks will not be detected nor blocked
and such unblocked attacks may be the origin of some
security incidents, decreasing the impact of attack signatures
on security incidents.
Regarding the severity of signatures, none of the distinct
signatures from external attackers (SCet, SMet, SNet)
signiﬁcantly affect the number of security incidents.
The same thing occur with the distinct signatures from
internal attackers (SMit, SNit), except with the critical
signatures from internal attackers, SCit, that signiﬁcantly
affect the number of security incidents, as seen in models 2
and 3. Thus, we conclude that only critical signatures asso-
ciated with computers from the organization that are being
used to launch attacks against external attackers impact the
number of security incidents, supporting H3(a), that is, the
severity of attack signatures increases the number of security
incidents.
Across all these ﬁve models, we found that the number
of external targets, Cet, signiﬁcantly impacts the number
of security incidents. The other metric related to corrupted
computers, number of internal attackers, Cit, signiﬁcantly
impacts the number of security incidents in models 1, 4 and
5, according to the severity of attack signatures.
In cases where the number of internal critical signatures is
considered, the internal attackers are not signiﬁcantly. Thus,
hypothesis H4(a) is supported. In other words, the more cor-
rupted computers, the more frequent the security incidents.
Thus, in our case, the number of corrupted computers could
be used as an indicator of security incidents.
The results also reveal that the impact of internal threats,
such as the number of internal attackers and the number of
internal critical signatures (Cit and SCit), on the number
of security incidents are more signiﬁcant than the external
threats, such as external attackers and signatures (At, SCet,
SMet, SNet). This result may indicate that external threats

do not impact the number of security incidents or that
the reported security incidents are not reﬂecting the actual
external threats.
Using the same datasets, we can also study the behavior
of the factors over time. Since attacks could change over
time, it is reasonable to assume that the metrics should also
change in order to follow the new trends.
As pointed out by [6], cyber technology is so dynamic
that the meaning of metrics changes over time. There may
be additional factors that inﬂuence the signiﬁcance of the
measure, as well as different relative importance for the
existing factors [6]. Therefore, we investigate the variables
over two periods of time: 2007-2008 and 2009-2010. We
decide to exclude the four months of 2006 in order to
preserve the entire year. We also chose the aggregation of
two years in each analysis to maintain an acceptable number
of observations per dataset (105 per dataset). Tables III and
IV summarize the regression results.

Analyzing the Tables III and IV, we can note that in
both datasets the number of attackers and the number of
signatures cannot signiﬁcantly affect the number of security
incidents, the same as in the previous analysis.
Regarding the differences between the two periods, in
2007-2008 the number of external targets, reﬂecting the
potentially number of corrupted computers, signiﬁcantly
impacts the number of security incidents. However, the other
metric related to corrupted computers, number of internal
attackers, does not signiﬁcantly affect the number of security
incidents as showed in the analysis with the entire dataset.
This metric became signiﬁcant only in the next period,
2009-2010, showing that the effects of measures changes
over time. This may be due to several factors as the increase
or decrease of these metrics or changes in the reported type

of security incidents. In other words, the measurement con-
text is very important to improve the accuracy of measures
and metrics and also to develop new metrics.
C. Discussions
Currently, there are many recommendations in the security
metrics literature for what measures organizations should
gather. However, as noted by Black [6], little work has been
done to determine the value of these measures in real-world
environments, including which measures are most supportive
of particular metrics.
Our ﬁndings show that, in our case, IPS metrics might
be linked to the number of security incidents. Based on the
investigated hypothesis the following results were achieved:
i) the number of attackers does not increase the number
of security incidents, ii) the number of attack signatures
does not increase the number of security incidents, iii)
the severity of attack signatures increases the number of
security incidents and iv) the number of corrupted computers
increases the number of security incidents.
The number of attackers, number of attack signatures
and severity of external attackers does not signiﬁcantly
affect the number of security incidents. Since there are
some characteristics of attackers that might inﬂuence the
rate at which a system is attacked, ﬁnding metrics that
characterize attackers is a possible avenue to research, in
order to understand the type of attackers that affects the
number of security incidents.
A practical implication of the results could be the develop-
ment of automated tools to analyze the relationship between
IPS data and security measurements. Such tools would be
used by the security team, as a ﬁrst step towards under-
standing the organization’s overall security posture. Another
implication is the study of IPS metrics to build security

incident prediction models. For example, evaluating whether
the number of attackers, signatures and corrupted computers
are predictive of security incidents. If so, security analysts
can use this prediction to prioritize security inspection and
to implement preventive measures.
Our study indicates that more than one signiﬁcant IPS
metric might be derived from the dataset. This ﬁnding
suggests the use of different metrics instead of ﬁnding a
single security metric. In other words, as noted by [24],
since security is a set of attributes, we should also use a set
of metrics for measuring it. In combination, metrics could
begin to paint a picture of system security.
The results also provide indications that metrics behavior
change over time. Given the dynamic nature of information
security, it is not certain that events of the past will provide a
trustworthy prediction to the future, since attackers actively
work to change the threat environment. Therefore, security
metrics must be able to reﬂect signiﬁcant changes in the
underlying assumptions about how the system changes over
time.
Our ﬁndings might be restricted to networks like those
of universities: with nodes that are not fully controlled by
the IT department. Private organizations, for instance, have
different concerns about information security. The way that
the security perimeter of a university is secured is completely
different from a private company. Therefore, a similar study,
when conducted in such organizations, could show different
results.
Finally, we studied the relationship between IPS data
and security incidents, but, similar research could be con-
ducted between another security data, for instance, security
incidents and ﬁrewall logs, intrusion detection systems and
network ﬂow data and so on.
V. THREATS TO VALIDITY
The incidents used in our study were reported based on
three sources of events: i) an IDS, ii) reports from users and
iii) reports from other system administrators. Since recorded
incidents led to the blocking of the suspected computer’s IP
address, the University Ofﬁce of Information Technology
(OIT) veriﬁed the authenticity of each incident. As a result,
all incidents obtained from these sources were manually
reviewed. OIT launched port scans and packet captures to
validate the suspicious behavior of identiﬁed hosts. Because
of the method used by OIT to validate the incidents, we can
assume that all incidents used in our work are real. Thus,
there are no false positives among the incidents reported.
However, we cannot quantify the number of undetected
attacks and intrusions that did not lead to a security incident.
The main issue with IPS event data is that the collected
data are not perfect [10]. In other words, collected data
might contain false positives and might not detect some
malicious activity (false negatives). Moreover, since the IPS
is a signature-based device, new attacks will not be detected
nor blocked.
We have not evaluated the IPS and thus do not know how
many false positives and false negatives the IPS produces.
Besides, we cannot prove that a blocked attack would have
been damaging to the targeted computer. In particular, for
an attack to be successful, the targeted computer should
have the associated vulnerability. We have scanned several
computers for which an IPS alert was raised and noticed
that in many cases the vulnerability associated with the alert
was not present. This means that even without the IPS, the
attack would not have been successful. This also indicates
that the IPS identiﬁes and detects an attack in its early
stage preferring to block attacks that would not have been
successful instead of not blocking a potentially successful
attack.
As with all empirical studies, our results are limited to
the datasets we investigated. In order to generalize our
observations from this study to other environments, further
studies should be performed.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we investigated some factors that might be
linked to the rate at which security is successfully breached
and empirically examine how attackers, attack signatures and
corrupted computers affect the number of security incidents
of an organization. We use two datasets, security incidents
and IPS alerts, provided by the University of Maryland to
derive our measurements.
Our results reveal that from the set of 11 investigated
variables, 3 of them are positively related to the number of
security incidents: the number of external targets, number
of internal attackers, and the number of critical signatures
of attacks launched from computers inside the organization.
Since the number of external targets and internal attackers
are related to the number of potential corrupted computers in
an organization, the following hypotheses were supported:
• The number of attackers does not increase the number
of security incidents;
• The number of attack signatures does not increase the
number of security incidents;
• The severity of attack signatures increases the number
of security incidents;
• The number of corrupted computers increases the num-
ber of security incidents.
We also found empirical evidence that relevant metrics
changes over time. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
idea that the security of the overall system cannot be
ensured using only a single metric. Since security is a set
of attributes, measuring security implies the usage of a set
of metrics.
Future research should be conducted to compare the
results presented in this work. It would be useful to repeat

the analysis for some other datasets and investigate the dif-
ferences between them. For instance, since attack signatures
could be associated with certain security vulnerabilities,
it would be interesting to investigate whether severity of
security vulnerabilities follows the pattern found in our
study.
Additional research may be also conducted to evaluate
the impact of security factors over other variables, such as
network topology and certain security incidents categories.
Understanding which factors are likely to affect the security
of a network can help network security analysts extract
relevant information about the organization security.
