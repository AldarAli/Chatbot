Abstract—This 
paper 
introduces 
and 
demonstrates 
appropriate and realistic modelling approaches for smart 
microgrids, with a focus on local energy balance. There is an 
increasing interest in microgrids, as the nature of large-scale 
electricity generation and distribution changes, with a 
conscious shift to more sustainable and renewable energy 
sources. However, the modelling and design techniques 
traditionally used have tended to be based on economics and 
design criteria more suited to the top-down planning for power 
generation and distribution typical of legacy grids, than to 
bottom-up energy balance incorporating localised distributed 
generation and storage, significant characteristics of these new 
systems. Several aspects of microgrid design and specification 
are modelled using an example based on an installation 
incorporating solar photovoltaic panels and battery storage. 
Important features of each of the models shown are the 
associated 
visualisations, 
which 
lead 
to 
improved 
understanding of design implications, compromises, and 
consequences, and the true context of a renewable-energy 
based microgrid.

 INTRODUCTION  
There are recent significant shifts of interest to new 
renewable 
energy 
sources, 
as 
concerns 
relating 
to 
greenhouse gas emmisions, climate change, and finite fossil 
fuel resources grow [1][2]. The electricity supply industry 
world-wide has been characterised for the past 100 years by 
national and international grids, operated with the goal of 
balancing power generation with demand in real-time [3]. 
The industry has become very skilled and adept at managing 
this challenge, and it is this which has determined the 
complexities, the risks, and the costs, of present day power 
systems [3]. In this context, longer term seasonal variations 
in energy demand have generally been accomodated by 
ensuring sufficient reserves of energy are held – fossil fuels 
in the case of oil, gas and coal systems, water in the case of 
hydro systems. The design and management of such systems 
can be characterised as one of top-down planning of power 
generation, driven by economic considerations, load 
anticipation, resource availability, and the need for grid-wide 
security of supply. 
But also fueled by those environmental concerns and 
rapidly advancing technology,  dramatic changes are 
occuring through the combination of new renewable energy 
sources (solar, wind, tidal), energy storage technologies (at 
this stage mainly batteries), and automation systems, which 
enable 
effective 
and 
tolerable 
distributed 
load 
matching/shifting. Two specific technologies – solar 
photovoltaics (PV) and lithium batteries – are of particular 
interest because they lend themselves to a significant degree 
of distribution, which coupled with load matching/shifting 
technology in microgrids [4], challenges many of the notions 
of the traditional, or legacy, grid [5]-[8]. Concerns with long-
distance hierarchal/radial energy transfer and real-time load 
following from centralised generating systems, grow less and 
less relevant and appropriate when microgrids, with their 
highly distributed generation, storage, and load management, 
become more prevalent [3][9][10]. 
New renewables in themselves bring challenges under 
the traditional model, since their contributions tend to be 
non-deterministic and variable, so adding further complexity 
to that real-time load-following approach. However, when 
such generation is combined with short-term storage, and 
located close to the point of consumption, then these 
technologies have the potential to radically change the nature 
of the grid in the longer term [3]. Although the integration of 
renewable sources into the legacy grid has been the subject 
of much research, discussion and debate [11][12], to fit with 
the on-demand delivery and economic models, typical 
renewables require significant, and unrealistic, energy 
storage capacity. A range of storage concepts have been 
explored, including the exploitation of electric vehicle 
batteries (V2G) [13], but for centralised renewable 
generation, such as wind or solar farms, the distributed 
nature of such storage in contrast to the generation, places 
increased energy transfer demands on the grid. 
However, microgrids have the potential to lead to an 
entirely fresh approach to planning, a bottom-up technique 
based on localised energy balance, maximising the balance 
between local generation and local load, and minimising the 
dependence and impact on the remote resources of the grid. 
The effect then of such an installation on the legacy grid is 
not so much one of increased non-deterministic generation 
capacity, but one of reduced load. Coupled with this 
approach go a new set of imperatives for consumers, typified 
by a growing bourgeois off-grid population; a great deal can 
be learned from the experience and motivations of these 
people, in terms of shifted demands and expectations, and 
modified behaviour [14][15].

This paper explores design approaches to smart 
microgrids based on energy-balance techniques, and shows 
how such perspectives result in and project far more realistic 
specifications and expectations, and can be presented in such 
a manner that leads to a better understanding of the design 
compromises, and that will in turn lead to a more enlightened 
next-generation grid development.  
Section II introduces a representative microgrid example, 
which is then used in Section III to explain the Net Zero 
Energy Balance concept, and the strengths and weaknesses 
associated with that concept. Discussion in Section IV turns 
to the implications of non-deterministic generation, and to 
the limitations of the short-term storage typified by batteries. 
Finally, in Section V, the paper develops an argument for 
reducing grid dependency in such installations, and 
introduces and explains the Grid-lite concept. 
II. 
A REPRESENTATIVE MICROGRID INSTALLATION 
The data and graphs used in this paper are based on a 
representative residential installation located in New 
Zealand, at approximately -38° lattitude. Real electricity 
consumption data for a family home, at hourly intervals, has 
been captured over a year. The analysis explores the effect of 
local generation. For this purpose, a real data set using actual 
solar radiation at this location, at hourly intervals over a year, 
combined 
with 
characteristics 
of 
a 
representative 
contemporary PV panel, has been used [16]. Different parts 
of the following analyses assume different configurations in 
relation to the grid. However, the energy balance 
terminology that is used in relation to the energy flows 
between the major functional components of the system is 
shown in Figure 1. While the inclusion of the battery flows 
in both the local consumption and local generation totals 
may appear to account for the stored energy twice, this is 
necessary in order to examine flows over short time scales, 
where in one interval the battery may be charging, and in 
another, discharging, using energy produced in the previous 
interval [17]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Energy flows within the smart microgrid, and the definitions of 
local generation and local consumption. 
For this example installation, the total annual electricity 
consumption is 6.446 MWh, equating to a daily average of 
17.661 kWh, and an hourly average of 736 Wh. Many of the 
subsequent figures in the  paper use normalised values; these 
have been normalised to the relevant load figure, be it 
annual, daily or hourly, as indicated in the axis labels. 
III. 
NET ZERO ENERGY BALANCE (NETZEB) 
A useful starting point in considering smart, renewable-
energy based microgrids is the concept of Net-Zero Energy 
Buildings [18][19], buildings with an annual total energy 
consumption of zero. The total energy used over a year is 
equal to the total renewable energy generated on the site. A 
NetZEB buiding is by necessity a grid connected one, since 
it is the annual balance which is of concern, and to 
accomodate short-term (hourly or daily) or even seasonal 
variations in balance between generation and load, 
necessitates both grid feed-in at times of excess generation, 
and grid-supply in times of excess load, even with local 
battery storage. For the example configuration (see Section 
II) to achieve NetZEB, solar PV has been chosen to exactly 
match the total load over a full year, requiring panels with a 
name-plate capacity of 4.03 kW. 
Figure 2 illustrates the apparent contradictions of the 
NetZEB approach. These three graphs use the interval 
energy balance space [17] to show the balance between local 
generation and local consumption, as defined in Figure 1, 
over different intervals. In each of these graphs, total local 
generation over the interval in question, is plotted against 
total local consumption over the same interval; each point on 
the graph identifies one such interval during the year. Points 
on the leading diagonal are those where for that interval, 
perfect balance is achieved between generation and 
consumption. Figure 2(a) represents the interval of a whole 
year, so just a single point is shown, and as expected from 
the design specifications mentioned, NetZEB is achieved 
over this period without any need for battery storage – the X 
on the balance diagonal. Reliance on the grid to both store 
and supply energy enables this balance, as Figure 2(b) 
highlights. Here, with an interval of just one hour, it can be 
seen that in very few of the 8760 hours of the year is perfect 
balance achieved. In many of these intervals there is zero 
generation but some load (those points on the horizontal axis, 
invariably night-time hours), and in others there is relatively 
low load (0.4 to 1.1), but much higher generation (the stack 
of points parallel to the vertical axis, invariably representing 
hours of high sunshine). Figure 2(c) however, shows that the 
introduction of local battery storage can improve the 
situation. With a storage capacity equal to 1 average day’s 
consumption (in this case 17.661 kWh, equivalent to 1.3 
Tesla Powerwall 2s – a normalised energy capacity of 24 on 
this hourly plot), many of the previously scattered points are 
now located on the balance diagonal. Since some of the 
locally generated energy now passes through the battery, 
then the annual goal is slightly compromised because of 
battery losses, as is seen from the shaded circle point on the 
annual balance plot of Figure 2(a) (here the normalised 
battery capacity for annual data is 1/365 ~ 0.003). This could 
be readily corrected by a small increase (<10%) in PV 
capacity. A battery efficiency of 90% has been used in these 
calculations, the indicated efficiency associated with the 
Tesla Powerwall [8].

The difference in grid dependency between the no-
storage and storage scenarios can also be seen from the 
balance duration plots of Figure 3. These duration plots take 
the 8760 hourly balance values over the year from Figures 
2(b) and 2(c), and show them sorted, largest to smallest. 
Again it can be seen that for the no-storage scenario, almost 
none of the hours lie on the balance line, but now for the 
storage scenario, it can be seen that for only 5% of the time, 
is generation in excess of load, and grid feed-in required, and 
for 17% of the time, load exceeds generation so that grid 
supply needed. For the remaining 78% of the hours of the 
year, the central horizontal band, perfect balance is achieved. 
Although the figures used here are hourly ones, so that 
within a balanced hour there may well be periods of 
imbalance, it can be safely assumed that battery storage of 
one day’s duration will normally smooth this, or in extreme 
cases, load management technology can be utilised to avoid 
peaks in either direction. 
IV. 
IMPLICATIONS OF NON-DETERMINISTIC GENERATION 
AND FINITE BATTERY STORAGE 
It is apparent from Figures 2(c) and 3 that the battery 
capacity used in this example (1/365 =  0.0027 of annual 
load) is insufficient to produce continuous balance over the 
whole year for this specific installation. In fact, balance is 
achieved for only 78% of the year. In general, batteries are 
really viable only for short-term storage. If one considers a 
solar PV microgrid installation, there are three levels of 
fluctuation in the generation capability that must be 
accommodated before load variations are even considered. 
(i) The first is the daily cycle attributable to  the rotation of 
the earth. No energy is generated during the night-time 
hours, and during the day, output begins at a low level as the  
sun rises, peaks in the middle of the day, and fades away to 
nothing as the sun sets. (ii) The second is related to weather 
events – when cloud cover and precipitation are present, the 
ouput at any time of day is reduced, from relatively minor 
impact for high cloud, to significant reduction for low cloud 
or precipitation. Such events may last from just minutes 
(cloud in front of the sun) to several days (major weather 
event). (iii) The third is the seasonal variation. With the sun 
at a lower angle in the winter, peak daily output can be 
significantly lower than in the summer, with the effect 
increasing with lattitude. For a residential installation, the 
reduced winter generation is compounded by what is 
normally an increased winter demand because of longer 
darkness hours and lower temperatures. 
Figure 4 illustrates an approach to determining the 
effectiveness of battery storage solutions [20]. Figure 4(a) 
shows the cumulative load and generation patterns over a 
year for our example, without any battery storage. It can be 
seen that accumulated generation (on a daily basis) generally 
exceeds accumulated consumption until day ~200 (mid-
winter). Figure 4(b) then shows the difference between the 
generation and load lines, essentially the same data used in 
the balance duration plot of Figure 3, but arranged 
chronologically rather than sorted by decreasing value. The 
distance between the maxima and minima of this plot gives 
the battery capacity that would be required to achieve 
continuous energy balance throughout the year, without any 
grid dependency (21.42 average days’ consumption, 
equivalent to 28 Tesla Powerwall 2s). The hourly interval 
energy balance plot with this battery capacity provided is 
shown in Figure 4(c), where it can be seen there remain a

number of hours where there is excess load. However, an 
increase in the solar capacity of just 8% can correct this, as 
shown in Figure 4(d), which demonstrates that these 
exceptions were caused simply by the battery losses. 
Clearly the battery capacity proposed here is impractical, 
and in fact, not a lot is typically gained, in terms of balance 
hours, as the battery capacity is increased beyond just a few 
days. Much smaller increases in the PV capacity are usually 
more fruitfull. Weniger [21] provides useful contour plots 
showing the tradeoff between battery and PV capacity in 
terms of self-sufficiency (proportion of load delivered by 
locally produced electricity). Their analysis, however, is 
based on annual totals, so assumes that any excess can be 
accomodated by the grid. 
For the previous example, a more satisfactory grid-load-
free solution can be achieved by starting with a 38% increase 
to the solar capacity, and using just 6 days’ battery storage. 
The cumulative generation curve shown in Figure 4(a) 
does demonstrate the typical seasonal sigmoidal shape. At 
increased lattitudes, this effect becomes much more 
pronounced, with signficantly reduced winter output. With 
the type of analysis just described, this can be best dealt with 
by increasing to solar capacity to provide adequate winter 
generation, accepting that there will be increased excess in

battery storage to carry excess energy from summer through 
to winter [22]. 
V. 
REDUCING GRID DEPENDENCY 
One approach to reducing the grid dependency of a 
microgrid installation is to plan for a restricted capacity grid 
connection – say a maximum X kW load and a maximum Y 
kW generation feed [17]. The advantages of this Grid-lite 
approach are (i) to ensure a level of self-sufficiency for the 
consumer, but more importantly (ii) to allow the grid and the 
electricity provider to plan their systems with a greater 
confidence. This notion is consistent with the idea that 
microgrids incorporating PV and battery storage are best not 
treated as non-deterministic generators, but rather as reduced 
loads. Grid-lite puts some numbers on this concept. 
Figure 5(a) shows the hourly energy balance for a Grid-
lite implementation based on our example system. Here the 
maximum grid flow has been set to 1 (normalised hourly) in 
both directions, the battery capacity to 1 day, and the PV 
capacity also to 1 (normalised). The goal of the smart 
management system is to keep the balance within the limits 
that clearly show in the plot. While there are some hours 
where the balance falls below the limit, these can be 
eliminated by increasing the solar capacity by 38% and 
doubling the battery capacity. This modification is shown in 
Figure 5(b). The positive imbalance hours need to be

assessed from the balance duration plot of Figure 5(c), which 
shows there are 1650 hours of excess generation (18%).  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper has explored and demonstrated a range of 
approaches to modelling microgrids incorporating solar PV 
and batteries. While other renewable generation technologies 
are equally applicable (they differ mainly in the extent and 
manner of their variability) the focus has been on solar 
because (i) it is the obvious distributed choice for urban 
environments, where by far the greater proportion of the 
population of the world resides, and (ii) its rapid penetration 
has caused the electricity supply industry to seriously 
consider its implications. 
The approach has highlighted the need to primarily 
consider local energy balance, using the particular model for 
energy balance defined in Figure 1, where local supply is 
considered to come from both the solar PV and the battery, 
and where battery charging is also considered to be a part of 
the local load. 
With a better appreciation of the motivations for local 
balance, microgrids incorporating solar PV and storage can 
be seen to contribute to the longer-term planning of 
electricity grids, not because of the generation capacity the 
solar PV provides, which is considered of dubious value by 
some, but because of the load such systems, if well designed, 
remove from the grid. 
While the analysis is this paper has been based on a 
single household, because of the success of the approach in 
demonstrating the possibilites of local energy balance, the 
situation for multiple households (say a street) can be no 
more challenging, and is likely, because of parallel 
generation patterns, but probably different consumption 
patterns, to be complimentary, with balance able to be 
achieved with slightly less total storage. The wasted excess 
generation from one house may contribute to the shortfall of 
another, so effectively implementing grid-edge transfers 
within the microgrid.
