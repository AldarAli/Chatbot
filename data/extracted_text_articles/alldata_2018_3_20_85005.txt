Abstract—Three-dimensional objects (3D) allow extensive 
and heterogeneous information to be stored in single models 
which can be exploited by users to satisfy various research 
and study needs. Moreover, the 3D visualization would be 
even more interesting if it were the result of the 
“materialization” of descriptive sentences extrapolated from 
texts related to the subject matter. In other words, a direct 
connection between 3D models and the associated texts or 
drawings could provide a useful and stimulating explication 
of the case of study. The extrapolation of specific information 
from texts, however, is time-consuming and it requires the 
user to have in-depth knowledge of the referring domain. An 
innovative solution to the problem, then, would be to develop 
a system that can analyse and "comprehend" the documents 
in order to automatically provide, as output, portions of text 
containing geometric and spatial information useful for the 
3D scenes generation. In this paper, the analysis of the 
framework of the above-mentioned system is presented and 
its implementation on a specific corpus concerning the 
“World City” project, is evaluated.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is an emerging 
methodology used in several areas, such as art, education, 
robotics and, nowadays, it is also developing in the Cultural 
Heritage field. According to the principles for the 
Conservation and Restauration of Built Heritage “In the 
protection and public preservation of archaeological sites, 
the use of modern technologies, databanks, information 
system and virtual presentation techniques should be 
promoted” [1]. But that is not all, because the relationship 
between 
Cultural 
Heritage 
and 
Information 
and 
Communication Technologies (ICTs) could be exploited 
not only to represent sites and artworks of the past, still 
existing or no longer existing, but also to spread the 
knowledge of projects never realised. Thanks to virtual 
models, in fact, researchers have the possibility to study 
and formulate conclusions about sites and object 
placements, characteristics and configurations, while, more 
general users may discover and understand their beauty and 
importance. 
The aim of this work is to spread knowledge of a 
worldwide known project developed by the French 
bibliographer Paul Otlet in collaboration with international 
architects such as Andersen, Hébrard, Le Corbusier and 
Heymans [2]: the “World City” [3]. The complex project 
has been described in several drawings and textual 
documents 
which 
contain, 
in a 
dispersed 
and fragmented way, information of heterogeneous nature. 
Conversely, a 3D representation could include, in a single 
composite model, all the data that could be immediately 
transferred to the users. In fact, the 3D model has a strong 
communicative power in addition to the great advantage of 
being a “universal datum”. This means that the transfer of 
information does not depend on the used written language, 
weakness of the texts, or on the users’ domain knowledge 
and imagination, which often cause erroneous or different 
interpretations of the information. On these bases, this 
work aims to exploit a virtual 3D of the World City in order 
to describe the project in an innovative way: the creation of 
3D scenes starting from spatial descriptions contained and 
extracted from a referent corpus of texts. The project, in 
fact, was the result of numerous years of study and research 
attested by primary and secondary sources. 
The paper is divided into sections as follow: Section II 
provides an overview of similar systems. Section III 
summarizes the 5 different phases of the methodology and 
describes the first two in detail (Domain Analysis and 
Corpus Compilation, Information Extraction). Section IV 
shows the results of the sentence extraction system. In 
section V, concluding remarks are presented.  
II. BACKGROUND 
The work proposes to achieve its aim by a methodology 
that, through a set of rules, will lead to the reconstruction 
of virtual scenes regarding the World City project. The idea 
is to generate associations between terms and 3D elements 
writing some scripts able to analyse the texts, extract the 
relevant information from them and handle the location of 
the three-dimensional objects in the virtual environment. 
A. Related works 
Several systems that can interpret natural descriptions to 
create a visual representation have already been developed 
in the past. A text-to-scene conversion system, frequently 
cited as the first in this field, is the tool SHRDLU [4], which 
allows users to insert, as input, commands written in natural 
language with the purpose of using them to move virtual 
objects around in a small “blocks world”. Likewise,  
Natural Language Image Generation (NALIG) [5] is able 
to generate scenes by tacking sequences of descriptions 
which concern the spatial relations between objects. The 
pioneering WordsEye [6] is one of the main works that 
focused on this theme, in fact, it creates three-dimensional 
scenes from input descriptions by converting a parse tree to 
a dependency representation that, in turn, is transformed 
into a semantic one. Other similar systems are [7] [8], 
which use manual links between language and objects in 
order to create three-dimensional scenes in a virtual space.

Chang et al. [9] present an advanced 3D generation 
approach able to learn from data; indeed, the system is 
capable of mapping, in an automatic way, textual terms to 
objects and of creating a 3D representation. Furthermore, 
other works like those described in [10] [11] addressed the 
development of systems able to infer the presence of 
implicit objects, or constraints on the objects, in a described 
scene and to generate a final 3D representation. Sproat [12], 
instead, focuses on the possibility of inferring the 
environment of the textual descriptions; for example, taken 
into account the sentence “Carl is having a shower” the 
system tries to infer that the scene is set in a bathroom and 
not in a bedroom or in a kitchen. Big efforts have also been 
spent, in the literature, to propose solutions for the 
automatic or semi-automatic extraction or annotation of 
spatial relations and spatial objects from texts in order to 
generate 3D scenes. The SpatialML annotation scheme, for 
example, aims to mark places, including buildings, 
mentioned in a text (indicated with PLACE tags) and map 
them to data from gazetteers and other databases. Semantic 
attributes, such as country abbreviations, subdivision and 
dependent area abbreviations, and geo-coordinates are used 
to help establish such a mapping. Rules are language-
dependent for marking up SpatialML tags, while are 
language-independent for marking up semantic attributes 
of tags [13]. Also, Klien and Lutz [14] proposed a method 
based on spatial relations for automatizing the semantic 
annotation process. In particular, they showed how the use 
of spatial relations at the data level, thus expressed through 
spatial processing methods (e.g., the calculation of the 
topology, direction or distance between two spatial entities) 
can be exploited for the semi-automatic semantic 
annotation of geodata. Concept definitions and spatial 
relations here can be extracted from geographic domain 
ontologies. Other works are focused on  the use of a markup 
language, based on the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) 
Guidelines, for semantically annotating raw texts and, in 
particular, for the task of Named Entities Recognition and 
Spatial Role Labeling [15]. Regarding the use of 
ontologies, in [16] they are proposed to bridge between 
cognitive–linguistic spatial concepts in natural language 
and multiple qualitative spatial representation and 
reasoning models. To make this mapping, authors 
developed a novel global machine learning framework for 
ontology population. 
 Finally, a more recent initiative, using also ontologies 
and semantic web technologies is the Digital 3D 
Reconstruction in Virtual Research Environment project 
[17], which aims to define standards for the web-based 
delivery, e-documentation and presentation of 3D data sets 
of destroyed architectural landmarks and artworks. The 
results are concerned with indexing of sources, 
documentation, semantic modelling, and visualization of 
3D data sets using WebGL-technology. Here the main 
contribution is the development of the Cultural Heritage 
Markup Language (CHML), a human and machine-
readable XML Schema for semantic annotation and for the 
digital 3D reconstruction of the lost and/or never existing 
Cultural Heritage 3D objects. The advantages of this new 
data model is that it is mapped to CIDOC CRM, which is 
the referent ontology in the Cultural Heritage domain, and 
is ready to use for annotating and indexing cultural objects 
within a Virtual Research Environment [18]. 
B.  The World City 
The concept of the World City was born in the period 
that goes from 1910 to 1941.This city should have been a 
spatial non-space, i.e., a “home for men” after war and a 
world centre for the accumulation, organization, and 
dissemination of knowledge. The idea was to create a place 
where people could live in harmony and in universal 
cooperation and a site whose urban organization responds 
to precise philosophical, scientific and rational criteria. The 
City should have included numerous buildings which are 
the World Museum (1) [19], the Hall of Modern Times (2), 
the International Association (3), the Library (4), the 
University (5), the Stadium (6), the Pavilions (7) and the 
cité hôtelière (8). In Figure 1, a plan realised by the

III. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In the few above-mentioned works (see Section II-A), 
as well as in others, the 3D scenes are generated starting 
from sentences written by the users or manually selected 
from a text. On the contrary, nothing has been done with 
regard to the automatic extraction of descriptive sentences 
from a large corpus containing various information. 
Therefore, the challenge of the present work is to develop 
a system capable of selecting, without human help, specific 
sentences from texts concerning the “World City” with the 
final purpose of spreading the knowledge of the project 
thanks to the generation of 3D virtual scenes. 
The approach can be subdivided in 5 different steps, 
which are listed below: 
1) 
Domain 
Analysis 
and 
Corpus 
compilation: 
collection of the relevant sources related to the 
“World City”;  
2) 
Information Extraction: extraction of sentences 
which contain spatial description from the corpus; 
3) 
Semantic Annotation and Spatial Roles labelling: 
sentences annotation and automatic detection of the 
spatial roles; 
4) 
3D Objects modeling: creation of the models which 
compose the city through a graphical tool; 
5) 
3D Scenes generation. 
In this paper, we focused on points 1 and 2, namely, on 
the study of the domain and on the possibility of 
automatically extracting all the spatial information from 
the heterogeneous texts that compose the corpus. Further 
works will deal with the Semantic Annotation and the 
automatic 3D scenes generation.  
C. Domain Analysis and Corpus Compilation 
The domain analysis consists in the study of the 
architectural and historical sources present in the literature 
in order to discover the specific terms or the multi-words 
used in the architectural domain, with particular attention 
to the terminology used in the descriptions of the “World 
City”. For this purpose, a corpus has been created focusing 
on two important aspects [20]:  
 
Definition of the characteristics of the reference 
population from which a significant sample was 
extracted; 
 
Definition of qualitative and quantitative criteria for 
determining the representativeness of the corpus.  
The corpus, in fact, must fulfil the role of a 
representative sample, in the statistical sense of the term, 
because all the observations obtained from its analysis must 
be valid and extendable to all the individuals of the 
population. Specifically, the extracted terminology must be 
as representative as possible of the one used in the 
reference domain, but, on  a smaller scale. One of the 
criteria that contributes to ensure the representativeness of 
the corpus is its size. However, there are not yet precise 
directives concerning the right dimension. Moreover, given 
the large amount of information and documents in all areas 
of knowledge, determining the number of all the available 
sources, for a precise domain, is a difficult and  significant 
issue. 
During the first phase, we collected sources of 
heterogeneous nature, which include images or technical 
drawings, videos and textual documents but, for our corpus 
composition, we only used the texts, because we are 
interested in the generation of 3D scenes starting from texts 
written in natural language. On these bases, aiming to 
respect the criterion of quality, we selected the texts which 
respect the following requirements [21]: 
1. 
The texts should be representative of the period taken 
into consideration that goes from the beginning of the 
nineteenth century to the present day.  
2. 
The texts should be written by different authors: 
firstly by Paul Otlet,  but also domain experts both of 
the time and contemporary; 
3. 
The texts should be original and not translations; 
4. 
The texts should be complete and not fragments of the 
whole documents. 
All these criteria should guarantee the maximum 
reliability of all the texts which form the corpus that is 
composed by primary sources (in the specific case, Paul 
Otlet’s publications or the correspondence between him 
and the architects), and secondary sources (articles and 
books of other authors related to the referent domain).  
At the end of the analysis, we collected 29 texts in total, 
for an amount of 411,401 tokens. These documents, 
originally of different formats (.doc, .pdf, .jpeg) have all 
been transformed into .txt files through the software 
ABBYY [22], able to provide optical character recognition 
and document capture. The whole corpus could be 
subdivided into four sub-corpora, one for each language 
handled. In particular, 17 documents are in English 
(201,747 tokens), 6 documents are in French (85,738 
tokens), 4 documents are in Italian (105,930 tokens) and 
only two documents are in Spanish (17,986 tokens).  Once 
the corpus was created, we carried out an analysis on the 
natural language constructions useful to talk about spatial 
configurations. The study was carried out on the four 
above-mentioned languages because we wanted to work on 
original texts and not on translations to ensure that the 
terminology is original and appropriate with reference to 
the specific domain.  
D. Spatial Information Extraction 
One of the most important functions of natural language 
is to describe spatial relationships between objects through 
linguistic constructs containing spatial information. The 
latter are easily understandable by the human mind, but 
machines, on the contrary, have not the same cognitive 
capabilities and they cannot distinguish spatial and non-
spatial data from . This means that it is difficult for 
computers to identify and extract from texts only the 
information useful for 3D scenes construction, which is our 
final task. Therefore, we developed a sentence extractor 
capable of parsing large data to automatically extract 
specific sentences from the aforementioned corpus [23]. 
The aim is to provide a great help to people that, instead of 
reading the whole texts to select precise information, may 
automatically obtain the required data.   
A way to guide the computer to a correct extraction is 
to identify how the spatial information is expressed in 
natural language. We ascertained that is is generally 
provided by the use of prepositions that establish a 
relationship between two or more objects However, it is not 
sufficient, because the same preposition could also be used 
42

ALLDATA 2018 : The Fourth International Conference on Big Data, Small Data, Linked Data and Open Data

to talk about events or situations which do not involve 
spatial descriptions. For example, the preposition on could 
be used to describe spatial configurations like “the picture 
is on the wall” or “the bottle is on the table” but, the same 
preposition is also used in different contexts such as in the 
sentences “They need to concentrate on their studies” or 
“The discussion will be on a topic you have studied 
recently”. 
The first two sentences express spatial concepts, 
concepts of verticality or objects overlapping, while the last 
two sentences do not have any kind of reference to entities 
locations. This means that the usage of prepositions 
depends on several aspects like the entities involved in the 
scene or the general situation of speech. In other words, 
prepositions are often used in front of nouns or pronouns to 
show the relationship between them and other words in the 
sentence, but they can also be used to describe the time 
when something happens (They arrived on Sunday), the 
way in which something is done (We went by train) and 
even more. On this basis, the identification and the 
extraction of particular sentences from a large number of 
texts, characterised by heterogeneous information, is a big 
and interesting challenge. Therefore, in this work, a Python 
script able to read and analyse a text has been created with 
the purpose of extracting all the sentences containing 
spatial descriptions. The latter are composed by three 
central concepts belonging to the Holistic Spatial Semantic 
Theory [24] in which the three main spatial roles are 
defined. They are trajector(s), landmark(s) and spatial 
indicator(s) that, linked together, generate a spatial triplet. 
In particular: 
- the trajector (TR) is a spatial role label assigned to a 
word that denotes a central object of a spatial scene;  
- the landmark (LM) is a spatial role label given to a 
word that indicates a secondary object of a spatial 
scene (to which a possible spatial relation between 
two objects can be established); 
- the spatial indicator (SI) is a spatial role label assigned 
to a word that indicates a spatial relation between 
objects (TR and LM) of a spatial scene.  
To better understand, in the sentence “The [car]TR is 
[under] SI the [tree] LM” the “car” is a trajector, the “tree” is 
a landmark and “under” is a spatial indicator. A key 
element of the system is a set of text extraction rules that 
identify relevant information to be extracted from the input 
text. In particular, the adopted extraction process is based 
on some word lists belonging to a “spatial domain” and on 
specific rules which guide the system to identify only the 
sought information. 
The system is subdivided in four sections which, by 
successive and interconnected steps, gradually lead to a  
more accurate result. The general idea is to start from an 
entire document, written in one of the four languages 
mentioned above, and to parse it in order to identify the 
possible spatial indicators and labels (TR and LM) existing 
and interrelated. Although in this step, a difference between 
roles is not carried out, they are considered regardless of 
whether they are a trajector or a landmark. The assignment 
of the correct roles, in fact, will be done subsequently (see 
step 3 of the methodology described in section III), by 
using a probabilistic programming language called Saul 
[25]. For this purpose, two main operations are executed by 
the system: i) the division of the whole text into single 
sentences and, ii)  their analysis to discard, step by step, 
those that are not useful for the final goal. The four scripts 
of the system are the following: 
1- Sentence_Split.py  = the system opens a document, 
in a .txt format, and separates strings using two specific 
delimiters, a dot ( ‘.’ ) or a long sequence of blank spaces. 
Then, it creates a .txt file (Sentences.txt) that collects all the 
sentences of the document. 
2-  Search.py = the system reads, as input, a .txt file 
containing all the possible prepositions or expressions that 
may be spatial indicators (e.g., on, in the centre of, to the 
right, etc.). Then, it opens the Sentences.txt file and it 
analyses if each sentence contains or does not contain one 
or more spatial indicator(s). Finally, it creates, as output, a 
.txt file (outfile.txt) including only the phrases with spatial 
indicator(s) inside.  
3-  CountOccurrences.py = the system reads two .txt 
files, the previous outfile.txt and domainNouns.txt, which is 
a list containing terms or multi-words that may be TR(s) or 
LM(s) of the sentences. The latter are all written with 
lowercase letters so, the next step of the system is to replace 
all the capital letters, present in outfile.txt file, with 
lowercase letters in order to be case-insensitive. In the end, 
the system counts the number of labels occurrences 
(number of time that TR(s) and/or LM(s) appear in each 
sentence) and, if it is greater than two, it extrapolates the 
sentences from the outfile.txt file and writes them into 
another .txt file (labelSentences.txt). In this way, it is hoped 
that, at least, one label is the TR of the sentence and another 
one is its LM and that they are connected through a spatial 
indicator detected in the previous step. 
4- Last.py = in this phase the system improves the 
results establishing which are the positions that can be 
occupied by the labels in order to be possible TR(s) and 
LM(s). The locations are set up with reference to the 
positions of the spatial indicators taking into account some 
sentence structure rules. In Table 1, the main rules adopted 
to identify a possible landmark in a sentence are illustrated. 
More specifically, by making reference to the location of 
the spatial indicator (signed as s_i) the LM may be located 
in the next position (s_i + 1), in (s_i + 2) or in (s_i + 3) 
position. Sample sentences are:  
a) 
A [zoo] TR  designed for children is located [in the 
south of] SI  [London] LM; 
b) 
The [fork] TR  is [to the left of] SI  [the] article [plate] 
LM; 
c) 
Put the [box]TR [on]SI [the]article [wooden]adjective 
[table]LM!

A further case regards the lack of the landmark in the 
sentence. This happens when the description is 
characterized by the presence of an implicit LM like in the 
sentence: The [balloon] TR flown [up]SI where the LM is 
NIL (void). Once these rules have been taken into account,

the system makes a screening selection of the input file 
(labelSentences.txt) and generates a final file (Last.txt),as 
output, which shall collect all the sentences containing 
spatial descriptions and spatial relationships. Table 2

Since at step 3 of the methodology, the automatic 
assignment of roles (trajector, landmark) and spatial 
indicator in the sentences will be carried out using Saul, 
which works only for English, it has been necessary to 
translate of all the sentences extrapolated from the Italian, 
French and Spanish documents into English. More 
precisely, 146 sentences have been manually translated 
from French, 241 from Italian, and 48 from Spanish. 
IV. RESULTS 
In total, the system extrapolated 705 different 
sentences, originally in English (270 sentences) or 
translated into English (435 sentences), that may be 
classified into two different categories: “useful extractions” 
and “unuseful extractions”. In particular, the sentences 
belonging to the first category are those that have been 
extracted by the system and that really contain spatial 
information, while, the ones belonging to the second 
category, are the sentences extracted even if they do not 
contain spatial data. The number of “useful extraction” 
sentences is 578, while, the amount of “unuseful 
extraction” sentences is equal to127 units. In addition, there 
is a third category that includes all the sentences not 
detected by the system but which contains spatial 
information; in other words, the missing data. They are, in 
total, only 75, as depicted in Figure 2. 
The results have been estimated by the evaluation 
metrics of precision and recall defined as: 
 
 precision =  
𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃              recall =  
𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 
 
where: 
TP = is the number of system-extracted sentences that 
contain spatial information; 
FP = is the number of system-extracted sentences that do 
not contain spatial information; 
FN = is the number of sentences containing spatial 
information that the system does not extract from the texts. 
The count of the exact number of sentences containing 
spatial information has been manually performed. They 
have been detected from the four Sentences.txt files (one 
for each language handled) and compared to the files 
automatically generated by the system: Label Sentences.txt 
and Last.txt. On this basis, the parameters of precision and 
recall have been estimated. Table 3 shows the results of the 
system run:

These results certify that the used system has an 
adequate level of reliability because it is capable of 
responding to the task with a limited margin of error. 
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
Three-dimensional virtual reconstructions are used in 
various fields, such as playful or didactic, but play a 
predominant role in the Cultural Heritage sector. The 3D 
elements, in fact, allow complete and exhaustive 
knowledge of the object under consideration because they 
can be viewed from all points of view, rotated, inspected 
within them and exploded in their various components. 
Despite the multitude of 3D models designed to spread the 
knowledge of our Cultural Heritage, the innovative nature 
of this work is the connection between three-dimensional 
data and one-dimensional data. In other words, the will to 
materialize 3D scenes from descriptive sentences contained 
in texts of historical, artistic and cultural value that regard 
the project of the World City. Such interrelationship 
between reference textual sources and three-dimensional 
models would enrich the original texts with information 
that are often implied or scattered in the texts and cannot

be viewed together. Furthermore, thanks to the system 
created and described in this work, it is possible to 
overcome the problem associated with the manual 
extraction of spatial descriptions that is a time consuming 
operation, which becomes more and more complicated in 
the growth of the size of the examined corpus. On the 
contrary, the automatic extrapolation of sentences to 
materialize in virtual space is the key to the problem and 
the innovation of the proposed work. These sentences will 
then become the starting point for virtual reconstructions of 
more or less complex scenes containing spatially related 
entities. Given the simple task evaluated, a future test will 
be to train a machine learning document classifier to see if 
the evaluation is improved with respect to the use of our 
rule-based approach. 
The proposed methodology will provide a three-
dimensional view of the World City, just as Paul Otlet and 
Le Corbusier designed it, and it will allow a simpler and 
quicker understanding of the complex project that, 
although it has great historical, artistic and cultural value, 
was 
never 
realized. 
Finally, 
we 
hope 
that 
the 
abovementioned methodology will be exploited in other 
contexts where there is a need to extrapolate sentences, 
containing entities and relationships between them, from 
documents. Especially when the documents, due to their 
large-scale, cannot be manually read and analysed by the 
user. Further work will test the potentiality of semantic web 
technologies and ontologies to improve the results as 
experimented in [18].
