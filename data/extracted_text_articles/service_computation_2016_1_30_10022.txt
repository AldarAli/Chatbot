Abstract—A large amount of information is not always 
appealing to tourists. While the provision of information may 
lessen the anxiety experienced by tourists, the promise of the 
unexpected is one of the things that make travel attractive. We 
developed a new application using Bluetooth Low Energy 
(BLE) beacons that not only provides a guide to a specific 
location but also summarizes the traditional customs and 
history of the area. A trial at the Nikko world heritage site in 
Japan demonstrated the effectiveness of the BLE beacon for 
sightseeing on foot. The application made tourists notice new 
points on the route. Owners of shops en route to the main 
shrine cooperated by providing information regarding their 
goods and information on local traditions. Our system 
enhanced the tourist experience of a traditional cultural city, 
especially for foreign visitors and young Japanese.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
     We introduce our remarkable points for tourist 
information and technology.  
A. Services using Information and Communication 
Technology  
Information and communication technology (ICT) is 
widely used for travel and tourism and has now made 
considerable information available. Tourists get information 
about maps, shops, accommodations, museums, events etc. 
However, the plethora of information available on the Web 
is not always appealing to tourists. We have to consider what 
information is appealing to tourists, when they should 
receive it and who the target audience for this information 
should be. Before using big data by GPS signals for tourists, 
we should re-inspect and analyse the information contents. 
In this study, we investigated the information needs of 
tourists in Nikko and tested the provision of information 
using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon system. 
This study was selected as one of the research themes of 
SCOPE [1] and was funded by the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and Communications of Japan [2].  
B.  Psychology of Tourists  
Many previous studies have investigated environmental 
psychology and tourism. Pearce and Stringer [3] studied the 
issue from the viewpoint of physiology, cognition and 
individual variation. It has been shown that among the 
factors that drive people to travel to new places, the 
expectation of experiencing the extraordinary plays a leading 
role [4]. The term ‘extraordinary’ here means experiences 
clearly different from the usual lifestyle. Thus, busy workers 
may crave relaxation, while bored young people may crave 
excitement. Therefore, separately identifying specialized 
target audiences and providing them with the unique 
information that matches their expectations is necessary.  
C. Cultual Differences 
Tourism involves encounters with people and places. 
Each place has its own characteristic culture, and these 
differences between cultures make travel interesting and 
exciting. However, some tourists do not recognize the 
cultural significance of traditional sites. 
For example, Japan has ancient temples, many of which 
are located far from train stations. While this may at first 
appear to make visits inconvenient, travelling the route to 
the temple has traditionally been a central feature of the visit. 
There are often a series of wells en route to the main temple, 
at which visitors to the shrine purify themselves by washing 
their hands and their hearts, as well as smaller temples 
surrounding the main one. Tourists who are unaware of this 
tradition may not sense the full experience. Information on 
this is, however, difficult to find on the Web, and if it exists, 
it is often buried among the numerous photographs and 
comments left by visitors unfamiliar with the location. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
discusses the previous literature. Section 3 sets out our 
proposal. In Section 4, we report the results of our trials and 
explain the role-played in Nikko. Finally, we discuss ways 
of providing information appropriate to traditional cultural 
sites and suggest future studies.

RELATED WORKS 
A. Our Previous Work 
Students go on school trips in Japan [5]. While such 
outdoor activities are valuable, students cannot fully grasp 
the artistic or cultural value and meaning of the objects or 
scenery by simply viewing them [6]. To address this problem, 
we developed a new learning model for outdoor study [7][8]. 
Human beings do not always recognize what they see. 
For example, in the game of photo hunt, we may not be able 
to tell the difference between two similar photographs. 
However, once a particular object is noticed, our attention is 
focused on it. We exploited this concept by developing a 
quiz to be used as a trigger to draw attention to a particular 
object in the scenery that the students were viewing. The 
quizzes encouraged positive responses. We argue that such 
methods will be beneficial for other tourist groups as well. 
B. Related Works 
Many sightseeing applications for smartphones already 
exist in Japan [9], which allow tourists to access information 
about restaurants, souvenir shops and local weather, as well 
as to download maps. Counting only local applications, 666 
such applications were identified in a 2015 study. Although 
96% of these were free, 91% were downloaded only 10,000 
or fewer times [10]. The EU’s TAG CLOUD project 
(Technologies lead to Adaptability and lifelong enGagement 
with culture throughout the CLOUD) used smartphone 
technology to provide information about traditional cultural 
sites [11] and to investigate ways of enabling cultural 
engagement using cloud-based technologies. While the TAG 
CLOUD uses a cloud-based service, our application was 
designed to work without requiring access to the cloud, since 
Internet connections may be limited in rural areas.  
III. 
SERVICE PROPOSAL 
We administered questionnaires to the visitors to Nikko 
[12], in order to know the focus points for our new system, 
on September 2014. A total of 606 questionnaires (534 in 
Japanese and 72 in English) were completed.  
TABLE I.  
ROTATED MATRIX 
  
A key finding was that young people reported that they 
would like to have enjoyed Nikko more completely and that 
most of them were smartphone users. Cluster analysis was 
used to confirm this pattern. Respondents were asked to 
evaluate sightseeing activities in Nikko on a scale of one to 
five. As shown in Table I, the responses were clustered into 
three main groups: 
 
• 
A group who valued its own active experiences 
• 
A group who valued nature, history, or traditional 
factors 
• 
A group who valued the quality of accommodation or 
the price of goods and services 
 
Using Ward’s method, the data were then classified into 
five clusters. As only three persons belonged to the 5th 
cluster, we classified the results into the following four 
clusters, as shown in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 Figure 1 Evaluation of the preferences of the four clusters. 
 
1 Tourists who do not wish to be active, or who are 
mainly concerned about prices and accommodation (n 
= 140) 
2 Tourists who do not have any special interests, but who 
wish to stay active (n = 103) 
3 Tourists interested in nature or history (n = 62) 
   4   Tourists who give a high rating to almost everything in 
        Nikko or who particularly wish to stay active (n = 37) 
 
Tourists in the 1st cluster would like to visit the famous 
hot springs in Nikko and are unlikely to be interested in 
extensive information about Nikko, since they visit Nikko 
primarily for rest. Tourists in the 4th cluster are active and 
have many interests, but are less numerous than those in the 
1st cluster.  
The age composition of the groups is shown in Fig. 2. 
Over 70% of those in the 4th cluster were under 30 years old

Young tourists tend to plan active trips to Nikko. Their 
characteristic tendencies are as follows:  
 They come to Nikko by train and navigate Nikko by  
 bus or on foot 
 They are smartphone users 
 They know little about traditional culture 
 They like to experience new things  
Responses from foreign tourists showed the same profile. 
IV. 
SERVICE PROPOSAL FOR YOUNG TOURISTS AND 
FOREIGNERS 
     We explain our system and report the results of our trials 
and explain the role-played in Nikko. 
A. Service Flow 
  Tourists who know little about the area and the history 
currently exchange comments using SNS. We therefore 
addressed the use of beacons to allow residents of the 
tourism area to recover information from such tourists. We 
designed our service system as shown in Fig. 3.  
 
Figure 3 Service flow. 
 
     Shop owners gave us information about the goods 
they stock, seasonal festivals and other information. Tourists 
could access this near the beacon, which was located in front 
or at the entrance of the shop. Bus timetables were furnished 
by the local bus operator and information about local 
attractions was supplied by the tourist association. This 
information was displayed on a map in the smartphone 
application. In addition, we devised several quizzes using the 
Zeigarnik effect, aimed at young students on school trips. 
Shop owners could then access customer traffic diagrams, 
and teachers could monitor the location of their students. 
B. Comparison of Technologies that can be used for 
Sightseeing in Historic Areas 
Current smart phones incorporate a range of sensors. 
Table II lists the functions of these devices and their 
potential use in tourist information services. Several of the 
devices can be used to collect information and identify the 
location of smartphone users.   
However, foreign tourists rarely use roaming data 
communication services because of their high cost, so we 
also designed a service that did not require the use of 
3G/LTE. As both GPS and the camera quickly deplete the 
battery, we designed our service to work without them. The 
use of AR was a potentially interesting alternative navigation 
method; however, it proved impossible to run this in the 
background. The final design of our application was as 
shown in Fig. 4. We assumed the following design 
constraints: 
TABLE II.  
FUNCTIONS AND DEVICES IN A SMART PHONE 
 
 
 
Figure 4 System diagram. 
 
(1) Information should be displayed using the BLE 
beacon. For near-field communication, NFC and 
RFID may also be used. NFC requires activating a 
tag, which is inconvenient for tourists. RFID works 
in a similar way to a BLE beacon, but no smartphone 
has the RFID function. 
(2) If 3G/LTE is not available, it must be possible to 
download applications and information using Wi-Fi. 
In the Nikko area, the City of Nikko provides a free 
Wi-Fi service at the railway station and in some 
shops, allowing tourists to download applications. 
Wi-Fi provides location data, in order to replace 
GPS. 
(3) The application should provide a full range of 
information 
including 
location, 
shopping 
information 
and 
bus 
timetables. 
Real-time 
information such as temporary changes to bus routes 
because of festivals or the blooming of cherry 
blossom should be downloadable using free Wi-Fi. 
C. Information on Nikko as a World Heritage Site 
Using beacons, we sent location-specific information 
within a range of 2.3–10 m [13], which transformed an 
anonymous road into a zone immersed in Japanese culture.  
This reflects the traditional Japanese method of attending 
services of worship, in which the journey to and from the 
service are not the same. Before entering a temple or shrine,

tourists purify themselves. After leaving the shrine, they eat 
or go shopping. This is an established Japanese cultural 
custom, which has long been taken for granted.  
The erection of signboards is seldom permitted in Nikko, 
following the Convention Concerning the Protection of the 
World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO, 1972). 
Using beacons, we were able to show the information on a 
smartphone. We created a traditional road, ‘SANDOU’ (it 
means a road approaching the main temple or shrine in 
Japanese), for the Nikko cultural heritage site. Using our 
beacon system, tourists could pause on the road, some to 
read information about the traditional temple there and others 
to find shops selling Japanese sweets, while young students 
answered a quiz. The road became a pilgrimage route to the 
shrine. 
D. Designing the Application and Locating the Beacons 
Many trials using BLE beacons have been reported in 
which location-specific and shopping information was 
provided in shopping malls and train stations. However, the 
BLE beacon has rarely been used for outdoor sightseeing. 
 
 
Figure 5 Beacon map at Nikko. 
 
Beacons send advertising messages at prefixed intervals 
using channels 37, 38 and 39. iBeacon, defined by Apple, 
sends advertising messages every 100 ms [14]. An important 
characteristic of BLE is its low power consumption. BLE 
requires only 1/10 to 1/100 the power of classic Bluetooth 
signalling, and a beacon may function for a year or more 
without a battery change.  
To improve the visitor experience, we imposed the 
following requirements on the system: 
 
• Reduce power consumption by avoiding the use of 
GPS 
• Provide sightseeing information related to the BLE 
beacon location 
• Have navigation operate in both foreground and 
background while displaying the distance from the 
station to the Shinkyo Bridge entrance to Toshogu 
(the main shrine) 
•  Display a timetable of main bus routes 
 
    Fig.6 displays screenshots of the application. This 
application was implemented on iPhone (5 or later models). 
 
    
Figure 6 Screenshots of our application. 
 
    Fig.7 explains the software components of this 
application. In the operating system (OS), BLE access 
function always scans advertising message. If the OS 
catches an advertising message, the information of the 
advertising message is forwarded to the application. For 
example, Core Location framework of iOS (7 or later) 
provides three properties such as proximity UUID, major 
and minor. Android 5.0 or later also provides similar 
function. If the information such as UUID, major and minor 
is received from a beacon, the application retrieves 
information that matches triples (UUID, major and minor). 
For 
example, 
if 
UUID=cb86bc31-05bd-40cc-903d-
1c9bd13d966a, major=1, minor=1, the information relating 
to the beacon located in the Nikko Station is retrieved from 
DB and it is displayed on the screen of the smart phone. 
 
 
Figure 7 Software design to use BLE beacon  
 
    Each beacon provided information related to its location. 
For example, when the application received a signal from 
beacon #13, it displayed ‘On the left, there is a slope. At the 
end of the slope, there is an old temple named Kannonji; 180 
m to Shinkyo Bridge and 1,250 m to Nikko train station’. 
The visitor could use this information to find a small, historic 
temple. 
    To ensure stable reception of signals between the Nikko 
station and Shinkyo Bridge, we calculated the distance 
between the beacons as follows. In order to receive a signal 
from a beacon in the background, a smartphone must receive 
the signal for one minute or longer. We set a beacon to send 
a one-directional message using a steel signboard. 
E. First Trial: Discovery of Beacons 
Six students and three faculty members participated in 
the first trial, conducted on November 9, 2014.  
1) Discovery of the beacons 
We tested the beacons under three scenarios: 
  Scenario 1: Walking from Nikko station to Shinkyo Bridge 
  Scenario 2: Taking a bus from Nikko station to Shinkyo

  Scenario 3: Walking to the Nikko visitor centre from 
Shinkyo Bridge while visiting shops where a 
beacon was located  
In Scenario 1, users located approximately 95% of the 
beacons while walking. The beacon system worked as 
expected. 
In Scenario 2, the results were prima facie unstable. If the 
user sat in the back of a bus, the smartphone was located 
near the window, but if the user sat in a front seat, the 
smartphone was below the window. In the former case, the 
smartphone could easily capture signals from beacons, but in 
the latter case, the metal body of the bus blocked the signal. 
As the smartphone captured the beacon signal once a minute, 
the signals from some beacons were missed. Detailed testing 
of the relationship between the position at which the 
smartphone is held and the bus speed is a subject for future 
study. 
In Scenario 3, about 80% of the beacons were found, 
although in one case, only 33% were found. This suggests 
that the beacon system works best when users have already 
decided which shops to visit. 
2) User awareness of the beacons  
We asked subjects to monitor their awareness of the 
vibration and sound emitted by the smartphone when a 
beacon was found. The results showed that if users were 
holding the smartphone in their hand, awareness of the 
beacon was high, at approximately 60%. However, if the 
phone was in the user’s pocket, awareness fell to about 40%. 
Because it is dangerous to use a smartphone while walking 
on the road, different ways must be found to alert users to the 
beacon. In this regard, wearable devices such as smart 
watches might prove useful. This will be addressed in the 
next phase of our study. 
3) Overall evaluation 
We asked the participants to record their overall 
impression of sightseeing using the BLE beacon. The most 
common responses were ‘useful’ and ‘fun’.  
The map, in particular, contributed to a feeling of safety 
(2.77 in 3 grades) and the information about shops was 
appreciated (2.70 in 3 grades). Key comments on the 
‘SANDO’ (a Japanese road approaching the main shrine) 
included the following: ‘I found a small spring on the road’ 
and ‘The information on the little temple was good’. The 
participants appreciated the information triggered by the 
beacon. 
F. Second Trial: The Zeigarnik Effect 
Using the same beacons, we created quizzes about the 
road. These were tested on September 26 and 27, 2015.   
Twenty eight students participated in the test, of whom 
23 completed ten quizzes on the road to Toshogu Shrine and 
a control group of five students walked the route without the 
application. The participants were first asked to complete 
quizzes about the area, whose answers could be found by 
observing objects at the site. This study was based on a 
previous experiment using the Zeigarnik effect [15]. The 
participants were also asked to draw a map and to check 
some points on it. It is said that memory is mainly visual [16]. 
After the walk, the participants were first asked to 
complete a questionnaire and to draw a map of the area [17]. 
The answers given by users of the application were more 
concrete than those of the control group. Application users 
were able to place an average of 9.18 objects on the map 
from the station to the shrine, whereas the controls identified 
an average of only 5.80. Application users could not only 
remember the answers to the quiz questions but could also 
recall the shops near the beacon sites where they had 
answered the quiz. 
 
After a gap of a month, the participants completed 
another questionnaire and checked three points on a 
photograph from the route they had walked in Nikko. Heat 
maps were created on the basis of the responses. Four 
photographs of the route to the main shrine were used: two in 
the main shrine itself and two showing several characteristic 
points.  
Fig. 8 shows a heat map of the route to the main shrine. 
The participants paid no heed to the architecture along the 
route. This is in contrast to the photographs in the shrine 
where the gaze of the participants was directed to lettering. 
The red point is a restaurant sign with very big letters. 
Attention was also paid to written signs on the road. The 
street was recognized as the way to the main shrine. The 
yellow point shows that little attention was given to the BLE 
beacon in which no letters were present in the photograph.  
Fig. 9 shows that the participants paid heed to the 
architecture of the shrine, particularly to the upper part on 
the right side. This was in contrast with the approach route. 
  
 
Figure 8 Heat map on the way to the main shrine. 
 
 
Figure 9 Heat map in the shrine. 
 
The results confirmed that the use of the quizzes 
exploiting the Zeigarnik effect improves recall. Students 
remembered both the BLE beacon and the objects used in the 
quizzes.

The use of quizzes in the application helped users to 
recall the shops around the beacons immediately after the 
trial. In the future, we will expand the scope of our study to 
include ‘SANDO’ on the route to the main Toshogu Shrine.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Smartphone sightseeing applications offer several types 
of information. However, tourists visit sites to see real places 
and experience the real environment, while the smartphone is 
only a tool to enhance the experience. Thus, the information 
provided to the target audience must be refined. Tourists are 
not primarily motivated by convenience; in fact, unfamiliar 
experiences or inconvenience may actually arouse their 
curiosity. 
Traditional cultural locations have special historical or 
cultural significance. Introducing tourists to relevant cultural 
information about these locations helps to create a strong 
impression. 
Our 
application 
aims 
to 
provide 
such 
information. Owners of shops en route to the main shrine 
provided us with not only information concerning their shops 
but also local traditions and seasonal events, enriching the 
information available to tourists. A web questionnaire 
showed that tourists found the information about shops 
useful. In the survey, 89.2% of the respondents were under 
30 years of age. Foreigners could access the information 
using the English pages. 
Local information can be used to attract visitors to other 
cultural sites around the world, particularly in world heritage 
sites designated as special protection areas, where signboards 
are banned.  
Japanese students studied the history and specific 
artworks of the area before their school trip. By creating 
quizzes for their classmates and tackling quizzes that the 
others had prepared, interest was sparked. This provided the 
basis for our use of the Zeigarnik effect, in which completed 
tasks are less well-remembered than uncompleted tasks. 
Thus, we deliberately created incomplete experiences.  
 
We are planning a collaboration with Toshogu, the main 
shrine at Nikko. Each autumn, a portable shrine is carried 
along the ‘SANDOU’ route to the Toshogu Shrine in a 
procession of one thousand samurai. We will use our beacon 
technology and application to provide descriptions and 
explanations of the traditional clothing and customs. In this 
case, the participants in the procession will carry the beacons.  
Our main goal is to inform tourists about traditional 
cultures. Our system allows knowledge of the culture of a 
location to be transmitted to the next generation and to 
foreigners. Such travel information will inspire tourists and 
encourage them to treat the culture respectfully. We are 
planning to extend our collaboration to other world heritage 
sites as well.
