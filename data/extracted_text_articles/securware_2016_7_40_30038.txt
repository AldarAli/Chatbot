I.
INTRODUCTION
Requirements
for
electromagnetic
compatibility
of
products (in the European Union) are regulated by relevant
documents, which are issued as directives of the European
Parliament and
the Council of the European Union.
Currently, Directive 2014/30/EC on the harmonization of
the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic
compatibility regulates the electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC) requirements of products.
Verification of compliance with the electromagnetic
interference (EMI) requirements is realized in the form of
standardized tests - measuring the levels of electromagnetic
emissions. Components of alarm systems (control panel,
detectors,
keypad,
power
supply,
access
module,
communicator, etc.) as electronic or electrical equipment are
products
which
are
the
source
and
receiver
of
electromagnetic interference too [1].
The
intention
of
EMI
standards
is
to
establish
requirements for methods of measurement, to fix limits of
disturbance, to describe general measurement conditions,
recording and interpretation of measurement results, etc.
Requirements
for
measurement
conditions
include
in
particular
configuration,
arrangement,
installation
and
operation
of
the
Equipment
Under
Test
(EUT).
Requirements for configuration and operation are not
uniform. This may result in differences in measurement
results.
A.
Basic definitions
EUT-representative equipment or functionally interactive
group of equipments (system) which includes one or more
host unit(s) and is used for evaluation purposes.
Configuration - mode of operation and other operational
conditions of the EUT.
Arrangement - physical layout of the EUT that includes
connected peripherals/ associated equipment within the test
area [2][3].
An analysis of requirements that are applicable to the
configuration of intrusion and hold-up alarm system (IHAS)
when measuring the radiated electromagnetic disturbances is
presented in Section 2. Section 3 presents a comparison of
requirements for EUT configuration.
II.
CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS FOR EQUIPMENT
UNDER TEST
Configuration of the EUT within the verification of EMC
parameters represents the determination of the manner of its
operation and the determination of next operating conditions.
EUT configuration requirements are set forth in the relevant
legislation, but especially in the technical standards EMC
(basic, generic and product) for different types of tests.
A.
EU Legislation – Directive 2014/30/EU
The currently valid EMC Directive 2014/30/EU on the
harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to
electromagnetic compatibility sets out in particular the
following configuration requirements for EUT:
•
The electromagnetic compatibility assessment shall
take into account all normal intended operating
conditions,
•
The equipment shall meet the essential requirements
in
the
configurations
foreseeable
by
the
manufacturer as representative of normal use in the
intended applications,
•
During the test it is sufficient to perform an
assessment on the basis of the configuration most
likely to cause maximum disturbance [2].

1)
Historical EU requirements according to Directive
2004/108/EC
The directive, which applied from 2005 to 2016, includes
almost the same configurations requirements as a currently
valid Directive 2014/30/EU. In 2007, the manual was
published Guide for the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC. Guide
explains and clarifies some of the most important aspects
related to application of the directive (including EUT
configuration requirements).
The basic requirement is an assessment on the basis of
the
configuration
most
likely
to
cause
maximum
disturbances. This method is often referred to as the “worst
case” scenario [4].
Previous Directive 1989/336/ EEC (valid 1992-2007) not
describe issues of the configuration of the EUT within the
parameters of EMC verification. EMC Directive 76/889/
EEC was valid during the period 1976-1992. This directive
has set out the following configuration requirements:
•
apparatus is to be operated under normal operating
conditions
as
indicated
in
the
manufacturer's
instructions,
•
for individual types of products directive sets out a
standardized load.
B.
National legislation - Govermment Decree No.
616/2006 Coll. on technical requirements for products
in terms of electromagnetic compatibility
The electromagnetic compatibility assessment shall take
into account all normal intended operating conditions. EMC
test shall confirm whether the EUT meets the essential
requirements in all the possible configurations identified by
the manufacturer as representative of its intended use.
C.
Basic standard EN 55016-2-3
The standard EN 55016-2-3 ed. 3 (Specification for radio
disturbance and immunity measuring apparatus and methods,
Part 2-3: Methods of measurement of disturbances and
immunity- Radiated disturbance measurements) represents
the basic standard for the implementation of the radiated
disturbance measurement (regardless of the type of EUT).
This standard sets out particular, the following EUT
configuration requirements:
•
the testing of equipment shall satisfy the following
conditions:
a) EUT is configured for use of typical manner,
b) EUT is configured is a manner that will maximize
disturbance,
•
During measurement, the configuration of EUT shall
be adjusted so that the above two conditions, the
conditions a) being satisfied first and followed by
conditions b),
•
Interface cables shall be connected to each interface
port on the EUT,
•
The normal load conditions shall be as defined in the
product specification,
•
EUT
should
be
tested
in
different
modes
of
operation [7].
D.
Generic standard EN 61000-6-3
Standard EN 61000-6-3 ed. 2 (Emission standard for
residential, commercial and light-industrial environments)
specifies requirements for products and systems operating in
residential or industrial environments. This standard in
particular
sets
out
the
following
EUT
configuration
requirements:
•
EUT operation mode must be selected in relation to
the highest expected emissions,
•
All types of input/output ports shall be tested,
•
In the case where the EUT may be part of another
system, it must be tested in a minimum configuration
of auxiliary equipments necessary for the operation
of its inputs,
•
EUT configuration shall be varied in order to find
the
maximum
emissions
(within
the
typical
applications and installation) [8].
1)
Historical configuration requirements according to
EN 50081-1
In the past, previous technical standard EN 50081-1
(valid
from
1994
to
2004)
has
set
the
following
requirements, for example:
•
If the EUT has a large number of terminals, it is
necessary to select their sufficient number so as to
simulate actual operating conditions,
•
The operating mode of EUT corresponds to the
normal use [9].
The configuration requirements of EUT are described
very briefly.

Information
technology equipment- Radio disturbance characteristics -
Limits and methods of measurement sets out limits and
procedures for the measurement of the levels of spurious
signals generated by the Information Technology Equipment
(ITE). These requirements are also applied to components of
alarm systems. The measurement conditions include, in
particular:
•
The EUT shall be configured, installed, arranged and
operated
in
a
manner
consistent
with
typical
applications,
•
The operational conditions of the EUT shall be
determined by the producer according to the typical
use of the EUT with respect to the excepted highest
level of emission,
•
Interface cables, load and devices shall be connected
to at least one of each type of port of the EUT,
•
Multifunction equipment shall be tested with each
function operated in isolation,
•
A system that consist a number of separate units
shall
be
configured
to
form
a
minimum
representative configuration [3].
Where there are multiple interface ports of the same type,
additional cables, loads or devices may have to be added to
the EUT depending upon the result of preliminary tests (the
actual number of additional cables may be limited to the
condition where the addition of another cable does not

significantly affect the emission level, i.e. varies less than 2
dB, provided that EUT remains compliant).

measurement of electromagnetic emission of the alarm
system component (relay module). The differences in
measured values are due to differences in the number of
connected electrical load.

F.
Military standards
Military standard MIL STD 461 establishes requirements
for the control of the electromagnetic compatibility of
electronic, electrical, and electromechanical equipments and
subsystems designed or procured for use by activities and
agencies of the Department of Defense (DoD) [10]. In the
Czech Republic, these requirements are implemented in a
defense standard COS 599902. Standard sets out the
following configuration requirements of the EUT:
•
During emission measurements, the EUT shall be
placed
in
an
operating
mode
which
produces
maximum emissions.
•
For EUT with several available modes, a sufficient
number of modes shall be tested for emissions such
that all circuitry is evaluated,
•
All electrical input and output interfaces shall be
terminated with either the actual equipment from the
platform installation or loads which simulate the
electrical properties (impedance, grounding, balance,
etc.) present in the actual installation,
•
When variable electrical loading is present in the
actual installation, testing shall be performed under
expected worst case conditions [5].
A prerequisite for maximum emission levels are the
conditions under which the EUT draws the highest primary
supply current. The result is the highest activity of interface
circuits and generating the maximum current consumed for
the digital signals internal time base.
III.
COMPARISON OF REQUIREMENTS FOR CONFIGURATION
EQUIPMENT UNDER TEST
Legal and technical regulations set out many operational
variants (EUT configurations).
Table
I.
presents
application
possibilities
of
EUT
configuration during EMC measurements. Configuration
options correspond and can be met in accordance with the
standard technical thinking. Test engineer configures EUT in
cooperation with the manufacturer. For normal products
(e.g., personal computer) is not a problem to determine the
representative configuration (PC, monitor, keyboard, mouse,
loud-speakers,
etc.),
but
opinions
may
differ
on
the
configuration of specific products (e.g., IHAS). The notion
"normal operating conditions" may be understood differently
for IHAS (status arm, disarm status, alarm status, fault status,
service mode). From a technical perspective, variants of
configuration that are set by regulations can be regarded as
comparable, so as synonyms. Variants can be divided into
several groups:
a) typical application (foreseeable configurations, usual
usage, common operating conditions, normal operating
conditions, standardized load,
normal installation practice,
normal composition of system, typical installation, typical
mode, typical load condition,
configuration according to
manufacturer, active mode),
b) worst operating conditions (worst case, expected
worst case conditions, experimental configuration changes,
maximum current consumption of EUT, expected highest
emission levels),
c) actual usage (simulation of the actual operating
conditions, operating mode according to the acquisitions
requirements),
d) minimum configurations (minimum representative
configurations, configuration with one of each type module,
at least one cable for each type of interface, gradual addition
of cables and modules
e)
maximum
configuration
(all
representative
configurations, operation using test programs, test for each
function operated in isolation, all possible configurations
according to producer, cables connected to each port of the
EUT),
f)
standby mode
We distinguish typical and actual use. Actual use may
not always be typical, e.g., in a situation where the user uses
only additional functions of the product (e.g., IHAS may be
utilized to control a large number of non-alarm applications
and alarm functions will be utilized at a minimum). We
distinguish the concepts of maximum configuration and
"worst case". EMI of EUT at maximum configuration may
not always be the highest [6].
This classification does not solve the problem of practical
measurement EMI in terms of configuration settings EUT.
There still remain a few other different configurations.

TABLE I. THE EUT CONFIGURATION VARIANTS
During a test, a manufacturer or a testing engineer does
not always know exactly:
•
The environment where the product (EU) is used,
•
The real production version of the EUT (risk of
additional production adjustments and changes),
•
The real configuration in practice,
•
The real types of connected peripherals,
•
The distance between the EUT and peripherals,
•
The range of EUT integration with other devices or
systems,
•
The typical operating mode in practical application,
•
The installation technology, etc.
A Testing engineer searches the maximum levels of EMI
(usually by changing the orientation of the EUT, changing
adjustable operating modes, height and polarization of
measurement antennas). Actual installation and operating
conditions of EUT can be different in a practical application.
IV.
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
The most common laws and standards set the following
configurations:
•
The
typical
applications
(33%
of
total
recommendations),
•
The worst operating conditions (29%),
•
The maximum configuration (16%),
•
The actual usage (10%),
•
The minimum representative configurations (10%).
Most often, technical standards specify configuration
according to typical applications or configuration with the
expected highest emission levels. However, often also they
recommend
other
operating
modes
and
configurations
(maximum configuration, minimum configuration, actual
usage, etc.). Requirements vary widely. This situation is not
ideal
within
the
the
measurement
of
electromagnetic
radiation disturbances. It would be appropriate that the EUT
configuration
requirements
were
precisely
defined
for
individual EMC tests. The opposite situation may result in
the divergent interpretation of the provision of technical
standards.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The article analyzes the configuration requirements of
security alarm system during a measurement of radiated
electromagnetic interference. Legal and technical regulations
set out the many operational variants of EUT configuration.
Requirements for configuration and operation are not
uniform. This may result in differences in measurement
results. Most often, the technical standards recommended
configuration according typical applications or configuration
with the expected highest emission levels. However, often
also
they
recommend
other
operating
modes
and
configurations
(maximum
configuration,
minimum
configuration, actual usage, etc.). These terms can be
interpreted differently. Requirements analysis forms the
initial part of the research, which will continue by thorough
experimental
measurement
and
evaluation
of
electromagnetic radiation of the security alarm systems,
including
an
optimization
proposal
of
configuration
requirements. A thorough comparison between the proposed
requirements and related standards will be done. This is

in standards. Currently, a separate technical standard for EMI
