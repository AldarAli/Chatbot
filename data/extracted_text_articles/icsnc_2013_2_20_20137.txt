Abstract—This paper addresses the problem of ambiguity in 
the acquisition of binary offset carrier (BOC) signals employed 
in global navigation satellite systems, which is caused by the 
multiple side-peaks of the BOC autocorrelation function. We 
first observe that the side-peaks arise due to the fact that the 
BOC autocorrelation is made up of the sum of the sub-
correlations shaped irregularly, and then, propose a novel 
unambiguous 
BOC 
acquisition 
scheme 
based 
on 
a 
recombination of the sub-correlations. The proposed scheme is 
demonstrated to remove the side-peaks completely for any type 
of BOC signals and to provide a performance improvement 
over the conventional scheme in terms of the receiver 
operating characteristic and mean acquisition time.

INTRODUCTION 
Recently, new global navigation satellite systems 
(GNSSs) such as Galileo and global positioning system 
(GPS) modernization are being developed to satisfy the 
increasing demand for GNSS-based services such as 
location-based service (LBS) and emergency rescue service 
(ERS) and complement the existing GNSSs such as GPS [1]-
[3]. Currently, new GNSSs are designed to use the same 
frequency band of the existing GNSSs: for example, the E1 
and E5 bands of Galileo are overlapped with the L1 and L5 
bands of GPS, respectively [1], [4]. Thus, if a Galileo signal 
is modulated by a conventional scheme such as phase shift 
keying (PSK) used in GPS, it would suffer from co-channel 
interference. To overcome these problems, binary offset 
carrier (BOC) modulation has been proposed, where a high 
degree of spectral separation between the BOC-modulated 
signals and the others is achieved by shifting the signal 
energy from the band center [5]. The BOC signal is 
generated through the product of a spreading pseudo random 
noise (PRN) code and a sine-phased or cosine-phased square 
wave sub-carrier, and denoted by 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n
 or 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  depending on which of the sine-phased and 
cosine-phased sub-carriers are used, where k  and n  are the 
ratios of the PRN code chip period to the sub-carrier period 
and the PRN code chip rate to 1.023 MHz, respectively [4], 
[6]. For larger values of ,k  more separated spectrums are 
obtained, reducing the co-channel interference more 
effectively. However, the BOC signal has multiple side-
peaks on both sides of the main-peak of its autocorrelation 
function, causing an ambiguity problem in the BOC signal 
synchronization. Moreover, the number of side-peaks 
increases as the value of k
 becomes larger. The 
synchronization process of BOC signals consists of two 
stages: Acquisition and tracking. The acquisition process 
aligns the locally generated BOC signal with the received 
signal within a chip duration, and then, the tracking process 
performs 
fine 
synchronization 
and 
maintains 
the 
synchronized lock point. To solve the ambiguity problem, 
several unambiguous acquisition schemes [7]-[11] and 
tracking schemes [12]-[14] have been proposed. In [7]-[9], 
sideband filtering was used to deal with the ambiguity 
problem in the BOC signal acquisition; however, these 
schemes destroy the sharpness of the main-peak of the BOC 
autocorrelation function, degrading the BOC signal tracking 
performance severely. In [10], an interesting unambiguous 
acquisition scheme that maintains the sharp main-peak of the 
BOC autocorrelation function was proposed combining the 
correlation between the BOC and PRN signals with the BOC 
autocorrelation; however, this scheme is applicable to only 
BOCsin
(
kn n)
,
 signals. In [11], an extended unambiguous 
acquisition scheme including the scheme in [10] as a special 
case was proposed. This scheme is applicable to generic 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n signals; however, its extension to generic 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  signals is not straightforward since it uses the 
designed local signals for 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n signals. In [12]-[14], 
on the other hand, unambiguous tracking schemes have been 
proposed by employing side-peak cancellation techniques in 
a delay lock loop, focusing on the tracking process of the 
BOC signals, and they are applicable to BOCsin(kn,n) and 
BOCcos(kn,n) signals. In this paper, we focus on acquisition 
of the BOC signals. 
In this paper, a novel unambiguous acquisition scheme 
applicable to both 
BOCsin
(
, )
kn n  and 
BOCcos
(
, )
kn n  signals  
is proposed based on a recombination of the sub-correlations 
making up the BOC autocorrelation, which is found to 
remove the side-peaks of the BOC autocorrelation 
completely, while keeping the sharp shape of the main-peak, 
and also, to offer a performance improvement over the 
scheme in [11] in terms of the correlation function, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves (which is the 
probability of detection

and would be generally limited to be equal to or less than the

are sub-correlations making up the correlations (3) and (4), 
respectively, and which are shown for 
k = 1
 and k = 2  in the 
absence of noise in Fig. 1. From the figure, we can see that  
the main-peaks of the sub-correlations are coherently 
combined through the summation of the sub-correlations, 
thus 
forming 
the 
sharp 
main-peak 
of 
the 
BOC 
autocorrelation, and on the other hand, the sub-peaks of the 
sub-correlations are irregularly spread around the main-peaks, 
and thus, the summation of the sub-correlations results in the 
multiple side-peaks of the BOC autocorrelation. Another 
important observation is that the number of the side-peaks 
increases as k increases. From this observation, it is expected 
that the acquisition performance is degraded as k increases. 
In the next section, we propose a novel unambiguous 
acquisition scheme, removing the side-peaks completely 
through a recombination of the sub-correlations.

 are symmetric with 
respect to 
τ = 0
 and have only a single overlapped peak at 
τ = 0
 for BOCsin(kn,n) and BOCcos(kn,n), respectively. Thus, 
if the two sub-correlations are summed, a main-peak with a 
larger magnitude (than that of the main-peak of a sub-
correlation) is obtained without increasing the magnitudes of 
the side-peaks, and on the other hand, the difference between 
the two sub-correlations yields side-peaks only, whose 
magnitudes and positions are the same as those of the side-
peaks in the sum of the two sub-correlations. Thus, the 
difference between the two sub-correlations might be used to 
remove the side-peaks in the sum of the two sub-correlations, 
leaving only the main-peak. This observation is the key 
motivation of the proposed scheme.  
Since the side-peaks in the sum and difference of the two 
sub-correlations are out-of-phase and in-phase at 
τ < 0
 and 
τ > 0
, respectively, however, we cannot remove the side-
peaks in the sum of the two sub-correlations completely 
through the subtraction between the sum and difference of 
the two sub-correlations. To align the phases of the side-
peaks in the sum and difference of the two sub-correlations, 
thus, we use the sum of the absolute values of the two sub-
correlations, obtaining the side-peaks with the same slopes as 
those of the side-peaks in the absolute difference of the two 
sub-correlations. Fig. 2 shows that the subtraction of the 
absolute difference of the two sub-correlations from the sum 
of the absolute values of the two sub-correlations yields an

unambiguous correlation function with a single main-peak 
and no side-peak.  
Since the unambiguous correlation function is generated 
with several absolute operations, it may suffer from 
undesired noise enhancement. To alleviate the noise 
enhancement while maintaining the signal part (i.e., the 
main-peak), we first multiply the unambiguous correlation 
function with each of the sub-correlations, and then, sum the 
product results together. Since the noise random variables

BOCsin(kn,n) and BOCcos(kn,n), respectively.

NUMERICAL RESULTS  
In this section, the proposed unambiguous acquisition 
scheme is compared with the unambiguous acquisition 
scheme in [11] called the general removing ambiguity via 
side-peak suppression (GRASS) in terms of the correlation 
function, ROC curves, MAT. In comparisons, we assume the 
following parameters: Galileo E1-C PRN code of 
T = 4092chips
 [4], correlation length of 
L = 1023,
 and a 
search step size of 
sT  and 
sT / 2
 for the sine-phased and 
cosine-phased BOC signals, respectively.

peaks completely for both BOCsin(kn,n) and BOCcos(kn,n) 
regardless of the value of .k

 when 
k = 1
 and k = 2. The three schemes are 
compared with the results in the AWGN environments when 
the carrier-to-noise ratios (CNRs) are 20 and 30 dB-Hz, 
where the CNR is defined as 
P N0
/
 (dB-Hz). From the 
figure, it is observed that the relative performance of the 
proposed and traditional BOC schemes is the same, whereas 
the proposed scheme offers a performance improvement over 
the GRASS scheme.  
As shown in Fig. 5, it is seen that the traditional BOC 
scheme provides the best ROC performances; however, it 
should be noted the probabilities of detection and false alarm 
of the ROC curve are associated with only the main-peak of 
the correlation function, i.e., the ROC curve does not reflect 
the effect of the side-peaks elimination. Thus, we compare 
the MAT performances of the three schemes as shown in Fig. 
6, where the penalty time and the probability of false alarm 
are set to 4T  and 
3
10 ,
−
 respectively. As shown in the

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a novel unambiguous 
BOC acquisition scheme for GNSSs. First, we have analyzed 
that the BOC autocorrelation is made up of the sum of 
several sub-correlations, and then, observed that the irregular 
shapes of the sub-correlations cause the side-peaks in the 
BOC autocorrelation. Then, we have proposed an 
unambiguous correlation function with no side-peak via a 
recombination of the sub-correlations. From numerical 
results, it has been observed that the proposed scheme 
removes the side-peaks completely providing a performance 
improvement over the GRASS and traditional BOC schemes 
in terms of the ROC curves and MAT.
