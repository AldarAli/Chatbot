Abstract — The large number of product variants, produced to 
satisfy customers, increases significantly the complexity of 
manufacturing systems. As a consequence, new approaches to 
deal with production processes are required. Because of the 
impact of complexity on productivity, it is in the first place 
important to understand what complexity is and what are its 
main drivers. Based on real data, a model is suggested to 
characterize workstations complexity.  The model is presented 
and its validity and accuracy are discussed. This paper defines 
complexity in a production environment and it proposes an 
identifier for complex assembly workstations. This definition is 
able  to characterize different manufacturing systems and  to 
define a system as high complex or low complex.

 INTRODUCTION 
Over the last couple of years, in automotive industry, the 
number of introductions of new and different car models has 
increased drastically. These new models are mainly 
introduced to answer consumers’ needs [1], but also because 
of the new generation of electrical driven products.   
The increase of product variety is necessary to answer the 
market and sustainability demands, however this high variety 
makes the mixed-model assembly lines become rather 
complex.  The introduction of new models increases the 
complexity 
of 
(re)designing 
factory 
processes 
and 
workstations, and consequently increases significantly the 
overall complexity of the production system. 
Currently, one can conclude that the elements presented 
above, increase the manufacturing complexity but the exact 
causes and impacts on manufacturing processes are still 
unknown. This paper proposes a clear and objective 
definition of production complexity and attempts to 
determine its main drivers. To this end, the drivers of 
complexity are determined and a model is proposed enabling  
to define  the complexity of a workstation.   
The approach used is based both on theoretical and 
practical information, i.e. as a result of literature study and 
interactions with manufacturers. Section II presents a brief 
literature 
review 
and 
describes 
complexity 
in 
the 
manufacturing domain. In Section III, a complexity 
definition is proposed and the methodology of the study is 
presented. Section IV presents the results obtained and 
discusses some perspectives. The conclusions and future 
work  are presented in Section V.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Lately, there has been a growing interest in the study of 
complexity of manufacturing processes and systems [2] [3].  
One can distinguish three types of complexity: product 
complexity, process complexity and operational complexity. 
According to literature, one of the influencing factors of 
complexity is the manipulation of information. Complexity 
is directly related to the quantity of information, diversity of 
information and the information content [4]. The human 
element is also important [5] since it  influences system 
performance.  Moreover, complexity increases with the 
number of different product variants to be produced and the 
number of tasks within the production process [4]. 
In an attempt to understand complexity, its main drivers 
are determined and a taxonomy is proposed. The drivers of 
complexity are identified as:  uncertainty, dynamics, 
multiplicity, variety, interactions and interdependencies [6] 
and a combination of such proprieties can render a system 
complex or not complex. A specific taxonomy is proposed 
where complexity is split in static and dynamic [7]. Static 
complexity is associated with  the product, whereas dynamic 
complexity is linked to the process. 
Although until now different approaches have been 
developed associating manufacturing complexity to product, 
process and human operator, it should be emphasized that 
there is to the best of our knowledge no existing model that 
quantifies the relationship between complexity as perceived 
by the operators and its drivers. This is the focus of this 
paper. In the following section a definition of complexity 
within the domain of this work is introduced.  
III. 
PRODUCTION COMPLEXITY DEFINITION AND 
METHODOLOGY 
The research on which this paper is based was carried out 
within the vehicle industry of Belgium and Sweden, 
including both OEM’s and their suppliers. The focus is 
therefore on workstations along a driven assembly line, 
which work on different vehicle models in a mixed model

fashion. The research was subsequently carried out in three 
steps.  
A. Complexity Definition 
A good definition of complexity has to be generic enough 
to be applicable to different manufacturing systems and  at 
the same time specific enough to guide the decision whether 
a system is complex or not. Although the literature review 
provided useful insights about manufacturing complexity, 
there still existed a need for a clear, simple and generic 
complexity definition. After extensive communication with 
the project partners the following definition is proposed:  
 
“Complexity is the sum of all aspects and elements that 
makes a task or a set of tasks mentally difficult, error-prone, 
requiring thinking and vigilance and inducing stress”. 
 
This definition recognizes the fact that complexity of 
tasks is determined to a large extent by the person that 
executes them, hence termed subjective complexity. In many 
cases the same set of tasks can be judged  differently by 
different people under different circumstances. This makes 
quantifying complexity in an unambiguous manner, the 
objective complexity, a real challenge. This paper focuses on 
how to measure complexity in an objective, repeatable 
manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
B. Model Building Workshops 
A series of workshops was done in collaboration with a 
group of automotive manufacturers, to gather knowledge 
about complexity in industry. Components of complexity 
were identified and classified as drivers or impacts and used 
to build a model.  
Those workshops were a great opportunity to study and 
explore real manufacturing situations where complexity is 
present.  In order to be able to gather as much useful 
information as possible, the participants included shop floor 
employees, production engineers, quality controllers and line 
management, who deal with complexity in their daily 
activities. All workshops were organized in a similar way: 
Initially, the project objectives were explained to all 
participants. Next, the participants were asked to identify 
some low and some high complex workstations.  Afterwards,  
three sets of open questions were presented to them and 
during a limited period of time they could reflect 
individually how these questions applied to the low and high 
complex cases respectively.  
The goal of presenting the questions was to situate and 
identify how complexity is experienced. The questions were 
structured in three different sets. The first set focused on 
characterizing complexity. The second set of questions 
concentrated on revealing which consequences complexity 
has. The questions focus on  the areas that are affected by 
complexity and on the influence of complexity on 
manufacturing work and teams. The third set of questions 
aimed at detecting the direct drivers of complexity, i.e. the 
variables that are directly linked to the complexity elements 
as causal factors. 
 Finally, after the participants’ individual analysis, a 
brainstorming session was done where a list of ideas were 
discussed and  gathered.  
As the result of these workshops a high amount of 
important information was produced.  In the next subsection, 
a causal model is presented as an outcome of the 
investigation of this information. 
C. Causal model 
As a result of the workshops, a causal model is defined 
with the goal to obtain a generic complexity model.  
The model  clusters the variables related with complexity

characterization (first set of questions), complexity impacts 
(second set of questions), and complexity drivers (third set of 
questions)  into groups. Fig. 1 shows how the three 
categories of variables are linked together. As a result of the 
workshops, a causal model is defined with the goal to obtain 
a generic complexity model.  
The model  clusters the variables related with complexity 
characterization, complexity impacts, and complexity drivers 
into groups. Fig. 1 shows how the three categories of 
variables are linked together. 
 Complexity drivers are the variables that are linked with 
the source  of complexity and are therefore represented at the 
top of the figure. 
 Next, complexity characteristics describe complexity. 
These characteristics are clustered into 2 main groups: 
objective complexity and perceived complexity. The main 
difference between both groups is that objective complexity 
can be analyzed quantitatively on external values, while 
perceived complexity can only be studied through the 
cognitive behavior of the operators. The authors decided to 
focus their research on the objective measurement of 
complexity. The subjective complexity was studied by a 
separate team in Sweden.    
Finally, complexity impacts were derived from objective 
and perceived complexity. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The information obtained through the workshops was 
thus structured in a highly detailed causal model. Fig. 1 only 
shows an extract of the model, detailing the 11 direct drivers 
of complexity that were identified. These were further 
investigated. 
A. Complexity drivers 
The list of complexity-driving variables is presented in 
Table I together with a concise explanation of each variable. 
The next question to tackle was to characterize the relation 
between these variables and complexity, in an attempt to 
build a model. This set of variables is crucial to recognize 
what increases or decreases complexity.  In order to now 
develop an objective complexity identifier for work stations, 
a dataset was created with the  collaboration of the 
participants of the workshops.

B. Experimental Dataset 
Using the list presented in Table I, the manufacturing 
collaborators were asked to select five workstations and 
define the value for each variable (driver). Moreover they 
were asked to classify  each workstation as low complex  or 
high complex. The result is a dataset composed of  76 
workstations, 41 classified as low complex and 35 classified 
high complex, and the respective driver values.

In order to have more control over the scaling of each 
variable, we set up a Likert scale for each variable, dividing 
the data range over 4 levels on the scale. The result is shown 
in Table II.

C. Initial Model  
A complexity measurement is developed based on a 
weighted sum of the 11 variables. This measure determines 
if workstations have a low or high complexity  according to 
equations 1 and 2:  
where: 
- 
 basic complexity(w) is the complexity score of a 
workstation w, 
- 
Score(i)  is the value of the variable i according to 
the Likert scale, 
- 
Weight(i) is the weight of the variable i, 
- 
max i is the maximum score value for variable i, 
- 
min i is the minimum score value for variable i, 
- 
complexity(w) is the complexity score of a 
workstation normalized into a scale from 0 to 10. 
 
Fig. 2 shows the result of the calculated complexity 
measure compared with the subjective labels of LOW and 
HIGH complexity for  each of the 76 workstations. The score 
for the LOW complexity workstations averages 4,8 and 
HIGH averages 7,2. The calculated score seems to 
distinguish HIGH from LOW complexity workstations, so 
the variables it is based on do seem to have a relation with 
the subjective complexity level. However, there is quite 
some fluctuation in the complexity scores. This suggests that 
not all variables have the same explanatory power, or even 
that some variables contradict others. Therefore, the next 
step is to adjust the weights or reduce the number of 
variables. In the following subsection a statistical model is 
developed to achieve just that. 
D. Statistical model 
The objective is to determine a good model for the 
prediction of the complexity of a workstation (high or low), 
based on the data gathered for the 76 work stations and their 
characterizing values for each of the 11 variables shown in 
Table I. Since the independent variable ‘complexity’ is a 
binary variable – it is either high or low – Logistic 
Regression is chosen for the analysis. In the analysis a 
prediction 0 corresponds to a high complex station, whereas

a prediction 1 corresponds to a low complex station. 
Logistic regression will calculate the probability that the 
workstation’s complexity is high or low from a combination 
of variable values in the following way: 
Odds =

1- P = eA+BX
Ln(Odds) = A+ BX = a+b1x1 +b2x2 +...

Based on all 76 cases, a model could be found with only 
4 of the variables, able to classify 84% of all 76 cases 
correctly. The output is presented in TABLE III.  
In the output, it can be seen that the predictive variables 
are: 
- 
the Likert scale value for the number of packaging 
types,  
- 
the number of assembly directions as measured 
directly 
- 
the Likert scale value for the number of  different 
parts in the workstation 
- 
the number of work methods as measured directly 
 
Of the 35 workstations identified as high complex, 31 
could correctly be predicted as high complex by the model. 
Of the 41 workstations identified as low complex, 33 could 
correctly be predicted as low complex by the model. Fig. 3 
shows the results.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper proposes a definition of production 
complexity 
wide 
enough 
to 
characterize 
different 
manufacturing systems and  at the same time specific enough  
to define a system as high complex or low complex. A set of 
complexity direct drivers is extracted from real production 
data and interactions with manufacturers.  Based on this set 
of complexity direct drivers two different complexity models 
are developed with the goal to measure and determine if 
workstations have a low and high complexity. 
An initial model is proposed based on a complexity 
measure score. Then a statistical model is proposed based on 
logistic regression. To validate the proposed models, a set of 
experiments were carried out based in a set of 76 
workstations which were classified as low or high complex. 
Initially this set contained 41 workstations classified as low 
complex and 35 workstations classified as high complex. 
The initial model was able to classify 82% of the

workstations correctly and the statistical model 84% of the 
workstations correctly.  
The results obtained by the two models, provide some 
insight into the complexity-driving variables and their related 
scores. The results could also be used to measure the impact 
of complexity on both direct and indirect costs. They can 
also be useful for the subjective interpretation of complexity 
by the operator in the workstation. 
The models give important insights in the impact of 
certain complexity drivers. Using the information from the 
models one should look into the extreme cases with wrong 
subjective labels, to assess whether the subjective label is 
wrong or not. In the former case this will enhance the value 
and validity of the models, and yield information about the 
subjective reasoning that led to the wrong classification. In 
the future the validity of the models should be further 
studied.
