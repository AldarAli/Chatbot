Abstract—
Quantum
systems
are
inherently
infinite
dimensional.
In
particular
quantum
computers
will
use
quantum systems as gates to store and manipulate information.
But such systems suffer from decoherence which is caused by
the quantum gate becoming entangled with its environment
and losing
information into
that
quantum environment.
Feedback
control
has
the
promise
of
reducing
this
decoherence, but the feedback must be adaptive in the sense
that it can perform its control tasks with very little information
about the details of the quantum system itself. This paper is
concerned with providing a framework for adaptive control of
infinite dimensional quantum systems. The quantum system is
described as a linear continuous-time infinite-dimensional
plant on a complex Hilbert space with persistent disturbances
of known waveform but unknown amplitude and phase caused
by fluctuations in the external quantum environment. We show
here that there is a stabilizing direct model reference adaptive
control
law
with
disturbance
rejection
and
robustness
properties. The plant is described by a closed, densely defined
linear operator, which is the Hamiltonian of the quantum
system that generates a continuous semigroup of bounded
operators on the complex Hilbert space of states. There is no
state or disturbance estimation used in this adaptive approach.
We show that adaptive control can produce convergence of a
quantum
system
to
a
Decoherence-Free
Subspace.
Our
research direction continues on using our developing research
in adaptive control of infinite dimensional systems to explore
how these feedback control ideas in conjunction with quantum
gates and quantum error correction can reduce decoherence in
quantum information and computing.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum systems are inherently infinite dimensional. In
particular quantum computers will use quantum systems as
gates to store and manipulate information. But such systems
suffer from decoherence which is caused by the quantum
gate becoming entangled with its environment and losing
information
into
that
quantum
environment.
Feedback
control has the promise of reducing this decoherence, but the
feedback must be adaptive in the sense that it can perform its
control tasks with very little information about the details of
the quantum system itself. This paper is concerned with
providing a framework for adaptive control of infinite
dimensional quantum systems.
The quantum system is described as a linear continuous-
time infinite-dimensional plant on a complex Hilbert space
with
persistent
disturbances
of
known
waveform
but
unknown amplitude and phase caused by fluctuations in the
external quantum environment. We show here that there is a
stabilizing direct model reference adaptive control law with
disturbance rejection and robustness properties. The plant is
described by a closed, densely defined linear operator, which
is the Hamiltonian of the quantum system that generates a
continuous semigroup of bounded operators on the complex
Hilbert space of states. There is no state or disturbance
estimation used in this adaptive approach.
Our overall direction is on using our developing research
in adaptive control of infinite dimensional systems to explore
how these feedback control ideas in conjunction with
quantum gates and quantum error correction can reduce
decoherence in quantum information and computing.

[4] and [7], for persistent disturbances:

where F is a marginally stable matrix and
( )
D t
is a vector of
known functions forming a basis for all the possible
disturbances. This is known as “a disturbance with known
waveform but unknown amplitudes”. We can easily show
that an operator L exists to relate the persistent disturbances
to a known basis vector

, but the adaptive controller
will not need to know the actual L .

If

exist,
they
will
be
linear
combinations of disturbance state, and they will produce
exact output tracking in a disturbance-free plant (8).
By substitution of (5) into (6), we obtain the Model

Now we consider the definition of Strict Dissipativity for
infinite-dimensional systems and the general form of the
“adaptive error system” to prove stability. The main theorem
of this section will later be utilized to assess the convergence
and stability of the adaptive controller with disturbance
rejection for linear diffusion systems.
Noting that there can be some ambiguity in the literature
with the definition of strictly dissipative systems, we modify
the suggestion of Wen in [8] for finite dimensional systems
and expand it to include infinite dimensional systems.

V.
CONVERGENCE TO A SUBSPACE
In many cases, and especially in quantum information
systems, e.g. [2], it is desirable to have all state trajectories
converge to appropriate well-behaved subspaces. In the
Quantum systems situation, the appropriate subspace is a
“decoherence-free subspace” as described in [20]-[22].
These
subspaces
are
finite-dimensional, Hamiltonian
-
invariant subspaces of the Schrodinger partial differential
equation
representing
the
quantum
dynamics
of
the
information system. In such a subspace S the decoherence
effects of the environment are removed, i.e. the Schrodinger
dynamic group is unitary on S and thus preserves the
energy in all states in the decoherence-free subspace.
Therefore, within S , quantum information can be handled
with quantum gates that do not lose information through
decoherence.
In this section, we will deal with the general problem of
adaptively
controlling
the
states
of
a
linear
infinite-
dimensional system to converge to a prescribed subspace.
The prescribed subspace S will be an A-invariant subspace
of
the
state
space
X
in
(1)
with
dim
.
S
 N
 
Consequently S is closed and X

S 


.
Let
orthogonal projection onto S along S

the complementary bounded projection. We
define Convergence to a Subspace S of a trajectory

or equivalently

VI. APPLICATION: ADAPTIVE CONTROL OF
HAMILTONIAN QUANTUM SYSTEMS
In general, the dynamics of quantum systems are
described by the Schrodinger wave equation on a complex
Hilbert space [18]-[19]. We will apply the above direct
adaptive controller on the following single-input/single-
output Cauchy problem which represents a feedback-
controlled quantum system with one control actuator and one
sensor:

(15)
where A is the Hamiltonian operator for the quantum system
which is self-adjoint, has compact resolvent, and generates a
0
C semigroup.
From the compact resolvent property, we have that every
state in the Hilbert space can be represented as
1
k

k

where
k are the orthonormal eigenstates of A and are the

in the presence of

We note that quantum control would more likely be done
with a master equation involving density operators rather
than the usual Schrodinger equation in (15); also, the
interaction with the environment would be modelled by an
appropriate Lindblad operator. But the above gives a start at
a framework for adaptive quantum control.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In Theorem 1, we showed conditions under which ideal
trajectories exist for a linear infinite-dimensional system to
be capable of rejecting a persistent disturbance in the output
of the plant. In Theorem 3 we used an extension of Barbalat-
Lyapunov result for linear dynamic systems on infinite-
dimensional Hilbert spaces under the hypothesis of almost
strict dissipativity for infinite dimensional systems, to show
that direct adaptive control can regulate the state and the
output of a linear infinite-dimensional system in the presence
of persistent disturbances without using any kind of state or
parameter
estimation.
In
Theorem4,
we
began
the
development of adaptive control causing a quantum system
to converge to a decoherence -free subspace where quantum
error-correction can operate. The control of a simple
quantum system is described by a general Schrodinger wave
equation with external disturbances using a single actuator
and sensor and direct adaptive output feedback.
These results give a basic framework for direct adaptive
control of quantum systems. They are meant as a beginning
for the use of adaptive control in this context. They show that
adaptive control does not require deep knowledge of specific
properties or parameters of the system to accomplish
decoherence reduction. But there are still many technical
issues to overcome.
