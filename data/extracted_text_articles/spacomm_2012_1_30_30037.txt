Abstract— This paper presents the findings of weather 
statistics at the three sites of the NASA Deep Space Network 
(DSN) and the effect of weather on antenna tracking 
performance at Ka-band frequency, based on operational data.  
Both aspects of weather effects are examined: the distribution 
statistics of wind patterns and the antenna pointing 
performance (and hence received signal level) in the presence 
of high winds.   Due to smaller beamwidth inherent in the large 
aperture of DSN antennas (34-m diameter for Ka-band 
reception), a small offset in antenna pointing caused by winds 
could significantly reduce the received signal power and 
potentially result in a data outage.  Some past models indicated 
a strong wind impact.  Winds, even at a moderately low speed 
of 16 km/hr (10 mph), can distort the antenna’s main reflector 
and cause signal degradation by as much as 2.9 dB at Ka-band 
frequency.  Establishing the actual performance that is based 
on operational data is very important for mission operation 
planning, especially for missions that are power-constrained 
and thus need to conserve the link margin.  Finding an optimal 
link margin setting that is neither wasteful nor insufficient 
would enable maximum data return for missions.  The findings 
presented in this paper show that there are significant 
differences in the weather among the three DSN sites; thus, one 
possible strategy to maximize data return is to allocate more 
tracking at sites with low winds.  Another surprising finding is 
that the wind effect is not as large as previously thought.  Only 
small signal degradation (0.8 dB) was observed for wind speeds 
up to 50 km/hr.

 INTRODUCTION 
The communications between NASA mission operations 
team and their respective spacecraft venturing into deep 
space is supported by the NASA Deep Space Network 
(DSN).   Over time, the S- and X-band spectrum allocated 
for deep space communications has become more and more 
crowded.   By going to a higher operating frequency at Ka-
band (32 GHz), missions would be less exposed to potential 
radio frequency interference (RFI).  At the same time, they 
can realize a better performance with higher antenna gain 
[1].   
One potential drawback however is the higher sensitivity 
to weather.  Winds can affect antenna pointing, pushing it 
away from the maximum gain position.  At Ka-band, the 
antenna beamwidth is about four times smaller than that at 
X-band.  A small antenna pointing error at Ka-band could 
significantly reduce the received signal power and 
potentially result in more data outages.  Some past models 
indicated a strong wind impact on the DSN 34-m antennas.  
They predicted that even at moderately low winds of 16 
km/hr (10 mph), the signal degradation could be as much as 
2.9 dB due to antenna main reflector distortion [2].  This 
posed a great concern to mission operations planning, 
especially for missions that have limited link margin; thus, 
prompted the interest to validate such model with actual 
operational data.  Knowing the true operational performance 
would allow missions to set an appropriate link margin that 
is neither unnecessarily large nor insufficient.  This in turn 
enables maximum data return. 
The following sections describe the way data are 
processed and present the results of analysis.  Section II 
discusses the data used for the analysis.  Section III shows 
the statistics of wind measurements at the three main DSN 
tracking sites.  Section IV presents the wind effect on 
received signal, followed by the effect on antenna pointing 
error in Section V.  The final section provides a summary on 
the findings. 
II. 
DATA PROCESSING 
Data collected and used for this analysis are taken from 
the DSN performance dashboards, as reported in [3].  The 
dashboards capture performance monitor data for every 
spacecraft tracking pass conducted by the DSN antennas.  
Specific monitor data used in this analysis include wind 
speeds, antenna pointing errors, and received signal to noise 
ratio (SNR).  Data collected from the tracking of Kepler 
spacecraft, which employs Ka-band for its downlink 
telemetry, are used to correlate the SNR fluctuation with 
antenna pointing error and wind speed.   Observed wind 
speed data collected over a period of January - June 2011 are 
used to compute the exceedance probability distribution 
function at each of the three DSN sites. 
 
III. 
WEATHER STATISTICS 
Figure 1 presents a plot of the average wind speed 
observed for each tracking pass from January to June, 2011.   
From this data set, the exceedance probability distribution of 
wind speed are derived and presented in Figure 2.  One can 
see distinctively different statistics for Goldstone compared 
to those at Canberra and Madrid.  Goldstone is significantly 
windier than the other two sites.  The median wind speed at 
Goldstone is 15 km/hr, more than twice the median wind

speed of 7 km/hr at Canberra and Madrid.   Five percent of 
the time, the wind speed at Goldstone is greater than 40 
km/hr, but at Canberra and Madrid it exceeds only 15-18 
km/hr for the same percentage of time.  
Given this highly unbalanced distribution, one possible 
strategy in optimizing the mission data return would be to 
schedule most of the tracking passes over Canberra and 
Madrid complexes, if the view periods at all sites are equal.  
However, the weather (clouds and rain) at Canberra and 
Madrid is significantly worse than at Goldstone [4], so that 
somewhat offsets the benefits of having lower wind speeds.

IV. 
WIND EFFECT ON SIGNAL RECEPTION 
In the current mission set that the DSN supports, Kepler 
is the only mission that uses Ka-band (32 GHz) for 
telemetry downlink.  The spacecraft, launched in March 
2009, spends most of its time searching for exoplanets 
(planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy) and only 
downlinks the data to Earth roughly once a month.   Thus, 
Ka-band telemetry tracks are rather limited, making the 
observed passes with high winds much less common.  
Figure 3 presents the measurement of received signal to 
noise ratio (SNR) for both carrier and symbol data, along 
with wind speeds during the track for about three hours on 
day-of-year (DOY) 241/2011.  On this particular day, wind 
speed averaged 18 km/hr, with relatively large gusts of up to 
50 km/hr.   Note also that there were several step-like 
changes in the carrier SNR profile, but that phenomenon 
was not reflected in the symbol SNR.  Unfortunately, the 
cause for such jumps is not well understood.  Because of 
these jumps, the carrier SNR data were not used for 
correlation analysis. 
Over the three hours of tracking, the antenna elevation 
changed from 40 to 70 degrees.  This caused a change in the 
system noise temperature of about 10 kelvins and resulted in 
a nearly 1-dB increase in SNR from the beginning to the end 
of the track.  The antenna gain also changed slightly over 
this elevation range.  Both changes were removed in the 
correlation analysis so that their effects would not mask the 
impact of the wind. 
Figure 4 shows the correlation of received symbol SNR 
relative to the wind speed.    Within the inherent fluctuation 
of 0.8 dB standard deviation in the symbol SNR 
measurements, a linear fit of the data indicates the 
degradation caused by winds at 20 km/hr is about 0.3 dB.  
For winds up to 50 km/hr, the degradation is within 0.8 dB, 
much less than predicted in past models. 
Combining this observation with the exceedance 
distribution function in Figure 2 where the 50 km/hr wind 
speed threshold is at the end of the distribution curves for all 
three sites, it seems that a very high percentage of tracking

passes (~99%) should only experience at most 0.8 dB 
degradation from the winds, from all causes including main 
reflector distortion and pointing errors.

WIND EFFECT ON ANTENNA POINTING ERROR 
To examine the wind effect on antenna pointing, we look 
at the correlation of wind speed and pointing error.  The 
pointing error is derived from the conical scanning offset.  
Conical scanning, often referred to as conscan, is a method 
to keep the antenna on point by continuously circling the 
antenna around the predicted position.  As the antenna 
traces this conscan circle, the received signal power varies 
as a function of the radial distance between the 
instantaneous antenna position and the spacecraft’s true 
position.  This variation in signal power allows for 
determination of pointing offset, and enables correction at 
the next scan cycle.  The conscan offset measurements are 
used to infer the wind’s effect on antenna pointing.      
In the earlier data set on DOY241/2011 as discussed in 
Section IV, conscan was not enabled; thus, we could not 
analyze the correlation of pointing errors on that particular 
windy date.  However, on the DOY 177/2011 pass, winds 
up to 20 km/hr were observed and conscan offset data were 
available for analysis, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5.  SNR, pointing error and wind speed on pass DOY 177/2011. 
Figure 6 shows a correlation of antenna pointing error 
and received SNR versus wind speed.  The linear fit for the 
pointing errors is almost a constant, indicating a weak 
correlation.  The change in pointing error is less than 0.0002 
deg for wind speed ranges from zero to 20 km/hr.  This error 
would have translated to a very small additional pointing loss 
of only 0.05 dB around the operating point for the 
beamwidth of a 34-m antenna at Ka-band. 
Note that the linear fit for the symbol SNR seems to be 
affected by the high noise level of symbol SNR 
measurements, and does not accurately reflect the expected 
behavior. It shows an increase in SNR for greater wind 
speeds and slightly increased pointing errors.  As such, the 
indicated change of 0.6 dB from 0 to 20 km/hr wind does not 
appear to be real.  One conclusion we can draw from the 
SNR data is that there seems to be no degradation observed.

CONCLUSION 
From the analysis of weather data collected at the three 
main DSN sites, it is established that tracking antennas at 
Goldstone are subject to significantly windier conditions 
than those at Canberra and Madrid.  Missions, especially 
those that operate at low link margin, can optimize data 
return by having more tracking scheduled at Canberra and 
Madrid, assuming that the view period is equal at all three 
sites.

Further analysis of the wind effect on symbol SNR and 
pointing error indicates a minimum effect.   Only a small 
increase in pointing error, 0.0002 deg, was observed with 
wind speeds up to 20 km/hr.  Symbol SNR was estimated to 
degrade by no more than 0.8 dB for winds up to 50 km/hr, 
and possibly not at all at wind speeds up to 20 km/hr. These 
estimates, however, are subject to a comparable SNR 
measurement uncertainty of 0.8 dB standard deviation.   
The finding shows a much more robust Ka-band operation 
under windy condition than previously believed.  This is a 
testament to the inherent mechanical stability and excellent 
tracking performance of the large NASA DSN antennas.
