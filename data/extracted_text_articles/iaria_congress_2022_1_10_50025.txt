Abstract—Several routes allowing the development of low cost 
magnetic microwires coated by insulating, flexible and 
biocompatible glass-coating with tunable magnetic properties 
are overviewed. Amorphous microwires can present excellent 
magnetic softness and Giant MagnetoImpedance (GMI) effect. 
A high GMI effect, obtained even in as-prepared Co-rich 
microwires, can be further improved by appropriate heat 
treatment (including Joule heating, conventional annealing 
and/or stress-annealing). The observed versatile magnetic 
properties of amorphous microwires are suitable for various 
applications, such as magnetic sensors, electronic surveillance, 
wireless communication or biomedical applications. 
 Keywords- magnetic microwires; magnetic softness; giant 
magnetoimpedance effect. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Amorphous magnetic materials can present an unusual 
combination of excellent magnetic properties (e.g., high 
magnetic permeability, Giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) 
effect, magnetic bistability, Matteucci and Widemann 
effects) and superior mechanical properties (plasticity, 
flexibility) making them suitable for numerous industrial 
applications [1]-[7]. Furthermore, the preparation method 
involving rapid melt quenching is quite fast and inexpensive 
and the above mentioned magnetic softness can be realized 
without any complex post-processing treatments [3]-[5].  
The development of novel applications of amorphous 
materials requires new functionalities, i.e., reduced 
dimensions, 
enhanced 
corrosion 
resistance 
or 
biocompatibility [8]. Therefore, great attention has been 
paid to development of alternative fabrication methods 
allowing preparation of amorphous materials at micro-nano 
scale involving melt quenching [6]-[8].  
The main technological interest in GMI effect is related 
to one of the largest sensitivity to magnetic field (up to 10 
%/A/m) among non-cryogenic effects [4]-[8]. Such features 
of the GMI effect make it quite attractive for development 
of high performance sensors allowing detection of low 
magnetic fields and mechanical stresses [9]-[14]. The most 
common quantity for the characterization of the GMI effect 
is the GMI ratio, ∆Z/Z, defined as: 
             ∆Z/Z = [Z (H) - Z (Hmax)] / Z (Hmax),     
(1)  
where H is the applied axial DC-field with a maximum 
value, Hmax, up to a few kA/m.  
 
The value of GMI ratio and its magnetic field 
dependence are determined by the type of magnetic 
anisotropy: to achieve a high GMI ratio, a high 
circumferential magnetic permeability is essential [7][8]. 
Magnetic wires with circumferential easy axis exhibit 
double-peak magnetic field dependence of the real 
component of wire impedance (and consequently of the 
GMI ratio). However, magnetic wires with longitudinal easy 
axis present monotonic decay of the GMI ratio with 
increasing axial magnetic field with GMI ratio maximum at 
zero magnetic fields [7][8]. The highest GMI ratio up to 
650% is reported for amorphous microwires [15]-[17]. 
However, the theoretically predicted maximum GMI ratio is 
about 3000% (i.e., a few times larger than the GMI ratio 
values 
reported 
experimentally) 
[18]. 
Additionally, 
theoretical minimum of the skin depth is about 0.3 μm 
[17][18].   
The main features of the GMI effect have been 
successfully explained in terms of classical electrodynamics 
considering the influence of a magnetic field on the 
penetration depth of an electrical current flowing through 
the magnetically soft conductor [1][2]. High circumferential 
permeability typically observed in Co-rich amorphous wires 
with nearly-zero magnetostriction coefficient is essentially 
relevant for observation of high GMI ratio [1][2][4]-[6]. 
However, similarly to the magnetic permeability, the GMI 
effect has a tensor character [4]-[6][19]-[22]. The off-
diagonal component of GMI can present anti-symmetrical 
magnetic field dependence with a linear region quite 
suitable for magnetic sensors applications [19][23].  
One of the tendencies in modern GMI sensors is the size 
reduction. It must be underlined that the diameter reduction 
must be associated with the increasing of the optimal GMI 
frequency range: a tradeoff between dimension and 
frequency is required in order to obtain a maximum GMI

effect [4]-[6][23]. Additionally, the GMI effect at 
microwave frequencies has been described considering the 
analogy between the GMI and the ferromagnetic resonance 
[4]. Consequently, the development of thin soft magnetic 
materials required for miniaturization of the sensors and 
devices requires an extension of the frequency range for the 
impedance toward the higher frequencies (GHz range).  
Recently developed magnetic sensors using the GMI 
effect allow achieving nT and pT magnetic field sensitivity 
with low noise [10]-[14][24].  
 
Presently, major attention is focused on high 
frequencies (GHz range) GMI applications owing to the 
development of thin magnetically soft materials and the  
recent tendency in miniaturization of magnetic field sensors 
[4]-[6][10]-[14][24]. 
The aim of this report is to provide recent results on the 
optimization of soft magnetic properties and the GMI effect 
in magnetic microwires. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.  In Section 
2, we present the description of the experimental techniques, 
while in Section 3, we describe the results on the effect of 
post-processing on the GMI ratio of the studied microwires. 
We conclude this work in Section 4. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
As already mentioned in the introduction, the GMI effect 
usually 
observed 
in 
soft 
magnetic 
materials 
phenomenologically consists of the change of the AC 
impedance, Z = R + iX (where R is the real part, or 
resistance, and X is the imaginary part, or reactance), when 
submitted to an external magnetic field, H0.  
The electrical impedance, Z, of a magnetic conductor is 
given by [1][2]:

with k = (1 + j)/δ, where J0 and J1 are the Bessel functions, 
r  is the wire’s radius and δ the penetration depth given by: 
                               
πσµφ f
δ =
   
               (3) 
where σ is the electrical conductivity, f the frequency of the 
current along the sample, and µφ the circular magnetic 
permeability assumed to be scalar. The DC applied 
magnetic field introduces significant changes in the circular 
permeability, µφ. Therefore, the penetration depth also 
changes through and finally results in a change of Z [1],[2].  
 
The GMI ratio, defined as ∆Z/Z, has been evaluated 
considering (1). 
The use of a specially designed micro-strip sample 
holder  placed inside a sufficiently long solenoid allows 
measuring of the magnetic field dependence of sample 
impedance, Z, using a vector network analyzer , as 
described in [24]. The described technique allows 
measuring of the GMI effect in extended frequency, f, range 
up to GHz frequencies. 
Hysteresis loops have been measured using the 
fluxmetric method previously described in [25]. We 
represent the normalized magnetization, M/M0 versus the 
magnetic field, H, where M is the magnetic moment at a 
given magnetic field and M0 is the magnetic moment of the 
sample at the maximum magnetic field amplitude, Hm.   
We studied Fe- and Co- rich microwires with metallic 
nucleus diameters, d, ranging from 10 up to 25 µm prepared 
using the Taylor-Ulitovsky method described in [5][8]. The 
Taylor-Ulitovsky method allows the preparation of the 
thinnest metallic wires (with typical diameters of the order 
of 1 to 30 μm) covered by an insulating glass coating [5][8].  
The great advantage of these microwires is that the 
obtained diameter could be significantly reduced in 
comparison with the case of amorphous wires produced by 
the other rapidly quenching methods. However, in the case 
of glass-coated microwires the magnetoelastic anisotropy 
contribution is even more relevant since the preparation 
process involves not only the rapid quenching itself, but also 
simultaneous 
solidification 
of 
the 
metallic 
nucleus 
surrounded by the glass-coating with rather different 
thermal expansion coefficients [5][8][27][28].  
In 
amorphous 
materials, 
the 
magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy is absent. Therefore, the 
magnetoelastic 
anisotropy is the main factor affecting the magnetic 
properties [5][6].  
The magnetoelastic anisotropy, Kme, is given as:  
                                       Kme =3/2λSσi               
     (4) 
where λS is the magnetostriction coefficient and σi is the 
internal stresses value [8]. 
The magnetostriction coefficient, λs, value in amorphous 
alloys can be tailored by the chemical composition [29]-
[31]. Generally, Fe-rich compositions present positive λs -
values (typically λs ≈ 20 - 40 x 10−6), while for the Co-rich 
alloys, λs values are negative, typically λs ≈ -5 to - 3 x 10−6. 
Vanishing λs values can be achieved in the CoxFe1-x (0≤x 
≤1) or CoxMn1-x (0≤x ≤1) systems at x about 0.03 – 0.08 
[29]-[32].   
However, internal stresses, σi, arise during simultaneous 
rapid quenching of metallic nucleus surrounding by the 
glass coating due to the different thermal expansion 
coefficients. Consequently, the strength of internal stresses 
can be controlled by the glass-coating thickness: the 
strength of internal stresses increases with the increase of 
the glass-coating thickness [27][28].  
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
As mentioned above, the magnitude and the magnetic 
field dependence of the GMI effect (including off-diagonal 
components) is intrinsically linked to the magnetic 
anisotropy [4]-[8]. Consequently, both hysteresis loops, 
∆Z/Z(H) dependence and maximum value of the GMI ratio, 
∆Z/Zm, are affected by λs sign and value  and by the 
magnitude of internal stresses, σi . The magnetostriction

coefficient drastically affects the character of the hysteresis 
loops of magnetic microwires: i) Co-rich microwires (see 
Figure 1a for Co77.5Si15B7.5) with negative magnetostriction 
constant (λs≈-5x10-6) have almost unhysteretic loops with 
extremely low coercivity, Hc. However, the magnetic 
permeability of Co77.5Si15B7.5 microwires is not high enough 
since they also present high enough magnetic anisotropy 
field, Hk. ii) Co-Fe-based microwires with vanishing 
magnetostriction constant (Co67.1Fe3.8Ni1.4Si14.5B11.5Mo1.7, 
λs≈-10-7) generally present lower Hk values and hence higher 
magnetic permeability (see Figure 1b). iii) Finally, Fe-rich 
microwires (Fe75B9Si12C4) with positive magnetostriction 
constant (λs≈40x10-6) present rectangular hysteresis loops 
and consequently low magnetic permeability (see Figure 
1c).  
As 
can 
be 
appreciated 
from 
Figure 
2b, 
Co67.1Fe3.8Ni1.4Si14.5B11.5Mo1.7 
microwire 
presents 
the 
highest maximum GMI ratio, ∆Z/Zm (about 240% at 500 
MHz). Quite low ∆Z/Zm values are observed for 
Fe75B9Si12C4 microwire (∆Z/Zm ≈15%, see Figure 2c). 
Moderate ∆Z/Zm values (∆Z/Zm ≈120%) are observed for 
Co77.5Si15B7.5 microwire (see Figure 2a). 
The other difference in ∆Z/Z(H) dependencies for 
microwires with different magnetostriction coefficients is 
the character of ∆Z/Z(H) dependencies: for microwires with 
λs>0, a single maximum ∆Z/Z(H) dependence with ∆Z/Z 
maximum at H=0 is observed (Figure 2c). However, for 
λs<0 double- maximum ∆Z/Z(H) dependencies with ∆Z/Z 
maximum at H=Hm are observed (Figures 2b,c). 
It is commonly assumed that the Hm value corresponding 
to the peaks (maximum ΔZ/Z  value) is linked to the average 
value of the anisotropy field, HK, at high frequency values, 
and to the effective anisotropy distribution in the sample. In 
this regard, the observed ∆Z/Z(H) dependencies correlate 
with the hysteresis loops: the highest Hm value is observed 
for Co77.5Si15B7.5 microwire with the highest Hk value (see 
Figure 1a). A single maximum ∆Z/Z(H) dependence with 
∆Z/Z maximum at H=0 corresponds to the Fe75B9Si12C4 
microwire with axial magnetic anisotropy (Figure 1c).  
Such different magnetic anisotropy of microwires with 
positive and negative magnetostriction is related to the 
internal stresses distribution intrinsically related to the 
fabrication of microwires [4]-[8]. The radial distribution of 
internal stresses calculated considering quenching stresses 
related to rapid quenching of the metallic alloy from the 
melt as well as complex tensor stresses related to the 
difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of metal 
and glass the axial stresses are the largest ones up to  ~ 0.85 
R ( where R is the metallic nucleus radius) [8]. Thus, the 
main volume of the microwire nucleus is under the tensile 
stresses near the axis of the metallic nucleus. However, 
closer to the surface, the compressive stresses are dominant. 
Additionally, the strength of internal stresses is determined 
by the thickness of the non-magnetic glass-coating: the 
strength of internal stresses increases with the increasing of 
the glass-coating thickness. 
Therefore, as reported earlier [5][8], hysteresis loops and 
GMI effect are affected by the ratio ρ=d/D, where d is the

diameter of metallic nucleus and D-total microwire 
diameter. Some examples are shown in Figure 3, where the 
hysteresis loops and  ∆Z/Z(H) dependencies of as-prepared 
Co67Fe3.85Ni1.45B11.5Si14.5Mo1.7 microwires with different ρ 
ratios are shown. 
Consequently, the control of internal stresses by 
tailoring of the ρ–ratio is an effective method for GMI ratio 
tuning. 
As mentioned above, the other important parameter for 
GMI ratio optimization in magnetic microwires is the 
frequency. Indeed, the frequency must be high enough in 
order to have the skin depth lower than the sample radius 
(strong skin effect).  ΔZ/Z(H) dependencies measured at 
different 
frequencies 
in 
as-prepared 
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.4B11.5Si14.5Mo1.6 (d=25.6 µm, D= 26.6 µm) 
microwires are shown in Figure 4a. This composition at the 
given geometry (d=25.6 µm, D= 26.6 µm, ρ=0.96) present 
high maximum GMI ratio, ∆Z/Zm: at optimal frequency of 
about 300 MHz ∆Z/Zm ≈550% can be achieved (see Figure 
4b). However, thinner (d=10.8 μm) microwire of the same 
chemical composition at this frequency exhibit ∆Z/Zm 
≈400% (see Figure 4b). From the ΔZ/Zm(f) dependence for 
Co67.7Fe4.3Ni1.6Si11.2B12.4C1.5Mo1.3 
microwires 
with 
d=10.8μm and d=25.6 µm, we can appreciate that for 
Co67.7Fe4.3Ni1.6Si11.2B12.4C1.5Mo1.3 
microwires 
with 
d=10.8μm the optimal frequency is about 700 MHz at which 
∆Z/Zm ≈550% can be achieved. 
The aforementioned examples provide the routes for 
optimization of GMI effect in Co-rich microwires.  
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We measured the GMI magnetic field, frequency 
dependencies and hysteresis loops in magnetic microwires 
produced by the Taylor-Ulitovsky technique. 
We observed that the GMI effect and magnetic softness 
of microwires are intrinsically related and can be tailored 
either by controlling the magnetoelastic anisotropy of as-
prepared microwires or by controlling their internal stresses 
and structure by heat treatment. Studies of the GMI effect of 
amorphous Co-Fe rich microwires reveal that microwires of 
appropriate chemical composition and geometry present the 
GMI effect at GHz frequencies. A high GMI effect has been 
achieved and discussed. The election of appropriate 
measuring conditions can be beneficial for the optimization 
of the GMI effect of magnetic microwires. Magnetic 
microwires with optimized magnetic properties are suitable 
for several applications, like magnetic sensors, electronic 
surveillance, 
wireless 
communication 
or 
biomedical 
applications.
