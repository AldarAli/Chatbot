Abstract—Over the past few years, people became accustomed 
to using a variety of digital tools in their work environment, 
e.g., for collaboration, knowledge management and task 
management. Recently, people have become aware of a new 
type of digital tool: Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as 
ChatGPT, which are based on large-scale language models. 
These tools are expected to have a huge impact on the way we 
work. New application scenarios are constantly being explored 
and AI chatbots are being used in fields such as marketing, 
medicine, and education. This paper discusses another use case 
in the field of project management. It analyzes how AI 
chatbots could support project management tasks performed 
by project managers and project management assistants. It 
also discusses the new skills that these persons must acquire in 
order to interact with the tool in an efficient way and to use the 
results provided responsibly. A case study shows how selected 
project management tasks, i.e., stakeholder management, can 
benefit from the assistance of an AI chatbot. Special attention 
is given to the aspects of trust and control in such settings.

 INTRODUCTION 
Project managers and project management assistants are 
familiar with using various digital tools in their daily work, 
ranging from project planning, and monitoring to stakeholder 
and risk management [1]. Some of these tools are highly 
specialized, such as project management software, while 
others are not limited to project management, such as video 
conferencing software, instant messaging applications, 
cloud-based document sharing, or digital whiteboards. These 
digital tools have fundamentally changed the way people 
work. Recently, a new type of tool has emerged that has the 
potential to have a profound impact on modern work culture, 
including project management: Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
chatbots [2]. They simulate human-like conversations and 
provide meaningful responses to user queries [3]. This is 
possible because they are based on Large Language Models 
(LLMs) that have been trained on vast amounts of text data 
from the Internet. Due to recent advances in AI, these AI 
chatbots are becoming increasingly powerful. Since their 
release to the public, people have explored their capabilities 
in a variety of application areas and shown how they can 
improve their productivity [3]. 
As the use of digital tools is already widespread in 
project management, it can be assumed that a new digital 
tool such as an AI chatbot will easily and quickly be adapted 
by many project managers. Sometimes, they are already 
considered as digital assistants [2]. AI chatbots can assist 
project managers in their daily tasks. Ideas can be found in 
blog posts, and first “cheat sheets” showcase examples of 
queries [4]. However, there are many differences in the way 
of interacting and interpreting the results obtained by an AI 
chatbot in comparison with classical tools in project 
management. The project manager and the project team 
should be aware of them and possess certain skills to use 
them in a productive way. Moreover, despite all the new and 
exciting possibilities that AI chatbots offer, there are risks 
involved that need to be mitigated, such as ethical challenges 
like discrimination, information hazards, misinformation 
harms and human-computer interaction harms [5][6].  
To this end, the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
provides the required theoretical foundation on LLMs and 
the new skill “prompt engineering”. Section III discusses 
how persons responsible for project management tasks can 
benefit from AI chatbots in their daily work. Therefore, it 
structures AI-assisted project management tasks in six 
categories and analyzes the required skills. As a concrete 
case study, Section IV demonstrates how an AI chatbot can 
support the activities around stakeholder management. 
Useful prompts will be introduced. Based on the experiences 
with the case study, Section V discusses potential and risks 
of the use of AI chatbots in project management. Section VI 
concludes the paper.

LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AND AI CHATBOTS 
A. AI Chatbots 
Since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public in 
November 2022, AI chatbots gained much attention. Via 
their user-friendly interface users can benefit from the 
capabilities of LLMs. These systems use advanced Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand users’ 
questions, generate coherent answers and thereby simulate a 
conversation between human beings [3]. Their development 
has been made possible by the recent advances in AI, 
especially deep learning and transformer architectures, the 
rapid growth in computational power and the large amount 
1

DIGITAL 2023 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation - 2023

of data available on the Internet that could be used as 
training data [7]. LLMs have learnt based on this extensive 
training set to generate text sequences that most likely 
continue a given text [8]. Nowadays, the quality of the text 
produced by these systems is so high that it is difficult to 
distinguish whether a text was written by an AI or by a 
human [9].  
It is important to know the differences between LLMs 
and search engines. They are distinct technologies, as they 
are characterized by different capabilities. LLMs generate 
context-sensitive text based on a given input, formulated in 
natural language [3]. In contrast, search engines take a 
keyword-based query as input and retrieve information from 
indexed web pages or databases. They do not generate new 
content but provide access to existing information. This is 
not the case with LLMs which might “hallucinate” facts and 
references [3]. Moreover, current LLMs cannot provide 
information on recent events without being integrated into 
other tools that have access to up-to-date information (such 
as search engines) [3]. Users must be aware of these 
limitations.  
B. Prompt Engineering 
The instructions given to a LLM are called prompts. In 
the prompt, the user provides the LLM with the context of 
the conversation and defines how the intended output should 
look like in terms of content and format [10]. For instance, a 
user might specify the desired output as an essay with 
approximately 1500 words. The process of constructing 
these prompts is referred to as prompt engineering, i.e., “the 
art of fine-tuning the questions or commands provided to AI 
models in order to optimize their performance and guarantee 
that they produce the desired results” [11]. In consequence, 
to collaborate efficiently with LLMs, users need to have a 
good knowledge of prompt engineering [3].  
III. 
AI CHATBOTS IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
A. Patterns of AI-Assisted Project Management Tasks  
AI chatbots can be applied to the discipline of project 
management in a variety of ways. In the following, AI-
assisted project management tasks are organized into six 
patterns. Tasks as assisting in coding or creating images are 
not included because they are typically performed by team 
members, not the project manager. Given the rapid advances 
in LLMs, the following overview is not meant to be 
exhaustive. Rather, it aims to provide a structured 
framework for practical tasks.  
1) Generate Ideas and Insights: An AI chatbot can 
support idea generation and brainstorming by suggesting 
topics or themes based on user input or some predefined 
categories. Combined with search engines, they can retrieve 
information from a variety of sources, such as articles, 
research papers, or databases. However, users need to check 
the output generated by the AI chatbot for their correctness 
[3], as a high likelihood of the generated content is no 
guarantee that it is correct [5]. A project manager could, for 
example, ask an AI chatbot to generate a list of risks or 
ideas for risk mitigation strategies.   
2) “How to Do”- Assistance: Users can ask an AI 
chatbot for guidance on a certain task, for instance, how to 
write a project proposal or how to plan and estimate the 
project. The AI chatbot typically provides a list of steps for 
the user to follow, often like a recipe, e.g., certain aspects 
that need to be clarified for the project proposal. It should be 
noted that, if the prompt is too general, the result will also 
be unclear or inaccurate [12].   
3) Text Summarization: AI chatbots are able to 
summarize or extract key aspects of large texts. This ability 
could save time for a project manager who needs to compile 
and summarize project data for a status update. Instead of 
reviewing numerous documents and reports, they could 
focus on interpreting the results. However, this task requires 
a significant level of trust in the AI chatbot.  
4) Content Creation: AI chatbots can assist in 
generating content for various purposes, such as articles, 
blog posts, social media updates, or product descriptions 
[3]. Based on a given topic, they can, for example, offer 
relevant keywords, suggest headlines, or write complete 
articles. In project management, different types of content 
are relevant, such as official documentation like project 
proposals, one-pagers, reports, internal working documents, 
as well as any communication with stakeholders. In addition 
to content creation, AI chatbots can improve written text. 
On the one hand, a chatbot can correct a text in terms of 
spelling, punctuation, and grammar. This is especially 
helpful for non-native speakers. On the other hand, it can 
rewrite a text and change its writing style based on the 
desired tone and target audience. For instance, it could turn 
a formal and technical text into a conversational and 
engaging one. This could be useful when preparing two 
communications about a milestone achieved in the project, 
one for the project steering committee, and the other for 
future users.  
5) Pretend to be Someone Else: An AI chatbot can help 
users explore different perspectives by simulating to be 
someone else. By pretending to be a particular persona 
(“role prompting”) with certain opinions, experiences, or 
expertise, the chatbot can provide responses from that 
particular perspective. This allows users to gain insights that 
they might not have considered otherwise. In project 
management, 
this 
could 
be 
useful 
in 
stakeholder 
management. A variation would be a flipped interaction, 
where the AI chatbot asks questions and the user has to 
answer. This could be used to train difficult situations. 
6) Sentiment Analysis: AI chatbots can identify 
sentiments or emotional tones expressed in a given text [13]. 
They can assist users in gaining insights into the overall 
sentiment or mood of the content. This capability could be 
used in stakeholder management, for instance, to analyze 
2

comments posted by stakeholders on social media or other 
online communications. 
B. Required Skills 
To interact successfully and effectively with AI chatbots, 
humans need certain skills. With the previously described 
tasks in mind, these skills are explored below. 
1) Ability to Write Concise Prompts 
When writing prompts, users should ask specific 
questions and be concise in their wording, as this helps 
chatbots to better understand user queries. In addition to the 
use of simple language, the questions, as well as the 
provided content should be clearly structured [11][12]. 
Various guidelines on prompt engineering can be found 
online. It should be noted, however, that these were 
compiled for a certain tool in a certain version, e.g., GPT-4. 
Because of rapid development, prompts that worked very 
well when these guidelines were written may not give good 
results today. Or prompts could be written in a much 
simpler way. This is also the case for all prompts discussed 
in the following. However, some prompting techniques that 
will be applied within the case study are presented.  
First, users should think about whether they want to 
integrate several tasks into a single prompt or to split them 
into multiple prompts. For instance, an AI chatbot could be 
asked in a single prompt to generate four ideas about a 
certain topic and to discuss them in a short blog post. 
Alternatively, a first prompt could ask for four ideas, and a 
second one to write a blog post based on idea 1, idea 2, and 
so on. The advantage of using multiple prompts is that the 
output can be reviewed, and if necessary, adjusted or 
extended. A second important technique is to incorporate 
background knowledge into the prompt. These knowledge- 
augmented queries specify additional context that the LLM 
uses to generate more informed and accurate responses [12]. 
2) Understand 
AI 
Chatbots’ 
Capabilities 
and 
Limitations 
It is important that users are aware of the actual 
capabilities of AI chatbots, i.e., to know what tasks they can 
perform, what knowledge they use to answer queries, and 
how they differ from search engines. This will help users to 
frame their questions and expectations accordingly. 
Awareness of limitations and potential difficulties, such as 
bias in the underlying data, is also extremely important, as it 
is a prerequisite for users to write appropriate prompts and 
interpret the results provided by AI chatbots in a responsible 
manner. For instance, users should be careful to write 
prompts that are free of pre-existing biases or assumptions 
about gender, race, or other sensitive factors to avoid 
reinforcing bias [12]. Users should think critically, verify 
the results with their own expertise and conduct further 
research in trusted sources [12]. 
3) Adopt an Iterative Approach 
Users should be prepared to take an iterative approach 
when interacting with an AI chatbot [3]. It may be necessary 
to phrase the prompt in a different style or add information. 
Being flexible and adapting to the AI chatbot’s conversation 
flow will ensure a smoother conversation. Sometimes users 
need to be patient and try different approaches. While this 
can be considered a form of learning, users need to be aware 
of the chatbot’s limitations and should consider whether not 
using the chatbot might be more efficient in specific 
situations. 
4) Awareness of Privacy and Security Issues 
When interacting with AI chatbots, users should critically 
evaluate what information they are willing to share. They 
need to be aware of whether the question or contextual 
information provided in a prompt reveals sensitive data. 
This applies to both personal and business-related data. For 
example, users should be careful about writing project-
specific details, financial information, or proprietary data. 
They should always formulate such information in a 
generalized and anonymized manner, and consider the need 
to disclose sensitive information. 
5) Being Aware That You are Talking to an AI 
Users need to be aware that they are communicating with 
an AI, not a human. Because of the conversational interface, 
users tend to think of a chatbot as a human, or at least 
attribute some human-like characteristics to it. This can be 
observed in users' prompts where they use phrases like 
“please”, “thank you”, even though they know that they are 
talking to a bot. Anthropomorphizing the AI chatbot poses 
several dangers, such as shifting accountability to the 
chatbot or overestimating its capabilities [5]. Project 
managers using AI chatbots should be aware that AI 
chatbots may not be able to handle complex or nuanced 
situations that require human judgment and decision-
making. They operate based on data and patterns, which 
may not always account for a specific situation or in 
unforeseen circumstances. Users should think critically and 
consider the limitations of chatbots when relying on their 
advice or recommendations. Project managers should also 
understand that not only can they be misled by an AI 
chatbot’s response, but so can their team members.  
IV. 
CASE STUDY ON INCORPORATING AI CHATBOTS IN 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
The following case study demonstrates how AI chatbots 
can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of project 
management. It considers a digitalization project at a 
European manufacturing company which aims to introduce a 
new software for recording the working time. This system 
should simplify and automate current processes. The project 
encompasses the vendor selection, the customization of the 
selected solution, the process redesign, and the training of 
the future users. Note that scope and objectives of the project 
considered in the project management case study are already 
defined as it would be the case in any project in an enterprise 
context. A conversational AI could have been used in this 
preliminary step, too. For instance, it could support the 
project initiators to better formulate the objectives or assist 
other tasks in project definition.

DIGITAL 2023 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation - 2023

Within the case study, concrete activities in project 
management should be performed with the help of an AI 
chatbot, namely one of the project performance domains 
described in the PMBOK Guide published by the Project 
Management Institute (PMI) [14]. A project performance 
domain is defined as “a group of related activities that are 
crucial for the effective delivery of project outcomes” [14]. 
The PMBOK Guide outlines eight performance domains that 
should be considered during the implementation of a project. 
These domains play a crucial role in driving the project 
towards its intended outcome. In the case study, the focus 
will be on the stakeholder performance domain. 
This performance domain emphasizes that it is important 
to maintain alignment with the stakeholders of a project and 
to engage with them a positive relationship [14]. 
Stakeholders are persons or groups of people who affect the 
project and its outcomes, or who are affected by the project 
and its outcomes. They all bring their own ideas, values, 
qualifications, and prior experience [15]. The PMBOK 
Guide identifies several activities in the context of the 
stakeholder management as shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
Figure 1.  Activities to ensure stakeholder engagement based on [14]. 
A first try could be to write a single prompt that asks the 
AI chatbot to perform the stakeholder management, such as 
“Do the stakeholder management for a digitalization project 
in a German manufacturing company that aims to introduce a 
new digital system for recording the working time.”. The 
result is, according to ChatGPT, a “comprehensive 
stakeholder management plan for your project”. It contains 
eight steps that can be mapped to the activities named in the 
PMBOK Guide. For each step, a type of deliverable is 
presented, such as a list of stakeholders, or a communication 
plan. However, a closer look at the results reveals that they 
are rather general. For instance, one recommendation for 
managing stakeholders’ expectations is to highlight the 
benefits of the new system, such as accurate time tracking, 
improved efficiency, and reduced paperwork. This is true, 
but too superficial to be useful in day-to-day work. This 
example highlights the need for more sophisticated prompts. 
For instance, each of the eight different steps could be 
refined with the help of individual prompts, each focusing on 
specific aspects of stakeholder management. Such prompts 
are shown below for each stakeholder management activity.      
A. Identify Stakeholders 
First, it is necessary to identify all potential internal and 
external 
stakeholders 
of 
a 
project. 
While 
certain 
stakeholders can readily be identified, there might also be 
stakeholders that are only indirectly affected by the project 
[14]. They are more difficult to identify. In practice, the 
activity of identifying stakeholder is often performed by the 
project manager and some team members in a brainstorming 
session. An AI chatbot can support this task. To enable the 
AI chatbot to generate a list of stakeholders that is specific 
to the project at hand, some context about the project must 
be provided. It is recommended to describe the project in a 
short but precise way. By doing this, it has to be taken care 
that no confidential information is passed to the AI-based 
system. Table I shows such a prompt. 
TABLE I.  
EXAMPLE PROPMPT TO IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS 
Intent 
Identify the stakeholders of a project 
Type of prompt 
Brainstorming 
Required input 
Context information about the project 
Prompt 
Consider the following project and identify the 
different stakeholders involved in this project: The 
digitalization project in a German manufacturing 
company aims to introduce a new digital system for 
recording the working time. This new system 
should simplify and automate the process of 
recording working time. This project encompasses 
the vendor selection, the customization of the 
selected solution but also the process redesign and 
the training of the future users. 
Result 
List of stakeholders including a brief description of 
how they are connected with the project 
 
Before further using the results within the project, it is 
necessary to carefully check the plausibility in the specific 
context of the project. As the AI chatbot generates the 
answer based on the information seen during the training of 
the LLM, relationships could be created that are not relevant 
in the current project. However, it may also be the case that 
the AI chatbot identifies stakeholders that one has not 
thought about oneself. So, one should carefully think about 
them before excluding them from the list of stakeholders. In 
addition, the list of stakeholders might be incomplete and 
might need to be extended “manually”. 
B. Understand and Analyze Stakeholders  
To be able to effectively engage and communicate with 
stakeholders, it is important to understand their “feelings, 
emotions, beliefs and values” [14]. An AI chatbot can help 
to analyze the stakeholders’ perspectives. In a first step, it 
could be asked in a rather general way to gain additional 
information about the stakeholders, their connection to the 
new system and to the project. Such a prompt could be 
“Provide more information about the stakeholder ‘work 
council’.”. Note that AI chatbots remember the information 
given within one conversation. So, the prompts can build 
upon each other.

DIGITAL 2023 : Advances on Societal Digital Transformation - 2023

Including good practices from project management in the 
prompt can improve the output. The PMBOK Guide, for 
instance, recommends considering different aspects in 
stakeholder analysis, especially their power, impact, attitude, 
beliefs, expectations, degree of influence, proximity to the 
project and their interest in the project [14]. These aspects 
can be added as desired output to the prompt as Table II 
shows. The project team should review the results as it might 
be necessary to refine them based on project specific 
information. 
TABLE II.  
EXAMPLE PROPMPT TO ANALYZE STAKEHOLDERS 
Intent

Type of prompt 
Generate insights 
Required input 
The stakeholder to be analyzed. If available, context 
information about the stakeholder or past 
experiences with this stakeholder should be added. 
Prompt 
Discuss for the stakeholder "work council" its 
power, impact, attitude, beliefs, expectations, degree 
of influence, proximity to the project and its interest 
in the project. 
Result 
Information about each of the key aspects required 
in the prompt. Note that without providing the key 
aspects in the prompt, the result would be more 
general.  
 
To deepen the understanding of the stakeholders’ 
perspectives, the AI chatbot can be asked to describe typical 
personas, i.e., fictional representations who have a name, a 
profession and who can describe the impacts that the new 
system would have on them. For instance, several personas 
could be created that represent the stakeholder “employees”. 
Then, the chatbot could be asked in a follow-up prompt what 
a certain persona would say about the project.  
In our case study, it was necessary to ask explicitly for 
critical perspectives. The answers to our first prompts rather 
sounded coming from a marketing brochures of time 
tracking systems and every persona was said to be happy 
with the system. Table III shows a prompt that provides us 
with a more critical perspective.  
TABLE III.  
EXAMPLE PROPMPT WITH PERSONAS 
Intent

Required input 
Additional information about the personas, such as 
their current way of working and potential concerns 
Prompt 
What would persona <A> say about the time 
tracking system when she was formerly used to start 
and stop working whenever she wished, only being 
judged by her results, not her time spent on them? 
Result 
Differentiated opinion from the persona’s 
perspective 
 
C. Prioritize Stakeholders  
Due to limited resources, projects normally need to focus 
on the most important stakeholders [14]. Therefore, it is 
usual to evaluate all stakeholders with respect to their 
attitude to the project, i.e., whether it is positive or negative, 
and whether they have a high or low influence on the 
project’s progression [14][15]. A so-called stakeholder 
matrix or stakeholder map can serve as a tool to provide a 
visual overview of all stakeholders with their interests and 
their influence [16]. It can be used as a basis when planning 
measures 
for 
engaging 
and 
communicating 
with 
stakeholders. Note that in the prompt showing in Table IV, 
the AI chatbot is already familiar with the concept of a 
stakeholder matrix.  
TABLE IV.  
EXAMPLE PROPMPT TO PRIORITZE STAKEHOLDERS 
Intent 
Create a stakeholder matrix 
Type of prompt 
Create project documentation 
Required input 
List of stakeholders and their concerns 
Prompt 
Classify the stakeholders identified for this 
digitalization project in the different quadrants of a 
stakeholder matrix. 
Result 
List of stakeholders per quadrant (High Power, 
High Interest; High Power, Low Interest; Low 
Power, High Interest; Low Power, Low Interest) 
 
The result generated by the AI chatbot is a list of 
stakeholders which could be used as the basis for creating a 
visual representation in the form of a stakeholder matrix. 
Current text-based AI chatbots are not yet able to generate 
such visualizations. They can only walk you through the 
process.  
It is important to address any concerns that stakeholders 
with high power and high interest have. A prompt to 
generate ideas on how to address potential concerns might 
be “What incentives could be used to raise acceptance?”.  
The list of stakeholders and the stakeholder matrix are 
important artefacts created within project management. 
They should be reviewed throughout the course of the 
project, and, if necessary, be updated because on the one 
hand, stakeholders might change their opinions and, on the 
other hand, influencing factors might change [14]. In 
addition, misevaluations can be corrected. 
D. Engage Stakeholders 
Successful stakeholder engagement requires different 
communication approaches [14]. Depending on the audience 
and the type of information, a verbal or written 
communication 
should 
be 
preferred. 
Moreover, 
the 
communication might be formal or informal. An example for 
a formal written communication is a progress report, while a 
social media post or an instant message is an example for a 
written informal communication. An AI chatbot can support 
project managers in preparing an appropriate communication 
artefact. This might include several steps in which the 
content of the communication is elaborated, the type of 
communication is determined, and the actual text is written. 
By doing this, users need to take care that the 
communication does not remain superficial and that it does 
not appear to be artificially generated. The time saved by 
utilizing an AI chatbot can be used to create customized 
communications for each stakeholder, which can also be 
supported by the AI chatbot. Table V shows such a series of 
prompts.

A further application scenario in stakeholder engagement 
is the training and simulation of difficult situations. For 
example, an AI chatbot can help the project manager to 
prepare a project presentation with stakeholders that express 
many concerns about the project. Table VI demonstrates 
such a prompt.

work council. I want you to do a dialogue with me. 
Start with asking a question about your first concern 
and wait for my answers. 
Result 
Flipped interaction with questions asked by the AI 
chatbot and answers given by the user 
 
E. Monitor Stakeholders  
During a project, stakeholders might change their 
opinions, new stakeholders might become relevant while the 
importance of others may decline. Therefore, it is important 
to monitor the stakeholders and their satisfaction with the 
project [14]. AI chatbots can support by analyzing the 
sentiments that stakeholders express in their communication. 
E-mails or any other communication in internal groups or 
communication platforms about the project could be 
analyzed by an AI chatbot with the help of a prompt such as 
“Given this text, what is the sentiment conveyed? Is it 
positive or negative?”. However, it has to be noted that no 
confidential information is handed to a public AI chatbot.  
V. 
POTENTIALS AND RISKS OF USING AI CHATBOTS IN 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
The pattern of AI-assisted project management activities, 
as well as the examples within the case study have 
demonstrated that AI chatbots can indeed be a useful digital 
tool in project management. However, there are several 
issues that lead us to conclude that they are “just” a tool and 
not yet a digital assistant that is a full member of the project 
team. First, project managers need to trust that the chatbot 
has a solid knowledge of project management methods and 
good practices, for instance, when asking for guidance. To 
build up this trust, it would be helpful if the chatbot added a 
reference to established project management standards, such 
as published by PMI, ISO or PRINCE2 to the answer. As 
long as this is not the case, it is recommended to provide this 
guidance to the chatbot in the prompt, such as shown in the 
prompt in Table II, which explicitly mentions the different 
aspects to be considered in the stakeholder analysis.  
Second, the project manager must be able to review any 
generated content. For instance, if the AI chatbot extracts a 
project status from various documents, traceability is 
required. In other words, it must be clear what information 
was used to set the status. To a certain extent, this can be 
achieved by explicitly asking the AI chatbot to provide its 
reasoning in addition to the answer. This can be achieved, for 
instance, by adding a specific response format that guides the 
AI chatbot such as shown in Table VII. 
TABLE VII.  
EXAMPLE PROPMPT FOR PROVIDING REASONING 
Intent 
Obtain the chatbot’s reasoning in addition to the 
answer 
Type of prompt 
Transparency 
Required input 
Information about the situation 
Prompt 
[Prompt] 
 
Response format:  
# Reasoning  
< provide a detailed reasoning here >  
# Response  
< Provide your response here > 
Result 
Answer splitted into two parts, the reasoning behind 
the response and the response itself 
 
Third, as the example prompts have shown, the more 
specific details about the project, its environment, and 
stakeholders are provided, the better the AI chatbot’s 
responses will be. However, this is likely to conflict with 
data protection and privacy. Users should be extremely 
careful about the disclosure of any sensitive information. Not 
only is there the problem of the AI chatbot adding this 
information to its knowledge base and using it to generate 
answers, but it also provides the chatbot with information to 
infer (“to guess”) further sensitive information. A solution 
might be to further develop AI chatbots as business-internal 
solutions which are separated from the outside world. In this 
case, the underlying LLMs could be trained with company-
internal data, e.g., on past projects. This would provide the 
AI chatbot with company-specific knowledge and push it a 
step further to a digital assistant.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The paper explored the possibilities of using an AI 
chatbot, such as ChatGPT, to support project managers in 
their daily work. Patterns of AI-assisted project management 
tasks were identified, showing the wide range of possible 
collaborations between project managers and AI chatbots. 
Examples include using the AI chatbot to generate ideas and

insights, or to act as a sparring partner. The skills required 
for successful collaboration were also presented. Special 
emphasis was placed on prompt engineering. The ability to 
write concise prompts is crucial to achieving results that are 
useful and not superficial. A case study demonstrated how an 
AI chatbot could be used. Examples of prompts were shown 
for stakeholder management activities. Finally, potentials, 
risks and solutions were discussed.
