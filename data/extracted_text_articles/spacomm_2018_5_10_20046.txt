Abstract— In this paper, we address the problem of Direction of
Departure (DOD) and Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar. The work
presented studies the effect of Radar Cross Section (RCS), Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR) and speed of targets on the performance of
the MIMO radar. Analysis can be used to find the direction of
multiple types of targets such as CAPON, MUSIC and parallel
factor (PARAFAC). To differentiate the meaning of targets,
varying targets of different types, such as bicycle, bird, man, ship
and jet have been considered. After defining suitable values for
each type of target in 2D space, the performance of each type is
discussed by using the MATLAB program.

INTRODUCTION
Some of the most important RADAR applications are the
detection performance and high resolution of the moving
target localization. Radar Cross Section (RCS), range, location
and velocity are utility parameters of the moving target [1][2].
To improve the accuracy of target detection and estimation,
antenna arrays have been used. MIMO radar uses multiple
transmitter and multiple receiver elements. Generally, unlike
the phased-array systems, MIMO radar has several advantages
compared to the conventional phased array systems: higher
resolution, more degrees of freedom, improved parameter
specification, better spatial coverage and detection diversity
gain. MIMO radars can be classified into two categories: (1)
MIMO radar with widely separated antennas scheme and (2)
MIMO radar using collocated antennas, which is similar to
phase array radar [3][4]. In the literature, there are many
configurations of MIMO radar according to the location of the
transmitting
and
receiving
elements.
Widely
separated
antennas represent one of these configurations. In this scheme,
the separation between transmitter and receiver should be
large enough to receive the uncorrelated echoes from the
different targets. The main advantage of this scheme is that the
spatial diversity of the targets RCS enhances the radar
performance [5].
In this paper, a bistatic MIMO radar
technique with transmission spatial diversity is proposed, and
the estimation performance is analyzed. Moreover, the angles
with respect to receiver can be determined using the proposed
technique. In addition, the maximum number of targets that
can be identified with this technique is discussed in this paper.
MIMO
radar
can
deal
with
multiple
targets.
Linearly
independent waveforms are transmitted at the same time via
multiple antennas. These independent waveforms are linearly
combined at the targets with different phases, after which the
signal waveforms reflected from different targets are linearly
independent of each other, which allow for the application of
CAPON, MUSIC and PARAFAC algorithms [6]. In this work,
we focus on the application of MIMO radar to the estimation
of DOA and the DOD of multiple targets exist in the same
range bin for bistatic MIMO radar system. We are particularly
interested to optimize the average angular error for different
types of targets.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the
previous work on the subject is summarized. The MIMO radar
signal
model
is
presented
in
Sections
3
and
4.
The
performance of MIMO radar is evaluated through simulations
via MATLAB in Section 5. Some concluding remarks are
given in Section 6.

RELATED WORK
There are many existing methods to localize the moving
target. The following parameters: the Angle of Arrival (AOA),
the Angle of Departure (AOD), the speed of the target and the
RCS are the most used to localize a moving target. Many
techniques have been proposed such as CAPON technique [6],
the MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) technique [7], and
parallel factor analysis (PARFAC) [8].
In this paper, we select a number of different moving
targets: simple and complex targets with different RCS and
speeds. From the existing work on the application of CAPON,
MUSIC and PARAFAC to the localization of different targets,
we notice the importance of the types of targets and the effect
of changing the speed of targets. This paper focuses on
comparing the performance criterion for different types of
targets as well as the impact of the number of antennas on the
performance of three different techniques mentioned above.

MIMO RADAR SIGNAL MODEL
In this section, we consider that the Coherent Processing
Interval (CPI) consists of Q consecutive pulse periods. The
Swelling II target model [8] was assumed, where RCS
coefficient is varying from pulse to pulse. The targets are
located in the far-field. The RCS coefficients are assumed to
vary independently from pulse to pulse, and the propagation
medium is non dispersive.

The baseband received signal at the output of the receive

The third estimator PARAFAC was derived in [11].
PARAFAC implies the transmit and receive angles relative to
the same target are automatically paired.
IV. DATA MODEL
In this section, we consider the multiple pulses, multiple
arrays case.The MIMO radar system has the following
parameters :

Mt transmit array.

Mr receive array.

K targets in a far field.

Q transmitted pulses, and the RCS is varying
independently from pulse to pulse (Swelling II case)

δkq is the reflection coefficient of the Kth target
during the qth pulse.

{Ɵ}k=1
K , {ɸ }k=1
K are the DODs and DOAs with
respect to transmit and receive array, respectively.
              A(Ɵ) = [ a(Ɵ1),…., a(Ɵk) ] is the transmit steering
vector  relative to K targets, B(ɸ) = [ b(ɸ1),…., b(ɸk) ] is
receiving steering vector relative to K targets.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, MATLAB program simulation results are
presented to verify the above analysis and compare the
performance of the three techniques (Capon, MUSIC and
PARAFAC). Localization of
the multiple
targets for
a
Uniform Linear Array (ULA) configuration at the transmitter
and receiver can be achieved by the above algorithms [8].
We generate the matrices S, A and B as explained in the
previous section. S is generated by [S]m = (1+j/2) [HN]m,
where HN is the N × N Hadamard matrix, and N is fixed to
256.

where vk is the target velocity, Tp =5x10-6 is the pulse
duration in seconds, λ =3 x 108 /fc, with fc = 1 GHz.
This subsection analyzes the impact of the number of
targets
on the performance detection.
The
performance
criterion is the absolute value of the difference between the
true angle and estimated angle, averaged over transmit and
receive angles and over all targets. In a first experiment
(Figure 1), we consider seven types of targets. The variance
and speed of each target was given in Table I. We simulate the
presence of two to six targets , starting from K=2 with DODs
[ 100 , 200 ] and
DOAs
[00,300 ] until K=6, DODs [ 100 ,
200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600] and DOAs [00, 300, 50, 150, 25 ,30 ].
The number of pulses is Q = 100, number of samples for each
transmitted pulses is L =512, SNR =10 dB, and Swerling II
model is chosen. We plotted the performance of the CAPON
method, and we compared the performance of the different
types of targets via Monte Carlo simulation. From Figure 1, it
is clear that a better angular resolution is achieved when the
target is "Man" and the worst angular resolution is achieved
when the target is "Car". From Figure 1, we observe that the
global performance of all types of targets seriously degrade
when the number of targets is increased. In Figure 2, we
simulate the presence of two to six targets. The other
parameters are the same as in Figure 1, but, in this case we
have plotted the performance of the MUSIC technique. We
compare the performance of the different types of targets via
Monte Carlo simulation. From Figure 2, it is clear that a better
angular resolution is achieved when the target is "Boat" and
the worst angular resolution is achieved when the target is
"Fighter". From Figure 2, we observe that the global
performance of all types of targets seriously degrades when
the number of targets is increased.
In Figure 3, we simulate the presence of two to six targets.
The other parameters are the same as in Figure 1, but, in this
case, we have plotted the performance of the parallel factor
(PARAFC) technique, and we compared the performance of
the different types of targets via Monte Carlo simulation.
From Figure 3, it is clear that the best angular resolution is
achieved when the target is "Car" and the worst angular
resolution is achieved when the target is "Jet". From Figure 3,
we observe that the global performance of all types of targets
seriously degrades when the number of targets is increased.
This subsection analyzes the impact of signal to noise
ratio on the performance detection. In a second experiment
(see Figure 4), we simulate the presence of three targets( K=3)
characterized by DODs [100 , 200 ,300 ] and DOAs [-100,- 200
,-300 ]. The number of pulses Q = 100, the number of samples
for each transmitted pulse L =512, the number of transmit and
receive sub arrays is fixed to 5, SNR  ϵ ( 0,2,4,6,8,10 ) dB,  
and the Swerling II model is chosen. We plotted the
performance of the CAPON method, and we compared the
performance of the different types of targets via Monte Carlo
simulation. From Figure 4, it is clear that the best angular
resolution is achieved when the target is "Bird" and the worst
angular resolution is achieved when the target is "Bicycle". As
expected, from Figure 4, we observe that the performance of
all types of targets improves when the signal to noise ratio
increases. In Figure 5, we simulate the presence of three
targets. The other parameters are the same as in Figure 4, but,
in this case, we have plotted the performance of the MUSIC
technique, and we compared the performance of the different
types of targets via Monte Carlo simulation. From Figure 5, it
is clear that a better angular resolution is achieved when the
target is "Bird" and the worst angular resolution is achieved
when the target is "Bicycle". In Figure 6, we simulate the
presence of three targets. The other parameters are the same as
in Figure 4, but, in this case, we have plotted the performance
of the parallel factor (PARAFAC) technique and we compared
the performance of the different types of targets via Monte
Carlo simulation. From Figure 6, it is clear that the best
angular resolution is achieved when the target is "Bird" and
the worst angular resolution is achieved when the target is
"Jet".

encountered in MIMO radar detection are radar cross section
and speed of the target. To illustrate the impact of these two
parameters on the performance of MIMO radar, several types
of targets and three popular techniques (CAPON, MUSIC and
PARAFC)
were
considered
for
comparison.
From
the
simulation results, we have shown that irrespective of the
radar cross section and speed of target a high performance
(low angular error) can be obtained when the signal to noise
ratio increases. On the contrary, low performance can be
obtained when the number of targets increases.
