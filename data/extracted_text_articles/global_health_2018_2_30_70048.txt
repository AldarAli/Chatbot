Abstract—In this article, we present a clinical
pathway
specification methodology for data driven medical process
modelling. Our model takes into consideration patients privacy
preservation. It gives special attention to shared medical
documents structure and content. Furthermore, our model
describes the different clinical tasks, typically included in
hospitals care pathways. It also exposes the underlying shared
patient data enclosed within the medical documents required
by the clinical pathway subject to execution. This research
aims first of all to identify, for each clinical task that requires
data processing or sharing, the level of protection that data
requires. For this, we suggest to extend existing business
process modelling languages with special means highlighting
medical data. As a second step, we aim to map each extracted
data category to a set of privacy requirements as demanded by
the
Health
Insurance
and
Accountability
Act
(HIPAA)
legislation. This will ensure the respect of data protection
requirements since a very early stage of Hospital Information
Systems (HIS) design.

I.
INTRODUCTION
In order to improve services’ quality within a hospital
environment, it is important to automate the underlining
workflows of each clinical process adopted within the
hospital. This needs the design and the implementation of
business process models tailored for the concerned field.
Medical healthcare is a multidisciplinary field. Its business
processes and workflows are very complex. Throughout
each medical process, several types of clinical information
need to be circulated and treated within or without the
hospital’s
boundaries.
Medical
data
are
produced,
transmitted
between
medical
departments
and
shared
between healthcare professionals throughout the clinical
pathways enforced by the hospital information systems in
use. Several types of medical data documents are processed,
including
admission
papers,
insurance
documents,
prescriptions, confidential letters, medical images, imaging
reports, biological reports, other types of medical reports,
etc. All the mentioned clinical documents include diverse
health information, among which we distinguish sensitive
information that is considered as highly Protected Health
Information (PHI). Personal healthcare information is not
only used in healthcare practices and shared between
healthcare professionals, but also in public practices and
research activities such as public health surveillance and
public health research. Public health practices and research
present risks that are related to the unauthorized disclosure
of
PHI
[1].
Therefore,
it
is
crucial
for
healthcare
organizations to ensure PHI protection and to preserve the
privacy of individuals. Particularly, the individual’s privacy
protection is required by legislation, such as the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
legislation [16][17] and the European Directive [18] on
personal
data
protection.
As
a
consequence,
privacy
requirements
should
be
respected
and
ensured
when
designing
systems
and
procedures
for
health
data
management.
Our approach is based on privacy by design, which
means the implementation of privacy requirements since an
early stage of healthcare information systems design with
respect to carrying out clinical pathways. In this paper, we
take the osteosarcoma clinical pathway as a case study to
validate our approach. The details of our approach are as
follows:
●
Model medical care pathways as business processes
that emphasise shared clinical data aiming to
identify sensitive health information among them.
●
Identify the privacy requirements and procedures
for each type of sensitive health data identified
within the business process representing each care
pathway.
●
Identify a clinical data model based on the business
process modelling.
●
Define the sensitive health information categories.
●
Define the HIPAA legislation requirements to
preserve the patient’s privacy and confidentiality
with regards to the use of their PHI.
●
Model the clinical pathways based on business
process modelling in order to extract the shared
clinical
documents
between
healthcare
professionals.
●
Identify the PHI underlining each process model.

from any disclosure or misuse.
This paper is divided into sections as follows: in Section
II, we present the related work; in Section III, we present the
clinical pathway subject to study, as well as the clinical
pathway modelling language of our choice. We adopt a data
driven
business
process
clinical
pathway
modelling
approach. In Section IV, we present our clinical document
architecture. In Sections V and VI, we define the privacy
requirements for PHI, followed by results and discussion. In
Section VII, we present the conclusion and future work.

RELATED WORK
In the literature, clinical pathways are textually and
medically
described.
Their
business
processes
and
workflows are mostly detailed by doctors using textual
description of the sequenced tasks. Due to the technological
revolution in the medical field that includes medical
information systems, several methods and business process
modelling languages have emerged. This includes the
Integration DEFinition language (IDEF) (V.0 and V.3), the
Unified Modelling Language (UML) V.2.0 and the Business
Process Model and Notation language (BPMN). Most of
these
technologies
were also
used
to
model clinical
pathways [2].
BPMN is the most widely used and accepted language in
medical process modelling thanks to its simple and high-
level process construction. Clinical pathways processes are
known as complex. This needs a transparency of the whole
process elements such as structures, participants, tasks,
roles, etc. Modelling care pathways in the form of clinical
processes is considered as a solution to overcome its
complexity and define its requirements with regards to
patients and health care professionals. Therefore, medical
processes
models
should
be
simple,
transparent
and
understandable as much as possible [3][4].
Despite the importance of business process modelling in
clinical pathways and efforts for processes’ automation, few
works are dealing with care pathways’ automation. Most of
them are relying on a business process-based modelling
approach.
Besides,
there
is
some
suggested
BPMN
extension implementation such as the Clinical Pathway (CP)
extension of the BPMN called BPMN4CP which proposes
an
ontology
based-
extension
for
e-health
process
management. Other existing research works offer clinical
textual description of the care pathways processes. In
addition, other works were interested in analyzing systems
behavior
throughout
business
process-based
modelling
using UML, particularly, UML class diagram [5]-[7].
However,
less
effort
was
made
in
investigating
approaches for clinical data modelling with special interest
in privacy preservation. In this context, our work is
addressed to the respect of privacy requirements since a
very early stage of HIS design in order to ensure a protected
rolling of data driven business processes that are clinical
pathway-oriented.
III.
CLINICAL PATHWAYS
Clinical
pathways
are
acknowledged
as
complex
processes due to the diversity of the participating entities
(e.g.,
healthcare
professionals
and
medical
service
providers). Throughout the literature exploration of the
clinical pathways’ modelling and automation, we extracted
the main phases underlining care pathway processes. A
generic clinical pathway begins by an admission phase in
which the patient is allowed to get access to the care
establishments. This is usually followed by a diagnosis
phase: that describes the visiting of the consulting doctor
and having clinical diagnosis performed. The treatment
phase should then occur: after identifying the pathology in
the second phase, the treating doctor identifies the treatment
protocol. This clinical pathway ends with the follow-up
phase which allows the involved practitioner to monitor and
evaluate the effectiveness of the prescribed treatment or to
control the pathology progression [8].
The clinical pathway is a set of processes and sub-
processes in which one or more healthcare professionals
participate. The business process modelling of clinical
pathways allows to identify the tasks, the participants and
their roles in the care pathway proceeding. Even the shared
data between healthcare professionals may also be modelled
and identified among a clinical pathway-oriented business
process [9].
In the following sections, we will detail the clinical care
pathway of osteosarcoma and describe a step by step
methodology to model our clinical business process.
A. An Overview of Osteosarcoma Clinical Pathways
Osteosarcoma is a bone cancer. It most commonly
reaches those aged from 10 to 30. A great part of this
affected population concerns teenagers. Each year, from 800
to
900
people
are
estimated
to
be
diagnosed
with
osteosarcoma in the United States. Osteosarcomas are
primary malignant bone tumors. They can be classified
according to cells’ behavior under the microscope as high,
intermediate or low grade [10].
Osteosarcoma clinical care pathways are characterized
by their complex and multidisciplinary procedures with their
difficult
management
facts.
By
Ferrante
[3],
the
osteosarcoma
first
diagnosis
starts
with
symptoms
appearances like bone pain or soreness, a felt mass through
the skin, swelling and redness, etc. During the clinical
pathway
diagnosis
phase,
while
an
osteosarcoma
is
suspected,
some
standard
imaging
exams
must
be
performed. Once the osteosarcoma is confirmed and its
malignancy is not excluded, a biopsy should be performed
allowing the cancer staging. As a final checkup step, several
imaging exams are performed to verify the existence of
metastases. A percentage of 85% indicates that the most
common metastases appear in the lung whereas the bone is
considered as the second most common site of distant
disease [11].

GLOBAL HEALTH 2018 : The Seventh International Conference on Global Health Challenges

The osteosarcoma checkup and grading steps allow the
choice
of
the
treatment
procedure
which
includes
chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery operation. The
identification of the right therapy protocol is based on
biological analyses. To verify and evaluate the treatment
efficiency, the patient has to be periodically followed-up.
This osteosarcoma clinical pathway follow-up step is based
on the performing of imaging exams in addition to
biological analyses as needed [11]-[13].
The complexity of the osteosarcoma clinical pathway
business process is due to the collaboration between
healthcare professionals from several medical departments.
This process can not be accomplished without clinical data
sharing and transmission. For that, it is necessary to respect
the applicable data protection regulation.
B. BPMN as Clinical Pathway Modelling Language
To model clinical pathways, we used the BPMN as a
modelling language. It is the most widely used language in
healthcare business process modelling. First, we explored
the
clinical
healthcare
pathways
in
the
literature
on
description of clinical pathways. Then, we divided them into
three main phases, diagnosis or check-up, treatment and
follow-up,
mentioned
above.
Throughout
the
studied
clinical pathways, we present the osteosarcoma clinical
pathway as a case study to illustrate our data driven clinical
healthcare pathway model. In order to elaborate the clinical
pathway data driven model, we used the common patterns
and symbols of the BPMN modelling language [2].
C. Osteosarcoma Clinical Pathway Modelling Using
BPMN
In order to identify the clinical data that may be
transmitted and shared between healthcare professionals as
required by standard care pathway specifications, we
modelled the osteosarcoma clinical pathway in the form of a
business process model. In this way, we could first identify
the characteristics of performed clinical tasks. Then, we
could highlight the data driven tasks for the chosen
pathology. The sections below present the data driven
clinical pathways of osteosarcoma for the check-up, the
treatment and the follow-up phases respectively.
1)
Osteosarcoma checkup clinical pathway
Fig. 1 presents the check-up phase of the osteosarcoma
clinical pathway as well as the shared and transmitted
clinical documents, ensuring the steps required by the care
pathway definition. The osteosarcoma clinical pathway is
complex and involves collaboration of healthcare providers
and diverse medical services including radiology, biology,
nuclear medicine, surgical units, etc., as shown in Fig. 1,
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. After the patient admission, a medical
consultation
takes
place.
According
to
the
clinical
examination, medical tests are performed to accomplish the
diagnoses phase and precise the pathology Fig. 1.

2)
Osteosarcoma treatment clinical pathway
Based on tests’ findings within the diagnosis phase, the
doctor defines the treatment phase according to systems
review by biological tests, audiogram hearing tests and heart
tests. By Luetke [12], during the treatment, medical tests
and clinical examination are performed to evaluate its
effectiveness, as shown in Fig. 2.
Figure 2. Osteosarcoma clinical pathway business process of treatment.
3)
Osteosarcoma follow up clinical pathway
The last step is the following-up phase presented in
Fig. 3. According to Paiolil [13], the doctor follows the
patient health status by performing some tests and
medical examination to check periodically the treatment
effectiveness.
Throughout
the
three
phases
of
the
osteosarcoma
clinical
pathway,
diverse
clinical
documents are shared, transmitted and updated within the
Shared Medical Record (SMR) ensuring the healthcare
continuity.

IV.
SHARED CLINICAL DOCUMENT ARCHITECTURE
A patient’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) must
contain all types of clinical documents including their
medical history record, discharge summaries, typical paper
charts, mental status examinations and other medical
reports, such as medical tests and operative reports.
Throughout a clinical business process, the EHR is
transferred,
updated
and
shared
between
healthcare
professionals ensuring the continuity of care. Each clinical
document included in the EHR contains medical data as it is
required in the concerned healthcare establishment.
The general clinical document architecture is divided
into documents, fragments and data. As shown in Fig. 4,
clinical documents are composed of many fragments. They
provide
information
about
patients,
procedures,
practitioners, diagnosis, findings and appointments. The
clinical shared documents’ architecture model, illustrated in
Fig.
4,
could
be
adapted
to
another
health
care
establishment, according to the used medical documents’
structure in their boundaries. In each clinical document
fragment, several medical data are found with specific
properties which need the implementation of a privacy by
design approach. This is dedicated to the PHI use and
disclosure
within
the
HIS.
The
identification
and
demographic fragments in clinical documents include PHI.
Its use should obey to the data protection law principles and
privacy requirements ensuring the PHI privacy and the
security of the medical data in use [14] [15].
This
could
be
applied
by
the
use
of
security
computerized
methods
(e.g.
encryption,
decryption,
anonymization and pseudonymization) since an early stage
of the design of the HIS.

V.
PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR PHI PROTECTION
The use of clinical healthcare data is governed by many
jurisdictions as it may present risks threatening a person’s
life and may affect both his privacy as well as his
professional life. For this, Clinical data usage must be set
for data protection principles. In particular, the following
eight principles should be respected:
1-
Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: personal
data should be processed lawfully, fairly in a
transparent way.
2-
Purpose
limitation:
personal
data
should
be
processed for specific purposes.
3-
Data
minimization:
personal
data
should
be
adequate,
relevant
and
limited
to
the
precise
purposes.
4-
Accuracy: personal data should be kept up to date.
5-
Storage limitation: personal data should be kept for
no longer than the necessary period for the purposes
for which those data are processed.
6-
Rights: people have the right to access their data
and give permission for other entities to use or
disclose them.
7-
Integrity and confidentiality: personal data should
be processed in a secure way. They should be
protected also against any unauthorized or unlawful
processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage.
8-
International transfers: personal data should not be
transferred outside countries [14].
International
law
frameworks,
such
as
European
directive and HIPPA for personal data protection are based
on the previous data protection principles. The present work
is developed with regard to Protected Health Information
within HIPAA regulation. The HIPAA Privacy Rule is
published by the department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) to ensure health information privacy. The privacy
rule is applied to covered entities as health plans, healthcare
clearinghouses and the healthcare providers. It defines a set
of rules in order to protect sensitive health information with
respect
to
its
use
and
disclosure.
Sensitive
health
information is known as Protected Health Information
(PHI). They are individually identifiable health information
related to the patient’s past, present and future physical or
mental health conditions, the healthcare provision to the
individuals and the past, present or future healthcare
provision to individuals [1]. The individually identifiable
health information includes demographic data and many
common identifiers. PHI usage and disclosure are permitted
without the patient’s informed consent for some purposes
and situations as to the individual, the treatment, payment
and healthcare operations, opportunity to agree or object,
incidence to an otherwise permitted use and disclosure or
public interest and benefit activities as well as a limited data
set for research, public health or healthcare operations
purposes or when it is required by law. As for the not
29

GLOBAL HEALTH 2018 : The Seventh International Conference on Global Health Challenges

permitted PHI usage and disclosures, an individual’s written
authorization (consent) must be obtained [16].
In addition to permitted PHI use and disclosure,
prohibited ones are defined in Privacy Rules. For example,
genetic information is considered as PHI and they shall not
be used or disclosed for underwriting purposes as well as
the psychotherapy notes. Furthermore, PHI may not be sold
by covered entities. The PHI use and disclosure must be
limited to the minimum necessary. However, PHI may be
used
to
create
a
non-individually
identifiable
health
information or a de-identified information [16][17].
The HIPAA Privacy Rule also defines a set of PHI de-
identification requirements in order to use and disclose it
without the patient’s authorization. A covered entity may
de-identify PHI
by removing
the
eighteen
identifiers
specified in the following list:
1.
Names.
2.
Addresses with all geographic subdivisions smaller
than a State.
3.
Dates
except
year
(birthdate,
admission
and
discharge date, date of death).
4.
Telephone numbers.
5.
Fax numbers.
6.
Email addresses.
7.
Social security numbers.
8.
Medical record numbers.
9.
Health plan beneficiary numbers.
10. Account numbers.
11. Certificate/license numbers.
12. Vehicle identifiers, serial numbers and license plate
numbers.
13. Device identifiers and serial numbers.
14. URLs (Web Universal Resource Locators.
15. IP (Internet Protocol) address numbers.
16. Biometric identifiers (finger and voice prints).
17. Full face photographic images and any comparable
images.
18. Any unique identifying number characteristic or
code [16].
For
the
above
identified
PHI
use
and
disclosure
purposes, de-identification based on computerized methods
is necessary to respect the PHI privacy and ensure its
protection from any illegal use or other threatening risks.
VI.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this present work, we are interested in studying
medical business processes in order to elaborate a data
driven clinical pathway model, based on the BPMN
language. The aim here is to ensure the respect privacy
requirements since early stages of HIS design. Then, we
divided clinical data into categories and extracted PHI
among them in the form of data model clinical pathway.
After that, we defined both personal data protection
principles
and
HIPAA
privacy
requirements
for
the
specified PHI use and disclosure. Finally, all of the above
listed objectives were validated through the modelling of
osteosarcoma care pathway business process model chosen
as a case study.
As for the completion of the modelling phase of
osteosarcoma
clinical
pathway,
we
have
modeled
its
complex care pathway which is divided into three phases:
check-up, treatment and follow-up. This was done using the
actual BPMN language simple patterns. Hence, personal
data processing is integrated in the processes, particularly,
in a legislation compliant manner which adds more trust to
medical documents processing and sharing during the
clinical process implementation.
Many difficulties were encountered in clinical pathway
modelling
using
BPMN
due
to
the
complexity
and
multidisciplinary aspect of medical procedures. This has led
us to conclude the necessity of a more specialized care
pathway modelling language. This has also highlighted the
need for a new care pathway modelling and automation
language that is sensitive-data driven and could integrate
privacy requirements specification. Thus, a new extension
of the BPMN modelling language is required.
VII.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Clinical pathways automation is highly required in
standardized HIS. This is traditionally ensured by business
process modelling. In this context, we developed a data
driven
clinical
pathway
business
process
model
for
osteosarcoma, as a case study. We used BPMN as clinical
pathway business process modelling language. A shared
clinical data model was elaborated further to the clinical
business process model.
Since personal data management must obey to data
protection law, we defined both personal data protection
principles and HIPAA privacy requirements with relation to
patients identifying medical documents, in terms of their
both use and disclosure.
The adoption of a privacy by design approach offers a
better enforcement of privacy since an early stage of
computer-based healthcare systems design. This allows an
orthogonal integration of privacy obligations throughout the
clinical process. For this reason, we are working currently
on extending the BPMN process modelling language with
privacy annotation features and additional patterns to allow
the modelling of privacy specification as part of clinical
processes.
We
are
aiming
to
define
a
common
vocabulary
qualifying clinical pathways specifications with respect to
privacy requirements. We believe clinical process modelling
languages should be more adapted to a multidisciplinary
clinical systems users’ profile. Thus, we are planning to
investigate the adoption of a variety of symbols and
modelling
patterns
that
are
better
tailored
to
the
requirements of the clinical community.
