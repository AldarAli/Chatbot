Abstract—Nowadays, many people use a Social Networking Ser-
vice (SNS). Most SNS users are careful in protecting the privacy
of personal information: name, age, gender, address, telephone
number, birthday, etc. However, some SNS users disclose their
personal information that can threaten their privacy and security
even if they use unreal name accounts. In this study, we
investigated how these users treated their tweets that potentially
threatened their privacy and security, in other words, whether
they deleted them or not. We collected 233 cases where Twitter
users submitted tweets promising to disclose their personal
information and they did so honestly. Then, we investigated when
they submitted and deleted their tweets disclosing their personal
information. The results of our three-month survey showed that
40 out of the 233 cases were deleted and 50% of them were
deleted within three weeks after they were submitted.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, many people use a Social Networking Service
(SNS) to communicate with each other and try to enlarge their
circle of friends. SNS users are generally concerned about
potential privacy risks [1]. To be speciﬁc, they are afraid that
unwanted audiences will obtain information about them or
their families, such as where they live, work, and play. As
a result, SNS users are generally careful in disclosing their
personal information. They disclose their personal information
only when they think the beneﬁts of doing so are greater
than the potential privacy risks. However, some SNS users,
especially young users, disclose their personal information on
their proﬁles, for example, real full name, gender, hometown
and full date of birth, which can potentially be used to identify
details of their real life, such as their social security numbers.
In order to discuss this phenomenon, many researchers investi-
gated how much and which type of information are disclosed in
SNSs, especially on Facebook [2] [3]. Researchers might think
that personal information disclosed on Facebook is reliable, or
it is possible to check whether personal information disclosed
on Facebook is true. This is because
•
Facebook users are required to register and disclose
their real names when they ﬁrst start using Facebook.
•
Facebook users would be criticized by their friends if
they disclose their personal information dishonestly.
On the other hand, a small number of researchers investigated
how much and which type of information is disclosed by
unreal name account users, such as Twitter users. Researchers
might think that personal information disclosed by unreal name
account users is unreliable. This is because
•
nobody criticizes unreal name account users when
they disclose their personal information dishonestly.
•
true personal information can threaten their privacy
and security even if they use unreal name accounts.
As a result, many of us think that it is natural for unreal
name account users not to disclose their personal information
honestly. However, Watanabe, Nishimura, Chikuki, Nakajima,
and Okada reported that many unreal name Twitter users
seemingly disclosed their personal information honestly [4].
It shows that we do not understand well what unreal name
account users think about disclosing their personal information.
To discuss this problem, it is important to investigate when and
how they submit and delete their messages disclosing their
personal information.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we show how
to collect tweets where submitters seemingly disclosed their
personal information honestly. In Section IV, we analyze when
and how these tweets were submitted and deleted, and discuss
how long submitters interacted with audiences by disclosing
their personal information and when they could not overlook
their potential privacy risks. Finally, in Section V, we present
our conclusions.

RELATED WORK
Personally identiﬁable information is deﬁned as informa-
tion which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity such as social security number, biometric records,
etc. alone, or when combined with other information that
is linkable to a speciﬁc individual, such as date and place
of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. [5] [6]. Internet users
are generally concerned about unwanted audiences obtaining
personal information. Fox et al. reported that 86% of Internet
users are concerned that unwanted audiences will obtain in-
formation about them or their families [1]. Also, Acquisti and
Gross reported that students expressed high levels of concern
for general privacy issues on Facebook, such as a stranger
ﬁnding out where they live and the location and schedule of
their classes, and a stranger learning their sexual orientation,
name of their current partner, and their political afﬁliations
[2]. However, Internet users, especially young users, tend to
disclose personal information on their proﬁles, for example,
real full name, gender, hometown and full date of birth, which
can potentially be used to identify details of their real life,
such as their social security numbers. As a result, many
researchers discussed the reasons why young users willingly
disclose personal information on their SNS proﬁles. Dwyer

items in her tweets.
concluded in her research that privacy is often not expected
or undeﬁned in SNSs [7]. Barnes argues that Internet users,
especially teenagers, are not aware of the nature of the Internet
and SNSs [3]. Hirai reported that many users had troubles in
SNSs because they never thought that strangers observed their
communication with their friends [8]. Viseu et al. reported that
many online users believe the beneﬁts of disclosing personal
information in order to use an Internet site is greater than the
potential privacy risks [9]. On the other hand, Acquisti and
Gross explain this phenomenon as a disconnection between the
users’ desire to protect their privacy and their actual behavior
[2]. Also, Livingstone points out that teenagers’ conception of
privacy does not match the privacy settings of most SNSs [10].
Joinson et al. reported that trust and perceived privacy had a
strong affect on individuals’ willingness to disclose personal
information to a website [11]. Also, Tufekci found that concern
about unwanted audiences had an impact on whether or not
students revealed their real names and religious afﬁliation
on MySpace and Facebook [12]. The authors also think that
most students are seriously concerned about their privacy and
security. However, they often underestimate the risk of their
online messages and submit them. For example, Watanabe,
Onishi, Nishimura, and Okada reported that many students
submit tweets concerning school events and these tweets may
give a chance to other people, including unwanted audiences,
to distinguish which schools students go to [13]. Watanabe,
Nishimura, Chikuki, Nakajima, and Okada also focused on
unreal name Twitter users who promised to disclose their
personal proﬁle items, analyzed the details of their personal
proﬁle items disclosed by themselves, especially their ages,
genders, and heights, and showed that most of the submitters
disclosed their ages, genders, and heights honestly [4].

III.
A COLLECTION OF TWEETS DISCLOSING
SUBMITTERS’ PERSONAL INFORMATION
It is difﬁcult to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ per-
sonal information, such as tweets in Figure 1, directly. To solve
this problem, we focused on tweets where submitters promised
their followers to disclose the same number of their own
personal proﬁle items as likes to their tweets. Figure 2 shows a
tweet submitted by Rina on September 3, 2019. Both in Figure
1 and Figure 2, her screen name is redacted for privacy. Figure
2 shows that Rina promised her followers to disclose the same
number of her personal proﬁle items as likes to her tweet.
Actually, Rina submitted 35 replies disclosing her personal
proﬁle items to her tweet shown in Figure 2 from September
3 to 9, 2019. The ﬁve tweets shown in Figure 1 were the ﬁrst
ﬁve replies submitted by Rina to her tweets shown in Figure
2. As of November 20, 2019, we conﬁrmed that 37 likes were
given to her tweet shown in Figure 2. Watanabe, Nishimura,
Chikuki, Nakajima, and Okada reported that Twitter users
seemingly disclosed their personal information honestly when
they promised to do it, such as Rina’s tweet in Figure 2 [4].
As a result, it is easy to collect tweets disclosing submitters’
personal proﬁle items when we collect tweets promising to
disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items. The reasons why
many Twitter users submitted tweets promising to disclose
their personal proﬁle items might be
•
they thought they looked fun,
•
they wanted to draw attention, and
•
they wanted to know how much attention was paid to
their tweets.
In other words, they seemingly felt like they were taking part
in a game. As a result, most of them kept their promises,
like a game rule, and disclosed the same number of their own
personal proﬁle items as likes to their tweets. Also, they often
used the same sentence in their tweets, like a game password,
as shown in Figure 2, I will show the same number of my
proﬁle items as your likes. In order to collect tweets promising

to disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items, we used the
shared sentence as key to collect them. To be speciﬁc, we
collected these tweets by using twport [14]. Twport helps us
to collect tweets where the given sentence is used. By using
twport, we collected 233 Japanese tweets promising to disclose
submitters’ personal information. These tweets were submitted
from October 3, 2020 to December 20, 2020. We observed the
obtained tweets, likes to them, and their replies once a day at
midnight from October 3, 2020 to January 7, 2021.
IV.
AN ANALYSIS OF TWEETS DISCLOSING SUBMITTERS’
PERSONAL INFORMATION
Most of us might think that it is difﬁcult to determine
whether unreal name account users disclosed their personal
information honestly, and so, it is useless to investigate
them. However, Watanabe, Nishimura, Chikuki, Nakajima, and
Okada found many unreal name Twitter users who seemingly
disclosed their personal information honestly [4]. As a result,
we have a chance to investigate unreal name account users
who disclosed their personal information on Twitter. In this
section, we investigate when and how unreal name Twitter
users submitted and deleted their tweets seemingly disclosing
their personal information honestly. We think the result shows
what they thought about disclosing their personal information
honestly. To be speciﬁc, we survey Twitter users who promised
to disclose their personal information and investigate
•
periods from promising to disclose their personal
information to deleting their tweets,
•
periods from promising to disclose their personal
information to submitting their last replies disclosing
them, and
•
periods from submitting their last replies to deleting
their tweets.
Let us consider one example. A Twitter user, okazu a5,
submitted a tweet promising her followers to disclose the same
number of her own personal proﬁle items as likes on December
18, 2020. Figure 3 shows when okazu a5 received likes from
audiences and submitted her replies disclosing her personal
information. We detected her tweet promising to disclose her
personal information at midnight on December 19, 2020, and
recorded that she received 35 likes and submitted 10 replies
on December 18, 2020 (Day 0 in Figure 3). By December
20, 2020 (Day 2), she received 43 likes and submitted 43
replies disclosing her personal information. Her last reply was
submitted on December 21, 2020 (Day 3). After December
21, 2020, she received three more likes, however, submitted
no more replies. Figure 3 also shows when okazu a5 deleted
her tweets: She deleted them on January 4, 2021 (Day 17).
She also deleted her tweet promising to disclose her personal
information, and so, the number of likes was reduced to zero.
In this case, the period from promising to disclose her personal
information to deleting her tweets was 17 days. Also, the
period from promising to submitting her last reply was three
days. The period from submitting her last reply to deleting her
tweets was 14 days.
A. Periods from promising to deleting tweets
At ﬁrst, we discuss the periods from promising to disclose
submitters’ personal information to deleting their tweets. We
found 40 cases where submitters deleted their tweets disclosing
their personal information. These 40 cases accounted for 17%
of all the cases in the survey. Figure 4 shows the histograms
of the periods from promising to disclose submitters’ personal
information to deleting their tweets. As shown in Figure 4 (a),
the most popular day to delete tweets disclosing submitters’
personal information was Day 1, the next day when they
promised to do it. As shown in Figure 4 (b), 25%, 50%,
and 80% of the 40 cases were deleted within four days, three
weeks, and six weeks, respectively. One thing to note is that we
observed tweets once a day at midnight. As a result, we could
not collect cases where submitters deleted their tweets before
the end of the day when they submitted tweets promising to
disclose their personal information. As mentioned, the most
popular day to delete tweets disclosing submitters’ personal
information was Day 1, the next day when they promised to
do them. We think there were many cases where submitters
deleted their tweets on Day 0, in other words, before the end
of the day when they submitted tweets promising to disclose
their personal information.
B. Periods from promising to submitting last replies
Next, we discuss the periods from promising to disclose
submitters’ personal information to submitting their last replies
disclosing them. We think that they regarded these periods as
times to interact with their audiences. We found 206 cases
where submitters submitted replies disclosing their personal
information. These 206 cases accounted for 88% of all the
cases in the survey. Figure 5 shows the histograms of the
periods from promising to submitting their last replies. As
shown in Figure 5 (a), the most popular day to submitting their
last replies was Day 0, the day when they promised to disclose
their personal information. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 5
(b), in 75 % of the 206 cases, last replies were submitted in
Day 0 or Day 1. In more than 90 % of the cases, the periods
from promising to submitting last replies, in other words, the
periods to interact with their audiences, were within four days.
On the other hand, there were 27 cases where we could not ﬁnd
replies, however, it does not mean that submitters submitted no
replies in these cases. As mentioned, we observed tweets once
a day at midnight. We could not detect their replies submitted
on the day when they deleted their tweets.

C. Periods from submitting last replies to deleting tweets
Finally, we discuss the periods from submitting last replies
to deleting tweets disclosing submitters’ personal information.
We think these periods show how long it took for submitters
to think that they could not overlook their potential privacy
risks. We found 31 cases where submitters submitted replies
disclosing their personal information and deleted them. These
31 cases accounted for 13% of all the cases in the survey.
Figure 6 shows the histograms of the periods from submitting
last replies to deleting tweets disclosing submitters’ personal
information. As shown in Figure 6 (a), the most popular day
to deleting their tweets after submitting last replies was Day
1, the next day when they submitted last replies. As shown in
Figure 6 (b), in 50 % and 80 % of the 31 cases, their tweets
were deleted within 18 days and 42 days after submitting last
replies, respectively. In this survey, there were nine cases where
we found no replies before submitters deleted their tweets
promising to disclose their personal information. However, it
does not mean that submitters submitted no replies in these
cases. This is because, as mentioned, we could not detect
replies submitted on the day when submitters deleted their
tweets.
V.
CONCLUSION
It is important to investigate how unreal name account
users treat their SNS messages that potentially threaten their
privacy and security. In this paper, we investigated how Twitter
users treated their tweets seemingly disclosing their personal
information. To be speciﬁc, we investigated when submitters
deleted their tweets disclosing their personal information after
they promised to do it. The results of our three-month survey
show that 18 % of the surveyed cases were deleted, and
25 %, 50 %, and 80 % of the cases were deleted within
four days, three weeks, and six weeks, respectively. The most
popular day to delete tweets disclosing submitters’ personal
information was the next day when they promised to do
it. Furthermore, in 90 % of the surveyed cases, submitters
interacted with audiences within four days. We intend to survey
tweets disclosing submitters’ personal information many times

in a day. This is because we do not want to miss tweets
submitted on the day when submitters deleted them.
