 
A Multirate Loss Model of Quasi-Random Input for the X2 Link of LTE Networks 
 
Abstract—In this paper, first we review a multirate loss model, 
whereby we can assess the call-level Quality of Service (QoS) of 
the Long Term Evolution (LTE) X2 link supporting calls of 
different service-classes with fixed bandwidth requirements. 
The X2 interface connects directly two neighboring evolved 
NodeBs and is mainly responsible for the transfer of user-plane 
and control-plane data during a handover. In the model, the 
X2 interface is modelled as a link of fixed capacity. Handover 
calls are accepted in the X2 link whenever available bandwidth 
exists. Secondly, we propose a multirate loss model where calls 
arrive in the X2 link according to a quasi-random process and 
compete for the available bandwidth under the Complete 
Sharing (CS) policy. The CS policy allows calls to enter the 
system when available bandwidth exists. We propose recursive 
formulas for the calculation of time and call congestion 
probabilities as well as link utilization for the CS policy.   
Keywords-LTE; X2; Quasi-random process; congestion; 
recursive formula.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks provide increased 
throughputs via better spectrum exploitation and the use of 
multiple antennas, minimized latencies and a relatively 
simplified (the so-called “flat”) architecture for the Evolved 
Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) 
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) [1].   
The main components of an LTE network are the 
Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and the E-UTRAN. The EPC is 
responsible for the management of the core network 
components and the communication with the external 
network. The E-UTRAN provides air interface, via evolved 
NodeBs (eNBs), to a User Equipment (UE) and acts as an 
intermediate node handling the radio communication 
between the UE and the EPC. Each eNB covers a specific 
cell and exchanges traffic with the core network through the 
S1 interface. An active UE is quite likely to cross the 
boundary of the source cell, causing a handover. A handover 
is the process of a seamless transition of the UE’s radio link 
from the source eNB to one of its neighbors. During this 
transition, the direct logical interface (link) between two 
neighboring eNBs – the X2 link – is used, for the user data 
arriving to the source eNB via the S1 link, to be transferred 
to the target eNB (Figure 1).   
 
 
Figure 1. The S1 interface and the X2 interface between source and 
target eNBs. 
 
The X2 interface is mainly used for the handover 
operation but it also supports load management and inter-
cell 
interference 
coordination 
functions. 
However, 
considering that load management requires a constant but 
negligible bandwidth and assuming homogeneous LTE 
networks, in which interference coordination is not used  [2] 
[3], we consider only the bandwidth required for the 
handover support. Based on the above, the X2 link carries 
both control and user plane traffic. However, according to 
[4][5], control plane traffic is negligible compared to user 
plane traffic. Therefore, we study herein user plane traffic 
only.  
The determination of congestion probabilities in the X2 
link can be based on multirate teletraffic loss models [2] 
[4][5]. In [2], a simple model is proposed by Blogowski, 
Klopfenstein and Renard (BKR model) that studies the 
impact of UE mobility in congestion probabilities. A 
circular source cell is considered, that accommodates a 
finite number of users, who generate quasi-random 
handover traffic [6] and have different bandwidth 
requirements. All UEs are considered having a constant 
velocity and moving in a straight line. The X2 link is 
modeled as a link of fixed capacity that accepts handover 
calls if their total bandwidth requirement is available upon 
their arrival. The calculation of congestion probabilities is 
based on analytical formulas that take into account UEs 
mobility, but can be complex in the case of large systems 
with large capacities and many service-classes. This is 
because enumeration and processing of the state space are 
required. In [4], a richer stochastic model is proposed by 
Widjaja and La Roche (WLR model), which is based on a

fluid mobility model [7][8] and the classical Erlang 
Multirate Loss Model (EMLM) [9][10]. Calls arrive in the 
X2 link according to a Poisson process, have fixed 
bandwidth requirements and compete for the available 
bandwidth under the Complete Sharing (CS policy). In the 
CS policy, a call is accepted in the system if its bandwidth 
requirement is available. Otherwise, the call is blocked and 
lost without further affecting the system. Although the BKR 
and WLR models provide similar congestion probability 
results, we adopt the WLR model  since: a) basic 
performance measures including congestion probabilities, 
link utilization and average number of calls in the system 
can be recursively determined, without the need of state 
space processing (which is essential in [2]), b) various other 
bandwidth sharing policies (e.g., the bandwidth reservation 
policy, also known as guard channel policy, [11]-[16], the 
multiple fractional channel reservation policy [17]-[19] or 
the threshold policy [20]-[26]) can be applied in the X2 link, 
based on [4] and c) various handover arrival processes can 
be studied, e.g., the quasi-random arrival process, the 
batched Poisson process or an ON-OFF process [27]-[32]. 
Finally, in [5], a multirate loss model is proposed, based on 
the EMLM, assuming that traffic in the X2 link is elastic. 
Elastic traffic refers to calls whose allocated bandwidth is 
not fixed during their lifetime in the system. To model the 
bandwidth sharing policy in the case of elastic traffic the 
processor sharing discipline is considered [33]-[40].  
In this paper, we study the X2 link at call-level and 
analyze it as a multirate loss system. To this end, we extend 
the WLR model to include the quasi-random arrival process 
(WLR-q model). In the quasi-random process, calls are 
generated by a finite number of users, a realistic assumption 
in the case of handover calls. Thus, the quasi-random 
process is smoother than the random (Poisson) process 
where calls are generated by an infinite number of users 
[12], [41]-[45].  
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we 
review the WLR model of [4]. In Section III, we propose the 
WLR-q model. In Section IV, we present analytical TC 
probabilities results for the proposed model and the model 
of [4]. We conclude in Section V.    
 
II. 
REVIEW OF THE WLR MODEL 
Consider a circular source cell of radius R , which 
accommodates Poisson arriving calls of K different service-
classes. Calls of service-class k (k=1,…,K) follow a Poisson 
process with arrival rate λk and have a generally distributed 
service time, 
k 1
  . Contrary to the BKR model, in the WLR 
model a fluid mobility model is considered for the 
determination of the offered traffic-load in the X2 link.  
The fluid mobility model of [4] considers traffic flow as 
the flow of a fluid. Such a model can be used to model the 
behavior of macroscopic movement (i.e., the movement of 
an individual UE is considered of little significance) [8]. 
This fluid mobility model formulates the amount of traffic 
flowing out of a circular region of a source cell to be 
proportional to the population density within that region, the 
average velocity, and the length of the region boundary. For 
a circular region with a population density of ρk (UEs of 
service-class k per km2), an average velocity of vk, and a 
diameter of L=2πR, the UE crossing rate per unit time,
k
CR , 
from a source to any neighbor cell is:

the source eNB and the UE. 
Let bk be the data rate of an active service-class k UE 
and nk be the in-service service-class k UEs in the X2 link.

To determine the X2 link occupancy distribution, q(j), it

the un-normalized values of q(j)’s can be determined by the 
classical Kaufman-Roberts recursive formula [9][10]:

 is the normalization constant. 
TC probabilities are determined by the proportion of time 
the system is congested and measured by an outside 
observer. Call Congestion (CC) probabilities refer to the 
probability that a UE is blocked and lost. Due to the 
assumption of Poisson arrivals, TC and CC probabilities 
coincide (PASTA property, [6]).

III. 
THE PROPOSED WLR-q MODEL 
In the WLR model, calls compete for the available 
bandwidth of the X2 link under the CS policy. In this 
section, we extend the WLR model by considering the case 
of quasi-random traffic.  
Consider the X2 link of fixed capacity 
CX 2
 that 
accommodates K different service-classes. Calls of service 
class k (k =1,…,K) require bk channels and come from a 
finite source population Nk while the mean arrival rate of 
service-class k idle sources is λk,fin = (Nk - nk)sk where nk is 
the number of in-service calls and sk is the arrival rate per 
idle 
source. 
Assuming 
a 
population 
density 
of
2
k
Nk
R



for a circular region and that the UEs are 
always active, then the total offered traffic load of service-
class k is 2

N vk
R

while the offered traffic-load per idle 
source of service-class k is given by
,

(in 
erl). This arrival process is known as a quasi-random 
process [6]. If 
k
N   for k = 1,…,K, and the total offered 
traffic-load remains constant, then the arrival process 
becomes Poisson.  
The global balance equation for state n=(n1,…,nk,…,nK), 
expressed as rate into state n = rate out of state n, is given

of nk’s requires the state space determination of the 
equivalent system, a complex procedure especially for large

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, we compare the analytical results of TC 
probabilities, obtained by the proposed WLR-q model for 
various values of velocity and cell radius. For comparison, 
we also present the corresponding analytical results obtained 
in the case of the WLR model.  
Consider an X2 link of capacity CX2 = 50 channels that 
accommodates calls (handovers in progress) of K=3 service-
classes with channel requirements: b1 = 1, b2 = 5 and b3 = 
12, respectively. Calls of each service-class arrive in the link 
according to a quasi-random process and are generated by a 
finite number of sources, Nk = 50, for k=1, 2, 3 (it is 
supposed that, at any moment, the total number of active 
users inside a cell -who are candidate to perform a 
handover- along with those performing a handover, is 
constant). Furthermore, let δ = 0.05 sec, and velocities v1 = 
v2 = v3 = 30 km/h. In the x-axis of Figures 2-4, the velocity 
of all users increases in steps of 2 km/h. So, point 1 refers 
to: (v1, v2, v3) = (30, 30, 30) while point 11 to: (v1, v2, v3) = 
(50, 50, 50).   
Figures 2-4 present the analytical TC probabilities of 
each service-class for three different values of the cell radius 
R = 150, 200 and 250 m. Based on these results, we 
conclude that: 1) TC probabilities are lower in the case of 
quasi-random traffic (WLR-q model) compared to the 
corresponding TC probabilities obtained in the case of the 
Poisson process (WLR model). 2) The increase of velocity 
increases TC probabilities, since it is more probable for a 
call to make a handover. 3) The increase of R reduces TC 
probabilities since it becomes less likely that a call will 
make a handover.

CONCLUSION 
We review a multirate loss model for the call-level 
analysis of the X2 link in LTE networks. The X2 link is 
modelled as a multirate loss system that accommodates 
handover calls from different service-classes with fixed 
bandwidth requirements. Handover calls are accepted in the 
X2 link whenever available bandwidth exists. Otherwise, 
call blocking occurs. Furthermore, we propose a multirate

loss model for the call-level analysis of the X2 link when 
the arrival process becomes quasi-random. We provide 
recursive 
formulas 
for 
the 
calculation 
of 
various 
performance measures including TC and CC probabilities. 
As a future work, we intend to study the applicability of the 
bandwidth reservation and the multiple fractional channel 
reservation policies in the proposed model.
