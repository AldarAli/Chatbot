Abstract—In this paper, a novel design of an Ultra Low voltage
Carry Gate shall be presented. The main objective is to target the
robustness of the presented ciruits. We shall also imply as to what
extent these circuits can be improved and what their beneﬁts,
compared to conventional topologies, are. The design presented,
compared to a conventional CMOS carry gate, is area efﬁcient
and high speed. The relative delay of a ULV carry gate lies at
less than 3% compared to conventional CMOS carry gate. The
circuits are simulated using the TSMC 90nm process technology
and all transistors are of the Low Threshold Voltage (lvt) type.
Index Terms—ULV; Carry Gate; NP domino.
I. INTRODUCTION
As the semiconductor industry grows, the demand for Ultra
Low Voltage (ULV) circuits is increasing. These circuits are
being implemented in VLSI where different kind of func-
tions are combined on one chip. The Arithmetic Logic Units
(ALU)s are one of the many circuits that are implemented
in the VLSI chips. Since an adder is an important part of
the ALU, the speed of the adder used, is important for the
ALU performance. The speed of the adder is determined
by the propagation delay of the carry chain. Although high
speed conventional carry circuits like Carry Look Ahead,
Dual rail domino carry, CPL, etc., are well established design
topologies, their performance at ULV suffers from degradation
[1]. Several approaches are proposed for the improvement of
performance [2][3] but the design presented in this paper is
inﬂuenced by [4]. This paper shall present a new high speed
NP domino ULV carry design. To highlight the improvement,
the results shall be compared to conventional domino design
such as Dual Rail Domino carry. Both the carry circuits are
implemented in a 32-bit carry chain in order to show as to
what extent one is better than the other, regarding their speed
and power.
Section I-A presents a general introduction to the ULV
circuits presented in [5]. Section II presents different conﬁgu-
rations of ULV carry designs and gives an explanation on how
it works. Section III presents the performance of the proposed
ULV carry gate compared to the conventional carry gate.
A. ULV Inverter
1) Evaluation and Precharge Phase: A simple ULV in-
verter model is presented in the Figure 1a. A ULV Semi-
Floating gate circuit design consists of two phases, an evalua-
tion phase, determined by the evaluation transistors En and Ep,
and a precharge phase determined by the precharge transistors
Rn and Rp. As seen in the Figure 1a φ is applied to Rn and

φ is applied to Rp. In such a circuit, the precharge phase
occurs when φ=0 and the circuit enters evaluation phase when
φ=1. During the precharge phase, the input ﬂoating nodes are
charged to a desired level i.e logical 1 or VDD for the En
ﬂoating gate and logical 0 or Ground (GND) for the Ep ﬂoating
gate. No input transition occurs during the precharge phase.
However, once the clock shifts from logical 0 to 1 and has
reached a stable value of 1, an input transition may occur,
which determines the logical state of the circuit’s output. We
can conﬁgure the circuit in an NP domino fashion by engaging
En to φ (where φ=1 during the precharge phase) and Ep to
VDD. Such a conﬁguration yields a precharge level of logical
1 and is called an N-type circuit. On the other hand, if we
engage En to GND and Ep to φ we can obtain a precharge
level of 0. Such a conﬁguration is called a P-type circuit.
Considering the example of N-type inverter, we know that
the output of N-type is precharged to 1. Once φ shifts from 0
to 1, circuit enters the evaluation phase. During the evaluation
phase, there are two possible situations. If no input transition
occurs, the output shall remain unchanged and hold its value
to 1. Indicating that no work is to be done. However, if an
input transition occurs and input is brought to 1 the En2 shall
be turned on and the output shall be brought to logical 0 or
close to 0. This indicates that the only work to be done during
the evaluation phase is to bring the output from 0 to 1 when
an input transition occurs.
We have seen that the only work that is to be done, during
the evaluation phase, is to bring the output to the logical 0
when an input transition occurs. This suggests that Ep2 does

not require an input transition at any stage. Therefore, we can
remove the input capacitor of Ep2. Such a conﬁguration can
be called pseudo SFG ULV inverter and is shown in Figure 1c.
An equivalent P-type Pseudo SFG ULV inverter is shown in
Figure 1b. This will lead to load reduction and hence higher
speed. However, we may encounter some robustness issues
with respect to noise margin due to leakage current.
II. METHODS
Cout = A · B + (Cin · (A ⊕ B))
(1)
The output of a carry circuit is generated using two inputs
and a carry bit from the previous stage, if available (carry bit
at the least signﬁcant bit is always zero so it has no previous
carry), as shown in ﬁgure 2. Equation (1) shows an arithmetic
approach to carry generation where A and B is the input signal
and Cin is the carry bit from the previous stage. There are two
parts of this equation, one is generated internally, A · B, and
can be called carry generation (CG), the other one is dependent
on the carry bit from the previous stage, (Cin · (A ⊕ B)), and
is known as carry propagation (CP). The speed of any carry
chain depends on the second part of this equation, because it
has to wait for the carry bit from the previous stage to arrive.
Inputs A and B both arives simultaneously at any stage of an
N bit carry chain. Most conventional designs use two seperate
parts for CG and CP but the design presented in this paper
differ from the most designs as it is able to generate both
CG and CP by applying all the inputs to a single transistor.
This technique is called Multiple valued Logic (MVL) where
classical truth value, logical 1 and 0, are replaced by ﬁnit or
inﬁnite logical values. It has a potential to decrease the chip
area and total power dissipation[6].
A. Non-Differential Carry Gate
The Static Ultra Low Voltage Carry (SULVC) is a modiﬁed
version of the ULV N-P domino inverter shown in section
I-A. The carry circuit uses a keeper as proposed in [5] and

3 capacitors in parallel at the input gate providing the input
logic for the circuit. The circuit is designed to make the A and
B signal cancel each other out when A and B have contrasting
values to allow the carry input signal to determine the carry
output in this case. Because of the cancellation requirement
between the A and B signals they need to arrive as equally
sized rising or falling transitions, this can be acheived by
utilizing level-to-edge converters or a logic style with a VDD/2
precharge level.
If both A and B are rising, the ﬂoating node will rise
causing a falling transition on the carry output of the N-
type circuit regardless of the carry input signal. If they are
both falling, the carry input signal can not elevate the ﬂoating
node voltage enough to cause a transition, leaving the carry
output at precharge level. If A and B are not equal, their two
transitions cancels each other out and the ﬂoating node remains
at precharge level until a possible rising edge occurs on Cin. A
P-type equivalent of the circuit is shown in Figure 3 (b) where
all signals and logic are the inverse of those in the N-type
circuit. For both circuits, a transition on the output indicates
carry propagation and they can both be characterized as a carry
generate circuit corresponding with the truth table shown in
Table I, the transition logic for the N-type circuit can be seen
in Table II.
During the precharge phase, the voltage level of the ﬂoating
node is set to ground for the P-type circuit and VDD for the
N-type and can only be changed by the inputs through the
capacitors in the evaluation phase. In these circuits, when used
in CPAs (Carry Propagate Adder), Cin can arrive later than A
and B when the carry bit has to propagate through the chain
of carry circuits. This introduces the challenge of keeping the
output precharge value during the evaluation phase in case no

carry signal arrives. As Figure 4 shows, the ﬂoating node of the
P-type circuit is precharged to 0V. This causes the transistor
Ep2 in Figure 4 (b) to conduct and the output will drift and
may eventually cause an incorrect output value as shown in
Figure 5 at 70ns. The drifting effect is countered with the Kn2
and Kp2 keeper transistors but the effect limits the length of
the evaluation pase and therby the number of carry circuits
that can be put in a chain and the maximum number of bits
an adder based on the circuit can process in one clock cycle.
The maximum achieved number of bits acheived varies with
the supply voltage as shown in Figure 6 and at 300mV a 32-bit
carry chain can be implemented.
The transistor sizing is adjusted to accommodate the change
in NMOS/PMOS mobility difference with changed supply
voltage. In these simulations the NMOS evaluation transistor
size is kept minimum sized and the PMOS evaluation transistor

B. Differential Carry Gate
In order to overcome the challenges with robustness and
drifting of the SULVC circuit, a differential approach is a
possible solution. A Static Differential Ultra Low Voltage
Carry (SDULVC) as shown in Figure 7 is designed in exactly
the same manner as the SULVC, however with differential
inputs and outputs. The differential nature of the circuit makes
it less prone to drifting and eliminates the need for level-
to-edge converters it can be sized to allow a single edge
without causing an output transition. The outputs of the
proposed circuit are precharged to the same level during the
precharge phase, however it yields a differential output during
the evaluation phase. So, instead of employing an inverter to
obtain the carry bit we can read it from the opposite end of
the circuit, i.e. in an N-type SDULVC if inputs A B and C
are applied to En2 output can be read from Vout−. Figure 7
demonstrates the design of an SDULVC circuit. The backgate
of the keeper transistors of these circuits are connected to the
ﬂoating gate to achieve maximum robustness.

The variable ’i’ in (2) denotes the index of the input and
the ’n’ denotes fan-in. Vinitial is the precharge voltage level of
the ﬂoating gate. CinHigh is a combination of input capacitors
with a high (rising) input.
Considering an example of an N-type SDULVNC we can
calculate the voltage level of the ﬂoating gate using (2). We
assume that the diffusion capacitance is equal to the input
capacitance and that the supply voltage is equal to the input
voltage. The load capacitance introduced by the keeper’s back-
gate connection to the ﬂoating node should also be considered
and is in this paper assumed to be equal to the input capacitor
as well.
Our calculation in (2) gives us a theoretical idea of the
voltage level at Vfg (ﬂoating gate voltage). In the real world
the capacitance size might not be exactly the same as our
assumption and depends on transistor size and many other
factors like process variation and mismatch. The simulation
results of the voltage levels for the ﬂoating gate in the Figure 8
shows that the ﬂoating node is precharged to 270mV. Equation
(2) yields an analytical result for the ﬂoating gate input of
330 mV, 390mV and 450 mV for one, two and three high
inputs, respectivly. The simulation results in Figure 8a shows
that the voltage level of the ﬂoating node gets to 330mV for a
single rising input transition and to 420mV when all inputs are
high. These results are marginally different from the calculated

values. This is possibly due to the assumptions on capacitance
sizes. Figure 8a shows that if only one input gets high, the
keeper transistor turns on and discharges the ﬂoating node. The
reason for this is that the transition at the input, i.e. 60mV, is
not sufﬁcient to produce enough current at the output. Figure
8b shows the results for two high inputs and all low inputs.

III. SIMULATION
A. 32 bit SDULVC chain
A 32 bit ULV carry chain is implemented using 32
SDULVC circuits connected in a chain or NP domino fashion
shown in Figure 9. Figure 11 shows the simulation response of
a 32 bit ULV carry chain. The propagtion delay of this carry
chain is 17ns. In order to compare the SDULVC to other carry
gate topologies, a dual rail domino carry gate designed in a
hybrid fashion, i.e. instead of utilizing conventional inverters
at the output, the Static Differential ULV inverter presented in
[7] and a conventional NP Domino Dual Rail carry is used.
Compared to the hybrid dual rail domino carry (HDRDC)
chain shown in the Figure 10 the SDULVC chain is almost
10× faster and compared to a Conventional Dual Rail Domino
Carry (CDRDC) this is closer to 35×. These numbers are
based on the propagation delay for the carry bit through the
chain, which is 166ns for the hybrid dual rail domino carry
and 636ns for the conventional dual rail domino carry, all at
300 mV.
The robustness of the SDULVC can be analyzed by looking
at the simulation response shown in Figure 11b. The plot for
the worst case delay scenario, i.e. A=1, B=0, C=0, exhibits
that due to a delayed carry bit and the early arrival of inputs,
A and B, a marginal transition at the output occurs. However,
once the carry bit has arrived, the output shifts to its ﬁnal

value. Average transition at the output for a P-type and N-type
SDULVC when waiting for the carry bit is between 70mV and
100mV. This can be seen as a problem for the noise margin
and power consumption. The output manages to return to the
right ﬁnal value due to synchronisation of keeper signals with
the input. Therefore, the issue of noise margin can be ignored
by concluding that the ﬁnal value can be read at the end of
the evaluation phase.
Figure 12 shows the delay of an SDULVC chain compared
to an HDRDC and a CDRDC chain. Table III shows that the
transistor size has to be increased in order to increase the ON
current of the device [8] and be able to decrease the supply
voltage for HDRDC. Table IV shows the minimum operat-
ing frequency required for the clock to simulate SDULVC,
HDRDC and CDRDC at different supply voltages.

energy efﬁcient circuit. Although the ULV circuits presented
in this paper are power hungry, it still manages to maintain its
PDP at approximately the same level as conventional circuits
where the power consumption is lower. The average power
of the HDRDC and the SDULVC is 0.347µW and 1.28nW
respectively at a supply voltage of 300 mV. This indicates that
the power consumption of HDRDC is up to 3× better than
ULV circuits. However, at the same supply voltage the ULV
circuit is 10× faster than the HDRDC. Therefore, the ULV
circiuts are still more energy efﬁcient. Figure 13 shows PDP
of three different 32 bit carry chain topologies at varied supply
voltage. The minimum energy point of the 32 bit SDULVC
carry chain is found at 240 mV.
Another important charachteristic of any circuit is EDP. It
demonstrates enhanced speed of any circuit with respect to
its energy efﬁeciency. It is obvious that circuits with better
propagation delay shall stand out in this characteristic. Figure
14 shows the EDP of three carry chains and the evident
performance advantages of SDULVC circuits.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new ULV carry circuit has been presented
and performance enhancements have been demonstrated. The
ULV carry circuits are better than conventional topologies in
both speed and energy efﬁciency, shown by comparing the
SDULVC to the HDRDC and CDRDC circuit topologies. A
credible conclusion is that a static differential dynamic ULV
carry circuit is a favorable choice when speed and robustness
at low voltages are important.
