Abstract— Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has 
many techniques that include hydrogen nuclear relaxation 
times, such as: spin-lattice relaxation time in the laboratory 
frame (T1H) and spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame 
(T1ρH). These relaxation parameters involve changes in 
thermal equilibrium of spin systems and the hydrogen 
relaxation times can be measured directly, using low-field 
NMR. The efficiency of the process can be correlated with the 
structure and the value is intrinsically related to the system’s 
morphology; consequently, the relaxation times can be used to 
evaluate the nanoparticles’ dispersion in the polymer matrix; 
the interaction between both nanocomposite components; the 
molecular dynamic of the hybrid compounds and also the 
molecular domains formation in an organic material. This 
feature makes these techniques good tool to analyze the 
molecular dynamics of polymer systems, as well as the 
nanocomposites. In this work, we want to show the evaluation 
of polymeric nanocomposites formation employing the 
determination of proton spin-lattice relaxation time, using low-
field nuclear magnetic resonance. The nanocomposites were 
mainly characterized by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance 
relaxometry through the determination of proton spin-lattice 
relaxation time. The determination of this parameter was 
carried out to evaluate the organoclay exfoliation and 
intercalation process in the polymeric matrix, for samples 
using organoclay as a nanoparticle, as well as the dispersion 
and distribution of them along the macromolecular chains; this 
parameter was also used to detect the dispersion and 
distribution of the spherical and tubular nanoparticles in the 
polymeric matrix. The proton NMR relaxation data showed 
that the polymeric nanomaterials investigated presented good 
nanoparticle dispersion and the distribution, as well as the 
intermolecular interactions between hybrids components.

 INTRODUCTION 
The solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance [1] is a 
spectroscopy that comprehends many techniques, one of 
them is the hydrogen nuclear relaxation times, such as: spin-
lattice relaxation time in the laboratory frame, promotes 
evaluation of the samples in the MHz scale and spin-lattice 
relaxation in the rotating frame is sensitive to the movements 
in the tens of kilohertz [1-3]. Both relaxation parameters 
involve changes in thermal equilibrium of spin systems and 
the responses of them are intrinsically related to the system’s 
molecular dynamic that is derived from the morphology [4-
6]. Consequently, the relaxation measurements can be used 
to evaluate the nanoparticles’ dispersion in the polymer 
matrix, the interaction between both nanocomposite 
components, the molecular dynamic of the hybrid compound 
and also the molecular domains formation in an organic 
material [7-9]. This feature makes these techniques a good 
tool to analyze the molecular dynamics of polymer systems, 
as well as the nanocomposites [8-11]. 
In this work, we want to show the evaluation of polymer 
nanocomposites employing proton spin-lattice relaxation 
time, using the proton relaxation parameter employing low-
field nuclear magnetic resonance.  
This work will present the evaluation of different 
nanostructured materials based on synthetic and biopolymers 
as well distinct nanoparticles by the use of nuclear magnetic 
resonance relaxometry to obtain responses on the 
intermolecular 
interactions 
and 
the 
dispersion 
and 
distribution of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix

EXPERIMENTAL 
A. NMR relaxation measurements 
The relaxation time was analyzed in a MARAN Ultra 
low-field 
NMR 
(LF-NMR) 
spectrometer 
(Oxford 
Instruments, Oxford, UK), using an 18 mm NMR tube, 
operating at 23 MHz for the hydrogen nucleus. The pulse 
sequence used to obtain the spin lattice relaxation time data 
was inversion-recovery (recycle delay - 180° - τ - 90° - 
acquisition data) and the 90° pulse of 4.5µs was calibrated 
automatically by the instrument’s software. The amplitude of 
the FID was sampled for twenty τ data points, ranging from 
0.01 to 5000 ms, using 40 data points and 4 scans for each 
point. The same sample was analyzed at 27 ºC. The 
relaxation values and relative intensities were obtained by 
fitting the exponential data with the aid of the WINFIT 
program. Distributed exponential fittings as a plot of 
relaxation amplitude versus relaxation time were performed 
by using the WINDXP software. Both WINFIT and

WINDXP are commercial programs and come with the low-
field NMR spectrometer. 
All solid-state NMR spectra were obtained on a 
VARIAN spectrometer, UNIT-Plus, 9.4 Tesla, operating at 
104 MHz for 13C nuclei and 79.49 MHz 29Si. The samples 
were packed in a 7mm zirconia rotor that was spun in the 
magic angle at about 6 kHz for the carbons-13 nucleus. The 
13C cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) were 
first done to obtain the conditions to apply the variable 
contact time experiment (VCT), which were carried out 
using 2 s of recycle delay with the increase of contact-times 
varying from 100 to 8000µs, the hydrogen decoupling field 
strength was 40 KHz. From this experiment it was also 
determined the values of proton spin-lattice relaxation time 
in the rotating frame (T1ρH), which is indirectly determined 
from the intensity decay of each resolved carbon. 
Hexamethyl benzene (HMB) was used as external standard; 
the methyl carbons were assigned as 17.3 ppm.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
A. Evaluation of PHB-organoclay systems obtained by 
solution 
Low-field NMR analyses were used to determine the 
proton spin-lattice relaxation time for the PHB/viscogel B8 
nanocomposites. Table I shows the proton T1 relaxation 
values of the PHB/viscogel B8 nanocomposites, the 
nanostructure materials were obtained through intercalation 
solution method.

A decreased in the proton relaxation value with the 
increased of organoclay comes from the exfoliation process 
that occurs predominantly comparing to intercalation 
process. This statement is confirmed by the presence of 
metals in the clay lamellae that are agent that promotes the 
proton relaxing acceleration as the polymer chains are 
around the clay lamellae, confirming the for changes 
occurred the in polymer and clay structures after a polymeric 
nanocomposite being formed. Up to 5% a decreased in the 
T1H is due to the exfoliation process, after this proportion the 
values are still lower than the polymer matrix, due to the 
same effect, but they began to increase, because some 
intercalation process is being done due to the large amount of 
organoclay to be exfoliated, dispersed and distribution in the 
polymer matrix. 
The proton NMR relaxation data showed that the 
polymer nanomaterials investigated presented good nanoclay 
dispersion in the polymeric matrix, promoting a formation of 
mixed nanocomposite structure containing part exfoliated 
and part intercalated.  
 
B. Evaluation of HIPS-organoclay systems obtained by 
solution 
The nanocomposites obtained were mainly characterized 
by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry, 
through T1H measurements. The determination of proton 
spin-lattice relaxation time was carried out to evaluate the 
clay 
exfoliation 
and 
intercalation. 
The 
relaxation 
determination was done in a low-field NMR spectrometer. 
Tables II and III show the T1H data for the polymer system 
containing S4 and S7, respectively, as nanoparticles. S4 
contains Bis (Hydrogenated Tallow Alkyl) Dimethyl 
Ammonium (BHTADMA) as a surfactant and S7 contains 
Dimethyl 
Benzil

According to the relaxation time values listed in both 
Tables II and III, independently of organoclay type used, the 
best quantity of nanoparticle to be well dispersed and 
distributed in the polymer matrix was 2%, in this proportion 
higher degree of exfoliation process occurred, due to the 
decrease in the relaxation time, because of the relaxing effect 
of the paramagnetic metal present in the clay structure. These 
metals influence direct in the protons relaxation decreasing 
it, which confirms the exfoliation process.

C. Evaluation of PLA-silica systems obtained by solution 
Two silica types A200 (hydrophilic) and R972 
(hydrophobic) were incorporated in the PLLA matrix [11] 
and both silica types caused changes in T1H values due to the 
changes in the molecular mobility, as a consequence of 
nanoparticle dispersion and distribution in the polymer 
matrix. Table IV shows the T1H values for the PLLA 
(pellet), 5% PLLA and their nanocomposites with A200 and 
R972 silica.

The effects of 0.5mg of both silica type A200 and R972 
were comparable. However, comparing the addition of the 
samples with 1mg of A200 or R972, the effect of this 
quantity of silica in the system containing A200 was stronger 
than the system with 1mg of R972. 
For film formed from 5% PLLA an increase in the 
quantity of R972 decreased the T1H, which is derived from 
the dispersion of the silica, this system has an opposite 
behavior compared to A200 addition. 
Therefore, both silica types had promoted changes in the 
relaxation time as a consequence of silica dispersion and 
distribution in the polymer matrix. This confirms that the 
relaxation time parameter was effective to show the effect of 
nanoparticles with spherical form, such as silica.  
 
D. Evaluation of EVA-silica systems obtained by melting 
processing 
 
The evaluation of EVA-silica system was evaluated by 
the determination of proton spin-lattice relaxation time in the 
rotating frame, T1ρH, it was determined through the decay of 
the resolved carbons with the increasing of the contact-times, 
obtained during the VCT experiment. The values of this 
parameter are listed in Table V.

The decrease of 50% in the T1ρH value for the EVA 
chains in the EVA/SiO2 5% nanocomposite shows that the 
EVA chains are interacting intimately with SiO2, as a 
consequence of the silica oxide has being well dispersed and 
distributed in the polymer matrix, which causes a decreases 
in the T1ρH parameter due to the decrease in the spatial 
proximity, promoting a strong intermolecular interaction. 
Analyzing the EVA/SiO2 20% T1ρH value, no change in the 
parameter value was found comparing to EVA itself, 
indicating an occurrence of phase separation, because the 
quantity of silica is high to be well dispersed and distributed 
in the polymer matrix, as a consequence an agglomeration of 
silica particles occurs.

Evaluation of EVA-carbon nanotubes system

The relaxation parameter was also used to evaluate the 
polymer nanocomposite when the nanoparticle has a tubular 
form, such as carbon nanotubes.

evolution 
of 
EVA-carbon nanotubes 
modified

nanotubes; these systems were prepared by solution 
dispersion method.

According to the relaxation data, the addition of small 
quantity of carbon nanotubes modified with acid does not 
influence sufficiently the molecular dynamic of the EVA 
matrix, the very low decreased in the relaxation value could 
be associated to some dispersion/distribution of the CNT in 
the EVA matrix. 
These systems were also evaluated by the domain 
distribution curves (Figure 1). The distribution curves show 
some displacement for the systems that contains 0.1 % w/w 
of modified carbon nanotubes, which is in accordance with 
the relaxation data observed in the Table VI.

IV. 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 
According to the relaxation data presented for the 
systems that using biopolymer and distinct nanoparticles we 
can see that independently of nanoparticles form their 
dispersion and distribution in the polymer matrix, as well as 
the intermolecular interaction can be accompanied by the 
proton spin-lattice relaxation time values. 
For the EVA systems the nanostructured materials 
formed present a good nanoparticle dispersion and 
distribution, as a consequence of the preparation mode and 
the polymer matrix nanoparticle pair. 
The evaluation of polymer nanomaterials was clearly 
obtained according to the changes in the relaxation time 
values comparing to the polymer matrix before the 
nanoparticles being incorporated to them. The NMR data 
showed to be a good alternative technique to be used to 
evaluate these type of materials.
