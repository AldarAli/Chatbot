Abstract—Cognitive flexibility is a critical Executive Function
(EFs) that can be broadly defined as the ability to adapt behaviors
in response to changes in the environment, it is more and more
crucial in workplace. First, this paper is aiming to present
the theoretical framework implied in assessment of cognitive
flexibility for personnel selection and recruitment. Second this
paper is aiming to present the protocol of an experiment
conducted (i) to investigate the behaviours and performances
of users/players with the gamified version of sorting test and
(ii) to compare their performances with the traditional paper-
and-pencil version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST),
which is the most popular and the most used standardized test
used to assess cognitive flexibility.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cognitive flexibility, the ability to flexibly switch between
tasks, is a core dimension of Executive Functions (EFs)
allowing to control actions and to adapt flexibly to changing
environments. It supports the management of multiple tasks,
the development of novel, adaptive behavior and is associated
with various life outcomes.
Historically, the assessment of cognitive flexibility was
developed for clinicians to support diagnosis and treatment
for patients with frontal lobe damage and/or cognitive diffi-
culties [1][2][3], such as older people and has been progres-
sively extended to other pathology such as anorexia [4] or
schizophrenia [1].
But because cognitive flexibility is a critical executive
function that can be broadly defined as the ability to adapt
behaviors in response to changes in the environment, it is
more and more crucial in workplace [5][6][7]. Moreover recent
changes in the nature of work require that employers reassess
the modus operandi of their personnel selection procedures.
In particular, employees are increasingly expected to switch
seamlessly between different job roles, tasks, organizations,
and even occupations. In other words, to assess cognitive
flexibility is more and more crucial during personnel selection
because this non-technical skills became central (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Increase of demand for non-technical skills and executive functions
such as cognitive flexibility in workplace across time, based on [8].
This paper is aiming (i) to present an innovative digital
tool (i.e., a gamified sorting test) specifically created to assess
cognitive flexibility for personnel selection and (ii) to present
results issued from an experiment to compare performances
and acceptability with “traditional” tool.
A. Defining and measuring cognitive flexibility
Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to shift attention
between task sets, attributes of a stimulus, responses, per-
spectives, or strategies [9][10]. In the scientific literature, it
is also referred to by shifting, attention switching, or task
switching, and includes both the ability to disengage from
irrelevant information in a previous task and to focus on rel-
evant information in a forthcoming task [11]. Thus, cognitive
flexibility enables to think differently, change perspective and
adapt to a continuously changing environment.
In cognitive ergonomics, most psychological theories (e.g.,
Rasmussen: [12][13]; Reason: [14]; Norman: [15][16]; Holl-
nagel: [17]; for a synthesis [18]) are agree on the idea that
in order to avoid human error, an individual needs to realize
that the situation has changed in order to be able to ‘log
out’ of the automatic processing mode and come into the
controlled processing mode. To detect the situation change

and the necessity of a non–routine response, it is necessary
to come into a higher level of attentional control, where the
individual accesses the new situation and plan the action to
be taken. They need to perceive the environmental cues in a
different way, reinterpreting them. How the person represents
the task and the set of strategies employed to deal with it
determines how easily she or he will shift attention to the new
environmental conditions.
Cognitive flexibility can be assessed with a variety of neu-
ropsychological tests, the most prominent being the Wisconsin
Card Sorting Test (WCST
[1][3]). In this test, participants
are asked to sort a series of cards according to different rules
and alter their strategy when the rules change unexpectedly
(Figure 2). The figure 2 depicts a response card with two
blue stars. The stimulus cards are from left to right; one
red triangle, two green stars, three yellow crosses, and four
blue circles. In the manual administration, the four stimulus
cards would be laid on a table in front of the participant, and
the participant is handed a deck of multidimensional response
cards to sort. Typically, individuals who are less cognitively
flexible struggle to adjust to changing rules, while those with
higher aptitude can quickly switch their mode of thinking
between an efficiency-driven adherence to a given rule and
the exploration of new approaches. As this test was originally
designed for clinical use to detect executive dysfunction, its
suitability for assessing performance in a personnel selection
context has yet to be investigated.

B. Assessment of cognitive flexibility in personnel selection
As Hommel et al. [19] say in their paper published in
2021, recent changes in the nature of work require that
employers reassess the modus operandi of their personnel
selection procedures. In a fast-changing knowledge economy,
employees need to adapt quickly to novel demands, make
decisions in the face of uncertainty, and cope with unexpected
challenges [20]. At the same time, employees are increasingly
expected to switch seamlessly between different job roles,
tasks, organizations, and even occupations [21]. To ensure
sustained firm performance, organizations need a workforce
with the necessary capacities to efficiently deal with ongoing
transformation [22]. For this reason, adaptability and flexibility
have been widely acknowledged as key transversal skills that
play a vital role in the long-term success of employees and, in
turn, organizations [18][23]. To keep up with the demands of
today’s dynamic and diverse workplaces, personnel selection
researchers and practitioners need to reconsider what and how
to assess in the 21st century [24]. In other words, as working
conditions become more and more dynamic and complex
nowadays, the ability to adapt thoughts and behaviors ac-
cording to changing context requirements becomes particularly
relevant for work success [19][25]. Whatever the context and
whatever the domain, cognitive flexibility can be defined as
the ability to adjust cognitive processing strategies in response
to new, changing, and unexpected circumstances, conditions
and situations [26]. It enables people to switch from one
activity to another, to consider multiple perspectives, to find
new solutions to a problem, and to face novel conditions in the
environment [19]. In contrast, individuals who are cognitively
inflexible, struggle to adapt their strategies when situations
change and, therefore, tend to get stuck in habitual patterns.
The ability to shift cognitive sets is a key property of efficient
executive functioning and has been found to be different from
cognitive abilities [25].
C. Gamification in personnel selection
Gamification is used as an umbrella term comprising a
variety of techniques inspired by research in game design and
generally refers to the integration of game design elements
into nongame contexts [27][28][29]. The primary idea is to
take advantage of the motivational nature of games to enhance
the effectiveness of existing methods. By tapping into people’s
natural desire for competition and achievement, gamification
promises to encourage participation, to increase productivity
and, thus, to improve the quality and quantity of outcomes
in any domain. Over the past few years, gamification has
been increasingly applied within a variety of areas, including
work, education, training, marketing, healthcare, wellness, and
sustainability [5][30].
More recently, researchers and practitioners within the field
of human resource management and organizational psychology
have recognized gamification as a promising tool to improve
recruitment and personnel selection. The central goal of using
gamification within this context is to make the selection
procedure more enjoyable while increasing the quality of
measurement at the same time [30]. Nevertheless, if the use
of gamified versions of the WCST is becoming more common
for patients (e.g., [31][32]), we found only one gamified
sorting test for personnel selection created by [27]. During
the game, the participant/player is asked to imagine to be
a fictive employee of a marketing agency and s/he is asked
to implement a new marketing strategy to reduce costs and
improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns for consumer
products. As in the traditional version of the WCST, the correct
matching rule is not revealed to the subject. Interesting results
based on a sample of 180 participants in an online study have
been collected by [27].

technique (on the right side).
Figure 4. One of our participants while she is playing to Yuzu©, in front of
the eye-tracking system.
But, according to us, even if this gamified test is interesting,
this is not a relevant solution for personnel selection for several
reasons:
• All the tasks are based on language, i.e., the partici-
pants/players must read and understand instructions and
complex information to complete the task. One of the
main advantages of the WCST is that no language is
necessary to complete the test. In other words, with the
environment created by [27], language can be a serious
barrier.
• Because this digital environment has been created there
are 10 years ago, realism and quality of graphics are very
simple, no dynamic and not immersive.
• At the origin, the WCST has been elaborated to assess
cognitive flexibility, i.e., the ability to shift attention
between task sets, attributes of a stimulus, responses,
perspectives, or strategies whatever the context. In the
digital environment created by [27], technical skills and
declarative knowledge are crucial to solve the problems.
In other words, only technical and declarative knowledge,
which are assessed in their digital environment while the
non-technical skills and executive functions are assessed
by the WCST.
• Finally, data collected by the authors are only subjective
data obtained by an online study using different Likert-
scales. No objective data have been collected; Thus, its
prevents generalization of the results.
To answer to all these limits, a gamified sorting test has been
specifically created to assess cognitive flexibility for personnel
selection.
II. OUR PILOT STUDY : WORK IN PROGRESS
An innovative gamified sorting test has been created specifi-
cally for personnel selection and recruitment (https://yuzu.hr).
This gamified sorting test, called Yuzu©, has several compo-
nents centred on specific crucial soft-skills; for each of these
components, the player/user is asked to complete gamified
tasks where the protocol is very similar to paper-and-pencil
version of psychometrics tests such as WCST (e.g., Figure 3).
Since several months, an experiment is conducted (i) to
investigate the behaviours and performances of users/players
with Yuzu© and (ii) to compare their performances with the
traditional paper-and-pencil version of the WCST.
For our pilot study, twelve adults volunteers are asked
to play with Yuzu© and, two weeks later, to complete the
paper-and-pencil version of the WCST. In other words, each
participant is asked to complete the test for assessing cognitive
flexibility twice.
To collect gaze data, we used the research system Tobii Pro
Spectrum at speeds up to 200 Hz (Figure 4), to capture the
eye movements such as saccades, tremors, and micro-saccades.
This system can capture data in high sampling frequency,
while still allowing for natural head movement.
In our pilot study, the main indicators are:

• The percentage of errors (i.e., total number of errors
divided by number of trial administered).
• The percentage of preservative errors (i.e., number of
errors in which a subject continuously respond incorrectly
using the same pattern).
• Visual exploration on each card of the test (Figure 3).
Data are actually collected and the results will be presented
during the conference.
