Abstract— In the last decade, airships acquired a new role in the 
civil industry. With their low impact on the environment, high 
safety standards and high payload capabilities, this technology 
is developing to become a massive business. The many 
advantages in terms of transport and ecological impact 
(respecting the constraints given by the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change) result in defining 
a new type of resource that can be useful in many civil scenarios. 
The variety of operations that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
(UAVs) can pursue are explained. The conditions where UAVs 
can play a role as first aid providers in disaster scenarios are 
suggested. Autonomous airships are employed as UAVs for 
patrolling and disaster response scenarios. In distress situations, 
victims may require fundamental needs which would be 
delivered by the airship. The study on how the payload mass 
influences the decision of the parameter of the airship, that 
should be used for the rescue operations without interfering 
with the patrolling mission, is carried out. The presented 
simulation describes the sprint-and-drift strategy employed for 
optimal search. This article has the objective of presenting a 
practical disaster supply kit for people lost at sea on the 
supposed Ligurian coast, where the technology of autonomous 
airships can be greatly employed by the coast guard.  
Keywords - airship; patrolling; simulation; human rescue;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
UAVs come in different sizes and are used for different 
purposes. The larger drones are most often used for 
transporting large amounts of gases or heavy cargo, and the 
smaller ones are for patrolling or delivering a cargo of small 
weight and volume. In addition, UAVs can be used for 
inspection 
and 
repair 
tasks 
requiring 
autonomous 
manipulation [1] or simply for logistical operations, such as 
parcel delivery. Moreover, there is considerable literature on 
the use of UAVs for monitoring purposes, which can be as 
diverse as monitoring infrastructure, particularly pipelines [2]. 
Speaking of patrolling, we imagine a smart city, where 
security is provided by many smart devices interconnected 
following the Internet of Things paradigm. At present, we no 
longer see this as a distant future but rather as a need to 
accelerate this process. In our view, however, patrolling 
drones should be seen not only as airborne smart surveillance 
cameras but also as devices capable of patrolling and saving 
lives at the same time.  
In this paper, we propose the concept of a drone carrying 
a safety payload (kit). This will be carried by an autonomous 
vehicle (an airship) which would be patrolling the coastal area 
of the Ligurian sea. During the patrolling operation, when an 
airship notices that a situation requiring first aid is happening, 
then the airship will deliver the disaster supply kit, send a 
distress signal to the coast guard and then go back to its 
patrolling operations. 
Our article consists of the following parts. Section 2 
describes the state of the art and shows the most relevant 
articles in a literature review on the topic. Section 3 describes 
the different types of safety kits depending on the scenario in 
which a person is in danger and presents the most versatile 
option. In Section 4, we calculate the necessary payload 
capacity of the drone, which will allow it to "float" with the 
necessary equipment and safety kit on board. Also, in this 
Section, we give the corresponding dimensions of the drone, 
which allow it to stay "afloat" for 3-5 days and work in 
accelerated mode with high-frequency video and information 
transfer for 30 minutes. We also describe a system that allows 
us to find the drone in the future when it is no longer helpful 
to a person in danger by using the navigation system [3]. In 
Section 5, we introduce the possible application of airships for 
different types of missions. In Section 6 we present the results 
of our calculations and describe a human rescue scenario by 
an operator using a drone. Section 7 is dedicated to the 
presentation of the simulation based on the assumptions of a 
real-life scenario. Finally, in Section 8, the conclusions for this 
work are given and inputs for future research are presented.

II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW AND THE STATE OF ART 
By the term patrolling, we understand the movement over 
the territory at regular intervals to protect or monitor it. To 
patrol the Ligurian coast, we consider an airship as one of the 
safest means of transportation capable of "floating" over any 
territory, carrying a payload in the form of a safety kit, 
communication systems, and propulsion system. The airship 
can be equipped with state-of-the-art devices with extremely 
high resolution. These are ideal for accessing hard-to-reach 
areas or operating in adverse conditions that can be lethal to 
human operators. The implementation of airships with 
modern technology can be helpful in different critical 
scenarios, for example, support for emergency responders in 
hazardous situations. Their employment would provide 
unique viewing angles unavailable when employing manned 
aircraft, with also the advantage of being cost-effective. 
In the scientific literature, airships are referred to under 
various acronyms, such as UAV, Unmanned Aerial System 
(UAS), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), or Remotely 
Operated Aircraft (ROA). They have been considered 
especially as mobile measurement/utilization platforms (i.e., 
platforms for delivering an increasingly wide range of sensors 
and actuators). This work aims to develop a design of a 
disaster supply kit that would have to be delivered to an 
incident location. This kit would be delivered by an 
autonomous airship that will understand the emergency 
through a learning algorithm. After understanding that the 
situation requires the delivery of the disaster supply kit, the 
airship will deliver the kit, send an initial distress signal to the 
coast guard, and then will go back to the previous mission (in 
our scenario, a patrolling of the coast operation). 
Capitta et al. [4] considered structural (stress and 
deformation) and technical (propulsion and structural) 
characteristics during their analysis. This work is of interest to 
us for the general calculation of a prototype of a smaller scale 
(7.5 m long) unmanned airship capable of transporting natural 
gas contained in sealed bags between two predetermined 
departure and arrival stations following ENAC (Ente 
Nazionale Per L'Aviazione Civile) rules.  
Today, we can use helicopters and airplanes over 
territories for patrolling. However, they have disadvantages, 
such as high costs, dependence on pilots, and relying on 
operators for image transmission, while their efficiency is 
limited.  
The decision to patrol using drones is also supported by 
the safety of operators and the lack of the need for more 
rescuers.  
Ferrara et al. [5] examine the use of hybrid UAVs to detect 
illegal dumping using two or more geophysical methods. The 
advantages of aerial platforms include:  
• 
increased visual field, which allows quick patrolling 
of large areas; 
• 
the ability to reach otherwise inaccessible areas; 
• 
the steepness of the investigated matrix, quickly 
displaying the extent of the phenomena under study; 
• 
the safety of the operator, who does not need to put 
himself at immediate risk. 
 
Bigazzi et al. [6] developed and implemented solutions for 
the precise maneuvering of small autonomous (e.g. 350 class) 
drones based on intelligent modifications of low-cost mass-
market technologies. On the positive side, the patrol 
autonomy is provided by a cyber-pilot, which allows moving 
along a fixed trajectory. As a solution, it is possible to single 
out the disadvantage that the considered class of vehicles has 
low payload capacity, and only a limited number of sensors 
and computing devices can be installed onboard. 
Di Paola et al. [7] presented the implementation and 
integration of several autonomous navigation and surveillance 
functions on a multi-sensor mobile robot for terrain 
monitoring tasks. The research is of interest to us in the use of 
computer vision. Laser, Radio Frequency Identification 
(RFID), and computer vision data are used for mapping tasks. 
However, one of the limitations of the presented system, as 
noted by the authors themselves, is that the detection of 
objects and people is done in predefined target positions, 
where the robot stops and remains stationary for data 
processing. 
Di Fava et al. [8] propose a vision-based approach for 
mobile robot autonomous navigation as suitable for patrolling 
indoor and outdoor areas. The proposed architecture consists 
of a high-level (deliberative) and a low-level part (reactive). 
The use of visual tools supports the deliberative part: one to 
determine the road (path) that the robot must follow to 
navigate the patrolled areas, and the other to detect moving 
objects/people. Outdoor localization is accomplished by 
updating odometry via Global Positioning System (GPS) and 
compass, processed with an advanced Kalman filter. The 
deliberative part uses vision tools to provide the information 
needed for the two behaviors of the reactive part. The robot's 
vision is used to find road edges during external navigation, 
both on well-defined paths and on roads without clear 
markings (such as city parks). The algorithm used is a 
modified version of Supervised Classification Applied to 
Road Following (SCARF). SCARF is a color vision system 
that recognizes complex roads and intersections. It recognizes 
roads with uneven surfaces and edges in complex shadow 
conditions without lane markings. The work uses computer 
vision tools based on RGB image information, so this 
approach works in daylight conditions, which is a significant 
disadvantage to patrolling the area in an emergency or when 
it is necessary to rescue people. 
Lee et al. [9] proposed an autonomous indoor patrol and 
surveillance system using drones. The system consists of six 
components: (1) a low-cost vision-based UAV position 
estimation system, (2) a vision-based condition estimation 
system, (3) a UAV patrol route planning system, (4) a UAV 
control system at desired path points, (5) a hand-held joystick 
control system, and (6) a priority hierarchy assignment system 
for multiple robot control inputs. Real-time images from the 
UAV camera are transmitted to the office for observation by 
security personnel. If suspicious people or potential crimes are 
detected, management can override the autonomous control of 
the UAV to track the criminal using the remote control 
joystick. The results obtained by the authors have good 
accuracy, but the drawback for us is the need for the operator 
to be present at all times during patrols.

Hildmann and Kovacs [10] examined the use of UAVs as 
autonomous or semi-autonomous data collection platforms, 
often referred to as Mobile Sensing Platforms (MSPs) in smart 
cities and public safety, and the use of UAVs for civil security 
and disaster response. Indeed, UAVs are predicted to play an 
important role in smart cities and citywide IoT (Internet of 
Things) infrastructure [11]. Concerning safety issues in 
disaster response, the authors distinguish three categories 
(stages) of disaster response operations: 
1. Disaster preparedness: preempting actions that may 
cause or worsen the consequences of the disaster and 
implementing measures to mitigate (or completely prevent) 
the consequences of the event. 
2. Disaster assessment: evaluating the areas affected by a 
disaster, determining the extent to which they are affected, and 
summarizing this information in the form of reports. 
3. Disaster response and recovery: effectively respond and 
take action based on the above. 
For disaster management, Jo [12] proposes using UAVs 
controlled by humans but capable of performing autonomous 
functions. In addition, the authors propose the use of Wireless 
Sensor Networks (WSNs) and multiple UAVs as a combined 
system with minimal human involvement.  
Capitta et al. [13] describe the airships and the lifting 
process well, including formulas for calculation. 
Many studies are presenting the advantages and 
disadvantages of employing autonomous vehicles and robots. 
In the presented specific scenario, many things should be 
considered for future improvements of the system such as the 
ability to work at very low altitudes, autonomy, the ability to 
fly to hard-to-reach areas, and the ability to carry heavy 
payloads. 
III. 
RESCUE PROCESS 
The main scenario considered in our work is the event 
where an airship, as part of a fleet, will provide first aid to a 
victim spotted during the patrolling operations of the Ligurian 
coast. As said, the primary mission of the airship would be the 
patrolling of the coast following the hypothetical path of the 
coast guard, but in the air. The idea is that the airship will 
deploy a disaster supply kit once, during the patrolling 
operations, it would spot a distress situation. Being an 
autonomous entity, the airship will send a signal of the 
location of the victim, deliver the supply kit by identifying the 
region around the victim, and then will go back to its 
reconnaissance duties. The airship should gently deliver the 
supply kit by deploying it with nylon cables (not dangerous 
for the victim in case of wind) until the touchdown on the sea 
surface. The basic supply kit provides the victims with what 
we studied to be the fundamental needs for a distress situation. 
The scenario proposed for the employment of such a kit is 
one of the people lost at sea. This does not mean that it is the 
only scenario in which such technology can be employed. A 
similar analysis would be possible to be carried out in the 
situation of people lost in the mountains or the desert, but, 
given the location of our study (the Ligurian coast), we did not 
take into consideration the application in other scenarios. 
Within the scenario in which the airship would be used as a 
means for reconnaissance and patrolling port areas, we can 
give a brief description of what a grab bag would contain: a 
hypothetical liferaft with a liferaft manual and survival 
instructions; water supply and, eventually, a device to turn salt 
water into drinkable water; food supplies; eventually a 
battery-powered radio with an eventual dynamo (a hand-crank 
design can be helpful); a waterproof torch; a first-aid kit; a 
whistle; a floating knife; a pair of oars; a dust mask (this in the 
scenario in which the area contains hazardous materials in the 
air); items for personal sanitation; wrench or pliers for 
emergencies in case of failure of the boat; nautical charts of 
the local area; a locator beacon; red hand flares; eventually, 
parachute rockets; an emergency cellphone with a backup 
battery; a rescue quoit. 
IV. 
CALCULATING THE PAYLOAD OF THE UAV 
As we have already covered in our previous study [14], we 
have the final goal of designing an airship that would carry out 
several operations, including reconnaissance and patrolling. 
Since airships are lighter-than-air vehicles, we have to 
determine the payload value that we intend to load. Therefore, 
we decided to start from this analysis to obtain the most 
efficient model in terms of cost and design.  
Following the constraints given by ISO 9650-2 [15], we 
can think about a scenario where the airship will deploy a 
disaster supply kit for a maximum of 4 people. The liferafts 
described by the ISO 9650-3 are standardized for four people, 
each weighing 75 kg. Each passenger will have 0.250 m2 of 
space, and the liferaft must be manually deployed if the 
survivors are on a drifting boat. From what we could study, 
there are already projects that can provide liferafts. Two are 
the configuration of storage that can be thought of as a suitcase 
or in a container. Every configuration must be waterproof and 
be buoyant. From a practical point of view, the configuration 
we can be interested in is the suitcase one, to minimize the 
weight. To have a not too heavy payload that may become a 
hazard for the victims, we think it is best to think about 
installing a liferaft of a second specialized airship to not have 
too heavyweight (only the liferaft would be about 30 kg) for 
the reconnaissance airship. 
Essential to people lost at sea is water. We cannot know 
how long the victim has been lost at sea, but one of the first 
concerns is to ensure the hydration of the person. We can 
supply the disaster supply kit with a container of 2 liters of 
drinkable water, in a scenario where two people are lost at sea. 
Supposing that a person should drink 2 liters of water a day, 
we can suppose that for near-coast operations, 2 liters would 
be enough for such a disaster supply kit. Another option is to 
supply the kit with less water and add a convertible for turning 
salt water into drinkable water (for example, the device 
described in [16]). A physical device would be the best option 
given the emergency conditions. By looking at different 
devices on the web, we considered a technology that: can 
provide at least 4 liters of water per hour through Reverse 
Osmosis Membranes and human power as an energy source 
and weighs around 2.5 kg [17].  
As for food supplies, we can equate the disaster supply kit 
with a vegetarian food supply for one day, always with the 
idea of near-coast operations. The vegetarian choice is to 
provide help to the majority of the cases (thinking that non-

vegetarians can comply with the situation until rescued). 
Therefore, we consider that emergency food supplies should 
be around 0.5 kg for a maximum of two victims for a time 
span of 12 to 24 hours.  
For the waterproof torch, we can think about rechargeable 
scuba diving torches (and so we will equip the kit with a 
double pair of batteries), ensuring a wide light beam and a 
long burning time. These torches usually have about 2000 
lumen output, a depth rated about 150 meters but can be pretty 
heavy, up to 600 grams.  
Marine First Aid Kits are essential if it is necessary to 
carry on first aid operations. As we can find on the Internet, a 
standard kit contains: 
• 
A variety of adhesive bandages 
• 
Antiseptic wipes to clean wounds 
• 
Gauze pads 
• 
Adhesive tape 
• 
First aid cream 
• 
Aspirin 
• 
Sting relief wipes 
• 
Cold packs 
• 
Scissors 
We suppose that the kit would weigh about 1 kg. 
An emergency marine whistle of bright color can be highly 
effective for location. However, we suppose it will not be 
more than 50 grams. 
A floating knife made of floating materials (like the handle 
in cork) can be strongly effective in an emergency. These 
types of knives can weigh about 100 grams.  
Dust masks can be reliable items for victims in hazardous 
areas. Thinking of equipping the kit with 2 FFP3 2505 masks, 
it would come to about 50 grams. 
When lost at sea, the victim may need to clean 
himself/herself and have bags where to store items and trash 
garbage. We think that considering 300 grams for personal 
sanitation supplies should be enough. 
In case of a boat emergency, it may be necessary to have 
additional tools. We think that special tools made from light 
materials may come to be helpful. We think that, in general, 
the tools should weigh a maximum of 400 grams. 
It may be necessary to have nautical charts of the local area 
to give the victim an idea of where he/she is. We think that 
100 grams maximum should be a sufficient weight. 
The hand flares must be of a design that would occupy the 
minimum volume in terms of space but have the maximum 
efficiency. They must be used both during the night and 
during the day. Considering what would be available on the 
market, we can say that the RED hand flare from IKAROS 
can be an optimal solution. They have a luminosity intensity 
of 15000 cd with a possible burning duration of more than a 
minute. All this is enclosed in a small volume of 243x30 mm 
and weighs 225g. Although it is suggested not to look directly 
at the flame for safety reasons, it is necessary to hold it 
downwind and possibly out of the liferaft to avoid flares 
dropping on the deck [18].  
We suppose that parachute rockets, for how much they are 
an essential item for search and rescue operations, may not be 
needed even in case of rescue operations during the night. In 
this case, we would consider the airships equipped with night 
vision sensors to facilitate rescue operations. 
It can be necessary to recover other victims at sea, or it 
may be needed to have rope. This is why a rescue quoit is a 
necessary item in a disaster supply kit. This item has a length 
of 30 meters, a width of 5 mm floating polyline, and a weight 
of 900 grams.

DELIVERING THE SPARE PARTS 
Airships can carry out a multitude of operations including 
support to marine platforms and ships. Airships can, for 
example, deliver different types of tools or equipment to 
infrastructures that are not easily reachable by humans. 
Airships, as we mentioned above, have great advantages from 
an ecological point of view and can be integrated with modern 
technology to develop UAVs able to autonomously carry on 
the necessary operations. 
Another studied scenario is a bust pipe of an oil production 
infrastructure or the failure of components of a cargo ship. In 
these types of scenarios, a signal would communicate to the 
central hub the necessity for spare parts. These will be then 
delivered to the location point. We suppose that in the future, 
with the help of similar calculations as we will propose after, 
the computer will be able to decide which airship to use 
depending on the requested payload. 
VI. 
DEFINITION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UAV 
As we well know, the principle behind the physics of an 
airship is Archimedes' principle. The airship envelope is filled 
with a lifting gas (hydrogen, helium), providing the body with 
the necessary lifting force. The carrying capacity of the airship 
will be proportional to the internal volume of the envelope, 
taking into account the mass of the structure. 
Calculating the payload, we think we can round the result 
to 11 kg thinking of wrapping the disaster supply kit in a 
lightweight, impact-resistant casing and considering the 
eventual weight of the equipment for the surveillance and 
patrolling operations. 
A blimp can be assumed to be submerged in a fluid, air. 
This will be the fluid providing the lift for the airship. This

PESARO 2022 : The Twelfth International Conference on Performance, Safety and Robustness in Complex Systems and Applications

means that the volume of the airship has to be equal to the 
volume of the displaced fluid. 
For buoyancy: 
𝐵 = 𝜌! ∙ 𝑉! ∙ 𝑔 
 
 
(1) 
Where f indicates our fluid, the air. Another note is that 𝑉! 
is the same volume as the airship 
𝑉! = 𝑉"#$%&#' 
 
 
(2) 
The buoyancy is pushing up in the airship but pulling 
down as if we want to hang something from the airship. We 
want to find this mass, the one that we want to lift. Moreover, 
we have to consider the mass of the gas that is filling the 
airship and pulling the mass and the mass of the airship itself. 
The final equation for the buoyancy will be: 
𝜌! ∙ 𝑉! ∙ 𝑔 − 𝑚("% ∙ 𝑔 − 𝑚'")*+", ∙ 𝑔 − 𝑚"#$%&#' ∙ 𝑔 = 0 (3) 
We have to know the air density in the scenario that we 
want to present and decide which gas we will use as lifting 
gas. Then, knowing the volume of the envelope, we can obtain 
the mass of the lifting gas by knowing its density. 
What is unknown are the 𝑉! and the 𝑚"#$%&#'. However, 
this last one can be calculated if put in relationship with the 
volume of the envelope [19]. In particular, considering the 
available resources on the market and making assumptions to 
simplify the problem slightly, we can consider the material of 
the envelope of mylar, a polyester, whose studied optimal 
thickness can be 1.5 mm (ℎ-./). Considering then the density 
of the material of 1390 kg/m3, we can write: 
𝑚"#$%&#' = 𝑉-./ ∙ 𝜌-./-*+'-  
 
(4) 
And the final equation will be: 
𝜌! ∙ 𝑉! − 𝜌( ∙ 𝑉! − 𝑚'")*+", − 𝑉-./ ∙ 𝜌-./-*+'- = 0 (5) 
With 
𝑉-./ = 𝐴-./ ∙ ℎ-./ 
 
 
(6) 
Leaving us with: 
𝑉! =
0!"#$%"&12'()∙&'()∙4'()'$%!'
4*54+
  
 
(7) 
For safety reasons, we will choose helium as lifting gas 
(𝜌( = 0.1785 𝑘𝑔/𝑚6). Because we are designing an object 
that would have to fly above the sea surface, we are not 
expecting that it will fly at high altitudes; this is to avoid the 
negative effects of the wind. Given this statement and 
following the altitude-density graphs, we can consider the 
reference density of air between 1.2 𝑘𝑔/𝑚6 and 1 𝑘𝑔/𝑚6. 
For our scenario, let’s consider a density of 1.1 𝑘𝑔/𝑚6. 
Given the area of the prolate spheroid (the shape we are 
assuming resembles the best of an airship): 
𝐴-./ = 2𝜋𝑎7 + 2𝜋
"8
- arcsin (𝑒) 
 
(8) 
Where 𝑎 is the minor semi-axis, 𝑐 the major semi-axis, and 
𝑒 the eccentricity (given by 𝑒 = B1 −
",
8, in the case a<c), the 
value of 𝑉!can be described by the function: 
𝑉!(𝑎, 𝑐) = 11.93 + 0.19 ∙ F2𝜋𝑎7 + 2𝜋
"8
- arcsin(𝑒)G (9) 
From the function, we can see how the results are strictly 
dependent on ℎ-./. 
It has been researched that several technologies allow us 
to employ thicknesses up to 125 microns (when employing 
polyurethane, for example). This would allow us to have 
better results and arrive to compare with already existing 
technologies that can be employed. A configuration in which 
𝑎 = 1,1 𝑚 and 𝑐 = 6 𝑚 would give us the following results: 
𝐴-./ = 59,379 𝑚7 
𝑉! = 23.178 𝑚6 
These results seem to be acceptable and would make us 
think about the necessity of developing a new configuration 
or employing designs already available on the market. But this 
decision would be strictly connected to the economic 
resources available in the future. 
VII. SIMULATION MODEL 
To understand the movement of patrolling airships, we set 
the parameters describing the Ligurian coast. We simulated 
that during the patrolling operations, the airships would 
receive a distress signal alerting that a victim is lost at sea. 
This, in real life, would happen while the airship is at a random 
point in the patrolling area. The airship, as part of a fleet, will 
start the search for the victim by following a sprint-and-drift 
strategy to save energy [14, 20]. The idea behind this concept 
states that the vehicle will sprint in a direction for a designated 
time and then drift with the wind employing only minimal 
energy for correction actions. Figure 1 shows the results of 
this simulation. 
 
Figure 1.  Sprint-and-drift patrolling strategy. ActualX describes the sprint 
phase and ActualY describes the drift phase. 
We start by setting the limits of the patrolling area for each 
airship of the fleet. Being the fleet of airships interconnected, 
we would be able to assign each of them to a specific area. 
The random starting point of our simulation is {9,178; 5,475} 
in nautical miles (nmi), within the patrolling area of one of the 
airships. The concept is that once the airships receive the 
distress signal, they will start the search for the victim in an 
area wider than the patrolling one. As we can see from the 
graph, the sprint-and-drift patrolling strategy allows covering 
a wide area, but it requires more than one airship for the search 
because we are not covering all. Because different airships are 
initially assigned to different initial patrolling areas, we can 
suppose that the assumption of using a fleet of autonomous 
airships would bring the desired result of locating the victim.

VIII. CONCLUSION 
In the past years, airships resulted to be an emerging 
business. The many advantages in terms of transport and 
ecological impact (respecting the constraints given by the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) 
result in defining a new type of resource that can be useful in 
many civil scenarios. 
The presented work described the scenario of delivering a 
disaster supply kit to people lost at sea. The UAV intended is 
thought of as part of a fleet carrying out surveillance and 
reconnaissance operations on the Ligurian coast. During the 
patrolling operations, the airship would detect the victims, 
send the signal to the port authorities with the coordinates of 
the event and deliver them the disaster supply kit. The airship 
will then go back to its mission. In the case of far-from-coast 
reconnaissance, we are supposing that the airship will send a 
signal to both the port authorities and the airship carrying the 
emergency liferaft. This scenario will be studied further in 
future research. 
The description of the content of the disaster supply kit is 
quite exhaustive and we considered it the first step for the 
determination of the characteristics of the airship. Given the 
weight of the payload, consisting of the disaster supply kit and 
the instrumentation, we were able to develop a preliminary 
calculation on how to determine the dimensions of the semi-
axes of the needed airship. 
The presented simulation showed the hypothetical pattern 
of search for victims lost at sea. Future studies will be aimed 
at calculating different searching patterns to optimize the time, 
the costs, and the path to reach the victims' location. Given the 
results, we are confident that this article represents the first 
step of many future projects and applications of this 
technology in the emergency and safety fields.
