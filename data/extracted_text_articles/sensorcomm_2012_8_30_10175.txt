Abstract— In this study, we verified the applicability of the 
energy harvesting technology to the railroad system for real-
time wireless sensor networks. The origin of the power for this 
technology is found in the concept of energy harvesting, which 
resources thermal deviation occurring when a train runs. For 
this, we measured the temperature generated on the axle box 
bearing from the train’s running environment by using a high-
speed train, analyzed the thermal deviation and calculated the 
estimated energy harvesting power for the sensor network of 
the railroad system. The thermal deviation occurred in the axle 
box bearing when a train runs; the deviation was 
approximately 12.97 ∼ 14.68 ℃ . We calculated in the 
assumption of the basic thermo element of the axle box bearing 
area, which is the area of the temperature sensor attached on 
the axle box bearing. Theoretically, the energy harvesting 
power of 63.8mW can be obtained and thus by using the 
energy harvesting power it will be possible to operate the 
wireless sensor network for railroad monitoring.

 INTRODUCTION 
With regards to railroads, accelerating the speed of the 
system always demands absolute development in reliability 
and safety of passengers and trains, and the increase in 
system maintenance cost has become another problem.  Thus, 
it is necessary to develop a new technology of maintenance 
for fulfilling both reliability and safety, and maintenance cost 
in system speed acceleration. In order to accomplish this, a 
real-time sensor network system must be established.  
Usually, a sensor network system is needed for prevention 
and response before a dangerous situation occurs, by 
detecting abnormal conditions in the corresponding system 
during the operation.  It is also used for constant monitoring 
to analyze the information for possible understanding of the 
situation. 
However, present monitoring systems in railroad systems 
almost exclusively use wired sensor networks, and recently, 
the demand for monitoring systems with wireless sensor 
networks has expanded in accordance with their easy 
installation in places that had previously been considered 
difficult to access and install in.  Specifically, when a 
wireless sensor network is applied to the railroad monitoring 
system, it is possible for the real time condition based-
maintenance, differentiated from the existing method used 
for scheduled maintenance, and by this, the reliability and 
safety of maintenance is increased [1].  Though, in the case 
of a wireless sensor network with easy installation, it is 
necessary to solve the problem of power supply for using it 
in a monitoring system.  This is because the regular changing 
of batteries is necessary for additional maintenance. 
Therefore, for the wireless sensor network in a railroad 
system, it is necessary to develop an ‘Energy Harvesting’ 
technology in order to be maintenance-free from the 
changing of batteries. It is also environment-friendly and 
semi-permanent [2]-[4]. 
Therefore, in this study, we verified the applicability of 
the energy harvesting technology to the railroad system for 
real-time wireless sensor networks. The origin of the power 
for this technology is found in the concept of energy 
harvesting, which resources thermal deviation occurring 
when a train runs. For this, we measured the temperature 
generated on the axle box bearing from the train’s running 
environment by using a high-speed train, analyzed the 
thermal deviation and calculated the estimated energy 
harvesting power for the sensor network of the railroad 
system.

THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE OF AXLE BOX BEARING 
DURING THE OPERATION 
A. The expriments 
In this study, surrounding energy generated at the normal 
train operation environment was measured using high speed 
rail train in operation and to identify the applicability of the 
energy harvesting, the energy source was measured with the 
train running 586.2km (return way from Seoul to East-Daegu) 
at maximum operating speed 300km/h. And to measure the 
temperature variation of the heat sources generated during 
train operation at 300km/h, temperature sensor (Model: 
TC1047AVNB, 2.64mm x 3.05mm x 1.02mm, temperature-
ranges of -40℃ ~125℃) was installed on axle bearing which 
is one of the part on which the temperature varies 
significantly with Bluetooth module as shown in Fig 1 and 
the temperature variation of axle bearing was measured on a 
real-time basis using wireless sensor.

B. The result of temperature change of axle box bearing  
We analyzed the temperature of the axle box bearing in a 
300km/h maximum speed operation train.  As a result, as 
shown in Fig. 3, the temperature of the axle box bearing 
during the operation repeats up and down in accordance with 
the surroundings; tunnel, bridge, speed and stations, etc.  If 
we look closely at Fig. 2, the temperature of the axle box 
bearing starts with a temperature similar with the outside air 
temperature, but increases as the train runs.  The deviation 
between outer air and axle box bearing is 15∼20℃ in the 
summer.  Especially, the temperature tends to decrease when 
the train  passes tunnels and each sensor’s temperature 
change occurs by the location of the sensor on the same axle 
box bearing, as in Fig. 3, which depends on the direction of 
operation.  The reason is the air-cooling effect taking place 
during the train operation, so the temperature of No. 1 and 
No. 2 sensors is lower than the temperature of No. 3 and No. 
4.  Also, regarding the temperature between the axle box 
bearing and outside air, we can use this thermal deviation to 
make energy harvesting possible if a thermo element is 
applied as the power. 
In addition, the tunnel section of Fig. 2, the temperature 
changed very rapidly; the train enters the tunnel, the 
temperature of the axle box bearing descends, and after the 
train passed the tunnel, it ascends again.  This is because of 
the air-cooling effect from the outside air temperature of 
going in and out of the tunnel.  The outside air temperature 
in the tunnel is lower than the outside air temperature 
outside of the tunnel in the summer.  Also, the average 
temperature data from the axle box bearing of high-speed 
trains is stated in Table 1.  The outside air temperature was 
measured approximately 28℃∼30℃ and the average 
thermal deviation (ΔT) was measured approximately 
12.97℃∼14.68℃.

APPLICABILITY OF ENERGY HARVESTING 
TECHNOLOGY FOR THE SENSOR NETWORK OF RAILROAD 
SYSTEM BY THERMAL DEVIATION 
When looking at the results of the average temperature 
on the axle box bearing, we notice that the highest 
temperature was 44.68℃.  Thus, if we suppose the outside 
air temperature is fixed at 30 ℃ , the biggest thermal 
deviation obtainable from the axle box bearing is 14.68℃; 
generally, the thermo element is known to properly gain 
efficiency when the temperature deviation between high and 
low temperature parts is over 300℃ [5]. However, if the 
thermo element form is made as thin as a form of Thin-Film,

it is not easy to obtain electricity and efficiency in small 
temperature deviation [6]-[8].  Of course, in this case, the 
Thin-Film thermo element has the most optimum quality 
index in corresponding temperature and should be chosen.  
As you can see in Fig. 4, when the thermal deviation is 
14.68 ℃ , n-Type should be selected as
Bi2Te3
(Bismuth 
Telluride) and p-Type as 
Sb2Te3
 (Antimony Telluride) for 
Figure-of-merit theoretically [6].  For the normalization of 
obtainable power by thermal deviation occurring in the axle 
bearing, we calculated in the assumption of the most basic 
thermo element, a single rectangular Thin-Film thermo 
element of 4 ㎠ area, 1 ㎝ thickness. Also, the axle box 
bearing symmetry and the thermal deviation in the axle box 
bearing is relatively even in all locations. Therefore, the 
maximum energy harvesting power obtainable by using 
average temperature measured in the 4th sensor was 1.6mW 
as shown in Fig. 5 and the power estimated through ΔT is 
shown in below Table 2. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Estimated energy harvesting energy on the axle box bearing 
We estimate the energy harvester need to generate more 
than 20mW for self powered (= energy harvesting) wireless 
on-board condition monitoring system. As shown in Fig. 6, 
sensor consumes very small energy, 15uW ~1mW, but 
wireless data transmit requires 10mW~15mW energy, even 
Zigbee protocol [9]. 
 
Figure 6.  Required energy for wireless monioring 
Regarding the larger sized thermo element of the axle 
box bearing area, the size is Ø= 25.4 ㎝, width= 2 ㎝, 
thickness=1 ㎝, which is the area of the temperature sensor 
attached on the axle box bearing. Theoretically, the energy 
harvesting power of 63.8mW can be obtained; so if more 
thermo elements are attached on the axle box bearings of 
high-speed trains though optimum design, hundreds mW of 
electric power can be obtained, and thus by using the energy 
harvesting power it will be possible to operate the wireless 
sensor network for railroad monitoring. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This study was to confirm the applicability of energy 
harvesting technology, with new energy resources from the 
environment, for wireless sensor networks in railroad 
systems. We measured the temperature and thermal 
deviation during high-speed train operation, and estimated 
the energy harvesting power by thermal deviation on the 
axle  box  bearing.  
1) The thermal deviation occurred in the axle box 
bearing when a train runs; the deviation was approximately 
12.97∼14.68°C 
2)  As a result of calculating the energy harvesting 
power by the thermal deviation, about 1.6mW power was 
obtainable in the rectangular thin film thermo element on 
the axle box bearing during the operation:  4 ㎠ area, 1 ㎝ 
height. 
3)  Concerning the larger sized thermo element of the 
axle box bearing area, the size is  Ø= 25.4 ㎝, width= 2 ㎝, 
thickness=1 ㎝, which is the area of the temperature sensor 
attached on the axle box bearing. Theoretically, the energy 
harvesting power of 63.8mW can be obtained; so if more 
thermo elements are attached on the axle box bearings of 
high-speed trains though optimum design, hundreds of mW 
of electric power can be obtained, and thus by using the 
energy harvesting power it will be possible to operate the 
wireless sensor network for railroad monitoring.
