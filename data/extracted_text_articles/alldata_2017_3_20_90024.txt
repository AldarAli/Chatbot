INTRODUCTION
Time is an essential dimension to many domain-specific
systems such as financial and medical data analysis.
However, temporal data mining is concerned with such
analysis in the case of ordered data records with temporal
interdependencies. During the last decade, many interesting
techniques of temporal data mining were proposed and
shown to be useful in many applications areas. Since
temporal data mining brings together techniques from
different fields, such as statistics, machine learning and
databases, the literature is scattered among many different
sources.
Temporal data mining is commonly concerned with data
mining of large sequential datasets that have been ordered
chronologically with respect to some index. For example,
time series constitute a popular class of sequential data,
where records are indexed by time. Other examples of
sequential data could be text, gene sequences, protein
sequences, lists of moves in a chess game, etc. Here,
although there is no notion of time as such, the ordering
among the records is very important and is central to the data
description and modeling.
Consider the temporal relation among three customers
whose corresponding transaction sequences are as follows:
Cust. 1. [{X1 X2 },{X3 X1 X4 },{X2 X5}]
Cust. 2. [{X5 }, {X1 X2}]
Cust. 3. [{X1 },{X1 X2 X5 X6 }]
where {Xi} represents the items bought in a single
transaction. For instance, customer 1 made 3 visits to the
market. In her first visit, she bought 2 items {X1 X2}. In her
second and third visits, she bought 3 items {X3 X1 X4} and 2
items, {X2 X5} respectively. Temporal patterns are frequent
sequences of actions that could be useful for analyzing data
and predicting futures. In the above example, we can extract
relations such as the sequence [{X5 }, {X1 X2}] contained in
[{X1 X2 },{X3 X1 X4 },{X2 X5 } ] but not in [{X1 },{X1 X2
X5 X6 }].
This paper presents an efficient rule-based classification
approach, called TLEX, for categorizing temporal data. The
contributions of this research are: 1) formulating semantic
temporal patterns as a basic classification features, and 2)
introducing an induction technique to discriminate semantic
temporal patterns.
TLEX framework relies on the formal definition of
ROLEX-SP that has been introduced by M. AL Zamil and A.
Can [1] to classify medical knowledge using a dedicated
rule-based induction and learning techniques to come with
efficient classification of domain knowledge. ROLEX-SP
automates the induction and the learning processes by
extracting textual patterns and building a specialized form of
association rules. Such technique handles the problems of
multiclass classification and feature imbalance problems.
To illustrate, consider the example of raining phenomena.
A person might hear the thunder during and after its
occurrence. Duration represents the persistence of an event
over many time points. Also, rain and thunder might occur

concurrently without a particular order. Finally, some events
might intersect each other such as sun shining, raining and
rising of the rainbow.
Section II discusses the related work. Section III provides
background definitions of formalities that have been applied
in this work. Section IV defines the temporal model as well
as the form of the temporal pattern. Section V discusses the
methodology for creating our proposed classifier. Section VI
discusses the experiments and findings. Finally, Section VII
concludes with a brief discussion of findings.

RELATED WORK
Early works on mining temporal patterns rely on Apriori-
style approaches such as the algorithm in [2], in which a
breadth-first search strategy is applied to compute the
support of item sets. As this strategy is not efficient on large
datasets
in
terms
of
accuracy
[3],
recently
efficient
algorithms based on unsupervised elicitations of temporal
relations have been proposed for the purpose of enhancing
the performance of temporal classifiers. H-DFS [4] and
KarmaLego [5] are based on an enumeration tree structure to
classify
temporal
information.
The
implementation
of
enumerated
decision
trees
supports
the
accuracy
of
classification results in an unsupervised manner.
Winarko and Roddick [6] have introduced ARMADA,
which is an algorithm to discover interval time temporal
rules. Recent work in this field asserts that time-stamps
relationships such as the “during” relation could be more
useful than solid time interval. Unlike ARMADA association
rules, our work relies on discovering hybrid temporal rules
that could be represented using during relation. In [7],
TPrefixSpan has been introduced to apply prefix span
technique using interval boundaries pruning patterns. Also,
IEMiner [8] has implemented a prior based strategy with
counters
and
pruning
to
improve
the
accuracy
of
IEClassifier; that is used to classify temporal sequential
records.
Attempts have been made to construct temporal features
in order to construct association rules such as those discussed
in Bruno and Garza [9], Miao et al. [10], and Chiang et al.
[11]. In Bruno and Garza [9], association rules have been
developed to cope with outlier detection using functional
quasi dependency. The technique does not model time-delay
as a part of association rules. The technique in Bruno and
Garza [9] handled time-delay explicitly which affects the
overall performance as well as efficiency of the classification
process, which is not crucial in outlier detection task.
Chiang et al. [11] have proposed a mathematical model
to extract temporal patterns to track customer buying habits.
Our proposed methodology focuses on time intervals as well
as single point of time events. Similarly, our proposed
technique benefits from the formal definition in Chiang et al.
[11] in that we formulate the temporal patterns using similar
mathematical aspects. Zhang et al. [12] have proposed a
method to extract during temporal patterns DTP. DTP is a
special case of interval temporal patterns. Kong et al. [13]
have presented the notion of multi temporal patterns using
predicates: before, during, equal and overlap.
Temporal datasets dimensions are characterized as huge
ones.
Techniques
to
reduce
such
dimensionality
are
important to produce scalable temporal mining systems. The
proposed
technique
applied
methods
in
Stacey
and
McGregor [14] and Wang and Megalooikonomou [15] to
reduce the dimensionality of time series.

Instead of accuracy formula that has been applied in the
previous version of ROLEX-SP, the function support that
has been defined in [19, 20, 21] has been used to induce
positive and negative patterns as well. Given

EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS
During our experiment, the proposed technique has
been applied on a weather dataset. The dataset has been
collected from a weather station in Jordan in 2009. The
empirical
dataset
holds
14
attributes:
wind
direction,
average wind speed, maximum wind gust, average hourly
temperature, percentage relative humidity, global hourly
radiation, hourly sunshine duration, hourly precipitation
duration, hourly precipitation amount, horizontal visibility,
fog,
snow,
etc.
The
dataset
has
been
processed
to
discriminate and convert the records into temporal ones
consisting of event name, start time, end time, and state. The
F-measure achieved during experiments is 81% at minimum
support ranges up to 20% as shown in Figure 2
Figure 2 shows that the overall performance of our
proposed technique is directly affected by the number of
generated rules. Therefore, the higher the number of rules,
the better the performance achieved by TLEX.
Figure 3 shows that additional running time is required
while increasing the number of rules in our classifier. In
fact, the results showed that the required time increased
linearly as the number of rules in-creased.
Figure 4, on the other hand, shows that the time
required by processing events is much greater than the one
for events. However, a linear relation is clear between the
running time and the number of events.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a rule-based method for
categorizing temporal records. The contributions of this
research are 1) formulating semantic temporal patterns as a
basic classification features, and 2) introducing an induction
technique to discriminate semantic temporal patterns. We
performed experiment on a weather dataset in order to
evaluate the proposed method and compare our work with
well known algorithms in the literature. Specifically,
Temporal-ROLEX achieve significant enhancement using
sequential temporal pattern. On the other hand, Temporal-
ROLEX
achieves
average
performance
using
hybrid
temporal patterns.

Also, the improvement achieved by Temporal-ROLEX is
statistically significant. The use of syntactic patterns, both
positive
and
negative,
contributes
on
increasing
the
accuracy of Temporal-ROLEX over the other method.
In addition, we also provided a sensitivity analysis to the
performance of Temporal-ROLEX as a function to the
number of rules and the number of records in the training
set. The results indicated that Temporal-ROLEX was
positively affected by the number of rules. On the other
hand, our observations during experiments indicated that the
number of records in the training set does not affect the
overall performance of the learning process.
