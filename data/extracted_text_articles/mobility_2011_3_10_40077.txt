Abstract — The worldwide spread of mobile phones and its 
increasing trend makes them the main vehicle for mobile 
communications. Mobile Operators can provide valuable services 
to their clients by using context information to personalize 
multimedia content distribution. The knowledge of users’ 
situations shall guide applications to select the most helpful 
content in each specific instant. This paper proposes IMS (IP 
Multimedia Subsystem) as a context service enabler allowing 
Mobile Operators to offer more useful services to their clients by 
applying 
the 
Internet 
of 
Things 
vision 
into 
the 
telecommunications world.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
A core challenge to Mobile Operators is to afford clever 
services based on the user’s current situation in order to make 
them cheaper and useful. The mobile devices explosion and the 
wireless networks diffusion allow users to be always connected 
enabling a ubiquitous access. Furthermore, it is expectable that 
sensor networks technologies will be fast widened all over the 
world fostering the Internet of Things (IoT) accomplishment. 
The information gathered from these sensors networks can be 
treated as context information, which enables the usage of 
intelligent models that can be employed by context-aware 
services to improve their utility. Mobile Operators require an 
effective communication framework that allows context 
information to flow from their providers towards the context 
consumers making possible to get better services and 
personalized contents distribution. 
This paper devises IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) as a 
context service facilitator enabling Mobile Operators to provide 
valuable services to end-users. It is here proposed context as an 
IMS service that instead of delivering multimedia content 
makes available context information to context-aware services 
allowing Mobile Operators to offer the right content to the right 
client. 
The rest of the paper is as follows: in Section II the main 
motivations for context usage are referred; Section III presents 
the devised framework that allows Mobile Operators to use 
context information to provide useful services to their clients; 
in Section IV is introduced the procedures that enable the 
context exchange between interested entities by showing the 
proposed 
demonstration 
scenario. 
Finally, 
Section 
V 
summarizes the main conclusions. 
II. 
MOTIVATION 
A. Context in Mobile Services 
Context can be understood as sensed information that 
changes over time, which can be used by context-aware 
systems to improve their performance. Nowadays, Mobile 
Operators are already offering some context-aware services 
based on users’ location by selecting the content that best fits 
the user position. But Mobile Operators can go further since 
they are in a privileged position to collect information about 
their clients’ situation. They can bring together statistics on 
their clients most accessed web pages or their favorite 
programs and channels; they can even collect figures about 
their online shopping profile. Furthermore, following the IoT 
fashion, through the use of external sensoring, it is possible to 
collect extra context information, like noise, temperature or 
movement. All this information is critical to Mobile Operators 
since it allows them to offer useful services through optimized 
networks to end-users. Figure 1 presents possible sources of 
context information.

B. Service Scenario 
This is the raining season. A huge storm is flooding the 
regional 
roads 
letting 
the 
population 
out-of-the-way. 
Unhappily, there is often a lot of kills victims of these natural 
catastrophes and, most of them, are tourists caught napping in 
the storm. In order to reduce their impact, the Government is 
funding Mobile Operators to offer a service that streams videos 
indicating to each of their clients in critical situation the best 
way to reach a shelter having food and potable water. The 
name of the service is: Get safe. 
Mobile Operators using their native capabilities can 
imprecisely check their clients location based on their attached 
antennas.  If they are nearby a flooding area, Mobile Operators 
check which ones have on their terminals the Global 
Network

Positioning System (GPS) and try to immediately get the right 
users’ location in order to provide the most accurate location-
based helping video. Due to those users, Mobile Operators 
require context information and, consequently, they become 
context consumers of a context service that converts user 
geographic coordinates into user street location. The 
geographic coordinates are supplied to the Context Service by 
the context provider based on the clients GPS information. 
Furthermore, Mobile Operators makes even use on their clients 
profile in order to check their native language. 
Based on users’ location and using their specific language, 
Mobile Operators can offer understandable videos with clear 
indications about the way to reach a shelter saving hundreds of 
lives. 
C. Related Work 
The use of context in mobile networks is nowadays a key 
research topic in scientific community. Its usage in 
telecommunications systems allows the service personalization 
over optimized networks. 
The FP7 (Framework Program 7) SENSEI (Integrating the 
Physical with the Digital World of the Network of the Future) 
project aimed to provide the necessary network and 
information management services to enable consistent and 
accurate context information retrieval and interaction with the 
physical environment [1]. The work carried out in [2] has 
proposed a set of interfaces enabling Applications and Services 
to access real world information. 
PERSIST (Personal Self-Improving Smart Spaces) was a 
FP7 project intending to develop Personal Smart Spaces (PSS) 
that were able to learn and reason about users, their intentions, 
preferences and context [3]. The PSS was enabled to extend 
and enhance as the user meets other smart spaces. In [4] is 
presented the overall design of the main components 
supporting the operation of Personal Smart Spaces. 
The FP7 C-CAST (Context Casting) project aimed at 
evolving mobile multimedia multicasting to exploit the 
increasing integration of mobile devices with our everyday 
physical world and environment [5]. Furthermore, it has 
designed an innovative approach allowing personalized content 
delivery to multiple mobile users independently of the 
underlying networks. In [6] and [7] was defined an architecture 
to support a complete context management functionality along 
with service components like group management and content 
selection. The work carried out in [8] and [9] has defined a 
framework to collect sensor data, distribute context information 
and manage efficiently context aware multiparty data 
distribution. In [10] and [11] were developed a set of 
mechanisms for autonomous context driven content creation, 
adaptation and media delivery. 
The research presented in [12] demonstrates the usefulness 
of context-awareness usage to improve the interface between 
the user and the mobile devices. The context is derived from 
the fusion of multiple sensors. The article also proposes a 
hierarchically working model to structure the context concept. 
In [13] was proposed a layered conceptual architecture 
where the layers were increased with interpreting and 
reasoning functionalities, which allows the detection and the 
context usage. 
Another research has been carried out in [14] where a 
layered 
conceptual 
design 
framework 
was 
proposed 
highlighting the different elements common to most context-
aware architectures. 
The research done in [15] has studied the impact of context, 
sensors and wireless networks in the telecommunications field. 
Several scenarios were suggested stressing the possible 
synergies between the defined areas. 
In [16] is devised a convergent context-aware architecture 
where IMS is used to convey context information and to 
control MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service) 
and E-MBMS (Evolved MBMS) multimedia channels allowing 
Mobile Operators to easily offer innovative services over 
efficient networks. 
The work introduced in [17] exposes the benefits of using 
context information for the vertical handover decision 
procedures. It devises a context-aware information server 
skilled to manage dynamic information retrieved from both the 
network and the terminal side entities, which leads to an 
improved handover process.

IMS AS A CONTEXT FACILITATOR 
A. IMS Architecture 
3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) Release 5 has 
introduced IMS as an extension of the UMTS (Universal 
Mobile Telecommunication System) architecture [18]. It has 
added a set of new functions linked by new standardized 
interfaces. IMS uses the IETF (Internet Engineering Task 
Force) SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) in order to manage 
multimedia sessions [19]. It provides QoS (Quality of Service) 
by means of resource reservation and allows operators new 
charging schemes for multimedia sessions. Finally, IMS makes 
possible fast service deployment enabling more and better 
services to end customers. The IMS architecture, as defined by 
3GPP in [18], is presented in Figure 2.

B. Context as a Service 
Context is defined in [20] as the information employed to 
characterize the situation of entities. A situation is defined in 
[21] as the state of a context at a certain point in space at a 
certain point in time, identified by a name. A situation is even 
matched up to a snapshot taken by a camera where it captures 
the momentary profile of the context attributes. A service can 
be considered context-aware if it uses context information to 
adapt its behavior to optimally perform its tasks.  
Context-aware services require services that provide 
context-aware 
information. 
Consequently, 
context-aware 
services need context services to afford users’ situation 
information. A Context Service (CxS) can be defined as a 
service that makes available context information to context-
aware systems [16]. CxS uses context information provided by 
Context Producers (CxP) and presents users’ related situation 
to Context Consumers (CxC). So, CxSs gather context 
information from CxPs and make it available to CxCs.  
CxS can have different complexity behaviours. It can just 
bypass basic sensor information, such as the user location, or it 
can apply demanding algorithms based on mixed context 
sources in order to get more complex information such as 
users’ wishes or needs.  
CxS can collect context information from different sources.  
The information can then be filtered to select only the valid 
data. Additionally, fusion processes can be applied enabling the 
consistent values attainment through the integration of similar 
data sources. Aggregation mechanisms can run over 
heterogeneous sources of information to obtain higher level 
context data. As a final point, reasoning mechanisms allow 
CxS to wrap up users’ situation by applying logical rules over 
collected context information. 
CxC, CxS and CxP can exchange context information by 
request (where is the client now?), periodically, (where is the 
client in each 5 minutes?) or on an event-based (let me know 
when the client leaves the train station). The functional 
interaction can be seen in Figure 3.  
 
Figure 3.  CxC, CxS and CxP interactions 
C. Context as an IMS Service 
One of the main IMS advantages is the easy development 
of multimedia services. Following the same approach, IMS can 
be very useful as a context service facilitator enabling 
awareness in mobile services. This analogy is presented in 
Figure 4.  
 
Figure 4.  IMS Moving Towards a Context Enabler 
This paper proposes to have Context Services playing de 
role of IMS specific applications that make the bridge between 
context producers and context consumers. It is here devised 
IMS as a context facilitator in which the IMS Application 
Servers are used to manage context instead of the standard 
multimedia services. The proposed framework is context 
agnostic being capable of controlling all types of context 
information. CxS shall collect context information from CxP, 
then they shall apply their own logic and finally they shall 
provide inferred context information to CxC. This process shall 
take place independently of the type of information exchanged 
between all context entities. 
 
Figure 5.  Context Framework 
CxS can be further elaborated by splitting the application 
logic from the Context Function (CxF) that has functional roles 
allowing applications to bypass the details of communications 
with CxC and CxP. For instance, all the management of 
context dialogs established between CxP, CxS and CxC shall 
be transparent to applications. Also, Resources Adapters are 
fundamental since they hide the signaling details to the higher 
layers. Consequently they enable both SIP signaling for context 
transfer and HTTP for, for instance, service generic 
information presentation or subscription purposes. 
CxP and CxC shall be considered as SIP UA (User Agents) 
that are able to register under IMS networks and to manage SIP 
specific signaling. They shall have their own logic allowing the 
context information transfer between involved entities. As 
stated in [18], SIP is the protocol adopted for session control in 
the IMS systems. Therefore, it makes sense to use it for an 
IMS-based context management. The context framework can 
be seen above in Figure 5.

the scenario suggested in Section II.B using the framework 
proposed in this paper can be seen in Figure 6. The signaling 
is detailed below. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Signalling Flows 
A. Step 1 
A Mobile Operator (CxC) providing the ―Get Safe‖ service 
intends to obtain immediately the exact street address of one of 
its clients in order to provide him the most appropriated video 
to let him reach the shelter. For that it sends a SIP MESSAGE 
towards the CxS encompassing a XML file describing the user 
identification, which in this case is the user SIP address. The 
XML file sent by the Mobile Operator is presented in Figure 7.  
<?xml version="1.0" ?> 
<!DOCTYPE hdr SYSTEM "MLP_HDR_200.DTD"> 
<svc_init> 
    <hdr ver="2.0.0"> 
        <client> 
            <id>ptin</id> 
            <pwd>test</pwd> 
            <serviceid>Get Safe</serviceid>

      </msids> 
    </slir> 
</svc_init> 
Figure 7.  Request XML file sent from CxC towards CxS 
B. Step 2 
The CxS after validating the request coming from the CxC 
forwards it towards the CxP using a SIP MESSAGE where the 
XML file is included, but instead of requesting the street 
address, it will request the geographic location. 
C. Step 3 
The CxP checks the mobile identity and uses its own 
mechanisms to get the user geographic location. The 
information is compiled in the XML file which is sent towards 
the CxS inside a SIP MESSAGE, as presented in Figure 8.

D. Step 4 
The CxS shall use its own mechanisms to translate 
geographic location into addresses location. After doing the 
conversion, CxS sends the answer back towards the CxC, 
which in this case is the Mobile Operator, providing the Get 
Safe service. A SIP MESSAGE is sent containing the XML file 
described in Figure 9. Having the right user location, Mobile 
Operators can now select the video that best helps the user 
running away from the flood.

distribution. A service scenario was here presented exposing 
the potentialities of the Internet of Things usage in the mobile 
services domain. 
System performance evaluation is envisaged as future 
work. A particular attention will be given to the delays 
introduced by the context management. Moreover, the impact 
of the additional signaling introduced by the context 
information transport will be analyzed in the IMS-based 
context-aware system.
