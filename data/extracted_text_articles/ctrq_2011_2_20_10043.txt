Abstract—In order to provide reliable and secure commu-
nication against eavesdroppers and jammers over networks,
Universal Secure Error-Correcting Network Codes (USECNC)
based on Maximum-Rank-Distance (MRD) codes have been
introduced. This code can be applied to any underlying network
codes. However, Shioji et al. introduced a reasonable network
model against the code. In their model, an attacker eavesdrops
information symbols from some links, where the set of eaves-
dropping links is re-selected during one packet transmission.
The MRD-code-based USECNC cannot guarantee the security
against eavesdroppers under this model. Inspired by Shioji
et al.’s result, this paper considers the model such that the
set of links that jamming (error) symbols are injected into
is re-selected for each time slot. We show that the MRD-
code-based USECNC cannot guarantee the error-correcting
capability under the model of time-varying jamming links,
even if the number of jamming links is limited to only one.
Furthermore, by introducing a restriction on the ﬁeld of local
coding vectors in the network coding, we propose a simple
solution to the problem of time-varying jamming links for
MRD-code-based USECNC.

I. INTRODUCTION
Network coding [1] has been attracting much attentions
since it can achieve better performance than ordinary net-
works with routing methods in terms of throughput, energy
consumption, etc [2][3].
In reality, network coding may suffer from two kinds
of
adversaries:
eavesdropping
and
jamming.
Silva
et
al.’s presented Universal Secure Error-Correcting Network
Codes (USECNC) [4][5] based on Maximum-Rank-Distance
(MRD) codes [6][7] to provide secure and reliable communi-
cation against eavesdroppers and jammers over the network.
Their code can be applied to any underlying network codes
and hence it is called ‘universal’. In the construction of
Silva et al.’s USECNC, packets are split into m segments
and transmitted to sink nodes through the network over m
time slots. It has been assumed that packets are tapped by
eavesdroppers and corrupted by jammers on several links
that are ﬁxed during one transmission of packets, i.e. m
time slots.
Shioji et al. introduced the time-varying eavesdropping-
link model in which attacker can re-select the set of eaves-
dropping links at each time slot of one packet transmission
[8]. They showed that Silva et al.’s USECNC is insecure
under this model, that is, information is leaked to eaves-
droppers [8]. When the network coding is implemented
on an overlay network of the Internet, the assumption of
time-varying eavesdropping links is reasonable. Although a
packet is not split from the perspective of the overlay net-
work and they are transmitted through ﬁxed ‘logical’ paths,
a packet is split into multiple fragments and they are routed
over different ‘physical’ paths at an intermediate router.
Hence, from the point of view of the overlay network, the set
of tapped logical links may be re-selected if physical links
are eavesdropped. Such attackers against the network might
be active, i.e. jammers who inject jamming packets into links
to corrupt the network. Thus, this paper considers the model
such that the attacker injects jamming (error) symbols into
some links (called ‘jamming links’) in the network, and the
set of jamming links is re-selected during one transmission
of packets. We show that the MRD-code-based USECNC
cannot guarantee the error-correcting capability under the
model of time-varying jamming links, even if the number
of jamming links is limited to only one. Furthermore, by
introducing a restriction on the ﬁeld of local coding vectors
(LCV’s) in the network coding, we propose a simple solution
to the problem of time-varying jamming links for MRD-
code-based USECNC.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
gives several deﬁnitions, the basic model of network coding
and a brief review of MRD-code-based USECNC presented
by Silva et al. In Section III, we introduce the time-varying
jamming-link model, and show the vulnerability of MRD-
code-based USECNC under this model. In Section IV, we
propose a simple countermeasure against this model. Finally,
we conclude this paper in Section V.
II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we give deﬁnitions about the representation
of ﬁnite ﬁeld extensions, the basic model of network coding

and a brief review of MRD-code-based USECNC presented
by Silva et al.
A. Field Extensions
Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld containing q elements, and let Fqm
be an m-degree ﬁeld extension of a base ﬁeld Fq. Then, Fqm
can be viewed as a vector space over Fq. When the basis of
the space is ﬁxed, i.e., an irreducible polynomial generating
the ﬁeld extension is determined, an element of Fqm can
be represented by an m-dimensional vector over Fq. We
suppose that the vector representation of x ∈ Fqm is written
by [x(1), x(2), . . . , x(m)] ∈ Fm
q .
B. Network Coding
Let G = (E, V) be a delay-free acyclic directed network,
where E and V denote a set of links (edge, channel) and a
set of nodes, respectively. Let s ∈ V and R ⊂ V respectively
denote a source node and a set of sink nodes, where s ̸∈ R.
In this network model, we suppose that each link can carry
an element of Fq per one time slot. The source node wishes
to multicast the sequence ⃗x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn]T ∈ Fn
q to
all sink nodes at rate n, where the rate is deﬁned as the
number of elements in Fq transmitted from s per one time
slot. Suppose that
n ≤ min{maxﬂow(s, r) : r ∈ R}
holds, where maxﬂow(s, r) (i, j ∈ V) denotes the max-ﬂow
from i to j. Then, there exists a network coding method in
which s can multicast ⃗x to all nodes in R at rate equal to
n [1].
We assume that linear network coding [9] is employed
over G, i.e., the type of data processing performed on
the packets at each node is limited to linear combination.
This implies that the data ﬂow on any link over G can be
represented as an Fq-linear combination of the sequence
x1, x2, . . . , xn. Thus, the information ﬂow on link e ∈ E
can be denoted as ye = ⃗bT
e · ⃗x using a global coding
vector (GCV), ⃗be = [b1, b2, . . . , bn]T ∈ Fn
q . When one has
access to, say, l links e1, e2, . . . , el, then the information
obtained from these links is denoted as M⃗x ∈ Fl
q, where
M = [⃗be1,⃗be2, . . . ,⃗ben]T. Constructing a network code is
equivalent to determining the GCV of each link by setting
the coefﬁcients of the linear combination performed at each
node.
C. The MRD-Code-Based USECNC
Here we introduce the ﬁxed jamming-link model and the
construction of Silva et al’s USECNC employed over this
model [4][5].
1) Fixed Jamming-Link Model: Suppose that one packet
is composed of an element of Fqm that is an m-degree ﬁeld
extension of Fq, and is represented by an m-dimensional
vector over Fq. We deﬁne n packets transmitted from the
source node s by X
= [X1, X2, . . . , Xn]T ∈ Fn
qm(=
Fn×m
q
). Then, the duration of one transmission of X is
composed of m time slots. The source node s splits X and
sends them over m time slots using a linear network code
though G, i.e., transmits [X(i)
1 , X(i)
2 , . . . , X(i)
n ]T ∈ Fn
q at
each time slot i = 1, . . . , m.
Here we suppose that there exist t(< n) jamming links
in E and they inject error packets into G. Silva et al. [4][5]
assumed that these links are ﬁxed during one transmission,
i.e., m time slots. At a speciﬁc sink node, the received
packets though G with injection of jamming (error) packets
is represented by
Y = AX + DZ ∈ Fn×m
q
,
(1)
where A ∈ Fn×n
q
is a transition matrix corresponding
to GCV’s. A linear network code employed over G is
called feasible [10] if rank A = n for all sink nodes,
otherwise it is rank-deﬁcient. The rank deﬁciency is deﬁned
as ρ = n − rank A. On the other hand, Z ∈ Ft×m
q
denotes
t jamming (error) packets. D ∈ Fn×t
q
is a transition matrix
corresponding to jamming links. D and Z are unknown ran-
dom variables with unknown distributions. Then rank D ≤ t
holds since t < n must hold.
Throughout this paper, we focus our attention only on
injection of jamming packets, and omit eavesdropping on
links (cf., Shioji et al.’s analysis in [8]).
2) Silva et al.’s Scheme: For the construction against
the jamming(error)-packet injection, Silva et al.’s Universal
Secure Error-Correcting Network Codes (USECNC) [4][5]
is equivalent to [n, k] Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) code
C ⊂ Fn×m
q
satisfying m ≥ n and 0 < k ≤ n−2t−ρ, where
ρ (= n − rank A) is the rank deﬁciency of A. Namely, the
transmitted packet X in Eq.(1) is a codeword of C. MRD
code is a class of linear codes over Fqm, which is optimal in
the rank-distance sense. For the [n, k] MRD code C, we have
dR(C) ≥ 2t + ρ + 1, where dR(C) denotes the minimum
rank-distance [6][7] between all pairs of distinct codewords
of C. We also have
dR(AX, Y ) = rank (Y − AX)
= rank DZ
≤ rank Z
≤ t,
(2)
where dR(P, Q) denotes the rank-distance between matrices
P, Q ∈ Fn×m
q
. Hence, the minimum rank-distance decoder
of C can correct t jamming packets (and ρ rank deﬁciency
of A) under the ﬁxed jamming-link model (n − k ≥ 2t + ρ)
[10].
III. TIME-VARYING JAMMING LINKS OVER THE
NETWORK
In this section, we introduce the model of time-varying
jamming links, and show that MRD-code-based USECNC
cannot guarantee the error-correcting capability under this
model.

A. The Model
Suppose that the source node s multicast n packets, i.e., n
vectors in Fm
q , over time slots i = 1, 2, . . . , m. We consider
a model such that the jammer(s) can re-select the set of t
jamming links at each time slot i.
Denote the t error packets injected into G by a t × m
matrix
Z = [⃗z1, ⃗z2, . . . , ⃗zm] ∈ Ft×m
q
,
where ⃗zi
∈
Ft
q (i
=
1, 2, . . . , m) is a t-dimensional
column vector chosen according to arbitrary distribution.
At a speciﬁc sink node, let Di ∈ Fn×t
q
(i = 1, 2, . . . , m)
be a n × t matrix representing the linear combination of
jamming-packet segments at time i. Jammer(s) specify the
set of jamming-links arbitrarily, and hence we assume that
Di is chosen arbitrarily by jammer(s). The received matrix
Y ∈ Fn×m
q
at the speciﬁc sink node is written as
Y = AX + V ∈ Fn×m
q
,
(3)
where the matrix V denotes jamming packets conveyed over
the time-varying jamming links, given by
V = [D1⃗z1, D2⃗z2, . . . , Dm⃗zm] ∈ Fn×m
q
.
When D1 = D2 = · · · = Dm, Eq.(3) is equivalent to Silva
et al.’s ﬁxed jamming-link model [4][5].
B. MRD-Code-Based USECNC under the Time-Varying
Jamming Link Model
On the time-varying jamming-link model presented in the
previous subsection, we ﬁrst have the following lemma.
Lemma 1. Suppose that the jammer(s) can arbitrarily
select non-zero matrices D1, D2, . . . , Dm from Fn×t
q
and
can generate non-zero vectors ⃗z1, ⃗z2, . . . , ⃗zm ∈ Ft
q. Then
the maximum possible rank of V is n.
Proof: It is only necessary to show an example having
rank V = n. Choose Di for i = 1, 2, . . . , n (n ≤ m) as
follows:
D1 =
[
⃗u1,⃗0, . . . ,⃗0
]
,
D2 =
[
⃗u2,⃗0, . . . ,⃗0
]
,
...
Dn =
[
⃗un,⃗0, . . . ,⃗0
]
,
where ⃗uj denotes the j-th column vector of an n×n identity
matrix and ⃗0 is a column zero vector. Let ⃗zi be represented
as ⃗zi = [z(1)
i
, 0, . . . , 0]T ∈ Ft
q. We assume that z(1)
i
is chosen
from F∗
q = Fq\{0} for i = 1, . . . , n. Then, we denote V by
V = [D1⃗z1, D2⃗z2, . . . , Dn⃗zn | Dn+1⃗zn+1, . . . , Dm+1⃗zm+1]
= [V1 | V2] ,
where V1 can be represented as
V1 = [D1⃗z1, D2⃗z2, . . . , Dn⃗zn]
=


z(1)
1
· · ·
0
...
...
...
0
· · ·
z(1)
n

 .
We thus have rank V1 = n and hence rank V = n holds.
This completes the lemma.
Denote rank V = v. We then have v ≤ n from Lemma 1.
Let X in Eq.(3) be a codeword of Silva et al.’s USECNC,
that is, [n, k] MRD code C with m ≥ n and 0 < k ≤
n−2t−ρ. From Lemma 1, jammers may select Di and ⃗zi to
satisfy v > t even if rank Di ≤ t holds for all i = 1, . . . , m.
We then have
t < v = rank V
= rank (Y − AX)
= dR(Y, AX).
Thus, the decoder of C cannot correct t jamming (error)
packets under the time-varying jamming-link model.
Moreover, we give the following lemma that shows the
number of jamming packets is independent of rank V .
Lemma 2. Suppose that jammer(s) can arbitrarily choose
Di’s in Eq.(3) from Fn×t
q
. Then, the maximum possible rank
of V is n, which is independent of the value t > 0.
Proof: Since the supposition m ≥ n is required in
Silva et al.’s USECNC, the example presented in the proof
of Lemma 1 always satisfy rank V
= n. Moreover, in
the example in the proof of Lemma 1, we have assumed
rank Di = 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n independently from the
value t > 0. Thus the lemma is completed.
The above analysis proves the following result.
Theorem 1. Suppose that there are t′ jamming links in E
under the time-varying jamming-link model. Let the trans-
mitted packet over the network is a codeword of Silva et al.’s
USECNC, i.e., [n, k] MRD code C with 0 < k ≤ n − 2t − ρ
and m ≥ n. Then, for any t′ > 0, the decoder of C
cannot correct t′ jamming (error) packets injected from time-
varying jamming links.
This
theorem
implies
that,
under
the
time-varying
jamming-link model, Silva et al.’s USECNC cannot guar-
antee the error-correction capability even if t′ = 1.
C. An Example
Assume q = 2, m = n = 3 and t = 1. We do not consider
the rank deﬁciency and the existence of eavesdroppers, and
set ρ = µ = 0. From these parameters, the USECNC is
deﬁned as a [3, 1] MRD code C ⊂ F3×3
2
. A codeword of C
is deﬁned as a 3 × 3 matrix X = [X1, X2, X3]T ∈ C, where
Xi ∈ F3
2.

Under the time-varying jamming-link model, a speciﬁc
sink node receives the following packet.
Y = AX + V

where A ∈ F3×3

, Di ∈ F3×1
2
and ⃗zi ∈ F1
2 for i = 1, 2, 3.
Here we assume rank A = 3 and rank Di ≤ t = 1 for
i = 1, 2, 3. For example, we suppose A is a 3 × 3 identity
matrix I and Di’s are
D1 = [1, 0, 0]T,
D2 = [0, 1, 0]T,
D3 = [0, 0, 1]T.
We note that rank Di = t = 1 for each of i = 1, 2, 3 similar
to the ﬁxed jamming-link model. We also represent Xi =
[X(1)
i
, X(2)
i
, X(3)
i
] ∈ F3
2 and ⃗zi = [zi] ∈ F1
2 for i = 1, 2, 3.
We then receive

In this case, we have rank V = 3 if all z1, z2, z3 are nonzero
and hence X cannot be uniquely reconstructed. This can be
viewed as the worst case of Silva et al.’s USECNC under
the ﬁxed jamming-link model, that is, 3(> t) error packets
are injected into the network.
IV. A SIMPLE WAY TO PREVENT THE JAMMERS
The simplest way to prevent time-varying jamming links
is to construct the network in which no packet is split
into segments. Namely, packets are transmitted not as m-
dimensional vectors using m time slots but as elements
of an m-degree ﬁeld extension itself at one time slot in
Silva et al.’s USECNC. We thus consider how to transmit
codewords of [n, k] MRD code at one time slot over a linear
network code and how to decode the received codeword by
the minimum rank-distance decoder.
Let p be a prime and the number of elements in a base
ﬁeld Fp. And let pm(∼ q) be the number of elements in an
extended ﬁeld Fpm. We redeﬁne that each link can carry an
element of Fpm per one time slot. The source node s wishes
to transmit ⃗x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn]T ∈ Fn
pm to all sink nodes
in R at one time slot using a linear network code. Then, the
received packet at a speciﬁc sink node is represented as
⃗y = [y1, y2, . . . , yn]T
= A⃗x + D⃗z ∈ Fn
pm,
(4)
where A ∈ Fn×n
pm
is a transition matrix according to a
linear network code over Fpm. ⃗z ∈ Ft
pm denotes t jamming
packets and D ∈ Ft×t
pm is a transition matrix corresponding
to jamming links.
Assume ⃗x ∈ Fn
pm(= Fn×m
p
) in Eq.(4) is a codeword of
[n, k] MRD code deﬁned over Fpm, where m ≥ n and 0 <
k ≤ n − 2t + ρ. Let M(·) denote the matrix representation
of a vector in Fn
pm to measure the rank distance between
vectors. For example, the matrix representation of ⃗x is
M(⃗x) =

where [x(1)

p is the vector representa-
tion of xi ∈ Fpm (i = 1, . . . , n). Then, according to Eq.(4),
we have
dR(M(A⃗x), M(⃗y)) = rank (M(⃗y) − M(A⃗x))
= rank (M(⃗y − A⃗x))
= rank M(D⃗z),
(5)
from the properties of the additive operation over a ﬁeld
extension Fpm. However, unlike Eq.(2), rank M(D⃗z) ≤ t
does not always hold from the property of the multiplicative
operation over Fpm. Hence, the minimum rank-distance
decoder of the [n, k] MRD code cannot be simply applied
to Eq.(4). Hence, we add the following condition to the
construction of the underlying network coding such that
rank M(D⃗z) ≤ t always holds.
Condition 1. For all nodes, elements of local coding vectors
(LCV’s) are chosen from the subﬁeld (base ﬁeld) Fp of the
ﬁeld extension Fpm.
Note that elements of LCV’s are coefﬁcients of linear
combination of incoming symbols at each node and they
deﬁne elements of GCV’s [2]. Thus, this condition also
yields that the transition matrices A and D are deﬁned over
the subﬁeld, i.e., A ∈ Fn×n
p
⊂ Fn×n
pm
and D ∈ Ft×t
p
⊂ Ft×t
pm .
For any a ∈ Fp and b ∈ Fpm, their vector representations
are [0, . . . , 0, a] ∈ Fm
p
and [b(1), b(2), . . . , b(m)] ∈ Fm
p ,
respectively. Then, the multiplication ab over Fpm is given
by
ab := [ab(1), ab(2), . . . , ab(m)],
from the fact of ﬁnite ﬁelds. That is, all operations can be
executed over the base ﬁeld Fp. Thus, under Condition 1,

p is the vector representation of zw ∈ Fpm (w = 1, . . . , t).
Since rank M(⃗z) ≤ t, we have
rank M(D⃗z) = rank DM(⃗Z) ≤ t.
Combining Eq.(5) and this, the minimum rank-distance
decoder of the [n, k] MRD code can decode the received
packets ⃗y as with the Silva et al.’s USECNC for the ﬁxed
jamming-link model.
However, this solution contains the following problems; a)
The scheme is not universal since the condition of LCV’s is
introduced. b) Since the ﬁeld for LCV’s is changed from Fq
to Fp with p < q, the probability of rank deﬁciency becomes
high when random network coding [11] is employed, or
the size of Fp might be insufﬁcient for the deterministic
construction of network coding depending on the network
structure [12]. We believe the completely different technique
from MRD codes must be required to realize universal
secure error-correcting codes against the time-varying jam-
ming links.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper considered the reasonable network model such
that the set of links that jamming (error) symbols are injected
into is re-selected for each time slot. We revealed that
the MRD-code-based USECNC cannot guarantee the error-
correcting capability under the model of time-varying jam-
ming links, even if the number of jamming links is limited to
only one. Further, by introducing a severe restriction to the
ﬁeld of LCV’s, we presented a simple way to avoid jamming
with the time-varying jamming links for MRD-code-based
USECNC.
