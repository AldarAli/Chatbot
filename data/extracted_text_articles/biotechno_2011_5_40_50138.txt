Abstract— This paper reports an extension of an established 
bioinformatics approach to a new organism involving more 
than one strains for comparison. Methicillin/multidrug-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus causes serious infections in 
humans and becomes resistant to increasing numbers of 
antibiotics. Our approach utilizing CD-HIT and BLASP in 
silico tools identified 133 and 134 genes in MRSA 252 strain 
and MRSA Mu50 strain respectively that are essential to 
pathogen survival with E-score < 10-4 and absent in the human 
genome with E-score < 10-3. The genes were further classified 
according to their known or hypothetical or putative functions 
annotated by NCBI RefSeq and/or Integr8-Inquisitor. A list of 
central energy metabolic enzymes, which either do not have 
human homologues or functionally differentiate themselves 
from their human counterparts through alternative catalytic 
mechanisms, were considered as promising antibiotic drug 
targets.  We proposed that the development of central energy 
metabolic inhibitors is a novel approach to avoid antibiotic 
resistance.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Methicillin/multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) infections are caused by antibiotic resistant 
strains of the common bacterium Staphylococcus aureus 
[1]. The beginning signs of MRSA infections are skin 
infections that resemble pimples, boils or spider bites.  In 
immune-deficient patients, localized skin infections 
quickly spread through the bloodstream causing vital 
organ infections and possible death [2]. In a 2007 Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention press release, there 
were 
about 
94,000 
cases 
of 
MRSA 
infections, 
contributing to around 19,000 deaths in the United States 
in 2005, which implies a mortality rate higher than that 
caused by HIV [3, 4]. 
The first MRSA case presented in the United Kingdom 
in 1961[5]. Shortly after, more variations were identified 
to be immune to β-lactam antibiotics (including 
penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and cephalosporins [6, 
7]). Newly discovered MRSA strains have evolved to 
survive 
sulfa 
drugs, 
such 
as 
tetracyclines, 
and 
clindamycin [8]. Glycopeptide antibiotics, such as 
vancomycin and teicoplanin, considered drugs of "last 
resort", were used for the treatment of MRSA infections 
[9, 10]. However, recently discovered MRSA strains 
showed resistance even to vancomycin and teicoplanin 
[11, 12].  As of 2007, one variant found was resistant to 
six major kinds of antibiotics [13]. 
The current treatment for MRSA infections is still 
traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics such as lincosamides, 
sulfa drugs, glycopeptides [14-16], among which linezolids 
[17] daptomycin [18], Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 
MoxifloxacinHCl  were considered relatively more effective 
[19, 20] though MRSA infections have become increasingly 
difficult to treat [15-17]. Thus, alternative treatments 
precisely targeting the root cause of MRSA infections needs 
to be established. 
Novel antibiotic development focuses on the following: 
target screening vs. whole organism screening, microarray 
and/or proteomics [21]; target identification; rational and 
computer-assisted drug design [22, 23] and combinatorial 
chemistry etc..  The task falls on the shoulder of academia 
since the pharmaceutical industry has ceased investing in 
antibiotic discovery owing to high cost, lengthening 
developing cycles, complexities and low profits along with 
failure of several recent investments into target-based 
approaches [24]. In this paper, we report the initial results of 
anti-MRSA drug development, i.e., a systematic in silico 
approach for the identification of drug targets in two MRSA 
strains, MRSA 252 and MRSA Mu50 based on the 
following two criteria: essentiality to pathogen survival and 
absence from the human genome [25, 26]. The novelty lays 
in that a special list of enzymes targeting bacterial 
metabolism was identified, shedding light on a potentially 
new approach for antibiotic development. 
II. 
METHOD   
The objective of this study was to determine potential 
drug targets for alternative treatment of MRSA infections, to 
explore hypothetically the functions of the identified targets

and to shorten the list. We employed a reported in silico 
approach through a systematic and juestified method [27, 
28] for the identification of drug targets in two MRSA 
strains, MRSA 252 and MRSA Mu50. The proteomes of 
MRSA 252 and Mu50 were retrieved from NCBI gene bank 
[29]. MRSA genes were purged at 90 % and 60% using CD-
HIT [30] to remove paralogues. The resulting sequences 
were run through the database of essential genes (DEG) [31, 
32] at an expectation (E-value) cutoff of 10-4. The database 
of essential genes includes genes required for basic survival 
of Staphylococcus aureus and other microorganisms 
according to experimental evidence. The essential genes 
were subjected to BLASTP against the human genome to 
exclude any genes that have a significant match (E-value 
cutoff of 10-3 and lower) with human homologs. Genes 
having BLAST E-scores less than 10-3 were considered as 
having no close relatives in human. Information about the 
putative gene function was derived from the annotated 
genome sequence through NCBI RefSeq and Integr8-
Inquisitor [33].  
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The goal of this investigation was to determine potential 
drug targets for alternative treatment of MRSA infections 
and to classify and to analyze the identified targets. Out of 
the complete genomes of 13 MRSA strains that were 
sequenced and deposited in the NCBI gene bank, MRSA 
252 and MRSA Mu50 were selected due to the fact that the 
former is a common strain in USA [34] and UK [35] and the 
latter, a methicillin and vancomycin resistant strain isolated 
in Japan [36] is commercially available for future molecular 
biological study (ATCC). The common method of drug 
target 
identification 
encompasses 
two 
steps: 
the 
identification of essential genes for bacterial viability [25] 
and the identification of genes absent in the human genome 
[26]. The former was performed by adopting the DEG 
database in our approach because this database compiles a 
list of all currently available essential genes in more than 10 
prokaryotes including Staphylococcus aureus [29] and was 
proved to be more accessible than conventional tools [27, 
28]. On the other hand, the availability of the human 
genome sequence [37, 38] renders the latter step feasible. 
Following two newly published genomic analysis methods 
[27, 28], 2656 MRSA 250 and 2697 Mu50 genes were 
purged at 90 % and 60% using CD-HIT to remove 
paralogues, respectively. The resulting 2568 MRSA 250 and 
2592 Mu50 sequences were run through the database of 
essential genes (DEG) at an expectation cut-off of 10-4, 
yielding 499 and 496 essential genes respectively. Those 
499 and 496 essential genes identified were subjected to 
BLASTP against the human genome [37, 38] to exclude any 
genes that have a significant match (E-value cutoff of 10-3 
and lower) with human homologs. Consensually, 133 
MRSA 252 and 134 Mu50 genes respectively were

considered as having no close relatives in human. The 
results are summarized in table 1. Their known or 
hypothetic or putative functions annotated by NCBI RefSeq 
Integr8-Inquisitor are listed in table 2. 
 
 Among 
the 
133 
and 
134 
essential 
non-human 
homologous genes in MRSA 252 and Mu50 strains, 
respectively, 133 encode proteins that are well conserved 
between the two strains. Out of this conserved set, 63 are 
involved in metabolism, 24 participate in the transmission 
of genetic information, 29 represent transmembrane 
proteins, 9 are with other functions such as regulation cell 
division and  carrier proteins, etc., and 8 have unknown 
functions.  
Our approach identified 14 genes in cell wall 
biosynthesis.  Other research groups have validated most 
of these targets [39-41]. Among them, 6 are involved in 
the elongation of peptidoglycan, in agreement with 
previous studies [39, 40]. FemA family proteins are 
currently considered novel anti-staphylococcal targets due 
to the fact that they are involved in cell wall biosynthesis 
and expression of a methicillin resistance gene [41]. They 
are found to be essential in both MRSA 252 (NCBI Gene 
Accession#: 49484627 and 49483567) and Mu50 (NCBI 
Gene Accession#: 15925401 and 15924364) strains by our 
approach. Gene GI#49484133 in MRSA 252 and 
GI#15924882 
in 
Mu50 
respectively 
represents 
Staphylococcus aureus murE gene encoding UDP-N-
acetylmuramyl 
tripeptide 
synthetase, 
which 
was 
demonstrated to be essential in Staphylococcus aureus 
through a method incorporating an IPTG controllable 
promoter [42].  
 
Although the cell wall has long been considered an 
attractive target for antibiotic development because of its 
absence in humans, what should not be overlooked is that 
one of the most common antibiotic resistance mechanisms is 
the metamorphosis of cell-wall proteins, resulting in 
inhibiting antibiotic activity. For example, β-lactam

resistance was attributed to the expression of a group of cell 
wall penicillin-binding proteins (PBP-2’) encoded by the 
mecA gene [43, 44]. Glycopeptide resistance is also 
considered to be caused by cell wall thickening resulting in 
binding vancomysin extracellularly [45,46] and/or alteration 
of the drug-acting site in the cell wall from D-alanine-D-
alanine to D-alanine-D-lactate owing to the expression of 
vanA resistance gene [47]. Hence, for novel antibiotic 
development, substances that anchor in sites other than the 
bacterial cell wall may have more potential because 
resistance usually arises as the result of gene mutation on 
the target proteins that are subject to direct antibiotic attack 
[48]. A 2006 review on mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic 
resistance suggested the exploration of novel antibiotics 
with alternative mechanisms of action [49].  
Genes involved in transmission of genetic information 
including DNA replication, recombination and repair, 
transcription and RNA processing, translation, post-
translational modification remain viable targets for 
antibacterial agent development [33]. Our approach 
identified 24 of these candidate genes. 
Our approach identified 29 membrane bound proteins. 
A recent review on anti-MRSA drug development 
indicated that agents anchoring in the bacterial membrane 
(e.g., 
ceragenins 
and 
lipopeptides) 
showed 
great 
bactericidal effect and may be less prone to drug 
resistance due to the incapability of bacteria to modify 
their targets in a way that is compatible with their 
survival [50]. Among this pool of proteins, 19 are 
involved in membrane transport, which represent valid 
drug targets because pathogens usually lose their 
biosynthetic capabilities and rely on their hosts for the 
supply of essential nutrients [51, 52]. 
Our approach identified 30 energy metabolic (i.e. 
cellular respiration) genes in both MRSA 252 and MRSA 
Mu50, which are essential to staphylococcal survival with 
E-score < 10-4 but absent in human genome with E-score 
<10-3. Currently there are limited numbers of  
commercially available antibiotics targeting energy 
metabolism. Those existing are mainly biological 
reagents such as oligomycin [53] and pesticides or 
piscicides such as antimycin A [54], not commonly used 
for humans in that they affect both bacterial and human 
cells. Surprisingly, nature has provided us with a group of 
energy metabolic enzymes which are essential to 
pathogen survival while absent in humans. The 
differentiation lies in that those enzymes function through 
alternative mechanisms other than their counterpart 
enzymes in humans. For example, fructose-1, 6-
diphosphate aldolase (FBPA) is one of the key enzymes 
in the glycolytic pathway that involves the breakdown of 
glucose [55]. FBPA is divided into two classes based on 
structural properties and catalytic mechanisms [56]. Class  
I FBPA is mainly found in higher order organisms (e.g., 
human and animals). Catalysis in Class I FBPA proceeds 
via a Schiff base intermediate formed by an active site 
lysine residue [55]. Class II FBPA is usually found in 
yeasts, bacteria, fungi, and parasites [56]. Catalysis in Class 
II FBPA centers on the participation of a Zn (II) cofactor 
that coordinates to an enolate anion intermediate [54]. 
Multiple alignment of the sequence of MRSA FBPA  with 
class II giardia FBPA and class I human FBPA was shown 
in Fig. 1. MRSA FBPA (NCBI Gene Accession#: 49484349 
and 15925115 respectively) exhibits 40.8% sequence 
identity to Class II giardia FBPA while it exhibits only 18.8 
% sequence identity to class I human FBPA [57,58]. Thus, 
MRSA FBPA should be hypothetically classified into class 
II FBPA, not class I FBPA. Validation of the essential 
nature of class II MRSA FBPA through allelic replacement 
and inducible expression is underway in our research group. 
Based on major differences in active site structure and 
catalytic mechanism, an inhibitor of class II FBPA can be 
designed which will not inhibit class I FBPA. 
Accumulating in vitro [59] and in vivo [60] evidence 
suggests that enzymes catalyzing bacterial cellular 
respiration with differentiated mechanisms of action are 
promising targets for novel antibiotic development. The

inhibitors designed are able to hinder bacterial growth by 
inhibition of those enzymes without interfering with their 
human cousins. Most importantly, attacking bacterial 
energy-making machinery bypasses the usual bacterial 
mutation sites for drug resistance [61-62]. The rationale 
lies in that almost all existing antibiotics target only 4 
cellular functions: cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, 
nucleic acid synthesis and foliate synthesis, though there 
are hundreds of antibiotics on the market [63]. Repeated 
exposure of bacteria to antibacterial reagents targeting 
similar sites increases the chance of bacterial gene 
mutation, which remains to be the primary cause of the 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, 
NDM-1 induced antibiotic -resistant Escherichia coli  
[62], and etc.. Exploration of antibiotics targeting 
alternative cellular functions such as central metabolic 
pathways may be a promising direction, and selective 
inhibition of targets specific to bacterial energy 
metabolism may be a potentially efficacious alternative in 
the treatment of MRSA infections. The enzymes on the 
higher priority list include MRSA FBPA, MRSA 
dihydroxyacetone kinase (DAK) 2 Phosphatase, MRSA 
acetate kinase, MRSA histidinol dehydrogenase, MRSA 
Phosphotransacetylase, 
MRSA 
Sucrose-6-phosphate 
hydrolase and MRSA glycerate kinase, which either do 
not have human homologues or adopt dramatically 
different  catalytic mechanisms comparing to their human 
cousins.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
One of the crucial steps in narrow-spectrum antibiotics 
development is target identification. In this study, a putative 
set of candidate drug targets were elucidated by an in silico 
approach.  The candidate genes are hypothetically required 
for survival of the candidate microorganism and have no 
close human analogue.    Many identified targets have been 
experimentally validated [41-44, 65-68]. By shortening the 
list of potential drug targets to a small pool of genes, the 
data presented in this paper facilitated our group and, may 
also aid other researchers in pursuing target validation and 
target characterization for alternative treatment of MRSA 
infections. Future directions include developing inhibitors. 
for the candidate proteins. In principle, the premise is that 
the inhibitors of these targets should only be toxic to 
pathogens but safe for use by humans. 
 
More importantly, we propose that a class of central 
metabolic enzymes, such as MRSA FBPA, MRSA 
dihydroxyacetone kinase (DAK) 2 Phosphatase, MRSA 
acetate kinase, MRSA histidinol dehydrogenase, MRSA 
Phosphotransacetylase, 
MRSA 
Sucrose-6-phosphate 
hydrolase and MRSA glycerate kinase (table 2), are 
promising antibiotic drug targets due to the fact that  they 
either do not have their human counterparts or if they do, 
different  catalytic mechanisms are employed (e.g., class I 
and class II FBPA). Based on major differences in active 
site structure and catalytic mechanism, an inhibitor of such a 
bacterial enzyme can be designed which will not inhibit its 
human cousin. Also, the risk of bacterial drug resistance 
against inhibitors of those enzymes may be low because 
antibiotics targeting bacterial central metabolism are not 
commonly used. Those cellular sites are not repeatedly 
exposed to antibacterial agents thus less prone to drug 
resistance. Proposed long-term work includes utilizing 
MRSA as a model bacterial system to develop methods 
combating antibiotic resistance. It is even more crucial that 
this type of investigation is undertaken in academia than it 
would be if industry were still heavily investing in it [24, 
63].
