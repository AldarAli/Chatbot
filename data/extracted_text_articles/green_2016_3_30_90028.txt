Abstract— Recently, analog radio systems are being replaced 
with digital radio systems. The digital radio can provide high 
quality services because it is robust to interference and it has a 
high power efficiency. Thus, an efficient channel allocation 
plan is needed. This paper proposes a channel allocation plan 
for Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and Digital Radio 
Mondiale Plus (DRM+) systems in Very High Frequency 
(VHF) band III, and presents interference analysis results 
about this plan. In the channel allocation plan for only DAB 
system, some local stations lack extra available programs. 
Accordingly, DRM+ blocks are allocated to the local stations. 
This paper analyzes the interference between the DAB system 
and between the DRM+ system. These results will contribute to 
broadcast network planning of the digital radio. 
Keywords-Digital radio broadcast; DAB system; DRM+ 
system; Channel allocation plan. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, most communication systems are changing the 
digital systems [1] because analog communication systems 
are sensitive to noise and have a low frequency efficiency. 
Also many countries are promoting the introduction of the 
digital radio and some countries are actually providing 
digital radio service. 
Digital radio is robust against interference, has a higher 
power efficiency than existing systems and can provide 
additional data service, such as a text messege, image, thus 
it can provide high quality of service that can enhance 
competitiveness of the radio medium. In particular, it can 
efficiently use the limited frequency resources because it 
can multiplex various programs on a single broadcast 
channel. So, existing broadcasters are able to provide 
additional services and the listener can obtain a variety of 
media by introducing new radio operators. 
In this paper, we develop a channel allocation plan for 
the DAB system [7] and DRM+ system [8] in VHF Band III. 
In this paper, we present the interference analysis simulation 
results. 
This paper content is: In Section 2, the DAB and DRM+ 
systems are presented. Section 3 describes the DAB and the 
DRM + channel assignment scheme in the VHF channel. In 
Section 4, we presents results of the interference analysis 
simulation. Finally, in Section 5, we present the conclusion. 
II. DAB/DRM+ SYSTEMS DESCRIPTION AND FREQUENCY 
ASSIGNMENT SCHEME 
A. DAB and DRM+ systems desription 
The DAB system can provide a high quality service and 
excellent mobile reception quality by using audio 
compression technology based on Moving Picture Experts 
Group (MPEG) Audio Layer II [2]. Also, it has high 
efficiency of using frequency because it can transmit 
multiple programs to an OFDM signal called ensemble. In 
this paper, 9 programs are transmitted through one ensemble 
allotted 128kbps bit rate. The transmission method of DAB 
is Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
(COFDM).

Broadcast frequency of DRM+ system is extended to 
240 MHz also bandwidth is increased to 100 kHz. It uses 
MPEG-4 Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) and 
MPEG-4 Harmonic Vector excitation Coding (HVXC) in 
audio coding. The DRM+ system can select one of 4-
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), 16-QAM 
modulation according to a service quality and robustness. 
The transmission method of DRM+ is COFDM and DRM+ 
system transmits 1 program per 1 block allotted 74.5kbps. 
Table 1 indicates a summary of the DAB and DRM+ 
systems [2][3].

ensembles is set to 192 kHz. A lower guard band in front of 
ensemble A is set to 512 kHz, upper guard band beside 
ensemble C is set to 496 kHz. 
 
Figure 1.  DAB ensembles and DRM+ blocks assignment in VHF channel. 
The DRM+ system has a bandwidth of 100 kHz per one 
block and sets the center frequency interval at 100 kHz. 
Therefore, it sets a total of 60 blocks in VHF Channel. DAB 
ensembles and DRM blocks assignment in VHF channel are 
represented in Figure 1.

ALLOCATION PLAN FOR DAB AND DRM+ SYSTEMS 
A. Allocation plan for DAB system 
Terrestrial Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (T-DMB) in 
Korea is being transmited without configuring the SFN 
(Single frequency Network) in some areas because of the 
interference effect of the existing analog TV channel. 
However, we assume SFN area configuration in this paper, 
since the DTV transition is completed from the analog TV. 
T-DMB channel of Jeolla-do is divided into three channels. 
It is integrated into 8 channels. T-DMB channel of 
Gyeongsangbuk-do that is divided into two channels. It is 
integrated 
into 
7 
channels.

integrated into 12 channels. Table 2 shows the integrated 
channels and the existing the T-DMB channel.

We were placed in regional DAB ensemble using a 
derived available channel. The available channels of region 
are shown in Figure 2. Ensembles of each local station are 
allocated based on the number of FM broadcasting which is 
currently broadcasting. For example, in the case of Seoul, 
Seoul Tx is broadcasting on 23 FM radio. When FM 
broadcastings are replaced by DAB ensembles, three 
ensembles are required. Thus, we allocate ensemble A, B, C 
of  Channel 7. Others also allocate DAB ensembles to 
another area in the same way shown in Figure 3. FM 
broadcasting programs are marked with yellow and the 
allocated DAB ensemble numbers are marked with green in 
Figure 3. The cases requiring interference analysis for co-
channel or an adjacent channel are connected with the arrow 
and marked in orange. There are 8 cases requiring 
simulation analysis. The cases are shown in Figure 3. 
In the case of Seoul, three DAB ensembles are allocated 
in Seoul TX  and Seoul TX is able to accommodate 27 
programs and is broadcasting 23 programs. Therefore, it can 
transmit further 4 programs. In the same way, extra available 
programs for each local TX are shown in Table 3. 
 
Figure 2.  The available channel by region in Korea. 
The number of extra available programs is different by 
region. Cheongju TX cannot introduce a new broadcaster 
because, in this case, the number of additional available 
programs is zero. In this paper, in order to solve this 
problem, we propose an allocation plan for DAB and 
DRM+ systems in the area with the less than 6 available 
programs.

Figure 3.  DAB ensemble allocation results by local stations. 
 
B. Mixed allocation plan for the DAB and DRM+ systems 
Upper guard band (496 kHz) and lower guard band (512 
kHz) are in VHF channel with DAB ensemble. Four DRM+ 
blocks are allocated in each guard band as shown in Figure 
5. Frequency offset between the DRM+ block 4 and DAB 
ensemble A in lower guard band is 930 kHz. Frequency 
offset between DRM+ block 57 and DAB ensemble C in 
upper guard band is 930 kHz.  
 
Figure 4.  DAB ensembles and the DRM+ blocks allocation in VHF 
channel. 
According to ITU-R standard [4], when the frequency 
offset between DRM+ block and DAB ensemble is 100 kHz 
and DAB system is wanted signal, D/U ratio is -36 dB. 
When Frequency offset between DRM+ block and DAB 
ensemble is 100 kHz and DRM+ system is wanted signal, 
D/U ratio is -40 dB. Accordingly, the interference effect 
between DRM+ block and DAB ensemble is not considered.

The DRM+ blocks and the DAB ensemble are allocated 
as shown in Figure 4; the total of 56 DRM+ blocks are 
secured from VHF channel 7 to 13. We proposed a plan that 
secures extra available programs in local stations. DRM+ 
blocks is allocated for the number of lacking extra program. 
The final result of allocated DRM+ blocks is shown in 
Figure 5.

Figure 5.  DAB ensemble and DRM+ block allocation results by region 
broadcasting in Korea. 
This plan has the same case considering the interference 
analysis between DAB ensemble as the only DAB ensemble 
allocation plan. Frequency offset between DRM+ block of 
Daejeon and DRM+ block of Daegu is 400 kHz. Hence, we 
execute an interference analysis for case 9 in Figure 5. 
 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULT 
We use the Spectrum Management Intelligence system 
(SMIs) in order to verify the reliability of the derived results. 
SMIs is a frequency analysis system for broadcast networks 
that is used to analyze the interference and the field strength 
of propagation in Korea. This system was offered by the 
Korea National Radio Research Agency (KNRRA) of Korea 
Communication Commission (KCC). 
Protection Ratio (PR) for DAB system interfered with 
by DAB system is set by ITU-R standards [4][5]. PR for 
DRM+ system interfered with by DRM+ system is set by 
ITU-R standards [4][6]. Each PR is shown in Table 4 and 
Table 5.

The interference influence from Cheongju in Chuncheon 
is shown in Figure 6 (a). The interference area is 0.31% of 
the coverage area of Chuncheon. The interference area in 
Kapeong is 1.56% of the total coverage area of Chuncheon. 
This interference area is 3.18% of the coverage area of 
Cheongju. The interference area in Eumsung is 11.31% of 
the total coverage area of Cheongu.

The case 9, interference analysis has confirmed that 
there is no interference between DRM+ systems. The 
simulation result is shown in Figure 7. Besides, stations that 
derived more than 5% interference are organized in Table 4. 
As a result of interference analysis, there is no 
interference between DRM+ block. We derived the results 
that secure extra available programs without additional 
interference situation in DAB ensemble allocation plan. The 
final result is shown in Table 6. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
When we allocate only DAB ensemble in local stations, 
some local stations lack extra available programs. In this 
paper, we proposed a broadcast network plan that allocates 
DAB system mixed with DRM+ system in order to solve the 
problem.

A total of nine cases are derived from allocating DAB 
ensemble and DRM+ block in each local station. As a result 
of interference analysis, additional interference case did not 
occur and local stations that have the extra available 
programs of less than 6 secure 6 extra available programs. 
In this paper, the frequency of DRM+ system is allocated 
with DAB system having no interference. Accordingly, if 
the DRM+ system is used in guard band in the DAB system, 
frequency efficiency is improved. The presented results can 
be used as a basis for broadcast network planning of the 
digital radio in Korea.
