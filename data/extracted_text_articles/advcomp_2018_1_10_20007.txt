Abstract—
This
study
implements an
Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast total
cost of a face drilling rig used in the Swedish mining industry.
The ARIMA model shows different forecasting abilities using
different values of ARIMA parameters (p, d, q). However,
better estimation for the ARIMA parameters is required for
accurate forecasting. Artificial intelligence, such as multi
objective genetic algorithm based on the ARIMA model, could
provide other possibilities for estimating the parameters. Time
series forecasting is widely used for production control,
production planning, optimizing industrial processes and
economic planning. Therefore, the forecasted total cost data of
the face drilling rig can be used for life cycle cost analysis to
estimate the optimal replacement time of this rig.

INTRODUCTION
Time series forecasting predicts future data points based
on observed data over a period known as the lead-time. The
purpose of forecasting data points is to provide a basis for
production control and production planning and to optimize
industrial processes and economic planning. The major
objective is to obtain the best forecast, i.e., to ensure that the
mean square of the deviation between the actual and the
forecasted values is as small as possible for each lead-time
[1]. Over the past few decades, much effort has been devoted
to
the
development
and
improvement
of
time
series
forecasting models [2].
Traditional models for time series forecasting, such as the
Box–Jenkins
or
the
Autoregressive
Integrated
Moving
Average (ARIMA) model, assume time series data are
generated by linear processes. However, these models may
be inappropriate if the underlying mechanism is nonlinear. In
fact, real-world systems are often nonlinear [3]. The ARIMA
model is a stochastic process [1] defined by three parameters,
p, d, and q, where p stands for the Auto-Regressive AR(p)
process, d is the integration (needed for the transformation
into a stationary stochastic process), and q is the Moving
Average MA(q) process [4].
In a stationary stochastic model, the data have the same
variance and autocorrelation [5]. The weakness of this model
is the difficulty of estimating the parameters. To address this
problem and ensure accurate forecasting, we need a process
for automated model selection [6].
Zhang [7] suggests a hybrid method that combines
ARIMA and Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)
models.
The
combination
improves
the
forecasting accuracy. The empirical results with three real
data sets clearly show the hybrid model is able to outperform
each component model. There are some similarities between
ARIMA and ANN models. Both include a rich class of
different models with different model orders. Both require a
relatively
large
sample
to
build
a
successful
model.
However, ARIMA can provide results based on the problem
and data contents.
Hatzakis and Wallace [8] propose a method
that
combines the ARIMA forecasting technique and a Multi
Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) based on Pareto
optimality. Their method is based on historical optimums
and is used to optimize AR(p) and MA(q) to find a non-
dominated Pareto front solution with an infinite number of
points. They found that their method improved the prediction
accuracy. However, they assumed the data were accurate and
used the Pareto front solution to make a forecast.
This study implements an ARIMA model to forecast the
Total Cost (TC) data for a face drilling rig used in an
underground mine in Sweden. Findings from our case study
suggest that the ARIMA model is appropriate, but the
parameters
need
to
be
better
estimated
for
accurate
forecasting.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In
Section ІІ, we define the research paper methodology. In 
Section III, we present the results and discussion. We
conclude the paper in Section IV.

METHODOLOGY
A.
Data collection
The TC data are for a face drilling rig used in an
underground mine in Sweden. The data were collected over a
period of three years (2009 to 2012) by a MAXIMO
Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).
In the CMMS, the TC data are recorded based on the work
orders for the maintenance of the face drilling rig. Every
work order contains corrective maintenance cost data, a
component problem description, and a description of the
actions performed (i.e., corrective maintenance or preventive
maintenance). The repair time and the labour, material and
tool cost of each work order are also included.
In this study, missing and outlier data are filtered from
the selected TC data. Note that all the cost data used in this

study are real costs with no adjustment for inflation. Note
also that because of mining company regulations, the TC
data are encoded and expressed as a Currency Unit (cu).
B.
ARIMA model
The main part of the ARIMA model combines AR and
MA polynomials into a complex polynomial, as seen in (1)
below [9]. The ARIMA (p, d, q) model is applied to all the
data points of the TC data.

q: the number of lags of the moving average process;

The value of the ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) for AR and
MA
can
be
obtained
from
the
behaviour
of
the
Autocorrelation
Function
(ACF)
and
the
Partial
Autocorrelation Function (PACF) [1]. These functions help
to estimate the parameters that can be used to forecast data
using the ARIMA model.
III.
RESULTS AND DESCUSSION
The ARIMA model is implemented stochastically based
on the default values of the parameters p, d and q for the
different scenarios individually for TC (ZTC). The values for
each parameter (p, d, q) are: (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,0,0),
(1,0,1), (1,1,1), (2,1,1) and (2,0,3). All the TC data are
included for each scenario, covering a period of 37 months.
The forecasting is for 24 months. Some scenarios do not
show a reasonable forecasting for this period. In this section,
we present the TC forecasting using the ARIMA parameters
(1,0,1), (0,0,1), (2,1,1) and (2,0,3) as the default input
parameters.
Figure 1 shows the forecasting for ARIMA (1,0,1) for the
log of TC over time (24 months). A polynomial trend curve
is used to illustrate the relationship between the historical TC
data and the forecasted data. The historical TC data (37
months) appear before the vertical line. The forecasted data
(24 months) are presented after the vertical line. The
forecasted data for ARIMA (1,0,1) seem to be in sync with
the historical data before the vertical line and with the
polynomial trend curve after the vertical line. This is obvious
because the forecasted data show a polynomial trend curve.
However, there are lower and higher extreme forecasted
values outside the polynomial trend.

The results of ARIMA (2,0,3) are shown in Figure 4. In
the figure, the forecasted data for the 24-month period seem
to be in sync with the historical data before the vertical line
and with the polynomial trend curve after the vertical line.
Accordingly, these parameters are suitable for forecasting the
TC data for this mining drilling rig.
Figure 4. ARIMA (2,0,3)
Overall, the forecasting using ARIMA (2,0,3) has better
results than forecasting using the other ARIMA input
parameters. We also find that the values of (p, d, q) affect the
ARIMA forecasting, and the ARIMA (p, d, q) values are
sensitive to the data type.
IV.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The forecasting for our case study using the ARIMA
model shows different forecasting abilities using different
values of ARIMA parameters (p, d, q). The ARIMA
parameters (p, d, q) are used in four different scenarios, one
of which shows suitable forecasting. We find that the
parameter values have a strong effect on the forecasting
method. Therefore, these parameters need better estimation
from the data for accurate forecasting. AI such as MOGA
based on the ARIMA model could provide other possibilities
for estimating the parameters (p ,d ,q) and improve data
forecasting. The outcome of the MOGA based on the
ARIMA model can be used to forecast data with a high level
of accuracy, and the forecasted data can be used for life cycle
cost analysis. For example, they can be used to estimate the
optimal replacement time of the face drilling rig used in our
case study.
