Abstract—This paper investigates the call-level traffic capacity 
for cognitive secondary VoIP users in a system with primary 
VoIP users. The system is modeled as a serving system with 
preemptive priority of primary calls over secondary calls. An 
analytical approach is developed to evaluate the VoIP service 
capacity and the quality of service provisioning for the 
secondary users, namely the call blocking and dropping 
probabilities. Methods for call dropping probability regulation 
are proposed. A novel analytical approach for approximate 
evaluation of the effect of limitation is developed and validated 
by simulation experiments.

 INTRODUCTION 
The combination of scarce radio spectrum and increasing 
demands due to newly emerging wireless services is a reason 
to search for a more efficient spectrum use. There are many 
different approaches, such as hierarchical structures with 
micro- and femto-cells, multi-hop connections, new multiple 
access methods, adaptive modulation and coding, etc. Not 
very long ago, a new non-traditional paradigm, namely 
Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), was proposed [1]–[4]. 
The main idea of hierarchical spectrum overlay as a method 
of DSA is that some sectors of licensed spectrum which are 
not currently being used by incumbent (primary) users might 
be temporarily and opportunistically used by other 
(secondary) users. If a primary user (PU) returns to activity, 
a secondary user (SU) has to leave the occupied spectrum. 
Cognitive radio (CR) is the key enabling technology for 
DSA. Among the essential CR functions are spectrum 
sensing and admission control dependent on available 
spectrum. The variable character of the spectrum available to 
SUs makes the service of multimedia traffic difficult due to 
its stringent packet delay requirements. This is particularly 
true for dialog traffic such as VoIP.  
Because of the connection-oriented packet switching 
technique for the service of VoIP traffic and the preemptive 
priority of PU calls over SU calls, two important 
probabilities exist: call blocking probability and call 
dropping probability of a SU call. Since SUs must not affect 
the service of PUs, an ongoing SU call might be interrupted 
and prematurely terminated (dropped) due to the arrival of a 
new PU call. Furthermore, the available capacity to SUs is 
restricted not only by the overall system capacity but also by 
the number of ongoing PU calls. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents related work. The system model, the analytical 
approach, and methods for call dropping probability 
regulation are discussed in Sections III – V, followed by 
numerical results in Section VI. Finally, Section VII 
concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK 
Although the application of CR for VoIP seems 
promising, there are only few papers about VoIP over CR 
published recently. The authors of [5] and its extension [6] 
use the well-known Markov Modulated Poisson Process 
(MMPP) [7] for characterization of SU VoIP traffic in a way 
similar to that in [8]. The PU traffic is modeled as generated 
by on-off sources and for each primary channel an individual 
Markov channel model (as in [9]) is applied. As a result, a 
combined 
complicated 
model 
is 
derived 
which 
is 
numerically clumsy. The non-explicit assumption that the 
same amount of bandwidth is utilized for PU and SU calls is 
not used for a more straightforward approach.  
In [10] and its extension [11], the authors also claim to be 
the first to consider the voice-service capacity analysis for 
CR. These papers propose two cognitive MAC protocols for 
a single channel system shared in a slotted manner by PUs 
and SUs. The PU traffic influence is accounted by the 
probability that a channel time-slot is occupied by a PU 
packet transmission. The process of arrival and service of PU 
and SU packets is modeled by a discrete-time Markov chain. 
A third approach to voice capacity evaluation of CR 
networks is presented in [12]. The transmission media is 
time-slotted and multi-channel. The main difference to the 
works mentioned above is the more general and system-
oriented approach. The authors apply the definitions of 
effective bandwidth [13], [14] to determine the constant 
amount of radio resources required to provide the QoS 
guarantee and effective capacity [15] to determine the 
constant source rate that a channel can support. 
In the literature, there are some papers devoted to CR 
call-level capacity and the corresponding study of SU call 
blocking and dropping probabilities. References [16] and 
[17] investigate the special case when the PU call bandwidth 
is exactly N times greater than the SU call bandwidth. A 
continuous time Markov chain is applied to obtain the call 
blocking and dropping probabilities. In [18], a case in which 
a PU needs the same bandwidth as a SU in order to be served 
is examined. The PU and SU traffic flows are assumed to

have different arrival and service rates. The analytical 
evaluation of the call dropping probability is presumed to be 
difficult, so statistical simulation is applied. 
III. 
THE TELETRAFFIC SYSTEM 
The offered traffic is modeled by two arrival Poisson 
random processes – one for the PUs with rate λp and another 
for the SUs with rate λs. Therefore, the PU (SU) call inter-
arrival time follows a negative exponential distribution with 
mean 1/λp (1/λs). The call duration also follows a negative 
exponential distribution with mean 1/µ for both traffic flows.  
We denote with C (bps) the overall system capacity and 
with c (bps) the necessary average rate for a VoIP PU or SU 
call to be served. The system is considered to have n = C/c 
channels. PU calls have preemptive priority over SU calls. If 
a new SU call finds all of the n channels busy, it is blocked. 
If a new PU call finds all channels busy but there are some 
channels occupied by SU calls, one SU call will be 
interrupted and dismissed (dropped). Blocked and dropped 
calls are lost. Perfect spectrum sensing and spectrum 
handover procedures are assumed in order to implement the 
serving discipline described.  
The teletraffic system described can be depicted by 
means of a 2-D continuous-time Markov chain (Fig. 1). Each 
state (i, j) is presented by two variables: i is the number of 
PU calls and j is the number of SU calls. The probability that 
the system is in state (i, j) is Pi,j. From the call admission 
algorithm, it follows that a PU call is blocked in state (n, 0). 
SU call blocking appears in all states where i+j=n (the 
outermost diagonal states in Fig. 1). In these states without 
state (n, 0), one SU call is dropped when a PU call arrives.  
It is clear that the PU call flow is served as if the SU call 
flow did not exist. Hence, the probability Pn,0 that the system 
is in state (n,0) is easily obtained by the Erlang loss formula:

THE ANALYTICAL MODEL 
The state probabilities Pi,j necessary to calculate the SU 
losses by means of (3) and (4) might be obtained using the 
global balance equations, which can be derived by inspecting 
the different states of the Markov chain (Fig. 1).  
For the states in the first row of Fig. 1, we have:

Equations (14), (16) and (18) differ from the well-known 
Erlang distribution state equilibrium equations for the PU

There is also a more straightforward approach for the 
derivation of Bs. Our serving system state-transition diagram 
(Fig. 1) differs from an ordinary multi-dimensional state-
transition diagram (with no preemptive priority) in the 
additional transitions designated with dashed arrows.  For an 
ordinary multi-dimensional loss system [19] is valid the 
recursion:

which also leads to the Erlang loss formula (23). Both 
relations are valid for our serving system because: 
a) the additional transitions are only between states 
forming one macro-state i + j = n. 
b) due to the memory-less property of the Poisson 
process,  the displacement of a SU call by a PU call with the 
same mean service time of 1/µ will not affect the expected 
time the system spends in the macro-state i + j = n. 
Therefore, the SU call dropping probability Bd is:

Note that recursion (24) (called also Kaufman algorithm 
[20] for fast calculation of multi-dimensional Erlang loss 
formula) can be derived in our case from (20) – (22).  
V. 
CALL DROPPING PROBABILITY REGULATION 
The users are much more sensitive to interruption of an 
ongoing call than to rejection of a new call. Therefore, traffic 
losses due to SU call dropping has to be much lower than 
losses due to SU call blocking. A comparison between (23) 
and (25) shows that there is not a big difference between Bs 
and Bd. The call admission control (CAC) mechanism can be 
used to regulate the relation between these two probabilities. 
A similar problem with handover call dropping occurs in 
wireless cellular networks. The most widely used method for 
reduction of handover call dropping probability is the so-
called channel (trunk) reservation [21], [22]. Other 
techniques, commonly called class limitation or threshold 
policy [19], [23], have been used for QoS regulation in 
wireline integrated multiservice systems. For the system 
considered in our paper, we propose the application of 
analogous methods.   
LIMITATION. The maximum number of admitted SU 
calls by the CAC should be limited to a certain threshold 
value l < n. Consequently, a new SU call will be admitted 
only if the number j of occupied channels by SU calls 
satisfies the following relation: 
0

where r is the number of reserved channels. 
There is a close bond between n and Ap for a given Bp (1). 
Most often Bp is in the range of 0.5% – 2% for VoIP over 
wireless access networks. Considering the VoIP PU network 
as a given fact, our aim is to evaluate the VoIP capacity 
available to the CR network. The main constraint for the 
allowable SU traffic As is not Bs but Bd. The possibilities for 
reducing Bd are: decreasing As; applying limitation (26) or 
reservation (27), which also reduce As but to a lesser extent. 
Limitation is investigated in our paper.

Since the direct application of (28) – (30) is clumsy from 
numerical point of view, we propose a new approach for the 
evaluation of Bs and Bd that gives approximate results but 
has a relatively low computational complexity. Moreover, 
we validate this approach by simulation experiments.  
Let us denote with Ps
i(j) the conditional probability that 
there are j SU calls in the system, provided that the number 
of ongoing PU calls is i. Taking into account the facts that 
the PU and SU arrival traffic flows are independent of each 
other and that the service of PU calls is independent of the 
service of SU calls, we analyze our state-transition diagram 
that is truncated on the upper side due to (26) and obtain:

for the Erlang loss formula; Bp is obtained from (1);              
Ps
i(n-i),{n-l ≤ i < n} will further be derived.  
The preemptive priority of PUs over SUs makes our 
state-transition diagram different from an ordinary multi-
dimensional state-transition diagram and a simple and 
straightforward approach for the evaluation of the state 
probabilities cannot be used. Due to the unidirectional 
transitions, the diagram is not reversible and does not have 
the product-form solution property [19]. Therefore, a simple 
evaluation of Ps
i(n-i) with either the convolutional algorithm 
for loss systems (which aggregates traffic streams) or with 
any state-based algorithms (which aggregate state space) 
cannot be applied. Recursion (24) is also inapplicable.  
It is obvious that the state equilibrium equations for SU 
traffic only (the columns of the diagram) would resemble the 
equations of the Erlang distribution if the unidirectional 
transitions λp were not introduced. They affect the service of 
both PU and SU calls. On the one hand the unidirectional 
transition λp in state (i, n-i) depicts the admission of a PU call 
and from this point of view it does not differ from the other 
transitions λp. On the other hand it depicts the dropping of a 
SU call and from that point of view λp could be considered as 
the departure (service) rate of one SU call. Moreover, the 
inter-arrival time of PU calls and the service time of SU calls 
are independent and identically distributed variables. Based 
on these considerations, the total effective service rate of SU 
calls in state (i, n-i) is assumed to be (n-i)µ + λp. 
Solving the state equilibrium equations for the SU traffic 
by inspecting the states in column i, Ps
i(n-i) can be obtained 
in a way very similar to the derivation of the Erlang loss 
formula. Thus, we obtain the approximation:

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, we validate by simulation experiments our 
new analytical approach for approximate evaluation of Bs 
and Bd when limitation (26) is applied. Next, we present and 
analyze some numerical results obtained via the analytical 
model described above. 
In our simulation model, we take into account all the 
essential factors required for the performance evaluation of 
the described teletraffic system, such as the Poisson PU and 
SU call arrival flows, the random service time of a call with 
negative exponential distribution, the preemptive priority of 
PU calls over SU calls, the application of limitation as a 
method for SU QoS provisioning, etc. In Table I, a 
comparison between analytical and simulation results for Bp, 
Bs and Bd is presented. The analytical results match well with 
the simulation results in all cases. This verifies and validates 
the use of approximation (33). Therefore, the proposed 
computationally efficient and simple novel approach for 
approximate evaluation of Bs and Bd when limitation is 
applied gives sufficiently precise results.  Now we proceed to 
investigate the call-level traffic capacity and the QoS 
provisioning for the SUs based on our analytical model. 
We first analyze the effect of the offered PU VoIP traffic 
Ap on the SU VoIP traffic capacity As. As Ap decreases, the 
utilization of transmission resources by PUs also decreases. 
Hence, As increases when Ap decreases, as shown in Fig. 2. 
This general relation reveals that the capacity of the CR 
network is variable and depends on the momentary PU 
activity. Therefore, CR should be deployed in primary 
networks whose transmission resources are underutilized.

traffic load without CAC limitation of SU calls. 
It is clear that a lower Bd, i.e. better SU QoS provisioning, 
could be achieved by reducing As, provided that Ap and the 
parameters of the serving system are fixed. In this case (Fig. 
2), due to the relation Bs = Bd + Bp and the stringent 
requirements on Bd, Bs is much lower than its maximum 
allowable value, which means that the QoS provisioning for 
the SUs is achieved at the price of a significant reduction in 
As. The use of limitation as a method for SU call dropping 
probability regulation enables us to achieve the SU QoS 
provisioning without severely reducing As.  
Fig. 3 shows the effect of applying limitation (26). If the 
SU CAC threshold l is relatively large (close to n), the 
performance of the serving system is very similar to its 
performance without limitation, i.e. the values of Bs and Bd 
are approximately equal. If l is relatively small and 
decreases, Bs increases and Bd decreases. It is straightforward 
that when the admissible number of SU calls in the system is 
smaller, the probability for SU call dropping is also lower 
and the probability for SU call blocking is greater. On the 
one hand the decrease in Bd improves the SU QoS 
provisioning. On the other hand the allowable increase in Bs 
improves the CR traffic capacity. Hence, if properly applied, 
limitation can improve the overall performance of the CR 
network. 
Fig. 4 shows the effect of varying l on As. There is an 
optimal value of l which maximizes As, provided that Ap and 
the parameters of the serving system are fixed. If l is 
relatively small (l < lopt) and increases, As also increases, as 
long as Bs and Bd do not exceed their threshold values. If l is 
relatively large (l > lopt and close to n), the performance of 
the serving system is very similar to its performance when 
no limitation is applied, i.e. in order to achieve the SU QoS 
provisioning, As has to be reduced considerably. Therefore, if 
the optimal value (lopt) of the SU CAC threshold is selected, 
the traffic capacity of the CR network can be maximized. 
Fig. 5 shows the relation between As and Ap when 
limitation is used and l = lopt. A comparison between Fig. 2 
and Fig. 5 confirms that if limitation is optimally applied, As 
could be significantly increased.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, an analytical model is developed for 
evaluation of the cognitive SU VoIP traffic capacity and QoS 
provisioning, namely the SU call blocking and dropping 
probabilities, in a scenario with VoIP PUs. A method (i.e. 
limitation) for achieving the required SU QoS provisioning 
by adjusting the SU call dropping probability is analyzed. A 
novel computationally efficient and simple analytical 
approach for approximate evaluation of the effect of 
applying limitation is developed and validated by simulation 
experiments. Guidelines for maximizing the CR network 
capacity by the optimal application of limitation are also 
proposed.  
Since CR utilizes dynamically unoccupied spectrum on 
an opportunistic basis, the cognitive network capacity is 
inconstant and depends on the momentary primary traffic 
load. Our study corroborates that the deployment of a 
cognitive system is reasonable only if the primary system is 
underutilized and demonstrates the feasibility of providing 
VoIP over CR.  
The analytical model presented in this paper can be 
applied to the CR resource management and especially to the 
call admission control. It can be further elaborated and 
extended to consider the effects of imperfect spectrum 
sensing and spectrum handover procedures in order to 
improve its applicability to more realistic usage scenarios. 
The model could also be incorporated into a more general 
cross-layer design framework for the purpose of various 
system-level analyses.  
For future research work, we plan to investigate 
throughput, QoS, and various cross-layer optimization issues 
in CR networks used for DSA. Our forthcoming work will be 
focused on the support of multimedia services over CR 
networks.
