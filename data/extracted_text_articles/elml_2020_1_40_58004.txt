Abstract—In today’s society, formal and non-formal education
credentials play an important role not only for holders of such
diplomas
and
degrees
but
also
for
human
resource
management processes in public and private organisations.
However, the degree of digitization in the sector is lagging, as
certificates are still paper based and verification processes are
very
time-consuming.
While
the
first
Information
&
Communication Technology (ICT) solutions in these domains
have been developed, they are still dependant on issuing
organisations
and
manual
processes.
Blockchain
is
one
technology that can be considered for developing trustworthy
solutions for digital certificates, given its native characteristics
for decentralisation, visibility and verification of transactions.
Additionally, the computational intelligence found in analytics
and decision support can help develop added value services
while
gamification
can
help
develop
more
personalised
approaches for the stakeholders of such domains. Under this
context, the present publication presents QualiChain, an
European
Union
(EU)-funded
project
that
aims
to
revolutionise the domain of public education, as well as its
interfaces with the labour market, policy making and public
sector
administrative
procedures
by
disrupting
the
way
accredited educational titles and other qualifications are
archived, managed, shared and verified.

INTRODUCTION
In an era that every single piece of information around us
is digitised and being exploited via innovative technological
solutions in a variety of value adding ways, education
certificates are largely resisting the pull of technology, as
they are still held in diverse formats in siloed databases,
often involving time consuming manual processes for their
verification [1]. In
education, certificates confirm the
achievement of certain learning outcomes and are until today
mostly issued on paper or other physical formats [2]. Paper
certificates have their advantages, such as being easy to store
and difficult to forge due to built-in security features.
However, they also create several issues, such as dependence
from accrediting authorities for their issuing and verification
as well as vulnerability to loss and damage [3]. Additionally,
lying about education and employment credentials is a
common problem, as it has become very easy to counterfeit
academic diplomas and certificates, or even “buy” degrees
from fake degree websites [4]. According to a survey by
CareerBuilder [5], a staggering 58% of employers have
caught a lie on a resume, whereas 33% of them have seen an
increase in resume embellishments and fabrications. Similar
findings arise from another survey by StatisticBrain [6],
according to which over half of resumes and job applications
contain falsifications and over three quarters are misleading.
Under these circumstances, and although fraud is not limited
to educational awards, trust in the educational certification
system is receiving significant blows [7][8].
The aforementioned challenges create problems when
education credentials are requested as a means of ratifying
decisions
regarding
either
personnel
recruitment
or
individuals’
further
admission
in
other
educational
programmes.
The
recruitment
of
personnel
by
an

organisation is a lengthy process that comes along with
combing through hundreds of candidates’ résumés, weeding
out the unqualified ones and narrowing down the rest into a
group
of potential
recruits’,
whose
qualifications
and
academic degrees have to be checked and validated on a
case-by-case basis. These challenges do not limit to the
actual task of recruiting but extend to a wider set of
processes indicatively encompassing personnel allocation
and re-allocation, staff mobility, and skills’ development and
evaluation,
most
of
which
fall
under
the
notion
of
competency management.
Disruptive technologies, such as blockchain, algorithmic
techniques, data analytics and semantics and innovative
concepts like gamification may offer solutions to these
challenges.
Particularly,
blockchain
technology,
as
a
decentralised, permanent, unalterable store of information
can help with the archiving and trust issues, as well as
provide a frictionless method for transacting with others [9]
[10], whereas computational intelligence found in the
technological
domains
of
algorithmic
techniques,
data
analytics and semantic analysis may facilitate decision
making
and
optimise
work
practices
and
procedures.
Moreover,
gamification
practices
can
help
with
user
engagement and in developing a more user-centric solution.
Under
these
circumstances,
this
publication
presents
QualiChain, a project targeting the creation, piloting and
evaluation of a distributed platform for storing, sharing and
verifying academic and employment qualifications that will
focus
on
the
assessment
of
the
potential
of
the
aforementioned combination of technologies for disrupting
the domain of education.
Section I of this publication introduces the scope of the
document and describes the challenges revolving around the
verification of education certificates. Section II introduces
the QualiChain concept and the high-level functionalities
that it is projected to have. Section III describes the
platform’s architecture and introduces the pilot use cases, in
which the platform will be applied. Finally, Section IV
concludes the document.
II.
THE QUALICHAIN CONCEPT
QualiChain is a project that aspires to investigate and
provide evidence on the transformative impact of disruptive
technologies, such as blockchain, semantics, data analytics
and gamification in the domain of public education, as well
as the interfaces of the latter with the fields of private
education, the labour market and public sector administrative
procedures. The concept and focus of the project lie more
specifically in the design, implementation, piloting and
thorough evaluation in terms of benefits, risks and other
potential
implications
of the
QualiChain
technological
solution, a distributed platform targeting the storage, sharing
and verification of academic and employment qualifications.
At this point, attention has to be drawn to the fact that
although originally inspired
from the
field
of public
education and the need to transform certificates’ archiving
and management, as well as to fight fraud around education
awards, QualiChain concept has practically a much larger
scope, as its services transcend the mere validation of
training certificates and bring forward solutions to major
challenges of both public and private interest, such as those
of lifelong learning, recruitment, mobility, better linking
education
with
the
labour
market,
etc.,
thereby
accommodating the needs of several stakeholders (see Figure
1).
Figure 1. The value of blockchain to QualiChain stakeholders [3]
In fact, QualiChain services will be structured along two
main pillars.
Figure 2. QualiChain Baseline Services
The first pillar (see Figure 2) will be grounded upon
QualiChain
main
technological
foundations,
namely
blockchain and semantics, enabling educational awards’ and
other
qualifications’
archiving
and
storing,
awards’
verification, the latter incorporating equivalence verification,
as well as qualifications’ portfolio management.

Figure 3. QualiChain Value Adding Services
The second pillar (see Figure 3) will build upon
QualiChain baseline services to offer with the help of the
computational intelligence, embodied in data analytics and
decision
support
algorithms,
as
well
as
gamification
techniques, a set of more advanced services, including career
counselling,
intelligent
profiling,
and
competency
management and within the context of the latter recruitment
and evaluation support, and consulting.
III.
ARCHITECTURE AND PILOT CASES
A.
QualiChain High-Level Architecture
QualiChain
will
deliver
an
open
source
solution,
comprising of stand-alone components and an integrated
environment to facilitate its adoption by the different
stakeholders according to their needs. To deliver the
services and functionalities prescribed in the QualiChain
concept in the previous section, the envisaged QualiChain
platform logic layer consists of 3 main components, namely
a Validation and Verification Engine, a Profiling and
Career
Management
Engine
and
a
Recruitment
and
Competency Management Engine, composed in turn by 11
modules (see Figure 4).
The
Validation
and
Verification
Engine
will
be
responsible for registering from scratch newly awarded
certificates and achievements as well as for ratifying claims
around the possession of certain awards and qualifications.
Thus, it will feature an Awards’ Registration Interface that
will enable issuing and accrediting organisations to register
new
verified
qualifications’
records
in
blockchain’s
distributed ledger, as well as a Validation Query Builder,
through which all issuing institutions, public and private
organisations, as well as individual users can set up
appropriate
validation
queries.
In
greater
detail,
the
Validation and Verification Engine is made up of the
following sub-components: i. an Equivalence Verification
Module that supports the identification and verification of
equivalent
degrees
(or
even
skills,
achievements
and
training courses), issued by different institutions, ii. a
Translation Module, capable of translating certificates from
one language to another, in case a both validated and
translated version of a certificate is required, and iii. a
Credentials’ Auditing and Verification Module, responsible
for accommodating new awards’ registrations and thus
adding new blocks to the blockchain database, as well as for
receiving users’ queries on the validation of awards and
other qualifications.
The Profiling and Career Management Engine will be
responsible
for
the
functionalities
required
for
the
management of individual users’ digital portfolio, aka
digital learning ledger where the latter can archive and
access
their
achievements,
qualifications
and
work
experience with the purpose of showcasing them to third
parties. The specific component’s functionalities are made
accessible through a Portfolio Manager Interface and are
brought to life with the help of the following modules: i. a
Verification Request Module, enabling individuals to submit
to accrediting organisations requests for the confirmation
and formal verification of their achievements, ii. a Career
Advisor Module, capable of crawling world wide web
resources and applying data mining techniques with the goal
of identifying and bringing into the individuals’ attention
job vacancies that match their profile, and iii. an Intelligent
Profiling Module, that leverages job vacancies’ elicited
requirements and synthesises accordingly individuals’ base
profile information to deliver multiple, customised versions
of their curriculum vitae.
Finally, the Recruitment and Competency Management
Engine
will
include
functionalities
for
competency
management at both strategic and tactical level addressed to
corporate users, the latter including not only education
providing institutions, but also public authorities, private
companies
and
policy
makers.
The
Recruitment
and
Competency Management Engine exposes its functionality
through the Competency Management Advisor Interface
which makes up the entry point to the following sub-
components:
i.
a
Recruits’
Profile
Designer
Module,
enabling recruiters to designate the criteria that candidates
should meet, and thereby specify the type and level
education, work experience and the rest of qualifications
that they should possess as well as any other conditions and
requirements they ought to fulfil, ii. a Qualifications’
Screening and Matching Module, capable of retrieving
18

eLmL 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

applicants’ credentials and juxtaposing these with recruiters’
criteria to sort out a subset of appropriate candidates, iii. a
Selection
and
Recruiting
Module,
applying
advanced
decision support algorithms on the subset of qualified
candidates, to optimise candidate selection and allocation in
corporate
positions,
iv.
a
Competency
Development,
Evaluation and Gap Identification Module, responsible for
keeping track of employees’ qualifications records and
identifying competency deficit in relation to organisations’
mid and long-term horizon goals and v. an Advanced
Decision
Support
Module,
featuring
a
variety
of
sophisticated data analytics, i.e., data mining, statistics’
calculation, pattern/ trend recognition, data visualisation and
other functionalities of both descriptive and prescriptive
character, to support insights acquisition and informed
decision making.
Figure 4. QualiChain Value Adding Services
From
an
end-user
perspective
and
regarding
the
QualiChain platform presentation layer, the solution lays
emphasis
on
intuitiveness
and
features
beside
the
aforementioned
management
interfaces,
appropriate
authentication and authorisation interfaces for all targeted
stakeholder
groups,
namely
accrediting
institutions,
individuals and corporate users. Finally, the QualiChain data
access layer envisages storage and retrieval of data from
blockchain records regarding awards and qualifications, as
well as from the web to the extent related statistics, job
postings
and
other
learning
and
career
development
opportunities are concerned.
B.
QualiChain Pilot Use Cases
To test and validate the projected platform in its
respective domains, it will be implemented in four distinct
pilot use cases split between academia, private and public
organisations. Specifically, the QualiChain pilots are the
following:
1)
Cross University Degree Equivalence Verification
Within this pilot use case, QualiChain will develop a
methodology for representing the semantics of educational
credentials, to support cross-institution and cross-context
mapping between different forms of certifications. Existing
vocabularies that describe learning goals and topics will be
reused and extended to build a detailed knowledge model
describing the entities relevant to educational accreditation
and their relationships to each other, in the form of an
ontology. This pilot will engage lifelong learners, students,
job seekers and educational institutions.
2)
Smart Curriculum Design and University Process
Optimisation
This use case will be implemented in the School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering of the NTUA. It will
take advantage of QualiChain’s analytics and decision
support capabilities to analyse the current skill level of
students, the school’s curriculum and the labour market’s
requirements for the school’s graduates to provide decision
support
for
optimising
the
school’s
curriculum.
Additionally, this pilot will leverage the blockchain ledger
to verify student skills and qualifications with smart badges.
This pilot will engage undergraduate and Ph.D. students of
the school as well as professors and administrative bodies.

3)
Staffing the Public Sector
This pilot use case lies in using the QualiChain platform
and services for supporting and simplifying public sector
recruitment
and
competency
management
procedures.
Given that recruitment in public administration must be
based on the principles of impartiality, transparency and
fairness, this pilot will leverage the platform’s blockchain to
manage and verify the applications and other supporting
documents
submitted
by
candidates.
Additionally,
the
recruitment
and
competency
management
services
of
QualiChain will be used to automate applications’ checking
and candidates’ assessment and selection procedures, and
respectively
for
supporting
decisions
related
to
the
allocation of human resources within the public sector or
employee mobility issues. This pilot will engage public
administrations, recruitment firms, employees, job seekers
and issuing organisations.
4)
Provision
of
HR
Consulting
and
Competency
Management Services
This pilot will explore blockchain for easily checking and
ensuring the availability of certain competencies in an
individual curriculum. Also, data analytics methodologies
and algorithms will be applied for the effective matching of
skills, qualifications and competencies with job description
requirements, not only for external selection, but also for
internal mobility. Semantic technologies will be used to
support
corporate
training
and
carrier
management,
throughout the entire individuals’ job evolution. This pilot
will engage public entities looking for new applicants,
candidates and public workers.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
This publication presented QualiChain, a project aiming
to develop a decentralised platform for storing, sharing and
verifying academic and employment qualifications. Despite
the fact that the project is still at an early stage, it has
gathered the interest of the research community due to the
innovative combination of technologies that it will leverage
and the fact that it aims to create value to all stakeholders in
the domains tackled. This is also reflected in the complexity
of QualiChain’s technical solution and the number of
distinct pilot cases in which it will be implemented. The
innovation potential of QualiChain is very strong, as it
focuses on a domain, that of education credentials, that has
largely resisted the pool of technology and where the
improvement potential in the processes of certificates’
archiving, management and verification, the information
flow amongst stakeholders and the opportunity for offering
value
adding
services
on
top
of the
aforementioned
processes and developing new business and education
models is literally huge. Disrupting any (or even more than
one) of the aforementioned aspects can lead to substantial
efficiency, productivity and transparency impacts, which
should in turn have noticeable positive societal, economic,
political and cultural effects.
