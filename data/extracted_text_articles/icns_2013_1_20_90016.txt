Abstract- Because of the enormous growth in Information 
Technology (IT) over the past 20 years, an abundance of job 
opportunity requirements for a variety of IT specialists in 
high technology corporations and the U. S. Federal 
Government is apparent and is continually growing.  George 
Mason University (Mason), with over 33,000 students 
enrolled located in Northern Virginia, has become the focal 
point for educating IT professionals to fill this need. 
Recognizing this opportunity, in 2005, Mason became a 
Cisco Regional Academy not only because of prestige and 
recognition, but also to add value to the networking 
concentration of the undergraduate IT degree of the 
Department of Applied IT (AIT). Now, the Academy has 45 
active Cisco Academies from Virginia, Maryland and 
Washington, DC areas. This year Cisco shared their 
upcoming Academy restructuring initiative with Mason, and 
asked whether the university is receptive to this transition in 
becoming a Cisco Academy Support Center (ASC) and 
Instructor Training Center (ITC). Mason has been 
successful in the role of a Regional Academy, and was 
positive toward Cisco’s offer. This year, Mason has officially 
become an ASC that will serve 55 Cisco Academies in the 
State of Virginia and is in the process of becoming an ITC in 
May 2013. In this paper, we give a background of our 
partnership with Cisco Networking Academy, describe how 
we became a successful partner by blending Academy 
courses with AIT undergraduate degree curriculum and 
mentoring Local Academies, the transition process involved 
in becoming an ASC, and the added coverage and challenges 
Mason faces in the future. We also discuss the role of 
distance 
education 
(DE) 
on 
two 
important 
data 
communications courses of the undergraduate IT degree 
curriculum, because most of the materials of Cisco Certified 
Network Associate (CCNA) part I and II are taught in these 
courses.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
There has been tremendous growth in the IT job sector. 
This is particularly true for the Washington, DC 
metropolitan area. Mason is located in the high-tech 
Northern Virginia corridor, and its Department of Applied 
IT (AIT) is always busy updating its curriculum and 
courses to meet the challenging and changing demands of 
the industry, to enable its graduates secure good jobs and 
move forward with a promising career. This is why the 
AIT department, during the summer of 2004, agreed to the  
proposition of the Cisco National Initiative Manager to 
sponsor a Cisco Regional Academy. Being part of the 
successful Engineering School, AIT department has to 
produce graduates with solid technical and hands-on skills 
to meet the stringent needs of the practical working 
environment. The department envisioned this to be an 
effective partnership that would enrich its curriculum and 
enhance its visibility to the high school, and two-year 
college transfer technical students. The School Dean saw 
this as an opportunity and was receptive to this 
collaboration, and extended his support with School 
resources, including a new full-time position to coordinate 
this Academy. An experienced networking professional 
with a long career in the telecommunications industry 
joined the AIT faculty to dedicate 50% of his time to 
create and manage Mason’s Cisco Regional Academy. 
With a seasoned fellow networking instructor, the new 
instructor began formal instructor certification studies and 
coordinated the recruitment of Local Academies with the 
Area Cisco Academy Manager. Mason built a template 
and foundation for its Regional Academy with support 
from the Cisco Academy Training Center Manager [1].     
 
At that time, the Bachelor of Science degree in Applied 
IT had about 900 students with about 200 annual 
graduates. During Academic Year 2011-2012, the program 
had about 1,200 students with over 300 graduates. A large 
percentage of the students select Networking and 
Telecommunications (NTEL) concentration curriculum, 
out of the five concentration areas of the degree program. 
Students are required to complete five courses from a list 
of courses in the concentration area of their choice. In 
NTEL, the second of the two networking courses of the 
degree program, Advanced Networking Principles (IT 
445), is on the list. The first networking course is Data 
Communications and Networking Principles (IT 341), and 
is a core and required course of the degree program. 
Mason also has a thriving Cisco Local Academy primarily 
due to the alignment of these two networking courses with 
the Academy. At first, students were able to enroll to 
Mason’s Local Academy on a voluntary basis, but that did 
not achieve positive results because from fall semester of 
2007 to the fall semester of 2008, 89 students enrolled in 
8

the Cisco networking curricula and only 41 completed the 
course.  
II. 
PROGRESS 
 
Since becoming a Cisco Regional Academy in 2005, 
and until becoming an Academy Support Center (ASC) in 
May 2012, Mason had 16 Local Academies in its 
jurisdiction that includes Arlington, Loudon, Fairfax, 
Shenandoah, Warren, Prince William, and Frederick 
counties in Virginia, Howard University in Washington, 
DC, and Marymount University in Virginia. There were 14 
Local Academies with Mason’s Regional Academy until 
the addition of two new Local Academies in 2012. They 
are Northern Virginia Community College System’s 
Manassas and Alexandria campuses. The growth in the 
Regional Academy has been supported by the demand for 
IT system engineers and design specialists with AS and 
BS degrees and industry certifications.   
 
It was determined, at first, to offer the Cisco 
Networking course as a separate Mason Local Academy 
course where students could voluntarily enroll with the 
objective of becoming a CCNA [5]. However, due to low 
voluntary enrollment in the Local Academy because the 
students were burdened with other AIT courses, we 
blended considerable material of CCNA part I to the core 
IT 341 networking course content, and made compulsory 
enrollment of IT 341 students in Mason’s Local Academy 
Exploration Fundamentals course. This expanded the 
horizon for the students because they now had access to 
the powerful virtual network configuration software 
PacketTracer [2]. Here is a brief background on the 
reasons for the shift toward the virtual lab configuration 
exercises. Mason’s network lab is equipped with 40 
workstations, and kits having two routers and one switch 
each with all the necessary cables. Four students share 
each kit. This lets the students build the network from 
scratch by configuring the routers and switch from the 
console port, and use straight-through and crossover cables 
for the interfaces. Due to the unanticipated demand of the 
BS in IT degree program, enrollment grew rapidly, which 
prompted the need for several sections of IT 341. Each 
class section has a capacity of 38 students, and to run 
simultaneous sections it was a toll on the network 
equipment. Students of each section had to configure the 
routers and switches, and save their configurations on a 
flash drive, because students of the next section would 
configure the equipment erasing the configuration of the 
previous class. The wear and tear of the equipment became 
apparent with the Cisco Internet Operating System (IOS) 
failing frequently. Unnecessary amount of time was spent 
to redundantly configure the network at the beginning of 
each lab, because the students already did the set-up 
configuration during their first lab session. Further time 
was spent to dismantle the network, and pack up the kit for 
the next class. The instructors and teaching assistants were 
also spending a good amount of time trouble shooting 
equipment failures and reinstalling the IOS on routers and 
switches. The following photo of Fig. 1 depicts students 
configuring a router. 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Students busy configuring a router 
 
It was determined Cisco’s PacketTracer, a virtual client 
software application, could replace the use of actual 
hardware and could address the previously noted 
problems. The desktop software makes it possible to build 
complex networks by merely clicking and dragging 
components onto a desktop configuration as specified in 
the laboratory manual and then configuring each 
component using the Cisco’s command line interface 
(CLI) syntax. By making enrollment in the Local 
Academy Exploration Fundamentals course a part of the 
curriculum course, students could download and install 
this virtual network configuration software to work on 
their lab exercises, after completion of configuration 
exercises using physical equipment from the kit during the 
initial three lab sessions. The kits are still in use in the first 
three lab sessions because they give the students hands-on 
configuration opportunity in preparation for the real world 
environment. Fig. 2 depicts a typical PacketTracer 
desktop.

Table 1 data makes it evident that voluntary student 
enrollment was low. Refer to Table 2 for the significant 
jump in enrollment numbers once this was made 
mandatory. The course completion success rate more than 
doubled, which is an indication that the students took the 
course seriously. This is because with students completing 
the Exploration Fundamentals segment [3], the Local 
Academy course completion became almost certain. The 
effect was quite similar with instructor training, because 
there was a direct relationship between student enrollment  
and number of instructors that needed training. After the 
inception of the Regional Academy, many high school 
visits were made to meet the instructors of the Local 
Academies, and it was discovered that there was a need to 
train new instructors because many of the existing 
educators left or were leaving to work for the industry.  
During those visits, we noticed the lab equipment in the 
Local Academies were dated and needed replacement 
soon. The visits to the Local Academies helped Mason’s 
Regional Academy [4] initiate a Local Academy 
Instructors Training Program.

The Training Program also made recommendations to 
the school administrators for upgrading their lab 
equipment. Table 3 presents the data of Instructor 
Training Program for the spring 2007 to fall 2008 period. 
Table 4 results show there was a rise in the number of 
instructor training with increased enrollments, because it 
was necessary to have more qualified instructors at Mason 
to teach the Academy Program. To accomplish this, we 
set up Fast Track instructor courses for additional 
instructors and teaching assistants for the Regional 
Academy, and graduated all to support our IT 341 and IT 
445 courses since the spring semester of 2009. CCNA  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certification adds tremendous value to our graduates of 
AIT degree with NTEL concentration. 
 
It would be overwhelming for the students if IT 341 
alone would cover most of the content of CCNA part I and 
II. This prompted us to develop the second networking 
course, which is better known as the Advanced 
Networking Principles (IT 445) course. This covers most 
of the lecture and lab materials of CCNA part II, and it is 
not a required class like IT 341 for the AIT majors, 
because this is one of the NTEL concentration courses that 
the students have the option to take. The students who

have interest with the networking career enroll in IT 445 
because their goal is to become CCNA certified. 
Enrollment of IT 445 has been gradually growing since it 
was first offered in fall 2007. Due to popular demand, we 
have offered a second section of IT 445 in spring 2013,   
which is a distance education (DE) course.   
 
III. 
DISTANCE EDUCATION (DE) 
 
There are two general categories of DE delivery 
methods: 1) Asynchronous and 2) Synchronous. With 
asynchronous, some instructors choose to record lectures 
that are stored in a server or prepare lessons as web pages. 
Students access the server at their convenience to retrieve 
the lectures. Home assignments, exams and other class 
materials are also uploaded to the server. Synchronous 
distance learning is similar to in-class sessions. This is 
because students attend online classes during the class time. 
They participate in lectures, view slide presentations and 
interact with the instructor and other students via the 
Internet. This creates an environment where the students 
feel they are attending a live classroom without having to 
actually go to a classroom. It is worth noting, video 
streaming is generally not mandatory since synchronous 
video with DE delivery has several tradeoffs and 
challenges [12]. High capacity network services are 
required for reliable video stream [13]. Further, audio and 
video are sometimes not synchronized which lead to 
confusion since lip movement and audio being heard is not 
always the same. Also, low video resolution that is required 
to conserve network capacity and small display screens of 
Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Synchronous 
Distance Education Tools (SDET) do not show clear view 
of facial expressions that enable better understanding, 
which is the main argument for video in the first place [14].  
 
Research shows that problems arise when students do not 
get the opportunity to interact with the instructor and other 
students while they are in an asynchronous learning 
environment. Some students are confused about the 
assignments and course objectives, and feel frustrated and 
isolated. On the other hand, despite the challenges 
associated with synchronous education, it approximates 
face-to-face dialog and promotes a sense of community. 
Overall student outcomes also are better with synchronous 
education over asynchronous learning. This is because 
students are motivated since synchronous education makes 
the courses more engaging [12]. Characteristics of 
synchronous and asynchronous DE delivery are presented 
in Table 5. 
 
DE LMS and SDET must offer a user-friendly 
graphical user interface, simple navigation options, and 
have enhanced security features to deter unauthorized 
access to the system and files. Course creation and 
management has to be easy, and the system must support 
common file types. There has to be an option to reuse 
course contents so instructors are able to reuse contents in 
other sections of the same course or during another 
semester with minor modifications.

Early research suggests web users need to be provided 
with an effective usable environment because it drives 
substantial savings and achieves better performance. In 
academia, effective LMS and SDET need little instructor 
time to set up and manage the course, improving the 
learning experience of students. It is important for the 
LMS and SDET to be not cluttered with too many 
appealing design options as that may integrate with 
features in course design, which can be confusing for 
students and the instructor. Only features that meet course 
objectives 
and 
are 
relevant 
to 
a 
sound-learning 
environment for designing an effective course should be 
included in the LMS and SDET. Since usability is critical, 
the LMS and SDET must be easy-to-use and learn, and 
offer options that are easy-to-remember. Web usability 
requires having web pages that are easy-to-navigate and 
display information in an organized manner so users do 
not have to struggle to find what they are looking for. 
Pedagogical usability ensures users learn effectively and 
retain the skills and knowledge, and is integrated with 
technology usability, which is referred to ease-of-use and 
usefulness of the technology [16]. Students do not have a 
high degree of pedagogical usability when technology 
usability is poor. 
 
To comply with the directives of leadership, all 
Colleges, Schools and Departments started offering at least 
one DE section of the live in-class sections of a course. 
We were in the forefront in implementing this initiative by 
offering two asynchronous DE sections of IT 341 
alongside two live in-class sections. We hope to add 
synchronous lectures to these courses in the upcoming 
semesters. The Cisco Academy website [3] has been 
supplemental to the DE and in-class live sections, where 
students take online Exploration Fundamentals segment 
exams that are graded on a real-time basis and recorded in 
Blackboard (Bb) [6] gradebook. Bb is widely used as a 
LMS and SDET by many course sections university-wide 
as we do in our AIT department. The home assignments 
12

ICNS 2013 : The Ninth International Conference on Networking and Services

and lab exercises are submitted online in Bb. Camtasia 
Studio [7] is used to video the lecture and lab session 
recordings, which are posted in Bb for students to view 
during their time of convenience. The Discussion Board of 
Bb is heavily used to make the DE class interactive. All 
lecture and lab assignment, and exam release and due 
dates are announced via the Announcement feature of Bb, 
and also communicated via Mason email system with the 
students. At present, students are required to come to 
campus for the midterm and final examinations, but we 
will implement online exams for the DE sections in fall 
2013.   
 
IV. 
TRANSITION TO ACADEMY SUPPORT 
CENTER (ASC) 
 
This section covers a brief background of why Mason 
decided to become an ASC, and its roles and 
responsibilities as an ASC. It was envisioned by becoming 
an ASC, Mason would support 55 current Cisco Local 
Academies in the state of Virginia. As a Regional 
Academy, we were supporting only 16 Local Academies, 
now named Cisco Academies as changed by the Evolution 
Program. Our university is also a partner in the 4-VA 
Initiative that was initiated by our president and the 
presidents of James Madison University, University of 
Virginia, and Virginia Tech University. 4-VA was 
established in 2011 in response to the Governors’ Higher 
Education Commission recommendations to find methods 
to collaborate to meet for higher quality and affordable 
education 
focusing 
on 
the 
Science, 
Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. Cisco 
Systems, Inc. is a solid partner in this program by 
providing its TelePresence Systems at many sites on the 
four university campuses. TelePresence will be used to 
achieve the goals to improve communications efficiency. 
This will enhance student success, sharing the delivery of 
course strategies to improve sharing course strategies to 
Virginia’s economic development, and increasing each 
university’s research competiveness. During the transition 
period in becoming an ASC, we realized distance 
education at our proposed ASC will be improved by 
reaching out to the Cisco Academies’ audio-visual 
facilities utilizing our TelePresence facilities where our 
agendas will include Academy teaching and technology 
updates, conduct seminars, share student’s success stories 
and course experiences. If some Academies do not have 
audio-visual facilities, we planned to use WebEx [8] 
communications in a point-to-multipoint configuration. In 
May of 2012, we officially became a Cisco ASC, and to 
date we have 45 Cisco Academies throughout Virginia.  
 
As a member of an ASC, Mason specializes and excels 
in preparing and enhancing the success and sustainability 
of the Network Academies in the Commonwealth of 
Virginia. Our efforts have a positive effect on academy 
administrators, instructors, and students. We provide 
essential operational support to academies in a relevant 
format. Localized operational support is essential 
throughout an Academy’s engagement starting with 
onboarding and throughout their lifecycle.  
 
Our ASC provides Cisco Academies in a number of 
ways, including but not limited to the following major 
services: 
• 
In-person visits for lectures, consultation and/or 
support. 
• 
Remote consultation, troubleshooting and 
monitoring via telephone, email, and/or other 
technology. 
• 
Access to training using TelePresence, webinars, 
and/or presentations. 
• 
Access to ASC Information Portal. 
• 
Invitation to an Annual Meeting to sharpen 
teaching skills and disseminate new customer 
programs. 
• 
Support with continuation of Cisco Membership 
Agreement and the responsibilities described in 
the Agreement. 
There are two required roles at an ASC: 1) Academy 
Support Center Contact (one required); and (2) Support 
Advisor (two required). A person can be both an Academy 
Support Center Contact and a Support Advisor, or two 
separate individuals can fulfill these roles. These ASC 
roles primarily interact with Academy Contacts and 
Academy Success Leads at Cisco Academies. They also 
interact with the following Cisco roles:  
• 
Area Academy Manager (AAM)  
• 
Cisco Quality Manager (CQM)  
• 
Global Support Desk CSR  
 
The ASC Contact is responsible for managing the 
annual membership. This is achieved by securing 
appropriate institution administrator to sign the online 
ASC membership. The individual is also responsible for 
updating the ASC profile, and ensure compliance with 
Cisco policies and minimum standards as outlined in the 
Membership Guide. Other roles are to develop the Annual 
ASC Plan, document any support focus areas, review 
feedback from Academies Mason supports, address plans 
to improve any unsatisfactory performance areas, and 
ensure services and support are marketed/advertised using 
technologies provided.  Academies require support 
throughout their lifecycle. The type of support varies 
depending on the maturity of the Academy. The Support 
Advisors are knowledgeable about all areas of Academy 
operation. They are the channels that Cisco uses to ensure 
critical operational messages are received and understood 
by the Academies. Cisco provides ongoing educational

opportunities for Support Advisors to ensure ASCs have 
the information they need to be successful. 
 
As a result of the Cisco Academy Evolution Program, 
Mason’s former Regional Academy responsibilities are 
now being undertaken in our new status as an ASC. To 
become an ASC we were required to submit our 
application along with a Business Plan to Cisco for review. 
Approval was granted in May of 2012. In addition, Mason 
will become an Instructor Training Center (ITC) in May of 
2013. This is important because we have a large number of 
students enrolled in the networking courses that require 
several teaching assistants (TAs) to assist the professors in 
the delivery of the courses. It would facilitate the process 
of training and proctoring exams for the TAs and our local 
Cisco academy instructors in becoming Cisco Networking 
Academy instructors on an on-going basis without having 
to depend on other ITCs. We plan to have three Instructors 
take Cisco’s new rigorous Instructor Training Program. 
Instructor trainers are required to take a pre-test and two 
days of professional in-person training. 
 
V. 
RESEARCH 
Since the inception of becoming a Regional Academy 
in 2005 we had a major obstactle in offering the Cisco 
CCNA courses into an academic university environment. 
Our first approach was to offer the Cisco courses as they 
stand to our academic accreditation committee. This effort 
was rejected based on the premise that the courses were of 
an apprentice hands-on experience more likely to be 
offered at a technical school level. To amiliorate this 
objection, we researched The Association of Technology, 
Management, and Applied Engineering [11] to compare 
the CCNA course material to their standards and found 
that the Cisco courses matched the standard IT 
components. With this knowledge, we decided to insert 
components of the Cisco courses into our IT341 and 
IT445 courses and academically enhance each by 
inserting essay exercises to ensure that the students were 
understanding the concepts. 
Still to be researched, is the effect of the Evolution 
Program 
organizational 
structure 
change 
and 
the 
transition from the Academy Connection to NetSpace. 
Our initial observations and research, not documented, 
found that academies had the usual objections to change. 
The former Cisco Academy Training Center (CATC), 
Regional, and Local Academy structure appeared to be 
quite adequate in delivering the Cisco course material. 
The CATCs that were formerly finacially supported by 
Cisco and Regional Centers found that they needed either 
to convert to an Instructor Training Center (ITC) charging 
a fee for training courses and/or an Academy Support 
Center (ASC) charging an annual support fee to Local 
Academies. Complicating this issue, is the competitive 
aspect of former Regional Centers that converted to 
Academy Support Centers (ASC) are now in competition 
with each other to enroll academies to capture the annual 
fees. Each ASC is now charging fees as a business center 
to cover their costs.. Almost all Local Academies, now 
renamed Cisco Academies, never paid for support before 
and found this financially onerous. In addition, this 
expenditure was not forecast in their annual 2012 
operational school budgets. This is resulting in the school 
system’s administrations’  seeking an ASC with the 
lowest fee. 
 
The change from the Academy Connection to NetSpace 
concurrent with the Evolution Program is now being 
undertaken. Complications are prevalent in that both the 
Academy Connection and new NetSpace learning sites 
are operational at the same time with a phase out plan for 
the Academy Connection by mid year 2013. Instructors 
are now offering courses in both systems and learning 
how to use NetSpace.  
 
The intended research to be accomplished will 
determine if these changes prove to enhance IT 
knowledge, and increase the number of students achieving 
Cisco Certifications resulting in successful exceptional 
challenging 
occupations 
and 
career 
promotional 
opportunities for them.  The methodology to perform this 
research may use surveys, interviews, and a compilation of 
data and statistics. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
 
In summary, our graduates receiving the BS in Applied 
Information Technology benefit from the School’s 
adaptation to include most of the content of the Cisco 
Exploration course in our IT 341 and IT 445 courses. To 
satisfy the academic requirements of a university, our 
students are required to provide twelve technical essays 
for these two courses.  Our students also receive strong 
courses in the study of IT wireless and Internet Protocol 
(IP) telephony. We are considering adding Cisco Certified 
Network Professional (CCNP) and network security 
content to our Master of Science degree program 
networking and security courses in the near future. A 
student who has completed the NTEL concentration can 
take the CCNA examination at our certification testing 
center.  To promote certification, our School is a Pearson 
View Certification Testing Center where our students and 
faculty can take certification examinations at a much 
reduced fee.  The ultimate goal of Mason is to prepare our 
students for careers in this most abundant IT job 
opportunity domain of Metropolitan Washington, DC. For 
an example of Virginia IT occupational opportunities
