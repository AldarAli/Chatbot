Abstract—In this study, we compare Japanese, English, Spanish,
Portuguese, and French tweets submitted to Twitter and discuss
how we use unsounded code strings at the end of online messages.
We ﬁrst deﬁne unsounded codes and unsounded code strings.
Next, we compare and discuss the usage of unsounded code strings
at the end of tweets, especially, to general public and particular
persons. Finally, we show the receiver of a tweet, whether general
public or a particular person, is a factor that affects the usage
of unsounded code strings at the end of Japanese tweets, but
not English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets. Speciﬁcally,
Japanese speakers use unsounded code strings at the end of tweets
more frequently to particular persons than to general public while
English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French speakers do not.
Keywords–unsounded code string; Twitter; general public; par-
ticular persons; non verbal communication.

INTRODUCTION
Many of us think that it is easy to understand the meanings
of non verbal expressions in online messages even if different
language speakers generate them. However, the usage differs
between different language speakers and the difference is at
risk of bringing unnecessary frictions between them. As a
result, it is important to consider the difference, especially, in
multilingual computer-mediated communication (CMC) sys-
tems. To solve this problem, we showed the usage of un-
sounded code strings, one kind of non verbal expression,
differs between Japanese and English speakers and discuss a
factor that affects the usage of them [1].
We often ﬁnd consecutive unsounded marks and characters
are used at the end of online messages, such as mails, chattings,
and tweets in Twitter.
(exp 1)
I’m freezing!!!!
(exp 2) @ryuuuuuuuu 2012 soushita hou ga iiyo.......
(@ryuuuuuuuu 2012 you had better do it.......)
(exp 1) and (exp 2) are tweets submitted to Twitter. (exp
1) was submitted by an user who chose English as his/her
language for tweets. On the other hand, (exp 2) was submitted
by an user who chose Japanese as his/her language for tweets.
Both (exp 1) and (exp 2) have consecutive unsounded marks
at the end of them. These unsounded marks are used for
smooth communication. The submitter of (exp 1) is thought
to use the three consecutive exclamation marks for expressing
his/her impression strongly. On the other hand, the submitter
of (exp 2) is thought to use the seven consecutive periods
for expressing his/her opinion softly. In this study, we deﬁne
unsounded marks and characters as unsounded codes. Further-
more, we deﬁne three or more consecutive unsounded codes
as a unsounded code string. For example, in Twitter, 14 % of
Japanese tweets and 10 % of English tweets have unsounded
code strings at the end of them. Although unsounded code
strings are popular, there are few studies on them. As a result,
in this study, we investigate how we use unsounded code
strings at the end of tweets in Twitter. Especially, we compare
Japanese, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets in
Twitter and discuss a factor that affects the usage of unsounded
code strings at the end of tweets. The results of this study will
give us a chance to understand the usage of unsounded code
strings and improve multilingual CMC systems.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we deﬁne
unsounded code strings and describes how they are used at
the end of tweets in Twitter. Finally, in Section IV, we present
our conclusions.

RELATED WORKS
There are a considerable number of studies comparing
speakers of various languages from various viewpoints, such
as, pragmatics, cognitive science, and so on. These studies can
be classiﬁed into two types:
•
studies comparing native speakers of one language to
non-native speakers of the same language
•
studies comparing native speakers of one language to
native speakers of other language directly
This study is classiﬁed into the latter. It is because we compare
unsounded code strings in one language tweets to those in other
language tweets directly.
In pragmatics, a considerable number of studies have
been made on interlanguage speech acts, such as, expressing
compliments [2], apologies [3], gratitude [4], politeness [5],
and refusals [6]. In these studies, native speakers of one
language were compared to non-native speakers of the same
language. Also, there are a considerable number of studies
comparing pauses and backchannels of native speakers to those
of non-native speakers. Backchannels are listener’s responses,
such as “uh-huh” and “yeah”, given while someone else
is talking, to show an interest, attention, or willingness to
keep listening. Deschamps investigated how French learners of
English made pauses in their English speeches [7]. Bil´a and
D˘zambov´a investigated the function of silent pauses in native
and non-native speakers of English and German [8]. Ishizaki
investigated how English, French, Chinese and Korean learners
of Japanese and native Japanese speakers made pauses in their
Japanese speeches [9]. Tavakoli reported that the location of
pauses is important in comparisons of native speakers and

foreign learners [10]. Okazawa reported that native Japanese
speakers paused roughly twice as often in their English utter-
ances than in their Japanese utterances [11]. LoCastro reported
that Japanese speakers often feel uncomfortable when speak-
ing English because they are unable to use the appropriate
backchannels [12]. From the viewpoint of cognitive science,
Tera et al. compared and analyzed reading processes of native
Japanese speakers and foreign learners of Japanese [13].
On the other hand, there are also a considerable number of
studies comparing native speakers of one language to native
speakers of other language directly. Especially, many studies
have been made on backchannels. It is because backchan-
nels are found in various languages. Maynard showed that
backchannel phenomena for Japanese and English differ in
terms of type, frequency, and context [14]. Miller reported
that Japanese speakers use backchannels more frequently
than English speakers [15]. However, in most of previous
studies, the frequency of backchannels were observed in
various situations while little is known about factors that
affect the frequency of backchannels. Chen pointed out that
it is important to investigate factors that affect the frequency
of backchannels and took White’s work [16] for example
[17]. White reported that Americans used backchannels more
frequently in conversations with Japanese than in conversations
with other Americans [16]. In other words, the conversation
partner, whether American or Japanese, is a factor that affects
the frequency of Americans’ backchannels. As a result, when
we compare different language speakers, it is important to
investigate factors providing different responses between them.
In this study, we investigate a factor that affects the usage of
unsounded code strings at the end of tweets.

UNSOUNDED CODE STRINGS AT THE END OF
JAPANESE, ENGLISH, SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, AND
FRENCH TWEETS IN TWITTER
In this section, we compare and discuss the usage of un-
sounded code strings at the end of Japanese, English, Spanish,
Portuguese, and French tweets. In Section III-A, we deﬁne
unsounded code strings and show how they are used at the end
of tweets. In Section III-B, we show the investigation object
of this study. Finally, in Section III-C, we compare Japanese,
English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets and discuss a
factor that affects the usage of unsounded code strings at the
end of tweets.
A. The deﬁnition of an unsounded code string
First, we deﬁne unsounded codes and unsounded code
strings. In this study, we deﬁne that an unsounded code string
is three or more consecutive unsounded codes. In this study,
unsounded codes in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French
text are limited to
•
punctuation marks (e.g., !#$%&.,:;<=>?@ (){}).
On the other hand, unsounded codes in Japanese text are
limited to the following marks and characters:
•
punctuation marks,
•
Greek characters,
•
Cyrillic characters, and
•
ruled lines.
It is because these marks and characters are generally un-
sounded when they are used at the end of Japanese sentences.
Next, we show how unsounded code strings are used at the
end of tweets. Twitter users often use unsounded code strings
in order to enable anyone to understand their tweets clearly
and avoid unnecessary frictions with others.

homework doooooooooooone!!!!!!!!!!)

WEIRDEST dream last night omg...
For example, the submitters used exclamation marks consec-
utively at the end of (exp 3) and (exp 4) for expressing their
feelings strongly. On the other hand, the submitter used periods
consecutively at the end of (exp 5) for expressing his/her
impression softly.
We may note that some submitters use unsounded code
strings not for expressing their feelings or intentions clearly.
For example, Twitter users are prohibited to post the same
tweets repeatedly. To avoid this constraint, some users use un-
sounded code strings. For example, (exp 6), (exp 7), and (exp
8) were posted consecutively in a few seconds to a particular
user, ssuzuki16, beyond the limit of repeated submission.

B. The investigation object
We obtained tweets by using the streaming API [18].
However, the streaming API allows us to obtain only 1% of
all public streamed tweets because of API restriction. We used
the streaming API and obtained 56,483,681 tweets in three
weeks in November and December 2012. The obtained tweets
included the following tweets.
•
31,253,241 tweets submitted by users who chose En-
glish as their language for tweets. In this study, we
call these tweets English tweets.
•
7,254,205 tweets submitted by users who chose Span-
ish as their language for tweets. In this study, we call
these tweets Spanish tweets.
•
7,085,267 tweets submitted by users who chose
Japanese as their language for tweets. In this study,
we call these tweets Japanese tweets.
•
3,101,308 tweets submitted by users who chose Por-
tuguese as their language for tweets. In this study, we
call these tweets Portuguese tweets.
•
1,075,959 tweets submitted by users who chose
French as their language for tweets. In this study, we
call these tweets French tweets.
Only these ﬁve language tweets were more than 1,000,000
tweets. Other language tweets (e.g., German and Italian tweets)
were less than 1,000,000 tweets. Figure 1 shows the percentage
of English, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, and French tweets
in the obtained tweets. These tweets can be classiﬁed into three
types:
•
reply
A reply is submitted to a particular person (Figure 2).
It contains “@username” in the body of the tweet. For
example, (exp 2) and (exp 4) are replies.

November and December 2012).
•
retweet
A retweet is a reply to a tweet that includes the original
tweet.
•
normal tweet
A normal tweet is neither reply nor retweet. For
example, (exp 1), (exp 3), and (exp 5) are normal
tweets. Twitter users generally submit their tweets to
general public. As a result, most of normal tweets are
submitted to general public (Figure 3).
Figure 4 shows the percentages of normal tweets, replies,
and retweets in the obtained Japanese, English, Spanish,
Portuguese, and French tweets. From the obtained Japanese
tweets, we extracted 966,187 Japanese tweets that have un-
sounded code strings at the end of them. These 966,187
Japanese tweets are 13.64% of all the Japanese tweets. On the
other hand, from the obtained English tweets, we extracted
3,270,821 English tweets that have unsounded code strings at
the end of them. These 3,270,821 English tweets are 10.47%
of all the English tweets. Figure 5 shows the percentages
of the obtained Japanese, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and
French tweets that have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. Furthermore, Figure 6 shows the percentages of normal
tweets, replies, and retweets in the obtained Japanese, English,
Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets that have unsounded
code strings at the end of them.
In this study, we do not discuss unsounded code strings
at the end of retweets. It is because, messages in retweets
are created not by submitters, but by other users. As a result,
retweets are inadequate to investigate how we use unsounded
code strings at the end of online messages.
In this study, we compare unsounded code strings at the
end of (1) normal tweets and (2) replies. It is because we
intend to compare and discuss the usage of unsounded code
strings at the end of tweets to general public and particular
persons. As mentioned, normal tweets are generally submitted
Figure 2. A reply is submitted to a particular person.
Figure 3. A normal tweet is submitted to general public.
to general public. On the other hand, each reply is submitted
to a particular person.
C. The comparison of the usage of unsounded code strings at
the end of Japanese and English tweets
Japanese tweets differs greatly from English, Spanish, Por-
tuguese, and French tweets. For example, Kanji characters, Hi-
ragana letters, and Katakana leters are mainly used in Japanese
tweets while alphabetical letters are mainly used in English,
Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets. In this section, we
compare Japanese tweets and English tweets because English
tweets are more than Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets.
Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the cumulative relative fre-
quency distribution of
•
the length of all the Japanese and English tweets
(excluding retweets),
•
the length of Japanese and English tweets (excluding
retweets) that have unsounded code strings at the end
of them, and
•
the length of unsounded code strings at the end of
Japanese and English tweets (excluding retweets).

As shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, the distribution of the
length of Japanese tweets shifts to shorter ranges than the
length of English tweets. On the other hand, the distribution
of the length of unsounded code strings at the end of Japanese
tweets shifts to longer ranges than the length of those at the
end of English tweets.
Next, we compare the length of unsounded code strings
at the end of normal tweets and replies. Figure 9 and Figure
10 show the cumulative relative frequency distribution of the
length of unsounded code strings at the end of
•
Japanese normal tweets and replies, and
•
English normal tweets and replies.
As shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, the length of unsounded
code strings at the end of Japanese and English normal tweets
have a similar distribution pattern to those of Japanese and
English replies, respectively. As a result, it may be said that the

Next, we compare the length of normal tweets and replies
that have unsounded code strings at the end of them. Figure

As shown in Figures 11–14, only the distribution of the length
of Japanese replies that have unsounded code strings at the
end of them shifts to longer ranges than the length of all the
Japanese replies. On the other hand, the distribution of the
length of the other tweets (Japanese normal tweets, English
normal tweets and replies) that have unsounded code strings
at the end of them do not shift to longer ranges when they are
longer than 30 characters. It may be said that the length of
Japanese tweets that have unsounded code strings at the end
of them are affected by whether the tweets are normal tweets
or replies. On the other hand, the length of English tweets
that have unsounded code strings at the end of them are not
affected.
Next, we investigate that the percentages of tweets that
have unsounded code strings at the end of them are affected
by whether the tweets are normal tweets or replies. Figure 15

that have unsounded code strings at the end of them. As
shown in Figure 15, 9.4 % of Japanese normal tweets have
unsounded code strings at the end of them while 17.0 % of
Japanese replies have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. As a result, the percentages of Japanese normal tweets
and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end of them
differ considerably from each other. In other words, Japanese
replies have unsounded code strings at the end of them more
frequently than Japanese normal tweets. On the other hand,
Figure 16 shows the percentages of English normal tweets
and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. As shown in Figure 16, 7.0 % of English normal tweets
have unsounded code strings at the end of them while 7.6 %
of English replies have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. As a result, the percentages of English normal tweets
and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end of
them differ little from each other. In addition, the percentages

Figure 16. The percentages of English normal tweets and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end of them
of English normal tweets and Japanese normal tweets that have
unsounded code strings at the end of them differ little from
each other. From these points, it may be said that Japanese
speakers use unsounded code strings at the end of tweets more
frequently to particular persons than to general public while
English speakers do not. In other words, the receiver of a
tweet, whether general public or a particular person, is a factor
that affects the usage of unsounded code strings for Japanese
speakers, however, not for English speakers.
D. The investigation of the usage of unsounded code strings
at the end of Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets
We found that Japanese speakers use unsounded code
strings at the end of tweets more frequently to particular
persons than to general public while English speakers do not.
However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is speciﬁc for
Japanese speakers. To solve this problem, we investigate that
the percentages of Spanish, Portuguese, and French tweets that
have unsounded code strings at the end of them are affected
by whether the tweets are normal tweets or replies. Figure 17
shows the percentages of Spanish normal tweets and replies
that have unsounded code strings at the end of them. As
shown in Figure 17, 7.5 % of Spanish normal tweets have
unsounded code strings at the end of them while 8.6 % of
Spanish replies have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. Figure 18 shows the percentages of Portuguese normal
tweets and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end
of them. As shown in Figure 18, 6.4 % of Portuguese normal
tweets have unsounded code strings at the end of them while
7.4 % of Portuguese replies have unsounded code strings at the
end of them. Figure 19 shows the percentages of French normal
tweets and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end
of them. As shown in Figure 19, 5.0 % of French normal
tweets have unsounded code strings at the end of them while
7.0 % of French replies have unsounded code strings at the
end of them. As a result, as in the case of English tweets, the
percentages of Spanish, Portuguese, and French normal tweets
that have unsounded code strings at the end of them differ little

from those of their replies that have unsounded code strings
at the end of them, respectively. From these points, it may
be said that Japanese speakers use unsounded code strings at
the end of tweets more frequently to particular persons than to
general public while English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French
speakers do not.
Next, we discuss why Japanese speakers differ from other
language speakers. We think that the difference is caused
by whether speakers change their expressions according to
listeners. In order to express speakers’ attitudes to listeners
clearly, Japanese speakers generally change their expressions
according to listener’s age, gender, position, feeling, and so
on. These expressions in Japanese are studied as a topic
of modality expressions [19] [20]. Masuoka reported that
Japanese speakers use modality expressions more frequently
than other language speakers [21].
(exp 9) gakkou ni ike (Go to the school)
(exp 10) gakkou ni ike yo (Go to the school, OK?)
In both (exp 9) and (exp 10), the speakers order the listeners
to go to the school. However, the speaker of (exp 9) simply
orders the listener to go to the school. On the other hand, the
speaker of (exp 10) uses a modality expression “yo” and shows
that he/she understands listener’s feeling: the listener does not
want to go to the school. Because of the modality expression,
the listener can receive (exp 10) more softly than (exp 9). The
point is that modality expression “yo” of (exp 10) is similar
to unsounded code string “...” of (exp 11) in the meaning.
(exp 11) gakkou ni ike... (Go to the school...)
It is likely that many Japanese speakers use unsounded code
strings at the end of Japanese sentences as one kind of modality
expressions. As a result, we think that Japanese speakers
change expressions at the end of tweets according to listener,
whether general public and particular persons, while other
language speakers do not.
There is another point of view: the difference of the
usage of unsounded code strings is caused by culture. Nisbett
reported that how we think is inﬂuenced by culture [22]. He
showed that people who grow up in East Asia pay more
attention to context and background than people who grow
up in the West. The theory is that East Asians grow up
learning to pay attention to context because cultural norms
in East Asia emphasize relationships and groups. On the other
hand, Westerners grow up learning to pay more attention to
focal objects than context because Western society is more
individualistic than East Asia society. From this point of view,
it may be said, because of cultural norms in Japan, Japanese
speakers pay more attention to relationships with listeners
than English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French speakers. To
discuss this matter, it is important to introduce geo-location
information associated with Tweets into our investigation.
By using geo-location information, we can distinguish and
investigate native speakers that speak the same language but
belong to the different cultures, for example, British and other
native English speakers.
We may note that Internet evolution gives us a new commu-
nication media from individuals to general public and we adapt
to it rapidly. Furthermore, the adaptations differ depending on
languages. The results of this study will give us a chance to
understand the usage of unsounded code strings and improve
multilingual CMC systems.

CONCLUSION
Unsounded code strings, in other words, consecutive un-
sounded marks and characters are frequently used at the end
of online messages. However, there were few studies on them.
In this study, we investigated unsounded code strings at the
end of Japanese, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French
tweets in Twitter. Then, we showed that Japanese speakers use
unsounded code strings at the end of tweets more frequently
to particular persons than to general public while English,
Spanish, Portuguese, and French speakers do not. It may be
said that the receiver of a tweet, whether general public or a
particular person, is a factor that affects the usage of unsounded
code strings for Japanese speakers, however, not for the other
language speakers. It is because, we think, Japanese speakers
generally change their expressions according to listener’s age,
gender, position, feeling, and so on while the other language
speakers do not. In order to discuss whether this phenomenon
is speciﬁc for Japanese speakers, we intend to analyze tweets in
various languages, especially, languages in East Asia. Further-
more, we intend to introduce geo-location information into our
study and examine whether expressions in tweets are affected
by areas. The results of this study will give us a chance to
understand the usage of unsounded code strings and improve
multilingual CMC systems.
