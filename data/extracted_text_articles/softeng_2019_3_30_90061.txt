Abstract—Software development has been evolving during the
last years and, more and more, the software architecture to
support this development has become increasingly complex to
meet the new requirements and new technologies. With the
new Cloud Computing architecture and models, Information
Technology
(IT)
departments
and
Independent
Software
Vendors (ISVs) are developing new applications and moving
the traditional software architecture to the cloud. In this
context, the Platform as a Service (PaaS) model can provide
software development services and components within a new
architecture for building a new generation of software with all
benefits of the cloud, like scalability and elasticity. We look at
the requirements and technologies for developing software
with the PaaS architecture and present a migration model for
PaaS,
based
on
the
main
software
architectures
and
information
system
types,
validated
by
specialists
from
software development and Cloud Computing areas. The results
show the feasibility of our approach and the possibility to have
an initial blueprint for software development in PaaS.

INTRODUCTION
Cloud Computing, one of the latest IT innovations, is still
taking shape and gaining maturity, and at this stage, different
people, from the technology area to the sales area, have
divergent views and concepts about it, based on their
interests and how to apply and use Cloud Computing in their
daily lives [1]. Also, Cloud Computing has been modifying
software development and traditional IT and business,
introducing new ways to develop software, with more
scalability and agility with lower costs, allowing companies,
from startups to big corporations, to create new business
models or improve existing ones.
Due to the growth of Cloud Computing adoption,
Platform as a Service (PaaS) has become an important part
of the cloud economy and has been showing the potential of
a service model, with a platform that supports the entire
lifecycle of an application, from development, testing,
deployment and operations, with components, tools and
integrated services [2]. Many organizations are planning and
migrating their on-premise software to the cloud [3], starting
with the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a
Service (SaaS) models. Nonetheless, they are facing some
challenges and difficulties, mainly in the PaaS model, related
to the complexity in integrating the legacy and internal
systems, from their IT area to the new PaaS architecture
model and services on the cloud.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section
2,
we
present
the
background
and
problem
identification. Section 3 presents the details of the PaaS
service model. Section 4 presents the details of our proposed
migration model. Section 5 discusses existing limitations and
future works. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the discussion
and conclusions of the paper.
II.
BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
PaaS is a cloud service model that provides capabilities
to deploy applications onto the cloud created with languages
and tools supported by the provider and uses and integrates
application infrastructure services in the application to cloud
consumers.
In the PaaS model, the cloud provider manages the
foundational
infrastructure
(network,
servers,
operating
systems, storage, etc.), but the cloud consumer has control
over the deployed applications, configurations and lifecycle
[4].
PaaS
delivers
application
infrastructure
capabilities
(middleware) to the software development process, such as
runtime and development components, as cloud services
like:

Application Development, Data, Workflow, etc.

Security Services (Single Sign-On, Authentication,
etc.).

Database Management Systems (DBMSs).

Directory Services.

Integration middleware.

Business process management (BPM) platforms.

Rules engine.

Complex-event processing (CEP).

In-memory computing (IMC) platforms.
Cloud Computing and PaaS model architecture bring
new
requirements
and
complexity
to
the
software
development process. These contingencies include the new
technologies, services and tools available in PaaS, to the
adaptation of the traditional software engineering and

development process to use new techniques like DevOps,
native
cloud
application
models
and
hybrid
cloud
deployment (on-premise to cloud integration), until new
methodologies, like Agile, used in this new software
development scenario to be considered in the traditional
software project management practices.
In this hypersonic-growth scenario, the ISVs and IT
department of companies need to be able to evaluate the
PaaS
model
and
architecture
to
adapt
their
software
development
and
architecture,
usually
complex
with
countless legacy systems, many integrations and different
technologies to this new software development scenario.
III.
PAAS SERVICE MODEL
Considered as the next level of abstraction of the cloud
stack, after IaaS, which targets the basic IT infrastructure,
PaaS provides the functions from the application stack as
services, allowing developers to design and build solutions
using
platform
services
for
caching,
asynchronous
messaging,
database,
and
much
more.
In
this
way,
developers do not need to reinvent the wheel implementing
these “commodity” requirements from scratch and can focus
on the business logic from the system [5].
However,
PaaS
is
the
hardest
service
model
to
characterize due to the many ways of building services and
the wide range of offerings of PaaS providers. An additional
layer of services related
to
development
frameworks,
middleware, databases, messaging and queuing is added to
PaaS as an integration layer, so the applications can be built
to the platform with the supported development languages
and tools [6].
Due to the evolution of the Cloud Computing industry
and
increased
cloud
customer
adoption,
new
Cloud
Computing “as a service” models known as XaaS have
emerged, that refer to “anything” or “everything” as a
service. These new service models related with the three
original cloud service models are being deployed by public
cloud providers and into the enterprise private cloud [7].
The PaaS market is growing and becoming segmented
with new extended service models for PaaS, as reported by
Gartner [8], in 2016 there were 20 specialized PaaS
categories from vendors with paying customers, and some
new categories will emerge and others will be integrated into
new PaaS suites in the next years. This growing market of
PaaS solutions reflects the evolution of Cloud Computing
and the search for new solutions in the cloud for software
development. The main PaaS categories reported by Gartner
[8] in 2016 are:

Application Platform Services (aPaaS): a cloud
service
focused
on
general-purpose
business
applications development, deployment, execution,
supporting business logic and data handling for
back-end services, web, and mobile.

Business Analytics Platform Services (baPaaS):
cloud-based business analytics platforms offering
capabilities
to
ingest data
from
different
data
sources, prepare data for analysis, visualize and
analyze data, develop and publish dashboards or
other Business Intelligence (BI) outputs.

Business Process Management Services (bpmPaaS):
The delivery of Business Process Management
(BPM) capabilities as a cloud service including a
graphical
business
process
and
rule
modeling
capabilities, a process registry and repository to
handle the modeling metadata, a process execution
environment, and rule engine.

Business Rule Platform Services (brPaaS): also
referred to as decision management PaaS (dmPaaS),
a cloud-based service that aims to support decision
making by the business rules management.

Communications Platform Services (cPaaS): cloud-
based solutions that enable applications to integrate
or improve communications functionalities, like
telephony calling, SMS, MMS, Speech recognition,
Mobile browsing, Video services, and Conferencing.

Database Platform Services (dbPaaS): a cloud
service that provides any database management
system (DBMS) or data storage engineered as a
scalable, elastic and multitenant subscription.

Function Platform Services (fPaaS): cloud-based
service
that
provides
a
serverless
execution
environment for small and event-triggered functions,
where it is possible to run code without provisioning
or managing servers with support to automatically
scale processes to support increasing and decreasing
load.

Enterprise
Horizontal
Portal
Services
(Portal
PaaS):
cloud-based
service
that
provides
an
Enterprise Portal with core portal features like
security,
personalization,
integration,
content
aggregation and presentation, with the ability to run
in
shared,
multitenant
environments,
including
private and public cloud deployments.

Integration Platform Services (iPaaS): provides a
platform in the cloud to support application, data and
system-to-system integrations, using a mix of cloud
services, mobile apps, on-premises systems and
Internet of Things (IoT) integrations.

Message-Oriented
Middleware
Services
(momPaaS):
cloud-based
services
focused
on
provide communication between one part of an
application
to
another
or
between
different
applications through the internet, in the case of
public cloud momPaaS, and between components in
the same LAN with the private cloud model.

IV.
MIGRATION MODEL
The proposal and migration model are based on the
concepts
and
fundamentals
related
to
the
following
assumptions:

There are different PaaS service models specialized
in attending to the different needs of software
development and migration to the cloud.

Although there are several types of software,
systems, and applications, the migration model was
focused on the main types of information systems
that have business content relevance.

There are a variety of software architectures to use
in software development, and each one has specific
requirements and characteristics that should be
evaluated according to the needs and requirements
of the system.

Although software development for PaaS uses the
traditional
Software
Development
Life
Cycle
(SDLC), it is critical to consider the characteristics
of
Cloud
Computing
to
adapt
software
development to PaaS.

Migration software development to PaaS needs to
have a defined roadmap and process to allow the
migration in phases, although the migration process
may be the same for all software development
migration to the cloud.
Design
Science
Research
(DSR)
is
one
of
the
methodologies
that
allows
producing
knowledge
in
a
structured way, focusing on a real problem resolution,
ensuring the attainment of scientific results. The authors used
DSR as a scientific methodology to produce this academic
contribution
and
the
migration
model.
The
approach
involved an analysis of current software development
processes and PaaS software development requirements. We
proposed
recommendations
based
on
the
study
and
interviewed specialists validated the recommendations. The
authors documented the results and discussions.
The migration model for developing and migrating the
software development to the PaaS cloud model, described in
Table I, was constructed based on two dimensions: the
software architecture style and the type of information
system that the software was built or will be built using one
or more PaaS specialized categories.
The software architectures used in the model were
selected based on the relevance and importance in the
software engineering and in the current technologies used in
software development. Also, the types of information
systems [9] were selected based on the focus on business
systems and in most of the legacy software implemented. For
a specific software architecture and type of information
system relation, one or more PaaS specialized models were
recommended based on main PaaS categories and should be
evaluated whether it will be necessary to use a PaaS
specialized model or more than one combined to use PaaS in
software development migration projects.

The recommendations from the migration model in Table
I, resulted from the relation of software architecture style and
the type of information system, can be summarized as
follows:

Monolithic architecture [10] and TPS, ERP,
SCM, CRM and KMS information systems
[11]: as a monolithic application is built in a
single unit, these types of information systems
can use the Application Platform Services
(aPaaS) model to implement and deploy the
system
in
the
cloud,
using
an
embedded
database
and
one
or
more
programming
language runtimes to implement the application
(UI, business logic and data access layer)
(Recommendation 1).

Monolithic
architecture
[10]
and
BI
information system [11]: To implement BI
information systems in the cloud as a monolithic
application,
Application
Platform
Services
(aPaaS) can be used to build an application with
BI capabilities from scratch or the Business
Analytics Platform Services (baPaaS) model can
be used to prepare data for analysis, visualize
and
analyze
data,
develop
and
publish
dashboards or other Business Intelligence (BI)
outputs (Recommendation 2).

Client-server architecture [10] and TPS, BI,
ERP, SCM, CRM and KMS information
systems
[11]:
Database
Platform
Services
(dbPaaS) can be used to host the server logic
and data for client-server applications and the
respective information systems types, but as the
application logic is implemented with database
stored procedures and database triggers, the
dbPaaS vendors and products offer needs to be
analyzed
and
evaluated,
before
any
implementation or migration, to attend these
requirements (Recommendation 3).

N-tier
architecture
[10]
and
TPS/BI
information
systems
[11]:
Application
Platform
Services
(aPaaS)
and
Database
Platform Services (dbPaaS) can be used to
implement an n-tier application for TPS and BI
information systems, where the data layer can
be hosted in dbPaaS and the presentation and
business logic layer (and other layers if needed)
can be implemented and deployed in an aPaaS
as
separated
applications/modules
(Recommendation 4).

N-tier architecture [10] and ERP information
system
[11]:
Like
recommendation
4,
Application
Platform
Services
(aPaaS)
and
Database Platform Services (dbPaaS) can be
used to implement an ERP information system.
Additionally, Business Process Management
Services (bpmPaaS) can be used to model and
execute the business process related with the
functional areas in ERP, such as manufacturing
and production, finance and accounting, sales
and
marketing,
and
human
resources
(Recommendation 5).

N-tier
architecture
[10]
and
SCM/KMS
information
systems
[11]:
Like
recommendation
4,
Application
Platform
Services
(aPaaS)
and
Database
Platform
Services (dbPaaS) can be used to implement an
SCM and KMS information systems. Also, an
Enterprise Horizontal Portal Services (Portal
PaaS) can be used to provide a corporate portal
with the enterprise knowledge base for KMS
systems
and
a
Business-to-Business
(B2B)
portal for the interaction between the company
and the suppliers, purchasing firms, distributors
and logistics companies (Recommendation 6).

N-tier
architecture
[10]
and
CRM
information
system
[11]:
Like
recommendation
6,
Application
Platform
Services (aPaaS), Database Platform Services
(dbPaaS)
and
Enterprise
Horizontal
Portal
Services (Portal PaaS) can be used to implement
a
CRM
information
system.
Besides,
a
Communications Platform Services (cPaaS) can
be
used
to
provide
communications
functionalities to enhance the communication
and
interaction
with
customers
(Recommendation 7).

Microservices architecture [12]-[14] and TPS
information system [11]: In the case of a TPS
information system, it can be implemented in
microservices architecture using: Application
Platform Services (aPaaS) to implement each
microservice
application,
Database
Platform
Services
(dbPaaS)
to
be
used
by
each
microservice and encapsulate the business data
domain, and Function Platform Services (fPaaS)
to implement small functions and procedures to
be executed as a microservice by the system
(Recommendation 8).

Microservices architecture [12]-[14] and BI
information system [11]: Application Platform
Services
(aPaaS)
and
Database
Platform
Services (dbPaaS) can be used to implement
each microservice of BI information systems
and a Business Analytics Platform Services
(baPaaS)
can
be
used
together
with
the
50

SOFTENG 2019 : The Fifth International Conference on Advances and Trends in Software Engineering

microservices to provide analytical reports and
dashboards (Recommendation 9).

Microservices architecture [12]-[14] and ERP
information system [11]: Application Platform
Services
(aPaaS)
and
Database
Platform
Services (dbPaaS) can be used to implement
each ERP information system microservice, and
can
additionally
use
a
Business
Process
Management Services (bpmPaaS) for modeling
and executing the business process and Business
Rule Platform Services (brPaaS) to encapsulate
some business rules to be executed by the
microservices in the system (Recommendation
10).

Microservices
[12]-[14]
architecture
and
SCM information system [11]: Application
Platform
Services
(aPaaS)
and
Database
Platform Services (dbPaaS) can be used to
implement
each
SCM
information
system
microservice
and
Business
Rule
Platform
Services (brPaaS) to encapsulate the business
rules
that
can
be
consumed
by
the
microservices.
Additionally,
Enterprise
Horizontal Portal Services (Portal PaaS) can be
used to provide a B2B portal that is integrated
with the microservices layer (Recommendation
11).

Microservices
architecture
[12]-[14]
and
CRM
information
system
[11]:
Like
recommendation 11, a CRM information system
can
be
implemented
in
microservices
architecture using Application Platform Services
(aPaaS), Database Platform Services (dbPaaS),
Business Rule Platform Services (brPaaS) and
Enterprise Horizontal Portal Services (Portal
PaaS). Also, Communications Platform Services
(cPaaS) can be used by the microservices to
provide
communications
functionalities
to
customers (Recommendation 12).

Microservices
architecture
[12]-[14]
and
KMS
information
system
[11]:
KMS
Information system types can be implemented
in a microservice architecture using Application
Platform
Services
(aPaaS)
and
Database
Platform
Services
(dbPaaS)
to
build
each
system microservice, and Enterprise Horizontal
Portal Services (Portal PaaS) can be used to
provide
a
knowledge
base
portal
that
is
integrated
with
the
microservices
layer
(Recommendation 13).
For all the recommended scenarios in the migration
model (Table I), Integration Platform Services (iPaaS) was
recommended
for situations when the integration and
exchange of information between cloud applications and on-
premise and legacy applications are required.
In
the
recommendations
related
to
Microservices
Architecture (8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13), a Message-Oriented
Middleware Services (momPaaS) was proposed to support
the communication and integration between the different
microservices implemented in the respective system, thus
supporting the message exchange with different protocols.
The
proposed
migration
model
and
respective
recommendations were validated through interviews, where
the objective of the interviews was to validate the migration
model with specialists in Cloud Computing and Software
Development from academic institutions and IT companies.
The following three questions and the identification of
each interviewee
were considered
fundamental
in the
interview step and aim to validate the study, validate and
improve the model and the work.
1.
Does it make sense to propose a model that
systematizes the different specializations of
PaaS for software development?
2.
Do you agree with the strategy followed in the
presented
migration
model
(Software
Architecture/Information
System
Type/Recommendations)?
3.
Do
you
have
suggestions to
improve
the
migration model proposed?
Based on the interview answers collected from the
specialists, it was possible to verify that the migration model
proposed in this work is valid and the recommendations
presented
in
the
model
can
be
applied
in
software
development scenarios with PaaS, according to what has
been proposed in the migration model.
Regarding question 1, which aimed to validate if it makes
sense to propose the model presented, all interviewees
agreed that the proposed model makes sense and the
importance of having precise definitions of PaaS specialized
models was highlighted, thus avoiding overlaps of concepts.
The strategy followed in the model was agreed by all
interviewees, according to the answers from question 2, and
it was suggested that some examples of the application of
recommendations to enrich the work should be described.
In question 3 answers, the interviewees collaborated with
interesting suggestions for improvements in the model, but
there did not agree on how to evolve the model, since one
interviewee suggested keeping it as simple as possible and
not include new types of information systems and new
software architectures, while another interviewee suggested
exactly the opposite, evolving the model to consider new
types of information systems and new software architectures.
Thus, analyzing the results of the validation of the
proposed model by the specialists through interviews, it was
clear that it can add value to the software development
process for PaaS and thus support decision makers, managers
and technical specialists in trying to choose the most
51

appropriate PaaS models for the needs and requirements of
their projects.
V.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Although Cloud Computing is not a recent technology,
Platform as a Service has been gaining attention in the IT
market in the last years, and consequently, the platform has
been evolving. Even though the migration model presented
tries to address the main aspects of PaaS, there are still open
challenges remaining which can be worked on in future
projects and studies.
An exhaustive investigation was necessary in different
sources of information, like research and advisory companies
in IT, academic papers and theses, books related with Cloud
Computing
and
software
development,
producing
this
scientific contribution with more impartiality and objectivity
and contributing to the scientific community. Gathering
experts in the Cloud Computing area and getting an agenda
for the interviews was difficult too, so the focus was on
selecting at least one specialist from the university, one from
a software consulting company and one from a software
technology company, thus allowing to validate the migration
model with different perspectives and experiences.
Currently, we can notice that Cloud Computing has been
revolutionizing the IT market and the way we build
applications and solutions, and if we analyze the conclusions
of this study, it is evident that there is a need to study and
explore the PaaS cloud model and its specializations further,
also the changes and adaptations required in the software
development arising from this “new way” to build software.
VI.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Every day, agility and innovation have become key
factors for organizations to continue to grow and be
competitive in the local and globalized market. Cloud
Computing is increasingly playing a key role to support IT
departments and ISV to drive organizations to achieve these
goals, supporting new software and hardware technologies,
and new software development methodologies and software
architectures. More and more users are deploying strategical
business applications in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, thus making
platform capabilities the center of the cloud innovation. PaaS
has been evolving and specializing in specific platforms to
attend the different software development needs and the IT
market trends, like Big Data, Internet of Things, Mobility,
Cloud Native and others.
However, with continuous PaaS specialization and new
software development technologies that come up every day,
migrating legacy systems or developing new systems in the
cloud becomes complex and challenging in some situations.
The migration model presented originated because of the
previously mentioned scenarios and built based on the study
of the concepts and technologies related to PaaS. We tried to
give recommendations and solutions, to help IT departments
and ISV to start entering in PaaS software development with
an initial blueprint. We validated our proposal with a model
mediating to specialists in Cloud Computing and Software
Development from academic institutions and IT companies.
