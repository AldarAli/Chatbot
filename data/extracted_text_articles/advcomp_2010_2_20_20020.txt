Abstract— This paper describes the development of air 
pollutants concentration prediction models of five 
different pollutants (O3, PM10, SO2, NOx, COx), using 
Radial Basis Function, and Elman Networks, two 
neurocomputing paradigms. Each Artificial Neural 
network (ANN) predicts, therefore the concentration of 
the five different pollutants. These models are developed 
in order to give 12 hours ahead prediction for the region 
of Annaba, northeast of Algeria (north of Africa). 
Receiving 
the 
measurement 
of 
air 
pollutant 
concentration and the metrological parameters (wind 
speed, temperature and humidity) at time t; the models 
are designed to predict air pollutant concentration at 
t+12 hours. Once predicted pollutant concentrations are 
obtained, and the validity of each ANN model is proven, 
the 
performances 
of 
both 
ANN 
models 
are 
comprehensively compared and assessed.  Conclusions 
are finally drawn and the use of a particular ANN 
network over another is justified on the light of the 
obtained results.

I. INTRODUCTION 
All air pollution generated by rapid urbanization, 
population growth and industrialization has taken alarming 
dimensions, and is one the greatest evil that mankind has to 
face in the coming years. To prevent the further decline of air 
pollution, scientific planning of analysis methods and 
pollution control are required. Within this framework it is 
necessary to implement air quality forecasting tools in order 
to take needed measures, such as reducing the effect of a 
predicted pollution peak on the surrounding population and 
eco-system. 
Many 
factors 
influence 
air 
pollutants 
concentrations. Among the most important are: metrological 
conditions, topology and population density. This makes air 
pollution difficult to model. Many air pollution prediction 
models have been studied [1] such as, mathematical emission 
models, linear models; Artificial Neural Networks-based 
models and hybrid models, in order to design air quality 
prediction systems, moderates air pollution and limit the 
influence of peaks periods by informing community by 
taking the necessary precaution. Air pollutant can be 
chemical such as: (SO2: dioxide of sulfur, O3: ozone, NOx: 
oxide of nitrogen, COx: oxide of Carbon), or solid such as 
PM10 (Particulate Matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 
10 micrometer). PM10 are the sum of all solid and liquid 
particles suspended in air, many of which are hazardous. 
This complex mixture includes both organic and inorganic 
particles, such as dust, pollen, soot, smoke, and liquid 
droplets. These particles vary greatly in size, composition, 
and origin. Particles in air are either: directly emitted, for 
instance when fuel is burnt and when dust is carried by wind, 
or indirectly formed, by a photochemical interaction between 
gaseous pollutants in the air space.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces 
the specifications of the studied area and the nature and 
amount of used data. Section III explains the usage of 
Artificial Neural Networks as pollutants prediction tool. 
Section IV details the design of the two ANN approaches, 
i.e., RBF and Elman. In the light of the available data, 
chosen networks topologies are justified. Section V presents 
all obtained results and establishes a comparison study. 
Finally, Section VI concludes the research paper.

STUDIED AREA AND AVAILLABLE DATA 
A. Studied Area 
In Algeria, respiratory infections remain the leading 
cause of child mortality after measles and diarrhea [2]. 
Chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and asthma, among other 
diseases are also caused by pollution. This is especially 
apparent in some unventilated and highly industrialised 
regions; Annaba may be counted among these. In the region, 
the prevalence of asthma is higher than the national rate, 
55% of asthmatics have more than one crisis per month and 
42% of patients were hospitalized at least once during the 
year. Annaba region is located in the Eastern part of 
Algerian coast (600 km of Algiers); its town is constituted

of a vast plain bordered in the South and West, of a 
mountainous massive in North, and by the Mediterranean 
Sea in the East. Its bowl-shaped topography favors air 
stagnation and the formation of temperature inversions. 
These situations allow the pollutants accumulation and the 
increase in concentration that result. Sea and land breezes 
contribute to slope transport of clouds of pollutants. Indeed, 
the clouds of pollutants are carried away by land breeze to 
the sea. These clouds of pollutants return to the city as a 
result of sea breezes along the Seraidi Mountain. The clouds 
look over the city in a form of circle. The pollutants are 
deposited slowly by gravity and therefore there is pollution 
affecting the three receivers (sea, land and air) [2]. 
Contaminants Air emissions are distributed differently 
depending on industry. The industry is the engine of growth 
and environmental degradation in Annaba and its 
surrounding area, where the most industrial sites are located 
nearby, such as the complex of phosphate and nitrogen 
fertilizers, Asmidal and the Metalsteel complex of El-
Hadjar. These industrial activities are the main source of 
particulate matter and sulfur oxides, while emissions of 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen and lead are mainly due to the 
transport sector. Emissions from road traffic are the main 
pollutants of the atmosphere. Air pollution has increased 
with the increasing number of vehicles (an annual increase 
of 5% in Algeria) and the absence of emissions control. 
Meanwhile, the treatment of waste (domestic, industrial, 
hospital, toxic), which is to put them in wild sites, is also a 
source of air pollution to such an extent, that they are 
incinerated in free air. 
B. Data Pre-processing 
The dataset used in this work covers the period 2003-
2004 and was provided by SAMASAFIA network center [3] 
on a continuous basis of 24 hours. Air pollutants monitored 
continuously include the concentrations of: nitric oxide 
(NO), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), particulate matter 
(PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 
sulfur dioxide (SO2). The used dataset includes also three 
meteorological parameters: Wind Speed (WS), Temperature 
(T) and relative humidity (H). 
 
The available data is an hourly measurements of 
pollutants concentration of two years, form 1/1/2003 to 
31/12/2003 and form 1/1/2004 to 31/12/2004, in Annaba. 
The 2003 dataset was used for training and the one of 2004 
for validation; this will help us to efficiently asses and then 
get the performance of the model. The pollutant 
concentration measurements are in microgram/ m3. To adapt 
the data with our model, we have applied normalization 
using equation (1). Negative values, resulting from faulty 
measurements where replaced using (2), this will make the 
input ranges between [0 1], and in the output we will obtain a 
percentage indicating the degree of the peak alarm.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR AIR 
POLLUTANT’S CONCENTRATION 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are an alternative to 
classical statistics methods used for prediction in air quality 
monitoring stations [1]. Large amount of available data from 
monitoring stations can be very useful in order to design 
efficient ANN predictions models. Relationship between

meteorological parameter and air pollutant concentration is 
very difficult to model. Mlakar and Boznar [4] present a 
Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP) based model for SO2 
concentration prediction, it receives the meteorological and 
emission parameters as inputs, the model shows an efficient 
predictions and outperform the ARMA (Autoregressive 
Moving Average) based model. Mlakar and Joseph [5] 
present a pattern recognition inspired approach to select the 
parameter for the air pollution prediction model, in order to 
optimize the training time and increases model performance.  
 
To get the most adaptable model for air pollution 
prediction Jorquera et al. [6] present a comparison between 
three models: ANN based model, linear model and Fuzzy 
logic based model. These models have been applied to 
predict Ozone concentration in Santiago Chile, the Fuzzy 
and ANN model has shown an efficient prediction and 
outperform the linear model. Gardner and Droling [7] 
present NO2 prediction model based on MLP topology, 
compared with linear regressor using the same input data and 
parameter, the MLP based model shows better accuracy. In 
Gardner and Droling [8], the long-term tendency of Ozone 
concentration in London has been studied using ANN based 
model. The prediction of PM2.5 (Particulate matter with 
diagonal smaller the 2.5 micrometer) concentration has been 
well studied in Perez et al. [9], using ANN based model 
which is able to predict short-term concentration of PM2.5. 
Perez and Reyes [10] focused on the prediction of PM10. 
 
This is to cite but a few, other research work may be 
found in the literature such as: Foxall and al. [11] for ozone, 
Corani [12] for Ozone and PM10, Bianchini et al. [13] for 
NO2, etc. 
IV. 
MODEL DEVELOPMENT 
A. Radial Basis Function (RBF) 
 
Radial Basis Function networks has been proposed and 
used in many studies [14][15], a detailed presentation can be 
found in Chen et al. [16]. As illustrated in Figure 3, RBF 
networks consist in three layers. The first layer is composed 
by n input neurons connected to each input. The input 
neurons (or processing before the input layer) standardizes 
the range of the values by subtracting the median and 
dividing by the interquartile range. The input neurons then 
feed the values to each of the neurons in the hidden layer. 
The neurons of the hidden layer have the radial basis 
function (3) as activation function,

where: M and δ  are two parameters respectively the 
input variable mean and standard deviation. 
 
The outputs of the nodes are combined linearly to give the 
final network output. 
 
The main advantages of radial basis network may be: The 
time taken in designing a radial basis network is often less 
when compared to the training a sigmoid/linear networks; 
and the number of neurons required for designing the 
network is considerably less when compared to standard 
back propagation network [17]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: RBF network architecture. 
 
The training algorithm, used iteratively, creates a blank RBF 
network (no neurons at first), and sequentially adding nodes 
by including one neuron at a time. Neurons are added to the 
network until the Sum of Squared Error (SSE) reaches a set 
target or the maximum numbers of neurons are reached. At 
each iteration the input vector, resulting in lowering the 
network error, is used to create a radial basis neuron. The 
distance between the connecting weights determines the 
output of hidden neurons and input vector, which is further, 
multiplied by bias, an additional scalar quantity being added 
between neuron and fictitious neuron. The output is 
propagated in a feed forward direction to output layer 
neurons.

These, will give a response if the connection weights are 
close to input signal. This output is, then compared to a 
target vector. If the error reaches the error goal (a set value 
given the desired difference between the actual and 
modelled output), then training is terminated, otherwise the

next neuron will be added. The complete training procedure 
is implemented in the function newrb available in the neural 
network toolbox supported by MATLAB. 
 
B. Elman networks 
Elman networks [18] are considered as recurrent neural 
networks, because they have feedback connections in the 
neurons of the hidden layer as illustrated in Figure 4. Elman 
networks are called buffered networks, as they take in 
consideration the previous output value and use it to 
calculate the next step output. The network leaves a trace of 
its behavior and keeps a memory of its previous states which 
may enhance the accuracy of the predictions.  
 
V. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Measurement indeces 
The performance of both modeling ANN approaches are 
evaluated in terms of Index of Agreement (IA) and the Mean 
Squared Error (MSE). The formulation of IA and MSE are 
given in equation (4) and (5) respectively.

B. Obtained results 
Table 1 presents the performance and the architecture of 
the RBF based models, the topology of the final selected 
networks as well as the performance of the models in terms 
of Index of Agreement (IA) and the Mean Squared Error 
(MSE) as performance measures.

It can be seen that RBFs show good performances for PM10 
and Cox. For O3, it gives medium accuracy, but for NOx, it 
has the worst performance. 
The training mechanism for Elman networks is similar to 
the one used for MLPs and is based on the back propagation 
algorithm. The overtraining phenomena affect EN in the 
same manner than it affect MLPs [19]. Table 2 shows the 
obtained results for all five pollutants.

Figures 5 shows the model performances over a range of 
12h for both ANN paradigms (RBF and Elman’s Networks) 
for PM10 predictions. Similarly, Figure 6 shows the results 
for O3, Figure 7 for NOX, Figure 8 for COX and Figure 9 for 
SO2.  
According to these figures and the summarizing Tables 1 
and 2, RBF models seem the best adapted to predict 
efficiently pollutant concentration, regardless of their easier 
training and validation procedure. Elman models shows 
good 
generalization 
and 
predicts 
well 
pollutants 
concentration at the exception of SO2, where this type of 
models shows the worst performances due to the existence 
of several peaks of this pollutant within the used data.

CONCLUSION 
Two types of ANN models have been designed, validated 
and tested for the prediction of five air pollutants. RBF 
models have shown the best performances followed closely 
by Elman Network for single step prediction. However these 
types of models required longer training time and were 
computationaly effort consumming, even if no much design 
effort were taken for the choice of the topology number of 
neurons and feed back loops as in Elman networks..  
 
Elman’s networks overestimate or under estimate some 
pollutants peaks. This is seen for PM10 and COx. The 
addition of emission parameters related to cars and 
industries may improve prediction quality. 
 
Finally, these results are specific to the region of Annaba. 
The use these models for others region must comply with 
data specific proprieties and training must be performed in 
order to identify the vest network topology.
