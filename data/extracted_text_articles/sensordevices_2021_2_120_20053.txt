Abstract— This paper presents a method to minimize the 
resonant frequency drift of Capacitive Micromachined 
Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) due to fluid loading. A 
unified mathematical model for the resonant frequency of a 
CMUT that includes the electrostatic spring softening effect 
and the fluid loading effect due to the coupled fluidic layer has 
been developed that provides the basis of the proposed 
approach. The minimization method involves dynamic 
adjustment of the DC bias voltage to modify the electrostatic 
spring softening parameter to offset the effects of fluid loading. 
Analytical and COMSOL based 3D Finite Element Analysis 
(FEA) results show that the drift in the resonant frequency of a 
6 MHz CMUT operated in water can be compensated by 
adjusting the bias voltage by 2% from its 75% pull-in voltage 
value to render an improvement of 4% in lateral and axial 
resolutions in imaging applications. A bias voltage adjustment 
of 9% of the 75% pull-in voltage value is necessary to achieve 
an improvement of 20.74% when the CMUT is operated in 
glycerol.

INTRODUCTION  
Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers are 
emerging as a superior alternative to piezoelectric 
transducers for biomedical imaging, Non-Destructive 
Evaluation (NDE), and High Intensity Focused Ultrasound 
(HIFU) applications [1]–[3]. They can be batch fabricated 
using conventional microfabrication techniques at a lower 
cost and can be efficiently integrated with CMOS based 
integrated circuits for control, drive, and signal processing to 
offer improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) with higher 
fractional bandwidth and thermal stability.  
The CMUT is basically a reciprocal electrostatic 
transducer that relies on capacitance change between a 
movable and a fixed electrode separated by a small gap to 
generate or receive ultrasound [4][5]. The space between the 
electrodes is filled with either vacuum or a thin film of air. 
The movable electrode is supported at the edges by dielectric 
support posts. 
When a CMUT array operates in a fluidic medium, the 
coupled fluid layer manifests itself as an inertial mass onto 
the diaphragm and as a viscous damper depending on the 
viscosity of the fluidic medium. As these fluid loading 
effects alter the effective mass of the CMUT diaphragm, a 
drift of the resonant frequency of the CMUT occurs. As the 
elements in a CMUT array are designed and fabricated to 
have a fixed pitch to satisfy the Nyquist criteria of spatial 
sampling to minimize grating lobes and maximize the main 
lobe power in beamforming operations, a change in the 
CMUT resonant frequency compromises the array operation 
to lower imaging quality.  
Serious research is in progress to minimize the fluid 
loading effects on CMUTs. The fluid loading effects on a 
circular CMUT cell were investigated in [6], where 
frequency dependent equivalent density was used as the 
effective CMUT diaphragm material density to account for 
the distributed fluid loading. The authors in [6] also 
presented a dimensional dependence model based on the 
equivalent density using a finite element method (FEM)  
based data fitting technique. In another approach [7], linear 
and nonlinear equivalent circuit models of a CMUT were 
developed based on electrical, mechanical, and acoustical 
parameters assuming the CMUT as a piston radiator. The 
mass loading and waveguiding effects of the fluids were 
incorporated in the model using data extracted from FEM 
simulations. The authors in [8] presented a generalized 
model for surface acoustic wave devices considering the 
mass and viscous fluid loading. Numerical modeling of fluid 
interaction with oscillating surfaces is available in [9]. In 
[10], the sensitivity of a CMUT diaphragm to the dynamic 
viscosity of the surrounding fluid medium was investigated 
to realize CMUT based fluid sensors.  
In this perspective, this paper presents a method to 
minimize the resonant frequency drift of a CMUT due to 
fluid loading by dynamically adjusting the DC bias voltage. 
The scientific basis of the proposed method lies in the spring 
softening effect associated with the DC bias voltage applied 
to a CMUT. Due to an applied DC bias, necessary for 
CMUT operation in both transmit and receive modes, the 
effective stiffness of the diaphragm reduces to lower the 
resonant frequency. As the amount of spring softening 
(lowering of the stiffness) depends on the DC bias, the DC 
bias voltage can be dynamically controlled using a suitable 
microelectronic circuit to adjust the spring softening amount 
to offset the effect of fluid loading on the resonant 
frequency. Excellent agreements between lumped element 
model analysis and 3D electromechanical finite element 
analysis conducted by the authors show that the method can 
effectively offset the resonant frequency drift due to fluid 
loading to validate the hypothesis.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
A CMUT array is comprised of several transmit and 
receive elements as shown in Figure 1(a). Each element in 
turn is designed to have several CMUT cells connected in 
parallel [9][11]-[14]. A conceptual cross-section of a typical 
CMUT cell is shown in Figure 1(b). 
Assuming that the stiffness of the diaphragm is linear, the 
resonant frequency of a CMUT in air can be calculated 
following

where, k and m  are the stiffness and mass of the CMUT 
diaphragm as shown in Figure 1(b), respectively. Typically, 
the CMUT diaphragms are constructed to have a circular, 
hexagonal, or square shape geometry to satisfy the design 
requirements.

The frequency response of a CMUT cell with and 
without the fluid loading effect can be obtained using the

On the other hand, assuming the small-signal model of a

A careful examination of (8) and (10) reveals that the 
drift in the resonant frequency due to the fluid loading effect 
mf
 alone can be minimized by adjusting the spring 
softening factor 
ksoft
which is a function of the bias voltage 
VDC
in small-signal approximation.  
A suitable microelectronic circuit can be used to sense 
the resonant frequency offset and adjust the bias voltage 
dynamically to control 
ksoft
 to bring the resonant frequency 
back to its design value while generating the desired acoustic 
pressure.

INVESTIGATION OF FLUID LOADING EFFECTS 
A. Analytical CMUT Resonant Frequency Calculation 
with Fluid Loading Effects 
To investigate the proposed approach, a linear CMUT 
array with a center frequency of 6 MHz has been considered. 
This center frequency is suitable for cardiac diagnostic 
imaging as reported in [18]. Individual CMUT cells in the 
array have been designed to have the same resonant 
frequency as the array [19]. The element pitch p has been 
selected following (2) to satisfy the Nyquist criteria of spatial 
sampling to obtain better directivity with minimum side 
lobes. The lateral and axial resolution of the CMUT array is 
given by [1] as:

respectively, where, 
a,
A S and n  are the array aperture, the 
distance between the focus and the array surface at the center 
of the array, and the number of scanning pulses, respectively. 
Following (11) and (12), it is necessary for the CMUT and 
the array physical dimensions to correspond to the same 
wavelength or center frequency to achieve setpoint axial and 
lateral resolutions and avoid any deviation from Nyquist 
criteria of spatial sampling [20][21].  
To investigate the effects of viscosity and density of the 
fluidic medium on the resonant frequency of the CMUT 
diaphragms, a square shaped CMUT diaphragm with the 
same 6 MHz center frequency in air as for the array has been 
investigated.  
Typical CMUT diaphragms are fabricated as a multilayer 
laminate where a thin insulating material is used as the 
structural layer to provide the necessary mechanical strength 
and a thin conducting layer is used on the top of the 
structural layer to enable electrical functionality.  
Following [20], bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) has been 
used as the structural layer for this analysis. The BCB layer 
is coated with a thin layer of gold to form the top electrode. 
Low resistivity silicon has been used to constitute the ground 
electrode. BCB has also been used to fabricate the dielectric 
support post. The major physical properties of the selected 
CMUT materials are listed in Table I. 
To obtain the 6 MHz resonant frequency in air using the 
materials listed in Table I, a diaphragm sidelength of 28 µm, 
BCB layer thickness of 1.5 µm, and gold layer thickness of 
0.1 µm has been determined following [22]. 
The pull-in voltage of the CMUT has been determined 
from 3D electromechanical FEA using COMSOL as 395 
volts. The frequency responses of the CMUT biased at 295 
volts (74.68% of the pull-in voltage) in air, water, engine oil, 
and glycerol are shown in Figure 3. The physical properties 
of the fluids are listed in Table II.  
The frequency response in air without any DC bias 
voltage has also been shown in Figure 3. As it can be seen, 
there is a significant drift in the resonant frequency due to 
the spring softening effect caused by the bias voltage which

B. 3D FEA Based CMUT Resonant Frequency Simulation 
with Fluid Loading Effects 
A 3D FEA of a single CMUT cell was conducted in 
COMSOL Multiphysics environment to investigate the fluid 
loading effects on the frequency response of the CMUT cell. 
The cell was modeled using the electro-mechanical module 
as shown in Figure 4. The air/fluid column was designed 
using the pressure acoustics frequency domain physics 
module.

The CMUT diaphragm was set as a linear elastic material 
and necessary boundary conditions were applied. The 
boundary between the electro-mechanics and pressure 
acoustics domain was defined as a fluid-solid coupled 
boundary that acts as a pressure load on the electro-
mechanics domain. The maximum element size was set to 
one-sixth of the smallest wavelength in a frequency sweep 
while meshing. An AC perturbation signal superimposed 
with DC bias voltage was applied to the CMUT cell using 
the default frequency domain modal analysis method in 
COMSOL. 
The COMSOL based 3D FEA generated modal 
frequency responses of the CMUT model for the fluids listed 
in Table II are shown in Figure 5. 
Table III compares the analytical and 3D FEA results for 
the resonant frequencies of the CMUT in the investigated 
fluids. As it can be seen from Table III, the analytical and 3D 
FEA results are in excellent agreement with a maximum 
deviation of 2.8% for the liquids that validate the efficacy of 
the analytical and simulation methods.  
 
IV. 
MINIMIZING THE FLUID LOADING EFFECTS 
The resonant frequency drift due to the fluid loading 
effect as confirmed by the analytical and 3D FEA based 
analysis can be minimized by adjusting the DC bias voltage 
following (8) and (10). The spring softening parameter 
ksoft
 
as expressed in (8) needs to be dynamically adjusted by 
controlling the bias voltage

 to offset the fluid loading 
effect induced resonant frequency drift

respectively. Thus, the proposed method will help to achieve 
the expected resolution even when the array is operated in 
different fluidic mediums, thereby improving the imaging 
accuracy of a CMUT array.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented a method to minimize the fluid 
loading induced resonant frequency drift of a CMUT by 
dynamically adjusting the bias voltage. Analytical and 3D 
FEA based simulation studies revealed that the amount of 
change in DC bias voltage necessary to offset the resonant 
frequency drift is small and is not expected to affect the 
acoustic power/pressure output of a CMUT array. The 
investigation shows that the method can improve the lateral 
and axial resolutions in water by approximately 4% to 
improve the accuracy of CMUT based biomedical diagnostic 
imaging. For NDE applications, the axial and lateral 
resolution improvements can be as high as 20.74% when 
glycerol is used as the coupling agent.  
The design of a high-speed microelectronic control 
circuit necessary to implement the proposed scheme is in 
progress. In the currently investigated scheme, the received 
signal is signal-conditioned first to remove noise and other 
high frequency components. A high-speed data converter 
with a desired sampling rate is used to digitize the actuating 
AC signal and the received signal. Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) of the transmit and the processed received signal 
provides the frequency components necessary to calculate 
 .f
 Thus, the frequency drift f
  is measured in real time 
to determine the DC bias voltage necessary to be adjusted to 
offset the resonant frequency drift.
