Abstract—Computational musicology denotes the use of comput-
ers for analyzing music. This paper proposes applying techniques
from stringology for analyzing classical Korean music. Histori-
cally, Sejong, the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea,
intended to rule the country with courtesy and music following
the teaching of Neo-Confucianism. For this, he invented a music
score in which music could be written. He made the structure
of the music score based on the meaning of Neo-Confucianism,
and recorded contemporary music with two notation patterns.
In this paper, we ﬁrst study the patterns in the structure of the
music score and then investigate the notation patterns by which
contemporary music was recorded in the music score. Finally,
we establish links between these musical patterns and computing
pattern inference for music via the ﬁeld of stringology. Future
research directions are outlined.

INTRODUCTION
Musicology is the study of music through scholarly anal-
ysis and research methodologies. Computational musicology
is the use of computers in order to study music and integrates
musicology, computer science and stringology (the study of
strings). This interdisciplinary research area includes music
information retrieval, pattern matching and music informatics.
This paper introduces the computational study of patterns
occurring in Korean music and proposes future research di-
rections for this endeavour. We ﬁrst overview the background
for these musical patterns in the structure of the music score
and the notation patterns devised for recording Korean music
and then describe connections to the ﬁeld of stringology.
King Sejong (reign 1418–1450) introduced ‘yeack’ ideol-
ogy with the goal of ideal Confucian politics. Yeack ideology
means ruling the subjects by courtesy and music rather than
by punishments. For this he invented a form of music score
that has been passed down to this day. This music score is a
full score that notates lyric and various musical instruments.
Moreover, it is a detailed music score that notates both one-
third and one-fourth beats. The music score was improved one
step further by his son, King Sejo, and then it has evolved with
gradual changes up until now.
King Sejong made the structure of the music score based
on the meaning of Neo-Confucianism, and recorded contem-
porary music with notation patterns ﬁtting to each rhythm.
Without understanding the notation patterns, therefore, the
music recorded in the music score cannot be interpreted
properly. Hence, we ﬁrst study the structure of the music score
and its meaning in Neo-Confucianism. Then, we investigate
the notation patterns recorded in the music score and the
corresponding rhythms of the 15th century Korean music.
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section II
explores the meaningful structure of the music scores of the
Joseon Dynastry. Section III identiﬁes the patterns of the music
scores. Section IV discusses computational Korean musicology
and applications of the stringology in musicology. Section V
provides the summary and future directions.
II.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE MUSIC SCORE
AND ITS MEANING
A. Structure of the music score
The music score of the Joseon Dynasty (the version es-
tablished by King Sejo) has the structure shown in Figure 1.
Small squares form a vertical column, and vertical columns
proceed (are read) from right to left. A small square is called
a jeonggan and a vertical column is called a haeng. A vertical
column is divided into 6 daegangs by thick lines. A daegang
consists of either three squares or two squares.
Figure 1 shows a full score, and thus ﬁve columns make
one column set, in which the ﬁrst column from right rep-
resents a string instrument (melody), the second column a
wind instrument, the third column percussion instrument 1,
the fourth column percussion instrument 2, and the leftmost
column the lyric. A note of melody is notated by a pitch name,
and percussion is notated by symbols of strokes. The black area
at the beginning of the score means that this piece of music has
an incomplete bar. This music score is called a jeongganbo.

If a vertical column in Figure 1 is drawn horizontally, it
looks like Figure 2, i.e., a haeng consists of six daegangs,
each of which consists of either 3 jeonggans or 2 jeonggans.
Therefore, the music score in Figure 1 has the pattern of
(3 3 2 3)5(3 2 3 3 2 3)5(3 2 3 3 2 3)5 · · · , where (3 3 2 3)
refers to the 3, 3, 2, and 3 squares in the rightmost column, and
(3 3 2 3)5 refers to the column set consisting of the rightmost
ﬁve columns (under the black box).
Figure 2 shows the names in the structure of the music
score.
Figure 2. The names in the structure of the music score
B. The meaning of the structure of the music score
The Neo-Confucian meaning of the music score is embed-
ded in the number of squares. This music score consists of
repetitions of 3+2+3=8 squares. In Figure 1, one haeng (i.e.,
column) consists of 16 squares, but in the original score made
by King Sejong one haeng consisted of 32 squares.
Figure 3 shows the meaning of the structure of the music
score.
Figure 3. The meaning of the structure of the music score
The Neo-Confucian meanings of the numbers in the music
score are shown in Figure 3. The numbers 3, 2, and 3 in a group
of 8 squares mean heaven, human, and earth, respectively,
and 8 means 8 diagrams from Neo-Confucianism, that is, one
season. The number 16 means music, which is a fundamental
doctrine of politics. One haeng (i.e., 32 squares) means one
year consisting of spring, summer, fall, and winter, and it is
repeated like a year [1], [2]. In this way, the structure of the
music score was designed based on the meanings of Neo-
Confucianism.
There has been research on the rhythm interpretation of
this music score since the late 1950s. At ﬁrst, there was a
theory that interprets one square as the unit of beat [3], but
it could not be used to play the music because the rhythm of
music interpreted by the theory was strange. Later, this theory
was slightly generalised to the theory that each square has the
same length in rhythm [4], [5], but it had similar problems.
Condit [6] and Hong [7] also proposed theories to interpret
the rhythm of the music score, but these did not reﬂect the
characteristics of Korean music.
III.
NOTATION PATTERNS
There were two types of music in the 15th century Joseon:
hyangak and dangak. Dangak is the music that came from
China, and its lyric was written in Chinese characters. Hyangak
is the indigenous music of Korea, and its lyric was written in
the Korean language. The music of the 15th century Joseon
was recorded in the music score with the following two
notation patterns [8], [9]. Dangak was recorded with notation
pattern 1, and hyangak was mostly recorded with notation
pattern 2.
•
Notation pattern 1: Melody, percussion, and lyric are
notated in the unit of 8 squares.
•
Notation pattern 2: Melody, percussion, and lyric are
notated in the unit of 5 squares and 3 squares.
We will investigate each notation pattern by examining a
representative music score of the notation pattern. The music
score is a full score that has the column set consisting of 4
columns representing melody, percussion 1, percussion 2, and
lyric.
A. Notation pattern 1: Rhythm with binary subdivision of a
beat
Notation pattern 1 has the unit of 8 squares, which makes
one beat, and one beat is subdivided into two half-beats (i.e.,
binary subdivision of one beat). But the binary subdivision
of the beat is not easy to record in the structure of 3+2+3=8
squares. In notation pattern 1, therefore, 3+2=5 squares repre-
sent a half-beat, and the following 3 squares represent the sec-
ond half-beat. In the ﬁrst half-beat, the ﬁrst 3 squares represent
a quarter-beat, and the following 2 squares another quarter-
beat. In the second half-beat, the ﬁrst 2 squares represent a
quarter-beat, and the following 1 square another quarter-beat.
Hence, notation pattern 1 has the rhythm shown in Figure 4.
That is, the pattern (((32)(21))((32)(21)))n in the music score
is interpreted as the rhythm (((aa)(aa))((aa)(aa)))n, where
‘a’ denotes a quarter-beat.
Figure 4 shows Notation Pattern 1.
Figure 4. Notation Pattern 1
Gimyeong (基命), an ancient song, which is a representa-
tive music passage in notation pattern 1, and its translation into
Western stave notation are shown in Figure 5. In this music
score, melody, percussions, and lyric are notated in the unit of
8 squares with occasional half-beats in melody. Each Chinese
character in lyric lasts two beats. In dangak, each Chinese
character has the same length in rhythm in most cases because
Chinese characters have almost equal weights in meaning. All
pieces of music in dangak were recorded in notation pattern 1,
which ﬁts well with Chinese traditional music that favours the
binary subdivision of the beat.
B. Notation pattern 2: Rhythm with ternary subdivision of a
beat
Notation pattern 2 has the unit of 5 squares and 3 squares,
which makes one beat, and one beat is subdivided into 3
one-third beats (i.e., ternary subdivision of one beat). The

Figure 5. Gimyeong
ternary subdivision of the beat is also not easy to record
in the structure of 3+2+3=8 squares. In notation pattern 2,
3+2=5 squares represent one beat, and the following 3 squares
represent another beat. In the ﬁrst beat of 5 squares, each of the
ﬁrst 2 squares, the following 1 square, and the last 2 squares
represent a one-third beat. In the second beat of 3 squares,
each square represents a one-third beat. Therefore, notation
pattern 2 has the rhythm shown in Figure 6, where one beat is
denoted by ‘♩.’ for notational convenience. That is, the pattern
((212)(111)(212)(111))n in the music score is interpreted as
the rhythm ((bbb)(bbb)(bbb)(bbb))n, where ‘b’ denotes a one-
third beat.
Figure 6 shows Notation Pattern 2.
Figure 6. Notation Pattern 2
Cheongsanbyeolgok (青山别曲), a song of the Goryeo
dynasty, which is a representative music passage in notation
pattern 2, and its translation into Western stave notation are
shown in Figure 7. In this music score, melody, percussions,
and lyric are notated in the unit of 5 squares and 3 squares. It
can be seen that Korean letters in lyric have different lengths
in rhythm. This piece of music is hyangak, descended from
the Goryeo dynasty, and was recorded in notation pattern 2,
which ﬁts well with indigenous music ‘hyangak’ that favours
the ternary subdivision of the beat.
Figure 7. Cheongsanbyeolgok
Following this historical narrative on the creation, develop-
ment and interpretation of Korean music scores, we proceed to
establish a framework suitable for related computational music
analysis using techniques from stringology.
IV.
OVERVIEW OF COMPUTATIONAL KOREAN
MUSICOLOGY
A. Stringology notation
Stringology is the mathematical study of strings of data,
that is sequences of symbols. Formally, given an integer n ≥ 1
and a nonempty set of symbols Σ (bounded or unbounded), a
string of length n, equivalently word, over Σ takes the form
x = x1...xn with each xi ∈ Σ. For brevity, we write x =
x[1..n] with x[i] = xi. We will assume that Σ is a totally
ordered alphabet. The length n of a string x is denoted by
|x|. The set Σ is called an alphabet whose members are letters
or characters, and Σ+ denotes the set of all nonempty ﬁnite
strings over Σ. The empty string of length zero is denoted ε;
we write Σ∗ = Σ+∪{ε} and let |Σ| = σ. We use exponents to
denote repetition, for instance if α ∈ Σ then α3 means ααα.
If x = uwv for strings u, w, v ∈ Σ∗, then u is a preﬁx, w is
a substring or factor, and v is a sufﬁx of x; we say u ̸= x is
a proper preﬁx and similarly for the other terms. If x = uv,
then vu is said to be a rotation (cyclic shift or conjugate) of
x. A string x is said to be a repetition if and only if it has
a factorization x = uk for some integer k > 1; otherwise, x
is said to be primitive. For a string x, the reversed string x is
deﬁned as x = x[n]x[n−1] · · · x[1]. A string x is a palindrome
if x = x. A string which is both a proper preﬁx and a proper
sufﬁx of a string x ̸= ε is called a border of x; a string is
border-free if the only border it has is the empty string ε.

PATTERNS 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

We ﬁrst illustrate this stringology notation for the patterns
in music described in Section II. The pattern 3323 is a string
over Σ, where Σ is the naturally ordered non-negative integers,
and the string has the border 3 and proper preﬁxes 3, 33, and
332. The string 3323 is a proper sufﬁx of the string 323323
and (3323)5 is a repetition. The string 1 is a factor of each of
the strings 111 and 212. The strings 111, 323323 and 212 are
all palindromes.
Clearly a string, a sequence of symbols over an alphabet
Σ, is a very fundamental and versatile representation of data.
A collection of related or collated strings is often referred to as
text. A core stringology task is pattern matching, the compu-
tation of patterns in strings, and arises in diverse areas of sci-
entiﬁc information and text processing, for instance: retrieving
information from a database, bioinformatics software utilies for
molecular biology investigations, text editors for the Internet,
data compression for Big Data, speech recognition, computer
vision, computational geometry, and cryptography. Further-
more, the alphabet letters in Σ can be generalized to sets lead-
ing to indeterminate, or equivalently degenerate, strings which
consist of sequences of nonempty subsets of letters over Σ. For
example, x = 51877392921115 is a string of integers whereas
x = {5, 3}{1, 1, 1}{8, 4}{3, 9, 0, 9}{2, 6, 1, 6}{7}{1, 3, 5, 7}
is a degenerate string over the integers.
The application of stringology algorithms to measuring
musical similarity was considered in [10] where it is also
expressed that this similarity is a rather subjective measure.
For instance, two otherwise identical musical packages might
differ only by being played in a different key or some notes
in one might have been recorded incorrectly – different deﬁ-
nitions of musical similarity could potentially require distinct
algorithmic solutions and both edit and hamming distances
have been proposed for these kinds of analyses. Approximate
matching methods were developed in [10] which measure the
distance between musical passages by looking at the distance
between the individual notes. String matching techniques such
as approximate matching with gaps (allowing skipping of
notes), polyphonic matching (searching for a pattern in a set
of sequences of notes), and approximate repetitions have also
been considered in computational musicology.
Ordering a set of strings is often used to enhance com-
putational efﬁciency such as with indexing techniques. If Σ
is a totally ordered alphabet then lexicographic ordering
(lexorder) u < v with u, v ∈ Σ+ means that either u is
a proper preﬁx of v, or u = ras, v = rbt for some a, b ∈ Σ
such that a < b and for some r, s, t ∈ Σ∗. We call the ordering
≪ based on lexorder of reversed strings co-lexicographic
ordering (co-lexorder). Using the ordered Roman alphabet:
compute < computer < music < musicology < score
while music ≪ score ≪ compute ≪ computer
≪
musicology. Ordering techniques can also capture patterns in
strings.
B. Application of stringology in musicology
In combinatorics on words, Lyndon words are (generally)
ﬁnite words (strings) which are lexicographically least amongst
all their cyclic rotations.
Deﬁnition 1 (Lyndon word): A string x over an ordered
alphabet Σ is said to be a Lyndon word if it is the unique
minimum in lexorder < in the conjugacy class of x.
Lyndon words are primitive, have deep connections with
algebra, and moreover, any string can be factored or de-
composed efﬁciently into Lyndon words [11] including for
degenerate strings [12]. Introduced by Lyndon in 1954 as
standard lexicographic sequences, Lyndon words have been
studied extensively and are ﬁnding an increasing range of
applications: string combinatorics and algorithmics including
specialized matching scenarios, computing the lexorder of
substrings, digital geometry, and bioinformatics. Our interest
here is applications of Lyndon words to musicology.
Consider the string 3323, which is part of the pattern of
the Korean music score in Figure 1. We will show that 3323
is not a Lyndon word while the conjugate 2333 is a Lyndon
word.

Although the string 3323 is not a Lyndon word it can be
uniquely factored into Lyndon words as (3)(3)(23).
Interestingly, Lyndon words have been applied in the analy-
sis of music repetition, or looping, which is a fundamental fea-
ture of music. When enumerating periodic musical structures
(repetitions), the computation is done up to a cyclic shift. In
this context, two strings, which are cyclic shifts of one another
are considered the same, and primitive Lyndon words, provide
a means to capture distinct representatives of the structure. In
[13], two examples of traditional African repertoires have been
analysed using Lyndon words: harp melodic canons played
by Nzakara people from the Central African Republic and
also asymmetric rhythmic patterns common to many cultures
of Central Africa. This stimulates our interest in potential
applications of Lyndon words to analysing Korean music.
We now deﬁne a non-lexorder called V -order [14]. Let
x = x1x2 · · · xn be a string over Σ. Deﬁne h ∈ {1, . . . , n}
by h = 1 if x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xn; otherwise, by the unique
value such that xh−1 > xh ≤ xh+1 ≤ xh+2 ≤ · · · ≤ xn.
Let x∗ = x1x2 · · · xh−1xh+1 · · · xn, where the star * indicates
deletion of xh. Write xs∗ = (...(x∗)∗...)∗ with s ≥ 0 stars.
Let g = max{x1, x2, . . . , xn}, and let k be the number of
occurrences of g in x. Then the sequence x, x∗, x2∗, ... ends
gk, ..., g1, g0 = ε. From all strings x over Σ we form the star
tree, where each string x labels a vertex and there is a directed
edge upward from x to x∗, with the empty string ε as the root.
Deﬁnition 2 (V -order): We deﬁne V -order ≺ between dis-
tinct strings x, y. First x ≺ y if in the star tree x is in the
path y, y∗, y2∗, . . . , ε. If x, y are not in a path, there exist
9

PATTERNS 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

smallest s, t such that x(s+1)∗ = y(t+1)∗. Let s = xs∗ and
t = yt∗; then s ̸= t but |s| = |t| = m say. Let j ∈ [1..m] be
the greatest integer such that s[j] ̸= t[j]. If s[j] < t[j] in Σ
then x ≺ y; otherwise, y ≺ x. Clearly ≺ is a total order on
all strings in Σ∗.
To illustrate the star tree using ordered integers, if x =
53638, then x∗ = 5368, x2∗ = 568 and x3∗ = 68; then since
68 is in the tree path we have 68 ≺ 53638.
We now introduce the V -order equivalent of the lexorder
Lyndon word:
Deﬁnition 3 (V -Word): A string x over an ordered alpha-
bet Σ is said to be a V -word if it is the unique minimum in
V -order ≺ in the conjugacy class of x.

Hence, we see that although 3323 is not a V -word, and
is in fact bordered, the conjugate 3332 of 3323 is a V -word.
However, note that each of the Korean music score patterns
32, 21 and 3221 are V -words.
Interestingly, the rhythmic pattern 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2
occurs in Aka Pygmies music [15], and this pattern forms a
V -word.

CONCLUSION: FROM IDEOLOGY TO PRACTICE
King Sejong invented a form of a music score based on
Neo-Confucian ideology. This music score has the structure,
which is a repetition of 3+2+3=8 squares, and this structure
embeds the meanings of heaven, human, earth, and four
seasons in a year. He recorded contemporary music of the
15th century into the music score using two notation patterns.
Notation pattern 1 records music with the binary subdivision
of one beat, and notation pattern 2 records music with the
ternary subdivision of one beat. In the late 16th century, these
music scores, which were originally used only in the palaces,
were handed down to aristocrats. From this time on the music
score gradually lost Neo-Confucian meanings and has been
transformed into notation patterns expressing the rhythm of
music more directly. In the 20th century the music score
‘jeongganbo’ ﬁnally abandoned Neo-Confucian meanings and
became a music score that reﬂected the rhythm of music
exactly.
This paper addresses computational musicology and has
initiated the application of stringology techniques for analysing
classical Korean musical patterns exhibited in both the struc-
ture and notation in the associated music scores. Lyndon words
and V -words are mathematical structures with interesting
combinatorial properties. By citing examples of patterns in
African music which form Lyndon words we raise the question
of using Lyndon words to analyse classical Korean music.
Further, examples have been given of V -words arising in the
structure of a Korean music score which indicate promising
directions for further study. The proposed line of research
impacts on the digital conservation of Korean culture and
heritage.
