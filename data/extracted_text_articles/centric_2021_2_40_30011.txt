Abstract—Email communication and newsletter campaigns
remain a signiﬁcant concern for companies. The main question
addressed here is how to optimize the form and content of a
newsletter so that it is not interpreted as spam or annoyance by
the recipient. We address this question by analyzing the emotions
and opinions conveyed by emails and evaluating how they affect
their open and click rate performance. We ﬁrst describe a
new dataset of French newsletters, and then we use emotional
embeddings to analyze the associations between emotions and
email performance. We ﬁnally derive clues on how to write
effective email campaigns.

sis; Emotion prediction; Emotion recognition; Email campaign
I. INTRODUCTION
Artiﬁcial intelligence is developing in many areas and is
increasingly used to determine and optimize business and mar-
keting strategies. In particular, Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques are widely used for the automatic analysis
of human interactions, and we exploit them to optimize email
communication by analyzing the content of newsletters.
More precisely, we focus on how emotions and opinions con-
veyed in an emailing campaign can inﬂuence its performance.
To address this question, we ﬁrst built a dataset of more
than 900 French newsletter campaigns provided by various
companies or associations.
We ﬁrst proposed vector representations of newsletters that
reﬂect emotion and sentiment using NLP techniques. We then
statistically analyzed the relationships between the emotions
and opinions conveyed by the newsletters and their perfor-
mance indicators, i.e., click and open rates. Finally, we used
the proposed vectorizations to evaluate the prediction of a
newsletter’s performance based on the emotions and opinions
in its text.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Marketing studies
We ﬁrst review some hypotheses formulated in marketing
science regarding email marketing optimization and their
potential links to emotions. A study proposed in 2008 by K.
Byron [1] suggests that the lack of face-to-face interaction
due to email communication can lead to misinterpretation of
emotions.
According to the author, the lack of cues that allow the
recipient to determine the intended emotions generally leads
to a neutrality effect. The design of the email may even
increase the likelihood that the recipient will perceive the email
negatively, resulting in a negativity effect. The author argues
that when the email contains few cues about emotions, the
ambiguity of the emotional tone increases the salience of all
negative information. For instance, sarcasm may be perceived
more negatively than in face-to-face interaction because of the
lack of context and tone ambiguity. The study also highlights
the importance of the social context of email communication
and the socio-demographic characteristics of the sender and
recipient (gender, age, relative status in the company, Etc.) in
interpreting emotions. Although the author points out some
positive consequences of the negativity effect, such as "using
less niceties or not "sugarcoating" the message," it should
be noted that the negativity effect can be problematic in the
context of marketing communication in which it is crucial to
elicit positive emotions such as pride [2] in order to expect
better actions from the customer, especially in western culture.
Furthermore, when the sender and recipient do not know
each other, there is even less contextual information to help
the recipient interpret the emotions correctly. Thus, there is
an increased risk of misinterpreting the emotions conveyed
by the email. On the other hand, in a recent study con-
ducted in the French context of the COVID-19 pandemic [3],
commercial communication by email seems to evolve from
purely informative content to more entertaining and emotional
content. Therefore, it is becoming crucial for companies that
the recipients do not misinterpret the emotions contained in
their emails.
B. Email content analysis
As mentioned before, we want to evaluate the impact of
textual content and email subject lines on the performance
of email campaigns by analyzing the emotions and opinions
they convey. This approach was used in [4] with email
subject lines, and their ﬁndings validated some hypotheses
on how emotions inﬂuence email perception. However, these
results are difﬁcult to transfer to our context for several
reasons, including language. Indeed, the authors investigated
the Enron dataset [5], a large set of emails in English from
150 employees, mainly executives, of the Enron company.
This type of resource does not seem to exist in French, and
many non-English speaking studies have to build their datasets
speciﬁcally for their tasks [6], [7].

Another major difference with the cited study is that we
consider both the subject and the textual content of the email.
C. Emotion Detection
In recent years, emotion detection in text has become
increasingly popular due to its wide range of applications. It
can be viewed as an extension to a more diverse emotional
spectrum of research on sentiment analysis which focuses
on positive and negative emotions. While many studies have
proposed their own approaches [8], one of the most common
is to use word lexicons labeled with categories of emotions.
These categories are often the six basic emotions proposed by
P. Ekman [9]: joy, fear, disgust, sadness, anger, and surprise.
This type of resource exists in French. A. Abadoui et al.
proposed the FEEL lexicon [10], composed of French words
or expressions represented by zero-one vectors of size 7.
Six entries indicate whether the word carries one of the six
basic emotions, and one represents the polarity associated with
the word. This lexicon was constructed automatically, from
the English NRC-Emolex lexicon, by crossing the results of
several automatic translators. A professional translator subse-
quently enriched the lexicon and validated the results. The
ﬁnal lexicon consists of 14,127 different lemmatized terms,
including 11,979 simple words and 2,148 compound words.
Each lemmatized form gets the emotions contained in all of
its inﬂected forms.
III. DATASET PRESENTATION
Our dataset is composed of newsletters from various orga-
nizations such as companies and associations. These organiza-
tions use the same customer relationship management (CRM)
system and design their emailing campaigns using the same
framework. The main objective of these organizations is to
inform their subscribers about events or new opportunities.
Our dataset does not include campaigns that target purchase
actions such as online shopping.
A newsletter’s performance can be measured by tracking the
included links, which provide the number of unique opens and
the number of unique clicks generated by the reader for each
newsletter. These are good indicators of the performance of an
email campaign and are commonly used in email analysis [11],
[12]. One can view the open rate as a measure of the email’s
attractiveness and the click rate as the engagement generated
by the newsletter.
After cleaning up the data provided by the CRM servers
and removing test emails and duplicates, we ended up with
973 newsletters, each sent to multiple subscribers, with their
performance information such as click rates and open rates.
The number of emails per customer is not balanced, as
illustrated in Figure 1. While this could represent a bias, we
assume it does not impact our analysis. Indeed, we focus on
features that can be considered independent of the email’s
author.

IV. DATA ANALYSIS
A. Features extraction
To process the data, we collected descriptive, emotional and
sentiment information about the newsletters. The descriptive
features were obtained directly from the data host and consist
of email subject line length, size of the .eml ﬁle sent, and
unique open and click rates.
We used standard NLP techniques to assess the emotion and
sentiment features of the newsletters. First, we segmented the
textual content of each newsletter into sentences from which
we extracted all words, excluding the French stop words.
For emotion analysis, we assigned to each word an emotion
vector according to the FEEL lexicon [10]. If a word is an
inﬂected form, we consider the vector associated with the
lemma as the aggregation of all emotions contained in its
inﬂected forms. Then, we computed the emotion vector of
each sentence as the average of the emotion vectors of its
constituent words. These vectors, constructed from the FEEL
lexicon, represent the six basic emotions described by P.
Ekman
For sentiment analysis, we evaluated the subjectivity and
polarity of the newsletters using the free NLP tool Python
TextBlob for Natural Language Processing. The textblob li-
brary, detailled by Klein and Loper [13], uses a built-in model
to compute subjectivity and polarity scores of sentences. A
subjectivity value close to 0 indicates objective text, while a
value close to 1 indicates highly subjective text. Polarity values
range from -1 to 1 and reﬂect the negativity or positivity of a
sentence, respectively.
At this point, each sentence is represented by a vector with
eight entries: six emotion scores from the FEEL lexicon and
two scores from the textblob analysis. For the full content of
the email, we aggregated the information from all sentences
by taking the average of all sentence vectors.
In addition to analyzing the newsletter content, we were
interested in the emotions conveyed by the email subject line,
its polarity, and subjectivity. We, therefore, performed the
same NLP processing as for the textual content of the email by
considering the subject line as a single sentence. We observed
36

CENTRIC 2021 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Advances in Human-oriented and Personalized Mechanisms, Technologies, and Services

that the emotion scores were almost all null, which led us to
consider only the polarity and subjectivity.
In the end, we represent the newsletters by vectors with
ten entries that express the emotions and opinions conveyed
by the content and topic of the email. Other studies [11]
have combined some of the features we consider with non-
emotional features, and we question whether emotion and
sentiment features are as discriminative as non-emotional
features in predicting performance.
B. Statistical results
We explored in our dataset the relationships between the
emotion and sentiment features of the newsletters and their
performance indicators, namely open and click rates.

The results are presented in Table I in terms of Pearson
correlation. It appears that classical descriptors such as subject
line length or ﬁle size signiﬁcantly correlate with performance.
Indeed, longer subject lines or heavier emails are associated
with fewer opens but more clicks if the email is opened.
More interestingly, all emotions conveyed by the email
content are negatively correlated with the click rate, regardless
of the type of emotion. Sadness is the emotion most negatively
associated with the click rate: the more sad the content of
the email, the fewer clicks are measured. On the other hand,
Table II sheds light on the relationships between the features
of the newsletters. One can see that polarity and subjectivity
are positively associated both in the text’s content and in the
email’s subject line. Content polarity is positively associated
with all emotions except fear and disgust. The signiﬁcance of
the correlations is even greater between content subjectivity
and emotions except for disgust. Finally, subject line subjec-
tivity is positively associated with all emotions except disgust,
while its polarity is only associated with joy.
On the other hand, emotions are, for the most part, posi-
tively associated with each other. If we focus on the highly
signiﬁcant correlations, in bold in the table, we can see that
surprise is positively correlated with all emotions except joy
and that disgust is associated with rather negative emotions
(fear, sadness, anger, and surprise). It also appears that fear
and sadness are particular emotions by their strong association
and their high correlation with all the emotions.

Emotion and sentiment features may not be the best pre-
dictors of newsletter performance, but we propose to evaluate
their effectiveness in predicting click rate in the following.
V. UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING
A. Multidimensional representation
We ﬁrst explored our data graphically to see if there is a
global structure that we could exploit. Since the newsletters
are represented in a 10-dimensional space, we used a dimen-
sionality reduction technique, namely the t-SNE (t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). This method is mainly used
to project high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces
(2D or 3D) while preserving local distances between data
points.
Fig. 2. t-SNE projection of our dataset
Figure 2 gives a visualization of our data in a 2D map.
The color associated with the newsletters ranges from blue
for "low-performing or bad" newsletters to red for "high-
performing or good" newsletters. There is no clear separation
between "good" and "bad" newsletters. However, it appears
that the "good" newsletters are more grouped while the "bad"
ones are more scattered across the map.
We investigate this hypothesis in the next section, using
unsupervised clustering.

B. K-Means approach
K-means clustering is a vector quantization method that
aims at partitioning a dataset into k clusters by assigning each
observation to the cluster with the closest center (or centroid).
The effectiveness of K-means depends highly on the chosen
number of clusters, and we usually do not have prior knowl-
edge of the number of clusters that correspond to the most
relevant clustering. A measure of the effectiveness of a cluster
is the silhouette coefﬁcient as introduced by Kaufman and
Rousseeuw [14]. It measures how similar an object is to its
cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The
value of the silhouette ranges between -1 and 1, where a high
value indicates that the object is well matched to its cluster
and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. We compute the
silhouette coefﬁcients of all points and average them to obtain
a global silhouette score. The clustering conﬁguration with the
best global silhouette score is the most relevant.
For a clustering in k clusters, the cohesion of a data point
i assigned to a cluster Ik is deﬁned as:
a(i) =
1
|Ik| − 1
X
j∈Ik,j̸=i
d(xi, xj)
(1)
where d(xi, xj) stands for the distance between the represen-
tative vectors xi and xj. We chose the cosine distance based
on the angle between vectors for its efﬁciency in clustering
textual data. The separation of point i is its average distance
to all points in the closest cluster to its cluster Ik:
b(i) = min k′̸=k
1
|Ik′| − 1
X
i′∈Ik′
d(xi, xi′)
(2)
The silhouette coefﬁcient of point i is then computed as:
ssilhouette(i) =
b(i) − a(i)
max (a(i), b(i))
if : |Ci| > 1,
ssilhouette(i) = 0
if : |Ci| = 1
(3)
We aim to cluster the newsletters using only their emotion
and sentiment features. However, some of these features are
signiﬁcantly correlated, as shown in Table II. We then used
PCA to denoise the data and construct a representation free
of redundant information.
We, therefore, had two hyperparameters to determine: the
appropriate number of principal components and the optimal
number of clusters. To this end, we used two criteria: the
ratio of variance explained by the PCA components and the
clustering silhouette score. Table III gives, for each number
of principal components, its explained variance rate, its as-
sociated optimal clustering and the corresponding silhouette
score.
It appears that the partition into two clusters is the best
clustering conﬁguration for most of the PCA representations.
We decided to consider eight principal components in the
subsequent analysis because they account for more than 91%
of the variance in our data set.

We compared the performance of the two resulting clusters
in terms of click rates, but the results were not conclusive.
The distributions of the click-through rates in the two clusters
are presented in Figure 3.
Fig. 3. Click rates in the two clusters obtained by k-means with 8 principal
components
As a result, the emotion and sentiment features alone
did not allow us to discriminate between "good" and "bad"
newsletters. Nevertheless, in the next section, we use another
approach based on supervised classiﬁcation.
VI. CLASSES OF PERFORMANCE PREDICTION
A. Classes of performance
To implement supervised classiﬁcation, we need to label our
data set. Following the considerations in the previous section,
we decided to create two performance classes around the
median click rate. One class contains the 50% of newsletters
that generate the fewest clicks, and the other class contains the
highest click rates. We refer to them as the "poor or lower-
performing" class and the "good or higher-performing" class.
Figure 4 gives the distribution of data silhouette scores by
performance class. Here, the embeddings cover all emotion
and sentiment features.
We observe that newsletters with lower click rates are more
dispersed around their class center than better performing
newsletters. This trend is even more marked when we do not

class (green), without subject line features
B. Supervised classiﬁcation
We are interested in evaluating the predictive power of
the ten emotion and sentiment features of the newsletters,
categorized into bad and good newsletters as deﬁned above.
For this purpose, we performed classiﬁcations of our dataset
with various machine learning methods [15]. Table IV presents
their performance measures estimated with 10-fold cross-
validation procedure.
It appears that the best classiﬁers are AdaBoost, Neural
Network, and Random Forest. We also notice that the per-
formance scores are very slightly lower without the subject
line information.
To measure the contribution of each feature in the pre-
dictive model, we tested "leave-one-out" and "one-at-once"
procedures with the best classiﬁer, Adaboost. In leave-one-
out experiments, we considered all but one feature, and in
one-at-once experiments, we considered one feature at a time.
The F1-scores presented in Table V are to be compared with
the F1-score of the full model, constructed with all predictors,
which is 0.723 (see Table III).

These results conﬁrm the impact of emotions and sentiment
on newsletter click rates, and as observed in Section IV,
sadness is the emotion with the most impact. We can also
see that text content subjectivity has a negative effect on
prediction. We should investigate these observations further
to improve our embeddings in future work.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explored to what extent emotion and
sentiment detection can help predict the performance of an
email campaign. Literature in the marketing ﬁeld suggests that
email communication generally results in a misunderstanding
of the emotions being conveyed and, due to negativity and
neutrality effects, these emotions are often misinterpreted as
neutral or negative by the recipient. When the recipient is a
potential customer or subscriber, this negative effect can lead
to unwanted behavior, measured with objective metrics such
as open rate or click rate.
We presented a dataset composed of French emailing cam-
paigns and represented them with emotion and sentiment

embeddings. Our study shows that almost all emotions are
negatively correlated with newsletter performance, especially
sadness.These results are consistent with the marketing litera-
ture, which suggests that negative emotions, such as sadness,
are well identiﬁed by the recipient, while positive emotions or
opinions in a text (represented by the subjectivity score) are
poorly understood.
In addition, we observed that the best-performing newslet-
ters have more homogeneous emotion and sentiment fea-
tures than the less-performing newsletters. This ﬁnding needs
further investigation to build a guide for writing effective
newsletter.
Finally, we used emotion and sentiment embeddings to
predict performance classes of our newsletters. The pre-
sented approach is perfectible, but it already constitutes a
good baseline for our future work on emotion detection in
French emails. Areas of improvement concern, in particular,
the hyper-parameters of the classiﬁers and the embeddings.
Moreover, we will soon provide the scientiﬁc community with
our dataset to enrich the French resources and allow interested
researchers to reproduce and improve our work.
