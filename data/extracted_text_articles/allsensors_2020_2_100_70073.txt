Abstract— Agricultural production has grown in recent years,
increasing the use of Organic Fertilizers (OF). For that reason,
the use of these compounds must be controlled in fertigation
water. In this paper, we test three prototypes, using different
combinations of coils, to determine the amount of OF in the
water. A coil is powered by a sine wave of 3.3 peak-to-peak
Volts for inducing another coil. The objective of this system is
to detect different kinds of problems that can cause incorrect
fertilization, which affects the sustainability of agriculture. We
present the tests to verify the proper functioning of the
prototypes. We test our prototypes by means of different
dilutions of OF. The used concentrations of OF are between 0
and 20 g/l. We measure the conductivity for each concentration
and the output voltage of our prototypes. The results show that
prototype 3 is the one that has the best performance, obtaining
1.47 V of difference between the maximum and minimum
output voltage and a good correlation coefficient. Finally, a
verification test is carried out; the average error in the
different samples tested is 0.2212%.

INTRODUCTION
The
use
of
fertilizer,
pesticides,
agriculture
mechanization, and high-yielding varieties of plants have
generated an increase in crop productions. This increase has
produced a decrease in food prices and reduced world
hunger. However, the use of fertilizer, pesticides, and large
agricultural machines causes essential problems in the
environment, which can cause a reduction in the production
of harvest in the future.
The use of an incorrect technique of fertilizing can cause
severe
problems
in
the
environment.
These
problems
include: (i) nitrification of groundwater, (ii) pollution of
surface water, (iii) transport of pollutants in soils, and
accumulation of fertilizer in soils [1][2]. In addition, the
excess of fertilizer causes an increment in the cost of
maintenance
of
the
crops
without
an
increment
of
production. Traditionally, fertilizers are used without any
control. Some farmers think that if production is poor, they
need to use more fertilizer. However, the correct fertilizer is
not being added even at the right points. For proper
fertilization of the crops, the right quantity and type of
fertilizer need to be used. If there is an excess of the
fertilizer, this excess is not used by plants, and it accumulates
in the soil or groundwater. In addition, the fertilizer can
increment the concentration of limited nutrients in the soil. If
a nutrient is limited in the soil, the plants cannot absorb the
fertilizer by growing. This will cause an excess of nutrients
in the soil because the nutrients are not absorbed by plants
[3]. The limiting nutrient can be defined as the nutrient that
is bioavailable in lower concentration than is used for
growing
biological
organisms.
This
causes
biological
organisms
to
not grow even
if they have
sufficient
concentrations of other nutrients. For this reason, it is
essential that fertilization does not produce huge imbalances
between the limiting nutrient and the other nutrients.
We can differentiate fertilizers using different criteria,
such as: (i) Simple or multi nutrient fertilizers, depending if
they are composed of one or more nutrients, (ii) Organic or
inorganic, and (iii) Fast or Slow release. The use of fertilizer
composed of one or more nutrients depends on the needs of
the soil. Generally, it is recommended to use multi nutrient
fertilizers. This is due to the fact that the increase of a single
nutrient ends up creating new limiting nutrients. The fast-
release fertilizers generate more pollution because they
escape rapidly from the area when the plants cannot absorb
them. Organic fertilizers commonly have slow release and
they are multi nutrient. In addition, the use of wastewater
sludge and compost of urban waste allows the recovery of
waste materials. Finally, the use of organic fertilizer and
water-saving politics have the potential to reduce the
emission of N2O (greenhouse gas) [4].
The use of sensors in crops has grown in the last years.
Different works have been developed, such as wireless
sensor networks for monitoring the state of the fruit, saving
water, detecting disease, etc. [5]. This new trend is called
precision
agriculture
and
involves
the
inclusion
of
monitoring
technology
in
agriculture
(sensors,
image
processing, etc.).
In this paper, we propose an inductive sensor to monitor
the use of organic fertilizer in irrigation. The selected
prototypes have been previously used to detect the illegal
dumping of wastewaters [6]. The proposed sensor is based
on two copper solenoid coils. One coil is powered by
alternative current and induces the other coil. We expect to
have a variation on the value of the induced voltage
according to the changes in the concentration of the organic
fertilizer. Our sensor is located in the pipes that distribute the
water in drip irrigation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, we present the related works. The methodology used in
the experiment is presented in Section 3. The results of the
different prototypes are presented in Section 4. Finally,
Section 5 shows the conclusions and future works.

RELATED WORK
In this section, we show different related work, and we
explain the advantages of our system.
A solution for reducing the use of fertilizer is using a
smart fertilizer. Feng et al. [7] proposed a controlled/slow-
release fertilizer. This fertilizer is composed of polymer
brushes of poly (N, N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate).
Usually, slow-release fertilizers have increased discharge of
nutrients with temperature and pH. This smart fertilizer has a
slower release. A similar solution was proposed by Boli et al.
[8].
They
studied
the
use
of
slow-release
fertilizer
formulations basis of natural attapulgite, clay, ethylcellulose,
film,
and
sodium
carboxymethylcellu-lose/
hydroxyethylcellulose hydrogel. Their study concluded that
the use of this fertilizer reduces nutrient loss, improves the
use efficiency of water, and prolonges irrigation cycles.
However, temperature, pH, and other soil properties can
affect nutrient releasing. The paper indicated that the
evaluation of soil organic matter content, soil texture,
residual soil N, right irrigation strategies, and cropping
systems need to be developed for reducing fertilizer use.
The use of slow-release organic fertilizers is a partial
solution to the contamination problem. However, the farmers
still ignore the amount of fertilizer that should be contributed
to the field (except based on their own experience, without
following
technical
criteria).
To
improve
fertilization
following technical criteria, some authors propose the use of
sensors. Vijayakumar and Nelson Rosario [9] used different
sensors for monitoring the water and fertilizer need. They
used leaf wetness, soil moisture, soil pH, and atmospheric
pressure sensors connected to 2.40 Hz MICAz mote,
MDA300CA. The soil moisture sensor has been used for
monitoring the water needs of the crop. For tracking the
fertilizer, the system sends an SMS to the farmer with the pH
value and it selects the amount of fertilizer. Zhang et al. [10]
used the information of sensors in the crops and big data for
determining the needs of water and fertilizer. The system is
composed of 4 modules. The first one is the data acquisition
system, the second one is the transmission data, the third is
the big data layer, and finally, the fourth is the decision layer.
The data acquisition is divided into a manual and automatic
collection. The automatic collection is composed of a
weather, soil, and crop growth sensors system. The manual
collection used information about types of plants, the period
of seedling, etc. These data are sent to a database with
wireless technology. In the database, they are saved for
future decisions. In the decision layer, the data are processed
with irrigation and growing models for making decisions and
to the historical archive of the crop data.
The use of inductive sensors has been reported in
numerous scientific articles. Wood et al. [11] developed a
system to measure the salinity. The system is based on two
sensors: a temperature sensor, i.e., conductivity sensor, and
a microcontroller. The two sensors are controlled by an
Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) microcontroller that
saves the data on a flashcard and sends the data. The
conductivity sensor is composed of two coils in solenoid
form (a powered and an induced coil) covered with 1-
dodecanethiol protection against corrosion. The temperature
sensor is used to adjust the values of conductivity to salinity.
The maximum measure of the sensor is 67 g/l of table salt.
In other papers, Parra et al. [12] developed a system
based on two coils for monitoring the conductivity in
aquifers. They studied the different design of the coils that
can be summarized in (i) changes in the number of spires
maintaining the spires relationship. (ii) change the relation of
spires. (iii) changes in the wire diameter (iv) change in the
coil diameter. They concluded that the best prototype has 80
spires in the induced coil, 40 spires in the powered coil, a
copper diameter of 0.4 mm, and 25 mm of coil diameter.
Rocher et al. [13] demonstrate the use of coils for monitoring
fertigation in crops. They compared the induced voltage
caused by table salt and nitromagnesium (a fast release
fertilizer). The different prototypes are composed of two
coils (powered coil and induced coil) in a solenoid form.
They concluded that prototypes with a powered coil of 40
spires and 80 spires in the induced coil are the better
prototypes in the two studied salts. They found differences in
the induced voltage depending on the salt that causes the
conductivity. However, both papers did not study the use of
organic fertilizer. It has less conductivity than inorganic
salts, which can modify the behavior of the coil.
In these papers, we can observe the use of sensors based
on coils for monitoring the conductivity of the water. As the
inorganic fertilizer is composed of mineral salts, they
suppose an increase in water conductivity. However, the OF
is composed of organic components that provide less
conductivity than inorganic fertilizers. Therefore, it is
necessary to check if it is possible to measure the
concentration of OF by using coil-based sensors.
III.
TEST BENCH
In this section, we describe the materials used in the coils
as well as the methodology used.
We created the coils with a PVC pipe, 3mm of thickness,
and a diameter of 25mm. Moreover, the length of the PVC
tube is 10cm. The copper used is enameled copper of 0.4
mm. We selected prototypes based on 40 spires in the
Powered Coil (PC) and 80 spires in the Induced Coil (IC)
from the previous works [12] and [13]. The copper is located
on PVC pipe distributed in 2, 4, or 8 layers. The values of
turns, layer numbers, and photography of the different
prototypes are shown in Table I. Also, the copper was coiled
in the clockwise direction in each one of the prototypes. This
helps to maintain a similar basis for all prototypes and to
obtain more relevant data. We power the coil in a clockwise
direction, using the other end of the coil as a ground
reference with a voltage of 3.3 Vpp, and we measure the
induced voltage with an oscilloscope.
We have added a resistance of 47 Ohm in series to the
PC. The induced coil has a capacitor of 10 nF in parallel. The
model of the signal generator is AFG1022 [14], and the
oscilloscope is TBS1104 [15]. The conductivity of the
samples is measured with a conductivity model Basic 30
[16]. We tested it with concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10,
12.5, 15, 17.5, 20 g/l of organic fertilizer.

In all tests, we prepared 500 mL of the sample that was
introduced in a glass. The glass has a height of 16.2 cm and 8
cm of diameter. We used 6 out of 9 samples for calibrating
the sensor. The other 3 samples were used for verification of
the sensor functioning. In Figure 2, we can observe the
experiment being carried out.
The induced voltage measurements have been taken by
varying the value of the frequency in the signal generator.
They have been tested in a frequency range of 10 to 300 kHz
every 10 kHz. This process has been carried out for all the
samples we have mentioned above.
IV.
RESULTS
In this section, we show the obtained results of the
different concentrations of organic fertilizer. Firstly, we test
the prototype behavior in a specific spectrum of frequency.
Next, we do the calibration of the sensors to verify the best
R2 (similarity between the mathematical model and the
points we are trying to predict) with the obtained data. Then,
we analyze the precision and exactitude of the results.
Finally, we select the best prototype.
Figure 2. Experimental setup.
A. Prototype behavior
The first step is to analyze the response of the three
prototypes that we include in this test. Therefore, three
samples with different concentrations of OF are used. The
objective of this part of the experiment is to find the
Working Frequency (WF) of the sensors to use this WF for
the calibration. The WF is the frequency in which the
prototype has the maximum difference in the induced
voltage between the lowest and the highest concentrations of
the OF.
For this test, we used three samples of 0, 5, 20 g/l,
respectively. We have used a maximum concentration of
20g/l due to the fact that the level of fertilizers does not
usually exceed this threshold in the irrigation of the fields.
Besides, the conductivity of the samples has been measured
using the EC meter model Basic 30, which is a professional
conductimeter, to obtain the most exact values. The results
obtained with this device are 0.37, 1.13, and 6.14 mS/cm.
The obtained results with these prototypes are shown
below. Figure 3 represents the results of P1. We can see that
the range, in which the Magnetic Field (MF) generated by
the coil shows more significant interaction, is between 90
and 110 kHz. Even though the peak is found at 100 kHz, the
maximum difference of Inductive Voltage (Vout) between
the lowest and highest concentrations is obtained at 90 kHz.
Next, the behavior of P2 is displayed in Figure 4. According
to Figure 4, the most sensitive region of the MF is between
90 and 130 kHz, with a peak at 120 kHz. The most
significant change occurs at 110 kHz. Finally, in Figure 5,
we present the portion of the spectrum in which the P3 works
better. This range goes between 120 and 150 kHz. The peak
is located at 140 kHz, which is the working frequency.
In the case of P1 at the WF, the lowest Vout is related to
the smallest conductivity and the highest output with the
biggest value of conductivity. P2 shows the same behavior as
P1. Besides, P3 exhibits another way to work. In this case,
the lowest conductivity is related to the highest Vout in
Figure 5, and the lowest Vout is for the highest conductivity.

Figure 5. Representation of the frequency spectrum of P3.
All the prototypes showed a very similar range in which
the generated MF and Vout are more sensitive to changes in
the conductivity of the environment. Nonetheless, the way in
which they respond to this change in the environment is
different between them.
It will be necessary for these prototypes to perform some
requirements in order to be selected as sensors:

The Vout obtained must be as high as possible,

The difference of Vout between the different quantities of
organic fertilizer must be high (IV difference),

The Vout for all tested dissolutions must be different, and

The working frequency must be as low as possible (At
smaller frequency cost decreases).
B. Calibration of prototypes
After scanning in a wide frequency spectrum, the results
of the peaks for P1, P2, P3 have been analyzed. The highest
difference of Vout between 0 and 20 g/l (IV difference)
indicates the WF for each prototype, as can be seen in Table
II. The three prototypes have been tested for their WF using
the Statgraphics program [17]. Statgraphics is used to obtain
the mathematical model for all the prototypes and observe
how these adapt to the collected data. In addition, we use this
program to calculate the confidence interval and the
prediction interval.
The calibration of P1 is reflected in Figure 6. The best
model which fits with the experimental points is the potential
model. Besides, it has been realized the confidence interval
and the prediction interval of the model that shows a good
correlation between the Vout and the conductivity. Likewise,
the model of P2 has been obtained. This is represented as a
potential model (Figure 7). In this case, the confidence
interval and the prediction interval are more separated from
the model that describes the lowest correlation of the values
than in the P1. Finally, the model of P3 is shown in Figure 8.
The best fit model is an exponential model. In this prototype,
the values of the output voltage decrease with the increase of
the conductivity. The prediction interval and the confidence
interval are more tithed than in the P2 ,but less than in the
P1, although the correlation of the experiment point is
excellent.
The

the
sensors

conductivity of the different concentrations of organic
fertilizers. The mathematical models of the three kinds of
prototypes are shown in (1)-(3).

The R2 of the models are 0.9937, 0.9852, and 0.9923 for

C. Accuracy of the values
The last step is to obtain the verification of the prototypes
P2 and P3. P1 has not been estimated because the difference
of Vout between the lowest and highest concentration is
under 1V. To obtain these results, we use the data of Vout
and conductivity of our measurements on new samples of
5g/l, 10 g/l, and 15 g/l.
The values of Real Voltage (RV) and Model Voltage
(MV) for P2 and P3 are represented in Table III. The RV is
the Vout that was measured in the laboratory. Moreover, MV
is the theoretical value according to the model of (2) for P2
and (3) for P3.
The absolute error and the relative error are calculated
and represented in Table III. On the one hand, the absolute
error is the difference between the Real voltage and the
Model voltage. On the other hand, the relative error is the
absolute value divided by the real value (in the two cases, it
can be a positive or a negative value).
Our results indicated that P2 has 0.03 V of absolute error
and 0.32 V of relative error. Meanwhile, P3 has 0.01 V and
0.22 V of absolute and relative error. As can be seen, the
highest errors are found in P2, where the lowest error is in
P3. This shows that P3 has the most significant accuracy of
the values, unlike P2, which has the lowest accuracy.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented an inductive sensor for
monitoring OF in agriculture. The obtained parameters can
be used to control the amount of OF that the irrigation water
has.

TABLE III. ACCURACY OF THE VALUES
After we performed the measurements, we determined
that the highest Vout is for P2, which shows a value of 9.81
V in the WF. P1 and P3 obtained 6.53 V and 7.65 V.
Moreover, the biggest difference between 0 and 20g/l is
given in P3, with 1.47V. In P1 and P2, the obtained results
are 0.39 V and 1.41 V. Correspondingly, the lowest working
frequency is presented in P1 in the 90 kHz, while the WF of
P2 and P3 were 110 kHz and 140 kHz. Observing the
absolute and relative error, the best accuracy is for P3,
followed by P2.
Finally, we choose P3 as the best prototype to measure
OF. Although the results of P1 are right, the difference
between different concentration is very low.
In future works, we are going to study the effect of the
extreme temperatures on the values of the measures.
Furthermore, tests with different kinds of organic fertilizers
will done.
