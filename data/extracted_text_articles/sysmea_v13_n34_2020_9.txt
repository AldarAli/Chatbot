Abstract—In the future, more and more cars will be equipped
with Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) like Adaptive
Cruise Control (ACC), Collision Avoidance System and many
more. Currently, the driver is held responsible by law to perceive
the environment and take over control if it is required. But
in foreseeable future highly automated vehicles or even fully
automated vehicles will appear on the road; where the vehicle
is responsible for perceiving the environment, operating the
vehicle and intervening in hazardous situations. By then it will
be necessary that systems must not fail unnoticed. Therefore,
it is mandatory to monitor safety relevant components. For
instance Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Systems like the
1D Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) Micro-Scanning
LiDAR, which will be part of intelligent sensor fusion in future
ADAS. As a matter of course various safety monitors and safety
devices are installed in highly automated vehicles to ensure an
appropriately high level of safety. To further increase the safety
level of the entire environmental perception system, we propose
our novel Monitors for the Safety-Critical MEMS Driver of the
LiDAR part in the sensor fusion unit. In this publication, we
introduce novel system architectures that are able to verify the
correct operation of internal control systems in MEMS-based
LiDAR systems respectively to assess the reliability of the MEMS-
based LiDAR in the sensor fusion unit of the entire environment
perception system. To evaluate the effectiveness of our novel
monitoring approaches, we implemented the procedures on a 1D
MEMS Micro-Scanning LiDAR prototype platform.

INTRODUCTION
With fully automated driving gaining more and more
attention, industry and academia put a lot of effort into research
in the ﬁeld of sensor fusion and functional safety for sensors in
the automotive domain. Key enablers of highly automated ve-
hicles will be robust Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR)
and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) solutions with
additional support from vision cameras. Through fusion of
sensor data and control functions enabling safe automated
driving in rural as well as in urban environments is possible.
In the project PRogrammable sYSTems for INtelligence in
automobilEs (PRYSTINE) the consortium aims at a Fail-
operational Urban Surround perceptION (FUSION) [2]. For
This publication is an extended Version of the “Monitor for Safety-Critical
Mirror Drivers of MEMS Micro-Scanning LiDAR Systems” [1] publication,
which was published in the Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference
on Performance, Safety and Robustness in Complex Systems and Applications.

years various Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS),
such as Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock
Braking System (ABS) have been mandatory in new cars in
the European Union [3]. ESC and ABS are ADAS, which
are active safety components in contrast to passive safety
components, such as seat belts and airbags [4]. For highly
automated vehicles it is indispensable that ADAS are high-
ly reliable and therefore ensure the safety for the driver,
passengers and all other road users. Due to the increasing
quantity and high reliability requirements of such ADAS and
integrated systems the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
has introduced six levels of driving automation. A higher
SAE level describes a higher level of driving automation of
the vehicle. Due to the responsibilities that the systems take
over the vehicle, it is possible to declare the SAE level of
the vehicle [5]. Regardless of whether a vehicle, according
to the manufacturer, would support higher automation levels,
it is currently necessary in many countries that the driver
continues to observe the environment and in an emergency
takes over control [6]. For example, according to Article 8 of
the Vienna Convention on Road Trafﬁc, the driver must be able
to continuously control the vehicle. The Vienna Convention
on Road Trafﬁc was ratiﬁed by the majority of EU member
countries and several others. Large countries, such as the
USA, China or England, are not among the signatories [7].
Due to legal and technical barriers driving automation levels

currently do not go beyond SAE level 2. From a legal point
of view it will be necessary to adapt laws for introduction of
vehicles with SAE Level 3 and greater in the future, as well
as developing ADAS with higher levels of safety, reliability
and availability. In projects like PRYSTINE, the goal is to
develop components and systems for highly reliable and safe
ADAS [2]. To ensure the proper functionality of systems it is
mandatory to monitor said systems, especially parts which are
safety critical. In case of a malfunction, the system has to be
aware of its degraded state and in the worst case suspended
its operation. Hence, these safety monitors are essential for
ADAS in vehicles of SAE level 3 and above. Misbehaviour of
a system is only detectable if the system is being monitored
continuously. Therefore, we engaged in monitoring the Safety-
Critical Mirror Driver of a 1D MEMS Micro-Scanning LiDAR
System.
With our paper contribution we:
•
Create a novel test opportunity for control loops.
•
Ensure the detection of malfunctions during test run.
•
Enable a reliability assessment of the LiDAR system.
•
Allow for early warning about imminent failures of
the LiDAR system.
•
Enhance safety with diverse monitoring approaches.
Following aspects will be discussed: The overview on
related work of MEMS-based LiDAR systems and several
monitoring approaches are given in Section II. Architectures of
novel safety monitors for the Safety-Critical Mirror Driver in
a MEMS-based LiDAR System will be presented in detail in
Section III and the achieved results including their discussion
will be provided in Section IV. The summary and short dis-
cussion of the ﬁndings will conclude this paper in Section V.

types of MEMS-scanner concepts. A crucial differentiating factor is
whether one moving axis (as depicted by Krastev et al. [10]) or
two moving axes (such as [11] or [12]) are implemented. While
the 1D approach typically deﬂects a vertical laser beam line into
the scenery and performs a horizontal scanning (see also Figure 3),
the 2D concept deﬂects a laser point or narrow line and performs
vertically as well as horizontally scanning. Furthermore, there are
mirrors which are driven in resonance (robust against shocks and
vibration, instantaneous measurement of the position for all angles is
not required) or without resonance (prone to shocks and vibrations,
difﬁcult to control due to the inevitable ringing which needs to be
suppressed by a control loop). This work focuses on the resonant 1D
MEMS mirror, because this speciﬁc setup enables higher scanning
frequencies compared to 2D approach and provides high robustness
against external perturbations (such as shocks and vibrations which
are given in transportation).
Summarizing, even though the LiDAR research community is
highly active, there is still a huge gap concerning a realizable long-

LiDAR, which is able to perceive the environment up to

applications due to its robustness [8]. The functional principle
of the 1D MEMS-based LiDAR by Druml et al. is depicted
in Figure 3. Several lasers are shot on the 1D MEMS mirror.
A vertical laser beam is deﬂected by the mirror and sent into
the scenery. This vertical line is moved horizontally across
the Field-of-View(FoV) by oscillation of the mirror and the
reﬂected light of the obstacle is captured by a stationary
detector.
A. 1D MEMS Micro-Scanning LiDAR
In this section, the 1D MEMS-based LiDAR System by
Druml et al. is presented. The system concept of the MEMS-
based LiDAR is depicted in Figure 2. Generally Druml et al.’s
system consists of an emitter path, a receiver path and the
System Safety Controller (AURIX). The emitter path includes
a laser illumination unit, the MEMS mirror and the actuation
and sensing unit of the mirror, the MEMS Driver ASIC. Within
the receiver, an array of photo diodes and the receiver circuitry
is included. The System Safety Controller is the central unit,
which is responsible for monitoring, controlling and signal
processing. Regarding the signal processing part, the task of
the System Safety Controller is to compute and provide a 3D
point cloud for dedicated ADAS [8]. Due to the dependence
of correct position, direction and veriﬁcation signals from the
mirror, the Driver ASIC, which is responsible for the actuation
and sensing of the MEMS mirror, is described in particular.
The MEMS Driver provides crucial signals to the System
Safety Controller. Thereby it is mandatory that the delivered
information is reliable. By reference to the correctness of these
crucial signals, the System Safety Controller will create a
plausible 3D point cloud with the raw data from the receiver
circuits. If the crucial signals were corrupted, the 3D point
cloud would be useless due to wrong assumptions of the
reﬂected laser origin.
In Figure 4, the crucial signals are illustrated, which
are provided by the MEMS Driver ASIC. These signals are
needed to monitor the current status of the MEMS mirror
during operation. The POSITION L represents whether the
mirror is aligned to the left or to the right side; logical high
means an alignment to the left and logical low to the right.
DIRECTION L indicates in which direction the movement is
directed; logical high means moving to the left and logical
low to the right. Precise and high-frequent phase information

of the current mirror position is provided by a PHASE CLK
signal that counts from 0 to nmax in equal time steps during
one mirror oscillation. Furthermore, an ANGLE OK signal is
available in addition to the tracking signals. This ANGLE OK
signal notiﬁes the System Safety Controller when the Driver A-
SIC operates according to the programmed speciﬁcation (e.g.,
angle setpoint is reached). To be able to ensure functional-
, eye-, and skin-safety this notiﬁcation is mandatory: MEMS
mirror’s current position and MEMS Driver ASIC’s internal
position information must match to allow the laser to be
emitted [8].
B. Test Facilities
One of the major objectives of the automobile industry is
to evolve individual trafﬁc. The coexistence of partially, highly
and fully automated cars will be the reality in the near future.
In conventionally equipped vehicles, the driver is responsible
for environmental perception, operation of the vehicle and
intervention in hazardous situations. In prospective automated
cars more and more competences will move from the driver to
the car. Based on information, which is obtained from ADAS,
the vehicle will make decisions. Therefore, it is obviously
necessary that this information is reliable. To ensure safe and
reliable operation of ADAS and their embedded components
like LiDAR, it is mandatory to test the behavior for correctness.
BISTs and a wide variety of safety monitors can be used for
this purpose.
1) Built-In Self-Test:
A Built-In Self-Test (BIST) operates simultaneously with the
circuit and is monitoring or checking the output of a circuit
to check its validity. The BIST needs a strategy for generating
input signals for the circuit and has to know how to evaluate
the correlated output. The circuit or device which is tested is
called the Circuit Under Test (CUT). A basic BIST architecture
is shown in Figure 5. A realization of a BIST fundamentally
needs to implement four new functions within the existing
system. First of all, there is the Test Pattern Generator (TPG),
which is responsible for generating the input signals for the
test. The test pattern consists of multiple sets of test cases,
which theoretically simulate all possible combinations of input
signals. The complement to the TPG is the Output Response
Analyzer (ORA). Its task is to know every correct output

provide precise information of the mirror’s momentary position, as
illustrated in Figure 7. When the mirror crosses its zero position, the
position signal changes. When the mirror is at its maximum deﬂection
angle, the direction signal changes. A PHASE CLK signal, which

response of the CUT and decides whether the current output
is faulty or valid. To create a meaningful and valid test it is
important to isolate the test from any other input. Therefore,
the Input Isolation Circuitry (IIC) is implemented. Its task is
to decouple all input signals, which are commonly provided
to the CUT and replace them with test-signal coming from the
TPG. Last, but not least to synchronize the behaviour of the
TPG, ORA and IIC the Test Controller is implemented. First
it initializes a speciﬁc test, then decouples the System Inputs
and ﬁnally activates the ORA which then outputs a Fail or
Passed signal [10][11].
2) Safety Monitor Approaches:
Beside BISTs there are also other monitors, which verify the
behavior of circuits and whole systems. Schuldt et al. [12],
for example, strive to test and validate ADAS efﬁciently
by referencing systematically generated virtual test scenarios.
The idea hereby is to identify the factors that affect the
assistance system. Hence, the test scenarios will be generated.
By reference to the test scenarios a test will be executed and
due to the variety of scenarios an evaluation of the results can
be done. Another approach to monitor ADAS is presented by
Mauritz et al. [13]. With this approach, results obtained from
simulations are transferred to road scenarios. They ensure a
consistent behavior of the ADAS in both worlds due to a
simulation of realistic driving conditions and by utilization of
a set of runtime monitors. Furthermore, Meany [14] illustrates
that Integrated Circuits (IC) provide the basis for all modern
safety-critical systems. According to Meany, besides redundant
and diverse development, it is necessary to monitor the ICs to
achieve fault-tolerance. There are several ways to monitor the
IC during operation. Meany addresses several opportunities of
IC diagnostics in his paper.
3) On-Board Diagnostic Systems:
The California Air Research Board (CARB) was established in
1967 as commission of experts to draw up legislative proposals
for control of air pollution. The idea of On-Board Diagnostic
(OBD) systems for vehicles was then born on the one hand
by CARB and on the other hand by the car manufacturers
themselves in the 1970s. McCord [15] explains in his book,
how it came about from the establishment of this agency in
1967 to the OBD protocols that are standardised today. OBD-I,
all standards before OBD-II was introduced, dealt with engine
malfunctions and emission equipment malfunctions. OBD-I
and OBD-II are well described in several publications [15],
[16], [17]. In difference to the OBD-I regulations in which
only a limited number of components had to be monitored,
the current OBD-II regulations include monitoring of a wide
range of components and systems that in turn also monitor
components. The fundamental strategy behind the OBD II
system is unchanged from the OBD-I system: OBD-II systems

monitor emission-related components. When a problem is
detected, the driver of the vehicle is alerted by the illumination
of the so-called Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) on the
dashboard. The MIL can be triggered under a variety of
conditions, as Durbin et al. [18] described in their publication.
In the case of sporadic faults (e.g., due to a loose contact),
the MIL may turn off after the fault has disappeared or after
the next engine start. Otherwise, this can only be done by
reading out and clearing the fault memory at the workshop.
This approach can also be pursued for other monitors. For
highly automated vehicles, a system degradation can be logged
and further examined with similar approaches.

CORE CONCEPTS AND ARCHITECTURES
In this section, we present our concepts and architectures
for novel safety monitors of MEMS-based LiDAR systems.
The reliability of the Driver is a sensitive topic. Therefore,
it is indispensable to monitor and test the Driver extensively
and diverse. Thus, we introduced novel procedures to enable
testing and monitoring the Driver component.
A. Novel Safety-Critical Mirror Driver Monitor
The ﬁrst procedure, we present in our publication is a
novel safety monitor for the Driver to check the functionality
of the phase-locked loop (PLL) control. It is a procedure to
evaluate the correct operation of a control loop, while the
system is not in use. For deeper insight into this concept of the
procedure, the architecture and process ﬂow will be described
in the following. At ﬁrst, the architecture modiﬁcations are
highlighted and described. Furthermore, we go through the
process ﬂow of the monitoring and test period. With this new
monitor there is another possibility to detect faults in the Driver
module at an early stage and to take appropriate measures
beforehand. In case of detected faults, for example, the System
Safety Controller will be informed and the LiDAR system
can be degraded or disabled accordingly. Due to the diversity
of the testing module it should be possible to prevent prior
undetectable faults even better.
In Figure 6, the modiﬁed block diagram is illustrated. In
principle, it is a common PLL, which is essential for the
MEMS mirror actuation, the System Safety Controller, the
MEMS mirror and our novel Safety-Critical Mirror Driver
Monitor (SCMDM). The HV(On/Off) signal sets the points
in time in the internal schedule at which the High Voltage
(HV) is switched on or off. This internal schedule is managed
by the Mirror Subtiming block. How fast or slow this schedule
is processed depends on the PLL and therefore we aimed
at testing the PLL on its functionality. For this purpose we
designed a SCMDM and adapted the existing architecture and
integrated our novel monitor. The core of the SCMDM consists
of a mirror simulation part and a decision part. The decision
part is responsible to evaluate the test run and notiﬁy the
System Safety Controller. With the begin of the test run and the
accompanying monitoring of the system, it is also necessary to
decouple the Driver from the physical MEMS mirror. Hence
switches for the Zero-Crossing measured (ZCmeas) and High
Voltage On/Off (HV(On/Off)) signals were implemented. To
start the test run the SCMDM block disables the switch
for ZCmeas signal by Zero-Crossing forwarding stop (ZCfs)
signal and the switch for HV(On/Off) signal by High Voltage
forwarding stop (HVfs) signal. Furthermore, the SCMDM
notiﬁes the System Safety Controller of the test run by the
Control Loop Test Mode (CLTM) signal.
After a test run is started the Zero-Crossing simulated
(ZCsim) signal is forwarded to the Phase Error Detector (PD)
block instead of the ZCmeas signal. A test run can be started
at a vehicle startup or even while stopping in front of a
trafﬁc light. In case of a vehicle startup, the frequency of
the simulated MEMS mirror movement is set to a random
but plausible frequency. Otherwise, the frequency is set to a
different frequency than the actual mirror swing to test and
monitor the behaviour of the MEMS Driver during control
operation. To be able to adapt the simulated frequency to the
Zero-Crossing (ZC) a MEMS Mirror Movement Simulation
Controller (MMMSC) is implemented in the simulation part
of the SCMDM. By reference to the PLL error this controller
is adapting the simulated MEMS mirror frequency and works
contrary to the PLL. Due to the characteristics of the MEMS
mirror in regard to acceleration and deceleration, the control
loop of the simulation must take these into account. This is
necessary to be able to emulate the physical MEMS mirror’s
behavior after frequency increase respectively decrease. The

acceleration of the mirror requires more energy effort than its
deceleration. Thus, the integrator values have to be chosen
accordingly to that fact. An overview of the process ﬂow of
this procedure is depicted in Figure 7. The test cycle and
monitoring procedure is divided into the following steps:
1)
Checking for Driving Cycle
The operational state of the vehicle is continuously
examined whether the vehicle is in the driving or not.
A stopped driving cycle is, for example, a vehicle
stop before a trafﬁc light or a vehicle start. A test
cycle with subsequent mirror restart is usually shorter
than one second. In both cases, trafﬁc light stop and
vehicle start, there is at least 1s time to perform the
test and monitoring cycle. Hence, the SCMDM is
started after a stop of the driving cycle is detected.
2)
Enable Safety-Critical Mirror Driver Monitor
After the driving cycle check green lights the test the
SCMDM is enabled and notiﬁes the System Safety
Controller via the CLTM signal about the test cycle.
The next step is to adjust the frequency for the
simulated mirror.
3)
Frequency Adjustment
On the basis of a simulated mirror movement the
adequate and orderly function of the MEMS Driver
ASIC’s PLL shall be proven. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to set a start frequency for this simulated mirror
with a signiﬁcant difference to the actual frequency of
the physical MEMS mirror. In case of a vehicle start it
is only necessary to choose a frequency within given
limits of the physical MEMS mirror. If the MEMS
mirror has already been in operation, the frequency
to be set must then be selected within plausible limits
and the selected frequency must also be sufﬁciently
different from the actual mirror frequency. After the
initial frequency of the mirror simulation is set the
system has to be decoupled from the physical MEMS
mirror during the test cycle.
4)
Decoupling
Switches have been integrated into the existing ar-
chitecture to decouple the system from the MEMS
mirror. By means of HVfs the HV(On/Off) signal is
decoupled from the physical mirror and thus prevents
an unintended mirror actuation. During the test phase,
the mirror is actuated in an open loop mode with the
HV(On/Off) value, which is conﬁgured before the
test is started. In order to prevent a disturbance of
the control loop during test mode by the ZC of the
physical mirror, the ZCmeas signal is switched off.
Thereby pnly the ZCsim signal is forwarded to the
PD block and the PLL is not affected due to two
different, actual and simulated ZC, signals.
5)
PI Control
Afterwards the control of the PLL and the simulated
mirror frequency starts. The PLL is operating as usual
and tries to match the internal adjusted frequency
with the simulated mirror frequency. The simulated
mirror is also adapting the frequency with respect
to the speciﬁcs of the acceleration and deceleration
of the physical mirror. By reference to the obtained
PLL error the MEMS Mirror Movement Simulation
(MMMS) part is informed whether an acceleration
(frequency increase) or a deceleration (frequency
decrease) has to be simulated. It is necessary to know
whether the simulated mirror needs to be accelerated
or decelerated because the integrator values of accel-
eration and deceleration differ. Due to the difference
in energy consumption between acceleration and de-
celeration. This regulation happens until either the
simulated mirror has the desired frequency or a time
limit is reached.
6)
End of PI Control
a)
Control Success
After the control process was successful,
the SCMDM is disabled and the physical
MEMS mirror is integrated into the control
system again instead of the simulated one. To
re-integrate the MEMS mirror, the ZCmeas
signal is forwarded to the PD block and the
HV(On/Off) signal of the Mirror Subtiming
block is forwarded to the Analog Core that
connects to the physical mirror.
b)
Control Abort
In case the control is aborted by reaching
the time limit, the SCMDM is also disabled.
In contrast to successful control, however, a
notiﬁcation of failure is transmitted to the

System Safety Controller. The System Safe-
ty Controller is then responsible for further
measures. Such measures could be a further
test run or a degradation of the system.
7)
Encoupling
After the test run is ﬁnished, the physical mirror is
coupled back into the system. This works in principle
similar to the start-up procedure. The physical mirror
in open loop mode is put back into closed loop mode
by activating the PLL. This completes the test run
and the system continues to operate as usual.
With this novel procedure there is the possibility to check
the function of a control loop for MEMS-based LiDAR system-
s. Especially for safety-critical components in environmental
perception systems, it is important due provide diversity in
addition to redundancy of tests and monitoring. The most
important thing is to ensure the correct operation of the systems
that provide information for ADAS and other sensor fusion
components. Section IV discusses and explains the results of
the novel monitor approach.
B. Continuous Disturbance Veriﬁcation Safety Monitor
The second procedure, we present in our publication, is
a novel safety monitor for the MEMS Driver to continuously
check the system for disturbances. This procedure is focused
on disturbances in the control loop, which can be detected via
the provided PLL error during the system runtime. To obtain a
more detailed understanding of this concept of the procedure,
the architecture and process ﬂow will be discussed in the
following. First of all the architectural changes are highlighted
and described. Furthermore, the process ﬂow of the monitoring
and degradation steps will be illustrated. Another possibility
for disturbance detection and the corresponding degradation
measures is made possible by this new type of monitor. For
example, if a reoccurring disturbance is detected, measures can
be taken depending on the severity of the disturbance, ranging
from partial degradation to complete degradation of the LiDAR
system. As a result it should be possible to degrade supposedly
malfunctioning MEMS-based LiDAR systems in sensor fusion
units of environment perception systems.
Figure 8 shows the block diagram of a common PLL ar-
chitecture with the modiﬁcations for the integrated Continuous
Disturbance Veriﬁcation Safety Monitor (CodeIso) and the
System Safety Controller. The PLL is responsible for matching
the frequencies of the MEMS mirror and the MEMS Driver.
With a constant low PLL error, the frequencies of the MEMS
mirror and MEMS Driver are approximately equal. If the
PLL error increases, this may be due to several reasons.
It can be caused, for example, by an frequency adaption
during the adjustment phase to the new frequency or by a
massive shock. Or due to physical problems with the MEMS
mirror such as ageing or other signs of wear. Therefore, we
designed a CodeIso and integrated this novel monitor into the
existing architecture. The CodeIso is essentially composed of
an Accumulation and Averaging Unit (AAU), a Comparison
and Classiﬁcation Unit (CCU) and a Decision and Execution
Unit (DEU). The AAU is responsible for accumulating the
absolute PLL error values over a speciﬁed number of Mirror
Half Periods. These accumulated absolute PLL error values
will afterwards be averaged and forwarded to the CCU. In the
CCU, the PLL error mean value obtained will be compared
with a PLL error mean value set by an authorised mechanic
or technician during the last maintenance in the repair shop.
Depending on the deviation of the obtained PLL error mean
value from the preset PLL error mean value, the measurement
is classiﬁed into a Degradation Level. The classiﬁed Degrada-
tion Level will then be stored as a histogram. This histogram
is subsequently forwarded to the DEU to be able to validate
the Overall Degradation Level of the LiDAR system. In the
DEU a validation of the Overall Degradation Level takes place.
According to the results of this validation, further action can
be taken. In any case, the System Safety Controller will be
informed of the Level of System Degradation Indicator (LSDI)
of the current Degradation Level of the LiDAR system. The
System Safety Controller is the interface between the LiDAR
system and the sensor fusion unit in the entire environmental
perception system. With this information the LiDAR system is
then degraded by the System Safety Controller in the sensor
fusion unit of the environment perception system when the
LSDI indicates a necessary degradation. Such Degradation
Levels can either change again during runtime or, under certain

circumstances, only be altered after the system has been in-
spected, repaired if necessary respectively replaced and ﬁnally
released. This monitor is used to observe the system and does
not take corrective action. The purpose of this procedure is to
ensure that any disturbances are detected and the environment
perception system can be alerted accordingly. The procedural
ﬂow is depicted in Figure 9. The monitoring procedure is
divided into the following steps:
1)
Checking for System Degradation
After startup the LiDAR system ﬁrst checks whether
the system is fully degraded or not. If the system
is fully degraded, the CodeIso is not enabled. The
CodeIso can only be re-enabled after the system has
been inspected, repaired respectively replaced and
released. Otherwise, the CodeIso is started after the
system startup and operates during the whole system
runtime until the system is degraded or the system is
shut down.
2)
Enable Continuous Disturbance Veriﬁcation
Safety Monitor
When the degradation check shows that the system
is not fully degraded and therefore not neglected
in the sensor fusion, the CodeIso is enabled. The
CodeIso is now active as long as there is no full
system degradation. The system is monitored during
operation by the CodeIso.
3)
PLL Error Accumulation
As soon as the CodeIso is active, the absolute PLL
error value accumulation starts. For each Mirror Half
Period, a PLL error is measured that occurs between
the actual ZC of the MEMS mirror and the ZC
reference signal. This PLL error is then used as an
absolute value to average the PLL error values over
a certain measuring period and is cached. Until the
desired number of PLL error values per Mirror Half
Period is reached, these absolute PLL error values are
constantly accumulated.
4)
Averaging Accumulated PLL Error
After the accumulation of the absolute PLL error val-
ues is complete, the PLL Error Mean Value (PEMV)
is formed.
PEMV = 1
n
n
X
i=1
|PEVi|
(1)
In Equation (1), the PEMV is calculated by reference
to the sum of the individual absolute PLL error values
and the quantity of PLL error values. PEVi represents
the PLL error value of measurement i. This PEMV is
then forwarded to the CCU to compare and classify
the state of the system.
5)
Compare and Classify PLL Error Mean Values
During maintenance, the system is inspected and a
mean value of the measured absolute PLL error val-
ues during proper operation is formed. This Mainte-
nance PLL Error Mean Value (MPEMV) is compared
with the previously calculated PEMV. Depending
on the deviation from the MPEMV, the PEMV is
classiﬁed into a Degradation Level.
6)
Creation of Histogram
The histogram is afterwards ﬁlled with the previ-
ously classiﬁed Degradation Levels. Depending on
the level of degradation, the entry in the histogram
is weighted. For example, for Degradation Level 0,
each Degradation Level 0 entry is increased by 1.
For Degradation Level 1 it is increased by 1.5 and
for Degradation Level 2 by 2. According to how
signiﬁcant a Degradation Level should be, you can
change the weighting. The histogram is ﬁlled up

with the Degradation Levels of the PEMVs until
the speciﬁed number of histogram entries is reached.
Once the histogram is ﬁlled, the validation of the
Overall Degradation Level is performed.
7)
Validation of Overall Degradation Level
The validation of the Overall Degradation Level is
done by evaluating the individual classes of the
Degradation Levels in the histogram. The class that
has the largest amount is selected as the Overal-
l Degradation Level. Depending on the resulting
Degradation Level, the further steps can be taken. In
principle it leads to one of the following actions:
a)
Degradation Level 0
In case the validation results in a Degra-
dation Level 0, then the system is consid-
ered reliable and will not be degraded. The
histogram is cleared and the Degradation
Level is cached and reported to the System
Safety Controller via the LSDI. Afterwards
the monitoring process restarts with accumu-
lation of absolute PLL error values.
b)
Degradation Level 1
If the monitoring process leads to a Degrada-
tion Level 1, then there is not necessarily a
system degradation. Until the 3rd time, the
system is treated as at Degradation Level
0. Therefore, the histogram is cleared and
the level of degradation is cached. But un-
like Degradation Level 0, the System Safety
Controller is not informed about a new level
of degradation. However, if it happens for
the 3rd time during system runtime that a
Degradation Level 1 results, the system will
be partially degraded. The System Safety
Controller will be informed via the LSDI
and gets a lower priority in the sensor fu-
sion of the environment perception system.
Afterwards, the histogram is cleared and the
Degradation Level is cached, just like before.
The monitoring process starts again.
c)
Degradation Level 2
Should a Degradation Level 2 occur during
the monitoring process, there are two possi-
bilities, similar to the Degradation Level 1.
For the ﬁrst two occurrences of Degradation
Level 2 after a performed maintenance the
system is partially degraded. Here, it is the
same as for the 3rd time of Degradation
Level 1. The systems priority in sensor fu-
sion is downgraded, until the next system
restart and the System Safety Controller is
informed via the LSDI. Then the histogram
is cleared again and the level of degradation
is cached. The monitoring process starts a-
gain. However, if there is a 3rd occurrence
of Degradation Level 2 since maintenance,
the system is completely degraded and the
System Safety Controller is informed via the
LSDI. The system remains degraded until the
next maintenance. The system degradation
can then only be removed by an authorized
technician or mechanic after the system has
been inspected and, if necessary, repaired
respectively broken components replaced.
This new monitoring procedure creates another possibility
for early detection and reaction to disturbances in MEMS-
based LiDAR systems. The system can then be degraded in
order to avoid transmitting any erroneous data to the envi-
ronment perception system. This procedure can help detection
of imminent MEMS mirror failures due to aging or MEMS
mirror fractures caused by massive shocks and to early initiate
required maintenance. Section IV discusses and explains the
results of the novel CodeIso approach.
IV.
RESULTS
In this section, we provide the measurement results and
analysis of our novel monitoring procedures, which have been
introduced in Section III.
A. Novel Safety-Critical Mirror Driver Monitor Evaluation
Figure 10 shows the start of the novel monitor procedure.
After 427 Mirror Half Periods, the frequency of the simulated
mirror is changed. The Angle Ok signal can be used as an
indicator for a frequency shift between mirror and driver,
because it indicates whether the angle setpoint is reached
or not. At the beginning of the frequency mismatch, this
indication is also clearly visible in the ZC measurement. The
red signal corresponds to the ZC reference signal of the MEMS
mirror Driver and the blue one to the ZCsim signal. After the
427th Mirror Half Period it is clearly visible that the reference
and the simulated ZC signal are no longer synchronous. The
exemplary course of the mirror is recorded at Mirror Angle.
The red curve indicates the course of the mirror at the same
frequency and the blue curve looks like the course when the
new frequency is set for the simulated mirror. Figure 11 shows
that the frequency of the mirror has been adjusted again and
that the angle setpoint has been reached again from the 1709th
Mirror Half Period onwards. Here the Angle Ok signal is
essential for detecting whether the angle setpoint has already
been reached again. The frequencies of mirror and Driver are
equalized before the 1709th Mirror Half Period. The exemplary
courses of the mirror overlap almost completely, reference and
simulated ZC signal also occur again almost simultaneously.

For our measurement, the control required 1282 Mirror Half
Periods to adjust the frequencies. That was approximately 220
ms for the frequency range from about 2300 Hz to about 2400
Hz. Depending on the frequency difference between mirror and
Driver, this control time can be extended or shortened. Finally,
the results of the frequency adaption duration are summarized

B. Continuous Disturbance Veriﬁcation Safety Monitor Eval-

To test the CodeIso, different scenarios were examined
and evaluated. The CodeIso accumulates PLL error values
of 100 Mirror Half Periods per test run. The ﬁrst recorded
measurement, which is shown in Figure 12, was recorded
without any inﬂuence. Here one can see that the PLL error
value is close to zero and the frequency remains constant. As
shown in Table II, the ﬁrst measurement results in an average
of the absolute PLL error values of 3.42. The classiﬁcation
is determined in advance. In our evaluation of the CodeIso,

we deﬁned the limits of the different classes exemplarily to
show how the division into the speciﬁed classes happens.
Degradation Level 0 is divided from 0 up to MPEV plus 10,
Degradation Level 1 from MPEV plus 10.01 to MPEV plus
50 and Degradation Level 2 from MPEV plus 50.01. Since a
reference measurement, which we consider as the maintenance
measurement, was calculated to be an average of the absolute
PLL error values of 3.38, it is clear that the measurement
in Figure 12 belongs to the Degradation Level 0 class. The
classiﬁcation of the different measurements during a CodeIso
run is also shown in Table II.

shock was injected, simulating a massive shift between MEMS
mirror frequency and MEMS Driver frequency. Besides the
large PLL error, the unstable frequency clearly shows that the
system has been heavily affected. If such a measurement result
is obtained, it is clear that it must be noted as Degradation
Level 2 in the histogram. As mentioned before, the absolute
PLL error value is compared with the MPEV. With 215.93
the PLL error mean value is clearly in the Degradation Level
2 class, because it exceeds MPEV plus 50.01. However, if a
majority of such results are obtained, it can be concluded that
there are either age-related problems with the MEMS mirror
or that the MEMS mirror has been sustainably damaged by
a previous massive shock. Furthermore, the 3rd measurement
is shown in Figure 14. Here you can see the effects of
the previous measurement with the injected massive shock.
The frequency is constant again, but the PLL error has not
yet settled. Due to the previously deﬁned limits, the 3rd
measurement with an absolute PLL error average of 24.23 is
slightly in the Degradation Level 1 class. After ten iterations,
the histogram shown in Figure 15 is ﬁlled with the classiﬁed
Degradation Levels from Table II. This histogram is now used
to validate the Overall Degradation Level. For this purpose, the
number of occurrences in the different classes is multiplied by
the respective, previously deﬁned factor. A single Degradation
Level 2 will not be decisive for the degradation. Depending on
Figure 16. Validation of the Overall Degradation Level by reference to the
completed histogram.
the selected factors, more or less of such Degradation Level 2
ratings will be needed to fully degrade the system. The class
that contains the highest value will be used as the Degradation
Level for the entire LiDAR system. In our case we chose
factors 1, 1.5 and 2 for Degradation Level 0, 1 and 2. Figure 16
shows the result for validation. With the highest class value of
6 marked in red, the LiDAR system is set to full degradation.
Since we injected a massive shock in three measurements and
therefore simulated a heavy damage, respective impairment of
the system, it is the result we expected. In case two classes
have the same value, the higher Degradation Level is always
taken.
V.
CONCLUSION
In our paper, we introduced two novel safety monitor
architectures for a Safety-Critical Mirror Driver. With the ﬁrst
monitor we suggest a new possibility to test the control of a
MEMS-based LiDAR system and to monitor the functionality
of the Driver during the test cycle. The diversity of system
monitor options is further increased with this new SCMDM,
along with BIST and other diagnostic variants, further reducing
the probability of malfunctions remaining undetected. With a
duration of around 220ms, this test run is also well under 1s.
Therefore, it is unproblematic to perform this procedure during
the start of the vehicle or at a vehicle stop in front of a trafﬁc
light. Even if the trafﬁc starts to move again, not even 1s passes
until the LiDAR system is operational again. Due to the speed
at which the vehicle starts to move (usually a slow start), it is
only a few centimetres at most that the vehicle does not receive
any information from the LiDAR. By further optimizing the
parameters, the time required for the test run can probably
be shortened considerably. Our intention was to show that in
principle it is possible to simulate the mirror and thus create a
further possibility for MEMS Driver monitoring by means of
the novel monitor. The second monitor we suggest, is a new
possibility to continuously check the system for disturbances in
the PLL control loop. The CodeIso is used during continuously
throughout system operation and is supposed to inform the
system of the different Degradation Levels. The absolute PLL
error mean values over a given measurement period are used
to obtain classiﬁed entries in a histogram. After the histogram
is ﬁlled with the given number of measurements an Overall
Degradation Level is determined. In case the MEMS mirror is
operated in a frequency range from about 2300 Hz to about
2400 Hz, a statement on the Overall Degradation Level can
be made after approximately 10 ms. The weight factors for
the Overall Degradation Level were determined exploratory
and can also be adapted to get an earlier system degradation
or later. Its intention was to design a monitor that detects
disturbances in the PLL early and alerts the environment
perception system accordingly. With the full degradation of
the LiDAR system by this monitor, maintenance of the system
becomes necessary. Furthermore, this monitoring procedure
extends the diversity of the safety monitors. Monitors as
presented here will be even more important in the future for
highly automated vehicles than they already are in safety-
critical vehicle components. The top priority is to ensure the
safety and reliability of the ADAS in the vehicles and also to
check whether this is the case.
