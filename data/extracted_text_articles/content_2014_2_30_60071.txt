Abstract—Whereas 
higher 
education 
flows 
into 
the 
international study environment, the development of  
e-Learning takes on higher significance. E-Learning is 
becoming a means to implement virtual student mobility. 
Virtual student mobility can be realized by giving join  
e-Learning courses. Join e-Learning courses are e-Learning 
courses that are delivered for students from different 
countries. New tendencies of e-Learning development put 
forward 
new 
demands 
to 
e-Learning 
systems. 
The 
application 
of 
e-Learning 
systems 
for 
giving 
joint  
e-Learning courses includes the support of multilingual 
user’s interfaces, the possibilities of the giving a course 
content in several languages, and the functions of the grades 
conversion into the grading scale of student’s institution. The 
article evaluates the application of e-Learning systems for 
giving joint e-Learning courses and presents a newly created 
model of the grades conversion from one grading scale to 
another. The article also describes the integration of a new 
created model into Moodle system.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The priorities of the improvement of the common 
European higher education environment within the 
upcoming decade are defined in the communiqué ‘The 
Bologna Process 2020 - The European Higher Education 
Area in the new decade’ [19]. Among them, we enumerate 
the growth of study accessibility for all social groups, 
orientation towards student’s needs and expectations, the 
encouragement of students and teachers’ mobility, the 
development of international honesty, and learning from 
the cradle to the grave. 
E-Learning is a means to implement the regulation of 
Bologna process. The researches have proved that e-
Learning 
makes 
studying 
more 
attractive, 
allows 
improving study quality not only in technological, but also 
in pedagogical terms. E-Learning is a means to implement 
the mobility of virtual students, to expand united study 
programs. According to Euler et al. [10], e-Learning is a 
tool that facilitates the servicing of a new market; it offers 
the potential to enhance the programme profile of a given 
university to include other services, as well as being used 
for the enhancement of university teaching and the 
implementation of internationalization in education. 
According to Banks [3], e-Learning is seen as part of 
globalization to build capacity in ‘borderless’ education 
and distance learning, thus improving the competitiveness 
and marketization of higher education and impact on 
international cooperation and student mobility.  
The changes in higher education environment put 
forward new demands to e-Learning systems. Whereas 
higher education is internationalized, e-Learning systems 
should correspond to new tendencies. They should be 
adapted to give joint e-Learning courses and should 
correspond to the needs of students from different 
countries. E-Learning systems should include the support 
of multilingual user’s interface, the possibilities of the 
giving a course content in several languages, and the 
functions for grade conversion into the grading scale of 
student’s institution. 
The purpose of the article is to review the application 
of e-Learning systems for the giving joint e-Learning 
courses, to present a new created model of the converting 
of grades from one grading scale to another, and to 
describe the integration of a newly created model into 
Moodle system [16]. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses 
related works. Section 3 analyses the application of  
e-Learning systems for the giving of joint e-Learning 
courses. Section 4 presents a new created model of the 
converting of grades from one grading scale to another. 
Section 5 describes the integration of a new created model 
into Moodle system. Finally, Section 6 presents our 
conclusions.  
II. RELATED WORKS 
The research interest in the internationalization of  
e-Learning systems constantly increasing. Englisch et al. 
[9] emphasizes that due to internalization in university 
study programs more and more multilingual study courses 
are released. Multilingual support is very important 
because of globalization [7]. To extend e-Learning systems 
on a huge number of suppliers and users, multilingual 
content is necessary [9]. Most of the current available e-
Learning systems have an individual implementation of 
multilingualism [9]. Some of them offer multilingualism 
only for system text, but not for the user content [9].  
Englisch et al. [9] presents a general approach for 
handling of multilingual content in e-Learning systems.

Denev et al. [7] analyses multilingual support for  
e-Learning systems and presents multilingual e-Learning 
solution. Hillier [13] analyses the problems of translation, 
presents the model for multilingual website.  
According to Chen [6], learners’ cultural perceptions 
and experiences influence their online collaboration and 
communication behavior. When learning communities 
transcend nations and cultures, this potential influence 
must be taken into considerations in the design of online 
courses for cross-cultural collaborative online learning [6]. 
Mirza et al. [15] emphasizes that the barriers associated 
with the cultural differences in learning environments 
become more and more important with the increasing 
globalization of education. According to Blanchard et al. 
[5], if the content in a global e-Learning activity is not 
adapted in function of the culture, there are risks that 
learners of different culture background consider the same 
concept in different manners.  
Chen [6] presents the design of a cross-cultural e-
learning 2.0 environment, which fosters a learning 
community 
and 
facilitates 
collaborative 
learning. 
Blanchard et al. [5] creates a new kind of system called 
Culturally AWAre System that is centred on Culturally 
Intelligent Agents, i.e. agents that are able to understand 
and adapt to cultural specificities of learners. Edmundson 
[8] presents the cultural adaptation process model as a 
preliminary guideline for adapting e-learning courses for 
other cultures. 
The performed analysis of literature has shown that 
scientists analyse the issues, relating to the application of 
e-learning systems to different cultural and language 
environments however the aspects of internalization of e-
learning systems, evaluating the differences between 
studies results assessment systems are not studied. 
III. THE APPLICATION OF E-LEARNING 
SYSTEMS FOR THE GIVING OF JOINT E-LEARNING 
COURSES 
Analyzing the application of e-Learning systems for 
the giving of joint e-Learning courses three open-code e-
Learning systems used in Lithuanian higher schools were 
assessed: Moodle, ATutor and Sakai. In 2010, the 
questioning of higher schools organized by LieDM 
coordination centre showed that Moodle system is used by 
18 higher schools, Sakai – by 2 higher schools, ATutor – 
by 1 higher school [18]. Moodle system is widely used in 
Lithuanian and world higher schools. Sakai system is 
ranked very high in the world; however in Lithuania, it is 
little used. The researches of Sakai implementation were 
started in Siauliai University. ATutor system is not popular 
among Lithuanian higher schools; however, it is applied in 
secondary schools of Lithuania. In 2006, on the ground of 
this system, the virtual learning environment of Schools’ 
improvement program was created. 
The assessment of e-Learning systems included the 
analysis of the documentation of the systems under 
consideration on the ground of the research results of 
various authors [1][2][11]. The application of e-Learning 
systems for giving joint e-Learning courses was analyzed 
according to different aspects: the support of multilingual 
user’s interface, the possibilities of giving the course 
content in several languages, and the functions of the 
grades conversion into the grading scale of student’s 
institution. The conducted research are summarized in

The conducted analysis showed that e-Learning 
systems under consideration can work in several language 
environments. Moodle user interface is translated to 112 
different foreign languages. ATutor supports 71 different 
foreign languages. Sakai supports 20 different foreign 
languages. Adapting user’s interface of the e-Learning 
system to different languages, menu items and all text 
variables that can be visible to user are translated. The 
translation is saved in the separate files that are 
incorporated in the e-Learning system structure. These 
files translate the e-Learning system interface, and not the 
course content. 
In Moodle system, users can choose the language of 
interface. User can choose the most appropriate language 
for him or her from language menu. However, this 
language choice influences only the interface of  
e-Learning system. 
Multiple language content can be created in Moodle 
system. The multi-language content filter in Moodle 
enables resources to be created in multiple languages. 
In e-Learning systems under consideration for the 
assessment of students’ study results it is possible to apply 
or 
create 
different 
study 
result 
grading 
scales 
corresponding to the needs of the institution. However, 
none of the systems under analysis has an integrated 
grades conversion function which enables the presentation 
of grades on the student’s study results grading scale. 
Summarizing the results of the conducted analysis, it is 
possible to state that the application of e-Learning systems 
for the giving joint e-Learning courses is not fully 
implemented. Although the typical feature of Moodle 
system is functional multilingual user’s interface and the 
possibilities 
of 
multilingual 
content 
creation 
are 
implemented, however because of the unresolved 
questions of the compatibility of study result grading 
scales, the giving of joint e-Learning courses remains a 
problematic issue. Thus, e-Learning systems should be 
improved. 
IV. GRADES CONVERSION MODEL 
The problem of grades conversion is solved in the 
works of various authors. In 1997, Haug [12] examined the 
differences of grading scales used in different countries 
and emphasized that assessment interpretation is was not 
more objective than an assessment process itself. The 
uncertainty of grades conversion is influenced both by the 
difference of used grading scales and by the different 
practice of the use of these grading scales. The conversion 
of grades into ECTS (European Credit Transfer and 
Accumulation System) grading scale received high interest.

Nunes et al. [17] described the method of assessment 
converting into ECTS grading scale emphasizing separate 
valid in Portugal converting cases. Warfvinge [20] 
provided the model of grades conversion into ECTS 
grading scale.  
For conversion of grades in e-Learning systems, two-
parameter grades conversion model was created. This 
model should be applied for conversion of both standard 
and criteria based grading scale grades. When converting 
the positive grades from one studies results grading scale 
to another, the model takes into consideration two 
parameters, i. e. the distribution of the accumulated control 
positive grade set data on the grading scale A and the 
distribution of the accumulated control positive grade set 
data on the grading scale B. After labeling the parameters 
by letters L, K, the attribution of the equivalent bj of 
positive grade ai on the grading scale A to the grading scale 
B can be defined as a two-parameter function (1).

The data of grading scales A and B are written as 
probability distributions (2). Since in some countries 
incremental grading scales are used, while decreasing 
scales are used in others, the marking of the scales is also 
different and a new variables, i. e., the assessment indexes 
i and j are introduced. The assessment indexes number the 
scale positive grades in the decreasing order and 
correspond to the characteristic of the distributions.

In case the probabilities of several grades are equal, the

In case the students are rated, the grades are sorted in 
the order of decreasing of the assessment value and the 
corresponding rating is given to each assessment. The 
number ski of the assessments, corresponding to the 
convertible grade ai is redistributed by applying formula 
(7). The assessment b1 corresponds to the si1 of the highest 
assessments ai, b2 – the si2 of the following assessments ai, 
etc.

E-Learning systems should correspond to the modern 
tendencies of e-Learning results assessment alteration. In 
order to implement the idea of learning without walls, to 
implement virtual student mobility it is necessary to 
integrate the grades conversion model into e-Learning 
systems. The results of students’ study should be given on 
the study result grading scale of their country, institution – 
only then the grades will provide comprehensive 
reversible information. Thus, continuing the experimental 
research the grades conversion module was created and 
integrated into e-Learning system.

V. INTEGRATION OF THE GRADES 
CONVERSION MODEL INTO E.LEARNING SYSTEM 
MOODLE 
In order to conduct an experimental research, the  
e-Learning system Moodle was chosen. Moodle system 
was chosen by various reasons: software license, 
reliability, functionality. The results of the conducted 
research showed that Moodle system, in comparison to 
other open-code e-Learning systems used in Lithuania, is 
most of all adapted to give joint e-Learning courses. 
The grades conversion model was integrated into the 
Moodle system by developing a separate Moodle system 
module. The grades conversion module is a plugin of the 
Moodle system, developed in observance of the rules for 
and methods of development of the Moodle system 
plugins and corresponding to the Moodle plugins 
technologies. In order to implement the module the PHP 
(Hypertext Pre-processor), HTML (Hyper text Markup 
Language), MySQL and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
technologies were used. The Moodle system integrated the 
grades conversion model by extending gradebook 
functions and adding a new gradebook report module  
Fig. 1.  
 
 
Figure 1. Grades conversion module integration into Moodle system components diagram. 
The created report module of the gradebook consists 
of the files intended for module reliability and 
performance, style, to describe module regulation, to 
renew the structure of database, to indicate access control. 
When integrating the grades conversion module 
database scheme into the overall structure of the Moodle 
database, the new database tables were developed and the 
already existing ones were updated. The logical scheme of 
the database of the grades conversion module is provided 
in Fig. 2.  
 
Figure 2. Logical database scheme of grades conversion module. 
The report module of the gradebook was created 
adhering to the general principles of the creation of 
Moodle modules. The main file of grades conversion 
module is index.php. First of all, this file reads 
configuration parameters, includes necessary libraries, 
fulfils the check of the conditions of access control, forms 
the report corresponding to the user’s access rights or 
displays error message.  
The reliability and performance of the report module 
of the gradebook was described creating new, renewing 
and using standard Moodle class methods. Created grades 
conversion method is executed each time after the 
recalculation of grades. At the initial stage of grades 
conversion, necessary grades conversion conditions are 
checked, i.e. it is established if a grading scale is attached 
to the course, if there are changeable elements of a course 
gradebook. If necessary conditions of grades conversion 
are satisfactory, the grades should be converted for the 
selected students. During the selection of students, it is 
checked whether a student got a grading scale which does 
not match a course grading scale, if a student belongs to a 
group whose students’ grades were recalculated. If the list 
of students meeting the defined conditions of grades 
conversion is empty, then grades conversion process is 
suspended. 
After the selection of students, it is checked if 
necessary grades conversion tables have been formed. If a 
grades’ conversion table corresponding to a course and 
student grades scales is not made, the method of the 
formation of this tables is executed. Only those grades of 
changeable elements of the gradebook are converted 
which belong to selected students. Making the tables of 
grades distribution according to ratings, rating process is 
executed at the group level. The conversion process of the 
grades of the gradebook is detailed in the grades 
conversion activity diagram given in Fig. 3.

Figure 3. Activity diagram of gradebook’s grades conversion. 
When a course teacher defines a course gradebook 
and establishes the formula of the calculation of the final 
grade, a student can keep a check on grades changes both 
on the study results grading scale of the institution giving 
studies, and on student’s study results grading scale. After 
the student opens the course gradebook, he/she sees the 
grades on two grading scales. The grades, recalculated to 
the studies results grading scale of the educational 
institution, 
represented 
by 
the 
learner 
provide 
comprehensive information to the learner. The student is 
able to realistically evaluate the achieved results.  
A picture given below presents the student’s 
gradebook report. This report shows a student his grades 
on the grading scale of the institution giving studies (field 
Grade) and also on this student’s grading scale (field 
Transfer grade). A picture given below shows gradebook 
report of student whose institution applies literal A–F 
study results grading scale (Figure 4.).  
 
Figure 4. Gradebook report of student. 
The 
grades 
conversion 
module 
extends 
the 
functionality of the Moodle system. It is flexibly 
integrated into the overall structure of the Moodle system. 
The supplementation of the gradebook with the grades 
conversion function is relevant when there is a need to 
give joint e-Learning courses to learners from different 
countries. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Users’ interfaces of the open code systems Moodle, 
ATutor, Sakai used in Lithuania are translated into 
different foreign languages. The users of Moodle system 
can easily change the language of user’s interface; this 
system has the possibilities of the creation of multilingual 
content. 
However, 
none 
of 
the 
systems 
under 
consideration has integrated grades conversion function 
which is important when giving joint e-Learning courses 
for students from different countries. 
Grades conversion model have been developed. The 
grades conversion model considers the accumulated 
grades distribution data on the convertible studies results 
grading scales and converts the grades by employing the 
principle of the most probable grades equivalent, taking 
into consideration the grades rating in the group of the 
analysed grades. 
The grades conversion algorithm is integrated into the 
Moodle system, by expanding the gradebook functions 
and developing a new Moodle system gradebook report 
module. The scheme of the grades conversion module 
database is integrated into the common structure of the 
Moodle database, the control of access to the grades 
conversion model is defined and the functionality of the 
module is described.  
Further we plan to extend grade conversion model 
including the impact of such factors as language barrier, 
cultural differences.
