Abstract—This paper gives an extended overview of chal-
lenges creating complex integrated information and computing
systems. It covers implementation, legal, and security issues
with these processes and how the overall complexity can be
reduced using collaboration frameworks with Distributed and
High Performance Computing resources in natural sciences
disciplines for building integrated public / commercial infor-
mation system components within the e-Society. Focus is on
using a collaboration framework for implementing computing
resources, interfaces for data and application interchange,
based on current developments regarding infonomics systems,
last years case studies within the long-term GEXI project, and
Active Source. A suitable framework base has been created
over the last years, being used for a number of scenarios in
research environments, using High End Computing resources.
Application of these methods for commercial service structures
affords the consideration of various legal, security, and trust
aspects. In collaboration with international partners from nat-
ural sciences, industry, economy, and education the framework
has been found the solution to overcome the legal cooperation
barrier. Established on this work, international cooperations
are currently built. In addition, this paper presents two major
implementation case studies in order to show the application
of the collaboration framework, one for environmental and
energy exploration information, computing, and resources
management and another for epidemology information systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Todays information system design, development, imple-
mentation, and usage are in many cases characterised by
dynamism and fast varying means, heterogeneous content,
access and information security in complex environments,
short-term ﬁnancing, and individual architectures. About
over a decade now, the amount of information available
as well as the computing power has been continuously
increasing, but there is no integrated information-computing
system actually really bringing these vast resources together.
Research on overcoming these shortcomings for interna-
tional collaboration management is going on for the last
years [1]. Over the last years a long-term project, Geo
Exploration and Information (GEXI) [2] for analysing case
studies, has examined chances to overcome the deﬁcits.
This paper presents the current results with a collaboration
framework that has been developed and successfully used as
a solution for various cases. It delivers the results collected
from a study taken on participating national and international
collaboration projects regarding the sections High Perfor-
mance Computing (HPC), Distributed Computing (DC) and
services, and natural sciences. There is a number of factors
limiting the vigors that are devoted on the development of
integrated systems. These are the problems with distribution
of valuable resources like High End Computing (HEC)
needed to be integrated on one hand and the legal diversities
as with automation, personalisation, security, and differences
in professional, national, and international context on the
other. As resulting from the developments of a suitable
framework for DC and HPC, this work provides the legal
complement for the technical and scientiﬁc base currently
used for various international collaborations, building infor-
mation, processing and decision making systems. Two case
studies are presented in order to discuss the different aspects
of “trust in computing” and “trust in information” emphasis.
II. MOTIVATION
Geoscientiﬁc information systems belong to the most
advanced information systems available today. A driving
force behind the development besides public interests is from
applied natural sciences, exploration and energy, resources,
and environmental management. Oil and gas, climatology,
aerospace and automotive industry for example depend on
privacy for their computations. Neither services nor security
in general will change the advised behaviour within the next
decade. It is uninviting to expect the driving force from
the resources engineering approach only. It is a common
misbelief that industry will use any distant foreign HEC re-
sources for economically interesting or critical calculations,
for computing or storage in context with their strategic data
or with production. The research projects of the last years
have shown that we need a legally integrated comprehensive

collaboration framework for complex modular design and
development [3] as well as new methods and algorithms on
the geoinformation side [4] regarding distributed resources
and secure communication.
This paper is organised as follows. Section three presents
preliminary work and cases studies. Sections four and ﬁve
describe legal frameworks, regulations and name the prob-
lems addressed. Section six describes the new collaboration
framework. Section seven explains the status of the imple-
mentation regarding the participating key player topics. Sec-
tion eight reports evaluation and consequences for primary
topics on technology and legal issues and the collaboration
portal. Section nine gives an extended presentation of se-
lected case studies, implemented following the collaboration
framework. The focus is on implementation, legal issues,
and security aspects faced by the resources, services, and
disciplines columns. Section ten shows the lessons learned
and Section eleven summarises the conclusion and outlook
on future work.
III. PRELIMINARY WORK AND CASE STUDIES
This discussion of legal issues is the result of the success-
ful work of the last years, in the disciplines of geosciences
application architecture [5] (Active Source), preparing an
interdisciplinary Grid-GIS house framework [6], project
case studies, and the adjunctive conﬁguration of various
HEC (HPC, Distributed, Grid, Cloud, and GPU Computing)
resources over the last three years [4]. Work is ongoing for
developments in cooperation with international industry and
economy partners [7], [3].
The analysis of these case studies showed that the coor-
dinated cooperations have a strong need to address the legal
and security base for handling critical data (e.g. business
relevant development and exploration data), computing and
geo-processing as well as components used.
At todays level of information integration, with the overall
complexity of information and decision making systems,
there is a neccessity for building ﬂexible and extendable
information systems for cognostic purposes that consider
aspects of security and economy in complex environments.
For future cooperations and implementations it is most
important to focus on legal issues regarding the frameworks.
IV. LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AND REGULATIONS
As in this context, there exists no collaboration develop-
ment framework, there is a number of partially interesting
international and national legal topic-frameworks (Table I)
for information systems, regarding content and structure.

Besides these frameworks there is a number of laws and
legal regulations regarding geo data in Germany: copyright
law (Urheberrechtsgesetz, UrhG), data security and privacy
law (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG), freedom of informa-
tion law (Informationsfreiheitsgesetz, IFG), law on the reuse
of information from public institutions (Gesetz ¨uber die
Weiterverwendung von Informationen ¨offentlicher Stellen,
Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz, IWG), environmen-
tal information law (Umweltinformationsgesetz, UIG), law
on accessing digital geo data (Gesetz ¨uber den Zugang
zu digitalen Geodaten, Geodatenzugangsgesetz, GeoZG).
These regulations do concern many aspects, contributors and
participants of a modern information system, content as well
as implementation, access, and usage.
V. PROBLEMS ADDRESSED
Currently there exist traditional information structures,
old non-intelligent applications and data formats, but the
data-barrier at various media is still omnipresent. Although
the earliest of the fundaments of the named academic
frameworks are dating back into the year 1998 there is still
no information system available integrating the technical
and legal diversities. But all of these frameworks can be
seen complementary to comprehensive information system
frameworks for geo-computing and geo-processing. What
we target to, is legally conform modular applications and
data formats for integrability of all resources.
A complementary effort is necessary for integrating in-
dustry, economy, and legal expertise into this process of
creating a next generation information system framework
at an international level. Further industrial and economic
impulses originate from exploration, geosciences, energy-
sciences, climatology, and education for handling data on
resources management, observation, environment, biodiver-
sity, weather, medicine.
In these disciplines many applications do need an inte-
gration of information systems with simulation and virtual
reality. Not only that oil and gas industry, insurances, town
planning, tourism industry and many others do have strong
needs to be integrated into this processes. The integration

will provide chances for new insights into complexity of
the environmental systems. Therefore, primary goals are
implementations based on the collaboration framework:
• integration of academia, industry, economy, law,
• modularisation of system components,
• structuring of data and information,
• integration of HEC and storage resources,
• legally conform georeferencing of data and objects,
• licensing (e.g. topography, remote sensing),
• personalisation of information and services.
VI. COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK
Illustrating the directions of integrating and co-developing
large collaboration target frameworks and applications for
service-oriented DC and HPC, Figure 1 shows the columns
of the infonomics system and Figure 2 shows the dependen-
cies of market and services (green colour, shingle and cross
pattern), computing services (red colour, brick pattern), HPC
and distributed resources (blue colour, gravelly pattern), and
resources to be provisioned or developed (gold colour). The
proposed Computing Industry Alliance ([4], Leadership in
Research consortium) will be a suitable umbrella organisa-
tion for distributed and HPC and geo-exploration sciences.
The framework described is an example currently building
the base for creating efﬁcient interdisciplinary industry re-
search cooperations for implementing the next generation
of dynamical applications on distributed and HPC resources
based on the “Grid-GIS house” [6]. Interests to force this
development exist, not only in the Gulf of M´exico region
but as well in Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Resulting from the GEXI project [2] started in the
year 1996 as a public and private support network, the
components and mechanisms have been topic of several
information science, HPC, Grid Computing cooperations and
European activities of the last years [16].
Three key player collaboration sections from HPC and
Distributed and Grid Computing, from services and technical
development, and from geosciences and exploration are
currently building the next generation of information and
computation system.
With support of international partners from geosciences,
high end computing industry, economy, and education an
extended Grid-GIS house [6] for the geosciences and explo-
ration disciplines has been created this year [3] and legal
aspects are currently discussed for further cooperation.
VII. STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION
A. Infonomics system and interactions
The entirety of the essential columns of the framework,
geosciences and energy-sciences, Distributed Computing
and services, and HPC forms a well balanced infonomics
system. The necessary interactions for the information and
computing systems build the interfaces for the columns of
the infonomics system (Figure 1). For integration into the

market, suitable services (e.g. Software as a Service, SaaS)
will be provisioned as geosciences and e-Energy seek a
complex information and decision making environment.
Efﬁciency and effectivity is important from various perspec-
tives: Fast networks (broadband, InﬁniBand) are needed for
distributed resources and HPC, interfaces for services and
scientiﬁc applications, complementary to the simple OGC
Web Processing Service (WPS), as well as parallelisation
for geoscience algorithms is currently expedited with the
collaboration framework in order to be employed on HPC
resources.
Supplies for the natural sciences disciplines will be done
with updates of data and algorithms and the computing
resources do need a continuous operating as research and de-
velopment are essential for interaction between the columns
of the system. As the market does not only want to “trade”
electronic goods, a suitable coupling with the information
systems is necessary for physical identity tracking and
monitoring, e.g., RFID for container cargo and Intelligent
Transport Systems (ITS). Legal issues regarding all of these
topics are omnipresent, for the columns and for the market.
B. Legal focus points
The entirety of these aspects describes a next generation
“Information and Decision Making Environment” for the
future internet, containing electronic and physical operations
like information system components and logistics and track-
ing support for objects and goods.
Figure 3 shows the important legal focus points and
dependency relations.

Legal focus points with GEXI.
As some related issues (yellow colour) strongly overlap
with different columns they should be worked on in a
collaboration development between disciplines, providers,
and computing industry.
There have been implementations regarding a number
of issues within case studies and future topics have been
identiﬁed. Table II shows a compact overview of the imple-
mentation focus points and the current directions ( mostly
done, « future tasks within project). As the table points
out, a number of issues is already done others will have
to be worked on, for integrating new features needed for
the next stage for an upheaval in system complexity. Some
other issues will have to remain undone work with regard
to standardisation as they afford an individual conﬁguration,
parametrisation, and optimisation, like access to HPC re-
sources or because there are suitable solutions like MPI for
parallelisation.
The number of legally safe application scenarios in focus,
working with these resources and technologies should be
increased by the participating academia and industry. These
scenarios include commonly shared interactive distributed
resources usage for computation and information storage
and processing, distributed among international partners with
different legal conception and regulations regarding privacy
and anonymity.
There is a number of selected topics, being in the focus of
current implementation and usability studies. The following
passages show some topics important for the interdisci-
plinary context of the case studies.
C. Security
Physical and logical aspects and features, hazards and
threats have been considered within the last years.

• Restrictions on hardware usage.
• Restrictions on access.
• Trust in information.
• Trust in computing.
• Trusted scripting.
• Inter Process Communication (IPC).
• Active Source methods.
• Accounting security, bidirectional and undisputable.
• Sandboxing and policies.
In the implementation case studies these aspects had to be
handled in order to implement real-life systems. This will
be discussed in some of the next sections.
D. Sandboxing policies
Various sandboxing mechanisms have been experimented
with. The Tcl architecture supports very ﬂexible features
for sandboxing and policy implementation. With dynamical
client-server applications the Tcl plugin supports Tcl/Tk
applets, so called Tclets. The Tcl plugin implements the
standard Safe-Tcl subset and deﬁning new policies. For the
Safe-Tcl interpreter various commands can be removed from
the Tcl interpreter by conﬁguration, used to run Tcl applets.
A limited version of Tk has been added. This sandboxing can
be used in the most ﬂexible way with high level languages
and other scripting languages. With the case studies, control
for the following commands has been found most important,
in order to gain trustable modules.
• exec (execute programs),
• load (dynamically load shared libraries implementing
C or Tcl language commands),
• open (open a ﬁle, restricted open-read-only version
available),
• send (send Tcl commands to other applications),
• cd (change directory),
• socket (open a network socket),
• source (load script ﬁles),
• exit (terminate a process).
Tk images cannot be created or read from ﬁles. Image create
photo commands take strings of base64 encoded images
instead. Further commands are handled with the Safe-Tcl.
• wm (window manager control),
• toplevel (create toplevel windows),
• menu (display a menu),
• tk (set and query Tk application names),
• tkwait (block on events),
• bell (ring terminal bell),
• clipboard (access the clipboard selection),
• glob (match ﬁle names in a directory),
• grab (grab the cursor),
• pwd (query present working directory).
These and additional functions and commands can be con-
ﬁgured for the executing sandbox environments.
E. Accounting implementation
An integrated accounting and billing approach has been
developed in the last years. The SweGrid Accounting System
(SGAS) [17] has been considered most useful for Distributed
and High Performance Computing. It supports scalable
resources and capacity allocation [18], [19], decentralised
concepts for fairshare scheduling [20], OGSA-based bank
service [21], distributed usage logging [22], and support
for federated cloud infrastructures [23]. The integrated ac-
counting and billing approach supports market-ready secure,
transparent, and ﬂexible resources management.
The following section evaluates the current status and
describes the lessons learned for implementation, technical
and legal consequences.
VIII. EVALUATION AND LEGAL CONSEQUENCES
Some aspects like loosely coupled (with Grid, Cluster, and
HPC) as well as MPI parallelisation for Massively Parallel
Processing (MPP) and Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP)
have been successfully implemented and used for various
purposes (e.g. in the projects Condor-network, ZIVGrid,
ZIVHPC, ZIVSMP, HLRN) [6], [4]. It has been proven
viable to use a collaborative implementation strategy to
integrate individual solutions for making long-term invest-
ments sustainable. International work is currently done for
parallelising application-triggered algorithms for interactive
95

use on huge HPC resources. Focus is on management, explo-
ration, and environmental applications for geosciences, en-
ergy management, and information sciences. Invited industry
partners are currently implementing parallelised application
suites. From the legal point of view, protocols and exclusive
commercial use of resources have to be implemented for
reliable use of HEC resources.
For accounting, pricing, and billing individual solutions
mostly based on ﬂatrates have been used (DC and HPC).
Future focus will concentrate on compound units and mod-
ular solutions. An integrated distributed accounting and
billing solution considering national and international legal
regulations must be implemented for infonomics purposes.
Up to now various methods and technologies have been
implemented for use with the new features. There will
have to be strong standardisation efforts for secure and
ergonomic access, quality management, and new types of
content speciﬁcation, allowing ﬂexible separation of data,
information, and functional parts. Considering legal aspects
is crucial for the design of these speciﬁcations in order to
create a suitable structure based on the legal frameworks.
Physical aspects for infonomics systems have often been
neglected in the past. Data sizes have been sized small and
only transferred for small distances. Prominent topics are
broadband for public use with data transfer and physical
identiﬁcation for real world tracking. These will be needed
for transfer of large amounts of computation data in national
and international context, for monitoring and logistics in
exploration and environmental management. Projects are
experimenting with large data sizes (> 100 TeraBytes) on
international data transfer for use with applications. These
are expected to be industry topics in the near future. Broad-
band networks will allow to transfer larger amounts of data
using secure channels on external networks.
The implemented data handling is suitable for data types
and applications currently used. The case studies of the last
years have shown that there is need for standardised cognos-
tic categories. Large size applications with composite data
types do need data-categorisation for generalising, integra-
tion, automation, georeferencing, and search engine facilities
in order to minimising conﬂicts with legal regulations.
Operation and updates will be interesting for providers
and industry. Legal regulations demand a transparent least-
invasive access and update concept for complex information
and computing systems.
A. Primary topics on technology and legal issues
A number of primary topics resulting from the interactions
within the columns of the infonomics system exist from
user point of view: security, safety/privacy, consistency,
international standards, legal issues, and primary associ-
ated laws and regulations, identiﬁed with the GEXI case
studies (Table III). This table shows some of the most
important components, that are not worked out ultimatively

like storage consistency can be considered done for mid-
term, as there are means of creating suitable solutions.
Other topics like safety within the productive employment
of geosciences, exploration, medicine, and e-Science can be
considered speciﬁc to their discipline. There are some topics
most important as they concern several of the topics and dis-
ciplines: facilitate market use of HEC resources and creating
collaboration frameworks for national to international use.
B. Collaboration portal
The GEXI case studies have shown the additional need
for a single access point, a frontend portal. Resulting from
the integration of the consolidated academic and industrial
interests, Figure 4 shows a sketch of the prototype GEXI
portal addressing the geo-exploration-energy market.

platform for the columns of the infonomics system in order
to prove the conjoint economic and legal feasibility. Clients
for disseminating the provisioned services, information and
distributed resources will be integrated with this portal. Such
a portal is capable of providing a solution to technical-legal
diversities as with access, services accounting, licensing,
QoD, automation, personalisation, security, and internation-
alisation, handling focus points within and between the col-
laborating columns at the backend and reducing complexity.
IX. IMPLEMENTATION CASE STUDIES
A. Application scenarios
The information and computing system components make
use of various technologies, IPC, sandboxing, embedded
applications, browser plugins, remote execution, network
protocols, computing interfaces as well as public and sen-
sible data. Figure 5 shows some of the basic application
scenarios.
There exists a number of scenarios showing how “trust
in computation” and “trust in information” can more easily
be achieved by reducing complexity for the partners in
otherwise very complex systems. The following sections
give an extended presentation of selected case studies,
implemented following the collaboration framework. The
focus is on implementation, legal issues, and security aspects
faced by the resources, services, and disciplines columns.
The following collaboration matrices show what topics the
columns Resources (R), Services (S), and Disciplines (D)
had to take care while realising the components regarding
• implementation (i),
• legal issues (l),
• security (s).
The column partners have been responsible for the topics
respecting the work packages designed respecting the col-
laboration framework.
B. Environmental information and computing
Various information resources are available for environ-
mental and energy exploration. Mostly all of the imple-
mentations making use of these resources are standalone
systems. Computing resources are not considered part of
the implementations at all.
For the future, integrating information, monitoring, man-
agement, and computing systems is necessary for effectively
and efﬁciently using these resources. As an example, the
information on private, governmental, and industrial land
use, national parks information, and energy and mineral
resources exploration is very complex. The parameters of
wind energy and solar energy are highly dynamical. Cal-
culation of weather impacts, construction and simulation of
new facilities offshore and onshore leads to new demands
on information and computing.
The case study showed that “trust in computation”, re-
liability and suitability of information, QoD, and security
of critical investments are most important for the academic
and industrial partners. As a result, for this scenario it has
been regarded necessary for the services to implement and
conﬁgure a complex combination of the following features:
• dedicated networks,
• ﬁrewalls, access lists, routing,
• sandboxes,
• trusted scripting,
• shared and non-shared use,
• queue limits,
• demilitarised zone,
• access control and keys,
• resources monitoring and accounting,
• local auditing, communication packet ﬁltering, security
management,
• job logging,
• encrypted data transfer and communication,
• services monitoring,
• on-site support and management.
Table IV gives a summarising excerpt of the collaboration
matrix, showing columns (Resources, Services, Disciplines),
topics (implementation, legal issues, security), the location
where the activity is concentrating on, and the focus topics
with their priority (highest priority is marked ‘!!!’).
As the table shows, emphasised priority with this case is
on computational aspects. No individual client applications
have been regarded necessary for the users with this case
study. The standard client is a Secure Shell client accessing
resources and implementing individual automation facilities
using access key pairs and batch system services. User
groups will develop many of the algorithms and tools needed
for processing. Public keys are not the primary means
for authentication with this scenario. Data encryption is
triggered by users. Decision ﬂow and overall priority is on
the users side.
Security and reliability concentrates on
computation and shared resources usage. Legal aspects are
handled on disciplines/users side. The collaboration matrix
shows that both the disciplines and services have had to
concentrate on the legal topic-framework implementation as
the services layer had to be staffed with privileged users as
well as operated and managed by services groups.
With assignment of distributed resources, legal and se-
curity aspects of information security and access require
transparent handling on services side. The Active Source
concept has been used for the implementation, based on
a modular server-client and services interfaces architec-
ture. Figure 6 shows a screenshot from the environmental
application case study, showing an Active Map of the
National Parks information system and some distributed
online information [24], [25]. The implementation targets
on environment-geosciences information and energy explo-
ration based on High Performance Computing (HPC) and
Distributed Computing (DC) services.
For the current collaboration, [26] resources management

for geosciences, energy sciences, and mobility is based
on the collaboration framework. A couple of aspects of
future Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are most
relevant for supporting integrated HEC and Information
Systems in industrial applications in this scenario:
• combining distributed and parallel techniques,
• transaction processing,
• highly parallel communications,
• loosely parallel communications of highly parallel ap-
plications,
• industrial systems,
• expanding scalability,
• improving the number of compute nodes for industry
ﬁelds of application, currently less than 100 compute
nodes,
• open up access to scientiﬁc scenarios with currently up
to over 500 compute nodes,
• preparing
new
solutions
for
complex
industrial
information-computing systems.
These are objects for further implementation on the re-
sources and services columns. The implementations for
global monitoring software and expanding the physical dis-
tribution for PSI strongly depend on their availability.
The case study further showed that “trust in computing”
and reliability are most important for the academic and
industrial partners. It has been possible to transparently
separate nearly all of the implementation aspects for the
three columns. The most prominent conjoint implementation
issues having to be worked on for the future is national
laws and regulations as far as there is no general solution
for securing critical data, and computation with distributed
usage cannot be supported by signing some kind of black-
box “computation objects”.
C. Epidemology information and computing
Interdisciplinary research in the ecology and epidemology
of vector-borne diseases produces huge amounts of data
regarding to biological and epidemological processes [27],
[28].
In epidemology a vector is an insect or any living
carrier that transmits an infectious agent. Examples are
hematophagous arthropod vectors such as mosquitos, ticks
and ﬂies which are responsible for transmitting protozoa,
bacteria, and viruses between vertebrate hosts, causing dis-
eases as Malaria, Lyme disease, and Sandﬂy Fever. Exam-
ples for processes are disease prevalence, abundance, and
distribution of living organisms.
These parameters are highly dynamical and are inﬂuenced
in time and space by a number of biotic (e.g. vegetation) and
abiotic (e.g. temperature and humidity) factors.

Figure 6.
Environmental application case study showing a distributed multi-discipline Active Source implementation.
There are three main types of objects: epidemological
objects, environmental objects, and sociocultural objects.
The following listing showing the simpliﬁed example matrix.
• epidemological: disease case numbers, vector distribu-
tion, number of vectors with pathogen,
• environmental:
landscape
structure,
meteorological
conditions, vegetation coverage, micro climate change,
• sociocultural: interchange of organisms by human travel
and commerce.
The case study showed that using security enhanced,
PKI/CA and PKC [29] based integrated Information and
Computing System components for scientiﬁc application
including industry participation has been regarded most
suitable. By these means evaluation of data, generating
various views, querying distributed information and visually
summarising information by calculating multi-dimensional
views varying in time and spatial representation can be sup-
ported in a secure and ﬂexible way. For locally distributed
information spatial information processing algorithms can
be employed. Partners from several disciplines will be
able to evaluate and analyse this data, e.g., human health
epidemologists, public health authorities, and physicians.
A well balanced infonomics system will allow for the
input, storage, data manipulation, analysis, and visual pre-
sentation of georeferenced data and is particulary suitable
for identifying local clusters of diseases, and for analysing
spatial relationships between diseases and risk factors.

are necessary for authors and users with this case study.
The user groups will not develop services on their own,
neither algorithms nor tools needed for processing. The
centre of the information system is the PKI/CA and PMI/AA
infrastructure. Processing uses the signed objects within
the services layer, only accessible via dedicated service
interfaces.
Security therefore concentrates on information and more
or less computation. The physical shared resources usage
can be critical due to the storage/scheduling location being
currently not predictable while being effective. The services
column is responsible for the system and client security.
Legal aspects are handled on disciplines side. The col-
laboration matrix shows that the disciplines column has to
concentrate on the legal topic-framework implementation.
With this scenario “trust in information” is twofold,
regarding the content information domain and the utilisation
information domain. It has been possible to transparently
separate nearly all of the implementation aspects for the
three columns.
The case study showed that for the application within
the integrated information and computing system the three

main types of objects need role-based data access for users
and clients. Objects have to be signed with digital signature
and timestamps of the originating authors and manipulation.
For real life scenarios network transfer encryption has to
be used. Due to a distributed storage environment host-side
encryption has been regarded necessary.
Figure 7 shows the workpackage layers view. As well
as in other disciplines, in epidemiology sciences on the one
hand there is a strong need to assure accurate data objects all
over the life-cycle of objects, thus for content guaranteeing
“trust in information”. On the other hand a suitable access
control infrastructure has to be established.
Strong authentication and authorisation by means of cryp-
tographic techniques speciﬁed as Public Key Certiﬁcates
(PKC) and Attribute Certiﬁcates (AC) in Public Key In-
frastructure (PKI) and Privilege Management Infrastructure
(PMI) environments [30] provides a framework for adressing
important security considerations of authentication, conﬁ-
dentiality, authorisation, and integrity (PKI) and allows for
particularly controlled data access (PMI). In this regard the
authority (CA) signs the public user keys in order to main-
tain the integrity of the public key, expiration information

and other important information contained within the user
certiﬁcates. Attribute Authority (AA) is the authority which
assigns attributes (permissions and privileges) by signing
the attribute certiﬁcate. Digital signatures are used in both
PKI and PMI as the mechanism which binds the issueing
certiﬁcation authority to the certiﬁcate. CA and AA are
separate authorities and should be established independently.
A sophisticated trust management system using X.509
Attribute Certiﬁcates [31] can be used to store the user roles,
based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) [32].
In case of multidisciplinary working and development
groups (Figure 7), intending epidemiological analysis of
infectious diseases, the procedure has been used as follows.
For an operation example with the case study this means:
• Disciplines layer: The author of a data object, the orig-
inator, e.g. co-worker of a human health organisation,
signs the created object, e.g. disease case numbers, with
the private key of the author and according timestamps.
• Services layer: The object is processed by the appli-
cation services.
• Resources layer: The processed object is stored to the
distributed storage.
• Disciplines layer: An user, e.g. a member of a research
team at an university, requests an object.
• Services layer: The user is authenticating at the au-
thentication service via AC/RBAC, the signature of the
corresponding author is validated. The authentication
service requests the object or service operation.
• Resources layer: The object is collected from the
distributed resources.
• Services layer: The object is calculated, accounted, and
provisioned via services for the user client.
X. LESSONS LEARNED
The environmental case has been found more heteroge-
neous than the epidemological example. This is the result
of the fact that in these disciplines many interest groups are
dealing with algorithms, simulations and spatial planning
for over the last decades. These disciplines will be able to
develop some own services components and make broader
use of sophisticated High End Computing resources. It has
been more transparent to deﬁne interfaces for discussing
and integrating legal frameworks and regulations into the
multi-disciplinary implementation process. Nevertheless for
the majority of use cases, smaller scenarios can be seen
where strict separation of disciplinary work, services and
development, and operation of resources will be lived.
This leads to the conclusion that in the future of integrated
information and computing systems we will need to create
means of securely submitting modular application compo-
nents into the services pipeline.
A collaboration framework for development and operation
in combination with and integrated information and com-
puting systems handling these features should be able to
address many of the heterogeneous conditions regarding im-
plementation, legal issues, and security existing in national
as well as international context. It will support stearing of
data, information, and application workﬂows being conform
with legal regulations and data security standards as well as
obeying policies.
XI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Developing international cooperations within the ﬁelds of
geosciences, exploration, and computing, based on an inter-
disciplinary collaboration framework is regarded a perfect
solution for all partners in the GEXI study for the different
case study scenarios, in order to modularise information sys-
tem development and reduce complexity. Technology suit-
able for solving open problems with implementation, legal
environment or trust is still in the genesis. For instance with
trust and encryption regarding Distributed Computing and
shared resources, full homomorphic encryption techniques
are desirably. Currently basic algorithms are available.
The modular integration of services and disciplines within
a collaboration framework has proven best results to be ﬂex-
ible and efﬁcient for large international projects with various
legal characteristics as separating technical and legal work
packages. With this, the future allocation of responsibilities
and integration of specialist frameworks has become a more
transparent process.

The ongoing work is oriented towards the consequences
resulting from the evaluation. The legal aspects for these
topics will attend the next steps in order to elaborate the
framework for use with a collaboration portal with support
from legal working groups.
At this point it is essential for complex implementations
to integrate the national legal regulations (in Germany e.g.
IFG, GeoZG, IWG) with securely managing content and
workﬂows into the international context as well as to reﬁne
the interactions within the collaborating sections:
1) For legal issues with geosciences and exploration, the
aspects of data contents, cognostics, data combination
and automation (georeferencing) and parallelisation
for HPC and shared resource usage are in the focus.
Integration with the national and international legal
frameworks (e.g. GDI-DE, INSPIRE, GSDI) will have
to be forced in order to accomplish a base for future
information and decision making systems for commer-
cial and educational purposes.
2) Regarding the Distributed Computing and services
column, desktop user interfaces, services and security,
networking, and undisputable distributed accounting
have been set top on the working list.
3) With High Performance Computing and resources
standardisation and a secure networking model with
PKI, privacy, and encryption support for future HEC
architectures development is priority.
Further on with implementation and legal issues, the
security aspect are on the rise for any complex system.
Even though PKI technology offers means to attest, iden-
tify, manage the exchange of encryption keys an secure
transmission between parties, there has not been broad-
based adoption of PKI technology by public and private
organisation. After all, a signiﬁcant number of countries
recognise digital signatures as legally binding. In case of
security enhanced integrated information and computing
system components object signing provides a robust solution
to facilitate “trust in information” and to overall support
“trust in computing”. In order to put this implementation
into international public practice there is a need for future
PKI development and deployment offering a global public
key cryptosystem for the Future Internet.
Preliminary work has created a common base for an eth-
ical understanding of cross-disciplinary use of data. Various
trust situations, important for services providers on the one
hand as well as for disciplines on the other hand could be
described, handled, and implemented with the separation of
work packages. This work showed that it is possible to bring
complex information and computing systems to life, being
able to create interfaces that can also be interfaces between
the logical columns and interest groups.
