INTRODUCTION
Visible
Light
Communication
(VLC)
holds
special
importance when compared to existing forms of wireless
communications [1]. Only Light-Emitting Diodes (LED)
lamps can be used for the transmission of visible light [2].
VLC seems to be appropriate for providing wireless data
exchange for automotive applications in the context in
which the LED lighting began to be widespread in
transportation, being integrated in traffic infrastructures
(street lighting and traffic signals) and in the vehicle lighting
systems.
Compared
to
Radio
Frequency
based
communications, VLC offers robustness against jamming
attacks, a smaller interference domain, and a large license-
free spectrum [3].
Vehicular
Communication
Systems
are
a
type
of
network in which vehicles and roadside units are the
communicating
nodes,
providing
each
other
with
information, such as safety warnings and traffic information
[4][5]. Communication between fixed locations and vehicles
(infrastructure-to-vehicle, I2V) between vehicles (vehicle-
to-vehicle, V2V), and between vehicles and fixed locations
(vehicle-to-infrastructure,
V2I)
is
essential
to
transfer
information in real time. The I2V applications focus on
utilizing the trafﬁc related infrastructure, such as trafﬁc 
lights or streetlights, to communicate useful information.
Hence, VLC can be realized as a secondary application in
LED arrays that are placed for lighting [6].
A problematic in vehicular VLC is the design of a proper
sensor. In the past, we have developed a receiver based on
amorphous SiC technology that enhances the transmission
capacity of the optical communications in the visible range
and allows reaching outdoor high speed communication.
The core of the device is a tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin
light controlled filter. When different visible signals are
encoded in the same transmission path [ 7 ], the device
multiplexes
the
different
optical
channels,
performs
different filtering processes (amplification, switching, and
wavelength conversion) and decodes the encoded signals,
recovering the transmitted information [8].
In this paper, a traffic scenario for a light controlled
crossroad is proposed, along with the transmitter to receiver
setup. The paper is organized as follows. After the
introduction (Section I), in Section II, the performance of a
cooperative
driving
system
is
analyzed.

Section III, streams of messages containing the physical
address ID of the emitters are used, transmitting a codeword
that is received and decoded by the SiC pin/pin devices. As
a
Proof
of
Concept
(PoC),
a
traffic
scenario
with
bidirectional
cooperative
communication
between
the
infrastructures and the vehicles is presented and tested in
Section IV. Finally, in Section V, conclusions are addressed.
The proposed vehicular communication system involves
wireless
communication,
smart
sensoring
and
optical
sources network, building up a transdisciplinary approach
framed in cyber-physical systems.
II.
VEHICULAR COMMUNICATION
A.
Traffic Scenario
A I2V2V2I2V communication link in a light traffic
controlled crossroad was simulated. The illustration of the
proposed scenario is displayed in Figure 1a. Using the I2V
communication, each street lamp (transmitter) sends a
message, which is received and processed by a SiC receiver,
located at the vehicle’s rooftop. Using the headlights as
transmitters, the information is resent to a leader vehicle
(V2V) or a “request” message to go forward is sent directly
to
a
crossroad
receiver
(V2I),
at
the
traffic
light,
interconnected to a local manager that feeds one or more
signal heads. For crossroad coordination, a local controller
emitter, sends a “response” message to
the vehicles
approaching the intersection.
To build the vehicular I2V communication system, it is
proposed a simplified cluster of unit square cells in an
orthogonal topology that fill all the service area. We have
assumed that the crossroad is located in the interception of
line 2 with column 3 of the network, and the emitters at the
nodes along the roadside. Two traffic flows are considered,
one in the horizontal direction (W: West) with two vehicles
approaching the crossroad (Vehicle 1) and the other
(Vehicle 3) with a third vehicle (Vehicle 2) oncoming on the
vertical
direction
(S:
South).
The
lighting
plan
and
generated joint footprints are illustrated in Figure 1b. The
luminaries, placed at the nodes of the network, are based on
commercially available white polychromatic LEDs made of
Violet (V: 400 nm) and polychromatic Red, Green and Blue
(RGB) LEDs. while the others provide constant current
Only one chip of each LED is modulated for data
transmission, the Red (R: 626 nm), the Green (G: 530 nm)
or the Blue (B: 470 nm) while the others provided constant
current for white illumination. Each transmitter, X i,j, carries
its own colour, X, (RGBV), as well as its horizontal and
vertical ID position in the surrounding network (i,j) and
sends a message that includes the synchronism, its physical
ID and the traffic information. The geometric scenario used
for calculation uses a smaller size square grid (2 cm), to
improve its practicality. To receive the information from
several transmitters, the receiver has to be positioned where
the circles from each transmitter overlap, producing, at the
receiver,
a
Multiplex
(MUX)
signal
that,
after
demultiplexing, acts twofold as a positioning system and a
data
transmitter.
The
nine
possible
allowed
overlaps
(footprint regions) are pointed out in Figure 1b.

Each LED transmits its own data depending on the area
it locates. The device receives different signals, identifies
the footprint, finds its centroid and stores it as the reference
point [9]. To build the V2V system between a leader vehicle
and a follower, the follower sends the message that is
received by the leader and can be retransmitted to the next
car [10][11] or to the infrastructure. The leader vehicle
infers the driving distance and the relative speed between
27

both [12]. Therefore, each vehicle receives two different
messages: one transmitted by the streetlight (I2V) and one
coming from the follower vehicle (V2V), and a comparison
can be performed.
For the manager’s intersection crossing coordination,
the
connected
vehicle
and
the
intersection
manager
exchange
information
through
two
specific
types
of
messages, “request” (V2I) and “response” (I2V). Two
receivers are located at the same traffic light, facing the
crossroads.
When
one
head
vehicle
enters
in
the
infrastructure´s capture range of one of the receivers, a
request
message
is
received
and
decoded
by
the
corresponding receiver interconnected to the intersection
manager (local controller of the traffic light). Each driver
approaching the intersection area from S, W (or both) sends
an approach “request”. Those messages contain the assigned
ID positions, speeds, and flow (W, S) direction of the
vehicles. So, the “request” contains all the information that
is necessary for a vehicle’s space-time reservation for its
intersection crossing. The intersection manager uses the
“request” information to convert a it in a sequence of timed
rectangular spaces that each vehicle needs to occupy in the
intersection. Using a white LED, the intersection manager’s
acknowledgment is sent to an in-car application of the head
vehicle. The response includes both the infrastructure and
the vehicle identifications and the “confirmed vehicle”
message. Once the response is received, the vehicle is
required to follow the occupancy trajectories (footprint
regions, see Figure 1b) provided by the intersection
manager. If a “request” has any potential risk of collision,
the control manager only sends back to the vehicle (V2I) the
“response” after the risk of conflict disappears.
B.
Coding Techniques
To encode the messages, an On-Off keying (OOK)
modulation scheme was used. The OOK is considered
suitable for applications in which the communication
distance is more important than data rate. The advantages of
OOK include its simplicity and ease of implementation. The
codification of the optical signals is synchronized and
includes the information related to the position ID of the
transmitters and the message to broadcast. We have
considered a 32 bits codification. Each frame is divided into
three or four blocks, depending on the kind of transmitter:
street lamps (Figure 2a) or traffic light (Figure 2b). We
assigned the first block the synchronization (SYNC) in a
[10101] pattern and the last one to the message to transmit
(Payload Data). A stop bit is used at the end of each frame.
In Figure 2a, an example of the codification used to drive
the street lamps LEDs in the crossroad is illustrated. Here,
the second block (6 bits) is assigned to ID-BIT [rrr;ccc] of
the emitter, the first three bits give the ID binary code of the
line and the next three the ID binary code of the column.
R3,4 , G3,3, B2,4 and V23 are the transmitted node packets,
in a time slot, inside the crossroad. In Figure 2b, a response
message of the traffic controller emitter located at the traffic
light is displayed. The second block (INFO) in a pattern
[000000] means that a response message is being sent by the
controller manager. The third block (6 bits) identifies the
vehicle position (ID) for which the message is intended.
Here, the signal controller [000000] responds to a request of
a vehicle located in the crossroad at position # 1 (R3,4 , G3,3,
B2,4 and V23).

Signal Decoding, Positioning and Driving Distance
In a stamp time, Figure 3a displays a MUX signal
acquired by the a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light controlled filter
[8]. On top, the signals used to drive LEDs are shown to
track the on/off states of each input. The bit sequence was
chosen to allow all the on/off sixteen possible combinations
of the four input channels. Results show that the MUX
signal presents as many off separated levels as the on/off
possible combinations of the input channels, allowing
decoding the transmitted information [13]. All the sixteen
ordered levels (d0-d15) are pointed out at the correspondent
levels, and displayed as horizontal dotted lines. On the right-
hand side of Figure 3, the match between MUX levels and
the 4 bits binary code ascribed to each level is shown.
Hence, the signal can be decoded by assigning each output
level to a 4- digit binary code [XR, XG, XB, XV], with X=1 if
the channel is on and X=0 if it is off.
In Figure 3b, the normalized MUX signals acquired by
a receiver at the crossroad, in positions #1, #3 and #5 (see
Figure 1b), are displayed. The MUX signal presented in
Figure 3a was used for calibration purposes. On the right-
hand side of the figure, the match between MUX levels and
the 4 bits binary code ascribed to each level is shown. The

decoded packet of transmitted information when all the four
transmitters are received simultaneously (#1) is presented in
the top of the figure. Comparing the calibrated levels (dotted
lines in Figure 3a) with the different generation levels
(dotted lines in Figure 3b), in the same time frame, a
straightforward algorithm [10] was used to build a 1-to-32
demultiplexer function.

the crossroad for a vehicle in positions #1, #3, #5, #7 and #9. On the top the
transmitted channels packets [R2,3, G3,3, B2,4, V2,3] are decoded.
After decoding the MUX signals, the localization of the
mobile target is direct. Taking into account the frame
structure (Figure 2), the position of the receiver inside the
navigation cell and its ID in the network is revealed. The
position comes directly from the synchronism block, where
all the received channels are, simultaneously, on or off. The
4-bit binary code ascribed to the higher level identifies the
receiver position and is displayed in the right side of the
Figure 3a. For instance, the level [1010] corresponds to the
level d10
where the red
and
the
blue channels are
simultaneously on, so, position #3 is assigned to the
receiver.
Each
decoded
message
carries,
also,
the
transmitter’s node address. So, the next block of six bits
gives the ID of the received node. In #3, the location of the
transmitters are R3,4 and B2,4 while in #1 the assigned
transmitters are R3,4 , G3,3 B2,4 and V2,3. The last block is a 20
bit word and is reserved for the transmission of the traffic
message (payload data). The vehicle speed can be calculated
by measuring the traveled distance overtime, using the ID´s
transmitters tracking. In order to obtain the receiver’s speed,
two measures are required: distance and elapsed time
(assuming uniform motion). The distance is fixed while the
elapsed time, t, will be obtained through the instants where
the number of received channels changes. At the initial
instant, t, the receiver moves West from #1 to #3 (Figure
3b). The decoded MUX message changes from four (R3,4
G3,3 B24V2,3) to two (R3,4 B2,4) transmitted channels at t+t.
The spacing between reference points is fixed (Figure 1b)
while the correspondent time integrated by the receiver
varies and depends on the vehicle’s speed crossing the
crossroad. The receivers compute the geographical position
in the successive instants (path) and infer the vehicle speed.
In the following, this data will be transmitted to another
leader vehicle through the V2V communication or to the
control manager at the traffic light through V2I [14].
III.
BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION
A.
Cooperative Communication
In the proposed scenario, when a vehicle coming from
W reaches position # 3 or one from S position #5 it sends a
message to the controller requesting permission to cross the
intersection (Figure 1b). If there is permission, it goes
forward; otherwise, it stops at the respective stop lines (W #
7; S # 9). Three instants are considered, t1, t2 and t3. At t1
and t2, Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 approach, respectively, the
intersection and contact optically the intersection manager
(controller) by sending a request message to the receiver
(V2I) at the traffic light that faces the road. All the requests
must contain the vehicle positions and the approach
velocities. As a follower exists (Vehicle 3), the request
message from Vehicle 1 includes its position and speed
received previously by V2V. This information alerts the
controller to a later request message (V2I), at t3, confirmed
later by the following vehicle. Therefore, three subsequent
instants have to be predictable, t´1, t´2 and t´3, as the
correspondent access times of the Vehicles 1, 2 and 3 to the
crossroad.
An example of messages exchange executed by the
control manager is shown in Figure 4. Here, the MUX
signal at each receiver and the assigned decoded messages
(at the top of the figures) are displayed at the request times,
t1 and t2 (Figure 4a) and at the response times, t’1 and t’2
(Figure 4b) for Vehicles 1 and 2, respectively.

At the request times, the positions of both vehicles are

for Vehicle 2. At the access times, t´1 and t´2
(Figure 4b), the connected vehicles receive their own
responses (ID: W #3 or S #5) from the control manager
(INFO: 000000). At these times, each connected vehicle is
required to follow the occupancy trajectories (footprint
regions) provided by the intersection manager (payload
data).
B.
Traffic Signal Phasing
Signal phasing is the sequence of individual signal
phases within a cycle that define the order in which
pedestrians and vehicular movements are assigned the right-
of-way. Safety requirements dictate that two vehicles
consecutively accessing the intersection and belonging to
the same flow must be separated by tailgate distance. If the
two consecutive vehicles belong to different flows, they
must be separated by vehicle stopping distance, which is
larger than tailgate distance for practical values of the
system parameters.

Phasing of traffic flows: phase number 01(pedestrian phase),

A traffic scenario was simulated (Figure 1). A brief
look into the basic anatomy and the process of timing traffic
signals is given in Figure 5. The sequential diagram
describes the phasing of the traffic flows composed of two
single-lane road phases crossing at the square intersection
area: the W flow stage (02 phase) and the S flow stage (03
phase). Green splits are calculated by dividing the cycle
length in proportion to the critical lane volumes. Each
driving vehicle is then assigned an individualised time to
request (t1,2,3) and access (t´1,2,3) the intersection. During the
course of phases 02 and 03 the pedestrians, through a
pushbutton,
request
to
pass
the
crossroad
and
are
acknowledged. The phase 01 stage, “Walk” interval begins
at the end of phase 03 and the controller sends a response
message to nomadic road user´s devices (e.g., smartphone,
tablets). Sufficient time must be provided to cross the entire
travelled width of the street. In phase 01 the “don’t walk”
interval is calculated based on the length of the crosswalk.
A first-come-first-served approach could be realized by
accelerating or decelerating the vehicles such that they
arrive at the intersection when gaps in the conflicting traffic
flows and pedestrians have been created for them. However,
a one-by-one service policy is not efficient at high vehicle
arrival rates. From a capacity point of view, it is more
efficient if Vehicle 3 is given access at t’3 before Vehicle 2,
t’2 to the intersection, then, forming a west platoon of
vehicles before (t´2) giving way to the south conflicting flow,
as stated in Figure 5.

(V2V) and with the infrastructure (V2I). A control manager
coordinates the crossroad and interacts with the vehicles
(I2V). VLC is the transmission technology. A simulated
traffic scenario was presented and a generic model of
cooperative transmissions for vehicular communications
services
was
established.
The
experimental
results
confirmed that the proposed cooperative VLC architecture is
suitable for the intended applications. The introduction of
VLC between connected vehicles and the infrastructures,
I2V2V2I2V communication allows the direct monitoring of
relative speed thresholds and inter-vehicle spacing. The
distance between conflicting vehicles and the trajectories of
other opposing vehicles should also be monitored and
optimized.
In order to move towards real implementation, the
performance of such systems still needs improvement. As
further work, the research team plans to finalize the
embedded application, for experimenting in several road
configurations with either static or moving vehicles.
