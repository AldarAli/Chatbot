Abstract—Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology for im-
proving usage of frequency band. In CR network, cognitive radio
users (CUs) are allowed to use the bands without interference to
operation of licensed users. Reliable sensing information about
status of primary user (PU), who is assigned a licensed band, is a
pre-requirement for CR network. Cooperative spectrum sensing
(CSS) is able to offer an improved sensing reliability compared
to individual sensing. However, when the number of CUs is large,
the latency and network trafﬁc for reporting sensing results to
the Fusion Center (FC) become extremely large, which may
result in an extended sensing time and collision in the control
channel between Cognitive Users (CUs) and the FC. In this paper,
we propose an ordered Sequential-Superposition Cooperative
Spectrum Sensing (SSCSS) scheme for faster and more reliable
spectrum sensing of CR network. Superposition CSS technique
extends sensing time to the reporting slots of other CUs until
their round of reporting. The proposed scheme estimates the
required number of CUs needed to sense for satisfying the
reliability requirement of the system. Furthermore, the scheme
decides which CUs (and their orders of polling) will be chosen
for the sensing process to maximize performance of the proposed
scheme. The simulation results of the proposed scheme show the
outstanding performance of the proposed scheme compared with
the other conventional CSS.
Keywords–cognitive radio; ordered sequential cooperative spec-
trum sensing; superposition cooperative spectrum sensing.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, more bandwidth and higher bit-rates have been
required to meet usage demands due to an explosion in
wireless communication technology. According to the Federal
Communications Commission’s spectrum policy task force
report [1], the actual utilization of the licensed spectrum varies
from 15% to 80%. In some cases, the utilization is only a few
percent of the total capacity. Cognitive radio (CR) technology
[2] has been proposed to solve the problem of ineffective
utilization of spectrum bands. Both unlicensed and licensed
users, termed the cognitive radio user (CU) and primary user
(PU), respectively, operate in CR networks. In CR network,
CUs are allowed to access the frequency assigned to PU when
it is free. But CU must vacate the occupied frequency when
the presence of PU is detected. Therefore, reliable detection
of the PU’s signal is a requirement of CR networks.
In order to ascertain the presence of a PU, CUs can use
one of several common detection methods, such as matched
ﬁlter, feature, and energy detection [2][3]. Energy detection
is the optimal sensing method if the CU has the limited
information about PU’s signal (e.g., only the local noise power
is known) [3]. In energy detection, frequency energy in the
sensing channel is collected in a ﬁxed bandwidth W over
an observation time window T to compare with the energy
threshold and determine whether or not the channel is utilized.
However, the received signal power may ﬂuctuate severely due
to multipath fading and shadowing effects. Therefore, it is
difﬁcult to obtain reliable detection with only one CU. Better
sensing performance can be obtained by allowing some CUs
to perform cooperative spectrum sensing [4][5][6].
In CSS, because of the limitations of the control channel,
CUs will report their sensing information to the FC one by one.
Subsequently, in a CR network with a large number of CUs
a very large number of reports will be transmitted through a
control channel, which can make the sensing process sluggish
and result in overhead trafﬁc in the control channel. In order
to solve those problems of CSS, SCSS scheme [8][9] has been
proposed. In SCSS, the fusion center (FC) acts as the control
center for the operation of CR network. The FC sends the
“sensing request” message to CUs when it needs their sensing
information, and randomly polls CUs one by one until the
condition required to make a global decision is satisﬁed. The
ordered SCSS can improve sensing performance by polling
sensing results of CUs according to their order of reliability
(i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensing channel of the CU).
The ordered SCSS can efﬁciently reduce the number of sensing
report from the CUs. However, the conventional SCSS uses the
same sensing time for all CUs. The superposition CSS [8] can
solve this problem of conventional SCSS by extending sensing
duration of CUs to the reporting time of other CUs.
In
this
paper,
we
propose
an
ordered
sequential-
superposition CSS for cognitive radio networks. The proposed
scheme estimates the required number of CUs needed to
poll for satisfying the reliability requirement of the system.
Furthermore, through the proposed scheme we can decide
which CUs will be chosen for the sensing process and their
orders of polling to maximize sensing performance.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
and analyses the energy detection method. Section 3 gives a
detailed explanation of the ordered sequential-superposition
cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. Section 4 introduces
simulation models and simulation results of the proposed
scheme. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.

SYSTEM MODEL
In this paper, we consider a network consisting of N CUs.
In addition, there is one PU occupying the observed band with
150

a speciﬁc probability. If the CR network needs the sensing
information, the FC will send the “request message” to the
selected CUs with their order of polling. When the CU receives
the “request message” from the FC, it will perform spectrum
sensing (SS) and report sensing result to the FC according to
its order of polling.
We assume that all CUs utilize energy detector for SS.
Then at the ith sensing interval, the received signal energy
Ej(i) of the jth CU is given as:
Ej (i) =
{ ∑ki+Mj−1
k=ki
|nj (k)|2,
H0
∑ki+Mj−1
k=ki
|hjx (k) + nj (k)| 2, H1
(1)
where H0 and H1 correspond to the hypotheses of the absence
and presence of the PU signal, respectively, x(k) represents the
signal transmitted from the PU, hj denotes the amplitude gain
of the channel, and n(k) is the additive white Gaussian noise,
Mj = tsjfs is the number of samples over a sensing interval,
tsj is sensing time, fs is sensing bandwidth and ki is the time
slot at which the ith sensing interval starts.
In conventional CSS, when a CU sends sensing results to
the FC, others will keep silent as shown in Fig. 1. In this
case, all CUs have the same sensing time such that ts1,C =
ts2,C = ... = tsN,C = ts. On the other hand, superposition
CSS extends the sensing time of CUs to the reporting time of
other CUs as shown in Fig. 2.
When Mj is relatively large (e.g., Mj > 200), Ej can be
well approximated as a Gaussian random variable under both
hypotheses as follows [7]:
N
(
µj,H0 = Mj, σ2
j,H0 = 2Mj
)
N
(
µj,H1 = Mj (γj + 1) , σ2
j,H1 = 2Mj (2γj + 1)
)
(2)
where N(.) is Gaussian distribution, µj,H0 and µj,H1 are the
mean of Ej under H0 and H1 hypothesis, respectively, σ2
j,H0
and σ2
j,H1 are the variance of Ej under H0 and H1 hypothesis,
respectively, γj is SNR in the sensing channel between the jth
CU and the PU.
The local decision of the jth CU at the ith sensing interval
can be made as the following rule:

We deﬁne the reliability of CU as probability of false alarm

. If all CUs have the same P ∗

with lower value of Pf,j

will be higher reliability.

THE ORDERED SEQUENTIAL-SUPERPOSITION
COOPERATIVE SPECTRUM SENSING SCHEME
In conventional ordered based SCSS, the highest reliability
CU (the CU with the highest SNR of sensing channel) should
be polled ﬁrst for fast SS. However, this technique gives good
performance only for CSS with the same sensing time for
151

all CUs. In this paper, we propose an ordered sequential-
superposition CSS for cognitive radio network in which the
the set of CUs will be selected to perform SS and each of
selected CU will be assigned a suitable sensing time for the
best sensing performance of sensing process.
In the initial stage, a requirement number of CUs, p, which
is needed to perform SS, will be selected as 0 < p < N.
After that, FC will choose the set of p highest reliability CUs,
Ω = [CU1, CU2,..., CUp]. Set Ω is sorted according to the
increasing order of reliability that is CU1 is the lowest reliable
CU and CUp is the highest reliable CU. The CUs included in
set Ω will be required to sense the signal from the PU.
We assume that all CUs have the same reporting time such
that tr1,S = tr2,S = ... = trN,S = tr. Then the sensing time
for p CUs will be given as follows:
ts1,S = ts
ts2,S = ts1,S + tr = ts + tr
ts3,S = ts2,S + tr = ts + 2tr
...
tsp,S = tsp−1,S + tr = ts + (p − 1) tr
(7)
This means that the CU, who ﬁrstly reports sensing infor-
mation to the FC, will have the shortest sensing time ts1,S = ts
and the CU, who is the last CU reporting sensing information
to the FC, will have the longest sensing time tsN,S. The time
frame of the proposed scheme is shown in the Fig. 3.
In order to maximize sensing performance, in the proposed
scheme the CU with higher reliability, CUp, will be assigned
to have the longer sensing time tsp,S. Subsequently, the highest
reliable CU CUp is required to sense in tsp,S time and is the
last CU reporting sensing information to the FC. On the other
hand, the lowest reliable CU, CU1, is required to sense in ts1,S
time and ﬁrstly reports sensing information to the FC.

Figure 4. Flow-chart of the proposed scheme
In order to start the sensing process, FC will send the
“sensing request” message and the order of reporting to the
CUs in Ω. When CUs receive the “sensing request” message
from the FC, they will sense the signal from the PU until
their round of reporting. Each CU will make local decision
as Eqn. (3) and report its decision to the FC. At the FC, the
accumulated log-likelihood of p CUs will be calculated as [12]:
Γ =
∑
j∈Ω

where
Γj = log Pd,j

Γj = log (1−Pd,j)

The global decision about status of the PU signal can be
made as:
{

Here, the value of accumulated log-likelihood of p CUs, Γ,
is known as reliable level of sensing process. Then we utilize
Γ as a criteria to update the required number of CUs for the

The value of p can be updated at each sensing interval
according to values of “reliable threshold” and ‘ﬂuctuate
level” as p (i) = min (p (i − 1) + 1, N), if βσ0 < Γ < βσ1
and Uin > thp, where β is “adjusting factor” for “reliable

(2 − β)σ0 or Γ > (2 − β)σ1 and Ude > thp, the value of p
will be updated as p (i) = max (p (i − 1) − 1, 1). Otherwise,
the value of p will be kept the same to that one of the previous

and conventional SCSS with ordered and randomly polling are
provided. The network includes 30 CUs with SNR of sensing
channel varying from -14dB to -43dB and ts = tr = 1ms. In
order to evaluate the performance in terms of reducing required

The performance of reference schemes, conventional SCSS
with ordered and randomly polling, are shown in Figs. 6 and 7,
respectively. Both schemes consider superposition for assign-
ing sensing time for each CU. The ordered SCSS polls sensing
information from CUs according to their values of SNR in
the sensing channel; the CUs with higher SNR will be polled
sooner than the CUs with lower SNR. The randomly polling
SCSS randomly choose the CUs to poll sensing information.
From Figs. 5, 6 and 7, it can be observed that the proposed
scheme has the best performance. When ηCU = 0.3, the
proposed scheme obtains the sensing performance of Pd = 0.9
and Pf = 0.1; however, the randomly polling SCSS and
ordered SCSS obtains sensing performance of Pd = 0.75 and
Pf = 0.25. The randomly polling SCSS can get the similar
sensing performance to that of the proposed scheme when its
required number of CUs is two time higher (i.e., ηCU = 0.6)
than that of the proposed scheme. For the conventional ordered
SCSS, most of high reliable CUs are polled to achieve good
sensing performance at Pd = 0.75 and Pf = 0.25, and the
performance cannot be improved even when the number of
polled CUs is increased.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, an ordered sequential-superposition CSS
is proposed for fast SS. The proposed scheme shows the
algorithm to determine how many and which CUs are needed
to sense the signal from PU and their corresponding sensing
time for superposition CSS. The simulation results prove that
the proposed scheme signiﬁcantly improves performance of
sensing process and can reduce 50% of required number of
CUs to achieve the similar sensing performance to conven-
tional SCSS.
