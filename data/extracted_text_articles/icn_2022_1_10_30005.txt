 INTRODUCTION 
Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications have become 
widespread across various domains, such as smart cities, 
industrial 
automation, 
human 
healthcare, 
and 
smart 
everything, which has spurred an explosive growth in the 
number of IoT devices. Central city areas are increasingly 
using information and IoT technologies to resolve problems 
related to urbanizations, and thus, the overall IoT systems 
have been widely adopted as a solution for various urban 
characteristics, social needs, and governmental structures [1]. 
Smart cities are typically considered a panacea for urban 
problems, but large-scale natural disasters and global 
pandemics are significant treats to our daily lives. Therefore, 
ensuring the bright future of smart cities, i.e., achieving 
disaster-resilient smart cities, is of greater importance and 
influence with modern applications in diverse circumstances. 
Success in this context is dependent on the effective 
deployment of advanced wireless network technologies. 
Smart-city applications are characterized by use of a 
massive 
connectivity, 
known 
as 
machine-type 
communications, which is quite different from traditional 
human-type communications in terms of efficiency and 
reliability. The features of these systems include low power, 
broad coverage, ultra-density, and mobile edge computing [2]. 
In addition, today’s smart-city solutions face unique 
limitations due to unpredictable and non-uniform traffic, and 
some areas may be outside the wireless network coverage, 
such as rural areas or any area after a disaster has occurred [3]. 
In disaster-resilient smart cities, the deployment of secure and 
reliable wireless communications is of extreme importance 
when dealing with users’ health records and other sensitive 
information [4]. For example, to enable public-safety 
broadcasting, mission-critical control, and emergency calls, 
the smart-city applications must be resilient and robust, and 
provide instant communication with various services [5]. 
One promising element of the solution for the above 
demands is the use of an Information-Centric Network (ICN), 
(e.g., a content-centric network or named-data network). This 
is a promising network architecture that is poised to replace 
the current IP-based networks [6]. It natively supports features, 
such as abstraction, naming, and in-network caching, 
improves delays and reduces network traffic. Moreover, ICN-
based systems can decouple data from its original location and 
adopt individual data-based security at the network level. 
However, as far as we know, suitable wireless systems have 
not yet been sufficiently investigated and discussed from the 
viewpoints 
of 
integrating 
communication, 
caching, 
computing, control, sensing, and localization technologies in 
disaster-affected and communications outage areas [7]. 
As a physical-layer protocol underpinning ICN-based 
networks, the ad-hoc wireless networking and multi-hop relay 
networking techniques function as clues for adopting practical 
usage. These technologies enhance the domain of 
autonomous-distributed services at the cost of efficient 
utilization of system resources [8]. However, they come with 
several technical concerns, including limited battery power, 
range between devices, bandwidth, dis-connectivity, network 
overload, data redundancy, communication overhead, 
network lifetime, lack of information, and data integration 
difficulties. Therefore, a new ICN-based network protocol and 
friendly wireless communications technologies are strongly 
required. 
On the basis of the above background, this paper provides 
an overall blueprint of our study in progress, including a novel 
cooperative communication scheme for effective ICN-based 
wireless networks. Cooperative communications technologies 
can be used to increase the gains by harnessing the effects of 
path diversity, i.e., by having a relay node send the same data 
to a destination node if the data transmission is not successful. 
In the proposed scheme, in order to improve the performance 
of such communication, we apply a Network Coding (NC) [9] 
technique to eliminate the amount of network traffic on relay 
nodes. In addition, to reduce the radio interference among 
multiple relay nodes during the data flooding process, the 
proposed 
scheme 
utilizes 
a 
constructive-interference 
phenomena [10].

The combination of NC and ICN has attracted significant 
interest in recent studies. Montpetit et al. [11] utilized them in 
the internetworking layer, by applying the NC technique to 
enhance the performance of forwarding data in ICNs. 
Mekbungwan et al. [12] proposed an NC-based data 
dissemination system made up of bulk data, such as photos, 
maps, and databases for situational awareness in post-disaster 
areas. It was designed on the basis of delay-torrent 
networking’s store-carry-and-forward method in order to 
reduce the amount of network traffic on relay nodes. For the 
next-generation cellular networks, the packet duplication 
method is being introduced to meet the 99.999% reliability 
requirement, where the original packet and its duplicate are 
transmitted via two different physical paths, which is the same 
concept as the path-diversity technique [13]. However, the 
radio resource consumption is proportional to the number of 
data copies, and this duplication of data caching leads to a 
significant waste of radio resources. To tackle this problem, 
Zhu et al. [14] proposed a new task-oriented communication 
technology in which the waveform superposition property of 
a wireless channel is exploited to achieve over-the-air 
aggregation of data simultaneously transmitted by devices. 
The idea of overlaying signals can be seen as a kind of NC in 
the physical layer. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, we go over the basic principle of cooperative 
communications. Section III describes the proposed scheme, 
and Section IV presents the numerical results. We conclude in 
Section V with a brief summary and mention of future work. 
II. 
COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATIONS IN WIRELESS 
NETWORKS 
Communication between source and destination takes 
place through different paths by means of cooperating entities 
called relays. Among the relay techniques in wireless (multi-
hop and ad-hoc) networks, the decode-and-forward relaying 
method is used to decode the data that reaches the relay node 
and then re-encode and forward them. Another technique, the 
amplify-and-forward relaying method, can be selected as a 
simple forwarding mechanism. In the example shown in 
Figure 1 (a), we focus on nodes 𝔸, 𝔹, and ℂ and presume that 
𝔸  and 𝔹  send 𝔸 ’s data of 𝑨  and 𝔹 ’s data of 𝑩 , and ℂ 
exchanges them as relay nodes. In this case, the data 
transmission is completed in four steps: sending 𝑨 from 𝔸 to 
ℂ, sending 𝑩 from 𝔹 to ℂ, forwarding 𝑨 from ℂ to 𝔹, and 
forwarding 𝑩 from ℂ to 𝔸. The NC technique is used here 
with the aim of improving throughput. When ℂ transfers the 
bit-by-bit mixed data of 𝑨 and 𝑩 by utilizing an Exclusive OR 
(XOR) operation, the data transmission procedure can be 
reduced to three steps: sending 𝑨 from 𝔸 to ℂ, sending 𝑩 
from 𝔹  to ℂ , and forwarding 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩  from ℂ  to 𝔸  and 𝔹 
during broadcasting. After receiving 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩, 𝔸 can restore 𝑩 
by (𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩) ⊕ 𝑨, and 𝔹 can restore 𝑨 in the same manner. 
Note that ⊕ denotes the XOR operator. 
III. 
PROPOSED SCHEME 
ICN decouples the data from its original location using a 
name-based data-centric network scheme, which enables the 
network layer to cache and deliver named data regardless of 
the availability of the original (source) publisher. Moreover, 
ICN can provide content-based security, i.e., all security-
sensitive information can be exchanged via the wireless 
channel. In this section, we provide an overview of the 
proposed scheme, including the proposed cooperative scheme, 
Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, and wireless 
communications protocol. 
A. Proposed cooperative communications 
In-network caching—where each node duplicates the 
frequently used data by leveraging their embedded cache 
memory—helps to decrease the end-to-end delay and reduce 
the network traffic. To accelerate the effect of the caching 
processing, the nodes should actively accumulate the caching 
data. One of the key features of a wireless communication 
system is that it is generally able to overhear what neighbor 
nodes can receive whether they desire it or not. For example, 
in Figures 1 (a), when 𝔸 sends 𝑨 to ℂ, 𝔽 and 𝔻 can also 
receive 𝑨; similarly, when 𝔹 sends 𝑩 to ℂ, 𝔾 can also receive 
𝑩 , which is essentially an off-path caching mechanism. 
Similarly, 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩 from ℂ can be received not only from 𝔸 
and 𝔹 but also from 𝔻 and 𝔼. 
For the NC-encoded data, in the proposed scheme, 𝔻 and 
𝔼  also send 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩  as a helper with ℂ  by performing 
multiplexing in the assist phase, as shown in Figure 1 (b). As 
a result, if 𝔸 fails to receive 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩 from ℂ, it can recover it 
by utilizing 𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩  from 𝔻  thanks to the benefit of path 
diversity afforded through the different wireless channels. By 
using this mechanism, the nodes located around 𝔻 and 𝔼 but 
outside the coverage area of ℂ can be additionally off-path 
cached, which expands the number of new cashable nodes.

B. Proposed MAC protocol 
The pure (unslotted) Aloha method has been adopted as a 
channel access protocol in commercial low-power wide-area 
networks, such as SigFox and long-range alliance. In these 
systems, to eliminate automatic repeat-request messages, the 
data are iteratively transmitted. The motivation behind using 
an uncomplicated protocol is to simplify the device 
implementation (including low-energy consumption), and 
because the synchronization among nodes is not practically 
available. 
For the above scenario, the proposed scheme is similarly 
based on current systems. To support the cooperative 
mechanism, each node has four states: standby, transmission, 
relay, and assist. Every node regularly maintains the standby 
state (e.g., 𝔽  and 𝔾 ), and the status is changed to the 
transmission state when it makes a data transmission request 
(e.g., 𝔸 and 𝔹). While receiving surrounding (overheard) data, 
if the node receives two different data and those data should 
be forwarded, the status moves to the relay state (e.g., ℂ). On 
the other hand, if the received data is NC-encoded data, the 
status switches to the assist state (e.g., 𝔻 and 𝔼). We assume 
that every node knows whether it needs to relay the data, that 
the NC-encoded data’s number of multi-hops is predefined, 
and that the nodes can determine their upper limitation of 
forwarding in order to avoid unlimited hops.  
The current wireless communication systems using the 
pure-Aloha method presuppose that the data transmission has 
a sufficiently long interval, implying that collision or 
interference among nodes will not be fatal issues. However, 
as shown in Figure 2, in the proposed scheme, since the relay 
nodes and assist nodes forward the NC-encoded data 
immediately (in the relay and assist phases), collision and 
interference in a regional area are inevitable.  
C. Proposed physical protocol 
To tackle the issue of collision and interference caused by 
forwarding multiple NC-encoded based packets, the proposed 
scheme adopts the constructive-interference phenomena—if 
receiver-side nodes can detect a superposition of baseband 
signals from multiple transmitter-side nodes, the interference 
can be ignored. In wireless sensor networks, constructive 
interference has not been extensively exploited because of the 
difficulty of achieving sufficiently accurate synchronization 
and the requirement of highly predictable software delays. 
However, this approach is suitable for the scenarios in which 
the proposed scheme is applicable (i.e., in the relay and assist 
phases). Note that, in cases where different data are in 
conflicts with each other, the proposed scheme cannot be 
applied, which is beyond the scope of our present study. 
IV. 
NUMERICAL RESULT 
In our initial evaluation of the proposed scheme, we 
investigated the restorability of the baseband signal by using 
the 
constructive-interference 
phenomena 
and 
the 
improvement in data caching among nodes. 
Assuming an experimental network composed of a relay 
node, an assist node, and a receiver node, we implemented a 
scenario in which the relay node and the assist node send the 
same data packet to the receiver node. In other words, it is the 
same as the case where ℂ and 𝔻 forward the NC-encoded data 
and 𝔸 receives them (Figure 1). The computer simulation is 
conducted using the Matlab simulator and the simulation 
parameters are listed in Table I. The waveforms of the radio 
signal arriving from the relay and assist nodes are generated 
using the same data and system, but they have a time gap of 
φ. Figure 3 shows the detector’s performance for the received 
signal. Let 𝑇 denotes the time period required to transmit one 
symbol of the modulation method. Due to space limitations, 
we do not illustrate the cases where φ = 0 and φ = 𝑇 but the 
former had a clearly separated constellation of received 
signals and a clear eye pattern, while the latter had the 
opposite result and thus the detector could not demodulate. 
According to the results in Figure 3, when φ = 1/4𝑇, 2/4𝑇, and 
3/4𝑇, we could achieve the separate construction and obtain a 
clear eye pattern, and the receiver node could correctly decode. 
To illustrate the benefit of the proposed assist nodes, we 
performed another evaluation using computer simulation 
implemented in C++ language. In this simulation, 10,000 
nodes were deployed in a 1-km2 area, the communication 
range of the nodes was set to 100 m, and the unreachable 
probability of the data (i.e., packet error ratio) was set to 5%. 
In the conventional scheme, the relay node forwards the NC-
encoded data three times, whereas, in the proposed scheme, 
the assist nodes that receive the NC-encoded data forward at 
the same time as the relay node. Since the assist nodes that 
receive the first-forwarded data from the relay station will 
transmit them twice, and the nodes that receive the second-
forwarded data will transmit them once, the end of the assist 
phase can keep in step with the end of the relay phase, and the 
proposed scheme can prevent infinite data flooding. As we 
can see in Figure 4 (a), the number of successfully cached 
nodes per 10,000 was improved by 43.5% thanks to the assist 
nodes. As for spreading the NC-encoded data, as shown in

Figure 4 (b), when the forwarding trials were increased, the 
nodes were enhanced by 306% and 123% for the proposed 
scheme compared to just 4.98% and 0.234% for the 
conventional scheme. At the end of the relay and assist phases, 
the proposed scheme could cache 8.61 times as many nodes 
as the conventional one. Note that, for decoding the NC-
encoded data, plain data is required, e.g., either 𝑨 or 𝑩 for 
𝑨 ⊕ 𝑩. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper proposed a novel cooperative communication 
scheme using the NC technique with constructive-interference 
phenomena for information-centric wireless networks. 
Numerical results of our initial evaluation of the scheme were 
reported. As future work, we will expand the practical 
scenarios from the 
quality-of-service perspective to 
investigate long-lifetime and robustness characteristics.
