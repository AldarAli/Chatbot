Abstract—Electronic
Health
(eHealth)
offers
innovative
solutions
for
improving
the
access
and
management
of
healthcare delivery. This study aims to explore factors that
influence health managers’ acceptance of eHealth services in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It has been planned to be
carried out in three phases: a Systematic Review (SR), a
quantitative survey, and a qualitative interview. Inclusion and
exclusion
criteria
for
each
phase
were
applied.
Ethical
approval to conduct the study had been gained. Thirty-nine
factors were identified as influencing health managers’ eHealth
acceptance in KSA. The top influential factors were: (i)
Availability
of
operational
resources,
(ii)
Trust
in
confidentiality, security, and data privacy, (iii) Availability of
qualified
human
resources,
(iv)
Information
and
Communication
Technology
(ICT)
infrastructure
and
readiness, and (v) The quality of eHealth systems and
applications. Findings from this research have drawn a clearer
picture of the key challenges in health managers’ acceptance of
eHealth services in KSA. Areas for improvement are to be
highlighted in the final analysis.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Electronic Health (eHealth) is defined as the use of ICT
for healthcare [1]. eHealth offers innovative solutions for
improving the access to and management of healthcare
delivery. The KSA is a country with one of the largest land
masses and populations in the Middle East [2]. It has
difficult geographical terrain, which makes the delivery of
health services challenging. The Ministry of Health (MOH)
is the main health provider in KSA, responsible for around
60% of all health services and facilities in the country.
Private health sector and other government run health
authorities are the providers for the remainder. Many
initiatives
to
embrace
technology
in
healthcare
were
launched by the MOH to advance the level of health
technology acceptance. Despite the growth of eHealth
publications in KSA, it is limited to only a few provinces
and more research related to the end-users’ acceptance of
eHealth services is needed. The overall aim of this study is
to explore the factors that influence health managers’
acceptance of eHealth in KSA.
II.
METHODS
In this section, the methods of conducting the three
phases of the study are described.
A. 1st phase SR
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review
and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) checklist of 17
items
was
followed
in
writing
the
protocol
for
the
systematic review [3]. The protocol was registered with the
prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD Prospero)
[4] and a scoping search was conducted in May, 2017.
Five databases, namely Association for Computing
Machinery
(ACM),
Google
Scholar,
Medline,
ScienceDirect, and Web of Science, were searched for
articles published between January 1st, 1993 and May 1st,
2017.
Studies
included
were
peer-reviewed,
full-text
primary articles. One reviewer performed the searches; two
reviewers independently screened the titles, then abstracts,
followed by full articles. Exclusions were recorded, as
indicated below. Three tools were applied, based on study
design, to assess the quality of the articles that were
included:
1.
Questionnaire checklist developed by Crombie and
adopted by the Centre of Evidence Based Management
(CEBMa) [5].
2.
Qualitative checklist provided by Critical Appraisal
Skills Programme (CASP), Public Health Resource
Unit [6].
3.
Critical appraisal checklist developed by a group of
researchers led by N. Mays for mixed methods studies
[7].
B. 2nd phase survey
An online questionnaire was developed based on two
sources; first, the findings from the SR, and second, the
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology
(UTAUT)
[8].
Professionals
in
KSA
with
a
health
management role were invited to take part. Participation
links were distributed across social media platforms.
C. 3rd phase qualitative interviews
For more in depth exploration, semi-structured face-to-
face and telephone interviews were conducted with health
managers
in
Aseer
province,
KSA
to
address
the
geographical limitation of studies published to date. A draft

interview schedule was developed based on the findings
from phase 2 (survey). Invitations to participate in the study
were emailed to all potential participants who met the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. A study information sheet
and consent form were attached to the invitation emails.
Ethical approval for conducting the 2nd and 3rd phases
had been gained from:
1.
Ethical Review Panel, School of Pharmacy and
Life
Sciences,
Robert
Gordon
University,
Aberdeen, UK.
2.
Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health (MOH),
Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

RESULTS
A summary of findings from the three phases are
presented in this section.
A. 1st phase SR
After
duplicates
were
removed,
110
papers
were
screened, and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria (Table I).
Thirty-nine influential factors were identified from the
included studies. Two knowledge gaps were found: lack of
eHealth studies from the perspective of health managers and
the limitation of studies to few geographical areas in the
country [9].
TABLE I. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
Participants
Inclusion:
 Health professionals (medical doctors,
nurses, midwives, pharmacists, dentists,
all other allied health professionals e.g.
radiology and laboratory technicians).
 Health IT professionals.
 Health managers.
Exclusion:
 IT professionals who do not have a role
in any health facilities and organisations
Interventions
Inclusion:
The intervention for this study is eHealth.
This systematic review aims to include all
published articles and literature around
eHealth adoption, acceptance, facilitators
and barriers in Saudi Arabia from the
views of multiple stakeholders.
Exclusion:
Studies that focus on pure technological
infrastructure and products without the
users views such as: health technology
applications and Internet of Things (IoT)
for health.
Studies
Inclusion:
This systematic review focused on peer
reviewed primary published articles and
literature with all types of study design
such as quantitative, qualitative and mixed
methods.
Exclusion:
Reviews, blogs, books chapters, and health
website contents were excluded.
B. 2nd phase survey
Findings showed the top influential factors to health
managers’
acceptance
of
eHealth
services
were:
(i)
Availability of operational resources, (ii) Privacy and
security of health information, (iii) ICT infrastructure and
readiness, (iv) Availability of qualified human resources,
and (v) The quality of eHealth systems and applications
(Figure 1).

C. 3rd phase qualitative interviews
Initial analysis confirmed the significance of the factors
identified in the 2nd phase of the study. Further work will
focus on mapping factors against UTAUT constructs and
statistical
analysis
of
the
influencing
predictors
to
behavioral intention and actual eHealth use behavior to give
a holistic overview of the key challenges in accepting
eHealth services in KSA.
IV.
CONCLUSION
This study has been conducted by a multidisciplinary
team focused on providing a holistic overview of challenges
in health managers’ acceptance of eHealth services in the
KSA. A mixed methods approach was applied to strengthen
the
findings.
It
is
suggested
to
apply caution
upon
interpretation of the results as they only showed the
perspectives of health managers. Extending the research to
cover the views of other health groups such as health
professionals is recommended to draw a clearer picture that
may represent KSA health workforce in general.
