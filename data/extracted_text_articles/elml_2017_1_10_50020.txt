Abstract—Learning Style is an important factor that 
determines how students acquire knowledge. In this paper, we 
present our approach for recognition of students learning 
styles on the web-based learning environment and adaptation 
features that will help to personalize their learning experience 
leading to improved learning outcomes.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
With the development of sophisticated e-learning 
environments, which characterize the huge information, the 
strong interactivity, the great coverage and no space-time 
restrictions [1], personalization is becoming an important 
feature in e-learning systems. The large numbers of 
students, the main users of such systems have differences in 
background, goals, capabilities and learning styles [2]. 
Adapting these differences especially on web-based systems 
will personalize their learning experience and therefore 
increase their motivation and learning outcomes especially 
when they are completely self-directed learners. Learning 
Styles as one of these individual differences every student 
possesses can be defined as everything that is characteristic 
to that particular individual when he/she is learning, i.e., a 
specific manner of approaching a learning task, the learning 
strategies activated in order to fulfill the task [3]. Various 
researches have tried to provide adaptation on the web, 
based on this important trait, but the main challenges still 
remain on how to effectively detect and adapt learning 
styles without destructing student-learning experience. So in 
this paper, we are outlining different methods especially 
implicit methods used by related works and then explain our 
approach and why we think it is effective. 
       The paper has been arranged as follows: In Section 2, 
an overview of learning styles estimation methods is given 
while Section 3 points out the details of implicit methods. 
Section 4 explains our approach and the last section gives a 
conclusion and future work to be done. 
II. 
LEARNING STYLES ESTIMATION METHODS 
Most of the approaches proposed can be categories into 
either an explicit or implicit approach. Explicit approaches 
estimate learning styles by directly gather information using 
one or more users` query methods while implicit approaches 
rely on actions and behavior of users observed during their 
interaction with the system. The latter means the user 
models are updated by using information that is collected 
automatically [4]. 
III. 
IMPLICIT METHODS 
      The implicit approaches fall into 2 types, which are 
literature based approaches and data-driven approaches. In 
literature-based approaches, behavior and actions of users 
are monitored and used as hints about their preferences by 
applying the simple rule method [5] to estimate the match 
with predefined learning style classes. The advantage of this 
approach is its ability to deduct learning style without the 
need of training data since it depends entirely on learning 
style models [4]. Data-driven approaches depend on real 
users’ data and therefore have a high chance of being 
accurate but the main challenge is a representative dataset is 
needed to be available to build an accurate classifier [6][10]. 
The following are classification methods used by most of 
the existing data-driven systems. 
A. Artificial Neural Networks 
Neural Networks are a computational approaches with a 
model that base on the biological neural structure of the 
brain. They comprise of input layer, which has neurons that 
receive signals from the environment, hidden layer transmits 
signals to other neurons after getting the input from other 
neurons and output layer that sends output signals to the 
environment. Feed Forward Neural Network, which is one 
type of neural network was used by Villaverde et. al [7] to 
model learning styles from students’ actions by identifying 
ten patterns of  behavior to be a network input. The output 
of this model represents three dimensions of Felder-
Silverman learning styles model. The good thing about this 
method is, it can be updated quickly since it relies on history 
profiles and therefore, it can distinguish changes in users’ 
behavior. 
B. Bayesian Networks 
Since a Bayesian Network (BN) is a directed, acyclic 
graph whose nodes are labeled by random variables [8], it 
can be used to model the relationship between the learning 
styles and the factors determining them. Garcia et al [9] used 
this approach to implicitly detect students learning styles by 
observing their behavior in SAVER system. The random 
variables were the different dimensions of Felder-Silverman 
Learning styles and the factors that determine each of these

aspects and these factors were extracted from the students’ 
interaction data with the system. The reported reasons to use 
BN are its natural representation of probabilistic information, 
its efficiency, and its support to encode uncertain expert 
knowledge. Fig.1 shows an example of the structure of BN, 
where leaf nodes represent student’s observable behavior and 
root nodes represent the learning style to infer [9][10].

C. Decision Trees and Hidden Markov Model 
       Decision trees (DT) are an AI classification algorithm 
frequently used in estimating learning styles because of its 
simplicity, the rules of classification are visible and easy to 
understand, and it is appropriate when many attributes are 
relevant [10] .Cha et al [11] used this approach with 58 
patterns of behavior to automatically deduce the 4 
dimensions of Felder-Silverman model [12] of 70 students 
in a web-based learning course. He used together with 
Hidden Markov Model (HMM). His DT structure consisted 
of leaves that represent the learning styles to be inferred, 
and the nodes that represent the features tracked that lead to 
those learning styles [10].  
IV. 
OUR APPROACH 
A. Learning Style Estimation 
Since most of the implicit approaches rely on available 
data, we think at the initial stage when the system does not 
have enough data about a new log in user, a direct feedback 
from a user should be used to estimate their preference. This 
approach helps to solve “cold start” problem. “Cold start” is 
the problem whereby a new user of the system starts with 
nothing in his/her profile, and therefore a training period is 
required to train the profile before it accurately reflects 
user’s preferences [13]. To solve this problem, most systems 
use collaborative filtering approach in which a prediction is 
made about a new user based on the similarity between the 
interest profile of that user and those of other users 
[14][15][16]. This may be suitable in other domains like e-
commerce, but in learning environment may not be effective 
because no matter how similar users might be, they still 
have their own unique way of learning. Then, during their 
learning period, their interaction data should be the one to 
be used. This means we are using both explicit and implicit 
approaches with initial and learning process stages 
respectively. 
 
Initial Stage: 
When a new user logs into the system, the Kolb’s 
Learning Style Inventory questionnaire (LSI) will be given. 
LSI was “designed to measure the degree to which 
individuals display different learning styles” in accordance 
with Kolb’s learning style model [4][17]. Kolb’s model as 
one of the many learning style models found in the literature 
is probably the most famous one. This model articulates that 
people learn from experience so the learning is a continual 
process, which follows the cycle. Therefore, it is very 
unlikely that people will always have the same learning 
style, but changes during the knowledge construction 
process, which involves the person and the environment 
they find themselves [18]. It categorizes students into 4 
classes of learning styles, which are Accommodators, 
Assimilators, Convergers, and Divergers. So the system will 
place a student within one of these four categories based on 
the response to the questionnaire. We have decided to use 
this model over others because it base on the idea that 
people learn through experience so it can accommodate the 
dynamism of their learning styles with respect to change in 
time [19]. This means in the next stage where dynamic data 
about user will be captured, Kolb’s model will still act as a 
better framework that guide the inference of students’ 
categories. 
 
During Learning Process: 
Since the learning types of Kolb’s are associated with 
experience and therefore the types of materials users would 
like to access to accomplish a learning task. We want to 
estimate their ranking preference of these materials based on 
the frequency of clicks on a particular material page link at 
this stage. The idea is based on assumption that frequency 
and duration of access are two major indicators of a user 
interest in a page [20][21]. But, we haven’t used the 
duration because in learning environment duration might not 
necessary give the clear indication of user interest on a page. 
For example, a slow learner might spend much time on page 
which he/she don't like but difficult for him/her to 
comprehend, while a faster learner can still spend much 
time on the same page because he/she likes the content 
materials. Also, the size of the page might also affect the 
duration of access. On the other hand, we think clicking 
frequency gives a clear indication of learning material 
preference. This can be seen clearly especially during 
assessments because users will always go back to revisit the 
pages of the kind of materials that better give them the 
understanding to respond to the assessments. 
So, the material types and their urls are as follows: 
Problems solving tasks (urlp), Examples (urle), Theory (urlt) 
and Exercises (urlx). Given a session a user initiates we want 
to determine the preference of Exercises material types with 
respect to other materials. To do that we take the number of 
clicks in exercises page (urlx) over the total clicks made in 
different pages material within a session as shown in (1):

               𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦!"#$ =
!"#$%&!"#$
!"##$%& !"#!$%                     (1) 
 
We are taking the assumption that the higher the 
frequency of clicks of a given url with respect to other urls 
within the session, the higher the preference of that kind of 
material. 
B. Adaptation Features 
Fragment Sorting: 
 Fragment Sorting is the technique in which educational 
resources are presented in a different order considered 
suitable for each student [19] [22]. This is one of our 
system’s adaptation features. At the “initial stage”, different 
orders of materials to each learning style the Kolb’s 
questionnaire categorizes a user will be given. The orders 
have the most suitable material at the top to the least one at 
the bottom. The font size and color of each link to the 
material is also different with top one larger and bottom one 
smaller in descending order. This will help users reduce the 
cognitive effort of deciding which material to access first 
and therefore help their navigation process. Fig. 3 shows the 
orders of materials for each student type at the initial stage. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Fragment Sorting for each learning style type. 
This order manually ranked based on Kolb’s Experiential 
Learning cycle shown in Fig. 3: 
 
 
Figure 3.  Kolb’s Experiental Learning Cycle. 
Based on the ranking order in Fig. 2,we want to estimate 
the value of importance of each material type to a student 
using reciprocal rank measure [23]. We are calling this 
importance value as Kolb’s Value (KV) and will be 
calculated using (2) below: 
 
                             𝐾𝑉 =
!
 !"#$!                                     (2) 
 
where KV refers to the Kolb’s value of a particular material 
type and ranki refers to its ranking position from the top. 
      Since our main idea of using Kolb’s model at the start, 
based on our mutual belief with Kolb that users learning 
style changes with experience and knowledge. We want to 
provide different fragment sorting each time a user session 
starts, as we believe his/her preference of learning might 
change as his/her knowledge of particular topic advances. To 
do that, we have to estimate and combine the value of 
importance of each learning material type at the “initial 
stage” which is Kolb’s value and the “learning process” 
stage, which is the previous active session of the student. The 
Equation (3) shown below is the combination of (1) and (2), 
to get the total importance of particular material type based 
on its url. 
 
                         Iurl  =KV + Frequencyurl                                    (3) 
 
The order now will be changing dynamically in each new 
session, following the higher the importance value of the 
material type. For example, If Iurlp>Iurle>Iurlt>Iurlx then the 
order 
will 
be 
Problem 
Solving 
Task⇒Examples⇒Theory⇒Exercises. 
Adaptive Link Generation 
We want to provide navigation support to a user 
especially during assessments as we believe at this moment 
is when he/she will revisit materials so as to help him/her to 
perform assessment tasks. The idea that users always jumps 
back during assessment is derived from the study conducted 
on 140,546 students participated in 4 Massive Open Online 
Courses (MOOCs) by Guo et al [24]. This study found that, 
despite 
the 
linear 
structure 
imposed 
on 
students-
chronological ordering of weeks and learning sequences-
learners predominantly navigate through MOOCs in a 
nonlinear way, on average students skip 22% of learning 
sequences entirely and perform back jumps, most often 
from assessments back to early lectures. But because for our 
case, the situation is different due to the fact that different 
material types are given for a particular topic. We want a 
user to be able to easily navigate to the particular material 
type of his preference when attempting the test. 
So after a user opens the test page and attempt all 
questions, the system then evaluates the results and 
generates a link based on the previous importance values of 
urls of different material types for a user. If the score is 
below 60%, a link to most important material type will be 
shown. Next links will continue being generated based on 
the decreasing importance value every time a user re-
attempt the exam and get below 60%, otherwise, a user will 
be allowed to continue to the next learning topic.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have presented a method to estimate and 
adapt student's’ learning style, which combines both explicit

and implicit approaches. The key idea is that our method can 
leverage the “cold start” problem faced by most data-driven 
methods, as they don't have enough data at the beginning of 
student interaction with the system. And also we think in 
learning environment it is individual actions that are most 
important, so we have used frequency of clicks information 
with the expectation that it will give more accurate inference 
about a user rather than relying on collaborative-filtering 
approaches used by different existing systems where a user 
learning style is estimated using data about similar users.  
 
In the future, we would like the system to be updated 
with more data-driven approaches. This approach will be 
more suitable as a system continues to build a “rich profile” 
of the user as he/she continue to learn while interacting with 
the system. We want to incorporate time spent on materials 
information in more efficient way by considering the size of 
pages (materials), and also consider the comparison on 
duration spent on the same size of material with respect to 
different learners’ performances. We also want to include 
more users’ data about preference of on certain types of 
system tools like chats, forum, etc. This will help to perform 
cluster analysis of different type of users and can lead to 
better recommendation of what types of users should work 
together in tasks that need collaborative work.
