Abstract—Seamless 
handover 
between 
networks 
in 
heterogeneous environment is essential to guarantee end-to-
end QoS for mobile users. A key requirement is the ability to 
select seamlessly the next best network. Currently, the 
implementation of the selection algorithm of the IEEE 802.21 
standard by National Institute of Standards and Technology 
considers only the signal strength as a parameter to select the 
best destination network. In this paper, we improve the 
implementation of the existing selection algorithm by 
proposing an integrated solution to select the best destination 
network. Our proposed solution consists of proposing a Multi 
Criteria Selection Algorithm that modifies the current 
implemented algorithm by including additional parameters 
such as available bandwidth, mobile node speed and type of 
network. This first solution is complemented with a fuzzy logic 
model, which includes a new controller entity where 
parameters such as signal strength, signal quality and available 
bandwidth of the destination networks are considered as 
inputs. The inference rules for the controller entity are derived 
from a detailed analysis made on a large number of data 
retrieved from the servers of Alfa mobile telecommunications 
company. The results, initially obtained using Network 
Simulator, show that there is a need for a new framework 
taking into account additional parameters to guide network 
selection process during handover in order to provide mobile 
users with better QoS. They were then complemented with a 
model that qualified each candidate network in the vicinity of 
the mobile based on a scale of 0 (the least advisable network) 
and 1 (the most recommended network). This will lead to the 
mobile node choosing the network that has the maximum 
likelihood estimation between a set of recommended networks.

INTRODUCTION 
Communicating from anywhere at any time is becoming 
a requirement of great importance for mobile users. 
However, the rapid expansion of wireless network 
technologies 
creates 
a 
heterogeneous 
environment. 
Nowadays, mobile users would like to acquire, directly from 
the device, different kinds of services like internet, audio 
and video conferencing, which sometimes require switching 
between different operators or network types. Moreover, 
user preferences are different. Some are interested in service 
costs only; others will be satisfied with broadband networks 
that cover large geographic areas, etc. Consequently, to 
satisfy the above requirements, user mobility should be 
covered by a set of different overlapping networks forming 
a heterogeneous environment. A mobile device should be 
able to choose, from all available networks in its 
environment, the one that meets its needs and ensures 
accordingly the transition from one cell to another in the 
same technology (horizontal handover) or between different 
types of technologies (vertical handover). During this 
handover period, the challenge is to conserve the QoS 
parameters guarantee. QoS is the capability of operators to 
provide satisfactory services for a given user in terms of 
data rates, call blocking, delay and throughput. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II describes the background. Section III describes 
the main components of IEEE 802.21 standard and its 
implementation using NS2 simulator. Section IV provides 
an overview of wireless protocols used in our simulation 
environment. Section V describes the simulation scenarios 
and results. The fuzzy logic system is described in Section 
VI. Section VII discusses the fuzzy logic handover decision 
algorithm and we conclude in Section VIII. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
In this section, we will present the MIH and Fuzzy Logic 
related works to select the destination network during 
handover. Our contributions to improve the selection of the 
destination network during handover are summarized at the 
end of this section. 
A. 
MIH Related Work 
The IEEE 802.21  [1] [2] is an emerging standard, also 
known as Media Independent Handover (MIH) that supports 
management of seamless handover between different 
networks in a heterogeneous environment. The current 
implementation of the IEEE 802.21 standard for the network 
simulator (NS-2) by National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) based on draft 3  [3] [4] considers only 
the Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a unique 
parameter to determine the best network  [5]. We argue in 
this paper that this parameter alone is not sufficient to

satisfy users’ needs. Indeed, signal strength, available 
bandwidth (ABW), traffic on the serving network and 
packet loss ratio are among the other parameters that have 
an impact on the mobile user in terms of QoS. For example, 
a bad QoS, when using a real time application in a handover 
process, may be due to a lack of ABW because of high load 
in the host network while the signal strength is good. 
Several attempts have been made to improve the 
handover within the MIH framework. Chandavarkar et al. 
 [6] proposed an algorithm for network selection based on 
the strength of the battery, the speed of the mobile, and the 
coverage radius of the network in order to avoid power loss 
during handover and to improve the efficiency of seamless 
handover. Siddiqui et al.  [7] proposed a new algorithm 
named TAILOR that uses different QoS parameters based 
on user preferences to select the destination network. Also, 
this algorithm optimizes the power consumption. 
Jiadi et al. and Ying et al.  [8] [9], modified the MIH 
where handover is performed in three steps: initiation, 
selection and execution. The proposed process aims to 
improve the handover delay by adding new events to the 
initiation step that can be generated from the application 
layer instead of lower layer upon the user’s satisfaction. 
Moreover, they added a new algorithm at the selection step 
based on price, delay, jitter, signal noise ratio (SNR) and 
available data rate within the MADM (Multi Attribute 
Decision Making) function to improve the QoS during the 
selection process. 
The research work initiated in  [10] [11] proposed a 
selection algorithm based on the willingness of users to pay 
for a given service, while Cicconetti et al.  [12] provided an 
algorithm based on three parameters: connectivity graph, 
connectivity table between nodes and the current 
geographical position of the serving network. The proposed 
algorithm reduces the handover time and the energy 
consumption of mobile node (MN) due to scanning. 
The Media Independent Information Server (MIIS) 
component (see Section III) of MIH is not fully 
implemented by NIST. Arraez et al.  [13] implement this 
service and install it on each access point (AP) allowing 
users to save the energy of the battery by just activating a 
single interface. According to the IEEE 802.21 standard, an 
MIH user communicates, through the link layer, with its 
MIHF, which sends a query to MIIS to retrieve the list of all 
networks in the vicinity. Alternatively, the authors of 
 [14] [15] developed a new method to communicate with the 
MIIS through the upper layers using Web Services. 
Moreover, 802.11 protocols  [16] define 11 channels for 
communication and force the MN during the handover to 
scan all channels looking for the active one. Khan et al.  [17] 
proposed a new algorithm based on MIIS, to provide user 
with a list of only active channels to be scanned in order to 
save time during handover. 
An et al.  [18] added two new parameters to MIH that 
allow FMIPV6 to save the steps of proxy router solicitation 
and advertisement (RtSolPr/PrRtAdv). This resulted in a 
decrease of handover latency and improvement of packet 
loss ratio. 
B. 
Fuzzy Logic Related Work 
A fuzzy logic model has been also used for handover 
solution in heterogeneous environments. Unnecessary 
handovers, when oscillating between two networks, are 
commonly known in the literature as the Ping-Pong effect. 
Kwong et al.  [19] show that the handover decision based 
only on RSSI may exhibit a drawback such as the Ping-
Pong effect. P. Dhand  [20] and Pragati et al.  [21] proposed 
respectively a Fuzzy Controller for Handoff Optimization 
(FCHO) and a fuzzy algorithm based on multiple 
parameters to minimize the unnecessary handover and 
eliminate the Ping-Pong effect. 
Several works have been done to select the best 
destination network by combining different types of 
parameters as input to a fuzzy model. Ling et al.  [22] make 
use the RSSI and the distance between the MN and the base 
station. Yan et al.  [23] use the velocity of MN and the 
ABW. Alternatively, Vasu et al.  [24] use QoS parameter 
within a multi-criteria algorithm through a fuzzy logic 
controller (FLCs) rules. Sadiq et al.  [25] propose a fuzzy 
logic based handover decision based on the RSSI of the AP 
and relative direction of the MN toward the APs. It also 
showed that using this schema, the handover latency at L2 
level is improved. Authors of  [26] use multiple parameters 
like bandwidth, SNR, traffic load and battery power to 
propose a fuzzy based vertical handover algorithm NG-
VDA between LTE and WLAN. The research initiated in 
 [27] proposed a modular fuzzy-based design for Handover 
Decision System (HDS) to deal with the large number of 
fuzzy inference rule base. Authors of  [28] use the user 
preference and network parameters as input to the fuzzy 
system. Also it introduces fuzzy logic rules at different 
phases of the handover process. While authors of  [29] 
proposed a fuzzy Q-Learning algorithm to find the optimal 
set of fuzzy rules in a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for 
traffic balancing in GSM-EDGE Radio Access Network 
(GERAN). To optimize the fuzzy logic algorithm without 
requiring an expert knowledge, Foong et al.  [30] proposed a 
newer approach using Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference 
System (ANFIS) where the training element is incorporated 
into the existing fuzzy handover algorithm. This training 
element helps in optimizing and modeling the membership 
function and the inference rules base.

Contributions 
Different research work aimed to improve the standard 
itself or the NIST implementation of the standard. In this 
paper, we present two algorithms to improve the NIST 
implementation of the MIH standard. 
The first contribution demonstrates, through simulation, 
that there is a need for additional input parameters with the 
RSSI to better select a destination network. This research 
work is complemented by a new fuzzy logic algorithm to 
better select the most appropriate destination network. 
Within our first contribution we investigate, by 
experiment, the effect of the inclusion of three parameters 
with the RSSI into the selection mechanism during 
handover. These parameters are: ABW, type of network and 
mobile speed. As far as we know, these parameters have not

been investigated at the same time before. As it will be 
detailed in Section V, our first experiment will show that by 
including the ABW, the packet loss ratio will be improved. 
The second experiment will show that based on the type 
(WIFI, WIMAX) of the current and destination network, we 
can save on packet loss. The third experiment will show that 
it is worthily significant to consider the velocity of the MN 
while selecting a new destination network. As a result, there 
is a need for a new model based on more than one input 
parameter to select the best destination network. 
Concerning our second contribution, we propose a new 
model based on a fuzzy logic system that takes three 
parameters as an input to select the best destination network. 
This solution has been explored earlier in the literature. But 
the twist here lies in the fact that an accurate choice of the 
best destination network depends also on the accuracy of the 
membership function and the inference rules base used in 
the fuzzy logic model. Our added value for this contribution 
is that we construct our inference rules base after a detailed 
observation on more than 9500 records retrieved from the 
real 
server 
of 
an 
existing 
Lebanese 
mobile 
telecommunication company (Alfa). Among these 9500 
records, we have 100 cases of vertical handover between 
GPRS network (2.5G) and UMTS (3G) network. 
Unfortunately, the LTE installation is still in progress for 
the all Lebanese Companies. After analysis of the QoS 
parameters value during handover, we conclude that the 100 
cases of handover follow a set of 18 rules. These 18 rules 
constitute our inference rule. Also the membership function 
used is based on the exact values and threshold determined 
by Alfa. The findings are anticipated to be mirrored and 
extended to WIFI-WIMAX handovers, something that was 
not possible due to the lack of available data in such 
networks. 
III. 
IEEE 802.21 STANDARD 
The IEEE 802.21 standard, also known as Media 
Independent 
Handover 
(MIH), 
provides 
mobility 
management at layer 2.5 by being inserted between layer 2 
and layer 3. As depicted in Figure 1, the Media Independent 
Handover Function (MIHF) is the main entity of the 
standard that allows communication in both directions 
between lower and upper layers through three services: 
event (MIES), command (MICS) and information (MIES) 
 [4] [31]. 
A. Media Independent Event Services, MIES 
This service detects changes in the lower layers 
(physical and link) to determine if it needs to perform 
handover. Two types of events can occur: "MIH Event" sent 
by the MIHF to the upper layers (3 +), and "Link Event" 
that spreads from the lower layers to the MIHF. 
B. Media Independent Command Services, MICS 
This service uses two types of events. The "MIH 
Commands" transmitted by the user towards the MIHF and 
"Link Commands" sent by MIHF to lower layers. 
C. Media Independent Information Services, MIIS 
The MIIS let the mobile user discover and collect 
information about features and services offered by 
neighboring networks such as network type, operator ID, 
network ID, cost, network QoS, and much more. This 
information helps in making a more efficient handover 
decision across heterogeneous networks. 
IV. 
WIFI, WIMAX, GPRS AND UMTS STANDARDS 
In this section, we describe an overview of the emerging 
wireless technologies that we have used within the handover 
scenarios to validate our contributions. 
A. 
IEEE 802.11, WIFI 
IEEE 802.11, Wireless Fidelity (WIFI)  [32], is a 
wireless local network technology designed for a private 
LAN with a small coverage area (hundreds of meters 
typically). Different versions of 802.11 communicate on 
different frequency bands with different bit rates. In all 
simulations that we performed during our research work, we 
use IEEE 802.11b version. Mobility support in conventional 
IEEE 802.11 standard is not a prior consideration and 
horizontal handover procedure does not meet the needs of 
real time traffic  [33]. WIFI’s QoS is limited in supporting 
multimedia or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) traffic 
and several research activities have been carried out in an 
attempt to overcome this limitation  [34]. 
B. 
IEEE 802.16, WIMAX 
IEEE 802.16, WIMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for 
Microwave Access), technology is for metropolitan area 
network (MAN) covering a wide area at very high speed. 
QoS in WIFI is relative to packet flow and similar to fixed 
Ethernet while WIMAX define a packet classification and a 
scheduling mechanism with four classes to guarantee QoS 
for each flow: Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), Real-Time 
Polling Service (RTPS), non-real-Time Polling Services 
(nrtPS) and Best Effort (BE). WIMAX mobile (802.16e) 
adds a fifth one called extended real-time Polling System 
(ertPS)  [35]. WIMAX supports three handover methods: 
Hard Handover (HHO), Fast Base Station Switching (FBSS) 
and Macro-Diversity Handover (MDHO). The HO process 
 [36] is composed of several phases: network topology 
advertisement, MS scanning, cell reselection, HO decision 
and initiation and network re-entry  [37] [38].

 General Packet Radio Service, GPRS 2.5G 
The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is an 
improved 
version 
of 
Global 
System 
for 
Mobile 
Telecommunications 
(GSM). 
GPRS 
was 
originally 
standardized by European Telecommunications Standards 
Institute (ETSI) and now maintained by the 3rd Generation 
Partnership Project (3GPP)  [39] [40]. GPRS Introduces two 
new elements  [41] to the existing GSM architecture: the 
serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) to control the 
communications and mobility management between the 
mobile stations (MS) and the GPRS network; and the 
Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) that acts as an 
interface between the GPRS network and external packet 
switching networks such as Internet, or GPRS networks of 
different operators  [42]. 
GPRS has several enhancements vs. GSM. (1) It 
introduces services based on packet-switching technique 
instead of the circuit-switching network. (2) It eliminates the 
monopolization of the GSM channel, reducing by that the 
communication cost and improving the transmission speed 
 [43].GPRS assign a static IP address for the user reducing 
by that the time of session establishment and access to the 
service comparatively to GSM. GPRS enables billing by 
volume  [44] (the number of exchanged packets) or based on 
the content (e.g., by image sent). Finally, GPRS introduces 
more sophisticated security mechanism than GSM  [45]. 
D. 
 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, UMTS 
UMTS is the third generation evolution of the 
GSM/GPRS systems; standardization work is done at a 
worldwide level within the 3GPP. UMTS, by integrating 
packet and circuit data transmission  [46], allows the 
interoperability with GSM and its evolution. With the use of 
the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access protocol (W-
CDMA), UMTS provide high transmission rate that can 
reach 2 Mbit/s allowing a better use of e-commerce, 
multimedia 
and 
Visio 
conference 
application 
from 
anywhere at any time. UTRAN is the great innovation of 
UMTS and is in charge of control and radio resource 
management. It enables the exchange of information 
between the mobile terminal and the core network. UTRAN 
consists of two main entities: (1) the RNS that contains one 
or more base station (Node B) and the Radio Network 
Controller (RNC), (2) the Serving GPRS Support Node 
SRNC controlling the mobility management. UMTS 
manage seamlessly two types of handover: soft and hard 
handover  [47]. 
V. 
MIH PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, we will present three scenarios to assess 
the impact of the ABW, type of network, and user velocity 
on selecting a destination network during handover. For the 
three scenarios, the decision for handover is totally taken by 
MIH. 
A. 
Simulation Environment 
To show the limits of using one parameter to select an 
access network and to motivate the need of advanced 
selection methods that combine several constraints, we 
present several simulation scenarios using NS2, v2.29, 
which support the MIH module implemented by NIST. 
The covered scenarios focus on criteria other than RSSI 
when evaluating network in the vicinity for handover. The 
first scenario investigates and assesses the impact of the 
selected network available bandwidth. The second one deals 
with the type of destination network. While the third 
scenario addresses the speed effect of the MN on QoS 
during handover. 
Various simulation parameters are summarized in Table 
I. The traffic used has a constant bit rate (CBR), which 
allows for calculating the number of packet loss. It also 
could be used to simulate voice traffic. Packet size is always 
constant to 1500 bytes and the throughput is determined by 
varying the interval of sending packet during simulation. 
B. 
Scenario I: NIST Selection Weakness 
1) Topology Description: The topology of this scenario, 
shown in Figure 2, consists of two WIFI Access Points AP1 
and AP2 (802.11b) located inside an 802.16 base station 
(BS) coverage area and one MN equipped with multiple 
interfaces. It is important to note that other streams of traffic 
source are connected to AP2 consuming its bandwidth. By 
doing that, I would simulate the connection of more than 
one mobile. Initially, the MN connected to AP1, starts 
moving to the center of the BS coverage area and on its way 
detect AP2. According to the NIST handover algorithm, that 
selects a new network based on the RSSI only, AP2 is 
considered as better network than WIMAX and the MN will 
make a handover from AP1 to AP2. Once the MN reaches 
the limit coverage area of AP2, the handover to WIMAX 
base station occurs. 
2) Scenario I Results: By increasing the throughput of 
traffic generated by the CBR application on the MN, we 
observe an overall greater number of packet losses. Figure 3 
shows the packet loss during HO. When a MN loses the 
signal on AP1 it needs to make a HO to another network, it 
has 2 choices: handover to AP2 or to WIMAX. According 
to NIST algorithm, which selects a new network based on 
the signal strength only, AP2 is selected and Figure 3 shows 
the number of Packet Loss (PL) during handover AP1-AP2. 
When the MN reaches the limit coverage area of AP2 and 
makes the handover to WIMAX. At this point, we observe 
another value of PL during HO AP2-WIMAX. 
3) Critics of the NIST algorithm: The main issue with 
this algorithm lies in the fact that it selects a destination 
network based on the signal strength received by the MN, 
which is unsatisfactory. Indeed, a MN, near to an 
overloaded base station, receives a strong signal. According 
to NIST algorithm, the MN handover to this base station 
will occur and will result in a high packet loss ratio due to a 
lack of ABW. 
C. 
Multi Criteria Selection Algorithm 
In this section, a new selection algorithm named Multi 
Criteria Selection Algorithm (MCSA) will be proposed. It is 

179
International Journal on Advances in Networks and Services, vol 6 no 3 & 4, year 2013, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/

a modified version of the algorithm proposed by NIST to 
select a destination network based on two criteria: RSSI and 
ABW of the destination network. We assume that the user 
preference is mainly composed of selecting a network with 
the largest ABW whatever the cost is within a predefined 
maximum limit. Then, we compare the number of packet 
loss during HO between MCSA and NIST algorithm. 
1) Strategy of our MCSA algorithm: A MN that is 
connected to a serving network receives beacons and Router 
Advertisement (RA) from WIFI and WIMAX networks in 
the vicinity. According to our proposed algorithm, MN will 
select the network that has the biggest ABW. In order to get 
the value of ABW to the MN, we added to the structure of 
the beacons and RA in NS2 a new field that holds the value 
of ABW. 
2) MCSA results: in order to compare MCSA and NIST 
results, we use the same topology of simulation cited in 
Figure 2. By using our proposed MCSA algorithm, which 
aims to find among the visible list of networks, the one that 
have the largest ABW, WIMAX is selected instead of AP2 
and the total number of handovers decreases resulting in 
improving the total number of PL and the Quality of Service 
is thus preserved during the mobility of the MN.

Figure 3.  Packet loss according to NIST and MCSA algorithm. 
For a user who gives more importance to the number of 
Packet Loss rather than type of network (WIFI or WIMAX), 
it is better to follow the strategy of our proposed MCSA 
algorithm that improves the packet loss ratio by 33% with 
respect to the NIST. Table II shows the improvement 
concerning the number of HO and the PL with MSCA for a 
given throughput.  
We can conclude that selecting a destination network 
using only RSS as indicator does not meet the needs of all 
users. A more accurate choice of the destination network 
during handover would consider the ABW of the considered 
network. A new framework is needed to consider the values 
of different criteria while taking a decision in order to make 
a better choice concerning the destination network during 
handover. 
In order to better understand the sequence of events that 
an MN and a network perform during a successful HO, we 
provide a short description of messages sequence chart in 
Figure 4. The dashed and non-dashed blocs represent the 
flow of handover messages according to NIST and MCSA 
algorithm. By using our MCSA algorithm, we can save all 
messages in the dashed bloc, which enables less signaling 
over the network and improves packet loss. 
A detailed description of the events sequence according 
to the implementation of the IEEE 802.21 standard by 
NIST, corresponding to our simulation scenario and taking 
into account our MCSA algorithm or not, is summarized as 
follows: 
1) MIH user on the MN sends MIH Capability 
Discovery Request to discover the link capability 
supported (events and commands) for each MAC 
on each node. 
2) MIH user on the MN sends MIH Register Request 
to register to the local and remote MIHF. 
3) MIH User on the MN sends MIH Get Status 
requesting the available network interface; it 
discovers the presence of two interfaces (WIFI and 
WIMAX) supporting events and commands 
services of MIHF. 
4) MIH user on the MN sends MIH Event Subscribe 
request to subscribe to the events on the given links 
for local and remote MIHF. This latter sends MIH 
Event Subscribe response to the MIH User of the 
MN.

5) Once the BS decides the reservation of bandwidth, 
it informs the MN of the frame structure in the 
uplink and downlink. It sends the DL-MAP/UL-
MAP to the WIMAX interface of the MN. The 
WIMAX base station is detected and generates a 
Link Up event toward the MIHF of MN. 
MIHF of the MN order the WIMAX interface of 
MN to connect to the BS. 
6) In this case, a router solicitation is sent from the 
MIPV6 module of MN to the neighbor discovery 
module of the BS. 
7) Neighbor discovery module of the BS replies by 
sending RA to the MIPV6 module of MN with the 
network prefix of WIMAX base station = 3.0.0; 
router-life time= 1800s. 
8) MN’s WIFI interface receives a beacon message 
with a power above the threshold value and 
triggers a Link Detect event; the ABW of AP1 is 
largely available (not consumed by any other 
traffic), according to both algorithm MCSA and 
NIST, AP1 is considered as a better network. 
9) MIHF of MN sends a Link Connect message to the 
WIFI interface of MN; exchanges of association 
Request/Response between MN and AP1. 
10) The WIFI interface of the MN, in its sends a Link 
Up message to the MIHF and MIH user of MN. 
11) Exchanging of RA and router solicitation between 
the MIPV6 of MN and the neighbor discovery 
module of AP1 (first WIFI access point). 
12) Starting of traffic flow between the WIFI interface 
of the MN and the correspondent node through the 
AP1 access point. 
13) Once MN reaches the limit coverage of the AP1, it 
starts receiving the beacon message coming from 
AP2. Detect the presence of a beacon power above 
the defined threshold.  
14) WIFI interface of the MN sends a Link Going 
Down and Link Down to the MIH user of MN. 
15) MIH user of MN sends a Link Scan request to the 
MIHF of MN. 
16) The WIFI interface of MN sends a probe request 
and starts scanning the 11 channels of WIFI 
interface looking for an active one. 
17) This message received by AP2, which reply by 
sending a probe response to the MIH user of MN 
through its MIHF. MIH user of MN detects the 
presence of AP2. 
According to NIST algorithm, that considers this AP as 
a better network, decides to handover to it (and continues 
with step 19). But according to MCSA algorithm, which 
evaluates the ABW of AP2 before handover to it, find its 
ABW, consumed by other traffic, very small comparatively 
to WIMAX, ignore this network and handover to WIMAX 
directly (jump to step number 20). 
18) MIH user sends to MIHF an MIH Link ConFig. 
This generates a Link Connect to the WIFI 
interface of MN (connection to AP2). 
19) MIH user sends to the MIHF a MIH Link 
Disconnect, which disconnects the connection 
between the WIFI interface of MN and AP1. 
According to NIST algorithm, we continue with 
step 21 and according to MCSA we jump to step 
28 saving by that all steps between 21 and 27. 
Thus, the signaling overhead decreases. 
20) The WIFI interface of MN sends a Link Handover 
Imminent message to the MIHF of MN. 
21) MIH user of MN sends Link Handover Complete 
to the MHIF of MN.  
22) WIFI interface of MN sends Link Up indication 
event to the MIH user of MN through his MIHF 
announcing the detection of AP2 (second WIFI 
access point). 
23) MIPV6 module of MN sends router solicitation to 
the WIFI interface of AP2, which answer by a RA 
with the new prefix (2.0.1). 
24) Starting of traffic between the WIFI interface of 
MN and correspondent node (CN) through AP2. 
25) MIH user sends the MIH Capability Discovery 
Request and response to the MAC layer of AP2 
testing if the Events and Commands events list is 
supported. 
26) The MN reaches the limit coverage of AP2, starts a 
Link Going Down event, the WIFI interface of MN 
sends a Link Scan event looking for others network 
(delaying the connection to WIMAX) do not find 
anyone else WIMAX. 
27) MN connects to WIMAX and a Link Disconnect 
event with WIFI is triggered and the traffic 
continues to the end of the simulation through 
WIMAX. 
D. 
Scenario II: Type of Network Impact 
In this scenario, we use the NIST algorithm without 
extension to show that it needs to be improved by 
considering other parameters with the signal strength. 
1) Topology Description: Figure 5 illustrates the 
topology of scenario II. During this simulation, we compare 
the delay taken by MN when it makes a HO from WIFI to 
WIMAX (Figure 5a) versus handover from WIMAX to 
WIFI (Figure 5b). Measurements are done according to the 
handover algorithm of NIST only. 
During the simulation, the MN moves from WIFI (AP1) 
toward the center of BS. Once it reaches the limit coverage 
of AP1, a “Link Going Down” trigger is fired announcing 
the need for handover. Since the only available network is 
802.16 (WIMAX), the handover is made to this network. 
We also study the same simulation when the mobile moves 
from WIMAX to WIFI.

2) Scenario II Results: Figure 6 shows a decreasing 
curve of the handover delay as a function of the traffic 
throughput generated by the MN application. Handover 
delay is the time difference between the first packet received 
on the destination network and the last packet received on 
the current served network. When we increase the 
throughput, the time between two consecutive packets is 
smaller and packets reach the destination network earlier, 
which explains the appearance of the downward curves of 
handover delay in Figure 6. It shows also that for the same 
application throughput, the handover delay depends on the 
type of destination Network (WIFI or WIMAX).  
Handover delay from WIMAX to WIFI is smaller than 
the handover delay from WIFI to WIMAX. When the MN 
connected to AP1 moves to the center of BS (Figure 5a), it 
reaches the limit coverage area of AP1 and generates a 
“Link Going Down” trigger. In this case, a scan process 
starts looking for a new network delaying the connection to 
BS (Figure 6). While for handover from WIMAX to WIFI 
network (Figure 5b), the MN does not trigger this event 
because it is still in the coverage area of WIMAX (no loss 
of WIMAX signal) and that’s why we have less handover 
time (Figure 6). 
As a conclusion of this experiment, we can say that 
based on the type of destination network, we can have 
different values of handover delay and consequently 
different value of PL. 
As shown in Figure 6, we can note that by varying the 
throughput values between 120Kbit/s and 170Kbit/s, the 
handover time (WIFI / WIMAX) varies between 275ms and 
200ms hence exceeding the maximum acceptable value of 
the QoS end-to-end delay parameter (150ms)  [48] for real 
time application. This criterion is worthy of consideration 
when selecting a new network during HO. 
E. 
Scenario III: Speed Impact 
1) Topology Description: In this scenario, shown in 
Figure 7, we study the effect of MN speed on the packet loss 
during HO. At the beginning, the MN connected to 
WIMAX, moves to the center of the BS, resulting on a 
handover to AP1 and AP2 according to NIST algorithm. 
Once the MN reaches the limit coverage of AP2, it returns 
to WIMAX network. 
2) Scenario III Results: For the three different 
experimented speeds, the packet loss on WIMAX is null 
because 802.16e WIMAX is designed to support high speed 
mobile user  [48] [49]. Once an MN starts moving toward the 
center of the BS, it detects the presence of AP1. According 
to the NIST algorithm, it makes a HO to AP1. Some PL 
occurs during this HO and the value of this PL increases 
with mobile node speed (Figure 8) because WIFI, unlike 
WIMAX, is limited in high-speed transport communications 
environment  [50]; and does not support high speed mobility. 
Indeed, for a speed of 20m/s we can see a great impact of 
Doppler Effect on the system performance  [51], which is a 
source of quality of service deterioration.

The same process happens during handover from AP1 to 
AP2 as we experienced other number of packet loss that 
increases with mobile speed. Moreover, when the MN 
handover from AP2 to WIMAX some packet loss occur 
whose number increase with mobile speed. Accordingly, we 
conclude that users who give importance to the number of 
packet loss and MN speed would prefer to stay on WIMAX 
and never stream through AP1 or AP2. Hence, we conclude 
that NIST fails to meet the requirement of mobile user 
moving at a speed higher than the pedestrian speed (1m/s). 
Thus, we argue that there is a need for a new framework that 
takes into account the user speed. 
As a conclusion of the above three experiments, we can 
say that selection algorithm provided by NIST must be 
improved by introducing more QoS parameters during 
selection. As such, a fuzzy logic system complementing the 
proposed algorithm will be introduced in the subsequent 
sections. 
VI. 
FUZZY LOGIC SYSTEM 
Fuzzy logic is the theory to deal with the multivalued 
sets and the uncertainty principle  [52]. As Figure 12 shows, 
the fuzzy logic system is composed of three processing 
units: fuzzification, fuzzy inference rules base engine and a 
defuzzification unit  [53]. A membership function gives the 
image of the value for a fuzzy set in the range 0 to 1. This 
value is called Membership Degree. During the fuzzification 
process, the crisp value of each input parameter is mapped 
into the appropriate fuzzy set using the corresponding 
membership function. The input parameters for our 
proposed model are: Received Signal Code Power measured 
in UMTS (RSCP), the signal strength on GPRS 
(RXLEVEL), the ratio of the received energy per chip 
measured on UMTS (Ec/Io), the signal quality received on 
GPRS (RXQUAL) and the ABW. A membership function 
can take different forms: triangular, trapezoidal, Gaussian 
and sigmoidal  [54]. The membership functions of the input 
parameters in our system are shown in Figure 9, Figure 10 
and Figure 11, respectively. For (Ec/Io) and RSCP the input 
values are transformed into one of the four fuzzy sets (Bad, 
Acceptable, Good and Very good) while the ABW is 
mapped into one of the three fuzzy set (Low, Medium and 
High). Due to their simplicity and computational efficiency, 
the triangular form combined with the trapezoid one is used 
for the membership functions. Moreover, this form of 
membership function has been widely used in real time 
applications  [55]. The universe of discourse of each input 
parameter is depicted in Table IV. 
Two schemas exist for the fuzzy inference rules base 
namely Sugeno  [56] and Mamdani  [57]. The former schema 
is ideal for linear technique and gives a crisp value as a 
result while the latter is a good pattern for an expert 
knowledge system in the form of IF-THEN  [58] but gives a 
symbolic value as a result. The fuzzy rule base, in our case, 
is a collection of IF-THEN rules that help to choose the best 
network in the context of QoS guarantee for a given user. 
Our fuzzy rules base is extracted from the observation done 
on more than 9500 voice data records. This data was 
retrieved from the server of an operating mobile 
telecommunications company (Alfa) after a long drive test. 
Among the 632 cases of handovers we received, 100 cases 
were for vertical handover. As the scope of our research is 
for vertical handover, we consider only these 100 cases 
between GPRS and UMTS networks. 
 After analysis, we find that these 100 cases of handover 
follow a set of rules that will constitute our fuzzy rules base 
(see Table III). Moreover, these rules were completed 
thanks to experts from the Alfa telecom company in order to 
cover all remaining handover scenarios. The fuzzy inference 
engine will be applied on the fuzzy rules base to help 
choosing the best network during handover. 
The role of the deffuzifier is to compile the output of the 
fuzzy inference engine and convert it from natural language 
to a crisp value using the centroid method. This method 
computes the gravity center of the membership function for 
a given fuzzy value. The final crisp output corresponds to a 
scoring value for each candidate network between 0 (the 
worst network) and 1 (the best network). 
For the sake of simplicity, the following abbreviations 
are used for the fuzzy sets: H for High, M for Medium, L for 
Low, B for Bad, A for Acceptable, G for Good and VG for 
Very Good. 
VII. FUZZY LOGIC HANDOVER DECISION ALGORITHM  
We consider the scenario given by Figure 13. The MN 
connected to Network 1, reaches its limit coverage area and 
needs to select the best network among the available ones in 
its vicinity. Our proposed algorithm will use the three 
parameters Ec/Io or RXQUAL, RSCP or RXLEVEL and 
ABW of the destination networks as input, see Figure 12. 
Values of the input parameters for each candidate network 
are given by Table V. The fuzzification process maps, for 
each candidate network, the three input parameters values to 
their name(s) of membership function(s) and memberships 
degree(s) in the function(s). For example, Figure 11 shows 
the memberships degree of the Ec/Io input parameter for 
Net. #2 (-11 dB) with the membership functions Good (G, 
0.25) and Acceptable (A, 0.75). Table VI shows the 
(Membership-FN, Membership-Degree) for each candidate 
network. Each triplet (EC/Io, RSCP and ABW) of input 
parameters can fire one or more rules in our base with 
different strength αi. Before calculating the crisp output 
value by defuzzification, we must calculate the firing 
strength of each rule as the minimum of the triplet input 
values (see Table VII). For each value of a handover output 
(Ho output), a numerical value between 0 and 1 is assigned. 
(Highly Recommended (HR) = 1, Recommended (R) = 0.5, 
Lowly Recommended (LR) = 0.25 and Not Recommended 
(NR) = 0). Networks with bad (B) or low (L) value for any 
input parameters are considered as not recommended. Our 
inference base looks only for recommended networks. 
Finally, the crisp value that represents the score for each 
candidate network (between 0 and 1) is given by the 
following formula  [59]:

Where αi is the firing strength for a given rule and zi is the 
numerical value assigned to the handover output value of 
each rule. The crisp scoring value for each network should 
be calculated. The network that has the nearest value to 1 is 
the most recommended one. For example, calculation of the 
crisp scoring value for Net. 2 are as follows: the input 
parameters of the second network fire rules number 1, 2, 3 
and 4 of our base with different strength. The firing strength 
of each rule is calculated as the minimum of all input 
parameter’s value for a given rule. Table VII shows only the 
fired rules with strength greater than zero. It would be 
pointless to show rules whose firing strength is null. Table 
VII shows the scoring value for each recommended network 
in the vicinity of the MN. These scores are calculated 
according to formula given in (1). For example, score of the 
Network #2 is calculated as follow:

By a simple comparison of the network scoring column

recommended one among all available networks in the 
vicinity of the MN. 
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have evaluated the effect of some 
parameters like Radio Signal Strength, available bandwidth, 
type of network (802.11 or 802.16) and mobile speed for 
choosing the best network in the vicinity. We conclude that 
choosing a network based on the Radio Signal Strength only 
is not always a good strategy. The experiments that we 
conducted using the NS2 showed that the inclusion of 
additional parameters significantly improves the packet loss 
ratio and so the QoS guarantee for mobile users. Even with 
the significant improvements that were introduced with 
MCSA algorithm, we investigated a model that is based on 
fuzzy logic to address the short-falls of our modified and 
enhanced algorithm. The new integrated system provides a 
better comprehensive solution. The limitation of the fuzzy 
logic work lies in the fact that the records were collected 
and experimented with cover 2G & 3G networks HO, so we 
have to extend these records to those of WIFI and WIMAX. 
However, our theoretical calculations prove that irrespective 
of networks type, the results should be similar to a great 
extent. It is worth mentioning that several attempts were 
made to obtain needed data from the USA, but without 
much success due to confidentiality and intellectual property 
concerns. 
In future work, we will propose a framework with a 
generic model that takes into consideration different levels 
of constraints such as network parameters with users and 
operators preferences to improve the selection of the best 
candidate network and optimize QoS parameters in terms of 
packet loss ratio, delay and jitter for real time applications. 
In addition, attempts will be made to secure data regarding 
WIFI and WIMAX handover in order to validate the fuzzy 
logic model findings and prove the prescribed assumptions 
put forward in this research work. Furthermore, the 
proposed fuzzy logic algorithm will be implemented in 
NS2. At that point, a concrete comparison will be conducted 
among MCSA, the fuzzy logic algorithm and a customized 
model based on multiple linear regression strategy that is 
under investigation to better select a destination network.
