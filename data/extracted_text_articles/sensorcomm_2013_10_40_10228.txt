Abstract— Water salinity and conductivity values are always 
required when measurements from the sea water are needed 
(e.g., for water pollution, in marine fish farms, feeding 
industry, etc.). They can be measured directly or indirectly. In 
order to select the best option, three main issues should be 
taken into account. The first one is the periodic need of 
calibration because of the system wear, the second one is the 
cost of the components of the system, which could make to 
deploy an expensive device, and the third one is the accuracy of 
the deployed system. In this paper, we propose two cheap 
conductivity sensors that do not need periodic calibration. The 
first one of them is composed by a solenoid and a commercial 
magnetic field sensor that detects the changes in the magnetic 
field when different materials are introduced in the center of 
solenoid. The second one is composed by two overlapped 
copper coils that, through one of them, are circulating energy, 
and induce in the other one. The different environments of the 
coils produce changes in the induced voltage in the second coil.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The conductivity is defined as the capability of a matter 
or medium to permit the pass of electricity through it. It is 
measured in Siemens/meter or microhoms/cm [1]. Electric 
conductivity is also defined as the natural property of each 
body which represents how ease the electrons can pass 
through it. The electrical conductivity of liquids is related 
with the presence of salts, which generates positive and 
negative ions, because they are able to carry electric energy 
through the solution. Those ions are called electrolytes or 
electrolytic conductors. The electrical conductivity depends 
on the temperature of the solution. Because the temperature 
changes, it can also change the values of the ions, solubility, 
and solution viscosity among other issues [2].  
There are different ways to measure the electrical 
conductivity of the water. The traditional one is to measure 
the conductivity or resistance offered by the water. It can 
also be measured by using diamagnetic and paramagnetic 
proprieties of the water with different concentration of salty 
ions. The paramagnetic substances increase the value of the 
magnetic field. Moreover, the diamagnetic substances drive 
down the magnetic field. Generally, each material has both 
kinds of behaviors, but predominates one of them. 
The magnetic fields are composed of electrical charges, 
which react with the environment. Those charges can attract 
or repel themselves and their behavior depends on the 
chemical or physical forces of the environment. Electric and 
magnetic charges represent different aspects of the same 
event. When there is no electric or magnetic charge, the 
electron’s loads are not agitated. When an attractive force is 
applied, the electron’s loads are agitated and begin to move 
in the direction of the applied force. In the case of water, its 
chemical composition determines the effects in the magnetic 
field. The interaction occurred between the electrical charges 
and the water molecules can cause that some atoms lose their 
electrons, those atoms are ionized or charged. As a result, 
these atoms attempt to recover the missing electrons. The 
combination of the ionized atoms and the magnetic fields 
causes the formation of an electric current in the water.  
When an electromagnetic field pass through a material or 
medium, the measurement of the changes of the 
electromagnetic field can bring information about some of its 
proprieties. In the water medium, the measurement of 
electric conductivity can bring information about water 
quality and the quantity of dissolved salts. This is important 
in many areas such as water management, agriculture, 
aquaculture or groundwater supplies. In the case of 
agriculture, it is very important to know the salinity of the 
water used in the irrigation process; because when the soil is 
irrigated with water that contains high concentration of salts 
can produce salinization of the irrigated soils in the long 
term. It is estimated that 50% of cultivated fields are 
suffering this kind of salinization [3]. In the case of 
aquaculture in fresh or sea waters, changes in salinity can 
cause the death of the cultured species, causing huge 
economic losses. Moreover, saline intrusion is causing great 
damages in the groundwater supplies, which would lead to 
obtain not drinkable waters with the time. Unpolluted fresh 
water is becoming a limiting resource in some regions, so the 
saline intrusion in the aquifers of those regions must be 
controlled to ensure the availability of the water quality. 
All these problems can be prevented and corrected using 
the proper control. Sensor networks, where sensor nodes are 
sensitive to conductivity changes, can bring an early warning 
signal, which allows applying the necessary measures to 
prevent harmful effects. In order to develop this sensor 
network, the first step is to develop a physical sensor able to 
measure the conductivity, which must be as cheap as 
possible, because, for example, to measure the environment 
of an aquaculture installation many sensors are needed. Low 
maintenance is also required for the sensors, so the contact 
between the water and the sensor should be minimized.

If we only want to detect big changes in salinity, for 
example, when an object is changed from fresh water to sea 
water, there is no needed to have high sensibility. Moreover, 
in some cases, the most important issue is to reduce the 
maintenance of the sensor as much as possible and try to 
eliminate the need for periodic calibration. The goal in these 
cases is to place the sensor during long periods of time. 
The aim of this paper is to develop two new conductivity 
sensors but with the purpose of having low manufacturing 
costs and low maintenance cost, which can be applied to 
different areas. We will create a magnetic field and make it 
pass through the water with different conductivities. It will 
allow us to detect if the changes in the magnetic field are 
correlated with the changes of the electrical conductivity. In 
order to measure the changes in the magnetic field we 
developed two different sets of assays. In the first one, we 
create a magnetic field with a solenoid and measure the 
values of that field with a commercial magnetic field sensor. 
In the second one, we use two copper coils, one of them has 
an electrical current and induces this current over the other 
coil, the measure of the voltage of the second coil gives 
information about the conductivity.  
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 
2, we review other articles developing conductivity sensors. 
In Section 3, the structure of the both sets of laboratory 
assays is described. Section 4, describes the assays made at 
laboratory to evaluate the electrical conductivity detection 
when there are changes in the magnetic field. Section 5 
shows the obtained results. In Section 6, we make a 
comparison of the prices of commercial sensors and the 
developed sensors. Finally, Section 7 presents our conclusion 
and future work. 
II. RELATED WORK 
There are some works in the related literature where the 
authors developed conductivity meters. This section presents 
a review of those works. 
In 2007, Medrano et al. [4] developed their own 
conductivity 
meter 
for 
liquids 
with 
low 
electrical 
conductivity (measuring directly the conductivity of the 
water). The minimum value that they were able to measure 
was 200pSm−1, with an error of 10%. They measure with 
different distances between both electrodes (0.5 to 2.5 mm) 
and different voltages (-10 to 10V).  
Wei at al. [5] proposed in 2010 a new seawater 
conductivity sensor (also based on the capacity of water to 
transmit the electricity), which uses a bipolar pulse to avoid 
the effect of electrode polarization. They also propose a 
temperature composition with different formulas for 3 ranges 
of temperature 1 ºC to 10 ºC, 10 ºC to 20 ºC and 20 ºC to 30 
ºC. The sensor is able to self- compensate and self-tuning. 
Ramos et al. [6] created a low cost in-situ four electrode 
conductivity cells in 2006. It is suitable to take 
measurements from estuarine waters. 
The other way to measure the conductivity through the 
alteration of the magnetic field is used only in the study of 
saline soils [7, 8]. In those works, two coils are used, the 
energy passes though one of them and a charge to the other is 
induced. The charge on the second coil depends on the 
salinity of the soil. 
As far as we know, the use of the interaction in the 
electromagnetic field has not been used to measure the water 
conductivity yet (at least in the published works). Moreover, 
there are no papers describing the process that occurs when 
an electromagnetic field passes through water with different 
electrical conductivities. However, few commercial sensors, 
that use two coils to measure the induction, exist. In this 
paper we pretend to identify the effects of different electric 
water conductivities when an electromagnetic field generated 
by a copper solenoid passes through it. 
III. STRUCTURE OF CONDUCTIVITY SENSOR 
Our purpose is to detect changes of the electromagnetic 
field and relate it with the conductivity of the water where it 
is passing through. It will let us create an electrical 
conductivity detector. In order to measure the electrical 
conductivity values, we used a commercial sensor: CM 35 + 
[a]. By using two different methods, we developed two 
different inductive conductivity sensors. 
For the first method, we prepared an assembly with a 
solenoid without core that generates the electromagnetic 
field. In the center of the solenoid, we introduced an assay 
tube, which is used as container for the water samples. 
Moreover, in the center of the solenoid (where the magnetic 
field is higher), inside the assay tube, we inserted a magnetic 
field sensor. The solenoid was powered by a Direct Current 
(DC) generator or connected to an alternative current trough 
a transformer from 220V to 12V, depending on the desired 
output measurements (in Direct Current or Alternating 
Current, AC); see the explained in Figure 1.

Figure 3. Laboratory set-up. 
 
Figure 4. Laboratory set-up with the probe inside the water. 
The whole structure was fixed using a laboratory support 
to assure that when the solenoid and the assay tube are 
removed (in order to change the solution), the position of the 
sensor respect to the solenoid is maintained. This is very 
important, because when the position of the sensor over the 
centre of the solenoid changes, vary the values of magnetic 
field. This backing system is useful only for the height and 
the vertical movement. The horizontal movement has less 
importance because the width of the assay tube, the centre of 
the solenoid and the sensor are almost the same and that 
precluded the horizontal movement. We built a second 
solenoid without the assay tube in order to avoid the 
potential interferences caused by the glass. In this solenoid 
the wire involves a plastic tube that contains the water 
samples. The sensor used in this set of assays was the Hall 
Axial Payme probe. It was connected to a Tesalameter 
Phaywe with a range of measurement from 0 to 2000mT. 
We also developed a second experiment. We used two 
cooper coils. In this case, the wire has small diameter. Those 
coils are overlapped and do not have a core. The turn relation 
is 1:36.66. In one coil we introduced AC, then, we measured 
the induced current in the other coil. The explained structure 
is show in Figure 2. 
Figure 3 shows the probe outside the water. The 
generator sends a sine signal through the coil. The coil core 
is air. The oscilloscope shows the obtained result. Figure 4 
shows the probe inside the sea water. We can see in the 
oscilloscope that different results are obtained. 
IV. LABORATORY ASSAY 
We have done two sets of analysis. The first one uses the 
solenoid and the commercial sensor. The purpose of these 
assays was to demonstrate that differences in the 
environment can produce alterations in the magnetic field. 
The second set of analysis was aimed to obtain more 
sensibility and the reduction of the cost of the sensor. 
A- First set of assays: Solenoid + Commercial sensor 
The initial assays were done connecting the solenoid to 
the DC generator. We prepared 5 solutions with different 
ntration of salts; consequently, they present different 
conductivity. The expected behaviour was to vary the 
magnetic field when we place probes with different water 
conductivity. 
In order to find the best voltage to take measurements 
and obtain the correlation between conductivity and 
magnetic field values, we prepared a scanning. We measured 
all the samples with different voltages, those voltage and 
current generated in the solenoid are shown in Table I.

Later, we measured these samples with AC at 12V. With 
the same purpose as before, now we change the frequency of 
the current in order to find the best point to perform the rest 
of measures and obtain the most accurate correlation. The 
frequencies used to take measurements were 15Hz, 150Hz, 
1500Hz and 15,000Hz. In this case, we used two solenoids, 
the first one was the same used in the DC, the solenoid with 
an assay tube inside, and the second one was the solenoid 
with the plastic tube. The purpose was to reduce the 
influence of the glass tube. 
In order to complete the first set of assays, we took 
measurements with other water samples by using the first 
solenoid at higher DC voltages.  
B- Second set of assays: Two coils  
The second set of laboratory assays was performed using 
the two overlapped coils. The first one was connected to AC 
and the second one provided an electromagnetic induction. 
The core of those coils was removed, allowing us to use the 
air or water as the coil core. Then, we took measurements in 
both environments, air and water (in this second case we 
immersed both coils in a container full of water with high 
salinity). The measurement of the induced voltage was taken 
with an oscilloscope by measuring from peak to peak the 
sine wave. 
In a first assay, we performed several changes of the 
working frequency. We observed the difference of the 
induced voltages in the second coil when the environment 
changes (air or water). The second assay was also performed 
with different frequencies, but in this case the voltage of the 
second coil was fixed to 2.8V in air. Then, we introduced 
inside a container with salty water and compare it with the 
obtained voltage after this change. The aim of this assay is to 
find the point where the change of the voltage is higher when 
we change the environment. Because this point depends on 
each coil, we made some tests to use it in future assays. 
V. RESULTS 
A- First set of assays: Solenoid + Commercial sensor 
First, we describe the results obtained in the first set of 
analysis performed with the solenoid and the commercial 
sensor. We are going to start showing the results obtained 
with AC; see Table II. We have not appreciated any 
correlation between the magnetic field and the conductivity 
of the water at 12V at any frequency. Thus this method is not 
useful with the used equipment (maybe with a sensor with 
higher sensibility we will be able to take this measure).  
We repeated the same assays with the second solenoid in 
order to know if the problems obtained in the previous test 
are caused by the influence of the glass tube. The results are 
show in Table III. In this case we have not also appreciated 
any correlation between the magnetic field and the 
conductivity of the water at 12V; but, we have seen a 
difference in the magnetic field when the environment 
changes (air or water) only at 15Hz and at 1500Hz. 
Now we present the results obtained with the assays 
when using DC. In this case, we only take measurements 
with the first solenoid because the other solenoid have less 
turns so the generated electromagnetic field is lower. We 
observed that the influence of the glass tube is not so 
important. 
First, we took measurements with 5 samples with 
different concentration of salt and different voltages (shown 
in Table I). The conductivity of the samples has 3 intervals, 1 
with the lowest conductivity, 0.002mS, other with low 
conductivity, 0.405 mS, and 3 samples with high 
conductivity 192 mS, 213 mS, and 285mS. This distribution 
allows us to see different issues. First of all, it is possible to 
distinguish between very different conductivities (low values 
and high values). Second, it allows us to know the different 
sensitivities in high conductivities or low conductivities, 
because the sensitivity is different at different ranges for 
electrical conductivity. The values of the magnetic field 
detected inside each sample are shown in Table IV. In this 
case, we did two series of measures at each voltage, to know 
the repeatability. Those measures are called Test A and Test 
B, Test A was done before and when it was finished we did 
the measures of Test B. 
We performed two tests in order to take values for 
different voltages. This showed us that the sensibility 
increases, but, at same time, it caused some problems, 
because a change in the position of the sensor in the 
magnetic field causes variations in the lecture of the value. 
At high voltage values, the error committed in a single value 
is higher than at low voltages. It is so important when taking 
measurements from different ranges.

In Figure 5, we can see the measurements obtained at 5V. 
In this case, the results show that is possible to distinguish 
between different conductivities. At low conductivity, values 
the sensitivity is higher than at high conductivity values. 
Moreover, the magnetic field increases with the conductivity. 
In Figure 6, the measures obtained at 10 V for test A are 
shown. The values are similar to the values obtained when 
measuring at 5V. It is possible to distinguish low values with 
high values, but not to distinguish between high values. At 
10 V, in one case, the magnetic field value increases with the 
conductivity (test A) and in the other case decreases (test B). 
We performed the test at 15 V two times, but both times 
yield confusing results, so they are not represented. We think 
that they may be caused by errors in the position of the 
sensor respect the magnetic field or because 15 V is not a 
good input voltage for the sensor.  
We also performed measurements at 20V. The main 
problem was that at these voltages the coil starts to heat up, 
and this heat interferes with the measures. The results are 
show at Figure 7. In this case the values decrease when the 
conductivity increases and this follows (1). It defines the 
correlation between conductivity and the variation of the 
magnetic field. 
 
Magnetic Field (mT) = -0,232 * ln(Conductivity (mS)) + 49,471  (1) 
 
At different voltages, the changes of the magnetic field 
increase or decrease. We have observed that the water 
conductivity is different because there are differences 
between high and low conductivities so we introduce 
intermediate conductivities.

B- Second set of assays: Two coils  
In the first assay, we changed the frequency and we 
observed the voltage in the induced coil in both 
environments: water and in air. The results are show in Table 
V. They are represented in Figure 8. We observed that in the 
air, voltages increase until 4 kHz. Then, it is maintained until 
7 kHz, where it starts to decrease. Otherwise, in water it 
increases until 4 kHz, where it starts to decrease. Both 
environments have the same behaviour with different peaks. 
These behaviours can be interpolated with the following (2) 
for air and (3) for water: 
 
Voltage (V) =23/(-1,071-0,01984*Frequency (kHz) )                    (2) 
R2=0,86 
Voltage (V) =653,4/Frequency (kHz)                                              (3) 
R2=0,86 
 
These results demonstrate us that it is possible to 
distinguish between salty water and air at any frequency, but 
some frequencies have higher differences.  
We need to know in which frequency the difference 
between environments in higher, and this is what we did in 
the second assay. We changed the frequency, but 
maintaining the voltage of the induced coil in air at 2.8 V. 
These results are show in Table VI and represented in Figure 
9. 
In Figure 9, we can see that depending on the frequency, 
the effect of the change of environment can have different 
sign (positive sign or negative sign). So the voltage in the 
water can increase or decrease with respect to the voltages in 
the air. The value of the voltage in the induced coil was 
allways 2,8V. The point where the sign changes is at 
248kHz. From 10kHz to 248 kHz the change of environment 
(air to water) makes to decrease the voltage. This change is 
higher at 10kHz and decreases until 248kHz where is null. 
From 248kHz the change of the environment makes to 
increase the voltage and the difference of voltage increases 
when the frequency increases. Part of this data (from 10 to 
1000kHz have a logarithmic behaviour and follow (4): 
 
      Vof induced coil(V) = 0,5133ln(Freq. (kHz)) + 0,0468        (4) 
 
The best point to take measurements will be the point 
where the values have higher differences. We can find two 
different points to take measurements, at high voltages

VI. PRICES COMPARITION  
In this section, we are going to make a comparative of 
the princes of the comertial sensors of conductivity and the 
developed sensors on this paper.  The data of the price of 
comertail sensors are founded on the different websites of 
the fabricants, shown in Table VII. Meanwile, the price of 
the proposed sensors are calculated according to the 
necessary materials and the electronic components needed to 
their assembly, shown in Table VIII and  Table IX. 
We can see that the price can vary quite a lot from one 
vendor to another. The cheapest costs around 85.00 €, while 
the most expensive costs around 615 €. 
The total price of the fisrt model (Sensor Hall + 
Solenoid) is 42.83€. By the other hand the total prince of the 
second model (Two Solenoids) is 48.19.  
The new developed sensors are nearly 50% cheapest than 
the commercial sensors.  
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
demonstrated 
that 
different 
environments (air, fresh water and salty water) can produce 
different alterations in the electromagnetic field, and these 
alterations can be measured by different methods. 
First, by using a solenoid we can measure the values of 
the electromagnetic field. But the sensibility of this sensor is 
too low and we need to increase the voltage of the solenoid 
in order to obtain enough sensibility in the sensor, this 
produces 2 problems. In the first one, the solenoid heats up 
and we need to turn off the solenoid between measures 
because this heat produces interferences (it changes the 
magnetic field that produces the solenoid). The second one 
happens because when the magnetic field increases, little 
changes in the position of the sensor and the solenoid 
produce erroneous data. 
Another way to solve the problem of low sensibility was 
measuring the electromagnetic field through the induction of 
voltage in the second coil. In this case we are able to 
distinguish air from salty water at different frequencies. We 
have observed that the best frequency to measure is at 10 
kHz. In some cases, we have been able to distinguish water 
with low conductivity from high conductivity.  
The advantages of these detection methods versus the 
traditional ones is that we do not need to put in contact the 
sensors (the two copper coils or the copper coil with the

magnetic field sensors) with the environment. So, there is no 
high degradation of the sensor along the time. This is very 
important because it means that the sensor can be left at any 
place with no maintenance. Moreover, because the sensor 
does not have any perishable part or is not consumed during 
the measurement, the lifespan of the sensor only depends on 
the energy source.  
The main problem in the first set of assays was that there 
are important changes in the electromagnetic field when the 
position of the sensor over the solenoid changes. To prevent 
this in future assays, we propose to create a fixed container 
for liquids or to make it waterproof and introduce it inside 
the water. The problem in the second set of assays is that the 
coils have to be completely isolated. Any hole can make the 
coils started to drench.  
We have several lines to research in future works. 
Although the highest sensitivity is given at high voltage, this 
range of measurement has problems. Moreover, the need of 
an energy source in the environment, where the sensor will 
be placed, makes us to continue with the assays at low 
voltages. We will also minimize the size of the coils used to 
take measurements. In order to achieve this purpose, we will 
introduce some electronic components that help us to obtain 
higher values and more sensitivity.
