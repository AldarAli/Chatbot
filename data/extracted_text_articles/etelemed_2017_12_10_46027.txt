Abstract—This paper describes the proposal of a validation 
procedure to assess the reliability of wearables systems. 
According to the two main categories of devices we have defined 
an integrated experimental protocol composed by two parts: the 
first one applies to sensorized garments or similar devices (also 
including belts or patches) while the second part is dedicated to 
body worn activity trackers like smart bracelets or smart 
watches, belt-worn devices, sensors embedded in necklace or 
other garment accessories. This protocol applied a sequence of 
real life activities and posture changes to be properly identified 
in value and in time. It has been applied to the case study of the 
sensors developed and used in the frame of the Pegaso Fit 4 
Future EU project.  This test has demonstrated the protocol 
feasibility, applicability, easy to use and easy data processing 
and its sensitivity. We are adopting this protocol as standard 
procedure in any further study regarding the reliability 
assessment of wearable devices.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the last years, a worldwide spreading category of 
devices used in sport, fitness and also healthcare are wearable 
systems [6]. Wearable devices are a popular and growing 
market for monitoring physical activity, sleep, and other 
behaviors [2]. In particular, for healthcare applications, 
activity trackers like wrist-worn systems (bracelets) or similar 
devices are now in progress, but this requires a deep and 
structured reliability analysis of their performances before 
their deployment into clinical practice. Several studies are 
ongoing [2], each using its own protocol. For this reason, and 
to methodologically have the opportunity to compare 
homogeneously these technologies, we have decided to study 
and propose a dedicated standard protocol for reliability 
assessment here described. 
The paper is divided into two sections: Section 2 highlight 
the experimental protocol underlining the difference between 
the first part (static test) and the second one (dynamic test). 
Section 2 continues with the explanation of the wearable 
sensors tested and closes with reporting the validation 
procedure and parameters. Section 3 reports the results on 
both testing procedure and the application of this on specific 
wearable device. Then Section 4 ends the paper with the 
conclusion and future development.

MATERIALS & METHODS 
A. Experimental protocol 
The experimental protocol is methodologically based onto 
a paired video and bio-signal acquisition during different 
postural tasks in controlled environment and locomotion 
(walking and running) at different velocities on treadmill 
(Woodway Inc., USA). The video is recorded by a digital 
camera with lateral acquisition of subject. The subjects 
followed a supervised protocol divided in two parts (protocol 
part I and part II), with the aim of testing the capability of the 
sensor to recognize body position changes and transitions 
from rest to activity and vice-versa (protocol part I) and to 
detect gait and speed of locomotion together with kinematic 
parameters, during activities on treadmill ranging from 
sedentary to vigorous intensity physical activity (part II).  
The experimental activity is to be conducted in controlled 
conditions during different postural tasks and locomotion on 
treadmill with simultaneous video-recording. 
A methodologically coherent subject sample, different in 
age, sex and anthropometry, has to be properly selected. 
a) Part I 
The first part of the protocol (Part I) is specifically 
dedicated to assess the capability of the systems to detect 
posture, its transitions and the related activity level through 
HR (heart rate). The first part of the protocol (Part I) consists 
of 10 postural tasks (phase from 1 to 10). More precisely, there 
is a sequence of postural transitions alternating phases of 
resting (lying, standing and sitting) and walking/running 
phases. The overall Part I protocol is described in the 
following table I. 
Contextually, the video of the experiment is recorded by a 
digital camera with lateral acquisition of the subject. 
The assessments indexes are activity recognition, posture 
recognition and computational time.  
a) Part II 
Instead, the second part of the protocol (Part II) is 
specifically designed for assessing the reliability of systems

during the progressively increase of activity level. It consists 
of 10 stages (phase from 1 to 10).

More precisely, it consisted of 120s of resting (standing 
and sitting), 150s of walking and 120s of running. The subject 
carries out the following experimental procedure on a 
treadmill: from standing to running at 9 km/m then stop and 
recovery. The overall Part II protocol is described in table II. 
Also in this case, contextually, the video of the experiment 
is recorded by a digital camera with lateral acquisition of the 
subject. The video of the subject’s trial allows for the retrieval 
of the true values of the computed parameters (activity, steps, 
cadence, etc.) along with the acquisition. 
B. Wearable system 
To apply the protocol on a specific healthcare application we 
decided to adopt the sensors developed in the EU project 
PEGASO Fit 4 Future [3]. In the PEGASO project, the sensors 
system is composed by 2 elements (Figure 1): 
• 
a sensorized t-shirt (male version) or bra (female 
version) including a pair of textile electrodes and 
mounting at the chest level a device named WES 
capable of recording and/or transmitting 1 ECG lead 
and 3D accelerations of the trunk. 
• 
an activity tracker consisting in a smart bracelet 
named WWAT and integrating a 3D accelerometer to 
monito human kinetics. The WWAT embedded 
algorithm computes the steps number, the activity 
(resting, walking, cycling, running, swimming and 
sleeping) through. Energy expenditure is estimated 
too. 
 
. 
C. Validation parameters, citeria and indexes 
According to the device differences, we have identified to 
different analyses that can be conducted on corresponding 
data. 
a) Part I and Part II, devices with ECG/Heart Rate 
measurement 
All the signals have to be processed to compute the 
following three values for each phase:  
- Activity recognition (0=N, 1=Y), 
- Posture recognition (0=N, 1=Y), 
- Computational time (0 = time > 3 sec for activity and 
posture recognition, 1 = time <= 3 sec for activity and 
posture recognition). 
The test is passed if the overall score is equal or greater 
than 90% during the complete test. 
All the signals have to be processed to compute the beat-
to-beat HR with standard algorithms. The values of HR 
recognition are 0=N and 1=Y.  METs (Metabolic Equivalent 
of Task) estimated from sensor, are compared with values 
obtained with ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) 
metabolic equations for walking/running [4]. The test is 
passed if the overall score is equal or greater than 90% during 
the whole test. 
Analysis of video-recording, is carried out through 
Advene, an open source software (Advene, Lyon, France) [5], 
providing a model and a format to share annotations about 
digital video documents, as well as tools to edit and visualize

the hyper videos generated from both the annotations and the 
audiovisual documents [7]. An example of the processing 
procedure of the video-recordings is shown in Figure 2. 
b) Part I and Part II, devices with human kinetics 
measurement only 
All the signals have to be processed to compute the 
following three values for each phase:  
- Activity recognition (0=N, 1=Y), 
- Posture recognition (0=N, 1=Y), 
- Computational time (0 if time > 3 sec for activity and 
posture recognition, 1 if time <= 3 sec for activity and 
posture recognition). 
This general test is passed if the overall score is equal or 
greater than 90% during the complete test.  
More in detail data are processed in order to verify the 
correct step identification, count and categorization according 
to the different activities and/or speed. Also in this case, the 
test is passed if the overall score is equal or greater than 90% 
during the complete test. The analysis of video-recording, 
through Advene, provides the true and reference values.  
The experimental activity was conducted in the 
Laboratory of Biomechanics "Franco Saibene" (Istituto di 
Bioimmagini e Fisiologia Molecolare del CNR, Segrate, 
Milan, Italy) in controlled conditions during different postural 
tasks and locomotion on treadmill with simultaneous video-
recording.

10 subjects took part in the Part I and Part II experiments 
for the test of the sensorized garment and the WES device. 
Their anthropometric data are reported in Table III. Three 
subjects applied the Part II of the protocol to assess its proper 
feasibility and reliability on the WWAT device (smart 
bracelet): they are the subjects no. 1, 8, and 9 in the same 
Table III.  
The study was approved by the competent Institutional 
Review Board. Subjects were properly informed about testing 
procedures, personal data treating, and aims of the research, 
and they provided informed written consent before 
participation.

RESULTS 
The results of this study can be divided into two sections: 
the first one relates to the assessment of the method itself in 
terms of its sensitivity, feasibility and robustness; the second 
set of results is about the reliability assessment of the sensors 
used in the PEGASO project.

A. Methodological results 
The protocol we designed try to answer in an integrated 
test to all the parameters a wearable device is usually designed 
for. It is robust and sensitive to raw and processed temporal, 
kinematic and cardiac data. The validation indexed and 
intuitive and easy to be computed, as well as they are 
representative of the needed accuracy assessment. 
The application case study demonstrated its good 
applicability and repeatability in a standard sample size of 10 
subjects. 
B. Results of the protocol on the reliability of the PEGASO 
Sensors system  
The WES sensors have a mean accuracy of 99%±2% in 
the first part and 93%±7% in the second part; moreover 7 
subjects on 10 had an accuracy of 100% in the detection of 
steps. These data show that WES sensors are reliable and 
accurate in their measurements, appropriately for the 
applications they are design to be used for.

CONCLUSIONS 
This study aims at setting up a standard protocol for 
wearable sensor validation before their introduction in 
research projects. This has particular relevance when clinical 
applications of wearable sensors have been carried out. The 
protocol we have defined is up-to-date with current 
technologies and their applications. The results showed both 
methodologically and for its application a good performance 
in usability and outcomes. Further application will confirm 
these findings and other developments could be done for 
specific detail of garments or activity trackers depending on 
peculiar applications.
