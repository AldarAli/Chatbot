INTRODUCTION 
The global market scale of mobile communications has 
manifested a trend of continuous while the development of 
the third-generation (3G) network evolving into Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) has accelerated its pace. The Global mobile 
Suppliers Association (GSA) report says that 300 LTE 
networks around the world have been put into commercial 
service in 107 countries up to June 2014, and forecasts 350+ 
commercially launched LTE networks by end 2014 [1]. 
Currently, South Korea’s LTE service has grown faster 
than expected. For instance, LTE penetration rate to exceed 
58% by May 2014 [2], and LTE traffic rates on the network 
is 89% in comparison with mobile communication [3].  
South Korea has assigned 390 megahertz (MHz) for 
Mobile systems so far, as shown in Table I. 330 MHz of the 
spectrum is utilized to the frequency division duplex (FDD), 
else 60 MHz to the time division duplex (TDD) as mobile 
WiMAX.

But according to the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future 
Planning (MSIP) spectrum regulatory agency in Korea, 
South Korea wireless networks carried approximately 444 
petabytes per month in 2023 [4], a greater than 26-fold 
increase in comparison with 2011. 
The growth of wireless broadband will be constrained if 
government does not make spectrum available to enable 
network expansion and technology upgrades. In the absence 
of sufficient spectrum, network providers must turn to costly 
alternatives, such as cell splitting, often with diminishing 
returns. And also the progression to 4G LTE technologies 
may require appropriately sized bands, including larger 
blocks to accommodate wider channel sizes.  
In order to meet growing demand for wireless broadband 
services, and to ensure that MSIP finalized “Mobile Gwang-
gae-to Plan 2.0” for finding and supplying 1190 MHz 
bandwidth of spectrum will be allocated for mobile 
communication like LTE in 4 phases by 2023 [4]. The term 
“Gwang-gae-to” is the most famous king name for the 
territorial expansion in Korean history and that means 
“broadband”. 110 MHz bandwidth has already secured, 
including 40 MHz bandwidth in the 700 MHz band, 30 MHz 
bandwidth in the 1.8 GHz band and 40 MHz bandwidth in 
the 2.6 GHz band. Of this total amount of 1190 MHz 
bandwidth between 700 MHz and around 6 GHz should be 
made available for mobile use within 10 years. The timeline 
in Table II illustrates a schedule of actions. This plan had to 
be modified in consideration of the accelerated increase of 
mobile traffic due to the evolution of mobile communication 
technologies, expiration of the use of existing bands and 
increasing demands for broadband spectrums.

The main purpose of this study is to find an economic 
impact on mobile broadband spectrum allocation with 
economic benefits by means of estimating service revenues 
and using an input-output analysis.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the study design issue. Section III goes into finer 
details results with respect to the contribution of Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) and job creation. Section IV 
addresses the conclusion remarks. 
II. 
STUDY DESIGN ISSUE 
A.  The past research and literature 
Both historical and international experiences have 
testified that the mobile Internet can contribute to economic 
growth. Of course, this is not just due to the need of 
production input to build networks and sell mobile phones, 
but more importantly, due to the fact that the mobile Internet 
can advance the spread of information, improve productivity 
and efficiency, and enable individuals to explore new market 
and services in the whole economy. Some of the studies 
highlighted below in this key source suggest that countries 
can accelerate economic growth and productivity by 
increasing mobile broadband Internet adoption and usage.  
Deloitte has estimated that a 10% rise in 3G penetration 
increases GDP per capita growth by 0.15 percentage points 
[5]. Plum report demonstrates that mobile services generate 
the greatest economic value of eight major applications of 
spectrum, and estimates the economic value of spectrum 
used for mobile could reach €477 billion by 2023 [6]. Other 
report estimates that the reassignment of 300 MHz of 
spectrum to mobile broadband within five years will spur 
$75 billion in new capital spending, creating more than 
300,000 jobs and $230 billion in additional GDP [7]. 
A joint research by the GSM Association (GSMA) and 
the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has also found that if 
Asia-Pacific nations were to allocate the 108 MHz spectrum 
(698 to 806 MHz) to mobile broadband, then in the period 
from 2014 to 2020, this would contribute 68.4 billion USD 
to the GDP growth in South Korea [8]. 
 
B. Loglet Analysis 
 
Many diffusion models outline the consumption styles of 
homogeneous consumers in the same population. However, a 
specific service can be divided into a few heterogeneous 
groups, showing different diffusion processes. For instance, 
the mobile service is one communication service with 
several different generation subscribers – 2G, 3G and 4G. 
According to related subscribers and service income of 
mobile communications network, we have chosen the S-
shaped analysis and prediction of complex growth processes 
as the basic formula for our forecast. In this study, the Loglet 
analysis model will be used, which provides the tool for 
analyzing the demand diffusion patterns of mobile 
broadband groups separated from the entire mobile 
communications, using the business plan of mobile service 
operators and the series of the demand-data collected so far. 
Particularly, this study aims primarily to make a mobile 
broadband-use demand diffusion patterns, which shows the 
fast growth in demand along with 4G LTE service in Korea. 
The Loglet is composed with various logistic curves. The 
solution to the logistic differential (1) is :

(1) has three parameters; the saturation point of demand κ, 
the growth time reaching a 90% saturation point from the 
10% one α, and the turning point of the logistic curve β. The 
parameter α is usually more useful than △t for the analysis 
of historical time-series data. The parameter β specifies the 
time when the curve reaches 1/2 κ, often re-labeled tm. 
The formula below illustrates the Loglet as the sum of 
logistic models. Through simple algebra, the characteristic 
duration is related to α by ln(81) /△t. The parameter β 
specifies the midpoint of the growth trajectory as tm. The 
parameter κ is the asymptotic limit that the growth curve 
approaches as like market niche or carrying capacity [9].  
The formula below in (2) illustrates the Loglet model for 
the total mobile broadband subscribers as the sum of logistic 
models. The three parameters κ, △t, and tm define the 
parameterization of the logistic model used as the basic 
building block.

C. The input-output model 
 
The input-output (I-O) model is the most commonly 
applied method for economic analysis. Its developer, 
Wassily Leontief, received the Nobel Prize for Economic 
Science in 1973 [10]. Within the I-O framework, 
transactions between industries are modelled to examine the 
quantitative relationship between the supply of industry 
inputs and the range of produced outputs.  
The I-O model requires that the economy be divided into 
sectors. Each sector produces goods or services except for 
the final sector, which only consumes goods and services. A 
production vector X  lists the output of each sector. A final 
demand vector D  lists the values of the goods and services 
demanded on other productive sectors by the final sector. 
These intermediate demands are described 
by 
the 
consumption matrix A for the economy.

The equilibrium levels of production for each sector may 
now be calculated. These equilibrium levels are the 
production levels which will just meet the intermediate

demands of each sector. If X is the desired production vector, 
X must satisfy

In (4), X represents a matrix of gross sector output, 
Arepresents a matrix of technical coefficients yielding the 
input required by one sector to produce a unit increase in a 
linked sector, and D represents a vector of final demands.  
This study used noncompetitive imports and domestic the 
latest I-O tables for 2009 distributed by Korea’s central bank, 
the Bank of Korea (BOK) to examine the inter-sector effects 
[11]. So the demand-driven model is used to investigate the 
production-inducing effect of the mobile broadband service 
sector on the economy using an exogenous specification. The 
effect is calculated solving the gross output necessary in each 
sector for a given set of final demands yields.

 represents the Leontief inverse matrix 
or input inverse matrix indicating the total effects on 
production of a unit increase in final demand with I as the 
identity matrix. In other words, Column sums of elements in 
the Leontief inverse describe how an increase in the final 
demand of a sector impacts on the production levels of all 
other sectors in the economy and is referred to as the 
backward linkage effect. Backward linkages provide a 
measure of each sectors’ relative importance as a demander 
from other upstream suppliers. 
Table Ⅲ show the final demand multipliers for the 
“mobile broadband services” industry that can be used to 
estimate the impacts of the increase of mobile service 
revenue on the domestic economy. The total impacts that are 
calculated using multiplier from this table will include the 
final-demand change, as well as the direct, indirect effects. 
This suggests that an increase of $1 in mobile broadband 
services results in an increase of $1.6864 in final Korea 
output (or GDP). Using the same hybrid approach, the 
estimated jobs multiplier for mobile broadband is 7.7007. 
That is, an increase of $1 million (almost 1 billion Won) in 
mobile broadband results in roughly 7.7 new Korea jobs. 
The increase in mobile broadband revenue may be 
broken down into the impacts on other industrial sectors in 
the national level. Therefore, this study is predicting sectoral 
linkage effects of mobile broadband services, indirect effect 
is the sum of them by using exogenous specifications for the 
mobile broadband sector in I-O tables.

RESULT OF ANALYSIS 
 
In order to clarify the feasibility and accuracy of this 
study, the hypothesis involved include a few aspects as 
follows; Firstly, we classify scenario into the circumstances 
additional spectrum by increments of 700 MHz below of 3.6 
GHz band. Secondly, spectrum amount of 60 MHz mobile 
WiMAX is excluded in the economic effect, because 
WiMAX and LTE are strictly divided into different market 
in Korea government policy. Thirdly, existing use of mobile 
communication spectrum is 330 MHz. Therefore, analyzing 
scenario allocate an additional 490 MHz to mobile 
broadband giving a total of 820 MHz.  
On the basis of related parameter estimated by the growth 
trend in the past years, we have forecasted the mobile 
broadband subscribers by using the subscribers forecast from 
the Loglet in Table Ⅳ.And LTE service revenue of mobile 
communications in the seven-year period from 2014 to 2020 
by using the mix of subscribers and year-on-year ARPU in 
Table Ⅴ. And also we have assumed that the average 
revenue per user (ARPU) growth will be 3% every step of 
large supply of frequency by appearance of innovative 
services in light of annual growth rate of GDP, after then 
applied to the ARPU decreasing pattern. 
The above scenarios, based on the input-output model, 
the economic impact of spectrum is shown in the following 
Tables Ⅵ, Ⅶ, Ⅷ. The economic effects of mobile 
broadband service will be 40 trillion Won, and job creation 
will be 182.5 thousand man-year in the year 2020. Using an 
inducement coefficient of 1.6864 and employ inducement 
coefficient 7.7007.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Spectrum has a prominent contribution to economic 
growth, albeit with significant variation from one industry to 
another. According to our analysis and estimate, with the 
continuous increase of data traffic, to satisfy the demands of 
the developing 3G and 4G mobile services, South Korea will 
experience a shortage of spectrum after 2014. Scarcity of 
spectrum resources means it needs to be used more 
efficiently. Because of legacy radio services currently 
operating on some of the candidate band, often with out of 
date technology or with an inefficient use of frequency, it is 
relatively difficult to recycle and adjust some of the 
candidate band. So, spectrum regulatory agency MSIP 
finalized “Mobile Gwang-gae-to Plan 2.0” for finding and 
supplying 1190 MHz of spectrum will be allocated for 
mobile communication in 4 phases by 2023 at the year-end 
2013.  
This study aims to find an economic impact on mobile 
broadband spectrum allocation with economic benefits by 
means of estimating service revenues and using an input-
output analysis. In order to clarify the feasibility and 
accuracy of this study, the hypothesis involved include a few 
aspects as follows; Firstly, we classify scenario into the 
circumstances additional spectrum by increments of 700 
MHz below of 3.6 GHz band. Secondly, spectrum amount of 
60 MHz mobile WiMAX is excluded in the economic effect, 
because WiMAX and LTE are strictly divided into different 
market in Korea government policy. Thirdly, existing use of 
mobile communication spectrum is 330 MHz. Therefore, 
analyzing scenario allocate an additional 490 MHz to mobile 
broadband giving a total of 820 MHz.  
Assigning additional spectrum scenario of 820 MHz into 
the mobile broadband service could yield an additional 40.0 
trillion Won for the Korean economy in the year 2020. The 
newly-added benefits will be 159.6 trillion Won and creating 
more than 182,500 jobs over 7 years. 
This paper is a pioneering study in the assessment of 
economy-wide effects of the mobile broadband service 
industries in Korea. The results provide valuable information 
to policy makers and decision makers by using I-O analysis. 
Future research needs to be undertaken to compare the 
marginal utility with increasing spectrum supply. Such a 
comparison may provide more insightful and practical results.
