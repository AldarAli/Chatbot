Abstract— This paper presents the results of an exploratory 
study concerning user acceptance and usage continuance in the 
field of interactivity enabling technologies. Participants had the 
chance to try Near Field Communication (NFC) technology in 
four different usage scenarios and thereby assuming different 
specified roles. In the course of this usage experience, 
quantitative data was collected by means of traditional 
standardized acceptance research instruments (technology 
acceptance model, unified theory of acceptance and use of 
technology and expectation disconfirmation theory) and 
qualitative data was gathered in form of user comments. The 
data was then compared using a mixed method approach in 
order to find out whether traditional instruments are 
applicable to acceptance research of interactivity enabling 
technologies such as NFC. Our results show that applying 
traditional instruments will cause a significant loss of valuable 
information and the results are of limited relevance for the 
design of specific applications. It is, therefore, concluded as the 
main output of this paper that future acceptance research in 
this field will need to include qualitative data, but, at the same 
time enable collection of huge numbers of user opinions as 
standardized quantitative methods will provide.

 INTRODUCTION 
Technology acceptance research is a crucial task in the 
development process of mobile applications. Acceptance is 
regarded as the adoption of a new technology and its further 
usage as many business models in this field are based on 
repeated usage. Specific characteristics of mobile devices 
enable their usage in highly dynamic contexts [1], which 
require dynamic methods of acceptance research. Traditional 
acceptance research might not be appropriate for this 
dynamic task as prior research did indicate shortcomings in 
the area of mobile technologies in general [2]-[4]. Many new 
applications are based on interactivity enabling technologies 
such as NFC. In the context of this research project, 
interactivity 
enabling 
technologies 
are 
defined 
as 
technologies that support or enable interaction between 
humans and objects or among humans by means of mobile 
devices. NFC is only one example of such an enabling 
technology. These technologies also require acceptance 
evaluation, but might not be assessed by traditional methods 
of acceptance research as the technology itself is not a 
perceivable characteristic of an application or service but 
acts as an enabler for it. The user might, therefore, not even 
be aware of the technology, which is the basis for the service 
or application. Nevertheless, it is inevitable to find out, 
which enabling technologies are acceptable, and which are 
not. The main research question in this paper is, therefore: 
How can acceptance and usage continuance of interactivity 
enabling technologies are assessed?  
The research questions in detail are: 
• 
Will application of traditional instruments of 
acceptance measurement provide useful information in the 
context of interactivity enabler technologies such as NFC? 
• 
Are there similarities between acceptance factors 
that are observed by means of qualitative research and those 
measured by traditional acceptance instruments? 
By addressing these questions in an exploratory study, it 
is intended to uncover potentials for future research in the 
area of interactivity enabling technologies and to gain a 
better understanding of unique characteristics of these 
technologies, which affect acceptance. In order to achieve 
this goal, user tests were conducted and several traditional 
commonly used instruments were applied as well as 
qualitative methods of data gathering in a mixed method 
setting. The comparison of the obtained results is the core 
issue of this paper. The remainder of this paper is organized 
as follows. In Section 2, the state of the art acceptance 
models are discussed together with commonly used methods 
of technology acceptance research. The methodology that 
was used for empirical testing is presented in Section 3 and 
results are provided and discussed in Section 4 followed by 
concluding remarks and an outlook on future research 
activities and questions. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
The most often used model in technology acceptance 
research is Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which 
explains acceptance by means of two key factors [5]: 
• 
Perceived ease of use  
• 
Perceived usefulness 
Almost half of all papers in the area of mobile 
technology acceptance are based on this model [6]. Prior 
research did show that application of TAM might lead to 
inconsistent results. This is why process theories are 
recommended that include experience/feedback loops [7] 
and [8]. They enable researchers to capture dynamic

processes and interaction between technological and 
organizational structures. In the original study [5] a follow 
up two weeks after initial data collection did also indicate 
significant changes of user perceptions over time. 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
(UTAUT) is a compound model that includes elements of 
TAM and seven other models [9]. Among these models are 
motivational, social cognitive and diffusion models. The 
constructs included in UTAUT are: 
• 
Performance expectancy 
• 
Effort expectancy 
• 
Attitude towards using technology 
• 
Social influence 
• 
Facilitating conditions 
• 
Self-efficacy 
• 
Anxiety 
• 
Gender, age, experience and voluntariness of use as 
moderators 
• 
Behavioral intention 
Expectation-disconfirmation theory [10] is used in the 
field of technology acceptance research in order to “move 
from traditional static IT usage models (e.g., TAM, TPB, 
TAM2) to temporal models focusing on understanding 
fluctuation patterns of IT usage.” [11]. The theory has been 
applied on TAM and data were gathered ex post [12] or as a 
two-stage research design where expectations are captured 
before usage and confirmation or disconfirmation after 
hands-on experience [13]. Three-stage designs were used to 
show that expectations will experience stabilization and 
become more consonant with experience after longer 
periods. This kind of research design includes different 
constructs in the questionnaires at three points in time (t1, t2, 
t3) [11]: 
• 
Usefulness (t1, t2, t3) 
• 
Attitude (t1, t2, t3) 
• 
Disconfirmation (t2, t3) 
• 
Satisfaction (t2, t3) 
• 
Intention (t2, t3) 
Many data collection methods for dynamic capturing of 
user behavior limit the number of possible data sets as they 
are time-consuming and laborious. This is especially true for 
shadowing where the researcher follows the user in the field 
and observes and documents the user behavior. In addition to 
a high expenditure of time it is also probable that the user is 
disturbed by the researcher in his natural environment [14]. 
A similar case is contextual field research where 
ethnographers capture user activities by means of photos and 
communication sequences and combine them with context 
information on a time line [15]. User generated content 
enables the collection of numerous user opinions that can be 
analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Most distribution 
platforms of mobile applications, e.g., Apples AppStore, 
include user generated content in form of user reviews. 
These text documents benefit from the voluntariness of their 
provision in contrast to questionnaire-based surveys, which 
limit the range of possible answers by standardization [16]. 
Another non-reactive method is behavior tracking, where 
user simulations are computed [17] in order to simulate for 
instance minimum requirements of service quality [18] or to 
document user mobility behavior [19]. Automated event 
protocols, however, disregard motives and causes of user 
behavior to a large extent. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
An exploratory approach was chosen in order to obtain 
valuable insights regarding actual user acceptance factors. 
Therefore, the study was designed according to state of the 
art methods and instruments of technology acceptance 
research and also includes further qualitative measures. 
A. Research Design 
Trialability is an important factor of technology 
acceptance measurement [20]. This is why there should be 
hands-on 
experience 
included 
in 
the 
test 
setting. 
Questionnaire-based surveys that rely on mere imagination 
of technologies, which the participant never used himself are 
not as valid as those conducted after usage experience 
though previous studies indicated that pre-prototype 
usefulness measures are able to approximate usefulness 
measures after hands-on experience quite well [21].  
There are good reasons for field studies as well as in 
favor of lab studies. In the context of emotion capturing it is 
common to prefer field studies because users should 
experience technology in normal usage situations and 
emotions may be different in artificial laboratory setups [22]. 
Especially mobility as a key characteristic of mobile 
technologies is hard to simulate in lab studies. Nevertheless 
most evaluations of mobile systems are designed as 
laboratory tests [1]. Laboratory studies are preferred in cases 
that require experimental control of unknown variables and 
they simplify data collection [1]. For evaluation of product 
characteristics lab tests are commonly regarded to be 
sufficient [23]. We decided on an experimental approach as 
NFC is not a widely used technology yet. Applications are 
rare in the field and need to be tested in a lab environment. In 
order to reduce disadvantages of lab studies and to foster 
imagination of NFC application opportunities the test setting 
was designed as role plays. Two participants were interacting 
in predefined roles that were close to reality and in that role 
experienced different interactive NFC applications.  
There were 30 participants of which 14 were male and 16 
female. The age of the participants ranged from 20 to 40 and 
was 28.03 years on average with standard deviation of 4.97. 
Concerning the general attitude regarding new technology 
the sample appeared to be rather technology affine as 
depicted in Figure 1.

attitude towards new media and technologies. 
B. Schedule 
When the participants arrived at the test site they were 
introduced to interactive technologies by the example of 
NFC. A brief description of the technology was performed as 
oral presentation by the interviewer. Immediately after this 
introduction the participants were asked to fill in the first 
questionnaire concerning their expectations regarding NFC. 
The participants were then assigned to their roles. 
In the course of the role plays, there were four tasks to 
perform: 
• 
1st task – user of social media  
Imagine you are a user of Facebook. You have a 
Facebook account and have already updated your status and 
checked in at different places before. The name of your 
account is ”Evo Laris”. Further imagine you just came to our 
company and you would like to capture your first visit of the 
TecLab (laboratory with technical equipment where user 
tests usually take place) in form of an update status and 
check in.  
Technical equipment: one NFC tag attached to a plain 
surface on the entrance door that initiates a status update and 
a check in when the NFC enabled mobile phone is within 
activation distance 
• 
2nd task – business meeting 
Imagine you are person A (fictitious name equivalent to 
John Q. Public, in the following referred to as just “person 
A”) and you meet person B (fictitious name, in the following 
referred to as just “person B”) for business related reasons. 
Person B is a potential customer of person A and you never 
met before. After settling the details of a contract you want 
to interactively exchange contact information (name, phone 
number, email address, postal address) for further 
proceeding. In order to do this you can use the mobile phone. 
Technical equipment: business cards for person A and 
person B including NFC tags that initiate the inclusion of 
contact data into the address book of the mobile phone when 
the NFC enabled mobile phone is within activation distance 
• 
3rd task – customer of a retailer for consumer 
electronics 
You just bought a flat screen TV set. The device was 
delivered at your home and you set it into operation 
successfully. Your friend person B is interested in technical 
details concerning the device and you cannot find the manual 
at the moment. As the technical key points don’t come to 
your mind immediately and the device is not self-explaining 
you want to get further information. In order to get this 
information you can use the mobile phone. 
Technical equipment: one flat screen TV set with an NFC 
tag that is attached to its surface and initiates download of 
the manual when the NFC enabled mobile phone is within 
activation distance 
• 
4th task – participant of a fair 
Imagine you participated in a congress. After you, person 
A, and your colleague, person B, entered the fair area you 
want to orientate yourselves. You want to get an overview of 
companies’ display booths and their locations. Moreover you 
want to know who is going to present which topic and when. 
In order to get this information you can use the mobile 
phone. 
Technical equipment: one NFC tag that that is attached to 
a plate with the conference name and NFC logo on it and 
initiates download of a congress program when the NFC 
enabled mobile phone is within activation distance 
The necessary equipment for all four tasks was prepared 
in the TecLab and the participants were provided with NFC 
enabled mobile phones (Samsung Nexus S). As most 
participants were not familiar with the usage of this specific 
device they received a brief instruction to the handling and 
functionalities. During the tasks the interviewer took notes 
concerning 
observational 
data 
(duration 
of 
task 
accomplishment, did the participants try to solve the 
problems together, participant reactions) and some open 
question data (difficulty of the task, suitability of NFC for 
the specific situation, comments and suggestions for 
improvement). 
Following to the tasks, the participants had to fill in the 
second questionnaire concerning their experiences with NFC 
technology.  
C. Research Instruments 
We used a mixed method approach including quantitative 
data from standardized questionnaires and qualitative data 
from user comments. Research instruments were adapted 
from traditional technology acceptance instruments. The first 
questionnaire was based on expectation disconfirmation 
theory [11] except for the construct perceived usefulness for 
which we used all the original TAM items [5]. 
The second questionnaire was based on TAM [5], 
UTAUT [9] and expectation-disconfirmation theory [11] and 
[24]. Several items of the performance expectancy scale 
were excluded because of redundancy with other scales and 
the scale for behavioral intention was also reduced as the 
different meanings of the three expressions were not 
translatable into German language. The items that were used 
are listed below: 
Perceived usefulness [5]: 
• 
All items from the original instrument. 
Perceived ease of use [5] 
• 
All items from the original instrument. 
Performance expectancy [9]:

I intend to continue using NFC rather than 
discontinue its use. 
• 
My intentions are to continue using NFC than 
use any alternative means. 
• 
If I could, I would like to discontinue my use of 
NFC. 
In addition, the time span needed for task completion was 
documented as well as spontaneous reactions of the 
participants during the scenarios. The participants also had to 
grade the appropriateness of NFC technology for the specific 
task as well as the difficulty level of task completion on a 
scale ranging from 1 – very good to 5 - poor. After filling in 
the questionnaires they were asked to comment on the used 
research instruments. 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We computed correlations among all constructs included 
in our questionnaire in order to find out, which constructs 
influence behavioral intention the most. The first step was 
the computation of mean values corresponding standard 
deviations for all constructs are listed in Table 1.

As the data were normally distributed, we applied 
Pearson product moment correlation [25] and found several 
highly significant results as listed in Table 2.  
Intention to further use NFC is significantly related to the 
participants attitude towards NFC usage at t2 (r = .80, p < 
.01) as well is satisfaction (r = .78, p < .01). Social influence, 
facilitating conditions, self-efficacy and anxiety derived from 
UTAUT did not show any significant influence on other 
constructs.  
Regarding TAM constructs perceived usefulness and 
perceived ease of use, the results are quite diverging. 
Perceived ease of use has no significant effects whereas 
perceived usefulness has highly significant effects at both 
points of measurement (t1, r = -.40, p < .05; t2, r = -.58, p < 
.01). The constructs from expectation-disconfirmation theory 
did all show at least one significant correlation with other 
constructs. Especially the construct satisfaction is in a highly 
significant correlation with attitude towards NFC usage (r = 
.86, p < .01) and the intention to further use NFC (r = .78, p 
< 
.01). 
These 
results 
indicate 
that 
expectation 
disconfirmation theory is more appropriate in the context of 
NFC acceptance than the other tested instruments as it 
provided more significant correlations among the constructs.  
Additionally, we asked the participants for reasons why 
task completion was difficult/easy for them, whether they 
consider NFC appropriate for that particular task and further 
comments. 434 text items were collected in the course of that 
and analyzed concerning their content. The two main TAM 
constructs, ease of use and usefulness, occurred rather often 
in the user comments. Usefulness was mentioned 34 times 
and ease of use was addressed even 53 times, which 
represents more than 12 % of all comments. Nevertheless 
other topics were more important to the participants. The 
ability of NFC to act as a time-saver was named in 78 
comments (18 %). Another 71 comments dealt with design 
issues such as font size, color, haptic characteristics etc. 
Other often named issues were content control concerning 
transferred data, performance, costs, compatibility with other 
technologies, fun and opportunities to automat processes. 
Moreover, the participants provided detailed information 
concerning the exact form of the different acceptance criteria 
like what exactly means easy to use to them. Other valuable 
information in the user comments were product suggestions. 
The most prominent suggestions were NFC applications for 
museums, business applications for employees of a 
company, library applications and NFC YouTube links.  
According to these results research question two is 
answered as following: There are similarities between 
acceptance factors gathered by means of traditional 
acceptance research instruments and those from qualitative 
research, but the information users provide beyond 
standardized questionnaires is further detailed and also more 
design relevant. 
These results indicated that the constructs tested in 
traditional acceptance research are important topics but often 
participants are biased because of the limited number of 
possible answers. A participant who highly agrees with a 
certain statement in a standardized questionnaire will not 
necessarily name this item as an important factor for further 
usage of the technology. Research question one can be 
answered as following: It is possible to apply traditional 
acceptance research instruments, but it will cause a loss of 
valuable information and neglects important acceptance 
factors. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Generalizability of our results is of course limited due to 
the relatively low number of participants, which was caused 
by the requirements of qualitative research but nevertheless 
our results indicate that traditional methods of technology 
acceptance research only show limited ability to capture 
participants’ opinions concerning interactivity enabling 
technologies such as NFC. Acceptance of NFC seems to be a 
very 
dynamic 
issue 
and 
therefore 
expectation-
disconfirmation theory provided the best results due to its 
dynamic (two-step) data gathering process. Standardized 
questionnaires 
are 
extremely 
useful 
instruments 
for 
technology acceptance research as they enable collection of 
numerous user opinions, but at the same time they hamper 
detection of really valuable information, which is uncovered 
by means of qualitative data gathering such as interviews or 
thinking aloud.  
The challenge for the future will be a combination of 
both approaches, which enables exploration of many user 
opinions concerning their actual thoughts not limited to a 
small number of possible constructs. We, therefore, believe 
that it will be necessary to foster methods of automated text 
analysis in the field of technology acceptance research as 
users are providing us with an incredible amount of textual 
information concerning their experiences with technology in 
form of user generated content publicly available on the 
internet.  
First attempts to apply this kind of data gathering 
methods on technology acceptance problems [16] did show 
that automated text analysis can be a very useful instrument 
and also provides in-depth insights into users actual opinions 
concerning technologies. Our next steps, therefore, are the 
further development of an automated text analysis 
framework in the context of technology acceptance research 
as well as a comparative analysis of methods available in the 
area of technology acceptance research in order to find out 
which are most appropriate for interactive technologies.
