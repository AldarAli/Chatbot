Abstract—With the rapidly growing deployment of high 
performance mobile terminals, such as smart phones, 
multitasking becomes one of the popular uses of mobile 
services. As the user behaviors become more diverse, a service 
control based on user's behavior would be required. In general, 
users do not always pay attention to all services in terms of the 
progress of those services while multitasking. Thus, service 
control can be expected to maintain user satisfaction with the 
service at high levels by allocating computer and network 
resources to the specific service to which the user’s attention is 
directed. This paper proposes a service control system based 
on the behavioral characteristics of users while multitasking. 
As an initial study for establishing a service control system, we 
first investigated the behavioral characteristics of users while 
multitasking 
through 
a 
subjective 
assessment 
of 
400 
participants. Furthermore, we verified the proposed system for 
the effect on traffic reduction by numerical simulations with 
the behavioral data and confirmed the effectiveness of the 
proposed system. The main contribution of this paper is that 
we clarified that the service control system based on behavioral 
characteristics would be useful in constructing a cost-effective 
network.

 INTRODUCTION 
Thanks to the rapid growth of mobile Internet services, 
we enjoy a variety of services everywhere whenever we want. 
Mobile services would be expected to expand continuously 
by diversifying according to user demand and behavior [1]. 
For telecommunication carriers and service providers, 
providing mobile services that ensure user satisfaction is one 
of the most crucial issues. User satisfaction with a service is 
called Quality of Experience (QoE). The term QoE is 
defined in ITU-T as follows [2]:  
Quality of Experience (QoE): The overall acceptability of 
an application or service, as perceived subjectively by the 
end-user. 
Notes 
1) Quality of experience includes the complete end-to-
end system effects (client, terminal, network, services 
infrastructure, etc.). 
2) Overall acceptability may be influenced by user 
expectations and context. 
 
The QoE assessment for the mobile communication 
service has been developed in the audiovisual research field, 
such as telephone speech and video. ITU-T P.800 [3] and 
ITU-R BT.500 [4] are representative. Recently, the QoE 
assessment for such interactive services as Web browsing 
and e-mail has been studied. Although many factors, such as 
reliability of the service and ease of use, can be expected to 
affect the QoE for interactive services, the most dominant 
factor was reportedly speed [5]. Traditionally, the so-called 
8-second rule [6] was used as the index for Web site 
planning. ITU-T G.1030 [7] or other assessments [8] are 
currently recommended to determine the appropriate index. 
Based on the idea that subjective assessments with a method 
having high-ecological validity are important, the authors 
proposed an assessment method to assess the QoE under the 
actual context of use by using Web scripts [9]. 
Meanwhile, with the rapidly growing deployment of high 
performance mobile terminals, such as smartphones, 
multitasking becomes one of the popular uses of mobile 
services. Although the amount of traffic can be expected to 
continuously increase, in the mobile communication 
environment, the computational resources of mobile 
terminals and network resources are strictly restricted. 
Increasing network capacity to cope with huge volumes of 
traffic is not desirable because of the cost. Therefore, the 
available resources should be used effectively to maintain 
user satisfaction with services at high-level by implementing 
some sort of resource allocation and service control. In order 
to construct such a cost-effective network, we propose a 
service 
control 
system 
based 
on 
the 
behavioral 
characteristics of users while multitasking. In general, users 
do not always pay close attention to all services in terms of 
the progress of those services during multitasking. Thus, the 
behavioral data of users while multitasking would be useful 
information in the implementation of some sort of service 
control. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed 
system by numerical simulation using behavioral data 
obtained by subjective assessments with 400 participants.  
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, resource 
allocation 
methods to improve service quality are 
summarized. In Section III, we propose a service control 
system based on behavioral characteristics of users while 
multitasking. In Section IV, the field evaluation results 
regarding user satisfaction with services and the behavioral 
characteristics while multitasking are given. We also verify 
the effectiveness of the proposed system through a numerical

simulation of bandwidth use based on the behavioral data 
obtained by the subjective assessment.

RELATED WORK 
Here we briefly explain the conventional methods to 
improve service quality. As described previously, allocating 
limited resources is one of the most vital factors in the 
mobile environment. The basic approach is to allocate 
resources in order to maximize some sort of function. 
Utility-based resource allocation methods have been 
widely studied [10]-[12]. The purpose of the utility-based 
approach is to maximize total utility defined by the utility 
function. Thus if the utility function is used that consists of 
metrics that reflect the user’s perception for a certain service, 
then the function can be expected to maximize the QoE for 
the service. However, since the user’s perception of a certain 
service can be affected by his/her circumstances and the 
context of use [13], it is difficult to allocate the resources, so 
as to maximize the QoE. 
Context-aware resource allocation has received much 
attention recently [14]-[16]. Proebster et al. proposed a 
context-aware resource allocation method to improve the 
QoS of heterogeneous traffic [16]. By using context 
information collected from user terminals, the base station 
scheduler can allocate the available resources to each user 
more efficiently than previous methods. For example, this 
method focuses on the foreground/background state of the 
service/application generating the traffic and allocates more 
resources 
to 
the 
service 
in 
the 
foreground. 
The 
foreground/background state for a certain service was 
previously determined using this method, e.g., web browsing 
is the foreground and file downloading is the background. 
However, in a multitasking environment, a certain 
service/application can be used as the foreground sometimes 
and 
as 
the 
background 
at 
other 
times. 
The 
foreground/background state and the context of use for a 
service/application can vary from time to time and the timing 
of the change is different for each user. Therefore, we need 
resource allocation or a service control method that can 
handle the variations of the context of use for a certain 
service immediately. 
 
III. 
SERVICE CONTROL SYSTEM BASED ON BEHAVIORAL 
CHARACTERISTICS OF USERS MULTITASKING 
We propose a service control system based on behavioral 
characteristics of users while multitasking. In a multitasking 
environment, although users can run a variety of services and 
applications simultaneously, they do not always focus their 
attention on every service and application. User satisfaction 
with a service fluctuates depending on the style and context 
of use. In a multitasking environment, the service can be 
enjoyed as either the foreground (FG) task or the background 
(BG) task. When a certain service is enjoyed as a BG task, 
the focus of the user’s attention would be relatively low 
compared with when the service is enjoyed as a FG task. 
Therefore, the user can be expected to accept the given 
service quality for the BG task even when the quality is not 
very high. If we can control the network and server resources 
appropriately based on the behavioral characteristics as long 
as the information about the application type and the context 
of use collected from each user, the service control method 
can be expected to retain user satisfaction as a high level. For 
example, suppose a large number of users enjoy a certain 
service. Their styles of use would be different; some users 
use the service as a FG task and others use the service as BG 
tasks. In this case, if the service quality for the user of the 
service as a BG task was degraded by implementing some 
sort of service control, the user satisfaction for the service 
may not deteriorate. 
In order to establish such a service control method based 
on the behavioral characteristics of users, one possible 
system configuration is shown in Figure 1. Each user 
terminal monitors the context of use regarding the 
application running on the terminal and behavioral data of 
the user and sends the monitoring results to the service 
control server (SCS) at the appropriate time. The SCS 
determines the service control policy based on the collected 
information regarding each user terminal and sends the 
determined service control policy to the user terminals, the 
intermediate nodes, and the Web servers depending on the 
policy. The user terminal can control the computational 
resource allocation with each task. The intermediate node 
and the Web server can implement priority control and 
traffic shaping, e.g., changing the bandwidth allocation. 
In addition to the above service control method that 
implements traffic control on the user terminals and 
intermediate nodes, it is possible to implement the QoE 
improvement method that provides an appropriate time filler 
for the user [17]. The typical time fillers are a loading bar, a 
progress bar, and other short movies. These prearranged 
fillers can be stored on the terminals by default, and the 
terminal then displays them during the waiting process. 
Additionally, more flexible news, trivia, and advertisements 
can also be utilized as time fillers. In [17], we confirmed that 
the time filler has a significant effect on the decrease in 
dissatisfaction while waiting, though it is strongly influenced 
by context.

IV. 
EXPERIMENTS 
In order to establish the proposed service control system, 
we first have to clarify the behavioral characteristics during 
multitasking and user satisfaction with the service in both 
cases where the service is running as a FG task and a BG 
task. Here we conducted the subjective assessment of mobile 
services by using the high ecological field evaluation method 
proposed in [9]. 
A. Field evaluation system 
The overview of the proposed Web script-based method 
is depicted in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, our proposed 
method is extremely simple, since only a subjective 
assessment server (SAS) is required to construct the system. 
The SAS plays two roles: distributing a program for artificial 
context (PAC) written in a Web script such as FlashLite and 
receiving the answers from participants. In our proposed 
method, the participant’s own mobile terminal can be used 
without any modification, since most commercial mobile 
terminals support Web scripts by default. Thus, a large-scale 
subjective assessment can be conducted easily in the field 
with little effort, since the test organizer needs to prepare 
neither customized terminals, nor elaborate network systems. 
A general sequence flow for conducting the subjective 
assessment using this method is as follows. The participant 
first sends a request to the SAS via the Internet. Then, as a 
response, the SAS distributes the PAC to the mobile terminal. 
Second, the participant conducts the field evaluation using 
the PAC. As described later, since the PAC can be run 
without 
an 
actual 
communication 
environment, 
the 
participant can conduct the field evaluation anywhere. 
Finally, the participant sends the results to the SAS via the 
Internet. Once the participants have obtained the PAC, all 
necessary procedures can be accomplished according to the 
instructions for the PAC. 
 
Figure 2. Sequence flow for conducting the subjective assessment. 
B. Behavioral characteristics on multitasking 
We conducted a subjective assessment to evaluate user 
satisfaction with the waiting time while content is 
downloading using smartphones. In this test, participants 
used their own smartphones and assessed the waiting time 
during downloading with a five-grade rating score. The PAC 
utilized in this test is an application for an Android terminal 
and shown in Figure 3. The PAC emulates the tabbed 
browser. Here we assume the situation where the user is Web 
browsing in tab A while downloading a video file in tab B. 
Although tab A is the foreground task and tab B is the 
background task at first, the participants can switch the 
FG/BG task freely by touching the tab. Note that the 
download speed is not changed regardless of whether the tab 
B is a foreground or background task. The time when the 
participant switched the FG/BG task is logged with the PAC 
as data representing user behavior. 
By touching the start button of Picture #1 in Figure 3, the 
displayed picture immediately changes into Picture #2, 
which shows the Web browsing in tab A and the 
downloading in tab B. After a predetermined waiting time, 
Picture #2 changes into Picture #3 and reporting that 
downloading has finished; note that even when the 
downloading has finished, tab B does not automatically 
become the foreground. Thus, the participant makes tab B 
the foreground task by touching tab B and goes ahead with 
the assessment by touching the Next button in Picture #4. In 
Picture #5 of Figure 3, the participant evaluates the waiting 
time with a five-grade rating score.  
The experimental conditions are shown in Table I. As 
shown in Table I, in tab A, trivia consisting of about 150 
words or a senryu consisting of 17 words are shown; note 
that the senryu is a traditional form of Japanese poetry with a 
5-7-5 syllable structure. Although there are individual 
differences, it needs about 12 seconds and 2 seconds to read 
through the trivia and the senryu, respectively. In conditions 
1 and 3, the progress bar that represents the progress of the 
download is shown in tab B. The user interface design for 
each condition is shown Figure 4. In each condition, the 
participant assesses 5 patterns of waiting time. We recruited 
a total of 400 participants consisting of 224 males and 176 
females; note that all participants conducted the subjective 
assessment using their own smartphones. 
The subjective assessment results are shown in Figure 5. 
As seen in Figure 5, user satisfaction with the waiting time is 
different depending on the conditions. We tested the 
differences between the conditions by applying two-way 
ANOVA with two independent variables: waiting time and 
conditions. Accordingly, it was found that the main effect of 
condition was significant at the 1% level. By comparing 
conditions 1 and 2 and conditions 3 and 4, we can see that by 
representing the progress bar, user satisfaction with the 
waiting time improved. For both conditions 1 and 2, user 
satisfaction with waiting time improved compared with 
condition 5, while in conditions 3 and 4, user satisfaction 
deteriorated. In conditions 1 and 2, user attention was 
focused on reading the trivia, and they were not aware they 
were waiting for the download to finish. Consequently, user 
satisfaction did not deteriorate. 
Next, the number of times the FG/BG task switched 
during one given condition is shown in Figure 6; the number 
of switches was calculated as the average of all participants. 
As it can be seen from Figure 6, the participants tended to 
switch FG/BG task more frequently when the progress bar 
was not shown in tab B. We performed the two-way 
ANOVA with two independent variables, waiting time and 
24

condition, then it was found that both the main effects of 
waiting time and condition were significant at the 1% level. 
Next, we classified the participants into two groups per 
each condition. The participants who switched FG/BG task 
at least one time during each condition were classified into 
the first group. The other participants were classified into the 
second group. Figure 7 shows the user satisfaction of each 
group. Note that in conditions 1 and 3, since the number of 
participants who switched FG/BG task at least one time 
during the given condition was few, we did not analyze per 
each group any more. As can be seen from Figure 7, the 
participants who frequently switched FG/BG task tended to 
be dissatisfied with the waiting time. 
Consequently, the users who used the service as a BG 
task were not dissatisfied with the service even though the 
service quality was degraded. Therefore, it can be expected 
that the service control system would work well if we used 
the behavioral data of the user appropriately.

C. Numerical simulation 
Here we verify the effectiveness of the proposed service 
control system by a numerical simulation based on the 
behavioral data obtained from the subjective assessment in 
the previous subsection. We simulated how much traffic 
could be reduced by using the proposed system. In this 
simulation, we assumed that about a thousand users browsed 
the Web while downloading a certain content file. The 
experimental conditions are shown in Table II. As shown in 
Table II, we set the content file size to 1.0 MB. As seen in 
Figure 5, if we adopt the waiting time when the reference 
value of MOS is set to 3.0, the acceptable waiting time for 
condition 1 is about 20 seconds and that for condition 5 is 
about 10 seconds. Therefore, we assumed that the acceptable 
waiting time when the user uses the service as a FG task was 
10 seconds and that for the BG task was 20 seconds. This 
meant that the required throughput was 800 kbps when the 
content file download was performed as a FG task, while the 
required throughput was 400 kbps when the download is a 
BG task. 
As described in the previous subsection, we obtained the 
behavioral data regarding the FG/BG switching timing of 
400 participants. By using the behavioral data of condition 1 
in the subjective assessment, we generated a traffic 
generation pattern for each user as shown in Figure 8. For 
example, since user #1 downloaded the file as a BG task to 
the last, it followed that user #1 required throughput of 400 
kbps to the last. Since some users, such as the users #2 and 
#3, downloaded the content as a FG task occasionally, it 
followed that they required throughput of 800 kbps 
occasionally. Note that we did not care that there were 
identical traffic generation pattern among the 400 patterns. 
Here we use the 3 different access patterns shown in 
Figure 9; access patterns (a), (b), and (c) follow a normal 
distribution in which the mean and standard deviation are 20 
and 7 seconds, 20 and 5 seconds, and 20 and 2 seconds, 
respectively. The number of total users in each access pattern 
is 974, 979, and 991, respectively. In each access pattern, we 
randomly selected one participant among 400 participants 
and generated the traffic pattern for the selected participant 
shown in Figure 8. 
Figure 10 shows the simulation results regarding the 
required bandwidth. As can be seen from Figure 10, the 
required bandwidth can be reduced by using the proposed 
system. The reduction rate for access pattern (c) is larger 
than that for access pattern (a). Thus, the proposed service 
control system worked well because access timing was more 
concentrated in short period of time. User satisfaction with 
the service would improve if we allocated redundant 
bandwidth to the user who needed more bandwidth.

This paper presented a service control system based on 
behavioral characteristics of users while multitasking. As an 
initial study toward establishing the service control system, 
we first assessed user satisfaction with waiting time when

participants. As a result, users tended to accept relatively 
long waiting times when they used a certain service as a 
background task. 
Next, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed 
service control system using a numerical simulation based on 
behavioral data obtained from the subjective assessment. 
Consequently, the more the access timing was concentrated 
within a short period of time, the greater the effect on traffic 
reduction.
