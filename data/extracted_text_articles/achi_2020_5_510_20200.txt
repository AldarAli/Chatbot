Abstract—This study aims to evaluate the factors affecting
motion sickness in the Augmented Reality (AR) environment.
Motion sickness is due to a difference between actual and
expected motion. When people use Virtual Reality (VR), they
experience
symptoms
of
motion
sickness
due
to
the
inconsistency in vision and body movements. To measure the
motion
sickness,
a
VR
Sickness
Questionnaire
(VRSQ)
measurement index is used. The experiment was conducted
with the following settings. The study group consisted of 12
female and 12 male participants with no health problems. They
performed the task of repeatedly selecting specific buttons. It
consisted of a total of 240 button selections (12 treatment (two
methods of selection × two button sizes × three distances) × 4
choices × 5 sets = 240 tasks). The Latin Square design was used
to minimize the effect of order. Then, a questionnaire was
conducted
after
each
treatment.
ANOVA
(ANalysis
Of
VAriance) was performed to check if there were differences in
Oculomotor, Disorientation, and VRSQ total score. There was
a significant difference in selection method and distance of
VRSQ Oculomotor. It is recommended to use physical buttons
and to have a distance of 100 cm from the target to reduce the
motion sickness in AR environment.

INTRODUCTION
Over
the
past
decades,
Augmented
Reality
(AR)
technology is developed and used in many fields. AR allows
the user to
see the real world, with virtual objects
superimposed upon or composited with the real world [1].
There are many cases of motion sickness in Virtual Reality
(VR) environment. There are many kinds of factors that
cause motion sickness. Studies show that motion sickness
varies depending on age. Older participants had a greater
likelihood of simulator sickness than younger participants
[2][6]. It is also related to the amount of time exposed to VR
environments. VR sickness is also affected by visual
stimulation locomotion and exposure times [6]. The longer
the exposure time, the more pronounced the motion sickness
symptoms [3].
However, there are not many studies dealing with motion
sickness in AR environments. As a method to measure the
degree
of
motion
sickness
of
AR,
a
VR
Sickness
Questionnaire (VRSQ), which was developed according to
the VR environment, is utilized. The goal of this study is to
check the factors affecting motion sickness in the AR
environment.
Section II introduces VRSQ measurement, Section III
introduces how the user test was conducted, Section IV
explains the limitation of the study, and Section V concludes
this paper.

VRSQ
A typical tool for measuring motion sickness in a cyber
simulator is SSQ (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire). SSQ
includes 16 symptoms that are divided into three components
[4]. In this study, VRSQ tools were selected to measure
motion sickness in the AR environment. VRSQ is a motion
sickness measurement specialized for VR environments [5].
VRSQ consists of nine symptoms (General discomfort,
Fatigue, Eyestrain, Difficulty focusing, Headache, Fullness
of head, Blurred vision, Dizzy (eyes closed), Vertigo), which
are divided into two factors (Oculomotor, Disorientation)
(Table 1). In this study, one index was used per nine
symptoms. VRSQ scores can be calculated using the
following formula (Table 2).

CASE STUDY
A.
Experimental design
1)
Participants
The study group consisted of 12 female and 12 male
participants with a corrected vision of 0.6 or higher, with no
physical or visual health problems (average age: 21.2 years
old, standard deviation: 1.26 years old). Since there may be
differences between genders, 12 female and 12 male were
chosen in consideration of gender balance. The participants
were all Korean and had no experience in using AR devices.
We recruited the university students who are thought to be
interested in AR devices. There were 11 people who had
experience using VR devices. Twenty-two of them were
right-handed
and
two
were
left-handed. All
of them
conducted the experiment with their own hands.
2)
Apparatus
The AR environment was configured using Microsoft
Hololens (1st generation) developer edition. Its Holographic
resolution 2HD 16:9 light engines producing 2.3M total light
points. There are two ways to perform a task (Figure 1). The
first thing is to use finger gestures. 1) Gaze at the hologram
which want to select. 2) Point the index finger straight up
toward the ceiling. 3) Air tap: lower the finger, quickly raise
it. The second is to use a clicker. To select a hologram,
button, or other element, gaze at it, then click.
Figure 1.

Tasks
After wearing the Hololens HMD, finger gestures and
clickers were used to perform the task of repeatedly selecting
specific buttons. Nine buttons are marked in an array of 3×3.
Buttons consist of two sizes and three distances (Table 3).
TABLE III.
SETTINGS OF BUTTONS
The small button was set to a 1°55'4" field of view based
on the length of the large side of the mobile phone's 3×4
keyboard. The large button is set to twice the size of the
small button and its field of view is 3°49'48" (Figure 2).

Procedure
Participants were asked to perform tasks consisting of
two selection methods (finger gestures, clickers), two button
sizes, and three distances (60 cm, 80 cm, 100 cm) and
respond to SSQ. The manufactured application was run
through Hololens. The experiment lasted about 90 minutes,
including break time.
First, the purpose and contents of the experiment were
introduced. They were also explained that if participants feel
severe motion sickness, they can rest and stop at any time.
And It is evaluating the device, not the ability of the
participants. Before starting the experiment, the subjects had
a chance to practice until they got used to the device (Figure
3).
Second, participants performed a task consisting of 12
treatments (two methods of selection × two button sizes ×
three distances = 12 treatments). Each treatment consisted of
five sets and one set was to select four randomly highlighted
buttons. Thus, it consisted of a total of 240 button selections
(12 treatment × 4 choices × 5 sets = 240 tasks). The Latin
Square design was used to minimize the effect of order.
Finally,
a
questionnaire
was
conducted
after
each
treatment. Motion sickness levels were assessed through the
difficulty level and SSQ of performing the task. The score
was based on a five-point recurve scale (1 = not at all, 2 =
slightly, 3 = normal, 4 = moderately, 5 = very).

ANOVA with VRSQ
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to check
if there were differences in Oculomotor, Disorientation, and
VRSQ total score depending on the method of selection, the
size of the buttons, and the distance. As a result of the
analysis of variance, items with a P value of 0.05 or less
were analyzed Tukey post-analysis (Table 4).

In addition, the P value of Distance was 0.0157(p<0.05)
and there was a significant difference between 60 cm and
100 cm (Figure 5). The VRSQ Oculomotor score of distance
60 cm is 76.22, and the score of 100 cm is 65.02. There were
no significant differences in the disorientation score and
VRSQ total score according to the selection methods, button
sizes, and distances.
IV.
DISCUSSION
As a result of the data analysis, two methods of selecting
buttons indicated significant differences.
There was a study that measured motion sickness in two
ways to select a target: direct selection to select a target with
physical buttons and automatic target selection to stare and
select for a certain period of time [5]. In this study, both SSQ
and VRSQ scores for the choice method using physical
buttons were significantly lower. The study also showed that
the physical button, the clipper method, had a low motion
sickness score.
There was a significant difference between 60 cm and
100 cm in the distance between the target and the subject.
The 60 cm VRSQ Oculomotor score was 76.22 and the 100
cm score was 65.02 points. The button at a distance of 100
cm caused less motion sickness. Therefore, when producing
contents of AR environment, it is recommended to use
physical buttons and to have a distance of 100 cm from the
target.
In the case of finger gesture, the finger must be within the
camera radius to be recognized. So, the experiment was
carried out with the arms stretched forward, and the fingers
were in the field of view. Depending on the movement of the
eyes, the hands had to move together and the subjects had to
pay attention to it. However, the clicker was connected by
Bluetooth, so it could be operated comfortably without
raising its arms. Due to these differences, eye movements
would have varied depending on how buttons were selected,
so the degree of motion sickness must have been different.
The experiment was carried out standing in place, facing
one direction. Although the position of the buttons changed
slightly depending on the view, body movements were

generally not required. This may have affected directional
loss scores.
This study did not identify differences in the effects of
motion sickness by gender. Gender differences need to be
checked in further studies.
V.
CONCLUSION
SSQ uses a 4-point Likert scale (0=not at all, 1=slightly,
2=moderately, and 3=very). However, in this study, there
were limitations in converting to scores using 1-5 scales.
Because the numbers on the scales were different, it was
difficult to apply the SSQ calculation method.

all
populations.
Furthermore, the age of 24 participants was early 20s. So, it
could not confirm previous research that there was a
difference in the degree of motion sickness depending on
age. It is necessary to recruit subjects of various ages for
further research.
The task of selecting buttons in an AR environment was
carried out and the motion sickness was measured using the
VRSQ tool. Twenty-four participants carried out a task
consisting of nine buttons, two button selection methods, two
button sizes and three distances. VRSQ, which has increased
efficiency in VR environment compared to the previous
SSQ, is utilized.
This study revealed that Oculomotor among motion
sicknesses in AR environment is related to the method and
distance of button selection. To provide better usability,
motion sickness in the AR environment needs to be
improved. This study can suggest the possible user interface
element of AR environment to reduce motion sickness.
