Abstract—The rapid development and maturity of Electronic
Business has stimulated the adoption of Internet Banking in
both the developed and developing economies. This adoption is
no doubt a result of not just based on the maturity of the
Internet, but its ubiquitous nature. As of 2005, about 73% of
households have active Internet connection in the UK. At the
same time this huge adoption has raised many social and
economic issues that should be addressed. This paper presents
an investigation into the behavior of elderly people (age
segment 55-65) towards Internet banking in the UK. The
research constructs were developed based on the 'Decomposed
Theory
of
Planned
Behavior'
towards
providing
an
understanding of the level of motivations, social influence,
perceived usefulness and ease of use for the defined age
segment in the UK. Analyzed research output has identified a
number of issues that should be addressed in order to increase
the involvement of a potential sub-segment of elderly people in
e-commerce activities.

INTRODUCTION
Technology has changed the whole pattern of life and it is
still refining the way we live and do things. Besides its
brighter features such as the speed and convenience,
Information Technology (IT) has also triggered many
complexities requiring research attention. The trend of late
adoption of IT related products and services are mostly
observed in people who have misconceptions, are techno-
phobia and lack IT literacy. The UK is one of the first
countries that have adopted electronic mediums for offering
government services online. Every institute in UK is using
all
possible
appropriate
IT
enabled
medium
of
communication
for
providing
their
services.
Financial
institutes are also utilizing different mediums to provide
efficient services (such as telephone banking, Automatic
Teller Machines (ATM) services and internet banking) for
its consumers [34]. This trend is now gaining popularity in
most developing economies. However, the opportunities
provided by the adoption of the technology also come with a
number of new challenges. For example, lack of security
[32], loyalty and satisfaction [33]. As a result, a lot of multi-
disciplinary research is being undertaken to address these
challenges [31].
Existing financial institutes in the UK should address
emerging
challenges
and
gaps required
for
continued
improvement of performance and socio-economic growth
and development. In the UK, ‘healthy life expectancy’ is
increasing, which creates the need for technological products
and services to fulfill the supporting roles for the elder
people. Social issues, such as the ‘digital divide’, are also
influencing the society in the UK, where more than 9.2 M
are still perceived to be resistant in getting involved in this
electronic age. Given the potential use of the Internet in
everyday life, there is an urgent need to examine the means
to enable older adults to embrace the digital age [9].
Institutes that have plans to formulate their cyber presence
should understand the motivation and perception of end-
users as key indicators of decision making with respect to
product and service development.
This paper presents an
investigation into the behavior of the elderly (people of an
age segment of 55-65) towards Internet banking in the UK.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the
next section (Section II), presents an analysis of the related
background information required for a justification for the
research presented in this paper. It describes the development
of the model used. Section III presents a description of the
research objectives and the main methodology used and the
analysis of the findings presented in Section IV. Section V
concludes with ideas for future work.
II.
BACKGROUD
The background to this paper is based on three related
areas of work - including an evaluation of ICT development
in the UK, its potential benefits and issues affecting its full
adoption by the elderly in Section IIA.
It also presents a
generic review of ecommerce in the UK in Section IIB and a
study of the behavior of the elderly consumers to ecommerce
in Section IIC. Finally, it reviews a number of innovation
adoption models that helped in defining a theoretical
framework for this research in Section IID.
A.
IT/ICT and Gerontechnology in UK
History reveals how Germany and Japan took over
leadership in manufacturing industry, which was once UK’s
identity [1]. Presently, India and China seem to be grabbing
it from Germany and Japan [1]. Thus, to re-develop a
resilient UK economy, intensive investment in IT and ICT
sector has been made. Its objective is to make UK a ‘virtual
hub’ for the globe [1]. The Internet is developing a
uniformed global culture and the UK is greatly participating
in it, demonstrated by the 19 million out of 25 million people
that have Internet connections at home in UK [19]. As a
result, Internet economy is the 5th largest part of the whole
UK’s economy [19].

ICT has opened new ways for elderly people to perform
roles and responsibilities at home and work in progressive
society as active and independent citizens with the support of
developed ICT innovations [38]. For example, improvements
in health care procedures while reducing its cost [37]. The
adoption of ICT also encourages individuals to maintain their
privacy and security [37]. With the increase in age, people
experience different types of illnesses - including visual
problems, hearing impairments and arthritis [40], and it is
clear that ICT innovation can help these people to perform
self-care supporting activities. Researchers have realized the
heterogeneity of grey market in terms of their age group,
interests, skills and abilities that can be useful in the phase of
learning and adopting ICT innovation in older people. [39].
The demand of ergonomics and assistive technology for
elderly people in 1990’s presented research and development
opportunities and challenges required to fulfill future needs
[41]. It is the output of multi-disciplinary overlapping
research, where ‘Technology’ interacts with ‘Gerontology’
to work for betterment of the life of elderly people [43]. For
example, aging issues decrease the chances for elderly
people to continue their routine activities at the same pace.
The technology that can help to avoid or decrease such
chances for elder people is classified as ‘gerontechnology’
[14]. Gerontechnology also encourages the involvement of
elderly people during the design and development phase of
any product and services for their use [42]. Government and
educational institutes in UK are contributing in all possible
ways to cope with uprising aging issues of society by re-
engineering and re-designing operations and management.
B.
E-commerce in UK
Electronic use in all business processes has re-shaped all
sets of actions and enhanced the business growth to higher
levels [18]. Financial firms are using latest technological
support to increase transactional security and provide
maximum number of mediums for serving consumers [4]. In
the framework of e-commerce, Internet banking is defined as
a major part of its applications [18], which still has many
acceptance issues in consumer's mind [7]. Internet banking
can be classified broadly in 3 different forms: (1) To only
provide information about services; (2) To be used as
communication channel only but can't access bank's internal
network; (3) Used to offer complete operational features and
services through electronic platform [22]. In electronic
banking, first remarkable development is the ATM, which
extraordinarily reduced the cost of every transaction [5]. At
the same time, the hesitation to use ATM by older people has
created high level of attention [29]. The Bank of Scotland is
the first financial institute in UK that started providing
electronically in 1980’s [10]. By the year 2006, about 17
million adult population of the UK adopted Internet banking,
which is about one thirds (1/3) of the total population of
adults in UK [6]. The rate of adoption in the case of Internet
banking can be faster and higher if the crucial factors like
privacy, legislation and security are addressed [21].
C.
Elderly People in UK
Studying consumer behavior of specific segment of
people provides us with useful information about them. It
can be used to predict the products and services that they
need [9] i.e.; older people usually buy products and services
according to their convenience [28]. In the UK, the well off
people usually starts to have leisure activities in their older
lives [13], and they are concerned more about health and
mobility related issues [8]. Due to heterogeneity in terms of
attitude and values of mature market, it is important to
subdivide them, usually researchers divide them as 55-64,
65-74, 75-85 and older than 85 [13]. In the EU, people of age
45 and above are increasing as compare to the adults of age
45 or less [16]. Still, in this era of technological revolution,
people prefer to have face-to-face communication where
possible; this behavior can be understandable [20], given that
elderly people have phobia of using technological products
and services [17].
D.
Theoretical Frameworks for Technology Adoption
To understand the behavior of elderly people (age
segment 55-65) towards Internet banking in the UK, a
technology adoption model is required which can figure out
the
consumers’
perceptions
and
attitude.
As
a
quick
flashback of existing models, ‘Innovation Diffusion Theory’
(IDT) can be considered as a first proposed model that
defined the procedure of accepting or rejecting any new
innovation [26]. Afterwards, many social psychological
researchers suggested many variables to predict behavior i.e.
attitude, social norms, subjective norms and perceived
behavioral control. Specifically for technology adoption
‘technology acceptance model’ (TAM) can be considered as
the first model to understand technology adoption in
consumers. TAM defines ‘perceived ease of use (PEOU) and
‘perceived usefulness’ (PU) as major predictors of any
technology adoption [11]. Similarly, the ‘decomposed theory
of planned behavior’ (DTPB) was developed by modifying
the ‘theory of planned behavior’ (TPB) to understand
technology adoption behavior [30]. DTPB describes (1)
'Attitude' as sum of compatibility, perceived ease of use and
usefulness, (2) 'Subjective norms' as a composition of peer
and superior influences and (3) 'Perceived behavioral control
(PBC)’
as
the
output
of
self-efficacy,
resource
and
technology facilitating conditions [2]. Researchers have
already used different variables to make an extension of
existing DTPB for research i.e., ‘risk’ [15] and ‘friendliness’
[25] as a part of DTPB model.
Based on the analysis of existing models, Figure 1
presents a theoretical model adopted for this research.

Figure 1: Proposed model for the current research.
In the current research, DTPB model has been adopted
and ‘resistance to change’ added as a part of the variables
required for predicting ‘attitude’ as it has been done in many
previous researches [35, 36]. ‘Superior influence’ will be
eliminated from the variable to define ‘subjective norms’ and
only peer influence will be discussed. PBC will be analyzed
on
the
basis
of
available
facilitating
conditions
and
individual’s self-efficacy to perform IB related tasks and
operations in the current research model. More specifically,
only the relationship among variables will be analyzed which
are defining ‘attitude’, ‘subjective norms’ and PBC of
elderly people (age group: 55-65) towards Internet banking
in the UK and will not explain the relation of ‘intentions’ and
‘behavior’ with ‘attitude’, ‘social nom’ and PBC
III.
OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT RESEARCH
The purpose of the current research is to extract factors
that have led to the low adoption Internet banking by the
elderly people (with age segment of 55-65) in the UK, in the
following dimensions:

Cross-interaction among 'resistance of change', PEOU,
PU and 'Compatibility'.

Impact of 'social influence' in the case of IB.

How 'self-efficacy' and 'facilitating conditions' affect the
PBC of elder people (age segment: 55-65) towards
Internet banking.
A.
Methedology
For achieving the goal, philosophical stance has been
'Interpretive' due to the focus on the complex social issues.
The research design is 'exploratory' since the aim is to
describe and discuss problem that potentially leads to an
increase
in
knowledge.
For
conducting
research,
quantitative-qualitative methods have been adopted, by
conducting personal, semi structured, face-to-face interviews
and surveys in the form of questionnaires. More specifically,
a sample size of a population 100 users (70 non-users and 30
uses of Internet Banking) has been collected according to the
simplified random sampling method. On the other hand,
convenience sampling was used for conducting interviews
with 8 participants (5 non-users and 3 users).
Inductive-
deductive study approach helps to work under a framework
and suggests new elements as a part of existing model.
Qualitative data was gathered and analyzed by making
transcripts of interviews, categorizing according to the
variables and identifying relations in the summarized data.
The
captured
quantitative
data
was
analyzed
using
descriptive
statistics
to
define
and
challenge
existing
relationships among variables.

After complete reliability and validity test, logical
division of the current area of the paper has focused on
identifying aspects of attitude, PBC and social norms of elder
people towards Internet banking. A blend of quantitative and
qualitative data was used to support the arguments.
Reliability and validity tests are important for verifying
relationships between interrelated items. Value of Cronbach
Alpha is used for this purpose, which should be higher than
.70. If the items are less than 10, inter item correlation can be
measured which should be ranged between .2 - .4 [23], as
shown in the Table 3.

Figure 2: Correlation analysis of 'Perceived Ease of Use', 'Perceived

target segment.
1)
Compatibility
Compatibility is the degree at which any improvement
can stick with existing set of values and needs. Initial
quantitative findings from the non-users of IB, related to
compatibility are mentioned in Table 4.

The trend of adopting Internet banking in male’s
increases with age but this trend is converse in females.
During
qualitative
analysis,
questions
asked
about
involvement of technology in financial activities, responders
replied with the least usage of ATM for withdrawing money
but more interestingly, people still use Internet for web
browsing and emails. Descriptive statistics shows that there
is a positive relation of ‘usefulness’ and ‘ease of use’ with
‘compatibility’ in the current case of study. Actions from
socially active firms to decrease digital divide, increase in
retirement age and higher ratio of males as compare to
females in working environment, can be the reason of output
of this research. Literature and current research defines that,
people having the willingness, better education, need of IT
for job roles and it in a values, are adopting better way.
2)
Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)
PEOU defines how easy it is to adopt a technology.
Quantitative research have presented a number of observed
patterns: (1) 34% of people assume IB is difficult to adopt
and 40% have neutral behavior towards IB. (2) 45% of non-
users defines IB procedures as complex suite of actions and
40% have never thought about IB. (3) Mostly employed
people have neutral behavior about IB and retired people
have
negative
perception
of
it.
Statistical
analysis
summarized ‘PEOU’ as having a positive relation with PU
and compatibility. Qualitative analysis defined that target
segment has knowledge about IB but they usually felt more
comfortable
in
face-to-face
communication.
Literature
supports the findings on the basis of following reasons. (1)
Existing measures of quality of e-service highlight the
importance of ‘enjoyment’, ‘responsiveness’ and ‘contact’
[24].
(2) A fewer packages of information provided by
financial institutes about IB in target segment can be the
reason of ‘neutral’ and negative’ behavior towards IB. (3)
Existing techno-phobia, myths and a huge communication
gap can be the reason of this survey’s response.
3)
Perceived Usefulness
This explains how any innovation can improve and
simplify the tasks. Quantitative survey indicates (1) 35% of
non-users have ‘neutral’ perception about IB. (2) More than
85% of non-users have privacy issues. (3) 50% of non-users
defined complexities in online transactional process as a
reason to avoid IB. (4) 35% have doubts about IB security.
Still more than 37% people have ‘neutral’ behavior towards
IB. Descriptive statistics concludes positive relation of PU
with PEOU and Compatibility. While conducting interview
with an IB user, he mentioned the security checks provided
by his bank for each transaction as a reason of his
satisfaction. Similarly, one of the non-users of IB indicated
security as one of the main factors that made them to avoid
IB. All observations concluded a few elements, which should
be address. (1) Implementations of IB at information,
communication and transactional level should be re-defined
to remove ‘lack of trust’ and ‘critical security issues’ to
attract consumers [22]. (2) In the case of IB, there can be a
chance that people experienced value is less as compare to
the perceived value which made them non-users [24].
4)
Resistance to Change
Survey concludes that 50% people avoid IB because of
complex set of actions for each transaction. The following 2
patterns support the argument that the target segment are
potential IB consumers, (1) 55% of non-users are willing to
adopt new innovation to improve life support. (2) 28% of
non-users
are
not
avoiding
IB
because
of
complex
transactional
process.
Descriptive
statistical
analysis
concludes that PEOU and PU have positive relation with
resistance of change, but the current research hasn’t found
any
relationship
between
‘resistance
to
change’
and
‘compatibility’. One interviewer indicated that they have not
used the Internet for IB purpose and another interviewer
rejected IB to adopt at any cost. Literature defined resistance
towards IB because of following reasons, (1) Non-users in
target segment avoids IB because they di not take risks and
challenges, do things only on the basis of ‘loss based
selection’ improve life in restricted dimensions [12]. (2)
Everybody avoids testing any new idea where the chances of
financial loss are high. To conclude the set of variables that
are defining ‘Attitude’ are Inter-related and have impact on
each other.
B.
Peer influence (Social norms)
In the current research, only 'peer-influence' will be
discussed on how friends and family effects any financial
104

activity in
target segment,
statistical analysis
can be
summarized with the following dominant features. (1) For
general shopping, 40% usually attempt the recommended
products and services. (2) 60% of the sample hasn’t ever
been advised to use IB. (3) Educated people have interest in
recent technological developments. On the other hand,
qualitative survey also showed the same patterns, i.e., an IB
user recommended IB to other friends and family and they
find it easy and convenient to adopt. Perspective of non-users
is different, interviews concludes that people usually avoid
discussing financial concerns with friends and family. From
literature perspective the following have been observed:

IB
provides
less
opportunity
for
trial-ability
and
observe-ability [26].

People with ‘neutral’ opinion can be attracted by proper
encouragement and support.

People only pays attention to the information, which
supports their opinion, such biased attitude can be the
reason of avoiding IB.
C.
Perceived Behavioral Control
Research have shown a possitive relationships between
all the factors. For example, in the third compnent, the
relationship
between
‘facilitating
facilities’
and
‘self-
efficacy’ to define PBC towards IB for the target age
segment was invetigated using the the Pearson Product-
momment correlation coefficient (r).
From the results in
Figure 3, the result
r=.760 indicates a strong, positive
correlation between the two variables.
Figure 3: Correlation analysis of ‘Facilitating facilities' and 'Self efficacy'.
1)
Facilitating Facilities
It includes the know-how about operation in IB and
physical
devices,
which
are
needed
for
IB.
From
questionnaires, following attributes can be concluded, (1)
60% of non-users have knowledge about IB. (2) Employed
and educated people have more knowledge about IB
compared to the rest of the sample. Descriptive analysis
concludes facilitating facilities have positive relation with
self-efficacy. On the other side, qualitative analysis says that
more interaction of non-users with technology can reduce
myths and techno-phobia. Findings are understandable in the
following ways. (1) IB has less ‘Tangibility’ factor. (2)
Learning ability of IB decreases with age [3]. (3) Intensive
attention should be paid on each level of IB (Transactional,
communication and information).
2)
Self-efficacy
This is about an individual’s ability to do tasks with
confidence. In the current target segment, self-efficacy is
getting low with increase in age. Similarly, their ‘neutral’
behavior towards IB is also getting ‘negative’ with increase
in age.
As it is previously discussed that presence of
facilitating conditions can increase the self-efficacy in target
segment towards IB. Quantitative and qualitative survey
concludes that PBC is not the major reason to avoid IB.
Target segment have self-efficacy and facilitating conditions.
Literature
defines
that
elder
people
only
adopt
new
innovation when they have any problem in existing pattern
of work and target segment is quite satisfied with traditional
face-to-face banking [27]. Secondly, Most of the people have
the ability to do different and unique tasks, they only lacked
the proper guidance and instructions to adopt them [3], and
this can be the case for the target age segment.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH
During the whole span of quantitative and qualitative
research, target segment prefers traditional banking system
where they have face-to-face interaction. While studying
behavior
of
elderly
people
towards
Internet
banking
‘compatibility’ is observed the most influencing as compare
to PEOU and PU to form attitude. ‘Resistance of change’
has negative relation with all variables who are composing
‘attitude’. In the behavior towards IB, Social norms in the
form of ‘peer influence’ shows less influencing variable as
compare to the impact of ‘attitude’ in defining behavior
towards IB in the elderly people in the UK. In the collected
quantitative sample, more than 45% of non-users of IB in
target segment have most of the facilitating conditions and
have enough self-efficacy to perform IB related tasks. The
age segment 55-65 with education and employment should
be
address
by
financial
institutions
to
increase
their
motivation, and encourage them to participate in IB services.
The ability to learn and observe exists in elder people in the
UK but financial institutes haven’t ever interacted with them
while taking care of their heterogeneity.
The
current
research
used
a
descriptive
statistical
approach for analyzing the relationship among variables to
define attitude, social norms and PBC. Multiple-regression
can be applied to make the research more authentic. In target
segment, definitions of ‘perceived risks’, ‘quality’ and
‘privacy’ are different in the case of IB, so it is needed to be
re-defined for target segment’s needs. A a new scale for
measuring the quality in the case of IB can be helpful to
predict better adoption rate. Longitudinal in terms of time
horizon can enrich the findings of the current research as
technology adoption decisions includes behavioral and
psychological dimensions
