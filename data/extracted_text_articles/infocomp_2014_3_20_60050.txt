Abstract—The goal of this paper is to investigate outage
performance in a multi-spectral bi-directional full-duplex system
(M-BFD). The system considered is two-way communication
between two nodes equipped with a single shared antenna.
Because full-duplex transmission is being employed, the required
SNR associated with the target rate at each node for BFD is
smaller than that for a bi-directional half-duplex system (BHD).
In a single spectrum environment, therefore, BFD outperforms
BHD in terms of outage probability. From a practical perspective,
we investigate whether BFD remains advantageous over BHD
in a multi-spectrum environment. We investigate the optimal
spectrum selection strategy in terms of outage probability for
M-BFD. The outage probability is derived as a closed-form
expression under this selection strategy.
The results show that the diversity orders for M-BFD and
multi-spectral BHD (M-BHD) are identical. In the high signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) range, furthermore, the SNR difference
between the outage curves for M-BFD and for M-BHD is shown
to be inversely proportional to the number of available spectra,
but in proportional to the target data rate.

I. INTRODUCTION
Bi-directional full-duplex systems (BFD) have the potential
to increase the system capacity of two-way networks with
multiple antennas. In BFD, two source nodes simultaneously
exchange signals by utilizing the same frequency resource [1].
If we assume that self-interference cancellation is perfect, BFD
can achieve up to double the system capacity of bi-directional
half-duplex systems (BHD). Numerous papers have shown the
superiority of BFD over BHD in terms of system capacity [1]-
[4], but system reliability is also a key metric in measuring
system performance.
In BFD, it is inevitable that both nodes divide the spatial re-
sources relatively into two subsets for simultaneous transmis-
sion and reception [1][2]. As a result, the achievable diversity
order decreases, since the division reduces the number of trans-
mit and receive antennas at each node.1 In order to improve the

1Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system with M transmit and N
receive antennas; the maximum achievable diversity order is MN in a slow
Rayleigh fading environment [5]. In BFD, at least one antenna at each node
is used for opposite directional communication so that the maximum diversity
order is (M − 1)(N − 1) [6].
achievable diversity order in BFD, a transmit antenna-switched
receive diversity for the bi-directional beamforming scheme
was proposed [6]. It was assumed that the antennas at each
node are divided into two subsets which speciﬁcally perform
only transmission or reception in [6]. Shared antennas can
be exploited to avoid any division of spatial resources which
causes diversity order reduction [7]. Throughout this paper,
we will consider a two-way communication system equipped
with a single shared antenna.
Recently, there has been growing interest in exploiting the
multi-spectrum environment [8]-[10]. In [8], a closed-form ex-
pression of the capacity gain achieved from spectrum selection
diversity was calculated in cognitive radio environments. In
[9], a fair scheduling scheme was proposed in multi-spectrum
environments. Those works argue that spectrum selection di-
versity can improve system reliability. In particular, the outage
probability in a multi-spectrum system is investigated [10].
One way to enhance system performance, therefore, would
be to bring BFD into the multi-spectrum network. Based on
the above, BFD should also be considered in multi-spectrum
environments. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, however,
there has been no investigation of the outage probability for
M-BFD to date.
Multi-spectral BFD (M-BFD) requires an efﬁcient spec-
trum selection strategy. The outage probability is deﬁned as
the probability that one of the SNRs at both nodes will
be unable to support the required SNR [4]. For two-way
communication in M-BFD, both nodes simultaneously utilize
the same spectrum so that just one selection is needed. In a
multi-spectral bi-directional half-duplex system (M-BHD), in
contrast, each node independently selects the spectrum during
its own transmission period so that twice as many spectrum
selections are needed. In order to avoid outage events in M-
BFD, both links should be considered simultaneously.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section
II describes the system model. Section III investigates a
spectrum selection strategy for M-BFD which minimizes the
outage probability. Under this spectrum selection strategy, in
Section IV, we will then derive the outage probabilities for
M-BFD and M-BHD as a closed-form expression. We will
also investigate the diversity orders and the asymptotic SNR
difference between the outage curves for M-BFD and M-BHD.
Finally, our conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
Let us ﬁrst consider our two-way communication system.
It consists of two transceivers, node a and node b, equipped
with a single antenna [7]. Let linkab and linkba denote the
data transmission links from a to b and b to a, respectively.
We assume that each transmission link uses time T sec and
one spectrum B Hz. We also assume the number of available
spectra to be K.
Fig. 1 describes the M-BFD system [11]. Node a and node b
simultaneously transmit and receive signals during time period
T with the same selected spectrum from among K available
spectra. We presume that the antennas at each node are able to
transmit and receive signals simultaneously using a circulator
in the BFD system with self-interference cancellation [7]. We
also assume that the self-interference is perfectly eliminated
as described in [1][2] and [6].2
Fig. 2 shows the M-BHD system. In order to perform
two-way communication, M-BHD requires time 2T [1]. Each
single time period of T sec is utilized for a single transmission
link using the independently selected spectrum. In other words,
during time [0, T], node a transmits signals to node b through
linkab using the selected kH
ab-th spectrum. Then, during time
[T, 2T], node b transmits signals to node a through linkba
using the selected kH
ba-th spectrum.
(·)F and (·)H stand for (·) for M-BFD and M-BHD,
respectively. The received signal at node i which is transmitted
by node j, yi (i, j ∈ {a, b}), can then be expressed respectively
as
ym
k,i = hm
k xm
j + ni,
(1)
where m ∈ {F, H}. xj is the transmitted signal from node
2Up to 70dB of self-interference can be eliminated by isolating the
antennas[7]. Since each node knows its own transmitted data, self-interference
can be subtracted from the desired signal [12]. A number of papers have been
published on practical full-duplex transmission [13][14].

j.3 ni is the additive noise at receiver node i and distributed
as CN(0, σ2). The channel coefﬁcient for the k-th selected
spectrum, hk (k ∈ {1, ..., K}), is distributed as CN(0, 12).
The channel state is constant in a single period, since it is
assumed that the coherence time and the coherence bandwidth
of each channel are T and B, respectively. Therefore, the hk’s
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh
fading. In M-BFD, the channel coefﬁcients for both links are
identical, since we assume channel reciprocity between both
links [15]. Note that each node in M-BFD simultaneously
receives signals during time [0, T] while each node in M-BHD
receives signals during different periods, [0, T] and [T, 2T],
respectively.
III. SPECTRUM SELECTION CRITERION AND OUTAGE
PROBABILITY
In this section, we investigate the spectrum selection criteria
for M-BFD and M-BHD in order to minimize the outage
probability. The outage probabilities are derived as closed-
form expressions under the spectrum selection criteria, after
which the diversity orders are then also derived.
A. Optimal Spectrum Selection Criterion in Terms of Outage
Probability
In two-way communication, an outage occurs when one
of the two links cannot support the required SNR, which is
denoted by γth [4]. We assume that perfect CSI is available
[16]. In this case, the outage probability, PO, is expressed as
PO = 1 − Pr [γk,a > γth, γk,b > γth] ,
(2)
where γk,i = |hkxj|2
σ2
is the SNR at receiver node i utilizing
the k-th selected channel.
Let us ﬁrst consider the spectrum selection criterion for
M-BFD. In M-BFD, the received SNRs at nodes a and b
utilizing the selected spectrum both need to simultaneously
support the required SNR, since each node utilizes the same
time and spectrum resources. The outage probability can then
be expressed as [10]
P F
O = 1 − Pr
[
min
i=a,b γF
k,i > γF
th
]
.
(3)
In order to minimize the outage probability for M-BFD, we
need to select the spectrum that maximizes the SNR for the
weaker link. Therefore, the spectrum selection criterion for
M-BFD can be expressed as
kF = arg
max
k=1,...,K min
i=a,b γF
k,i.
(4)
In M-BFD, the SNRs at both nodes are identical, since we
assume channel reciprocity between both links [15]. Therefore,
without loss of generality, (4) can be expressed as
kF = arg
max
k=1,...,K γF
k,a.
(5)

power of the M-BHD, i.e., E

On the other hand, in M-BHD, note that the received SNRs
at node a and b are independent, since the spectra can be
independently selected at each node during different time
periods. Therefore, the outage probability for M-BHD can be
expressed as
P H
O = 1 − Pr[γH
k,a > γH
th] Pr[γH
k,b > γH
th].
(6)
In order to minimize the outage probability for M-BHD, each
node should independently select the spectrum that maximizes
the received SNR at the corresponding transmission time. The
spectrum selection criterion for each link in M-BHD can then
be expressed as
kH
ab = arg
max
k=1,...,K γH
k,b,
kH
ba = arg
max
k=1,...,K γH
k,a.
(7)
From (5) and (7), we can observe the effects on the outage
probability by the number of the available spectra. Both (5)
and (7) can achieve full spectrum selection gain since the
spectra which maximize the received SNRs are independently
selected at each node during the corresponding transmission
time periods.
B. Outage Probability
In this subsection, we derive the outage probabilities for
M-BFD and M-BHD as closed-form expressions. We ﬁrst
consider the outage probability for M-BFD. As mentioned
above, an outage occurs when one of the two nodes cannot
support the required SNR. We deﬁne the target rate as R
bps/Hz, so that the required SNR for M-BFD, γF
th, is 2R − 1.
The received SNRs at node i in M-BFD are
γF
k,i = |hk|2 P
2
σ2
= |hk|2η
2
,
(8)
where η is the common SNR, which is expressed as P/σ2.
The |hk|2’s are modeled as i.i.d exponential random variables
whose mean value is 1 because it is assumed that the hk’s are
i.i.d Rayleigh fading. We deﬁne f|hk|2 (x) as the PDF of |hk|2,
which are expressed as e−x and independent with respect to
k. Then, using (3), (5), and (8), the outage probability for
M-BFD can be expressed as
P F
O = 1 − Pr

[

(9)
Using (9) and order statistics [17], the outage probability for
M-BFD can be expressed as

.
(10)
In M-BHD, an outage occurs when one of the SNRs
received at the two nodes cannot satisfy the required SNR at
the corresponding transmission time. Since M-BHD utilizes
double the time for two way communication compared to
M-BFD, M-BHD transmission for each link needs to be
performed twice as fast as that for M-BFD in order to achieve
the same target rate. Therefore, the required SNR for M-BHD,
γH
th, can be expressed by 22R −1. The received SNRs at node
i for M-BHD can then be expressed as
γH
k,i = |hk|2P
σ2
= |hk|2η,
(11)
Using (6), (7), and (11), the outage probability for M-BHD
can be expressed as

Using (12) and order statistics [17], the outage probability for

(13)
In the following subsections we will move on to investigat-
ing the outage probabilities with respect to diversity order and
SNR difference the in high SNR regime.
C. Diversity Order
In this subsection, we derive the diversity orders for M-
BFD and M-BHD in order to investigate the effect of the
multi-spectrum diversity gain on the outage probability. We
deﬁne the diversity order as the magnitude of the slope in the
high SNR regime where the outage probability versus SNR is
represented on a log scale [18]. We can deﬁne the diversity
order, d, as
d = lim
η→∞
(
−η ∂ log PO
∂η
)
.
(14)
Substituting (10) and (13) into (14), the diversity orders for
M-BFD and M-BHD can be derived respectively as
dF = lim
η→∞
(
−η ∂ log P F
O
∂η
)
= K
(15)
and
dH = lim
η→∞
(
−η ∂ log P H
O
∂η
)
= K.
(16)
Note that each system achieves the same diversity, K. This is
because both M-BFD and M-BHD select one spectrum from
among K available spectra in a single time period. It can be
inferred that M-BFD and M-BHD are identically affected by
67

the number of available spectra in terms of reliability. On the
other hand, M-BFD has half the transmission time compared
to M-BHD with the given common SNR. Considering both
reliability and transmission time, it can be inferred that M-
BFD offers an advantage in two-way communications.
D. Asymptotic Difference Between Outage Probability
In this subsection, we investigate the asymptotic difference
between the outage probability for M-BFD and for M-BHD.
From (15) and (16), it can be inferred that the log-scaled
outage probability versus the dB-scaled SNR curves for M-
BFD is a shifted version of that for the corresponding M-
BHD in the high SNR regime. We deﬁne the SNR difference
between the outage probability curve for M-BFD and M-BHD
as the SNR gap, ∆(R, K). We assume ζ as a desired outage
probability for a given target rate R. Then,
P F
O
(
ηF , R, K
)
= P H
O
(
ηH, R, K
)
= ζ,
(17)
where ηF and ηH denote the SNR values which achieve the
desired outage probability for M-BFD and M-BHD, respec-
tively. From Appendix A, the overall SNR gap can be obtained
as
∆(R, K) =

(

)

.
(18)
Note that the SNR gap is determined by the number of
available spectra and the target data rate. The SNR gap is in
inverse proportion to K, but increases almost linearly along
with R.
The ﬁrst term of the SNR gap originates from the difference
in the spectrum selection diversity gain between M-BFD
and M-BHD. For two-way communication, both nodes in
M-BFD simultaneously utilize the same spectrum so that
just one selection is needed. In M-BHD, in contrast, each
node independently selects the spectrum in its transmission
time so that twice as many spectrum selections are needed.
From this perspective, M-BFD is more advantageous with
respect to avoiding outages than M-BHD. As K increases, the
probability difference between the existence of a satisfactory
spectrum in one time period and that in two consecutive
time periods decreases. Therefore, as shown in (18), the gain
decreases along with K.
The second term and the third term originate from the
difference in the required SNR and power usage between M-
BFD and M-BHD, respectively. The required SNR gain of M-
BFD increases logarithmically with the ratio of the required
SNR for M-BHD to that for M-BFD which can be expressed as
2R+1. The negative constant power gain of M-BFD originates
from the fact that both nodes in M-BFD transmit with half the
power of those in M-BHD, as mentioned in (8) and (11).
We also ﬁnd that the SNR gap has a non-negative value.
This is because 10log102
K
≥ 0 and 10log10
(
2R + 1
)
≥ log102,
since K and R are non-negative. Hence, it can be inferred that
M-BFD outperforms M-BHD in terms of outage probability.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present the outage probabilities for
M-BFD and M-BHD to verify our analysis. In the ﬁgures,
the lines and symbols represent the theoretical results and
simulation results, respectively.
Fig. 3 compares the outage probabilities for M-BFD and M-
BHD according to the SNR with various numbers of available
spectra (K = 1, 5, 10). We set the target data rate, R, to be
1 bps/Hz. Each system has the same diversity order under
ﬁxed R and K. In addition, we can see that the outage
probabilities for both systems decrease with the power of K.
This means that the effect of the number of available spectra
on the diversity orders in each system is equivalent, as shown

ﬁxed R and with the desired outage probability, but becomes

dB as shown in (18). From these
results, we can conﬁrm that M-BFD outperforms M-BHD.
Fig. 4 compares the outage probabilities according to the
target rate with various numbers of available spectra (K =
1, 5, 10). We set the SNR to be 10 dB. The difference in the
achievable data rate between M-BFD and M-BHD increases
along with K under ﬁxed SNR and with the desired outage
probability. This originates from the fact that the ratio of the
required SNR for M-BHD on M-BFD for the desired outage
probability increases along with K as shown in (10) and (13).
From this result, it can be inferred that M-BFD can achieve a
higher data rate compared to M-BHD, and that the difference
increases along with K.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We investigated spectrum selection strategies for M-BFD
and M-BHD in order to minimize outage. After applying
the spectrum selection strategies, M-BFD was shown to be
superior to M-BHD in terms of outage probability. Due to
the smaller spectrum selection, M-BFD achieves a greater
spectrum selection diversity gain than M-BHD despite the
fact that the difference decreases along with the number of
available spectra. A reduction in time usage due to simul-
taneous transmission at both source nodes leads M-BFD to
achieve the required SNR gain at a better rate than M-BHD.
The advantage of M-BFD expands at high target data rates
with a large number of available spectra.
