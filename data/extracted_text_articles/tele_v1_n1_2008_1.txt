Abstract
In scenarios where many receivers simultaneously are
interested in the same data, multicast transmission is more
bandwidth efﬁcient than unicast. The reason is that the re-
ceivers of a multicast session share the resources through a
common transmission tree. Since the resources are shared
between the receivers, it is reasonable that the costs corre-
sponding to these resources should be shared as well.
This paper deals with fair cost sharing among multicast
receivers, and the work is based upon the assumption that
costs should be shared according to the resource usage.
However, it is not for certain that an optimally fair cost al-
location is most beneﬁcial for the receivers; receivers that
cannot cover their fair share of the costs may nevertheless
be able to contribute to the cost sharing to some extent. We
propose a cost-allocation mechanism that strives to allocate
the costs fairly, but gives discount to poor receivers who at
least manage to cover the additional cost of providing them
with the service.
Keywords: multicast, fairness, cost allocation
1. Introduction
Video-streaming services are rapidly gaining in popular-
ity, and the quality of these services is also increasing. Inter-
net video already has attracted a large crowd, but the quality
leaves more to wish for. Internet protocol television (IPTV)
is being deployed on a wider extent and the transition to
high deﬁnition television (HDTV) resolution is ongoing. In
the longer run, 3D video and free-viewpoint video (FVV)
services will also be offered. This development produces
challenges for computer networks of all sizes, from small
LANs to the whole Internet.
The employment of multicast transmission can reduce
the resource demands of services where some content is si-
multaneously transmitted to a number of users. The rea-
son is that the receivers of a multicast session share the re-
sources through a common transmission tree, where data
are only transmitted once along each branch. Nevertheless,
multicast transmission is not deployed to its full extent.
In [13], we therefore aimed at creating an incentive for
the use of multicast transmission. The proposal was a gen-
eral deﬁnition of how the bandwidth should be distributed
fairly between competing multicast and unicast sessions. In
short, the deﬁnition takes the number of receivers into con-
sideration, which is beneﬁcial for multicast sessions.
If the transmission costs for multicast sessions also were
favorable when compared to those of unicast, this would
create another incentive for the employment of multicast. In
this paper, we therefore study how the transmission costs of
multicast sessions should be allocated to achieve this goal.
This work is an extension of that presented at the IARIA
ICDT 2007 conference [15] and in [14].
Henceforth, costs always refers to the costs associated
with the actual transmission, i.e.
costs for network re-
sources such as links and routers, or in reality, the fees that
the Internet service providers (ISPs) are charging. The cost
of the delivered content is strictly excluded throughout this
work.
To begin with, we adopt the fundamental assumption
made by Herzog et al. in [8], that the cost of a multicast tree
should be assigned to the receivers and not to the source.
The reason is that multicast transmission is receiver initi-
ated and that the service primarily is of use to the receivers,
since the sources typically are streaming servers. The three
basic requirements; no positive transfers, voluntary partici-
pation, and consumer sovereignty, are also sustained.
Further, we believe that fair cost allocation should be
based on resource usage. This is likely to make the resource
utilization more effective. With a ﬂat-rate policy, there are
no incentives for limiting the resource usage, as long as it is
maintained within the postulated limit.
As an example, in everyday life, the expectation is that
a train ticket will cost less than an air ticket. In addition,
short domestic ﬂights are expected to cost less than longer
international ﬂights. Furthermore, a shared cab is cheaper

per capita than a private one. The higher costs involved
in more exclusive services together with a limited budget,
probably accounts for the most common reason why peo-
ple do not travel more, further, and faster, etc. A season
ticket or the like, i.e. a ﬂat rate policy, works against this
incentive. Although, there might exist other motives, such
as environmental awareness etc.
For data transmission over computer networks, the two
major resource-related factors, which might differ between
receivers, also relate to distance and quality. Namely the
transmission path and the quality of service (QoS) require-
ments. As an example, choosing a server that is geograph-
ically close and settling for a low quality service would re-
duce the resource usage. This also holds for multicast re-
ceivers, but here the “shared-cab” aspect comes into play as
well. Connecting to a multicast tree with many receivers in
the vicinity will also save resources.
In Section 2 and 3 we describe existing cost-allocation
mechanisms for multicast trafﬁc. These mechanisms are
then studied in Section 4, and the ﬁnding is that none
take all of the aforementioned factors into consideration.
A terminology for cost-allocation mechanisms that targets
multi-rate multicast sessions is then introduced in Section 5,
whereupon two new cost-allocation mechanisms are pro-
posed in Section 6. The conclusions are presented in Sec-
tion 7 together with some possible future research topics.
2. Existing cost-allocation mechanisms
In this section, a number of cost-allocation mechanisms
for cost sharing among multicast receivers are outlined.
These are a selection of existing mechanisms, other propos-
als for example include [5] and [3]. However, some of the
terminology associated with cost sharing among multicast
receivers is ﬁrstly introduced.
2.1. Terminology for multicast cost sharing
This section outlines the notations for cost sharing
among multicast receivers, originally introduced in [8].
The number of receivers upstream and downstream re-
spectively for a particular link are denoted by nu and nd.
The receivers downstream of a link are those receivers
whose transmission paths from the source traverse that link.
The receivers upstream of a link are somewhat less intu-
itively deﬁned as the receivers who are not located down-
stream of that link. In the multicast tree of Figure 1, where t
is the transmitter, receivers r1, r2 and r3 are located down-
stream of link l, whereas receivers r4 through r7 are up-
stream of link l.
The part of the cost of the link allo-
cated to the upstream receivers is described by the function
Fu(nu, nd), whereas Fd(nu, nd) represents the part of the
cost that is allocated to the downstream receivers.
Figure 1. A multicast transmission tree with
seven receivers.
Multicast sessions that support multiple quality of ser-
vice (QoS) levels are also covered in [8]. The shares of
the total cost allocated to the upstream and downstream re-
ceivers requesting QoS level i, are denoted by Fi
u(zu, zd)
and Fi
d(zu, zd) respectively. However, the terms zu and zd
are not deﬁned.
2.2. The edge-pricing paradigm
Pricing and cost allocation in computer networks are
treated extensively by Shenker et al. in [12]. They initi-
ate their discussion with pricing based on estimated conges-
tion conditions. The reason being the high complexity as-
sociated with the computation of the actual prevailing con-
gestion conditions and the consequence is basically QoS-
sensitive time-of-day pricing. They then claim that differen-
tiated pricing based on estimated congestion conditions can
be exchanged for differentially priced QoS classes. When
the estimated congestion probability is low, even cheaper
QoS classes will perform well. Users can therefore adapt
their costs by monitoring and changing QoS classes.
Shenker et al.
further propose that the pricing, aside
from the QoS class, only should depend on the locations
of the source and destination. The costs of the actual trans-
mission path are approximated using the costs of the ex-
pected path. Consequently, the prices are based upon the
estimated congestion conditions along the expected trans-
mission path from the source to the destination. If informa-
tion about congestion conditions is gathered at the edges of
the network of an ISP, it should be possible to determine the
price of a session at the access point. For connections that
traverse the borders between different ISPs, the ISPs must
purchase the service from each other in the same manner
that regular users purchase service. This solution is called
the edge-pricing paradigm.
Multicast trafﬁc causes a challenge for the edge-pricing

paradigm, because a multicast destination address is merely
a logical name and does not identify the individual receivers
of the multicast group. The only information about multi-
cast sessions that is present in a router node is regarding the
next hop(s). It is therefore impossible to estimate the multi-
cast tree at the access points. Shenker et al. propose control
messages to be sent when new receivers join a multicast
group. These messages should be forwarded along the re-
verse multicast tree to the access point of the source, where
the cost of the tree may be approximated. The ISPs would
process the control messages at the edges of their network
and thereby extract adequate information. An alternative
solution is to record the cost of each link within the control
messages.
Shenker et al. also have a general discussion relating to
cost sharing among multicast receivers. However, they do
not propose any cost-allocation mechanism.
2.3. Single QoS cost allocation
In [8], Herzog et al. present an extensive work regarding
how the costs of multicast trees should be split among the
receivers. They present a number of cost-allocation mech-
anisms, of which the equal tree split (ETS) and equal link
split downstream (ELSD) mechanisms are given the most
attention.
The ELSD cost-allocation mechanism splits the cost of
each link in the tree evenly between the downstream re-
ceivers. Using the notations introduced in subsection 2.1,
the part of the cost of the link allocated to the upstream re-
ceivers can be described as
Fu(nu, nd) = 0,
(1)
whereas the part of the cost allocated to each downstream
receivers becomes
Fd(nu, nd) = 1
nd
.
(2)
The ETS cost-allocation mechanism splits the cost of the
entire transmission tree uniformly amongst all the receivers.
Using the same notations, we obtain
Fu(nu, nd) = Fd(nu, nd) =
1
nu + nd
.
(3)
2.4. QoS-based cost allocation
If the transmitted data are hierarchically encoded and
marked and the router nodes employ priority dropping,
users may choose to subscribe to a service although they
cannot utilize the entire data rate transmitted by the source.
The most obvious reason behind such limitations are net-
work connections with low capacity. When the transmit-
ted content is real-time video, another limiting factor might
be the rendering capacity of the receiving device. In either
case, these users do not utilize the entire bandwidth allo-
cated to a multicast session, at least not on all of the links
along their transmission path.
In [8], Herzog et al. observe that this should affect the
cost allocation of multicast sessions, but they do not pro-
pose any speciﬁc cost-allocation mechanism for these sce-
narios. Using the terminology of subsection 2.1, they do
however point out that if the cost-allocation functions fulﬁll
the following condition,
I
X
i=1
¡
zi
u · Fi
u(zu, zd) + zi
d · Fi
d(zu, zd)
¢
= 1,
(4)
the costs associated with the link in question are fully allo-
cated among the receivers.
Liu et al. study usage-based pricing and cost sharing
of multicast trafﬁc in [9]. They propose a cost-allocation
mechanism, whose cost sharing they state “is proportional
to individual members resource requirements, should a uni-
cast service be used”. The receivers are divided into cate-
gories depending on their requested QoS level. The costs
associated with a particular category are then aggregated
over the entire multicast tree, but only split among re-
ceivers obtaining that QoS level or higher, in an ETS fash-
ion. Henceforth, this cost-allocation mechanism is therefore
referred to as QoS-dependent ETS (QoS-D ETS).
3. Game-theoretic cost-allocation mechanisms
Many researchers have considered the bandwidth-
allocation and pricing process from a game-theoretic per-
spective. Somewhat simpliﬁed, this implies that potential
users place bids which reﬂect what the service is worth to
them. The ISP then allocates the resources according to
these bids. Some basic notions of game theory that are in-
troduced in [11] are outlined in 3.1, followed by two game-
theoretic cost-allocation mechanisms. Other works on the
same subject are [4] and [2].
3.1. Game-theoretic notions
A cost-allocation mechanism in which the costs allo-
cated to the users exactly match the cost of the service, is
called budget balanced. A user’s welfare can be described
as the satisfaction after obtaining a service for a certain cost.
An efﬁcient cost-allocation mechanism chooses to serve the
set of users that maximizes the aggregated welfare of all the
users.
Assume that a user is part of a user set that is a subset of
a larger set of users. Then a cost-allocation mechanism is
cross-monotonic if for all such user sets, the cost allocated

4
International Journal On Advances in Telecommunications, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
to the user when the larger set is served, is lower or equal in
comparison to when the smaller set is served.
It is reasonable to assume that users are selﬁsh and place
bids that maximize their probable welfare. A cost-sharing
mechanism is strategyproof if users maximize their welfare
by placing bids that truthfully correspond to how much the
service is worth to them. Group strategyproof is a harder
criterion that requires the cost-allocation mechanism to be
resistant against groups of users who jointly place their bids
in an attempt to increase their welfares.
Another contribution of [11], is the establishing of the
following three basic requirements:
• no positive transfers – no user is paid to obtain a ser-
vice
• voluntary participation – no user is forced to obtain a
service
• consumer sovereignty – no user is refused a service if
their bid is sufﬁciently high
According to [6], there are two cost-allocation mechanisms
that are naturally strategyproof and adhere to these basic
requirements, the marginal-cost (MC) and Shapley-value
(SH) mechanisms. Further, it is stated that these are the
two most appropriate mechanisms for cost sharing among
multicast receivers.
3.2. The Shapley-value mechanism
The
SH
cost-allocation
mechanism
is
the
game-
theoretical equivalent to ELSD. It splits the cost of a net-
work link equally between all receivers that are located
downstream [6]. The SH mechanism is group strategyproof
and budget balanced. However, it is not efﬁcient but has
the smallest maximum loss of welfare among the budget-
balanced mechanisms.
3.3. The marginal-cost mechanism
As described in [11], the MC mechanism essentially
charges the marginal cost to the users, that is the cost of
providing the service to all users minus the cost of provid-
ing the service to all but the user in question. It therefore has
the characteristic that it treats equals equally, that is if two
receivers give rise to the same marginal cost and place iden-
tical bids, they are allocated the same amount of resources
and are charged the same cost. Further, the MC mechanism
is efﬁcient but not budget balanced nor group strategyproof.
In [1], the MC mechanism is applied to multicast ses-
sions that support multiple rates. The split session and lay-
ered paradigms are studied, but only the layered paradigm
is somewhat relevant here, since a split session basically im-
plies separate transmissions of different QoS levels, i.e. the
problem associated with multiple QoS levels is divided into
a number of problems, each with a single QoS level.
The layered paradigm, thoroughly described in [10], uti-
lizes hierarchically encoded data, which is divided into QoS
layers that are transmitted to individual multicast groups.
The receivers consequently join multicast groups with QoS
layers that can be combined into the desired QoS level. The
layered paradigm therefore inherently implies that costs are
separated according to QoS requirements.
3.4. Comparison of SH and MC mechanisms
In [7], both the SH and MC cost-allocation mechanisms
are implemented and experiments are carried out. The MC
is shown to generate a smaller revenue, which is not surpris-
ing since it is not budget balanced. On the other hand, the
MC mechanism is faster than the SH mechanism.
In [6], it is observed that the MC mechanism only re-
quires two messages per link in the multicast tree, whereas
the number of messages required for the SH mechanism is
of the order of the square of the number of links.
4. Evaluation of existing mechanisms
In this section, the cost-allocation mechanisms outlined
in Section 2 and 3 are evaluated based on their attractiveness
to the receivers. Important parameters are the magnitude of
the costs and how fairly the costs are distributed.
4.1. The edge-pricing paradigm
The edge-pricing paradigm [12], brieﬂy described in
subsection 2.2, possesses some attractive properties, and it
appears to be based upon sound approximations. However,
the authors do not specify the pricing policy to be used. This
decision is left to the individual ISPs. There are two main
classes of pricing policies; usage-based policies where users
are charged based on their actual usage, and capacity-based
or ﬂat-rate policies, where the users pay for the desired ca-
pacity. The choice, in this case, was to focus on usage-based
pricing policies, since they are more favorable to multicast
sessions and also might be considered to be fairer.
4.2. Single QoS cost allocation
For usage-based pricing policies, the cost of a multicast
session should be divided among the receivers.
The re-
ceivers in a multicast group have unique transmission paths
per deﬁnition, otherwise they would have been positioned
at the same location. As outlined in subsection 2.3, Her-
zog et al. propose a couple of cost-allocation mechanisms
that are based upon the individual receivers’ transmission
paths [8]. However, there is a second factor that might affect

5
International Journal On Advances in Telecommunications, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
the amount of resources that are utilized by the individual
receivers, namely the QoS requirements.
4.3. QoS-based cost allocation
As stated in subsection 2.4, users may choose to sub-
scribe to a service although they cannot utilize the entire
data rate transmitted by the source. These users do not use
the entire bandwidth allocated to a multicast session, and
should therefore, from a usage-based pricing perspective,
be allocated a smaller share of the costs.
Although the work of Herzog et al. presented in [8] is
extensive, the case involving individual receivers of a mul-
ticast group requesting different levels of QoS is covered on
less than half a page. The discussion is very general and
no speciﬁc cost-allocation mechanism is proposed for these
scenarios.
The QoS-D ETS cost-allocation mechanism described
by Liu et al. in [9] does however represent this approach.
The costs corresponding to each QoS level are aggregated
over the entire multicast tree, and divided uniformly among
the receivers obtaining that level or higher.
Thus, the
lengths of the individual transmission paths are not taken
into consideration. The statement in [9] concerning the cost
sharing being proportional to the individual receivers’ re-
source requirements, if unicast had been used, is therefore
not strictly true.
4.4. Game-theoretic approaches
In game-theoretic approaches, the bandwidth allocation
is incorporated with the pricing procedure. However, we
aim for a cost-allocation mechanism that can fairly dis-
tribute the costs of any bandwidth allocation. The game-
theoretic mechanisms are therefore ruled out.
4.5. Section summary
The game-theoretic approaches do not support cost-
allocation of arbitrary bandwidth allocations, and none of
the pure cost-allocation mechanisms takes both the trans-
mission path and the QoS requirements into consideration.
Hence, the mechanisms do not fully reﬂect the resource us-
age, and consequently there is room for improvements.
5. Terminology for multicast cost sharing
As mentioned in subsection 2.4, the notations for cost-
allocation functions targeting multicast sessions with dif-
ferentiated QoS levels, introduced by Herzog et al. in [8]
and outlined in subsection 2.1, are not well deﬁned. Thus,
the decision was made to interpret and extend the terminol-
ogy, in order to better suit multicast sessions that provide
multiple QoS levels. This will prove to be useful in the fol-
lowing section, where two new cost-allocation mechanisms
are proposed.
We deﬁne nq
u and nq
d to be the number of upstream and
downstream receivers of the qth QoS level (QoSq), and let
zq
u and zq
d denote the total number of upstream and down-
stream receivers utilizing the information corresponding to
QoSq. That is,
zq
u =
Q
X
x=q
nx
u
and
zq
d =
Q
X
x=q
nx
d,
given that there are Q available QoS levels. We also deﬁne
the vectors
zu =
©
z1
u, z2
u, . . . , zQ
u
ª
and
zd =
n
z1
d, z2
d, . . . , zQ
d
o
.
Further, Herzog et al. not only allow the cost-allocation
functions to control the division of the costs between re-
ceivers requesting the same QoS level, but also the distri-
bution of the total cost among the different QoS levels. On
the contrary, our opinion is that the cost-allocation functions
should be general and not inﬂuence the distribution of the
cost among the QoS levels. This distribution should instead
fully reﬂect the resource requirements of each QoS level
and the corresponding pricing made by the ISP in question.
Consequently, the cost vector
c =
©
c1, c2, . . . , cQª
is introduced, where the additional costs for supporting
QoSq on a particular link during a speciﬁc period of time,
when compared to those of QoSq−1, are denoted by cq.
These costs should reasonably be split among the receivers
requiring QoSq or higher, and two cost-allocation subfunc-
tions, fq
u(zq
u, zq
d) and fq
d(zq
u, zq
d), are introduced for this pur-
pose. These subfunctions describe the shares of the addi-
tional costs, for supporting QoSq level, that should be al-
located to the receivers of QoSq or higher, both upstream
and downstream of the link in question. The total cost that
is to be allocated to the upstream and downstream receivers
of QoSq may now be written as
Cq
u(zu, zd, c) =
q
X
x=1
fx
u(zx
u, zx
d)cx
(5)
and
Cq
d(zu, zd, c) =
q
X
x=1
fx
d (zx
u, zx
d)cx,
(6)

6
International Journal On Advances in Telecommunications, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
respectively.
The two cost-allocation functions Cq
u(zu, zd, c) and
Cq
d(zu, zd, c) represent the actual cost, whereas the origi-
nal cost-allocation functions Fu(zu, zd) and Fd(zu, zd) de-
scribed the fraction of the total cost to be allocated to the
users. The condition (4), regarding full cost allocation, is
therefore no longer valid. Instead, for the costs correspond-
ing to each QoS level to be fully allocated, the following
equation
zq
u· fq
u(zq
u, zq
d) + zq
d· fq
d(zq
u, zq
d) ≥ 1,
(7)
must be fulﬁlled for all integers q between one and Q, where
Q is the highest QoS level with a receiver downstream of the
link in question.
If equation (7) is an equality for all integers q between
one and Q, this guarantees that the sum of all allocated
costs equals the sum of the costs according to equation (8),
which means that the cost-allocation mechanism is budget
balanced.
As an example, consider the QoS-D ETS cost-allocation
mechanism described in subsection 2.4. Using the termi-
nology introduced in this section, it is represented by cost-
allocation subfunctions corresponding to the cost-allocation
functions of the ETS mechanism (3)
fq
u(zq
u, zq
d) = fq
d(zq
u, zq
d) =
1
zq
u + zq
d
.
Consequently
zq
u· fq
u(zq
u, zq
d) + zq
d· fq
d(zq
u, zq
d)
= zq
u
1
zq
u + zq
d
+ zq
d
1
zq
u + zq
d
= zq
u + zq
d
zq
u + zq
d
= 1,
and the QoS-D ETS mechanism is therefore budget bal-
anced according to equation (8).
6. Fair cost-allocation strategies
The evaluation of existing cost-allocation mechanisms in
Section 4 was concluded with the realization that none of
them were satisfactorily fair. The reason was that, at most,
they consider one of the two main factors affecting the re-
source usage, i.e. the transmission path and the QoS require-
ments. Using the terminology introduced in Section 5, a
new cost-allocation mechanism, which takes both these fac-
tors into consideration, is proposed in subsection 6.1.
Although the aim of this mechanism is to achieve op-
timum fairness, it might have one, possibly severe, short-
coming: Optimum fairness may not be the primary interest
of the receivers, if it occurs at the expense of higher costs.
If poor and greedy receivers get a discount on the service,
it may actually become cheaper for the rest of the receivers.
An alternative mechanism is therefore proposed in subsec-
tion 6.2.
6.1.
QoS-diﬀerentiated
link
split
down-
stream
The ﬁrst proposal is designed to perform perfectly fair
cost allocations, taking into consideration both the trans-
mission path and the QoS requirements. It builds on the
ELSD cost-allocation mechanism, presented by Herzog
et al. in [8], but is enhanced to support differentiated QoS
levels.
The cost-allocation subfunctions therefore correspond to
equations (1) and (2), and become
fq
u(zq
u, zq
d) = 0
(9)
and
fq
d(zq
u, zq
d) = 1
zq
d
,
(10)
respectively. This gives that
zq
u· fq
u(zq
u, zq
d) + zq
d· fq
d(zq
u, zq
d) = zq
u· 0 + zq
d
1
zq
d
= zq
d
zq
d
= 1,
and the cost-allocation mechanism is consequently budget
balanced according to equation (8).
Substituting equations (9) and (10) into (5) and (6), the
main cost-allocation functions for receivers of QoSq be-
come
Cq
u(zu, zd, c) = 0
(11)
and
Cq
d(zu, zd, c) =
q
X
x=1
cx
zx
d
.
(12)
We call the cost-allocation mechanism described by equa-
tions (11) and (12), the QoS-differentiated link split down-
stream (QoS-D LSD) mechanism.
6.1.1. Bandwidth-differentiated link split downstream.
As observed in [8], in the extreme case, each receiver will
have a QoS level of its own. This can be taken one step
further, by assuming the bandwidth to be the predominant
cost factor and considering the bandwidth consumption as a
direct function of the QoS level. Let us also assume that the
bandwidth is uniformly priced and costs c monetary units
(MU) per bitrate unit (BU) and time unit (TU).
Let b be a vector whose ﬁrst element b[0] is 0 and the nd
following elements are the receiving rates of the receivers
downstream of the link in question, sorted in ascending or-
der. The total cost per TU, allocated to the downstream re-
ceiver obtaining the qth smallest bandwidth, may now be
rewritten as
Cq
d(nd, b) = c
q
X
x=1
b[x] − b[x − 1]
nd − x + 1
.

The bandwidth-differentiated link split downstream cost al-
location performed by equation (13) is only a special case
of the QoS-D LSD mechanism.
6.1.2. A cost-allocation example. As a small example of
the QoS-D LSD mechanism, let us study how equation (13)
allocates the cost of link l in Figure 1, where t is the trans-
mitter and r1 through r7 are the receivers. For simplicity,
we assume that receiver ri obtains i BU for one TU, and
that the bandwidth on link l costs one MU per BU and TU.
Now we have
c
= 1
nd = 3
b
= {0, 1, 2, 3},
which when substituted into equation (13) give the cost of
link l being allocated to receiver r1, r2, and r3 as follows,

respectively. To make the calculations easier to follow, the
costs are presented for every bandwidth interval, and costs
arising from the same link are grouped together by paren-
theses.
The costs allocated to all the seven receivers in the mul-
ticast tree are presented in Table 1, together with the cor-
responding costs produced by the ETS, ELSD, and QoS-D
ETS cost-allocation mechanisms.
The ETS and ELSD mechanisms were not designed with
differentiated QoS demands in mind. Both these mecha-
nisms will therefore generally allocate disproportionately
large parts of the cost to receivers with low QoS demands.
The ETS mechanism simply splits the aggregated cost of
the entire multicast tree equally among all the receivers, and
is therefore also unfair towards receivers with short trans-
mission paths. The ELSD mechanism only splits the link
costs among downstream receivers, and the receivers that
are treated most unfairly are consequently those with low
QoS demands, compared to the receivers with whom they
share the links. Examples of such mistreated receivers are
consequently r1, r2, and r5.

The QoS-D ETS mechanism performs differently, as it
is now the receivers with short transmission paths, such
as r4 and r7, that are treated unfairly. The situation is worst
for r7, which obtains the highest QoS level, and therefore
has to share the costs of the entire multicast tree.
6.2. Bid-based link split downstream
As mentioned previously, the proposed QoS-D LSD
cost-allocation mechanism attempts to achieve optimum
fairness, but it has one possibly severe shortcoming: Op-
timum fairness may not be the primary interest of the re-
ceivers if it is at the expense of higher costs. If poor and
greedy receivers get a discount on the service, it may ac-
tually become cheaper for the rest of the receivers. Here
we further investigate this issue and propose an alternative
cost-allocation mechanism that solves the shortcoming.
We start by drawing a parallel to an everyday situation.
Children and/or retired people often receive a discount on
the entrance fee to sport events, festivals, and museums etc.
Most people are willing to accept this since it typically does
not negatively affect their fees. As long as the events are
not sold out, the economy of the organizers might actually
beneﬁt from this, and thereby allow them to also lower the
standard fees1.
However, if the scenario was the opposite and the at-
tendance of discounted groups had a negative inﬂuence on
standard fees, i.e. forcing the regular visitors to subsidize
those on discounted rates, few would be happy about ac-
cepting such a system. Consumer goods are seldom dis-
counted in this manner, since they are associated with spe-
ciﬁc material and production costs.
1If any organizers actually do this in reality is a completely different
question.

If we look at the game-theoretic approaches of Section 3,
the SV mechanism allocates the costs in a LSD manner, and
therefore shares the aforementioned shortcoming. The MC
mechanism on the other hand does not require the receivers
to cover more than their marginal cost. It is consequently
not budget balanced, and may thereby produce a ﬁnancial
deﬁcit for the ISPs.
We propose a bid-based cost-allocation mechanism,
where fair cost allocation according to the QoS-D LSD
mechanism is retained as the target. However, bids that
do not cover the receivers’ fair shares of the costs, but do
cover at least the additional cost associated with receivers’
requests, are also accepted. That is, the additional cost for
providing the receiver with the requested service, compared
to the cost of providing the service to the existing set of
receivers.
The main difference between marginal cost and addi-
tional cost is that the latter is dependent upon the order of
the arrival of the bids which, in turn, guarantees that the pro-
posed mechanism is budget balanced. However, although
an expansion of the user set never causes increased costs
for users within the original set, the mechanism is not cross
monotonic, since it only applies to ordered sets of users.
A placed bid consequently leads to one of the outcomes
described in Table 2. The fair share is the cost calculated
according to the principles of the QoS-D LSD mechanism,
with the addendum that if some poor receivers are dis-
counted, these costs have to be carried by the wealthier re-
ceivers. The costs not covered by a receiver are distributed
between the affected links and QoS levels of the existing
transmission tree, proportional to that receiver’s fair cost
shares, and are split among the higher-bidding receivers uti-
lizing these resources. The proposed mechanism is called
bid-based link split downstream (BB LSD).
6.2.1. Bid structure. There are a number of mandatory
parameters that a bid must contain to make the BB LSD
possible, namely:
• the maximum acceptable cost of the transmission
• the requested duration of the transmission

• the requested QoS level of the transmission
• the time to live (TTL) of the bid
It is insufﬁcient to replace the maximum cost and re-
quested duration with a maximum cost per TU. This would
prevent the calculation of other receivers’ maximum costs,
since these are affected by receivers who leave the service
prematurely. There is also a possibility of non-recurrent
costs associated with setting up the service. The bid TTL
is required since most users are only interested in a partic-
ular service if it can be started within a given amount of
time.
A receiver may request a service at a particular price, but
be willing to settle for a poorer QoS level at a lower price if
the main bid cannot be accepted. The main bid could then
possibly remain effective during its TTL, in case the costs
associated with it were to be reduced. We observe that there
may be as many subbids as there are QoS levels, but do not
discuss these composite bids any further.
6.2.2. Strategyproofness. The BB LSD mechanism is not
strategy proof. There is an obvious risk that users place dis-
honestly low bids, i.e. bids that do not correspond to their
estimated value of the service, in an attempt to ﬁnd the min-
imum cost of the service. To avoid this destructive behavior
for the system, we propose an upper limit on the bid fre-
quency of any particular receiver. This might not make the
mechanism strategy proof, but it should make users more
honest, since a lower bid equals a higher risk of missing out
on the service for a particular amount of time.
The problem of ﬁnding a sufﬁcient maximum bid fre-
quency is a weighing of the honesty of the bids against the
adaptability of the mechanism. It is possible that the eco-
nomic prerequisites of a receiver change for the better after
a low bid has been placed. An alternative to a ﬁxed maxi-
mum bid frequency, is to exponentially increase the period
of time until a new bid might be placed or considered.
Figure 2. The multicast transmission tree of
the example in subsection 6.3.
6.3. A cost-allocation example
The transmission tree in Figure 2 is used as an exam-
ple in order to shed some light on the possible advantages
of the BB LSD cost-allocation mechanism. The requested
QoS levels are outlined in Table 3, together with the maxi-
mum total cost that the receivers are willing to pay for the
service. For simplicity, assume that all requests concern the
same duration, say 10 TU, and that the bandwidth on all
links cost one MU per BU and TU. Further assume that the
bitrate is the predominant cost factor and that QoSq con-
stantly requires q BU. The incremental cost of transmitting
QoSq, when compared to that of QoSq−1, is consequently
one MU/TU per link.
In the two ﬁrst subsections, the QoS-D LSD and MC
cost-allocation mechanisms are utilized to allocate the
bandwidth and costs, and in the third subsection, these pa-
rameters are calculated according to the proposed BB LSD
mechanism. For the latter mechanism, the order of arrival
of the bids is essential. For simplicity, we base the order
on the receiver numbers, and assume the arrivals of the
bids to be sufﬁciently closely spaced in time for the re-
quested transmissions to be considered simultaneously from
a cost-sharing perspective. The results of the cost-allocation
mechanisms are compared in the last subsection.
6.3.1. Allocation according to QoS-D LSD. We start by
studying how the QoS-D LSD mechanism would allocate
the cost of link l2, under the assumption that all receivers
are able to obtain the requested service at prices not ex-
ceeding their maximum costs. According to equation (12),
receiver r1 will be charged
10
3 ≈ 3.33 MU
for receiving QoS1, since there are three receivers utilizing

this information. In the same manner, the cost of link l2
allocated to receivers r2 and r3, which are requesting QoS2
respectively QoS3, become

and

The cost of each receiver can be calculated link by link
from the source. The total costs of receivers r1 through r4

respectively. To make the calculations easier to follow, the
costs arising from the same link are grouped by parentheses.
Apparently, the assumption that all receivers are able to
obtain the service, at a cost not exceeding their maximum
limits, was false. Receiver r2 is only willing to pay 25 MU,
but would be charged over 44 MU. It will therefore not ob-
tain the service, and the rest of the receivers will conse-
quently have to cover a larger part of the costs on the shared
links. Receivers r1, r3, and r4 will now be charged

Hence, the cost allocated to receiver r3 exceeds its bid of
80 MU, and it will also fail to obtain the requested service.

respectively. Finally, all the costs are covered by the re-
ceivers’ bids.
6.3.2.
Allocation according to MC. The MC cost-
allocation mechanism has received its name because it al-
locates the marginal cost to each user. The marginal cost of
a user is the additional cost of providing the service to that
user, when compared to the cost of providing the service to
the remaining set of users.
In this example the marginal cost of receiver r1 corre-
sponds to that of QoS1 on link l3, i.e. 10 MU, since r2 and
r3 also utilize QoS1 on the rest of the transmission path
from the source to r1. On link l1, QoS1 is also utilized by
receiver r4.
In the same manner, the marginal cost of receiver r2
is derived from the provision of QoS2 on link l5, that is
20 MU. On the rest of the transmission path from the source
to r2, QoS2 is shared by receiver r3.
Receiver r3 is allocated the total cost for QoS3 on its last
hop link l6, which corresponds to 30 MU. Further, on links
l2 and l4, r3 is the only receiver that utilizes QoS3. It there-
fore has to cover the additional cost of QoS3, when com-
pared to that of QoS2, on these links. This implies a cost
of 10 MU per link. However, r3 does not have to contribute
to the costs of l1, since QoS3 is shared with receiver r4 on
that link. The aggregated cost allocated to receiver r3 is
consequently 50 MU.
Finally, receiver r4 is charged with the total cost of QoS4
on link l7 and the additional cost of QoS4 on link l1. This
adds up to a total of 50 MU, and all receivers will therefore
be served since the maximum costs of their bids cover the
allocated costs.
6.3.3. Allocation according to BB LSD. Now the proposed
BB LSD cost-allocation mechanism is applied to the same
example.
When the bid of receiver r1 is placed, its maximum cost
of 25 MU is insufﬁcient to cover the cost of the requested
QoS1, which is calculated to 30 MU over the three-link
transmission path from the source. The bid is therefore not
accepted, but remains effective, pending other bids that may
share the costs.
When the bid of receiver r2 arrives, the costs associated
with its request for QoS2 is 80 MU. The bid is on 25 MU,
and can therefore not be accepted either, not even when con-
sidered jointly with the bid of r1.
Then the bid of receiver r3 is placed. It concerns QoS3
and is worth 80 MU, whereas the cost for offering the ser-
vice is 120 MU. The total cost for serving r1, r2, and r3
would be 150 MU, whereas their joint means are calculated
as being 130 MU. Separately considering r1 and r3, or r2
and r3, does not make the situation more favorable.
Finally, the bid of receiver r4 is placed. The costs for

11
International Journal On Advances in Telecommunications, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
the requested transmission to r4 is 80 MU, and the bid on
100 MU can therefore be accepted on its own. However, to
decide what costs will actually be allocated to r4, the bids
of the other receivers must ﬁrst be reconsidered.
Let us start by considering receiver r2. The costs of the
resources that r2 must cover in total, i.e. those of link l5, are
20 MU according to the last parenthesis of equation (14). It
therefore has 5 MU left to contribute to the cost sharing on
the upstream links. These 5 MU will be split uniformly ac-
cording to r2’s fair shares of the costs on these links, which
corresponds to the remaining ﬁrst three parenthesis of (14).
This results in

for QoS1 on l1, and in the same manner approximately
0.69 MU for QoS2 on l1 and QoS1 on l2, and 1.03 MU
for QoS2 on l2, and QoS1 and QoS2 on l4.
Receiver r3 must cover the entire 30 MU for link l6 and
the remaining costs on l4. Further, it also has to cover the
additional cost of QoS3 on l2 together with the remaining
cost for QoS2. Consequently, there are approximately
80 − 30 − (30 − 2· 1.03) − (20 − 1.03) ≈ 3.09 MU
left on the bid of r3. Split uniformly according to r3’s re-
maining costs shares, which can be found in equation (15),
this yields

Consequently, receiver r1 that only requested QoS1, has
to cover 10 MU on link l3 and the remaining costs on l2,
which is approximately
10 − 0.69 − 0.73 = 8.58 MU.
On link l1, r1 will be charged with its own fair share of
the costs, plus its share of the costs for QoS1 that are not
covered by r2 and r3. This adds up to

6.3.4. Comparison of results. In Table 4, the outcomes
for the receivers with the proposed BB LSD cost-allocation
mechanism are presented together with them of MC and
QoS-D LSD.
The most obvious difference between the BB LSD and
QoS-D LSD mechanisms is that receivers r2 and r3 are
served by BB LSD but not by QoS-D LSD, since they can-
not fully cover their fair shares of the costs. As a conse-
quence, the costs allocated to receivers r1 and r4 are some-
what lower for the BB LSD mechanism, where receiver r3
contributes to the cost sharing on links l1 and l2. Another,
more signiﬁcant effect, which is apparent in Table 5, is that
the income of the ISP is doubled through the use of the
BB LSD mechanism.
The BB LSD and MC mechanisms serve the same user
sets. However, all the receivers are allocated lower costs by
using the MC mechanism, since it only charges the marginal
costs. As can be seen in Table 5, the result is, if not a
ﬁnancial deﬁcit, at least a 70 MU reduction of the ISP’s
revenue, when compared to the budget-balanced BB LSD
mechanism.

7. Conclusion
This paper has aimed at more efﬁcient usage of band-
width in IP networks. The area that has been targeted is the
slow deployment of multicast transmission. The proposal
was to reduce the costs for users of multicast sessions. The
cost reduction is brought about by the resource savings of-
fered by the bandwidth sharing.
Fair cost sharing among multicast receivers has been ad-
dressed. This would favor the multicast receivers under the
assumption that fair cost sharing should be based upon re-
source usage. Two major resource-related factors were ob-
served; the transmission path and the bandwidth or QoS re-
quirements. Existing cost-allocation mechanisms for mul-
ticast were evaluated, but none took both these parameters
into consideration. The QoS-D LSD cost-allocation mech-
anism was therefore proposed. It considers both the trans-
mission path and the QoS requirements, in order to achieve
optimum fairness.
However, optimum fairness might not be in the best in-
terest of the users, when it is at the expense of higher costs.
An alternative cost-allocation mechanism, BB LSD, was
therefore proposed. The BB LSD mechanism enables the
users to place bids for a requested service, revealing their
maximum acceptable cost. A bid that does not cover the
user’s fair share of the costs for the requested service is nev-
ertheless accepted if it does cover at least the additional cost
associated with the request. This guarantees that the BB
LSD mechanism is budget balanced. The result is not only
a possible reduction in the costs for the rest of the users, but
also an increase in revenue for the ISPs, which are able to
serve more users.
Unfortunately, the BB LSD mechanism is not strategy
proof. To avoid users seeking the minimum cost by placing
dishonestly low bids, an upper limit on the bid frequency
of any particular receiver was therefore proposed. Another
alternative would be an exponentially growing time out in
the case of a rejected bid. This should make the users more
honest, i.e. to bid closer to what the service is worth to
them, since a lower bid equals a higher risk of missing out
on the service.
7.1. Future work
Future research about cost-allocation mechanisms may
involve the problem of ﬁnding a sufﬁcient maximum bid
frequency, or other procedures to mitigate the fact that the
BB LSD mechanism is not strategy proof. Another alter-
native might be the search for a completely new mechanism
that is naturally strategy proof and still possesses as many of
the BB LSD mechanism’s attractive properties as possible.
Further research topics are the implementation of the
QoS-D LSD and BB LSD cost-allocation mechanisms, and
the process of actually charging the receivers with the allo-
cated costs.
