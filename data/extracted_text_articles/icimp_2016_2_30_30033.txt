Summary— Routing is the function of seeking a path between 
all possible in a packet network topologies which have great 
connectivity. Because it comes to find the best possible route, 
the first step is to define what constitutes best route and 
consequently what is the metric to measure it. This parameter 
and the operation of the routing protocol itself give us the 
protocol performance. This work presents a comparative study 
of three of the most used routing protocols, i.e., Routing 
Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) 
and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) in 
ring topologies. Through this study, the performance of each 
routing protocol is analyzed. To this purpose, we have used a 
network simulator known as GNS3 that allows simulating 
different network scenarios using real operating systems (IOS) 
of CISCO equipment. We have simulated a topology with these 
three protocols in order to observe and analyze the network 
behaviour, traffic flow, time of routes updating and network 
convergence. As results show, RIP presents the lowest time for 
initializing the network while OSPF is the protocol that 
presents highest time in initializing process of network. Finally, 
EIGRP shows the best convergence time after the first fault in 
the network.

 INTRODUCCIÓN 
Routing is the process through which a router determines 
the best route of a data packet to reach a destination. This 
packet passes through several devices so that the network 
destination is different to the origin network. There are two 
types of routes, i.e., statics and dynamics routes. Static routes 
are those that are configured by hand or are specified by 
default and do not have any reaction to new routes or falling 
sections of the network routes. However, a router with 
dynamic routing is able to understand the network and pass 
routes between neighbouring routers. The network through 
routers with dynamic routing is responsible for specifying 
the access to new nodes on the network or adapts and 
modifies the access to certain parts of the network due to the 
fall of any link or node seeking an alternative optimal route 
[1]. 
Routing protocols are algorithms that allow to determine 
and to select the best route upon which the network traffic 
will be send from one network to another. To this end, these 
algorithms use different information associated to links, such 
as bandwidth, delay, load, reliability, number of hops or cost, 
among others [2]. In this way, the exchange of information 
between the equipment can generate the existing network 
topology and determine the best links to be used to reach a 
specific destination. 
Routing protocols are subdivided in two types, distance 
vector and link state. On the one hand distance vector 
algorithms use the Bellman-Ford algorithm. It searches the 
path of lowest cost by the indirect method search. The 
distance vector associated to a network node is a control 
packet that contains the distance to the nodes of the network 
known so far. Each node sends its neighbours the distances 
that knows through this packet. The neighbouring nodes 
examine this information and compare it with the 
information they already have updating its routing table, if 
necessary. Some examples of distance-vector protocols are 
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) (version 1 and 2), 
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) and Enhanced 
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). On the other 
hand, link status algorithms are based on each node gets to 
know the network topology and costs (delays) associated 
with the links. From these data, nodes can obtain the tree and 
the routing table after apply the minimum cost algorithm 
(Dijkstra algorithm). Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and 
Intermediate system to intermediate system (IS-IS) protocols 
are examples of link state protocols. 
Because of the complex operation of these algorithms, it 
is necessary understanding the protocols operation in order to 
select the more adequate protocol for the designed network. 
Additionally to the basic operation, researchers usually 
modify some of these features in order to provide 
improvements in energy consumption in the transmission of 
information [3] [4] and the own consumption of network 
devices [5]. 
On the other hand, it is important to know the most 
appropriate sort of topology that our network needs. We can 
find Simple topologies such as bus, star or ring topology and 
more complex structures as mesh networks. Besides these 
topologies, they can be combined for grouping nodes in 
clusters [6] or in groups [7]. 
Networks with ring topologies offer one grade of 
redundancy to a possible fail so that if one link fails, it is 
possible to maintain the communication between all network 
nodes. This fact is essential in backbone networks [8]. In a 
backbone network with ring topology where dynamic routing 
with default values is configured, every node of the ring, 
after the network has converged, has a data base with the 
information about the network routes toward every node,

where there will be information about how to arrive to the 
destination for two routes with equal cost. It is known as 
redundancy. 
The time that a routing protocol takes to calculate the 
route to achieve the destination, as well as the convergence 
time to start data transmission after a failure and recovery 
time are different depending on the protocol and the mode 
that it exchanges information about the network topology. 
For this reason, some protocols will have better performance 
than another. 
Taking into account all of these issues, in this paper, we 
are going to perform a comparative analysis with three 
routing protocols, RIP, OSPF and EIGRP, in order to check 
which one offer the best performance when a ring topology 
is used. To do this, we are going to use a network simulator 
called GNS3 [9]. These protocols are used in a ring topology 
composed by 5 routers and a computer that monitors all 
events. The tests are performed in terms of convergence time 
when network begins to work, recovery time after a failure 
and network response when one or two links register a 
failure. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
shows some previous studies where these protocols have 
been analyzed. Section 3 presents the protocols RIP, OSPF, 
and EIGRP that we have used in our test bench and 
simulations. The simulation scenario and some previous 
measurements are shown in Section 4. Section 5 shows the 
result of our study. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusion 
and future work.

RELATED WORK 
There is a big number of previous works where routing 
protocols are studied and evaluated using network 
simulators. There are several network simulators which are 
widely used in telecommunications such as OPNET, 
OMNET, NS-2 or NS-3, among others. Some of them are 
free and other ones can only be used under license. In any 
case, the most important thing is that these simulators should 
offer results as realistic as possible [10]. This Section shows 
some of these works. 
G. S. Aujla and S. S. Kang [11] performed a study and 
analysis of several routing protocols over Mobile ad hoc 
networks (MANETs). Authors used OPNET simulation to 
test the operation of five well known routing protocols as Ad 
Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source 
Routing (DSR), Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm 
(TORA), Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and 
Geographic Routing Protocol (GRP). The protocols 
performance was measured on the basis of throughput, delay, 
load and data dropped metrics. In addition, the work was 
focussed on the e-mail and video conferencing traffic 
generating applications by increasing the number of nodes. 
As a result of this study, we can see that AODV is the one 
which present better results for video conferencing when a 
low number of nodes. However, OLSR protocol shows good 
results for email traffic  
K. Yao et al. [12] presented a real-time testbed for 
routing network (ARTNet) in order to evaluate the 
requirements that routing protocols should present. As 
authors state ARTNet supports some of the most popular 
routing protocols used in typical applications in a cost-
effective way. To test the good operation of ARTNet, 
authors have performed several simulations with two popular 
routing protocols, EIGRP and OSPF based on quantitative 
metrics, i.e., packet loss and delta time for standard 
application services. The results of this study demonstrate 
that EIGRP presents converge time faster for HTTP and FTP 
applications when the primary link for a subnet suffers a 
fault. This kind of simulators and proposal are a good tool 
that allows users to easily make different network 
configurations. 
M. I. Ashraf et al. [13] presented a comparative analysis 
of OSPF and EIGRP. Authors study the network 
performance of these protocols in enterprise environments. 
The study was performed at simulation level using OPNET 
Modeler. Along the paper, authors explained the main 
features that a protocol should present in order to be used in 
big networks that manage the information in corporative and 
enterprise environments. The study evaluated OSPF and 
EIGRP performance in terms of convergence time, 
scalability and resources Utilization through the simulated 
network models. As results shows, EIGRP seems to be more 
scalable in terms of routing domain size. On the other hand, 
OSPF is more efficient in terms of router and CPU 
utilization, message processing, routing table size and the 
traffic load through the network. In terms of convergence 
time, EIGRP is faster than OSPF. This report can be 
understood as a user guide to use EIGRP, OSPF in certain 
circumstances. 
There are several comparative studies where more 
complex topologies have been studied, but we have not 
found studies of routing protocols in ring topologies. 
However, there are interesting proposals based on ring 
topologies such as [14] where authors presented a set of test 
benches to study the TCP/IP interaction based on congestion 
price for evaluating the stability and optimality in ring 
topologies and [15] where X. Li describes a particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) algorithm using a ring neighborhood 
topology, which does not require any niching parameters. 
For this reason and because of the features of this kind of 
topologies, we have decided to perform this work.

ROUTING PROTOCOLS 
This section presents some of the most widely used 
routing protocols. For each protocol, it is explained the main 
characteristics as well as default values of each parameter 
that these protocols use when they are running. 
A. RIP and RIP V2 
RIP [16] is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) used by 
routers to exchange information about IP networks that are 
connected. This protocol is based on the distance vector 
algorithm and it uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to 
send information through the network. The router that uses 
this protocol has a limited knowledge about the network 
information. This protocol uses the hops number mechanism 
to determine the best route. It supports up to 15 hops to avoid 
routing loops. A route with 16 hops is considered a route as 
39

unreachable or not desirable. This fact limits the network 
size. It is a popular protocol due its simplicity and easy 
configuration. However, the main problem lies in the 
convergence times and scalability limitations, so it has a 
better performance in small networks [17]. 
On the other hand, RIPV2 [18] was created due to the 
necessity of supporting variable length subnet masks 
(VLSM) and other requirements enhanced in respect to its 
first version. In addition to including VLSM, RIPV2 
supports the process of routes authentication and it 
incorporates the routes updating making use of multicast 
packets, classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) and the 
updating by trigger. It keeps the sending of updating packets 
each 30 seconds and a limit of 15 hops. It uses the same port 
UDP, i.e., the port 520, and it uses the strategies of inverse 
poisoning and counting to infinite to prevent loops, as the 
first version of RIP [19]. 
Unlike other protocols, RIP is a free protocol to be used 
by different routers and not only by a single one owner such 
as EIGRP which was developed by Cisco Systems. Table I 
[20] shows a summary of the default parameters of RIP 
protocol. 
TABLE I.

It is a initialized timer when a route is 
inserted in the routing table. When this 
time expires the route is invalid. 
180 s. 
Flush 
It marks that a route must be removed of 
routing table. This value must be bigger 
that the value to the invalid route.  
240 s. 
Holddown 
It is used to avoid that one route has been 
marked as valid immediately after of it had 
marked as invalid. During this time the 
actualizations respect to the invalid route 
are ignored. 
180 s. 
Announcing’s 
methods 
It specifies the mechanisms that the router 
uses to communicate with its neighbours. 
1- No filtering: Announce the routes for all 
its neighbours. 
2- Split horizon: Do not announce a route 
to one neighbour from which it was 
learned. 
3- Split horizon with poison reverse: 
Announce the route to the neighbour of 
which it was learned with a metric to 
infinite or 16 maximum.

B. OSPF 
OSPF [21] is a link state routing protocol that uses the 
algorithm short path first (SPF) to calculate the best route to 
the destination node. It is one of the most widely used 
hierarchical protocols due to its significant scalability.  
OSPF keeps all network information in its routing table. 
For this reason, it requires a major level of processing and 
memory. The header of OSPF packets includes the source 
and destination address. OSPF uses multicast as destination 
address and sends many message types including hello 
messages, link state requests and updates and database 
descriptions. Djisktra’s algorithm is used to specify the 
shortest path to the destination. SPF calculations are 
computed either periodically or upon a received Link State 
Advertisement (LSA). This fact depends on the protocol 
implementation. The protocol operation is based on 5 
different types of link states packets (LSP’s). These packets 
help the protocol to distinguish between its neighbours and 
update the routing information of link states. The routers of a 
network that runs OSPF can have different roles as a 
function of its position. These roles are internal router, 
backbone router, edge area router and autonomous systems 
(AS) router. OSPF uses the accumulated bandwidth as metric 
from the source interface to destination interface to calculate 
the cost. Finally, it is important to know that OSPF supports 
VLSM [17]. Contrary to RIP, however, OSPF has the 
disadvantage of being too complicated. Table II shows a 
summary of the main parameters of OSPF protocol [20].

C. EIGRP 
EIGRP [22] is an advanced routing protocol based on 
distance vector, owned by Cisco Systems, which offers the 
best characteristics of both distance vector and link state 
algorithms. This protocol can only be used in Cisco routers. 
It is a fast convergence routing protocol and extremely 
scalable for medium and big networks. In addition, EIGRP 
implements CIDR and VLSM. It is considered an advanced 
protocol because it is based on features commonly associated 
with link-state protocols and although it may serve as it, the 
fact is that EIGRP is a distance vector routing protocol. 
EIGRP uses some of the best features of OSPF, such as 
partial updates and neighbor discovery.

The key of its good performance is use of the Diffusing 
Update ALgorithm (DUAL) for updating routes. Through it, 
this protocol achieves an exceptional and rapid network 
convergence. The metrics takes into account the bandwidth, 
load, feasibility and delay. It keeps the routes’ information 
and topology’s network details in three different tables called 
neighbour table, topology table and routing table [4]. This 
algorithm uses the neighbour table and the topology table to 
develop the routing table in the EIGRP router. The topology 
table is created by the finite states machine of DUAL using 
the collected information of its routers neighbours. With the 
available information of the topology table, DUAL calculates 
the best route to the router destination and it makes that link 
as successor. DUAL also calculates the feasible successor 
(second best link free of loops) if it is available. Although 
EIGRP does not guarantee the use of the best route, this 
protocol is rather used because it is easier to configure than 
OSPF.

protocol [20].

protocol. 
IV. 
SIMULATION ENVIROMENT 
In order to evaluate the performance of each protocol, we 
have implemented a basic ring topology. This topology and 
response times of each router are shown in this Section. 
As Figure 1 shows, the topology is composed by 5 
routers linked by Fast Ethernet interfaces. In this case, the 
devices used are Cisco routers with the Cisco IOS Release 
12.4(13b) for 2691 service Platform with IP Base. To 
perform the simulations, a personal computer (PC) is 
connected to the ring topology. Each router has, at least, 2 
network interfaces except the router R1 which needs one 
more interface to connect the PC. This PC is in charge of 
monitoring all network events making use of the 
management software. Figure 1 also shows the subnet 
network and the physical interfaces that connects each 
router. 
To design the network addressing, we have used VLSM. 
We have defined 5 subnets with subnet mask /30 starting 
from the class B address 172.30.10.0/16. 
In order to see the initial performance of this network, we 
have configured static routes in each router. After that, a ping 
is transmitted from Host 1 to each router following the route 
with lowest cost. Figure 2 shows the Round Trip Time 
(RTT) in ms. where routers are configured with static routes. 
With the value of RTT, it is easy to measure the time during 
which part of the network does not have connectivity. We 
can also compare the times for symmetric routes. 
From these results, we can calculate the average response 
time to reach each router (See Figure 3). Figure 3 also shows 
the percentage of packet loss. In this case, because we are 
working static routes and a very simple network, we do not 
register packet losses. If results are analyzed, we can observe 
that the biggest response time is registered by the farthest 
network to R1, i.e., the route up to network 172.30.10.12/30 
through the interface F0/1 of router R3. We can observe that 
the minimum response time is established to reach the router 
R1 in 21 ms, and the maximum time is 64 ms to reach the 
node R3. In addition, it is important to see that this value is 
doubled when two hopes are needed to reach the destination.

It is easy to see that symmetric routes, such as PC to R5 
and PC to R2, present a difference of average response time 
of 10ms. If we analyze both, route from PC to R3 and route 
from PC to R4 this difference between the average response 
times is lower. 
V. 
PROTOCOLS’ EVALUATION 
This Section presents several tests where RIP, OSPF and 
EIGRP are evaluated. Protocols are evaluated in terms of 
recovery time after a network failure. This Section also 
analyzes the different states that a network running a routing 
protocol can suffer, i.e., event of updating messages, event of 
network initialization, network failure and network recovery. 
When configuring the routing protocols with its default 
parameters, routers calculate 4 optimal routes to reach the no 
adjacent networks from each router. Because we have a ring 
topology, each router only has two optimal routes to reach 
the farthest network to each node. To evaluate the 
performance of each routing protocol, we need to determine 
the learning and route publication time and the ring network 
convergence, in three different stages: (1) at the beginning of 
network operation, (2) when a dropped link is registered and 
(3) when this link is restored. The failure point has been 
established in the link between router R1 and R5. When the 
network starts, routers have to calculate and learn the two 
optimal routes to reach the two non adjacent networks in 
both directions through the interfaces of each router with a 
same cost. To determine the recalculating times of routes and 
the network convergence as a result of a dropped link, the 
monitoring point is established in the farthest network from 
router R5, i.e., Host 1 is used to monitor the network activity. 
The failure point is established in the fast Ethernet interface 
0/1 (F0/1) of router R5. After generating the failure, the link 
is reconnected and restored. The time elapsed between the 
failure generation and the communication re-establishment 
will give us the time of network inactivity time which will 
consider the convergence time and some additions 
milliseconds that the devices will need to route the packets. 
As packets, we have used pings with the parameters by 
default. 
A. Evaluation of RIP 
In order to evaluate the network performance when RIP 
is running, we have generated a failure in the link between 
the R1 and R5. After that, the link is restored. To evaluate 
the restoring time of this protocol, we have sent a continuous 
ping between Host 1 and each router. Figure 4 shows the 
RTT in ms. of each ping between Host 1 and each router. As 
we showed in Figure 1, R4 and R5 are reached through the 
shortest path, i.e., R4 is reached through R5. As Fig. 4 
shows, the disconnection and restoration of link is generated 
at 25th second. From this moment, the network needs around 
475 s to recover the communication with R4 and R5. We can 
also observe that R1, R2 and R3 have not lost the 
connectivity with Host 1 although the RTT of their ping has 
slightly increased. This is because the protocol needs to 
inform to the rest of routers about the new path to reach R4 
and R5. The RTT for R4 and R5 has increased about 110 
milliseconds. 
Table IV shows the response times evaluated for this 
protocol, in the different phases of its operation.

B. Evaluation of OSPF 
In order to evaluate the restoring time of OSPF, we have 
sent a continuous ping between Host 1 and each router. In 
this case we have generated 2 failures in the same link. The 
second one is generated after restoring the network 
communication of the first failure. Fig. 5 shows the RTT in 
ms. of each ping between Host 1 and each router after the 
first failure. Figure 5 shows that the disconnection and 
restoration of link is generated at 7th second. From this 
moment, the network needs around 50 s to recover the 
communication with R5 and around 10 s to recover the 
communication with R4. We can also observe that R1, R2 
and R3 have not lost the connectivity with Host 1. However, 
the RTT of their ping has increased around 10-15 ms. After 
restoring the communications with R4 and R5, the RTT is 
around 110 ms for R4 and 140 ms for R5.

Figure 7.  EIGRP data convergence before the failure 
After generating the second fault and restoring it in the 
same link (in 15th second), we have observed that the 
network only needs 7 seconds to establish the connectivity 
(See Figure 6). This is because the routing tables already 
contain the alternative route to reach R4 and R5. The RTT 
values are similar to Figure 5. 
Table V shows the response times registered for OSPF 
protocol, in the different stages.

As Table V shows, the response times improve after the 
second failure. This is because the routing tables maintain 
the information about how to reach R4 and R5. The 
calculation of alternative routes is faster than the previous 
situation. The elapsed time without communication is the 
time that routers need to switch to the alternative route. 
C. Evaluation of EIGRP 
To evaluate the network performance when EIGRP is 
running, we have generated an only failure in the link 
between the R1 and R5. Figure 7 shows the RTT in ms. of 
each ping between Host 1 and each router. The disconnection 
and restoration of link is generated at 5th second. From this 
moment, the network needs around 12 s to recover the 
communication from Host 1 to R4 and R5. R1, R2 and R3 
have not lost the connectivity with Host 1. The RTT of pings 
for R1, R2 and R3 are around 28 ms, 52 ms. and 75 ms, 
respectively. The average value of RTT for R4 is about 91 
ms and for R5 is 111ms. 
Finally, Table VI shows the different response times for 
EIGRP protocol in its different stages it needs to correctly 
work.

As observed, EiGRP presents the lowest times compared

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have analyzed the network performance 
of ring topology when RIP, OSPF and EIGRP protocols are 
executed. 
After evaluating these routing protocols, we should 
highlight several aspects of ring topologies as a function of 
the routing protocol it runs. On the one hand, RIP presents a 
good response time at the beginning of the network activity 
while its performance decreases after a failure. RIP requires 
higher time in the network establishing, when the network is 
recovered from the failure.

On the hand, OSPF has a higher time in the network 
starting, but unlike of RIP, its performance improves after 
the first failure. It also improves its convergence time, even 
when a second failure is registered in the same link. OSPF 
registers better times response that the ones registered by 
EIGRP. 
The simulations shows that after a failure the ring routers 
converge in an asynchronous form, i.e., the connectivity with 
the other routers is restoring according to time that each 
router needs to calculate the new optimal route.  
EIGRP recorded the best convergence times of the ring 
after a failure and it also presents the best RTT when it is 
restored. 
As future work, we would like to extend the comparative 
analysis of routing protocols for mesh topologies [23] in 
order to check their behaviour after a failure and the impact 
of this fact over the network efficiency. In addition, we have 
also found interesting approaches related to genetic 
algorithms based on ring topologies [24] and we would like 
to explore this possibility to improve the efficiency of sensor 
networks.
