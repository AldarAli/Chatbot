Abstract— 5G standard is targeting much higher data rates
as compared to existing wireless technologies to accommodate
the ever-increasing demand for faster wireless applications. A
transmitter is required to implement a 5G system. In this
paper, we are presenting a 28 GHz novel monolithic transmitter
architecture on GaN substrate that offers size, weight, area,
power, and cost advantages. The transmitter contains a Yagi
antenna, which consists of three directors, two drivers, a strip
line feed, a substrate, and a ground plane. Optimization is
obtained by modifying components design parameters. According
to simulation results, the designed Yagi antenna has a compact
size, and low loss at the selected frequency of 28 GHz. At
this frequency, its return loss, gain, and beam width are -
38 dB, 8.69 dB, and 57.2 degrees, respectively. The second
component in the monolithic chain is a bandpass ﬁlter, which
offers enhanced selectivity and stopband suppression on GaN
substrate. The Bandpass ﬁlter has a minimum insertion loss of
0.6 dB at 28 GHz. The rejection level is higher than 10 dB in
the stop band. Further, a collaborative simulation of 28 GHz
mixer for upconversion with CLASS-E power ampliﬁer with the
integrated octature structure to achieve robust load insensitivity
is presented. In this paper, to design high-efﬁciency PA, we
implemented harmonic load pull at both the input and output of
the active device to obtain optimum impedances at fundamental
and second-harmonic frequencies. After an iterative process, the
optimum input and output impedances are obtained. In addition,
we also implemented a cascaded octature power cell structure.
The proposed balanced PA achieves a saturated output power of
13.5 dBm and a maximum Power Added Efﬁciency of 55 %. It
consumes 210 mW power. Each power cell is based on class-E.
The circuit is implemented using GaN HEMT transistor taking
an advantage of its high frequency and high power performance.
The presented transmitter conﬁguration is designed at 28 GHz
for 5G Application on a GaN substrate with a thickness of 0.8
mm, a permittivity of 9.7, and loss tangent of 0.025.

INTRODUCTION
Fifth generation wireless network (5G) has become re-
search focus since it could support the explosive growth
of data trafﬁc, massively interconnected devices, and new
applications. It is expected that 5G will utilize spectrum at
millimeter wave (mmw) frequencies to satisfy the demand for
massive bandwidth since the spectrum resources in the lower
frequency bands are running out. mmw frequency is attractive
because of the rich spectrum resources and advantages of size,
weight, and power. Further, there are several motivations to
use mmw frequencies in radio links such as availability of
wider bandwidth, relatively narrow beam widths, better spatial
resolution and small wavelength allowing modest size antennas
to have a small beam width. Resources have been invested to
develop prototype millimeter wave 5G mobile communication
systems, especially for frequency band such as 28 GHz [1].
Therefore, 27.5 to the 29.5 GHz band is a strong candidate
for the new 5G radio interface and much of the research
undertaken to date has considered this band. For example,
Samsung Electronics has built a prototype system including
beamforming antenna that works at 28 GHz [2][3]. However,
to our knowledge single chip transmitter on gallium nitride
(GaN) does not exist for the 5G application.
An overview of the architecture and components for our
transmitter module on a GaN chip is shown in Fig. 1. The
Integrated chip consists of a chain of various individual
components such as yagi antenna, power ampliﬁer, bandpass
ﬁlter, upconverter, mixer and matching circuitry. The presented
transmitter conﬁguration is designed on a GaN substrate with
a thickness of 0.8 mm, a permittivity (Er) of 9.7, and loss
tangent (TanD) of 0.025. The goal is to ultimately fabricate
the proposed transmitter module on GaN substrate.
The Yagi antenna is designed using High-Frequency Struc-
ture Simulator (HFSS) simulation software. Rest of the blocks
of the transmitter, bandpass ﬁlter (BPF), Mixer, Power am-
pliﬁer (PA), and matching network circuitry are designed
using Advanced Design System (ADS) simulation software.
The proposed transmitter design and results are mentioned in
Section II and concluded in Section III.

DESIGN AND RESULT & DISCUSSION OF
TRANSMITTER MODULE ON GAN CHIP
Designing of the transmitter blocks are mentioned here.
A. Yagi Antenna
Yagi antenna was proposed by researchers from Japan
[4][5] usually for radio application [6]. Such antenna was
developed for X-band, Ku-band, and K-band, etc. Generally, a
design of Yagi antenna places a driver and director’s elements
on one side of a printed circuit board (PCB) and places a
reﬂector on the reverse side. A driver is utilized for radiating
electromagnetic wave whilst directors and a reﬂector is utilized
to focus the electromagnetic wave radiation from its driver.
But, the design of Yagi antenna is more challenging if it is
being designed at 28 GHz on GaN substrate instead of PCB.

In this paper, we present the design of novel structure Yagi
antenna, which shows good radiation efﬁciency and gain. The
design of the proposed Yagi antenna is shown in Fig. 2. It is
composed of three directors, two drivers, a strip line for feed
and a reﬂector. This antenna can be conﬁgured in multiple
input and multiple output (MIMO) formats if needed. The
antenna is made from gold with a thickness of 0.035 mm and
electric conductivity of 4.1 x 107 Siemens/m considering GaN
as substrate.
In order to match antenna impedance with another device,
the impedance was optimized for 50 Ω. To fulﬁll such require-
ment, its feed- width was set to be 1.8 mm. Details of the
Yagi antenna design parameters that showed best performance
is shown in Table I.

shows simulated radiation pattern, which is unidirectional with
the main lobe at 342 degrees. At its main lobe, the gain is 8.69
dB. Its beam width is 57.2 degree, which its half power beam

to back ratio of the antenna is nearly 17.4 dB. The antenna 3D
radiation pattern and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) are
shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d, respectively. Usually for a good
antenna VSWR should be below 2. Our simulation shows that
during the passband frequency antennas VSWR is below 1.8.

B. Bandpass Filter Design
Filters are an essential part of wireless communications
systems as they are required to suppress undesired signals in
the transceiver pass-band. The size, weight, cost, and loss of
such ﬁlters must be kept as low as possible. Currently, separate
ﬁlters (low pass, band pass, and high pass) are used to suppress
unwanted signals depending upon system requirements and
they are designed and integrated separately. Hence, there is a
critical need for a multifunction ﬁlter, which can be integrated
on-chip to support multiband operation [13] of a transceiver.
Figure 4. Band pass ﬁlter structure with dimensions
In this paper, the design of a core circuit using a microstrip
line has been conceived and designed as shown in Fig. 4. Small
size, low cost, and good performance multifunction ﬁlters are
the with high selectivity and good stopband performances
are extensively studied [14]. On the other hand, the GaN
substrate has attractive characteristics, such as wide frequency
range, static dielectric constant, low thermal expansion co-
efﬁcient and very low water absorption [15]. Moreover, the
combination of excellent electrical performance, multilayer
integration capabilities and low cost makes GaN extremely
attractive for designing radio frequency (RF) circuits with
high integration [15]. In this paper, a bandpass ﬁlter based on
broadside coupling H-shape resonators and a half wavelength
resonators are implemented on two-layer GaN substrate, which
has relatively small sizes and good selectivity.
The dimensions of the BPF ﬁlter are listed in Table V.

Fig. 5 shows the simulated results of the designed bandpass
ﬁlter. The 3 dB bandwidth is from 27.6 GHz to 29.2 GHz. This
ﬁlter has a minimum insertion loss of 0.6 dB at 28 GHz. The
rejection level is higher than 10 dB in the stop band. The return
loss of bandpass ﬁlter is more than -40 dB at 28 GHz.

A comparison of performances of proposed work BPF with
previously published works is highlighted in Table IV. Return
loss is better than recently published works.
C. Impedance Matching Network
At 28 GHz frequency, the reﬂected power occurs when the
load impedance is not matched to the characteristic impedance
of source (mixer) and load (PA). Impedance matching using the
passive network is critical in the design of microwave circuits
to achieve maximum power transfer, minimum reﬂection, and
adequate harmonic rejection. Traditionally spiral inductors are

preferred instead of resistors and transmission lines to enhance
the thermal noise performance; however, they cannot be used
at high frequency because of the self-resonance and stray
impedances. In addition, they also occupy large on chip space.

In order to overcome such problems, we adopted a new
design strategy in this paper. The proposed approach is based
on closed-form and recursive relationships [16] . The proposed
matching network approach is based on a closed analysis,
allowing the direct synthesis of multi-frequency matching
network through micro-strip lines. Through Smith chart, we
can get a matching network at a certain frequency easily,
maybe an L or Π network is enough.
Theoretical approach: In a resonance circuit, we deﬁne the
loads Q value
QL =

f0 is the resonance frequency; BW is the bandwidth. There
is equal serial input impedance at every circuit node of the
matching networks.

The value of QL is decided by the value of Qn. Therefore, in
order to increase the bandwidth, we should reduce the value
of Qn. While the least Qn is the maximum of the source and
load impedances Q value. When utilizing the Smith chart to
design matching networks at the center frequency, the the next
steps should be followed:
1)
Find out the output impedance Zout of the previous
stage transistor and the input impedance Zin of next
stage transistor.
2)
Find out the points of Zout, Zin in the Smith chart.
3)
Describe the maximum equal Q curve Qmax from the
points of Zou, Zin.
4)
In the extension of the Smith chart constructed by
Qmax, add appropriate micro strips and capacitances
to make Zout and Zin conjugate match.
Then consider the network composed of microstrips as the
initial matching network. We designed such matching network
using ADS. This network is designed to operate at 28 GHz
frequency with the normalized impedance of 50 Ω. Where ZS
is antenna output impedance, ZL is Filter input impedance.
We calculated the stub values mentioned in Fig. 6 using
ADS. Fig. 6 shows the objective function to optimize the whole
matching networks. During 27 GHz to 29 GHz, the maximum
transducer gain limit to 64 dB and the minimum transducer
gain is 63 dB. As a result, we can get a good transducer curve,
whose ﬂatness is less than 0.2 dB at the desired frequency of
28 GHz.
Traditionally Network Response is calculated to check loss
value of circuit. So, we plotted S11 to ﬁnd the loss of the
network schematic, the S11 value at 28 GHz is lower than
-10 dB. To investigate circuit stability and perfect match we
plotted impedance (Fig. 7) on Smith chart as shown in Fig. 7.
D. Mixer Design
Transmit Signal coming from baseband is almost at direct
current (DC), hence it must be upconverted to high frequency
at which the antenna is working. In order to do that signal
must be up-converted using mmw mixer. Doubly-balanced
Mixers (DBM) are usually the desirable mixer because of
their superior suppression of spurious mixing products and
good port-to-port isolation [2]. The mixers based on the ring
or star conﬁgurations balun were used widely, but most of
them are designed for narrow-band only. An ultra-wideband
balanced microstrip balun was reported [17][18], but this type
of balun was difﬁcult to fabricate. A 28 GHz mixer based on
the Marchand balun was fabricated in 0.15m GaAs PHEMT
technology, similar to our proposed design in GaN technology.
In this paper, a 28 GHz doubly-balance mixer based on the
[19] Marchand balun in the 27 GHz to 30 GHz RF/LO range
and DC to 5 GHz IF is presented. The collaborative simulation
of HFSS and ADS has been adopted in mixer design, the balun
in LO port and RF port are simulated by the full-wave the
electromagnetic simulator in HFSS, then the S parameter data
of the balun are exported to the mixer circuit in ADS. The
mixer offers about 10 dB typical conversion loss, high gain
compression, higher than 20 dB LO-to-RF isolations and about
10 dB return loss across 27 GHz to 30 GHz.
1) The Balun Design: The balun was simulated by using
Ansoft HFSS and Agilent ADS. The Marchand balun was
compensated by two open-circuited stubs at the output ports,
the coupled line model in the circuit initially was used to
predict the performance, and then simulated by using the full-
wave electromagnetic simulator to improve the accuracy of
the simulation ﬁnally. The 3D structure of the balun used in
the mixer was drawn by HFSS and shown in Fig. 8, which
is designed for GaN substrate with thickness 0.8 mm and
dielectric constant 9.7. 1 is the input port and 2 3 are output
ports. Impedances of three ports are all set to be 50 Ω and
the microstrip line width is 0.25 mm, and l. w2 and w3 stand
for the length the width and the gap width of the microstrip
lines, the hole is metallization and connected to ground. The
Marchand balun is simulated by optimizing w2 and w3.

IF port is load port, all the port is set to 50 Ω. Two gold
lines are set to near the real condition, the line is set to 5
mm length and the diameter is 0.1 mm.The capacitances are
used in LO port to make the minimal frequency of the IF
port extend to DC. C1=C2=0.5 pF. The simulated result of the
mixer circuit conversion gain was obtained using the harmonic
balance method in Fig. 10. The type conversion gain is about
9.3 dB.

E. Power Ampliﬁer Design
For wireless communication systems, power ampliﬁers
(PAs) with high efﬁciency is critical as they consume the
majority of the power of the systems and closely related
to the thermal problem. As a result, many categories of
high-efﬁciency PAs have been widely studied in recent years
[23][24]. The Class-E ampliﬁer is well known for its high efﬁ-
ciency and simple structure. However, the very high breakdown
voltage of three times the dc supply voltage of the transistor
is required [25]. Moreover, the inherent output capacitor of a
transistor deteriorates the performance of a Class-E ampliﬁer
at high frequency. To address the above problems, the Class-
E ampliﬁer was designed by modifying the device output
impedances at odd and even harmonics, so as to shape the
output voltage and current that minimize the overlap to achieve
high efﬁciency [26]. However, since the openshort impedance
is derived in the inﬁnite harmonic condition, the matching
network of a Class-E ampliﬁer should be able to tune high-
order (beyond third order [27]) harmonics, which make the
circuit implementation more complex.
In this paper, a simple method of designing high-efﬁciency
PA is presented. Compared with other works, this method is
easier to design harmonic tuned PA and thus achieves relatively
high efﬁciency with fewer harmonics to control. The simulated
results indicate a high-efﬁciency Class-E PA is realized with
55% PAE and 13.5 dBm output power at 28 GHz.
However, the challenge of the MMW PA design is to
deliver maximum output power with a maximum Power Added
Efﬁciency (PAE) and high linearity [28][29]. For this pur-
pose, to achieve high efﬁciency, we have implemented two
techniques. Technique one is harmonic load pull conducted
at both the input and output of the active device to obtain
optimum impedances at fundamental and second-harmonic
frequencies. After an iterative process, the optimum input and
output impedances are obtained. Technique two is cascaded
octature power cells structure is implemented. The presented
circuit is implemented in GaN HEMT technology (as shown in
Fig. 12) taking, the advantage of high-frequency performance
and high power performance [15].
Figure 12. GaN HEMT transistor structure
1) Design Process: The design of each PA commenced
with the selection of the transistor size and bias. Increasing
the total gate width of the selected transistor also increases
the available RF output power. However, the higher parasitic
of the physically larger transistor results in a reduction in
available gain. The proven design approach to address this is to
use multiple power-combined transistors. To achieve the target
output power, a total of eight stages were power-combined
in the output stage. This output stage was driven by a pair
of devices, and this, in turn, was driven by an input stage
realized using a single transistor. The transistor sizes in each
stage needed to be identical, and the basic power-combining
topology needed to be similar.
The individual PA structure is shown in Fig. 13 is com-
posed of three series transmission lines with one parallel open-
circuit stub located between the ﬁrst two lines are used as
the impedance matching circuit, which is a simpliﬁed method
of the distributed multi-frequency matching approach, as in-

Figure 14. Octature structure PA design
troduced previously [30]. The single transmission line before
the open stub is used to tune the impedance of the second
harmonic, while the two series transmission lines after the open
stub are used to tune the impedance of the fundamental mode.
Therefore, optimum impedance control at fundamental and
second-harmonic frequencies can be realized simultaneously.

The PA response is clearly evident at the 28 GHz band in

in each band and has a small signal gain of 13.5 dB. The
simulated large-signal performance is plotted in Fig. 16 and 17.
As with the small-signal case, the performance of the ampliﬁer
operating in the 28 GHz band is plotted in red. Power added
efﬁciency is around 55 %. The balanced topology offers a
very good VSWR robustness. DC power consumption of PA
is plotted in Fig. 18; our PA consumes 210 milli watts at 28
GHz.

F. End to End Module Performance
To investigate the loss of proposed the transmitter archi-
tecture, we have simulated S11 of transmitter module chain
(with Yagi antenna, bandpass ﬁlter, mixer, matching network
and power ampliﬁer) in ADS. The results are shown in Fig. 19.
We plotted S11 to ﬁnd the loss of the whole module and the
S11 value at 28 GHz is lower than -30 dB, which is excellent.

CONCLUSION
The design of a novel transmitter module on a single a
chip using GaN/Si as the substrate is presented in this paper.
The transmitter module consists of Yagi antenna, bandpass
ﬁlter, impedance matching network, upconversion mixer, and
power ampliﬁer. We investigated innovative designs for the
transmitter components with potential for integration on a GaN
substrate. To validate our designs, we selected 28 GHz but
module design can be easily scaled to higher millimeter wave
frequencies such as 60 GHz for the 5G system. Designed
transmitter module shows loss of less than -10 dB at 28 GHz,
which can be further improved with design reﬁnement. To
our knowledge, this is ﬁrst reported the design of monolithic
transmitter module on GaN chip. Our proposed module will
offer signiﬁcant SWAP-C advantages.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
