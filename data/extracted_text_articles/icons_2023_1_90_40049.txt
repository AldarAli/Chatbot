Abstract— Considering the increasing population and vehicle 
demand, the development of a safer and more efficient 
intersection management system is of critical importance. The 
following 
paper 
addresses 
decentralized 
intersection 
management through synergetic cooperation of networked 
autonomous vehicles to optimize intersection throughput as well 
as ensure proactive safety of all vehicles. Through Vehicle-to-
Vehicle (V2V) communication, autonomous vehicles can obtain 
real-time information from all road users within the effective 
communication range, including position, speed, direction of 
travel, and destination. Based on the information, the priority 
for crossing the intersection or the order of passage can be 
determined by coordination between vehicles, so that the 
conflict zone of the intersection always remains free of traffic. 
At the same time, low-priority vehicles can also adjust their 
speed in advance to avoid potential conflicts with other vehicles. 
A pilot application is used to validate and demonstrate the 
model-based developed intersection management in a virtual 
simulation environment. Quantitative analysis of the simulation 
results proves the performance of the management system, 
especially in extremely high traffic intensity where the 
management system can keep traffic flowing in the conflict zone, 
ensuring efficient operation. The generalizability of the 
developed management system is also verified by applying it to 
a complex traffic network consisting of multiple intersections. 
Keywords- Optimal intersection management; cooperative 
intersection control; connected autonomous vehicles; Vehicle-to-
Vehicle (V2V) communication; Model-in-the-Loop-Simulations;

 INTRODUCTION 
As urbanization continues, especially in developing 
countries, the demand for vehicles to satisfy travel needs is 
steadily increasing, while the lack and inadequacy of 
transportation infrastructure exacerbates the serious shortage 
of transportation resources and the resulting high number of 
traffic accidents, especially at the intersection and junctions 
on major roads as frequent accident blackspots in the urban 
road network. 
Although road intersections represent a relatively small 
part of the total road network, they are responsible for a 
significant proportion of traffic accidents. According to the 
Community Database of the European Union (EU database: 
"CARE") on road accidents, more than 20% of traffic fatalities 
are attributable to road traffic at intersections [1]. A similar 
ratio is observed in the United States, where 40% of accidents 
and 21.5% of traffic fatalities occur at intersections [2] [3]. 
According to statistics from the Insurers Accident Research, 
in Germany in 2020, about two-thirds of all cyclist accidents 
with personal injury recorded by the police in urban areas 
occurred at intersections, junctions and driveways, with about 
one in five of these accidents occurring while turning right [4]. 
The complex traffic network and redundant traffic signals due 
to numerous junctions often lead to long traffic congestion on 
major traffic sections during peak traffic hours, which is 
especially common in large cities with high population 
density and in small and medium-sized cities with inadequate 
road infrastructure and is an almost universal problem for the 
whole society. 
To efficiently address the aforementioned road traffic 
challenges, this paper focuses on the development of 
decentralized cooperative intersection management through 
synergetic networking of autonomous vehicles using V2V 
communication to optimize traffic throughput and also ensure 
proactive safety at the intersection. The rest of this paper is 
organized as follows. Section II introduces the related work 
and the methodology. Section III details the design of the 
intersection management system. In Section IV, based on 
representative 
application 
scenarios, 
the 
developed 
intersection management is validated and demonstrated in a 
virtual simulation environment. Section V gives the 
conclusion. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
In this section, the state of knowledge on the topics of 
intersection management is first presented. Subsequently, the 
mechatronic development methodology for the systematic 
structuring of a Cyber-Physical system (CPS) is described. 
A. Intersection management 
Numerous scientific researches on different aspects have 
been carried out to optimize the traffic flow at the 
intersection, whose main objectives are efficiency, safety, 
ecology and passenger comfort, as shown in Fig. 1.

The research activities focus on the topological 
characteristics of the traffic system and its traffic signal 
control, including the design of traffic infrastructure and the 
geometric design of road networks, the development of more 
rational traffic control and speed limits, the research of more 
advanced traffic monitoring and enforcement techniques, and 
the more accurate evaluation and disposition of traffic 
resources through more realistic simulation of traffic systems 
[7] [8]. Although the developed solution approaches in focus 
on traffic structure can improve the traffic flow to a certain 
extent, the waiting time at intersections is unfortunately not 
eliminated regardless of the traffic intensity and thus no 
longer meets the increasing mobility and social demands [7]. 
For example, in a signal-controlled intersection, vehicles are 
instructed the passing order by the cycle change of red and 
green light, and therefore adjust their speed with the light 
system. This traffic control approach causes more vehicles to 
congest at the intersection, and the delay time for vehicles in 
the conflict zone increases exponentially with traffic volume 
[9]. That is, vehicles take more time at the intersection, 
causing inefficient intersection traffic, especially if road users 
are not evenly distributed within it. Restrictions on mobility 
can cause driver frustration, irritation, and stress, which 
encourages more aggressive driving behavior and can further 
slow the process of restoring a free flow of traffic. [10] 
 In contrast, cooperative intersection management offers 
a more proactive solution for scenarios without traffic signals 
to overcome the aforementioned challenges. cooperative 
intersection management is developed based on networked 
autonomous driving and aims at creating and executing a 
(global) optimal sequence for road users when crossing the 
intersection. Through the use of communication technology, 
such as Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and 
Celluar Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), as well as their 
application in autonomous vehicles and also in traffic 
infrastructure, effective networking with other road users is 
enabled, leading to early response to potential conflicts 
between road users in the conflict area and optimization of 
throughput at intersections due to the increased driving speed 
[5][6]. According to National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHSTA), the effective application of V2V 
and V2I communication could reduce and/or avoid up to 80% 
of accidents of any type without impairment [2]. Therefore, 
cooperative driving is an important driving strategy for future 
autonomous driving at intersections. In this regard, 
autonomous driving combines both categories of traffic 
safety in terms of the traffic environment and vehicles, and 
the cooperative driving function increases efficiency in this 
regard [11]. 
Depending on the degree of automation of road users and 
its structure, cooperative intersection management is divided 
into centralized and decentralized strategies. 
In centralized approaches, it has a central Intersection 
Coordination Unit (ICU) that is placed in a certain area 
around the intersection [12] and globally decides the order or 
priority of passage at the intersection for all vehicles within 
the communication range. In [13]-[15], the methods for 
priority setting are presented, which are developed according 
to different principles, such as rule-based methods, search-
based methods, optimization-based methods, and so on. The 
strategy mainly relies on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) 
technology to achieve bidirectional communication between 
vehicles and road infrastructures. With access to extensive 
information of road users, a global optimum is delivered by 
ICU [5].  
In contrast to centralized intersection management, 
decentralized intersection management eliminates the need of 
ICU for dispatching vehicles at the intersection by 
synergistically networking autonomous vehicles. The 
networked autonomous vehicles can recognize the current 
traffic situation and make decisions independently with the 
support of the exchanged traffic information without the help 
of an external decision system to fulfil transportation orders 
safely and efficiently [16]. In decentralized intersection 
management, vehicles use V2V communication to coordinate 
right-of-way and adjust their own trajectories. Unlike 
centralized 
intersection 
management, 
decentralized 
intersection management usually achieves a suboptimal 
solution because each vehicle only obtains local information 
of vehicles in a limited number [17]. In [18], an interactive 
decision model based on fuzzy logic with integration of 
conflict identification model is developed based on game 
theory for vehicles. In [19], a driving strategy based on 
cooperative game theory is presented for leading time 
avoidance of the conflicts between vehicles at the 
intersection. In [20], an algorithm for cooperative driving 
based on Model Predictive Control is designed for connected 
autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections. However, 
such approaches do not consider the impact of traffic volume 
on the reliability of the function. 
From the perspective of the functional coverage, most 
recent researches pay more attention to the cooperative 
driving strategy of the isolated single intersection, which is 
 
Figure 1.  Research goals of intesection management [5][6].

called area-wide cooperative intersection management, e.g., 
[21]-[23]. In fact, the vehicles pass through several 
intersections in the road network one after another and the 
vehicle's 
behaviours at the single intersection are 
interdependent, which leads to the complicated interactions 
between vehicles. Moreover, it enables the causality loops in 
the trajectory planning of the vehicles, in which the 
calculated trajectories affect each other in different conflict 
zones, resulting in no reasonable solution and high 
calculation effort when each vehicle focusses on its optimal 
trajectory [24]. It should be extended to a network-wide 
cooperative intersection management system that deals with 
a road network consisting of multiple intersections. 
Moreover, many algorithms for isolated intersections, which 
are developed under certain constraints and for specific 
application scenarios, cannot be directly adopted for complex 
road networks consisting of multiple intersections. 
The decentralized intersection management system based 
on networked fully automated vehicles developed in this 
paper, in contrast to the related research work mentioned 
above, is mainly used to solve the problem of spatial and 
temporal causal loops when vehicles pass through multiple 
intersections in succession. That is, the approach can be 
applied to both single intersections and road networks formed 
by multiple intersections, without requiring much work to be 
invested. The generalizability of the method is not affected 
by the topological characteristics of the intersection within a 
certain traffic flow range. 
B. Mechatronic structuring 
The domain diversity and thus the heterogeneous 
character of the CPS results in a high system complexity [25]. 
To handle the complexity of highly integrated systems in a 
systematic, seamless manner, a clear system and functional 
structure is first required. 
The structuring is carried out by applying the generalized 
cascade principle, which provides for the use of subordinate 
functional modules with high dynamics by superimposed 
functional modules for the local implementation of global 
target variables [26]. Modularization and hierarchization take 
central place for structuring. In modularization, subfunctions 
are derived from the entire system in a top-down process and 
encapsulated in modules. In hierarchization, these functional 
modules are arranged hierarchically with defined interfaces. 
Based on a clear structuring of the entire system, a clear 
representation of the information flow is achieved.  
The definition of the necessary function modules and the 
hierarchical arrangement of these is carried out using the 
following six structural elements [27]: 
• 
Mechatronic Function Module (MFM): The 
MFMs are the basic elements of the system and 
represents the lowest level of the hierarchy. They 
consist of sensors, actors, information processing 
and basic system related mechanical structure. This 
functionally encapsulated modules are the most vital 
element of the system. It has defined physical and 
signal interfaces to the superordinate MFG. 
• 
Mechatronic Function Group (MFG): The 
coupling of several MFMs results in a MFG with its 
own information processing and sensors. They use 
the subordinate MFMs with their actuators and 
mechanical structure. MFMs are mainly used for 
structuring the information processing. 
• 
Autonomous Mechatronic System (AMS): Several 
MFGs, which are coupled by physical and signal 
interfaces form an AMS in their entirety An AMS is 
completely independent of its environment and has 
its own sensors and information processing. It 
includes the top level of the mechanical structure. 
• 
Cross-linked Mechatronic System (CMS): The 
CMS is a signal-based coupling of several AMS and 
is the top hierarchical level. It coordinates and 
optimizes operations by regulating the flow of 
information and passing on decisions that affect all 
the AMSs in the network. 
• 
Autonomous Function Group (AFG): If several 
AMS are networked with each other so that they can 
exchange information. A swarm is formed, which is 
called AFG. The autonomy of each individual AMS 
is still given, only the sum of available information 
has grown. The AFG has additional sensors that 
provide data for all subordinate AMS. The difference 
to the original definition of the CMS is, that no 
decisions are made for subordinated systems, but 
information is exchanged, and cooperative operation 
is possible. 
• 
Cross-linked Function Group (CFG): Several 
CMSs can be grouped across domain boundaries as 
CFG, so that data can be exchanged in structured 
clusters. A CFG establishes an exchange of 
information between the CMS in the sense of a 
complete networking and digitalization.

III. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE DECENTRALIZED COOPERTIAVE 
INTERSECTION MANAGEMENT 
In this section, the requirements for decentralized 
cooperative intersection management are collected and 
defined. Based on this, the system and functional structure as 
well as the interfaces for integration with other functional 
modules of an autonomous vehicle in networked traffic 
systems are designed. 
A. Definition of the requirements 
Based on the mechatronic development methodology, the 
requirements for defining the function and structure in the 
form of requirement specifications and specifications are 
necessary on the one hand. On the other hand, the 
requirements are used as a benchmark in the functional 
validation as well as evaluation of the simulation results [28]. 
Therefore, based on the analysis of the state of knowledge 
and the intended scope of application at unsignalized 
intersections, the following essential requirements for a 
decentralized cooperative intersection management are 
defined: 
• 
All road users must proceed through the intersection 
without collisions and, at the same time, the efficiency 
in terms of intersection throughput is to be optimized. 
• 
The potential conflicts, especially the dynamic 
conflicts between vehicles, must be identified early 
and avoided by appropriate measures. 
• 
For conflict detection, the dynamic traffic information 
(e.g., direction of travel, current vehicle position and 
operating conditions) must be continuously updated 
and transmitted to the concerned road users. 
• 
In case of a conflict between the target criteria e.g., 
safety and efficiency, it must be ensured that safe 
driving is always guaranteed. 
• 
The technical constraints regarding the dynamic and 
kinetic driving behaviours (e.g., available powertrain 
and braking forces, maximum speed, safety distance) 
and legal limitations (e.g., maximum speed in urban 
areas) must be observed during the optimization and 
a feasible optimum must be defined within their 
framework. 
• 
The real-time capability and reliability of the 
intersection management must be guaranteed in any 
case. I.e., the intersection management must provide 
a reliable solution within a certain period that allows 
vehicles to cross the intersection without collisions. 
• 
The universality of the intersection management 
should 
not 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
topological 
characteristics of the intersections. Intersection 
management shall be adaptable to different scenarios 
and capable of achieving cooperative objectives. 
• 
The intersection management must dynamically 
adapt to the changing traffic environment (e.g., 
dynamically varying traffic intensity). 
• 
For smooth communication between heterogeneous 
traffic participants, the data structure of the 
information to be exchanged, including data type, 
format, size, etc., must be uniform. 
B. Design of the system structure 
Based on the defined requirements, the modular and 
hierarchically arranged system structure of the highly 
integrated CPS is derived in accordance with the 
 
Figure 3.  Modular and hierarchical system structure of the CPS.

development methodology for mechatronic structuring in the 
top-down process, as illustrated in the Fig. 3. Through their 
highly information integration with each other, a CPS is 
established at the CFG level. 
At the CMS level, it has the management systems to 
systematically administer the subordinate AMS, which are 
case-specific developed according to the application areas. 
The management systems listed work as a central coordinator 
and strive for a global optimum. Due to the focus of this 
work, only the intersection management on CMS level and 
vehicles on AMS level, including the subordinate MFG as 
well as MFM, are considered here. 
Compared to the centralized intersection management at 
the CMS level, the decentralized intersection management 
does not play a role as a central coordinator to control AMS, 
since the vehicles at the AMS level are completely 
autonomous from their environment in their interconnection. 
In this case, the decentralized intersection management 
performs only one task, which is to distribute the information 
processed and analysed by AFG to the corresponding road 
users passing through the intersection according to their 
needs, which enables efficient information provision. In 
addition, decentralized intersection management enables 
AMS to communicate with other CMS or even with the 
highest hierarchy level CFG across system boundaries. 
The underlying AFGs are AFG “Collaborative Mapping” 
and “Intersection Monitoring”. Here, the collected data from 
the sensors installed at the intersection or the information 
acquired via V2X communication is analysed, resulting in a 
panorama of the traffic environment, and obtaining new 
insights by fusing the data from different sources in different 
dimensions, and thus road users can make reasonable 
decisions with the comprehensive information. The AFG 
"Collaborative Map Generation" provides up-to-date and 
dynamic map data for all vehicles by highly dynamically 
integrating information provided via V2X communications, 
such as the direction of travel, vehicle position and operating 
states of individual road users, with static, highly accurate 
reference map to complete them. AFG “Intersection 
Monitoring” is used to collect information on the status of all 
road users in impact, to detect potential conflicts at an early 
stage, and to warn road users of the need for action. The 
information collected can also be used as a basis for decision-
making for subsequent enforcement of traffic regulations and 
clarification of liability. 
At the AMS level, all road users in the considered 
scenario of decentralized intersection management are 
networked with each other, while in the context of this work 
this is limited only to autonomous vehicles. The information 
processing of the AMS “Autonomous Vehicle” includes the 
“Status Acquisition” as well as “Communication Module” 
and disposes the information concerning the whole system. 
Based on this information, the upper-level commands are 
translated by the MFG-level functional modules into specific 
action instructions, which are executed by the lower-level 
MFM-level functional modules. 
The functional groups of an autonomous vehicle at MFG 
level includes MFG “Assistance Systems”, “Chassis 
Management” and “Energy Management”. The assistance 
Systems are used as a combination of the intelligent functions 
to represent the human drivers in decision making for vehicle 
guidance. This mainly includes the route guidance to 
determine an optimal route to a selected destination and the 
trajectory planning of an optimized driving operation 
considering the dynamic driving environment based on the 
selected route [29]. The chassis management refers to the 
vehicle dynamics control to maintain the desired driving 
operation (target trajectory), where the target values of the 
basic driving functions drive, steering, suspension, and 
braking are determined and issued to the corresponding 
functional modules [30]. Energy management is used to

provide the necessary power to operate all mandatory, safety-
relevant systems and optionally desirable comfort systems in 
the vehicle, as well as support for decision-making for 
vehicle guidance [31]. 
At the MFM level, in addition to the MFM for 
implementing the driving behaviour, it has a module for 
electrical energy supply, which includes a battery module as 
energy storage and battery management system (BMS) for 
monitoring the cell states and balancing during charging and 
discharging. 
C. Design of the functional structure and interfaces 
Form the system structure, the functional structure (cf. 
Fig. 4) is used to describe the information flow between the 
functional modules in vertical as well as horizontal 
directions, which serves as a basis for model description of 
the studied CPS in virtual test bench. 
IV. 
FUNCTION VALIDATION VIA MIL-SIMULATIONS 
In this section, the functionality of the developed 
intersection management is validated and evaluated with an 
application scenario under different traffic intensity. 
Subsequently, its generalizability is verified by applying it to 
a road network consisting of four intersections. 
A. Simulation scenario 
Fig. 5 represents the application scenario in which the 
autonomous vehicles are considered as the sole mobile road 
user and can perform the vehicle guidance independently 
without the intervention of a human driver. The simulation 
scenario of the CPS is reproduced with respect to the listed 
parameters in Table I in virtual test bench and the parameters 
of the vehicle model are adjusted. 
B. Analysis of the simulation results 
To verify the decentralized intersection management, the 
CPS is modeled and simulated with different traffic intensity 
in the virtual test bench. Here, the traffic intensity of motor 
vehicles in the peak hour is divided into three classes based 
on the class model of Federal Highway Research Institute 
(BASt) and simulated, whereby the traffic flow at each 
entrance in the simulation scenario flows evenly into the 
intersection: 
• 
Low traffic intensity: < 1000 vehicles/h 
• 
Medium traffic intensity: 1000 vehicles/h -2600 
vehicles/h 
• 
High traffic intensity: > 2600 vehicles/h 
During the simulation, the speed profile of each vehicle 
crossing the intersection is recorded separately, in particular 
the initial velocity 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 , the velocity entering the conflict 
zone 𝑣𝑖_𝑘, the average velocity in the conflict zone 𝑣̅𝑜_𝑘 and 
the velocity leaving the conflict zone 𝑣𝑜_𝑘. Fig. 6 shows the 
speed change of the ten vehicles with vehicle ID from 51 to 
60 when crossing the intersection with traffic intensity of 
3600 vehicles/h. For intuitive evaluation of the decentralized 
intersection management, the simulation results with 
different traffic volumes are analyzed quantitatively and the 
main variables to represent the performance of the 
intersection management according to the target criteria are 
summarized in Table II.

It is obvious that when the traffic flow is less than 3600 
vehicles/h, there is not much difference between the 
corresponding data sets obtained from the different traffic 
flow simulations, since the traffic flow at the intersection is 
regular and there is no congestion. However, when the traffic 
flow is increased to 7200 vehicles/h, it becomes clear that 
vehicles must slow down or even to zero before entering the 
conflict zone due to the congestion at the intersection, so the 
higher priority vehicles that are already in the conflict zone 
can pass the conflict zone first, and the conflict zone remains 
open. By comparing the vehicle velocity at traffic intensity of 
7200 vehicles/h and 3600 vehicles/h (cf. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7), 
the difference becomes particularly obvious. Therefore, the 
average velocity when entering the conflict zone is about

7.8% lower than the initial average velocity of the vehicles. 
The average velocity in the conflict zone is increased 
compared to the average velocity by entering the conflict 
zone, and vehicles can accelerate through the conflict zone, 
which is mainly reflected by the fact that the average velocity 
of vehicles leaving the conflict zone is about 15.5% higher 
than the average velocity of vehicles entering the conflict 
zone, and this increase is almost 2.5 times higher than that in 
the 
congestion-free 
circumstance.

shows 
that 
decentralized intersection management based on the 
synergistic cooperation of networked autonomous vehicles 
can ensure smooth operation of the intersection even under 
extremely heavy traffic. 
Since the traffic intensity at intersections is not regular in 
all directions, the robustness of the management system 
should be further investigated when the traffic intensity 
varies greatly in different directions. Therefore, the 
intersection management with irregular traffic intensity in 
different entry directions is researched, and the traffic 
intensity in east-west direction should be twice as high as that 
in north-south direction. The essential system parameters are 
summarized after analysis in Table III. By comparing the 
cases of regular and irregular traffic intensities in different 
entry directions, it is found that uneven traffic flow affects 
the throughput at the intersection. It can also be seen that the 
average speed at the entrance 𝑣̅𝑖_𝑘 is reduced in comparison to 
the average initial speed 𝑣̅𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 even with low traffic volume, 
with the drop in 𝑣̅𝑖_𝑘 being more pronounced with increasing 
traffic volume. This is because the vehicles in the lanes with 
higher traffic intensity have priority by passing through the 
conflict zone to avoid congestion in the conflict zone, 
resulting in vehicles in the lanes with lower traffic intensity 
slowing down when approaching the conflict area reduce or 
even slow down to zero. However, as soon as the vehicle is 
in the conflict zone, it accelerates and the average speed 
𝑣̅𝑜_𝑘with which the vehicles leave the conflict area at different 
traffic volumes is close to the maximum permissible velocity 
of 50 km/h to keep the traffic flow in the conflict zone fluid. 
To verify the generalization capability of the developed 
decentralized intersection management, a complex road 
network consisting of four intersections that are 200 m apart 
and with different traffic volumes is simulated, as illustrated 
in Fig. 8. The simulation results proved that the intersection 
management is also suitable for road networks with multiple 
intersections. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the decentralized cooperative intersection 
management system by means of networked autonomous 
vehicles is designed and developed to optimize traffic 
throughput and ensure proactive traffic safety. Based on the 
defined requirements, the system and functional structure of 
the studied CPS is created, and then modelled in the virtual 
test bed and simulated with different traffic intensity, where 
the traffic intensity can be regular or irregular in different 
entry directions. The functionality of the intersection 
management is validated and quantitatively evaluated with 
the support of MiL simulation. By integrating the intersection 
management into a road network, the generalizability is 
verified. 
In the next steps, the general applicability of the 
developed intersection management system can be used in 
intersections with different topological characteristics and 
verified by simulation. By comparing and evaluating the 
performance of centralized and decentralized intersection 
management with different traffic intensity, a new 
mechanism of intersection management will be developed, 
which dynamically adapts to the traffic flow by switching 
centralized and decentralized approaches to achieve the best 
performance.
