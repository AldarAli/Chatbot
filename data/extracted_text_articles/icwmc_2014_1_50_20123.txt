Abstract—Virtual multi-input multi-output (vMIMO) schemes in
wireless communication systems improve coverage, throughput,
capacity, and quality of service. In this paper, we propose
two uplink vMIMO relaying schemes based on detect-split-and-
forward (DSF). In addition, we investigate the effect of several
physical parameters on the performance of the relaying systems,
such as distance, modulation type and number of relays. In
addition, we provide analytical tools to evaluate the performance
of the proposed vMIMO relaying schemes.
Keywords–Virtual MIMO, distributed antenna, relaying, detect-

INTRODUCTION
Since the introduction of the multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) technology, there have been great advancements in
data rate speeds and wireless network efﬁciency. The main
purpose of MIMO implementation is to boost the transmission
rate by exploiting the randomness of parallel channels. Using
MIMO technology, the capacity of a propagation environ-
ment decreases with increasing the correlation of the channel
coefﬁcients. Practically, for none-line-of-sight (NLOS) and
omni-directional wireless mobile communications, there are
restrictions on handset manufacturing caused by wavelegths.
Hence, the designers should select applicable wavelengths
to realize the full potential of MIMO receivers. Obviously,
large antenna arrays of different sizes are not always practical
for handsets mobile. Furthermore, the developers of the next
generation wireless systems are investing in virtual MIMO
(vMIMO) [1]. Virtual MIMO (vMIMO) is a recent model
adapted from the broadcasting model of wireless channels
where all communication nodes (relays) support each other.
The goal of vMIMO is to provide better quality-of-service
(QoS) at higher data rates, especially for users who are at the
cell edge. This technique acts in a way similar to multi-user
(MU-MIMO) technique in the uplink side, also called network
MIMO [1]. vMIMO is based on the concept of relaying over
virtual antenna arrays. with results in enhancing the end-to-
end link performance, offering good QoS and extending cov-
erage range in NLOS environment. vMIMO systems execute
the communication process in a distributed manner to take
advantages of the MIMO system while reducing consumption
of battery, improving capacity and expanding network lifetime
[2].
Relay structures have evolved by the introduction of virtual
antenna arrays and MIMO relays [3] and [4]. The relaying
technique, as introduced by Van der Meulen [5], has transpired
through the years as the most well-known approach to improve
the reliability and performance of wireless networks. It makes
use of node cooperation and it allows a network to extend
its coverage without exhausting its power resources. The two
well-known relaying protocols, are: amplify-and forward (AF)
and decode-and forward (DF) [6]. AF is the simplest as it
only ampliﬁes the received signal then forwards it. However,
its drawback is that it ampliﬁes the noise in addition to the
signal. This technique, as described in the IEEE802.16j [7]
standard, does not require the mobile station (MS) to be aware
of intermediate relays. On the other hand, DF is a protocol that
uses error detection and correction as it decodes data once
received and conﬁrms its correctness then forwards the data.
This technique is generally used with hybrid automatic repeat
request (HARQ) to ensure that correct data was decoded and
intact [6].
The authors of [8] and [9] extended relaying concepts to
MIMO by considering several relay transmission and topology
schemes (e.g., parallel, serial and hybrid) and taking into
consideration practical MIMO systems. The authors of [10]
and [11] investigated the performance of space-time block
coding (STBC) with MIMO relaying using AF as an effective
way to introduce spatial diversity. Virtual spatial multiplexing
with AF relaying was investigated in [12] and closed-form
expressions were derived at high-SNRs. In [13], IEEE802.16e
described the uplink virtual MIMO (UL-vMIMO) as follows:
each user is equipped with a single antenna and shares the same
channel resources with other users. By utilizing simultaneous
transmissions over a common burst, vMIMO increases the
peak transmission rate and improves the system performance.
In addition, DF virtual relaying scheme for MIMO systems
was analyzed in [14].
In [15], an AF virtual spatial multiplexing scheme is
proposed in which each transmitter is equipped with a single
antenna. The transmitters form a virtual antenna array and send
identical signals to relays that amplify-and-forward different
portions of the signal at a reduced data rate to the destination.
The receiver is equipped with multiple antennas in order to
null and cancel the interference from the different relays and
detect the original signal transmitted from the source. Another
approach proposed by [16] is to let the relays detect a sub-
stream from the original stream. Then, all relays forward their
low rate sub-streams simultaneously over the same physical
channel. This scheme has the advantage of controlling noise, as

in digital systems, so that it is not ampliﬁed. Another advantage
is that the vMIMO relay can send data with lower modulation
rates which improves the bit error rate (BER). Because of the
practical difﬁculty associated with antenna coupling, another
alternative technique is proposed in [16]. In this paper we
refer to the scheme of [16] as detect-split-forward (DSF) using
vertical-bell laboratories layered space-time (VBLAST).
Up to the authors knowledge, there is no analysis for
the error probability of DSF schemes over vMIMO channels.
Thus, in this paper we provide analytical tools to evaluate the
performance of DSF-vMIMO schemes, for both VBLAST and
STBC. Both simulations and analysis are conducted to evaluate
the system performance in terms of several physical parameters
such as distance, modulation type, and number of relays.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II introduces the system and channel models. The analysis of
system performance and the average capacity are conducted
in Section III and Section IV. In Section V, some simulation
and numerical results are presented and discussed. Finally,
conclusions are given in Section VI.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a 1 × NR × ND uplink system, where 1
indicates a source with a single antenna, NR is number of
relays, each equipped with a single antenna. ND is number of
receiving antennas at the destination. The source modulates a
block of k information bits and transmits an 2k-ary modulated
symbol x, which is received by all relays. Then, each relay
detects the information bits and splits them into NR blocks of
length m bits, where mNR = k. At each relay, m-bit block
is modulated using lower level modulation schemes (2m-ary
symbol) and will be transmitted through NR relays, which
creates a vMIMO system. At the relays, two vMIMO schemes
are considered for relaying the NR symbols. The ﬁrst scheme
uses spatial multiplexing based on VBLAST and the second
scheme uses STBC.
A. DSF-vMIMO Schemes
To illustrate DSF vMIMO schemes, consider a 1 × 2 × 2
system with 2 bps/Hz efﬁciency. The relays receive the fol-
lowing signals from the source:
YR1 = hSR1x + nR1
(1)
YR2 = hSR2x + nR2,
(2)
where x is the transmitted symbol, YRi is the received
signal at relay i, and hSRi is the complex Gaussian fading
coefﬁcient, with zero mean and variance of one, from the
source to relay i. In addition, nRi is the additive white
Gaussian noise at relay i with zero-mean and variance No,
where No is the noise power spectral density. Each relay
detects the transmitted symbol x. The detection, splitting and
forwarding of each vMIMO scheme is explained next.
1) DSF-VBLAST Scheme: The DSF-VBLAST scheme de-
tects the 2k-ary symbol, splits it into NR parallel symbols,
where each symbol carries m bits and then forwards the signals
simultaneously to the destination as shown in Figure 1. As
an example, for a 2 bps/Hz efﬁciency, the source modulates
4 bits using 16-QAM and sends it to the relays. Each relay
detects the 16-QAM symbol and demodulates the 4 bits. Then,
these 4 bits will be splitted into two blocks, each consisting of
two bits. These two bits will be modulated using QPSK and
then spatially multiplexed and forwarded to the destination.
Since 4 bits have been transmitted using two hops, the system
efﬁciency is 2 bps/Hz.
The destination receives the following vMIMO signals:

YD1
YD2

(3)
where YDj is the received signal at antenna j at the
destination, ˆxi is the transmitted signal from relay i, and hRiDj
is the complex Gaussian fading coefﬁcient, with zero mean and
unit variance, between relay i and antenna j at the destination.
In addition, nDj is the additive white Gaussian noise at antenna
j at the destination.
The destination applies the VBLAST detection algorithm
with successive interference cancellation (SIC) and it performs
nulling, based on zero-forcing (ZF), cancelation and ordering.
2) DSF-STBC Scheme: To improve the diversity order and
provide more link reliability, STBC is used in the second hop.
At the relays, the 2k-ary symbol is detected and split into
NR symbols, each carries k/NR bits. After that, the splitted
symbols are mapped to an STBC as shown in Figure 2. As
an example, for a 2 bps/Hz, the source sends 6 bits using a
64-QAM symbol to the two relays. Then, each relay detects
the 64-QAM symbol and demodulates the 6 bits and split them
into two blocks, each consists of 3 bits. Each block of 3 bits is
modulated using 8PSK and then mapped to Alamouti STBC
code. The STBC codes will be forwarded to the destination
over two time slots. Since 6 bits have been transmitted during
three time slots, the system efﬁciency is 2 bps/Hz. The signals
received by the destination could be expressed as:


where Y t

RiDj is the channel from relay j to antenna j at the
destination at time slot t. The MIMO channel from the relay to
the destination is assumed to be quasi-static complex Gaussian
channel, where each cofﬁcient has a zero mean and unit
variance.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
A. DSF-VBLAST Scheme
To calculate the block error rate (BLER) for the DSF V-
BLAST scheme, we analyze the detection process at each hop.
Assume that PB,H1 is the BLER of the ﬁrst hop and PB,H2
is the BLER of the second hop. Then the total BLER at the
destination will be:
PB = 1 − (1 − PB,H1)(1 − PB,H2),
(5)
21
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-347-6
ICWMC 2014 : The Tenth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications

Since in the ﬁrst hop, the source transmit the modulated
symbol to NR single antenna relays, the BLER at the ﬁrst hop
is
PB,H1 = 1 − (1 − Pe,R)NR.
(6)
Where Pe,R is the symbol error rate (SER) at each relay
for M-ary modulation over fading channels [17], taking into
account the appropriate signal set levels and energy after
splitting. Thus SER at each relay is:
Pe,R =
M − 1
M
 
1 −
r
1.5γR
M 2 − 1 − 3γR

,
(7)
where M = 2m is the new cardinality of the signal set
after splitting and γR denotes the average received SNR at
each relay.
Since VBLAST detection is used in the second hop, each
layer of the V-BLAST scheme has a different error probability
depending on its diversity order [18].
Assume that Pe,i is the SER for layer i over Rayleigh
fading channels, then the BLER of the second hop is:
PB,H2 = 1 −

i=1

NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, the performance of DSF V-BLAST and
DSF-STBC schemes are evaluated using the analytical results
and veriﬁed by Monte-Carlo simulations. The channel models
used in the simulation are Rayleigh ﬂat-fading channels char-
acterized by complex Gaussian random variables with zero-
mean and 0.5 variance per dimension. In addition additive
white Gaussian noise is added at each receive antenna. Both
BLER performance and average capacity are evaluated The
spectral efﬁciency is computed as the total number of bits
received at the destination divided by the total number of
transmission time slots.
The BLER performance of 1 × 2 × 2 DSF-VBLAST and
DSF-STBC are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. The
performance is examined at several spectral efﬁciencies as
shown in Tables I and II. The relays are placed at a normalized
distance of 0.3 from the source. The results in this ﬁgure
illustrate the accuracy of our analysis.
BLER comparison between DSF-VBLAST and DSF-
STBC schemes is shown in Fig. 5 The result shows the
effect of relay location on the performance of both systems
and the inherent tradeoffs. The performance is examined at
low, medium, and high SNRs and the normalized distance is
changed from zero to one. The result shows that when the
relays are closer to the source, the DSF-STBC performs better
than DSF-V-BLAST. However, when the relays are placed
further than 0.4, the performance of DSF-VBLAST becomes
better. From this result, we propose to design a hybrid system
where the relays use adaptive techniques to determine the best
scheme to be used based on the distance from the source.
The average capacities of DSF-VBALST and DSF-STBC
schemes are shown in Fig. 6. At a certain distance and since
both systems consist of SISO and MIMO hops, the SISO
channel will dominate the overall channel capacity. The result
in Fig. 6 shows that at distances greater than d = 0.5, the
DSF-VBLAST channel capacity will perform the same as the
DSF-STBC since both systems are dominated by the weakest
channel, which is the SISO channel at the ﬁrst hop.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we analyzed detect-split-forward uplink vir-
tual MIMO relying schemes based on VBLAST and STBC.
The relays split the incoming source signal into lower mod-
ulation levels. This will enhance the energy efﬁciency of
the relaying system. Block error rate expressions and outage
capacity rates were presented. The analysis presented in this
paper matched the simulation results and it showed the effect of
several physical parameters such as distance, modulation type
and number of relays. For future work, there exists a tradeoff
between VBLAST and STBC which leads to designing an
adaptive relaying system that can adapt the MIMO scheme
based on the location of the relay to satisfy a certain quality
of service.
