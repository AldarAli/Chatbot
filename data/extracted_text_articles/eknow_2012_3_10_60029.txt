Abstract- The electronic-book (e-book) is one of the new 
technological changes that have significantly influenced the 
publishing industry in the last century. This has forced 
publishers to reconsider their distribution channels, since the 
Internet has provided a new means with which to serve 
readers. In this paper, a strategic market analysis is proposed 
from the perspective of a traditional publisher that needs to 
decide whether to switch to e-publishing business. The analysis 
framework determines the publishing market equilibrium in 
three different market scenarios. Besides, it shows the impact 
of readers’ choices and price sensitivities on the profits of 
publishers. The proposed framework has its basis on game 
theory and it is built in an oligopoly setting to reflect the severe 
market competition. The readers’ utilities and demands are 
modeled using the multinomial logit model. Although the first 
scenario possesses a global optimum solution, in the remaining 
two market scenarios genetic algorithms are used in order to 
find the sub-optimal solutions of the oligopolies.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Traditionally, the term “publishing” refers to the 
distribution of printed works such as books and newspapers. 
With the advent of digital information systems and the 
Internet, the scope of publishing has expanded to include 
electronic resources, such as the electronic versions of books 
and periodicals, as well as micropublishing, websites, blogs 
or video games. In this work, an electronic book (e-book) 
will be considered as the digital version of a traditional 
printed book (p-book) to be read digitally on a personal 
computer, handheld computer, PDA or a dedicated e-book 
reader. It has been estimated that e-book sales will account 
for 50% of the publishing industry’s sales by 2020 and 90% 
by 2030 [1].  
In this paper, a strategic market analysis framework in a 
publishing market is proposed in the presence of multiple 
competing publishers. The proposed publishing market 
consists of p-publishers (publishers of p-books) that try to 
decide on whether or not switch to e-publishing (publishing 
e-books). In this environment, a p-publisher is assumed to 
face three market scenarios, presented in sub-section 2.2. In 
each scenario, the publishers’ decision variables are their 
offered unit prices. There are two types of prices for an e-
publisher: A price for its traditional retail channel and a price 
for its electronic/Internet channel, while there is only the 
traditional retail price for a p-publisher. The traditional 
channel and Internet channel of a publisher are distinguished 
based on two features: the stocking and maintenance costs 
and price sensitivity of readers. It is assumed that readers 
will be more sensitive towards price, when they intend to 
buy a book from an electronic channel.   
The proposed framework computes the unit prices, and 
accordingly the profits of the publishers in each market 
scenario. Since the publishers need to make their decision in 
an uncertain market environment, the customer utility and 
demand are modeled using the multinomial logit model 
(MNL), which is based on probabilistic theory, by assuming 
that a customer has also a no-purchase alternative. For each 
scenario, a non-cooperative pricing game is built, whose 
players are the publishers. Solving the game, the mutual best 
response strategies that determine the equilibrium point(s) 
are studied. With the optimum prices, the publishers 
calculate their expected demands and expected profits. For 
the first scenario, the equilibrium prices and profits are 
global optimum, since the profit maximization problem is 
proved to be convex. However, the maximization problems 
of the second and the third scenarios cannot be proven to be 
convexes, hence their optimum solutions are found using a 
type of local search algorithm: the genetic algorithms (GA). 
A genetic algorithm is an evolutionary optimization 
approach which is most appropriate for complex non-linear 
models where finding the location of the global optimum is a 
difficult task [2]. GA utilize a population of solutions in the 
search, rather than handling one feasible solution like in 
other local search methods, such as Simulated Annealing or 
Tabu Search. GA have good performance in large and 
complex search spaces, since they explore and exploit 
simultaneously the search space. They do not guarantee 
global optimality even it may be reached. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
discusses the related work in the literature and their 
differences from this one. In Section 3, the formulation of the 
model, 
three 
possible 
market 
scenarios 
and 
their 
demonstrative examples are given in detail. The results are 
discussed at the end of the Section 3. Finally, conclusions 
and future work are given in Section 4.

RELATED WORK 
In literature, the GA have been applied frequently as a 
part of decision support systems. In one of the recent works, 
the authors have used genetic algorithms in identifying the 
optimal parameters for water resource modeling applications. 
Moreover, they have optimized the genetic algorithm model 
parameters [3]. In literature, it is possible to encounter the 
use of GA into the game theory-based models. These works 
are from various research areas. Riechmann [4] has shown 
that economic learning via GA can be described as a specific 
form of an evolutionary game. In his paper, he has pointed 
out that GA learning results in a series of near NE. In another 
research, the authors have discussed a new evolutionary 
strategy for the multiple objective design optimization of 
internal aerodynamic shape [5]. They have claimed that 
game theory replaces a global optimization problem by a 
non-cooperative game based on Nash equilibrium with 
several players solving local constrained sub-optimization 
tasks. The authors have stated that game theory is not only 
the primary method for the formal modeling of interactions 
between individual, but it also underlies how biologists think 
about social interactions on an intuitive level [6]. In their 
work, they have used GA as an alternative method of 
searching evolutionary stable sets in a well-studied game of 
biological communication. In a sense, the point of view in 
this work resembles to the one in the proposed framework in 
this paper, since GA are used to search the market 
equilibrium points in games for three different market 
scenarios.   
There are numerous research in the literature on the 
adoption of e-books and e-publishing; however this paper’s 
concern is a more specific area. The concentration is on the 
economics and management aspects of e-publishing. The 
most relevant research are as follows: Jiang and Katsamakas 
examine how the entry of an e-book seller affects strategic 
interaction in the book markets and impacts sellers or 
consumers [7]. Their work is a good example of the 
application of game theory in analyzing the market 
asymmetries. The research of Hua et al., has the same 
research question as the one in this paper [1]. In their 
research, the authors derive the conditions under which a 
publisher should sell only p-books, only e-books, and both of 
them simultaneously. They use the newsvendor model to 
analyze demand behavior; whereas the demand is modeled 
using MNL model in this paper. As the demand varies 
linearly on offered price, they can determine the closed-form 
expression of optimum prices. In this paper, the problems are 
solved using nonlinear techniques. Bernstein et al. use the 
MNL model for the equilibrium analysis of retailers [8]. 
They differentiate retailers’ choices as “bricks-and-mortar” 
and “clicks-and-mortar”, which represent the traditional 
retail channel and Internet channel, respectively. Their study 
has some common grounds with the one in this paper, since 
they analyze the supply chain channel structure choice in an 
oligopoly setting.  
III. 
THE MODEL FORMULATıON 
An n-firm oligopoly setting is considered to study the 
structure of the game [9]. In the proposed game, the 
publishers that sell their books through a retail store (p-
publishers) want to reach more reader by publishing their 
books on an Internet channel (e-publishers). The e-publisheri 
will continue to sell its books on the retail stores, hence it has 
to define two different prices: a unit retail price pi for its 
traditional channel and a unit online price pei for its Internet 
channel. The p-publisheri needs to define only its unit retail 
price pi. As the stocking and maintenance costs of an e-book 
are assumed to be lower than the ones of a traditional book, 
the following assumptions on the prices are set: 
ei
i
p
≤ p
. A 
= {1, 2, …, n}∪ A0  denotes the set of publishers.  
A. Customer Utility Model 
A reader is assumed to derive a different utility when 
obtaining the book from a retailer’s physical store 
(alternative i) than obtaining it in an electronic form 
(alternative ei). Furthermore, a reader is assumed to have a 
no-purchase alternative (A0). In other words, if s/ he does not 
like any offer, s/ he will not buy any book. Then, the set of 
alternatives is AP =  {1, 2, …, n} ∪ A0 when all the 
publishers sell from their retail stores, while it is AE =  {1, e1, 
2, e2, …, n, en}∪ A0 when all publishers sell both from their 
retail stores and their online stores. It is also possible to have 
a case with k e-publishers and (n-k) p-publishers, then the set 
of alternatives is AEP(k) = {1, e1, …, k, ek, k+1,  …, n}. 
The customer utility is modeled using the multinomial-
logit model (MNL). The MNL model is one of the random-
utility models that are based on a probabilistic model of 
individual customer utility [10]. Let us assume that a 
customer has a utility for alternative i, denoted Ui. The 
probability that a customer selects alternative i from a subset 
A of alternatives is given by: 
 
                  ( )

If we assume that u1 = -bp, this gives the following 
demand function:

where M is the market size and b is a coefficient of the 
price sensitivity. In the multiple-product case, by considering 
each user of the same type (bi=b), the demand function of 
publisheri is given by:

B. Choice of Channel Structure 
In the proposed strategic analysis, each p-publisher that 
has an incentive to publish its books on an electronic 
environment, in other words that has an incentive to move to 
e-publishing business, faces three marketing scenarios:  
1. P-P competition: All publishers in the market are p-
publishers.   
2. E-P competition: Some publishers remain as p-
publishers, but the rest moves to e-publishing. 
3. E-E competition: All publishers in the market are e-
publishers.     
 
The list of notation for the equilibrium analysis under 
different scenarios can be given as: 
PP
ip
: Equilibrium price of p-publisheri under P-P 
competition, 
EP
ip
: Equilibrium price of p-publisheri under E-P

The first order condition of the choice probability with

that the price increase of a p-publisheri reduces its own 
demand; whereas the first order condition with respect to its 
competitor’s price ( Prob
PP
PP
i
tp
∂
∂
), i
≠ t
 is positive, which 
means that the price increase of the competitor’s price 
increase the demand of p-publisheri. As p-publishers 
determine their prices simultaneously, they need to consider 
the competition, i.e., the prices offered by other p-publishers 
in their market. The problem is modeled as a game where the 
players are the p-publishers, the strategies of the players are 
their offered unit prices and the payoffs of the players are 
their profit functions. Solving such a game means predicting 
the strategy of the publisher. One can see that if the strategies 
from the players are mutual best responses to each other, no 
player would have to deviate from the given strategies and 
the game would reach a steady state. Such a point is called 
the Nash equilibrium (NE) point of the game [11]. In the 
game, p-publishers determine their prices independently and 
the information is strictly limited to local information. 
Hence, the game has a non-cooperative setup.  Global 
optimality conditions are used in order to analyze the 
existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium point. The 
constraints in the proposed problem (5) are linear, so they are 
convexes. Therefore, the vector

This scenario is demonstrated on a simple but

The target customer group is assumed to be consist of 
M=100 readers. The unit costs of two p-publishers (c1=c2)

are assumed to be the same and equal to 1. The price 
sensitivities 
in 
the 
readers’ 
demand 
functions 
are 
differentiated in order to analyze the impact of readers’ price 
sensitivities on the publishers’ price determination. The price 
sensitivity of customers of p-publisher1 (b1) is taken as 1, 
whereas the one of customers of p-publisher2 (b2) is taken as 
1.5. For the first scenario, the equilibrium price values and 
related demands and profits are given in Table 1. As the 
price sensitivity of the customers of p-publisher2 is set higher 
than the one of p-publisher1, p-publisher2 offers a lower 
price (
2
pPP
= 1.7123) in the equilibrium. The demand values 
in given tables are found using Eq. (3).

In the second scenario, the first (

are assumed to be move on e-publishing, whereas the 
remaining n-k publishers are stayed as p-publisher. The set of

. In this scenario, p-
publisheri determines only one price (
EP
ip
), but e-publisheri 
determines both a price for its traditional channel (
EP
ip
) and 
a price for its Internet channel (
EP
pei
). The p-publisher’s price 
is assumed to be influenced from other p-publisher’s prices, 
whereas the e-publisher’s price is influenced from both other 
e-publishers’ prices and from the price of its own traditional 
channel. In other words, if e-publisheri increases its Internet 
channel price (
EP
pei
), the demand to its traditional channel 
increases. From this point of view, two channels of an e-
publisher can be considered as “competing” [8]. Both type of 
publishers’ aim is to define their optimum prices (
EP
ip
and 
EP
pei
) that maximize their profits. P-publisherj wants to 
maximize its profit:

On the other hand, the objective of e-publisheri is to 
choose 
EP
ip
and 
EP
pei
 that maximizes its own profit:
 
The first 
term of the profit function belongs to the profit earned from 
p-publishing, while the second term belongs to the profit 
earned from e-publishing. In the proposed model, the 
coefficient 
ϑ ≥1
 is inserted to the demand function because 
an e-reader’s sensitivity to price is assumed to be higher than 
the one of a p-reader. In this setting, it is not possible to 
derive closed-form expressions for the equilibrium prices, 
demands and profits. The convexity of the maximization 
problem in this scenario cannot be demonstrated. Therefore, 
the GA is used as a computing technique to find sub-optimal 
solutions. In the GA implementation, three different 
population sizes are utilized: 100, 125, 150. The profit 
functions of the publishers are used as fitness functions in 
order to decide the chromosome in the next generation. For 
the GA, the most frequently used stopping criterion is the 
specification of a maximum number of generations. In the 
GA implementation of the scenario, the maximum number of 
generations is defined as 250, which means that the 
algorithm terminates once the iteration number reaches 250. 
For each population size, the GA is run 50 times and the best 
result is chosen from these 50 results. The solutions have 
shown that the optimum solution does not depend on the 
initial population size in this scenario. The second scenario is 
demonstrated on an example with e-publisher1 and p-
publisher2 in the market. For the second scenario, the 
equilibrium price values and related demands and profits are 
given in Table 2. The results at the equilibrium point confirm 
that the e-publishing price is lower than the p-publishing 
prices because of lower publishing costs. E-publisher1 
reaches bigger market share, which is proportional to its total 
profit, since it offers two different publishing channels for 
different preferences.

The convexity of the maximization problem cannot be 
demonstrated, the sub-optimal solutions are computed using 
the GA. The unit costs of p-publishing and e-publishing are 
assumed to be the same for two e-publishers and they are set 
to 1 and 0.75, respectively. The equilibrium price values and 
related demands and profits are given in Table 3. Both e-
publishing and p-publishing prices of e-publisher2 are lower 
than the ones of e-publisher1. The reason is that both types of 
readers (e-readers and p-readers) of e-publisher2 are more 
sensitive to price than the readers of e-publisher1. E-
publisher2 is obliged to hold its prices down in order to grab 
more readers.

Based on the numerical results of three demonstrative 
examples, it is possible to make some observations. The 
scenario where the sum of the profits of all the publishers in 
the market is maximum is the third one: the E-E competition. 
The E-E competition can be interpreted as the industry 
equilibrium. The results show that the coefficient of price 
sensitivity (b) is the fundamental factor that determines both 
types of price levels. As the price sensitivity of readers 
increases, publishers are obliged to decrease their prices in 
order to maintain more reader. In this sense, it is the reader 
that determines the price level. In the case e-publisher1 is 
alone in the market (E-P competition), its demand and 
accordingly its profit are higher than in the competitive 
market (E-E competition). In the case there is at least one e-
publisher in the market, the p-publisher loses profit. The p-
publisher cannot reduce price like an e-publisher because of 
its higher maintenance and stocking costs. An e-publisher’s 
profit reaches its maximum level, if its competitor is a p-
publisher.

CONCLUSıONS 
With the proliferation of smart mobile phones, such as 
iPhone or Blackberry, or the dedicated e-readers, such as 
Kindle or Nook, more and more young readers are 
accustomed to reading the electronic versions of the books 
and magazines. This has an increasing effect on the adoption 
rate of e-publishing; however it creates a pressure on the 
publishers. Now, publishers need to analyze the market more 
deeply in order to maintain their customer base. The 
principle objective of this work is to propose a strategic 
analysis framework which would be valid for different types 
of decision environments by making slight modifications. 
The concentration is on the publishing industry, especially 
on a p-publisher that tries to decide on whether to enter the e-
publishing business. However, the same decision support 
framework can help an existing firm when changing its 
business, or an existing firm to determine new prices, or a 
new entrant firm to determine prices. The framework is built 
on game theory basis, since a successful business strategy 
needs to consider the actions of other players in a 
competitive market. Using a local search algorithm, the GA, 
in order to find the equilibrium points of the games is the 
other contribution of this work. The numerical results have 
shown that GA can found similar results with a non-linear 
solver. The results have revealed that the price sensitivity of 
readers is the most fundamental parameter that affects both 
the choice of the reader and the price of the book. The higher 
the reader’s price sensitivity is, the more the publisher tends 
to sell e-book to the reader.        
Going forward, the equilibrium points may be found by 
using other soft computing algorithms and different 
algorithms can be compared in terms of obtained values and 
the execution time. Since the games are played offline in the 
proposed framework, the execution times are not questioned. 
The price sensitivity coefficient has a direct and profound 
impact on the equilibrium results, a future work can 
concentrate on determining it in the most efficient way. 
Some regression techniques can be useful in the presence of 
real life data.
