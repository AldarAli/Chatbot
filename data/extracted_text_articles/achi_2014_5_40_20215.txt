Abstract—Interactive engagement is easier to achieve in
traditional
learning
environments
(where
face-to-face
interaction is assured) than in e-learning environments.
Therefore, a set of functionalities should be supported in e-
learning systems to allow an acceptable level of interactive
engagement, such as whiteboards, chartrooms, discussion
boards, etc. In this study, some analysis and evaluation was
conducted for a number of open source e-learning systems
regarding their support for functionalities that aids in
creating an interactively engaging learning environment.
The
evaluation
included
ATutor,
Claroline,
Dokeos,
Integrated Learning, Information and Work Cooperation
System
(ILIAS),
Modular
Object-Oriented
Dynamic
Learning
Environment
(Moodle),
Online
Learning
and
Training (OLAT), and Sakai. The evaluation result showed
that Moodle and Dokeos achieved the best coverage of all
possible
interactive
engagement-supporting
capabilities
available, thus proving its superiority over other e-learning
systems included in this study in providing an interactively
engaging learning environment.

INTRODUCTION
Educational Systems are evolving to meet the society’s
needs for learning systems that save time, money and the
environment. E-learning systems, the use of information
and communication technologies in the learning process,
are emerging to meet those needs. They are the best
solution for students and instructors that live in separate
locations and for those who have temporal difficulties.
Many benefits of e-learning systems are discussed in the
literature, such as the flexibility of the material and time
that is given to students, and more opportunities to ask
questions and express thoughts. Also, it reduces the
dependence on time constraints for teacher/lecturer and
supports the accessibility to the course materials based on
student's election [1]. In addition, J. Capper [2] listed
several valuable benefits, including the fact that new
learning strategies and approaches become economically
feasible through e-learning systems. For instance, it
becomes feasible to utilize faculty anywhere in the world
and to put together faculty teams that include master
teachers,
researchers,
scientists,
and
experienced
professional developers. Also, group collaboration can be
achieved by means of electronic messaging and shared
conversations
tools
that
give
the
participants
the
opportunity to work together as groups despite their
physical locations.
The success of e-learning systems had led to the
development of many e-learning platforms -either open-
source or close-source- that support various tools and
technologies to allow a good blend of learning capabilities
in order to optimize the learning process. E-learning may
be synchronous, where the learning among all participants
occurs in real time, or asynchronous, where participants
learn at there own pace. Weather the e-learning system
was
designed
to
be
synchronous
or
asynchronous,
participants are usually at various locations. Therefore, the
assumption that e-learning systems are recreation of
traditional systems is wrong due to the lack of face-to-face
communication, body language, social cues in e-learning,
but are essential in producing an engaging learning
environment.
Actually,
traditional
classrooms
allow
instructors
to
be
aware
of
the
level
of
student's
understanding and easily employ some techniques to keep
the students active and engaged. However, in virtual
classrooms, that will be more difficult because of the lack
of face-to-face interactions among students and instructors.
In this situation, instructors must have access to some tools
offered by the e-learning platform to promote the learning
process [3]. Consequently, this allows instructors to make
sure that students understand well, and keep them engaged
by using several forms of interaction including: the
interaction of students with the instructor, their fellow
students, or the content. Instructors expect to use E-
learning platforms that have adequate tools -whiteboards,
audio and video are some examples of such tools that can
be used in this context- to support the interactive
engagement in virtual classroom.
Because of the remote nature of the e-learning
activities, usability is of special importance in e-learning
systems
[4].
Furthermore,
the
level
of
interactive
engagement supported in e-learning systems is found to be
vital for achieving effectiveness [5], which is a core
measurement of usability based on its definition in the ISO
(International standard organization) 9241 standard-: "The
extent to which a product can be used by specified users to
achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and
satisfaction in a specified context of use".
Due
to
the
importance
of the
supportability of
interactive engagement in e-learning systems, this paper
will
emphasize
how
interactive
engagement
functionalities supported by e-learning systems affect
their achieved usability. Furthermore, seven widely used
open-source E-learning systems (Moodle [6], ILIAS [7],
Sakai [8], ATutor[9], Claroline [10], Dokeos[11], and
OLAT[12]) will be evaluated based on their interactive

engagement capabilities.The comparison will be based on
the offered synchronous and asynchronous tools by each
one of the seven systems to support and meet the
interactive engagement requirement. First, we will list and
describe the tools that can be used generally in virtual
classroom to support interactive engagement. Then, we
will check the availability of these tools in each one of the
e-learning systems included in this study. Finally, we will
conclude our research with the usability evaluation –from
the interactive engagement point of view- of these e-
learning systems. In the next section we discuss the
importance of interactive engagement in assessing the
usability of e-learning systems, and in pedagogy. After
that, we provide an overview of e-learning systems in
general, and the e-learning systems that will be covered by
this study. Following that, we will explain the applied
evaluation approach. Then, we will list and explain the
functionalities that support interactive engagement in e-
learning systems, and on which we will base our
comparison upon. Finally, we will present the evaluation
results and conclude with our findings.
II.
INTERACTIVE ENGAGMGNET IMPORTANCE
Hake [13] defines interactive engagement methods as
‘‘those designed at least in part to promote conceptual
understanding through interactive engagement of students
in heads-on (always) and hands-on (usually) activities
which yield immediate feedback through discussion with
peers
and/or
instructors”,
placing
an
emphasis
on
challenging the student to ‘think’ actively, which ensures
that students pay and keep attention to the instructor and
the material that is being presented. In this paper, we are
interested in interactive engagement from two aspects: its
importance in assessing the effectiveness (as a direct
indicator of systems’ usability) of e-learning systems, and
its importance in pedagogy to achieve educational goals.
A.
Interactive Engagement Importance in Usability
Assessment of E-learning systems
Interactive engagement is one of the important needs
by users (learners and instructors) that must be considered
and met to produce an e-learning system with high
usability. In Michael Allen's guide to e-learning [28],
interactive
engagement
capabilities
is
one
of
the
fundamental services that should be provided in e-learning
systems. Furthermore, one of the three shifts that should
be adopted by e-learning describes in this guide is the
shift from passive learning to interactively engaging
learning [29].
From usability point of view, each system has a set of
user profiles and each should be able to achieve a number
of tasks properly. Learners and instructors are the
common user profiles of e-learning systems and should be
able to perform tasks through offered functionalities in
order
to
fulfill
the
interactive
engagement
user
requirement [17].
In addition, learners and instructors have the need to
use collaborative and interactive tools to share their tasks
and ideas with each other [18]. Furthermore, the use of
interactive engagement materials and tools significantly
enhances the user experience in e-learning [30]. Given the
importance of these requirements (interactive engagement
and collaboration functionalities), to achieve an effective
learning process through the use of e-learning systems, the
evaluation of e-learning usability based on the design
heuristics is not enough. Thus, users may abandon an e-
learning system if the interactive engagement –as an
essential pedagogy- is not supported.
Some previous studies [19] [20] have established a
framework to evaluate the usability of e-learning systems,
which combine the instructional design and usability
heuristics. Another,
[17],
has
proposed
a
systematic
approach based on user requirements and goals.
One of the important studies that considered the
interactive engagement as one of the usability parameters
in their proposed evaluation framework is [21]. This
framework is based on learner-centered-perspective and
combined usability and instructional design parameters,
such as learnability, consistency, multimedia use, and
interactive engagement. Also, for each parameter, there is
a group of measurement criteria, such as the use of games
and
media
as
measurement
criteria
for
interactive
engagement parameter.
These previous studies indicate that the usability of e-
learning systems can be affected by the pedagogies and
learning
goals
that
should
be
placed
under
great
importance, such as interactive engagement, and the need
to combine the pedagogical guidelines with design
heuristics
to
create
effective
usability
evaluation
frameworks for e-learning systems.
B.
Interactive Engagement Importance in Pedagogy
Communication and interactions between instructors
and students are essential for the quality of learning.
Interaction in pedagogy between instructors and students
applies to any form of communication, whether initiated
by the instructor or by the student. The four types of
interaction that may occur in education are learner-to-
content,
learner-to-learner,
learner-to-technology,
and
learner-to-teacher [14]. The occurrence of these types of
interactions is essential in creating an interactive engaging
learner environment and diminishing the learning barriers.
Many forms of communication may be applied in order to
achieve an interactive and engaging learning environment,
including:

Discussions between the instructor and the student, a
group of students, or within groups of students.

Student Expressions and thoughts about presented
topics.

Feedback
provided
from instructors
on
students
discussion, academic performance, etc.

Group activities.

Applied learning strategies such as interactive video,
audio, questionnaires, games, etc.
Educators and pedagogical researchers have placed
great importance in engaging the learner; and “To teach is
to engage students in learning” [15] is a famous quote in
pedagogy. Moreover, gains from interactively engaging

the learner vary from enhancing critical thinking, to
reducing student attrition [16].
III.
OVERVIEW OF E-LEARNING SYSTEMS
E-learning
refers
to
the
use
of Information
and
communication technologies in education and learning. It
is enabled through the use of e-learning systems, which
offer a wide range of capabilities and features from simple
asynchronous content management, to synchronous virtual
classrooms. The most agreed upon terms used to classify
such systems based on their capabilities and features are:
Learning Management System (LMS), which are software
applications that deliver, manage, and track e-learning
education courses\ training programs, Content or Course
Management
System
(CMS),
which
are
software
applications that manage –in terms of creation and
administration-content on educational\training websites,
Learning Content Management System (LCMS), which
are software applications that fulfill the characteristics of a
LMS (administrative and management) and a CMS
(content creation and administration), and Virtual Learning
Environment (VLE), which are software systems that
provide virtual classrooms for students and teachers to
interact with each other by the integration of web 2.0 tools.
The features and capabilities that are implemented in an
e-learning system depend on specific institutional needs
and targeted markets. Though, common features in most e-
learning systems include [22]:

Structure
–
organization
of
all
learning-related
functions into one system.

Security – protection from unauthorized access to all
system content.

Registration – finding, selecting or assigning courses.

Delivery – delivery of learning content to learners.

Interaction
–
including
some
types
of
learner
interaction: with the content, with other learners, with
instructors, and with course administrators.

Assessment –collection, tracking, and storing of
assessment data.

Tracking
–
tracking
of
learner
data
indicating
progress\usage.

Reporting – extraction and presentation of required
information.

Record keeping – storage and maintenance of data
about learners.

Personalization – configuration of e-learning system
to match personal preferences\organizational needs.

Integration – the ability to exchange data with external
systems.

Administration –
centralized
management
of all
system functions.
Due to the notable advantages of e-learning and the
widespread application of information and communication
technologies, many organizations and schools are making
more investments in acquiring e-learning systems to
support
and
improve
learning
[23].
Cost-effective
alternatives to buy or develop in-house e-learning systems
are open source e-learning systems. Currently, there are
more than 250 commercial e-learning systems and more
than 45 of them are Open Source Software (OSS) [24].
Among the most popular open source e-learning
systems are Moodle, Dokeos, Claroline, ILIAS, OLAT and
others.
To ensure a fair argument, this paper will compare
seven e-learning systems under the same category -open
source-
namely
ATutor,
Claroline,
Dokeos,
ILIAS,
Moodle, OLAT, and Sakai. The selection of open source
over proprietary e-learning systems is because of the
advantages they provide, such as [25]:

Ease of customization to meet specific organizational
needs because their code is open.

Ease
of
localization
by
modifying
language
preferences.

No licensing costs.

Faster
bug
fixes
because
of
active
supporting
communities.

Compatibility and extensibility with third party add-
ons.
Following is a brief description of each one of the e-
learning systems under comparison.
A.
Moodle
Moodle is a free, open source educational software
platform categorized as an LMS and VLE. It was
developed with a focus on helping educators create online
courses that are interactive and collaborative. It was
released to the public in 2002 and its high modularity and
ease of use are of its most appealing advantages and is
what makes it most popular among small-to-medium and
higher education business markets.
B.
ILIAS
ILIAS is a free, open source, web based LMS and
VLE. Although the project started in 1997, it was only
released for public in 2000 as open source software. ILIAS
is commonly used in public and private institutions and
companies because of its multi-purposes: course player
tool, authoring tool, and communication and collaboration
platform. It is also popular in the security and defense
sector
because
of
its
defense-specific
security
and
interoperability requirements considerations.
C.
Sakai
Sakai is a free, open source educational software
platform considered as an LMS, CMS and VLE. Sakai was
built by a consortium of five large U.S. universities and is
based on existing tools contributed by each of these
universities. It was first released to the public in 2005 and
has gained popularity for its scalability, security, and high
support for end features, which made it especially popular
among large universities.
D.
ATutor
ATutor is a free, open source LCMS and VLE. ATutor
was designed with emphasis on accessibility (access
alternatives to screen elements, and text alternatives to
visual screen elements) and adaptability (with various
teaching and learning scenarios). ATutor was first released
123
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-325-4
ACHI 2014 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

in
2002,
and
it
is
effective
for
small
and
large
organizations presenting their materials on the Web, or
delivering online courses.
E. Claroline
Claroline is a free open source LMS and LCMS that
serves the educational more than the corporate sector. It
provides a space for training and collaboration and was
released for the public in 2001. Claroline is based on
pedagogical principles found in literature. It is popular for
its high adaptability to different training/learning contexts,
customizability by offering a flexible work environment,
and the valuable offered tools that enable the instructor to
use it in order to create rich course material.
F. Dokeos
Dokeos is a free open source corporate learning suite,
which is technically considered as an LMS, and VLE. It
has started as a company and LMS in 2004. It has four
separate components to build e-learning content, to handle
interaction with learners, to sell a course catalog, and for
assessment and certification. It is popular for its high
simplicity and reporting capabilities. Also, it supports
flexible free or non-free extended tools such as authoring,
video
conferencing,
quiz
building,
assessment,
and
reporting to administration tools.
G. OLAT
OLAT is a free open-source learning platform that
launched in 1999. It is considered as an LMS that offers
several languages and features that support e-assessments,
collaborative groups, and interactive/effective learning.
IV.
APPLIED EVALUATION APPROACH
Here, we will compare and evaluate seven most
popular open source e-learning systems, described above,
namely, ATutor, Claroline, Dokeos, ILIAS, Moodle,
OLAT, and Sakai. This evaluation is conducted to check
the available functionalities that may support and enhance
interactive engagement in the learning process offered by
these systems.
To evaluate such systems, we investigated eight
synchronous and asynchronous capabilities that can aid to
support interactive engagement. These capabilities are
(virtual classroom, messaging, forums, chat room, wikis,
groups, games, multimedia support).
Our evaluation consisted in installing such systems,
and using them as regular users with the help of systems
manuals/documentations (if needed). We used a score
scale (0-3) for the evaluation; 0 if the system does not offer
the capability, 1 if the capability is partially supported and
system does not offer the adequate main functionalities, 2
if the system supports the capability by offering the main
functionalities,
3
if
the
system
provides
more
functionalities than the main ones, so the capability is
highly supported by the system.
V.
INTERACTIVE ENGAGEMENT CAPABILITIES
In this section, we will list and explain the capabilities
that support interactive engagement in e-learning systems,
and on which we will base our comparison between
ATutor, Claroline, Dokeos, ILIAS, Moodle, OLAT, and
Sakai.
Mainly, most of these capabilities-if supported by a
system- are offered as plugins or by integration, so users
can install and configure any one of these functionalities
based on his needs. Communication, collaboration, and
cooperation are
very important
factors
to
introduce
interactive engagement. Based on that, we selected eight
synchronous and asynchronous functionalities that support
these three factors and may lead to obtain an interactively
engaging learning environment. The selected capabilities
are as follows:
1.
Virtual classroom: it includes three main capabilities
which are:
-
Whiteboard:
synchronous tool that keeps the
students focused during class by allowing them to
clarify ideas, and share what they draw/write on
it.
-
Web and video conferencing: synchronous tool
allows users in separate multiple locations to
create
real
time
classroom
by
using
telecommunication
technologies
to
simultaneously communicate two-way video and
audio
transmissions,
content
sharing,
and
slideshow presentation.
-
Screen sharing: by depending on number of
protocols, it is a feature that allows the user to
connect to a computer in separate locations to see
that computer's desktop, and interact with it as if
it were local.
2.
Messaging: asynchronous tool that allows students to
send emails/messages to their fellow students or
instructors and vice versa.
3.
Forums: it includes:
-
News/announcement forum: asynchronous tool
that
allows
users
to
announce
about
any
event/activity related to courses.
-
Discussion forum: asynchronous tool for students
and their instructor to discuss any ideas or details
related to any course class/ lecture or issues.
4.
Chat room: synchronous text based discussion.
5.
Wikis:
asynchronous
tool
used
to
create/update
collaboratively web pages/documents by students and
instructors.
6.
Groups: asynchronous tool that allows instructor to
divide students as groups to do a specific task or
activity.
7.
Game: this functionality is used to apply game based
learning by offering some games that achieve a
specific goal in the learning process.
8.
Multimedia support: a main capability that support
adding/embedding,
sharing,
and
viewing
video/audio/image files related to course/class content.
VI.
EVALUATION RESULTS
In this section, we present the evaluation results of our
study. Table 1 shows the results for each system based on
the offered functionalities. Mainly, all systems offer a
basic set of synchronous and asynchronous functionalities
124
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-325-4
ACHI 2014 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

that help the instructor to increase the level of interactive
engagement in a course.
The results in Table 1 show that Moodle and Dokeos
achieve higher mean value than other systems, and that
means they offer more functionalities related to interactive
engagement, ILIAS and ATutor offer less functionalities
than Moodle and Dokeos. Sakai and Claroline achieve the
same value of interactive engagement support. Although
these systems achieve different values of support, they
provide the main and important interactive engagement
capabilities. One of these important capabilities-virtual
classrooms- is slightly supported by OLAT that achieve
the lowest support value.
Although the scores that were achieved appear to be
close, the impact of an additional functionality can
increase the usability of the e-learning system greatly [26].
All e-learning system that have been evaluated, other
than Moodle and Dokeos, do not support the game
functionality, which is a valuable capability that assists to
make the learning fun and helps to keep the students
focused and engaged.
This kind of capability supports
game based learning that helps to increase the engagement
of students [27].
Also, Sakai Claroline and OLAT do not highly support
Multimedia services, which is a basic capability that is
used by most e-learning systems to assist the learning
process. Multimedia support capability can improve the
interaction/communication between students and their
instructors by enabling them to share some media related
to their course, discuss it, and post comments.
Furthermore, OLAT does not provide enough virtual
classroom functionalities, such as whiteboard and video
conferencing, to support the interactivity of the learning
process.
VII.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we showed that interactive engagement
functionalities are essential in evaluating the usability of
e-learning systems. The study first investigates the
importance of interactive engagement from a pedagogical
point of view, and its importance to be supported by e-
learning systems to enhance their effectiveness and
therefore their usability. After that, we suggested a list of
eight capabilities that may provide an interactively
engaging
e-learning
environment.
Furthermore,
we
evaluated a number of open source e-learning systems to
check their support for these functionalities. As a result,
we found that Moodle and Dokeos can introduce better
interactive engagement by supporting more functionalities
than ILIAS, ATutor, Claroline, OLAT and Sakai.
Although the results of the evaluation were close, each
single functionality adds great value to an e-learning
system and its capability of providing an interactive
engaging learning environment.
