Abstract—This paper explores various Social Network Analysis
(SNA) techniques in order to identify a range of potentially
‘important’ members of Islamic Networks within Dark Web Fo-
rums. For this experiment, we conducted our investigation on ﬁve
forums collected in previous work as part of the Dark Web Forum
portal and built upon the tool support created in our previous
research in order to visualise and analyse the network. Whilst
existing work attempts to identify these structures through state-
of-the-art Computational Linguistic techniques, our work relies
on the communication metadata alone. Our analysis involved ﬁrst
calculating a range of SNA metrics to better understand the group
members, and then apply unsupervised learning in order to create
clusters that would help classify the Dark Web Forums users into
hierarchical clusters. In order to create our social networks, we
investigated the effect of repeated author resolution and various
weighting schemes on the ranking of forum members by creating
four social networks per forum and evaluating the correlation
of the top n users (for n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100). Our
results identiﬁed that varying the weighting schemes created more
consistent ranking schemes than varying the repeated author
resolution.

INTRODUCTION
With the dawn of the digital revolution, the Internet has
transformed the way in which people communicate with each
other. One area in which this has been seen is within ter-
rorist networks[1], [2]. The near-instantaneous responses from
users now achievable with these developing technologies and
the increased audience has meant that previous face-to-face
interactions and radical discussions have migrated to online
mediums [3], [4]. This migration has led to an increase in the
popularity of Dark Web Forums as a means of sharing text
based content as well as links to other sites, videos and rich
Web 2.0 features [5].
Even before the increased adoption of dark web forums,
researchers have used social network analysis to identify key
individuals within these groups. Numerous researchers have
investigated various techniques in order to retrospectively
understand the inner-workings of the 19 terrorists involved in
the September 11th attacks in 2001[6]. Early research involved
sourcing news articles related to the known suspects after the
event and analysing the structure of the group after the event
and with known targets [7]. Others have focused on researching
how different terrorists organisations work together [8] by
performing social network analysis [9].
The widespread adoption of the Dark Web Forums have
enabled researchers to analyse the rich source of data [10]
and has enabled researchers to establish a greater insight
into the inner workings of some of these groups. Whilst
existing research has been undertaken into creating a social
network topology for Dark web Forums [11], these existing
research focus on small communities and networks and rely on
sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques, which are difﬁcult
to scale when evaluating millions of messages[12].
Since the revelations of metadata collection exposed by
Edward Snowden in 2013 [13] , the importance of metadata
from emails has gained awareness. In light of these revelations,
many individuals have been unsure of their own risk exposure
using these metadata techniques alone. Existing work has been
effective at establishing hierarchy from the metadata of email
communications alone [14], [15]. Such metadata include the
post’s author and timestamp. In this paper, we set out to
investigate whether similar techniques could be applied within
Dark Web Forums and assess to what extent we can identify
the social structure of the networks.
Our paper is focused on the research question “Using com-
munication metadata alone, can we make reasonable inferences
about the structure of terrorist groups”. In particular, we set
out to trial various Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques
in order to identify a range of potentially ‘important’ members
of the forums.
A. Social Network Analysis (SNA)
For decades, complex interactivity between entities has
been modelled as networks. These include the internet [16],
food webs and biochemical networks [17]. For each network,
entities (such as computers, routers, animals, etc.) are consid-
ered as nodes or vertices that are connected together by links or
edges (such as communications between computers, the ﬂow
of energy within a food network, etc.)
Link Analysis (LA) is the analysis of information ﬂow
within the networks above and has been a topic of study for
several decades [18], [19]. A Social Network (SN) is deﬁned
as the representation of communication networks where the
nodes are people and the edges correspond to the relationships
between and Social Network Analysis (SNA) is deﬁned as
the application of Link Analysis to a social network. We can
perform SNA on our newly created social network, where the
ﬂow of information corresponds to the ﬂow of information on
the forums which allows us to perform SNA on our network
to determine hidden network structures.
II.
METHODOLOGY
In order to assess the extent of the network discovery of our
forums, we begin by collecting the forum posts. This in turn
97

SOTICS 2015 : The Fifth International Conference on Social Media Technologies, Communication, and Informatics

allowed us to extract the metadata from each forum from which
to build our network. Once we had extracted the metadata
mentioned above, the next step was to create a social network
representation of each forum. We then set out to experiment
ways in which we create a social network representation of
the communication data [see section II-A]. Figure 1 shows an
overview of our process.
Figure 1.
An outline of our approach to extract social structure from online
communications
From this social network, we calculated the top-ranked
SNA metrics from previous work [14]. After calculating the
metrics for each node within the network, we then used unsu-
pervised machine learning to identify clusters of interest within
our network. Unsupervised machine learning was selected due
to the unavailability of ground truth of the seniority of the
forum members (other than identifying the top posters). Given
the nature of our metrics chosen, the clusters will be grouped
based on the similarity of their metrics, which in turn we
hypothesise reﬂects the importance of the individual within
the network.
A. Creating the Social Network
Once the metadata for each forum was collected, we then
set out to experiment the ways in which to convert the metadata
into a Social Network. We convert the metadata into a social
network using algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 Algorithm to convert a forum into a social
network where w(a, s, m) is the weighted score of the message
m from sender a to sender s and is determined based on our
design decisions below and SNW(s1, s2) is the overall weight
of the directed edge between s1 and s2 in our Social Network
for a given forum f.
for each thread t in forum f do
for each message m in t do
a = author(m)
for each previous sender s in thread t do
SNW(a, s) = SNW(a, s) + w(a, s, m)
end for
end for
end for
For this evaluation we experimented with two distinct
methods of handling when an author posted multiple times in
the same thread (Repeated Author Resolution) and two distinct
ways of increasing the weight between two members based on
the Time difference between responses.
In order to illustrate the application of our methods, Figure
2 shows an example of a forum with two members and four
posts.
1) Repeated Author Resolution: In Figure 2, our forum
posts shows two posts for sender1 and two posts for sender2.
Our experiment tested 2 ways of handling repeated authors
within a thread.
Figure 2.
An example forum post with two members and four posts
Unique Senders: For this method, we only consider those
senders that are unique within each thread. In this case, if we
see an author reply to a thread they have previously commented
on, we only add the weight for the most recent comment on
the thread. In our example in Figure 2 when updating the
scores after message4, only w1 and w2 would be added to
SNA(sender2, sender1) and SNA(sender1, sender1) respec-
tively and w3 would not be calculated or added.
All Senders: For this method, we consider every sender
within each thread and include duplicate senders. In this case,
if we see an author reply to a thread they have previously
commented on, we add the weight for each comment on
the thread. In our example in ﬁgure 2 when updating the
scores after message4, SNW(sender2, sender1) is increased
by w1 + w3 and SNW(sender1, sender1) would be increased
by w2.
2) Weighted Date Resolution: When a new author a con-
tributes a message ma to a thread t where senders s1, s2, . . . sk
have previously commented, let dsi be the date that sender si
sends a message msi in the thread t. We then need to calculate
w(a, si, ma) for all i. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness
of including all or unique senders, we also evaluated two
distinct ways to calculate the weightings based on the time
difference (dt) between the two messages. The two methods
we used to calculate the weightings were ‘uniform weighting’
and ‘inverse proportionality weighting’.
Uniform weighting: Our ﬁrst model assumed that the
strength of the connection between two messages within a
thread is independent on the amount of time taken to respond to
a message. In this case, ∀i, w(a, si, ma)= 1. Whilst this allows
for a simple view of our forum, we set out to explore whether
this model may not be representative as the same weight is
given to a response to a message on the same day as a message
with a response delay of 4 weeks.
Inverse Proportionality weighting: In order to overcome
the issue outlined above, our second model was created on the
assumption that the closer a response is in time, the stronger
the weight of the connection between two users. In this case
∀i, w(a, si, ma) =
1
1+(da−dsi). This model ensures that ∀i, 0 <
w(a, si, ma) < 1.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Datasets
For this experiment we evaluated 10 of the forums collected
as part of the Dark Web Forum Portal dataset[26]. This dataset
was collected by crawling a variety of radical websites [27]
and allows us to compare the results and its applicability over
multiple forums. Table II shows a breakdown of each forum
used as part of the experiment.
In order to ensure that the connections in our graph reﬂect
meaningful connections within the network, members whose
edge weights are less than 10 are pruned from our graph.
This allows the graph to reﬂect the strong connections whilst
removing those connections that do not play a central role
within the network. As such, given the different weighting
approaches for each scheme, after pruning edges with edge
weight less than 10, each social network contained varying
numbers of vertices with 1 or more edges.
For each of our seven terrorist network datasets, we created
four social networks using the combination of metrics below.
Once the network was created, we then calculated our SNA
metrics and performed unsupervised machine learning.
•
Uniform weighting and unique senders
•
Uniform weighting and all senders
•
Inverse-Proportionality weighting and unique senders
•
Inverse-Proportionality and all senders
In order to evaluate the appropriateness of each of our
methods, we performed Unsupervised Learning using Expec-
tation Maximisation (EM) [28] in order to create clusters in
order to classify forum members. EM was chosen as it is able
to handle unobserved data and missing datapoints, which can
reﬂect the fact that we may only have a partial view of the
network by observing the online forums alone.

sized by the node’s HITS hub score.
B. Tool Support
To allow us to visualise the results of our social network
analysis and easily switch between the different weighting
schemes and repeated author resolution, we built upon our
existing tool [14] by adding additional features to allow users
to provide their own weighting scheme to create their own
Social Network Representation of the underlying forum data.
Figure 4 shows an example screenshot of our tool support
displaying the social Network of the Ansar1 Network using
repeated authors and inverse proportionality weighting.

Our evaluator identiﬁed 5 main clusters ranging in size
from 1 to 42 users. From our results, we can immediately
identify that cluster 2 (with 1 user) has a signiﬁcantly greater
score on almost all metrics compared to the other clusters
followed by cluster 3. This leads us to believe that user 17 (the
sole user in cluster 2) has signiﬁcantly higher inﬂuence within
the network, compared followed by those members in cluster
3 and as such, these users are potential candidates for being
“important” users within the Ansar1 network. The signiﬁcantly
lower standard deviation for clusters 1 and 4 indicate that these
users are likely to be less important in the network with their
low scores in the ranking metrics (e.g. PageRank, HITS Hub,
etc.).
We also evaluated the difference in ranking of each created
social network and Table IV shows the top ten ranked users

works identiﬁed user 17 as the most inﬂuential user and agreed
on the top three users (but had different orderings of users 0

exception of the UniformAllDates network, which substitutes

author resolution has on our model, we evaluated the con-
sistency of our rankings with schemes by comparing the top
n ranked users (for n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100) using
Spearman’s Coefﬁcient Ranking [29], Kendall’s Tau Measure
[30] and Pearson’s Correlation Coefﬁcient [31]. Table V and

only one degree of freedom (either identical weighting and
different repeated author resolution or vice versa). Our results
showed that on average, varying the repeated author resolution
caused less variation in the ranking of the metrics in the
ﬁnal social network when applied for n < 50. However, the
difference between rankings based on their repeated author

resolution diminishes as n increases. This leads us to believe
that performing two social networks, one using repeated au-
thors and one using unique authors only may provide subtly
different views of the graph, which in turn will allow us to
gain more insight from the social network.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In our paper, we set out to investigate the effectiveness
of using metadata alone to identify inﬂuential and important
users on Dark Web Forums. We set out to investigate the
effect of repeated author resolution and various weighting
schemes on our rankings by creating four social networks per
forum and evaluating the consistency of the top n users (for
n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100). We also performed unsupervised
machine learning for each of network in order to identify
clusters by user’s importance. Our results showed us that
difference in rankings from different weighting schemes were
more consistent on average than those using different repeated
author resolution techniques.
In order to allow us to further evaluate the validity of our
work, we hope to establish an authoritative ground truth in
order to assess the relative performance of our work. Another
direction we hope to take the research is to perform dynamic
analysis on our network and assess how the network changes
over time. This technique could then be applied to identify
potential insider threats within the Dark Web Forums by
observing abnormal dynamic behaviour. In order to allow
