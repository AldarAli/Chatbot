Abstract—Energy is an important issue in designing wireless
sensor networks. Coverage and connectivity are not of less
important since they are necessary for the network to be
operational. In this work, we consider the case of wireless video
sensor networks where some sensors have visual capabilities.
We study the beneﬁt of having some mobile nodes able
to move in the network ﬁeld so coverage and connectivity
constraints are satisﬁed while saving energy. We formulated
this problem using integer linear programming. We performed
several experiments using the CPLEX solver, to get some
insight into the contribution of mobility in the context of video
streaming. We mainly show that, even if mobility cost is much
higher than communication, the latter tends to be predominant
in the overall consumed energy as the video session duration
increases. Thus, justifying the mobility cost.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in micro-electronics and wireless com-
munications allow the emergence of wireless sensor net-
works (WSN) which are currently a hot research area [1].
Research effort in WSN mainly focused on scalar ones
with large number of sensors able to sense environmental
data (temperature, pressure, location of objects ... ), perform
speciﬁc processing on them and collaborate to achieve appli-
cations’ requirements. More recently, the availability of low-
cost CMOS cameras and microphones, Wireless Multimedia
Sensor Networks (WMSN) [2] gained more interest and
research effort. In a WMSN, the scalar WSN is strengthened
by introducing the ability of retrieving richer information
content through image and video/audio sensors [3][4][5][6].
This can signiﬁcantly enhance a wide range of applications
like object detection, surveillance, recognition, localization,
and tracking.
While sensors are small devices mostly running on bat-
teries, the network should operate autonomously for long
periods of time in most applications. This is why energy is an
important issue in WSN and becomes an important research
topic. Other issues such as coverage and connectivity in
a WSN are not of less importance. When some areas
of the ﬁeld become uncovered, the mission of the entire
network may be affected especially when the uncovered
area is security critical. Connectivity, for its part, allows the
different sensors to be able to reach each other as well as the
sink (central controller or a gateway). Lack of connectivity
could create unconnected sets in the network leading to some
sensors to be unable to reach the sink.
Due to connectivity and coverage issues, nodes have to
be placed carefully when deployed in the network ﬁeld
according to the target application. Good coverage and
strong connectivity can be achieved through careful plan-
ning of node densities and ﬁelds of view so the network
topology can be deﬁned before startup [7][8]. However, a
sensor network is dynamic by nature since sensors stop
working when they exhaust their on-board energy supply. In
a dynamic, hostile or hard-to-access environment, there is a
need to be able to dynamically redeploy the network such
that the application’s requirements in terms of coverage and
connectivity continue to be met while saving energy. This is
what we call On-demand repositioning. In [9] for instance,
sensor’s ability to move is used to distribute them as evenly
as possible in the region so coverage is achieved within the
shortest time duration and with minimal overhead. A survey
on node placement in WSN can be found in [10].
In this work, we consider a wireless video sensor network
(WVSN) where a subset of the nodes are equipped with
cameras. We explore the possibility of having locomotion ca-
pabilities at some sensors so they are able to move [11]. The
aim of this work is to save the overall communication energy
in a video session by allowing mobile nodes to move. Even
if mobility cost may be higher than communication, moves
can be justiﬁed by preserving coverage and connectivity in
the network. Moreover, moves are generally performed only
once, at the beginning of a session, so video applications
characterized by their large amount of data can have a small
mobility cost as the video duration increases.
Our approach is based on linear programming where we

extended the work of [12] so both coverage and connectivity
are considered. Additionally, our formulation ﬁts the case
of heterogeneous networks where video and scalar nodes
coexist. Nodes may have different types of energy supplies
(traditional batteries, solar or wind energy, etc.). Energy
levels at nodes can be considered in the model so the
network lifetime is increased. The paper is organized as
follows. Section II summarizes the related work and Section
III presents our network model with the different parameters
and assumptions made in this work. Our problem formula-
tion is presented in Section IV. Some numerical results are
given in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes and gives
some future directions.
II. RELATED WORK
The closest work to ours is the one of Kadayif et al.
[12]. An integer linear program is proposed to minimizes
energy consumption with the presence of mobile nodes. Our
work is an extended version of the linear program they
proposed so both coverage and connectivity are satisﬁed
in a heterogeneous WSN. In such a network, nodes may
have different type of energy supplies and can have different
sensing roles (video/scalar) and capabilities.
Assuming mobile sinks, [13] considers the case of mul-
tiple sink nodes positioning so the network lifetime is
maximized. The problem is formulated using a linear pro-
gramming model. Bredin et al. [14] studied the problem
of placing nodes at the network setup time where K-
Connectivity is achieved. K-Connectivity implies having
K independent paths among every pair of nodes. They
formulated the problem as an optimization model where the
number of additional nodes required by the K-Connectivity
is minimized.
One important concern in nodes placement is ﬁeld cov-
erage. In [15] the problem of maximum lifetime sensor
deployment with coverage constraints is considered and an
energy-efﬁcient INformation Gathering (SPRING) algorithm
is proposed. Cardel et al. [16] addressed the coverage
problem in WSN with adjustable sensing range. Based on
the assumption that longer sensing ranges consume more
energy, the aim is to give each sensor a coverage radius so
the overall consumed energy is minimized while assuring
the entire ﬁeld coverage.
Jaggi et al. [17] considered the problem of maximizing
WSN lifetime through activating a minimal set of sensor
nodes at any given time while both coverage and connectiv-
ity constraints are satisﬁed. A linear program is formulated
and a distributed algorithm for practical use in sensor
networks is developed. The WSN considered is composed of
static sensors. In this work, however, we aim to ﬁnd optimal
moves of mobile sensors so overall energy in the network
is minimized.
III. NETWORK MODEL
We consider a wireless sensor network of N sensor nodes
among which some are video sensors located in strategic
positions of a two-dimensional grid (N1 × N2). All sensor
nodes positions are assumed to be known and are given by
a boolean matrix P:
pi,j =
(
1
if there is a sensor at position (i, j)
0
otherwise
(1)
where 0 ≤ i ≤ N1 −1 and 0 ≤ j ≤ N2 −1. This assumes
that we consider a WSN with location awareness. Even if
only a few nodes have known positions by equipping them
with GPS or placing them deterministically, the remainder
of nodes positions can be computed from knowledge about
communication links [18].
The network is heterogeneous since it contains video and
scalar sensors with different energies and processing powers.
ci,j,i′,j′ is the amount of energy needed to transmit a 1-bit
message by a sensor located at (i, j) and to be received by
the one located at (i′, j′) and can be estimated using [19]:
ci,j,i′,j′ = αi,j(2 × Eelec + ϵamp × d2
i,j,i′,j′)
(2)
where di,j,i′,j′ is the distance between the two sensors
located at (i, j) and (i′, j′) positions, Eelec is the dissipated
energy by the radio to run the transmitter or the receiver
circuitry and ϵamp is the required energy by the transmit
ampliﬁer. We introduced a parameter αi,j, 0 ≤ αi,j ≤ 1,
deﬁned on a per sensor basis in order to individually consider
the energy capacities of each sensor node. For instance, a
mobile node with solar cells can be assigned an αi,j close
to 0 and a node with a low energy level at a given time
(possibly with ubiquitous energy) can be assigned an αi,j
close to 1. Sensors in the network can have different energy
capacities. They can operate on batteries or even use energy
extracted from the environment, such as solar energy or
vibrations. This does not mean that the energy could become
inﬁnite [20] since harvesting energy can not be possible all
the time and could be insufﬁcient to provide sensors mobility
for instance.
In our network model, some nodes have locomotion
capabilities [11] so they are able to move. Their positions
can be known thanks to the mobility matrix B(N1 × N2):
bi,j =
(
1
if the sensor at location (i, j) is mobile
0
otherwise
(3)
To move from point (i, j) to (i′, j′) in the sensor ﬁeld,
the required energy is noted mi,j,i′,j′ and assumed to drain
much more energy compared to communication cost per bit
for the same distances, that is,
∀i, j, i′, j′ : mi,j,i′,j′/ci,j,i′,j′ = ρ > 1

In order to cover a given region or to avoid obstacles,
a video sensor with locomotion facility may move mainly
as a response to a sink request. However, a video sensor
is assumed to stay at its location for the whole session
when it begins capturing/transmitting images. Since there
is a big amount of data to be transmitted in a video session
and assuming that the transportation path is provided from
the network layer, a relatively long schedule of messages
send/receive can be obtained. We note by L, the number of
messages to be transmitted. S and R are the transmission and
reception matrices respectively before move where si,j,l = 1
if node at position (i, j) (before moving) sends the lth
message to another node and ri,j,l = 1 if node at position
(i, j) (before moving) receives the lth message from another
node. Each sensor node has a radio communication range rc
which is ﬁxed and can not be varied during the video session.
Finally, we assume that each sensor node is able to sense
within a disk of constant radius rs and introduce the notion
of coverage degree. Noted dc, it is the number of redundant
sensors that cover a given area. For video sensors, we aim to
obtain a soft video coverage as opposed to hard coverage. a
video sensor is able to move when there is another node to
replace it even if it is not a video sensor and can not insure
the same service degree (rich video capture). Nevertheless, it
can contribute in covering the sensor ﬁeld by sensing other
physical (scalar) phenomenon such as movement detection.
In a hard video coverage however, a video sensor moves
only if there is another video sensor that it is able to replace
it in the coverage of a given zone.
Notations and different parameters and variables used in
this paper are listed in tables I and II.

where E is the overall consumed energy including both
communication and movement cost and k is the number of
bits per transmitted packet. The different joined constraints
are explained below:
(5): a sensor node can move to any non-occupied place
and a move can only take place from an occupied position
in the network [12].
(6): any move to a non-occupied position is performed
by only one node ; otherwise this latter stays in its initial
position [12].
(7) and (8) give expressions of ˙S and ˙R, the emission and
reception matrices respectively after move.
(9): a non mobile node located at (i, j) (i.e. bi,j = 0)
stays at its initial position.
(10) and (11) are the connectivity constraints. A mes-
sage m is sent by one node and received by only one
node (unicast communication). Moreover two nodes can not
communicate unless they are in each other radio range. The
distance between the two nodes (after move) is less or equal
to the communication radio range [12].
(12) is the coverage constraint. Each position in the ﬁeld is
covered by at least dc nodes to satisfy the required coverage
degree. A node moves to position (i′, j′) from another one
(i′′, j′′) or it stays at its initial position i.e. i′ = i′′ and
j′ = j′′. Position (i, j) must be in the zone covered by the
sensor located at (i′, j′).
Illustrative Example: we consider a ﬁeld 10 × 10
where 20 sensor nodes are deployed as depicted by Figure
1(a) with 4 sources (at (3, 7), (4, 5), (1, 5) and (8, 8) willing
to transmit one message each to the sink. Taking rs = 2,
each sensor node covers in addition to its own position, the
24 neighboring ones: the node located at (3, 7) covers the
square area within the dotted boundary as shown in Figure
1. In this sensor ﬁeld, positions (0, 8) and (0, 9) are not
covered. We assume that the communication radio range
rs = 4 and that communications are only possible in single
hop (there is no underlying routing protocol). All sources
can not reach the sink in one hop.
(a)
(b)
Figure 1.
Illustrative Example: coverage and connectivity constraints
After applying our optimization program, all source nodes
as well as the sink move as shown by dashed arrows in
Figure 1(b). In this way, the required connectivity is satisﬁed
so all the sources can achieve the sink in one hop. Addition-
ally, the node located at (3, 7) moves to position (2, 7) so
the problem of coverage is solved (points (0, 8) and (0, 9)
become covered). The consumed energy is also reduced (for
one message with 1024 bits, 401mJ is consumed instead of
403mJ).
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In order to get some insight into the beneﬁt of mobility to
save energy in a WVSN, our formulated problem was coded
using AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) [21]
and solved using the CPLEX solver [22] on NEOS server
[23].
We consider the case of a grid of dimension 10 × 10
where 40 nodes among which a given ratio is assumed
to be mobile, are randomly placed. The sink is located
at position (0, 0) and depending on the experiment, one
to seven sources are randomly chosen in the ﬁeld. Paths
from each source to the sink are generated using MFR
(Most Forward within Radius) [24]. Each source is assumed
to capture and transmit a 10-second video sequence (Hall
Monitor [25]). Data packets are assumed to have 1024 bits
of payload. Information about paths, amount of data to be
transmitted and the size of packets allow us to generate the
corresponding communication schedule required as an input
of our ILP. For the energy model, we put in equation (2),
Eelec = 50nJ/bit and ϵamp = 0.1nJ/bit/m2.
Figure 2 plots the mobility to the overall consumed
energy ratio as a function of video duration for different
values of ρ. In this scenario, 20% nodes have locomotion
facilities and only one source is transmitting. The overall

Mobility to overall energy ratio for different values of ρ. One
source, 20% of nodes are mobile
consumed energy includes energy required by nodes to move
to their optimal positions and the consumed energy due
to transmitting/receiving data packets. We can see that if
we increase ρ (till 100,000) so the mobility cost is much
higher than the communication one and even for a small
video duration (0.1 second for instance), mobility cost is
at most about 18% of the overall consumed energy. It is
also to notice that the share of mobility in overall energy
consumption decreases with session duration. In fact, the
longer the video session, the larger the amount of data
to deliver. As a result, the communication cost increases
compared the mobility one where moves are performed only
once at the beginning of a session. Consequently, mobility
is well justiﬁed in the context of WMSN characterized by
their big amount of data.
In order to assess the gain obtained thanks to nodes
mobility, we plot curves of Figure 3 showing the amount
of energy (in Joules) saved when applying our optimiza-
tion problem as a function of video duration for different
densities of mobile nodes in the ﬁeld. We can see that the
amount of saved energy is higher for bigger number of
mobile nodes. Furthermore, when the video session duration
increases, saved energy is also increased. This conﬁrms
results obtained and observed in Figure 2. The amount of
energy saved allows for augmenting the lifetime of the entire
network.
Finally, we varied the number of transmitting sources from
1 to 7 and reported the amount of saved energy for different
video streaming durations ranging from 1 to 5 minutes.
Figure 4 plots this saved energy and shows, once again,
that when increasing the video duration, the saved energy
increases. When augmenting the number of sources until 5
sources, we save more energy. However when the number of
sources reaches 6, we get less energy saving. This is due to
the fact that when increasing the number of sources, some

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we formulated the problem of optimal node
placement in a WVSN so energy consumption is minimized
under coverage and connectivity constraints using ILP. We
performed several experiments to get some insight into the
beneﬁt of having some mobile nodes in the network in the
context of video streaming. We mainly showed that even if
mobility cost is much higher than communication, the latter
tends to be predominant in the overall consumed energy as
the video session duration increases.
Our problem formulation is O(N 2
1 × N 2
2 × L) and it is
difﬁcult to scale to large sensor networks. We suggest to
execute it at the sink for relatively small networks (at the
beginning of a video session) and off-line for larger ones
for optimal initial deployment. This study allowed us to
assess the contribution of mobility in saving energy. Our

optimal solution can be used to derive and evaluate the
effectiveness of localized and less complex algorithms based
on heuristics. Actually, we are developing and evaluating
distributed heuristics that approximate the optimal solution.
