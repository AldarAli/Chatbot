Abstract— Communication networks are not only important 
to society, they also consume a lot of energy. Recent years 
research has focused on Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) 
to decrease the energy consumption of mobile networks. Hence, 
this work investigates how to lower the energy consumption in 
the fronthaul network by choosing the right C-RAN functional 
split and the right type of fronthaul network. Different 
functional splits assign different loads to the fronthaul network, 
and this work considers how much impact the data load has on 
the fronthaul network’s energy consumption. At the same time 
different types of fronthaul network impact the energy 
consumption in different ways. The paper provides models to be 
used for calculating the energy consumption in different 
network types and for the choice of different functional splits. 
Results show huge differences in energy consumption between 
especially wired and wireless technologies. Considering the 
same functional split, the difference between the most energy 
consuming transport technology and the least energy consuming 
is 99.5% for LTE and 99.6% for 5G. For the Ethernet overlay 
alone, the difference in energy consumption between the, with 
regard to energy consumption, best and worst case scenario is 
99.3% per switch.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an enhanced version of [1]. The Information 
and Communications Technology (ICT) sector counts for 
over 2% of the world’s carbon emissions nowadays [2]. 
However, the energy consumption of the ICT sector is 
forecasted to increase by 8% by 2030 in the best case scenario, 
and by 20% in the worst case scenario [2]. The ICT sector 
covers many areas and one of them being mobile networks. 
Mobile networks are growing the most, among all ICT sectors, 
in terms of number of subscribers, traffic demand, connected 
devices and offered services [3]. The trend in mobile networks 
is that more and more capacity is required and the coverage 
should be everywhere. Hence, base stations are widely 
deployed to cover the largest area possible, in order to satisfy 
the users’ needs. The next generation of mobile networks, the 
5th Generation (5G), is approaching and promises more 
capacity and higher bitrates. Thus, an important parameter to 
consider is how this growth will affect the energy 
consumption in mobile networks. 
In the mobile network’s base stations, the power amplifier 
takes up most of the energy consumption, next comes the 
baseband processing and then the cooling [3]. Cloud-Radio 
Access Network (C-RAN) architectures have been introduced 
to lower these parameters. In C-RAN, the radio frequency and 
baseband processing functions from the base station are split 
in two units referred to as the Radio Unit (RU) and the 
Centralized Unit (CU). The concept is illustrated in Fig. 1. The 
RU is located close to the antenna at the antenna mast, thereby 
it is convection cooled and settles for a smaller amplifier. The 
CUs from several cells can be gathered in a datacenter, where 
it is possible for them to share processing powers when not 
used at the same time. Hence, C-RAN will have the possibility 
of saving energy consumption in the three most energy 
consuming parameters of the traditional base station. The RU 
and the CU are connected by a network segment called the 
Fronthaul (FH) network [4]. Originally, only the radio 
frequency functions were present in the RU, as the FH 
network required very large bitrates in order to transport a 
constant stream of raw In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) data 
blocks. These blocks of raw IQ data were transported using a 
special protocol, for example Common Public Radio Interface 
(CPRI). Recently, the concept of Functional Splits (FS) has 
been scrutinized, leaving more processing functions in the 
RU. The more functions are left locally in the RU, the lower 
the bitrate on the FH network, and gives the possibility of a 
bitrate varying with user load, but also a larger and more 
complex RU. Additional information regarding the FSs can be 
found in [4], which provides an in-depth analysis of the FSs 
including latency and impact on FH network. Selected FS 
options are illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows the RU and CU 
separated by the FH network, which is illustrated by a green 
dotted line. To the right in Fig. 2, the Long Term Evolution 
(LTE)/LTE-Advanced(LTE-A)/5G protocol stack illustrates 
the location of the different FSs selected for this paper. The 
LTE/LTE-A/5G protocol stack consists of, from the bottom

up: the Radio Frequency functions (RF), the physical 
processing (PHY), the Media Access Control (MAC), the 
Radio Link Control (RLC) and the Packet Data Convergence 
Protocol (PDCP). Further description of the protocol stack 
layers can be found in [4]. On the right side of the figure is a 
table stating the FH bitrates for LTE, LTE-A and 5G 
considering different FSs. These FH bitrates are based on 
calculations in [5] and extended using the parameters stated in 
Table I, to also include LTE and 5G. The FH bitrates are only 
considered for the Downlink (DL) direction. The FH bitrates 
reveal how extremely capacity demanding the FH is, it puts 
large requirements to the network carrying it. 
This work investigates how different FSs combined with 
different FH network types, impact the energy consumption in 
the FH network. The contribution of this paper includes new 
perspectives on energy consumption for different FH network 
options. The different FH network types considered in this 
paper are: point-to-point (PtP) fiber, Microwave Radio 
(MWR), Passive Optical Networks (PON) and Coarse 
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) networks, all of 
these are compared with an over layer of Ethernet. These FH 
network types are chosen based on the overview in [6], where 
the physical layer technologies that can carry an overlay of 
Ethernet are chosen. This paper is organized as follows: 
Section II provides an overview of research in this field. 
Section III introduces FH networks in general. Section IV 
presents energy consumption in the physical layer including: 
PtP fiber, MWR, CWDM and PON FH networking. Section 
V presents Ethernet FH networking including a detailed 
model for energy consumption in the Ethernet FH network. In 
Section VI, the different layers energy consumptions are 
combined. Section VII discusses the results provided, 
considering how to obtain an energy efficient FH network for 
5G. Section VIII concludes the paper. Compared to [1], then 
this work differentiates by introduction of Sections IV and VI. 
Remaining sections have been updated and modified. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
C-RAN has been the topic of much research in recent 
years. A detailed description of the technology is found in [7]. 
Liu et al. state in [8] how PtP connections refer to the classical 
FH transporting IQ data blocks over what is now known as FS 
8. Recent years research has looked into new FH 
opportunities, evolving the FH from PtP to shared 
connections. The Next Generation Mobile Networks 
(NGNM) provides in [6] a comprehensive study of the 
different options for FH transport including the five 
technologies selected for this paper: Ethernet, PtP, MWR, 
PON and CWDM networks.  FH networks have been the topic 
of some energy efficiency investigations: Fathy et al. [9] 
present a power model for a RF/PHY split PON FH 
considering sleep mode and active RUs. They find that the 
average network power consumption is lower using their 
“greedy selection” algorithm. The work in [10] investigates 
the energy consumption in the RU considering different FSs, 
digital and analogue. In [11] Tan et al. analyze the energy 
consumption in RF/PHY  split stating that 90 % of the energy 
is consumed by the RU, 9% by the CU datacenter and 1% by 
a 10G Ethernet PON FH network. The work in [12] by 
Kondepu et al. investigates the energy efficiency for the FH

network for a flexible FS, by switching on and off resources 
using Software Defined Networking (SDN).  
With regard to the findings provided in this section, this 
work represents an uninvestigated area of looking into the FH 
energy consumption of multiple FH options while considering 
different FSs individually. 
III. 
FRONTHAUL NETWORKS 
FH transport can use many different types of 
technologies, wired and wireless. The FH network consists of 
different elements, depending on the type of network. 
Networks operate in layers, and technologies must be 
evaluated based on, which layer they operate. The network 
types considered for the physical layer in this work covers 
fiber PtP, MWR, PON and CWDM. On top of this, in the data 
link layer, this work considers Ethernet. The layered 
transmission considered in this work is illustrated in Fig. 4. 
The figure illustrates how the transmission paths are 
determined by Ethernet but the physical transmission, or 
moving of data is performed in the physical layer.   
In the future 5G network, the RAN will be expanded with 
more antennas. This will increase the demands to the FH 
network even more, as not only higher bitrates shall be 
transported, but also more streams are present from the higher 
numbers of RUs and antennas. Our model (1) estimates the 
amount of RUs in an area covered by one CU assuming a 
circular coverage area. Equation (1) takes the area of the 
coverage area and divides it by the area of each cell, then sums 
up for all RATs:

𝜋∙𝐷𝑀𝐴𝑋2

DMAX is the maximum distance between the CU and the 
RU due to FH latency constraints. RATn is the maximal 
transmission distance for one single antenna per Radio 
Access Technology (RAT). The RATs describe whether 3rd 
Generation (3G), LTE, LTE-A etc. are present in the current 
area, as each RAT requires its own RU. Equation (1) 
summarizes the amount of RUs for all RATs present, because 
different RATs have different cell sizes.  
IV. 
ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE PHYSICAL LAYER 
This section introduces different options for physical 
layer FH transport and corresponding energy consumption 
models. 
A. PTP Fronthaul 
The traditional C-RAN FH network establishes a single 
PtP fiber transmission link between the CU and RU. The only 
energy consuming elements in this setup are the Small Form-
factor Pluggable (SFP) modules and the media converter. The 
SFP modules are transceivers that connect the CU and RU to 
the fiber in each end of the connection, the media converter 
converts the signal to Ethernet before transmission.  
1) PtP energy consumption 
This work uses SFP+ modules for reference consuming 
1.5 W each with a capacity of 10 Gbps  [13]. For media 
converter a 10 Gbps capable media converter consuming 7.2 
W is used for reference [14]. 
The amount of SFPs in PtP is dependent of the SFP 
capacity. For those FSs having a bitrate higher than the SFP 
capacity, the data stream will be split out on more channels, 
hence more SFPs. The number of SFPs per RU, SFPRU, is 
calculated in (2), and is always at least one: 
 
𝑆𝐹𝑃𝑅𝑈 = ⌈
𝐵𝐹𝐻
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑆𝐹𝑃⌉ , 𝑆𝐹𝑃𝑅𝑈  ∈ ℕ                 (2) 
 
In (2) BFH is the FH bitrate, which can be found in Fig. 2, 
and capSFP is the capacity per SFP. The total number of SFPs 
can be calculated as, SFPPtP.  
 
𝑆𝐹𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑃 = 𝑆𝐹𝑃𝑅𝑈 ∙ 𝑁𝑅𝑈 ∙ 2 , 𝑆𝐹𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑃 ∈ ℕ0          (3) 
The power consumed by PtP can then be calculated as 
PPtP, including the power per SFP, PSFP and the power per 
media converter, PMC, which is the same amount as the SFPs: 
 
        𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑃 = 𝑆𝐹𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑃 ∙ 𝑃𝑆𝐹𝑃 + 𝑆𝐹𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑃 ∙ 𝑃𝑀𝐶 , 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑃 ∈  ℝ       (4) 
 
2) PtP Results 
One PtP connection consumes 17.4 W for FS RLC/PDCP. 
This corresponds to 152.4 kWh per year. Fig. 5. Illustrates 
the energy consumption for one PtP fiber CU-RU connection. 
The figure illustrates how the energy consumption is the same 
for all FSs in LTE. But when considering LTE-A and 5G 
bitrates, the energy consumption starts to scale. The decrease 
in energy consumption between RF/PHY split and 
PHY/MAC split is 99.3 % for 5G and 93.8 % for LTE-A. 
B. MWR Fronthaul 
The MWR FH establishes a wireless PtP connection 
between the CU and RU. In a MWR link, the RU is connected 
via a cable to the baseband processing part, which is then 
connected to one or more Transceivers (TRX), depending on 
required FH capacity. Each of the TRXs are then connected 
to an antenna. The antenna transmits radio waves to another 
antenna located close to the CU. This antenna is connected to 
a TRX and a baseband processing part, connected to the CU. 
As each TRX requires another TRX at the receiving side, 
these will in the following be referred to as TRX pairs. The 
energy consuming elements in a MWR FH consists of the 
baseband processing part and the TRXs in each end of the 
link.  
1) MWR energy consumption 
To 
provide 
information 
about 
MWR 
energy 
consumption, energy measurements were performed using an 
Ericsson Mini link MWR setup [15]. The system power was 
measured using a Rohde and Schwarz power Analyzer  
HMC8015. The configuration considered in this example is 
28 MHz bandwidth and 1024-QAM modulation [15]. The 
baseband processing and one TRX in each end of the link 
consumes in total 250 W, and additional TRX pairs add 20 W 
on top of that [15]. These numbers assume that the TRXs are 
transmitting at the highest power. The capacity of each TRX

pair is 225 Mbps [15]. Studies show [15] that the power 
consumption of MWR links does not increase significantly 
with the user load. But another factor to consider is the 
transmission power, which when increasing also increases 
the energy consumption. The transmission power depends on 
the distance between the antennas, obstacles and weather 
conditions. 
In MWR each CU-RU connection is a wireless PtP 
connection. The capacity necessary for transmission of one 
link is described by the number of TRX pairs. Calculating the 
total number of TRX pairs T, is done using the FH bitrate BFH 
and the max capacity per TRX pair TRXcap: 
 
                              𝑇 = ⌈
𝐵𝐹𝐻
𝑇𝑅𝑋𝑐𝑎𝑝⌉ , 𝑇 ∈ ℕ0                         (5) 
 
The power consumption for the whole MWR FH, PMWR is 
then calculated using the power consumption of the baseband 
with one TRX pair included PBB and the power consumption 
of additional TRX pairs, PTRX: 
 
 
            𝑃𝑀𝑊𝑅 = 𝑃𝐵𝐵 + (𝑇 − 1) ∙ 𝑃𝑇𝑅𝑋 , 𝑃𝑀𝑊𝑅 ∈  ℝ            (6) 
 
2) MWR Results 
Fig. 6 illustrates the energy consumption for one RU-CU 
connection using the bitrates provided in Fig. 2. Note Fig. 6 
uses a logarithmic scale on the Y-axis. The figure shows the 
large differences in energy consumption between the 
different RATs. In 5G the difference between RF/PHY split 
and RLC/PDCP split is a 99.3 % decrease, where in LTE the 
same decrease is only 59.7 %. 
C. CWDM Fronthaul 
CWDM is a multiplexing technique utilizing several 
optical wavelengths in the same fiber [16]. This is a very 
efficient way to transport data over great distances, as the 
only components requiring power along the transmission 
path are optical amplifiers [16]. CWDM transports up to 18 
channels and for up to 60 km [16]. A CWDM network 
consists of a multiplexer that can combine data on several 
wavelengths, SFP modules, a fiber connection, one or more 
amplifiers along the path and a demultiplexer splitting the 
wavelengths out on the fibers connected to the individual 
RUs. The setup is illustrated in Fig. 7. Energy consuming 
elements in CWDM are the SFP modules, the media 
converters and the amplifiers along the transmission. The 
fiber medium does not consume any power itself and neither 
do the (de)multiplexers. 
1) CWDM energy consumption 
CWDM (de)multiplexers made with the newest 
technologies are passive and does not consume any energy 
themselves [17]. The transceivers considered for this CWDM 
system are CWDM SFP+ modules [13]. The CWDM 10 
Gbps SFP+ modules consume 1.5 W each [13]. The media 
converter is 10 Gbps capable and consuming 7.2 W [14]. 
The energy consumption model for CWDM is equal to 
the one for PtP. This is due to the fact that the 
(de)multiplexers do not consume any power themselves, the 
energy consumption corresponds to the same as PtP. 
2) CWDM Results 
The CWDM power consumption corresponds to the 
power consumption in PtP. 
D. PON Fronthaul 
A PON network consists of one Optical Line Terminal 
(OLT) connected by fiber to one or multiple Optical Network 
Terminals (ONT). For this work the PON version Gigabit-

PON (GPON) is considered [18],  this standard supports a 1.2 
Gbps datarate on the FH link [18]. The process of 
transporting data from the OLT to the ONT is performed on 
a “transmit when there is something to send” basis, because 
the OLT is aware of all ONTs. The process of transporting 
the user data from the ONT to the OLT is more complex in 
PON, and a process referred to as Dynamic Bandwidth 
Allocation (DBA) is used for uplink scheduling. The DBA 
process assigns bandwidth to the individual ONTs when they 
request it [18]. The issue when considering PON as a FH 
transport medium arises in the uplink scheduling delay. This 
problem can be solved by creating a request message in the 
CU and this way send it on an earlier state to the OLT [19]. 
1) PON energy consumption 
The products used for PON reference in this work is a 
Nokia ISAM FX-8 switch acting as the OLT using a 16 port 
line card, which means that this one device handles 16 OLTs 
at the time. Each of these OLTs connects up to 32 ONTs. The 
switch’s power consumption is not included in this physical 
layer section. The GPON linecard consumes 89 W and optics 
are SFP B+ modules consuming 0.6 W per ONT. 
The ONT considered for this work is an ICOTERA 
GPON FTTH ONT i5800-series with a maximum power 
consumption of 14.4 W [20].  
The PON FH energy consumption model is first 
calculating how many ONTs are necessary, per ONT-OLT 
connection in order to transmit the required FH bitrate, 
ONTpair: 
 
𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 = ⌈
𝐵𝑅𝐹𝑆
𝐵𝑅𝑃𝑂𝑁⌉ , 𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 ∈ ℕ             (11) 
 
Where BRPON is the PON maximum bitrate and BRFS is 
the maximum FH bitrate of the current FS. Then the number 
of ONTs connected to each OLT is calculated, ONTOLT:  
 
𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑂𝐿𝑇 = ⌊
𝐵𝑅𝑃𝑂𝑁
𝐵𝑅𝐹𝑆 ⌋ , 𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑂𝐿𝑇 ∈ ℕ              (12) 
 
Then the number of OLTs in PON are calculated, 
PONOLT: 
 
𝑃𝑂𝑁𝑂𝐿𝑇 = ⌈
𝑁𝑅𝑈
𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑂𝐿𝑇∙𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟⌉ , 𝑃𝑂𝑁𝑂𝐿𝑇 ∈ ℕ0    (13) 
 
Here NRU is the number of RUs in the area. Then it should 
be calculated how many linecards NLC are necessary, where 
OLTLC is the number of OLT ports on the linecard. 
 
𝑁𝐿𝐶 = ⌈
𝑃𝑂𝑁𝑂𝐿𝑇
𝑂𝐿𝑇𝐿𝐶 ⌉ , 𝑁𝐿𝐶 ∈ ℕ0               (14) 
 
Then it is calculated how many SFP modules are 
necessary: 
 
𝑆𝐹𝑃 = (𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑂𝐿𝑇 + 𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟) + 𝑃𝑂𝑁𝑂𝐿𝑇, 𝑆𝐹𝑃 ∈ ℕ0  (15) 
 
From this the total power consumption, PPON, can be 
calculated: 
𝑃𝑃𝑂𝑁 = 𝑃𝐿𝐶∙𝑁𝐿𝐶 + 𝑃𝑆𝐹𝑃 ∙ 𝑆𝐹𝑃 + 𝑃𝑂𝑁𝑇 ∙ (𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑂𝐿𝑇 +
𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟) ,     𝑃𝑃𝑂𝑁 ∈  ℝ             (16) 
 
In (16) PLC is the power consumed by the linecard, PSFP is 
the power consumed by each SFP module and PONT is the 
power consumed by each ONT. 
2) PON Results 
Fig. 8 illustrates the energy consumption by PON for one 
CU-RU connection considering different RATs and different 
FSs. Especially in the 5G scenario, the energy consumption 
is scaling much, here the decrease between split RF/PHY and 
PHY/MAC is 99.3 %. In LTE the decrease between the same 
FSs is 37.1 %. 
E. Fronthaul networks comparison 
This section considers a scenario where multiple RUs are 
connected to one CU. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 9 
showing how multiple sites of 3-sectorized antennas are 
connected to one CU. In this use case, a FH network limited 
to 20 km by latency [7] using 3-sectorized antennas covering 
13 km2 per 3-sector, would need a total of 290 antennas/ RUs 
to cover the entire area calculated using (1). This example

only considers LTE as RAT. The results are summarized in 
Fig. 10 for LTE and Fig. 11 for 5G. 
For both LTE and 5G, the largest energy consumption is 
consumed by the MWR connections, and the smallest energy 
consumption is consumed by PtP/CWDM. If changing from 
MWR FH to PtP/CWDM FH the energy consumption will be 
halved, regardless of the FS used. It is though interesting to 
observe that for the smallest FH bitrates in LTE, then PON is 
the least energy consuming solution. 
V. 
ETHERNET FRONTHAUL 
Ethernet is a data link layer transmission technology, 
which can act as overlay on top of the physical layer 
technologies already presented in this paper. Where the 
physical layer is just acting as pipes, Ethernet switches are 
forwarding Ethernet frames in the intended direction. As a 
FH network, Ethernet benefits in being flexible and already 
widely used in other network segments. Table II summarizes 
three options for FH transmission. The option of transmitting 
FH data using CPRI; this option is most beneficial for FSs 
located between the RF and the resource element mapper 
function, i.e., FSs having a constant bitrate on the FH link [4]. 
The same FSs can be transported over Ethernet using a 
gateway to encapsulate CPRI into Ethernet frames; this is 
referred to as CPRI over Ethernet. Another solution is FH 
transmission over Ethernet. This solution is preferred for FSs 
with a variable bitrate on the FH link, i.e., those having the 
resource mapper function included in the RU. Table II 
represents the current status of the network – the RUs 
connected using CPRI, and the Ethernet solutions as an option 
for the future 5G FH network. 
The amount of RUs found in (1) can be used to find the 
estimated number of switches covering the current area. 
Hence, each RU is connected to one ingoing port in an 
Ethernet switch. Equation (17) expresses the lowest number 
of switches Nsw to cover an area: 
                      
𝑁𝑠𝑤 = ⌈
𝑁𝑅𝑈
𝑁𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡⌉ , 𝑁𝑠𝑤 ∈ ℕ0                       (17) 
 
In (17), Nport is the number of ingoing ports in each switch.  
Fig. 12 illustrates the composition of an Ethernet switch. An 
Ethernet switch consists of different components. Ethernet 
frames are received in input modules, which type depends on 
whether the network is optical or electrical. Then the Ethernet 
frames are sent into the switch via receiving ports. When 
entering the switch, the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is 
checked and the frame is stored in a FIFO queue. Then the 
address field in the frame is read, and matched in an address 
lookup process to the right outgoing port. Afterwards the 
frame is again stored in a FIFO queue, before it is sent to the 
outgoing ports and transmitted via output modules. All of 
these processes consumes energy depending on the FH link 
bitrate found in Fig. 2. 
A. Energy consumption 
The calculations in this paper uses a Cisco Catalyst 9200 
switch for reference. This switch has a standby power of 35 
W [21]. The switch has a power consumption of 42,27 W in 
case of full port traffic and 100% load [21]. The difference 
between standby and full load is thereby 7.27 W. Dividing this 
number into four switch processes, those mentioned in the 
previous sub section (FCS, MAC, FIFO, FIFO), a rough 
assumption is that each process consumes 1.8 W. The switch 
is assumed to use 24 ports running 1 Gbps speed and 
transmitting/receiving via SFP+ modules consuming 1.5 W 
each [22].

B. An Ethernet fronthaul energy consumption model 
In an Ethernet FH network, each switch consumes energy 
related to the amount of incoming traffic. This is expressed in 
(18), where PFH is the total power in W consumed when 
transmitting data over the FH network between the RU and 
CU. PSW is the total power consumed by one switch, and that 
is multiplied by the number of switches NSW [1]. 
 
                             𝑃𝐹𝐻 = 𝑃𝑆𝑊 ∙ 𝑁𝑆𝑊   ,  𝑃𝐹𝐻 ∈ ℝ                     (18) 
 
Equation (19) determines the power consumed in one 
switch. Pstandby is the power always consumed in the switch to 
keep it running. Ppk is the power consumed by the switch when 
forwarding one packet. Pbit is the power consumed by the 
switch when forwarding one bit. These numbers are 
multiplied by the number of forwarded bits, Nbit, and the 
number of forwarded packets, Npk. These numbers are 
dependent of the FH bitrate, which can be found in Fig. 2 [1]. 
 
 𝑃𝑠𝑤 = 𝑃𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑏𝑦 + 𝑃𝑝𝑘 ∙ 𝑁𝑝𝑘 + 𝑃𝑏𝑖𝑡 ∙ 𝑁𝑏𝑖𝑡  ,  𝑃𝑠𝑤 ∈ ℝ     (19) 
 
Determining the power consumed by the switch when 
forwarding one packet, requires the power consumed by the 
process only used once per packet, namely the MAC address 
lookup (PMAC). This function’s power consumption is divided 
by the maximal number of packets forwarded per second [1]. 
 
𝑃𝑝𝑘 =
𝑃𝑀𝐴𝐶
 𝑁𝑝𝑘(max) 𝑃𝑝𝑘 ∈ ℝ                    (20) 
 
Npk(max), the maximal number of packets forwarded per 
second, is calculated by dividing the switch’s maximum line 
bitrate by the minimum packet size. 
Determining the power consumed by the switch when 
forwarding one bit, requires the power consumed by the 
processes where each bit is handled, namely the reception 
(PRX), the FCS check (PFCS), two FIFOs (PFIFO) and the 
transmission (PTX). These functions power consumption is 
divided by the maximal number of bits forwarded per second 
[1]. 
 
         𝑃𝑏𝑖𝑡 =
𝑃𝑅𝑋+𝑃𝐹𝐶𝑆+𝑃𝐹𝐼𝐹𝑂∙2+𝑃𝑇𝑋
𝑁𝑏𝑖𝑡(max)
 ,  𝑃𝑏𝑖𝑡 ∈ ℝ        (21) 

Nbit(max), the maximal number of bits forwarded per 
second, is the switch’s maximum line bitrate. The given model 
is used for further investigation of the energy consumption in 
an Ethernet FH network. 
C. Results 
Based on the bitrate numbers provided in Fig. 2 and the 
Ethernet FH energy consumption model, are the following 
results obtained, illustrated in Figs. 13-17. 
Fig. 13 illustrates the input parameters from the model in 
Section IV. The numbers are based on FS RF/PHY using 5G 
RAT for one switch. The energy consumption is illustrated on 
a logarithmic scale as a function of different packet sizes. The 
figure illustrates how different sizes of packets do not affect 
the total energy consumed by all bits (Pbit*Nbit) and neither 
the standby power (Pstandby) this is as expected as none of 
these parameters are affected by increasing packet sizes. 
However, the energy consumed for all packets (Ppk*Npk) is 
much affected by different packet sizes. The decrease in 
energy consumption between transmitting only the smallest 
possible Ethernet packets, and only the largest possible 
Ethernet packets is 95.78%.

Fig. 14 illustrates the percentage of total switch energy 
consumption as a function of the packet sizes. The figure 
illustrates different FSs using 5G RAT. It is clear that the 
RF/PHY split consumes the largest percentage of energy. The 
figure shows how large effect the packet size has, thus the 
energy consumption percentage decreases slightly when the 
packets are larger. It is not possible to see the FSs PHY/MAC 
and RLC/PCP in the figure as they consume much less energy. 
However, in those splits the decrease in energy consumption 
between transmitting only the smallest possible Ethernet 
packet, and only the largest possible Ethernet packet is 2.66% 
in both cases whereas for the RF/PHY split the difference is 
2.84%. 
Fig. 15 illustrates the energy consumption in the FH 
network when using different FSs and different RATs. Note 
that it is illustrated on a logarithmic scale. This calculation 
assumes that the packet size is 1518 B. The figure shows the 
energy consumption in the FH network using LTE, LTE-A 
and 5G RATs. The figure states huge differences in power 
consumption for the different FSs using LTE-A and 5G. In 
5G, the energy saving by using split PDCP/RLC compared to 
split RF/PHY is 99.32% per switch, compared to LTE where 
the energy saving is only 27.66% between the two splits. Or 
in other words if assuming one household consumes 3500 
kWh per year, then the FH energy consumption in 5G using 
split RF/PHY covers 199 households per switch, where split 
PDCP/RLC covers less than 1.5 households per switch. In Fig. 
15, the power consumption for LTE does not differ much 
when comparing the different FSs, meaning that significant 
energy consumption reductions or increases will not be 
present using this RAT. 
Fig. 16 shows the yearly FH energy consumption in kWh 
using 5G RAT. This calculation assumes that the packet size 
is 1518 B. The energy consumption is illustrated by the 
increasing number of switches. As the figure shows, then the 
Energy consumption increases by number of switches in the 
network. The figure illustrates how much energy is required 
to run a FH network with many switches. 
Fig. 17 illustrates on a logarithmic scale, how the FH 
energy consumption increases when more RUs are added to 
the network. In the figure, each switch is assumed to have 24 
ingoing ports, and the indent behavior of the graph shows the 
capacity of each switch. 
VI. 
FAIR INCLUSION OF LAYER PHY TECNOLOGIES 
The section aims to make the most fair comparison of the 
different PHY layer technologies using Ethernet transport. In 
general the comparison is difficult as PtP/CWDM results 
consider a 10 Gbps capacity system where the PON 
technology is only represented by a 1 Gbps capacity. But as 
numbers for energy consumption are difficult to find, it has 
been chosen to use confirmed energy consumption values and 
not estimated ones. For PtP/CWDM the Ethernet switch 
energy consumption is just added to the layer PHY energy 
consumption. For MWR, the energy consumption of the 
Ethernet switch is not included, as the MWR system 
transports Ethernet frames, and in that regard, energy 
consumption of Ethernet is already included in the numbers 
provided. For PON the SFPs have already been included in 
the calculations for the PON energy consumption, therefore 
the SFP energy consumption of the Ethernet switch PRX and 
PTX has been excluded from the calculations. Further, for

PON, the number of Ethernet switches is equal to the number 
of linecards, NLC.  
Figs. 18 and 19 illustrate the huge impact of the bitrate in 
these measurements, because the tendencies in the two 
figures are very different. The only difference between these 
two figures is the used FS and hereby the FH bitrate. 
According to Fig. 2, then the bitrate is more than 10 times 
larger for RF/PHY than for RLC/PDCP considering LTE. 
This difference is significant for PON. Because in the 
RLC/PDCP scenario the FH bitrate is smaller than maximum 
PON capacity, resulting in ONTOLT > 1, meaning the capacity 
per OLT is shared among several ONTs. This results in PON 
having the lowest energy consumption in Fig. 19, whereas in 
Fig 18 ONTpair ≤ 1 and PON has the largest energy 
consumption. In this regard it would have been very 
interesting to compare with a 10 Gbps PON technology, but 
that must be a matter for future work. 
VII. DISCUSSION 
The energy consumption is an important matter 
considering all areas of the ICT sector. The mobile networks 
are no exception and within mobile networks the FH network 
must never be a bottleneck for the expensive RAN capacity, 
but neither should it consume more energy than necessary. In 
that regard, the FH network must be carefully aligned. This 
work considers different layers of FH network transport. 
Different technologies in the physical layer and Ethernet in the 
data link layer. The total FH energy consumption will be the 
sum of the energy consumption in the physical layer and the 
energy consumption by the Ethernet overlay. 
This work has looked into the energy consumption of 
different types of FH networks. In this regard, PtP fiber and 
CWDM definitely consume less energy compared to the other 
options. CWDM and PtP obtains very low results for energy 
consumption in this work, while it still have lots of capacity 
for the FH transmission. CWDM can be a solution to share 
resources in PtP scenarios because multiple links can be added 
to the same fiber. In reality CWDM will most likely be used 
to multiplex data from all RUs at the same base station onto 
the same fiber. 
When comparing the different FH network types in 
Section VI, MWR consumes the largest amount of energy. At 
the same time, the MWR results are the only ones based on 
real life measurements, and not data sheet numbers. The 
MWR results depend on the bitrate and it is very clear to see 
how much the FS and the RAT influence the energy 
consumption. MWR might not be the most optimal solution 
energy-wise, but in some situations it is not possible to deploy 
fiber. Then MWR is an easy deployment solution. 
PON as a FH network obtains in general higher energy 
consumption compared to the other wired solutions presented 
in this work, but not for lower bitrates as stated in Section VI, 
where the PON network is able to share the connections 
among several RUs. It should be noted that the energy 
consumption numbers provided in this work are only for 
GPON with a capacity of 1.2 Gbps, other PON solutions with 
higher bitrates, for example 10 Gbps or 40 Gbps, will most 
likely, according to Section VI, obtain much better results for 
energy consumption, because more resources can be shared 
among different users or more RUs. Unfortunately, it has only 
been possible to obtain energy consumption number for 
GPON for the examples in this paper. But, when having the 
power consumption for other PON solutions, the models in 
this work can still be used.  
Considering the multiple RUs use case in Section IV.E, 
where an area covered by 290 RUs were used as an example. 
Here, changing from MWR FH to PtP/CWDM FH the energy 
consumption will be halved, regardless of the FS used. This is 
a significant difference from the one RU-CU pair examples 
presented in section IV.A,B,C,D. But in these examples lower 
decreases in energy consumption were provided using LTE 
RAT. More specifically, PtP and MWR had the same energy 
consumption for all FSs, MWR had a decrease between split 
RF/PHY and PHY/MAC of 60% whereas is PON the decrease 
between the same FSs were 37%. 
Ethernet results in this work show how the choice of a FS, 
the number of RUs and the number of ingoing ports per 
Ethernet switch has huge impact on the energy consumption 
in an Ethernet FH network. The energy consumption does not 
differ much between the different FSs when considering LTE,

but when entering the era of 5G, the FH networks will suffer 
from large energy consumption. To lower the energy 
consumption in the FH network, the choice of a FS becomes 
very important, together with high capacity Ethernet switches, 
and packet sizes. Slight decreases are obtained by transmitting 
larger sized packets even in splits PHY/MAC and PCP/RLC. 
In the Ethernet FH energy consumption model, a fixed packet 
size is used, which is very optimistic. In reality packets will 
be of different sizes, and the smaller packets, the more packets 
are necessary to transmit the same amount of data. At the same 
time, every packet carries a header, so more packets means 
more headers. Hence, using smaller packets, more bits have to 
be transmitted. In relation to that, it might not always be 
possible to fill up an entire Ethernet packet. Some functions in 
the protocol stack are time critical, e.g., the HARQ process 
[23]. In a time critical transmission, the packet might need to 
be sent before it is filled, leading to smaller packets and more 
overhead transmission.  
This work provides an overview of the energy 
consumption of different network types. Products from 
different vendors or with higher capabilities may vary from 
these numbers provided. This work only considers the energy 
consumption, not the sustainability in using the resources 
already deployed. Or in other cases, one solution might be the 
only one possible, deployment-wise. Network operators can 
use the models provided in this work to estimate when it will 
be cheaper – energy-wise, to change already established 
equipment. Also for the case of green field deployment, the 
models provided can be used to evaluate the energy 
consumption of different solutions. 
The results representing 5G and the extremely high 
bitrates and energy consumption related to that is only an 
extrapolation, but is found useful as a guideline for what can 
be expected. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
This work investigated energy consumption in different 
types of FH networks for current and future mobile networks. 
The FH network connects the RU at the antenna site and the 
CU located in a datacenter. Different models for the FH 
energy consumption were presented, relating to different FH 
types. The outcome of this work shows the extremely high 
differences in energy consumption for different network 
types. Further, it is also important to choose the right FS, as 
significant reductions in energy consumption can be obtained. 
Many assumptions have been made due to lack of data but the 
paper gives an overview of the energy consumption in 
different network types and for the choice of different FSs. 
This makes the comparisons provided less accurate. But the 
models provided can be used for all vendors equipment and 
own numbers can easily be inserted. Results show that MWR 
consumes a lot of energy while CWDM consumes much less.  
If changing from MWR FH to PtP/CWDM FH the energy 
consumption will be halved, regardless of the FS used. For the 
Ethernet overlay alone, the difference in energy consumption 
between the, energy consumption wise, best and worst case 
scenario is 99.3 % per switch.
