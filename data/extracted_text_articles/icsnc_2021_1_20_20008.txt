Abstract—In this paper, we present a power control technique to 
coexist in-building small cells of the Fifth-Generation (5G) New 
Radio (NR) in the 60 GHz band with the incumbent Access Points 
(APs) of the IEEE 802.11ad/ay standard, also termed as Wireless 
Gigabit (WiGig). Small cells are not Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) 
feature enabled. Moreover, each small cell is equipped with a dual-
transceiver, one operating in the 28 GHz band exclusively while 
the other in the 60 GHz band opportunistically. The proposed 
technique allows each small cell to operate in the 60 GHz band 
only to serve its downlink traffic by switching its transmission 
power either to zero or to a minimum allowable level. The 
minimum power level results in the interference experienced by a 
WiGig AP (WiAP) that does not exceed its prior interference 
threshold level set by the WiGig operator to ensure its fairness 
while coexisting with a small cell. We derive average capacity, 
Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Energy Efficiency (EE) metrics for 
NR small cells. With system-level simulation results, it is shown 
that the proposed technique improves all these above metrics of 
small cells considerably while ensuring a fair coexistence of small 
cells with incumbent WiAPs by limiting the interference at a 
WiAP to the maximum allowable level (i.e., the interference 
threshold level).

I. INTRODUCTION 
The continuing growth in mobile devices and data traffic 
over the past decade causes mobile network operators (MNOs) 
to face tremendous challenges since the availability of the 
mobile spectrum for an MNO has not been increased 
correspondingly. Though several approaches, such as small cell 
deployments have been employed, no significant improvement 
toward addressing the growing demand to serve data traffic has 
been observed. This causes the focus of an MNO to shift from 
serving its data traffic by the allocated licensed spectrum only 
to the unlicensed spectrum bands as well. Globally, a large 
amount of spectrum is available in the unlicensed bands, 
including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 60 GHz. A major feature of the 
unlicensed bands is the ability of a user to get access freely to 
them. However, because of the presence of the incumbent WiFi 
networks in the unlicensed bands, proper co-channel 
interference (CCI) management is necessary to coexist a 
cellular network with a WiFi network in the same unlicensed 
band.  
In this regard, by enabling cellular nodes (e.g., small cells) 
with Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) (Alhulayil and Lopez-Benitez, 
[1]), a fair coexistence of cellular and WiFi nodes can be made 
possible. The LBT is basically similar to the Carrier-Sense 
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). 
Instead of allowing a cellular node to always use a channel, it 
shares between a cellular node and a WiFi Access Point (AP) 
fairly (Zhang et al. [2]) by periodically stopping the cellular 
node to occupy the channel and detecting the activities of other 
shared nodes on the channel. Several studies also showed that 
the LBT is critical for a fair coexistence between a cellular 
network such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and a Wi-Fi 
network (Kwan et al. [3], Chaves et al. [4]).  However, LBT is 
not used in all regions such as the United States of America 
(USA) and China where LBT is not required particularly for 
early commercialization (Lagen et al. [5]). Hence, cellular 
nodes are enabled with LBT, they do not have sensing 
capabilities such as the CSMA/CA protocol of WiFi networks 
to avoid a collision. In this regard, the coexistence of small cells 
can be provided by managing CCI with WiFi networks in time 
and power domains.  
In this direction, numerous studies already addressed the 
coexistence issues between cellular and WiFi networks in the 
time-domain using the Almost Blank Subframe (ABS) based 
Enhanced 
Intercell 
Interference 
Coordination 
(eICIC) 
technique in LTE.  For example, by employing ABSs, Almeida 
et al. [6] proposed a scheme to coexist LTE with WiFi in an 
unlicensed band.  Likewise, Nihtilä et al. [7] proposed the LTE 
muting mechanism to allow access to the channel to WiFi users 
and Zhang et al. [8] presented an ABS-based coexistence 
scheme to avoid co-channel interference between small cells 
and WiFi systems.   
With regard to providing the coexistence between cellular 
and WiFi networks in the power-domain, Huang et al. [9] 
discussed the coexistence of LTE/WiFi in the power domain 
such that by adjusting the output power of LTE nodes, the 
transmission opportunity of WiFi nodes can be changed. Sagari 
et al. [10] proposed Wi-Fi and LTE coordination algorithms 
based on optimization in the power and frequency domain. 
Further, Chaves et al. in [4] proposed to use the uplink power 
control to improve the performance of coexistence of LTE with 
WiFi by introducing an additional factor to the conventional 
uplink power control mechanism of LTE.  Besides, Hang et al. 
[11] proposed a Power Control-based Spatial Reuse scheme 
to increase the probability of simultaneous transmissions of 
Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) and WiFi. Moreover, in 
[12], Xia et al. studied the use of transmit power control, as well 
as clear channel assessment, mechanisms in unlicensed LTE 
systems by considering that all stations use the same fixed 
transmit power. 
However, different from these above contributions in 
power-domain, in this paper, we present a simple, yet effective, 
transmit power control technique for in-building small cells of

Fifth-Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) to coexist with the 
incumbent WiFi Access Points (WiAPs) of the Wireless 
Gigabit (WiGig) in the 60 GHz band. In doing so, we first 
present the system architecture and the coexistence mechanism 
in Section II, followed by the mathematical analysis to derive 
average capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Energy 
Efficiency (EE) metrics for NR small cells in Section III. We 
evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in Section 
IV and conclude the paper in Section V.    
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND PROPOSED COEXISTENCE 
MECHANISM 
Consider a set of small cells and WiAPs such that one from 
each set is deployed per apartment of any multistory building 
located within the coverage of a macrocell of a 5G NR operator. 
A set of picocells are also located within the macrocell coverage 
to offload some macrocell traffic. Each small cell or WiAP 
serves one User Equipment (UE) at a time. For clarity, we 
consider only one apartment to show the coexistence of a small 
cell and a WiAP as shown in Figure 1(a). From Figure 1(a), it 
can be found that each small cell is equipped with two 
transceivers, one operates in the 28 GHz band and the other in 
the 60 GHz band.  
Since the 28 GHz band is a licensed band for an MNO, the 
transceiver operating at the 28 GHz band can serve both the 
uplink and downlink traffic at all time. However, since WiAPs 
operate in the 60 GHz band by default, and small cells are not 
Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) enabled, it can be possible that all 
WiAPs are blocked by the small cells due to having relatively a 
higher interference margin of a small cell than that of a WiAP. 
Hence, to overcome this problem, we propose the following 
power control technique to coexist small cells with WiAPs as 
shown in Figure 2(b).  
Small cells of any 5G NR can get access to the 60 GHz band 
either when no UEs of any WiGig network are present within 
an apartment of a multistory building or when small cells of any 
5G NR can operate in the 60 GHz band at a reduced 
transmission power causing less interference than that of the 
interference threshold set by the corresponding WiGig network, 
as shown in Figure 1(b).  
The presence of a UE of a small cell can be sensed by the 
WiAP by detecting and measuring the 60 GHz channel energy, 
whereas the transmission of a WiAP can be identified either by 
the small cell using its transceiver operating at the 28 GHz or 
by the UE of the small cell in the uplink at the 28 GHz band. 
Note that the WiAP stops the transmission due to its inherent 
CSMA/CA protocol to avoid collision with the small cell. An 
example of opportunistic subframe allocation to small cells to 
coexist with WiAPs in the 60 GHz spectrum band by employing 
the proposed power control technique is shown in Figure 1(c) 
and is described in the following.  
A subframe in the 60 GHz is allocated to either a small cell 
or a WiAP depend on the presence of their UEs at any time, as 
well as the level of interference experienced by the UE of the 
WiAP as compared to that of its threshold interference. More 
specifically, given that a UE of the small cell is present in an 
apartment, a subframe is allocated to a small cell only under the 
following conditions: 
 
when no UEs of the WiAP is present. 
 
when a UE of the WiAP is present, and the interference 
experienced by the WiAP UE is above the threshold 
interference.

However, if the interference experienced by the UE of the 
WiAP is below the threshold interference in a subframe, no 
collision can be detected by the CSMA/CA protocol of the 
WiAP, and hence, the corresponding subframe is allocated to 
the WiAP.   
III. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Let SM, SP, and SF denote, respectively, the number of 
macrocells of a 5G NR MNO, the number of picocells per 
macrocell, and the number of small cells in a building.  Let 
2G
M
, 
M28G
, and 
M60G
 denote, respectively, the number of 
Resource Blocks (RBs) of 2 GHz, 28 GHz, and 60 GHz spectra 
where an RB is equal to 180 kHz. Also, let T denote the 
simulation run time with the maximum time of Q (in time step 
each lasting 1 ms) such that T= {1, 2, 3,…,Q}. Following [13], 
the arrival process of UEs of a 5G NR small cells and WiGig 
operators can be assumed to follow the Poisson processes with 
a mean 
NR
and 
WiG
, respectively, over a certain observation 
time T. Hence, the amount of time in terms of the number of 
Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs) that 5G NR small cells and 
WiAPs in a building serve their corresponding UEs in Q can be 
expressed, respectively, as follows.

       Due to small coverage, low transmission power, and high

due to the variation in the interference threshold 
th
I60G,WiG
at a 
WiAP. As the interference threshold requirement increases, i.e. 
the value of
th
I60G,WiG
decreases, both SE and EE performances of 
small cells of 5G NR improve nonlinearly. This is because, with 
an increase in 
th
I60G,WiG
, small cells can increase the transmission 
power in the 60 GHz band, resulting in improving the capacity 
logarithmically following (4). This, however, causes a 
corresponding reduction in the capacity, and hence the SE and 
EE performances of WiAPs. Moreover, using (7), an increase 
in the transmission time TNR of small cells increases the overall 
capacity, and hence the SE and EE of small cells. In summary, 
TNR and 
th
I60G,WiG
play considerable role in trading-off the 
coexistence performances, in terms of the average capacity, SE, 
and EE, of both small cells of a 5G NR network and WiAPs of 
a WiGig network.

      With regards to the other existing techniques, the proposed 
technique benefits from the fact that it does not impact the air 
interface protocol of cellular systems, as well as can meet the 
global regulations. Moreover, this technique is typically used 
together with other coexistence techniques. However, it is less 
fair to resource allocations than other techniques and is 
typically interference measurement based [17].  
V. CONCLUSION 
      In this paper, we have presented a transmission power 
control technique for LBT-free 5G NR small cells to coexist 
with WiAPs in the 60 GHz band within a building. With 
system-level simulation results, it has been shown that the 
proposed technique can improve the average capacity, SE, and 
EE of small cells of a 5G NR while ensuring fair coexistence 
with WiAPs by maintaining a maximum interference level at a 
WiAP limited to its interference threshold. More specifically, 
an increase in the interference threshold of WiAPs results in a 
nonlinear increase in the SE and EE of small cells while 
decreasing the SE and EE of WiAPs. However, an increase in 
the transmission time of either small cells or WiAPs causes a 
corresponding linear increase in the SE and EE. Hence, the 
transmission time and the interference threshold of WiAPs play 
noticeable roles in trading-off the coexistence performances of 
small cells of a 5G NR and WiAPs of a WiGig.
