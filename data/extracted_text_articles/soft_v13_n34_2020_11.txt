Abstract—This paper presents the long-term research results
on context creation and georeferencing, deploying advanced
knowledge based mining, enabled by conceptual knowledge
frameworks. The goal of this fundamental research is to
systematically develop advanced information science tools and
knowledge-based methods, gaining new insights for complex
archaeological, prehistorical, and geoscientiﬁc contexts. The vast
resources and data collections are otherwise not practically
available to archaeologists and geoscientists. The paper presents
the methodological base of an innovative algorithm framework
of
conceptual
knowledge
pattern
matching,
allowing
the
consideration
of
complementary
and
descriptive
knowledge
of meaning and intrinsic object properties. The research is
illustrated by practical implementations of knowledge pattern
matching, including processing and developing multi-disciplinary
and multi-lingual knowledge object entities and resources. This
specialised research concentrates on geoscientiﬁc context and
georeferencing. The demonstration of a previously unpublished
practical
information

case
study
from
classical
archaeology,
prehistory,
and
geosciences
shows
automated

INTRODUCTION
Advanced creation of context and georeferencing from
multi-disciplinary archaeological, prehistorical, and geoscien-
tiﬁc object entities is a most challenging task. So far, there is
no consistent, practical concept available relieving the funda-
mental deﬁcits of respective resources, especially motivating
new fundamental ways of concepts’ integration.
This extended research is based on the creation of advanced
knowledge resources and implementation of the Conceptual
Knowledge Pattern Matching (CKPM), which was presented
at the GEOProcessing 2020 conference in Valencia, Spain [1].
This paper presents developments, which are complemen-
tary to conceptual knowledge deployed in knowledge resources
and processing method used so far. The new developments
closely integrate with features enabled by knowledge-centric
development of resources and objects. The presented cases
focus on basic phonetic associations and topographic and
cartographic context creation and visualisation, starting with
advanced knowledge mining.
Knowledge Mining is supported by a number of common
methods and algorithms, e.g., string pattern matching algo-
rithms, associative, comparative, and phonetic algorithms. All
these achievements deal with distinct extrinsic properties of
respective entities in very limited ways.
The motivation for creating the CKPM was the lack of
suitable facilities for an advanced matching of ‘meaning’ when
implementing mining solutions in context of complex multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual Knowledge Resources. Espe-
cially, conceptual knowledge can relate to any of factual, con-
ceptual, and procedural knowledge. To a comparable extent,
metacognitive knowledge can also relate to any of factual,
conceptual, and procedural knowledge but the formalisation
of conceptual knowledge is different in a way that universal
implementations can be deployed in ﬂexible and still consistent
ways. A practical approach for knowledge pattern matching is
the fundament for this research. Its methodological fundaments
and the practical integration with the development of univer-
sal knowledge resources will be presented in the following
sections, targetting on the practical creation of object entities’
context and georeferencing.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
provides the background of knowledge complements and for-
malisation of meaning. Section III introduces the previous
work and components. Sections IV presents methodology,
method, and implementation. Sections V, VI, and VII present
the implementation, matching process, and resulting tables.
Section VIII provides an implementation of module integration
for the result of context creation and georeferencing. Sec-
tions IX and X discuss the main achievements and summarise
conclusions and future work.
II.
FROM MEANING AND STRUCTURES TO KNOWLEDGE
COMPLEMENTS
Knowledge, meaning, and patterns form relations, which
may require some introduction.
The concept of meaning differs from the concept of signiﬁ-
cation. Semantic and syntactic structures do not sufﬁce to de-
termine the discursive meaning of an expression [2]. Discourse
means a way of speaking. On the one hand, grammatically
correct phrases may lack discursive meaning. On the other
hand, grammatically incorrect sentences may be discursively
meaningful.
Such formalised approaches require a solid understanding
of interpretation [3] and application of methods. Fundamen-
tal approaches, especially, the semiotic triangle of symbol,
thought/Reference, and referent [4] are fundamental for un-
derstanding principles.
Knowledge and meaning are closely tied with intrinsic and
extrinsic properties. Therefore, understanding of intrinsic and
extrinsic properties of entities is signiﬁcant for any context.

This is nevertheless true for any case of natural language, esp.
considering langage, langue, and parole [5].
Creating practical approaches requires algorithms. An algo-
rithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in problem-
solving operations. In general, algorithms cannot, by their
fundamental nature, handle intrinsic and extrinsic properties
to the same quality and extent. For example, an intrinsic
property of a word object is the meaning in mind, the ‘lemma’.
An extrinsic property of a word object can be a written
word. Extrinsic properties do not reﬂect meaning and insight
as their representations do not generally allow reasonable
results. Best practice provides us with solid, complementary
knowledge concepts and methodologies allowing to create
advanced methods.
Data do not have or carry meaning. Therefore, understanding
meaning is of major signiﬁcance in information science when
dealing with improving formalisation processes and creating
‘logos based’ analogies along with cognitive processes. Com-
monly, cognition (cognitio, from Latin cognoscere, “get to
know”) is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge
and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses
(Source: Oxford dictionary). Analogy (from Greek analogia,
`αναλoγ´ια, “proportion”) is a cognitive process of transferring
information or ‘meaning’ from a particular subject, the ana-
logue or source, to another, the target.
Nevertheless, aspects of meaning can be described using
knowledge complements, e.g., considering factual, conceptual,
procedural, and metacognitive knowledge [6]. Especially, con-
ceptual knowledge can relate to any of factual, conceptual, and
procedural knowledge. To a comparable extent, metacognitive
knowledge can relate to any of factual, conceptual, and proce-
dural knowledge. A practical approach for knowledge pattern
matching will be presented in the following sections.

PREVIOUS WORK, COMPONENTS, AND RESOURCES
The fundaments of terminology and understanding knowl-
edge are layed out by Aristotle being an essential part of
‘Ethics’ [7]. Information sciences can very much beneﬁt from
Aristotle’s fundaments and a knowledge-centric approach [6]
but for building holistic and sustainable solutions, supporting
a modern deﬁnition of knowledge [8], they need to go beyond
the available technology-based approaches and hypothesis [9]
as analysed in Platon’s Phaidon.
Making a distinction and creating interfaces between meth-
ods and the implementation applications, the results of this
research are illustrated here along with the practical example
of the Knowledge Mapping methodology [10] enabling the
creation of new object and entity context environments, e.g.,
implementing methods for knowledge mining context.
The means to achieve such recommendations even for
complex scenarios is to use the principles of Superordinate
Knowledge, integrating arbitrary knowledge. The core assem-
bly elements of Superordinate Knowledge [11] are:
•
Methodology.
•
Implementation.
•
Realisation.
Separation and integration of assemblies have proven beneﬁcial
for building solutions with different disciplines and different
levels of expertise. Comprehensive focussed subsets of con-
ceptual knowledge can also provide excellent modular and
standardised complements for information systems component
implementations, e.g., for environmental information manage-
ment and computation [12].
For the implementation of case studies, the modules are built
by support of a number of major components and resources,
which can be used for a wide range of applications, e.g.,
creation of resources and extraction of entities. The Universal
Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) [13] is the world’s foremost
document indexing language in the form of a multi-lingual
classiﬁcation scheme covering all ﬁelds of knowledge and
constitutes a sophisticated indexing and retrieval tool. The
UDC is designed for subject description and indexing of
content of information resources irrespective of the carrier,
form, format, and language. UDC is an analytico-synthetic and
facetted classiﬁcation. It uses a knowledge presentation based
on disciplines, with synthetic features. UDC schedules are
organised as a coherent system of knowledge with associative
relationships and references between concepts and related
ﬁelds. The UDC allows an efﬁcient and effective processing of
knowledge data and provides facilities to obtain a universal and
systematical view on classiﬁed objects. UDC-based references
in this publication are taken from the multi-lingual UDC
summary [13] released by the UDC Consortium [14] under
a Creative Commons license [15]. Facets can be created
with any auxiliary tables, e.g., auxiliaries of place and space,
time, language, and form as well as general characteristics,
e.g., properties, materials, relations, processes, and operations,
persons and personal characteristics. Module examples are
employing Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) [16]
syntax for specifying common string patterns and Perl [17] for
component wrapping purposes with this information science
case study in archaeology, prehistory, and geosciences.
In addition, context data, visualisation modules, and pho-
netic modules were developed and integrated for beneﬁt of
this research. The used components will be referred to in the
respective following sections.

METHODOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATION
The
implementation
strictly
follows
the
fundamental
methodological algorithm base.
A. Methodological algorithm base
The Conceptual Knowledge Pattern Matching (CKPM)
methodology targets providing and accessing knowledge object
patterns. This methodological algorithm framework is based
on the Superordinate Knowledge Methodology, which allows
systematical use and thorough processing by the steps:
1)
Selecting knowledge objects.
2)
Accessing knowledge object patterns.
3)
Thorough processing of object entities and references.
4)
Object entity analysis, knowledge complements’ based.
5)
Result formation.
The respective accessing includes the organisation and struc-
tures used with the objects and entities. Object patterns need to
be accessible to an extent and quality, which allows a sufﬁcient
processing for the respective scenario. The requirements for
speciﬁc scenarios will therefore be individual. The processing
includes making use of the characteristics and features of the
respective implementations of the knowledge based frame-
works providing a conceptual base for a certain method. The
conceptual knowledge complements referred from knowledge

objects can have their origins from manual as well as from
automated processes. For the implementation and realisation,
the framework providing the base conceptual knowledge ref-
erence patterns is the UDC. The results in this publication use
the UDC Summary Linked Data (Main Tables, [18]). Creating
facets and patterns can also make use of the common auxiliary
signs being part of the UDC framework [19]. The following
advanced employment of conceptual knowledge (UDC) is far
beyond common application of universal classiﬁcation.
B. Implemented method
An implementation of a CKPM based method requires
accessible objects and a suitable conceptual framework base
for processing and automation. The methodic implementation
illustrated here enables to employ an UDC framework appro-
priate for systematical use, implemented by the steps:
1)
Knowledge Resources’ objects.
2)
Accessing formalised conceptual knowledge object pat-
tern description based on UDC, e.g., including geosci-
entiﬁc context and georeferencing.
3)
Processing procedure via pipelines, employing UDC
knowledge and forks.
4)
Entity analysis, based on UDC framework references.
5)
Result formation on base of Knowledge Resources’
objects, retaining conceptual knowledge.
In this case, meaning is described by conceptual patterns,
which can be searched and analysed. Processing algorithms
can follow the given organisation, e.g., the decimal organisa-
tion of the UDC, following available forks as will be illustrated
for the matching process in the following sections. Processing
and analysis includes primary, decimal conceptual knowledge
and associated multi-dimensional knowledge in context of
the object entities. The method allows advanced data-centric
computing procedures. In practice, the facility for consistently
describing knowledge is a valuable quality, esp., conceptual
knowledge, e.g., using the UDC and its editions.
C. Implemented conceptual knowledge framework and target
Targeting practical use for advanced geoscientiﬁc informa-
tion and expert systems, conceptual geoscientiﬁc and geo-
graphic mapping and referencing are required. Geographic
conceptual knowledge pattern entities are created based on
UDC code references [20] of geography, biography, history.

A geoscientiﬁc / archaeology example from the case studies
and implementations for geoscientiﬁc information systems
and application components is used for illustration in the
next sections. The example will show a tiny subset of the
comprehensive, universal conceptual knowledge used.
The above conceptual knowledge contains all the references
for geographic context, which includes the conceptual knowl-
edge regarding geographic data, e.g., geoinformation and geo-
descriptive knowledge. The relevant conceptual knowledge re-
quired for geoscientiﬁc context is provided by references from
natural sciences’ context. Any of the conceptual knowledge
can be used in any stage of a CKPM process, e.g., in start,
intermediate, and target speciﬁcations.
Natural sciences related conceptual knowledge pattern enti-
ties are created based on UDC code references [21] of mathe-
matics and natural sciences. An excerpt of the implementation

VI.
NEW MATCHING PROCESS AND PROCESSING
The new framework of the matching process and processing
includes following the conceptual knowledge forks. Here,
the primary, decimal reference forks of the UDC are used
for implementation, which provide the red line forks within
universal knowledge. Matching is beyond non-conceptual
knowledge, e.g., natural language processing and string pattern
matching. Especially, country and border concepts cannot
be used for speciﬁcation, e.g., ancient and modern border
lines fail to be useful. The process enables places in ancient
Greece and Rome, from archaeological and prehistoric times
associated with places in the ancient and modern world to
be described, e.g., references of the type UDC:..."63"(37)
and
UDC:..."63"(38).
Trigger
question
can
be
‘Can
archaeological artefacts’ objects of a certain context be
associated with earth science objects?’. A symbolic writing
specifying a conceptual expression is shown in Figure 5.

The processing successfully follows the “Earth sciences”
and “Geography” forks. These procedures referencing to a
formalised [24], practical framework of conceptual knowledge
embrace all the relevant universal knowledge, e.g., including
natural sciences and geosciences, archaeology, philosophy, and
history. The results of removing in the domain of knowledge
and removing in the domain of mathematics are not the same.
In principle, abstraction means removing [25]. In the mathe-
matical domain, removing is mostly formalised by subtraction
[26].
In general, any universal conceptual knowledge framework
can be used, which enables a systematical processing and
which is universal and consistent. Nevertheless, UDC has
proven to be by far the most universal, practical, and efﬁcient
choice for multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual context. There-
fore, UDC references are used for this publication, illustration,
and the practical implementations for this research.
Demonstrated meaning patterns can be used plain, e.g.,
on conceptual fundament, or integrating references between
objects containing non-conceptual knowledge, too. The de-
velopment target will certainly depend on intended case sce-
narios and capacities of resources’ and module developers.
This research can only demonstrate some principle, major
features of UDC in context of an implementation done for
the given practical scenario. However, it is always possible to
parametrise conceptual knowledge depth and width of matches
for any case due to the structure of the UDC implementation.

INTEGRATION MODULES FOR RESULT CONTEXT
CREATION AND GEOREFERENCING
Commonly, it is a challenging question how the integration
of multi-disciplinary knowledge object instances and context
can be achieved for further deployment.
A. Phonetic modules and values
The deployed implementation modules support a ‘silken’
selection [31], phonetic modules, which can be speciﬁed and
closely integrated with conceptual context.
The knowledge resources can be used by any algorithm
suitable for a deﬁned workﬂow. One of the available mod-
ule implementing a silken selection based on the Soundex
principle is the knowledge_sndx_standard application. The
historical Soundex [32] is a phonetic algorithm for indexing
names by sound. The goal with this algorithm is to encode ho-
mophones so that they can be represented by the same resulting
code in order to match persons’ name despite differences in
writing and spelling [33]. The basic algorithm mainly encodes
consonants. Vowels are not encoded unless being a ﬁrst letter.
The U.S. Government is using a modiﬁed modern rule set [34]
for purposes in census and archives. The original intention was
to catch the English pronunciation, anyhow there are many
different implementations in use today.
The selection module, modelled after the standard Perl im-
plementation [35], for computing LX Soundex codes [36], can
be adapted for different procedural context and programming
concepts [37], [38]. The various workﬂows can deﬁne and
integrate their own Soundex codes for different purposes and
topics.
A large number of different modules and algorithms were
developed for this research, even including various phonetic
algorithms for respective content and context. Listing 11
shows a fully functional excerpt Perl source code module
(knowledge_sndx_grlat) modelled after the standard Perl
implementation and developed for the respective Greek and
Latin context.

Knowledge Resources (KR) can contain objects and entities
of different organisation and structure, especially, collection
(O) object entities and container (C) object entities. Reference
data, especially UDC codes and phonetic Soundex codes,
can be deployed for complex scenarios, which beneﬁt from
advanced referenced besides knowledge content and context
of object entities and referenced sources.
There are two categories of object entities regarding a geo-
referencing context: Object entities, which cannot be logically
attributed with a georeferencing and those, which have prop-
erties allowing georeferencing attributation. The ﬁrst category
(upper group) in this case is represented by a UDC:902/904
context group, whereas the second category (lower group) is
represented by a UDC:550.3 context group.
The groups are linked by conceptual knowledge as some
entities refer to both special collections and containers (CO).
An additional, signiﬁcant reference link between the group
calculates from the phonetic SNDX:PP413/SNDX:BV320 ref-
erences.
C. Reference to automated context and georeferencing
Those associated object entities of different groups (Ta-
ble VIII), which carry conceptual references and georefer-
encing can be selected by available properties and criteria,
especially conceptual knowledge and phonetic means.
Table IX shows an excerpted result of the phonetic/con-
ceptual knowledge reference tree process, the automatically
associated georeferenced object entities.

Figure 12. Automatically generated knowledge context (red bullet markers) of the conceptual knowledge pattern matching result group (yellow labels) and result
group contexts (green/blue labels) in their topographic context, created based on georeferenced knowledge resources object entities and conceptual knowledge.
Consecutive context can be created by automatically gen-
erated mapping and visualisation modules, e.g., employing
GMT routines, based on these results. Result context of the
UDC:902/904 context group are UDC:550.3 context group
object entities, which secondary context (Figure 12) is repre-
sented by respective geological and plate tectonics knowledge
for the georeferenced area (Aegean Sea region). The new
generated context integrates the various contexts and object
entity representations in a multi-dimensional result. For these
cases the module option is Mercator projection in order to
provide a common base for comparisons of proper attributes
and required ﬂexibility.
Appropriate data was required for the topographic data
related criteria. In the past, the georeferenced objects have
been used with various data, e.g., with the Global Land
One-kilometer Base Elevation Project (GLOBE) [39] and the
2-minute gridded global relief data (ETOPO2v2) [40].
For the required resolution of the results presented here,
the knowledge resources had to be integrated with data
based on the gridded ETOPO1 1 arc-minute global relief
model data [41]. For special purposes data can be composed
from various sources, e.g., adding Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission (SRTM) data [42] from the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) [43].
The horizontal datum of ETOPO1 is World Geodetic System
geographic, which was established in 1984 (WGS84) and later
revised. The WGS84 speciﬁcations and references are provided
by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) [44]
and as EPSG:4326 from the European Petroleum Survey
Group Geodesy (EPSG) [45]. The vertical datum of ETOPO1
is “sea level”. The source elevation data were not converted by
the authors of ETOPO1 to a common vertical datum because
of the large cell size of 1 arc-minute.
The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) [46] suite application
components are used for handling the spatial data, applying
the related criteria, and for the visualisation.

DISCUSSION
The implemented method and the integration modules for
result context creation and georeferencing has been a viable,
efﬁcient, and ﬂexible solution in many case scenarios. Imple-
mentations are far not trivial but any discipline being able to
ask questions as demonstrated should also be able to deploy
the methodology and presented components for creating solid
fundaments and practical solutions for challenging, complex
scenarios, e.g., classiﬁcation and dating of objects [47], geo-
scientiﬁc prospection, surveying [48], and knowledge [49],
chorological and chronological context [50], can contribute to
the fundaments of archeological and prehistorical cognition
[51] and insight [52] regarding realia and abstract objects,
knowledge, and contexts. The presented knowledge-based
method and conceptual knowledge framework allow to address

context very ﬂexibly, e.g., in order to enable the metacognitive
documentation of metacognitive and procedural knowledge of
Geoscientiﬁc Information Systems or Geographic Information
System analysis [53], ﬁltering contextualised artistic represen-
tations [54] and managing object collections [55]. Knowledge-
based approaches can also be beneﬁcial without advanced
knowledge resources, e.g., in cases of realia collections, infor-
mation management and service oriented institutions and re-
search data collection, e.g., The Digital Archaeological Record
[56] of Digital Antiquity [57].
For example, in focus cases of archaeology, prehistory, and
history context and georeferencing can further be supported
by facet creation into more dimensions and also allows the
application of a consistent conceptual base for description
and fuzziness, beyond common auxiliaries and georeferencing.
Spatial references beyond common auxiliaries of place [23]
(Table IV), especially ‘Places of the ancient and mediaeval
world’ (UDC:(3)) and ‘Countries and places of the modern
world’ (UDC:(4/9)) can be created from the following tables
of UDC code references.
Tables X and XI provide example excerpts of relevant main
conceptual knowledge and details of UDC references used for
conceptual mapping. For conceptual knowledge of place and
spatial context the implementations requires to provide refer-
ences to classiﬁcation codes. The UDC provides references
based on the common auxiliaries of place of the UDC [23]
as excerpted here for facets of place and space, physiographic
designation, and places from ancient to modern world.

The references, e.g., classiﬁcation, facets, concordances, and
textual description, are usable in all the procedures and steps
and allow to consider and implement arbitrary ﬂexibility of
fuzziness. Entry points to relevant and associated knowledge
may be in any disciplinary context due to the consistent
framework of the UDC and the multi-disciplinary and multi-
lingual Knowledge Resources.
In our practical research projects and implementations,
deploying a modular integration of consequent knowledge
resources’ components and their development with means of
conceptual knowledge pattern matching has proven to enable
valuable solutions for challenging and complex cases of in
many disciplines.

CONCLUSION
This research achieved to implement the goal of integrating
knowledge resources’ development and universal conceptual
knowledge pattern matching for practical context creation and
georeferencing of archaeological, prehistorical, and geoscien-
tiﬁc object entities. Respective module implementations, com-
ponents developments, and results of automatically generated
and consistent knowledge context and georeferencing were
shown.
The information science integration case study demonstrated
the practical components and their coherence for creating
context and generating context results, e.g., visualisation, car-
tographic and topographic context including advanced solu-
tions of object entity selection for georeferencing. It must be
emphasised that this research targets an information science
case study for multi-disciplinary resources and context, and
cannot be limited to plain principles of case studies of technical
or engineering aspects.
The implementations successfully employ the method of
knowledge pattern matching based on the CKPM methodology.
Further, the knowledge based mining implementation success-
fully employs the UDC references in order to provide the
required conceptual framework. The UDC references proved
to provide an excellent core component, for universal, multi-
disciplinary, and multi-lingual knowledge.
In this new context, UDC showed to have a perfect organ-
isational structure of conceptual knowledge for practical, sys-
tematical use as well as for an efﬁcient and ﬂexible processing
support, following respective knowledge forks for references
while creating and keeping developing resources and concep-
tional knowledge consistent supported by its editions.
The rewarding beneﬁts of the methodology allow disci-
plines, e.g., archaeologists, to work with complex and multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual knowledge references in a con-
sistent way, which can by far no longer be dealt with man-
ually or even with anachronistic practices. The knowledge-
based methodology enables addressing arbitrary knowledge
and facets and to create new and individual methods for dealing
with complements, based on common knowledge resources.
The
general
framework
includes
targetting
previously
unidentiﬁed references to knowledge resulting from the refer-
enced complements. The methodology provides a wide range
of facilities for individual methods to deal with application
scenarios, multi-dimensional object references, fuzziness and
arbitrary ﬁne granularity of knowledge and references and even
references from external notations.

However, each of the deployed implementation components,
e.g., classiﬁcation, phonetic algorithms, and topographic con-
text data, and GMT mapping, may require intensive study and
even years of experience. The integration may even require
additional levels of understanding and experience. Therefore,
to signiﬁcant extent, the will and seriousness to invest in
and work with information science methods is an unavoidable
precondition for any discipline to create successful solutions
for millions of references and objects based on the presented
methods.
In daily practice, the integration based on the new method
provides excellent and sustainable conceptual documentation
and enables to create associations and links between knowl-
edge object entities, which cannot result with comparable
consistency otherwise. Further, conﬁguring knowledge ranges
can be achieved in many ways, e.g., by limiting resources, con-
ﬁguring the pattern depths and widths, ranking and selection.
Future research on theory and practice will continue devel-
oping practical conceptual knowledge frameworks, especially
for prehistory and archaeology and natural sciences context,
suitable knowledge resources, knowledge patterns, and further
means of integration modules and components.
