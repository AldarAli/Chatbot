Abstract—This paper extends recent work studying the de-
velopment of human expertise in the game of Go. Although it
appears like a simple game on the surface, Go is actually the
most difﬁcult of all established games for artiﬁcial intelligence,
with no computer program yet reaching the top international
level on a full 19×19 board. On smaller boards with sizes like
9×9, computers are competitive, implying that the understanding
of complex global interactions is the key to human superiority.
The temporal analysis of game positions yields some interesting
insights in into local/global analysis. By mining thousands of
positions from online games, we show that at some player levels,
the sequence of plays leading up to a local position is a stronger
determinant of the next move than the position alone. This
suggests that the sequence of plays is an indicator of global
strategic factors and thus provides a context for the next move
in addition to the local position. Using perceptual templates
introduced in other work, we demonstrate that this global context
appears at the very earliest stages of cognition.

I. INTRODUCTION
The big picture often inﬂuences or overrides local factors
in many areas of human expertise, from board games to
politics. Challenging games, such as Chess and Go, provide an
excellent framework for studying expertise [1][2][3][4], since
they are both strategically deep but tightly constrained. This
paper presents a striking demonstration of this, using data
mined from thousands of decisions in online games. In recent
work, we have demonstrated transitions in the acquisition of
expertise in the game of Go [5]. This game is interesting
because it is currently the most difﬁcult of all established
games for computational intelligence. This contrasts with
Chess, where the IBM computer Deep blue [6][7] was able
to defeat world champion Garry Kasparov.
We also demonstrated therein, from calculation of mutual
information (eqn. 5) between moves, that one of these has
the character of a phase transition [8]. The idea of a phase
transition comes originally from physics, from the study of
phenomena like the melting of ice to give water. When
such a physical phase transition occurs, there is a dramatic
reorganisation of the system. In this case, water molecules
which were ﬁxed rigidly in place in ice become free to move
around, and perhaps travel long distances. During a phase
transition, systems exhibit long-range order, where there are
correlations in activity or structure over large distances and
system parameters often exhibit power-law behaviour, or fat-
tailed distributions. Another example of a phase transition is
in adding edges to random graphs. At a certain point each
graph shows a transition: the average path length (the number
of steps from one node to another) rises to a peak, and then
drops back down again.
A dynamical system example is the Vicsek model developed
for studying magnetic transitions in solid-state physics [9]. In
this model particles travel around a two dimensional grid, and
when they come within some speciﬁed distance of each other,
their directions of movement partially align. Phase transitions
occur in this system as particles ﬂow around in groups, like
ﬂocks of birds, but dynamically—continually forming and
dissolving.
Mutual information is a precisely deﬁned quantity, origi-
nating from Shannon’s mathematical theory of communica-
tion [10]. It is a system property which measures the extent
to which the structure or behaviour of one part of a system
predicts the behaviour of another. In the Vicsek model above,
the direction and velocity of one particle provides some
information about the direction of all the other particles. The
mutual information peaks during the phase transition [9][11]
and, along with other characteristics like long-range order and
power-law behaviour, is thought to be a general property of
phase transitions.
Previous work [8] has already demonstrated phase transi-
tions in collective human decisions in Go. In this paper, we
found a peak in mutual information as a function of rank
amongst Go players, from 1 Dan Amateur through to the very
top players, 9 Dan Professionals [8]. We also present evidence
that there is global inﬂuence on local decisions, and that the
inﬂuence is greatest during the phase transition. The evidence

for the global factors arises from temporal analysis: the next
move is more predictable given the sequence which led up to
it, compared with just using the position at which it is made.
We argue below that this arises from the global information
inferred from the sequence.
Section II describes the conceptual background or expertise
(sections II-B and III-B discuss perceptual templates, which
form one of the earliest stages of processing of a Go board.
It turns out that for professional players, these templates
have a strong non-local character, supporting the ﬁndings
from mutual information.) Sections III and IV describe the
methods and results respectively. The discussion (section V)
and conclusions (section VI) round off the paper.
II. EXPERTISE AND PERCEPTION
The study of expertise in games owes much to Fernand
Gobet and his colleagues, summarised in his book Moves in
Mind [1]. However, the methods used in Go in this paper
rely on a new methodology introduced in [12]. The next two
sections discuss these in turn.
A. State of the Art in Game Expertise
Much of the work on human expertise has been based on
games, especially Chess, as in Gobet’s extensive work [1][13].
One of the key ideas, essentially from Nobel Laureate Herbert
Simon, is that human expertise involves building a huge library
of patterns [14][15]. The application of these ideas in artiﬁcial
intelligence for games is relatively new however [16].
These patterns build up through the formation of chunks,
psychological observables like the memory of Chess positions,
well predicted by models like CHREST [3]. The way the
cognitive structures in the brain might change as expertise
develops, and in particular the appearance of phase transitions,
is a relatively new idea introduced by Harr´e and Bosso-
maier [8][5].
Further recent advances have been limited, particularly in
Go, where a combination of the gamespace complexity [17]
and a lack of genuinely human-like heuristics like an evalua-
tion function make progress difﬁcult. However with the devel-
opment of ever more effective random sampling techniques,
such as the UCT-Monte Carlo approach currently favoured
by AI system developers [18], some progress has been made
in achieving strong amateur play. However, these techniques
do not address the inherent complexity of the game nor the
techniques that humans have developed in order to address
this, almost completely because it is difﬁcult to investigate.
Of relevance to game players is the current state of the
game, the likely future states of the game and in what order
those future moves will be played. The current state of the
game is very well approximated by the pieces currently on
the board (this excludes some technical rules about repeated
positions that are only rarely relevant), and these can be
divided up loosely into tactical, strategic and distracting pieces.
Tactical pieces are involved in local battles for territory, while
strategic pieces play a role in long-term plans spanning the
entire board. Distractors play only weak roles in either of the
preceding plan types. Of course, a single stone can participate
in both local and global strategies. In terms of future states
of the game, we considered only local patterns and what was
played in the local area – a purely tactical aspect of the game.
This leaves only the strategic relationships as a source of
information that might perturb the actual moves made. It is
this external inﬂuence on tactical plays that is implicit in the
global contextual analysis of this paper.
We argue that the sources of information players use in
order to make good decisions are of two types: local and
global. Every level of player in our study has learned a great
deal about the game of Go over the course of their lives; we
now want to make explicit and quantify this information. We
do this by looking at the probability distributions of moves
made in a variety of different positions. The relevance of the
division of the problem space into these two parts can be seen
in the work of Stern et al. [19]. They were able to produce
‘best-in-class’ move prediction for professional players in Go,
achieving a 34% success rate. This was achieved by training
their system on 181,000 expert game records and using a
Bayesian framework for matching moves to positions.
The level of success achieved in this work highlights one
of the principal difﬁculties of good performance in complex
tasks: exact pattern matching is not enough. AI systems need to
be able to model how non-local aspects – i.e., information that
cannot be derived by exactly matching board conﬁgurations –
inﬂuence decisions. Loosely interpreted, this is what is called
inﬂuence in Go and had not been reported in the research
literature before our recent work.
B. Kohonen Maps & Perceptual Templates
If local decisions involve global factors, the question arises
as to where in the cognitive hierarchy global information
appears. We use the recent work on perceptual templates
to show that it starts at the very lowest levels. Perceptual
templates are the building blocks of perception, experienced
preattentively and fundamental to rapid decision making – the
instant appraisal of situations by experts, the guiding of eye
movements and expert memory for real-world positions.
A novel way to determine such perceptual templates in-
volves the use of Kohonen maps trained on game data [12].
The templates so found can then be analysed for global prop-
erties. Teuvo Kohonen [20] introduced self-organising maps
(SOMs) as a model of human visual information processing.
Although they help explain some structural characteristics of
the visual cortex, they have found considerable practical use
in the signal-processing domain, especially image processing.
A SOM is a competitive learning process, comprising of
a selectable number of neurons. Each neuron has a random
weight vector, and a set of inputs of the same dimension. In the
case of an image, the inputs would be the colour components
of each pixel.
Training proceeds as follows. A pattern from the training
set is presented to each neuron in the map. There will be one
neuron which is closer (different metrics of proximity may
be used) to the pattern than any of the others. The weights of

the position in which the move was made. If we now average
over all positions, we get the entropy of moves given positions.
This is the conditional entropy, deﬁned in eqn. 4.
For each possible move on the Go board mi, three proba-
bility distributions were computed:
1) the probability of the move occurring, P(mi)
2) the conditional probability, P(mi|qi), of the move, mi
occurring from a given position, qi
3) the conditional probability, P(mi|si) of the move oc-
curring from a given position, reached by a particular
order of moves, si.
From these results, the entropy and mutual information
(eqn. 5) were calculated, but this paper addresses ﬁndings from
the entropies alone. A discussion of the primary results from
mutual information is given in [8].
The move entropy, H(M), is taken over all moves which
can arise at each level in the game tree (i.e., for the six moves
in the sequence):
H(M) = −
X
i
P(mi) log2[P(mi)]
(3)
For the ﬁrst move in the region there are 49 possible
positions, decreasing to 44 after ﬁve moves, giving a maximal
entropy of log2 44 = 5.5 bits, which would occur if all
moves were equally likely. But since the moves are chosen
strategically, they are far from random, so the measured
entropies are much lower than this.
The conditional entropy, C(M|Q), is the move entropy
calculated from the moves which can arise in a given context,
such as position qj, or sequence of moves sj leading to a
position:
C(M|Q) = −
X
i
X
j
P(mi|qj) log2[P(mi|qj)]
(4)
From the conditional entropies, we can calculate the mutual
information, I(Q, M) using Shannon’s formula [10], eqn. 5:
I(Q, M) = H(M) − C(M|Q)
(5)
The same expressions are used for an ordered sequence of
moves, replacing qj with sj. These entropic quantities are now
calculated across all ranks, from 2 Kyu Amateur (am2kyu),
through the amateur ranks to am6d, onto the highest rank of 9
Dan Professional (pr9d). The results are shown in Figs. 1–3.
B. Perceptual Templates
For our work, we use a separate 50x50 SOM (2500 neurons)
for each of the 361 intersections of the Go board. Each SOM
is trained on board states directly preceding a move at that
point, mined from the online gameplay database. Board states
are represented as linearized length-361 vectors with values
equal to −1, 0 or 1, representing black stone, empty or white
stone respectively. Games were normalized to always start with
a white stone, and no deduplication along axes of symmetry

was carried out. The weight vectors of the neurons was also
constrained to this range, facilitating easy template extraction.
Further details may be found in [12], from which trained
SOMs were reused. The ones used for this paper are taken
from games 5 Dan Professional and above. 18,000 games were
used in training each map.
The spatial topology of a trained SOM is usually of signiﬁ-
cance in typical uses, however we discard this information. We
consider the weight vectors of each neuron at every point as
potential perceptual templates. Neurons which have strongly
learned patterns of stones across the board will then be
extracted as templates. Thus the number of potential templates
equals the total number of neurons, 361 × 2500 = 902, 500.
However, since there are on average only about 7 training
games per neuron, the learned weights are still quite noisy.
Therefore, actual templates are extracted from the weight
vectors by thresholding the weights to 1, 0, or −1 using
thresholds of k and −k, for values of k of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8
and 0.9. After thresholding, empty and duplicate templates
are removed, leaving useful templates. Table I records the
resulting number of templates at each threshold. Examples of
these templates are shown in Fig. 2, which may be locally
clustered as in subﬁgures a. and b., but are often non-local as
in c. and d. Further procedural details can be found in [12].
IV. RESULTS
Fig. 3 summarises the key ﬁndings of the paper. It shows the
conditional entropy as a function of move in the sequence of
six, averaged across all ranks, both amateur and professional.
Note that the moves are logged as they occur in the game.
They are not necessarily in sequence. In other words, this is
not a game on a small board region but a window on a full
19×19 game. Since the standard of play is professional for
this analysis, extremely weak moves are unlikely to occur and
will not appear in the game records. Error bars are calculated
as in Harr´e et al. [5]. Up to move three, the entropy for both
the ordered and unordered cases are the same. At move three,
they fall dramatically, but the ordered average falls about a
third more.
Fig. 4 shows the entropy at each move from a given position.
For purely random moves, the entropy at each move in the
sequence would be between 5 and 6 bits (Section III). The
entropies observed are of course much lower – usually less
than 2 bits – reﬂecting the structure inherent in the game.

the templates have a distance of 12 or greater, implying that
they include stones in different corners of the board. There
could be a small number of templates occupying one corner
and the centre, but these would need to have distances around
12, where we ﬁnd a minima instead.
Also salient are the twin peaks around 3 and 18, possibly
representing corner clusters and cross-board patterns respec-
tively. As we lower the threshold, the proportion of templates
spanning the board increases until it dominates at 0.5, while
the peak at 3 stones vanishes.
V. DISCUSSION
There are three very interesting features of these results,
which we consider in turn: a) the difference between ordered
and unordered play, b) the way the conditional entropy varies
with rank, and c) how perceptual templates span the entire

board.
That the ordered and unordered play differ, implies that
the position at each move is not the sole determinant of the
opponent response. The much lower conditional entropy after
the ﬁrst three moves for the ordered case strongly suggests that
the sequence of moves has revealed something of the global
context which has in turn fed back into move selection. To see
this, imagine that black is strong in one area of the board and
white in another. Since relationships between localised groups
of stones are of great strategic importance in Go, the locations
of these areas will strongly inﬂuence the order of moves made
in the local area we examine. The ﬁrst three moves implicitly
contain some of this information, which subsequently reduces
the range of options in the next three moves.
The gradual decline in entropy with rank for amateur and
professional reﬂects a gradual reduction in the space or range

of options, which we could conceive of as the elimination of
poor moves in established situations, similar to mastering the
openings in Chess.
Our data and results are explicitly based on an analysis of
the local information, but by implication they also say a great
deal about the global context that inﬂuences these localised
decisions. The ﬁrst three moves in our study have a reason-
ably similar conditional entropy of about 1.4 – 1.6 bits of
information. This is the amount of information that is common
between each successive move within the local region. Such
measures of information are the best estimate of how much
one stochastic variable can tell us about another [10].
The only other source of information available to the players
are the pieces on the board that were not included within
our local region. We exclude the possibility of being able

to read the other opponent. While it is a debated issue as
to the importance of opponent-reading skills in a complete
information game such as Go, we believe that it is relatively
insigniﬁcant. The strategical inﬂuence of the other stones on
the board that were not within the local area of study, is a
much more signiﬁcant factor. The changing inﬂuence that non-
local information has on decisions during a game, is evident in
the signiﬁcant drop-off in the conditional entropy after move
three in Fig. 3, a drop in shared information of nearly an
order of magnitude for the ordered play and about half that
for unordered play. This is consistent with the observation
that, at the time of writing, the best computer Go programs
are close to professional-level on small boards like 7×7,
but rapidly deteriorate on larger boards, as global inﬂuences
become important.
This change in conditional entropy in the corner regions of

the board as the game progresses might be due to the shrinking
size of the move space as the board ﬁlls up. While this might
have some minor inﬂuence on our results, we should also
expect such changes to be almost linear as the number of
available positions only drops by a total of 1/43 per move. It
is also possible, but exceptionally unlikely, that after the third
move, players choose much more randomly – i.e., without
concern for pieces on the board, local or not – than they
did for the ﬁrst three moves. Considering the vast training
literature available to players that readily teaches them the
many different variations of the ﬁrst six moves within a corner,
and how to contextualise these decisions by considering what
stones occupy nearby areas, we consider this to be an unlikely
proposition.
Instead we argue that it is just this external inﬂuence, the
inﬂuence of the stones arrayed on the rest of the board that is
having such a striking inﬂuence on the conditional entropy.
This is perhaps not so surprising when considered in the
light of the state of the game itself, after three moves have
been played in the corner. These ﬁrst moves can be thought
of as establishing the board layout in terms of an ‘opening
book’; highly stylised placement of local stones, where the
local pattern can be thought of as effectively uncoupled from
the rest of the board, or at least equally coupled for these
ﬁrst moves. This coupling then changes signiﬁcantly from the
fourth move onwards, where greater consideration needs to
be afforded to the other pieces on the board. This change in
the focus of gameplay signiﬁcantly reduces the information
coupling between local moves and local stones on the board.
The use of global information is supported by the analysis
of the perceptual templates. A large fraction of templates
cover more than one corner of the board, implying that global
analysis starts at the very earliest perceptual levels. As the
threshold is reduced to 0.5, the number of local templates
actually gets eclipsed by non-local ones. An additional ﬁnding
from our results is that the majority of perceptual templates
contain less than ten stones, regardless of noise threshold and
number of templates. Even at the 0.5 threshold, where most
templates are non-local, the average number of stones remains
small. This median ﬁgure of around 5 – 7 is on the order of
human working memory capacity and similar to the ﬁgures in
Gobet’s CHREST models [1]. This is therefore an important
issue, subject to future research.
The complete disappearance of entropy at the high amateur
ranks is very interesting. It suggests that at this level, play
has become somewhat stereotyped, and a major change in
thinking is needed to advance—which indeed seems to happen
on turning professional. Thus, this loss of entropy is consistent
with the long-range order found in phase transitions by Harr´e
et al. [8]. They observed a peak in mutual information at the
transition to professional play, indicating some sort of major
cognitive reorganisation.
At present, we do not know how to quantify such a
reorganisation, and this remains an exciting open question.
Ongoing work is attempting to apply the CHREST models to
Go [3], and to determine how the phase transitions might be
predicted.
A. Implications for Computer Go
The objective of this study was to determine some character-
istics of human Go expertise. These may subsequently be fed
into the computer Go domain, but that was not our motivation
here. Our analysis is once-off, so the time-complexity of our
computations is irrelevant. The methods as described in this
paper have never been used before, and no prior work has
attempted to identify the inﬂuence of global factors in Go.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
The analysis of large volumes of data has generated pow-
erful new insights into human cognition in the Game of Go,
with potential applicability to other domains. We have shown
129

that low-level perceptual templates of professional players are
non-local, i.e., include features from the whole board. The
paper links this to earlier work on mutual information in
local positions, which we infer to be inﬂuenced by global
factors. The sequence of moves leading to a position was
shown to provide more information about the next move than
the position alone, which could be accounted for by global
contextual information provided by the former.
The big challenge for future work is to determine if these
properties hold in other domains. Poker is the ideal next game
to study: it is the second most difﬁcult established game
for computers to play well, and has the additional features
of incomplete information, stochastic elements and theory of
mind.
In 2012, Zen, one of the top computer Go programs, won
games against 6 Dan Amateur players, and came much closer
to beating professional-level players than any program has
before. But computer Go relies heavily on Monte Carlo Tree
Search, which is nothing like human tactics or strategy. It
remains desirable to try to understand and mimic the way
humans learn and play. A big open question is whether the
future of game playing software, or software in general, will
adopt these strategies. The human brain trades off search speed
and accuracy for robustness and possibly scalability. Human
decisions may sometimes be inferior, but they rarely exhibit
the catastrophic failures resulting from software bugs. The
extent to which the strategies of human expertise and computer
algorithms hybdridise will be one of the really exciting topics
of the next decade.
