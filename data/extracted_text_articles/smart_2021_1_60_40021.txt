Abstract—This 
paper 
summarizes 
the 
capabilities 
and 
application of smart transportation component addressed 
within the scope of Smart City Maturity Assessment Model 
developed in the chaos of Turkish 2020-2023 National Smart 
City Strategy and Action Plan which is the 4th national smart 
city strategy in the world.  There are many smart city maturity 
assessment models which enable cities to be evaluated together. 
In these models, standards and etc., different structures for 
different purposes are given over different concepts with 
different understandings. These found to be insufficient in 
terms of developing a national strategy by associating all smart 
city components under the smart city roof with each other. In 
addition, it has been determined that they do not meet the need 
to take into account the conditions and opportunities specific to 
Turkey. In this context, the need for Turkey-specific smart city 
maturity assessment model considering the current situation 
and future strategies of smart transportation component, 
which is defined in line with the Smart City Maturity 
Assessment Model, is emphasized. As a result, development of 
the Turkey specific maturity assessment model development 
and the Model itself became the backbone in analysis of the 
current situation and establishment of strategic view activities 
of the National Strategy and Action Plan.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
There are many maturity assessment models that enable 
cities to feed each other and evaluate them together by 
comparing the smart city maturity of the cities in a 
systematic 
and 
structured 
way 
with 
a 
common 
understanding. When smart city maturity assessment models 
are examined, generally vertical assessment dimensions 
consisting of smart city components are used in models. As 
transportation services are the most used and needed service 
among city services, digitization in transportation services 
has become more important than other city services. In this 
context, many models such as [UNECE-ITU Smart and 
Sustainable City Indicators [1], Morgenstadt Framework 
Model [2], European Union (EU)-European Mid-Sized Cities 
Smart City Ranking Model [3], European Commission - 
Cultural and Creative City Monitoring Model [4] and ISO 
37120 Sustainable Development of Communities-Indicators 
For City Services and Quality of Life, Smart Transportation, 
Smart Mobility and Logistics Management [5] are among the 
vertical dimensions mentioned in the evaluation of 
transportation services. These are evaluated in detail and 
found out that they have different structures with different 
concepts representing different understandings serving for 
different purposes. Moreover, they are evaluated as 
insufficient in terms associating all smart city components 
under the smart city roof with each other. At last, it has been 
determined that they do not meet the need to take into 
account the conditions and opportunities specific to Turkey. 
With this approach, in Turkey within the scope of the 
2020-2023 National Smart Cities Strategy and Action Plan 
[6] Project, Smart City Maturity Assessment Model [7] has 
been 
developed 
by 
TÜBİTAK 
BİLGEM 
Software 
Technologies Research Institute, which forms a common 
language and systematic structure guaranteeing simultaneous 
smart city maturity development. With the Model, the Smart 
City maturity level is determined by assessing smart city 
capabilities of a city and solutions are proposed for 
improvement of the maturity level. The developed model 
specific-to Turkey, is compatible with the country's current 
policy and takes sources and experience related to 
international examples into account. 
The Smart City Maturity Assessment Model has been 
developed in the structure of displaying the current state of 
the city related to smart city transformation through status 
indicators, assessment of readiness in activity areas in 
division of competence-component-capability, and maturity 
level of efficiency dimensions, and display of the impact of 
smart city studies on the city through impact indicators. 
Smart City Capability is the skills that cities need / will need 
to perform smart city studies for a specific purpose or that 
they can / will acquire through smart city studies. Smart City 
Components are groups of capabilities that serve the same 
value. Smart City Competence is a group of consisting 
components based on sectorial expertise or service areas. 
The Smart Transportation component is among the smart 
city components defined in the model. The existence of 
Smart Transportation applications in the cities, which are 
included in the breakdown of capabilities defined within the 
scope of the Smart Transportation component in the model, 
the state of intelligence creation based on the data and 
expertise obtained with these applications, and the use of this

intelligence in order to predict the improvement of the 
services provided by the use of these applications are 
evaluated. By determining the indicators used in measuring 
the current situation regarding smart transportation and the 
impact created by the smart city studies, the maturity level of 
the smart transportation component and its impact are 
evaluated. 
There are four section in this paper. In first section, the 
case of addressing the smart transportation component to 
smart city maturity assessment models is described, the need 
for smart city maturity assessment model is evaluated, and, 
the structure of the model developed specific-to Turkey to 
meet this need is expressed. Section II describes the smart 
transportation component defined in scopes of 2020-2023 
National Smart City Strategy and Action Plan Project and the 
Maturity Assessment Model work and the component 
capabilities and applications are included in this section. 
Section III provides information related to current state of 
smart transportation component in Turkey through the smart 
city maturity assessment model structure and the policies and 
indicators defined in this direction. In final section, the 
effects of studies to be conducted over the structure defined 
by developed model, on defined smart city policies are 
emphasized. 
II. 
SMART TRANSPORTATION 
The preparation studies of 2020-2023 National Smart 
Cities Strategy and Action Plan, analysis and examinations 
which adopted deductive and inductive approaches, were 
carried out in a way that feed each other and feed from each 
other iteratively and have become an integrated structure 
named Smart City Maturity Assessment Model. In smart city 
current state analysis studies, needs and problems were 
determined by 
 
focus group studies,  
 
strategy and legislation analysis, 
 
local government survey, 
 
examination of standards, framework models, 
sample applications developed both in Turkey and 
other countries.

In this context, policies developed are as follows: 
• 
The need to evaluate the use of the next generation 
efficient and low carbon release vehicles, a next 
generation transportation models and reduced traffic 
and increased user comfort has been determined as a 
policy area. The dissemination of new generation 
environmentally friendly (with alternative power 
system) means of transportation will be ensured. In 
addition 
to 
the 
combined 
use 
of 
different 
transportation modes developed as an alternative to 
classical transportation methods, the widespread use 
of next-generation transportation models addressing 
innovative approaches will be ensured. 
• 
The need for efficient management of traffic based 
on data, optimizing the time spent in traffic, 
facilitating the lives of city residents and providing 
safe travel has been determined as a policy area. In 
this context, there is a need to improve the 
transportation 
infrastructure 
and 
expand 
the 
application / application areas within the scope of 
transport 
infrastructure, 
public 
transport 
management, 
railway 
management, 
payment 
management, parking management and governance 
capabilities. 
• 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
develop 
transportation 
infrastructure and extend applications/application 
areas. 
 
Infrastructure 
that 
supports 
smart 
transportation systems will be deployed.  
• 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
develop 
transportation 
infrastructure and extend applications/application 
areas. 
Activities 
intended 
for 
transportation 
governance will be conducted at the national, 
regional and local level for organization, resource 
management, 
planning 
and 
implementation, 
operational maintenance, monitoring evaluation, 
sustainability, interoperability, service management 
and coordination among stakeholders. 
• 
In smart transportation area, it is needed to provide 
emergency transportation management and provide 
transportation without interruption by vehicle 
priority in case of emergency and disasters.  Within 
the scope of emergency transportation management, 
the widespread use of information systems that 
provide traffic light routing and automatic detection 
of cases will be ensured in order to provide the rapid 
transportation of priority vehicles in traffic as 
required. 
• 
There is a need for talking pedestrian buttons for 
disabled people, unobstructed pedestrian paths, 
unobstructed accessible traffic signalization and the 
use of personalized transportation information 
through 
unobstructed 
accessible 
public 
transportation applications to ensure accessibility in 
transportation. To ensure accessibility in transit, all 
segments on the transportation network will be 
foreseen for smooth and easy use, as well as 
advance notification of transportation options and 
widespread use of applications for disabled people. 
• 
By building a Smart haulage infrastructure, the 
development of the logistics data portal and the 
provision of logistics management are required. 
Data-driven 
logistics 
management 
will 
be 
undertaken, based on needs that embraces the 
generation supply chains that provide forward and 
reverse flows of goods, services and related 
information 
between 
production 
point 
and 
consumption points. 
• 
There is a need to provide inclusive transport 
services that improve the quality of life of city 
residents and ensure safe mobility of drivers, 
pedestrians and passengers.

IV. 
CONCLUSION  
Since the smart city is a complex concept, it is necessary 
to give a structure for the concept. Smart city maturity 
assessment models are used to meet this need.  With this 
approach, Turkey specific maturity assessment model has 
been developed and the model have been used in analysis of 
the current situation and establishment of strategic view 
activities within the scope of the National Strategy and 
Action Plan development. In this context, the current 
situation was determined in a structural, related and 
systematic way through the architecture of the model defined 
and the strategies, namely the target view, were expressed 
over the same structure. Within the scope of the model, the 
smart transportation component, its capabilities and 
applications were determined and the needs definition 
studies and target view determination studies for the smart 
transportation component were shaped through this structure. 
To summarize, for the future the implementation of 
adopted policies will be ensured by measuring the 
development and impact of the smart city studies carried out 
in the city with city-based model implementation. On the 
other hand, new solutions are constantly added to smart 
transportation solutions, and some of them are not preferred 
because they do not create the desired value in practice. 
Therefore, it is necessary to reflect these changes to the 
model continuously, and there is a need to address such a 
large number of city-based solutions in line with the 
priorities defined in the city smart city strategy (possibility, 
condition, need and current smart transportation maturity).
