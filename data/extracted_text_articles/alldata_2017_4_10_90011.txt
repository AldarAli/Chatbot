Abstract—The increasing importance of online channels for re-
tailers and service providers is paralleled by a rising interest in
gaining insights into the customer journey to online purchases.
Most attempts to shed light to this issue are restricted to data
available for only few particular sites. Our research focuses on
mining online shoppers’ website visitation patterns across 472
individual websites. We propose a methodological framework to
uncover latent interests which we assume to underlie observable
online browsing behavior. Using one year of clickstream data for
a random sample of comScore panelists, we show that there is
heterogeneity among shoppers regarding online browsing habits,
combinations of latent interests, and their conversion into online
purchases. Our analysis ﬁnds that a relatively small fraction of
online shoppers realizes 70% of online spending. In addition,
we detect substantial segment-speciﬁc differences of shopping
behavior with respect to 59 product categories.

INTRODUCTION
Although online retail sales have grown at substantially
high rates in recent years and the internet continues to
play an increasingly important role in information acquisition
throughout the purchase funnel prior to sales [11][4] sales
conversions remain at very low rates [18][23]. Consequently,
online retailers aim at engaging their visitors in staying longer
on their websites and exploring more pages or, in other words,
to create ”stickiness”, which has been shown to be associated
with higher proﬁtability [5][23]. However, most of the research
focuses on the browsing and purchase behavior within a given
retailer’s website. In this research, we expand this view by
investigating the browsing behavior of online shoppers across
different websites and link this behavior with their purchases
in several product categories.
We

nine
studies
analyzing
browsing
behav-
ior
of
individual
online
shoppers
across
multiple
web
sites in the marketing and management science literatures
[16][13][14][20][6][8][7][17][22]. Seven of these studies do
not look at browsing at individual website, but aggregate
websites to site types (e.g., travel, book, or music sites).
Let us summarize the novel aspects of our study against
to the previous literature. We do not introduce ﬁxed site
types, but characterize individual sites as mixtures of latent
interests which are based on site visits. Our approach differs
from Trusov et al., who also use a topic model, but look
at the number of times a consumer visits 29 ﬁxed website
types (e.g., services, social media, entertainment) [22]. In
other words, these authors aggregate visits to the level of
site types before analyzing them. As we avoid aggregation to
ﬁxed site types the latent interests, which we obtain, should be
better in line with the perspective of consumers. We allow for
correlations between all sites which most previous studies have
excluded. We consider 59 product categories. The maximum
number of categories in previous studies amounts to 29. In
contrast to the majority of previous studies, we consider
purchase as an additional dependent variable. We compare
yearly purchase frequencies between 59 product categories
in different segments of online shoppers. These segments
are determined by clustering the importances of topics for
each individual panelist. Note that only one previous study
considers purchases differentiating between (three) different
product categories. Finally, by analyzing a total number of 472
unique sites our research provides a much more comprehensive
picture of website visitation behavior across multiple sites than
the overwhelming majority of previous studies.
In Section II we present the methodological framework,
which we adopt to derive latent interests embedded in on-
line shoppers’ website visitation patterns. We employ Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a commonly used technique in text
mining to identify latent topics in large texts, which already
has also seen promising applications in marketing. In Section
III we explain how we obtain the analyzed data by selecting
websites and online users participating in the comScore Web
Behavior Panel for 2009. In Section IV we present the results
of applying LDA to these data. We also segment online users
based on their combinations of latent interests and study how
different types of online browsing behavior get converted into
purchases in a variety of product categories. In Section V
we summarize results and outline possible extensions of our
approach.
II.
LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION
In text mining, topic models are often used quite success-
fully to extract mixtures of topics represented in documents
[3][2]. In the following, we deﬁne a visit as a list containing all
the sites accessed by an individual online shopper in a calendar
week. Such a list contains multiple entries for any site, which
a shopper accesses several times during a calendar week. We
apply LDA, the most widespread topic model, to our data and
interpret topics as latent interests. LDA implies the assumption
that the sites visited by a shopper are generated by a mixture
of latent interests. Let I, J and T denote the number of visits,
sites and latent interests, respectively. Probabilities φjt and θti

indicate the importance of site j for latent interest t and the
importance of latent interest t for visit i, respectively. Please
note that the Dirichlet distribution with hyperparameters α and
β serves as prior for these probabilities.
Finally, the probability pij that visit i contains site j is
related to the importance of this site for latent interests and
the importance of latent interests for this visit in the following
manner [9]:

We see several advantages of LDA in comparison to tra-
ditional cluster analytic methods. LDA simultaneously forms
soft clusters of sites and visits. It explicitly takes the sparseness
of the data into account (as a rule, most sites are not contained
in a visit). LDA also considers multiple accesses of the same
site during a visit. LDA does not rely on distance measures.
It is based individual visits and does not loose information by
aggregating across visits.
III.
DATA
We analyze clickstream data from the comScore Web
Behavior Panel, which were collected from January 1, 2009
to December 31, 2009. Because our research emphasizes
purchase behavior, we only include web sites at which at least
one purchase is made in one of the 59 categories during the
entire observation period. Furthermore, as mentioned before,
we use the calender week as time frame. The resulting visits
of panelists comprise a large variety of websites with highly
skewed frequencies. Following common data preprocessing
practice in text mining, each site whose number of visits is
lower than the 5 percentile or greater than the 95 percentile
is removed. Aggarwal and Zhai recommend to remove very
frequent sites (words), as they are not discriminative between
latent interests (topics) [1]. Many empirical studies in text
mining adhere to this recommendation [10][24]. In fact, our
procedure removes only three sites of the top-100 U.S. retail
websites in 2009 [15].
Finally, panelists who never visited any of the remaining
472 web sites are removed. The ﬁnal data set consists of
138,213 visits made by 7, 235 comScore panelists. Each visit
is deﬁned as a list of websites accessed by an individual
panelist during a speciﬁc calender week. To give an example, a
list (qvc.com, hsn.com, gap.com, childrensplace.com, qv.com)
indicates that a panelist accesses these website (and qvc.com
twice) in the respective week. On average panelists make 19.1
weekly visits. The average number of visits per site amounts
to 1,035, the average number of sites per visit is 3.5.

MAJOR RESULTS
A. LDA Results
We estimate LDA models using blocked Gibbs sampling.
The ﬁrst 1,000 iterations are discarded for burn-in and esti-
mates are based on the next 1,000 iterations. α is estimated
and β is set to a constant value of 0.1. To avoid local optima
we let the number of latent interests vary between 2 and 110.
We evaluate model performance by the Bayesian informa-
tion criterion (BIC), which penalizes model complexity [21]:
BIC = LL − 0.5 np log(I)
with
np = TJ.
(2)
According to Equation (2) the BIC is based on the log-
likelihood LL, the number of visits I and the number of
parameters np of the topic model. The number of parameters
equals the number of latent interests T multiplied by the
number of sites J. The model with the highest BIC is to
be preferred. The log likelihood LL of a LDA model (nij
indicates how often site j is contained in visit i) is computed
as follows [19]:
LL =
I

We obtain the best BIC value for 86 latent interests and
conclude that 86 latent interests best describe the browsing
behavior of our sample of households. Hence, our 472 websites
are compressed into 86 latent interests and browsing patterns
of online shoppers are generated by combinations of multiple
latent interests.

Both the derived latent interests and the sites reﬂected by
these interests differ in their contribution to characterize the
observed visitation or browsing patterns. Table II represents
the twelve most important latent interests. The importance of
each interest t is measured by its expected frequency, which
we obtain by summing θti across all visits i = 1, · · · , I. The
interest with the highest expected frequency is considered to be
the most important one. In addition, we indicate importance of
a site j for each interest t by the estimated φjt value excluding
small values φjt < 0.01.
Table II illustrates the six most important latent interests.
The most important interest # 1 is related to two sites, i.e.,
qvc.com and hsn.com. Based on the contents offered by these
sites we label this topic “home shopping”. On the other hand,
interest # 2 is related to only one site satisfying the condition
φjk < 0.01, namely usps.com. Both interests # 3 and # 5 also
refer to similar sites. Given the relatively broach combination
of underlying sites, we label interest # 3 as “apparel”. Whereas
sites like gap.com and bananarepublic.com are rather classical
online apparel stores with mainly adult customers, children-
splace.com and gymboree.com offer apparel for babies and
kids. This is in contrast to the sites associated with interest #
5, which we label as “young adults apparel”. These sites focus
primarily on casual and lifestyle products. Sites belonging
to interest # 4 are clearly serving amateurs’ needs and we
therefore label this interest “home improvement”. Interest # 6
consists of two different kind of sites, i.e. toys and layette.
However, as site toysrus.com dominates this interest we label
this interest “toys”. The remaining latent interests can be
characterized in an analogous manner.

B. Segment-Speciﬁc Website Browsing Behavior
To gain a better understanding on how online shoppers
combine these latent interests over time, we aim at generating
segments of panelists and study their differences with respect
to discriminating latent interests and implications for purchase
behavior. We ﬁrst group panelists based on the results of the
selected LDA model using k-means clustering. For clustering
the panelists we calculate the expected frequency fht of each
interest t by summing θti across all visits of each panelist h
and logit-transform it as follows:
log fht − log(max
h′
fh′t − fht + 0.00001).
(4)
We let the number of segments k vary between 2 and 60 and
choose a seven segment solution, which reproduces 91.8% of
the total sum of squares. Anyway, based on experience with
data sets for similar numbers of respondents we did not expect
to obtain more than ten segments.
Table III describes the seven resulting segments. In terms
of number of panelists segments 5 and 6 are the two largest
segments each containing 17%, while segment 1 is the small-
est. By looking at the number of website visits we obtain
quite different results. Segment 1 is largest in this regard and
segment 7 the smallest, representing just one percent of overall
website visitations.
It turns out that panelists’ browsing behavior differs sub-
stantially across the derived segments (see table III). Members
of segment 1 are active almost throughout the whole year,
i.e., in 45.6 out of 53 examined calendar weeks. In contrast,
panelists in segment 7 seem to browse quite irregularly with an
average number of active weeks of just 2. Those households
who are active throughout the year also combine more websites
in their weekly visits; while segment 1 members visit, on
average, 5.7 websites per week, the respective number for
segments 6 and 7 are just below 2 websites with the potential
of being purchase relevant.
Next we explore whether the derived segments also dif-
fer regarding the latent interests characterizing the segment
members’ online browsing patterns and if so, which speciﬁc
interests are discriminating between segments the most. To
this end, we test each of the 86 latent interests for signiﬁcant
differences in average visitation importances (measured as

average importance less than lowest quartile (L), greater than highest quartile (H)
average expected frequencies) across the seven segments using
a series of oneway analyses of variance. Ten latent interests
turned out to differentiate signiﬁcantly between the segments
(α < 0.05). For these ten signiﬁcant latent interests, table III
indicates for each segment whether the average importances
are less than the lowest quartile (L) or greater than the highest
quartile (H). As an example, consider the interest ”travel
service”. It consists of the sites travelocity.com, orbitz.com
and cheaptickets.com and is very important for segments 3
and 4. We ﬁnd interests related to online shopping activities
for product categories offered by department stores including
apparel and fashion goods, which shape the browsing behavior
of the highly active segment 1 representing around 11% of
our panel household sample. On the other side, we ﬁnd a
substantial fraction of panel households, in particular those
gathered in segments 3 or 5, which score relatively low on
these dimensions but browse the interned particularly for travel
and ticketing purposes.
C. Segment-Speciﬁc Purchasing Behavior
In addition, we examine how latent interests are translated
into purchasing behavior. Table IV shows the percentage of
panelists making at least one online purchase in 2009. Whereas
most panelists in segment 1 purchase at least once, about the
same fraction of online panelists in segment 6 never purchases
online.
The conversion of weekly website visits into purchases
is also much higher for segment 1 (with almost 12% of
visits) when compared to other segments. In addition, online
shoppers who purchase more frequently also tend to buy more
products and spend more money. Again, panelists in segment 1
purchase more products and spend higher amounts online than
all the other panelists do. About 25 percent (segment 1 and 2
members) realize about 70 percent of overall online sales.
To gain a more thorough understanding which product cat-
egories beneﬁt the most from the conversion of site visits into
purchases, we systematically compare differences in average
numbers of purchases among 59 product categories in each
of the seven discussed segments. To this end, we conduct
0.5 × 59 × 58 = 1711 pairwise comparisons of category
purchases, which implies a Bonferroni corrected signiﬁcance
level of α = 0.05/1830 [12]. In six out of seven segments,
we obtain signiﬁcantly different category pairs. Note that for

segments with very low conversion rates (as given in table

we ﬁnd in segment 1 most signiﬁcant differences.

Contains categories with 20 or more signiﬁcant comparisons. Reading example for
apparel and segment 1: for segment 1 the yearly purchase frequency of apparel is
signiﬁcantly higher than the purchase frequencies of 58 other categories.
Table V represents, for each segment, a list of product
categories ranked in descending order of their respective
number of signiﬁcant comparisons. Note that these lists can be
interpreted as rankings of product categories with respect to
their importances for online purchases made by the respective
segment members. Interestingly, categories apparel and food
& beverage are always among the top three positions in these
segment-speciﬁc lists, which implies that these two categories
dominate virtually all online shopper segments.
However, the “big picture” of a subset representing about
a quarter of panel households (i.e., segment 1 and 2) being
particularly active, purchase a lot, and — in addition — do so
across a wide range of assortment is conﬁrmed by this category
speciﬁc view of online purchase activities. On contrary, seg-
ments 5 and 6 show only few product categories with purchase
frequencies higher than those of other categories. But there
are also some notable differences between the highly active
segments 1 and 2 in terms of their purchase behavior. For
example, health & beauty and books & magazines attain higher
purchase frequencies only in segments 1 and 2, respectively.
For segment 2 members, hotel reservations clearly play a much
more important role as they do in the visits of segment 1. The
contrary applies to categories arts, crafts & party supplies or
bed & bath, which dominate more of the other categories in
segment 1 as opposed to segment 2.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Weekly clickstream data of panelists across 472 websites
can be adequately compressed into a mixture of 86 latent
interests. Using k-means clustering of the panelists’ impor-
tances devoted to these latent interests, we determine seven
online shopper segments. These segments are characterized
by remarkable differences both in terms of the way they
combine various latent interests and in the intensity of their
overall online activity. Moreover, these segments also show
marked differences in their online purchasing behavior, both in
individual product categories and at a more aggregate level. We
ﬁnd that around 25 percent of online shoppers (segments 1 and
2) realize 70 percent of online sales and apparel as well as food
& beverage are in all of the examined online shopper segments
among the dominating product categories. However, we also
detect substantial segment-speciﬁc differences of shopping
behavior across categories.
The approach presented in this paper also faces some
limitations which offer opportunities for future research efforts.
Here we pursue a two step approach, starting with a topic
model, which provides discrete latent variables. In the second
step we obtain clusters of panelists based on the importances of
these latent variables for the visits of each panelist. To develop
and apply a topic model, which integrates these two steps by
also taking heterogeneity of panelist into account constitutes
an interesting future research endeavor. Another possibility
consists in allowing latent variables (interests) to evolve over
time. For such an extension, dynamic effects must be included
in a topic model. However, such an extension also requires
more data spanning over several years.
