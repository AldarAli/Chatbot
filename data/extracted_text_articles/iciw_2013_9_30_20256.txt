Abstract— In hypermedia systems, adaptive navigation 
support becomes a necessity because it helps the user to 
distinguish between relevant and irrelevant links. It can reduce 
the loss of time and resolves the disorientation problem. For this, 
several adaptive navigation technologies are proposed to be 
applied on simple links to support the user along his navigation. 
In this paper, we propose an adaptive navigation method based 
on a new adaptive navigation technology called “Extended Link 
Technology”, which allows restricting the navigation space by 
using the XLINK extended links. This technology can be applied 
on both simple and extended link by taking into account several 
parameters related to the user and the visited documents.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Currently, data sources in digital format are growing. 
Therefore, the volume of data and the number of links that 
connect these data increase. So, the user may be lost in the huge 
amount of information and links which makes the access to the 
relevant information more difficult. Thus, navigation adaptation 
is the solution that supports the user to find pertinent links to 
the suitable information. Thereby, the user will not be lost in 
the hyperspace in front of the large number of links and the 
disorientation problem can be resolved. 
Several adaptive navigation methods and navigation 
technologies have been proposed to help the user by guiding 
him from a document to another, providing him with a set of 
pertinent links leading to the suitable information. The 
navigation adaptation result varies from one user to another, 
generally according to his profile (needs, preferences, 
necessities, etc.). But these methods as proposed in [15][7] and 
technologies as proposed in [4][5] are applied only on simple 
links and do not take into account the extended links. So, to 
better reduce the disorientation problem, the navigation space 
and the number of pertinent links displayed to the user, we 
propose an adaptive navigation method based on a new 
adaptive navigation technology which takes into account the 
extended links. This method is an extension of our proposed 
method in [19]. Our proposed technology allows to reduce the 
number of pertinent links in document by using the XLINK 
extended links (W3C [17]). So, we will apply on documents 
both our new technology and the already existing technologies 
by taking into account several adaptation parameters. These 
parameters are related not only to the user but also to the visited 
documents. 
In order to realize our method, we propose an algorithm that 
takes as input the adaptation parameters to outputting the 
expected navigation adaptation. This algorithm uses two 
functions: the first function assigns scores to links in order to 
differentiate them (irrelevant, relevant, less relevant, more 
relevant, etc.) and the second function applies on document our 
new adaptive navigation technology in order to extract 
extended links from the simple links. 
To evaluate our method, we perform a series of experiments 
on the INEX 2007 collection. The results of this evaluation are 
satisfying and prove the efficiency of our method. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a 
state of the art of some works dealing with the navigation 
adaptation. In Section III, we expose an overview of our 
method. In Section IV, we detail the main algorithm and 
functions on which our method is based. In Section V, we 
evaluate our proposed method. Finally, we present the 
conclusion and our perspectives. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
Navigation adaptation is mainly based on the adaptation of 
documents’ links by using the adaptive navigation support 
technologies [4]. The most known and used technologies are 
the link hiding technology, the link annotation technology, the 
direct guidance technology, the link ordering technology and 
the link generation technology. 
The AHA! [6], for example, applies the hiding technology 
to irrelevant links and the link annotation technology to the 
remaining links by using different colors depending on the 
user’s model (preferences, knowledge). Hypadapter [9] 
introduced the link ordering technology; the idea is to put links 
in order of relevance according to the user’s model. The direct 
guidance technology is used to provide only one direct link to 
the next document to be visited. Among the works that use this 
technology, we cite Web Watcher [1], ELM-ART [8] and 
Chiou et al. [7]. The most used technology is the link 
generation technology. It provides links to the best documents. 
These latter are identified by means of different methods that 
vary from one system to another. The adaptive system proposed 
by Verma et al. [14] calculates and ranks the weight of each 
web page in the priority of descending order according to click-
count, hyperlink weight and most frequent visits to the 
webpage. Then, it proposes link to the first page. The system 
proposed in [15] analyzes navigation paths of website visitors 
to identify the frequent surfing paths and provides the user with 
a set of links that leads to the next visited web pages. Seo et al. 
[13] propose two methods based on the generation technology. 
The first one suggests the next link to be followed by the user 
and the second one generates quick links as additional entry 
points into Websites. The system proposed in [20] extracts the

links and the key words from the already visited pages in order 
to propose a set of links that lead to the relevant pages. 
The already mentioned works apply the navigation 
adaptation only to simple links (lead to only one document or 
page). As a matter of fact, the number of the pertinent simple 
links is not reduced. Furthermore, these works adapt the 
navigation by taking into account only the user’s parameters 
without caring about the documents’ parameters. So, we 
propose a new adaptive navigation technology called “Extended 
Link Technology” based on the XLINK extended links which 
reduces the number of the pertinent simple links on document 
and can be applied on simple and extended links. Our new 
technology with the already existing technologies is applied to a 
document before being displayed to the user in order to support 
him along his navigation. 
III. 
OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED METHOD 
In order to help the user to easily reach the pertinent 
information by choosing the best link and to reduce the 
disorientation problem, we propose a method that adapts the 
navigation by using: (i) the already existing adaptive navigation 
technologies [4] and (ii) a new adaptive navigation technology 
called “Extended link technology”. This method is used in our 
architecture MEDI-ADAPT [18] and it is considered as an 
extension of our detailed work in [19] which allows identifying 
the best navigation path between the result documents. So, after 
identifying the navigation path, we propose to apply to each 
document, at run time, our new method. This latter consists of 6 
steps. The first step is to extract the links of document in order 
to apply to the irrelevant links the “hiding link technology” 
(Step 2). The third step is to calculate the scores of links (cf. 
section IV.2). In the fourth step, we apply the “Extended link 
technology” (cf. section IV.3). Then in the step fifth, the 
identified extended links are generated in the document. Finally 
in the last step, according to the obtained scores in step 3, we 
apply on simple and extended links the suitable adaptive 
navigation technologies.  
The scores of links, which are calculated in the step 3, have 
a very important role in our adaptation process. When 
calculating these scores, we propose to take into account several 
parameters; parameters related to the user which are extracted 
from the user profile and parameters related to the links target 
documents which are extracted from their descriptive meta-
documents. In the following, we describe the proposed user 
profile and meta-documents. 
A. The proposed user profile 
The user profile is a basic component in adaptive systems. It 
contains data that describe the user’s characteristics. According 
to Brusilovsky [5]: “user profile is composed of a set of 
categories: personal data, user’s knowledge, interests, history, 
and preferences”. There are different models to represent user 
profile: the attribute/value model [10], the logical structure 
based model (usually in a tree form) and the semantic based 
model via standards e.g. FOAF [3], CC/PP [11], and CSCP [2]. 
In this paper, as we are interested in navigation adaptation, we 
consider only the profile’s navigation part (the user’s 
navigation history). This latter is built from analysis and 
updates of previous navigation sessions. We represent the 
proposed profile as an XML tree as illustrated in the XML 
schema in Figure 1. 
 
 
Fig. 1. XML-schema of the proposed user profile 
To describe the user’s history (HISTORY), we distinguish 
two parameters: one for the session (SESSION_PARAM) and 
another for the user (USER_PARAM). The first one consists of 
the number of sessions (NB_SESSION) and their duration 
(DURATION). As for the second one, it is made up by the 
visited documents (VISITED_DOCS) which are identified by 
(ID_DOC), the number of access to each document 
(NB_ACCESS), 
the 
spent 
time 
on 
each 
document 
(SPENT_TIME), the visited links (VISITED_LINKS) and the 
number of clicks (NB_CLICK) on each link (ID_LINK). In the 
end of each session, these parameters are updated or stored in 
the user’s profile in order to be taken into account in next 
sessions. 
B. The proposed meta-documents 
Meta-documents 
[1] 
contain 
meta-data 
which 
are 
information that can identify a document and describe its 
content. These information are stored in a document called 
“meta-document”. In this paper, we suggest to describe a 
document by three parameters stored in the XML meta-
document illustrated by the XML schema in Figure 2. These 
parameters are taken into account in the navigation adaptation 
process.

As we can see in Figure 2, we propose three parameters: (i) 
the Unified Resource Locator (URL), (ii) the required device 
configuration (CONFIG) which is limited to the Operating 
System (OS) and the Random Access Memory (RAM) and (iii) 
the specific themes (SPECIFIC_THEME), knowing that a 
document can belong to one or several themes. These themes 
are consequently used to apply the “Extended link technology”: 
simple links belonging to the same theme are grouped into one 
extended link. For each theme (ID_THEME), we specify the 
benefit of the document (BENEFIT_THEME) which depends 
on the theme. It is similar to the “profit of learning object” 
proposed in [7]. It is a value ranged from 0 to 1. It can be 
identified by the document’s author based on the relevance of 
the document’s content to each theme. 
IV. 
THE ADAPTIVE XLINK EXTENDED LINK 
TECHNOLOGY 
The originality of our method lies in the use of the new 
adaptive navigation technology “Extended link technology”. 
This technology is based on the idea of the XLINK extended 
links. W3C [17] “An extended link is a link that associates an 
arbitrary number of resources. The participating resources may 
be any combination of remote and local”. This technology 
allows to reduce the navigation space by reducing the number 
of links in the document and enables the user to have an idea 
about the related theme of each link.  
 
Fig. 3. The XML schema of the generated Extended Links 
The basic idea of this technology is to regroup several 
simple links that belong to the same theme into a single 
extended link. The founded extended links in document will be 
generated according to the XML schema illustrated in Figure 3, 
and take the theme’s name as a title. Then, the resources of each 
extended link are subsequently reordered by using the "ordering 
link technology" and annotated by the "annotation link 
technology". We will apply, at run time, this technology on 
links with the already existing adaptive navigation technologies 
[3]. In the next section, we will present in detail the main 
algorithm which performs our proposed method and the two 
basic functions. The function that calculates the scores of links 
and the function that applies to document the “Extended link 
technology”. 
A. The main algorithm of the proposed method “ANT” 
To apply our method, we propose the algorithm called 
“ANT” (Apply the Navigation Technologies) which applies the 
adaptive navigation technologies on the documents (cf. Table 
I). This algorithm uses two functions. The first function, called 
“CLS” (Calculate Link Score) (cf. Table II), which calculates 
the scores of links. The second function, called “ELT” 
(Extended Link Technology) (cf. Table III), which allows to 
apply the Extended link technology.

For each link related to themes other than the requested by 
the user, the algorithm applies the hiding technology (lines (7) 
to (10)). Then, for all the remaining links (line (14)), it 
determines the target document (line (19)), the benefit of this 
document (line (20)), calculates its score (line (21)) [5], and 
calculates the link’s score (line (22)) by using the function 
“CLS” (cf. Table II). After that it extracts and generates at run 
time, if exists, extended links (lines (24) and (25)) by using the 
function “ELT” (cf. Table III).

B. The CLS function 
The CLS function calculates the scores of links. These 
scores allow to distinguish between links and choose the 
suitable adaptive navigation technologies. These scores depend 
on the already cited parameters in the previous sections (cf. 
Sections III.1 and III.2) and are calculated by the calculation 
equation (1).

     (1) 
Doc_Score(target_doc) is the score of the link target 
document. It is detailed in [19]. In the case of an extended link 
(having more than one target documents), we proceed to sum 
the scores of all target documents. Doc_Score(target_doc)) then 
divide it by the total number of the target documents 
(nb_target_doc). link_freqm(li) is the average frequency of 
clicking on the link during all sessions. It is calculated by the 
calculation equation (2).

nb_click(li) is the number of clicks on the link in one 
session, nb_total_click is the total number of the visited links 
and nb _session is the total number of sessions. 
The CLS function (cf. table II) takes as input the score of 
the document Doc_Score, the history of the user user_history 
and the link link. Firstly, it extracts, from the user’s history, the 
number of clicks on the link and the total number of clicks. 
Secondly, it calculates, by means of the equation (2) the 
average frequency of clicking on the link (line (8)). Finally, it 
uses the equation (1) to calculate the link’s score Link_Score 
(line (9)).  
C. The ELT function 
The ELT function (cf. Table III) extracts, if exist, extended 
links from the simple links in order to be generated in the 
document before being displayed to the user. It takes as input 
the simple links of a document and their scores Link_Scores.  
TABLE III. ELT FUNCTION 
The basic idea of this function is to regroup all simple links 
that belong to the same theme into a single extended link (from 
line (8) to line (19)). Then, the resources of each extended link 
are reordered and annotated according to their scores (lines (20) 
and (21)). 
V. 
EVALUATION 
In order to evaluate our proposed method, we use a corpus 
of 110000 documents of INEX 2007 [16] French version, 
which is a part of the collection WIKIPEDIA XML. 
Documents in this corpus contain only XLINK simple links. 
Given a user launches this query: "Documents related to 
the norms and computer standards", the system provides 11 
documents called (XML, ASCII, SGML, HTML, XSL, ANSI, 
10B5, 10BT, 10B2, Vietnam, SAMP) 
When we apply the “Extended link technology” to the XSL 
document, for example, we will have 2 extended links. A part 
of the obtained result is shown in table IV (Knowing that the 
XML and XPATH documents belong to the same theme 
named “XML”).

We evaluate the use of our proposed method and especially 
the "Extended Link Technology". This evaluation is performed 
by computing the obtained links number firstly without 
navigation adaptation, secondly with well-known (The already 
existing) navigation adaptation technologies and thirdly with 
these latter and our proposed technology “Extended Link 
Technology” (cf. Table V).

The variation in the number of links is illustrated in Figure 
4. The obtained results show that the use of the well-known 
navigation adaptation technologies reduces the number of links 
from 195 to 61. But by applying our proposed technology 
“Extended Link Technology” we achieve the low number of 
pertinent links (from 195 links to 26). This means that, by 
applying our technology with the already existing technology 
the number of links can reduce to 86.666667%.

To evaluate the user’s satisfaction, we have given him two

and a version with applying our technology. Then, he tries to 
indicate the relevant links and the irrelevant ones. For him, 
these latter are links that should have remained simple and not 
hidden within an extended link. Table VI illustrates the number 
of relevant links and the number of the irrelevant links.

Based on the number of links shown in Table VI, we 
calculated the precision of the extended links in each document 
(cf. Figure 5).  
 
Fig. 5. The precision rates of the extended links 
The evaluation of the user’s satisfaction allowed us to 
obtain 0.85223 as an average precision. This can confirm the 
user’s satisfaction. So, the user will have a limited number of 
well annotated links and can have from the extended links title 
an idea about the themes of the target documents. That’s why; 
the probability of being disoriented is very limited.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have proposed a method of navigation 
adaptation which is based on the already existing adaptive 
navigation technologies and on a new adaptive navigation 
technology called “Extended Links Technology”. This new 
technology is mainly based on the idea of the XLINK extended

links and can be applied at run time to simple and extended 
links. 
As it is shown in the evaluation, our new adaptive 
navigation technology allows to reduce the number of pertinent 
links in document. Thus, the navigation space and the 
disorientation probability can be reduced.  
In the continuation of our work, we aim firstly to evaluate 
our method with more than one user and evaluate their 
satisfaction. Secondly, we intend to improve our proposed 
method by taking into account other parameters. Finally, we are 
going to suggest and implement a learning method that reduces 
the profile to the most relevant content.
