Abstract—Heterogeneous Networks are introduced in LTE-
Advanced in order to fulfill the demanding necessity for more 
network capacity by the deployment of small cell nodes. In this 
paper, we study the dense deployment of small cells in hotspot 
to cover the users’ data requests. The aim is to determine the 
optimum number of outdoor nodes per hotspot to achieve 
highest average user throughput. The results indicate that 
there is a range of optimum number of small cell nodes 
depending on the density of data traffic and the trade-off 
between available capacity and inter small cell interference. 
Introducing the small cells layer results in better channel 
conditions for some users that are close to small cells nodes. 
Thus, this encourages the usage of higher order modulation 
schemes like 256QAM. Adopting 256QAM infers that 
impairments caused by transmitter and receiver circuitry 
should be considered while evaluating the feasibility of 
256QAM for outdoor small cells in heterogeneous networks. 
Results show that impairments have considerable negative 
effect on 256QAM throughput gains compared impairments-

INTRODUCTION 
Small Cells (SCs) and Heterogeneous Networks 
(HetNets) are considered one of the LTE-Advanced research 
topics that grasped interest in the recent time [1]. It is 
expected that the data rates requested by mobile subscribers 
will increase significantly in the coming years [2]. In 
addition to that, LTE-Advanced will need to satisfy new 
usage models that involve a giant hump in some services 
especially mobile data and video streaming. HetNets appears 
as a promising solution for LTE-Advanced to provide higher 
data rates and quality of service in the areas of high density 
of users. 
HetNets are access networks consisting of multiple 
operating layers with different characteristics. The main 
layer is the Macro-layer that consists of Macrocell Nodes 
(MCNs) with high transmission power; and it is responsible 
for the coverage in an entire site. While the SCs layer, which 
is based on low-power nodes, is deployed in areas of high 
throughput requirements known as Hotspots.  
The SCs layer nodes can be categorized based on density 
of deployment to sparsely dropped SCs or densely dropped 
SCs in hotspot areas [1]. SCs nodes also differ in range of 
coverage ranging from small apartments /offices (Femto 
Cells) 
supporting 
Closed 
Subscriber 
Group 
(CSG) 
functionality [3][4] to larger areas like halls and airports 
(Pico Cells). Another dimension of classification is the 
deployment environment; since SC nodes can be deployed 
indoors or outdoors at lower heights compared to MCNs.  
The deployment of SCs results in interference problems 
for User Equipment (UEs) in both layers [4][5] that should 
be 
suppressed 
by 
different 
interference 
mitigation 
algorithms, such as, ICIC, eICIC and FeICIC [6][7] and 
power control techniques [3][4]. 
In this paper, we focus on boosting UE throughput by 
enhancing the performance of HetNets with outdoor SCs. 
The enhancement is achieved using two aspects. The first 
aspect is increasing the density of clusterization of SCs in 
hotspots. The second aspect is the application of higher order 
modulations schemes like 256QAM for higher data rates at 
user terminals. 
Dense clusterization of SCs is used at hotspots to provide 
closer serving nodes, i.e., better channel conditions, to more 
UEs for better network capacity and reducing traffic load on 
Macro layer. The disadvantage of the high density 
deployment of SCs is the non-negligible inter-SC 
interference. This harms Signal to Interference and Noise 
Ratio (SINR) between UEs and SC nodes resulting in 
throttled UE throughput. Thus, maintaining an optimum 
density of SC deployment is required to taper interference 
and to maximize throughput for UEs.  
Being closer to UEs, less propagation losses to be 
suffered and better channel conditions and SINR are 
maintained between UEs and SCs nodes. Thus, higher 
performance could be achieved by introducing higher order 
modulation schemes like 256QAM to be an available option 
on the SC layer for UEs served by SCs. We study the gain 
achieved by 256QAM scheme in an outdoor HetNet 
environment and the negative effect of transmitter and 
receiver impairments on these gains. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II 
presents simulation environment and parameters. In Section 
III, the effect of the SCs density on user throughput is 
discussed. We introduce 256QAM modulation scheme and 
transmitter and receiver impairments modeling in Section 
IV. Section V provides the results of performance evaluation 
of supporting higher order modulation in the existence of 
transmitter and receiver impairments. Finally, Section VI 
concludes the paper.

II. 
SIMULATION PARAMETERS 
The simulated network layout is based on 7 hexagonal 
sites where each site is divided into three sectors as shown in 
Figure 1. Each sector has one hotspot area of 70m radius 
called cluster with 67% of UEs dropped in it and the rest of 
UEs are uniformly dropped in sector. The cluster has (N) SC 
nodes dropped uniformly within a radius of 50m from cluster 
center [8]. To model real cases, 80% of UEs are assumed to 
be indoor UEs suffering outdoor to indoor losses [8].  
The Macro layer and SC layer operate in non-co-channel 
mode (no inter-layer interference). MCNs operate at center 
frequency of 2GHz. While on the other side, SCs operate at 
center frequency of 3.5 GHz. Bandwidth of 10 MHz is 
available at both center frequencies. Communication is fully 
downlink and stochastic channel models were used for 
macro layer and SCs layer [9].  
Data traffic is modeled using bursty FTP traffic model 1 
[10] as a closer traffic model to real traffic. In this model, 
one or more UEs are assumed to request data download of 
size 0.5 MB from the serving node at random time instants 
of a Poisson distribution (Exponential inter-request time 
periods). Simulation parameters are described in Tables I, II, 
III. 
Simulations were held on a MATLAB-based System 
Level Simulator (SLS). The SLS models the propagation 
losses and the fast fading channel for the urban macrocell 
(UMa) and urban microcell (UMi) environments. Then, UEs 
are associated with the serving nodes based on Reference 
Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) which is calculated by  
RSRQNRB * RSRPRSSI
where RSRP stands for Reference Signal Received Power, 
NRB is the number of resource blocks and RSSI is the 
Received Signal Strength Indicator including received power 
from serving and interfering nodes and noise power [11].  
RSRQ is used since it takes interference into 
consideration which is a decisive factor when HetNet layers 
operate at different frequencies and the interference profile 
differs between the macro layer and SC layer. RSRP 
(received power) as a basis for UE association is deceiving in 
the case of non-co-channel mode operation since you may 
get high received power from a serving node but at the same 
time suffer strong interference and deteriorated SINR. UE 
association process starts when UE request data download. It 
is worth noting that SC nodes that do not send data to any 
UEs, at association instant, are not considered when 
calculating interference part in RSRQ. This makes 
association decision depending on instantaneous interference 
profile derived from the instantaneous traffic in the network 
instead of assuming worst case one in which all nodes are 
assumed sending data and causing interference. Interference 
caused due to CRS signaling is also taken into consideration. 
Then, SLS generates the channel matrices and the 
interference covariance matrices used in modeling received 
signal. The received signal by kth UE (yk) is given by

III. 
DENSE CLUSTERIZATION OF SMALL CELLS 
Hotspot areas of the macrocell are congested with high 
density of UEs of huge request of data. Such requests are 
satisfied by deploying a cluster of SCs to provide an 
acceptable quality of service for these UEs.  
The tradeoff appears upon the decision of the density of 
SCs deployed per hotspot. Increasing the SCs will provide 
more resources for UEs. The advantages of this approach are 
the decrease in the waiting or blocking probability and the 
system will usually not suffer resources starvation or high 
latency. On the other hand, increasing the number of SCs in 
hotspot leads to high interference among SC (inter-SC 
interference) and a reduction in the received power at UEs. 
The resources needed to keep the system functional 
under given traffic conditions enforce a lower bound on the 
number of SCs to be deployed. While, the inter-SC 
interference caused by dense deployment of SCs enforces an 
upper bound constraint on the number of SCs to be deployed 
in a hotspot area. In addition to that, other factors may play a 
role in the tradeoff like the cost and the power consumption.  
In this section, our target is to define an optimum density 
of SCs in a hotspot between the two bounds. At this 
optimum point, highest UE throughput is achieved due to 
tolerable inter-SC interference and the existence of enough 
resources to fulfill UEs requests. 
We held system level simulations and set the 
environment as described in Section II. The number of SCs 
per cluster is varied in the range from 1 to 10 in order to find 
the optimum density of SCs per cluster to serve hotspot UEs. 
The optimum density of SC nodes in a cluster is achieved 
when all UEs (MCN UEs and SC UEs) have their average 
throughput maximized considering different traffic loads. All 
UEs are considered since the ratio of association is not 
constant when the numbers of SCs per cluster is changed due 
to the change in interference profile considered in RSRQ 
association. 
 
To achieve this target, average UE throughput is 
measured for all UEs at different number of SCs per cluster 
and at different non full buffer traffic loads (λ = 6, 10, 16 
user requests for file download per second per geographical 
cell).  
 
By applying this criterion of throughput maximization, 
the number of SCs for good performance depends on traffic 
load. For low traffic load (λ = 6), the maximum throughput 
occurs when hotspot has 4 SCs as shown in Table IV.

The throughput provided by 2 or 3 SCs is also close to the 
maximum so it may be a good option of cutting cost without 
big loss in performance (< 1%). At medium traffic load (λ = 
10), we can notice the traverse in the peak throughput to 6 
SCs per hotspot. This is expected with the increase of traffic 
where the need of resources becomes more urgent than need 
for a good SINR. This conclusion is confirmed for heavy 
traffic (λ = 16) with 6 SCs per hotpot is the optimum choice 
for SC density in this case. For heavy traffic, low number of 
SCs provide very low throughput like the case of 2 SCs or 
cannot handle the UE requests like the case of 1 SC.  
 
Looking at the extremes, with only 1SC per hotspot, 
system cannot handle heavy traffic and it suffers lack of 
resources at low and medium traffic cases. While with 10 
SCs per hotspot, the inter-SC interference increases and 
becomes very dominant and outweighs the capacity added 
to the network by adding SCs. 
 
Figure 2 presents the average UE throughput at 
different number of SCs per cluster at different traffic loads. 
The optimum number of deployed SC per hotspot varies 
with the traffic load. With the increase in traffic load, we 
can note that there is a need for more SCs to provide more 
resources to serve UEs while the overall performance of the 
network decreases. At low traffic loads, resources of small 
number of SCs are enough to fulfill UEs demands and the 
dominant factor of performance is the inter-SC interference 
that needs to be reduced. At a given constant traffic load, the

optimum density is the one that achieves a balance between 
inter-SC interference and available resources for serving 
UEs. When performance is very close for a range of SC 
densities, like the case of low traffic where 2-6 SCs can 
provide almost same performance, the choice becomes 
mainly dependent on cost and the least density is the most 
attractive choice. 
IV. 
HIGHER ORDER MODULATION & TRANSCIEVER 
IMPAIRMENTS  
A. 256QAM 
In LTE and LTE-Advanced releases (Rel.8-11), QPSK, 
16QAM and 64QAM have been the main Modulation and 
Coding Schemes (MCSs) [13]. With the introduction of 
HetNets and SCs, UEs associated with SC nodes were shown 
to have better channel characteristics and lower propagation 
losses. Hence, higher order modulations schemes like 
256QAM can be utilized to improve performance [14][15]. 
256 QAM constellation points can be defined as: 
 
Where 
 
We used link level simulations to produce an LTE 
physical layer abstraction table with 10 additional MCSs of 
multiple coding rates and their corresponding TBSs to be 
inserted in the SLS. These MCSs are being picked when 
reported SINR in feedback exceeds 20 dB [15]. Figure 3 
shows the spectral efficiencies of the added MCSs to support 
256QAM in the SLS which is higher compared to all MCSs 
of lower modulation order [15].  
B. Transmitter Impairments 
Transmitter includes many circuit parts that cause 
imperfections in the transmitted symbols. The main sources 
of these imperfections are the transmitter filter and the 
clipping and non-linearities of the power amplifier [16]. 
Thus, there is a deviation of the real transmitted symbol 
compared to ideal transmitted symbol. The percentage of this 
deviation with respect to transmission power is known as the 
Transmitter Error Vector Magnitude (TX-EVM). These 
imperfections are usually modeled as a zero mean additive 
white Gaussian noise at the transmitter with variance σ2tx 
[16].  
σ2tx  ϵtx * Pt 
where, Pt is the average transmitted power and ϵtx is (TX-
EVM%)2 
Since TX-EVM noise is applied at the transmitter side, it 
experiences the fast fading channel like the transmitted 
signals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C. Receiver Impairments 
Receiver circuitry causes imperfections in symbols 
decoding as well. The receiver impairments causing factors 
are mainly the receiver local oscillator phase noise, receiver 
dynamic range, I/Q imbalance, carrier leakage and carrier 
frequency offset [16]. The receiver impairments are 
expressed in the value of Receiver Error Vector Magnitude 
(RX-EVM). RX-EVM is the percentage of deviation of the 
real received symbols compared to the ideal received symbol 
assuming perfect receiver. It is a noise that does not carry 
channel fading characteristics but it is proportional to the 
average received power. RX-EVM is modeled similar to TX-
EVM as a zero mean additive white Gaussian noise at the 
receiver with variance σ2rx [16] 
σ2rx ϵrx * Pr 
where, Pr is the average received power and ϵrx is (RX-
EVM%)2 
Both TX-EVM and RX-EVM have their negative effect 
on the final received signal (y) at a given UE:  
 
The SINR (𝛾) is reduced by adding to the interference and 
noise part in the denominator as shown 
 
ntx and nrx are the noise modeling transceiver impairments. 
Utilizing higher order modulations such as 256QAM, 
tolerable imperfections at the transmitter and receiver are 
reduced since the distance between constellation points are 
shorter. For example, in 64QAM modulation, TX-EVM is 
assumed to be 8% [8]. While for 256QAM modulation, TX-
EVM is assumed in the range (3% - 6%) [8]. There is no 
determined value for RX-EVM but in most of research they 
are assumed in the same range of values of TX-EVM or less 
(1.5% - 4%) [8]. 
Transceiver impairments limit the performance of the 
system so they should be considered while evaluating the 
throughput gains due to enabling higher order modulation 
schemes such as 256QAM.

V. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RESULTS 
To evaluate the performance enhancement due to the 
application of 256QAM, a HetNet with one cluster of 4 
outdoor SC nodes is simulated in the SLS with the same 
simulation parameters described in section II. 256QAM 
modulation is provided by SCs only. MCNs do not need to 
support 256QAM since macro channel conditions do not 
allow notable utilization of higher order modulation and 
64QAM is sufficient.  
The downlink data traffic is modeled using a bursty FTP 
traffic model 1. The performance metric for evaluation is the 
average per user throughput for SC associated UEs (Two 
thirds of UEs in most cases) who are candidates to utilize 
256QAM and the average per user throughput for all UEs. 
The throughput was calculated in two cases, Case 1 with no 
impairments at transmitter and receiver. In Case 2, both 
transmitter and receiver impairments are taken into 
consideration. EVM percentages and traffic parameters are 
described in Table V. The throughput with 256QAM 
supported is compared against the throughput with only up to 
64QAM supported to quantify the enhancement in all cases 
in terms of percentage gain at given utilization of resources 
(Amount of exploited Resource Blocks (RBs) out of  all 
available RBs over the whole simulation time). 
Instantaneous SINR CDFs for Cases 1, 2 are shown in 
Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. There is a good potential 
for 256QAM in Case 1 since about 22-27% of file transfers 
have enough SINR (SINR > 20dB [15]) and can utilize 
256QAM at all simulated traffic rates. It also indicates that 
with the increase of traffic, SINR decreases and hence less 
file transfers can occur with 256QAM. For Case 2, the 
percentage of UEs who have promising channel conditions 
for file transfer using 256QAM decreases to about 21-23%. 
In Case 1 (with no impairments), support of 256QAM by 
the SCs layer nodes results in average per user throughput 
gains for UEs served by SCs ranging from 6% to 9% at SC 
resource utilizations in the range from 6% to 11%. It is worth 
noting that, as traffic load decreases, throughput and gains 
tend to increase as shown in Table VI by comparing gains 
for (λ = 14) to lower values.  
In Case 2 (with both transmitter and receiver 
impairments), the gains due to the support of 256QAM are 
reduced. They are ranging from 2% to 3% for SC associated 
UEs as shown in Table VII. This is expected due to the 
increase of the modeled deviation in transmitted and received 
symbols by having impairments at both transmitter and 
receiver. This is reflected in terms of more noise impacting 
the system as can be found in (8). So, SINR 𝛾 decreases and 
throughput degrades as can be deduced from (9). Effect of 
impairments can be seen in Figure 5 where instantaneous 
SINR is capped at 30 dB [8]. 
This degradation can also be noticed from comparing 
absolute values of throughput at different traffic load levels. 
The absolute throughput at any given traffic load decreases 
when TX, RX impairments are added. Simulations also 
shown that impairments also decreases the chances of using 
256QAM (256QAM Utilization Ratio) compared to no 
impairments case as shown in Table VIII

From a practical point of view, 256QAM as a higher order 
modulation technique is promising for SCs with low density 
of users (especially indoor femtocells). With moving 
outdoors and increasing UE density, the gains decrease. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a HetNet with outdoor SCs layer was 
simulated to study two main aspects. The first aspect is the 
effect of the dense clusterization of SCs in a hotspot of 70m 
radius on throughput and performance. We found that the 
optimum number of SCs for deployment for tolerable level 
of inter-SC interference and maximized performance 
depends on traffic. For low traffic, it is 2-4 SCs while we 
need 6 SCs for medium and high traffic. It was found that 
with the increase in traffic rate, more SCs are needed to 
provide more resources and handle UEs requests. On the 
other hand, at low traffic rates, inter-SC interference is 
dominant and the needed number of SC decreases. Another 
factor affects decision when the performance is constant over 
a range of cluster densities which is cost and least density in 
the range is preferred.  
The second aspect was to evaluate the performance gains 
resulting from supporting 256QAM for outdoor SC layer in 
HetNets. It was found that about 6%-9% average throughput 
gains per UE could be achieved for SC UEs. While, 
introducing imperfections at the transmitter and receiver 
sides leads to a decrease in throughput and performance 
gains of 256QAM compared to traditional 64QAM. Only 
2%-3% increase in throughput occur in this case.
