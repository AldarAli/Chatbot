Abstract—Obesity is an increasing drain on the resources 
of general practitioners, who have few effective options for 
treatment other than surgery and (often prohibitively 
expensive) personal dietician advice. This pilot project 
investigated the weight loss efficacy and the cost of an 
interactive internet-based weight loss program in a Danish 
medical center setting. The study comprised an initial weight 
loss period of approximately 4 months, consisting of frequent 
online consultations with a dietician and an exercise coach 
supported by electronic diaries and establishment of an online 
community, where the patients exchanged experiences with 
other users of the program. This was followed by a 16-month 
maintenance treatment providing less intensive counseling. Of 
46 obese patients offered participation, 32 patients were 
enrolled in the study and 21 completed the full course. The 
mean weight at inclusion was 104 kg with a BMI of 36.4 kg/m2. 
After 4 months of treatment and an average of 17 consultations 
the participants lost on average 7.0 kg, p<0.001. During the 16-
month maintenance period, the average weight did not change 
and 81% of the participants retained or increased their initial 
weight loss. The cost of the initial treatment was calculated as 
165 DKK (approx. €22) per kg weight lost. These results 
indicate that e-mail consultations can produce comparable 
weight loss as conventional weight loss treatments in general 
practice at a lower cost, particularly for sustaining the weight 
loss over a longer period of time. The results of this 
preliminary uncontrolled study with few participants indicate 
that future randomized clinical trials with more participants 
comparing the e-consultations with relevant conventional 
practices are justified, in order to quantify effect and long-
term cost-efficiency of e-consultations as an intervention 
against obesity.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 Obesity is a growing problem, resulting in an increasing 
demand for efficient weight loss treatments suitable for use 
in general practice settings [1]. According to the 
Framingham study, obesity shortens life by 3 to 8 years for a 
40-year-old person [2] demonstrating the urgent need for 
effective ways to reduce obesity.  
Form and content of communication are important in 
order to modify life style factors [3], which is the general 
recommendation to obtain a sustainable weight reduction. 
Several Cochrane reviews infer that advice from general 
practitioners (GPs) by itself does not have a long-term effect 
on weight loss compared to placebo [4]. Dietician guidance 
and the establishment of group meetings have a significant 
effect in the short term, but only few long-term studies are 
available [4][5]. Surgical intervention is an effective long-
term weight loss option, but in Denmark it is reserved for 
very obese patients [5]. Consequently no documented 
effective non-surgical weight loss offers are available to the 
GPs of the Danish National Health Service for patients with 
simple overweight [6].  
There is now a vast literature on how the internet can be 
integrated as a consultation tool [5][7][8][9]. For example, 
several studies suggest that interaction over the internet with 
experts in an internet based community is the most effective 
way to lose weight [10][11]. Recent studies suggest that 
online contacts are an economically attractive contact form 
for optimizing guidance on diet and exercise and in keeping 
the patients motivated [12][13][14]. The internet furthermore 
substantially facilitates the use of motivational tools such as 
self-monitoring, which has been used successfully in other 
approaches of internet based weight loss interventions [16].

In Denmark, 86 % of the population has internet access at 
home [15], which makes it possible to reach out to most of 
the patients by online intervention.  
Conventional dietician advice is costly, therefore it is 
important to ensure that resources are being used in the best 
way possible. In Denmark it is now possible to employ 
dieticians in general practice and health care centers. 
However many practices experience difficulties to organize 
the activities in a way that makes it economically feasible to 
offer diet treatment to patients within the rates provided by 
the Danish National Health Service.  
The present paper reports on the methods used and 
results achieved in a preliminary uncontrolled prospective 
survey of weight loss and weight maintenance among obese 
patients, who received advice and support about diet and 
exercise using a personalized interactive internet-based 
dietician advice program in a clinical practice setting. 
 
II. 
METHOD AND SUBJECTS 
A. Patients  
One medical center with primary care participated in the 
study. In May 2008, new patients and patients who were 
already enrolled in weight stabilization courses were offered 
the opportunity to participate. Initially 46 patients attended a 
consultation with a dietician, of which 32 patients agreed to 
participate in the full study and signed the informed consent 
form. Patients then received information on how they could 
log on to the program. Before attending the dietician, the 
patients filled out name, address and e-mail address. The 
study was approved by the South Danish regional committee 
on biomedical ethics.

B. Study design 
The pilot study was designed as an uncontrolled 
prospective survey of the efficacy of using an existing 
commercial weight loss program [17] for obese patients in a 
general practice setting. At the first login, patients filled out a 
comprehensive 16-page medical history with information 
regarding their health, education and medicine intake. 
Completing the forms gave e-access to consultations with a 
dietician and an exercise coach.  
E-access also allowed e-mail chats with the other patients 
participating in the study. 
 During the first week the patients recorded a diet and 
exercise history on a day-to-day basis (see Figure 1). Based 
on these records, the patients received a diet plan, weekly 
advice from a dietitian (see figure 2) as well as an exercise 
plan and advice from an exercise coach once a month. 
Treatment 
principles 
in 
both 
online 
and 
physical 
consultations were based on the Danish Board of Health's 
recommendations from "The 8 dietary guidelines" [6].  
The aim was to enhance the daily intake of vegetables 
and fruits, choose whole-grain options for bread and other 
cereal products, replace products rich in fat with lean 
alternatives and distribute food intake into several smaller 
meals throughout the day. 
The treatment consisted of providing simple and 
manageable guidelines and tools that gave the patients 
substantial freedom in planning their meals while the 
dietitian could supervise and advise each patient individually 
on where improvements could be achieved. Patients who 
according to the dietician’s professional assessment needed 
face-to-face consultation with the dietician during the study 
period, were seen by a dietician in the medical center 2 to 3 
months into the study period. Only one dietitian was 
connected to the project, which means that the patients were 
met by the same dietician at the medical center as online.

The internet tools in the program encouraged the patients 
to record their exact dietary intake on a day-to-day basis, 
enabling the dieticians at the face-to-face consultation to 
focus more on serving the patient’s needs and spend less 
time to simply clarify recent food intake.  The patients could 
also write about any complication or worry that they might 
have during a day, as illustrated in the example in Figure 1. 
Dietary notes and commentaries from the patients were used 
by the dietician, the exercise coach as well as peers (other 
users of the program) to intervene and relate to problems 
when they appeared. 
The patients were supported by their peers on the website 
by using an internet community (presented as ‘forums for 
debate), consisting of all users of the internet based program, 
both the patients enrolled in the study and other users who 
pay for the service privately to lose weight in a non-clinical 
setting. The members of this internet community were 
encouraged to contact each other for support, as seen in the 
example in Figure 3.  
The internet community was very intimate as only 
patients with a weight problem had access. The patients 
could communicate via discussion forums and internet chat 
forums. Communication was also available in specially 
designed inboxes on the website, as comments to food and 
exercise records or via personal pictures.  
To illustrate this we have chosen some typical 
comments from the patients: “I know I don’t use as many 
fiber rich vegetables in my salad as I would like, but there is 
no room when I eat my regular salad that I love…” “…the 
weather makes it difficult for me to exercise because of my 
gout. What can I do?” or “my dog died. I’m so sad…”. The 
dietician would get to know every participant individually, 
and be able to guide them in a way that suited their lifestyle, 
as seen in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 3. Screenshot of participants using the debate forums from the 
internet community.  
Waist and hip measurement, weight and clinical analysis 
values were obtained at baseline and after 4 month initial 
treatment. These assessments were performed by the study 
team at physical consultations, see table 1. The following 
approx. 16 months (maintenance period) most of the patients 
continued to use the program, but only received internet 
consultations when requested by the patient or by the 
dietician, and weight measurements were recorded whenever 
the patients attended the health centers for other reasons.  
Results were analyzed as a one-sample t-test for the 
hypothesis that the weight loss or other change from one 
time point to the next was different from 0. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
The datasets from 22 of the 32 enrolled patients were 
sufficiently complete to be included in the outcome 
calculations. Of the remaining 10 patients, 2 only registered 
starting weight and the remaining 8 never logged on. All 22 
completed the initial treatment period and 21 the 
maintenance treatment. One patient only completed a 12-
month period due to pregnancy; we used the last observation 
carried forward. Baseline data and details of treatment for the 
22 patients who participated in the are given in Table 1.  
The average weight loss after the initial intensive 
treatment period of 115 days (95% CI: 101; 121),was 7.0 kg, 
with a standard error of the mean of 1.1 (95% CI: 4.6, 9.3), 
P<0.001. Nine participants achieved a weight loss of 5-10 kg 
and 4 participants lost more than 10 kg. There were no 
significant correlations between weight loss and duration of 
treatment period or between weight loss and number of 
consultations. Clinical and anthropomorphic data of patients 
enrolled are listed in Table 1. The mean age at inclusion was 
43 years and the mean weight 104 kg with a BMI of 36.4 
kg/m2.

** p<0.001 vs. before related to same sex  
*** Two patients were excluded due to pregnancy and absence; we used last observation carried forward (one after 4 months and one after 10 months) 
 
The mean weight loss from baseline after the 
maintenance period, a total of approx. 20 months, 595 days 
(95% CI: 519; 671), was still 7.0 kg. 15 out of 21 achieved a 
weight loss between 5 and 29 kg. 4 lost between 0.3 and 2.2 
kg, and the last 3 patients gained between 0.1 and 4.7 kg. 
One patient became pregnant and 1 patient was absent for 
the approx. 20 month assessment, they were excluded and 
we used the last observation carried forward. Seventeen out 
of the 21 i.e. 81% of the participants managed to sustain a 
weight loss of more than 1 kg after 20 months.  
The dietician and some of the patients were interviewed 
about their experience with the program. Both parties agreed 
that one of the most important parts of the program was the 
continuity. The dietician was always available over the 
internet, which created an ongoing motivation for lifestyle 
changes instead of a short-term diet change. The patients also 
found that continuous emotional support and practical advice 
from peers had been very important during the study.  
 
Some patients found the internet community equally 
important as the dietician, as illustrated by a comment: “I 
spend most of my time on the internet community, I like to 
see how the others are doing and whether they have the same 
problems as me.”  
Feedback from the doctors and staff in the medical center 
indicated that they were satisfied with the cooperation with 
the dietician. It was seen as a benefit to offer dietician advice 
close to the patients without requiring frequent visits to the 
medical center. The main challenge mentioned by this group 
was the technical integration with the existing e-journal 
system of the Danish National Health Service.  
The total cost of the initial weight loss treatment, 
including the personal (face-to-face) consultations and 
clinical 
assessments, 
was 
estimated 
to 
a 
total 
of 
approximately 35,000DKK. Without the cost of the study 
assessments the cost would have been approximately 25,700 
DKK. This estimate corresponds to 165 DKK (€22) per kg 
weight lost for the treatment provided.

The cost to the Danish National Health Service of an e-mail 
consultation was 49.68DKK, compared with 211.14DKK for 
a consultation in the medical center with the aim of assisting 
the patient to change lifestyle. The average price per patient 
for the 4-month weight loss process in this implementation 
study was 1165 DKK. Data on costs are not available for the 
subsequent maintenance period, but they were substantially 
lower than during the initial treatment period. 
 
IV. 
 DISCUSSION 
In the present study we used a combination of the expertise 
available to a Danish health center with an interactive e-
consultation delivery tool and an internet community to 
accomplish a sustainable weight loss amongst obese Danes. 
Using this method we achieved an average weight loss of 7.0 
kg during the first 4 months, which is comparable to other 
conventional treatments [10]. A maintained average weight 
loss of 7.0 kg after 20 months follow up is a strong indicator 
that this might be a way to efficiently and cost-effectively 
reduce weight for a large population.  However a 
randomized controlled trial would be necessary to determine 
whether the results are reproducible. 
Bennett et al recently reported on a randomized clinical 
trial of another web-based weight loss program in primary 
care in the USA, with a similar study population (baseline 
BMI 34.6 and age 54.4). This study showed a comparable 
efficacy with a 3.05 kg greater weight loss amongst cases 
compared with usual care. The trial period was 12 weeks and 
one of their conclusions was that trials of longer duration are 
necessary [16].  
This study however displayed several differences from 
ours, i.e. they tried to create adherence to the program by 
offering the possibility of winning money and their internet 
program did not include facilitated peer support (online 
community). Since many of the patients used the community 
frequently during our study and found it very beneficial this 
may be an important difference. Also the patients in our 
study corresponded with the same dietician over the internet 
and during the counseling in general practice, in contrast to 
the study of Bennett et al [16], where the program was not 
designed to provide individual counseling. Using the 
patient’s interaction with the community and e-mails from 
the patient, the dietician could follow the patients' progress 
and provide more accurate and effective advice, since she 
had the opportunity to build a greater understanding of every 
individual. Together with the longer weight loss period this 
might be a reason why our study appeared to show a larger 
weight loss, while their results are more significant due to a 
higher number of participants and more relevant due to the 
comparison with a control group. However in combination 
these two studies strongly indicate that as a concept internet 
based weight loss programs can be successful in the short 
term, may be useful in longer term maintenance of weigh 
loss and can be effectively introduced in health care.  
Several studies suggest that keeping the patients in the 
program is as effective as frequent follow-up but cheaper [5]. 
In the present study, the low number of dropouts among 
those who progressed beyond the first week was remarkable; 
according to the patients this was mainly due to the 
community, where they established relationships with other 
patients. The low dropout rate could also be affected by the 
fact that the patients all received advice from the same 
dietician, and she could possibly be very good at keeping the 
patients motivated. It would be interesting to further 
investigate specifically the efficacy of the internet 
community, since the Bennet et al. study showed that the 
more patients were using the internet program, the greater 
their weight loss [16], even though no such correlation was 
found with the small number of participants in the present 
study. Future developments of the program could focus on 
the community and make it more attractive. We may achieve 
greater and in particular more sustained weight loss results if 
we could get the patients more involved in the program 
through the internet community.  
The use of self-monitoring provided by the online 
program had both advantages and disadvantages. The 
patients were able to follow their own progress using the 
website, which can help keep motivation, and the data that 
the patients provided were essential as tools for the dietitian 
to achieve the very cost-effective provision of advice. In 
contrast, the self-reported data could not be used for, 
evaluation of the intervention outcome, due to potential bias 
such as under- or over-estimations or recall bias.  Therefore 
only data from measurements that were carried out at the 
medical center by the dietician or a nurse are presented in the 
present paper. 
Web-based interventions have the disadvantage that the 
participants must be fairly proficient at using the internet and 
have the required writing and reading skills for using the 
program, in addition to the obvious requirement for 
convenient internet access. In our study, 14 patients who 
were offered participation failed to go through the enrollment 
progress, and some of these could be due to lack of computer 
or writing skills.  
Feedback from doctors and secretaries involved in the 
study was very positive. It was agreed that the program could 
potentially help to better utilize the scarce dietician resources 
by decreasing the need for consulting face to face. In relation 
to the implementation in the medical centers, it was 
important that there should be a technical integration that 
makes the internet portal an integrated part of the electronic 
journal system used by the Danish National Health Service. 
Communication between the medical center and dieticians 
could become an integrated part of the doctors daily work 
tool. It is especially necessary to establish a technical 
integration with billing and information exchange, to 
minimize the need for intervention by the other staff at the 
medical center.  
With a total of 500 licensed dieticians in Denmark and 
approximately 50 newly educated every year, faced with the 
needs of 4000 medical centers to provide relevant treatment 
offers to ever increasing numbers of obese patients, the

present pilot trial indicates the potential usefulness of this 
type of effective and economically attractive individual 
internet treatment for the large part of the population in need 
of dietary advice. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The study showed that the internet based interactive weight 
management program may be a cost-effective way to 
produce a significant and sustained weight loss among 
patients with obesity in general practice. The internet can be 
used as a communication tool for lifestyle changes and 
provide a community for the patients to support them to 
maintain weight loss and healthier life style. We have 
developed a protocol for a randomized controlled trial to 
further investigate the efficacy of this weight-loss program in 
a more controlled setting, comparing the intervention with 
usual care [18]. Furthermore, we are working on a 
refinement of the internet platform to record how much each 
of the participants use the internet community, as a tool to 
assess the importance of this feature.
