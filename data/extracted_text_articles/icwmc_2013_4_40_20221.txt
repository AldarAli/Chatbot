Abstract—Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) is considered as a 
technology in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)  
Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) system. In this 
paper, we design and analyze the performance of the 
Coordinated Scheduling/Beamforming (CS/CB) technique, 
which is one major category of CoMP. We perform Monte 
Carlo simulations with a Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) in 
LTE-A. Simulation results show that the proposed CoMP can 
improve Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR), and 
the spectrum efficiency of macrocell and picocell users through 
a graph of the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). From 
these results, we also show significant performance gain when 
we apply various techniques of scheduling and precoding with 
the CoMP.

 INTRODUCTION 
Mobile communication technology has been constantly 
evolving to satisfy the communication market, which 
requires high-speed support for high-capacity and high-
quality. The next generation of wireless communication 
requires a data rate of 100Mbps class for dynamic user 
equipment (UE), and 1Gbps class for static UE. It aims to 
enable high-speed network access using information devices 
anytime, anywhere, through integration of wired and 
wireless communications and broadcasting [1-2]. 
Recently, through the prevalence of smart phones, the 
needs of users for quality anytime, anywhere data services 
have increased rapidly. Techniques that can support high 
data rates to users located within cell edges, as well as cell 
centers, came into demand. A cell center can increase data 
transmission speed, simply by using the support of additional 
antenna ports for each cell. But in the case of a cell edge, it is 
difficult to increase the data rate up to any limitations 
without cooperation, because this location receives too much 
interference from adjacent cells. Also frequency reuse 
techniques being deployed using small cells, such as femto 
cell or pico cell, within the macro cell area can provide high 
speed data services to dense user areas. Accordingly, the 
need for efficient methods to control the interference 
between transfer points is increasing [3]. 
Current standards and academic issues, such as how to 
control the interference from point-to-point transmission 
naming, identify Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP), which 
was selected as a work item for Long Term Evolution-
Advanced (LTE-A) Release 11. 
In the paper, we will discuss the basic techniques of 
CoMP, and the effect of CoMP combined with several 
techniques, through simulation results. As an issue in fourth 
generation mobile communication, the CoMP environment 
in this paper is based on LTE-A systems. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
defines the CoMP basic system model. Section III briefly 
presents the various scheduling and precoding schemes. 
After evaluating the performance of the proposed schemes in 
Section IV, we conclude the paper in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) is one of the LTE-
A system networks. HetNet complying with the LTE-A 
Release 11 Scenario 4 is discussed as follows [4].  
As shown in Figure 1 (a), it is assumed that a macro cell 
is divided into three sectors. Three adjacent sectors consist of 
one cell site, and communication is coordinated. In Figure 1 
(b), pico cells exist in a macro cell, and communication is 
coordinated with the macro cell. Users are uniformly and 
randomly distributed in each macro cell and pico cell [4-5]. 
In the conventional cellular system, users receive a signal 
from each anchor cell with interference signals from adjacent 
cells. We assume that user Mj is locates randomly in Cj and 
receives signals from three cells (denoted as C1, C2 and C3) 
[6]. Assume Hij is the channel gain from Ci to Mj. The 
received signal Y1 at M1 can be expressed as 
(1) 
 
where Xi is the signal transmitted at Ci, Wi is the precoding 
matrix at Ci, and N is the additive white Gaussian noise at 
M1.  
As shown in the expression, Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) 
occurs, and the channel capacity is limited, according to the 
signal from an adjacent cell being considered as an 
interference signal. The following expression for C1 is

located within the user’s Signal to Interference plus Noise 
Ratio (SINR).  
 
 
Figure 1. Structure of the HetNet complying with the LTE-A Release 11 
Scenario 4: (a) Macro only, (b) Macro and Pico. 
 
If one user receives a signal from its own serving cell, the 
signals from the other cells affect the user as interference, 
and then the SINR of M1 can be expressed as 
 
(2) 
 
CoMP technology can control the interference among 
neighboring cells through cooperative communication 
technology, which is a promising 4G cellular standard being 
developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)  
standardization group. CoMP can improve the coverage, 
cell-edge capacity and/or system efficiency. For downlink 
CoMP, two different approaches are being considered, 
namely, 
Joint 
Processing 
(JP) 
and 
Coordinated 
Scheduling/Beamforming (CS/CB) in 3GPP LTE-A standard 
[4]. 
The SINR for a user that is located within C1 in the 
CoMP JP scheme can be formulated as 
  
(3) 
 
From the above expression, you can see that the 
interference signal from the neighboring cells also provides a 
useful signal through the cooperation among multiple cells, 
where only noise interferes with the signal. 
The received signal at the user within each cell in the 
CoMP CS/CB scheme can be expressed as 
 
(4) 
 
 
(5) 
 
 
(6) 
 
We measure the SINR for each cell by the above 
expressions, by the precoding matrix that has the highest 
SINR applied to each cell. As a result, the interference 
coming from the surrounding cell is minimized, and the 
received signal strength can be maximized. In this case, the 
precoding matrix is expressed as follows. 
 
(7) 
 
 
(8) 
 
 
(9) 
 
We perform simulations using CoMP CS/CB, which 
shows a tradeoff between performance and complexity, and 
which is the best parameter, compared with other schemes. 
 
III. 
SCHEDULING AND PRECODING TECHNIQUES 
In this section, scheduling and precoding techniques are 
proposed as a way to improve the performance of CoMP. 
Each technique is described below. 
A. Scheduling 
We suggest a scheduling scheme to improve the CoMP 
performance 
through 
using 
scheduling, 
as 
Flexible 
Frequency Allocation Plan (FFAP) and Coordinated 
Scheduling (CS) schemes are used. 
The FFAP scheme suggests that the whole frequency 
band be divided into two parts: a CoMP frequency zone for 
the cell-edge user (CEU)’s transmission, and a single sector 
frequency band for the cell-center user (CCU)’s transmission, 
as shown in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. Structure of the CoMP FFAP scheme. 
 
The differentiation between CEUs and CCUs can be 
made based on the received SINR at the UE. 
 (10) 
where  is a predetermined threshold in dB. 
The CS scheme is a way in which all users that exist in 
one cell can be distinguished into CCU or CEU and then, the 
sum of highest priority of CCU for each sector in one cell 
and the highest priority of CEU in one cell are compared. 
The priority is based on the received SINR. 
If the CEU’s priority is higher, the system will be 
calculated based on the CoMP mode. Otherwise, CCUs are 
calculated based on the Non-CoMP mode. In this mode, we 
send a signal to users using the common transmission 
    
            
                             
    
            
                             
    
            
                             
            √        √        √

method. The flow chart for the CS scheme is shown in 
Figure 3 [7]. 
 
 
Figure 3. Flow Chart of the CoMP CS scheme. 
B. Precoding 
A precoding scheme is another way to improve the 
performance of CoMP. Precoding is a technique to increase 
the SINR and spectrum efficiency of a signal, by multiplying 
a specific matrix with the channel in the transmitter. Singular 
Value Decomposition (SVD), Polar Decomposition (PD), 
Tomlinson 
Harashima 
Precoding 
(THP) 
and 
QR 
Decomposition (QRD) schemes are used as precoding 
techniques. 
Using the SVD scheme, the channel is separated in 
parallel, by multiplying an orthogonal matrix U and V. The 
basic equation for the channel matrix H and the precoding 
matrix W are expressed as 
(11) 
 
Using the PD scheme, the channel is separated, based on 
the SVD scheme. The channel matrix H and the precoding 
matrix W are expressed as follows. 
 
(12) 
 
 
The THP scheme is a nonlinear precoding based on 
Costa’s “writing on dirty paper result” information theory [8]. 
In other words, if the transmitter knows the interference 
signal beforehand, it can get the same channel capacity as the 
non-interference 
channel 
condition. 
THP 
precoding 
additionally uses modulo operation, which is symmetric 
nonlinear operation based on costa’s precoding. The modulo 
operation is given as 
  
(13) 
 
A block diagram of this technique is shown in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Block Diagram of THP precoding scheme. 
 
QRD scheme creates the precoding matrix through QR 
decomposition, which factorizes the channel matrix. The 
basic equations for the channel matrix H and the precoding 
matrix W are given as  
 
 (14) 
 
IV. 
SIMULATION PARAMETERS AND RESULTS 
We confirm the performance gain according to the use of 
CoMP technique in heterogeneous network scenario in LTE-
A system. In addition, the performance gain for the 
scheduling and precoding with CoMP techniques will be 
confirmed. We use Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) 
to analyze the SINR and spectrum efficiency. 
A. Simulation Environments 
The simulation environment follows the 3GPP LTE-A 
standard. We perform system-level simulations using Matlab, 
based on the parameters of Table 1 [9]. We assume that three 
pico cells exist within one macro cell, and are located in the 
edge site of the macro cell.

B. Simulation Results 
Using Non-CoMP scheme as a baseline for evaluating 
the performance of the proposed scheme, we send a signal to 
users. 
 
1) CoMP simulation with Scheduling 
 
The CDF graphs of the SINR are shown when we apply 
two kinds of scheduling techniques to CoMP in Figures 5 
and 6, respectively. Figure 5 is for a Macro UE, which is for 
a macro cell when communication is coordinated among 
macro cells. Figure 6 is for a Pico UE, which if for a pico 
cell when communication is coordinated among macro cell 
and pico cell.  
From these figures, we can find that using the scheduling 
(FFAP or CS) with CoMP brings a performance gain, 
compared with the non-CoMP. Especially the CS with 
CoMP can be seen to provide the highest contribution 
towards improving the performance. 
The CDF graphs of spectrum efficiency are shown when 
we apply two kinds of scheduling techniques to CoMP as in 
Figures 7 and 8, respectively. Figure 7 is for Macro UE, 
when communication is coordinated among macro cells. 
Figure 8 is for Pico UE when communication is coordinated 
among macro cell and pico cell.  
From these figures, we can find that using the scheduling 
with CoMP brings a performance gain, compared to with 
non-CoMP. CS with CoMP can be seen to offer the highest 
contribution to improve the performance.  
Also, in the case of Pico UE, the overall performance is 
better than in the case of Macro UE, because the pico cell is 
located at the edge of the macro cell.

Here, the CDF graphs of SINR are shown when we apply 
various precoding techniques to CoMP, in Figures 9 and 10, 
respectively. 
Figure

is 
for 
Macro 
UE, 
when 
communication is coordinated among macro cells. Figure 10 
is for Pico UE, when communication is coordinated among 
macro cell and pico cell.  
From these figures, we can find that using SVD 
precoding with CoMP brings a performance gain, compared 
to PD, THP and QRD schemes. 
The CDF graphs of spectrum efficiency are shown when 
we apply various precoding techniques to CoMP, in Figures 
11 and 12, respectively. Figure 11 is for Macro UE, when 
communication is coordinated among macro cells. Figure 12 
is for Pico UE when communication is coordinated among 
macro cell and pico cell.  
From these figures, we can find that using SVD 
precoding with CoMP brings a performance gain, compared 
to PD, THP and QRD schemes. 
Also, the performance of the Pico UE is better than the 
Macro UE case.

CONCLUSIONS 
We demonstrate a performance analysis of CoMP 
technique, for multi-point cooperation among users for next-
generation cellular systems. System-level simulation results 
are based on HetNet in the LTE-A system. 
We compare and analyze the performance according to 
the CoMP technique applied, in two cases; one is among 
only macro cells, the other is among macro cell and pico cell. 
In both cases, we can get an improved performance when 
using CoMP technique. It is also shown that CoMP 
techniques combined with scheduling and precoding 
achieved further improvement of performance. 
As a result, we confirm that CoMP technology can be 
applied to HetNet, which has pico cells within a macro cell 
in the LTE-A system.
