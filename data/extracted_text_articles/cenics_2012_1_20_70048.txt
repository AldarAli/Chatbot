Abstract—In this paper we present novel ultra-low-voltage
and high-speed CMOS NAND and NOR gates. For supply
voltages below 500mV
the delay for an ultra-low-voltage
NAND2 gate is approximately 10% of a complementary CMOS
inverter. Furthermore, the delay variations due to mismatch
are much lesser than for conventional CMOS. Differential
domino gates for AND2/NAND2 and OR2/NOR2 operation
are presented. Ultra-low-voltage pass transistors are presented
which can be used as latching gates. The ultra-low-voltage
gates presented are going to be used for implementation of
low-voltage and high speed adders.

I. INTRODUCTION
The aggressive scaling of device dimensions to achieve
greater transistor density and circuit speed results in substan-
tial subthreshold and gate oxide tunneling leakage currents.
Energy efﬁciency is one of the most required features for
modern electronic systems designed for high-performance
and/or portable applications. In recent years, the power
problem has emerged as one of the fundamental limits
facing the future of CMOS integrated circuit design. On
one hand, the ever increasing market segment of portable
electronic devices demands the availability of low-power
building blocks that enable the implementation of long-
lasting battery-operated systems. On the other hand, the
general trend of increasing operating frequencies and circuit
complexity, in order to cope with the throughput needed in
modern high-performance processing applications, requires
the design of very-high-speed circuits.
Depending upon the application, there are numerous
methods that can be used to reduce the power consump-
tion of VLSI circuits [1], [2], these can range from low-
level measures based upon fundamental physics, such as
using a lower power supply voltage or using high-threshold
voltage transistors; to high-level measures such as clock-
gating or power-down modes. The power consumption in
digital circuits, which mostly use complementary metal-
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices, is proportional to
the square of the power supply voltage; therefore, voltage
scaling is one of the important methods used to reduce
power consumption. In order to achieve a high transistor
drive current and thereby improve the circuit performance,
the transistor threshold voltage Vt must be scaled down in
proportion to the supply voltage. However, a decrease in the
transistor threshold voltage Vt results in signiﬁcant increase
in the subthreshold leakage current.
Floating-Gate (FG) gates have been proposed for Ultra-
Low-Voltage (ULV) and Low-Power (LP) logic [3]. How-
ever, in modern CMOS technologies there are signiﬁcant
gate leakages which undermine non-volatile FG circuits.
FG gates implemented in a modern CMOS process require
frequent initialization to avoid signiﬁcant leakage. By using
ﬂoating capacitances, either poly-poly, MOS or metal-metal,
to the transistor gate terminals the semi-ﬂoating-gate (SFG)
nodes can have a different DC level than provided by the
supply voltage headroom [3]. There are several approaches
to FG CMOS logic [4], [5]. The gates proposed in this paper
are inﬂuenced by ULV non-volatile FG circuits[5].
In this paper we focus on implementation of low-voltage
and high-speed Boolean gates. In section II an extended
description of the ULV inverter [6] is given. In section III
ULV NOR and NAND gates are presented and ULV latching
pass transistors ate described in section IV. Alternative
implementations for Boolean gates are presented in section
V and a conclusion is given in section VI.
II. ULTRA-LOW-VOLTAGE SEMI-FLOATING-GATE LOGIC
The ULV logic styles presented in this paper are related
to the ULV domino logic style presented in [6]. The main
purpose of the ULV logic style is to increase the current level
for low supply voltages without increasing the transistor
widths. We may increase the current level compared to
complementary CMOS using different initialization voltages
to the gates and applying capacitive inputs. The extra loads
represented by the ﬂoating capacitors are lesser than extra
load given by increased transistor widths. The capacitive
inputs lower the delay through increased transconductance
while increased transistor widths only reduce parasitic delay.
The simple dynamic edge and level ULV inverters [6] are
shown in Figure 1. In order to retain a logic 1 a) when the
input remain at logic 0 the width of the pMOS precharge
transistor Ep is 4 times the minimum width while the nMOS
evaluate transistor has minimum width. The width of the
pMOS evaluate transistor in b) is 2 times minimum and the

ULV domino gates in this report are ratioed logic and the
size of the precharge transistors may be increased to secure
required robustness or noise margin. The time constant of a
false falling or rising voltage is however always signiﬁcantly
larger than the time constant for an active output edge, i.e.
the problem will only be evident in very long domino chains.

characterized by:
• Recharge. The precharge and recharge phase starts
when φ switches from 0 to 1. The recharge transistors,
labeled R, are turned ON and will recharge the gate of
the evaluating transistors labeled E. More speciﬁcally,
the gate of the nMOS evaluating transistors will be
forced to VDD and the gate of the pMOS evaluating
transistors will be recharged to gnd.
• Precharge. φ = 1. The output of the inverter in Figure
1 will be driven to VDD or 1 and the inverter in b) will
be precharged to 0.
• Evaluate. In the evaluation phase, determined by φ =
0, the recharge transistors are turned OFF and the gate
of the evaluating transistors are temporarily ﬂoating
allowing an input transition to affect the current running
through the transistors.
The ULV logic styles may be used in critical subcircuits
where high-speed and low supply voltage is required. The
ULV logic styles may be used together with more conven-
tional CMOS logic. A ULV high speed serial carry chain [7]
has been presented using a simple dynamic ULV logic [8]. In
this paper we exploit an NP domino ULV static differential
logic style.
We deﬁne a signal D precharged to 0 as 0D and a signal
precharged to 1 as 1D. We Apply a clock signal to power
the inverter, i.e. either φ to En and VDD to Ep, or φ to Ep
and GND to En and precharge to 1 or 0 respectively. The
gate resembles NP, i.e. precharge to 0 and precharge to 1,
domino logic. In order to hold the precharged value until
an input transition arrives the E transistor connected to a
supply voltage is made stronger than the other E transistor.
The function of the inverter can be described as 0D → 1D
and 1D → 0D.

CMOS inverter are shown in Figure 2. For supply voltages
in the region from 200 to 400 the delays of the different
ULV logic styles presented are less than 8% of standard
CMOS delay. The main target for the logic style presented
is 300mV which will yield 96% delay reduction compared
to standard CMOS. A typical application for the ULV logic
styles are low voltage serial adders. For a supply voltage
equal to 300mV we may apply a 32-bit carry chain using
the ULV logic with the same delay as a one-bit standard
CMOS carry gate. Delay for different ULV inverters relative
to complementary CMOS inverter are shown in Figure 2.
The delay improvement is more signiﬁcant for the proposed
ULV inverters than for the original ULV inverters for supply
voltages below 320mV due to reduced capacitive load.
The ULV logic style is deﬁned by the applied terminal
inputs as shown in TABLE I. The ON and OFF currents of
a complementary CMOS inverter is given by the effective
gate source voltages VDD and 0V respectively. Assuming
Cin
CT
= 0.5 where CT is the total capacitance seen by a
ﬂoating gate, we may estimate the delay, dynamic and static
power and noise margins of the different ULV logic styles
relative to a complementary CMOS inverter.
Monte Carlo simulation is performed including process
mismatch and the results in terms of delay variations are
shown in Figure 3. For the ULV logic style the mismatch
of the clock drivers (standard CMOS inverters) are included.
The delay variations of the clock drivers will be equal to the
standard CMOS inverters which is signiﬁcantly larger than
the ULV inverters. Hence, the delay variations of the clock
drivers will not affect the delay variations signiﬁcantly.

The ULV domino NOR2 gate is shown in Figure 4. The
function is deﬁned by 1O = 0A +0 B and reveals a Boolean
NOR2 function. The function can be deﬁned in terms of

input edges the output will provide an edge. In order to retain
a logic 1 when both inputs remain at logic 0 the width of
the pMOS precharge transistor Ep is 8 times the minimum
width. The increased width of the precharge transistor and
the added parallel evaluate transistor will increase the delay
by close to a factor 2 compared to an ULV domino inverter.
The worst case scenario is when one and only one of the
inputs 0A or 0B switches to 1 and the other remains at 0.

ULV latching pass transistors.
Precharge pass transistors are shown in Figure 6. The
circuits can be used in ULV latches and Flip-Flops. The
evaluate transistors En1 and Ep2 are powered by the input
signals 1D and 0D, and the inputs signals are pushed to the
output by the clock (edge) φ and φ. The delay from the input
to the output of the pass transistor gate is less than for an
inverter. By using a combination of the ULV domino inverter
and the ULV pass transistor we can implement different
Boolean functions.
V. ALTERNATIVE BOOLEAN CIRCUITS
In this section we employ both ULV domino inverters
and ULV pass transistors. The Boolean functions are imple-
mented using two ore more stages. Furthermore, the Boolean
function of the gates can be deﬁned in terms of standard
Boolean logic levels or in terms of signal edges.
By using the evaluate transistor both as an inverting device
and a pass transistor as shown in Figure 7 the ULV gates
can be used as AND and OR gates. The Boolean function
of the OR gate on the left is 1O =1 A +1 B. We assume
that 0A is generated by an ULV domino inverter as shown
in Figure 1 b). The OR gate provide a Boolean OR function.

The function can also be deﬁned in terms of edges. In this
context the function is AND, i.e. an output transition will
occur if and only if both input provide edges. For the AND
gate on the left the function is given by 0O =0 A0B. In the
edge context the function is still AND.

are slightly different than the previous gates. Both inputs

prevent draining current from the gates providing the input
signals. These gates will be more symmetrical in terms of
delay from each input to the output. The delay from the
inputs to the output of the gates shown in 7 are different,
i.e. the delay from the inputs 0B and 1B are signiﬁcantly
less than from the 0A and 1A. This asymetrical property
is helpful when the delay for the inputs is different due to
different signal paths. If the gate is used in a carry chain the
carry signal should be provided through a pass transistor as
shown in 7.
Capacitive load and relative delay compared to a standard
CMOS inverter for the different gates proposed are presented
in Table II. The delay of the ULV domino inverter is lesser
than 4% compared a CMOS inverter for supply voltages less

pass transistor is less than for the ULV domino inverter. The
different implementations of the Boolean gates are equal in
terms of delay and close to two times the delay of the ULV
domino inverter.
VI. CONCLUSION
Different ultra-low-voltage domino NAND and NOR
gates have been presented. The ULV two-input domino
Boolean gates are high-speed, i.e. the delay compared to
a CMOS inverter is less than 10%. The delay variation of
the ULV gates due to process mismatches is much less than
for a CMOS inverter operating at the same supply voltage.
The ultra-low-voltage gates presented are going to be used to
implement low-voltage and high-speed adders. Preliminary
results show that the delay for the ULV NAND2 and NOR2
gates are less than 10% of the delay for a complementary
CMOS inverter for ultra low supply voltages.
