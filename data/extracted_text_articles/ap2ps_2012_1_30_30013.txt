Abstract—This work proposes a scheme for sharing resources using 
the opportunistic networking paradigm whereas, it enables Energy 
Conservation (EC) by allocating Real-Time Traffic-based dissimilar 
Sleep/Wake schedules to wireless devices. The scheme considers the 
resource sharing process which, according to the duration of the 
traffic through the associated channel, it impacts the Sleep-time 
duration of the node. The paper examines the traffic’s backward 
difference in order to define the next Sleep-time duration for each 
node. The proposed scheme is being evaluated through Real-Time 
implementation by using dynamically moving MICA2dot wireless 
nodes which, are exchanging resources in a Mobile Peer-to-Peer 
manner. Various performance metrics were considered for the 
thorough evaluation of the proposed scheme. Results have shown 
the scheme’s efficiency for enabling EC and provide a schematic 
way for minimizing the Energy Consumption in Real-Time, in 
contrast to the delay variations between packets; whereas the 
proposed scheme aims at maximizing the efficiency of resource 
exchange between mobile peers.

 INTRODUCTION 
As wireless nodes communicate over error-prone wireless 
channels with limited battery power, reliable and energy-efficient 
data delivery is crucial. These characteristics of wireless nodes 
make the design of resource exchange schemes challenging [1]. 
Due to the fact that wireless devices in order to conserve energy 
switch their states between Sleep mode, Wake mode and Idle 
mode, the responsiveness of these devices is reduced 
significantly. These devices, while being in the process of sharing 
resources, face temporary and unannounced loss of network 
connectivity as they move, whereas, they are usually engaged in 
rather short connection sessions since they need to discover other 
hosts in an ad-hoc manner. In most cases the requested resources 
claimed by these devices, may not be available. Therefore, a 
mechanism that faces the intermittent connectivity problem and 
enables the devices to react to frequent changes in the 
environment, while it enables energy conservation in regards to 
the requested traversed traffic, is of great need. This mechanism 
will positively affect the end-to-end reliability, facing the 
unavailability and the scarceness of wireless resources.  
This work proposes a backward estimation model for 
extracting the time-oriented differential traffic in contrast to the 
resource capacity characteristics in order to offer Energy 
Conservation and availability of the requested resources. The 
proposed scheme uses the cached mechanism for guaranteeing 
the requested resources and the monitored traffic that traverses 
the nodes, both as input (basis for estimating the next sleep time 
duration of each node). This mechanism follows the introduced 
Backward Traffic Difference (BTD) scheme. The designed model 
guarantees the end-to-end availability of requested resources 
while it reduces significantly the Energy Consumption and 
maintains the requested scheduled transfers, in a mobility-
enabled cluster-based communication. The innovative aspect of 
this work is that each node uses different assignment(s) of 
sleep-wake schedule estimation, based on the traffic difference 
through time. The Sleep-time duration is assigned according to 
the scheme in a dissimilar form to enhance node prolonged 
hibernation (where needed), whereas it avoids mutation which, 
will result in network partitioning and resource sharing losses. 
Real-Time experiments using various newly introduced metrics’ 
estimations, were carried-out for the energy conservation and the 
evaluation of the proposed model. The scheme takes into account 
a number of metrics hosted by the proposed scheme, as well as 
estimation of the effects of incrementing the sleep time duration 
to conserve energy. Likewise, the Real-Time experiments show 
that different types of traffic can be supported where the 
adaptability and the robustness that is exhibited, is mitigated 
according to the proposed scheme’s Sleep-time estimations and 
assignments.  
The structure of this work is as follows: Section II describes 
the related work done and the need in adopting a Traffic-based 
scheme, and then Section III follows presenting the proposed 
Backward Traffic Difference Estimation for Energy Conservation 
for Mobile opportunistic resource sharing. Section IV presents 
the real time performance evaluation results focusing on the 
behavioral characteristics of the scheme and the Backward 
Traffic Difference along with the system’s response, followed by 
Section V with the conclusions and foundations, as well as 
potential future directions.

The 1-hop neighbor node (Node(i-1)) is selected to cache the 
packets destined for the node with turned off interfaces (sleep 
state). The principle illustrated in Figure 2 denotes that, when 
incoming traffic is in action for a specific node then the node 
remains active for prolonged time. As a showcase this work takes 
the specifications of the IEEE 802.11x that are recommending the 
duration of the forwarding mechanism that takes place in a non-
power saving mode lays in the interval 1 nsec < τ <1 psec. This 
means that every ~0.125µsec (8 times in a msec) the 
communication triggering action between nodes may result a 
problematic end-to-end accuracy. Adaptive Dynamic Caching [2] 
takes place and enables the packets to be “cached” in the 1-hop 
neighboring nodes. Correspondingly, if node is no-longer 
available due to sleep-state in order to conserve energy (in the 
interval slot T=0.125µsec), then the packets are cached into an 
intermediate 
node

t is the needed 
capacity where i is the destination node and k  is the buffering 
node (a hop before the destination via different paths). 
As this scheme is entirely based on the aggregated self-
similarity nature of the incoming traffic with reference to a 
certain node, there should be an evaluation scheme in order to 
enable the node to Sleep, less or more according to the previous 
activity moments. This means that, as more as the cached traffic 
is, there is an increase in the sleep-time duration of the next 
moment for the destination node. This is indicated in the 
following scheme which, takes into account the Self-Similarity to 
estimate the potential spikes of the Sleep-time duration. The 
Sleep-time in turn decreases or increases accordingly, based on 
the active Traffic destined for Node(i) while being in the Sleep-
state.

IV. 
REAL TIME PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ANALYSIS, 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed BTD approach by using the MICA2 sensors nodes [20]. 
Nodes are configured to be manipulated as Peer devices hosting 
the proposed BTD scheme. These sensors were equipped with the 
MTS310 sensor boards. The MICA2 features a low power 
processor and a radio module operating at 868/916 MHz enabling 
data transmission at 38.4Kbits/s with an outdoor range of 
maximum set to 50 meters-taking no fading obstacles in-between 
for better and clearer signal strength. The TinyOS operating 
system is hosted onto MICA2 using the Nested C (NesC) 
language. A dynamic topology with the mobility expressed in 
Section IV.A is implemented, where the BTD scheme assigns the 
Traffic-oriented Sleep and Wake durations. In the evaluation of 
the proposed scheme we took into account the signal strength 
measures as developed in [2] and [3] and the minimized ping 
delays between the nodes in the end-to-end path. The underlying 
communication supports the Cluster-based Routing Protocol 
(CRP) [21]. A common look-up application is being developed to 
enable users to share resources on-the-move which, are available 
by peers for sharing. This application hosts files of different sizes 
that are requested by peers in an opportunistic manner.  
A. Mobility Model used for mobile peers 
In the proposed scenario the new speed and direction are both 
chosen from predefined ranges, [vmin, vmax] and [0, 2π), 
respectively [17] and [18]. The new speed and direction are 
maintained for an arbitrary length of time, randomly chosen from 
(0, tmax]. At the end of the chosen time, the node makes a 
memoryless decision of a new random speed and direction. The 
movements are expressed as a Fractional Random Walk (FRW) 
on a Weighted Graph [22].  
B. Real-time performance testing and evaluation using the 
MICA2 sensors equipped with the MTS310 sensor boards 
In this section, we present the results extracted after 
conducting the real time evaluation runs of the proposed scenario. 
In the utilized scenario we have used 30 nodes with each link 
(frequency channel) having max speed reaching data transmission 
at 38.4Kbits/s. The wireless network is organized in 6 
overlapping clusters which, may vary in time in the active 
number of the nodes. Each source node transmits one 512-bytes 
(~4Kbits-light traffic) packet asynchronously and randomly each 
node selects a destination. The speed of each device can be 
measured with the resultant direction unit vector [3] and the 
speed. Each device has an asymmetrical storage capacity 
compared with the storages of the peer devices. The range of the 
capacities for which devices are supported are in the interval 
1MB to 20MB.  
Figure 4 shows the fraction of the remaining Energy through 
time in contrast to the comparison and evaluation extracted for 
different schemes during the real-time experimentation. As all 
schemes aim to reduce the Energy consumption, the proposed 
scheme behaves satisfactorily in contrast to the scheme 
developed in [6]. Figure 5 shows the Successful packet Delivery 
Ratio (SDR) in regards to the simultaneous requests in the intra-
cluster communicating path, for both statically located nodes (no 
movement) and mobile nodes. Figure 6 shows the Average

experiments for the [23] and for the periodic Sleep/Wake scheduling.

CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH 
This work considers the BTD scheme hosted on wireless 
nodes during the resource exchange process. This research 
proposes and examines a backward estimation model for 
allocating -upon estimation- the time-duration that a node is 
allowed to sleep (according to the traversed traffic) so that it 
conserves Energy. The scheme uses the cached mechanism for 
guaranteeing the requested resources and a model for the Sleep 
time estimation based on the incoming Traffic that traverses the 
nodes. According to the Real-Time results extracted, the designed 
model guarantees the end-to-end availability of requested 
resources while it reduces significantly the Energy Consumption, 
while it maintains the requested scheduled transfers. Performance 
evaluation and the results extracted in Real-Time show that this 
method uses optimally the network’s and system’s resources in 
terms of capacity and EC and offers high SDRs particularly in 
contrast with other similar existing Energy-efficient methods. 
Next steps and on-going work within the current research context 
will be the expansion of this model into a Multi-level Markov 
Fractality Model so that it associates the different moments of the 
Traffic activity and it will be able to extract the Sleep-time 
estimations for the nodes, in order to enable them to conserve 
Energy, while maintaining the resource sharing process on-the-
move.
