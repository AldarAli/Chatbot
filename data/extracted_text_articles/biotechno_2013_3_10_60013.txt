Abstract—It is well-known that crossover formation events
on a chromosome interfere with each other during meiosis, and
this interference affects the distribution of genetic exchanges
on a chromosome in sexual reproduction. However, due to
the technical difﬁculties, it is unknown if meiotic double
strand break (DSB) formation, the initiating event of meiotic
recombination, shows interference. We discuss a method that
employs probability theory of survival analysis in conjunction
with: chromosome fragment distribution, detected by Southern
blotting; and genome-wide DSB intensity maps, obtained by
microarray analysis. We show that this method is a promising
tool to analyse DSB interference.

I. INTRODUCTION
Meiosis is a specialized cell cycle essential for producing
gametes in sexual reproduction [1]. During meiosis, DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) are programmed to be formed
and induce homologous recombination. The homologous
recombination mechanism facilitates recognition of homol-
ogous chromosomes and establishes physical connections
between them via crossovers. The study of meiotic DSB
formation and homologous recombination is important be-
cause these events are not only central to the life cycle of
sexually reproducing organisms, but they are also a driving
force for the production of genetic diversity.
Crossover interference is a phenomenon that is known
to inﬂuence the distribution of crossovers such that the
presence of a crossover reduces the likelihood of another
crossover forming nearby [2]–[4]. However, it is not known
if there is a similar interference mechanism operating at the
level of DSB formation, since unlike the case of crossovers,
DSB interference can not be observed directly [2].
The formation of meiotic DSBs and crossovers is con-
trolled by many complex biological processes and the mech-
anism has been intensively studied using various methods
[5]–[7]. There are two popular ways to analyse DSB forma-
tion: Southern blotting and whole genome mapping obtained
by microarray analysis. Both methods fall short of analysing
potential DSB interference, but by combining both methods
we can analyze the strength of DSB interference. Recently,
by assuming that there is no strong DSB interference, we
derived an algorithm to estimate the number of DSBs from
the experimental results of Southern blotting [8]. In this
paper, we show that, by reversing the logic, we can check
for the presence of DSB interference. In a large part of
past linkage analysis, genetic recombination, which is the
consequence of DSB formation, has been assumed to be
a non-homogenous Poisson process [3], [9]. In the context
of survival analysis with the partial observation, the non
parametric Nelson-Aalen estimator has been intensively used
to estimate the cumulative hazard rate from censored data
[10]–[12]. By simply comparing the two DSB intensities, the
one obtained from microarray analysis and the other based
on the Nelson-Aalen estimator, which will coincide if DSB
formation follows a non-homogenous Poisson process, we
can analyze the DSB interference on a chromosome.
II. SOUTHERN BLOTTING AND WHOLE GENOME
MAPPING BY MICROARRAY ANALYSIS
A. Southern Blotting and Distribution Function of First
Break
A common molecular biology technique called Southern
blotting (see Fig. 1) enables detection of one unique lo-
cation in the genome, making it possible to examine DSB
formation per given chromosome. DSB formation can then
be studied in mutants of interest, such as those that form
but do not repair DSBs [13], [14]. In Southern blotting,
the total genomic DNA prepared from cells introduced into
meiosis is separated according to size by gel electrophoresis.
The separated DNA molecules are then transferred to a
nylon membrane on which broken chromosome fragments
carrying one end of a chromosome to be examined are
probed with a radioactive oligonucleotide. Thus, when a
chromosome is intact (i.e., no DSBs are formed), only a
single band appears at the location corresponding to the
size of the whole chromosome. Once DSBs are formed,
chromosomal DNA is broken and smaller molecular pieces
appear accordingly, producing numerous bands below the
position of the intact chromosome. Although this method
is suitable for determining the location of DSBs along
chromosomes, the strength of the signal at a given location

An example of DSB detection by Southern blotting. Mutant
budding yeast diploid cells (the sae2 mutant) were introduced into meiosis
and cells were harvested at 10 and 12 hours after introduction into meiosis.
The Southern blotting was used to detect chromosome IV. Lane proﬁles of
10 and 12 hours in each mutant background were normalized and averaged
to obtain the proﬁles shown on the right [13], [14]. This ﬁgure is adopted
from [8].
does not necessarily correlate with the actual number of
DSBs formed there. This is because, when two or more
DSBs are formed on a chromosome, only the DNA fragment
carrying the chromosome end hybridised to the probe is
detected, while others are invisible. In other words, we can
only detect the ﬁrst DSB from one end of the chromosome
using this approach.
Let T1 be the size of the ﬁrst DSB from the left end of
a chromosome. Deﬁne the probability distribution of T1 as
F(x) = P{T1 ≤ x}, which is assumed to be continuous and
differentiable for simplicity. Here, the probability measure
P can be regarded as the sample ratio of Southern blotting.
Thus, by using these sample ratio values obtained from
Southern blot analysis, we can estimate the distribution
F(x).
B. Microarray Analysis and DSB intensity
DSBs formed during meiosis are exonucleolytically res-
sected from their ends, producing 3’-ended single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA). These ssDNA molecules can be selectively
recovered by using Benzoyl naphthoyl DEAE (BND) cel-
lulose. Based on microarray analysis of break-associated
ssDNA isolated by BND cellulose enrichment, the intensity
and distribution of meiotic DSBs were measured [15].
Let t be the position from left end point on a chromosome
and N(t) be the number of breaks in this region (0, t). The
intensity of DSBs is deﬁned by
λ(t) = lim
∆t→0
E[N(t + ∆t) − N(t)]
∆t
,
(1)
where the expectation can be regarded as the sample aver-
ages of the signal obtained from the microarray analysis.
This method is very effective and precise about the location
of DSBs, and is used to locate the hot spots and cold spots on
chromosomes. However, this analysis cannot reveal which
DSBs occurred on a particular chromosome, thus we cannot
test for DSB interference.
III. INTERFERENCE FUNCTION AND HAZARD RATE
FUNCTION
Interference is often measured by the coincidence function
[3], [9]. Let E(t1, t2) be the event that a break is in the
interval [t1, t2) on a chromosome. The coincidence function
is then deﬁned by
c(s, t) =
P{E[s, s + ∆t], E[t, t + ∆t]}
P{E[s, s + ∆t]}P{E[t, t + ∆t]},
(2)
for some small positive ∆t. The formation of DSBs is said
to have positive interference when a break constrains the
formation of other breaks. Thus, P{E[s, s + ∆t], E[t, t +
∆t]} is smaller than the product probability P{E[s, s +
∆t]}P{E[t, t + ∆t]} and c(s, t)
<
1. If there is no
interference and any two breaks occur independently, the
numerator and denominator of (2) coincide, and c(s, t) = 1.
It is well-known that, in the case of crossovers, c(s, t) < 1
and there is positive interference among crossovers.
However, the coincidence function is not useful for
analysing DSB interference, because neither Southern blot-
ting nor whole genome mapping can identify two breaks
occurring on a single chromosome. Hence, P{E[s, s +
∆t], E[t, t + ∆t]} cannot be estimated.
Here, we propose a similar but different indicator for DSB
interference based on the intensity of DSBs and the hazard
rate function of the ﬁrst break. Let h(x) be the hazard rate
function of the ﬁrst break T1, which is deﬁned as
h(x)dx = P{x ≤ T1 < x + dx|T1 ≥ x} =
f(x)dx
1 − F(x), (3)
where f(x) = dF(x)/dx is the density of the random
variable T1. We deﬁne a new function ˜c(t) by
˜c(t) = h(t)
λ(t) =
f(t)
λ(t)(1 − F(t)).
(4)
Roughly speaking, the coincidence function c(s, t) measures
the tendency of double breaks around t and s, while ˜c(t)
measures the tendency of breaks at the position t given
no breaks in [0, t). When DSB formation shows positive
interference, E[N(t + dt) − N(t)|N(t) > 0] < E[N(t +

λ(t)dt = E[N(t + dt) − N(t)|N(t) = 0]P{N(t) = 0}
+ E[N(t + dt) − N(t)|N(t) > 0]P{N(t) > 0}
< h(t)dt(1 − F(t)) + λ(t)dtF(t),
and λ(t) < h(t), and thus ˜c(t) > 1. The hazard rate
function h(t) coincides with the intensity λ(t) and ˜c(t) = 1
when there is no DSB interference and N(t) is a non-
homogeneous Poisson process (see [8] for example).
IV. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
Using existing data of Southern blotting and genome wide
DSB intensity maps, we have obtained some preliminary
results about DSB interference. Fig. 2 depicts the hazard
rate function h(t) deduced from the DSB size distribution
of Southern blotting [13] (see [12] for the estimation method
based on Nelson-Aalen estimator). Also, Fig. 3 is the inten-
sity λ(t) from the microarray analysis of [15]. Since the
two datasets come from completely different experiments,
the signal levels are not adjusted. Here, we use a simple
normalization to rescale the intensity λ(t) to satisfy
Z c
0
h(t)dt =
Z c
0
λ(t)dt,
(5)
which should be valid when there is no DSB interference,
since in that case, h(t) = λ(t). The resulted rescaled
intensity λ(t) is compared with the hazard rate function h(t)
in Fig. 4. We use the moving average of 20 signals of the
original data of λ(t) for noise ﬁltration.
The two curves h(t) and λ(t) are agreeable with the loca-
tions of hot spots and cold spots. However, h(t) is smaller
on the left hand side of the chromosome, and especially
at around 400 Kbp, where we see a signiﬁcant difference
between λ(t) and h(t). Note that f(t) corresponds to the
intensity for the strongest positive DSB interference and
only one break exists on the chromosome. The interference

function ˜c(t) in Fig. 5 also shows no or very small positive
interference (less than ˜c(t) < 1.5). Most of the variance of
˜c(t) can be explained by the poor calibration of two datasets
obtained from different experiments. Thus, we can conclude
that there is no or very weak positive DSB interference on
chromosome no. 11 of budding yeast in the sae2 mutant
background.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we discuss the possibility of analyzing DSB
interference by combining the results from Southern blotting
and microarray analysis. We also included some preliminary
results about DSB interference, but we should point out that
the results obtained by applying our method are not ﬁnal
and we need further analysis to discuss the existence of DSB
interference.
