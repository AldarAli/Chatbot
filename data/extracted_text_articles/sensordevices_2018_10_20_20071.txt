Abstract—This
paper
investigates
the
connected
vehicle
concept at intersections with traffic signals control and
proposes the use of Visible Light Communication (VLC) in
Vehicular
Communication
Systems
for
vehicle
safety
applications. A smart vehicle lighting system that combines the
functions of illumination, signaling, communications, and
positioning is presented. A generic model of cooperative
transmissions
for
vehicular
communications
services
is
established. Three specific vehicular communications systems
are
analyzed.
One
is
for
Infrastructure-to-Vehicle
communications from the street lamps, located on roadside, to
the vehicles; the other is for in line Vehicle-to-Vehicle
communications and the last for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
communications from cars to the traffic lights, at the crossroad.
An on-off code is used to transmit data. The encoded message
contains the ID code of each emitter concomitantly with a
traffic message that is received, decoded and resent to another
vehicle or to traffic light, in the crossroad. An algorithm to
decode the information is established. A phasing traffic flow is
presented as a proof of concept.

INTRODUCTION
The communication through visible light holds special
importance when compared to existing forms of wireless
communications. The visible light spectrum is completely
untapped for communication and can complement the Radio
Frequency (RF)-based
mobile communication systems.
Modern vehicles are equipped with many electronic sensors,
which monitor the vehicle’s speed, position, heading, and
lateral
and
longitudinal
acceleration.
Although
the
technology already exists, vehicles rarely communicate this
information
wirelessly
to
other
vehicles
or
roadside
infrastructure [1]. The goal of the Cooperative Intelligent
Transport
System
(C-ITS)
is
to
provide
a
vehicular
communication system that can enable quick, cost-effective
means to distribute data in order to ensure safety, traffic
efficiency, driver comfort, and so forth. Researchers are
anticipating
the
deployment
of
wireless
vehicle
communication to improve safety and reduce congestion
[2]. This use case is known as connected vehicles. Recently,
the transportation lighting infrastructure such as street
lamps, traffic lights, automotive lamps, etc., is changing to
Light Emiting Diodes (LEDs). In the case of an ITS based
on Visible Light Communication (VLC), it will be possible
to make use of the conventional automotive and traffic
LEDs.
Secondly,
the
electromagnetic
compatibility
problem, which is a very serious problem in ITSs based on
RF signals, will be minimized since visible light and the
conventional RF signals occupy different parts of the
electromagnetic
spectrum.
Compared
to
RF-based
communications, VLC offers robustness against jamming
attacks, a smaller interference domain, and a large license-
free spectrum [3].
Vehicular Communication Systems are an emerging type
of network in which vehicles and roadside units are the
communicating
nodes,
providing
each
other
with
information, such as safety warnings and traffic information
[4]. The vehicular communication for C-ITS is composed of
infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. The
I2V applications focus on utilizing the trafﬁc related 
infrastructure, such as trafﬁc light or streetlight to 
communicate useful information. So, VLC can be realized
as a secondary application in LED arrays that are placed for
lighting.
In the recent past, we have developed a Wavelength
Division Multiplexing (WDM) device that enhances the
transmission capacity of the optical communications in the
visible range. The device was based on tandem a-SiC:H/a-
Si:H pin/pin light controlled filter with two optical gates to
select different channel wavelengths. When different visible
signals are encoded in the same optical transmission path

[5], the device multiplexes the different optical channels,
performs
different
filtering
processes
(amplification,
switching, and wavelength conversion) and finally decodes
the encoded signals recovering the transmitted information.
This device can be used as receiver, and helps developing
automated vehicle technologies that allow vehicles to
communicate with the surrounding ‘environment’ [6].
An introduction to the paper is given. The rest of the
paper is structured as follows: In Section II, a traffic
scenario is established and the transmitters and receivers are
characterized. The performance of a cooperative driving
system is evaluated in Section III. In Section IV, as proof of
concept, a traffic scenario is presented and tested. Finally, in
Section V, the conclusions are addressed. The proposed
smart
vehicle
lighting
system
involves
wireless
communication, computer based algorithms, smart sensor
and
optical
sources
network,
which
constitutes
a
transdisciplinary
approach
framed
in
cyber-physical
systems.
II.
CONNECTED VEHICLES MODEL
An infrastructure-to-vehicle followed by vehicle-to-
vehicle and by vehicle-to-infrastructure communication was
simulated. The illustration of the proposed scenario is
displayed in Figure 1, for a light traffic controlled crossroad.

Connected vehicles communication in a crossroad.
In Figure 1a, the generic cooperative vehicular model is
shown and in Figure 1b, the proposed scenario is illustrated.
Using
the
I2V
communication,
each
street
lamp
(transmitter) sends a message received and analyzed by a
SiC receiver, located at the rooftop of the vehicle. Using the
headlights as transmitters, the information is resent to a
leader vehicle (V2V) or directly to a crossroad receiver
(V2I), at the traffic light, interconnected to a local controller
that feeds one or more signal heads.
Along the roads, street lamps are distributed in a square
topology, for data transmission and lighting purposes. They
are based on commercially available violet (V: 400 nm) and
white RGB-LEDs. The white LEDs require three separate
driver circuits to realize the white light. To decrease this
complexity at each node, only one chip of the LED is
modulated for data transmission, the Red (R:626 nm), the
Green (G:530 nm) or the Blue (B:470 nm) while the other
two are provided constant current for illumination.
A four-code assignment for the LEDs was used. The unit
cell employs four R, G, B and V LED located at the corners
of a square grid, as shown in Figure 2. The estimated
distance from the street lamps to the receivers is used to
generate a circle around each transmitter (see Figure 2), on
which the receiver must be located in order to receive the
transmitted information. The grid size was chosen in order
to avoid an overlap in the receiver from the data from
adjacent grid points. The geometric scenario used for
calculation uses, for calibration, a smaller size square grid (2
cm), to improve its practicality. To receive the information
from several transmitters, the device must be positioned
where the circles from each transmitter overlap, producing,
at the receiver, a MUX signal that after demultiplexing, acts
twofold as a positioning system and a data transmitter. The
nine generated regions, defined onwards as footprints, are
presented in Figure 2 [6].

are illustrated in Figure 3. Two traffic flows are considered,
one in the horizontal (W) and the other on the vertical
direction (S). Each streetlight sends traffic message that
includes the synchronism, its physical ID and traffic

information. Each node, X i,j, carries its own colour, X,
(RGBV), as well as its horizontal and vertical ID position in
the surrounding network (i,j).

Figure 3.
Lighting plan and generated joint footprints in a crossroad.
In the I2V communication, the emitters are located along
the roadside. Each lamp transmits data during the time slot it
occupies, i.e., the individual LED lamp transmits its own
data depending on the area it locates. The transmitted
information is received and decoded at an external SiC
pi’npin receiver, located on the rooftop of the car (Figure
1b). When a probe vehicle enters the streetlight´s capture
range, the receivers respond to light signal and its unique ID
and the traffic message are assigned.
To build the V2V system between a leader and a follower
vehicle, the follower sends the message that is received by
the leader and can be retransmitted to the next car [7] or to
the infrastructure. Therefore, each probe vehicle receives
two
different
messages:
the
one
transmitted
by
the
streetlight (I2V) and the one coming from the follow vehicle
(V2V) and can compare them. This system uses an approach
in which a sequence of cellular locations is matched to a
route segment along the road network that appears to be the
most probable. All observations for a single section are
analysed together to produce an estimate of the lane
occupied and travel time along that section.
In the V2I communication, two interconnect receivers are
located at the same traffic light, facing the cross roads, and
the
emitters
at
the
headlights
of
the
moving
cars
approaching the interception. When a car enters in the
infrastructure´s capture range of the receivers, an approach
message is received and decoded by the corresponding
optical pi’npin receiver. So, each driver, approaching the
intersection area from S, W or both sends an approach
request, that are compared by the intersection manager
(local controller of the traffic light). Those messages contain
the assigned ID positions, speeds, and flow direction of the
vehicles that approach the intersection. The requests are
labelled either with a W (West) or S (South) label,
depending on the flow they belong to. The vehicle service
time depends on its flow and on the flow of the following
vehicle. The problem that the intersection manager has to
solve is allocating the reservations among a set of drivers in
a way that a specific objective is maximized. In particular,
V2V communication is useful to enhance the action space of
a driver, e.g., through the option of dynamically joining
groups of vehicles, based on the idea of platoons.

CODING/DECODING TECHNIQUES
A.
Modulation scheme
We have considered a network composed of a single
access point (vehicle) and several nodes that periodically
generate data, at different rates. The optical signals are
synchronized and include the transmission of information
related to the ID position of the transmitters and the
message to broadcast. So, in a time slot, each node has a
packet to transmit.

message [10101: rrr ccc: XY….]. R3,4 , G3,3, B2, 4 and V2,3 are the transmitted
node packet, in a time slot, from the crossroad in the network.
Each frame is a word of 32 bits, divided into three
blocks: the synchronism (5 bits), the binary node address, (6
bits) and the traffic message (payload data). In Figure 4, an
example of the codification of the digital optical signals is
illustrated.
We
assigned
the
first
five
bits
to
the
synchronization in a [10101] pattern. It corresponds to the
simultaneous transmission of the four nodes in a time slot.
Each colour signal carries its own ID-BIT [rrr;ccc] where
the first three bits give the ID binary code of the line and the
next three the ID binary code of the column. For instance,
an ID_BIT [011 100] for the R3,4 streetlight is sent whereas
in case of G3,3, an ID_BIT [011 011] is generated by the
green LED. Thus, R3,4 , G3,3, B2,4 and V2,3 are the transmitted
node packets, in a time slot, inside the crossroad. With
perfect information, this method will give an exact, unique
answer, i.e., the unit cell location in the cluster and, for each
unit navigation, the correspondent footprint.

B.
The pi´npin receiver
The VLC receiver is a tandem, p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-
Si:H)-n heterostructure sandwiched between two transparent
conductive contacts (TCO). The device configuration and
operation is shown in Figure 5. The deposition conditions
and optoelectronic characterization of the single layers and
device, as well as their optimization were described
previously [5] [8].
Figure 5.
Double pin configuration and device operation.
The device operates within the visible range using for
data transmission the modulated light supplied by the violet
(V) and by the trichromatic red (R), green (G), blue (B)
LED transmitters. The mixture of the modulated optical
signal (transmitted data) impinging on the receiver are
absorbed accordingly to their wavelengths. The combined
optical signal (MUX signal; received data) is analysed by
reading out the generated photocurrent. Previous results
have
shown
that
the
device
acts
as
a
Multiplexer/demultiplexer device [5] [ 9].
C.
Signal decoding and positioning
In Figure 6, the normalized MUX signal, in a stamp time,
is displayed. In Figure 6a, the bit sequence was chosen to
allow all the on/off sixteen possible combinations of the four
channels. On top, the signals used to drive LEDs are shown
to guide the eyes into the on/off states of each input. In
Figure 6b, the MUX signal acquired by the receiver, located
at the crossroad, position #1, #9 and #7 (see Figure 3), are
displayed. The decoded packet of transmitted information
when all the channels are received is presented in the top of
the figure.
Results from Figure 6a, show that the MUX signal
presents as much separated levels as the on/off possible
combinations of the input channels, allowing decoding the
transmitted information [10]. On the right hand side, the
match between MUX levels and the 4 bits binary code
ascribed to each level is shown. The MUX signal presented
in Figure 6a, is used for calibration purposes.
The signal is decoded by assigning each output level to a
4- digit binary code, [XR, XG, XB, XV], with X=1 if the
channel is on and X=0 if it is off.

After decoding the MUX signals, the localisation of the
mobile target is direct. Taking into account the frame
structure (Figure 4), the position of the receiver inside the
navigation cell and its ID in the network is revealed. The ID
position comes directly from the synchronism block, where
all the received channels are, simultaneously, on or off. The
4-bit binary code ascribed to the higher level identifies the
receiver position in the unit cell. Those binary codes are
displayed in the right hand of the figure. For instance, the
level [1100] corresponds to the level d5 where the green and
the violet channels are simultaneously on (see arrow in
Figure 6a). The same happens to the other footprints (#1 and
#9). Each decoded message carries, also, the node address
of the transmitter. So, the next block of six bits gives de ID
of the received node. In #7 the location of the transmitters,
in the network, are G3,2 and V2,3 while in #1 the assigned
transmitters are R3,4 , G3,2 B2,4 and V2,3. The last block is
reserved for the transmission of the traffic message (payload
data). A stop bit (0) is used at the end of the frame.

COOPERATIVE VLC SYSTEM EVALUATION
A.
I2V communication
Figure 7a displays the I2V MUX signal received, in three
times slots, by a rooftop receiver, moving in the W
direction, when the vehicle is located in #3, moves to #1 and
arrives to the stop line (#7). In Figure 7b, it moves from
south from #5 to #1 and arrives to the cross line (# 9). In the
top of both figures, the decoded packet of data sent by the
addressed R, G, B and V transmitters are pointed out. On
the right sides of the figures, the received channel, and so
the footprint position in the navigation cell, are identified by
their 4 digit binary code.

recognized while in Figure 7b the R3,4 […011 100…], G3,3
[…011 011…], B4,4 […100 100…], and V4,3 […100 111…]
nodes are identified. In the others positions, only two
messages arrive to the receiver. The assigned reference
nodes in Figure 7a are: R3,2 ; B2,2 (#3) and G3,3 ;V2,3 (#7),
while in Figure 7b the assigned reference point are: #5 (B4,4;
V4,3) and #9 (R3,4; G3,3).The vehicle speed can be calculated
by measuring the actual distance travelled overtime using
ID´s transmitters tracking. The distance is fixed while the
elapsed time will be obtained through the instants where the
number of received channels changes. As in Figure 3b, at
the instant initial, t0, the receiver moves west from footprint
3 to footprint 1 (Figure 7a). The decoded MUX message
changes from two (R3,2 B2,2) to four (R3,2 G3,3 B2,2V2,3)
transmitted channels. After an elapsed time, t, footprint 7
is reached and the number of received transmitters changes
again to two (G3,3 V2,3). In the following, this data will be
transmitted to another leader vehicle through the V2V
communication or to the traffic light through V2I.
B.
Traffic Signal phasing: I2V, V2V and V2I
communication
Signal phasing is the sequence of individual signal phases
within a cycle that define the order in which pedestrian and
vehicular movements are assigned the right-of-way. The
cycle repeats itself continuously over time but the timing of
the light switches is made according to the phasing of the
traffic light. A brief look is given in Figure 8.

Phasing of traffic flows: phase number 01 (pedestrian phase),

A traffic scenario was simulated. We consider two flows
of vehicles entering the system at the beginning of their
respective roads, one from West (W flow), and one from
South (S flow). Three vehicles are considered. Vehicle 1
and Vehicle 3 belong to the same flow (W) and Vehicle 2
belongs to the S flow. The phasing of the traffic flows is
composed of a pedestrian-only stage (01 phase), and two
single-lane road phases crossing at a square intersection
area: the W flow stage (02 phase) and the S flow stage (03
phase). Each phase exists as an electrical circuit from the
controller to the traffic light and feeds one or more signal
heads. A phase can apply to a two aspect head (pedestrians;
red or green) or to a three aspect head (vehicles; red or
yellow or green). The green and yellow represent the time

Proof of concept. MUX/DEMUX signals. V2I communication

In Figure 9, the V2I communications, in successive
moments, are displayed. Three instants are considered to
define the phase’s duration, t1, t2 and t3 (Figure 8). At t1 and
t2, Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 approaches, respectively, the
intersection and contact optically the intersection manager
(controller) by sending a request message to the receiver
(V2I) located at the traffic light that faces the road (Figure
3b). Vehicle 3, contacts the infrastructure (V2I) at t3. Those
messages contain their positions and approach velocities.
The MUX signal at each receiver and the assigned decoded
messages (at the top of the figure) are displayed at t1 and t2.
The position of both vehicles are: R3,2 and B2,2 (#3, W) for
Vehicle 1 and B4,4 and V4,3 (#5, S) for Vehicle 2.
To model a worst-case situation, vehicles approaching
the intersection from different flows are assumed to have a
conflicting trajectory. Therefore, three subsequent instants
have to be predictable, t´1, t´2 and t´3, as the correspondent
access times of the Vehicle 1, Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 3
(Figure 8). From a capacity point of view it is more efficient,
if Vehicle 3 is given access at t’3 before Vehicle 2, t’2 to the
intersection, then, forming a west platoon of vehicles before
(t´2) giving way to the south conflicting flow as stated in
Figure 8.

CONCLUSIONS
A distributed mechanism for the control and management
of a traffic light controlled crossroad network, where
connected vehicles receive information from the network
(I2V), interact each other (V2V) and with the infrastructure
(V2I) was analyzed. A simulated traffic scenario was
presented and a generic model of cooperative transmissions
for vehicular communications services was established. As a
proof of concept, a phasing of traffic flows is suggested.
