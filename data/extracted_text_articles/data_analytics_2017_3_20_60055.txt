Abstract—Web analytics tools provide a wide range of 
information regarding the performance of a company. This 
information is valuable for assessing the strategic performance 
of a company. However, Web analytics tools at their current 
state of development fall short in providing all the necessary 
information and data analysis functionality that is required to 
assess the strategic performance and the digital marketing 
priorities of businesses. This paper utilizes DEMATEL (i.e. 
Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) method in 
order to investigate how the Balanced Scorecard Model can be 
associated with data collected from the Google analytics. The 
data in this study are collected from the management and the 
Website of a company that provides tourism services in 
Greece. This research also examines the potential of using Web 
analytics in strategic decision analysis. 
Keywords-Google analytics, DEMATEL, Digital Marketing 
Analytics, Multi-Criteria Analysis. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Information that can be found on Web analytics tools 
relates to the number of visitors, their demographics, their 
location, the paths of Web pages they visited, etc. Such 
information is valuable in assessing the current performance 
of a firm but also in planning its future development. Firms 
have already recognized that business activities on the Web 
are of particular importance for their growth. Subsequently 
they increasingly invest in digital marketing [1], [2]. Indeed, 
spending in digital marketing, including paid search, display 
advertising, 
social 
media 
advertising, 
online 
video 
advertising and email marketing will account to 46% of all 
advertising in five years from 2017, and it is expected to 
reach $120 billion by 2021 according to [3]. In another 
survey, by [4], 65% of marketing leaders surveyed in the US 
plan to increase their spending on digital advertising, due to 
factors that impose a continuing and consistent shift of 
offline media spending to digital advertising, a decline of 
organic social in favor of paid social and the rising 
importance of video, which is more expensive than other 
digital techniques.  
On the other hand, a large number of strategic planning 
frameworks, such as the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), have 
been developed with the aim to assist top management 
designing the future development of their businesses across 
business sectors. For example, in logistics services, within 
the context of the SELIS (‘Towards a Shared European 
Logistics Intelligent Information Space’) research project, it 
is important to establish the conceptual links between Web 
analytics and business performance, i.e. to identify the 
appropriate KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and model 
their interrelationships. Despite the large number of studies 
pertaining to strategic decision making, little research has 
attempted to integrate business strategic frameworks with 
Web analytics. Few are also the studies who attempt to 
explore the potential of Web analytics in strategic planning. 
[1], [2], and [5] argue there is very little academic or 
empirical work examining how Web analytics might impact 
an organization and what benefits they might bring. They 
have examined the strategic use of Web analytics but they 
did not investigate how Web analytics affect or affected by 
business metrics and KPIs defined in strategic frameworks 
such as the BSC. The need to develop a BSC model that

takes into consideration the recent developments in e-
business and Web analytics has already been recognized. An 
application for a “balanced web analytics scorecard” patent 
has been submitted in the US in 2014 by SAP (Systems, 
Applications and Products) AG (Aktiengesellschaft (i.e. in 
German: Stock Corporation) [6]. A balanced Web analytics 
scorecard considers perspectives, objectives and (KPIs) 
based on Web analytics. According to the patent application, 
the balanced Web analytics scorecard suggests at least one 
perspective related to Web-based activities, such as a traffic 
generation perspective, a visitor engagement perspective, a 
growth and innovation perspective or an e-commerce 
perspective. Scores for Web analytic-based measures are 
calculated based on the Web analytics, while the patent 
suggests that updated balanced Web analytics scorecards can 
be stored and be made available on a computing device. The 
consideration of multiple KPIs implies multi-criteria 
methods’ suitability for assessing the business strategic 
performance. This paper suggests the use of DEMATEL, 
which is well established and used in similar studies [7]. The 
DEMATEL is proposed for it allows decision makers, e.g. 
business managers, to express their beliefs regarding the 
inter-relationships among KPIs, as well as to indicate their 
business priorities. In addition, the DEMATEL produces the 
cause-effect model that can be used to simulate several 
strategic scenarios and investigate their impact on the KPIs 
in consideration. 
Thus, this research aims to: 
 
Propose a multi-criteria approach for identifying 
and assessing the interactions among the perspectives 
defined in the Balanced Scorecard model and Web 
analytics. 
 
Evaluate analytics tools, such as the Google 
analytics, as strategic analysis tools, and suggest ways 
for their improvement.  
II. 
THE BALANCED SCORE CARD 
The BSC is considered, by many managers, as an 
important tool in strategic management [8].  The use of the 
BSC is based on the visualization, through a specific drew up 
shape, of a company’s strategic management plan [8]. The 
BSC is a model for the measurement and the performance 
analysis of all types of businesses. It was developed by 
Kaplan and Norton [9], [10]. They argued that the mere 
consideration of the established financial criteria was not 
enough to measure the business performance, since financial 
criteria could not represent all aspects of businesses. 
Therefore, they suggested that the (KPIs) of a company 
should also include measures related to the products, the 
company’s interaction with its customers, the holistic view 
of company’s internal processes and the outcome of the 
organization’s activity to improve, innovate and develop its 
business procedures [9], [10]. The combined consideration of 
both financial and non-financial criteria offers the company’s 
management a comprehensive list of measures that reflect 
various aspects of the business and its current outcomes as 
well as indicate the potential for the business to react or even 
preempt against the fast changing requirements of the 
market’s environment [11]. The BSC can be used as an 
additional supportive asset for the company management 
during decision making and it can directly contribute to the 
formulation of long term value based relationships with the 
stakeholders [8]. A BSC considers four perspectives namely, 
the Financial, the Customer, the Internal Business Processes 
and the Learning and Growth, with the associated (KPIs) for 
each perspective. An example of a BSC is shown in Figure 1. 
  
 
 
Figure 1.  [12] 
In order to examine its research objectives, this study 
focuses on the financial and customer perspectives, for 
simplicity reasons. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY AND METHODS 
3.1 Methodology for evaluating business strategy based on 
Web analytics 
This study proposes a multi-criteria approach in order to 
assess the business strategic performance by utilizing the 
BSC and the information that is available on Web analytics 
platforms. Data is collected from two sources. Firstly, from 
the management of the company that participated in our case 
study, and, secondly, from the company’s Google analytics 
tool. The data is analyzed by utilizing the DEMATEL 
multicriteria analysis method. In recent years, many 
researchers 
adopted 
Multi-Criteria 
Decision 
Making 
(MCDM) approaches for solving problems such as assessing 
alternative solutions, selection problems, strategic analysis 
[13] etc. The steps of the proposed methodology adopted 
follow. 
Step 1: Collect data from the business management 
regarding strategic priorities (management data). The data in 
our study are selected from a company that operates in the 
tourism industry in Greece. Through its website, the 
company allows tourists of higher income to book luxurious 
villas for their holidays. A group of five (5) managers, 
dealing with digital marketing and business development, 
had agreed to participate in our study. At first, the managers 
were asked to review the BSC and specify a list of KPIs that 
42

would represent the BSC perspectives most appropriately to 
their business. Next, the managers were asked to review the 
Google analytics data set of the company and to select a list 
of parameters they would consider most important. The 
group of managers was also presented with a comprehensive 
list of Web analytics KPIs as found in [2]. The Fuzzy Delphi 
method [13] was utilized in order to prioritize and finally 
select managers’ suggestions. The final list of parameters is 
shown in Table I:

A questionnaire was developed and sent to five (5) 
managers of the company that participated in this case study. 
The questionnaire consisted of questions that referred to the 
extent the selected criteria affect each other. A 5-point Likert 
scale ranging from 0 to 4 representing the ‘no influence’ to 
‘very strong influence’ scale was used for the respondents to 
report their beliefs regarding the interactions among the 
criteria considered in the study. The sample size of five is 
adequate for applying DEMATEL, since a group ranging 
between 5 and 15 experts is more appropriate [14]. 
Step 2: 
Apply DEMATEL and construct a strategy 
causal model. The selected criteria were evaluated by 
utilizing the DEMATEL method, so that importance 
priorities for each criterion are calculated and their 
interactions are specified in the DEMATEL causal model.  
Step 3: Collect Google analytics data. Data from the 
company’s Google analytics are selected and analyzed.  
Step 4: Assess the strategic performance of the company. 
Examine the proposed model’s ability to produce results 
upon which conclusions can be drawn regarding the strategic 
performance of the company. 
3.2. The DEMATEL Method 
The DEMATEL method was developed by the Battelle 
Geneva Institute [16]. DEMATEL is a multi-criteria method 
which is used to model and analyze complex relationships 
among factors pertaining to a particular domain. The method 
is applied to real life problems where the consideration of the 
interactions among important criteria is needed. DEMATEL 
produces causal models that show how interrelated factors 
affect each. The method can equally handle qualitative and 
quantitative factors. The DEMATEL method has been 
extensively used in MCDM problems such as marketing 
strategies, e-learning evaluations, control systems, safety 
problems, and environment watershed plans [17]-[26]. The 
steps of DEMATEL are shown below: 
 
Step 1: Generate the Direct Relation Matrix. The direct 
relation matrix is calculated based on experts’ responses. The 
experts comment on the influence a factor exerts on another 
by using the following scale: 0 for no influence, 1 for 
somewhat influence, 2 for medium influence, 3 for high 
influence and 4 for very high influence. The direct relation 
matrix 
]
[

A 
is a nxn matrix, where 
j
ia , indicates the 
degree to which factor (i) affects factor (j). In the case of a 
group of experts, all responses are averaged to produce the 
average matrix Z, where
, with i,j indicating 
performance criteria. 
Step 2: Calculate the normalized initial Direct- relation 
matrix D. The Matrix D is calculated using the following 
formulas. 
 
where, 
 
,  
and 
 
. 
Step 3: 
Derive the Total relation matrix T. 
Where, 
 
 
. 
Step 4: 
Calculate the sums of rows and columns of 
matrix 
T. 
The 
sum 
of 
rows 
is 
calculated 
by 
 and the sum of columns is 
calculated by  
. The value of 
r(i) indicates the total effect given by criterion (i) both 
directly and indirectly. The value of c(j) shows the total 
effect received by criterion (j) both directly and indirectly. If 
(j = i), the value of (ri+ci) represents the total effects both 
given and received by factor (i), while the value of (ri-ci) 
shows the net contribution by factor (i) on the system. If (ri-
ci) is positive, then factor (i) is a net cause, which means 
factor (i) affects other factors of the model. If (ri-ci) is 
negative, then factor (i) is a net receiver that implies factor 
(i) is affected by other factors of model. 
Step 5: 
Set a threshold value (α). The threshold is 
calculated with the formula,  
 
,  
where n is the number of criteria. The threshold is used to 
cut-off the most important criteria, which will be included in 
the DEMATEL causal model.

the importance of the most important criteria, i.e. those 
above the threshold and the degree of influence among 
criteria.

The shadowed numbers are those who exceed the 
threshold (a=0,49). The (ri+ci) and the (ri-ci) for each 
criterion are calculated and shown in Table IV. 
In Table IV, the criteria that give effects (positive ones) 
and those who receive effects (negative ones) are represented 
in different colors. The results in the Total matrix (T) show 
how business criteria conceptualized in the BSC are 
associated, affect or affected, with data from the Google 
analytics. For example, “cost reduction”” and “revenue 
growth” are interacting with the “number of views”, the 
“number of the returning users”, which are data collected 
from the company’s Website. Equally important, the T 
matrix shows how Web analytics data, e.g. the “number of 
the returning users”, affect business criteria such as “sales”, 
“cost”, “revenue growth”, etc. 
Therefore, the utilization of DEMATEL constitutes a 
way to unveil and study the interactions among business and 
Web analytics data, regarding the performance of a firm.

In addition, by focusing on the (r+c) the results show that 
the top 5 of the most important performance criteria in the e-
tourism industry are the “sales” which is the foremost 
important factor, followed by the “number of the returning 
users”, the “number of views” of the Website and the 
“customer satisfaction”, thus indicating the importance of the 
Web channel for companies to improve their performance. 
By examining the (r-c) column, the results indicate that the 
most affected criteria, those with negative (r-c), i.e. criteria 
affected by other are the “type of device”, the “revenue 
growth”, the “sales”, the “returning users” and the “number 
of views”. The results also show the important role of the 
“navigation program” that users use, in affecting other 
criteria such as the “sales”. Although outside the scope of 
this study, this could possibly be an indication that the 
browser and the type of device that users use could be 
features of the users’ profile. 
 
Figure 2.  The DEMATEL Causal Model. 
The causal model shown in Figure 5 is produced by 
applying the threshold in order to distinguish the criteria with

higher than the threshold interactions. The causal model 
shows how each KPI affects or is affected by other KPIs. 
This model does not only show the interactions among KPIs 
but it can be used in scenarios simulations that investigate 
the impact of alternative business strategies on selected 
KPIs. 
As T matrix in Table III shows, the criteria “nationality” 
and “device” do not affect or are not affected by any criteria 
with impacts higher than the threshold. It implies that the 
management of the company does not have any particular 
interest in distinguishing customers based on their nationality 
or the network provider they use. In other circumstances 
these interactions would have been different if specialized 
promotion programs had been in place to address customers 
from certain countries or network providers. The application 
of the threshold also shows in Table III that the “reduce cost” 
criterion is not affected significantly by other criteria, but it 
affects sales.  
Finally, by reviewing the actual performance of the 
company as shown in the “Business and Google Analytics 
Data” column in Table IV, the management can contrast 
their priorities with the real outcomes. Management can 
compare and contrast the (r+c) column with their top 
priorities and judge to what extent their expectations have 
been realized. For example, Table IV shows that the 
“number of views” which is the third most significant 
priority exhibited the top actual performance. Similarly, 
“customer satisfaction” which is the fourth most important 
priority, is actually the second most successful area. 
However “sales”, which is the top priority, did not return the 
results that the company anticipated, thus indicating that 
sales related policies should be reviewed.

CONCLUSIONS 
Web analytics play an important role in assessing the 
effectiveness of business development and strategy. 
Currently Web analytics tools do not provide the 
comprehensive KPIs set that is needed to address the 
complexity of business decisions making. This study used 
the BSC as business strategic framework and examined how 
it can be integrated with the Web analytics data sets. By 
utilizing the DEMATEL method, this research proposes how 
to identify and comprehensively analyze the interactions 
among business criteria as defined within the BSC 
framework and Web analytics data. It also identifies the most 
important Web analytics KPIs in e-tourism. This research 
also indicates that DEMATEL can be used to highlight and 
contrast the strategic priorities and expectations of the 
management with the actual performance of the company, as 
this is reflected in the Web (Google) analytics data. 
Furthermore, this research suggests that, Web analytics tools 
should improve their functionality by combining MCDM 
methods such as the DEMATEL method, with strategic 
frameworks such as the BSC in order to enhance their value 
in assessing digital marketing strategies. 
The proposed approach will also be tested within the 
context of the SELIS research project, in order to examine its 
applicability in linking Web analytics and strategic 
performance evaluation in the logistics service sector. 
Future research should focus on developing Web 
analytics methods and tools that provide the necessary data 
sets and the required functionality in analyzing and 
managing the interactions among data generated online 
within the context of business strategy and development.
