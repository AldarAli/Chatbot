Abstract—Graceful degradation entails a loss of functionality or
reduction in the service quality that a system provides in response
to faults. One new form of graceful degradation, which is called
region adherence, upper-bounds the violation of safety due to
faults in space. Bounding in space means that the decrease of
service quality, which the system provides to its environment, is
upper-bounded per fault. In this paper, we investigate the effect
of composing region-adherent systems such that the resulting
system is also region-adherent. We analyze the service quality of
region-adherent wireless sensor networks, which are structured
according to different topologies. We cover all possible fault
scenarios and analyze their impact on differently structured
networks by calculating the minimal, the average, the standard
deviation, and the variance of the resulting service qualities.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, the increasing use of computers in almost every
ﬁeld of modern life has led to a need for highly dependable
computer systems. Fault tolerance is a well-known approach by
which the dependability of computer systems can be increased.
[1] The goal of fault tolerance is to provide the intended
service of a system despite the presence of faults in the system.
Graceful degradation [2] is one of the possible concepts to
realize a fault-tolerant system. In graceful degradation, the
execution of the system continues but in a “degraded” mode.
A “degraded” mode is a limited functionality or performance
of the system even when a large portion of the system has
been destroyed or rendered inoperative.
Region adherence [3] is a particular form of graceful degra-
dation: a system may be implemented based on a distributed
algorithm that employs redundancy to bound the observable,
incorrect behavior of the system in space. With “bounding
in space,” it is meant that the decrease of the quality of
the service, which the system provides to its environment,
is upper-bounded per fault. We call such an algorithm (resp.
the system implementing it) region-adherent. Let f be the
maximal number of faults a system is able to withstand. Then,
a region-adherent system – per fault – gracefully degrades the
service quality provided by the system. It does so up to some
maximal number of faults. Additionally, degradation is upper-
bounded per fault. A region-adherent system exhibits very
desirable fault tolerance properties as it provides quantiﬁed
service quality guarantees in case up to f faults happen. Thus,
at any time, knowing the number of faults that already have
occured, the system user can take an a priori-known minimal
service quality for granted: a very valuable information in
various critical settings. Examples of region adherent systems
are presented in [3] and [4] along with a formal deﬁnition of
region adherence and formal techniques for proving the region
adherence property. Becker et. al. [3] introduced the concept
of region adherence and presented a Wireless Sensor Network
(WSN) for monitoring the air humidity in some geographical
region. In this WSN, a region-adherent algorithm is used that
helps to quantify the effects of failed sensors in the sensing
process of the WSN. A simple reﬁnement of the lower bounds
of the service quality known of a region-adherent system is
presented in [5].
The main idea of this paper is to compose region-adherent
systems out of region-adherent subsystems and analyze the
impact of faults on the service quality of the resulting (region-
adherent) system. For this purpose, we investigate ﬁve tree-
shaped WSN topologies, each with nine sensor nodes subject
to faults. We show that, for these particular examples, the par-
allel composition of the subsystems lead to a higher average of
service quality than composing the subsystems in hierarchical
fashions. Furthermore, we gain the best results by distributing
the sensor nodes between the parallel subsystems as equally
as possible.
The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we
brieﬂy introduce the notion as well as a formal deﬁnition of
region adherence together with closely related notions needed
for the understanding of the presented material. In Section III,
we give a general formula for calculating the average service
quality of a region-adherent tree-shaped WSN. Section IV
analyses ﬁve compositions of region-adherent WSNs based on
tree-shaped topologies with nine sensor nodes each using the
general formula. In Section V, we summarize the results of
the paper.
II.
NOTION OF REGION ADHERENCE
The basic idea of the region adherence concept is to restrict
the safety property invalidation of a system in space. This
is achieved by upper-bounding the reduction of the service
quality of a system per fault up to some maximal number of
faults. It is important to note that region-adherent systems can
only by realized, if the possible faults which might occur (i.e.,
the faults of the underlying fault model) may not transfer a
system from a given state to any other state in the system
state space.
For an example of the fault-tolerant behavior of a region-
adherent system, refer to Figure 1. The dashed blue line shows
the service quality of the region-adherent system in a particular
execution of the system. The solid blue line (i.e., the “staircase-
like graph”) states the minimal service quality guaranteed by
the system. Irrespective of a particular execution, the system’s
service quality always remains on or above the minimal
service quality represented by the “staircase-like graph.” In
the example, the system is initially in a safe state. In a safe
state, it always delivers 100% of service quality. After the ﬁrst

fault has occurred, the system must deliver a service quality of
at least 100%−α. Note that the dashed line actually exhibits a
slightly higher service quality. This is possible for a particular
execution but may not generally hold. After the second fault,
the guaranteed and delivered service quality is again reduced,
but it becomes not lower than 100% − α − β. After the third
fault, the guaranteed service quality is at least 100%−α−β−γ.

adherent system: here, the blue dashed line, again, represents
a particular execution of the region-adherent system over time.
The execution starts in the innermost region where the system
exhibits 100% of service quality. When the ﬁrst fault occurs,
the system is thrown into a state of the neighboring region
with only 100% − α service quality. The next fault lets the
system enter a region with only 100% − α − β service quality
and so on. When being in a particular region – without any
further fault occuring – the system is allowed to stay within
the region, it is currently in, as well as in any included region.
In this sense, the system behavior is restricted in space, i.e., it
must adhere to regions of known system quality. We formally

deﬁne the notation of region adherence as follows [6]:

quality of the system and let f
be a natural number.
r : {0, . . . , f} 7→ [0, 1) is a non-decreasing function with
r(0) = 0 and r(f) < 1.
Algorithm A is called f-region-adherent wrt. g, r, and F,
if and only if for all reachable conﬁgurations c ∈ C, all initial
conﬁgurations c0 ∈ C0 and all executions γ = c0 · · · c ending
in c with #F \A(γ) ≤ f, the following holds:
g(c) ≥ 1 − r

In the following, we deﬁne a sensing tree network formally.
Deﬁnition 3 (Sensing Tree Network (with Failures)): A
tuple S = (N, B, W, T, b) with a set of nodes N, a set of
gateway nodes B ⊆ N, a set of sensor nodes W ⊆ N, a
transition relation T ⊆ B × N, and an initial node b ∈ B
is called sensing tree network. For T, we demand two
constraints. Firstly, for every two nodes n1, n2 ∈ N with
n1 ̸= n2 there must exist exactly one path between n1 and
n2. Secondly, for every b ∈ B there must be a node n with
(b, n) ∈ T.
For a set of faulty nodes F
⊆
W, we call S
=
(N, B, W, T, b, F) a sensing tree network with failures.
As an example, the sensor network depicted in Figure 4 is de-
ﬁned as SA = ({s0, s1, . . . , s9}, {s0}, {s1, . . . , s9}, {(s0, si) |
si ∈ W}, s0), with s0 as the given root gateway node.
In our setting, the sensors are distributed in a (small)
geographical region, but should sense redundantly the same
data.
For a given sensing tree network with failures S
=
(N, B, W, T, b, F), we assume that each sensing node w ∈ W
delivers a value v(w) ∈ [0, u] for a given bound u. Let V
denote the exact value which should have been sensed, then
each correctly sensed value can deviate from this value by at
most ϵ > 0. Since we only want to investigate the impact of a
faulty node on the service quality in different topologies, we
abstract from drawing the value of a faulty node randomly but
consider its value to be zero. Thus,
v(w) ∈

[0, 0]
if w ∈ F
[V − ϵ, V + ϵ] ∩ [0, u]
otherwise
For collecting all child nodes of a given gateway node, we
deﬁne the function c : B → P(N) with c(b) = {n ∈ N
|
(b, n) ∈ T}.
The mean value of a gateway node is calculated by ˜v :
B → Q with
˜v(b) =
1
|c(b)| ·


X
w∈c(b)∩W
v(w) +
X
b′∈c(b)∩B
˜v(b′)

 .
(3)
Since all sensors should sense the same value, we estimate their
value by calculating the arithmetic mean. The left summand
calculates the sum of the values of the sensor nodes directly
connected to the gateway node. If a gateway node has other
gateway nodes as children by itself, we calculate their value
recursively and sum them up in the right summand. The mean
value of a gateway node is this sum divided by the number of
all children.
We now calculate the service quality of a sensing tree
network with failures S = (N, B, W, T, b, F) analogously to
the approach presented by Becker et. al. [3] for only one
gateway node:
g(S) = min

(4)
For comparing the impact of failures on differently struc-
tured sensing tree networks, we calculate the mean of all
possible occurrences of failures (i.e., failure scenarios). For
a sensor tree network S = (N, B, W, T, b) and f failures, we
deﬁne the set of all possible sensing tree networks with failures
as SF(S, f) = {(N, B, W, T, b, F) | F ⊆ W ∧ |F| = f}.
This means that SF(S, f) contains all possible failure scenar-
ios of a given sensing tree network with a ﬁxed number f
of failures. Thus, we can use the binomial coefﬁcient

sensor nodes. All sensor nodes are on level 2 whereas the gateway node
forms the root of the network on level 1.
For example, there are nine failure scenarios where exactly
one sensor node fails and 36 failure scenarios with exactly
two failures. The results for a WSN using Topology A are
given in Table I. For this topology, the standard deviation is

level within one group. Thus, any subset of sensor nodes failing
conceptionally has the same impact on the reduction of service
quality. This can more obviously being seen in Figure 5.

Topology B: Here, we consider a 3-level tree topology of the
form given in Figure 6. Four sensor nodes together with an
additional gateway node are placed on level 2. The additional
gateway node manages ﬁve sensor nodes on level 3. These
ﬁve sensor nodes together with their gateway node form a
subsystem with a topology similar to Topology A. A WSN
using Topology B can be perceived as a WSN that is composed
hierarchically by a “parent” system on levels 1 and 2 – which
is 3-region-adherent – and a subsystem, which is 4-region-
adherent. The entire system obviously is 8-region-adherent.

Again, we inject an increasing number of faults into the system

and the variance of the service quality. The results are given in
Table II. It can be seen that the possibility of faults occurring

differently, compared to faults in Topology A: faults occurring
on a lower level (i.e., level 3) have less an impact on service
quality than faults occurring on a higher level (i.e., level 2)
of the system. This fact leads to higher standard deviations
and variances than in Topology A. This can also be seen
in Figure 7. When comparing the minimal service qualities
obtained by Topology A and B, we see that in all non-trivial
cases, Topology A outperforms Topology B.

A subsystem consists of a gateway node on a higher level

and three sensor nodes on the next lower level. The three
subsystems together with an additional gateway node, acting
as root, form the 3-level topology. Note that within the
three subsystems, sensor nodes are evenly distributed. Each
subsystem is 2-region-adherent and the entire system is, again,
8-region-adherent. The test results are given in Table III and
Figure 9.
Although Topology C differs from Topology A as Topol-
ogy C composes three subsystems in a parallel manner (as
opposed to composing nine sensor nodes in parallel), the values
obtained for service quality, average service quality, standard
deviation, and variance are very similar. The particular sym-
metric grouping of three sensor nodes in three subsystems has
only a negligible effect on these measures.

Topology D: For this topology, we modify Topology C such
that the sensor nodes are not evenly distributed to the three
subsystems. We believe that this homogeneous distribution of
sensor nodes to subsystems is responsible for the very low
standard deviation and variance of Topology C. Topology D
is given by Figure 10. As one can observe, the assignment of
the nine sensor nodes to the three subsystems is now some-
how “unbalanced.” Subsystem 3 is 4-region-adherent, whereas
subsystems 1 and 2 are only 1-region-adherent. The whole
system is again 8-region-adherent. Table IV and Figure 11
show what we have expected. Topology D is responsible for a
severe loss in minimal service quality compared to Topologies
A and C. Furthermore, Topology D’s standard deviation and
variance is also much higher. When comparing the results of
Topology D with the results of an hierarchical composition as
given by Topology B, one observes that the former outperforms
the latter for all non-trivial cases in terms of minimal service
quality, standard deviation, and variance.

Topology E: In this topology, shown in Figure 12, we increase
the number of levels by applying a hierarchical composition
of systems twice. The resulting topology still has nine sensor
nodes in total, but they are distributed on four levels. Within
each level, though, the sensor nodes are evenly distributed.
A WSN according to this topology can be interpreted as
a system that uses a subsystem. This subsystem includes a
subsystem (shown as “sub-subsystem” in the ﬁgure) of its own.
The “parent” system spanning levels 1 and 2, as well as the
subsystem and the sub-subsysten, are 2-region-adherent. The
entire system is 8-region-adherent.
As we can observe in Table V and Figure 13, the standard
deviation and the variance increase again. In particular, they are
even higher than the corresponding values of Topology B. Fur-
thermore, the minimal service quality of all non-trivial cases

hierarchical composition – introducing various levels where

failing sensor node on the observed measures depends on its
level: a sensor node failing on a lower level (having a higher
level number) has less an impact than a sensor node failing on
a higher level.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a ﬁrst step towards analyzing the
impact of faults on the service quality of differently composed
(i.e., structured) region-adherent WSNs. By means of parallel
and hierarchical composition, we designed ﬁve tree-shaped
network topologies. These topologies were subsequently used

by WSNs to perform their tasks. Each WSN was – by design
– 8-region-adherent. For each topology (and thereby: for each
WSN), we calculated the minimal service quality. Furthermore,
we simulated all possible fault scenarios and calculated the
average, the standard deviation, and the variance of the service
quality. The results showed that – depending on the topology
– faults can differently impact the minimal service quality and
related measures of the system. In particular, the experiments
suggest that composing a WSN from subsystems in a parallel
fashion leads to better results than composing it hierarchically.
Furthermore, the more evenly the sensor nodes are distributed
over the subsystems, the less negative is the impact of failures.
