Abstract—Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission for 
LTE-Advanced is to improve system performance, especially 
to enhance cell coverage and cell-edge data rate. With 
efficient resource allocation schemes, CoMP transmission 
could be a promising technology to increase system 
throughput. Existing frequency plan schemes on downlink 
CoMP transmission limit the performance of the system 
since they do not take the changes in traffic load as well as 
link quality into consideration. In this paper, an optimized 
scheme is proposed that each base station could allocate 
different proportion of bandwidth to different users’ 
equipments (UEs) according to their traffic load and link 
quality, to make the system more flexible and efficient. The 
scheme is more effective in both system throughput and cell-
edge throughput as verified through system level simulation.

 INTRODUCTION 
Coordinated multi-point transmission/reception is 
considered for LTE-Advanced as a tool to improve the 
coverage of high data rates, the cell-edge throughput and 
system throughput. Downlink coordinated multi-point 
transmission 
implies 
dynamic 
coordination 
among 
multiple geographically separated transmission points [1], 
that could improve cell-edge performance and to improve 
system throughput with efficient resource allocation [2][3]. 
In general, the cost of downlink CoMP for single user (SU) 
is found only beneficial to the cell-edge users where the 
perceived Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) 
is low [4].  
In order to improve system performance, several 
frequency plan schemes have been proposed. The fixed 
frequency plan scheme divides each cell’s frequency into 
two parts, that is, CoMP Frequency Zone and Frequency 
Band for Single Cell Operation [5]. Such scheme maybe 
easy to implement, however, when considering the 
complexity of wireless communication environment, it 
lacks flexibility and may cause a decrease in system 
throughput performance. Another type of frequency plan 
scheme is the completely dynamic frequency plan scheme, 
known as the flexible frequency allocation plan (FFAP) 
scheme. Such plan ensures the cells which have formed 
more CoMP links to UEs being allocated more resource. 
The FFAP scheme allocates resource according to the 
number of cell-edge UEs, which makes it more flexible 
than the former fixed frequency plan scheme. However, 
such scheme allocates a certain proportion of frequency 
resource, which decreases system performance; and its 
complexity problem of joint schedule algorithms will 
become increasingly high [5]. 
Some of the recent works focuses on the FFAP scheme 
and its optimization [6]. However, since a certain 
proportion of frequency resource should be allocated to 
ensure CoMP transmission in such scheme, system 
performance may as well be decreased. Other recent works 
mainly focuses on schemes without frequency zone 
partition as well as algorithms to reduce implementation 
difficulties [7]. 
This paper proposes a frequency plan scheme to 
optimize the performance of the system considering both 
the traffic load as well as the link quality of UEs. Since it 
allocates frequency resource according to the cell’s traffic 
load distribution and the link qualities, the proposed 
frequency plan scheme could achieve better fairness and 
system performance. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section II introduces the models of the system; Section III 
describes the proposed scheme for downlink SU-CoMP 
transmission. Simulation scenario and results are shown in 
Section IV. Section V concludes the paper. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL WITH COMP TRANSMISSION 
In CoMP transmission systems, cells could be 
classified into two different types: the serving cells and the 
coordinated cells. Each base station possess 
t
N  transmit 
antennas while each UE consists of 
r
N  receive antennas. 
The transmission model is described as follows.  
A. Baseline Transmission 
Baseline transmission refers to a situation of non-
CoMP transmission. Under such system, each base station 
delivers data with individually selected codebook. Thus, 
the subordinate UE receive both data signal and 
interference from neighboring cells, with additive white 
Gaussian Noise. As in baseline transmission, there is no

cooperation performed between the serving cell and the

considering

N  as transmit antennas and 
r

antennas, the received signal can be formulated as

power of noise received ( N ). The SINR under such mode 
could be calculated through the following equation

B. Downlink SU-CoMP Transmission 
CoMP transmission consists of SU-CoMP mode and 
multiuser (MU) CoMP mode, where SU-CoMP refers to 
single user CoMP transmission and MU-CoMP refers to 
multiple user CoMP transmission [8]. Under SU-CoMP 
mode, the serving cell and the coordinated cell maintain 
the same codebook, which means SU-CoMP users can 
receive desired signals from both cells. Therefore, SU-
CoMP users experience only interference from other cells 
(besides the serving and coordinated cells), with additive 
white Gaussian Noise. 
In addition, the serving cells can both serve its 
subordinate UE as well as serve UE that belongs to other 
cells as coordinated cells. In most of the cases, cell-center 
UE would maintain better SINR, which leads to its often 
being served by their serving cells only. For cell-edge UE, 
their SINR may be so unpleasant that calls for coordinated 
cells to co-serve themselves. Therefore the definition of 
cell-center UE and cell-edge UE is very important in 
deciding the transmission scheme. 
In our work, cell-edge UE could be defined as such UE, 
whose position is very near the boundary of its original 
serving cell, maintain a SINR that is relatively low. Such 
UE often calls for downlink CoMP transmission. 
Otherwise, UE whose position is in the center of its 
serving cell possesses a SINR that is relatively high 
denotes cell-center UE. Cell-center UE does not require 
coordinated cells to serve themselves; in other words, they 
have only one access point. 
Under SU-CoMP transmission mode, the received 
signal could be formulated as:

where p is the index of coordinated cell base station [7]. 
Likewise, the first two terms on the right side of the 
equation denote signals received from the serving cell and 
the coordinated cell respectively, and combined as the 
desired signal
sdesired
. The third term denotes the 
interferences I , and the forth one denotes the noise 
received N . Therefore, the SINR under SU-CoMP 
transmission could be analyzed through (2).  
When CoMP transmission is performed, resource is 
allocated according to frequency plan schemes. The fixed 
frequency plan scheme allocates a certain fixed portion of 
frequency band for CoMP transmission. Therefore, the 
frequency band of each cell is divided into two parts: the 
CoMP transmission frequency band and the serving 
frequency band, as shown in Fig. 1. 
Figure 1. Fixed Frequency Plan Scheme 
In such case, each cell retains bandwidth for CoMP 
transmission when CoMP happens. We could also estimate 
the 
best 
distribution 
method 
with 
good 
system 
performance. Such spectrum plan, though easy to operate, 
could hardly take into consideration the different situations 
between different cells. The FFAP scheme will have better 
utilization of the spectral bandwidth since it allocates 
frequency band according to the number of CoMP links in 
a certain cell. However, if CoMP Frequency Zone of one 
cell changes, other cells may also need adjustment to 
maintain CoMP operation. The FFAP scheme allocates a 
certain proportion of frequency bandwidth according to (4), 
which leads to the fact that is the same within each of the 
three cells.

performance under such plan could be greatly improved. 
The proposed scheme suggests that the proportion of 
frequency band allocates to SU-CoMP transmission is 
dynamic, that is to say, base stations could gather traffic 
load information of the system and link quality and 
therefore make decisions about the proportion could be 
chosen based on such knowledge.  
The proposed frequency allocation plan scheme could 
be seen in Fig. 2, where BW is the total bandwidth of the 
spectrum. 
Figure 2. Flow Chart of Proposed Frequency Allocation Plan Scheme 
On the first step, base stations receive information 
about data rate from both cell-center UEs and cell-edge 
UEs. In order to determine the access mode of a UE, that 
is, whether this user is served by a single serving base 
station or is served by both serving base station and 
coordinated serving station, a threshold ratio is defined. 
Different threshold ratio may result in different cell edge 
coverage. Therefore in our work the threshold ratio is 
decided according to the most likely percentage of CoMP 
users by simulation. In our work, the decision of CoMP 
transmission mode is operated by examining the following 
inequality among each UE. 
 
 
.

RSRP
threshold ratio

(5) 
Here, RSRP refers to the Reference Signal Receiving 
Power. If (5) is true, we define the UE as cell-edge UE and 
it is served by both serving and coordinated cell, in other 
words, is under coordinated multipoint transmission mode. 
Otherwise, it is a cell-center UE and it is served by only its 
serving cell. 
Then, base stations work out both the cell-center load 
and the cell-edge load based on the traffic load and link 
qualities of UEs. Such information could be acquired by 
base stations using channel information feedback. 
Therefore, the proportion of bandwidth assigned for CoMP 
users could be defined as:

As shown in Fig. 3, each marker denotes the location 
of UEs at a certain time. And the three base stations are 
marked as ’BS1’, ’BS2’, and ’BS3’, with markers red ’ 
○ ’, green ’ □ ’, and blue ’ △ ’, respectively. Each 
location point of UEs is stamped with a marker. The shape 
of the marker represents the coordinated cell of this UE, if 
exists, whereas the color of the marker represents the 
serving cell of this UE. If a user belongs to cell-center 
category, the shape of its marker will be a ’·’. For 
example, suppose 
1
UE is served by cell 1 and is 
coordinated served by cell 2. The marker of 
1
UE in the 
Location Map will be a red ’ □ ’. 
B. Simulation Flow Chart 
Figure 4. Flow Chart of System Level Simulation 
Fig. 4 illustrates the steps of system level simulation of 
our work. The simulation applies 200 TTIs. First of all, in 
the step of initializing position of UE and BS, a scenario 
shown in Fig. 3 is set. Second, in every loop, path loss, 
multi-path loss, and shadow fading are updated. Then base 
stations are able to get information about channel matrix 
and therefore RSRP of UEs. After acquiring these qualities, 
the system group UEs into two categories, the cell-edge 
UEs and the cell-center UEs. Cell-edge UEs not only 
access to their serving cells, but also are assigned certain 
bandwidth to perform coordinated transmission, that is to 
say, is accessed by coordinated cells. Cell-center UEs, 
however, have only one access point, their serving cells, 
and exchange data through baseline transmission mode. 
Finally, the performance of the system under the proposed 
frequency allocation plan scheme is evaluated. SINR and 
user data rate are evaluated to obtain system throughput. 
Here, in order to keep the fairness of all UEs at a relatively 
high target, if the user data rate is below a threshold value, 
as:

C. Simulation Results 
Fig. 5 illustrates the total throughput of the system 
under three different frequency allocation plans, with the 
number of UE in three cells from 200 to 40,000. From the 
result of Fig. 5 we could conclude that the proposed 
scheme has a significant improvement in system 
throughput performance. For example, the gain of system 
throughput when performing the proposed scheme is 
28.20% over the FFAP scheme (when the number of UE 
in the system is 1600).

CoMP transmission. The proposed scheme shows higher 
gains over the FFAP scheme. 30.46% of the cell-edge 
throughput is improved when performing the proposed 
scheme. Therefore, cell-edge throughput performance 
should reach a preferred value when operating the 
proposed frequency allocation plan scheme.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have evaluated the FFAP scheme in 
downlink CoMP transmission. A novel frequency 
allocation plan scheme is proposed, which takes both the 
traffic load of each cells and link quality into consideration. 
We have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme 
through system level simulation. About 30% gains of the 
system throughput and cell-edge throughput could be 
reached when performing the proposed scheme for 
resource allocation.
