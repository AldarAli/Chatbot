Abstract—We propose a cost-optimized location and service 
management scheme for next-generation mobile networks 
(NGWN), where a per-user service proxy is created in order to 
serve as a gateway between the mobile user and all client-
server applications engaged by the mobile user. The service 
proxy is always co-located with the mobile user's location 
database during a location handoff, a service handoff also 
ensues to co-locate the service proxy with the location database. 
This allows the proxy to know the location of the mobile user at 
all times in order to reduce the network communication cost 
for service delivery. We analyze four integrated location and 
service management schemes. Our results indicate that the 
centralized scheme performs the best when the mobile user's 
service to mobility ratio (SMR) is low and  (session to 
mobility ratio) is high, while the fully distributed scheme 
performs the best when both SMR and   are high. Through 
analytical results, we demonstrate that different users with 
vastly different mobility and service patterns should adopt 
different integrated location and service management methods 
to optimize system performance.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Location and service managements have often been 
separately addressed in literature [1]-[3]. For location 
management, the most popular scheme in Long-Term 
Evolution (LTE) networks is the MME-Cell scheme where 
each Mobile User (MU) has a Mobility Management Entity 
(MME). Whenever a MU enters a Cell, the system updates 
its MME location database so that when a call arrives, the 
MME location database knows exactly which Cell contains 
the MU. Variations to the basic MME-Cell scheme have 
been proposed in recent years to process location update and 
search operations more efficiently, e.g., Local Anchor (LA) 
[4], Forwarding and Resetting [5], Two-Level Pointer 
Forwarding [6], and Hybrid Replication with Forwarding [7], 
etc. These location management schemes are designed to 
handle location update and search operations without 
consideration to service management. 
In this paper, we investigate the notion of integrated 
location and service management for minimizing network 
cost without making the assumption of fully replicated 
servers within cell in the LTE network. Instead, we target 
general personalized services in the LTE network including 
personal banking, stock market and location-dependent 
services for which the MU will communicate with a backend 
server. 
Based on the concept of using a per-user service proxy as 
a gateway between the MU and all client-server applications 
engaged by the MU concurrently [8], the proxy keeps track 
of service context information such as the current state of the 
execution for maintaining service continuity. Similarly to 
Chen et al. [9], we always co-locate the MU's service proxy 
with the MU's location database, which stores the current 
location of the MU, so that the service proxy knows the 
current location of the MU at all times so as to eliminate the 
cost associated with tracking the user location on behalf of 
the server applications for data delivery. Whenever the MU 
moves across a registration area boundary, a location handoff 
occurs for the location management system to update the 
location database. If a location hand-off results in moving the 
MU's current location database to stay closer to the MU, then 
the associated service handoff will also move the service 
proxy to the same location [10]. 
In this paper, we investigate and analyze integrated 
location and service management schemes. These schemes 
derive from the basic MME-Cell and LA schemes for 
location management, and the personal service proxy scheme 
for service management in the LTE network. We are 
motivated to investigate and identify the best cost-optimized 
location and service management scheme that can be applied 
on an individual user basis to minimize the overall cost 
incurred to the LTE network per time unit for the servicing 
location and service operations of all users. The amount of 
cost saving is relative to the speed of the LTE network and is 
proportional to the number of users, so the benefit is 
especially pronounced for slow and congested networks with 
a large number of mobile users. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
provides a description of the related work. Section 3 
describes in detail the four integrated schemes to be 
investigated and analyzed in the paper. Section 4 analyzes 
the cost incurred under each our schemes and presents 
analytical results with simulation validation. Finally, Section 
5 summarizes the paper.

RELATED WORK 
The seamless management of user mobility is an issue 
that involves every OSI [1]-[2] layer, from layers 1 and 2 
(handover between cells), through layer 3 (routing updates in 
the network core), up to the application layer (persistence of 
transport 
connections 
and 
user 
state, 
delay-tolerant 
operation). The Internet Protocol suite did not originally 
include any support for end-point mobility. Over the years, a 
whole family of Mobile IP (MIP) procedures were 
introduced in an attempt to provide mobility support in a 
backward-compatible way. On the other hand, current 
cellular standards, such as LTE, have all been designed with 
mobility in mind and integrate the appropriate support in the 
core network. The cellular control plane includes elements 
that store and maintain the state of the terminal while its 
association to the network persists, and oversees the creation 
of appropriate bearers to seamlessly provide applications 
with the illusion of a constant connection between the mobile 
terminal and the network.

The MME for LTE network supports the most relevant 
control plane functions related with mobility: it authenticates 
the User Equipment (UE) as it accesses the system, it 
manages the UE state while the users are idle, supervises 
handovers between different base stations (extended Node B, 
eNB), establishes bearers as required for voice and Internet 
(packet data network, PDN) connectivity in a mobile context, 
generates billing information, implements so called lawful 
interception policies, and oversees a large number of features 
defined in its extensive 3GPP specifications. Table 1 
summarizes the relevant acronyms that will be used 
throughout this paper. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the main logical MME interface. 
All network events involve control plane messaging 
procedures require the interaction of one or more entities, 
besides the UE and the MME. The ones relevant to our 
interests are the eNB, which manages the air interface toward 
the UE, and the Service Gateway (SGW), a control plane 
element that acts as a global mobility anchor, managing the 
entire data plane within a large geographic region (usually 
spanning several TAs). The messaging sequences are 
codified by the 3GPP standards as logical interfaces, such as 
S-1 (eNB to SGW) and S-11 (SGW to MME). Fig. 1 
schematically illustrates the interfaces supported by the 
MME, which are detailed in [11]-[12]. 
Mobile IP [13] allows a MU to maintain ongoing 
connections while roaming among IP subnets and requires 
the MU to inform its Home Agent (HA) of the new Foreign 
Agent (FA) address whenever it moves from one subnet to 
another. The function of a HA within a Mobile IP is similar 
to a Home Location Register (HLR) in Personal 
Communication System (PCS) networks for location 
management. Similar to the LA scheme in PCS networks, a 
variant of Mobile IP, called Mobile IP dynamic regional 
registration [14], has been proposed to group FAs into a 
gateway foreign agent (GFA) dynamically to minimize 
signaling costs in Mobile IP. These solutions, although 
elegant, solve only location management issues. For service 
management, a delivery protocol using a service proxy has 
been proposed to provide the reliable delivery of messages to 
MUs. However, the proxy used to forward messages to a 
MU must explicitly track the location of the MU, so extra 
communication costs are incurred to notify the proxy when 
the MU moves across a location registration area boundary.

COST-OPTIMIZED LOCATION AND SERVICE 
MANAGEMENT SCHEME 
A. Network Architecture  
We first describe a LTE system model for location 
management services. Then we describe an extended system 
model for integrated location and service management. We 
consider the LTE network architecture as shown in Fig. 2 
where the LTE service areas are divided into Registration 
Areas (RAs). 
 
 
Figure 2.  LTE Mobility Management Architecture. 
We assume that a particular MU will remain in a Cell 
before moving to another. For simplicity, the residence time 
is assumed to be exponentially distributed with an average 
rate of σ. Such a parameter can be estimated using the 
approach described by Yang and Lin [15] on a per-user basis. 
We also assume that the inter arrival time between two

When applying the anchor scheme to the cost-optimized 
location and service management, the cost model must 
include not only location update/search costs, but also the 
communication cost between a UE and its servers. Also, to 
deliver responses from a server to a UE through the proxy, 
the proxy must know the UE's current location. It is desirable 
not to query the MME to obtain the location information 
because of the high communication cost. Thus, for an 
integrated local anchor scheme to serve both location and 
service handoffs, whenever the UE moves to a new anchor 
area, it may be desirable to also migrate the service proxy to 
the new anchor area to be "co-located" with the new anchor 
in an anchor area, so that the service proxy can query the 
anchor to know the current location of the UE without going 
to the MME. Consequently, both a location handoff and a 
service handoff would occur when the UE crosses an anchor 
boundary in the integrated scheme. A service handoff that 
migrates the service proxy involves two operations, namely, 
an address-change operation to inform all application servers 
of the location change, and a service context transfer. The 
cost of the address change operation per server is T . The 
service context transfer is unique for the service handoff 
operation, with the amount of context information being 
application dependent. The context transferred may include 
both static context information such as user profile and 
authentication data as well as dynamic context information 
such as files opened, objects updated, locks and time-stamps, 
etc. Let 
2
  be the average communication cost between two 
neighboring anchor areas (per packet), and 
MCS
 be the 
number of packets required to transfer the service context. 
We list the system parameters considered in the paper in 
Table 2, including user parameters and application-specific 
parameters (such as 
MCS
). Their effects on the performance 
of Cost effective location and service management schemes 
are to be analyzed in the paper. 
Note that for the case in which a UE concurrently 
interacts with multiple servers, there would still only be one 
per-user service proxy co-located with the location database 
under our proposed integrated schemes. In this case, the 
service rate parameter γ would reflect the aggregate rate at 
which the UE makes requests to these multiple services, 
while the context transfer cost parameter, 
MCS
, would reflect 
the aggregate context transfer cost for moving the service 
context information of multiple concurrent services from one 
location to another. 
B. Operational Structures   
In this section, we discuss four possible schemes, i.e., 
centralized, fully distributed, dynamic anchor, and static 
anchor for integrated location and service management. 
We illustrate the centralized scheme in Fig. 3 (left). As 
the MU moves from Cell A, Cell B and subsequently to Cell 
C, the MME and the service proxy are updated to point to 
Cell B and then to Cell C sequentially. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Centralized (left) and Full Distributed (right) Schema. 
We illustrate the fully distributed scheme in Fig. 3 (right). 
When the MU moves from Cell A to Cell B, the service 
proxy migrates from Cell A to Cell B, and the MME and the 
server are updated to point to Cell B. The subsequent move 
to C behaves similarly. To service a location search request 
(not initiated from the current Cell), the MME database is 
accessed first to know the current Cell (A, B, or C) and then 
the MU is found within the current Cell. When the service 
proxy needs to forward replies to the MU, no additional 
searching cost is required to find the current Cell, since the 
service proxy is located in the current Cell. 
Under the dynamic anchor scheme, a location anchor is 
used for location management such that the anchor changes 
whenever the MU crosses an anchor boundary. In addition, 
the anchor may also change its location within an anchor 
area when a call delivery operation is serviced. The service 
proxy dynamically moves with the anchor and is always 
collocated with the anchor. In Fig. 4, when a MU moves 
95

UBICOMM 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies

within anchor area 1 from Cell A to Cell B, only the local 
anchor in Cell A is updated to point to the current location. 
Thus, the location update to the MME and application 
servers is avoided. Suppose that a call arrives after the MU 
moves into Cell C. The call will invoke a search operation in 
the MME database and a subsequent search operation in the 
anchor. Once the call is serviced, the MME database will be 
updated to point to Cell C; the anchor and the service context 
are moved from Cell A to Cell C; and the application servers 
are informed of the address change. Later, if the MU 
subsequently moves from Cell C to Cell D due to an inter-
anchor movement, the MME database will be updated to 
point to Cell D, which will subsequently become the new 
anchor after the service context is transferred to it. Data 
delivery from the server will pass through the service proxy 
co-located with the anchor to reach the MU. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Dynamic Anchor Schema. 
Under the static anchor scheme, the service proxy is 
again co-located with the anchor. However, the anchor will 
remain at a fixed location as long as the MU remains in the 
same anchor area. The only condition under which the 
anchor would move (along with the service context 
transferred) is when the MU moves across an anchor 
boundary. The procedures for processing the location update, 
call delivery, and service requests are the same as in the 
dynamic anchor scheme except that upon a successful call 
delivery, the anchor's location remains unchanged. Thus, 
there is no need to migrate the service proxy to the current 
serving Cell (if they are not the same) after serving a call 
delivery operation. 
IV. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
In this section, we develop analytical models for 
evaluating and comparing various integrated schemes 
introduced in Section 3. We first define the communication 
cost analysis model for two states in the LTE system. 
For analysis, the two-dimensional hexagonal random 
walk model [11]-[13] has been adopted. The LTE system can 
be assumed to be configured as a hexagonal network with a 
cell having radio coverage of an eNB. The UE moves from 
one cell to another, and its movement is modeled based on 
the two-dimensional hexagonal random walk model. In this 
model, a hexagonal cell structure is modeled and the cells are 
classified in a 6-layer cluster shown in Fig. 5. We assume 
that an UE resides in a cell unit for a specified time period 
and then moves to any of the neighboring cells with equal 
probability. Using this, a one-step transition matrix of this 
random walk can be derived by letting

Figure 5.  Hexagonal cell structure for performance analysis. 
From [11]-[13], we can model the signaling cost of two 
mobility states in an LTE system: LTE_ACTIVE where the 
network directs UE to the serving cell and the UE is ready to 
perform Uplink/Downlink transport with very limited access 
delay, and LTE_IDLE where the UE in a low power 
consumption state, could be tracked in the Tracking Area 
and be able to travel to LTE_ACTIVE at approximately 
100ms. 
We first parameterize the performance models developed 
by means of a hexagonal network coverage model for 
describing a LTE network to evaluate the performance of the 
cost-optimized location and service management schemes 
proposed in order to identify conditions under which one 
scheme could perform the best when given a set of 
parameters characterizing a UE's mobility and service

behaviors [15]. We use a hexagonal network coverage model 
to describe a LTE network where cells are assumed to be 
hexagonally shaped, with each cell having six neighbors. At 
the lowest level of Fig. 5, an n-layer Cell covers

system described by the hexagonal network coverage model 
as such, it can be shown that [11] with random movements,

that is, the probability of an intra-anchor movement, as the 
UE moves across a Cell boundary, is given by (1):

So, we define that network cost T  between a specific Cell

parameterize. For the fully distributed scheme, we need to

perform worse than the dynamic and static anchor schemes. 
This is attributed to the fact that the total cost rate is 
dominated by mobility-related cost factors at low   at which 
the mobility rate is much higher than the call arrival rate. 
Specifically, the centralized scheme performs badly in this 
condition because of the high cost for servicing location 
update operations as these operations need to access the 
MME in the centralized scheme. The fully distributed 
scheme does not performs well at low   because with a high 
mobility rate, the location update cost and the context

transfer cost are high in the fully distributed scheme. At very 
high  , the centralized scheme performs the best followed 
by the dynamic anchor over fully distributed and in the last 
place the static anchor scheme. The dynamic anchor 
performs better than the static anchor in this extreme case 
because in the dynamic anchor scheme the anchor collocated 
with the service proxy is close to the UE. Thus, the cost for 
service requests and location updates due to movements 
within an anchor area is low. Another reason is that when a 
call arrives and the anchor Cell is not the current serving Cell, 
the dynamic anchor scheme will update the MME after the 
call is serviced and move the anchor to the current Cell. This 
keeps the MME database up-to-date and keeps the anchor 
close to the UE. As a result, it reduces the call delivery cost 
since the system is able to find the UE quickly on subsequent 
calls, the effect of which is especially pronounced when   is 
high.

In Fig. 7, as the SMR increases, the cost rate under all 
four schemes increase because when the mobility rate    is 
fixed. At very high SMR, however, the fully distributed 
scheme performs the best among all followed by the 
dynamic anchor over the static anchor and centralized 
because in the fully distributed scheme, the UE's service 
requests can be serviced quickly by the local service proxy 
located in the current Cell database.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we investigated the concept of cost 
effective location and service management with the objective 
to reduce the overall communication cost for servicing 
mobility-related and service-related operations by the 
integrated LTE network environment. Our analysis result 
shows that the dynamic anchor scheme performs the best in 
most conditions except when the context transfer cost is high 
(when the server is heavy). The centralized scheme performs 
the best at low SMR and high  . Also, the fully distributed 
scheme performs the best at high SMR and high  . The 
static anchor scheme is a relatively stable scheme, 
performing reasonably well under a wide range of parameter 
values examined in the paper. These results mean that 
different users with vastly different mobility patterns should 
adopt 
different 
cost-optimized 
location 
and 
service 
management scheme for the better system performance.
