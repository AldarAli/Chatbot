Abstract—This paper presents the results of the long-term
research on advanced knowledge based mining enabled by
conceptual knowledge frameworks. The paper presents the
methodological base of a new algorithm framework of conceptual
knowledge pattern matching, allowing the consideration of
complementary and descriptive knowledge of meaning and
intrinsic object properties. The research is illustrated by practical
implementations
of
knowledge
pattern
matching,
including
processing and developing multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual
knowledge object entities and resources. Examples in this
specialised research concentrate on geoscientiﬁc context and
georeferencing. The goal of this fundamental research is to
create methods of knowledge pattern matching usable with
many resources and data collections. The implemented practical
approaches are for the ﬁrst time publicly available with this paper.

INTRODUCTION
Knowledge Mining is supported by a number of common
methods and algorithms, e.g., string pattern matching algo-
rithms, associative, comparative, and phonetic algorithms. All
these achievements deal with distinct extrinsic properties of
respective entities in very limited ways.
The motivation for this research was the lack of suitable
facilities for an advanced matching of ‘meaning’ when creating
mining solutions in context of complex multi-disciplinary and
multi-lingual Knowledge Resources. Knowledge, meaning, and
patterns form relations, which may require some introduction.
The concept of meaning differs from the concept of signiﬁ-
cation. Semantic and syntactic structures do not sufﬁce to de-
termine the discursive meaning of an expression [1]. Discourse
means a way of speaking. On the one hand, grammatically
correct phrases may lack discursive meaning. On the other
hand, grammatically incorrect sentences may be discursively
meaningful. Knowledge and meaning are closely tied with
intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Therefore, understanding of
intrinsic and extrinsic properties of entities is signiﬁcant for
any context. This is nevertheless true for any case of natural
language, esp. considering langage, langue, and parole [2].
Creating practical approaches requires algorithms. An algo-
rithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in problem-
solving operations. In general, algorithms cannot, by their
fundamental nature, handle intrinsic and extrinsic properties
to the same quality and extent. For example, an intrinsic
property of a word object is the meaning in mind, the ‘lemma’.
An extrinsic property of a word object can be a written
word. Extrinsic properties do not reﬂect meaning and insight
as their representations do not generally allow reasonable
results. Best practice provides us with solid, complementary
knowledge concepts and methodologies allowing to create
advanced methods.
Data do not have or carry meaning. Therefore, understanding
meaning is of major signiﬁcance in information science when
dealing with improving formalisation processes and creating
‘logos based’ analogies along with cognitive processes. Com-
monly, cognition (cognitio, from Latin cognoscere, “get to
know”) is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge
and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses
(Source: Oxford dictionary). Analogy (from Greek analogia,
`αναλoγ´ια, “proportion”) is a cognitive process of transferring
information or ‘meaning’ from a particular subject, the ana-
logue or source, to another, the target.
Nevertheless, aspects of meaning can be described using
knowledge complements, e.g., considering factual, conceptual,
procedural, and metacognitive knowledge [3]. Especially, con-
ceptual knowledge can relate to any of factual, conceptual, and
procedural knowledge. To a comparable extent, metacognitive
knowledge can relate to any of factual, conceptual, and proce-
dural knowledge. A practical approach for knowledge pattern
matching will be presented in the following sections.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
introduces the previous work and components. Sections III
and IV present methodology, method, and implementation.
Sections V and VI present the matching process and resulting
tables. Section VII summarises conclusions and future work.

PREVIOUS WORK, COMPONENTS, AND RESOURCES
The fundaments of terminology and understanding knowl-
edge are layed out by Aristotle being an essential part of
‘Ethics’ [4]. Information sciences can very much beneﬁt from
Aristotle’s fundaments and a knowledge-centric approach [3]
but for building holistic and sustainable solutions, supporting
a modern deﬁnition of knowledge [5], they need to go beyond
the available technology-based approaches and hypothesis [6]
as analysed in Platon’s Phaidon.
Making a distinction and creating interfaces between meth-
ods and the implementation applications, the results of this
research are illustrated here along with the practical example
of the Knowledge Mapping methodology [7] enabling the
creation of new object and entity context environments, e.g.,
implementing methods for knowledge mining context.

The means to achieve such recommendations even for
complex scenarios is to use the principles of Superordinate
Knowledge, integrating arbitrary knowledge. The core assem-
bly elements of Superordinate Knowledge are methodology,
implementation, and realisation [8]. Separation and integration
of assemblies have proven beneﬁcial for building solutions
with different disciplines and different levels of expertise.
Comprehensive focussed subsets of conceptual knowledge can
also provide excellent modular and standardised complements
for information systems component implementations, e.g., for
environmental information management and computation [9].
For the implementation of case studies, the modules are built
by support of a number of major components and resources,
which can be used for a wide range of applications, e.g.,
creation of resources and extraction of entities. The Universal
Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) [10] is the world’s foremost
document indexing language in the form of a multi-lingual
classiﬁcation scheme covering all ﬁelds of knowledge and
constitutes a sophisticated indexing and retrieval tool. The
UDC is designed for subject description and indexing of
content of information resources irrespective of the carrier,
form, format, and language. UDC is an analytico-synthetic
and facetted classiﬁcation. It uses a knowledge presentation
based on disciplines, with synthetic features. UDC schedules
are organised as a coherent system of knowledge with as-
sociative relationships and references between concepts and
related ﬁelds. The UDC allows an efﬁcient and effective
processing of knowledge data and provides facilities to obtain
a universal and systematical view on classiﬁed objects. UDC-
based references in this publication are taken from the multi-
lingual UDC summary [10] released by the UDC Consortium
under a Creative Commons license [11]. Facets can be created
with any auxiliary tables, e.g., auxiliaries of place and space,
time, language, and form as well as general characteristics,
e.g., properties, materials, relations, processes, and operations,
persons and personal characteristics. Module examples are
employing Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) [12]
syntax for specifying common string patterns and Perl [13] for
component wrapping purposes with this case study.

METHODOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATION
The
implementation
strictly
follows
the
fundamental
methodological algorithm base.
A. Methodological algorithm base
The Conceptual Knowledge Pattern Matching (CKPM)
methodology targets providing and accessing knowledge object
patterns. This methodological algorithm framework is based
on the Superordinate Knowledge Methodology, which allows
systematical use and thorough processing by the steps:
1)
Selecting knowledge objects.
2)
Accessing knowledge object patterns.
3)
Thorough processing of object entities and references.
4)
Object entity analysis, knowledge complements’ based.
5)
Result formation.
The respective accessing includes the organisation and struc-
tures used with the objects and entities. Object patterns need to
be accessible to an extent and quality, which allows a sufﬁcient
processing for the respective scenario. The requirements for
speciﬁc scenarios will therefore be individual. The processing
includes making use of the characteristics and features of the
respective implementations of the knowledge based frame-
works providing a conceptual base for a certain method. The
conceptual knowledge complements referred from knowledge
objects can have their origins from manual as well as from
automated processes. For the implementation and realisation,
the framework providing the base conceptual knowledge ref-
erence patterns is the UDC. The results in this publication use
the UDC Summary Linked Data (Main Tables, [14]). Creating
facets and patterns can also make use of the common auxiliary
signs being part of the UDC framework [15]. The following
advanced employment of conceptual knowledge (UDC) is far
beyond common application of universal classiﬁcation.
B. Implemented method
An implementation of a CKPM based method requires
accessible objects and a suitable conceptual framework base
for processing and automation. The methodic implementation
illustrated here enables to employ an UDC framework appro-
priate for systematical use, implemented by the steps:
1)
Knowledge Resources’ objects.
2)
Accessing formalised conceptual knowledge object pat-
tern description based on UDC, e.g., including geosci-
entiﬁc context and georeferencing.
3)
Processing procedure via pipelines, employing UDC
knowledge and forks.
4)
Entity analysis, based on UDC framework references.
5)
Result formation on base of Knowledge Resources’
objects, retaining conceptual knowledge.
In this case, meaning is described by conceptual patterns,
which can be searched and analysed. Processing algorithms
can follow the given organisation, e.g., the decimal organisa-
tion of the UDC, following available forks as will be illustrated
for the matching process in the following sections. Processing
and analysis includes primary, decimal conceptual knowledge
and associated multi-dimensional knowledge in context of
the object entities. The method allows advanced data-centric
computing procedures. In practice, the facility for consistently
describing knowledge is a valuable quality, esp., conceptual
knowledge, e.g., using the UDC and its editions.
C. Implemented conceptual knowledge framework and target
Targeting practical use for advanced geoscientiﬁc informa-
tion and expert systems, conceptual geoscientiﬁc and geo-
graphic mapping and referencing are required. Geographic
conceptual knowledge pattern entities are created based on
UDC code references [16] of geography, biography, history.

A geoscientiﬁc / archaeology example from the case studies
and implementations for geoscientiﬁc information systems
and application components is used for illustration in the
next sections. The example will show a tiny subset of the
comprehensive, universal conceptual knowledge used.
The above conceptual knowledge contains all the references
for geographic context, which includes the conceptual knowl-
edge regarding geographic data, e.g., geoinformation and geo-
descriptive knowledge. The relevant conceptual knowledge re-
quired for geoscientiﬁc context is provided by references from
natural sciences’ context. Any of the conceptual knowledge
can be used in any stage of a CKPM process, e.g., in start,
intermediate, and target speciﬁcations.
Natural sciences related conceptual knowledge pattern enti-
ties are created based on UDC code references [17] of mathe-
matics and natural sciences. An excerpt of the implementation

V.
NEW MATCHING PROCESS AND PROCESSING
The new framework of the matching process and processing
includes following the conceptual knowledge forks. Here,
the primary, decimal reference forks of the UDC are used
for implementation, which provide the red line forks within
universal knowledge. Matching is beyond non-conceptual
knowledge, e.g., natural language processing and string pattern
matching. Especially, country and border concepts cannot
be used for speciﬁcation, e.g., ancient and modern border
lines fail to be useful. The process enables places in ancient
Greece and Rome, from archaeological and prehistoric times
associated with places in the ancient and modern world to
be described, e.g., references of the type UDC:..."63"(37)
and
UDC:..."63"(38).
Trigger
question
can
be
‘Can
archaeological artefacts’ objects of a certain context be
associated with earth science objects?’. A symbolic writing
specifying a conceptual expression is shown in Figure 5.

The processing successfully follows the “Earth sciences”
and “Geography” forks. These procedures referencing to a
formalised [20], practical framework of conceptual knowledge
embrace all the relevant universal knowledge, e.g., including
natural sciences and geosciences, archaeology, philosophy, and
history. The results of removing in the domain of knowledge
and removing in the domain of mathematics are not the same.
In principle, abstraction means removing [21]. In the mathe-
matical domain, removing is mostly formalised by subtraction
[22]. In general, any universal conceptual knowledge frame-
work can be used, which enables a systematical processing
and which is universal and consistent.

CONCLUSION
This research achieved the goal to create a new method of
knowledge pattern matching based on the CKPM methodology.
The knowledge based mining implementation employed the
UDC references in order to provide the required conceptual
framework. The UDC references proved to provide an ex-
cellent core component, for universal, multi-disciplinary, and
multi-lingual knowledge.
In this new context, UDC showed to have a perfect organ-
isational structure of conceptual knowledge for practical, sys-
tematical use as well as for an efﬁcient and ﬂexible processing
support, following respective knowledge forks for references
while creating and keeping developing resources and concep-
tional knowledge consistent supported by its editions.
In daily practice, the new method provides excellent and
sustainable conceptual documentation and enables to create
associations and links between knowledge object entities,
which cannot result otherwise. Further, conﬁguring knowledge
ranges can be achieved in many ways, e.g., by limiting
resources, conﬁguring the pattern depths and widths, ranking
and selection.
Future research on theory and practice will continue devel-
oping suitable knowledge resources and knowledge patterns.
