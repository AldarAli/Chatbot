Abstract— The automation of production systems has been an
answer to the changing and competitive industrial context and
works by extracting data and experiences of experts. This
automation is a double-edged sword; on one hand, it increases
the productivity of the technical system (cost reduction,
reliability, availability, quality), but, on the other hand, it
increases the complexity of the system. This has led to the need
of efficient technologies, such as Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems and techniques that could
absorb this complexity such as artificial intelligence and fuzzy
logic. In this context, we develop an application that controls
the pretreatment and pasteurization station of milk localized in
Batna (Algeria) by adopting a control approach based on
expert knowledge and fuzzy logic.

INTRODUCTION
The overall process control objectives, such as the quality
and the quantity of product, have been left in the hands of
human operators in the past. Nowadays, computational
intelligence has been used to solve many complex problems
by
developing
intelligent
systems,
extracting
expert’s
knowledge. Fuzzy logic has proved to be a powerful tool for
decision-making systems, especially expert and pattern
classification systems. Fuzzy set theory has been used in
some chemical processes.
In
traditional
rule-based
approaches,
knowledge
is
encoded in form of antecedent-consequent structure. When
new data are encountered, it is matched to the antecedent's
clause of each rule, and those rules where antecedents match
a data exactly are fired, establishing the consequent clauses.
This process continues until the desired conclusion is
reached, or no new rule can be fired. In the past decade,
fuzzy logic has proved to be useful for intelligent systems in
chemical engineering. Most control situations are more
complex than we can deal with mathematically.
In this situation, fuzzy control can be developed,
providing a body of knowledge about the existing control
process, in the form of a number of fuzzy rules. Fuzzy logic
is used for the early detection of hazardous states and for the
implementation of logic decision-making.
In this work, the expert’s knowledge was extracted and
fuzzy logic was integrated in the SCADA system to control
an industrial process, milk production, to resolve problems
and replace the old supervision system by a new architecture.
The advantages of this architecture are its flexibility in
control, its ability to process a lot of information in order to
improve the productivity and to reduce maintenance costs. In
Section
2,
related
works
concerning
fuzzy
logic
are
presented. Section 3 is dedicated to the case study and the
proposed approach. The implementation and the results of
the developed system are discussed in Section 4. We
conclude and discuss the results in a conclusion.

FUZZY LOGIC BASED WORKS
In reasoning about a complex system, humans reason
approximately about their behaviors, thereby maintaining
only a generic understanding about the problem. The
generality
and
ambiguity
are
sufficient
for
human
comprehension of complex systems. As the quote below
from
Zadeh’s
principle
of
incompatibility
suggests,
complexity and ambiguity (imprecision) are correlated: “the
closer one looks at a real-world problem, the fuzzier its
solution becomes” [1].
Complex industrial processes, such as a batch of
chemical reactors, cement kilns and basic oxygen steel
making, are difficult to control automatically. This difficulty
is due to their non-linear, time varying behavior and the poor
quality of available measurements. In such cases, automatic
control is applied to those subsidiary variables which can be
measured
and
controlled,
for
example
temperatures,
pressures and flows. The overall process control objectives,
such as the quality and quantity of product, has been left in
the hands of human operators in the past [2].
Security and reliability needs require the implementation
of solutions such as artificial intelligence techniques. Expert
systems and fuzzy logic are the most useful techniques to
control industrial processes. Expert systems have the ability
to process information with real time updating, deal with
uncertain
or
incomplete
knowledge,
incorporate
new
knowledge into the program easily and put less pressure and
responsibility on the human operator’ they can evaluate the
effects of different manufacturing parameters [3].
Fuzzy logic has rapidly become one of the most
successful of today's techniques for developing sophisticated
control systems. The reason is very simple, namely, fuzzy
logic addresses such applications perfectly as it is similar to
human decision making with the ability to generate accurate
solutions from uncertain or approximate information. It fills
an important gap in engineering design methods left vacant
by purely mathematical approaches (linear control design),

and purely logic-based approaches (expert systems) in
system design [4].
Fuzzy logic offers several advantages that make it a
particularly good choice for many control problems. It can
control either linear or non-linear systems that are difficult or
impossible to find a mathematical model. For this reason,
fuzzy logic is integrated in several works and applied in
different domains, in process control, decision making [5], as
well as in failure mode and effect analysis [6].

CASE STUDY: MILK PRODUCTION
A. Production milk process
There are various products in the studied industrial
system, pasteurized milk (milk for consumption), sterilized,
fermented (called Laban), steamed yogurts, brewed and fresh
cheese. To obtain a final milk product, the process is
composed of several steps:

Step 1: Milk receiving unit used to collect and
analyze the milk.

Step 2: Pretreatment unit contains 3 parts:
 Plate Heat Exchanger: the goal is to exterminate
the bacteria.
 Degasser: used to remove the air present in the
product.
 Homogenizer: used to make the products more
homogeneous, which helps to
improve their
quality
and
extend
their
duration
of
the
conversation.

Step 3: Pasteurization unit to exterminate the
bacteria, and ensure the safety of the product.

Step 4: Storage unit allows storing the milk before
sending it to pasteurization.
The process of milk production passes through two
principal workshops, i.e., Pretreatment and Pasteurization:
a)
Pretreatment station
The process of the pretreatment station is composed of
the following parts:
i.
Plate Heat Exchanger:
It consists of a number of heat transfer plates, deposited
in such a way that a passage between two plates is accessible
to each of the two liquids (water and milk). It contains five
sections:

Section 1 (heating section): Composed of hot water
from (60 to 71) C°.

Section 2 (heating section): Composed of hot water
(64 to 70) C° and milk, this section heats the milk
from (58 to 68) C°.

Section 3 (Recovery Section): Composed of hot
milk and cold milk. This section allows for heat
exchange with convection to conserve energy, and
heat the milk gradually.

Section 4 (cooling section): Composed of tap water
from (30 to 42) C° and milk. This section allows the
milk to cool from (42 to 30) C°.

Section 5 (cooling section): Composed of cold
water (2 to 4) C°.
ii.
Degasser
The milk preheated to 68 ° C is introduced tangentially
into the vacuum vessel. The steam gases rise up the chamber
and are sucked by the vacuum pump, and the steam
condenses in the condenser and returns to the milk.
iii.
Homogenization
Homogenization step consists in passing the milk under
high pressure to 60 bars through very narrow orifices, which
reduce the size of the fat globules and partially destroy the
casein micelles. All parts are presented in Figure 1 and the
equipment is presented in Table I.

To carry out the pasteurization (Figure 2), a plate
exchanger is used. The plate heat exchanger is composed of
five stations, heating (S1P and S2P), recovery (S3P) and
cooling (S4P and S5P).

Section 1P (heating section): Composed of hot
water from (60 to 70) C°.

Section 2P (heating section): Composed of hot
water (96 to 100) C° and milk, this section heats the
milk from (90 to 95) C°.

Section 3P (Recovery Section): Composed of hot
milk and cold milk. This section allows for heat

exchange with convection to conserve energy, and
heat the milk gradually.

Section 4P (cooling section): Composed of tap
water from (32 to 35) C° and milk. This section
allows the milk to cool from (32 to 35) C°.

Section 5P (cooling section): Composed of cold
water (8 to 10) C°.

B. Problems and proposed solutions
During the internship within the company Aures Batna,
and after the collection of the information, we observed the
following shortcomings of the system:

The
production
system
of
the
unit
is
not
automatized.

Lack in the old system of supervision, which is not
an HMI.

There
is
no
quality
control
feedback
at
the
pretreatment and pasteurization stations.
Lack of control of different equipment pieces was due to
most of them being very old and missing sensors for
measurement.
To solve the above problems, we will try to build a
powerful application that can correct the problems presented
in the old system and that offers the services necessary to
better supervise the stations. Our application offers the
following advantages:

Synthetic and dynamic representation, which has a
graphical visualization of the behavior of the
stations.

Precise control of valves and actuators, taking into
account several parameters, and at the same time
the possibility of making the best decisions.

Fuzzy control of the various equipment pieces of
the stations.

Diagnosis of alarms that inform the operator about
the status and problems of the system.

Display messages that help the operator to make
decisions.

History of alarm occurrence with the possibilities of
printing and recording.

Secure access to the supervision system with a
password and a user name.
IV.
APPLICATION OF THE APPROACH IN INDUSTRY
To realize our approach, we divided it in two parts; the
first one is the creation of the supervision system and the
second is the creation of different fuzzy controllers in which
we present one example.
A. Interface of the supervision system
After description of all steps parameters, we created a
graphical
programming
in
LabVIEW
(Figure
3);
we
designed the supervision system that offers the following
solutions:

The system is no longer in half-automatic mode
using solenoid valves and the implementation of
fuzzy logic as a control technique.

Now, we have a feedback circuit for quality control
in the station to ensure the stability of the system.

A system for generating alarms to identify and
localize alarms.

Operators and engineers use HMIs to monitor and
configure set points, control algorithms, and adjust and
establish parameters in the controller. The HMI also displays
process status information and historical information. Figure
6 shows the main interface of pretreatment station after the
feedback circuit implementation in all the station.
To solve different problems in the workshop, we
proposed to insert a feedback circuit in the process controlled
by an HMI to control again the temperature of the product.
This circuit is controlled by a fuzzy loop (Figure 4); it
ensures the desired quality of the product and avoids its
rejection like the situation in the installed system controlling
different stations.
Figure 4.
Implementation of the feedback circuit in the pretreatment
station.
Diagnostics and maintenance utilities are used to prevent,
identify and recover from abnormal operation or failures. In
this reason, we created an interactive interface that locates
exactly the alarm and its nature that signals the existence of
an abnormal condition (for example, high pressure, max
level in tank, etc.). To see all the generated alarms, a register
of alarms was created. Figure 5 shows a block diagram that
illustrates the system generating alarms and defaults.

Block diagram of alarms generating system.
B. Creating Fuzzy Controllers
The creation of fuzzy controllers consists of two steps,
establishing the relationship between inputs and outputs by
fuzzy controller file Virtual Instrument (VI) and calling
Fuzzy
Controller
files
that
contains
the
rules
and
membership functions of the fuzzy controller.
We presented in Table II some parameters used by the
workshop, with their specifications, that will be used to
control different stations.

To integrate fuzzy control, we used some fuzzy rules
(Figure 7), like:

If ’TT1’ is (low ‘BAS’) then ’V2.1’ is ‘D1’ and
‘V2.2’ is ‘D2’.

If ’TT1’ is (accepted ‘accepté’) then ’V2.1’ is ‘D2’
and ‘V2.2’ is ‘D1’.

If ’TT1’ is (high ‘élevée’) then ’V2.1’ is ‘D1’ and
‘V2.2’ is ‘D2’.

We tested the system response and its performance by
comparing it with old controller using Matlab Simulink. The
obtained results prove the advantages of the proposed
method. The results comparison with a PID are shown in
Figure 9, which indicates that the system is more stable.

modules can be used to extend the system centrally or to
create decentralized structures depending on the task to be
performed. To connect S7-300 with LabVIEW software, we
used NI-OPC server to communicate between the PLC and
LabVIEW interface.
V. CONCLUSION
Presently, companies often require innovative solutions
to make their plant operating systems function at peak
efficiency. Using latest in equipment technology, resources,
and materials. However, complex industrial processes are
difficult to control because of inadequate knowledge of their
behavior. This lack of knowledge is principally a lack of
structural detail and it is this, which prevents the use of
conventional control theory. However, a human operator
who makes decisions based on inexact and linguistic
measures of the process state often controls these processes
with great skill. Fuzzy logic is considered as a superset of
standard logic, which is extended to deal with the partial
truth. It has become one of the most successful technologies
for developing complex control systems.
To improve control system reliability and availability, we
implemented all solutions by creating a supervisory system,
and we applicate different steps to ensure a fuzzy control of
the system. The main objective of these solutions is to
improve the old system. The solutions given are divided into
two types. The first is a material solution and we proposed a
feedback circuit implemented in each section with solenoid
valves to automate the system. In addition, we proposed
some equipment needed to implement the application. The
second one is a software solution in where fuzzy logic has
been used as a technique to control the milk production
process.
The
augmented
productivity
in
the
factory,
minimum downtime, and reduced costs of maintenance are
advantages of our solutions.
