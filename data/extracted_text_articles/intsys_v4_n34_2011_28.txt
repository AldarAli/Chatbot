Abstract - The purpose of this study was to estimate personality 
and mental health through behavior data measured by 
acceleration 
and 
voice 
intensity 
sensors. 
Traditionally 
measuring methodologies require huge amount of time and 
resources for its operation. Techniques that attempt to classify 
and measure psychological states require acknowledgment of 
its dynamic behavior, and the issues intrinsic to the use of self 
report inventories. This research conducted experiments in 
real-life settings, minimizing intrusiveness to participants. A 
methodology for estimating personality and mental health in 
the work place was proposed. Sensor-based behavior analysis 
provided an unobtrusive and time-efficient mechanism to 
estimate psychological states through measurement of a 
selected set of behaviors. This methodology’s objective was to 
demonstrate existing correlations between estimated behavior 
and assessed personality and mental health. The results 
showed significant correlations between behavior and all 
personality and mental health states studied except for 
openness. This research provides insights into the analysis of 
personality and mental health states in the working settings. 
More broadly, the methodology proposed in this research 
provides implications for the development of recognition 
systems that will facilitate the attainment of personal and 
collective goals, which proves highly useful in today’s 
increasingly technicized societies. 
Keywords - human behavior; sensory technology; mental 
health; personality 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The wide study of personality theory and mental health 
has opened new research directions through the use of 
sensorial technology to better understand personnel 
psychology [1]. Companies are increasingly aiming to 
develop their human workforce performance by studying 
their employees‟ individual characteristics. Robbins [2] 
identified four individual-level variables, i.e. biographical 
characteristics, ability, personality, and learning, which have 
effects on employee performance and satisfaction. 
Since the use of questionnaire-based objective tests for 
both personality and mental health has been widely 
established [3], the time required for employers and 
employees to carry out such questionnaires has increasingly 
become wasteful and troublesome. On the other hand, recent 
technology enables to visualize office workers‟ interactions 
[4], 
identify human 
behavior 
within 
organizational 
situations and obtain associated tacit knowledge [5][6] 
without privacy intrusion or major burden. 
The purpose of this study was to propose a sensor-based 
methodology to estimate behavior, and to further 
demonstrate existing correlations between employee‟s 
estimated behavior and mental health and personality traits. 
Building on the aforementioned findings, this study 
provides conclusions involving personality traits and mental 
health in the working setting with a minimum required 
burden from both employers and employees. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II contains an 
overview of related personality and mental health studies in 
the workplace. In Section III, it is proposed a methodology 
to estimate behavior based on sensory data, which was used 
in Section IV to analyze the relationship with personality 
and mental health. Section V includes some discussion 
points, and finally, Section VI presents conclusions, a 
summary of the paper, and future work. 
II. 
RESEARCH ON PERSONALITY AND MENTAL HEALTH 
Personality has been defined as the characteristic manner 
in which one thinks, feels, behaves, and relates to others [7]. 
Robbins [2] claimed that all our behavior is at some extent 
explained by our personalities and experiences. Traits in 
personality psychology have been used to describe 
consistent inter-correlated behavior patterns [8]. The study 
of personality traits has increased the understanding of the 
differences between people‟s behavior in order to explain 
how certain personality traits better adapt for certain job 
types [2][9], how personality relates to the effective 
performance of teams [9][10][11], and how personality is a 
component of motivation [12].  
With similar attention, mental health in the workplace 
has also been studied. A study has concluded that adverse 
psychosocial work conditions are predictors of depression 
worsening [13]. This result was independent from 
personality traits analyses, and demonstrated the importance 
of the study of mental health alone. Also, the impact of job 
stress and working conditions on mental health problems

[14], and the relation between job satisfaction and the Five 
Factor model [15][16] has been studied.  
A. Personality traits in this study 
Although there is a general consensus over the Big Five 
being a general framework for assessing personality traits, 
this study has included in addition to those in the Big Five, 
the Locus of Causality, the General Causality Orientation, 
the Self Monitoring, and the Type A traits in order to 
present a more comprehensive assessment of personality. 
The Five Factor Model (FFM) is a taxonomy, or 
descriptive model of personality traits organized at the 
broadest level of abstraction in five factors or dimensions 
named: 
extraversion 
or 
surgency, 
agreeableness, 
conscientiousness, emotional stability versus neuroticism, 
and intellect or openness [8]. These traits became eventually 
known as the Big Five [17]. Extraversion describes traits 
relating energy, dominance, sociability, and positive 
emotions. Agreeableness includes traits such as altruism, 
tender-mindness, trust and modesty, defining a prosocial 
orientation towards others. Conscientiousness summarizes 
traits which facilitate goal-directed behavior. Neuroticism 
describes anxiety, sadness or irritability, contrasting 
emotional stability. Finally, openness describes the depth of 
an individual‟s mental and experiential life [18]. 
Locus of Causality traits are related to the motivation 
factor of an individual and it examines the source of the 
motivation when engaging on an activity. Locus of 
Causality‟s intrinsic motivation refers to doing something 
because it is inherently interesting, fun, or enjoyable. On the 
other hand, extrinsic motivation refers to doing something 
because it leads to a separable outcome, or because it 
responds to external demands. Each motivation trait has two 
secondary scales. Secondary scales for intrinsic motivation 
are enjoyment and challenge. Challenge orientation is 
related to problem-solving, while enjoyment orientation is 
related to writing and art involvement. Secondary scales for 
extrinsic motivation are outward and compensation scales. 
Outward motivation entails personal endorsement and a 
feeling of choice. Compensation, on the other hand, merely 
involves compliance with an external control [19][20].  
General Causality Orientation is referred as the 
individual differences that can be characterized in terms of 
people‟s understanding of the nature of causation of 
behavior [21]. In other words, these traits characterize the 
degree to which human behaviors are volitional or self-
determined. There are three causality orientations, namely, 
autonomy, control, and impersonal orientation. Autonomy 
orientation trait involves a high degree of experienced 
choice related to the initiation and regulation of one‟s own 
behavior. Control orientation trait involves people‟s 
behavior following controls either in the environment or 
inside themselves. Impersonal orientation trait involves 
people experiencing their behavior as being beyond their 
intentional control [21]. 
Self-Monitoring people are described as showing 
considerable adaptability and behavior flexibility to external 
factors, being capable of behave differently in different 
situations [2]. 
Type A personality is the trait describing people which is 
aggressively involved to achieve more in less time. Highly 
rated Type A people are highly competitive, cannot cope 
with leisure time, and are continuously measuring their 
success [2]. 
B. Mental health in this study 
The mental health states considered for this study were 
depression and happiness. Although these states could be 
related to a general happiness scale, in this study the term 
mental health was used to describe each of them. The 
viewpoint from which these traits were analyzed was to 
relate depression, and stress, against job satisfaction 
characterized by happiness in the workplace.  
C. Personality and mental health measurement 
Objective tests have been firmly established as the 
preferred personality measuring method [3], and it has also 
been used to assess mental health. However, it has been 
pointed out that several issues relating to this method may 
jeopardize its efficacy. Measuring methods have failed to 
accurately reflect the dynamics of personality and mental 
health [22][23]. As individuals‟ behavior is not constant 
from situation to situation, the associated personality and 
mental health will also be continuously shaped by 
experiences. Another concern is the increasing number of 
inventories and scales offered, for which a huge amount of 
time and effort would be required for its completion [8]. 
On the other hand, recent technology enables to make 
inferences about office workers‟ interactions [4], and obtain 
associated tacit knowledge [5][6], without privacy intrusion 
or major burden. The use of these approaches may be a 
mechanism to cope with issues regarding the use of 
objective tests [8][22][24] in the assessment of mental 
health and personality traits. 
III. 
STUDY 1: ESTIMATION OF BEHAVIOR BASED ON 
SENSORY DATA 
This first study proposed a methodology to estimate 
human behavior at the workplace based on objective data 
measured by sensors. An experiment was done in order to 
investigate the possibility of identifying certain human 
behavioral expressions based on sensory data.  
A. Participants 
Two male participants volunteered for this experiment. 
Participants were aged 25 and 44, and were all capable of 
moving freely. 
B. Apparatus 
Business Microscope (BM) [6] developed by Hitachi 
Corporation was used in this experiment. BM, shown in 
Figure 1 being worn as a name tag, records data from the

user‟s acceleration, face-to-face (IR), temperature, and voice 
intensity sensors. 
 
 
Figure 1. Hitachi‟s Business Microscope. 
C. Procedure 
Each participant wore a BM device and acted out 
different behaviors switching them from one to another for 2 
hours as if they were engaging in daily office working 
activities. The characterized behavior categories were desk 
working, talking, walking, and not-working related 
behaviors like sleeping, eating-drinking, or simply being 
unoccupied. These last were grouped into a single category 
hereafter referred as idle.  
D. Measurements 
For the purpose of this study, this experiment only used 
acceleration and voice intensity sensory raw data with a 
sampling frequency of 50 Hz. Due to privacy concerns and 
to a limitation of energy consumption, each datum was 
observed for 2s long and was acquired once every 10s. The 
data captured by the device was wirelessly transferred to a 
server where it was stored for later use.  
While acting out behavior categories, participants 
marked the time, the location, the posture, and the behavior 
being acted. 
E. Results 
Sensor data chosen from each behavior category was 
plotted for analysis to reveal distinctive characteristics 
representing each acted behavior. This information served to 
build a method with which behavior was estimated. The 
estimated behavior was compared with the participants‟ 
actual behavior by finding out hit and false alarm rates. A 
hit was defined by corresponding predicted and actual 
behaviors. False alarm on the contrary was defined by a 
mismatch between them. 
A graphic method, the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
(ROC), was used to evaluate and compare the performances 
of signal-noise discrimination [25]. ROC was used to 
portray the optimal criteria to detect behaviors and to select 
the most effective prediction thresholds.  
 
1) Behavior detection criteria 
For the walking category, the amplitude and the 
frequency of the oscillations of acceleration data were 
calculated. The amplitude of the curve was calculated by 
subtracting the curve‟s minimum data value from the 
maximum data value. As for the number of oscillations of 
the curve, it was used the zero crossing method. The zero 
cross line was determined as the data‟s average line. The 
number of times the curve crossed the zero-crossing line 
were added up to obtain the curve‟s frequency.  
Sound intensity curve was represented by temporal 
changes of sound volume. The data‟s mean and the standard 
deviation were calculated and used to obtain thresholds for 
data characterized by sound representing a talking behavior. 
For desk working behavior, back and forth acceleration 
data was investigated. It was found that the mean of 
acceleration data at time t, and the mean of acceleration data 
at time t-10s, tended to be comparable. As differences in 
mean values of these succeeding two time points were 
limited in range, it was assumed that such behavior 
corresponded to small posture changes as those displayed by 
desk working behavior. Upper and lower limits were 
calculated, and data found within this range was regarded as 
describing desk working behavior category. 
As for the idle behavior category, the acceleration data‟s 
frequency of vibration was analyzed. The most suitable data 
for analysis was found along the vertical direction; therefore

the zero crossing number was used to calculate this 
behavior‟s data frequency along that axis.  
 
2) Sequential detection method 
The hit rates and false alarm rates for each behavior 
category are shown in Table I. Also, ROC curves for each 
behavior category are shown in Figure 2. The variance of 
dots in each graph represents the performance of criteria 
using various threshold combinations. The results showed 
that the best detection performance (represented by a red 
dot) was found in the following order: walking behavior 
category, followed by talking, desk working, and idle 
behavior. Consequently, it was considered a sequential 
detection order through which the sensitivity of each 
detection method was set as the detection order priority [25]. 
Thus, walking behavior was the first category to be detected 
from the entire sensor data set. From the remaining data, 
talking behavior was detected, then desk working, and 
finally idle behavior category.

IV. 
STUDY 2: STUDY OF PERSONALITY AND MENTAL 
HEALTH BASED ON BEHAVIOR DATA 
The purpose of this study was to analyze the 
relationships among behavior estimated through the method 
proposed in Section III, and personality and mental health. 
An experiment was conducted, and a correlation analysis 
was done in order to validate that sensory data can be used 
to assess personality and mental health. 
A. Participants 
Ninety two Japanese participants, 77 males and 15 
females, ranging between 21 and 61 years old (M = 35.93, 
SD = 8.50), who worked as software developers at a certain 
company volunteered for the experiment. They were all 
capable of moving freely and perform routine office 
activities. The participants of this experiment were not 
familiar with what kind of measurements were being 
executed, and further agreed to provide individual 
psychological states information. 
B. Apparatus 
The apparatus for this study were the same as those used 
in study one. Refer to Section III. 
C. Procedure 
Participants wore individual BM devices every working 
day for 71 days, time in which they engaged in normal daily 
working activities. Participants‟ behavior was detected 
according to the procedure explained in Section III. Also 
participants conducted 8 sets of questionnaires, 5 relating 
personality, and 3 more relating mental health.  
D. Measurements 
To assess the big five personality, the Big Five Inventory 
[18], which consisted of 44 items, was used. The Work 
Preference Inventory (WPI) which consists of 30 items was 
used to assess Locus of Causality [20]. The 12-item General 
Causality Orientation Scale Questionnaire (GCOS) was 
used to assess General Causality Orientation [21]. It was 
also used the Self-Monitoring trait questionnaire developed 
by Lennox and Wolfe [26], and the Type A questionnaire 
developed by Bortner [27].  
As for mental health, two scales for depression and one 
for happiness were used. The Center for Epidemiology 
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was developed by 
Radloff [28], and consisted of 20 items. Also the Beck 
Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) was used. 
The BDI-II is a 21 items self-administered questionnaire 
assessing the severity of depression in adults and 
adolescents [29]. The last mental health state studied was 
satisfaction. The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) 
was used to assess this state [30]. 
E. Results 
This study considered unitary behavior samples and 
behavior events as measurement units. A behavior sample 
was defined as each datum in a set of data corresponding to 
an estimated behavior category (one sample per 10s). A 
behavior event was defined as the sequential group of two 
or more samples under the same behavior category. A 
chronological summary showing the time series of estimated 
behavior samples and events was prepared for each 
participant. This summary indicated what type of behavior 
category a participant engaged in and for how long. 
 
1) Detected behavior 
Basic statistics of the behavior data collected are shown 
in Table II. After analyzing the number of behavior samples 
of the 92 participants, three outlier participants were 
excluded as they provided significantly less number of 
samples (< M – 2 x SD) due to their absence in the 
experimentation settings.

The results hereafter report data from the remaining 89 
participants, 74 males and 15 females (M = 36.07, SD = 
8.56). From the total number of detected samples, 28% were 
detected as walking, 15% as talking, 30% as desk working, 
and 21% were detected as idle behavior. There was a 5% of 
samples which could not be detected as any of the proposed 
behaviors. 
 
2) Personality and mental health results 
The results presented in Table III show the participants 
scores obtained through personality and mental health 
questionnaires. 
 
3) Behavior characteristic variables  
Characteristic variables were obtained for the behavior 
samples and events of individual participants. The behavior 
characteristic variables (BCVs) were represented by letters 
triplets and are summarized in Table IV. The first letter of 
each triplet represented the behavior categories. This is W, 
T, D, and I represented walking, talking, desk working, and 
idle behaviors, respectively. The second letters in a triplet 
were A, T, E, and D, and represented time instances. A as a 
triplet‟s second letter represented the entire time span. T as a 
triplet‟s second letter represented the time ratio per day. 
This ratio was obtained by dividing a given behavior 
total time over the total time in a day. The letter E as a 
triplet‟s second letter represented the number of events per 
day. The letter D as the second letter in a triplet represented 
the behavior events duration. If the second letter of the 
triplet was A, the third letters of a triplet were T or E. In this 
case T represented the time ratio, and E represented an event. 
However if the second letter of the triplet was T, E, or D, 
the third letter of a triplet could be A, D, or M, which stood 
for average, standard deviation, and median. 
Personalities like intrinsic or extrinsic motivation are 
estimated to be related to the variation of behavior. In order 
to assess this variation, the percentage of behavior-engaged 
time over all the experiment‟s time span and the number of 
events per day was calculated. It was also calculated the 
average, standard deviation and median of behavior-
engaged time (time ratio T and number of events E) per day.

The concept of absorption is important for some 
personality traits and it is considered to be strongly related 
with uninterrupted behavior engagement. Therefore the 
average, standard deviation and median of the time 
continuance of each behavior were also calculated (triplets 
with “D” as the second letter).  
 
4) Correlation among personality traits, mental health, 
and BCVs 
a) Big Five personality scores 
Big Five personality scores and BCVs combinations 
whose correlations were significant are shown in Table V. 
Extraversion showed positive correlation with walking 
behavior variables. It was also found negatively correlated 
with talking events (TEA, TEM) and desk working related 
variables (DAE, DAT, DEA, DTA, DTM). These results 
suggested that people who often walk, and often spent their 
time away from their desks were likely to be extraverted.  
 
b) Locus of Causality and subscales personality scores 
Intrinsic and extrinsic Locus of Causality personality 
scores and BCVs combinations whose correlations were 
significant are shown in Table VI and Table VII, 
respectively.

Locus of Causality variables were both positively and 
negatively correlated with BCVs. Talking related variables 
were negatively correlated with intrinsic Locus of Causality, 
and both of its subscales, enjoyment and challenge. It can be 
argued that intrinsically motivated people have a strong 
preference for working individually without talking or 
interacting with people around. However, as it is shown in 
Table VI, idle behavior variables were found positively 
correlated with challenge subscale alone. It might be argued 
that the nature of intrinsic Locus of Causality and challenge 
orientation, motivate these people to find time to think and 
reflect about their own initiatives. 
Intrinsic Locus of Causality and the challenge subscale 
correlated positively with idle BCVs IAT, ITA, ITD, ITM, 
IDA. It may be argued that the nature of intrinsic Locus of 
Causality and challenge-motivated people drives them to 
find time to think and reflect about their own initiatives.

The variation of the percentage of daily walking events 
(WED) showed a positive correlation with extrinsic 
personalities, and both of its subscales (extrinsic, r=.275, 
p<.01; outward, r=.217, p<.05; compensation, r=.250, 
p<.01). Also, walking variable WTD which referred to the 
variation of walking time in a day, correlated with challenge 
subscale. Building from these findings, it can be argued that 
intrinsic motivated participants walked longer by their 
challenging determination; however, although extrinsic 
participants walked more times, they tend to do it for shorter 
periods. 
Other results showed that extrinsic motivated people did 
not tend to stay in their desks or focus on their work for 
long periods as desk working related variables (DAT, DTA, 
DTM, DDM) were all negatively correlated with extrinsic 
Locus of Causality and compensation subscale. 
 
c) General Causality Orientation personality scores 
General Causality Orientation personality scores and 
BCVs combinations whose correlations were significant are 
shown in Table VIII. Talking related variables correlated 
negatively with the autonomy trait. On the other hand, 
impersonal trait correlated positively with desk working and 
idle behavior related variables. It can be argued that people 
who do not actively engage or face external circumstances 
tend to spend more time at their desks.

These results implied that people with high impersonal 
score, whose behavior is marked by decisions beyond their 
control, tend to follow directions as they are told. In other 
words, these people might not leave their desks or stop 
working. These findings are comparable to idle behavior 
variables being positively correlated with impersonal trait. It 
can be argued that as these people tend to stay at their desks, 
they might be able to loosen up, even in front of their desks.  
 
d) Self-Monitoring and Type A personality scores 
Self-Monitoring and Type A personality scores and 
BCVs combinations whose correlation were significant are 
shown in Table IX. Self-Monitoring personality was 
positively correlated with walking related variables (WAT, 
WTA, WTM, WDA, WDM). This suggested that people 
with high sociability skills, or those rating high in Self-
Monitoring, engage for longer periods in walking behavior. 
High Self-Monitoring rated people are able to show striking 
contradictions between their public persona and their private 
self [2]. Thus, by the fact that Self-Monitoring correlated 
negatively with talking related variables (TEA, TEM) it can 
be argued that even though these people regulate their 
behavior by walking or interacting with others, they might 
be reluctant to show their opinions by an apprehension of 
social disapproval.  
Type A trait correlated positively with the number of 
walking events per day (WEM). This suggested that people 
who tended to walk more often are likely to be competitive 
or involved in achieving more in less time. It might be 
argued that these people are often walking around, looking 
for self-improving opportunities.

e) Mental health scores 
Mental health scores and BCVs combinations whose 
correlations were significant are shown in Table X. Both 
depression scales utilized in this study presented similar 
results which highlighted positive correlation with talking, 
desk working, and idle behavior related variables (TEA, 
TEM, DAE, DEA, DEM, IEA). These results suggested that 
people who more often engaged in talking, desk working, 
and idle behaviors present higher depression or stress scores. 
Given that BDI-II depression scale positively correlated 
with walking idle events related variables (WEA, IEM) it 
can be argued that both, unoccupied behavior people or 
persistently walking people, might display high work 
depression or stress.

The OHQ results showed that participants who highly 
engaged in walking behavior rated high in satisfaction 
(WDA). On the contrary, results also showed that high 
talking, and desk working behavior people often showed 
frustration or discontent (TAE, TAT, TEA, TEM, TTA, 
TTM, TDM, DAE, DEA, DEM). It can be argued that 
people who talked for longer periods, would be able to cope 
with dissatisfaction.  
V. 
DISCUSSION 
Personality information is important for managers as 
they can make more educated decisions on how to conform 
teams, based on their members‟ characteristics. This 
research provided a methodology that provides up-to-date 
personality information. This is most important since the 
evaluation of such teams can be tracked along time. Until 
now, this was only possible through a pervasive policy of 
personality assessment that would demand great effort and 
time for both employers and employees.  
Mental health information is also of great importance for 
managers as provides a clear sight of the mental condition 
of their workforce. The methodology proposed in this study 
presented a real-time assessment of mental health which is 
most important for immediate actions can be taken in order 
to prevent the worsening of the condition, and the potential 
dissemination to nearby environments.  
This study used the personality and mental health 
questionnaires as the affect ascertaining method. As it has 
been discussed, the use of questionnaires describes a 
number of concerns. Nevertheless, what has been argued as 
a benefit of the use of questionnaires (greater choice) is a 
major weakness; the use of questionnaires allows for 
questionnaire items' omission or misrepresentation, thus 
affecting the overall effectiveness and goals of the 
assessment. This limitation affects the informant him/herself 
who is the ultimate beneficiary of the research efforts. In 
addition, the subjective nature of these questionnaires 
impedes the elucidation of an individual‟s self perception of 
personality, as opposed to the external perception of an 
individual‟s 
personality. 
The 
improvement 
of 
the 
methodology for assessing personality and mental health 
described in this research is essential, as it meliorates theses 
psychological states estimation and lessens the impact of the 
discussed issues regarding the use of questionnaires. 
The application of personality and mental health inside 
an outside the working settings present various application 
opportunities. It has been claimed that one of the most 
important issues in organizations, is to understand how the 
productivity of its workforce could be improved. One reason 
hindering this understanding is that interactions of 
nowadays organization can be barely visualized, and 
therefore it is complex to find out problems between 
employees‟ relations. In this study it was presented a 
methodology through which the behavior of employees 
could be visualized, and further used to have a better 
understanding of their psychological states.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The present study proposed a methodology to estimate 
personality from sensory data information. However studies 
pertaining personality with emphasis to the workplace are 
numerous, the established measuring method used by those 
studies were questionnaire tests. This study built up a clear 
methodology through which personality is estimated

unobtrusively and without the need of questionnaires, 
through the use of acceleration and voice sensory 
information.  
In Study 1 it was effectively detected walking, talking, 
desk working, and idle behaviors. In Study 2, the correlation 
analysis showed significant correlations between behavior 
and all personality and mental health traits studied except 
for openness. While some personality variables showed 
significant correlation with a greater extent of behavior 
variables (extraversion, intrinsic motivation, challenge, and 
happiness), other personality variables showed significant 
correlation with fewer (agreeableness, conscientiousness, 
neuroticism, control orientation, outward, Type A). On the 
other hand, the behavior category which showed significant 
correlation with the greater number of personality variables 
was desk working behavior category  revealing 31 
significant correlations; while the behavior category which 
showed significant correlation with the least number of 
personality variables was idle category  showing only 18 
significant correlations.  
The results in this study suggest that it is possible to 
effortlessly assess personality and mental health, respecting 
the privacy of employees, and without the need of 
questionnaires. What has been argued as a benefit of the use 
of questionnaires (greater choice) is a major weakness; the 
use of questionnaires allows for questionnaire items' 
omission or misrepresentation, thus affecting the overall 
effectiveness and goals of the assessment. This limitation 
affects the informant himself who is the ultimate beneficiary 
of the research efforts. Furthermore, personality is 
continuously shaped by experiences, and thus questionnaires 
are limited to cope with personality‟s changing nature. As 
the methodology presented in this study is set by 
continuously loading data, the personality and mental health 
information obtained will always provide up-to-date 
information. In addition, saving employers‟ and employees‟ 
time, is yet another benefit proposed by this study, which 
opens a new behavior estimation research direction, and 
thus its continuation is essential. Future studies should 
deepen this study‟s findings: it should consider additional 
working settings; the improvement of the behavior detection 
method including participants from both genders, and a 
larger set of behavior categories.
