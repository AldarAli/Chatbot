Abstract—Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technologies have been widely
applied in various network applications, such as BitTorrent,
P2Plive, Skype, etc. Improving the performance of P2P networks
has always been a topic of interest. The key to improving P2P
networks is to solve the consistency problem, which states that the
overlay network topology is not congruent to the physical network
topology. The overlay network is a logical network topology built
on existing physical networks. If overlay networks are constructed
according to the location of peers, the consistency problem could
be solved. In this paper, locality-aware Chord P2P networks based
on cloud-assistance are proposed. A cloud database of mapping
IP addresses onto geographical positions is built to completely
manage the locality information of peers. Four new schemes
of identiﬁcation (ID) assignments associated with geographical
positions of peers have been designed to construct the rings of
Chord networks. The arrangement of peers on a ring is close
to their physical positions. As a result, unnecessary searching
routing can be reduced. Besides, a new download method which
can select the nearest nodes to get resources has also been
designed. The simulation experiments show the searching and
downloading performance of our proposed locality-aware Chord
networks can be improved.

INTRODUCTION
The ways of sharing resources are diverse, from tradi-
tional client-server model to peer-to-peer (P2P) and cloud-
based models. Recently, P2P and cloud-based models have
appeared in more and more network applications. Compared
to P2P networks, cloud services can provide more scalable
storage and computing power. However, for a successful cloud-
based resource sharing, enough network bandwidth between
user nodes and cloud systems is necessary. Besides, the
use of P2P networks might be more convenient than cloud
services because peers can join P2P networks without any
authentication. Therefore, there still exist many popular P2P
network applications, such as BitTorrent-like P2P systems [1],
PPLive [2], and PPStream [3].
Two basic operations of P2P networks are searching and
downloading processes. Peers need to search the desired re-
source by overlay network [4] to ﬁnd which peer owns the
resource and then download it directly. The overlay network is
a logical network topology built on existing physical networks
by logically connecting all of joining peers. In general, the
edge of the overlay network is set up by a Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) connection. A long-latency delay may
exist at the edges of the overlay network because the overlay
network topology is not congruent to the physical network
topology.
Figure 1. Triangle searching path.
Well-known peer-to-peer systems for ﬁle sharing are pro-
posed in Napster [5] and Guntella [6]. The directory of the
shared ﬁles is managed by a centralized server in Napster. The
system scalability and single-point failure problem exist in the
Napster system due to the centralized management. Guntella
P2P system is also suffering from scalability problems because
the message for locating a resource needs to be ﬂooding
over the overlay network. The more nodes in the system, the
more ﬂooding trafﬁc could occur. To overcome the scalability
problems, some structured P2P based on Distributed Hash
Tables (DHT), such as Chord [7], CAN [8], and Tapestry [9],
have been proposed. Each joining peer and the shared resource
are given an unique identiﬁer (ID) respectively generated
by the same DHT hash function. The overlay networks are
constructed as a tree or ring network topology by the IDs of
peers. The information of the shared resources, such as the IP
addresses of the owners, are distributed over the joining peers
in load balance. In a DHT-based P2P system, a searching query
message can be forwarded to its destination within ⃝(logN)
hops on overlay networks, where N is the number of nodes
in the P2P system.
Although the DHT-based P2P systems have the advantage
of scalability, the locality information of joining peers is not
considered in construction of overlay networks. The consis-
tency problem still exists and unnecessary triangle routing in
physical networks could occur during the searching process.
In a DHT-based P2P system, a searching query message is
forwarded to the next peer until the owner(s) of resource is(are)
found. There must exist a searching routing path for each
resource query. An example is shown in Figure 1. On the
routing path (ni, ni+1, ni+2, · · · , nj), the distance (ni, ni+1)
should not be longer than the distance (ni, ni+2) in physical
networks. It is obvious that the distance (nj−3, nj−2) is longer
than the distance (nj−3, nj−1). We refer to this kind of
unnecessary routing as triangle routing. The more triangle
routing events occur in resource searching, the more delays
and network bandwidth is wasted.

In the literature, many related works [10]-[14] attempted
to solve the consistency problem by building topology-aware
overlay networks with the assistance of locality information of
peers, such as Autonomous System (AS), or Internet Service
Provider (ISP) peers belong to. The improvement of these
works is limited due to lack of precise locality information
of nodes. In [14], a packet loss module installed on routers
is given the ability to recognize P2P trafﬁc and ﬁnd out
the AS and ISP to which packets belong. When the source
and destination IP addresses of P2P packets are not at the
same AS or ISP, the packet loss module will drop them
with a predetermined probability. This way, peers have a high
probability to get resources from their nearby peers and data
trafﬁc across different ISPs (or ASs) could be reduced.
Cloud-assisted P2P network applications in [15]-[17] have
been proposed in the literature. They focus on some speciﬁc
P2P applications but the fundamental problems of P2P net-
works are not further discussed. In [15], cloud services are
applied to improve the transmission quality of P2P streaming.
In [16], a reliable P2P-based service-oriented architecture is
proposed by cloud-assistance. To provide successful resource
reservation, the cloud system maintains the capabilities of
peers, such as computing power, storage space, and network
bandwidth. Resource reservations can be successful by several
redundant resources from selected peers. In [17], the cloud
system is used to handle spikes in the query of a popular
resource. The queries of peers will automatically be transferred
to the cloud system to seek popular resources when the load
of peers is over the predeﬁned threshold.
The P2P consistency problem can be efﬁciently improved
if the locality information of all joining peers is known. A
simple way of managing locality information is by having
centralized dedicated servers, but the single point of failure,
overloading, and scalability problems can not be avoided. One
of the best solution is to migrate locality information of joining
nodes from traditional servers to a cloud system with scalable
storage and computing power. To completely manage locality
information of joining nodes, a free database GeoLiteCity [18]
is adopted for mapping IP addresses onto geographical posi-
tions. When peers join the system, geographical positions of
peers are mapped by a query of GeoLiteCity and saved in
another database.
In this paper, we focus on improving the Chord P2P
networks based on cloud-assistance. In the original Chord
system, a logical ring network topology is constructed in
increasing order of IDs of peers in a clockwise direction. A
peer can ﬁnd its predecessor and successor to join the ring
of Chord networks according to its ID number generated by a
hash function. In fact, the logical position of a peer on the ring
depends on its ID number without any concern of its locality
information. As a result, the consistency problem can not be
controlled. In our proposed locality-aware Chord networks, we
have designed new strategies of ID assignments according to
geographical positions to have an arrangement of peers on a
ring approximately close in their physical positions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The proposed
system model based on cloud-assistance is described in the
next Section. The locality-aware Chord networks with new
schemes of ID assignments are given in Section III. The perfor-
mance of resource searching and downloading in our proposed
Figure 2. Chord networks with cloud-assistance.
Chord networks is evaluated by simulations in Section IV.
Finally, some concluding remarks and future work are given
in Section V.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL BASED ON CLOUD COMPUTING
The proposed locality-aware Chord networks are designed
on the basis of our previous work. In [19], we have imple-
mented a locality-aware unstructured P2P network using a
cloud-assisted platform. A free database GeoLiteCity is built
on Hadoop [20] cloud system for mapping IP addresses onto
geographical positions referred to as locality information of
peers. On that platform, two kinds of peers are implemented,
namely P2P agent and Cloud Gateway (CG) node. The CG
node with more computing power and network bandwidth can
be the interface between peers and the cloud system. A P2P
agent, which is a general peer, can request the CG node to
upload its IP address to the cloud system. The geographical
position of a peer can be gained by a query of GeoLiteCity
using its IP address and then maintained in the cloud system.
In this paper, we focus on improving Chord networks based
on the cloud-assisted platform. The system architecture of the
proposed locality-aware Chord networks is shown in Figure 2.
Due to the maintenance of geographical positions of all
peers, peer can select the nearest resource owner instead of
random selection from searching result to download. This is
because the nearest resource owner can be found by computing
and sorting the physical distance between the requesting peer
and owners of resource in our cloud-assisted platform.
Besides, the bidirectional searching algorithm proposed
in [21] is adopted in our proposed Chord networks. According
to the ID of a resource, a peer can search the owners of a
resource in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction on Chord
networks from ﬁnger tables [21] maintained by peers. The
logical hop count of searching path can be reduced on average.
III.
LOCALITY-AWARE CHORD NETWORKS
Considering the locality information of peers, four schemes
of ID assignments of peers in the proposed locality-aware
Chord networks are designed as follows.
A. Longitude Positioning with ID Exchange
The simplest way of arranging peers on a ring is to map
peers onto the equator, which is a natural ring on earth.
According to the longitude degrees of peers, peers can be
projected onto the equator to form a clockwise ring from East
to West longitude. Figure 3 shows an example of a Chord
network constructed by four peers and three default CG nodes
on the equator.

Figure 3. Longitude positioning Chord networks.
Figure 4. ID assignment of global positioning hash.
In our proposed cloud-assisted platform, the geographical
positions of all peers are maintained in the cloud system. The
ring of Chord networks can be constructed by the order of
longitude degrees of peers. Since the original IDs of peers
are generated by a hash function, the increasing order of IDs
of peers might not be consistent with it of longitude degrees
of peers. However, the consistency problem can be solved by
exchanging IDs of peers.
Now, we describe the scheme of Longitude Positioning
with ID Exchange (LPIDE) as follows. When a new joining
peer is coming to the system, the predecessor and successor of
the peer on a ring onto the equator can be easily computed by
the cloud system. Simultaneously, the increasing order of IDs
in the Chord network can be also veriﬁed. Once the increasing
order of IDs is violated, the cloud system will inform the
related peers to exchange IDs for solving the consistency
problem. Two peers can exchange their IDs by exchanging
their predecessors, successors, and ﬁnger tables in constant
time.
B. Global Positioning Hash
The scheme of longitude positioning with ID exchange can
not distinguish peers with the same longitude degrees. As a
result, these peers could be neighbors on a ring mapping on
the equator whereas some distance may exist among them.
In addition, exchanging IDs of peers may often incur extra
overhead.
To improve the lack described as above, a new scheme
referred to as Global Positioning Hash (GPH) is proposed.
It provides a new ID assignment of peers according to the
geographical positions of peers such that the arrangement of
peers on a ring approximately close in their physical positions.
The new ID of a peer is composed of two parts as shown
in Figure 4. The second part (i.e., low signiﬁcant bits) is
generated by a hash function of IP address, which is the same
as in the original Chord networks. The second part makes the
ID of peers unique, even peers have the same geographical
positions. The ﬁrst part (i.e., most signiﬁcant bits), denoted by
ID(Global Position), is deﬁned by the function of geographical
position including longitude and latitude degrees, as shown in
equation(1).
Figure 5. Triple rings Chord networks.
ID(Global Position) = ⌈(a + 180) ∗ 200 + (b + 90)⌉ (1)
where a is longitude degrees and b is latitude degrees.
The ﬁrst part of the ID decides the order of peers on
the ring of Chord networks. The idea of equation (1) is to
map geographical positions of peers onto a ﬁrst quadrant in
two-dimension plane, and then execute a linear transformation
by sum of the scaled longitude degrees and latitude degrees.
This makes sure ID(Global Position) is a positive and an
unique integer. The equation (1) reﬂects relative locations of
peers. According to the IDs generated by the GPH scheme,
the arrangement of peers on a ring could be approximately
close in their physical positions. Unnecessary triangle routing
of resource searching could be reduced.
C. Triple rings with Chord
Peers could be from anywhere in the world. The searching
performance may suffer in Chord networks with a single ring
due to the distribution of peers in physical location. The
scheme of Triple Rings with Chord (TRC) is designed to
distribute load from a single ring to the three rings of Chord
networks.
Peers join one of the three rings in Chord networks
according to their location. Considering most of Earth’s land
is located on Northern Hemisphere, the three rings are planed
as shown in Figure 5. The ﬁrst ring is formed by the peers
at above (or equal to) 23.5◦N, the second ring is constructed
by the peers at between 23.5◦N and 23.5◦S, and the peers at
under (or equal to) 23.5◦S can join the third ring.
Each joining peer can upload its IP address to the cloud
system by a random CG node to ﬁnd which ring it has to be
joining. In this scheme, each ring is constructed in the same
way as it is in the original Chord networks. To improve the
searching performance, the way of publishing a new resource
is adapted. When a new resource is published on one of the
three rings, it would be published on the other two rings by
the assistance of a random CG node.
D. Triple rings with global positioning hash
The scheme of Triple Rings with Global Positioning Hash
(TRGPH) is a hybrid scheme of TRC and GPH schemes. Peers
can join one of the three rings according to their physical
locations but each of ring is constructed by the scheme of
global positioning hash.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, simulations are performed to study the
performance of our proposed locality-aware Chord networks.
A. Simulation Environment
To simulate Internet topology, the topology generator
IGen [22] is used to generate random graphs mapped onto
real Earth and modeled by Waxman [23]. Nodes are only
distributed on Earth’s land and the distance between two
connected peers is deﬁned by their geographical distance. The
simulation programs are written in Java language.
In the system initialization, there are eight kinds of ﬁle
resources to be shared and each of them is owned by three
different random peers in the system. Peers may join or leave
the P2P system in our experiment. The times of peers joining
the P2P system form a Poisson process. The mean time of a
peer joining the system is 10 minutes. The lifetimes of peers
in the P2P system form an exponential distribution. The mean
lifetime of peers is two hours. For each data point in our
experiment, 10 random graphs are generated and 5000 queries
for requesting a random resource from eight kinds of ﬁles are
performed in each graph. The times of queries from random
peers in the P2P system form a Poisson process. The mean
time of a query happened is twenty minutes.

B. Simulation Results
The performance of Chord networks can be evaluated by
the cost of resource searching and downloading.
During the searching process, a query message is forwarded
on a logical ring network to ﬁnd out where the owner(s) of
a resource is(are), and then the response message including
searching result will be returned. Due to the consistency
problem, long distance and more than one routers may ex-
ist between two neighboring peers. In our simulation, the
physical distance and number of routers that the query and
response messages are traveling during the searching process
are referred to as the searching distance and physical hops,
respectively.
Figure 6 shows the average searching distance in our ﬁrst
two proposed schemes for different number of nodes in the
networks. Compared to the original Chord system, the search-
ing distance of our proposed two schemes are shorter than
that of the original Chord system. This is because the locality
information is considered, and then unnecessary searching
routes could be reduced.
The ratio of triangle routing is calculated to evaluate how
congruent the overlay network is with and physical network
topology. For each query message, every three contiguous
peers along its routing path, the triangle routing event is ver-
iﬁed and statistically counted to compute the ratio of triangle
routing. Figure 7 shows the GPH scheme has lower ratio of

triangle routing than the other two schemes in most situations.
This phenomenon also veriﬁes that the searching distance for
GPH scheme is shorter than that of LPIDE scheme. It is worth
noting that the ratio of triangle routing for global positioning
hash is still larger than 45%.
Considering the distribution of peers, triple rings are de-
signed in our proposed Chord networks. Figure 8 and Figure 9
show the average number of physical hops and distance re-
spectively for all of the proposed schemes in different number
of nodes. From these two ﬁgures, we can observe that the
performance of GPH scheme is still better than that of TRC
scheme. Since the way of constructing logical rings in TRC
scheme is still the same as it in the original Chord system,
the improvement of consistency problem is limited. These two
ﬁgures also show the performance of TRGPH scheme is better
than that of the others. This is because load can be distributed
into different rings and simultaneously the order of peers on
logical rings is decided by their geographical positions.
The time necessary for the searching process can be deﬁned
as the propagation delay plus the queuing delay when the
transmission time of messages is ignored. The propagation
delay can be computed by the searching distance divided by
the signal speed, 2∗108 km/s. In our simulation, the queuing
delay of messages elapsed at the routers on the Internet is
modeled by an exponential distribution and the mean time
is 240 ms. Figure 10 shows the average searching time for
all of the proposed methods in different number of nodes.

The simulation results are similar with those measured by the
metrics of physical hops and distance. The average searching
time for TRGPH is less than 120 ms compared to the original
Chord system when the number of nodes is 3000 in the
networks. In summary, the performance of TRGPH scheme
is better than the others.
From Figures 6, 8, 9 and 10, we can observe the perfor-
mance increases to its worse maximum at 3000 nodes and
then it decreases. This phenomenon is the effect of number of
on-line peers and the distribution of peers locations in network
topology. Before the end of simulation, almost all of nodes are
on-line when the number of nodes in the networks is less than
3000, while more peers are off-line when number of nodes in
the networks is starting from 3000 to 5000. Peers need to take
more cost to ﬁnd their required resources when the number of
off-line peers suddenly increases. From the Figure 8, we can
see that the difference of physical hops between 2000 nodes
and 3000 nodes is more than 4 but the difference of physical
hops for 3000 to 5000 nodes is less than 1 for the original
Chord system. The minor difference for the later is due to the
distribution of peers locations in network topology.
From the searching result, a peer could directly get the
resource from the owners without the help of overlay networks.
The cost of downloading can be deﬁned as the physical hop
count, or distance between the requesting peer to the resource
owner. In our proposed Chord networks, peer can ﬁnd the
resource owner which is the nearest physical distance from
it by cloud-assisted platform. In our simulation, the cost of
downloading is evaluated by selecting the nearest peer to get
a resource instead of randomly selecting from the searching
result.
Peers can ﬁnd the nearest resource owner by cloud as-
sistance whenever the ways of ID assignment are adopted in
our proposed schemes. In our simulation, the performance
of downloading is the same for all of the proposed meth-
ods except the original Chord system. It is worth noting
that the nearest resource owner is deﬁned by the minimum
geographical distance between the requesting peer and the
resource owner instead of the shortest path between them in
the networks. The performance value measured by such a peer
with shortest path from the requesting peer is viewed as the
optimal value in our simulation.
Figure 11, Figure 12, and Figure 13 show the physical hops,

proposed methods is close to the optimal solution and better
than the original Chord system.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, locality-aware Chord P2P networks based
on cloud-assistance are proposed. Four new schemes of ID
assignments associated with geographical positions of peers
have been designed. The arrangement of peers on the rings
constructed by our proposed methods is approximately close
in their physical positions. The ratio of unnecessary triangle
routing in the searching process can be reduced. In addition,
a new download method which can select the nearest nodes
to get resources has also been designed. The simulation
experiments show the TRGPH scheme has better performance
than the others.
The ID assignments of our proposed schemes only consider
the physical locations of peers but the free database Geo-
LiteCity could not provide precise enough physical locations of
peers. In the future, the other IP-geolocation mapping schemes,
such as in [25]-[26], will be considered to design the schemes
of ID assignments to improve the performance. In addition, the
real life networks from the data sets [27] will be adopted in our
simulation experiments to compare the performance affected
by network topologies and distribution of peers locations.
