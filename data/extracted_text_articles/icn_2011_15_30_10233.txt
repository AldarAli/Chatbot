Abstract—Through its support for multi-homing, the Stream 
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a suitable solution to 
implement and manage user’s mobility by abstracting multiple 
physical paths into a single end-to-end association. In order to 
detect the primary path failure, SCTP uses a strategy defined 
in the RFC2960 and mainly based on a retransmission time out 
(RTO). When a number of retransmission failures occur on the 
primary path, switchover procedure is initiated which means 
that a new primary path will be selected among the available 
secondary paths. In this paper, we investigate the current 
switchover mechanism implemented in SCTP and detail some 
of its deficiencies which affect the use of SCTP in a WLAN 
environment. Then we propose a new path failure detection 
strategy designed to perform path management more 
efficiently in wireless environment, by preempting path failure 
and avoiding service interruption. Finally, we outline the 
testing of this new strategy in the context of a WLAN 
environment and the results are compared to those obtained 
when using the standard SCTP strategy.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [7] 
was initially developed by the Internet Engineering Task 
Force (IETF) to transport signaling messages over IP 
networks. Compared to other transport protocols like TCP 
and UDP, SCTP provides additional features which are 
multi-homing and multi-streaming. These features make it 
suitable for the transport of many services which use the 
classical transport protocols. Currently, many applications 
are migrating to SCTP in order to take advantage of the new 
features offered by this protocol.  
In SCTP terminology, an association is a connection 
between two endpoints which is identified by a source port 
and a destination port. An SCTP message contains the 
common SCTP header and various control or data chunks. 
By supporting multi-homing, SCTP is able to implement an 
end-to-end session transparently over multiple physical paths 
where the endpoint of each path is identified by an IP 
address. At the set up of an SCTP association, each endpoint 
provides a list of transport addresses composed of one or 
more IP addresses and a SCTP port. One of the IP addresses 
is used for the establishment of the primary path that is used 
for data chunks transmission. The other paths, called 
secondary paths, are used for data retransmission to increase 
reliability.  
Moreover, through its support for multi-homing, SCTP 
represents a suitable solution to implement and manage 
user’s mobility. Indeed, the primary path used for data 
transmission can be modified while maintaining the session. 
This property enables guaranteeing service continuity that is 
very important in some applications that rely on real time 
communications, such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and video 
streaming applications. 
For that purpose, SCTP needs a path management 
mechanism to detect primary path failure and initiate the 
path switchover when necessary. The standard strategy to 
detect path failure, which is defined in the RFC2960, is 
based mainly on a retransmission Timeout (RTO). In fact, 
data transmission failure occurs when the timer RTO is 
expired without that the data sent are acquitted. Then, if the 
number of retransmission attempt reaches a predefined 
threshold called PMR, SCTP is going to activate the path 
switchover procedure which means that current path will be 
set to INACTIVE state and a new primary path will be 
selected.   
The motivation behind this paper is a need to have a 
more accurate estimation of the failover (path failure) time in 
SCTP by interpreting the network quality degradation as an 
indicator of imminent primary path failure and implementing 
an immediate path switchover. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II details 
related work in the area. Section III describes in detail SCTP 
path management functionality. In Section IV, we propose 
an enhancement of the SCTP path failure detection strategy 
in order to preempt and avoid path failures in wireless 
environment. Then, Section V describes the simulated study 
undertaken and presents results. Finally, Section VI 
concludes the paper and points out future work.

occur once the primary path has failed and the primary 
destination address is marked as INACTIVE. A number of 
studies have been undertaken, which investigate the 
performance of SCTP switchover in wireless networks.  
In [1], authors show that the current SCTP mechanism 
for calculating RTO value is inappropriate in WLAN 
environments, by identifying significant deficiencies which 
affect the use of SCTP in a WLAN environment. These 
deficiencies result from the mechanism by which SCTP 
determines when a path switchover should be initiated. 
Experimental results indicate that SCTP allows more time to 
switchover as network conditions degrade. 
In order to reduce the switchover performance deficiency 
experienced in WLAN environments, authors in [2] 
investigate the performance implications of changes to the 
SCTP RTO mechanism, particularly alterations to the 
parameters α, the smoothing factor, and β, the delay variance 
factor. Simulation results indicate a throughput improvement 
over the default mechanism defined in RFC2960, but it 
doesn’t address the switchover delays caused by increasing 
RTT values in WLAN environment. 
Other studies investigate how the SCTP based switchover 
strategies can be enhanced. In fact, a pre-emptive 802.21 
oriented switchover strategy based on signal strength is 
proposed in [3]. According to experimental results, authors 
prove that the new strategy behaves more effectively than 
standard reactive SCTP switchover strategy, since the 802.21 
standard has the ability to predict network state changes. 
In [4], authors analyze the traditional failover time 
estimation formula in wireless networking scenarios and 
expose its drawbacks. Then, they propose some updates to 
the SCTP failover strategy in order to more accurately reflect 
the exact time at which primary path failure occurs. 
In [5], authors propose a cross layer algorithm which 
uses 802.11 MAC retransmissions as an indicator of 
performance for all paths within an association. The use of 
802.11 MAC retransmissions permit to accurately predict 
this performance transition significantly earlier than at the 
transport layer.  
In [6], a cross layer approach is presented in order to 
manage mobility in wireless environment. It introduces local, 
wireless and Internet RTO subcomponents which are 
combined to calculate end to end RTO. It also implements a 
decision mechanism which selectively implements backoff 
on RTO subcomponents depending on network conditions. 
III. 
CURRENT SCTP PATH MANAGEMENT 
One of the features of SCTP that differentiates it from 
both TCP and UDP is its support of multi-homing which is 
the ability to support many IP addresses within an 
association. Multi-homing feature is used by SCTP to add 
resilience to network failures by providing a certain degree 
of network stability to critical transmission paths.  
As a multi-homed protocol, SCTP needs a path 
management functionality to take switchover decisions as 
well as implementing the path switchover. To detect path 
failure, SCTP provides two kinds of probing mechanisms 
one for the primary path and another for the alternate paths. 
To monitor the primary path, SCTP keeps an error counter 
that counts the number of consecutive timeouts. For the 
alternate paths, SCTP uses a heartbeat mechanism to monitor 
the availability of these paths. 
The SCTP path management functionality defines two 
states for each path. The state value can be set to ACTIVE or 
INACTIVE. A primary path is set to INACTIVE if 
transmission of packets on the path repeatedly fails. 
However, a secondary path fails, if a heartbeat chunk 
transmitted to the destination on that path was not 
successfully acknowledged. Both of these mechanisms are 
reactionary to network failure.  
A. Path Monitoring 
In SCTP associations, secondary paths are monitored to 
detect any changes in the reachable state of a destination 
address, and also to update the Round Trip Time (RTT) 
measurement for each of these secondary addresses. Path 
monitoring is performed using HEARTBEAT chunks which 
are sent periodically to know which addresses defined in the 
association are reachable (see Figure 1). When a heartbeat is 
received by an endpoint, the packet is processed and a 
heartbeat ACK packet is sent back. Each heartbeat packet 
contains a timestamp of when it was sent. When the 
heartbeat ACK packet is received, the time delay difference 
can be used to estimate the Round Trip Round (RTT) for 
secondary paths.

B. Retransmission Timeout Calculation 
In order to detect the primary path failure, SCTP uses a 
reactive strategy which is mainly based on a retransmission 
timer. The duration of this timer is referred to as RTO 
(Retransmission TimeOut) [7]. The RTO duration represents 
the delay between each retransmission on the path. The 
computation and management of RTO in SCTP is similar to 
how TCP manages its retransmission timer. However, SCTP 
differs from TCP by supporting multi-homing feature. In 
fact, when the destination is multi-homed, the endpoint will 
calculate a separate RTO for each different destination’s 
transport address.  
The RTO value of the primary path is important for path 
switchover decision. If an SCTP sender doesn’t receive a 
response for an SCTP data chunk from its receiver within the 
time of Retransmission Timeout (RTO), the sender will 
consider this data chunk lost. When the number of 
consecutive timeouts on the primary path exceeds the SCTP 
threshold, the address will be marked as INACTIVE by the 
sender, and a new primary path will be selected among the 
alternate paths that are currently available.

The SCTP parameters which are used to implement the 
switchover management strategy are: 
 
RTO.Initial: the initial value for RTO. 
 
RTO.Min: the minimum time for RTO. 
 
RTO.Max: the maximum time for RTO. 
 
Path.Max.Retrans: the path retransmission threshold 
(PMR). 
 
HB.interval: the interval at which heartbeats are 
sent to monitor an SCTP endpoint. 
According to [7], the following protocol parameters are 
recommended:

3 seconds  
RTO.Min 
1 second  
RTO.Max 
60 seconds  
Path.Max.Retrans 
5 attempts 
HB.interval 
30 seconds 
 
The retransmission Timeout (RTO) is calculated for each 
destination address separately based on the Smoothed Round 
Trip Time (SRTT) and Round Trip Time Variation 
(RTTVAR) of the path. SRTT and RTTVAR are calculated 
by the measurement of Round Trip Time (RTT) of the path. 
Initially RTO gets RTO.initial. Then, when SCTP gets the 
first measurement of RTT (RTT.1st), SRTT and RTTVAR 
are initialized as follow:  
SRTT= RTT.1st                               (1) 
RTTVAR= RTT.1st /2                     (2) 
And RTO is updated to: 
RTO= SRTT+4*RTTVAR              (3) 
For each time SCTP gets a new measurement of RTT 
(RTT.new), SRTT and RTTVAR will be updated as follow: 
 RTTVAR.new = (1-β)*RTTVAR.old +  
                              β*(SRTT.old – RTT.new)    (4) 
SRTT.new = (1-α)*SRTT.old + α*RTT.new    (5) 
Where α, the smoothing factor, and β, the delay variance 
factor, are constants and their recommended values are 1/4 
and 1/8 respectively. 
Then, the new RTO is: 
          RTO=SRTT.new + 4*RTTVAR.new      (6) 
If the new RTO is less than RTO.Min, it will be set to 
RTO.Min. If the new RTO is greater than RTO.Max, it will 
be set to RTO.Max.  
Every time a transmission timeout occurs for an address 
(Figure 2(b)), the RTO for this address will be doubled 
(Backoff the time):  
       RTO = RTO x2                        (7) 
As illustrated in Figure 2(a), if the sender gets a response 
from the receiver, a new RTT is measured. SCTP will use 
this new RTT to calculate RTTVAR, SRTT and finally RTO 
by the equations (4) (5) and (6).

C. The Standard Path Failure Detection  
The standard SCTP path failure detection strategy, as 
illustrated in Figure 3, is based on the retransmission timer 
with its managing rules as defined in RFC 2960 [7].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Standard Path Failure Detection Strategy 
In fact, in SCTP association, packet transmission is 
through primary path only; other paths are back up in 
association. When a primary path is selected, the SCTP 
mechanism will mark the path to ACTIVE and use a 
retransmission count parameter to monitor path condition. If 
the timer expires, and the data chunk has not been 
acknowledged yet, it is assumed that the chunk is lost. 
Consequently, the actual RTO value for the affected path is 
doubled (exponential back-off mechanism), the error count is 
incremented by one and the lost chunk is marked for 
retransmission. When the retransmission count parameter 
reaches the threshold PMR (Path.Max.Retrans), the primary 
path takes failure. Then, the SCTP mechanism will change 
primary path state to INACTIVE and switch to a secondary 
path to continue transmission.

IV. 
PROPOSED ALTERATION OF SCTP SWITCHOVER 
MECHANISM 
Based on the sum of the consecutive retransmission 
timeouts, the standard strategy used by SCTP to detect the 
path failure is very simple and can’t effectively distinguish 
path condition in wireless network. Consequently, this 
strategy is not always appropriate, especially when 
considering the SCTP multi-homing feature as a basis for 
achieving transport layer mobility in wireless network, where 
the transition time between available paths becomes a key 
aspect for the optimization.  
Therefore, the most crucial challenge for SCTP is to 
provide optimal path management, aiming at improving the 
performance of the original switchover mechanism presented 
in Section III.  
In this paper, we propose an improvement of the standard 
path failure detection strategy used by SCTP by changing the 
criteria of switchover initiation in order to obtain a more 
accurate estimation of the exact time at which primary path 
failure occurs (the Failover time). The alteration that we 
propose does not concern the formula of calculation of the 
parameter RTO. But it consist in defining new QoS 
parameters to preempt the path failure, and fixing thresholds 
to these parameters according to the type of traffic emitted 
and its requirements in terms of quality of service. 
In fact, we propose to evaluate the Total Time spent 
expecting an acknowledgment (Tack) in any case (packet 
transmission success or failure), which is an excellent 
indicator of path performance. Tack is computed by equation 
(8), by representing the sum of the (k-1) consecutive 
timeouts according to the RTO value at the transmission 
failure instant. However, if the packet sent is acquitted after 
(k-1) retransmission attempts, Tack is calculated by applying 
equation (9). The value (k-1) represents the number of 
retransmission attempts which is necessarily less than PMR 
(0 < k ≤PMR). The index j refers to the traffic type. 
The time Tack will be the most important parameter to 
consider in the SCTP switchover decision. SCTP will use it 
as a path performance indicator to preempt degradation in 
path status and avoid service interruption.

We have also introduced a new condition to evaluate the path

threshold for each type of traffic: 
If  (TAck, j≥ TThreshold, j) Then (Primary path is INACTIVE) 
Thus, the path is marked "INACTIVE" if one of the 
following conditions is satisfied: 
- 
The number of retransmission timeouts reaches the 
maximum 
number 
of 
retransmission 
(PMR) 
authorized by SCTP.

The modifications proposed with regard to the standard 
mechanism will be represented on the organization chart 
above (see Figure 4). 
In RFC2960, the failure of packet retransmission induces 
the multiplication of the value of RTO by 2. As applications 
have different needs in terms of quality of service, we 
suggest penalizing the transmission failures in a different 
way for every type of traffic. 
For real time streaming multimedia applications, such as 
voice over IP, which are delay sensitive, high latency can 
cause service quality degradation. However, Best effort 
traffic is more tolerant to delay. For these reasons, we 
propose to treat traffic flow differently by providing priority 
to certain flow, depending on their QoS requirements. We 
call Nj the parameter used to penalize retransmission failure, 
where the index j indicates the traffic type. In RFC2960, this 
parameter is invariable and equal to 2.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
In order to illustrate the deficiencies of the strategy used 
by SCTP to detect the path failure and implement our 
proposed approach, we consider a network topology 
consisting of two base stations 802.11b and two nodes. The 
nodes are communicating and each one belongs to a base 
station. The network topology is shown in Figure 5.  
 
 
Figure 5.  Simulated Network Topology 
During simulation, we are interested to real-time traffics 
which are delay sensitive such as VoIP and video streaming. 
The video streaming traffic is simulated by an application 
that generates one packet every 26 milliseconds. Each packet 
has a size of 660 bytes. While the VoIP traffic is simulated 
by an application that generates packets of 160 bytes every 
20 milliseconds. The traffic flow parameters are shown in 
Table 3.

The simulation process time is 50 seconds, and all nodes 
start their transmission at 2s after the beginning of simulation

The simulation results presented in this paper were 
obtained using the network simulator NS2 [8] and the SCTP 
patch [9].

We will first simulate the service differentiation module

Figure 6 and 7 illustrate respectively the RTO values for 
the simulated scenario for VoIP and video streaming traffic. 
When the mobile node moves away from the coverage area 
of the access point, signal strength degrades and the RTT and 
RTO increase. From simulation’s result, we notice that 
SCTP take 15s to mark the destination address INACTIVE 
(T=1+2+4+8=15s). Which means that it would take 15s 
seconds for switchover to occur.

The failover time is defined as the instant at which the 
primary path failure is detected. It is computed according to 
RTO values and corresponds to the (PMR
to retransmit a lost chunk. Table 5 represents the failover 
instants for VoIP and Video streaming traffic when 
standard and the new SCTP path failure detection strategy. In 
fact, using the standard strategy, path failover is detected at 
44,32s for VoIP and 45,36s for video streaming traffic. 
However, when using the new strategy based on service 
differentiation, the path failure is detected earlier at 33,32s 
for VoIP and 36,13s for video streaming traffic.

2) End-to-End Delay  
The end to end delay, measured in second, is the time taken 
for a packet to be transmitted across a network from source 
to destination. It is an important parameter to evaluate the 
QoS for the real-time traffic. 
3) Packet Loss Rate  
Packet loss is expressed as a percentage of the number of 
packets lost to the total number of packets sent.

Figure 10.  Performance metrics for Video Streaming traffic  
Figures 9 and 10 represent the metrics of network 
performance (Throughput, Delay and Packet loss) for 
respectively VoIP and Video streaming traffic. According to 
simulation’s result, we notice that when using the standard 
strategy, although there was a degradation of network 
performance in terms of throughput, delay and loss, SCTP 
delays switchover, i.e., SCTP allows more time to initiate 
switchover.  
Through simulation results, we deduce that our approach 
could be an alternative to the current SCTP path failure 
detection strategy used by SCTP; by increasing network 
performance and providing a seamless switchover to real-
time applications such as VoIP or video streaming 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we are interested to the mechanism used by 
SCTP to take the decision of changing the primary path 
which relies mainly on the failover mechanism. We have 
detailed the current mechanism implemented in SCTP and 
described some of its failings. Then, we have proposed a 
proactive approach to detect the path failure. Our approach 
would be more suitable to a mobile environment such as 
WLAN. In fact, according to experiment results, the 
proposed approach allows SCTP to detect the path failover 
earlier than the standard mechanism. Moreover, it provides a 
seamless switchover to real-time applications by increasing 
network performance and avoiding service interruption. In 
future work, we will investigate the algorithm used by SCTP 
to estimate the RTO timer, in order to enhance switchover 
performance in WLAN environment.
