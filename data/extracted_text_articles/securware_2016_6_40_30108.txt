Abstract— 
This 
paper 
focuses 
on 
the 
contemporary 
possibilities of predicting intense convective precipitation and 
the utilization of this information in Crisis Management 
procedures of the Zlin Region in the Czech Republic. The first 
part describes the Information, Notification and Warning 
System of the Zlin Region, which ensures comprehensive 
forecasts of convective precipitation. The outputs from the 
convective precipitation forecast system and the mobile 
meteorological radar (MMR50) are part of a comprehensive 
forecast. Both of these predictive tools are analyzed in this 
paper. The first principles of complex prediction are 
demonstrated in a case-based study involving the local flash 
floods that affected the Zlin Region on July 24th, 2015. The 
main contribution of the paper is unique information on the 
use of mobile meteorological radar (MMR50) to forecast 
thunderstorms and flash floods formation in the Zlín Region.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
In the last decade, flash floods have been one of the most 
abundant types of flooding in the Czech Republic. Despite 
the fact that large sum of money are being spent on flood 
prevention measures, effective protection against this type of 
flooding is almost nonexistent. 
The main reason for this situation is the character of 
torrential floods and the possibility of their prediction. Flash 
floods are caused by intense convective precipitation over a 
very small area - in the order of kms2 in a relatively short 
time (several dozen of minutes). The consequence of flash 
floods is a very steep rise in the level of the affected 
watercourse [1]. 
The main problem is the insufficient amount of ground 
meteorological stations including aerological stations that 
provide input data for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) 
models. Another shortcoming is insufficient resolution, 
which cannot affect the size of the convective cells. The use 
of NWP models for the prediction of intense convective 
precipitation has been investigated in many studies [2][3][4]. 
The second system used for predicting convective 
precipitation is “nowcasting” which calculates the shift of 
precipitation fields in the order of 30-60 minutes in advance. 
However, nowcasting systems cannot predict the dynamic 
development of convective precipitation in time. Nowcasting 
is combined with the outputs of NWP models [5][6][7]. 
The forecasting of intense convective precipitation is 
implemented by expert meteorological systems that combine 
the characteristics of NWP models, meteorological radars 
and satellites; including meteorological nowcasting in 
foreign meteorological services. The disadvantages of expert 
systems result from the forecasting systems´ deficiencies 
[8][9]. 
The fundamental problems reside in forecasting for a 
specific location and time of occurrence of intense 
convective precipitation; including sufficient lead-time ahead 
of the forecast.  
The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute is the only 
institution in the Czech Republic that provides forecasts and 
warning information on the occurrence of dangerous 
atmospheric phenomena. However, this information is not of 
sufficient quality and accuracy - precisely because of the 
complicated temporal and spatial occurrence of these 
phenomena. Therefore, the Zlín Region is the only region in 
the Czech Republic that has decided to create its own 
complex system for forecasting torrential rainfall. One 
justifying reason for the design of this system is to provide 
another alternative that would support the decision-making 
processes of the regional crisis management of the 
administrative authorities before the occurrence and while 
finding a solution for flash floods. 
In Section 3, the graphical and tabular expression of the 
probability of occurrence of convective precipitation will be 
the output for individual Municipalities with Extended 
Powers (MEP) in the Zlin Region. The information will be 
available, not only for the region, but also for MEP mayors 
including other municipalities and institutions. 
The main objective of the comprehensive forecasting 
system will be to provide timely and high-quality 
information on the occurrence and development of future 
weather for crisis management and civil protection purposes. 
This information will then be used for preventive measures 
against the occurrence of flooding; for example, preventive 
inspections control of flood defenses, material and other 
resources. 
II. 
THE COMPLEX FORECASTING OF CONVECTIVE 
PRECIPITATION 
The complex of forecasting of convective precipitation is 
based on a sequence of activities necessary to ensure timely 
and high-quality information regarding the likely formation 
of flash floods:

 
Monitoring of forecasting and warning information 
from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. 
 
Information 
from 
the 
convective 
precipitation 
forecast system outputs for the next 24 hours. 
 
Very short prediction times (i.e., nowcasting) by the 
mobile meteorological radar (MMR50) for 30 to 60 
minutes. 
 
Verification of radar data through an observation 
network of professional and amateur meteorologists 
in the Zlín Region. 
The comprehensive forecast implementation tool is the 
Information, Notification and Warning System of the Zlin 
Region (further only INWS ZR), which consists of 
information support for crisis management and population 
protection for extraordinary events, for example, floods, 
technological accidents, etc.  
As can be seen in Figure 1, the backbone of the system is 
a robust and secure communication infrastructure (a fiber 
optic cable), which interconnects 11 municipalities with 
extended powers and other municipalities with the Zlín 
Region Crisis Staff regional controlling centre. The Zlín 
Region´s Information, Notification and Warning System is 
also used to communicate with the public administration 
sector, the Fire Rescue Services of the Zlín Region and the 
other municipalities’ warning information systems [10][11]. 
 
Figure 1. Structure of the INWS ZR [10]. 
 
INWS ZR consists of the following major components: 
 
Central Dispatch. 
 
Warning Information Systems (WIS). 
 
WIS Server. 
 
Videoconferencing systems. 
 
Municipal Closed-Circuits Television (CCTV) 
surveillance systems. 
 
Meteorological sensors and stations. 
 
Information and bulletin boards. 
 
Environmental and chemical detection elements. 
 
Mobile meteorological radar (MMR50). 
 
Alternative energy resources [12]. 
The forecasting of dangerous atmospheric phenomena 
has become a part of this system. The main component of 
this system is the control application of the INWS ZR. 
Simultaneously, control applications include outputs from: 
 
Convective precipitation forecasting system. 
 
Mobile meteorological radar (MMR50) 
The comprehensive prediction of convective precipitation 
is comprised of the output control application of the INWS 
ZR that distributes data from radar measurements as well as 
the convective precipitation forecast system for authorities 
and other crisis management participants. 
A. The INWS ZR control application  
The INWS ZR control application is a user interface that 
enables the collection, analysis and evaluation of data for 
crisis management purposes in the Zlin Region. This 
application consists of two software components: 
 
The INWS ZR server application, connected to the 
data network with the individual clients of the INWS 
ZR under one municipality of extended powers. 
 
The INWS ZR applications client that runs on PCs in 
the individual departments and MEPs of the Zlin 
Region. 
Access to the control applications of the INWS ZR is 
secured by logging into the INWS server. If the user is 
logged in, then they get permission to read and modify 
individual work sheets. The work sheets contain crisis 
management data and information about objects, documents, 
history, traffic, water courses, radar outputs from the mobile 
meteorological radar (MMR50) and other forecasting 
information [11]. 
B. The convective precipitation forecasting system  
The core of the convective precipitation forecast system 
is an algorithm based on the principle of analyzing and 
evaluating the output of meteorological variables and the 
parameters of numerical weather prediction models; 
especially regional NWP model ALADIN [13]. The main 
research hypothesis is to assess the impact of the relief of 
the terrain on the development of convective precipitation in 
the target area. Because of this, one has to use an analysis of 
historical weather events and selected floods caused by 
torrential rainfall in order to produce supplementary, more 
accurate, 
warning 
information 
from 
the 
Czech 
Hydrometeorological Institute. 
The main outcomes of the report are: 
 
The spatial and temporal occurrence of convective 
precipitation. 
 
The lead-time ahead of forecasts for the next 6-24 
hours. 
The “Place of occurrence” means the territory of the 
municipality with extended powers. The time occurrence 
forecast is set at the three-hour time interval. 
The main method is a Multi-Criteria Assessment (MCA) 
whose basis is the selection criteria of the meteorological 
variables and the setting of the weights for these criteria.

The criteria weights were determined by analyzing the 
aerological data of 70 meteorological situations in 2007-
2015. 
The Convective Precipitation Forecast Algorithm 
(CPFA) operates in seven phases: 
I. 
General characteristics of the predicted weather 
situation. 
II. 
The forecasted time of the convective precipitation 
occurrence. 
III. 
The air masses forecast conditions. 
IV. 
The 
forecasted 
probability 
of 
dangerous 
accompanying phenomena (e.g., torrential rainfall, 
hail, strong wind gusts and tornadoes). 
V. 
The forecasting of local conditions between the 
surface and the lift condensation level. 
VI. 
The comparison of air masses´ forecast conditions 
and the local conditions with historical weather 
situations statistics. 
VII. 
The main output of the forecast. 
The first phase shows the basic characteristics of 
predicted weather conditions; such as date, flow direction at 
700 hPa (i.e., precipitation movement direction), the type of 
weather situation, the triggering factor of convection and 
warning information by the Czech Hydrometeorological 
Institute. The second phase is focused on the prediction time 
occurrence of convective precipitation (i.e., 3-hour period). 
The forecast is based on the penetration of the NWP models 
ALADIN CHMU, ALADIN SHMU, GFS, GEM, UKMET, 
EURO4 outputs. The selection of these NWP models is 
based on an analysis of 50 weather situations with which 
these models have achieved the highest success rate of 
forecasting of convective precipitation. 
Table I provides information about the weather 
conditions 
of 
air 
masses 
and 
the 
corresponding 
meteorological elements and convection indices:

Each 
criterion 
(meteorological 
element, 
index 
convection) is classified according to the degree of intensity 
and probability of occurrence of convective precipitation 
clouds:

Tables II implies that the intensity of precipitation 
coefficients is related to the instability of the atmosphere, 
wind shear and the organization of the storms. The 
convective precipitation probability coefficients are used to 
trigger convection factors. 
The intensity or probability of 
the 
convective 
precipitation occurrence is calculated according to this 
equation: 

Σn/Σm*3)*100(%)P

where n is the sum of the forecast coefficients, e.g. forecasts 
of atmospheric instability, and m is the total number of 
predicted meteorological variables. 
Fourthly, the probability of occurrence of dangerous 
atmospheric phenomena is defined as an intersection of 
selected meteorological variables defining the conditions of 
air masses. 
In the fifth phase, the forecast of local conditions was 
calculated as the intersection of ALADIN meteograms 
meteorological 
variables 
and 
the 
morphometrical 
characteristics of relief: 
 
The air temperature at 2 meters above ground. 
 
The relative humidity 2 meters above ground. 
 
The difference of mean sea level pressure. 
 
The wind direction and speed at 10 meters above 
ground. 
 
The degree of cloud cover. 
 
The characteristics of terrain relief affecting the 
thermal conditions, e.g. orientation and slope of the 
terrain, the degree of vegetation coverage, the heat 
contrast of the Earth's surface, the Z-factor and the 
altitude and ridge parameters. 
 
The characteristics terrain relief influencing windy 
conditions; 
for 
example, 
settlement, 
valley 
parameters and wrapping obstacles. 
In the sixth phase, the outputs of the first to third stages 
forecasts are compared with the historical statistics of 
meteorological situations. The main criteria are the direction 
of the precipitation movement, the synoptic situation and 
selected meteorological elements. The aim of this phase is to 
determine the degree of similarity between the predicted and 
historical meteorological situations.

The last phase is the final forecast of future occurrences 
of convective precipitation, which will include maps of the 
Zlin Region, including municipalities with extended powers 
for forecast purposes: 
 
The probability of time and place occurrence of 
precipitation for 6 to 24 hours in advance. 
 
The intensity of convective precipitation. 
 
The probability of the occurrence of dangerous 
atmospheric phenomena (e.g., heavy rainfall, hail, 
strong gusts and tornadoes). 
This predictive information will be important in terms of its 
preventive nature for the region´s Crisis Management 
authorities and other participants. 
 
C. The MMR50 Meteorological Rradar  
The mobile meteorological radar (MMR50) is a device 
for detecting precipitation and other nonmeteorological 
targets within a radius of 60 km.

Table III presents the technical specification of the 
mobile meteorological radar (MMR50), which provides 
detailed information and the current state of precipitation 
through six radar products (i.e., Plan Position Indicator, 
Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicator, Range height 
indicator, ECHO TOP, Vertically Integrated Liquid). Very 
short-term forecast (Nowcasting) is secured by means of the 
Nowcasting TITAN forecasting software with forecasts for 
30-60 minutes. 
The fundamental radar quantity is the Radar Reflectivity 
Z in the dBz unit, which is converted from the rainfall 
intensity I: 



where the values of a and b are experimentally determined 
constants (a = 16, b = 200) [1]. 
 
III. 
CASE STUDY OF THE FLASH FLOOD ON 24.7.2015 
The principle of the complex forecast of convective 
precipitation is shown with a case study of the flash flood 
that occurred on July 24th, 2015. 
The main cause of the flash floods was a cold front, 
which ensured the emergence of sufficient atmospheric 
instability, combined with a moderate wind shear. This 
situation was characterized by the continuous emergence of 
new precipitation – and, its stationary movement. 
This torrential rainfall, in combination with hail and 
strong wind gusts, caused material damage amounting to tens 
of millions Czech crowns. The most affected villages were 
Slušovice and Fryšták in the central part of the Zlin Region, 
where cellars and houses were flooded. 
A. Convective Precipitation Forecasting System 
The weather situation forecast was very complicated due 
to the uniqueness of the formation and development of the 
intensive convective precipitation. 
In the previous section, the convective precipitation 
forecast was dealt with in several stages. The outcomes of a 
brief analysis of the predicted weather conditions were: 
 
The direction of precipitation movement from the 
southwest, with a speed of 9 m / s. 
 
The type of weather situation - an area of low 
pressure associated with a cold front over western 
Slovakia. 
 
Warning 
information 
from 
the 
Czech 
Hydrometeorological Institute was not released. 
The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute did not issue 
predictive warning information on thunderstorms for the 
entire Czech Republic. Nevertheless, the forecast was 
calculated for 24 hours in advance, which found the likely 
occurrence of intense convective precipitation. 
Subsequently, the interval occurrence of intense 
convective precipitation was determined - based on the 
outputs of the NWP models for 24 hours in advance:

As shown in Table IV, times in bold typeface indicate 
those time intervals for which the predictions were 
calculated. The interval 15:00-18:00 is identified as 15 hours. 
The interval 18:00-21:00 is 18 hours. 
The third phase involves the calculation of air mass 
conditions. Air mass includes the part of the atmosphere 
which is defined by the difference between the lift 
condensation level and the lower boundary of the 
troposphere. 
The formation of strong and very strong thunderstorms 
was caused by a combination of sufficient atmospheric 
instability and a moderate wind shear in the central and 
northeastern parts of the Zlin Region.

Table VI demonstrates the probability of formation of 
convection affected by the local weather conditions which 
are orographic, thermal and wind conditions of terrain relief 
for a specific time interval. The most favorable conditions 
for the initial formation of convection above the Earth's 
surface were predicted for the northeastern and central parts 
of the Zlin Region. 
The sixth and seventh phases were consolidated for the 
clarity of the main output. The resulting forecast is a 
combination of air mass conditions and the local conditions, 
combined and compared with selected historical weather 
precipitation statistics.

Table VII summarizes the facts the outputs from statistics 
only 
confirm 
or 
complement 
the 
new 
convective 
precipitation locations. The resulting forecast only changes 
if the statistics concur on the occurrence of precipitation 
outside the forecast of conditions of air masses and the local 
conditions. In this case, the resulting forecast remains 
unchanged.

As revealed in Table VIII, the most intense rainfall occurred 
in the village of Fryšták between 17:00 and 18:00 hours, at 
an average intensity of 37 mm / hour. Residents of Fryšták 
registered the occurrence of severe hail, combined with 
torrential rainfall, which caused considerable damage to 
property. The nowcasting method provided accurate 
predictions in terms of the place of occurrence of convective 
precipitation. 
 
C. Verification of the  forecast on 7/24/2015 
Verification of comprehensive convective precipitation 
forecasts was performed using the outputs of ground –based 
meteorological stations. 
The most intense rainfall occurred at stations: 
 Zlín-Štípa - with 43 mm (Zlín); forecast 30-50 mm 
 Huslenky -  with 34 mm (Vsetín); forecast 30-50 
mm 
 Hošťálková - with 33 mm (Vsetín); forecast 30-
50mm 
The success of the prediction of precipitation locations is 
81% for Municipalities with Extended Powers in the Zlin 
Region for both time periods.  The success rate of forecasted 
precipitation occurrence time was 100%. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The aim of this article was to provide information about 
the comprehensive forecasting of convective precipitation in 
the Zlín Region. The first section mentioned the importance 
of the Information, Notification and Warning System of the 
Zlín Region; and, especially in the Crisis Management field. 
The main focus was on the outputs of the convective 
precipitation forecast system.  
The principle of complex predictions was described in 
the case study of 7/24/2015, when there was a local flash 
flood in the central part of the Zlin Region. The success rate 
of comprehensive predictions reached 81%, whereby, it met 
the condition predictions of success rate by more than 50%.  
Future research will focus on optimizing the limits of the 
meteorological elements and the search for similar historical 
events. The main objective will be to continually refine and 
improve predictions of the place and time of occurrence of 
convective precipitation in order to provide preventive 
measures and improve the preparedness of Crisis 
Management authorities against the occurrence of flash 
floods.
