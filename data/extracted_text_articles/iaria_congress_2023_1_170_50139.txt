Abstract—In this work, we provide new experimental results 
on studies of composites with glass-coated ferromagnetic 
microwires aligned 
with 
the 
requirements of 
carbon 
composites. This work focuses on the free space microwave 
measurements of composites made from carbon fibers and 
ferromagnetic 
microwires 
inclusion 
focusing 
on 
the 
electromagnetic properties. We prepared and measured 
hysteresis loops and the magnetoimpedance effect of several 
microwires and selected Co-rich microwires with better 
magnetic softness and higher magnetoimpedance effect. We 
observed that, by using a low frequency modulating magnetic 
field allows us to distinguish the microwave signals originated 
by ferromagnetic microwires inclusions from that generated by 
the carbon fibers. The location of carbon fibers near magnetic 
microwires has a critical effect on the response signals 
(parameters S amplitude) obtained from such composites. 
Keywords-magnetic microwires; magnetic softness; carbon fiber 
composite; magnetoimpedance effect.  
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
 
Amorphous soft magnetic materials, prepared by rapid 
melt quenching, can present excellent magnetic softness 
together with superior mechanical properties [1]-[5]. Thus, 
abrupt deterioration of the 
magnetic softness and 
mechanical properties (such as tensile yield) upon the 
devitrification of amorphous precursor is previously 
reported [4]. Additionally, the fabrication process of 
amorphous materials involving rapid melt quenching is fast 
and inexpensive [1]-[5]. Accordingly, amorphous soft 
magnetic materials are useful for numerous industrial 
applications (mostly for design of magnetic devices and 
magnetoelastic sensors) [8]-[12].  
The development of novel applications of amorphous 
materials requires new functionalities, i.e., reduced 
dimensions, 
enhanced 
corrosion 
resistance 
or 
biocompatibility of the sensing material [11][13]. Therefore, 
great attention has been paid to development of alternative 
fabrication methods allowing preparation of amorphous 
materials at micro-nano scale involving melt quenching 
[11][13]. 
Glass-coated microwires prepared by the Taylor-
Ulitovsky technique fit most of the requirements: such 
magnetic microwires have micro-nanometric diameters 
(between 0.5 and 100 µm), covered with thin, insulating, 
biocompatible and flexible glass-coating and can present 
excellent magnetic softness or magnetic bistability [5] [11] 
[13]. Such features of glass-coated microwires allow 
development of exciting new applications in various 
magnetic sensors, as well as in smart composites with 
tunable magnetic permittivity [6][11][13]-[20]. One more 
advantage of glass-coated microwires is their excellent 
mechanical properties [4] [5]. 
Recently, the stress dependence of hysteresis loops and 
Giant Magnetoimpedance, GMI, effect have been proposed 
for the mechanical stresses monitoring in Fiber Reinforced 
Composites (FRC) containing microwires inclusions or 
using magnetoelastic sensors based on stress dependence of 
various magnetic properties [10] [20] [21]. 
One of the common problems in composite materials is 
monitoring of stresses and temperature. Usually, composite 
stress monitoring is performed by different sensors, like the 
pressure transducers and dielectric sensors [21]. However, 
these employed sensors are not wireless [21]. One of the

proposed solutions for non-destructive FRC monitoring is 
by using of piezoelectric fibers with diameters of 10 to 100 
μm [22]. However, this solution requires electrodes to 
supply an electrical field, occupying a significant amount of 
space. 
Among the promising solutions, addressing the problem 
of non-destructive FRC monitoring is a new sensing method 
involving free space microwave spectroscopy using 
inclusions of ferromagnetic microwire presenting the high 
frequency impedance quite sensitive to applied stress and 
magnetic field [21]. The aforementioned glass-coated 
microwires with metallic nucleus diameters of 0.2 - 100 μm 
can present excellent mechanical and corrosive properties (if 
produced with an amorphous structure), and hence perfectly 
suitable for the requirements of this technique, making it 
suitable for remote stresses and temperature monitoring in 
FRCs [18]-[21].  
For the proposed application involving the non-
destructive FRC monitoring glass-coated microwires must 
present 
good 
magnetic 
softness 
and 
high 
magnetoimpedance, MI, effect [18] [21]. Magnetic softness 
of amorphous microwires is substantially affected by the 
chemical composition of metallic nucleus: better magnetic 
softness and higher MI effect are reported for Co-rich 
microwires with vanishing magnetostriction [1] [5]. 
Accordingly, in this paper, we present our latest results 
on studies of magnetic properties of glass-coated Co-rich 
microwires and on our attempts to wirelessly health 
monitoring of composites containing both carbon fibers and 
ferromagnetic glass-coated microwires. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the 
experimental 
methods 
as 
well 
as 
the 
microwires 
characteristics analyzed in this paper are provided. Section 3 
deals with experimental results dealing with free space 
microwave measurements of composites containing both 
carbon fibers and ferromagnetic glass-coated microwires. 
Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 4. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM DETAILS 
Generally, we prepared and analyzed two different types of 
magnetic amorphous microwires: i) amorphous microwires 
with high positive magnetostriction coefficients, λs, (Fe-rich) 
and ii) amorphous microwires with vanishing λs (Co-Fe-based 
microwires). We studied microwires with metallic nucleus 
diameters, d, ranging from 22 up to 38 m and a total 
diameter, D, up to 45 m, prepared using the modified 
Taylor-Ulitovsky method described elsewhere [11] [17]. The 
Taylor-Ulitovsky method allows the preparation of metallic 
microwires (with typical diameters of the order of 0.1 to 100 
μm) covered with an insulating glass coating [11] [17].  
Magnetic hysteresis loops of studied microwires have been 
measured using the fluxmetric method, previously described 
in detail elsewhere [16]. The hysteresis loops were 
represented as the dependence of normalized magnetization, 
M/M0 (where M is the magnetic moment at a given magnetic 
field and M0 is the magnetic moment of the sample at the 
maximum magnetic field amplitude almost at magnetic 
saturation) versus magnetic field, H. Such format of 
hysteresis loops allows better comparison of microwires with 
different 
chemical 
composition 
and 
diameters. 
The 
homogeneous axial magnetic field was produced by a long 
solenoid (about 1 cm in diameter and 12 cm in length). All 
the measurements were performed at low magnetic field 
frequencies (100 Hz).  
The sample impedance, Z, in extended frequency range 
has been evaluated using the micro-strip sample holder from 
the reflection coefficient, S11, obtained using Vector 
Network Analyzer (VNA), as previously described [23]. 
Such micro-strip holder with sample has been placed inside 
a long solenoid generating a homogeneous magnetic field, 
H. The GMI ratio, ΔZ/Z, is obtained from Z(H) dependence 
as: 
 
 
        Z/Z = [Z(H) - Z(Hmax)]/Z(Hmax),   
     (1) 
where H and Hmax are given and maximum applied fields 
respectively. 
The composites containing both carbon fibers and 
ferromagnetic glass-coated microwires were manufactured 
in the INFINITE project (Horizon Europe) at IDEKO’s 
facilities (see Figure 1).  
The amorphous structure of all the microwires has been

proved by the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) method. Typically, 
the crystallization of amorphous microwires was observed at 
Tann ≥ 500 °C [16]. 
For wireless measurements we used the free space 
measurement setup (see Figure 2) consisting of two 
broadband horn antennas (1-17 GHz) fixed to the anechoic 
chamber and a vector network analyzer, previously employed 
for the characterization of the composites with magnetic wire 
inclusions [18,21]. Such setup allows to characterize the 
composite of 20 x 20 cm2. 
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Previous 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
magnetostriction coefficient, λs, is primary affected by the 
composition of the microwires. Vanishing λs –value (λs ≈ 
10-7) is predicted in (Co1-xFex)1-y(Si-B-C)y amorphous alloys 
at 0.05≤x≤0.1 and 0.15≤y≤0.30 [17] [24]. Therefore, we 
prepared Co64.6Fe5B16Si11Cr3.4 glass-coated microwires with 
metallic nucleus diameter, d, of 22 and 38 µm, which 
previously showed high MI effect [17]. 
For comparison, we also prepared and measured 
magnetic properties of Fe-rich microwires (Fe77.5B15Si7.5) 
with d=23 µm, D=37 µm and high and positive λs (λs ≈ 40 
x10-6). 
The hysteresis loops of studied microwires are provided 
in Figure 3. As observed from Figure 3, both Co-rich 
microwires show good magnetic softness: a coercivity, Hc, 
about 16-20 A/m and a magnetic anisotropy field, Hk, about 
150 A/ m. In contrast, a rectangular hysteresis loops and Hc 
≈100 A/m are observed for Fe77.5B15Si7.5 glass-coated 
microwires (d=23 µm, D=37 µm) (see Figure 3c).  
Figure 3 shows the results on GMI effect of these 
microwires. As evidenced from Figure 4, both Co-rich 
microwires present high MI effect (maximum Z/Z up to 
220 % at 100 MHz, see Figures 4 a,b). However, for 
Fe77.5B15Si7.5 microwire the observed MI effect is rather 
low: up to 2% at the same frequency (100 MHz) (see Figure 
4c).  Consequently, Co-rich microwires with better MI 
effect have been selected for the composite preparation. 
As reported elsewhere [25] [26], magnetic properties and 
MI effect of amorphous ferromagnetic microwires are 
substantially affected by applied stress and by heating. 
Therefore, the main advantage of utilizing of magnetic 
microwires inclusions in carbon fiber composites is the 
possibility for stress and/or temperature monitoring. Very 
few previous publications have reported attempts to prepare 
such composites, while Fe-rich microwire inclusions were 
used and the carbon fiber content was rather low [27].  
The expected problem with composites containing 
conductive carbon fibers is that they can substantially 
interfere with the microwave signal from the magnetic 
microwire inclusions [27]. Therefore, we propose to apply a 
low frequency modulating magnetic field to distinguish the 
microwave signals from magnetic microwires from that 
originated by conductive carbon fibers, since only the 
magnetic microwires responds to the modulating field.

In Figure. 5a, the microwave signals are shown (S 
parameters) measured at 2 GHz. As observed, the signals 
measured under these conditions are comparable to the 
noise level. In order to separate the microwave signal from 
ferromagnetic microwires, we used an external low 
frequency modulated magnetic field.  As shown in Figure 
5b, application of such modulated magnetic field (80 Hz) 
allows a sensitive and stable extraction of the response 
signal (R and T coefficients) from the ferromagnetic 
microwires inclusions.  
 However, the position of carbon fibers in vicinity of 
magnetic microwires critically affect the signals (S 
parameters) obtained from such composites.

As observed, the presence of even such thin insulating 
layer allows affecting substantially the amplitude of the S11 
parameter signal originated by magnetic microwires.  
The aforementioned examples provide the routes for 
development of the composites made from the carbon fibers 
and magnetically soft amorphous glass-coated microwires 
inclusions. 
The key results are that use of a low frequency 
modulating magnetic field allows to distinguish the 
microwave signals originated by ferromagnetic microwires 
inclusions from that generated by the carbon fibers. 
However, the position of carbon fibers in vicinity of 
magnetic microwires critically affect the signals obtained 
from such composites. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
 
We have explored the feasibility of developing 
composites containing carbon fibers and glass-coated 
magnetic microwires inclusions using the free space 
microwave spectroscopy aligned with the requirements of 
carbon composites. For the preparation of such composites, 
we selected Co-rich microwires with better magnetic 
softness 
and 
higher 
magnetoimpedance 
effect. 
We 
experimentally demonstrated that the application of low 
frequency magnetic field allows to distinguish the 
microwave signals originated by ferromagnetic microwires 
inclusions from the signal generated by the carbon fibers. 
However, the location of carbon fibers near magnetic 
microwires has a critical effect on the signals (parameter S) 
obtained from such composites.
