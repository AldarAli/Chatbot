Abstract—We 
model 
insurgency 
(IN) 
and 
counterinsurgency (COIN) operations with a large-scale 
system of differential equations that is connected to a 
coalition network model.  Our simulations analyze 
components of leadership, promotion, recruitment, 
financial resources, operational techniques, network 
communications, 
coalition 
cooperation, 
logistics, 
security, 
intelligence, 
infrastructure 
development, 
humanitarian aid, and psychological warfare, with the 
goal of informing today’s decision makers of the options 
available in counterinsurgency tactics, operations, and 
strategy.  In order to be more effective, the US military 
must improve its counterinsurgency capabilities and 
flexibility to match the adaptability of insurgent 
networks and terror cells.  Our simulation model 
combines elements of traditional differential equation 
force-on-force modeling with modern social science 
modeling of networks, psyop, and coalition cooperation 
to inform the tactics and strategies of counterinsurgency 
decision makers.   We calibrated our model with 
baseline data intended to keep the balanced strength 
equilibrium. We show the model development and 
results of a four-stage counter-insurgency scenario.

I. 
 THE COIN MODEL 
In modeling an insurgent or terrorist organization, we 
modify the differential equation model in [1] that tracks 
several groups within the terrorist organization: senior 
leaders (l), junior leaders (j), outside supporters (o), bomb-
makers (b), and foot soldiers (f).  The model also includes 
equations for the intensity of several terrorism factors: 
financial support for the organization (m), intellectual level 
of the organization (i), public (in-country, local) support for 
the organization or cause (p), and world-wide support for the 
cause (w).  These elements all factor into the overall strength 
of the terror organization (s).  Considering counterinsurgency 
factors (all in upper case), we model:  public support for the 
counter-terrorism effort (C), the cooperative coalition (multi-
national/multi-agency) effort (CC), aggressiveness of direct 
CT operations (D), aggressiveness of intelligence gathering 
(G), aggressiveness of PSYOP/information distribution (P), 
aggressiveness of aid to the local public/host country 
government (A), aggressiveness of US/coalition logistics (L), 
and aggressiveness of US/coalition security (Y).   We then 
combine these COIN measures to determine the overall 
strength of the COIN operations (S).  The model consists of 
19 dependent factors with 19 equations and over 80 
parameters.  The roots of this differential equations model 
stem from ideas in [2, 3, 4, 5]. Many of the primary factors 
discussed in [6] for terrorism (T) and counter-terrorism (CT) 
operations are included in this model.  These equations are 
dynamic and time dependent as we use time (t) as our one 
independent variable.  
II. 
COALITION EFFECTIVENESS AND COLLABORATION 
One of the most important aspects of counterinsurgency 
operation is the effectiveness of the coalition of 
organizations and agencies involved in the operation [7].  
For the purposes of this simulation, we use a coalition 
network model that consists of three subgroups:  US 
agencies (governmental and nongovernmental), host country 
organizations, 
and 
world-wide 
organizations 
(other 
countries forces and agencies, world-level nongovernmental 
organizations, and UN organizations).     
COIN, IN, T and CT operations involve not only power, 
force, control, and other military-based components, but 
also diplomatic and nation-building elements of influence, 
politics, legitimacy, and service [6, 8, 9, 10, 11].  The 
agencies that work with the populace along with the military 
forces form the COIN/CT coalition that wages the 
counterinsurgency.   FM3-24, page 2.1, explains the roles 
these coalition partners play to succeed in COIN:  
“Although military efforts are necessary and important, they 
are only effective if integrated into a comprehensive 
strategy employing all instruments of national power…. The 
integration of civilian and military efforts is crucial in COIN 
and must be focused on supporting the local population and 
the HN government.  Political, social and economic 
programs are usually more valuable than conventional 
military operations as a means to address root causes of 
conflict and undermine an insurgency.  In COIN, military 
personnel, diplomats, police, politicians, humanitarian aid 
workers, contractors, and local leaders are faced with

making decisions and solving problems in a complex and 
acutely challenging environment” [6]. 
The coordination of effort and cooperation the coalition 
network is essential.  The JP 3-24 explains:  “Unified action 
refers 
to 
the 
synchronization, 
coordination, 
and/or 
integration of military operations with the activities of 
governmental and nongovernmental entities to achieve unity 
of effort. The military contribution to COIN must be 
coordinated with the activities of the United States 
Government, interagency partners, IGOs (Intergovernmental 
Organizations), NGOs (Nongovernmental Organizations), 
regional organizations, the operations of multinational 
forces, and activities of various HN (Host Nation) agencies 
to be successful…Successful interagency, IGO, and NGO 
coordination helps enable the USG to build international 
support, 
conserve 
resources, 
and 
conduct 
coherent 
operations that efficiently achieve shared goals.”   [9]. 
In summary from page 2-1 of FM 3-24, “The preference 
in COIN is always to have civilians carry out civilian tasks.  
Civilian agencies of individuals with the greatest expertise 
for a given task should perform it – with special preference 
for legitimate local civil authorities… the preferred or ideal 
division of labor is frequently unattainable.  The more 
violent the insurgency, the more unrealistic is this preferred 
division of labor” [6]. 
III. 
THE COALITION NETWORK MODEL 
In order to compute viable measurements for the 
effectiveness of the coalition, we represent the coalition 
with a network structure. We model the various 
organizations as nodes and the strength of the collaboration 
between the organizations as weighted edges.   More 
precisely, the weights on the edges are the percent of the 
perfect or desired collaboration between the two connecting 
organizations.  As indicated in [12], some organizations 
should maintain an intense collaboration with another 
organization because of the nature of their missions, 
whereas others may have little need to collaborate in COIN 
except to maintain communication of basic information.  
Therefore, in our model, a coalition network with perfect 
collaboration for their suited purposes is a completely 
connected graph with all its weighted links all set to 1 (or 
100% effective collaboration).   A completely dysfunctional 
coalition with none of the effective collaboration needed is 
modeled by a completely disconnected network graph.   
 
Our 
network 
metrics 
measure 
the 
strength 
of 
collaboration.  A coalition's collaboration strength (CCS) is 
the weighted density measure of the graph.  For a undirected 
graph, the sums of all the weighs of connecting edges (Σek, 
where k goes from 1 to Z, the total number of possible 
connections) are divided by the total possible connections of 
the graph Z=(M)(M-1)/2, where M is the number of nodes in 
the graph or total number of agencies in the network.   
Subgroups of the overall coalition produce two collaboration 
measures, its own internal collaboration strength (ICS) 
measured by only taking into account the network of the 
subgroup and the external collaboration strength (ECS) by 
taking into account the weights of links between the 
subgroup and its complement.  
IV. 
USING THE NETWORK METRICS IN THE COIN MODEL 
As indicated in the model description, one of the key 
elements in CT/COIN success and a major component in 
our model is the Cooperation/Coalition factor (CC).   We 
use a coalition network model with three subgroups of 1) 
US --- US forces and organizations (governmental and 
nongovernmental), 2) Host -- host country forces and 
organizations, and 3) World -- world-wide forces and 
organizations (other countries forces and agencies, world-
level 
nongovernmental 
organizations, 
and 
UN 
organizations) to calculate the metrics to use in our COIN 
model.  The ten network metrics we use are the seven 
Coalition Network Metrics of CCS, ICSUS, ECSUS, ICSWorld, 
ECSWorld, ICSHost, ECSHost, the Link Density (LD).   CC is 
computed as a weighted sum of these elements of the CT 
coalition network while also being proportional to the levels 
of aggressiveness of security (Y), aggressiveness of 
intelligence gathering (G), aggressiveness of PSYOP (P), 
aggressiveness of US aid (A), aggressiveness of CT logistics 
(L), number of nations in the coalition squared N2, and 
number of total organizations in the coalition as shown in 
(1).  The non-linear squared term for the number of nations 
is the key part of this measure showing the important nature 
of that aspect of Coalition strength.  The CC factor is an 
influential component of our dynamic COIN model

V. 
COIN SCENARIO USING COALITION NETWORKS 
To show the effects of the dynamics of the Coalition 
Network on the COIN model, we simulate a four-stage 
scenario of Coalition evolution.   Since each stage affects the 
COIN results, we will show the graph of the coalition 
network model, the computed collaboration metrics, and the 
results of running the COIN model for the six-month 
duration at each stage.  For this scenario, we keep all six of 
the resource levels equal and constant at 0.83 to run a 
balanced COIN strategy. 
A. Stage 1: The Initial Coalition (9 nodes) 
We start with the US Forces arriving in a Host country 
to form a small, weakly connected coalition with several 
Host country organizations.   This coalition has no elements 
outside those of the US and the Host country.   The 
Coalition is modeled by the 9-node network shown in Fig.1.  
We track the three subgroups US, Host, and World.  
Subgroup Host contains three nodes, Subgroup World has 
no nodes, and Subgroup US contains six nodes.   From the

collaboration weights, we compute the seven possible 
collaboration strength (CS) scores of CCS, ICSUS, ECSUS, 
ICSWorld, ECSWorld, ICSHost, ECSHost.   The CCS is computed 
as 4.5/36= 0.125.   For the Host Subgroup, ICSHost = 1.3/3 = 
0.43 and ECSHost=0.6/18=0.03.   For the World Subgroup, 
ICSWorls= 
ECSWorld=0, 
since 
there 
are 
no 
World 
organizations in the Coalition.  For the US Subgroup, 
ICSUS=2.6/15=0.173 and ECSUS= ECSHost=0.6/18=0.03, 
since there are only two subgroups present in the network, 
the External Collaboration scores must be the same.   The 
LD is 12/36=0.33.   We run the COIN model for 6 months 
to obtain the results shown in Table I along with the 
coalition metrics. The collaboration scores show that the US 
and Host country do not yet collaborate very effectively.

B. Stage 2: The Coalition Grows: World Organizations and 
Allied Force Arrives (16 nodes) 
At this stage, the coalition has added more US forces, 
maintained the same basic Host nation involvement, and 
added one other allied country force along with some UN 
and world-wide organizations.  The model for this 
rudimentary coalition of 16 nodes with the weights of the 
collaborations is shown in Fig. 2. 
This modest growth in the coalition increases the 
collaboration strengths from Stage 1.  The Subgroup Host 
contains 3 nodes, Subgroup World has 6 nodes, and 
Subgroup US contains 7 nodes.   We compute the seven 
possible collaboration strength (CS) scores of CCS, ICSUS, 
ECSUS, ICSWorld, ECSWorld, ICSHost, ECSHost.   The CCS is 
computed as 11.4/120= 0.095.   For the Host Subgroup, 
ICSHost = 1.4/3 = 0.47 and ECSHost=1.6/39=0.04.   For the 
World 
Subgroup, 
ICSWorls=2/15=0.133 
and 
ECSWorld=2.6/60=0.043. 
 
For 
the 
US 
Subgroup, 
ICSUS=4.3/21=0.20  and ECSUS=2.4/63=0.04.  The LD is 
27/120= 0.23.   
     We run the COIN model for six months to obtain the 
results shown in Table II along with the coalition metrics.   
 
These results show that the collaboration has improved with 
a higher CC score.

C. Stage 3: The Coaltion Expands (47 nodes) 
During this stage the Coalition grows substantially to 47 
organizations and five countries, but they are still sparsely 
linked with little collaborations across the three subgroups.  
One of the countries is involved diplomatically, but not 
militarily and contributes one node to the network  
("Involved Country Embassy").  This Coalition network is 
shown in Fig. 3. 
 
Subgroup Host contains 7 nodes, Subgroup World has 
17 nodes, and Subgroup US contains 23 nodes.   We show 
the collaboration and coalition metrics in Table III.  We run 
the COIN model for 6 months to obtain the results shown in 
Table III.

The rapid growth in the coalition results in a CCS of 
0.04, since the collaboration total is just 44.7 out of a 
possible of 1081.  Also, the coalition has a LD of 
123/1081=0.114.  Just a little over 11% of the possible 
coordination links are even established by the coalition.  
The increased size of the coalition (five counties and 47 
organizations) and the growing strengths of the three 
subgroups have resulted in the large increase in the CC 
value.  This increase in CC leads to small decreases in the 
insurgency measures and a large increase in the strength of 
the counter insurgency.  The effect is that the S/s ratio 
doubles during this Stage. 
D. Stage 4: The Military Forces Coalesce and Strengthen 
their Collaboarations (49 nodes) 
In this stage the military forces are able to coordinate 
their work within and between the US, the three Allied 
counties, and Host nation.  Only two new organizations 
enter the coalition in this stage.  Since the Involved country 
has now committed military forces, two new organizations 
(Allied Country 3 HQ and Allied Country 3 Army).   Most 
of the effort during this stage has been to strengthen existing 
military collaborations.   This new stronger Coalition 
network is shown in Fig. 4 with results provided in Table 
IV.

The increased cooperation of the military forces in the 
coalition results in increases in all eight collaboration

in the model and affect the insurgency elements --- all of 
which are decreasing. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
We used this rather small and simple scenario to simulate 
COIN operations in a dynamic environment to show the 
functionality of our coalition network model and its interface 
to the differential equations model.  The mathematical issues 
of combining large networks and large systems of 
differential and algebraic equations are not known.  
However, we see this combination as giving us better 
insights into the complexity of warfare.   Our hybrid model 
(force-on-force, COIN factors, and coalition network model) 
enables study of the most feared and possibly likely war of 
the future – a hybrid war.  As described in [13 and 14], these 
full spectrum conflicts will involve many elements of COIN-
CT-and full force-on-force operations along with the 
psychological aspects of conflict on the US populace, basic 
elements of which are found in our model.
