Abstract—In recent years, indoor positioning has emerged
as a critical function in many end-user applications; including
military, civilian, disaster relief and peacekeeping missions. To
cope with this surge of interest, much research effort has focused
on meeting the needs of these applications and overcoming
their shortcomings. Ultra WideBand (UWB) is an important
technology in the ﬁeld of indoor positioning and has shown
great performance compared to others. In this work, we identify
and analyze existing ultra wideband positioning technologies
and present a detailed comparative survey. We also provide
a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)
analysis, a method generally used in management science to
evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
involved in a product or technology, to analyze the present state
of UWB positioning technologies.

I. INTRODUCTION
Positioning is the process of determining a position of
people, equipment, and other objects. Recently, it has been
an active research area where much of the research focuses
on utilizing existing technologies to address the problem of
positions’ determination. Positioning can be classiﬁed, accord-
ing to the environment where the positioning is conducted,
into two types: outdoor positioning and indoor positioning.
Outdoor positioning is performed outside buildings and indoor
positioning is performed inside buildings such as houses,
hospitals, malls and others. Different applications may re-
quire different types of positioning technologies that ﬁt their
needs and constraints. For example, Global Positioning System
(GPS) is a technology that is suitable and efﬁcient for the
outdoor rather than the indoors since satellite radio signals
cannot penetrate solid walls and obstacles [1][2][3][4].
Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) determine the position
of something in a physical space continuously and in real-
time [5]. IPSs use numerous positioning approaches, which
vary greatly in terms of accuracy, cost, precision, technology,
scalability, robustness and security [2]. There are ﬁve main
quality metrics of the indoor positioning systems, which
should be considered: (1) accuracy and precision of the sys-
tem; (2) coverage and resolution of the coverage; (3) latency
in producing location updates; (4) impact of a building’s
infrastructure; and (5) effect of random errors on the system
such as errors caused by signal interference and reﬂection [6].
Indoor positioning has many applications such as indoor
navigation systems for blind and visually impaired people,
locating devices through buildings, aiding tourists in museums,
ﬁnding an emergency exit in a smoky environment, tracking
kids in crowded places, and tracking expensive equipment.
Indoor positioning applications may require different quality
attributes and thus IPSs should be carefully selected to meet
the requirements of the application.
Indoor location-based services are an important application
of indoor ubiquitous computing. Accurate position measure-
ment is a critical requirement for indoor positioning tech-
niques. Given that UWB is one of the key techniques that is
proven effective in indoor positioning, a comparative analysis
of the state-of-the-art UWB indoor positioning systems is
indeed required. Furthermore, due to the U.S. Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) recent allowance for the use of
unlicensed UWB communications, UWB civilian applications
have been studied and explored intensively worldwide. Also,
the development of international wireless communication stan-
dards that adopts UWB technology has encouraged research
and development efforts on UWB. Consequently, developing
new algorithms to improve UWB positioning performance is
becoming an active research area [7].
This work is motivated by the fact that UWB is the most
promising technology for indoor positioning and tracking.

Further, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst
analytical study of the state-of-the-art UWB indoor positioning
systems. Our study analyzes a wide range of positioning al-
gorithms that have empowered UWB positioning systems and
tackle different aspects of applications needs and requirements.
The nature of the application in question plays a major role
in determining the appropriate solution for achieving certain
quality attributes. Hybrid positioning approaches have future
potentials as they combine features of different approaches to
improve the performance.
Our contributions in this paper are twofold.
• We provide an updated literature review for existing
and recent research in UWB positioning systems (see
Sections II and III).
• We conduct a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and
Threats (SWOT) analysis for UWB technology, which
provide new directions and deeper insights into the state
of this technology beyond its well-known pros and cons
(see Section IV).
II. UWB POSITIONING
UWB is one of the most recent, accurate, and promising
technologies [8]. The precursor technology of UWB is referred
to as a base-band, impulse, and carrier-free technology. The
US Department of Defense is the ﬁrst to use the term ultra
wideband. At the late of 1990, the UWB was commercially
available [8]. UWB radio is a method of spectrum access
that can provide high speed data rate communication over the
personal area network space. UWB is based on transmitting
extremely short pulses and it uses techniques that cause a
spreading of the radio energy over a wide frequency band with
a very low power spectral density [8]. This high bandwidth
offers high data throughput for communication. The low
frequency of UWB pulses enables the signal to effectively
pass through obstacles such as walls and objects.
There are three main application areas for using UWB,
namely (1) communication and sensors; (2) positioning and
tracking; and (3) radar [8][9]. UWB positioning techniques
can provide real time indoor precision tracking for many
applications such as locator beacons for emergency services
and mobile inventory, indoor navigation for blind and visually
impaired people, people or instruments tracking, and military
reconnaissance. The characteristics of UWB signals provide
the potential of highly accurate position and location estima-
tion for indoor environments [10][8].
A. Why UWB has recently gained attention?
In general, UWB has different features that are explored
in the literature [8][3][11]. The high data rate of UWB can
reach 100 Megabits per second (Mbps), which makes it
a good solution for near-ﬁeld data transmission. Also, the
high bandwidth helps in reducing the effect of multipath
interference, which makes UWB a more desirable solution for
indoor positioning than other technologies [12]. In fact, UWB
provides a high accuracy rate in which error can be minimized
to sub-centimeters. Therefore, UWB is considered to be one of
the most suitable choices for critical positioning applications
that require highly accurate result.
UWB technology, unlike other positioning technologies
such as infra-red and ultrasound sensor, does not require
line-of-site and does not get affected by the existence of
other communication devices or external noise due to its high
bandwidth and signal modulation [13][14]. Furthermore, the
UWB equipment cost is low and it consumes less power
compared with other competitive solutions.
Many IPSs were implemented commercially using UWB.
One of the most known positioning systems that use UWB is
Ubisense system. In Ubisense system, a user carries tags that
transmit UWB signals to ﬁxed sensors that use the signals to
determine the user’s positions using Time of Arrival (TOA)
method [15].
B. Signal Modulation
Signal modulation is the process of carrying information
on the impulse signal (the carrier signal) by modifying one or
more of the signal properties. In general, signal modulation can
be categorized based on the signal state into three categories;
binary modulation, ternary modulation, and M-ary modulation.
Also, signal modulation can be categorized based on signal
properties that need to be modiﬁed into four categories; am-
plitude modulation, frequency modulation, phase modulation,
and hybrid modulation.
Signal modulation is a crucial phase in signal transmission,
which can greatly improve the quality of transmitting signals
to achieve certain quality criteria. For example, UWB signals
are usually transmitted in the existence of other signals in
the air as well as reﬂected signals which may cause multi-
path interference. Thus, UWB must have high modulation
efﬁciency as signals must be recognized correctly in the
presence of noise and interference [9].
There are various signal modulations that are used for
UWB, such as Pulse Position Modulation (PPM), On-Off
Keying (OOK), Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), and
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) [9][16]. Signal modulation
is utilized to enhance the accuracy of UWB localization [9].
In UWB, Time-Hopping Spread Spectrum (TH-SS) impulse
radio could be used to solve multipath problems and generate
UWB signals with relatively computational cost. There are
other modulations that are used by UWB such as Pseudo
Random (PR) time-modulation, Binary Phase Shift Keying
(BPSK), Time-Hopping Binary Phase Shift Keying (TH-
BPSK), Time-Hopping Pulse Position Modulation (TH-PPM),
and Minimum-Shift Keying (MSK) [6][17]. Further details
about using these modulation technologies in positioning are
presented in the next sections.
III. UWB POSITIONING ALGORITHMS
UWB technology is well-suited for indoor positioning
applications. In order to employ this technology, different

positioning algorithms have been developed in which position
information is extracted from radio signals traveling between
the target node and the reference nodes as well as position
information of the reference nodes. There are many positioning
algorithms that can be classiﬁed into ﬁve main categories
based on estimating measurements: (1) Angle of Arrival
(AOA); (2) Time of Arrival (TOA); (3) Time Difference of
Arrival (TDOA); (4) Received Signal Strength (RSS); and (5)
hybrid algorithm. In this section, we give a detailed review
of these algorithms for UWB indoor positioning. Also, we
compare the algorithms in different aspects such as accuracy,
environment, estimation technique, range, purpose of use and
others. A summary and comparison of UWB positioning
algorithms is presented in Table I.
A. AOA-based Algorithms
In AOA technique, the estimation of the signal reception
angles from at least two sources are compared either with
signal amplitude or carrier-phase across multiple antennas.
From the intersection of the angle line for each signal source,
the location can be found. AOA estimation algorithms are
very sensitive to many factors, which may cause errors in
68

SENSORCOMM 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications

their estimation of target position. Furthermore, AOA estima-
tion algorithms have a higher complexity compared to other
methods. For instance, the antenna array geometry has an
important role in the estimation algorithm [18]. Increasing
the distance between the sender and receiver may decrease
the accuracy [19]. AOA technique can be used with other
techniques to increase the accuracy [20].
AOA based algorithms have been used in many literatures.
Xu et al. presented a new cooperative positioning method
based on the AOAs, which utilizes pairwise AOAs information
among all the sensor nodes rather than relying only on anchor
nodes [21]. Lee proposed the using of signal model and
weighted-average to estimate AOA parameters for Low data
Rate UWB (LR-UWB) [22]. A Kalman ﬁlter based AOA
estimation algorithm was introduced by Subramanian, which
rely on a new linear quadratic frequency domain frequency
invariant beamforming strategy [23].
Furthermore, many studies have been conducted to evaluate
the performance of AOA for different applications, environ-
ments, hardware, and conﬁgurations. Mok et al. studied the
feasibility and performance of AOA for UWB in Ubisense
Real-Time Location System (RTLS) when integrated with
GPS to facilitate resource management in underground railway
construction sites [24]. The inﬂuence of UWB directional
antennas on the performance of AOA estimation was presented
in detail by Gerok et al. [25]. Gerok et al. presented a corrected
AOA estimation algorithm, which mitigates the error resulting
from the UWB directional antenna.
B. TOA-based Algorithms
TOA is based on the intersection of circles for multiple
transmitters. The radius of those circles is the distance between
the transmitter and receiver. This distance is calculated by
ﬁnding one-way propagation time between them [19]. The
time synchronization of all transmitters is required while the
receiver synchronization is unnecessary so that any possibility
of signiﬁcant delays must be accounted for during calculation
of the correct distances.
Choliz et al. identiﬁed a realistic indoor scenario, deﬁned
by a layout of walls and corridors, and a speciﬁc indoor
UWB ranging model to evaluate different kinds of TOA based
algorithms for UWB such as Trilateration, Weighted Least
Square with Multidimensional Scaling (WLS-MDS), Least
Square with Distance Contraction (LS-DC), Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF) [26].
TOA based algorithms have been used to locate targeted
objects for various applications and environments. Cheng et
al. designed TOA-based personnel localization system for coal
mine using UWB technology, which can be very helpful
to locate workers effectively in case of accidents [10]. For
mobile robot tracking, Segura et al. proposed a novel UWB
navigation system for indoor environment, which employ a
TOA based estimation algorithm to accurately locate mobile
robot [12]. Fischer et al. designed a monolithic integrated
transceiver chipset for UWB to use them in indoor localization
systems where TOA techniques have been used for position
estimation [27]. The system was implemented for Line-of-
Sight environment and its accuracy was estimated to be 8.3
cm. On the other hand, Tom’e et al. designed and built a large-
scale deployable UWB-based Local Positioning System (LPS)
in which TOA is used for position estimation [28].
C. TDOA-based Algorithms
TODA is based on measuring the time difference of arrival
of a signal sent by an object and receive by three or more re-
ceivers. In this manner, the location of the object (transmitter)
will be determined. Also, the scenario can be ﬂipped where a
single receiver can determine the target location by measuring
the difference in arrival times of two transmitted signals [19].
Typically, only one transmitter is available that requires the
multiple receivers to share the data and cooperate to determine
the location of the transmitter. This cooperation requires
signiﬁcant bandwidth in comparison with other algorithms.
Krishnan et al. have used TDOA for UWB indoor posi-
tioning system where the site has been divided into cells and
each cell has four UWB readers mounted on the top corners
to have line-of-sight with user tag. In this manner, the readers
will be able to receive the signals from the user tag then send
the time of arrival to a central processing unit to determine
TDOA and ﬁnd user location [14]. Rowe et al. designed
one dimensional system with two sensors and one tag using
TDOA based algorithm to determine the tag location [29].
On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation was used to overcome the
collision deduced by synchronous tag transmission, increase
the performance, and decrease the cost and power at the same
time.
D. RSS-based Algorithms
In RSS-based algorithms, the tracked target measures the
signal strength for received signals from multiple transmitters
in order to use signal strength as an estimator of the distance
between the transmitters and receiver. This way, the receiver
will be able to estimate its position relative to the transmitter
nodes. Although RSS is sensitive to multipath interference and
small scale channel effect, which cause a random deviation
from mean received signal strength, it is used frequently
with unrealistic assumptions such as transmitted power and
path loss exponent are known, and transmitter antennas are
isotropic [19][30]. According to Pittet et al., the accuracy of
RSS for Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) and multipath environ-
ment is low, which shows clearly that RSS is not the right
estimation method for indoor positioning systems [31]. Gigl et
al. explored the performance of RSS algorithms for positioning
using UWB technology [32]. They also studied the effect
of small scale fading on the system accuracy; however, a
simulator based on the UWB channel model 802.15.4a was
used to evaluate the algorithms rather than relying on real
scenarios for indoor environments.

RSS based algorithms can be classiﬁed into two main types:
trilateration and ﬁngerprinting [33]. Trilateration algorithms
use RSS measurements to estimate the distances to three dif-
ferent reference node and hence estimate the current location.
On the other hand, ﬁngerprinting requires collecting a dataset
of RSS ﬁngerprints of a scene, which is later used to match
on-line measurements with the closest ﬁngerprint in the dataset
in order to estimate the location.
E. Hybrid-based Algorithms
When multiple positioning techniques are used, they can
complement each other or target different parts of the site that
ﬁt with their strengths. Overall accuracy will increase and the
complexity and cost will increase, too. Jiang et al. presented a
tracking system for staff, patients, and instruments in a hospital
environment [34]. They used GPS for outdoor tracking and
UWB for indoor tracking. Furthermore, the site was divided
into cells where each cell has at least 4 UWB readers and GBS
repeater. They used PDA, which has built-in GPS receiver and
it was connected to UWB tag in order to work with both GPS
and UWB at the same time. The UWB subsystem uses both
AOA and TDOA received by UWB readers to estimate the user
position. Similarly, Kuhn et al. designed a multi-tag access
scheme for UWB localization system, in which Minimum-
Shift Keying (MSK) modulation was used with 2.40-2.48,
5.40-10.6 Gigahertz (GHz) frequency and refresh rate of 1-
20 Hz in the range of 1m-100m [17]. Also, they have used
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) for channel access
control. TDOA was used to discover new tags and identify its
position in 3D. Experimentally, it uses two tags and switches
between them 20 times per second.
A new pedestrian navigation solution has been introduced
by Pittet et al., which combines UWB localization system and
Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors (MEMS) to improve the
performance of pedestrian positioning [31]. AOA and TDOA
were used to know the presence of multipath and position
estimation. Furthermore, they used an Extended Kalman Fil-
ter (EKF) based algorithms to couple the measurement of
these two subsystems in order to combine the complementary
advantages of UWB and MEMS. Another system has been
introduced by Shahi et al., which consists of a network of
tags and receivers communicating over 68 GHz signals [11].
The path from transmitter to receiver is measured to locate the
tag. The true location is determined by the direct path signals;
however, the error was produced by reﬂections of the signals.
The direct path signal can be distinguished from reﬂection
using UWB, so the accuracy increases. The computation is
calculated in one master server, which uses AOA and TDOA
for estimation. Also, FuCheng and MingJing designed UWB
localization and tracking system based on Kalman, linear H
and extended H ﬁlters to accurately estimate the target position
using DOA and TOA [35]. Their system was implemented in
30x30 meter cell with one access point, which is equipped
with 4 elements array and noise statistics.
Several other systems have been developed for critical
missions to help in tracking people and object. An UWB
indoor/outdoor NLOS localization system has been imple-
mented for disaster aid, in which GPS is used for outdoor
localization while UWB is used for indoor localization [36].
TDOA and RSS are used to improve localization performance.
Another UWB tracking system for athlete has been presented
by Mucchi et al. in order to determine the athlete’s speed
and acceleration and analyze his/her performance after med-
ical surgery [37]. They have implemented their system for
outdoor environments with different cell sizes and for indoor
environments using 4 sensors. The system was implemented
for Line-Of-Sight (LOS) environment setup and uses TOA and
AOA for positions’ estimation with good accuracy. Another
system was designed by DeiBler et al., which tackles the
problem of simultaneous localization and mapping in an
emergency like an earthquake, ﬁre, or terrorist attacks [38].
The system was designed to perform UWB indoor mapping
using a mobile antenna array with two receiver antennas and
one transmitter between them. DeiBler et al. used Kalman
ﬁlter for position estimation and Rao-Blackwellized particle
ﬁlter for data association and initialization of new objects.
Furthermore, a new UWB indoor navigation system was
proposed by Segura et al., which includes two sub-systems: the
location system and Mobile Robot (MR) control system [12].
They detect the ﬁrst arrival of signal by designing a novel
dynamic threshold crossing algorithm and using TOA/TDOA
for estimation. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is
used to avoid multi-users interference.
Several other efforts have been done to improve positioning
in UWB using hybrid based algorithms. Digel et al. designed
and improved a digitizer of no-coherent Impulse Radio Ultra
WideBand (IR-UWB) [39]. Jiang et al. designed a technique to
mitigate NLOS error by using Biased Kalman Filtering (BKF)
and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) where both AOA
and RSS were used [40]. Srimathi and Kannan made a
comparison between Time-Hopping Spread-Spectrum (TH-
SS), Time-Hopping Binary Phase-Shift Keying (TH-BPSK),
and TH-SS coded and un-coded scheme UWB systems [41].
Zebra is a commercial UWB positioning system, that offers
a UWB Real-Time Location System (RTLS) integrated with
other RTLS, which can use technologies, such as GPS, Radio
Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) and Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) [17].
IV. SWOT ANALYSIS
SWOT analysis is a useful analysis tool to understand and
evaluate a technology, solution or business. SWOT analysis
aims to identify the key internal (strengths and weaknesses)
and external (opportunities and threats) factors that may affect
the success of an analyzed target. SWOT analysis has been
applied in many areas such as; industry, management and
engineering. Here, we apply the SWOT analysis to evaluate
UWB in terms of strength, weakness, opportunities and threats

analysis is shown in Table II.
A. Strength
One advantage of using UWB is being licensed free because
of its low power. UWB is not classiﬁed as a radio equipment
as its low power signal does not interfere with most of the
existing radio systems [42]. In addition, UWB has a very high
level of multipath resolution because of its large bandwidth.
Large bandwidth provides frequency diversity that makes Time
Modulated Ultra WideBand (TM-UWB) signal resistant to the
multipath problems and interference [42]. Time Modulated
UWB has a low probability of interception and detection,
which it is used in some applications, particularly in the
military.
The large bandwidth is the main feature of the UWB wire-
less systems. This feature offers an improved channel capacity
and high data rate communication in digital communication
systems [43]. The channel capacity is deﬁned by Shannons
law, where is the channel capacity is proportional to the
bandwidth (B) and the log of Signal to noise ratio
S
N plus
one.
C = B log2

(1)
In addition to the advantage of large bandwidth, it is
potential for high processing gain in communication systems.
Processing gain for real Direct-Sequence of UWB (DS-UWB)
modulation systems is deﬁned as two times ratio of noise
bandwidth at the front end of the receiver to the noise
bandwidth of symbol rate. Here is the formula of DS-UWB
processing gain [43]:
PG = 2 × Noise Bandwidth
Symbol Rate
(2)
The large processing gain offers a greater immunity distortion
and noise. It allows negative Signal to Interference and Noise
Ratio (SINR) to be recovered [43].
UWB signals have greater penetration of obstacles (such as
71

SENSORCOMM 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications

walls) than conventional signals, and they achieve same data
rate [44]. Furthermore, UWB transmissions involve very short
pulses, which have recently received signiﬁcant interest. Very
short pulses offer an advantage in terms of resolvability of
multipath components [44]. Many received signals in an envi-
ronment that are characterized by multipath is a superposition
of the delayed replicas of the signal. This has been avoided
in UWB because the reﬂection from objects and surfaces near
the path between transmitter and receiver tend to not overlap
in time because of the very short pulses of UWB. This means
UWB has a desirable direct resolvability of direct multipath
components.
UWB technologys carrierless transmission property offers
the advantage of hardware simplicity and small hardware.
UWB transceivers can be built with much simpler radio fre-
quency architecture than narrowband systems with fewer com-
ponents. Also, there is no need for power ampliﬁer because of
its low power consumption [44]. In general, UWB hardware is
considered to be simple and the hardware simplicity depends
on the application and operational scenario. For example, the
transmitter does not need Analog to Digital (A/D) converter,
digital pulse shaping ﬁlter, or equalizer to correct carrier phase
distortion [44].
B. Weakness
Although UWB has many strengths for different applica-
tions, it has some weakness. One of these weaknesses is the
possibility of interference with nearby systems [43]. In the
United States, the UWB frequency range for communication
applications is 3.1 to 10.6 GHz, which is operating in the
same frequencies as popular communication products such as
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)
and digital TV. In some countries, it may also interfere
with some systems such as third-generation 3G wireless
systems [43]. There are some concerns that several UWB
devices may cause harmful interference to GPS and aircraft
navigation radio equipment [44]. To overcome those concerns,
different techniques have been developed to eliminate harmful
interference with other sensitive services, such as Detection
and Avoidance (DAA) [43].
Also interference may happen from the existing system to
the UWB system. The UWB systems signals may spread
over other bandwidths that contain existing frequency of
narrowband systems [44]. This interference can be elevated
by using Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) multiuser
detection schemes to reject strong narrowband interference.
Although using very short pulses in UWB has many advan-
tages, the UWB receiver requires signal acquisition, synchro-
nization and tracking to be done with very high precision in
time relative to the pulse rate. These steps of processes are
time-consuming and take a long time to be performed [44].
There are some techniques for reducing this time such as using
preamble sequence for rapid acquisition.
C. Opportunities
UWB becomes a choice for many systems that require high
accuracy such in building robot guidance and tracking systems
to utilize its advantages. Furthermore, UWB is used for medi-
cal applications that require sub-millimeters of accuracy [15].
In addition, UWB is used in radars in order to improve their
high performance [45].
For indoor localization systems, there are multipath reﬂec-
tions from objects inside rooms, which negatively impact radio
signals. However UWB signals have time resolution, which
offers a high resolution positioning applications to solve the
multipath problems [43].
As mentioned before, UWB communication signals have
short pulses. Those short pulse signals can be utilized in non-
communication purposes [44]. For instance, the low power
UWB RFID tag transmitters have been used to locate objects
with an accuracy proportional to the inverse of the signal
bandwidth.
UWB could be beneﬁcial for industry and service providers
in many applications such as Sensor, Positioning, and Identi-
ﬁcation Network (SPIN) systems [46]. These systems need
a large number of devices (sensors and tags) in industrial
warehouses to transmit low-rate data combined with position
information. This allows the devices to operate over long
distance (around 100m) between mobile tags and sensors of
UWB.
There are some challenges for using Radio Frequency (RF)
operation for the shipboard environment. Using UWB and
network analyzer measurements offers good opportunities for
NLOS communication for indoor and on ships [44]. It allows
signals to propagate well aboard ships and around objects,
which provide reasonable accuracy to determine positions.
UWB is used in radar in order to improve its high perfor-
mance [45].
D. Threats
UWB usually does not have a negative impact on the
neighbor’s devices because there are some techniques that
are used to avoid the interference with other devices [15].
However, UWB is still commercially expensive compared to
other technologies (see [9] for further limitations).
While UWB systems are known to be robust against multi-
path reﬂection issues, they are not totally immune to multipath
effects [46]. One of these cases is when there is an extreme
ratio of link distance to antenna height. This may result in
signal losses and propagation delay that lasts to tens or even
hundreds of nanoseconds.
The design and implementation of antennas for UWB sys-
tems can be more challenging than the bandwidth and variable
conditions of operation [46]. This may add some limitations
to UWB systems in comparison with conventional RF.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Positioning is one of the most important and challenging
phases in navigation systems where different technologies have
been developed to improve performance. In this paper, we
presented an analytic study of UWB positioning, in which a
detailed and updated overview of UWB indoor positioning
techniques has been presented. Furthermore, we presented
a SWOT analysis of UWB technology, focusing mainly on
positioning applications, in which internal factors (strengths
and weaknesses) as well as external factors (opportunities
and threats) have been identiﬁed and analyzed. UWB systems
have emerged as one of the leading technologies for indoor
positioning and have been used in many more applications
than before.
