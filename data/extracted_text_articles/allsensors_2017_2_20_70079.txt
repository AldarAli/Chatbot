Abstract — In this study, a novel approach for optical imaging 
of tissue based on diffusely reflected photons was investigated. 
The examination object was an established solid breast 
phantom, which contains two absorbing lesions at different 
depths. The aim was to generate an absorption contrast image 
using depth discrimination to detect a lesion. The main 
questions was whether the required depth sensitivity is 
achievable with a near infrared line light source and a charge-
coupled-device-camera. Different light sources were examined 
by comparative measurements. During the investigations 
observed speckle-effects could be reduced. The results of this 
study indicate that a translation of the approach from the 
breast phantom to in vivo studies appears feasible. 
 
Keywords— near infrared remission; optical tomography; deph 
sensitivity. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Diffuse optical imaging is a powerful tool to gain 
physiological and functional information from healthy and 
diseased tissue [1]. With near-infrared radiation in the 650 
nm to 1000 nm wavelength range tissue concentrations of 
characteristic 
absorbers 
such 
as 
oxygenated 
and 
deoxygenated 
hemoglobin 
can 
be 
determined 
non-
invasively. Main applications of diffuse optical imaging 
include the detection and characterization of tumors, e.g.,, in 
the female breast [2], functional studies on the human brain 
[3] - [5], as well as tissue oxygenation measurements in 
muscles [6], [7]. Furthermore, contrast agents offer the 
possibility to exploit molecular signatures for early detection 
of diseases [8] - [19]. 
A challenging task in diffuse optical imaging is to obtain 
either fully three-dimensional images of tissue regions with 
high 
spatial 
resolution 
or, 
at 
least, depth-resolved 
information about the distribution of tissue absorbers of 
interest. Accordingly, different techniques have been 
developed such as 3D tomographic imaging, oblique 
projection imaging in transmission, time-resolved or 
spatially resolved detection of reflectance, as well as laminar 
optical tomography [20] - [22].  
Currently our research group, Labor Prozessmess- und 
Stelltechnik at the Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft 
Berlin (HTW Berlin, university of applied science) with 
support from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt 
Berlin (PTB, The National Metrology Institute of Germany), 
is developing a new procedure for near infrared (NIR) 
measurements [23] - [26], which has the potential to detect 
and depict changes in human tissue in a way suitable  for 
medical diagnostics . This patented procedure [24] can 
complement and partly replace current radiologic imaging 
methods. This is desirable, since current technologies work 
with ionizing radiation and partly with radioactive markers 
(Scintigraphy-tracer), and therefore, additionally burden 
patients health. 
Our proposed approach is a combination of two well-
known 
methods: 
the 
light-section 
method 
(laser 
triangulation) [27] and the laminar optical tomography 
(LOT) [21], [22]. How it is possible to generate a 3D-scan by 
the light-section method in a very cost-effective way and 
how tomographic information of an examination object 
maybe combined with topographic information of the same 
object are subject-matters of other studies [23] - [26] and will 
not be described in this paper.  
A. Aim of the Study 
 
One of the most qualifying properties of the proposed 
procedure is the depth in which information can be 
obtained.  
 
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the LOT-
principle. It depicts how to get optical information from 
inside of the examination object using a remission 
geometry.  
 
A line generator and a light detector are placed at the 
same side of the examination object. The light source (a 
NIR-laser or NIR-light emission diode) projects a line on 
the surface of the examination object. A camera works as 
the light detector and takes images. The intensities of 
image-pixels in the vicinity of an “offset-line” are analyzed. 
 
 Measurements were carried out on an established solid-
body phantom of a female breast in order to assess the depth 
sensitivity of the proposed procedure. 
 
Extracted information of intrinsic absorbers from this 
mammary phantom are detected in both lateral and depth 
dimensions.

B. Structure of the paper 
   The paper is divided into four main sections. Following 
the introduction in section 1, the section 2 contains a short 
description of the theoretical photon paths in a scattering 
medium as well as a description of the experimental setup 
and of the characteristics of the employed breast phantom. In 
section 3 measurement results are shown and interpreted. In 
section 4, the last one, we present a conclusion and an 
outlook into future work. 
 
II. 
GENERATION OF DEPTH INFORMATION 
The fundamentals of the investigation method are 
subdivided 
into 
a 
theoretical 
simulation 
and 
the 
experimental realization. 
A. Theoretical Model 
 
To gather information from the depth of a scattering 
medium, one possible approach is to have a local offset 
between the side where the photons enter the object and 
where they leave it. The possible depth resolution is 
dependent on this offset. The theoretical resolution can be 
estimated by solving the optical diffusion equation or by 
using Monte Carlo simulations of light transport. 
 
Fig. 2 depicts simulation results for two different local 
offsets in remission geometry according to the photon 
diffusion model. 
 
Photon bananas (i.e., banana formed curves in the 
diagram) are colored depending on the probability of 
photons passing this area.  
The spread of the photon banana characterizes which optical 
differences inside the tissue can be detected through this 
measurement. 
 
Additionally, Fig. 2 shows that under the assumed 
conditions, a depth resolution of about 1cm is to be expected 
[23].

detector position 
 
B. Experimental Realization 
1) Experimental Setup  
    Experiments were carried out with a remission 
geometry setup as depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. A camera is 
mounted perpendicular to the test object, which allows 
spatially-resolved detection of the diffusely reflected light. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Scheme of the experimental setup 
 
The line generator emits light with an angle of 24° with 
respect to the optical axis of the camera. 
Light source and camera are mounted on a motorized 
translation stage and moved together over the examination 
object in a linear fashion.  
 
Camera images were acquired with a step size of 1.25 
mm using an exposure times of typically 4 ms to 10 ms. 
 
A photographic image of the realized experimental 
setup is shown in Fig. 4. An industrial charge-coupled 
device (CCD) camera (Allied Vision Gruppy Pro F125) 
with enhanced NIR sensitivity and equipped with a high 
aperture c-mount objective [24] is employed as photon 
detector. The camera has a quantum efficiency of 24% in 
the wavelength range of 780-785nm, which was used for the 
experiments. Furthermore, the camera has a resolution of 
1292x964 pixels. 
 
The following light sources were investigated as 
possible line generators:

2) Examination Object 
 
 
 
We used an established phantom of the female breast  
provided by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt 
Berlin (PTB the National Metrology Institute of Germany) 
as examination object (Fig. 5). 
 
The phantom has two embedded spherical lesions with 
a diameter of 10 mm each (Fig. 5). 
 
The center of the superficial lesion (lesion 1) is 10mm 
below the surface. The center of the second lesion (lesion 2) 
is 25 mm below the surface. Accordingly, the top of the 
lesions is 5 mm respectively 20 mm below the surface.

The optical properties of the phantom are:  
• 
µa(lesion 1) = 0.17 cm-1,  
• 
µa(lesion 2) = 0.20 cm-1,  
• 
µs‘(lesion 1) = 7.9 cm-1,  
• 
µs‘(lesion 2) = 7.7 cm-1,  
• 
µa(background) = 0.043 cm-1,  
• 
µs‘(background) = 8.3 cm-1. 
 
Both lesions exhibit roughly a 5-fold absorption-enrichment 
compared to the surrounding background. 
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Fig. 6 depicts the normalized absorption images of a 
rectangular image section (Fig. 5b) of the phantom obtained 
with the different light sources (see 2.2.1). The superficial 
lesion is detectable with all three light sources; moreover its 
size can be estimated to a high degree. 
 
In contrast to lesion 1, lesion 2 that is 25 mm below the 
surface cannot be seen in Fig. 7. Lesion 2 remains also 
hidden for higher offset values due to the limits in the 
dynamic range and in the signal-to-noise ratio. 
 
From these result, we conclude, that the proposed 
procedure: 
• 
Is suitable to detect inhomogeneities (e.g.,, lesions) 
in human tissue up to a depth of 1cm, 
• 
is most likely not adequate to find inhomogeneities 
(e.g., lesions) in human tissue, which are deeper 
than 2cm under the surface of the skin.

Figure 6. Detection of  the lesion 1 in the phantom of a mammary 
 
The objects in Fig. 6 show an oval-shaped distortion 
along the (horizontal) scan direction. As illustrated in Fig. 7, 
this effect is caused by the specific source-detector 
arrangement in our measurement. When moving source and 
detector with the fixed offset across a lesion, the 
propagation of photons is affected by the lesion two times, 
once for the light source and once for the detector being 
close to the lesion position (Fig. 7).   
 
 
Figure 7. Horizontal distorsion 
 
The image quality obtained with the continuous-wave 
laser (cw-laser) source (Fig. 6a) is worse than with the other 
two light sources due to the speckle effect. When using the 
LED light source, this effect is not present due to the 
incoherent nature of its light. The speckle effect is also 
suppressed when applying the picosecond pulsed diode laser 
which has a much broader spectral width than the cw-laser.  
 
The results of the high-power LED and the picosecond-
pulse-laser are similar in overall quality. Since the 
picosecond-pulse-laser is more expensive and more 
complicated in usage, we conclude that the high-power LED 
is the best tested light source for practical application. 
 
This perception is confirmed by calculation of the 
image contrast to noise ratio (CNR) for different 
experiments (Tables 1, 2). 
 
The contrast is defined as the difference in signal 
intensity or gray-scale value between the side of the lesion 
and the side of ambient tissue. Dividing this value by the 
ambient noise (standard deviation, SD), the result is the 
contrast-to-noise ratio CNR. The used region of interests 
(ROI) to find the signal intensity SA of the ambient tissue, 
the signal intensity SL of the detected lesion and a range to 
calculate the standard deviation (SD, sigma) in this study 
are shown in Fig. 8. 
 
The CNR is determined  over the equation: 
 
 
SL is the signal value at the center position of the detected 
lesion, while SA is an average value and SD is the 
corresponding standard deviation of an ambient tissue are of 
100 * 100 pixels (≈ 8 mm * 8 mm).   
 
 
Figure 8. Special areas in the tomographic picture to calculate the contrast 
to noise ratio 
 
The contrast to noise ratio in Fig. 6a (CNR = 14) is 
significantly worse rated than in Fig. 6b (CNR = 27) or Fig. 
6c (CNR = 25). 
 
Beside the kind of light source, other parameters have 
an effect to the CNR (Tables 1, 2): 
• 
the applied power of the light source, 
• 
the integration-time of the camera.

The general expectation is that both, an increase of the 
source power and an increase of the integration time of the 
detector, improve the CNR. But due to the speckle-effects 
the cw-laser produces better results in low intensity mode 
because the device goes below the laser threshold and acts 
mainly as an incoherent LED.

With spatial averaging an additional improvement with 
respect to speckle-interferences can be achieved. (CNR = 
64, Fig. 9). 
 
This shows that even a coherent light source can 
produce a good contrast to noise ratio, if the speckle 
interference is eliminated. But even a CNR of 64 generated 
only limited additional value, i.e., the deeper positioned 
lesion 2 is still not detectable. Nonetheless with a higher 
CNR the edges of lesion 1 are less blurred.

reduced speckle-interferences by spatial averaging 
 
The chemical and optical properties of the breast 
phantom are stable over long periods of time. This allowed 
us to conduct multiple experiments with different light 
sources. 
 
Due to the similar results of the high-power LED and 
the picosecond-pulsed laser, the high-power LED is able to 
replace the more costly picosecond-pulse-laser in future 
tests.  
 
Furthermore, our study shows that industrial CCD 
cameras are suitable detectors.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
 
In conclusion, this paper demonstrates that the proposed 
approach with lineshape light source and camera based 
detection of diffusely remitted light is feasible. With the 
current results we can infer that a purely optical recognition 
of intrinsic absorbing lesions in human tissue will be 
restricted to a near surface area, if our approach is used. But 
the actual limits of this approach have yet to be determined. 
For example, an increase in the local offset will likely 
increase the possible detection depth. To the best of our 
knowledge, a recognition depth of 1.5-2 cm seems practical 
in an assembly of remission. 
 
Future research on the depth resolution of intrinsic 
absorbers in human tissue can build on the results of this 
study. One possibility would be the use of established liquid 
phantoms, which allow adjusting the depth of the lesion 
continuously. Since high-power LEDs are a cheap and an 
effective light source for this kind of experiments, we hope 
that this will enable more research in this area. 
 
Due to the fact that the lesions in the used phantom are 
considered being realistic models of typical pathological 
changes in human tissue, the results for in-vivo 
investigations are expected to be similar. 
 
With this in mind, the results seem to be very 
promising, since the proposed method has a high potential 
for medical diagnostic procedures.
