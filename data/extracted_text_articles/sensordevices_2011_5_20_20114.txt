Abstract—The article reports a promising approach to 
engineering biocompatible and highly piezoresistive membrane 
for flexible weightless transparent pressure sensors. The 
developed membrane is based on a bi layer (BL) film 
composing a polycarbonate (PC) matrix “self-metallized” with 
a highly piezoresistive organic molecular metal. The key role of 
the matrix thickness in the enhancement of the pressure 
sensitivity of BL film-based membranes was shown. The 
presented approach permits engineering biocompatible all-
organic membranes with pressure sensitivity being of 8 
Ω/mmHg. To determine restrictions for BL films applications 
in biomedical high-tech, the effect of the body temperature on 
membrane piezoresitive properties was studied. The pressure 
tests at 26 oC, 33 oC and 40 oC showed that the body 
temperature does not significantly influence on the membrane 
pressure sensitivity. Therefore this type of membrane sensors 
is able to take the place of conventional metal-based strain and 
pressure gages in monitoring biomedical high-tech.

INTRODUCTION 
Among the more challenging tasks undertaken in the 
field of sensors is design and manufacture of reliable, robust 
pressure sensors for plastic electronics [1-8]. There is also a 
continuing need to lower the cost of sensors utilized in 
pressure sensing applications. To lower the cost and raise 
efficiency of sensors, few components, less expensive 
materials and fewer manufacturing-processing steps are 
necessary. For some applications size and weight constraints 
may be as important as or more than cost. For example, in 
biomedicine, catheter-based devices must occupy small 
volume, or they cannot be used at all [1, 6, 8]. In order to 
achieve these goals pressure sensors could be made of 
organic materials, along with low cost processing steps. 
Most of all-organic pressure sensors compose of a polymeric 
material surfaced with a conducting polymer layer [1, 7] The 
conducting 
polymer 
layers 
are 
preferably 
grown 
electrochemically [6]. Therefore, making sensitive covering 
layers based on conductive polymers requires both the use of 
specific electrochemical equipments and deposition of 
conventional metallic electrodes on the surface of a 
polymeric matrix [6, 7]. This method offers many problems 
that must be worked out: the adhesion between conducting 
layers, substrates, and electrodes, the growth of conductive 
polymer should be in a reproducible manner, a limited area 
between two electrodes applying for electrochemistry etc. 
Moreover, the conductive polymers tend to degrade rapidly, 
resulting in sensors having only a relative short lifespan.  
In this context surfacing plastics with “soft” organic 
molecular metals [9] which have been developed in order to 
replace heavy-weight metals in traditional technologies, is 
able to overcome the above mentioned problems. Organic 
molecular metals are attractive for covering polymeric films 
for many reasons; below we will list four main ones. First, 
these synthetic metals demonstrate good long term stability. 
Second, the set of hydrogen bonds presented in the crystal 
structures of all organic molecular conductors [9] endows 
their crystallites with high elasticity and, therefore, they are 
able to withstand large deformation. Third, due to soft crystal 
structures the conducting bands of organic molecular 
conductors can be easily deformed and, therefore, the 
electrical resistance of molecular metals responds strongly to 
deformation [10, 11]. Fourthly, a simple single- or two-stage 
covering procedure has been developed to prepare such 
“metallized” polymeric films [12, 13] The method consists in 
switching on a redox reaction in the swollen surface of a 
polymer film that provokes the nucleation of small clusters 
of a molecular conductor, which are able to growth into a 
conductive polycrystalline layer. This covering process 
occurs at room or moderate (33oC) temperature.  
It should be noted that the above mentioned approach to 
covering plastics lived up to expectations. Recently we

reported 
that 
polycarbonate 
films 
surfaced 
with 
polycrystalline layers of organic molecular metals α-, β-
(ET)2I3, were ET=bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene (Fig. 
1), revealed a giant tenso-resistance effect [14-16].  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Skeletal formula of bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene (ET). 
These bi-layer (BL) films are attracting large attention 
due to their ability to combine properties such as electrical 
conductivity, 
high 
sensitivity 
to 
strain 
(pressure), 
lightweight, and flexibility [12-16]. Moreover, it has been 
shown that BL films can be successfully integrate in textiles 
[17].  
In order that a tenso-resistive BL film can sense pressure 
changes, it has to be located as a membrane. With this in 
mind, the first prototype of a contact sensing lens equipped 
with a membrane pressure sensor based on the above 
mentioned piezoresistive BL film has been developed for 
monitoring intraocular pressure (IOP) changes: a 25 µm 
thick polycarbonate film covered  with molecular metal β-
(ET)2I3 was used as a flexible pressure sensor [18]. The tests 
showed that this BL film-based sensing membrane, being 
biocompatible, is able to control IOP changes with 
sensitivity of 1,4 Ω/mmHg; the pressure tests were made at 
room temperature (26 oC) [18, 19]. In order to adapt flexible 
tenso-resistive biocompatible BL film-based membranes for 
pressure monitoring in biomedical high-tech two key 
questions to be answered are: (1) is it possible to improve 
membrane sensitivity to pressure? and (2) does the body 
temperature 
significantly 
influence 
on 
membrane 
piezoresistive properties?  
The goal of our study was a search for experimental data 
being able to answer on the above mentioned questions. We 
suggested that decreasing the thickness of a membrane’s 
plastic component (polycarbonate matrix) on retention of the 
thickness of a membrane’s piezoresistive layer has to 
enhance the membrane pressure sensitivity. With this in 
mind, we fabricated the thin membrane based on a 5 µm 
thick polycarbonate film covered with the polycrystalline 
layer of piezo-resistive molecular metal β-(ET)2I3, the 
sensitive layer being prepared so as to be purely comparable 
with that of the above mentioned 25 µm thick BL film-based 
sensing membrane.  
Herein we show that an engendering approach based on 
the foregoing suggestion permitted us to fabricate a BL film-
based membrane with sensitivity to pressure being five times 
higher than that for the previous reported one [14, 18, 19]. 
We also present data on electromechanical properties of this 
membrane showing that the body temperature does not 
significantly influence on membrane pressure sensitivity: 
pressure tests were carried out at 26oC, 33oC and 40oC. 
 
II. 
FABRICATING POLYCARBONATE FILM COVERED WITH 
A HIGHLY PIEZORESISTIVE ORGANIC MOLECULAR METAL  
In line with the early reported method [12, 13] we first 
prepared a 5 μm thick polycarbonate film spiced up with an 
8 wt. % of ET that is a precursor for organic molecular metal 
(ET)2I3 . The film was cast on a glass support at 130 oC from 
a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of a 0.5 wt.% of PC and 0.04 
wt. % of ET. It should be noted that an 8 wt. % of ET 
embedded in this thin BL film is able to form the same 
amount of molecular metal (ET)2I3 as a 2 wt. % of ET 
inherent in a 25 µm thick BL film. Therefore, the prepared 
composite film made possible to form the conductive 
covering layer of (ET)2I3 with the thickness being identical to 
that of the covering (ET)2I3-based layer formed at the surface 
of the early developed 25 µm thick BL film [14, 18, 19].  
In order to cover the film with a conducting layer of 
(ET)2I3, we exposed the film surface to the vapors of a 
saturated solution of iodine in dichloromethane. The 
covering mechanism is as follows: the surface of a 
polycarbonate film easily swells under its exposure to 
dichloromethane vapors; this swelling facilitates a migration 
of ET molecules from the film bulk to the swollen film 
surface where the part of ET molecules are oxidized to 
radical cations ET+• by iodine, which penetrates in the film 
surface together with dichloromethane vapors. This redox 
process induces the rapid nucleation of highly insoluble 
[(ET)0(ET) +•](I3)- species and a piezoresitive facing layer of 
molecular metal α-(ET)2I3 is formed. Electrical resistance of 
the 25 µm thick BL film with the covering layer of α-(ET)2I3 
responded to strain with a gage factor being 10, whereas the 
polycarbonate film with the same thickness but surfaced with 
β-(ET)2I3 has a gage factor being 20 [15]. The difference in 
gage factors between α- and β-phases of (ET)2I3  can be 
attributable to a variety of the softness of their crystal 
structure: β-phase has one short C-H…C and three long C-
H…I  hydrogen bonds whereas α-polymorphous has two 
short C-H…C and only two long C-H…I bonds [9]. Thanks 
to a larger number of the long hydrogen bonds, the crystal 
structure of the β-phase is significantly softer than that of the 
α-one and, therefore, the conducting band of β-(ET)2I3 can 
be easily deformed under load.  
The 5 µm thick BL film covered with a highly 
piezoresistive layer of β-(ET)2I3 was formed  via a thermo-
activated α→β phase transition that occurs at T>100 oC [9, 
13]. For this purpose the BL film covered with the layer of 
α-(ET)2I3 was annealed at 150 oC during 30 min. The 
formation of the covering layer of β-(ET)2I3 was confirmed 
by its X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2). The figure shows 
only one line at 2θ=5.8o and its higher order reflections, that 
corresponds to “c”-oriented crystallites of organic metal β-
(ET)2I3 [9, 13].   
The surface analysis on a micro scale, performed using 
“Quanta FEI 200 FEG-ESEM” scanning electron microscope 
(SEM), showed that the crystallites of the covering layer of 
β-(ET)2I3 are of submicro size (Fig. 3). It should be noted 
that the sizes of the crystallites of the reported 25 μm thick 
BL film were of the same scale. The calculated possible

around 250 nm.

“Rotaflex” RU-200B diffractometer in reflection mode with 
monochromatic CuKα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å); the generator was 
activated at 50 kV and 80 mA.

The BL film-based sensing membrane of a round 
configuration was cut and equipped with two electrical 
contacts: two 20 µm thick Pt wires were attached to the 
piezoresistive layer of the membrane using a linear contact 
configuration (Fig. 4).

As a final remark we would like to add that the 
membrane temperature resistance coefficient (TRC) and 
membrane gage factor were found as 0.3 %/oC and 20, 
respectively. These values are in excellent agreement with 
the data reported for the 25 µm thick BL film [15]. The TRC 
was calculated as a relative resistance change per grade and 
gage factor was calculated as the ratio between the relative 
resistance change and the relative strain value.  
The above result demonstrates that both TRC and gage 
factor of polycarbonate films “self-metallized” with 
molecular metal β-(ET)2I3, being independent on the 
thickness of a polymeric matrix, are governed by the nature 
of the molecular metal used for covering a polycarbonate 
film. 
III. 
PRESSURE TESTS  
The pressure testing experiments were performed by 
using a tailor-made water based column manometer that is 
shown in Fig. 5. To prepare pressure tests under moderated 
temperature a demountable home made thermostat was 
designed and fabricated. This mini thermostat is made up of 
a rigid polyurethane foam-based camera whose interior walls 
were faced with Cu plates. The thermostat was equipped 
with two commercial Kapton Flexible Heaters (KHLV -
102/10) that were arranged on the opposite camera walls. 
The heaters were connected with DC Power Supply E3617A. 
Temperature was maintained constant with an accuracy of 
±0.02oC and controlled by the Pt-thermometer.

The pressure tests were curried out when thermostat 
temperature was stabilised at 26 ±0.02 oC, 33±0.02 oC and 
40±0.02oC. Tests were conducted with simultaneously

temperature monitoring; for this purpose the Pt-thermometer 
was located very close to the tested membrane. The 
membrane was pasted over a ring-like top of a glass holder 
as shown in Fig. 6. The holder was designed and tailor-made 
for connecting the BL film-based membrane with one of the 
tube of the tailor-made U-shaped tube manometer.  
In these experiments the pressure (P) of the gas that is 
trapped in the end of the tube closed with the tested 
membrane is greater than atmospheric pressure by the 
amount of pressure exerted by the column of water of height 
h. The bottom part of the manometer was equipped with a 
valve; the valve permits decreasing the water column height 
that in turn results in gas pressure decrease in the closed end 
of the tube. Pressure applied to a BL film-based membrane 
pasted over the holder can be easily measured as h mmH2O.

The electrical responses of the thin sensing membrane to 
pressure changes were measured with a multimeter Agilent 
34970A. The applied pressure was changes from 0 to 320 
mmH2O (0-32 mbar). The responses of the sensing 
membrane to applied pressure at 26 oC, 33 oC, and 40 oC are 
shown in Fig 7, 8 and 9, respectively. The pressure 
sensitivities (SP) of the membrane at different temperature 
were calculated from the R(P) dependences shown in the 
bottom of the figures and summarised in Table 1. 
Figs. 7, 8 and 9 demonstrate that in the studied pressure 
and temperature ranges the electrical resistance of the 
membrane linearly and reproducible response to pressure 
changes with a steep-slope, which has only a weak 
dependence on the body temperature.   
The data presented in Table 1 clearly show that the 
matrix thickness is a key parameter for engineering highly 
piezoresistive BL film-based membranes: a fivefold decrease 
in the thickness of a membrane plastic component on 
retention of the thickness of the piezoresistive layer resulted 
in a fivefold increasing of the membrane pressure sensitivity.

range.  Following the above pressure tests the membrane was 
studied anew by pressure loading at 26 oC (Fig. 10). 
According to data presented in Fig. 10, the sensitivity of the 
BL film-based membrane to pressure was found as 8,4 
Ω/mmHg that is  precisely the same as before it was found 
from the first loading experiment (Table 1). Therefore, the 
polycarbonate films covered with organic molecular metal β-
(ET)2I3 are highly piezoresistive materials with a good 
reproducible electrical response to pressure

SUMMARY 
The flexible pressure sensing membranes capable of 
measuring very small pressure changes have been developed. 
The pressure tests at different temperature showed that the 
body temperature does not significantly influence on the 
membrane pressure sensitivity.   
This study also demonstrated the feasibility of a fivefold 
increase of the sensitivity of BL film-based membranes to 
pressure changes that is a very important step on the road to 
the development of flexible weightless miniature pressure 
sensors.  
From the above it might be assumed that BL film-based 
sensors can be embedded in catheters, contact lenses and 
textiles for monitoring the body’s physiological processes 
and mechanical movements.
