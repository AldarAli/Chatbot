Abstract—This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and 
usability of using conventional devices, Wii and XaviX, in 
rehabilitation, and to propose advices to improve the digital 
game design. A clinical trial was implemented to evaluate the 
effectiveness and the usability of using Wii and XaviX in 
rehabilitation; they were assessed by stroke patients. Twenty-
eight stroke patients were divided in three groups: 
Conventional, Wii, and XaviX groups. The results can be 
summarized into the following points: (1) The effectiveness 
index in each group indicated improvements for upper 
extremity 
function 
in 
stroke 
patients. 
However, 
the 
effectiveness indexes of each assessment between three groups 
do not have significant differences. (2) All patients in this 
clinical trial had fun when using the digital gaming devices for 
rehabilitation. (3) The suggestions for improving the design in 
digital games are as follows: to increase difficulty, and the 
response time, levels of the games need adjustment; to record 
movement data and game scores each time, the hand controller 
must be interchangeable for the users; the controller should be 
adjustable to fit different hand dimensions of the patients; the 
game and controller movements need to be designed to 
correspond to real-life activities; and the controller's operation 
needs to be simplified. In order to make these devices more 
suitable to use in rehabilitation, a comprehensive follow-up 
design development based on these proposed guidelines would 
be necessary in order to embody design improvements of the 
devices.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Stroke is one type of the cerebrovascular disease 
threatening people in modern societies. Upper-extremity 
motor deficit is one of the main symptoms for the stroke 
patients [1]. Many daily living tasks are performed by the 
upper extremity; therefore, rehabilitation treatment of upper 
extremity is very important for stroke patients. In order to 
restore the movement function of patient’s upper extremity, 
patients must accept the rehabilitation activities. A 
rehabilitation device is an essential tool in the process of 
rehabilitation therapy. A study [2] has found that the current 
clinical upper extremity rehabilitation devices are mostly 
static and provide no feedback to the patients. Patients easily 
feel bored while repeating the same activity, hence 
generating a negative attitude toward the therapy process 
[3][4][5]. In order to increase mental satisfaction and 
physical vitality in rehabilitation therapy, some therapists 
have tried to use the off-the-shelf digital game devices in 
rehabilitation and have found effective treatment outcomes 
in in addition to enhancing the patient’s treatment motivation 
[4][6][7]. 
There are already many studies focused on digital game 
devices in rehabilitation such as Wii [4][5][7][8][10], 
Playstation EyeToy [6][9] and Kinect [5]. For example, a 
study examined the feasibility and safety of the Wii gaming 
system and compared it with recreational therapy in 
facilitating motor function of the upper extremity [8]. The 
results showed that Wii gaming technology represents a safe, 
feasible, and potentially effective way to facilitate 
rehabilitation therapy and promote motor recovery after 
stroke. However, some of Wii’s disadvantages were that 
stroke patients found the control of the handset buttons 
difficult and frustrating to use; however, this obligatory hand 
use improved gross motor dexterity. Stroke patients did not 
simply play Wii sports, rather the device was used as a 
rehabilitation tool with targeted and movement goals aimed 
at reinforcing appropriate and coordinated motor patterns [7]. 
The above-mentioned studies reveal that there are some 
usage problems to directly apply the off-the-shelf digital 
game devices in clinical rehabilitation. User-centered design 
emphasizes that designers observe the behaviors and usage 
situation of the actual user’s experience, that is, how users 
use a product and what problems and needs exist. About the 
medical 
and 
rehabilitation 
equipment, 
variables 
for 
evaluation may include effectiveness, ease of use, comfort, 
and acceptability [10]. Through design, these off-the-shelf 
digital game devices can be tailored for different stroke 
patients for their respective requirements in the rehabilitation 
therapy. It will make the devices more suitable for 
rehabilitation therapy, and enhance the use safety and 
effectiveness for stroke patients.  
These existing devices are originally designed for 
entertainment with normal people with healthy physical and 
action conditions, not intended for rehabilitation therapy

purposes or for people with physical disabilities [6]. Further 
confirmation and evaluation is necessary to see if a digital 
game device can really meet the user’s usability needs in 
addition to its rehabilitation effectiveness.  
Nintendo Wii and XaviX have been tested in clinical 
rehabilitation in several hospitals in Taiwan. However, 
whether the superiority of Virtual Reality systems can 
facilitate conventional therapy currently in use remains to be 
determined [3][11][12]. Further development is required to 
ensure that these devices are easy for patients and therapists 
to set up in a clinic [6]. A pilot trial was implemented to 
evaluate the effectiveness, usability and satisfaction between 
conventional devices, Wii, and XaviX in rehabilitation [13]. 
However, the result of effectiveness showed no statistically 
significant improvements between groups, due to the number 
of patients is limited. Therefore, this report aimed to increase 
larger number of patients to compare the effectiveness and 
usability of using conventional devices, Wii and XaviX in 
rehabilitation, and to propose advices on improve the digital 
game design.  
In the following sections, the methods applied and results 
obtained will be described respectively, and then the 
implication of the results will be discussed, followed by a 
brief conclusion. 
II. 
METHODS 
A clinical trial was implemented to evaluate the 
effectiveness between conventional devices, Wii, and XaviX 
in rehabilitation. In addition, the usability of using Wii and 
XaviX in rehabilitation were also assessed by stroke patients. 
The following two sections describe the research contents for 
these two kinds of subjects, respectively. 
A. Effectiveness evaluation 
Stroke patients were recruited from the occupational 
therapy department of Chung Shan Medical University 
Hospital. Inclusion criteria were the following: (a) 
Hemiparetic with upper extremity dysfunction following a 
single unilateral stroke, (b) a history of first-time stroke (3-
48 months post stroke), (c) the required upper extremity 
rehabilitation convalescent levels were Brunnstrom stage III 
to IV, i.e., having basic upper extremity synergies to perform 
joint movement voluntarily, (d) ability to communicate, (e) 
able to understand and follow instructions. Exclusion criteria 
were the following: (a) engaged in any other rehabilitation 
program during the study and (b) serious aphasia or 
cognitive impairment. Each patient gave informed consent. 
This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics 
Board of Chung Shan Medical University Hospital. 
A total of 28 post-stroke patients were admitted to the 
Occupational Therapy Department of Chung Shan Medical 
University Hospital. The mean age of the patients was 53.1 
years (SD 15.1), with a mean post-stroke time of 9.2 months 
(SD 7.5). The characteristics of the patients in the three study 
groups are shown in Table 2. As the data were not normally 
distributed, non-parametric tests were conducted. There were 
no statistically significant differences among the three 
groups with regard to age, time since stroke onset. Of the 4 
who did not finish, 1 was transferred out of the hospital, 1 
was discharged, and the other 2 failed to continue treatment. 
Twenty-four consecutively screened stroke patients finally 
completed the trial. 
Conventional equipment, Wii, and XaviX, were used in 
this trial (Table 1). Each group was assigned to use two 
games or equipment in the additional treatment. The games 
and equipment for the groups were selected by three 
occupational therapists, and were considered as similar in 
training effect on upper extremity movements. For Nintendo 
Wii, two games (boxing and bowling) of Wii Sport were 
selected to use in this trial. As for XaviX, two games 
(bowling and ladder climbing) were selected to use in this 
trial. Ladder climbing contains three levels (easy, normal and 
difficult). While playing bowling, the user needed to hold a 
soft bowling ball, fixed to the hand with a safety belt. In 
ladder climbing, the user needed to wear glove sensors in the 
palms of both hands [14]. Corresponding to the Wii games 
(Bowling and Boxing) and the XaviX games (Bowling and 
Ladder climbing), two conventional equipment (Curamotion 
exerciser and the Climbing board and bar) were selected in 
this trial. Both  are commonly used in rehabilitation. 
Four functional assessments were used as follows:  
a) Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical Performance (FMA) 
[15]. It was used to evaluate the motor functions. The upper 
extremity motor test part with a possible highest score of 66 
was adopted in the evaluation. The reliability of Fugl-Meyer 
Assessment is generally considered reliable [16]. 
b) Box and Block Test of Manual Dexterity (BBT). It was 
used to test gross manual dexterity of a patient’s affected 
side [17]. In the test, the patient was asked to move as many 
cubes (of side length of 2.5 cm) as possible using only the 
thumb and index fingers during a timed 60s trial. 
c) The Functional Independence Measure (FIM). This scale 
assesses physical and cognitive disability. The scale includes 
18 items, of which 13 items are physical domains based on 
the Barthel Index and 5 items are cognition items. Each item 
is scored from 1 to 7 based on level of independence, where 
1 represents total dependence and 7 indicates complete 
independence. This measurement was assessed and shown to 
have high reliability and validity [18][19][20]. 
d) Upper extremity range-of-motion (ROM). This is used to 
assess the passive and active range-of-motion on the affected 
side [21]. 
The training comprised 20 sessions during 2 months, 
with each session lasting 30 minutes (excluding set-up time). 
The effectiveness was evaluated before and after completing 
the 20 training sessions. In addition to these trainings (Wii, 
XaviX, and Conventional) in this study, all patients also 
received at least 1 hour of occupational therapy and 1 hour of 
physical therapy. After training, all patients asked to fill in a 
questionnaire. The content of the questionnaire is shown in 
the following section. 
B. Usability evaluation by the patients 
Three 5-point Likert type questions about satisfaction, 
motivation, and fun were then presented on a sheet of paper 
for the patients to answer. By this trial, we expected to 
understand the patients' satisfaction with using the digital 
gaming devices in clinics.

C. Usability evaluation by the occupational therapists 
The method of expert interview was conducted to survey 
the current situation of the use of digital game devices and 
evaluate the usability of such devices in upper extremity 
rehabilitation therapy. The locations, participants, contents of 
the interview and process are as follows. 
The selection criteria for the interview subjects were 
mainly based on hospital size, type (public vs. private), 
geographic location, and types of digital games used. Two 
hospitals were selected in a preliminary investigation: Taipei 
Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) and Kaohsiung Veterans 
General Hospital (KVGH). Wii was used in Kaohsiung 
Veterans General Hospital and XaviX was used in Taipei 
Veterans General Hospital. 
The occupational therapist plays a major role in the 
rehabilitation process to determine how the digital game 
device is used. As a professional, the occupational therapist 
possesses expertise about therapy theory and experiences, 
which are useful for the evaluation of rehabilitation devices 
or the commercial products applied in rehabilitation.  
Selection criteria for the interviewed therapists were: at 
least 5 years of work experience in occupation therapy, and 
at least one year experience in adopting the digital game 
device intervention in rehabilitation treatment. In total, eight 
therapists were selected and interviewed, three (one male [A] 
and two females [B, C]) from KVGH and five (two males [D, 
E] and three females [F, G, H]) from TVGH. They have an 
average age of 35.1 yrs (SD=6.3) and work experience of 
10.8 years (SD=6.3).

Semi-structured interviews were used, which mainly 
consisted of two parts: (1) Therapist personal profile - 
therapist gender, age, hospital name, and work experience in 
years, and (2) Questions about the usability evaluation of 
existing digital gaming device: The questions were: 
1. Effectiveness: How do you feel about the therapy 
effectiveness of the device in restoring the patient’s 
upper extremity functions?  
2. Ease of use: Do you have any usage problems in setting 
up the device to be used for therapy? What needs to be 
improved in the design of the devices? 
3. Acceptability: How do the patients respond to the use of 
digital game device in rehabilitation? Do they accept it 
and like it? 
D. Data analysis 
All data were analyzed with SPSS for Windows version 
13.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Intention-to-treat 
analysis (ITT) was used to analyze all data in each group 
[22]. The missing subjects who actually did the pre-test were 
included as subjects who had received treatment, and their 
pre-test scores were addressed so that they equaled their 
post-test scores; however, these scores indicated very little 
about the efficacy of the treatment. The characteristics of the 
study groups were described as mean and SD. The Wilcoxon 
signed rank test was the non-parametric alternative to the 
two-related samples tested for pre- and post-tests in each 
group, and the Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance 
by ranks test was used for differences in the effectiveness 
index between groups. Differences were considered 
significant when p<0.05. For each group, the effectiveness 
index of each functional assessment was calculated, i.e., the 
post-test score minus the pre-test score, and then divided by 
the maximum possible progress (possible highest score of 
the assessment minus pre-test score) [23]. To analyze the 
interview data from occupational therapists, the recording 
was firstly transcribed verbatim. Similar opinions were 
combined and all unique responses were independently 
itemized for further discussion. To analyze the questionnaire, 
data from stroke patients who completed treatment according 
to the devices used (conventional devices, the Wii device and 
the XaviX device). For each question on the questionnaire, 
the mean and standard deviation were calculated. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Within-group differences in score changes for each 
group 
Comparison of the pre- and post-test subjects in each 
group showed significant improvements for upper extremity 
function in stroke patients (Table 3). The XaviX group had 
significant differences on four assessments: the FMA 
(p=0.009), BBT (p=0.022), FIM (p=0.009), ROM-proximal 
(p<0.001), and ROM-distal (p<0.001). However, the 
conventional group and the Wii group had significant 
differences on three assessments: the FMA, FIM, and ROM. 
In addition, the results showed that the effectiveness index of 
each group indicated improvements for upper extremity 
function in stroke patients on the FMA, BBT, FIM, and 
ROM (Table 3). 
B. Between-group differences in score changes of 
effectiveness index 
The Krusal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance ranks 
showed no significant differences among the three groups for 
the FMA (p=0.349), BBT (p=0.950), FIM (p=0.644), ROM- 
proximal (p=0.186), and ROM-distal (p=0.114). On the other 
hand, comparing the effectiveness index of each assessment 
in three groups, we found that the effectiveness index of the 
Wii group on the FMA (mean=0.37, SD=0.21) indicated 
greater improvement than that of the XaviX group 
(mean=0.27, SD=0.33) and conventional group (mean=0.26,

SD=0.05). The mean score of the effectiveness index of the 
XaviX group was close to that of the conventional group.

C. Results of usability assessment by stroke patients 
Motivation. Did it promote your treatment motivation 
when you used the Wii, XaviX or conventional equipment 
for treatment? Patients of the Wii and XaviX groups agreed 
that digital games used in the treatment promoted their 
treatment motivation (Wii: mean=3.8, SD=1.0; XaviX: 
mean=3.8, SD=0.9; Conventional: mean=3.5, SD=0.5).  
Fun. Do you feel that using the Wii, XaviX or 
conventional equipment for treatment was more interesting 
than traditional rehabilitation devices? Patients of the Wii 
and XaviX groups agreed that these devices were more 
interesting than traditional rehabilitation devices (Wii: 
mean=4.3, 
SD=0.9; 
XaviX: 
mean=4.4, 
SD=0.5; 
Conventional: mean=2.3, SD=0.9). Seven of them specially 
mentioned that these devices provided useful information, 
such as the scores, audio and video feedbacks, as well as 
interesting interactions, making them feel positively toward 
doing the treatment activities. 
D. Results of usability assessment by occupational 
therapists 
Effectiveness: How do you feel about the therapy 
effectiveness of the devices in restoring the patient’s upper 
extremity functions? For effectiveness of Wii, all three 
therapists with experience in Wii (A, B, and C) agreed that 
the Wii Sport was effective in upper extremity rehabilitation, 
in addition to enhancing the patient’s treatment motivation. 
In addition, Therapist A suggested that Wii Fit was 
especially suitable for balance therapy for stroke patients. 
For effectiveness of XaviX, all five therapists with 
experience in XaviX (D, E, F, G, H) agreed that the device is 
effective in upper extremity rehabilitation, and could 
enhance the patient’s treatment motivation and pleasure. D 
also commented that some of the game projects with their 
controllers can effectively strengthen the training of reaching 
and grasping movements and achieve better therapy 
effectiveness as compared to the traditional devices. For 
instance, when the patient wears the gloves as controllers in 
the XaviX games, his/her hands are required to actually do 
the reach and grasp movements to complete the game task. 
In so doing, the training of the hands in those movements are 
apparent and practical. In addition, therapists E and F 
mentioned that the existing traditional devices are still 
important in rehabilitation and not possible to be fully 
replaced by digital gaming devices. The traditional devices 
do not require the patient to react in time and restrict his/her 
movement speed, hence the patient can repeat the movement 
as many times as he/she wishes and at a speed at his/her own 
control. Therefore, the digital game device can play a 
supporting role in rehabilitation treatment by providing 
diversification 
and 
interesting 
game 
projects 
for 
improvement of patient motivation toward the treatment. 
Ease of Use: Do you have any usage problems in setting 
up the devices to be used for therapy? What needs to be 
improved in the design of the devices? For the Wii, all three 
therapists (A, B, C) considered that the device is easy to set 
up, except some errors may occur when setting the game 
software items. The usage problems of this device are:  
• 
The current software interface is in Japanese and not 
easy to understand, hence is prone to cause errors in 
the set-up process;  
• 
The required response time of the game is too fast 
and not easy to keep up with by the patients;  
• 
Some patients may have difficulty to hold the hand 
controller, hence need additional bandage to tie it on 
the hand;  
374
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-325-4
ACHI 2014 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

• 
For some patients, the games are too difficult.  
For XaviX, all five therapists agreed that the hardware is 
easy to set up, except the software interface operation may 
cause occasional mistakes. The usage problems of this 
device are:  
• 
The current software interface is in Japanese and not 
easy to understand, hence is prone to cause errors in 
the set-up process, especially for the games of visual 
perception and memory 
training, which are 
impossible to operate without literacy of the 
Japanese language;  
• 
The sensor is not sensitive enough, e.g., the action 
may obstruct the reflective film and interrupt the 
detection by the sensor;  
• 
The controller gloves have only one single size, do 
not necessarily fit to all patients;  
• 
Although the games are available in three levels of 
difficulty, the differences between the difficulties are 
too abrupt and hard to meet the patient’s required 
degree of difficulty. 
Acceptability: How do the patients response to the use of 
digital game devices in rehabilitation? Do they accept it and 
like it? The result shows that all eight therapists agreed that 
most patients can accept the use of Wii or XaviX for 
treatment. Therapist B explained that people interested in the 
game have a very high degree of acceptance of such devices. 
However, some elderly patients tend to prefer using the 
traditional rehabilitation devices, because they feel that the 
traditional devices are some physical objects that can be held 
and manipulated, hence giving a feeling of the effect of 
treatment. On the contrary, digital game devices give an 
impression of laxness and frivolity, and hence are inefficient 
and ineffective. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This study conducted a clinical trial to examine the 
therapeutic effectiveness and usability of using conventional 
devices, Wii and XaviX on upper extremity functional 
recovery after stroke. We also used the intention-to-treat 
concept to analyze all data (except for motivation and 
enjoyment) in order to avoid overoptimistic estimates of the 
efficacy of an intervention resulting from the removal of 
non-compliers by accepting noncompliance and protocol 
deviations. The effectiveness index in each group indicated 
improvements for upper extremity function in stroke patients. 
However, the effectiveness indexes of each assessment 
between three groups are not significant differences. 
The results obtained from the interviews, it was found 
that the digital game devices currently used in clinical 
rehabilitation have been evaluated by professional therapists 
as useful and effective in supporting the treatment, though 
some design improvements may be necessary. In order to 
involve stroke patients in rehabilitation treatment as users of 
game devices for general players, factors concerning 
usability and safety in terms of interface with the stroke 
patients need to be further enhanced. Design guidelines 
concerning the improvement of existing digital game devices 
can be synthesized as follows, where items a to d are about 
software design, and items f to i about hardware: (a) To 
increase the response time of the games. (b) To increase 
difficulty levels of the games in order to better suit the 
various patients with different abilities of upper extremity 
functions. (c) To expand the sensor’s sensing scope. (d) To 
be able to record movement data, such as: reaction time, 
operating time. (e) To improve the ways to fix the controller 
on the user’s hand. (f) To fit the controllers size for different 
hand dimensions of the patients. (g) To provide better 
correspondence between the game and real-life movements. 
(h) To provide controllers for body control training, such as 
chest strap and belt. (i) To simplify the controller's operation. 
Two suggestions are proposed for future studies: (1) the 
therapists in the study had all chosen to use digital devices 
for intervention for at least a year, it may biased the results. 
It will be better if the views of those therapists who choose 
not to use digital games were also further surveyed. (2) In 
order to make these devices more suitable to use in 
rehabilitation, 
a 
comprehensive 
follow-up 
design 
development based on these proposed guidelines would be 
necessary in order to embody design improvements of the 
devices.
