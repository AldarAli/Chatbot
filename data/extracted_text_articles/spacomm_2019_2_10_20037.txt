Abstract—
As
the
probability
of
two-satellites
fault
simultaneously increase, the difficulty of fault identification in
the integrity monitoring become serious and the traditional
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) may not
be able to properly deal with this problem. This paper
investigates the impact of two-satellites fault at the same time
on integrity parameters. Two factors, two-satellites fault mode
and range deviation combination, are introduced to simulate
the condition of two satellites fault in BeiDou, and the change
of integrity parameters (Horizontal Positioning Error (HPE)
and Vertical Positioning Error (VPE)) is discussed. The
experiment
results
show
that:
under
two-satellites
fault
condition, with range deviation increase, HPE and VPE grow.
However, HPE/VPE show little change if the faulty satellite
mode contains MEO and the range deviation is less than 100
meters.

INTRODUCTION
RAIM is an important integrity monitoring technique for
detecting and identifying the satellite faults based on the
redundant observations information received by the user
receiver. It has the advantages of no other external
equipment, low cost, fast detection speed, and realization
convenience and so on. It is one of the integrity monitoring
algorithms which is widely used at present [1]-[3].
For the GNSS system, as more and more satellites are
lunched
for
positioning
and
navigation
purpose,
the
possibility of simultaneous two or more satellites fault
increases. As for GPS, in the six years between January 1994
and January 2000, there were 0.9 satellites fall in fault [4],
that is, the probability of simultaneous of single satellites,
two satellites and triple satellites are 1.0274×10-4/ hours、
1.0556×10-8/ hours、1.0845×10-12/ hours, respectively.
Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study RAIM
aiming at simultaneous multi-satellites fault. However, the
traditional RAIM method based on single satellite fault
hypothesis may not be suitable for multi-satellites fault
condition. This is because the position error caused by
simultaneous multi-satellite fault may fail to follow the
normal distribution, so that is the traditional RAIM is applied
under simultaneous multi-satellites fault condition, it may
reduce
the
performance
of
fault
detection
and
fault
identification [5][10].
In view of the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring
under
simultaneous
multiple-satellites
fault
situation,
scholars have explored many methods [6]-[10].
The above research works of RAIM for multi-satellites
fault are based on the improvement of fault detection and
fault identification aspect. For fault detection, the works
focus on the error model correction, threshold value
determination; for fault identification, they mainly include
the construction of test statistics and the search for filtering
methods.
Most
of
these
studies
are
based
on
GPS
observations.
With the development of BeiDou constellation, its
participation in global satellite navigation (GNSS) activities
is increasing, and enough attention should be given to the
problem of multiple-satellites fault in the constellation. Due
to the unique constellation structure, which includes satellites
of GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit), IGSO (Inclined Geo
Synchronous Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit), fewer
studies have been made on the influence of two or more
satellites
fault
on
the
receiver
autonomous
integrity
monitoring in BeiDou. Therefore, this paper focuses on
BeiDou constellation and discusses in depth the impact of
BeiDou two-satellites fault on integrity performance.
The content of the article is arranged as follows: Firstly,
two-satellites
fault
positioning
model
and
integrity
parameters are introduced; Secondly, the research plan is
proposed and the research method based on non-parametric
significance test, which includes Kruskal-Wallis test [12] and
multiple comparison, is described. Finally, an experiment is
designed to simulate the actual two-satellites fault situation.
The final section is a summary of the above analysis.

Data Description
The BeiDou II observed data were collected by a Novatel
receiver from May 1st, 2017 to May 10th, 2017，Xi'an.
BeiDou II system comprises of 14 satellites with GEO
satellite labeled from BD 01to BD 05, IGSO satellite labeled
from BD 06 to BD 10, MEO satellite labeled from BD 11 to
BD 14. The satellite visibility during the observation period
is shown in Figure 1. The statistical result of the visible time
for each satellite during the observational period shows that
BD01-
BD
05
was
basically
visible
throughout
the
observation day, while the visible time of BD06- BD 10 and
BD11-14 are 69% and 23% respectively.

Experiments Scheme
Assuming that the system fault is equivalent to some
additional
range
deviations
on
one or
more
receiver
observations,
therefore,
two
factors
are
introduced
to
simulate the situation of two-satellites fault: (1) two-satellites
fault mode [A B]. We selected 6 types of modes, as in Table
I, and expressed them by [A B], A is the first fault satellite,
and B is the second fault satellite; (2) range deviation
combination (a, b). As a satellite fault is considered as the
sum of range deviation and its corresponding observation
measurement, “a” is described as the range deviation on
satellite A and “b” is described as the range deviation on
satellite B. The range deviation is set increasing from 50 to
200m with 50m of interval. Table II shows the total of 16
sets of (a, b) combinations.

SIGNIFICANCE TEST
In order to investigate data feature of position and
integrity under two-satellites fault condition, the non-
parametric significance test is introduced and it includes two
tests, Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) test and multiple comparisons.
A.
K-W test
K-W test is one of the classic methods to infer the
significant difference among the test sequences and the
overall distribution by using sample data in the case of
unknown total variance or little knowledge.
There are two hypotheses for the K-W test. Null
hypothesis
H0
is the assumption that all sequences come
from the same population and the alternative hypothesis
1
H
is the assumption that all sequences come from a different
population. For k

is the quantity of ith test sequence. The total

. Then,
the data of the k test sequences are merged and sorted in
ascending order, and the rank of the variable values is
obtained. The k sequences of data are combined and sorted,
and the serial number values are given, and the serial number
values of the k sequences are respectively summed to obtain
j
R (j=1, 2, ..., k), and the test statistics H is established on
the basis of equation (8):

After obtaining the test statistics H , the P-value is
calculated. The P-value is a probability that the sequences
beyond a limitation level under the assumption that the zero
hypothesis is correct. It reflects the magnitude of the
possibility.
P-value is used to justify whether the hypothesis
0
H is
accept or reject by referencing a significant level of 0.05.
The significance level refers to the probability that the
difference between test sequences caused by sampling error
is less than 0.05.
B.
Multiple Comparisons
When there is a significant difference among the test
sequences based on K-W test, there is reason to consider that
all test sequences may not come from the same population.
However, this is not to say that there is a difference between
any pairs of test sequences. In order to further insight, the
difference between the test sequences, multiple comparison
is used. For a pair of test sequences
ANi
and
AN j
, its
corresponding confidence interval is constructed [24] in
equation (9):

The
confidence
interval
obtained
by
multiple
comparison is used to determine whether any two sets of test
sequences come from the same population. When the
confidence interval contained zero, it indicated that two test
sequences may come from the same population. When the
estimated interval did not contain zero, it indicated that two
test sequences may not come from the same population.

EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
The non-parametric significance test is used to discuss
the connection between HPE or VPE and the addition of
various range deviation combinations under the same two-
satellites fault mode.
Under a certain two-satellites fault mode, the HPE and
VPE sequences from the original observations are labeled as
0)
a
HPE（ b
and
0)
a
VPE（ b
. HPE and VPE sequences from
addition of range deviation on the observations are labeled as

In the three-dimensional graphics of Figure 2, the X axis
represents 6 types of two-satellites fault modes. Y axis
represents the 16 sets of range deviation combinations, and
the Z axis represents the P-value obtained by the K-W test
with a significant level of 0.05. It shows P-values from all
tests are significantly less than 0.05. Therefore, there is a
significant
difference
among
HPE
sequences
with
introduction of range deviations. That is to say, under two-
satellites fault mode, there are one or more sequences which
show significant difference with the addition of range
deviations, but we fail to know how many HPE sequences
are different. The following multiple comparisons are used to
identify the HPE sequences with significant difference.
The analysis on VPE is proceeding in the same way.

Figure 4. VPE Confidence interval of multiple comparisons before and after introducing range deviation combination.
As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4：
1)
Under three types of two-satellites fault mode,
[BD01, BD04], [BD01 BD07] and [BD07 BD09]
HPEs show significant difference with addition of
range deviation.
2)
There is little difference of HPE among [BD01
BD12], [BD07 BD12] and [BD12 BD14]. It is
worthy to know that these three types of modes
include MEO satellite, such as BD12 OR BD 14.

Furthermore, Table IV shows that when the range
deviation combination is (50, 50) m, there is hardly any
difference among the HPE comparison groups. Specifically,
in [BD01 BD12], after the addition of 200m of range
deviation on BD01, there is little difference of HPEs against
the condition that no additional range deviation. The
difference becomes significant when 100m addition of range
deviation for BD12.
As for [BD07 BD12], as long as the range deviation is
less than 100 meters, there is hardly any difference between
the test sequences.
In [BD12 BD14], although both BD12 and BD14 are
MEO
satellites,
it
shows
that
the
range
deviation
combination does not affect them in the same way. That is,
when the range deviation combination is (50 100)m, HPE
sequences
shows
a
significant
difference
while
HPE
sequences have little difference when the range deviation
(100 50)m is introduced.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
With the development of the Beidou system, the
probability of simultaneous failures of two satellites or
multiple satellites increases. Based on two-satellites fault
condition, this paper discusses the impact of two satellites
faults on the integrity parameters HPE/VPE. The result
shows that: under two-satellites fault, the range deviation
growth leads to the increase of HPE or VPE. However, if the
satellite fault mode contains MEO and the range deviation is
less than 100m, the effect on HPE/VPE is not significant.
