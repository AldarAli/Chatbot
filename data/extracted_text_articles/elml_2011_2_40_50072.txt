Abstract — This paper demonstrates the results of our research 
activities, which investigated the positive and negative aspects 
of an e-learning system called Moodle. The research involved 
235 students, providing us with unstructured answers about 
their opinions on what features are most important when using 
an e-learning system. The research focused on what students 
felt was missing and what they thought were the most 
important and beneficial features for an e-learning system used 
for on-line learning. Based on their answers, we conducted a 
qualitative analysis and identified the main factors that 
influenced the acceptance of e-learning systems. Based on the 
results of the qualitative analysis, we have proposed a 
theoretical acceptance model that could be used to measure the 
acceptance and use of an e-learning system. 
Keywords- e-learning system; Moodle; acceptance 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The basic goal of our qualitative research, conducted at 
the University of Maribor‟s Faculty of Electrical Engineering 
and Computer Science in Slovenia, was to identify the main 
factors that influence a user‟s decision, to use a certain e-
service -- in our case, a specific e-learning service called 
Moodle. By analyzing the quality of the data, we wanted to 
provide an answer to the question: what are the factors that 
significantly influence the acceptance and use of an e-
learning system and how do we measure them? The research 
was done step by step, as defined by the quality process 
execution of empirical research.  
Perceived usefulness is the most important factor that 
predicts the acceptance and use of e-learning system. This 
causal relationship was confirmed by Yi and Hwang [1], 
Ong et al. [2], Liaw et al. [3], Zhang et al. [4], Ngai et al. 
[5], Lee [6], Vanraaij and Shepers [7]. However, Brown [8] 
showed that in the developing country, the perceived 
usefulness is not the main predictor of usage of an e-
learning system. In his research, the perceived ease of use 
was found to be the most important factor. E-learning 
system acceptance studies found in the literature are usually 
based on existing acceptance theories and models, where 
researchers try to confirm causal relationships proposed by 
the theoretical model on which the study is grounded. The 
main objective of this study was to find additional factors, 
which are not included in existing acceptance theories that 
may have significant influence on user‟s perceptions when 
using an e-learning system. 
This paper is presented in the following manner. The 
second section presents the facts about the research: the 
planning, data collection and data analysis, and how we 
created data codes from the results. The third section 
presents the implementation and results of the qualitative 
analysis method and the fourth section discusses the results. 
The fifth section describes the limitations we had to take into 
consideration. The sixth section concludes the main 
knowledge gained over the course of our research. 
II. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
This research was focused on the factors that influence 
the user‟s decision to use a specific e-service in the future. 
We chose a qualitative research approach to gain data. Based 
on this, we developed a theoretical model composed of the 
most important factors that influence the user‟s decision. We 
did this because we wanted to gain as much information as 
possible, and not restrict our research to only our ideas, as 
would have been the case if we conducted a structured 
question survey type of research. In our research, we defined 
a specific area of e-services that we would research in more 
detail, the e-learning system Moodle, a rather popular open 
source e-learning system that was also used at the Faculty of 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Maribor. 
A. Research Questions 
The main objectives of this research were 1) to identify 
the factors that influence the acceptance of an e-learning 
system, and 2) to compare the identified factors with the 
factors of existing empirically tested acceptance models 
together with factors from existing quality models. 
Since the research focused on a specific system, the 
targeted participants in the research were all users of the 
Moodle system. Therefore, the ideal population in our case is 
represented by all users of Moodle. Because Moodle is an 
open source system, it is very difficult to determine the 
number of users currently using the system. Each month the 
number of registered users increases by approximately 1,300. 
Based on a statistical report from September 2010 [9], there 
were 49,481 registered and approved Web Moodle 
installations in 211 different countries. At the time of this 
paper, the number of registered users reached nearly 37 
million.

The method, chosen as appropriate for collecting 
qualitative data, was an online survey with open unstructured 
questions. An online survey was chosen so that the 
respondents were not limited by time while participating. 
The study participants were entirely free to decide on their 
level of participation. To compare the factors affecting the 
use of Moodle we asked the following research questions: 1) 
What features and/or characteristics are most important for 
the use of the online course management system, Moodle, 
and 2) What features and/or characteristics are missing when 
using the online course management system Moodle? 
B. Data Collection 
The answers to previously defined questions were 
provided by the users of different Moodle systems that had 
been installed in Slovenia. The invitation to participate in an 
online survey was sent to every student that had registered 
for Moodle at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and 
Computer Science in Maribor at the time of the survey. We 
also sent a request for participation to a number of contact 
addresses at various higher education and other education 
institutions in Slovenia. 
III. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
In answer to the first question (“what is most important”) 
we received 232 replies. For the second question (“what is 
missing”) we received 227 responses. In the following 
sections we will present the method behind the qualitative 
data analysis and the results of the analysis. 
A. Analysis method 
The answers given by the respondent‟s online survey 
were provided in a qualitative form. The qualitative data was 
not numerical; therefore it was necessary to choose a method 
for qualitative analysis, whose basic purpose is to work with 
raw qualitative data and formulate it into new concepts or 
improve already existing concepts.  
To define the concepts from qualitative raw data we 
performed coding, which is one of the most common 
techniques for qualitative analysis. While coding qualitative 
data, the raw data was arranged into conceptual categories 
and, in this way, new topics or concepts were created. The 
coding was carried out in order to reduce the amount of data 
and to effectively manage information units. The process of 
coding, which was managed based on the two research 
questions, consisted of two concurrent activities: data 
reduction and the analytical categorization of data. The 
general coding technique was then supplemented by a 
method of successive approximation, whose aim was the 
improvement of theories or concepts that were acquired in 
the 
coding 
method. 
The 
basis 
of 
the 
successive 
approximation method was represented by basic theoretical 
models and concepts, as defined in the coding method. 
B. Results of Data Coding 
For the purpose of qualitative data analysis, we used a 
test version of a tool called QDA Miner [10]. QDA Miner is 
a tool devoted to analyzing qualitative data that provides 
features for: 1) text management with support for various file 
formats such as Excel, Word, SPSS, etc., 2) text retrieval 
tools for searching for specific simple and complex text 
patterns in documents, 3) text coding tools for creation and 
edition of hierarchical codebooks, code merging, splitting, 
etc., and 4) qualitative analysis tools for obtaining a list of all 
codes along with different statistics such as their frequency, 
the number of cases in which they are found, etc.  
Table 1 summarizes the list of codes that were identified 
in the process of coding during the qualitative analysis of 
answers to the first question (“what are the most important 
features”). The list of codes is arranged in descending order 
of frequency codes. For each code, we also determined the 
percentage of code opposed to the full list of codes. The most 
frequently identified code was the accessibility of the 
material as well as the availability of the learning material.

Table 2 summarizes the list of codes that were identified 
in the process of coding during the qualitative analysis of 
responses to the second question (“what features are 
missing”). The list of codes is arranged in the descending 
order of frequency codes. For each code, we also determined 
the percentage of codes depending on the full list of codes. 
From the list of codes, it is evident that individual codes 
were identified several times. The code "Satisfaction" had 
the highest frequency. 
Figure 2 presents code shares, depending on their 
frequency. The chart shows that 31% of codes appeared 
more than five times, while 25% of codes appeared only 
once.

IV. 
IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS OF A SUCCESSIVE 
APROXIMATION 
Entrance to the process of successive approximation was 
presented by a list of identified codes and an initial list of 
concepts. This was formulated on the basis of characteristics 
and sub-characteristics ISO/IEC 9126-1 [11], factors in the 
design of e-service quality (SERVQUAL [12], Dromey [13], 
McCall [14]) and concepts in technology acceptance models 
(TAM [15], UTAUT [16], TTF [17]). We tried to sort each 
code to a list of initial concepts based on the following 
semantic relationships (R): 
 
The code is equal to, or synonymous with, the concept, 
or 
 
The code is a hyponym of the concept. 
If the code could not be inserted into the list of concepts, 
a new concept was defined; namely the term hypernym, 
which was then added to the list of concepts. 
Table 3 shows the final list of concepts, arranged based 
on the relevance of each concept, which were discovered in 
the set of all concepts in the encoding phase. From the list, it 
is evident that Moodle users found „Usability‟ to be the most 
important aspect of e-learning. This result is consistent with 
the results given by a previous meta-analysis of data 
identified in the systematic review of existing literature. 
Following this, the most important concepts that affect the 
use of e-learning are: the quality of the user interface, the 
quality of the learning content, satisfaction, the quality of e-
service, 
facilitating 
conditions, 
availability, 
uniform 
appearance and use of the system in various subjects; 
security, ease of use and stability.

DISCUSSION 
The objective of implementing web survey was to answer 
the questions that were presented in this paper. The study 
was limited to a specific e-learning system. The study 
involved 534 users, who used Moodle for educational 
purposes at various institutions. Based on the 232 responses 
to 
the 
question 
RQ1 
"What 
functionality 
and/or 
characteristics are most important for the use of Moodle," we 
identified 459 codes, of which the most common was 
perceived usability of the system.  
Based on the 227 responses to the question RQ2 "What 
Functionality and/or features do you miss when using 
Moodle," we identified 279 codes, in which the most 
common concept proved to be satisfaction. Students find that 
an e-learning system should provide a modern and unified 
user interface for all on-line courses. E-learning system must 
also provide mechanisms for communication with the 
professor/teacher and other students.  
We performed a successive approximation, and a 
common qualitative data analysis, over a set of codes that we 
acquired in the encoding data phase. Using the illustrative 
method, we tried to connect the identified codes with 
concepts from existing theories. The basis for the method of 
successive approximation were the relations "is synonymous 
with" and "is a hypernym term". Finally, we performed an 
illustrative method.  
As the final result of the qualitative analysis, 25 concepts 
were identified. Among them, the following concepts/factors 
have proven to be most relevant and we have included them 
in the theoretical (causal) model, which is illustrated in 
Figure 3. We applied the model in the UTAUT model, where 
we changed the variables from a TAM model with similar 
variables as a UTAUT model, namely: 
 
Perceived Usability (TAM)  Performance Expectancy 
(UTAUT) and 
 
Perceived Ease of Use (TAM)  Effort Expectancy 
(UTAUT)

VI. 
LIMITATIONS 
When interpreting the results we had to take into 
consideration the following restrictions: 
 
Restrictions on the methods of research – the surveys 
were conducted through an online survey system, where 
each respondent expressed their opinion in one answer. 
The online poll did not allow the development of 
discussions, so the answers reflect the respondent‟s 
current feelings. Still, the survey contained two clearly 
defined and focused questions, which contributed to the 
relatively large number of responses and answers. 
 
Limitations of the study frame - the sampling frame of 
our study was purpose oriented and undetermined. Users 
responded to the survey based on their own motivations. 
For this reason, the results are difficult to generalize for 
the population of all Moodle users. The results do, 
however, give a general picture, since the sample was 
relatively large and contained a large variety of 
respondents 
coming 
from 
various 
educational 
institutions. In this study, only learners participated. In 
order to get the whole picture, the opinion of the 
instructors should also be included. Users that 
participated in this study, come from different 
institutions 
that 
may 
have 
different 
Moodle 
implementations.   
 
Restrictions on analytical techniques - an analysis of 
qualitative data was conducted in a systematic way, 
where we tried to nullify subjective influences. In the 
process of data coding, we identified codes directly from 
the qualitative data. The results of the qualitative data 
were 
obtained 
analytically 
by 
using 
semantic 
relationships between codes and concepts. 
 
Research repeatability - it is likely that in the event of 
performing a re-analysis by using other concepts from 
existing models of quality and acceptance, we would 
receive a final list of concepts, where individual 
concepts and their structure would be significantly 
different. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented quality research, identifying 
the factors that influence e-learning system acceptance. We 
conducted a survey, asking respondents two main questions: 
what features are important in an e-learning system and what 
do they miss in the e-learning system that they currently use. 
With their answers, we defined the main factors. In the case 
of importance, learning material availability was considered 
the most important factor that respondents expressed. In the 
case of missing features, “satisfaction with the system” was 
the main issue. E-learning system developers and 
professors/teachers/instructors should therefore search for 
features that could improve user‟s degree of satisfaction 
when using an e-learning system for learning purposes. 
There are many factors that may have influence on user‟s 
overall satisfaction with the system. E-learning system 
developers must consider how to integrate the e-learning 
environment with new services and technologies. New 
technologies with social openness will lead into a social 
revolution, where learners will actively participate in the 
learning content creation and learning process. E-learning 
system developers should therefore consider about how to 
integrate e-learning system with Web 2.0 technologies and 
services (Wiki, blogging systems, RSS, Twitter, Youtube, 
Flickr, Slideshare, Facebook, etc.).  
 The factors that we identified with a qualitative analysis 
were used to develop a theoretical model of Moodle system 
acceptance. In the developed acceptance model, the quality 
of the user interface and learning materials, functionality, 
availability, security, facilitating conditions and stability 
showed an influence on the learner‟s performance 
expectancy and effort expectancy, which are both predictors 
of a user's behavioral intentions in using a specific e-learning 
system. In our future research work we will conduct a 
quantitative study in which we will evaluate the research 
model and try to confirm/reject the proposed causal 
relationships.
