Abstract—Analysis of real telecommunication data can 
provide a fine grasp and good understanding of user 
behavior dynamics and can be used to improve network 
management strategies.  Following this approach, we analyze 
actual wireless traffic and provide basis for a suitable 
network model with a given network traffic profile.  Unlike 
previous approaches, we introduce criteria for intelligent 
network resources utilization and define metrics to discover 
optimization potential of wireless system architectures. Our 
traffic fluctuation analysis is of interest for traffic load 
prediction and can boost BS switching time strategies. Thus, 
this study provides hints into hardware realization of a 
future base station and basis for development of efficient 
network architectures.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In the existing literature, traffic observation and 
resource utilization in real networks were analyzed in 
different context. Investigation how efficiently radio 
resources 
are 
used 
by 
different 
subscribers 
and 
applications in macro Base Stations (BS) were done by 
Paul et al. [1]. The observations are related to traffic 
spread, mobility and efficiency in connection to 
subscriber pricing, protocol design, spectrum allocation 
and energy savings. Gender-based traffic characterizations 
based on campus traffic data were done by Kumar and 
Helmy [2].  Much research has been devoted to traffic 
classification models and methods in context of network 
security and management. In this context, the analysis 
concerned different kind of traffic generated by single 
application flow and the real-time traffic data were used 
for verification of proposed methods by Khalife et al. and 
by Won et al. [3][4].   
In this paper, we agree with Jiang et al. [7] and are 
convinced that only the analysis of real traffic 
measurements give a deeper understanding into the 
network and thus provides a basis for a suitable network 
model with a given network traffic profile.  Unlike the 
mentioned approaches, we introduce criteria for intelligent 
network resources utilization and define metrics to 
discover optimization potential of wireless system 
architectures. 
A. Contributions  
Focusing on actual network data, we:   
• 
Introduce criteria of BSs capacity utilization in a 
capital city centre, so called Dense Urban 
Centre (DUC) and in an extended circle of the 
capital city centre, so called Greater Dense 
Urban (GDU) area. 
• 
 Define a metric to assess optimization potential 
for energy saving in the specific areas. 
• 
Define BS categories with regard to their traffic 
profiles.  
• 
Provide details of traffic fluctuation.  
• 
Contribute to better understanding of resource 
sharing. 
The results of this study give hints for hardware (HW) 
realization 
of 
future 
BS, 
contribute 
to 
resource 
optimization of the BS and provide basis for development 
of future efficient network architectures and adequate 
methods for resource management. 
B. Analysed data 
Data at our disposal have been provided by a single 
European operator in an European city. The analyzed 
traffic data cover BS of different power and capacity for 
dense urban centre und greater dense urban areas.  The 
traffic data has been sampled for down- (High Speed 
Downlink Packet Access) and for uplink (High Speed 
Uplink Packet Access) in 900 sec (15 min.) intervals over 
a period of a week.  
Given intervals of 15 min. make traffic fluctuation of 
shorter time invisible. Due to the fact that our analysis is 
oriented toward system utilization, this represents no real 
disadvantage and does not reduce the quality of the data. 
Furthermore, short fluctuations are typically resolved with 
the help of store and forward technology and are not 
relevant for analyzed mechanisms.   
 The analyzed system covers about 400 pico, micro 
and macro UMTS-cells in dense urban area, as well as 
over 900 pico, micro and macro UMTS-cells in greater 
dense urban area. In the analyzed area, macro-cells were 
deployed with high mounted antenna at ca. 24 – 44 m and 
with 15 – 20 W transmission power. Micro-cells were 
deployed with ca. 0.85W and with low mounted antennas 
at ca. 5 - 6 m. In addition, some pico-cells were deployed.

Diagrams of F(t) for DUC and GDU areas show sinusoid 
like shape and periodicity over a week (see Figure 1 and 
Figure 2). The fluctuation dynamic is within the range of 
about 13 dB. In the case of a DUC area, highest traffic 
load appears between 10:00 a.m. to 05:00 p.m., while in 
the GDU area the high traffic is by about 02:00 p.m. and 
decreases up to 10:00 p.m.

Also, there is a difference on weekends between traffic 
density in the DUC and GDU areas. The hypothesis can 
be made that this difference results from population 
movement. Where the population in the GDU is 
dominated by inhabitants and therefore steady, the DUC 
has more office buildings and therefore its population 
drops on evenings and on weekends.  
III. 
LOCAL TRAFFIC PROFILE 
In some cases, an aggregated traffic profile is used  by 
Gonzales et al. and Ambrosy et al. [5][6], but the load 
profiles of individual cells turn out to behave very 
differently from  shown global profiles, as presented in 
the Figure 3.

Figure 3. Traffic examples of cells in different areas.  
 
Cell load profiles are different, even in cells of the same 
BS. They are extremely volatile and aperiodic. Depending 
on the BS location and served cell, load profiles can have 
very different utilization.  Also, they can show some 
periodicity or be unpredictable. Summing up, elaboration 
and assessment of optimization measures for cells must be 
based on well understanding of a cell behavior and its 
traffic profile.  
The 
considerable 
load 
dynamic 
justifies 
an 
optimization effort of BSs in analyzed areas. Some 
optimization examples can be: switching connections or 
hardware modules off, changing the transmission scheme, 
adapting the transmission speed of the backbone by 
slowing 
down 
clock 
frequency, 
selling 
released 
transmission resources to third party, while tuning off 
reserved resources can be controlled by actual time and 
date. The algorithms can be reinforced by self-learning 
procedures, to facilitate correct system reaction in case of 
nonstandard events and events not covered by a core 
algorithm. 
IV. 
CELL LOAD 
A general look at the traffic profiles of individual cells 
lets expect low cell utilizations because there are a few 
traffic peaks and the traffic load is low (see Figure 3). The 
Cumulated Density Function (CDF) calculated for all cells 
in DUC over the analyzed time period confirms this 
thought. Figure 4 shows high probability for low traffic in 
all analyzed DUC cells.

support decisions on design, deployment and operation of 
single BS, as well as of a whole wireless network.      
V. 
UTILIZATION OF BS CAPACITY  
First, we define what the BS capacity and the BS 
utilization is. The BS capacity is defined as the max. data 
traffic the BS can handle at once, which is, based on data 
we have, the highest absolute data rate of a particular BS in 
a week. Therefore, if we speak of 100% of BS capacity, it 
means its highest data rate in the measured time period. 
Furthermore, the resource utilization is the throughput the 
BS processes at a given time.   For example, following the 
green solid line in Figure 5, about 90% of analyzed BSs 
(on the Y axis) in the GDU  area  have 90% traffic load by 
only up to 25% of its capacity (X axis). Similar, according 
to the violet solid line 90% of BSs in the GDU and 
according to the violet dotted line 60% of BSs in the DUC 
area are utilized by less than 20% for 85% measured traffic 
load. Finally, it can be recognized that the processed traffic 
of BSs in both regions does not exceed 50% of their 
capacity.

Figure 5. BSs utilization in DUC and GDU areas. 
According Figure 5, it could be assert that the overall 
utilization of BS in the GDU is about 25% lower as those 
in the DUC area, and in both areas there is a big potential 
for improvements of the utilization factor. 
A. Load distribution 
Even though the load distribution in the time scale of a 
whole system is predictable, and has a shape with 24 h 
oscillation period influenced by a day of week as shown 
in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the load shapes of individual 
BSs are different and seem not to be bound to a periodic 
event. Figure 6 shows 5 different shapes for various cells 
in the GDU area between 07:00 a.m. and 06:00 p.m. on 
one day. We can see no similarity between them.

The CDF function of the traffic variance for all BSs in 
DUC area shows that more than 90% of evaluated BS 
population has a variance less than a half of the calculated 
variance max value (see Figure 7). It lets us assume that 
the spreading of values, i.e., the most oscillation of a load 
shape is low to middle. This in turn has an impact on BS 
construction and deployment planning.

The above confirms also the Figure 8. It shows the view on 
the traffic load of a number of cells in the DUC area, 
where areas with low traffic at night and differences in the 
traffic of particular cells can be well recognized. Very 
interesting is also to see, that the traffic of a single cell is 
not steady but shaped by a short rising peaks which seems 
to be independent one from another.

It can be seen that the R values are low, so there is no 
significant correlation of BSs traffic in the region. 
However, the high peaks show that there is some 
correlation between BSs traffic in the neighborhood. 
B. Metric to assess the potential for energy saving 
Observed low BSs utilization and low correlation value 
of their traffic profiles let expect reasonable saving 
potential for energy and for HW costs. Therefore, some 
calculations have been made to identify the energy saving 
potential more exactly. For this reason, a metric was 
defined which express an Energy Saving Potential Index 
(ESPI) based on a histogram of load values between 0% - 
100% load with 5% steps (bins). 
The value of the ESPI is zero if there is no potential for 
energy saving and one if the energy saving potential is 
high.                                                                            
                                                                                    (3)                  
 
Here, n is the number of measures for a given load bin, α is 
the load fraction, e.g., 0% - 100%, and i the number of 
defined load bins.  
Applying the ESPI metric to the DUC area and by 
consideration of 20 bins, each every 5% traffic load (see 
Figure 10) it can be identified, that the lowest ESPI value 
is 0.70. In total, 92% cells have saving potential between 
0.81 – 0.95 and 60% cells had saving potential between 
0.90 – 0.95.

For the GDU area, most cells have saving potential index 
between 0.76 – 0.95 whereby 71% cells have saving 
potential over 0.9. 
VI. 
BASE STATION  CATEGORIES WITH REGARD TO 
THEIR TRAFFIC PROFILES 
It was expected that the best way to save energy is to 
design a base station optimized to its traffic profile and 
further to adopt the network architecture to recognized 
traffic categories. Therefore, we analyzed the individual 
BS traffic to categorize traffic profiles of individual cells.  
As shown later in this section recognized categories of 
traffic profiles have corresponding energy saving 
potential. The BSs were analyzed regarding their traffic 
load during working days, emerged peaks, traffic load on 
the weekend and ESPI. At last, the studied traffic profiles 
were categorized into three generic traffic profiles in the 
DUC and two generic traffic profiles in the GDU area 
what is presented in Table I. 
In the analysis, it was assumed that the highest 
throughput peak in the observed time embodies the 
maximum load or maximum resource utilization of the 
given BS, whereby that maximum resource utilization is 
typically in the range of 60% for macro BSs in dense 
urban areas as found in EARTH [10].

VII. 
FLUX  
The analysis of traffic profile requires understanding 
of its basic structural elements. These elements can be 
described by means of the term flux that corresponds to 
envelope of the traffic function with different levels of 
aggregation. The envelope of traffic function, i.e., a single

flux, is calculated as a linear approximation of 
consecutive growing and falling traffic profile sections 
with symmetry defined by constant ρ . 
In the calculations, the ρ value was set to the level at 
which the fluctuation integrated down to the general shape 
can be simply compensated by hardware measures and 
would not influence traffic control algorithms.

Figure 12. Traffic example and Fluxes. 
 
The following flux parameters were calculated: flux 
duration, flux delta, i.e., the difference between the lowest 
and highest value of the flux, and slew rate. 
The CDF functions for calculated parameters for the GDU 
area are shown in Figures 14, 15 and 16. Please note that 
traffic data has been sampled with 900 sec intervals. The 
results of flux duration calculation (see Figure 13) shows 
that traffic changes are relatively slow. About 50% of 
analyzed fluxes last up to 1 hour and 90% last up to 2, 5 
hours.

Figure 14 shows that the amplitude of 50% fluxes is up 
to 5% of max. load and 90% fluxes have the amplitude 
lower than 28% of max. load. It means that fluctuations 
with high amplitude are relatively seldom.

The slew rate of low dynamics fluxes (with delta up to  
50 % of max load) has the value of 0.5‰ of their peak 
value per second. This means that the slew time of the 
fluxes lasts about 30 minutes. 
The 90% high dynamic fluxes (with delta higher than 
50 % of the max load) have the slew rate of rising and 
falling edge by about 0.65‰ per second of the peak value.

thresholds, safety margins for changes of system state and 
for short time traffic prediction. 
The above results show that network optimization 
measures by hardware, as well as by software are feasible.

VIII. POSSIBLE SOLUTION ON BS ARCHITECTURE BASED 
ON THIS SURWEY 
The above analysis of load distribution and traffic 
profile characteristics provides basics for architecture of 
scalable BS hardware as proposed by Wajda [8]. The 
analysis shown that there are a number of traffic load 
ranges it can be optimally performed by specialized 
hardware modules with working characteristics adapted to 
supported traffic range. For example, assume BS 
consisting of two modules, where the first one supports the 
range up to 10% of max. traffic load and consumes 1 kW 
per hour  and the second module supports the traffic peaks 
up to max. load and consumes 10 kW per hour. If the 
second module, due to the traffic load characteristics, can 
be switched off during 80% of the BS working time than 
the energy consumption can be greatly reduced. To assess 
energy 
savings 
we 
estimated 
traffic 
ranges 
and 
corresponding processing modules as shown in Table  II 
and in Table III.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Against well predictable global traffic profiles for DUC 
und GDU, traffic profiles of single cells are extremely 
volatile and not predictable. Therefore, optimization 
measures addressed to single cell must be well balanced 
and done separately from system wide optimization 
algorithms.   
Traffic analysis of individual cells in DUC area had 
shown low utilization of cell resources and mostly low to 
middle oscillation of a load shape. 
 The developed metric, the Energy Saving Potential 
Index, confirmed the low utilization and, in consequence, 
a huge energy saving potential (over 0.9). Due to the 
estimated saving potential, it is worth to exploit low 
traffic utilization by BS architectural design. 
Sophisticated network management strategies, for 
example those concerning resource sharing can benefit 
from this research, for example, common traffic 
management can help to reduce traffic dynamic of 
particular BS and increase its resource utilization. 
Furthermore, the defined BSs categories provide basis 
for a suitable network model with a given network traffic 
profile and can be used for development of energy 
effective HW by means of configurable set of procedural 
and physical building blocks that can be assembled 
manually, as well as in an automated way.  
Flux details will help to boost BS switching time 
strategies and provide hints for hardware realization, as 
well as improve quality of traffic load prediction.  
In the next research work, based on above findings, 
different modular HW solutions, transceivers based on 
power amplifiers with optimized dynamics, and new 
network management strategies will be proposed.
