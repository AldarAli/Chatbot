Multiplexed Continuous Phase Modulation (FDM-CPM) 
systems with Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) 
transmission is investigated. The system is designed to achieve 
high spectral efficiency by exploiting the multiplexing gain of 
MIMO techniques. Moreover, a FDM MultiUser (MU) scheme 
with tight inter-carrier frequency spacing is used to increase 
spectral efficiency. It is shown that, using this scheme, 
significant improvement both in terms of bit error rate and 
spectral efficiency are obtained when compared to the single-
antenna MU scenario. To take advantage of the multiplexing 
gain of MIMO systems, a Minimum Mean Square Error 
(MMSE) MIMO detector and a low-complexity iterative 
algorithm for Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) cancellation are 
considered. Numerical simulations have been performed to 
assess the performance improvement achieved with the 
proposed frequency-division multiplexed CPM multiuser 
MIMO system.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In the past few years, several methods have been 
proposed for MultiUser (MU) detection of CPM signals [1], 
[2], [3], [4]. In [1] and [2], the use of CPM for MU 
communication over Additive White Gaussian Noise 
(AWGN) channels and serially concatenated CPM over 
Rayleigh fading channels were studied. Multiple Input 
Multiple Output (MIMO) systems [5] can improve 
bandwidth efficiency by exploiting the channel spatial 
diversity thus allowing for a transmission of more data 
streams 
simultaneously. 
MIMO 
systems 
are 
often 
implemented using Space-Time Codes (STC) to increase the 
reliability of transmission. STC for MIMO CPM systems 
were previously proposed with appropriate design criteria in 
[6], and a soft-decision iterative receiver was described [7]. 
Hesse et al. [8] introduced a new family of orthogonal STC 
for CPM. These codes offer good performance and low 
decoding complexity. A non-binary space-time coded 
scheme with m-ary CPM was developed in [9].  
Nevertheless, optimal MU receivers [1] and the MIMO 
CPM receivers with STC [6], [7], [9] exhibit significantly 
higher complexity. MIMO CPM receivers for STC studied 
in [6-9] do not concern MU scenario. In literature [3], [4] the 
multiuser Frequency-Division Multiplexed (FDM) systems 
using CPM over AWGN channel were investigated. In [10], 
a method of estimating Channel State Information (CSI) has 
been shown to considerably improve performance of MU 
FDM-CPM systems. However, MIMO techniques are not 
considered in [3], [4], [10]. 
This paper investigates the performance of multiuser 
coded FDM-CPM systems with MIMO transmission. To 
ensure system simplicity, the employed MIMO scheme does 
not use Space-Time Codes. The system achieves a high 
Spectral Efficiency (SE) and low Bit Error Rate (BER), 
provided that an appropriate low-complexity iterative 
algorithm for Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) cancellation is 
implemented in the MU receiver. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
discuss the system model. In Section III, the simulation 
results are presented and, finally, conclusions are drawn in 
Section IV. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
In FDM uplink wireless transmission, the spectral 
efficiency can be improved by reducing the inter-carrier 
frequency spacing. Thereby, inter-channel interference 
increases. The ICI greatly depends on the normalized inter-
carrier frequency spacing  , where T is the symbol 
interval and  is the frequency spacing in Hz between 
carriers. The carrier spacing  is fixed to the value needed 
to achieve a desired Asymptotic Spectral Efficiency (ASE).

where RC is the rate of the puncturedchannel code,M is the 
size of the CPM input alphabet and  is the number of 
transmit antennas, which is assumed to be ‚â§ MR, the number 
of receiver antennas. In [4], it was shown that it is possible 
to obtain a major improvement in SE thanks to a simple 
iterative ICI cancellation technique applied at the multiuser 
CPM receiver. The overall receiver complexity grows only 
linearly with the number of users. In this paper, MU FDM-
CPM systems with  " antennas (MIMO("# 
systems) are investigated, their performance is assessed and 
compared to Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) scheme. 
The MIMO schemes are used in their full spatial 
multiplexing configuration. Figure 1 shows a block diagram 
of the proposed system. At the input, each kth user binary 
information sequence $%, ‚Ä¶ , $()*, is converted into several 
() parallel streams. Each data stream is conveyed to one 
of  encoding modulators, each consisting of an outer 
Convolutional Encoder (CE) connected to the inner CPM 
modulator through an interleaver. A rate 1/3 systematic 
recursive CE with four states and good distance properties 
[11] has been chosen. Its connection polynomials (in octal 
notation) are (7; 5; 3)8, where 78 represents the coefficients 
of the feedback polynomial [9]. In order to achieve higher 
rates, the CE output is punctured as in [9]: a rate-matching 
algorithm is used to obtain coding rate RC=3/8. The 
interleaver that connects the outer encoder to the CPM 
modulator is a symbol, spread (S-random) interleaver [12] 
whose parameters are set according to the code word size. 
The convolutional encoding, puncturing, interleaving, and 
modulation are realized by the CE-CPM blocks shown in 
Figure 1. Each user signal is characterized by a distinct 
phase +( and delay ,(, as typically occurs in uplink systems. 
Ideal power control is considered here. As a result, the 
received signal power is equal for all users. The signal at the 
receiver input can be written as

where - ‚àà ‚àÅ7 is the received signal vector, /8 ‚àà ‚àÅ79:is

Each receive antenna receives a faded superposition of the 
 simultaneously transmitted signals corrupted by additive  
white Gaussian noise. The fading is assumed to be flat 
anddistributed according to a Rayleigh pdf. The random path 
gains between transmit antenna i and receive antenna j, 
gi,j(t), are independent complex Gaussian random variables 
with zero mean and variance per dimension 1/2. The fading 
is slow, such that the "fading coefficients are constant 
during a frame, but vary from frame to frame. The AWGN 
noise components nj(t), are independent zero-mean complex 
Gaussian random processes with power spectral density N0.  
The received signal on antenna j is then:

The function of the MMSE block is to compensate for the 
effect of the channel by inverting the channel matrix 
according to the MMSE criterion (4, 5). The signal y from 
MMSE reaches the ICI cancellation block. The receiver 
carries out ICI cancellation through a set of single-user MAP 
detector/remodulator blocks, as described by Perotti et al. 
[4]. The remodulators make use of the output of the MAP 
detector to compute the remodulated signal sk
(i)(t) relative to 
the kth user and ith iteration. The channel decoder performs 
two iterations loops. The inner loop is formed by the ICI 
canceller, the MAP detector, the CPE SISO decoder and the 
remodulator, while the outer loop involves the CPE SISO 
decoder, the CE SISO decoder, the interleaver and the 
deinterleaver between the inner CPE decoder and the outer 
CE decoder. ICI cancellation can be performed while 
executing the decoding iterations to enhance the receiver 
performance. In such case, after the inner CPE decoder is 
executed, remodulation is performed. Then, interference 
cancellation is performed and the CPM receiver, including 
the inner CPE decoder, is again executed. The decoder starts 
decoding a received code word executing NIC inner 
iterations. Then, it executes ND times an outer iteration 
followed by an inner iteration. This way, ICI cancellation is 
performed as part of the decoding iterations and it results in 
an improved ICI cancellation [4]. On the final outer 
iteration, a decision is made on the transmitted data symbols 
$Y%, ‚Ä¶ , $Y()*. 
III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSION  
Computer simulations have been made to evaluate the 
performance of the proposed MU serially concatenated CE 
FDM-CPM MIMO system. Different combinations of 
parameter setups for the MU FDM-CPM MIMO systems 
have been simulated. The most representative results have 
been selected for the presentation (hence the choice of 
parameters , M, L, h). For comparison, performance of 
the MU FDM-CPM SISO system and the SISO and 
MIMO(2x2) systems with single user (no ICI) are also 
evaluated. We assume perfect knowledge of CSI at the 
receiver. In the considered system, we use full response 
(L=1) CPM modulation with the following parameters: M=4, 
h=1/5, L=1, RECtangular pulse shape (REC),   0.5, 
RC=3/8, which implies an ASE=1.5 bits/s/Hz for the SISO 
system, and 3 or 4.5 bits/s/Hz for the MIMO system with 
two or three transmit antennas (=2, 3), respectively. 
Simulations have been executed using information data 
words consisting of 1000 bits. The number of iterations in 
the receiver was experimentally fixed as a good trade-off 
between receiver performance and complexity. One ICI 
cancellation iteration (NIC=4) is performed before decoding, 
then four decoding iterations (ND=4) are performed. 
The main results of this investigation are shown in Figure 
2 and Figure 3. The spectral efficiency and bit error rate of 
the considered system are provided. Figure 2 shows the SE 
of the proposed FDM-CPM MIMO system. We observe that 
the MIMO transmission with ICI cancellation exhibits a 
significant SE improvement in comparison to SISO systems. 
Results show that spatial diversity can be exploited without 
the need of complex space-time coding techniques by using 
the proposed receiver, thus leading to considerably improved 
utilization of the available channel degrees of freedom 
comparing to the SISO case. Finally, we show the error rates 
obtained for proposed MU FDM-CPM MIMO receiver, 
Figure 3.  
Different combinations of parameter setups for the MU 
FDM-CPM MIMO systems have been simulated. 
Performance of the proposed receiver has been assessed and 
it has been shown that when the intercarrier frequency 
spacing, modulation scheme, and code rate are carefully 
chosen, performance close to the single-carrier (no ICI) may 
be obtained. The results for SISO and MIMO(2x2) systems 
show that for the BER=10-4 performance of the multiuser 
systems with ICI cancellation is close to that of the single-
carrier systems. The curves (SISO) and MIMO(2x2) are as 
close as 0.5 dB and 0.7 dB to the BER curves (no ICI) for no 
ICI SISO and MIMO(2x2) systems, respectively. 
The results in Figure 3 also show that the Eb/N0 at 
BER=10-4 obtained by enhancing the number of receiver 
antennas from 2 to 4, while keeping constant the number of 
transmit antennas, in the proposed system, equals 8 dB. For 
BER=10-4 the MIMO(2x4) system yields performance 
improvement of about 3 dB with respect to the MIMO(3x4) 
system but the MIMO(2x4) system achieves lower ASE (3 
bits/s/Hz) than the MIMO(3x4) system (4.5 bits/s/Hz). The 
same may be observed comparing the BER for the SISO 
system and the MIMO(2x2). In this case, the degradation is 
about 1 dB but the ASE for the MIMO(2x2) system is twice 
as large as in the SISO system. The degradation of the SISO 
system with respect to the MIMO(2x4) and MIMO(3x4) 
systems is about 7dB and 3.5 dB, respectively, with BER of 
about 10-4. Additionally, the MIMO(2x4) and MIMO(3x4) 
systems prove higher ASE than the SISO system.

We compare the obtained results with those presented in 
[13], where MIMO CPM systems are designed. In [13], 
incoherent demodulator was adopted for full response 
MIMO CPM systems using blind signal separation in the 
receiver to separate the signals without any knowledge of the 
MIMO channel. The CPM scheme used therein is, e.g., 
quaternary with raised cosine (RC) transmit filter, h=1/4 and 
antenna configuration 2x4. Moreover, in [13] only a single 
user system (no ICI) is considered. The best results reported 
in [13] show that BER = 10-4  is achieved at Eb/N0 close to 
20 dB. Our MIMO(2x4) scheme with convolutional 
encoding reaches BER = 10-4 at Eb/N0 =7 dB. The receiver in 
our system operates in presence of strong ICI and has perfect 
knowledge of the MIMO channel. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a multiuser coded FDM-CPM MIMO 
system has been proposed. Through simple MMSE-based 
multiuser detection and low-complexity iterative ICI 
cancellation, considerable improvements in both BER and 
SE are achieved with respect to single antenna systems, 
while the multiuser receiver complexity is kept low. The 
performance evaluation has been presented to demonstrate 
the superiority of the proposed multiuser FDM-CPM MIMO 
systems.
