Abstract—Electric Network Frequency (ENF) acts as a ﬁnger-
print in multimedia forensics applications. In indoor environ-
ments, ENF variations affect the intensity of light sources con-
nected to power mains. Accordingly, the light intensity variations
captured by sensing devices can be exploited to estimate the ENF.
A ﬁrst optical sensing device based on a photodiode is developed
for capturing ENF variations in indoor lighting environments.
In addition, a device that captures the ENF directly from power
mains is implemented. This device serves as a ground truth
ENF collector. Video recordings captured by a camera are also
employed to estimate the ENF. The camera serves as a second
optical sensor. The factors affecting the ENF estimation are
thoroughly studied. The maximum correlation coefﬁcient between
the ENF estimated by the two optical sensors and that estimated
directly from power mains is used to measure the estimation
accuracy. The paper’s major contribution is in the disclosure
of extensive experimental evidence on ENF estimation in scenes
ranging from static ones capturing a white wall to non-static
ones, including human activity.

I. INTRODUCTION
The widespread and ever-increasing use of social media
and the vast amount of video recordings shared online have
exposed individuals to perpetrators seeking illicit proﬁts. A
plethora of tools can alter and manipulate digital content, as
well as metadata information. Through editing, the content
and the time the recording was captured can be altered for
fraudulent purposes.
The Electric Network Frequency (ENF) signal is employed
as an authentication signature in a wide range of multimedia
applications, starting from audio [1] and proceeding to video,
e.g., [2]–[5]. The ENF is embedded in digital content captured
by microphones, devices plugged into power mains, or near
power sources. It ﬂuctuates around its fundamental frequency
at 50 Hz in Europe and 60 Hz in the U.S. due to the instan-
taneous differences between the consumed and the produced
electric load in the power grid. The ENF can also be found in
the higher harmonics of the fundamental frequency [6]. A lot
of effort has been paid to develop ENF estimation algorithms
[7]–[15], tested mainly for audio forensics applications.
The application domain of ENF-related authentication re-
search has been shifted to images and video. It has been found
that ENF can be embedded in video recordings through the
intensity variations of different light sources. A systematic
study of ENF estimation in digital video recordings captured
by various optical sensors was presented in [16]. An algorithm
for detecting the presence of ENF was proposed in [3].
Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) was employed to
derive superpixels. It was attested that the algorithm could
operate in short clips regardless of the camera sensor type.
Extension of [3] was presented in [5], allowing to handle both
static and non-static video recordings. An analytical model
for video recordings captured by a rolling shutter mechanism
was proposed in [17]. A novel method of ENF estimation in
video employing a rolling shutter mechanism was developed in
[18]. There, parametric and non-parametric spectral estimation
approaches were combined to estimate accurately the ENF.
The rolling shutter mechanism was modeled in [19], resorting
to multirate signal processing theory.
In this paper, two optical devices are developed to measure
the ENF signal in indoor environments illuminated by two
different light sources. The intensity emanating from light
sources ﬂuctuates due to the ENF variations in the power
grid. Taking advantage of this fact, the ﬁrst optical sensor
based on a photodiode measures the light intensity ﬂuctuations.
To evaluate the accuracy of the ENF signal captured by the
photodiode-based sensor, a ground truth ENF is essential. For
this reason, a device that records the ENF signal directly from
power mains is also implemented. Luminance variations were
also recorded in an indoor environment employing a common
Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-based
GoPro Hero8 camera, which was set to record at 30 fps
at a resolution of 1080p with the anti-ﬂicker effect turned
off to resemble the operation of a surveillance camera. The
camera serves as a second optical sensor. Comparing the ENF
extracted from the photodiode against that estimated by the
GoPro camera, useful conclusions are drawn regarding their
effectiveness. The experiments involved various setups, such
as varying video duration and distance between the optical
sensor and the white wall background and introducing moving
objects or human activity. The Maximum Correlation Coef-
ﬁcient (MCC) between the ENF estimated by either optical
sensor and that estimated from power mains was employed as
a metric to assess the ENF estimation accuracy.
The paper’s major contribution is in the disclosure of ex-
tensive experimental evidence, which demonstrates that under
certain conditions, the photodiode sensing device delivers a
reliable reference (i.e., ground truth) ENF signal, extending
the work in [16]. This could beneﬁt practitioners and ﬁnd use
in real-life applications where it is quite difﬁcult to acquire
ground truth ENF through a Frequency Disturbance Recorder
(FDR). Several spectral analysis methods were employed
for ENF estimation, such as the Short-Term Fourier Trans-
form (STFT), the Blackman-Tukey (BT) spectral estimate,

the Estimation of Signal Parameters with Rotational Invariant
Techniques (ESPRIT) [20], as well as the spectrum combining
approach [11].
The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section II brieﬂy
describes ENF fundamentals. Section III details the design and
implementation of sensing devices. Section IV discusses ENF
estimation. Section V concludes the paper and suggests future
research topics.
II. ENF FUNDAMENTALS
The ENF is embedded in video recordings captured by opti-
cal sensors in indoor environments illuminated by ﬂuorescent
lamps, halogen lamps, or incandescent bulbs. In particular,
light intensity ﬂuctuates at twice the fundamental frequency
of ENF, i.e., 100 Hz in Europe and 120 Hz in the U.S.
The low sampling rate of optical sensors results in severe
aliasing and, consequently, hinders ENF estimation. To de-
termine the aliased frequencies and estimate the ENF signal
in video recordings, one should apply the sampling theo-
rem [21]. The aliased frequency fA emanated from halo-
gen/incandescent illumination is given as fA = | ˆfN − γ fs| ≤
fs
2 , where fs denotes the sampling frequency of the camera,
ˆfN is the frequency of light source illumination, and γ stands
for an integer factor [22].
The STFT is employed for ENF estimation following the
procedure in [5]. That is, for a window w(t) L samples long
centered around lG, where G is the hop size in samples, the
Discrete-Time Fourier transform of the lth segment of x(t) is
computed [23]:
Xl(ω) =
∞

t=−∞
x(t) w(t − lG) exp (−jωt) .

t=ζ+1 x(t)x(t − ζ), −(M − 1) ≤ ζ ≤
M − 1, is the standard biased estimate of r(ζ) and w(ζ) is an
lag-window of even symmetry.
The spectrum combining approach delivers an accurate
power spectrum based on a weighted summation of multiple
spectral bands from around the signal harmonics [11]. Each
band’s local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is employed to
calculate the corresponding weights. The weighted summation
is given by:
S(ω) =
Za
X
z=1
wz φBT (z ω)
(3)
where φBT (z ω) is the zth harmonic scaled power spectrum,
wz weighs the harmonic spectral bands around each harmonic
taking into consideration the local SNR, and Za = 7 denotes
the number of harmonics considered.
ESPRIT was also used to estimate the ENF signal. The size
of the sample covariance matrix was set to 10 × 10, and the
line spectrum model was set to 3. Due to lack of space, the
interested reader is referred to [5] [20].
III. DEVICES DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
To collect light intensity ﬂuctuations using a photodiode,
following the paradigm in [16], a ﬁrst circuit was designed
based on the photodiode BPW21. This photodiode was chosen
due to its excellent light and spectral sensitivity in the visible
range. A common and robust way to amplify the photocurrent
generated by a photodiode is to utilize two operational ampli-
ﬁers with a positive and a negative feedback loop to stabilize
its behavior and produce a linear correlation between the
light intensity and the current generated [24]. The operational
ampliﬁers OP07D were used as current-to-voltage converters
to capture the ﬂuctuations and pass them to the laptop sound
card. The voltage from the power mains was dropped to 18
Volts Alternating Current (AC) using a center-tapped trans-
former. Also, a full bridge rectiﬁer and a voltage regulator
pair (LM7805/7905) were used to convert the AC voltage
to Direct Current (DC) to power the operational ampliﬁers.
The next step was to wire appropriately the two ampliﬁcation
stages of the operational ampliﬁers. A combination of positive
and negative feedback occurred in the ﬁrst stage to amplify
and clean the initial signal collected from the photodiode. In
contrast, the signal was further ampliﬁed in the second stage
by incorporating another negative feedback stage.

A second circuit was implemented to extract the ENF from
the power mains. A transformer lowered the power mains
AC voltage from 220 Volts to 18 Volts. A voltage divider
further decreased the voltage to about 3 Volts peak-to-peak
in accordance with the laptop sound card voltage tolerance
[25]. The next stage included a high pass ﬁlter to eliminate
the DC component with a cutoff frequency of 32 Hz. Finally,
an anti-aliasing ﬁlter stage was deployed to control the cutoff
frequency set at the Nyquist frequency. More speciﬁcally, since
we wanted to sample the signal at 1 KHz, we set the value
of R4 to 33 KΩ to ﬁlter the signal at around 500 Hz. The
ENF extracted from power mains served as reference ENF.
In practice, the reference ENF is recorded by an FDR, which
provides accurate measurements up to ± 5 · 10−4 Hz [9].
To record simultaneously the ENF mains signal and the
light intensity signal at a proper voltage level, we employed

a 3.5 mm stereo jack cable to feed the ENF mains signal
to the left channel of the sound card and the light intensity
signal from the photodiode to the right channel of the sound
card. The developed devices are depicted in Figure 1. On the

the power mains is shown on the top. The photodiode circuit,

top comprises a voltage divider and two ﬁltering stages for
acquiring the power mains voltage. The central part of the
diagram depicts a full bridge rectiﬁer followed by a voltage
regulator pair to convert the AC signal to +5/-5V DC rails,
which are fed into the operational ampliﬁers. The photodiode
and its two-stage ampliﬁcation circuit can be seen on the right.
A MATLAB script [26] was written to capture both signals.
IV. DEVICE EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
Two sets of experiments were conducted to evaluate the
performance of the designed devices.
In the ﬁrst set of experiments, a GoPro Hero 8 camera was
employed to record a white wall inside a living room. Three
different factors were taken into consideration: (i) two different
light sources, namely, a halogen lamp and an incandescent
bulb; (ii) different distances between the camera and the wall;
and (iii) various video recording durations. In the second set
of experiments, the same camera was used to collect video
recordings under realistic conditions. Video recordings, ground
truth ENF, and code can be found at [27].
A. First set of experiments
To assess the impact of the light source on the accuracy
of ENF estimation, camera recordings of a white wall illu-
minated by either a halogen lamp or an incandescent bulb
were collected. Unless otherwise stated, the ENF estimation
from video recordings was carried out using the SLIC-based
approach [3] [5] and employing the STFT. Comparisons were
made against the ENF estimated from the power mains using
STFT. The camera was mounted at different distances from
the white wall background, namely 0.5 m, 1 m, 1.5 m, 2 m,
2.5 m, 3 m, and 3.5 m. The varying distances are found to
affect the ENF estimation, as can be seen in Table I. When a
halogen lamp illuminated the scene, the top measured MCC
was 0.9778 at a 1 m distance between the camera and the
white wall. When an incandescent bulb illuminated the scene,
the top measured MCC was 0.9738 at the same distance.
Apart from the type of light source and the distance between
the camera and the white wall, the duration of video recordings
may vary. Since video duration is not known apriori, it is
very important to challenge our ability to ﬁnd a match in
such circumstances. For that reason, we conducted another
experiment that considered all three factors. A halogen lamp
and an incandescent bulb were employed, while the camera

was mounted at three different distances from the white wall
background, i.e., 1 m, 2.5 m, and 3.5 m. Although the initial
total duration of the recording was 8 min, we estimated the
ENF for video durations g = 1, 2, . . . , 8 min, as depicted in
Figure 3. When the camera was mounted at a distance of 1 m,
setups including either a halogen lamp or an incandescent bulb
yielded high MCC values even for a short video duration of
1 min. Table II summarizes the MCC measurements. The top
MCC for each light source is shown in boldface. Underlined
MCC indicates the second and third best MCC for each pair
of light sources and distance.

To further assess the developed devices’ performance and
attest that the designed photodiode-based device delivers an
accurate ground truth ENF, we used the same set of recordings
against either the ENF extracted from power mains or the
photodiode. Spectrum combining was used to estimate the
ground truth ENF. The ENF estimation from video recordings
was carried out by employing the BT spectral estimate. For
varying distances between the camera and the white wall, as
well as for both light sources, the same trend in MCC was
observed in Table III.

The ENF estimated at the output of the photodiode-based
device was compared to the ENF measured at power mains.
Spectrum combining was used in both cases. The ENF was
also extracted from the recording captured by the camera,
which was placed 2 m far away from the white wall for
both illumination sources and various video durations using
SLIC and STFT. The top MCC value of 0.9964 was observed
between the ENF extracted from a 2-minute video when an
incandescent bulb illuminated the scene and that measured
from power mains. Regarding the photodiode-based device,

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the ENF measured at
the output of the photodiode-based device can be employed
as a ground truth ENF. The MCC measurements between
the ENF estimated from the photodiode-based device and the
power mains using spectrum combining are reported. Seven
recordings of 8-minute duration each were captured. When
a halogen lamp was employed, the top measured MCC was
0.9988, while the top MCC was 0.9989 for the incandescent
bulb. For all recordings, the MCC exceeded 0.99 regardless of

very complex scene illuminated by a halogen lamp in medium
lighting condition referred to as video (c). Bottom-right: The
same scene as in the bottom-left when the lighting conditions
are dimmer due to a low-power incandescent bulb, referred to
as video (d). Each recording had a duration of 10 minutes.
Fig. 5. Snapshots from 4 non-static videos.
The ENF estimation from video recordings was carried out
by applying the SLIC-based approach [3] [5], bandpass ﬁlter-
ing around the aliased light ﬂickering captured by the camera
for various ﬁlter orders as was set in each experiment, and
ESPRIT unless otherwise stated. Using spectrum combining,
comparisons were made against the ENF estimated from either
the power mains or the photodiode. The objective is to ﬁnd
the best parameters yielding a satisfactory MCC compared
with the ground truth from both the mains power and the
photodiode.
For video (a), the experiment took place in a well-lit
environment with many textures. A jacket moved in front of
the camera throughout the video, not causing sudden changes
in the overall light intensity. A high MCC of 0.997 was
measured using SLIC, bandpass ﬁltering with pass-band [9.9,
10.1] Hz of order ν = 111, and STFT for segment duration of
21s.
Video (b) involves a person moving in and out of the
frame in a dim environment. Despite the fact that more than
half of the scene consists of dark objects with low reﬂection
coefﬁcients, an adequate MCC of 0.8133 and 0.8131 was
obtained, respectively, when the ENF estimated from the video
was compared against the ENF extracted from power mains or
that captured by the photodiode-based sensing device. Figure 6
depicts the MCC between the ENF estimated from the video
and the ground truths captured by mains or photodiode for
varying durations. The pass-band used in the experiment was
[9.99, 10.19] Hz. It is shown that the best results are acquired
for a segment duration of 133 s when a bandpass ﬁlter order
of ν=51 was employed. When the ground ENF was captured
by the photodiode, the highest MCC value was observed for
a segment duration of 109 s.
The ﬁnal two experiments involving videos (c) and (d) are
the most challenging, containing a great number of objects,
different surfaces, and shadows. In the former, the scene
was illuminated by a halogen lamp. Applying SLIC and a
bandpass ﬁlter of order ν=211 before ESPRIT was used for

ENF estimation, an MCC of 0.8736 was obtained for both
ground truths. In the latter, we expected to acquire a lower
MCC due to the lower overall light intensity ﬂuctuation in
proportion to the obstruction the moving person causes to the
scene. The procedure is as above, with the difference that a
bandpass ﬁlter of an order of ν=511 was used. An MCC of
0.7336 was obtained when the ENF extracted from the video
was compared to the ENF from power mains, while an MCC
of 0.7143 was measured when compared to the ENF from
the photodiode. Figure 7 depicts the MCC obtained in both
cases as a function of the segment duration. It is seen that the
MCC between the ENF estimated from the video and either
ground truth ENF follows the same trend for video (c). In

contrast, the MCC is slightly higher when the comparison is
made against the ENF from the power mains than the ENF
from the photodiode. The pass-band in experiments (c) and
(d) was [9.99, 10.19] Hz and [10.04, 10.14] Hz, respectively.
V. CONCLUSIONS
An optical sensor based on a photodiode has been developed
to capture light intensity variations and enable ENF extraction
in real-life scenarios. Multiple experiments have been con-
ducted when a camera is used as a second optical sensor to
record static and non-static videos. Experiments have attested
that the ENF estimated from the photodiode device using the
spectrum combining approach can be employed as a reference
signal for either a halogen or an incandescent bulb. The MCC
between the ENF estimated from a camera recording and the
ENF estimated from either the power mains or the photodiode-
device output follows the same trend, conﬁrming that the
photodiode-device can provide a reliable reference ENF signal.
It has been demonstrated that collecting a valid ground truth
is possible without needing a device plugged into power mains.
This fact allows battery-powered devices to be used as a means
to extract ENF. Future research would address ENF estimation
in indoor environments where LED bulbs illuminate a scene.
LED lighting is now more than ever commercially available,
replacing older lighting technology such as incandescent bulbs
at an increased rate. Therefore, it is urgent to challenge the
ability to timestamp video recordings in such environments.
