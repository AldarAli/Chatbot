Abstract—Online gaming market is thriving but accompanied 
with fierce competitions. Players’ continued use of online 
games is critical for the success of online game providers. This 
study applies UTAUT2 as the research framework to identify 
the key determinants of social network game (SNG) players’ 
continued use intention, and to explore the moderating effects 
of individual characters (such as age, gender, and user 
experience) on the proposed hypotheses as well. The research 
model is examined by analyzing 3919 valid empirical data 
collected among SNG players in China. The results suggest 
that social influence is the most important determinant of 
continuance intention to use SNG, followed by habit, fantasy, 
enjoyment, achievement and price value. User experience and 
age are not moderators, whereas gender exerts moderating 
effects on the paths from social influence, perceived enjoyment 
and price value to continuance intention.

 INTRODUCTION  
Online gaming is emerging as one of the fastest growing 
online entertainment industries with a continued increase in 
the number of participants [24]. Online gaming has become 
powerhouses of electronic-commerce and largely changed 
how the Internet users spend their leisure time [5]. However, 
the growing popularity and soaring revenue are accompanied 
with fierce competitions in online gaming industry. The 
features of Internet make it easy for online gaming players to 
access to and switch to alternative online games. Hence, how 
to retain the existing players and to prolong their playing 
duration in online games have attracted the attention of both 
practitioners and researchers [41]. 
Prior research on online games explored players’ usage 
behavior (e.g., adoption, continued usage, and stickiness) in 
online games was mainly based on the dominant information 
systems (IS) theories, such as theory of reasoned action 
(TRA)[14], technology acceptance model (TAM) [11], and 
theory of planned behavior [2]. However, these theories were 
mainly developed in the work related settings to study 
employees’ IT usage for utilitarian purposes. They might fall 
short in explaining individual usage of hedonic IS in home 
settings [42].  
UTAUT2 was recently developed based on UTAUT 
which has been developed to explain users’ technology 
adoption behavior in organizational context [37]. UTAUT2 
was selected since it can provide several advantages in the 
current research context. Venkatesh et al. [38] indicated that 
the objective of developing UTAUT2 was to focus on 
individual consumers’ use context. Thus, comparing to 
theories build in the organizational setting for studying 
utilitarian oriented IS usage; UTAUT2 may provide more 
insights to investigate online gaming player’s behavior in 
home settings. Further, UTAUT2 was developed based on a 
rigorous theoretical model UTAUT which has superior 
performances comparing to other eight IS models in 
explaining individual IS usage. Venkatesh et al. [38] argued 
that compared to UTAUT, UTAUT2 showed significant 
improvements in explaining the variance of consumers’ 
technology use intention. Moreover, several constructs, such 
as hedonic motivation, price value, and user habit were 
added into UTAUT2. These constructs were repeatedly 
examined in prior studies as the important determinants of 
individual IS continuance usage in home settings, and have 
not been theoretically incorporated and examined in 
UTAUT.  
In the work of Venkatesh et al., the importance to extend 
or adapt UTAUT2 to different research contexts is 
highlighted. Venkatesh et al. argued that “compare to general 
theories, theories that focus on a specific context are 
considered to be vital in providing a rich understanding of a 
focal phenomenon and to meaningfully extend theories” (pp. 
158). Therefore, it is critical to examine how UTAUT2 can 
be generalized to different research contexts. In prior 
literatures, little research has attempted to apply UTAUT2 in 
the research context of online gaming, e.g., social network 
games (SNG) defined as “a type of browser game distributed 
through social networks fitting to multiplayer and 
asynchronous game playing “[27]. Thus, our theoretical 
choice of examining the extension of UTAUT2 in online 
gaming is further justified.  
In addition, it is indicated that when applying UTAUT2 
to different research contexts, modification or extension of 
UTAUT2 might be needed in order to understand a focal 
phenomenon better. Venkatesh et al. advocated the 
examination of other key constructs that were salient to 
different research contexts when applying UTAUT2 to build 
the models, since new constructs can result in important 
changes in theories in different context. Online gaming is 
different from mobile Internet technology investigated in

UTAUT2. Prior researchers have suggested that the 
explanatory power of a particular model or theory would 
depend on the characteristic of the technology [21]. Thus, in 
the current study, UTAUT2 is selected as the research 
framework, and some modification is done in order to 
understand the phenomenon of continuous play of SNG.  
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Research 
background and research model are discussed in the next 
section, followed by the presentation of the research method 
in Section III. Subsequently, research results are illustrated in 
Section IV. Then, the paper goes on with discussions 
towards the research findings in Section V. Finally, we 
present the conclusion of this study, and discussion of 
limitations in Section VI. 
II. 
RESEARCH BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH 
MODEL  
A. Social Network Games 
Nowadays, social networks services (SNS) (e.g., 
Facebook, MySpace) have become popular among the 
Internet users. People are using SNS for different purposes, 
such as for entertainment and communication. For example, 
Facebook, the most popular SNS, until June in 2013, it has 
1.5 billion monthly active users with an increase of 21 per 
cent compared to last year [13]. Meanwhile, there are 
millions of apps run on SNS. And among these apps, SNGs 
have made great success on SNS by attracting an increasing 
number of players all over the world, and “have spawned a 
whole new subculture” [6]. In spite of the huge popularity 
and rapid growth of SNG, research on SNG is still in an 
infant stage [38]. 
SNGs usually have some features in common. SNG 
players mainly play social games with people in their 
existing social networks, such as friends, family, and co-
workers instead of virtual players meet through the game 
[29]. Most SNGs are designed to be easy for players to play 
[27], and SNG players can interact with others without the 
constraints of time as SNGs are asynchronous [28]. SNGs 
combine multiple elements from both SNS and online 
gaming. 
B. Research Model 
In UTAUT2, seven constructs are identified as the main 
determinants of continuous intention, namely performance 
expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating 
conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit. This 
study aims at investigating individual player’s continued 
intention to use SNG. Thus, some modifications have been 
made in order to make the model fit better to explore the 
research context of SNG as discussed in Section I.  
Venkatesh et al. [38] have suggested that hedonic 
motivation is one of the key factors determining IS users’ 
behavioral intention in non-organizational contexts. In this 
study, perceived enjoyment and fantasy are employed as the 
two factors reflecting hedonic motivations in the SNG 
context. Li et al. [22] found that the hedonic gratification, 
such as perceived enjoyment and fantasy, determined 
individuals’ continued intention to use SNG. Emotional 
response (such as enjoyment) and imaginary response (such 
as fantasy) have also been suggested to be important 
motivations for individual to conduct hedonic consumption 
[20].  
Performance expectancy represents the utilitarian value 
of IS usage and emphasizes the benefits provided to 
consumers by using the technology [38]. The utilitarian 
benefit players expect to gain is the sense of achievement by 
engaging in kinds of activities in SNGs, such as gaining 
power or accumulating in-game symbols of wealth, 
competing with other players in the SNG, and achieving 
higher game levels [22][43]. Therefore, in the current study, 
achievement is used to reflect the utilitarian value driving 
individuals’ continuance intention to use the SNG.  
Effort expectancy is similar to perceived ease of use and 
means the degree of ease associated with consumers’ use of 
technology. However, this construct has been argued to lose 
its influence on continuance intention when users accumulate 
experience during their continued use stage [18]. Moreover, 
a SNG is usually designed for players to obtain the game 
rules and skills easily. Thus, effort expectancy is not 
included in this study to explore continued use of SNG.  
Facilitating conditions refer to consumers’ perceptions of 
resources and support available to perform behavior. The 
purpose of the current study is to examine the players who 
have accumulated experience in SNG use. Venkatesh et al. 
[38] pointed out that the users with more experience depend 
less on external support. Furthermore, SNGs are featured as 
easy-learning curve, free-to-play pattern via no matter PC or 
mobile devices, and requiring less continuous time and effort 
[27],[28]. These features enable the SNG players to require 
little additional support for learning, device, location and 
time to continue playing a SNG. Hence, we assume the 
influence of facilitating condition can be marginal in the 
current research context and it is not included in our research 
model.  
In this research, we also explore the moderating roles of 
individual characters (age, gender and user experience) on 
the relationships from independent variables to dependent 
variable as proposed in UTAUT2. The moderating effects 
exerted by age, gender and user experience have attracted 
attention in online gaming studies. Prior online gaming 
research claims different results. For example, Lin et al. [31] 
reported the moderating effect of gender on perceptions of 
online game loyalty, whereas, Ha et al. [17] claimed age was 
a more significant moderator on perceptions of online 
gaming loyalty, gender only exerted marginal moderating 
effect. Hence, the moderating effects of these individual 
characters should be examined in the current study. 
Based on the above ground, six constructs are proposed 
to predict continuance intention, including achievement, 
social influence, perceived enjoyment, fantasy, price value, 
and habit. Since behavioral intention has been examined to 
be the dominant determinant of IS actual use in the prior IS 
research, in this study, we focus on exploring the 
determinants of continuance intention. The research model is 
presented in Figure1.

Figue 1. Research Model 
C. Research Hypotheses 
The achievement components refer to playing SNG to 
gain power, to progress rapidly, to accumulate in-game 
symbols of wealth or status, and to compete with others [7]. 
Suznjevic and Matijasevic [35] found that achievement was 
the most important motive for players to play the MMORPG. 
Prior research results towards online games have supported 
this argument and indicated that achievement positively 
predicts continuance intention to play online games [7], [22]. 
Thus, it is reasonable to expect that achievement will 
influence SNG continuance intention, and the following 
hypothesis is proposed:   
H1. Achievement is associated with SNG continuance 
intention positively.  
Social influence refers to the extent to which players 
perceive that important others believe they should continue 
playing a particular SNG [38]. Social influence is included as 
a major predictor of behavioral intention in UTAUT2. Lee 
[29] claimed that many players decided to play online games 
was just because their friends recommended them to do so. 
Similarly, Hsu and Lu [23] conducted an empirical study 
with 233 responses in the context of online games and 
supported the argument that social influence had significant 
impact on intention to play online games. Thus, it is 
reasonable to argue that SNG players are more likely to 
continue playing SNG if their friends encourage them to 
continue playing it. Hence, the following hypothesis is 
suggested:  
H2. Social influence is associated with SNG continuance 
intention positively. 
Perceived enjoyment in the current study refers to the 
extent to which the activity of playing the SNG is perceived 
to be enjoyable in its own right, apart from any performance 
consequences that may be anticipated [12]. Perceived 
enjoyment is theorized to predict behavioral intention 
directly [19]. In online games settings, Ha et al. [17] 
indicated that “games must, of course, provide players with 
enjoyment, as part of their basic nature”. Players are more 
willing to persist in playing online games in the future when 
their behavior is prompted by intrinsic motivation, such as 
perceived enjoyment [40]. Thus, it seems reasonable to argue 
that SNG players are more likely to continue playing SNG if 
they perceive there perceive more enjoyment during their 
game playing process, and the following hypothesis is 
proposed: 
H3. Perceived enjoyment is associated with SNG 
continuance intention positively. 
Hedonic consumption studies in marketing discipline 
suggest that seeking product-related fantasy and imagine is 
an important determinant for pleasure-oriented consumption 
behavior [20]. Prior research in the online gaming context 
also identified fantasy as a major motive for individuals to 
play online games [26], [32]. In the SNG settings, players 
can construct and realize their fantasy by trying different 
identities, fancy avatars and conducting activities, which are 
not possible for them to do in the real life. It seems that SNG 
players are more likely to continue playing the SNG if they 
perceive the SNG is with fantasy. Thus, it is proposed that: 
H4. Fantasy is associated with SNG continuance 
intention positively. 
In UTAUT2, price value is proposed as a direct key 
determinant of behavioral intention and is conceptualized as 
consumers’ cognitive trade-off between the perceived 
benefits of the applications and the monetary cost for using 
them [38]. SNGs are usually provided for free to register and 
basic play. However, players have to pay for fancy 
decorations and powerful equipment, or if they want to 
achieve higher game levels quickly. Hence, SNG players are 
also consumers and will be affected by price value. 
Therefore, we follow the trend of UTAUT2, and assume 
that: 
H5. Price value is associated with SNG continuance 
intention positively. 
 Ajzen and Fisherbein [1] claimed that habit was a driver 
of continuance intention and explained the effect of habit on 
behavioral intention from the instant activation perspective 
(IAP). IAP suggests that the relationship from habit to 
behavioral intention is equivalent to and is an expedited form 
of conscious processing theory. The formed habit triggered 
by the attitude objects or environmental cues can activate the 
behavioral intention which is well-established and restored. 
Venkatesh et al. [38] supported this argument and verified 
the significant impact of users’ habit on behavioral intention. 
Hence, it is postulated that: 
H6. Habit is associated with SNG continuance intention 
positively. 
In the research model, the postulations of moderating 
effects in UTAUT2 are followed and examined. The paths 
from social influence perceived enjoyment, fantasy, 
achievement and habit to behavioral intention are 
hypothesized to be moderated by age, gender and 
experience. The path from price value to continuance 
intention is postulated to be moderated by age and gender. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHOD 
A. Instrument Development 
The study employed survey as the research method for 
gathering empirical data. Each construct in the research 
model was measured with multiple items adapted from 
extant literatures to improve the content validity [35]. Items 
were slightly modified according to the research context. 
Each item was measured with a five-point Likert scale, 
ranging from disagree (1) to agree (5).

MMEDIA 2014 : The Sixth International Conferences on Advances in Multimedia

The research model includes seven constructs. Items 
measuring social influence, price value and habit are adopted 
from Venkatesh et al. [38]. Continuance intention is 
measured by two items adopted from Lee [29]. The 4 items 
developed by Wu et al. [41] were employed to measure 
achievement. Fantasy (FA) was measured by three items 
adapted from the work of Sherry and Lucas [34]. Three items 
developed by Ghani and Deshpande [16] were used to 
measure perceived enjoyment. 
The questionnaire was developed in English, and then 
translated to Chinese by one of the researchers in the 
research project, who is a native Chinese speaker. Then, the 
questionnaire was sent to 7 participants for pilot study. The 
participants were consisted of 3 IS researchers, a manager of 
the SNG provider and 3 current players of the SNG. Some 
phrases and words were revised according to the feedback 
from the respondents. The clarity and the overall quality of 
the questionnaire were improved. 
B. Data Collection 
Data was collected via a web-based survey from the 
current SNG players of one popular SNG in China. The SNG 
is offered by one of the biggest Chinese social network 
service providers which have multi-million users. Before the 
data collection, the SNG has been running for 6 months and 
is distributed via the social network sites.  
With the help of the company, the questionnaire was 
distributed to registered players of the SNG. The survey 
aimed at studying individual SNG players’ continued usage 
and switching behavior among SNGs respectively. This 
study attempted to explore the continued usage behavior 
among SNG players. This study identified the most potential 
continuous players by asking them whether they have been 
playing the SNG in the recent one month. 
220,000 invitations for answering the questionnaire were 
sent out to a random sample from registered players of the 
SNG from Nov. 23rd to 27th, 2012. No rewards were offered 
to the respondents for answering the questionnaires. All 
respondents provided their respondents voluntarily. As a 
result, 7769 respondents were collected including continuous 
players, switching players and discontinuous players. 3919 
valid responses were from continuous players. In the survey 
on Chinese online game players conducted by iResearch 
(2012), 67.8 per cent of online game players in China are 
male and 32.2 per cent are female. 37 per cent of players are 
below 18 years old, 63per cent of players are above 18 years 
old [25]. From the demographic information of the 
respondents presented in Table 1, it can be seen that the 
sample largely fits to the online game users in China.

C. Data Analysis 
A two-step approach suggested by Anderson and 
Gerbing [3] was adopted to analyze the empirical data. This 
study first analyzed the measurement model to examine the 
reliability and validity of the instruments, and then tested the 
structural model to investigate the research hypotheses. 
Amos 20. was employed to conduct confirmatory factor 
analysis (CFA) to examine the measurement model including 
convergent validity and discriminant validity. Several 
common used model-fit indices were adopted to estimate the 
measurement model. All indices exceed the acceptance level 
(>0.9): GFI=0.956, AGFI=0.939, IFI= 0.981, NFI=0.990, 
CFI=0.981, TLI=0.977 and RMSEA=0.050 [9]. χ2/df is not 
considered, because the value is very sensitive to sample 
size, and current study has a very large sample size. 
Convergent validity and discriminant validity is 
presented in Table 2 and Table 3.

Convergent validity evaluates whether a particular item is 
developed to measure the construct which is supposed to be 
measured. Factor loading, average variance extracted (AVE) 
[9]; composite reliability (CR) and Cronbach’s alpha values 
are usually used to examine convergent validity [9]. The 
values of the indices in our model are presented in Table 2. 
All of the values exceed the acceptance level: factor loadings 
are all over 0.7, composite reliability are over 0.7, AVE are 
over 0.5, and Cronbach’s alpha are over 0.7. Discriminant 
validity reflects whether two constructs are statistically 
distinguished from each other. The results in Table 3 show 
that discriminant validity is achieved, since the square roots 
of AVE on the diagonal are higher than the correlations 
between constructs [9]. 
Two tests are conducted to examine common method 
bias. Harmon’s one-factor test is performed to test common 
method bias. No factor is found to account for the majority 
of the covariance in the variables [33]. In addition, single 
factor model test is performed by modeling all items as 
61

indicators of one factor representing common method bias 
impact. The single-factor model showed a poor fit (GFI = 
0.476; AGFI = 0.371; NFI = 0.546; IFI = 0.547; TLI = 
0.502; CFI = 0.547; RMSEA = 0.222). With results from two 
tests, common method bias is not likely to be a significant 
problem in this study. 
IV. 
RESEARCH RESULTS 
The analysis results on the structural model of multi-
group model were presented in Figure 2. The model fit 
indices suggest a good model fit between the data and the 
research model in current study. The values of indices are 
presented as following: GFI=0.956, AGFI=0.939, IFI= 
0.981, 
NFI=0.980, 
CFI=0.981, 
TLI=0.977 
and 
RMSEA=0.050. Achievement (β = 0.101, p < 0.001), social 
influence (β = 0.306, p < 0.001), enjoyment (β = 0.164, p < 
0.001), fantasy (β = 0.195, p < 0.001), price value (β =0.033, 
p < 0.050), habit (β =0.217, p < 0.001) are positively 
associated with continuance intention significantly. 62.8 per 
cent of variance of continuance intention is explained by the 
research model, which indicates a good explanatory power of 
the research model [9]. According to the analysis results 
presented in Table 4, age and user experience are not 
significant moderators. Gender exerts significant moderating 
effect on the paths from social influence, perceived 
enjoyment and price value to continuance intention.

DISCUSSION 
This study aims to test the explanatory power of a 
research model extended from UTAUT2 in predicting SNG 
player’s continuance intention. As presented in Figure 2, all 
hypotheses in multi-group model are supported. Factors 
including 
achievement, 
social 
influence, 
perceived 
enjoyment, fantasy, price value, and habit all have significant 
and direct influences on continuance intention to play the 
SNG.  
In this study, the effect of social influence is stronger 
than other factors in predicting continuance intention to play 
the SNG. Findings of prior studies have indicated that user’s 
intention was significantly affected by other important 
referees’ opinions when they made decisions of IS usage [4], 
[36], [37], [38]. In this study, players mainly play the SNG 
with real friends/families in their existing social networks. 
SNG players usually connect with these friends/families both 
in real life and the virtual SNG world. Hence, the 
recommendations from important others exert a strong 
influence on player’s continuance intention to play the SNG.  
Fantasy (β=0.195) and perceived enjoyment (β=0.164) 
are found to exert strong influence on continuance intention 
in this study. The present studies indicate that fantasy affects 
the intention to continue playing SNGs, because players 
would like to try out new identities and to be absorbed in the 
virtual fantasy world [28]. In the current study, players can 
play the SNG to reflect their own imaginations when they 
manage and decorate the virtual spaces, avatars and various 
activities in the SNG. The study sheds light on the 
importance of fantasy in predicting continuance intention. It 
implies that players would like to engage in the SNG, if they 
can continually construct and realize their fantasies which 
cannot be performed in real life.  
The finding of perceived enjoyment in this study concurs 
with the arguments that perceived enjoyment is an important 
determinant of behavioral intention in the context of hedonic 
settings [19], [37]. Since the players mainly play the SNG to 
62

obtain the entertainment, this result suggests that the players 
are not likely to continue playing the SNG if they do not 
enjoy it [29].   
One interesting result emerging from the findings is that 
habit is the second important driver of continuance intention. 
Prior studies reported that “habitual previous preferences to 
use a specific IS directly and strongly increase user 
intentions to continue using the same IS again” [15], [38]. 
The result implies that player’s decisions on whether they 
should continue playing the SNG is based on both their 
perceptions of the desirable outcomes of playing the SNG 
and their habit of playing the SNG. Players are more 
intended to play the SNG when playing the SNG becomes 
habitual to them.  
The result towards the influence of achievement is in 
accord with the findings from prior studies. Present studies 
report that achievement exerts significant influence on 
continuance intention in the context of online gaming [40], 
[42]. It can be inferred that players would like to continue 
playing the SNG if they can obtain the sense of achievement 
by participating various kinds of activities in the SNG, such 
as acquiring superior power, and defeating other players. In 
this study, achievement exerts a relatively less effect on 
continuance intention to play the SNG. It implies that getting 
the sense of achievement might not be the premier target for 
players to play the SNG. Instead, players might engage in the 
SNG for other reasons, such as for realizing the fantasy, and 
experiencing the enjoyment during the process.  
The study provides interesting findings on how 
individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender and experience) 
moderate the effects of achievement, social influence, 
perceived enjoyment, fantasy, price value, and habit on 
continuance intention. User experience is not a significant 
moderator according to the test results presented in Table 4. 
Among the groups with different use experience, there is no 
significant difference on the effect of their perceptions 
(including 
achievement, 
social 
influence, 
perceived 
enjoyment, fantasy and habit) on continuance intention. In 
other words, the players who started playing the SNG earlier 
and the players who started playing the SNG later do not 
have different perceptions on continuance intention to play 
the SNG.  Since a player with longer playing history does 
not necessarily suggest that the player is a heavy user who 
plays the SNG frequently.   
 In addition, no statistically significant differences 
between different age groups are found according to analysis 
results shown in Table 4. The result is consisted with the 
work of Lee [29] which reports that no paths are significantly 
moderated by age in online gaming.  It seems that in the 
current study players with different ages, no matter they are 
adolescences or adults, do not have different perceptions 
towards 
the 
effects 
exerted 
by 
factors 
(including 
achievement, social influence, perceived enjoyment, fantasy, 
price value and habit) on continuance intention to play the 
SNG in the post-adoption stage. 
Gender plays moderating role on the paths from social 
influence, perceived enjoyment and price value to 
continuance intention according to the analysis result 
presented in Table 4. The finding indicates that the path 
coefficient from social influence to the continuance intention 
for males was significantly larger than that for females. This 
finding suggested that the effect of social influence on the 
intention to play online games is stronger for males than 
females. It can be inferred that male players are more likely 
to be influenced by the most important people around them 
when they make decisions on continuing or not continuing 
using the SNG.  It is probably because males are usually 
more interested in playing online games than females do. 
Hence, male players concern the information towards online 
games more than females do, including recommendations 
from important others. 
Moreover, the effect of enjoyment of playing SNG on 
continuance intention is stronger for females than males. It 
can be inferred that female players concern more about the 
entertainment obtained in playing SNG compared to male 
players. It might be due to the design of less violent and less 
competitive features of the SNG. These features enable 
females to have pleasant experience from the process of 
playing. Finally, as we expected, female players concerns 
more about the price value compared to male players when 
they make decision on continuing playing SNG. The result is 
consistent with prior findings which suggest that women are 
likely to pay more attention to the prices of services and will 
be more cost conscious than man [38].  
VI. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORIES AND 
PRACTICES 
The study provides some implications for both theories 
and practitioners.  
From a theoretical perspective, in the prior literature, 
little research has explored continuance intention in the 
online game settings based on UTAUT2, especially SNG [6]. 
This study filled the gap by developing the research model 
based on UTAUT2 and identified the key determinants of 
continuance intention in SNG. Furthermore, this study 
contributes to a theoretical understanding of the explanatory 
power of the extended model based on UTAUT2.  By 
explaining a relatively high proportion of variance in the 
continuance intention, this study suggests that the tailored 
UTAUT2 is suitable for investigating continuance intention 
in SNG. 
  Through the examination of the research model, this 
study highlights the important factors in influencing 
continuance intention to play the SNG, namely social 
influence, habit and hedonic motivations (e.g., fantasy and 
perceived enjoyment), followed by achievement and price 
value. The importance of fantasy and achievement in 
predicting SNG continuance intention offers new insights 
into explaining the utilitarian and hedonic motivations in 
hedonic IS research, especially in SNG games. The analysis 
results on the moderators of age, gender, and use experience 
reveals that individual characteristics of online game players 
can still be the moderators, and its moderating effect, such as 
age and user experience are diminishing in the online gaming 
context. 
From a practical perspective, this study emphasizes the 
strong impact of social influence to continuance intention. 
Thus, SNG providers should try to use the networks of SNG 
63

players to facilitate players’ continuance behavior via 
different online communication channels, such as the 
popular social network sites, Renren, Sina Microblog, and 
QQ.  
The importance of habit in predicting SNG continuance 
intention suggests that SNG providers should raise some 
strategies to help the development of SNG players’ habit, 
such as offering players rewards for repeated and prolonged 
usage to foster the habit.  
The finding on fantasy in predicting continuance 
intention suggests that SNG providers should offer more 
fancy themes, diverse imaginary identities and activities, and 
novel virtual worlds in their SNG design in order to retain 
their SNG players. Meanwhile, the SNG providers can 
strengthen player’s sense of achievement by providing more 
opportunities for players to gain more in-game wealth, 
compete with other players, and achieve higher game levels.  
Finally, the moderator test findings in age (a moderator) 
and gender (not a moderator) suggest that the SNG providers 
should try to balance the preferences of both male and 
female in their SNG design, but not the user age yet. The 
finding that user experience is not a moderator offers the 
SNG providers suggestion that they should focus more on 
the heavy SNG players who play the SNG quite often, but 
not those with long time use experience. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND LIMITATION  
The main purpose of this study was to investigate the 
determinants of a player’s continuance intention in online 
gaming. By applying and tailoring UTAUT2 to study 
continuance intention in online gaming, we found UTAUT2 
to be a useful theoretical model in our context. Thus, the 
explanatory power of UTAUT2 is expanded in the new 
research context, since all the constructs in the research 
model are statistically significant. Further, comparing to age 
and experience, gender exerts more significant moderating 
effects. These unexpected results also contribute to a better 
understanding of a player’s continuance intention, and 
provide practical suggestions to online game service 
providers. 
This study is subject to some limitations. Firstly, we 
conducted the research in China which has different culture 
from other countries. The examination of the results in other 
countries may provide richer insight in understanding 
continued use of SNG. Secondly, the research setting in 
current study is SNG as one form of online games. This 
study need to be replicated in other types of online games. 
Finally, we only examined the moderating role of age, 
gender 
and 
experience. 
Studies 
investigating 
other 
moderators (e.g., education level, income level, social status) 
may provide more understandings on continued usage in 
online games
