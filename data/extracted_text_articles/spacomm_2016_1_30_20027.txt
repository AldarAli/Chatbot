Abstract—This 
paper 
presents 
measurement 
and 
characterization of ultra wideband propagation with a view to (at 
least partly) replacing wired interface buses in spacecrafts with 
wireless links. Channel responses in the frequency- and time-
domain, spatial distributions of UWB and narrowband 
propagation gains, delay spreads, and throughputs were 
measured with use of four different-sized shield boxes (simulating 
miniature satellites). In terms of Frequency domain, narrowband 
resulted in nearly 35-dB fading at several “dead spots” caused by 
multipath 
environment, 
UWB 
yielded 
none. 
However, 
significantly long delay spreads and thus limited link 
performance are caused by multipaths within a conductive 
enclosure. Even in such an environment, it was found that delay 
spreads can be suppressed by partially paneling a radio absorber 
and apertures (perforated on the outer surface of satellites). The 
results revealed that commercially-available UWB devices were 
capable of accommodate up to 480-Mb/s data buses within 
spacecrafts.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, a number of studies have been reported about 
wireless 
communications 
in 
closed 
and 
semi-closed 
environments [1]-[4]. We proposed wireless communication 
within a spacecraft for replacing wired interface buses with 
wireless links and experimentally studied ultra wideband 
(UWB) radio propagation in a small scientific spacecraft [5]. 
Narrowband wireless links within a spacecraft were 
numerically calculated and evaluated in [6]. However, 
narrowband wireless communication systems cause spatial 
fading in multipath environments and therefore need a 
substantial amount of fading margin. On the other hand, UWB 
signals suffer less from multipath fading, and thus provide 
more dependable, higher-speed links (e.g., maximum of 400 
Mb/s per node attained with SpaceWire [7], equaling the 
standards of a wired onboard data bus). 
As on-board mission equipment diversifies, the volume and 
weight of cable used to interconnect subsystems increase. 
Since data buses used in manned spacecrafts are required to be 
tripled, the weight becomes further significantly heavy. 
Moreover, spacecrafts have been assembled manually for the 
most part, resulting in high costs and long lead times. 
Particularly, harnessing, interconnecting, and testing interface 
buses have been becoming much more time-consuming, as 
spacecraft complexity increases [8]. Although wireless 
technologies have not been utilized within spacecrafts as a

physical layer of data buses, applying wireless technologies to 
a portion of signal wires could be extremely useful. A use of 
wireless connections within the spacecrafts could contribute to: 
(i) reduction of cable weight and launching cost as a result, (ii) 
reduction in the cost of manufacture, and (iii) more flexibility 
in layout of spacecraft subsystems, and (iv) more reliable 
connections at rotary, moving, and sliding joints. In this study, 
UWB signal propagation was measured (3.1 — 10.6 GHz, the 
full-band UWB, 4.2  — 4.8 GHz, a part of the low-band UWB 
proved in Japan, and 7.4 — 7.9 GHz, a part of the high-band 
UWB approved in Japan) in a shield box. In Section II, our 
experiment setup was presented. Measurement results of 
propagation and transmission are described in Section III and 
IV respectively. Section V concludes the paper.

EXPERIMENT SETUP 
A shield box, 430 mm long × 470 mm wide × 435 mm high, 
simulating a small scientific spacecraft “INDEX/REIMEI” 
(launched in 2005) was used for the measurements. Within the 
shield box, the transmitting antenna was fixed at 250 mm 
above the bottom and adjacent to the center of a 430-mm side, 
as shown in Fig. 1. This position was defined as the origin of 
the Cartesian coordinate, whose x and y axes were parallel to 
the sides. The receiving antenna was scanned within a region 0 
≤ x [mm] ≤ 340 and -140 ≤ y [mm] ≤ 140 in 20-mm intervals 
on a polystyrene foam stage (virtually transparent to 
microwave). Since the minimum distance between the antenna 
electric centers was 120 mm < λL / 2π (λL is the wavelength at 
the lowest frequency), all the measurements were carried out in 
a far-field region. The transmitting and receiving antennas were 
omnidirectional, vertically polarized, low voltage-standing-
wave-ratio UWB monopole antennas [5]. Their circular ground 
planes were 100 mm in diameter. During the measurements, 
the conductive top lid was closed.  
Frequency- and time-domain propagation gains were 
measured with a microwave vector network analyzer (VNA). 
Major specifications of the measurements are listed in Table I. 
From the frequency-domain power gain data, the UWB 
propagation gains were calculated by summing the power of 
the gains between the feeding points of the antennas over the 
occupied bandwidth:

Root-mean-square (rms) delay spread was calculated from the 
time-domain power gain (delay profile) P(τi), where τi is the i-
th path delay. The rms delay spread (S) is given by

A commercially-available device of WiMedia [9] was used 
in the experiments to facilitate a high data rate and to reduce 
the fading margin.  Its major specifications are listed in Table 
II. The WiMedia, a high-speed wireless personal area 
communication standard, utilizes a multiband-OFDM. In 
OFDM, the input data are divided into blocks of the same size, 
where each block is referred to as an OFDM symbol. By 
appending a cyclic prefix to each OFDM symbol, intersymbol 
interference can be removed as long as the prefix is longer than 
the impulse response of the channel (typically represented by 
the delay spread). The multiband-OFDM employs a 60.61-ns 
zero postfix. When the delay spreads are sufficiently shorter 
than 60.61 ns, therefore, the WiMedia devices can be used,

PROPAGATION RESULTS 
The spatial distributions of continuous wave (CW) and 
UWB propagation gains within the shield box are shown in Fig. 
2. Since the shield box didn’t have a precise symmetry, the 
propagation gain of CW was asymmetric. Propagation gains 
ranged -41 — 6.1 dB for CW, -15 — -12 dB for the full-, -14 
— -9.7 dB for the low-, and -19 — -13 dB for the high-band 
UWB. While CW resulted in up to 35 dB fading at several 
“dead spots” caused by multipath interference, propagation 
gain variations were 4.7, and 4 dB for full-, low-, and high-
band UWB. Spatial distribution of delay spreads for full-band 
UWB is depicted in Fig. 3. The delay spreads ranged from 43.7

to 64.3 ns. The conductive enclosures yields a long delay 
spread which causes inter-symbol interference, and hence an 
irreducible error floor when the modulation symbol time is of 
the same order as the delay spread. 
A. Effects of Volume 
The inner volume (V) of the box was varied between 1.1, 
2.2, 4.4, and 8.8 × 10-3 m3 , as listed in Table III, with use of 
polystyrene-foam parallelepipeds, covered with aluminium foil 
and fitted to the bottom of the box. The height of the 
transmitting and receiving antennas was approximately a half 
of the box height. Examples of frequency-domain propagation 
gains are presented measured at (x, y) = (300, 0) with a volume 
of 1.1 × 10-2 m3 and 8.8 × 10-2 m3, in Fig. 4. The frequency- 
and time-domain gains increase with the inner volume [10]. At 
a given delay time, a multipath component arrives at the 
receiving antenna after a different number of reflections on the 
walls for different-sized boxes, while the traveling time is the 
same, and hence the total free space propagation loss is the 
same. The number of reflections increases with decreasing the 
inner volume, since a mean free path length between 
reflections is approximately proportional to V 1/3. Since total 
reflection losses on the conductive (but not perfectly 
conductive) walls are roughly proportional to the number of 
reflections, the propagation gain at a given delay time 
decreases with increasing inner volume.  
The delay spreads were found at more than 85 ns for V = 
8.8 × 10-3 m3, while 5 ns for V = 1.1 × 10-3 m3. Delay spreads 
against the inner volume are plotted in Fig. 5 for full-, low-, 
and high-band UWB. In all cases, the delay spreads increased 
with the inner volume. Delay profiles at (300, 0) were 
calculated by the FDTD method and the delay spreads were 
derived therefrom, when the height was varied between 435, 
218, 108, and 54 mm, while the bottom area was fixed at 430 
mm × 470 mm. The heights of the antennas were half of the

electromagnetic energy leakage of the shield box (shielding

effectiveness was approximately 60 dB), while the perfect 
shielding was assumed in the simulation. The longer delay 
paths were attributed to the heavy multipaths within the 
conductive closed space. 
B. Effects of Radio Absorber 
A patch of a thin elastic radio absorber was attached at the 
center of the bottom of the shield box to suppress the delay 
spreads [5]. The absorbers, 2.3 and 1.8 mm thick, usable in 
vacuum, attenuated radio wave reflection by 20 dB at 4 and 7 
GHz, respectively, and by 10 dB within a 1.5-GHz bandwidth. 
The absorber of 2.3-mm thickness was used for low-band 
UWB experiments, and that of 1.8 mm for full- and high-band. 
Propagation properties were measured while the patch of the 
strip was 0.093 m2 (= 305 mm square) × 2-n, where n = 0, 1, 2, 
…, 6, corresponding 8 × 2-n % against the total inner surface.  
The radio absorber panel can suppress the long delay 
spreads, as shown in Fig. 7. Received energy losses caused by 
the radio absorber were estimated: the absorbers of 0.003 m2 
(0.6% against the total inner surface area) and 0.013 m2 area 
(4% against the total inner surface area) resulted in 2 and 5 dB

in energy loss, respectively. Including these energy losses, the 
relation between the fading depth and the occupied bandwidth 
was derived, similarly to the case of no absorber. While the 
absorber panel was places in the center of the bottom of the 
box in this experiment, Sasaki et al. reported that radio 
reverberation characteristics was almost independent of the 
position of a small piece of absorber lining within a shielding 
chamber [11]. 
C. Effect of Apertures on the Surface 
The effect of aperture size on UWB propagation was 
evaluated inside the shield box. The box (the same size of the 
shield box) had three 200 mm × 200 mm square holes: one in 
the center of the top lid and the others in the center of both side 
surfaces, as shown in Fig. 8. For changing total area of 
apertures, conductive 240 mm × 240 mm square panels with or 
without circular apertures were attached on the holes with use 
of conductive gaskets between mating surfaces. The diameter 
of the circular apertures was 12.5, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mm.  
The UWB propagation gains were almost invariable for the 
total area of apertures normalized by the total area of the inner 
surface between 0.01 and 0.1%, and gradually decreased with 
the area beyond 10-3 m2 or 0.1%, as shown in Fig. 9. The lower 
UWB propagation gains in the high-band UWB were 
ascribable to longer free space propagation losses. The delay 
spreads were gradually decreased with the total area of 
apertures, as shown in Fig. 10. The propagation gain, the delay

profiles, and the delay spreads were found statistically unvaried 
between the regions near and far from the apertures [12]. 
IV. 
TRANSMITTION PERFORMANCE 
A commercially-available device of WiMedia [8] was used 
to measure link throughputs. The link throughputs were 
measured with use of a pair of WiMedia devices, one of which 
was links to a solid state drive (SSD) via USB 2.0 interface, 
and the other was connected to a personal computer with a 
built-in SSD via a PCMCIA interface. Since the throughputs 
fluctuated typically ±4 Mb/s per trial, a number of trials 
(normally 35) were carried out to reduce the variation within 
±1 Mb/s.  
Throughputs against the inner volume are plotted in Fig. 11 
for full-, low-, and high-band UWB. The throughputs 
decreased with increasing the inner volume, which was 
attributable to wider delay spreads. The throughput for low- 
and high-band UWB was up to 96 and 100 Mb/s, when the 
absorber panel covered 4 and 8% of the total inner surface area, 
respectively, as shown in Fig. 12. With apertures, the 
throughputs were almost invariable for the normalized area of 
apertures between 0.05 and 0.4%, and gradually increased with 
the area beyond 0.4%, as shown in Fig. 13. When the delay 
spreads are suppressed sufficiently shorter than the symbol 
duration, we can use the WiMedia devices, which yield the 
maximum data rate of 480 Mb/s, within the spacecrafts.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Ultra wideband (from 3.1 — 10.6 GHz, 4.2 — 4.8 GHz, 
and 7.4 — 7.9 GHz) and CW (6.85 GHz) propagation and 
transmission were measured and characterized inside a shield 
box emulating a small spacecraft. While CW resulted in nearly 
35-dB fading at several “dead spots” caused by multipath 
environment, UWB yielded none. The UWB systems have 
therefore an advantage over narrowband from the viewpoint of 
reducing fading margins. No dependence on the distance was 
observed for UWB propagation gain, delay spread, or 
throughput, and no apparent spatial correlation between them.  
The conductive enclosures caused abundant multipaths and 
long delay spreads. The delay spreads can be suppressed with 
the use of a small patch of radio absorber and/or with apertures. 
Propagation gain decreased and the fluctuation range of the 
gain increased when increasing the area of radio absorber 
attached on an inner surface. On the other hand, propagation 
gains were almost invariable for the total area of apertures 
normalized by the total area of the inner surface between 0.01 
and 0.1%, and gradually decreased with the area beyond 0.1%. 
The higher UWB propagation gains in the high-band UWB 
were ascribable to higher free space propagation losses. For 
empty enclosures, an 4% area of radio absorber can suppress 
the delay spreads less than 10 ns. With 0.1% area of apertures, 
the delay spreads were found at less than 11 ns. The off-the-
shelf WiMedia devices can be used to accommodate up to 480-
Mb/s data buses within spacecraft, as long as the delay spread 
is suppressed far below 60 ns, from the viewpoint of 
propagation.
