Abstract—Power management is a key feature in today's Internet 
Protocol/ Multi-Protocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) network 
across all market segments. With the aim of controlling the power 
consumption in core networks, we consider energy aware devices 
that are able to reduce their energy requirements by adapting 
their performance. We focus on packet processing engines, and 
router interfaces, which generally represent the most energy 
consumption components of network devices data plane. Our 
goal is to control both the power configuration of pipelines, as 
well as to study the effect of the packet size onto the power 
consumption of an edge router. The results show that the packet 
size is closely related to the power consumption of the edge 
router. It is also shown that there is a tradeoff between power 
consumption and packet latency times. Based on these results, we 
model the formal power consumption equation of the edge 
router.

 INTRODUCTION  
By the continuous growth of customers, broadband access, 
and number of services being offered by telecom operators and 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the energy efficiency issue 
has become a high priority objective, and a significant concern 
for network infrastructure and next-generation network 
devices. The rapid growth of traffic has resulted in a related 
increase in energy consumption. ISPs, and telecom operators 
reported alarming statistics of network energy requirements 
and of the related carbon footprint [1]. The Global e-
Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) estimated the overall carbon 
footprint of European network devices and infrastructure to be 
about 349 MtCO2e (Million Metric Tons of Carbon) in 2020, 
with a 131% increase with respect to 2007 if no green network 
technologies (GNTs) would be adopted [2]. In order to support 
this rapid increase in energy consumption, ISPs need a larger 
number of devices with architectures able to perform more 
complex operations in a scalable way. The majority of current 
network devices operate at their maximum capacity and have a 
constant power consumption independent of the actual traffic 
load, and thus the most of the energy consumed in networks is 
wasted. It is well known that network links and devices are 
generally provisioned for busy or rush-hour load, which 
typically exceeds their average utilization by a wide margin [3]. 
Although this margin is seldom reached, network devices are 
designed on its basis so their power consumption remains more 
or less constant even in the presence of fluctuating traffic load.  
The data plane certainly represents the most energy 
consuming and critical element in the largest part of network 
device architectures since it is generally composed by special 
purpose hardware (HW) elements (packet processing engines, 
network interfaces, etc.) that have to perform per-packet 
forwarding operations at very high speeds. Certain studies 
estimated that the power required at the data plane weighs for 
54% on the overall device architectures, versus 11% for the 
control plane and 35% for power and heat management. 
Internal packet processing engines require about 60% of the 
power consumption at the data plane of a high end router, 
network interfaces weigh for 13%, switching fabric for 18.5%, 
and buffer management for 8.5 [4][5]. Starting from these data, 
we decided to focus on the power consumption of packet 
processing engines and the power consumption of the router 
interface trying to study the effect of the packet size variation 
onto the power consumption of an edge router. After that, we 
analyze the measurement results from numerous cases and 
show that the packet size is closely related to the power 
consumption of the edge router. Through the analysis, it is 
possible to draw a power consumption function of the edge 
router against the packet size. 
In this paper, our main objective is to consolidate two 
factors of power consumption (packet processing engines and 
router interfaces) and find a closed relation between them, and 
provide an analytical model able to capture the trade-off 
between energy consumption and network performance (delay) 
by controlling the power state configurations according to the 
actual traffic load to minimize the power consumption while 
meeting the performance constraints. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces 
literature review and related work. Then we describe the power 
consumption of the packet processing engines in section III, 
and the power consumption of the router interface in section 
IV. Section V shows the analytical model, while measurements

and analysis are shown in section VI. Finally, the conclusions 
are in section VII. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW AND RELATED WORK 
Most of the approaches that study the power consumption 
of data plane of the edge router are directed to study the effect 
of one separate factor from the previous discussed aspects in 
section I, and show the effect of it on the total power 
consumption of the data plane, assuming no variation for the 
other factors. Bolla et al. [6] provide an up-to-date survey on 
the current state-of-the-art in energy efficiency for fixed 
telecommunication networks, and improvements that can be 
introduced in today’s networking equipment. Bolla et al. [7] 
aimed at studying the power consumption of packet processing 
engines by proposing an analytical model able to capture the 
impact of power management of the packet processing engines, 
and tried to optimize it by dynamic adaptation of network 
device resources. Ahn et al. [8] provide measurement of the 
power consumption of a router interface and draw an analytical 
model against the packet sizes. Nedevschi et al. [3] present the 
design of two forms of power management schemes, that 
reduce the energy consumption of network. The first form is 
based on putting network components to sleep during idle 
times, reducing energy consumed in the absence of packets. 
The second form is based on adapting the rate of network 
operation to the offered workload, reducing the energy 
consumed when actively processing packets. Zouaoui et al. [9] 
achieve to adapt the router queue-length by dynamic buffer 
management in such a way, that reduced the energy. In this 
paper, our objective is to consolidate two merged factors of 
power consumption (packet processing engines and router 
interfaces) and find a closed relation between them to study the 
best suitable power configuration of pipelines in both high 
traffic volume (rush hours) and low traffic volume, and achieve 
the best way to optimize the tradeoff between energy 
consumption and network performance indexes (delay) using 
different packet sizes. By merging both contributions [7][8], 
we proposed an analytical model able to capture the impact of 
packet size on the link utilization factor and the packet 
processing capacity, which will affect the power consumption 
of packet processing inside the data plane. The obtained results 
show that for low traffic volumes, it is recommended to use a 
power state corresponds to the minimization of energy 
consumption constrained to low packet latency with high 
packet size. For high traffic volumes, it is recommended to use 
power state corresponds to the maximization of energy 
consumption constrained to low packet latency with high 
packet size. 
III. 
POWER CONSUMPTION OF PACKET PROCESSING 
ENGINES 
In order to reduce the energy requirements of the packet 
processing engine, there are two basic techniques. Firstly, 
Adaptive rate (AR) that allows dynamically modulating the 
capacity of a processing engine (or single pipeline) in order to 
meet traffic loads and service requirements. Secondly, Low 
power idle (LPI) that forces processing engines to enter low-
power states when not sending/processing packets. As 
previously evaluated and sketched in preliminary studies 
[6][7], LPI and AR have different impacts on packet 
forwarding performance. Figure 1 illustrates the effect of AR 
and LPI on packet forwarding performance. We can tune AR 
and LPI mechanisms for each parallel pipeline (interaction 
between AR and LPI). Figure 1(c) shows how AR causes a 
stretching of packet service times, while the sole adoption of 
LPI Figure 1(b) introduces an additional delay in packet 
service, due to the wake-up times. 
 
Figure 1. Packet service times and power consumptions in the cases with (a) 
no power- ware optimizations, (b) only LPI, (c) only AR, and (d) AR and 
LPI [6][7]. 
As sketched LPI and AR have different impacts on packet 
forwarding performance. AR causes a stretching of packet 
service times, while LPI introduces an additional delay in 
packet service, due to the wake-up times. Our goal is to 
dynamically manage the engine configuration in order to 
balance its energy consumption with respect to its network 
performance. Now, we will introduce the Advanced 
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification and 
how it makes AR and LPI capabilities accessible. In general 
computing systems, the ACPI specification provides an open 
standard for device configuration and power management by 
the operating system. This standard models the AR and LPI 
functionalities by introducing two sets of energy-aware states, 
(P) performance and (C) power states. Regarding the C-States, 
C0 indicates the operating state where the central processing 
unit (CPU) executes instructions, while C1 to Cx is processor 
LPI states. As (X) value becomes higher, less power is 
consumed, because the pipeline will be in sleeping state. But 
the transition between active and sleeping states requires longer 
time and more power consumption during transition process. 
i.e., C0 is active mode and C (1... X) are sleep modes. In 
particular, C1 is a state where the processor is not executing 
instructions, but can return to the C0 state essentially 
instantaneously. All processors must support this power states. 
The number of LPI states is considered optional excluding C0. 
In addition, the transition times and the power consumption 
compared 
to 
C0 
depend 
on 
the 
specific 
platform 
implementation [7]. Regarding the P-states, they allow 
modifying the operating energy of a processor by altering the 
working frequency or voltage. So by using P-states, processor 
can consume different amounts of power while providing 
different processing performance at the C0 state. P0 is the 
highest performance state with P1 to PY being successive lower 
performance [7]. The higher index of P and C, the less power 
will be consumed. Transition between different P-states is 
generally very slow with respect to packet processing times. 
IV. 
POWER CONSUMPTION OF ROUTER INTERFACE 
We begin our investigation of power consumption of the 
router interface caused by packet sizes with the increment of 
link utilization. We analyze the power consumption of router 
interfaces with each L2 frame size 64, 256, 512, and 1518 bytes 
as the increase of the link utilization. We empirically found that 
the power consumption of the router interface is directly 
proportional to the link utilization, as well as reverse 
24

ICNS 2016 : The Twelfth International Conference on Networking and Services

proportional with the packet sizes. The power consumption 
increases dramatically when the traffic with 64 bytes L2 frame 
size [8]. The power consumption of the router interface 
increases more than 5 watts and this value can’t be ignored 
because a router which has n interfaces consumes more than 5n 
watts caused by just router interfaces. It is because the router 
utilizes electricity for processing packets pass through the 
router. The more the frames passing through the router; the 
more the power used in the router [8]. 
V. 
ANALYTICAL MODEL 
In this section, a relation between the packet size, the packet 
processing power and interface power is proposed in our study 
based on the adaption of two models presented in [7][8]. The 
case of single pipeline is chosen in this research. For simplicity, 
we adopt the ACPI representation of power management 
primitives and refer to AR and LPI configurations in terms of 
P and C states. Most of the previous studies presented in the 
literature didn’t take into account the relation between the 
internal packet processing power and router interfaces power. 
There are some researches to measure power consumption of 
packet processing engines. We adopted the model in [7], 
because the model evaluation shows an acceptable accuracy. 
Service rate μ represents the device capacity in terms of packet 
headers that can be processed per second. Moreover, we 
assume all packet headers requiring a constant service time. 
The selection of different P and C states is supposed to impact 
on the forwarding engine performance in terms of both packet 
service capacity and wake-up times of the servers. The model 
notation is introduced in Table I. The overall power equation 
for packet processing driven in [7] is illustrated in (1) 
 
ϕ̃ = [1 +

The average packet delay (latency) is defined as the average 
waiting time of the packet inside the processing engine and can 
be calculated according to [7] as in (2) 
W̅ = L̅

2 λβ(1 − ρ)
                            (2) 
 
In addition, as stated in [8], the power consumption of the 
router interface is directly proportional to the link utilization, 
as well as reverse proportional with the packet sizes. So, the 
power consumption of a router interface can be defined as the 
following equation: 
        Pinterface = (EHP
ρ × R
s
) + EPT × ρ × R 
 
                                          = ρ × R (EHP
s
+ EPT)                        (3) 
 
In order to obtain the total power consumption of the router, we 
will consider the switching fabric power and buffer management 
power are constants. The packet processing power and the 
interface power are presented in (1) and (2), respectively. So the 
total power equation will be,

MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYSIS 
Firstly, we begin our investigation of power consumption of the 
router by measuring real world traffic traces between real ISPs in 
Egypt and Italy. First measurement was based on the inbound 
traffic profile of core gateway network router in TE Data (Egypt), 
which is peering with Telecom Italia Sparkle (Italy) and 
connecting together via STM-16 fiber link (2.4 Gbps). The edge 
router is Juniper M320 with switching capacity 320 Gbps, and the 
interface type is serial interface. As shown in Multi Router Traffic 
Grapher (MRTG) figures. Figure 2 (a) shows the daily traffic 
pattern, and Figure 2 (b) shows the weekly traffic pattern. The 
25

evolution of the incoming traffic load follows the classical night-
and-day profile with high similarity between days.

Figure 3. (b) Weekly traffic profile of core TE Data network router peering

Second measurement was performed on the inbound traffic 
profile of other gateway network router in TE Data (Egypt), 
which is peering with Vodafone (Egypt) and connecting 
together via STM-16 fiber link. The edge router is also Juniper 
M320, and the interface type is Giga Ethernet (GE) interface. 
Figure 3 (a) shows the daily traffic pattern, and Figure 3 (b) 
shows the weekly traffic pattern.

Other traffic distributions are described in Measurement and 
Analysis on the Wide Internet (MAWI), which is Japanese 
research group focuses on traffic measurement analysis for 
long term measurement on Internet, and its real-world traffic 
traces are publicly available [10] and part of “A Day in the Life 
of the Internet” [11]. In [7], the experimentations were based 
on multicore Linux SW Router (SR) and the proposed model 
estimation was validated by using real-world traffic traces 
[10][11], and the model evaluation shows an acceptable 
accuracy. The previous traffic profiles show the regular daily 
cyclic patterns with traffic dropping at night and growing 
during the day. In addition, we can figure out that the minimum 
of the traffic typically appears during the first hours of the 
morning, while rush hours are during the day. Hence, we can 
conclude that the traffic distributions are nearly identical 
regarding different types of edge router platforms, regardless 
the router architectures, edge router type and interface type. 
Secondly, we begin our investigation of the power 
consumption of packet processing engines using the analytical 
model of [7], which is validated by the multi core Linux SW 
Router (SR). This choice is mainly due to the fact that current 
commercial routers do not include AR and LPI capabilities, and 
only their nominal and/or maximum power consumptions are 
reported in the datasheets [7]. By studying the power 
consumption of packet processing with various configurations 
of P and C states. The results in Figure 4 show that selecting 
too deep standby C-states may cause a rise in power 
consumption. This is simply caused by the wake up τs from the 
deepest C-state. We realized that for high P and C indexes, the 
packet processing capacity will decrease; also the power 
consumption of packet processing will be decreased. For low 
P-C indexes, the packet processing capacity will be increased 
and the power consumption of packet processing will be 
increased accordingly.  
 
 
Figure 4. Power consumption of packet processing according to various 
configurations of P-and C-states. 
To figure out the best suitable power states of the pipeline 
during normal traffic and rush hours, we have to measure the 
average absolute packet delay, i.e., the average waiting time of 
the packet inside the processing engine of the pipeline. As 
shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, P3-C2 state indicates the 
minimum power consumption (lowest performance) with 
maximum delay during the minimum volume of traffic loads, 
while P3-C1 state indicates almost the same power consumption 
(P3) but with minimum delay during the same minimum value 
of traffic loads. As a result of that, we suggest reducing the 
power consumption of the system with P3 performance (power) 
state, while not using the deepest sleeping state C1.  
Accordingly, for the maximum traffic volume (rush hours), 
both P0-C1 and P0-C2 states indicate the maximum power 
consumption (highest performance) with minimum delay. As 
both states have almost the same performance which is P0, so 
26

ICNS 2016 : The Twelfth International Conference on Networking and Services

we suggest using P0-C1, as it will lead to a minimum delay in 
case of rush hours. Table II illustrates the power consumption 
and average packet delay using different P-C states during the 
maximum and minimum traffic load. By taking into 
consideration the effect of the power consumption of router 
interfaces, CISCO 7609 router is used. It is composed of a 
routing engine, a line card, and one power supply unit. 
Environment around the router is very important for the precise 
measurement of the power consumption. The router should be 
evaluated at temperature of 25 ℃ ± 3 ℃ and the relative 
humidity of 30% to 75%. In addition, the router should be 
evaluated at a barometric pressure between 1020 and 812 mbar. 
In the AC power configuration, the router should be evaluated 
at 230 VAC ± 1%, 50 or 60 Hz ± 1% [8]. We measure the 
power consumption of router interfaces with each L2 frame 
size 64, 256, 512 and 1518 bytes. Figure 6 shows the power 
consumption of the router when the generated traffic is injected 
to each router interface. We empirically found that the power 
consumption of the interface is in the direct proportional to the 
link utilization ρ, as well as in the reverse proportional to the 
packet sizes. The power consumption increases dramatically 
when the traffic with 64 bytes L2 frames size. In the other 
cases, it also increases considerably because the more frames 
passing through the router, the more power used in the router.

As stated in (5), the packet processing capacity μ is indirect 
relation to the link utilization ρ. As the packet processing 
capacity increases, the link utilization factor decreases. Also, 
as the packet size increases, the link utilization factor will be 
increases as recited in (3). So there is indirect relation between 
the packet size and the packet processing capacity as shown in 
Figure 7. As the packet size increases, the packet processing 
capacity decreases [12]. Accordingly, the power consumption 
of the packet processing will be decreased. 
 
As a result, the total power consumption of the router will be 
decreased.

CONCLUSION 
We proposed an analytical model able to capture the impact 
of packet size on the packet processing capacity, which will 
affect the total power consumption of edge router. We found 
also the best suitable power configuration of pipelines in both 
high traffic volume (rush hours) and low traffic volume, and 
achieve the best way to optimize the tradeoff between energy 
consumption and network performance indexes (delay) using 
different packet sizes. 
Firstly, we considered energy aware network devices able to 
trade their energy consumption for packet forwarding. We 
proposed an analytical model able to capture the impact of 
power management capabilities on network performance. This 
study is based on the analytical models represented in [7][12]. 
We focused on the packet processing, which generally 
represents the most energy consuming components of network 
devices (60%), as well as the power consumed in router 
interfaces (13%). Our goal was to find the best suitable power 
configuration of pipelines in both high traffic volume (rush 
hours) and low traffic volume; and to achieve the best way to 
optimize the tradeoff between energy consumption and network 
performance indexes using different packet sizes. 
Secondly, we analyzed and drawn an analytical power 
consumption model of a router interface. We analyzed it against 
the packet size. According to the results, we can find that the 
power consumption of the router interface is in the direct 
proportion to the link utilization as well as in the reverse 
proportion to the packet size. Also, we deduced that the packet 
size is in reverse proportion to the packet processing capacity, 
which will lead to decrease the power consumption of packet 
processing inside data plane as well. The obtained results show 
that for low traffic volumes, it is recommended to use a P-state 
corresponds to the minimization of energy consumption 
constrained to low packet latency with high packet size. For high 
traffic volumes, it is recommended to use a P-state corresponds 
to the maximization of energy consumption constrained to low 
packet latency with high packet size. Also, it is suggested not to 
select too deep standby C-state as it may cause a rise in power 
consumption to make the transition from the sleeping state Cx to 
the active C0 state. 
Our future work will study the power consumption of the 
router taking into consideration the buffer management which 
consumes 8.5% of the total power inside the data plane. Also, 
we will study the effect of different routing protocols on the total 
power consumption besides more practical results by setting a 
practical test bed to validate the analytical model using Network 
Performance Monitor (NPM) and edge routers support the 
energy wise feature.
