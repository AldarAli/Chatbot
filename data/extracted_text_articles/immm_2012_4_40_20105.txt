Abstract—In a disaster, one of the most important issues for 
victims is how to find evacuation routes to safety from 
hazardous areas. To offer such routes, we propose methods 
automatically extracting transportation information and 
traffic problems from tweets written in Japanese and posted 
during a disaster. To investigate the effectiveness of our 
methods, we conducted some experiments using tweets posted 
during the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake in March 2011. 
From the experimental results, we obtained precision of 78.2% 
and recall of 53.4% in automatic extraction of transportation 
information. For extracting traffic problems, we identified 
tweets containing relevant information (we call them traffic 
problem tweets), and extracted traffic problem from them. In 
identifying traffic problem tweets, we obtained precision of 
77.7% and recall of 70.7%. In extracting traffic problems, we 
obtained precision of 87.0% and recall of 57.1%. Thus, we 
have constructed a system for providing transportation 
information and traffic problems in a disaster. 
Keywords-disaster; evacuation routes; information extraction. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Disasters occur frequently throughout the world. For 
instance, there were the large earthquakes in Haiti in January 
2010 and in Sumatra, Indonesia in December 2004. In March 
2011, a massive earthquake of magnitude 9.0 struck off the 
coast of eastern Japan. This earthquake is called the Great 
Eastern Japan Earthquake. It caused tsunamis and an 
accident at a nuclear power plant, and forced large numbers 
of people to evacuate from their homes and towns. In such 
disasters, one of the most important issues for victims is how 
to find evacuation routes to safety from hazardous areas. To 
offer such evacuation routes, there is a need to collect 
transportation information and traffic problems from other 
victims. Because they are so widely used, we focused on 
extracting information from tweets. 
After the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake, 18 million 
tweets were posted on Twitter in a day, which is 1.8 times as 
much as normal. Some tweets contained useful information 
about transportation and traffic problems. In this paper, we 
propose methods for extracting transportation information 
and traffic problems automatically from tweets posted during 
disasters.  In addition, we construct a system for presenting 
the extracted information. We believe that the system can 
offer safe evacuation routes for disaster victims and 
transportation routes for relief materiel. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II describes the system behavior using snapshots. 
Section III describes related work. Section IV explains our 
methods. To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, we 
conducted some experiments, and Section V reports on these 
and the results. We present some conclusions in Section VI. 
II. 
SYSTEM BEHAVIOR 
In this section, we describe our prototype system, which 
(1) provides transportation information, and (2) identifies 
traffic problems. Fig. 1 shows transportation information 
from disaster victims. Arrows with icons indicate 
transportation information. The arrow extends from a 
departure place (shown as ① in Fig. 1) to a destination (②). 
Each icon depicts a transportation method. If the user clicks 
the icon (③), the system shows details of transportation 
information (④). The user can discover that a disaster victim 
evacuated from Ishinomaki City to Ichinoseki City by car. 
Fig. 2 shows traffic problems. An arrow with an icon 
indicates a traffic problem. A traffic problem is indicated by 
an arrow with an icon. The arrow shows that a traffic 
problem has occurred between one end of the arrow  
(shown as ① in Fig. 2)  and the other end the arrow (②). If 
the user clicks the icon (③), the system shows details of the 
traffic problem (④). The user can discover that a traffic 
problem has occurred between Sendai City and Yamagata 
City on Route 48. In this paper, we describe the methods 
used by our system for extracting transportation information 
and traffic problems. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
In this section, we describe some related studies on 
information mining in disasters and extracting transportation 
information. 
A. Information Mining in Disasters 
In time of disaster, vast amounts of data are generated via 
computer-mediated communication; however, it is difficult 
to extract useful information from them for users. There have 
been some studies of information mining in several disasters. 
Verma et al. [1] collected tweets from four different 
disasters, and automatically detected tweets that could 
contribute to situational awareness automatically. They 
obtained over 80% accuracy. 
Sakaki et al. [2] considered each Twitter user as a sensor, 
and detected disaster events based on sensory observation.

They targeted disaster events such as earthquakes and 
typhoons. As an application, they constructed an earthquake 
reporting system. 
There are some studies about evacuation in disasters. 
Iwanaga et al. [3] build an earthquake evacuation ontology 
from twitter and provided the most suitable evacuation center. 
Troung et al. [4] presented a novel framework that manages 
and provides various types of context information required 
for adapting processes in emergency management systems. 
Soon after the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake, many 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers, engineers, 
and students from all over Japan created a working group, 
called “ANPI_NLP.” “ANPI” means “safety” in Japanese. 
ANPI_NLP tried to collect tweets with hash tags, such as 
“#anpi (safety information)” or “#hinan (evacuation)”, and 
extracted information about the safety of people. [5] In this 
paper, we use the tweet corpus provided by ANPI_NLP, and 
extract transportation information and traffic problems from 
it. 
B. Extracting Transportation Information 
There have been a number of studies of extracting 
transportation information. Davidov [6] presented an 
algorithm framework that enabled automated acquisition of 
map-link information from the Web based on surface 
patterns such as “from X to Y.” Given a set of locations as 
initial seeds, they retrieved an extended set of locations from 
the Web and produced a map-link network that connected 
these locations using transport-type edges. In this paper, we 
propose a method for extraction of 
transportation 
information via machine-learning techniques. 
Ishino et al. [7] extracted traveler’s transportation 
information automatically from travel blog entries written in 
Japanese using machine-learning techniques. They used cues 
related to travel, such as “観光” (sightseeing tour) or “旅行” 
(travel) for machine learning. In this paper, we aim to extract 
transportation information from disaster victims. Therefore, 
we collect cues related to disasters for machine learning. 
IV. 
EXTRACTING TRANSPORTATION INFORMATION AND 
TRAFFIC PROBLEMS 
In this paper, we propose methods for extracting 
transportation information and traffic problems from tweets 
written in Japanese and posted during the Great Eastern 
Japan Earthquake. We explain our methods for extracting 
transportation information in Section IV-A, and for traffic 
problems in Sections IV-B and IV-C. 
A. Extracting Transportation Information 
In this section, we describe our method for extracting 
transportation information from tweets. We use machine 
learning to extract information, such as “a departure place”, 
“a destination”, or “a transportation method”, from tweets. 
First, we define the tags used in our examination. Fig. 3 is a 
tagged example. 
 
FROM tag includes a departure place. 
 
TO tag includes a destination. 
 
METHOD tag includes a transportation method.

Figure 3.  Examples of tagged tweets. 
We formulate the identification of the class of each word 
in a given sentence and solve it using machine learning. For 
the machine-learning method, we opted for the Conditional 
Random Fields (CRF) method [8]; its empirical success has 
been reported recently in natural language processing. The 
CRF-based method identifies the class of each entry. 
Features and tags are used in the CRF method as follows: (1) 
k tags occur before a target entry; (2) k features occur before 
a target entry; and (3) k features follow a target entry. We 
used the value k = 6, which was determined via a pilot study. 
We used the following 13 features for machine learning. A 
sequence of nouns (a noun phrase) was treated as a noun. We 
used MeCab [9] as a Japanese morphological analysis tool to 
identify the part of speech. 
 
 
A word. 
 
Its part of speech. 
 
Whether the word is a quotation mark. 
 
Whether the word is a cue phrase, as shown in 
Table I. 
B. Identifying Traffic Problem Tweets 
We proposed a method for extracting traffic problems 
from tweets posted during the Great Eastern Japan 
Earthquake. In a pilot study, we investigated the number of 
tweets containing traffic problem information (we call them 
traffic problem tweets) and found some examples. Therefore, 
this task is divided into two steps: (1) identifying traffic 
problem tweets from a tweet corpus; and (2) extracting 
traffic problems from the traffic problem tweets. We explain 
Step 1 in this section and Step 2 in Section IV-C. 
In this section, we explain our method for identification 
of traffic problem tweets automatically. Fig. 4 shows 
examples of traffic problem tweets. They contain words 
related to traffic problems, such as “通行止め” (closed to 
traffic) or “停止” (shut down), and the name of the relevant 
road. We employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) [10] as 
a machine-learning technique to identify traffic problem 
tweets.  We use the following features for machine learning.

C. Extracting Traffic Problems 
In this section, we explain our method for extracting 
traffic problems from traffic problem tweets identified in 
Section IV-B. We use machine learning to extract 
information such as “a road” or “a train line”, or “traffic 
problem section”, from tweets. First, we define the tags used 
in our examination. Fig. 5 is a tagged example. 
 


 
LOC tag includes a traffic problem section. 
 
We use CRF for the machine learning. Features and tags 
are used in the CRF method as follows: (1) k tags occur 
before a target entry, (2) k features occur before a target 
entry, and (3) k features follow a target entry. We used the 
value k = 6, which was determined via a pilot study. We use 
the following 14 features for machine learning. A sequence 
of nouns (a noun phrase) was treated as a noun. We used 
MeCab as a Japanese morphological analysis tool.

EXPERIMENTS 
A. Ectracting Transportation Information 
Data Sets and Experimental Settings 
We randomly selected 1303 tweets written in Japanese 
from the tweet corpus provided by ANPI_NLP, and tagged 
them manually, as described in Section IV-A. The numbers 
of manually assigned tags are shown in Table III. We used 
CRF++ [11] software as the machine-learning package. As a 
base line method, we used only a word as a feature for 
machine learning. We used precision and recall as evaluation 
measures, calculated as follows.

Figure 6.  Example of a failure in extracting  transportation information. 
First, we discuss a typical error causing low precision. 
Fig. 6 shows an example of a failure in extracting 
transportation information. The TO tag was mistakenly 
assigned to “助 川 小 学 校” (Sukegawa Elementary School), 
which might not be an actual evacuation site. This was 
because the “ TO ”  cue “ 避 難 ” (evacuate) appears 
immediately before it. To improve the performance of 
extracting transportation information, we should consider 
language structure. 
Next, we discuss a typical error causing low recall. A 
typical error is the lack of cues. In particular, we could not 
collect the names of some facilities or places cyclopedically. 
When preparing for a disaster, we must collect the names of 
facilities and places all over the world. 
B. Identifying Traffic Problem Tweets 
Data Sets and Experimental Settings 
For our examination, we identified traffic problem tweets 
among 1750 tweets written in Japanese provided by 
ANPI_NLP. The number of manually identified traffic 
problem tweets is shown in Table V. We performed a four-
fold cross validation test. We used a standard SVM package, 
TinySVM (http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySVM/). We 
used precision and recall as evaluation measures.

Results and Discussion 
Table VI shows the experimental results. Our method 
obtained a higher recall than baseline method. We now 
discuss the low recall of our method. A typical reason for 
low recall is the lack of cues. For machine learning, we used 
manually selected cues, as described in Section IV-B. To 
improve the coverage of cues, a statistical approach, such as 
applying n-gram statistics to a larger tweet corpus, will be 
required.

Results and Discussion 
The evaluation results are shown in Table VIII. Our

We now discuss the low recall of our method. Errors in 
our method have been found in tweets that contain both 
problem information and safety information about traffic 
states. Fig. 7 shows an example of failure in the extracting 
traffic problems. In the example, the “LINE” tag should be 
assigned to “県内高速道路” (expressway in the prefecture), 
but our method did not assign any tags to this word. This 
tweet contains the cue “通行止め” (closed to traffic), and 
the cue “通行可能” (can pass). In this case, we should 
consider language modification relationships of cues.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
To offer evacuation routes to safety for disaster victims, 
we have proposed methods for extracting transportation 
information and traffic problems from tweets posted during 
disasters. To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, we 
conducted some experiments using tweets posted during the 
Great Eastern Japan Earthquake. From the experimental 
results, we obtained precision of 78.2% and recall of 53.4% 
in automatic extraction of transportation information. For 
extracting traffic problems, we identified tweets containing 
information about traffic problems (we called them traffic 
problem tweets), and extracted traffic problems from them. 
In identifying traffic problem tweets, we obtained precision 
of 77.7% and recall of 70.7%. In extracting traffic problems, 
we obtained precision of 87.0% and recall of 57.1%. Thus, 
we have constructed a system for providing transportation 
information and identifying traffic problems in disasters. We 
consider that the system can offer evacuation routes for 
disaster victims and transportation routes for relief materiel. 
In this paper, we used tweets that posted during the Great 
Eastern Japan Earthquake. Therefore, we used the names of 
facilities or places in eastern Japan as cues for machine 
learning. When preparing for disasters anywhere, we must 
collect the names of a facilities or places all over the world. 
In this paper, we focused on tweets written in Japanese. 
In our future work, we will translate cue phrases from 
Japanese into other languages, and apply our method to 
tweets written in various languages.
