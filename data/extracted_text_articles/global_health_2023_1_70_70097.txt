Abstract—In recent years, personalized wellness has attracted
significant attention by many research groups. However, distin-
guishing between various groups associated with different health
conditions, which is critical to achieve personalized healthcare,
remains a complex challenge. The driving force behind this study
is to harness the potential of biomedical networks to reveal
homogenous groups with a high degree of similarity. Our primary
goal is to uncover hidden relationships that may not be evident
using traditional data analysis by discerning interaction patterns
and similarities between nodes in the network. To construct a
biomedical graph, we integrated mobility data and medical data,
mainly Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data, for each subject,
representing them as nodes. The edges between nodes reflect the
similarity between subjects in both mobility patterns and HRV
responses. Leveraging advanced network analysis techniques, we
applied an appropriate network features to identify strongly
connected homogenous groups within the graph. These groups
represent subsets of subjects displaying highly similar mobility
characteristics and HRV patterns. Our analysis identified five
highly similar groups within the biomedical network based on the
subjects mobility and HRV data. Remarkably, mobility features
played a more pronounced role in the formation of these groups
compared to HRV data, suggesting strong ties and similarities in
mobility characteristics. These findings significantly contribute to
our understanding of the interplay between movement behaviors,
offering promising avenues for personalized interventions and
enhanced clinical decision-making in the pursuit of advanced
healthcare and improved well-being.

I. INTRODUCTION
Understanding homogeneous groups within biological net-
works is essential for advancing personalized therapies, de-
signing targeted interventions, and developing individualized
medicine [1] [2]. These homogeneous groups represent subsets
of interconnected individuals or elements within a network
who share similar characteristics, behaviors, or functional
relationships [3] [4]. In other words, they are said to be
cohesive in nature within the biomedical network. By ana-
lyzing the structure and dynamics of these groups, we can
gain valuable insights into the complex systems of biological
networks, uncover hidden patterns, and identify key factors
driving their formation and functioning [5]. Cohesive groups
play a pivotal role in personalized medicine and healthcare [6].
They offer a means to stratify patients into subgroups based
on shared characteristics, enabling the development of tailored
treatments that address the specific needs and responses of
individuals within each group. Moreover, homogeneous groups
can provide insights into disease subtypes, treatment response
prediction, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets
[6].
This study incorporates data from two modalities: mobility
data collected from physical activity and medical data col-
lected from HRV. These modalities are utilized to construct
the biomedical network. Mobility data, including step counts,
distance traveled, and activity patterns, offer insights into
individuals’ daily routines, physical activity levels, and overall
mobility behaviors [7] [8]. HRV data, on the other hand,
captures the variability in the time intervals between succes-
sive heartbeats, reflecting autonomic nervous system activity,
physiological stress, and overall cardiovascular health [9]. The
integration of mobility and HRV data allows for a comprehen-
sive assessment of individuals’ behavioral and physiological
characteristics within homogeneous groups. By considering
both modalities, we can gain a deeper understanding of the
interplay between physical activity, physiological responses,
and health outcomes. This holistic approach facilitates the
identification of homogeneous groups that share not only
mobility patterns but also physiological similarities, enhancing
our ability to personalize interventions and treatments [10].
In this study, our primary objectives are three-fold. Firstly,
we aim to construct a network representation that integrates
mobility and HRV data. Secondly, we seek to apply an
appropriate network threshold that defines the strength of
connections within the graph. By adjusting the threshold,
we can identify strongly connected homogeneous groups that
exhibit distinct patterns and interrelationships. Lastly, we aim
to analyze the mobility patterns and HRV characteristics
within these groups. The rest of the document is organized as
follows. Section II presents the detailed methodology while
Section III contains the obtained results. Discussion of the

the limitations and future work of the study.
II. METHOD
A. Overview
Our study follows a five-step approach, as shown in Figure
1, to identify homogeneous groups in a biomedical network
based on mobility and HRV data. We acquired multimodal data
for the subjects, performed data preprocessing to clean and
prepare the data, and extracted relevant features. Using these
features, we constructed the network, representing subjects
as nodes with edges reflecting their similarities. By apply-
ing a network threshold, we identified homogeneous groups,
revealing strong ties based on mobility characteristics. The
analysis emphasized the influential role of mobility features
in the formation of homogeneous groups, providing valuable
insights for personalized healthcare interventions.
B. Data Acquisition
The dataset utilized in this study is the HYPERAKTIV
dataset, which is publicly available and can be accessed
from a public repository [11]. The dataset comprises mo-
bility data collected using wearable sensors, comprehensive
diagnostic assessments, and demographic characteristics. It
consists of two primary categories: individuals with Attention-
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and individuals with-
out ADHD. But most of them were also diagnosed with other
psychiatric disorders such as ADD (Attention Deficit Dis-
order), unipolar depression, bipolar depression, and anxiety.
However, the assessment of these psychiatric disorders was
made using self-reported feedback. Furthermore, the dataset
includes a total of 85 patients, with 45 diagnosed with ADHD
and 40 were diagnosed with other disorders in addition to
ADHD. The mobility data in the dataset is captured through
a wrist-worn actigraph device (Actiwatch), with a sampling
frequency of 32 Hz. The motor activity data includes measure-
ments of movement intensity in the x, y, and z-axes. In addition
to the activity data, the dataset also contains HRV data. HRV
data is ECG-based and recorded using a small chest-worn
battery-driven device Actiheart (Cambridge Neurotechnology
Ltd, England), allowing free movement and long recordings.
C. Preprocessing and Feature Extraction
The collected mobility data from the Actiwatch device
was processed and organized into individual files for each
participant. Each file contained raw activity measurements
recorded over a span of 6 days for the ADHD group and
7 days for the non-ADHD group. However, for consistency,
we considered 6 days of mobility data for all participants.
The combined mobility data files were carefully examined for
missing values or anomalies, and appropriate techniques were
employed to handle them effectively. To gain insights into the
participants’ motor activity patterns, two types of features were
extracted: hour-wise features and day-wise features. These
features provide valuable information about the characteristics
and variations in motor activity over different time intervals.
The hour-wise features reveal intra-daily variations, capturing
details such as activity levels during specific hours, peak
activity hours, and temporal variability. On the other hand,
the day-wise features capture longer-term patterns, trends, and
summary statistics of activity levels over the 6-day duration.
In addition to features extracted from mobility data, we
have also extracted time domain features from HRV data
such as mean and median. Table 3 summarizes the list of
features extracted, including mobility and HRV features. This
comprehensive set of features offers a detailed representation
of the participants’ activity patterns at various temporal scales.
They serve as a foundation for analyzing mobility patterns,
exploring relationships with demographic parameters, and in-
vestigating associations with diagnostic assessment outcomes.
The extracted hour-wise and day-wise features provide a
robust and comprehensive representation of the participants’
activity patterns, enabling in-depth analyses of their mobility
behaviors.
D. Network Generation
In our study, the generation of the correlation network in-
volves a series of steps to establish relationships and intercon-
nections between the participants based on their mobility data.
To achieve this, we employ a population analysis approach,
without relying on supervised label information, to identify
groups of persons with similar motor activity profiles. First,
we denote all 55 participants as nodes in the correlation graph,
representing each subject within the network. The objective is
to connect two participants with an edge if they possess a
similar motor activity profile. The similarity between subjects
is quantified using the 48 hour-wise features extracted during
the feature extraction phase. Specifically, we compute the pair-
wise Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) between each pair of
participants, which measures the linear dependence between
them [12] [13].
To construct the correlation graph, we utilize the computed
ρ values to create a correlation matrix that captures the degree
of similarity between all pairs of users. The ρ value ranges
from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a negative correlation
and +1 represents a strong positive correlation [14] [15].
Subsequently, we introduce a predefined threshold, denoted
as ’k,’ to identify strongly correlated pairs, thus forming a
significance matrix. The significance matrix takes a value of
1 if the (ρ value between a pair of users is greater than or
equal to the threshold ’k’; otherwise, it takes a value of 0.
The significance matrix serves as the adjacency matrix for the

correlation graph. In this graph, two participants (Pi, Pj) are
connected by an edge if their correlation coefficient exceeds
or equals ’k.’ This process creates a network of strongly
interconnected nodes, representing the relationships between
participants based on their motor activity.
To uncover the hidden clusters or communities within the
correlation graph, we apply the Louvain Clustering technique,
a popular unsupervised clustering algorithm suitable for ex-
tracting clusters in biological networks [16]. The Louvain
algorithm employs a random walk property to categorize nodes
into different communities. These clusters represent groups of
persons with similar motor activity profiles. The clustering
process ensures that each community demonstrates homo-
geneity, with participants within the same cluster showing
similar motor activity characteristics. Additionally, the clusters
exhibit separation, meaning that persons in different commu-
nities exhibit distinct mobility profiles [17]. In summary, the
generation of the correlation network involves computing the
pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients between subjects’
motor activity data, setting a threshold ’k’ to identify sig-
nificant correlations, and constructing the correlation graph
based on the adjacency matrix. The application of the Louvain
algorithm reveals the hidden clusters representing groups of
individuals with similar motor activity profiles. The resulting
network provides valuable insights into the relationships and
homogeneous patterns among subjects based on their mobility
data.
E. Detection and Analysis of Homogeneous Groups
Following the generation of the correlation network, the next
step is to identify homogeneous groups within the network
and analyze their mobility and HRV data. To achieve this, we
perform a two-step process: first, determining a correlation
threshold that results in the complete disintegration of the
network, and second, tweaking the network threshold to create
sub-networks with cohesive connections. We initially explore
the correlation threshold at which the network becomes en-
tirely disconnected. This threshold serves as an upper limit for
the subsequent network threshold adjustments. By carefully se-
lecting a value below this disintegration threshold, we create a
sub-network in which participants retain cohesive connections,
thus ensuring the identification of meaningful homogeneous
groups. Next, we employ the Louvain clustering algorithm
on the sub-network to detect homogeneous groups of inter-
connected nodes. The Louvain algorithm is an efficient and
widely used community detection method that optimizes the
modularity of the network, effectively partitioning nodes into
non-overlapping communities based on their interconnections.
Once the homogeneous groups are identified, we proceed to
analyze the mobility and HRV data for each group separately.
This analysis involves examining the mobility characteristics,
such as average steps taken, distance traveled, and activity
patterns, as well as HRV metrics, including time domain,
frequency domain, and non-linear features, extracted during
the feature extraction phase. Comparing the mobility and HRV
data within each homogeneous group allows us to gain insights
into their shared characteristics and behavior patterns. By
understanding how these groups differ in their motor activity
and physiological responses, we can uncover unique features
that may distinguish them from other groups and potentially
indicate underlying health conditions or specific behavioral
traits. Furthermore, we investigate whether there are significant
correlations or associations between mobility and HRV data
within each homogeneous group. Such correlations could offer
valuable information on how motor activity influences auto-
nomic nervous system activity and vice versa, contributing to
a deeper understanding of the interplay between physiological
and behavioral aspects.
III. RESULTS
After preprocessing the initial dataset of 85 subjects, 33
subjects were excluded due to insufficient clinical and mobility
data, leaving a final dataset of 52 subjects for analysis. To
construct a meaningful network, we selected a correlation
threshold of 0.5, resulting in a network with a reasonable
level of connectivity among the subjects. However, when the
threshold was increased to 0.82, the network disintegrated
completely. At the initial threshold of 0.5, all subjects were
connected in the network, forming the first network as shown
in Figure 2(a). Subsequently, we chose a threshold of 0.8, just
before the network disintegrated, to create a second network
as shown in Figure 2(b). The hypothesis was that the groups
identified at this resolution would represent strongly connected
groups compared to other nodes. These groups demonstrated
resilience even at the maximum threshold resolution, indi-
cating significantly stronger connectivity compared to other
nodes. In contrast, other nodes appeared to be either loosely or
moderately connected. The groups that proved to be strongly
connected at the 0.8 network resolution were identified as
homogeneous groups. Their robust interconnections suggested
shared behavior and characteristics within these groups, mak-
ing them distinguishable from other nodes. These homoge-
neous groups are of particular interest as they potentially

(b). Homogeneous Groups
Fig. 2. Identification of homogenous groups
represent distinct subpopulations with unique mobility patterns
and HRV responses. Analyzing the mobility patterns and
HRV data within each homogeneous group revealed rich and
vital information. These insights offer valuable opportunities
for designing personalized interventions and tailoring health-
care strategies based on the distinct characteristics exhibited
by each homogeneous group. Understanding the interplay
between mobility and HRV data within these groups can
lead to targeted and effective approaches to improving health
outcomes and well-being for individuals within each group.
The results of our analysis shed light on the mobility
patterns observed within the five homogeneous communities
or clusters, represented in Figure 3(a) to Figure 3(e), at an
hourly granularity level. Additionally, the HRV patterns are
illustrated in Figure 3(f). These homogeneous communities
are formed based on various factors, including hourly mobility
patterns, sleep and wakeup patterns, average mobility accel-
eration (in m/s2), and overall day-wise mobility acceleration
(in m/s2). Analyzing the hour-wise mobility patterns within
each homogeneous community reveals distinct sleep, wakeup,
and daily routine characteristics. Each community exhibits
unique patterns in their sleep schedules. For instance, subjects
in community 1 maintain a consistent sleep routine between
midnight and 5 am, while community 3 displays a consistent
sleep pattern from midnight to 6 am. On the other hand,
community 5 follows a sleep routine from 2 am to 7 am,
and community 4’s sleep routine is observed between 1 am
and 6 am. These variations in sleep patterns contribute to the
formation of distinct homogeneous groups within the network.
Furthermore, the wakeup and day start routines also exhibit
noticeable differences among the communities. As individuals
wake up, there is a marked increase in their mobility levels. In
community 1, there is a significant rise in mobility between 5
am and 7 am, while community 4 shows an increase between
7 am and 9 am. Community 3 exhibits an upsurge in mobility
between 6 am and 8 am, and community 5 demonstrates a
slightly delayed wakeup schedule between 9 am and 12 pm.
These distinct patterns in wakeup times further differentiate
the homogeneous communities, highlighting the importance of
considering individual sleep and morning routine behaviors.
During daytime hours, most of the communities engage in
relatively active mobility activities, with little variation in
their average mobility acceleration, except for community 2.
Community 1 stands out with the highest average acceleration
compared to the other groups, indicating a more intense level
of mobility. On the other hand, communities 3 and 5 exhibit
slightly lower average mobility acceleration, suggesting a
comparatively less intense but still active level of mobility.
Interestingly, community 2 demonstrates the lowest mobility
acceleration among the groups, accompanied by abnormal
mobility patterns. This finding indicates the presence of unique
and potentially abnormal mobility characteristics within com-
munity 2, which warrants further attention and validation.
In terms of HRV patterns, the total average heart rate shows
no significant difference among the subjects, but there is
noticeable variation in the maximum heart rate measured over
the total data collection period. Specifically, subjects ID47 and
ID52 demonstrate significantly lower HRV compared to other
individuals within the homogeneous groups. However, it is
observed that mobility patterns exert a stronger influence in
the formation of communities compared to HRV patterns.
In conclusion, our analysis of the mobility patterns within
the five homogeneous communities reveals distinctive sleep,
wakeup, and daily routine characteristics among the subjects.
The variations in these patterns contribute to the formation of
homogeneous groups, highlighting the relevance of individual
sleep behaviors and daytime mobility activities. Additionally,
the identification of abnormal mobility patterns within com-
munity 2 underscores the importance of considering such
anomalous behaviors for further investigation and validation.
These findings provide valuable insights into the mobility
behaviors and daily routines within each community, facili-
tating the design of personalized interventions and healthcare
strategies tailored to the specific characteristics exhibited by

these homogeneous groups.
IV. DISCUSSION
Identifying homogeneous groups within biological networks
is a critical task with significant implications for developing
personalized therapies and individualized medicines. In many
cases, universal medications and group therapies do not pro-
vide optimal results for all individuals. Therefore, the devel-
opment of personalized and targeted interventions is essential.
The fundamental objective of identifying homogeneous groups
in biological networks is to enable the customization of treat-
ments and interventions based on the unique characteristics
of each group. Each homogeneous group identified in our
analysis exhibits two important characteristics: homogeneity
within the group and distinctiveness from other homogeneous
groups. This means that individuals within a homogeneous
group share similar patterns and behaviors, while also differing
significantly from individuals in other groups. Understanding
these distinctions allows for the design of interventions that
specifically cater to the needs and characteristics of each
group.
A unique aspect of our methodology is that it does not
rely on the inclusion of class labels to detect homogeneous
groups. This data-driven approach eliminates the need for
manual human annotation of class labels, saving considerable
time and effort during the data collection process. By solely
relying on the data itself, our methodology efficiently identifies
homogeneous groups based on the inherent patterns and rela-
tionships within the data. This data-driven approach enhances
the objectivity and accuracy of the analysis. Additionally, our
methodology has the potential to identify subject groups with
abnormal or peculiar mobility and HRV patterns. An example
of such an abnormal group is community 2, where individuals
exhibit minimal and abnormal mobility patterns throughout the
day. The identification of such abnormal groups is crucial as it
can highlight individuals who may require specific attention,
interventions, or further investigation due to their unique
characteristics. By recognizing these abnormalities, healthcare
professionals can tailor interventions to address the specific
needs of these individuals, potentially improving their health
outcomes.
V. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
There are several limitations to be acknowledged in our
study. First, the sample size of our dataset was relatively
small, consisting of only 52 subjects. This limited sample
42

GLOBAL HEALTH 2023 : The Twelfth International Conference on Global Health Challenges

size may impact the generalizability of our findings and
limit the scope of interpretations. A larger and more diverse
dataset would provide a more comprehensive understanding
of homogeneous groups and their mobility patterns within the
biomedical network. Another limitation arises from the selec-
tion of the correlation threshold. The choice of threshold can
introduce bias into the analysis, as it determines the strength
of connections within the network. Different thresholds may
yield different results, and selecting the optimal threshold
is subjective. Future studies should explore robust methods
to determine an appropriate threshold or consider alternative
approaches that are less dependent on this parameter.
To overcome the limitations mentioned above, future work
should focus on expanding the dataset to include a larger num-
ber of subjects. A more extensive and diverse sample would
enhance the representativeness and generalizability of the
findings. Additionally, incorporating longitudinal data would
provide insights into the temporal dynamics of homogeneous
groups and their mobility patterns over time. Furthermore,
it would be valuable to integrate clinical parameters and
additional biomarkers into the analysis. Including clinical
data, such as medical history, comorbidities, and medication
usage, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of
the factors influencing the formation of homogeneous groups.
The incorporation of other biomarkers, such as genetic infor-
mation or biochemical markers, could offer deeper insights
into the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms
related to mobility patterns. Moreover, future research could
explore advanced network analysis techniques to gain a more
nuanced understanding of the relationships within the biomed-
ical network. For example, community detection algorithms
beyond the Louvain clustering algorithm could be employed to
uncover finer-grained subgroups within homogeneous groups.
Additionally, considering the dynamic nature of the data,
time-evolving network analysis methods could be employed
to capture changes and transitions in homogeneous group
formations over time.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this study, we developed a graph model to take advantage
of mobility data and medical data to identify groups with
potential similar properties. Our approach focused on the
identification of homogeneous groups within a biomedical
network using multi-modal data. By constructing a correlation
network, we identified homogeneous groups that exhibited
strong interconnections based on their mobility patterns. The
analysis revealed distinct patterns and characteristics within
these homogeneous groups, providing valuable insights for
personalized therapies and individualized interventions. Fur-
thermore, the analysis of hour-wise mobility patterns high-
lighted unique sleep, wake-up, and daily routine character-
istics within each group. Additionally, the examination of
average mobility acceleration revealed variations among the
homogeneous groups, with some demonstrating higher or
lower levels of mobility. The data-driven approach used in
our methodology eliminated the need for manual class label
annotations, enhancing the efficiency and objectivity of the
analysis. Moreover, the identification of subjects that didn’t
belong to any of highly similar groups emphasized the po-
tential of our methodology to detect individuals with different
mobility characteristics, warranting further investigation and
personalized attention. For future directions, we plan to expand
our analysis by incorporating additional clinical parameters
and other medical information for each individual in the study.
