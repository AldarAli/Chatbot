Abstract—In our current society, data has gone from scarce to
superabundant: huge volumes of data are being generated every
second. A big part of this ﬂow is due to social media platforms,
which provide a very volatile ﬂow of information. However,
leveraging this information, which is burried in this fast stream
of messages, poses a serious challenge. A vast amount of work
is devoted to tackle this challenge in different business areas. In
our work, we address this challenge for the horticulture sector,
which has not received a lot of attention in the literature. Our
aim is to extract information from the social data ﬂow that can
empower the horticulture sector. In this paper, we present our
ﬁrst steps towards this goal and demonstrate key examples of
this empowerment.
Keywords–Twitter; horticulture; social media analytics.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there have been a lot of overwhelming
changes in how people communicate and interact with each
other, mostly due to social media. It has revolutionized the
Internet into a more personal and participatory medium. Con-
sequently, social networking is now the top online activity on
the Internet. With this much subscriptions to social media,
massive amounts of information, accumulating as a result of in-
teractions, discussions, social signals, and other engagements,
form a valuable source of information. Social media analytics
is able to leverage this information.
Social media analytics is the process of tracking conver-
sations around speciﬁc phrases, words or brands. Through
tracking, one can leverage these conversations to discover
opportunities or to create content for those audiences. It is
more than only monitoring mentions and comments through
social proﬁles, mobile apps or blogs. It requires advanced
analytics that can detect patterns, track sentiment, and draw
conclusions based on where and when conversations happen.
Doing this is important for many business areas since actively
listening to customers avoids missing out on the opportunity
to collect valuable feedback to understand, react, and provide
value to customers.
The retail sector is probably the business area that utilizes
social media analytics the most. More than 60% of marketeers
use social media tools for campaign tracking, brand analysis,
and for competitive intelligence [1]. Moreover, they also use
tools for customer care, product launches, and inﬂuencer
ranking. Social media analytics is also heavily used in news
and journalism for building and engaging a news audience, and
measuring those efforts through data collection and analysis.
A similar use is also adopted in sports to actively engage with
fans. In many business areas one also uses analytics for event
detection and user proﬁling. A vast amount of work is devoted
to tackle the challenges in the mentioned business areas. In our
work, we address this challenge for the horticulture sector,
which has not received a lot of attention in the literature.
The horticulture industry is a traditional sector in which
growers are focused on production, and in which many traders
use their own transactions as the main source of information.
This leads to reactive management with very little anticipa-
tion to events in the future. Growers and traders lack data
about consumer trends and how the products are used and
appreciated. This setting provides opportunities to enhance the
market orientation of the horticulture industry, e.g., through
the use of social media. Data on consumer’s appreciation
and applications of products are abundant on social media.
Furthermore, grower’s communication on social media might
indicate future supply. This creates a need for analytic methods
to analyze social media data and to interpret them.
In this paper, we present our ﬁrst steps towards this goal
and demonstrate key examples of this empowerment. We start
with discussing related research in Section II. In Section III,
we describe our dataset that we used in the analysis. Next, we
present the results of our data analysis in Section IV. Finally,
we conclude the paper in Section V with some discussion and
future work.

RELATED RESEARCH
Many studies have focused on detecting trends and/or
events using data obtained from Twitter, examples are building
a prediction system for the number of hit-and-runs [2], or
detecting locations of earthquakes [3], or detecting ﬂu spreads
and activity [4], [5]. Currently, researchers have extended their
scope to a wide range of ﬁelds where these methods are being
applied.
An example of such a ﬁeld is journalism. In one of the ﬁrst
descriptive works analyzing the network and content of Twitter,
Kwak et al. [6] found that it is mainly used for News (85%
of the content). This lead to further analysis of the spread of
news in Twitter. For instance, [7] studies the diffusion of news
items in Twitter for several well-known news media and ﬁnds
that these cascades follow a star-like structure. Furthermore,
[8] studies the life cycle of news articles posted online and
describes the interplay between website visit patterns and
social media reactions to news content. Through this, the
75

DATA ANALYTICS 2016 : The Fifth International Conference on Data Analytics

authors show that this hybrid observation method can be used
to characterize distinct classes of articles and ﬁnd that the
overall trafﬁc that the articles will receive can be modeled
accurately. Also, [9] focuses on Twitter as a medium to help
journalists and news editors rapidly detect follow-up stories
to the articles they publish and they propose to do so by
leveraging transient news crowds, which are loosely-coupled
groups that appear in Twitter around a particular news item,
and where transient here reﬂects the ﬂeeting nature of news.
Another active ﬁeld of study where Twitter is used is in the
sports industry. For instance, [10] examines the effectiveness of
using a ﬁltered stream of tweets from Twitter to automatically
identify events of interest within the video of live sports
transmissions. They show that using just the volume of tweets
generated at any moment of a game actually provides a very
accurate means of event detection, as well as an automatic
method for tagging events with representative words from
the twitter stream. Also, [11] investigates to what extent we
can accurately extract sports data from tweets talking about
soccer matches and show that the aggregation of tweets is a
promising resource for extracting game summaries. Building
on the knowledge of these previous works, [12] describes an
algorithm that generates a journalistic summary of an event
using only status updates from Twitter as a source. Finally,
[13] uses sentiment analysis on tweets of players and other
data to model performance of NBA players.
A last example of a sector where Twitter data can be used
is the retail industry. For instance, [14] analyzes the perceived
beneﬁts of social media monitoring (SMM) and ﬁnds that
SMM enables industrial companies to improve their marketing
communication measurement ability. Also, [15] develops a
framework for leveraging social media information for busi-
nesses, which focuses on sentiment benchmarks. Furthermore,
[16] analyzes the use of social media by destination marketing
organizations and ﬁnds that they are exploring several ways to
leverage social media. Finally, [17] discusses the setup and the
key techniques in social media analytics and gives an overview
of the possibilities for the industry.
In this work, we use Twitter to empower the horticulture
industry by analyzing topic-relevant tweets.
III.
DATASET
In this section, we describe how we obtained the tweets that
we use in our analysis. These tweets are scraped using the ﬁlter
stream of the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API)
[18]. We use two streams (called “Netherlands (NL) general”
and “NL speciﬁc”), which are set up with the goal to scrape
as many Dutch tweets as possible.
In the “NL general” stream, we use ﬁlter stream with the
option track, where a list of words must be deﬁned. All tweets
containing one of these words are caught. We deﬁne a list
of general Dutch words (e.g., ‘een, het, ik, niet, maar, heb,
jij, nog, bij’, which translates to ‘a, the, I, not, but, have,
you, still, with’). In total, this list consists of 130 words.
Then, “NL speciﬁc” uses the ﬁlter stream combining track and
follow. For this option, we add a list of user IDs for which all
tweets are caught. For this list, we include local news outlets
and other news-heavy Twitter accounts, such as neighborhood
police accounts. In total, we deﬁne a list of 1,303 users.
Examples of accounts are @NUnl,@TilburginBeeld. The list of
terms consists of 395 entries (e.g., ‘brandweer, politie, gewond,
ambulance’ which translates to ‘ﬁre brigade, police, injured,
ambulance’). Note that any caught tweet may be contained in
multiple streams, we have not distinguished duplicates in our
dataset.
Since we do not have access to the Twitter Firehose, we do
not receive all tweets that we request due to rate limitations by
Twitter [19]. To give an insight in the volume of tweets that we
analyze, we display the total number of tweets that we received
on a monthly scale in Table I, which shows that the number
of tweets we receive per month is steady throughout the year.
All months contain at least 30 million tweets that contains the
keywords we used. Using such a large tweet dataset allows us
to do studies into less popular topics, without a large loss of
accuracy.

For the real-time analysis of Twitter-information, we set
up our own Twitter scraper using the Twitter API. Here, we
used a list of product names, provided by our partners from
GroentenFruitHuis and Floricode, to locate possibly interesting
tweets. Again, we tailored these lists to acquire Dutch tweets
and used to language ﬁlter provided by the Twitter API to
ensure that all received tweets are indeed Dutch. The terms are
split up into two lists, one containing fruits and vegetables, e.g.,
apple, orange, and mango, and the other containing ﬂowers and
plants, e.g., tulip, rose, and lily.
IV.
DATA STUDIES
After retrieving the tweets, the ﬁrst step towards empower-
ing the sector is knowing what kind of information can be
retrieved from the social feed. To investigate this, we per-
formed several studies, for which we present the results below.
These studies range from an analysis of what is discussed at
the current time in Twitter, to a study into the frequency of
postings with regards to particular products, to an analysis of
the online footprint caused by real-life events.
A. GfK time series
For this analysis, we have used the year long data of Twitter
messages from August 2014 to August 2015 and counted the
number of occurrences of fruit products mentioned in the text
of the tweets. From these mentions, we construct a weekly time
series reﬂecting the number of mentions. Then, we compared
these numbers to sales numbers of the most occurring product

type of these products. Thus, we compared the number of
Dutch tweets mentioning ‘pears’ or ‘pear’ to the number
of Conference pears that are sold in the same time-frame.
Similarly, we compared the number of tweets mentioning
‘apple’ or ‘apples’ to the number of Elstar apples that are
sold. In Figure 2, we present these time series, normalized on
the maximum value in the series. In this ﬁgure, we see that
in both cases the time series for the tweets and the sales are
comparable. Using an eight-hour shift for the sales time series,
we ﬁnd a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of 0.44 for the apples
series and a coefﬁcient of 0.46 for the pears series.

These results indicate that it could be possible to predict
the sales of a product type eight weeks in advance, however,
this will need to be conﬁrmed using other product types.
B. Tulip day
As a kick-off of the tulip season, which indicates the period
in which a large variety of tulips is available at the vendors,
the Dutch tulip growers organize the so-called Tulip day in
Amsterdam. During this day, growers place a ﬁeld of a large
range of different tulips on the Dam in Amsterdam. During
a few hours in the afternoon, visitors are allowed to pick the
tulips in this ﬁeld. For this event, we analyzed the presence
on Twitter over a few years. For 2014, 2015, and 2016, we
counted the occurrences of the tags ‘tulip’, ‘tulips’, and ‘tulip
day’, both during the event and the two days after the event.
The results of this study are presented in Figure 1. Here,
we clearly see an increase in the number of mentions of the
Tulip day on Twitter, this increase in mentions coincides with
an intensiﬁed campaign by the growers and the governing
body to broaden the attention to the Tulip day event. This
analysis shows that the impact of the effort by marketing can
be measured through Twitter analysis.
C. Top 10 rankings
The studies we discussed so far are based on a static
collection of tweets. Another approach to extract value from
Twitter is to see what a continuous feed of messages contains.
To better understand how the products we are interested in
are discussed on Twitter on a real-time basis, we set up two
lexicons as described at the end of Section III. Using these
lexicons, we scan Twitter in real-time for tweets that match
these products. Using the tweets we receive this way, we
can analyze what is currently discussed about these products.
As a ﬁrst step, we visualize this information in a top-10
application. The main page of this application shows the top
10 most discussed products on Twitter in the last day for both
fruits/vegetables and plants/ﬂowers, of which an example is
shown in Figure 3. By clicking on one of the products in these
top lists, we are redirected to a page, shown in Figure 4 for
bananas, which shows us both the current messages mentioning
the product and a detailed analysis of these messages, e.g., in
terms of the most occurring tokens and a time series in which
the terms are mentioned.
D. Story detection
The real-time data is also used for the detection of stories
and discussions that suddenly pop-up. We do this by clustering
incoming tweets by their tokens, using the Jaccard index. For
sets A and B, this index equals
J(A, B) = |A ∩ B|
|A ∪ B|.
If two tweets are more similar than a predeﬁned threshold,
which we set at 0.4, then these two tweets will be represented
by the same cluster. Therefore, if a topic is actively discussed
on Twitter, it will be represented as a cluster in our story
detection. Since these clusters are renewed every hour we add

the notion of stories, which clusters the clusters over time.
By doing this, we can also track which clusters are prevalent
for a longer period of time and therefore will be very likely
to be of value for the industry. A current implementation of
this method has been successfully implemented for the news
reporting industry. This system can be found at [20].

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we describe our ﬁrst steps towards empower-
ing the horticulture industry by analyzing topic-relevant tweets
in Twitter. During our ﬁrst exploration of the Twitter data, we
encountered some interesting results. For instance, we found
that there could be predictive power in the number of times a
speciﬁc product is mentioned on Twitter for the future sales
numbers of that particular product. Furthermore, we developed
methods to visualize the current industry speciﬁc content in
real-time and ﬁlter out interesting information in the process.
These ideas can be fruitfully adopted in marketing ana-
lytics to directly measure the impact of marketing activities.
Furhermore more, Section IV-A yields promising result in the
production planning. These ﬁrst results provide a good basis
for further study.
