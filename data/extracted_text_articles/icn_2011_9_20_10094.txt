Abstract— Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are new tech-
nologies that offer many opportunities to wide range interesting
services. Safe driving applications in Intelligent Transport System
(ITS) are major applications of VANETs. In the high-speed
mobility environment of VANETs, failure transmission due to
change of vehicle positions, ﬂuctuation of channel condition and
blocking by large vehicles may decrease reachability of vehicle
information messages for safety usage. In this paper, we focus on
an OFDM transmission technology, which is employed in IEEE
802.11p for ITS networks. In the proposed scheme, some vehicles
forward a same OFDM signal at almost same instance, which
is less than a guard interval period. Therefore, vehicles can
demodulate some same OFDM signals from different vehicles,
and can obtain path diversity effect through some different
vehicles. This paper also proposes a new media access control
scheme to achieve the proposed transmission technology. The
proposed media access control scheme is based on carrier sense
multiple access (CSMA). Meanwhile, some forwarder vehicles
can select the same random back-off period autonomously to
synchronize transmission timing. As the results, the proposed
scheme can achieve the high delivery ratio of vehicle infor-
mation messages and reduce transmission delay. Finally, we
consider vehicle movements, channel ﬂuctuation due to fading
and blocking due to large-size vehicle in computer simulations.
The numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve
the high delivery ratio with the short delay even if actually real
environment, which considers fast movement, blocking, fading,
is evaluated in the simulations. Moreover, we clarify that our
scheme has high scalability in case of increasing of vehicles.

I. INTRODUCTION
Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have been focused
recently for building Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
[1], [2]. In VANETs, many vehicles construct a temporal net-
work autonomously to communicate each other. VANETs have
special attributes that differentiate it from the other types of
networks such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) [3], [4],
[5]. Especially, the mobility patterns of vehicles in VANETs
are more restrictive due to road structures. Therefore, almost
all vehicles can only communicate with front and backward
vehicles. In the conventional works, many routing protocols
have been proposed to achieve effective data dissemination.
These protocols are classiﬁed into some categories such as
pure ad-hoc routing, position-based routing, and broadcast
routing.
In MANETs, several routing protocols have been proposed
and are still applicable for VANETs. Ad-hoc On-demand
Distance Vector (AODV) [6] and Dynamic Source Routing
(DSR) [7] are well-known routing protocols for general pur-
pose mobile ad-hoc networks. Meanwhile, VANETs differ
from MANETs by their dynamic change of network topology.
In conventional studies, most pure ad-hoc routing protocols
suffer from highly dynamic nature of vehicle mobility and
tend to have low communication throughput due to poor route
management performance [8].
Position-based routing employs routing strategies that use
geographical information obtained from on-board navigation
systems because movement of vehicles is restricted in just
bidirectional movements constrained along roads and streets
[9]. Most position-based routing algorithms are based on
forwarding decision upon location information [10], [11],
[12]. Additionally, some protocols consider the connectivity
to construct reliable routes [13], [14]
Broadcast routing is frequently used for delivering adver-
tisements and announcements in VANETs [15]. The simplest
way is ﬂooding, in which each vehicle re-broadcasts packets
to all of its neighbors. Flooding performs relatively well for
a small number of vehicles [16], [17]. However, it suffers
from broadcast storm problems when the number of vehicle in
networks increases because a lot of redundant messages are re-
broadcasted and many collisions occur in networks [18]. Some
schemes for the broadcast storm problems have been proposed
in ad hoc networks [19], [20]. However, the investigation about
the broadcast storm problems is not enough to be considered
in VANETs [21].
Meanwhile, the IEEE 802.11p, intended for vehicular com-
munication, has drown attention recently [22], [23]. The IEEE
802.11p also employs carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
mechanisms as medium access control techniques. Therefore,
vehicles ﬁrst listen to channel and transmit data packets if
the channel has been free for a certain period. Hence, sev-
eral transmissions are performed when we employ broadcast

routing, and these transmissions cause long delay and packet
collisions.
The physical layer of the IEEE 802.11p employs Orthogo-
nal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as modulation
techniques. The OFDM has been focused for high-speed data
transmission in wireless LAN, cellular systems and etc. OFDM
signals are multipath robust due to low symbol rates and
addition of a guard interval (GI) to an OFDM symbol [24].
Therefore, multipath reﬂections that have a delay spread less
than the guard interval period can be demodulated with no
inter-symbol interference (ISI). This characteristic is used
for Single Frequency Networks (SFN) in television broadcast
systems [25]. In SFN, the same OFDM signal is transmitted
from some ﬁxed antenna towers, which exist in different
places. In order to demodulate multiple OFDM signals with-
out ISI, reception timing of these OFDM signals should be
less than the guard interval period. Therefore, high accuracy
transmission timing control is required at transmitters.
Authors consider that the concepts of SFN can apply to
vehicular networks. Meanwhile, vehicular networks have some
different characteristics from television broadcast systems.
First different characteristic is fast movement of vehicles.
Therefore, physical relationship between vehicles is always
changing, and forwarding vehicles are almost changing ac-
cording to the physical locations. Therefore, autonomous
transmission timing control mechanisms are required to
achieve the concepts of SFN in vehicular networks. If we can
achieve this concept, vehicles can obtain path diversity effect.
As the results, communication performance will be improved
without additional wireless resource.
In this paper, we focus on cooperative multiple transmission
schemes similar to SFN for vehicular networks to improve
transmission performance and to reduce transmission delay.
Then, we propose a new vehicular network with cooperative
transmission mechanisms. In the proposed vehicular network,
neighbor vehicles select the same random delay period for col-
lision avoidance autonomously, and forward the same OFDM
signal at same instance according to the selected random delay
period. Vehicles can demodulate the received OFDM signals
without ISI when the arrival timing of each OFDM signals is
conﬁned to the guard interval period of the OFDM signals.
Moreover, we assume the different sizes of vehicles in the
computer simulations. Then, we evaluate the proposed scheme
in the more actual wireless environment. The numerical results
show that the proposed scheme can achieve the high delivery
ratio with the short delivery delay.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this paper, we intend to achieve data dissemination of
vehicle information messages in speciﬁc area near a vehicle.

mission mechanisms to reduce end-to-end delay. In the almost
all studies of ad-hoc networks, only one signal is transmitted
by only one node. Therefore, more wireless resource is re-
quired to achieve path diversity effects because some nodes
transmit the same signal at different timing. As the result, it
is well known that broadcast storm problems occur.
Meanwhile, some vehicles transmit the same OFDM signal
simultaneously in the proposed scheme. Therefore, transmis-
sion period of the proposed scheme equals to that of the
single signal transmission. Hence, our scheme can achieve
path diversity effects without additional consumption of wire-
less resource. Additionally, vehicles re-broadcast the received
packets of vehicle information messages when the vehicles
exist in delivery area of the source vehicle that transmits the
received packets.
Figure 1 shows the overview communication of the pro-
posed scheme. Figure 1 a) shows the assumed location of
four vehicles, and Fig. 1 b) shows the packet transmission
timing. In the assumptions, the vehicle V1 transmits its own
vehicle information message to neighbor vehicles V2 and V3 by
broadcasting. In order to demodulate two signals without inter-
symbol interference at the vehicle V4, the two signals from
the vehicles V2 and V3 must arrive during the guard interval
period. Hence, the vehicles V2 and V3 should select the same
random back-off value. Then, these two vehicles forward the
same OFDM signal at almost same instance. As the results,
the vehicle V4 receives the two same signals from V2 and V3,
and obtain the path diversity effect.
It is known that wireless channel in vehicular networks is
assumed to be fading environments. In fading environments,
only one wireless link may not be enough to achieve reliable
communication. Additionally, some broadcast based protocols
have been considered to achieve safety applications, which im-

prove vehicle safety on the roads. Meanwhile, the transmission
period of the proposed scheme equals to that of conventional
CSMA mechanisms. Therefore, the proposed scheme can
reduce transmission delay with performance improvement.
The proposed scheme employs the source ID, the hop count
information and the sequence number of data packets for
controlling transmission timing. Therefore, prior negotiation
process is not required to start forwarding of data packets.
Then, the proposed scheme can also be employed for collision
avoidance systems in crossroads.
Figure 2 shows the ﬂowchart of the proposed media access
control scheme. The proposed scheme is extended mechanisms
of CSMA/CA. In general CSMA mechanisms, random back-
off periods are selected randomly at each node. Therefore,
nodes have different random back-off periods, and transmit
a packet at different timing to avoid packet collisions. In
the proposed scheme, vehicles that transmit the same OFDM
signal have to select the same random back-off period au-
tonomously. Moreover, we assume that the proposed scheme
should be processed in preference to schemes for single path
transmission because interruption due to other transmission of
packets damages performance of the proposed scheme. The
procedures of the proposed scheme are described as follows.

Example of transmission procedures.
• The procedures start when vehicles receive a packet from
neighbor vehicles.
• Vehicles conﬁrm the packet forwarding history to avoid
redundant forwarding.
• Vehicles initialize the Back-Off Index (BOI) that de-
termines the Network Allocation Vector (NAV), where
CWmin is the minimum number of contention window
size.
• Vehicles calculate the new NAV according to the initial-
ized BOI value. The NAV denotes the interval period
for the back-off period (BOP). In the general CSMA
mechanisms, the BOP is selected randomly with uniform
distribution.
• Vehicles generate a random value with the source ID, the
hop count information and the sequence number of data
packets for each node as random seeds. Hence, vehicle

can obtain the unique random value according to the
source ID, the hop count information and the sequence
number of data packets. Therefore, some vehicles that
forward the same OFDM signal can select the same
random back-off periods. As the results, the proposed
scheme can synchronize the transmission timing of some
forwarding vehicles autonomously. Moreover, vehicles
can obtain transmission opportunities randomly because
the random back-off period is generated randomly.
• Vehicles sense channel status. If the channel status is
busy, vehicles check the NAV value and retry channel
sensing. If the channel status is idle, vehicles check the
BOP value.
• If the BOP value does not equal to zero, vehicles decrease
the BOP value and wait for transmission timing. If the
BOP value equals to zero, vehicles start to transmit the
OFDM signal.
• After transmission of the OFDM signal, vehicles sense
the channel to conﬁrm transmission of the same data
packet transmitted by next hop vehicles.
• When vehicles receive the same data packet of the trans-
mitted OFDM signal, the procedures end. If not, vehicles
check the retransmission limit of data packets to avoid
continuous retransmission. Then, vehicles increase the
BOI value to extend the NAV period to reduce collision
probability, and try to retransmit the OFDM signal.
III. OPERATION EXAMPLES
Figures 3 show the example transmission procedures. Figure
4 shows the packet transmission timing of the proposed
schemes. In these ﬁgures, both the vehicle V1 and the vehicle
V7 transmit the packets of their own vehicle information
messages to the whole seven vehicles at almost same instance.
Each procedure is described as follows.
• Figure 3 a) shows the ﬁrst hop communication. Therefore,
the vehicle V1 and the vehicle V7 transmit the packets.
Vehicles V2, V3 and V4 receive the signal of the packet
from the vehicle V1. Vehicles V4, V5 and V6 receive
the signal of the packet from the vehicle V7. Therefore,
vehicles V2 and V3 receive the packet from the vehicle
V1, and vehicles V5 and V6 receive the packet from the
vehicle V7. Meanwhile, the vehicle V4 cannot receive the
packets from the vehicle V1 nor the vehicle V7 because
the two signals from the vehicles V1 and V7 conﬂict at
the vehicle V4.
• Figure 3 b) shows the second hop communication from
the vehicle V1. In this example, the selected random
back-off value of the vehicles V2 and V3 is assumed to
be less than that of the vehicles V5 and V6. Therefore,
the vehicles V2 and V3 transmit the same signal at ﬁrst.
These two signals arrive at the vehicles V4, V5 and V6.
Then, these vehicles demodulate the two received signals.
Meanwhile, the vehicles V5 and V6 resume the back-off
process after the transmission from the vehicles V2 and
V3 is completed.

• Figure 3 c) shows the second hop communication from
the vehicle V7. The vehicles V5 and V6 transmit the same
signal. The vehicles V2, V3 and V4 receive the two signals,
and demodulate them.
• Figure 3 d) shows the third hop communication. In this
example, the selected random back-off value for the
vehicle information message of the vehicle V1 is assumed
to be less than that for the vehicle V7. Therefore, the
vehicles V4, V5 and V6 transmit the same signal from the
vehicle V1 ﬁrstly, and the vehicles V2, V3 and V4 also
transmit the same signal from the vehicle V7 secondly.
Hence, the vehicle V1 receives the packet from the vehicle
V7, and the vehicle V7 receives the packet from the
vehicle V1.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
To evaluate the proposed scheme, we performed computer
simulations with network simulator QualNet [26]. Qualnet
is the well-known wireless network simulation software that
considers the more actual wireless environment. Therefore,
the simulator considers packet errors due to low signal-to-
interference and noise power ratio (SINR), channel ﬂuctuation
due to fading, blocking by large-size vehicles. The results
are an average of 10 trial simulations. Our proposed scheme
intends to achieve data dissemination of vehicle information
messages for safe driving systems. Therefore, we employ
broadcast communication to deliver the vehicle information
messages in delivery area. In the simulations, the delivery area
is set to 1000 [m] from a source vehicle. It is known that
broadcast communication suffers from packet collisions when
many vehicles exist in a communication area. Therefore, we
considered 50 vehicles for small number of vehicles and 300
vehicles for large number of vehicles. We assumed that the
road shape is the loop line with the radius equals to 1500
[m] and 2 lanes. Each vehicle is located randomly on the
road, selecting the velocity between 90 [km/h] and 110 [km/h]
randomly. Therefore, the distribution of vehicle velocity is
uniformly between 90 [km/h] and 110 [km/h] The vehicle
runs on the inside lane principally and keeps an inter-vehicular
distance as 100 [m]. If there is no vehicle on the outside lane,
the vehicle moves to the outside lane from the inside lane
to overtake a forward vehicle. After overtaking, the vehicle
moves to the inside lane if there is no vehicle on the inside
lane. In the simulations, the passings occur according to the
Table I.
The feature of this paper is also to consider the effect of
large-size vehicles. Hence, we deﬁne the large-size vehicle
ratio (LVR) that means the ratio of the large-size vehicles and
the standard-size vehicles. When the large-size vehicle ratio is
set to 0, all vehicles are standard-size vehicles. Meanwhile,
we assumed that large-size vehicles are rectangular solids.

If the rectangular solid is overlapped with the straight line
between two standard-size vehicles, these two vehicles cannot
communicate due to blocking. Additionally, a free space
propagation model is used as the wireless propagation model.
To consider channel ﬂuctuation due to movement, rayleigh
fading according to 100 [km/h] is assumed in the simulations.
The ﬁnal purpose of this study is to fuse vehicle information
delivery networks and communication networks for several
network applications. Therefore, we employ IEEE 802.11p,
which is a future communication device for ITS networks.
In the simulations, the transmission range is about 285 [m],
packet errors are determined due to the received signal-to-
interference and noise power ratio (SINR). The size of a
vehicle information message is 100 [Byte], and is transmitted
with 5 [packets/s].
Our scheme is one of the broadcast communication meth-
ods. Therefore, we employ the probabilistic ﬂooding scheme
in comparison. The ﬂooding probability is assumed to be
50, 75, and 100 [%]. Meanwhile, retransmission of vehicle
information messages is not performed in order to evaluate the
proposed scheme and ﬂooding mechanisms fairly. Simulation
parameters are shown in detail in Table II.
Figure 5 shows the area delivery ratio of vehicle information
messages with the large-size vehicle ratio equals to 0 [%].
In this study, we deﬁne that the area delivery ratio is the
message received ratio for vehicles in the delivery area. From

the results, we can ﬁnd that our proposed scheme can achieve
the highest delivery ratio. The performance of the full ﬂooding
scheme degrades when the number of vehicles increases. This
reason is that broadcast storm problems tend to occur when the
number of vehicles increases. Meanwhile, the delivery ratio of
the probabilistic ﬂooding scheme degrades when the ﬂooding
probability decreases. Especially, it degrades much when the
value of the ﬂooding probability is set to low. This is because
several vehicles are required to forward vehicle information
messages when there are a small number of vehicles on the
road. Additionally, the performance of the every mechanism
degrades when the number of vehicles is set to 50 or 100. The
reason is that there are not enough vehicles to forward vehicle
information messages in the delivery area.
Figure 6 shows the area delivery ratio of vehicle information
messages with the large-size vehicle ratio equals to 20 [%].
Therefore, blocking due to large-size vehicles is considered
in this condition. From the results, the proposed scheme can
keep the high delivery ratio, which is almost same as that

of Fig. 5. On the contrary, the performance of the ﬂooding
scheme degrades compared with Fig. 5. This reason is that
the proposed scheme can obtain the multi-path diversity effect.
Therefore, our scheme has resistance to blocking.
Figure 7 shows the packet error ratio of vehicle information
messages with the large-size vehicle ratio equals to 0 [%].
From the results, the proposed scheme can reduce the packet
error ratio compared with the ﬂooding schemes. The reason is
that the proposed scheme can demodulate some same OFDM
signals. Therefore, vehicles tend to obtain better condition
OFDM signals even if condition of OFDM signals degrades
due to fading or blocking. Meanwhile, the packet error ratio
increases with increasing in the number of vehicles. This
is because interference signals also increase according to
increasing in the number of transmitted packets.
Figure 8 shows the packet error ratio of vehicle information
messages with the large-size vehicle ratio equals to 20 [%].
From the results, we can ﬁnd that the packet error ratio is
improved compared with Fig. 7. This is caused by large-size

vehicle can also block interference signals. Hence, SINR is
improved due to reduction of interference power.
Figure 9 shows the end-to-end delay performance with the
large-size vehicle ratio equals to 0 [%]. The delay period
starts when a source vehicle transmits a vehicle information
message, and ends when the vehicle information message
is received at a vehicle in the delivery area. Therefore, the
accurate delay of each vehicle is different due to the positions
of the vehicles. Therefore, the delay performance averages
delays of each vehicle in the delivery area. From the results,
we can ﬁnd that the proposed scheme can reduce the delay
to the halves of the full ﬂooding scheme. The reason is that
vehicles transmit the same OFDM signal simultaneously in
the proposed scheme. Hence, vehicles tend to obtain packet
transmission opportunity according to reduction of consumed
wireless resource. In road safety applications, delay is the most
important factor to achieve collision avoidance and control of
trafﬁc ﬂows. Moreover, our scheme can reduce the increasing
amount of delay according to the increasing in the number

Figure 10 shows the end-to-end delay performance with the
large-size vehicle ratio equals to 20 [%]. The results show
that the proposed scheme can reduce the delay performance
compared with Fig. 9. The reason is that blocking by large-
size vehicles improves frequency reuse performance. Then,
vehicles tend to obtain packet transmission opportunities due
to reduction of reception signals.
Figure 11 shows the end-to-end jitter performance with the
large-size vehicle ratio equals to 0 [%]. From the results, we
can ﬁnd that the proposed scheme can also reduce the jitter to
the halves of the full ﬂooding scheme. Moreover, the proposed
scheme can keep low jitter performance even if the high area
delivery ratio is maintained.
Figure 12 shows the end-to-end jitter performance with the
large-size vehicle ratio equals to 20 [%]. The results show that
the proposed scheme can reduce the jitter performance due to
the same reason in the delay performance.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have focus on characteristics of OFDM
communication that vehicles can demodulate some same
OFDM signals in guard interval period. The proposed scheme
offers the autonomous media access control scheme that some
vehicles can transmit the same signal at same instance. More-
over, we have employed the proposed media access control
scheme and the broadcast mechanism to achieve data dissem-
ination of vehicle information messages. From the results, our
scheme can keep the high message delivery ratio and the low
end-to-end delay even if fast movement of vehicles, blocking
by large-size vehicles and channel ﬂuctuation due to fading
are considered. In the actual communication environment,
it is important to support these mixed factors for real safe
driving systems. Meanwhile, we can provide required quality
in communication if we employ the forward error correction
(FEC) to recover the packet losses. Considering all these
results mentioned above, the proposed scheme could be one
of new fundamental schemes for achieving ITS.
