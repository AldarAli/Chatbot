Abstract—In the present paper, a new approach for uplink 
power control is proposed. The developed method is based on 
dividing the cell into sectors and applying an evolutionary 
algorithm approach of controlling the transmitted uplink 
power. Simulation experiments are presented demonstrating 
the control of transmitted power from the active cell sectors as 
the overall neighboring cells interference is kept below a 
predefined threshold. The major advantage of this approach is 
the random power allocation over active sectors which results 
in increased throughput and fair resource management.

 INTRODUCTION 
Over the years, Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have 
attracted a lot of attention from different research areas 
because of their ability to solve complex optimization 
problems by imitating some aspects of natural evolution. In 
the context of biology, the evolution is considered as the 
change of one or several individual characteristics which are 
then transferred to the offspring. EA make use of different 
biological 
processes 
as 
reproduction, 
mutation, 
recombination and selection to find the optimal solution in a 
particular application. The solution candidates are considered 
as individuals belonging to a particular population while the 
environment is defined as a set of constraints to the 
optimization problem. As a rule, considerable computational 
resources are needed for EA simulation as the problem 
solution time is very sensitive to the specific model and its 
parameters. 
Basically, two groups of optimization problems are 
solved using EA. First one is formed by a variety of 
Stationary Optimization Problems (SOPs) where the problem 
is precisely defined in advance and remains fix over the time 
[1]. The second group is related to the field of dynamic 
optimization problems (DOPs) which are characterized with 
ever-changing environment [2]. Usually for SOPs the aim is 
to find quickly and precisely the optimal solution in the 
search space. However, for DOPs, where the environment is 
dynamic, in addition to the above mentioned aims an ability 
to track and adapt to the changing conditions is crucial and 
often is in conflict with the requirement for fastness and 
preciseness. 
Following the existing examples of application areas for 
EA, in the present paper, we propose an EA to solve the 
problem of uplink power control in Long Term Evolution 
(LTE) wireless mobile networks. We consider this problem 
as DOP and utilize the intrinsic ability of EA to solve such 
kind of problems. At present, several methods for uplink 
power control are practically considered.  
First one is a 3GPP specification and provides slow Open 
Loop Power Control (OLPC). The method is known as 
Fractional Power Control (FPC) that allows for full or partial 
compensation of slow path gain (path loss) and shadowing 
variations. The performance of FPC has been investigated 
intensively in [3] and [4]. The basic conclusion is that there 
is a trade-off between the overall cell throughput (overall 
spectral efficiency) and the outage cell throughput. 
Second method is named Interference Based PC (IBPC) 
[5] and [6]. It is based on Closed Loop PC (CLPC) to adjust 
the user equipment (UE) power thus improving the system 
performance both from the overall and outage cell 
throughput perspective. The basic idea is that the power 
should be controlled to compensate for the generated 
interference to the system rather than the path gain (path 
loss). The result is that each user generates the same amount 
of interference. IBPC is very promising but still keeping the 
average cell throughput of the outage cell gain is less than  
30 %.  
Other methods are also suggested in the literature based 
on combining the above ones or applying game theoretical or 
cognitive approaches [7]. 
Despite all of the above mentioned approaches, the 
problem of uplink power control is still open in the context 
of throughput gain and fair resource allocation for users in 
the central and outage cell areas. Moreover in most of the 
cases these methods are analyzed assuming static conditions 
such as fixed bandwidth, balanced loads, evenly distributed 
users in the cell, etc. This is the motivation to try the 
application of EA to solve uplink power control problem 
considered as a typical DOP.  
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section II introduces details about some basic characteristics 
of EA. Section III presents the proposed EA for uplink 
power control (EA-UPC). The main results are presented in 
Section IV, and finally, the conclusions are summarized in 
Section V. 
II. 
EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM WITH ASSOCIATIVE 
MEMORY 
An EA can be divided into three major phases. First 
phase: a number of individuals exist in the environmental

plane. They interact between each other and with the 
environment. In the second phase, using a fitness function 
estimation, the most successful individuals are chosen. Their 
characteristics are combined, processed and transformed 
according to specific predefined rules. In the third phase 
(selected 
evolved individuals), 
the 
most 
successful 
individuals are taken back to the environment. This process 
of evolution is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  The main phases of an EA. 
If we consider the evolutionary process from the 
perspective of one individual (G) its behavior can be 
characterized by several specific features: 
1. 
Random behavior in the process of finding solutions 
and nondeterministic state; 
2. 
Every interaction, even self-interaction, generates 
reaction which can  not always be estimated or 
measured; 
3. 
Each evolved individual G has found at least one 
solution as a result of the interaction; 
4. 
There are a finite number of individual states; 
5. 
There are an infinite number of interactions with the 
environment but their intensiveness is finite.  
 
An example of evolutionary process and solution finding 
is illustrated in Fig. 2 for one individual (G). In order to 
prevent information loss for the EA, it is necessary the state 
“S”, which is responsible for solution finding, to have 
access to the results from each generation “G” on the 
evolutionary path. In addition to the decision which 
available tools (filters) to be used, S generates also a set of 
possible states (T) which can be tested along the path. 
Therefore the process of solution finding evolves by 
evolving the states (T). 
The following three equations represent the main features 
of an evolutionary process and solution finding.

Usually, during the implementation of an EA, Eqs. 1 and 
2 are solved, the current solutions are temporary buffered, 
and the best are placed in an associative memory. As seen in 
Fig. 2, state S provides information or attempts to describe 
the environment using the tools of the individual. The final 
solution is random and the probability to find a better

S to deduct information from the previous generations.  
III. 
UPLINK POWER CONTROL USING EA 
In order to develop an EA for uplink power control, 
formulating the optimization problem is necessary first. We 
consider an example situation as presented in Fig. 3. A LTE 
cell with base station (BS) “B” is given. The neighboring 
cells are presented by their BSs – B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6. 
The cell is divided into sectors. The users located in each 
sector can transmit a signal with a total power of
( , )
p i j
 and 
thus for every neighboring cell a maximum overall level of 
the interference, measured at its BS, is defined.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Cell division into sectors. 
The interference vector 
V∑k
r
 is a sum of the interference 
caused by each active (transmitting at that time) sector as 
shown in Fig.4. A sector is considered as active if the 
transmitted power is above a predefined threshold. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Interference at BS “Bk” caused by active sectors G(4,2) and   
G(6,1). 
Having this arrangement for the cell and the interference 
vector, we formulate the optimization problem as follows. 
First, the interference measured at BS “Bk” is represented by 
V∑k
r
. Second,                           contains the current 
generation. Third,                              represents the 
coordinates of the sectors belonging to generation        . 
The intensity of the interference can be found using Eq.4.

The objective is maximizing the throughput under the 
constraint that the interference level is below a given limit. 
Then, if a set {

which Eq.8 holds, subject to the constrains presented in Eq.9:

As seen from Eqs. 8 and 9, during the uplink power 
control optimization process we try to increase the signal 
power of the active sectors, thus increasing the throughput, 
while keeping for each neighboring cell the interference 
below a predefined threshold (Pmax). 
To solve the uplink power control optimization problem 
we develop an EA implemented in the following steps. 
Evolution Step 1: First, let the total number sectors is “J”, 
and the number of active sectors is “N” (N<J). We choose 
one set consisting of “n” (n<N) active sectors in a random 
manner. The transmitted signal power for each of these

sectors is allocated randomly. We check if the requirements 
in Eq. 8, and the constrains in Eq. 9 are fulfilled. If the check 
is positive, then the solution is considered as suboptimal and 
the current generation      is memorized. This is performed 
for a number of “I” iterations. Then we perform this 
experiment for another set of active sectors. This is done for 
all possible sets of n active sectors - R. As a result from step 
1 we have memorized a number of suboptimal solutions, 
including the sets of active sectors with their corresponding 
allocated transmitted signal power. 
Evolution Step 2: The allocated signal power found in 
step 1 of each of the “R” set of active sectors is transformed 
as follows. We increase by a random factor the transmitted 
power for all sectors belonging to the set. This goes for 
another “I” iterations. Then we check if the constrains in 
Eq.9 are fulfilled. If the check is positive then the solution is 
considered as suboptimal and it is memorized. 
Evolution Step 3: We again randomize the sector 
combinations, but this time using (n+1) active sectors. Then 
we look for combination match in the memory of sector 
indexes for each permutation of randomized combination. If 
there is one or more matches we use one of them as base for 
step 3. We chose randomly one active sector belonging to the 
set and increase its power with 1 unit. Then we check if the 
constrains in Eq.9 are fulfilled. If the check is positive then 
the solution is considered as suboptimal and it is memorized. 
The flow chart of the proposed EA for uplink power 
control (EA-UPC) is presented in Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.  EA-UPC chart diagram (EA step 1). 
 
Figure 6.  EA-UPC chart diagram (EA step 2). 
As a result from EA-UPC we build a look-up table 
consisting of different combinations of active sectors with 
their signal power. These combinations represent the 
suboptimal solutions found in the optimization process.  
Evolution Step 4: Each solution is compared to others 
using the sector coordinates and if the difference vector for 
two solutions is below a given threshold an associative link 
is created between them. This process develops an 
associative memory as shown in Fig. 9. Here, the elements 
MASS(m,n) represent the combination set of active sectors 
and STR[(m,n),(p,q)] the associative links between them. 
During uplink power control if a particular solution comes 
out not to be appropriate, because of  specific sector or cell 
throughput requirements, or some  QoS issues [8], then one 
of its associates could be used. The STR links could be also 
used for further evolutionary processing.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
As a simplified example for EA-UPC we consider the cell 
presented in Fig. 10, and assume that the number of active 
sectors is four. The cell is divided into six sectors and in the 
process of initial set up BS “B”, applying the EA a “look-up 
table” is created in which the suboptimal solutions are 
memorized. For our case of four active sectors the look up 
table is illustrated in Table 1. During the operation the BS 
locates the set of active sectors. Then using the look up table, 
the BS limits the corresponding uplink signal power level for 
each one of the active sectors. If some of the sectors needs 
power above the assigned limit, because of throughput or 
QoS requirements, then the BS can use one of the associated 
combinations. The fourth column of Table 1 represents the 
associative combinations.

To evaluate the performance of EA-UCP we simulate 
each evolutionary step during the initial set-up procedure of 
the BS. The results are presented in Fig. 11. During the 
experiments, the maximum allowed for each neighboring 
cell interference is set at an absolute value of 20. We run 150 
independent simulations of the EA-UCP and each one 
undertakes 300 iterations. The results for the overall 
neighboring cells interference are averaged over all 150 
simulations. Combinations of different active sectors are 
investigated to evaluate the influence of the sectors location 
on the performance of EA-UPC.

The simulation results demonstrate that in each of the 
evolutionary steps, the EA-UPC algorithm tends to 
maximize the overall neighboring cells interference, thus 
maximizing the overall cell throughput, but at the same time 
keeping the interference below the predefined allowable 
threshold. All steps in EA show, as expected, a logarithmic 
increase in overall neighboring cell interference. While the 
algorithm goes thought steps 1, 2, and 3, the second 
derivative decreases and the graphics straighten, as the 
difference in power allocated between steps differs.  
 
Figure 11.  Combined evolutionary steps. 
It could also be seen from this simple example, that after 
the 10th suboptimal solution of the first evolutionary step, 
most probable is each following suboptimal solution to give 
very little contribution to the increase of the overall 
neighboring cells interference and thus to the throughput. 
This justifies the application of the next step of EA. The 
simulation results show, that in the third evolution step 
(Fig.11), the rise of the interference level reaches the 
maximum allowable limit. For the chosen set of sectors the 
algorithm stops to evolve, as it has reached the constraints of 
maximum interference of the absolute value of 20 for one of 
the neighboring BS stations. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The proposed, in this contribution, evolutionary 
algorithm can be used effectively for uplink power control in 
LTE networks. Assuming an interference limited approach to 
power control, based on the division of the cell into sectors 
and estimating, via the proposed EA algorithm, the 
maximum allowable overall interference generated for 
different combinations of active sectors, a maximum of 
average cell throughput could be achieved. The EA-UPC 
demonstrates good performance characteristics for a broad 
range of active sector combinations. Compared to the now-
existing methods for uplink power control the presented 
approach reveals several major advantages. First, EA-UPC is 
CLPC method because we keep the interference below a 
predefined maximum. Second, because of the random 
manner of power allocation for the active sectors, EA-UPC 
provides fair resource management independent of the sector 
location in the cell (central or outage zone). Besides these the 
look up table could be cell specific depending on the number 
of sectors in the cells, dimension and type of the area (rural 
or non-rural) QoS requirements and other cell parameters or 
conditions.
