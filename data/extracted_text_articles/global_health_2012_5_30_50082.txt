Abstract — It has been reported that schizophrenia patients 
have altered cardiac autonomic regulation and changed heart 
rate variability. The goal of this study was to analyze whether 
schizophrenia patients may exhibit distinctive Heart rate 
variability time and frequency domain parameters for control 
subjects compared both at rest and during auditory 
stimulation periods. Photoplethysmographic signals of thirteen 
schizophrenic patients and thirteen healthy subjects were used 
in the analysis of heart rate variability. Results show that heart 
rate in patients was higher than that of control subjects 
indicating autonomic dysfunction throughout the entire 
experiment. In comparison with control subjects, patients with 
schizophrenia exhibited lower high frequency power and a 
greater low-frequency to high-frequency ratio. Moreover, 
while alerting stimulus decreased parasympathetic activity in 
healthy subjects, no significant changes in heart rate and 
frequency-domain HRV parameters were observed between 
the auditory stimulation and rest periods in schizophrenia 
patients.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by some 
positive symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and 
negative symptoms such as loss of motivation, lack of 
interest, disturbances in cognitions and emotions [1, 2]. 
According to the theories about symptom development in 
schizophrenia, it is claimed that indication of psychosis is 
related to autonomic dysfunction [3]. Therefore, there have 
been numerous studies that analyze disturbances of 
autonomic activity in schizophrenia patients [4-6]. 
Heart rate variability (HRV), which describes the 
variation in heartbeat intervals, is an important measure for 
investigation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) 
activity. HRV analysis has been widely used to assess ANS 
activity in myocardial infarction, diabetic neuropathy, 
cardiac transplantation, myocardial dysfunction, tetraplegia 
[7], diabetes mellitus and renal failure [8]. Moreover, HRV 
analysis has been widely used in schizophrenia patients due 
to the relationship between symptoms of the disorder and 
cardiac autonomic irregularities [3, 9-12]. Results for altered 
cardiac autonomic regulation and changed HRV in 
schizophrenia patients are reported. It has been found that 
they have higher rates of cardiac disease and morbidity due 
to the dysregulation of ANS activity. 
Most of these studies in schizophrenia patients are 
restricted to electrocardiogram (ECG) based HRV signal 
analysis. However, there are some of the problems of this 
technique such as drift, electromagnetic and biologic 
interference, the number of wires, and the complex 
morphology of the ECG [13]. On the other hand, 
photoplethysmogaphy (PPG) is reported as a simpler and 
easier process than analyzing HRV parameters from ECG 
data according to the results of a previous study [14]. In 
previous studies, HRV signal is usually analyzed in the time 
and frequency domain. While time domain measures of 
HRV have been used to evaluate the interbeat interval (IBI) 
variability, spectral analysis of sequences of IBIs can be used 
to assess the distribution of power across different frequency 
bands and reflects the sympathovagal balance between the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.  
The aim of the present study is to identify the differences 
in PPG based HRV measures during alertive acoustic white 
noise (WN), sedative Classical Turkish Music (CTM), and 
restive (no stimulation) periods for schizophrenia patients 
and healthy control subjects. While Section II is related to 
data acquisition and analysis techniques, Section III, IV and 
V are about results, discussion and conclusion of the study, 
respectively.

METHODS 
A. Subjects 
Thirteen schizophrenia patients diagnosed by the DSM-
IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition) [15] 
and thirteen healthy subjects, approximately matched in age 
and gender, participated in the study. Table I lists the 
demographic and clinical data of the participants. None of 
the subjects had history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
respiratory 
diseases, 
cardiovascular 
diseases, 
hearing 
difficulties and co-morbidity in terms of psychiatric 
problems. Both the university and hospital ethics committee 
approved the protocol, and a written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants before the study was 
conducted.

B. Data Acquisition 
The study was carried out whilst participants seated in a 
quiet, temperature controlled and illuminated room without 
moving in Bakırköy Mental and Nervous Diseases Training 
and Research Hospital. The PPG data were recorded using 
Biopac MP150WSW data acquisition unit, PPG100C 
amplifier, TSD200 transducer and associated Acknowledge 
Software, which is an interactive program that measure, 
analyze and transform data.  
The transducer was strapped on to the middle finger of 
the non-dominant hand of the participant and connected to 
the amplifier. A baseline data recording was obtained prior to 
the experiment. Data were recorded for 2 min. resting state 
(resting 1, R1) before auditory stimuli exposure, then 
following 2 min. period of WN exposure, following 2 min. 
period of music exposure and a 2 min. post-exposure resting 
(resting 2, R2) period and were digitized at a sampling rate 
of 250 Hz. The subjects listened to stimuli binaurally through 
headphones with the intensity of 75 dB.  
WN is a kind of sound of rain on a river and was selected 
because of its uncomfortable, annoying evaluation from 
previous studies [16, 17]. On the other hand, CTM was 
selected as a sedative music period [18]. According to the 
Turkish philosopher Farabi, the effect of this kind of music 
induces serenity and ease [19]. 
C. Heart Rate Variability Analysis 
Matlab 7.6 software package was used for data 
analysis. The PPG data were first low-pass filtered using a 
Butterworth filter (8th order, cut-off 8 Hz). A detection 
algorithm, which finds min and max points of waveform, 
was implemented to detect peaks of the PPG signal and 
tachograms were plotted. Then, an interpolation with a 
sampling rate of 4 Hz was applied and data were detrended 
using 
a 
least-squares 
polynomial 
fitting 
detrending 
technique, which is explained in our previous study [18, 20].  
In the time domain analysis of HRV, the mean length of 
all PP intervals (PPint) and the heart rate (HR) in each 
measurement period (2 min.) were computed. In the 
frequency domain analysis, spectral analysis was performed 
using the Welch’s algorithm, which is an averaging modified 
periodogram to estimate the power spectrum [21]. The power 
spectrum of the HRV signal was divided into three bands: 
very low frequency-VLF (0-0.04 Hz), low frequency-LF 
(0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency-HF (0.15-0.5 Hz). The 
power spectral density of the LF and the HF band were 
computed by integration of the power spectrum over the 
related frequency range (square milliseconds-ms2) in each 
period. While the LF band reflects sympathetic activity, the 
HF band is related to parasympathetic activity. The ratio of 
LF to HF power (LF/HF) was calculated to assess the 
sympathovagal balance for indicating the function of the 
ANS activity.  
D. Statistical Analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 
(version 20.0) statistical software package. Comparisons of 
HRV features between the patients and controls in each 
period were executed using an independent sample Student’s 
t-test. Under the null hypothesis, defined as “no difference in 
the HRV features of patients and controls”, the data follows 
a normal distribution. To compare the differences in HRV 
between sequential periods, paired sample Student’s t-tests 
were performed on both groups, separately. The student’s t-
test was chosen based on a finding from Levene’s test. Due 
to confidence level of 95 %, results were considered as 
significant at the level of p<0.05.

measurement periods, in which time and frequency domain 
measures of HRV were computed for the PPint of healthy 
control subjects and schizophrenia patients. In Table II, the

Figure 3.  Comparison of the changes in the LF/HF of HRV between 
patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects 
The baseline tachograms (top panels) and their 
corresponding power spectra (bottom panels) of a patient 
in the schizophrenia group (left) and an individual in the 
control group (right) are shown in Fig. 2. From here, it 
may be seen that, the individual with schizophrenia 
exhibited a higher HR, shorter PPint, and decreased HRV 
during the restive baseline period as compared to the 
healthy subject. The PPint feature of the schizophrenia 
patients during the whole procedure was significantly 
lower than that of the control subjects (p<0.05). While the 
LF power in schizophrenia patients was not different from 
that in control subjects, the HF power was significantly 
reduced in the patients (p<0.05) during all periods of the 
procedure. Moreover, schizophrenia patients showed 
increased LF/HF ratio as compared to control subjects 
during both stimulation and restive periods (Fig. 3). 
B. Comparisons of HRV measures within groups 
Auditory stimulation caused an increase in HR in both 
groups as compared to that during restive periods. While 
the control group showed the greatest HR during the WN 
exposure, no significant HR change was reported during 
the WN period and CTM period in schizophrenia patients. 
Although HR decreased during CTM as compared to the 
WN period, this difference did not reach significant levels 
in either the control (p=0.1) subjects or schizophrenic 
patients (p=0.18). The decrease in HR continued in the R2 
period for both the control subject and patient groups. 
However, for both groups, no significant change was 
reported over the CTM and R2 periods. The results 
indicate that there was an insignificant decrease in PPint 
between restive periods (R1 and R2) and stimulation 
periods (WN and CTM) in both groups.  
Auditory stimulation evoked an increase of LF power 
and LF/HF ratio from the baseline and a decrease of HF 
power in the HRV in both groups (p<0.05). While the LF 
power increased more during WN than during CTM, the 
WN evoked a more deceleration of HF power from the 
baseline as compared to CTM in the control group. The 
LF/HF ratio of healthy subjects was higher during WN 
than during CTM. In contrast, there were no significant 
differences in terms of LF, HF, and LF/HF ratio when the 
different auditory stimuli were heard by the group of 
schizophrenia patients. The restive period (R2) after 
stimulation periods caused a significant decrease in LF 
power in healthy individuals, whereas LF power did not 
change significantly during the R2 period in the 
schizophrenia group.  
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
It has been reported that altered autonomic function is 
associated with higher rates of cardiac disease and 
morbidity in schizophrenia patients [22]. Therefore, HRV 
analysis has become a powerful and useful tool in clinical 
research to assess ANS activities in schizophrenia patients. 
By combining the knowledge about impairment in 
auditory stimuli discrimination with altered autonomic 
regulation of schizophrenia patients, we aimed to 
investigate the PPG based HRV parameters during 
different types of auditory stimuli in patients. It was found 
that schizophrenia patients had higher HR and shorter 
PPint than control subjects during all periods of the 
procedure. This may be observed as a result of disorder-
related 
autonomic 
nervous 
system 
changes 
[3]. 
Schizophrenia group also exhibited a similar LF power, a 
significant decrease in HF power and an increase in the 
LF/HF ratio as compared to healthy subjects during all the 
periods of the procedure. 
Although HR increased during auditory stimulation 
periods in both groups, changes between the two stimulus 
periods were not significant for schizophrenia patients. 
The LF power and the LF/HF ratio increased during 
stimulation periods as compared to restive periods in both 
schizophrenia and control groups. However, the LF power 
was higher during WN exposure than during sedative 
CTM exposure in the control group. On the other hand, HF 
power was higher during CTM than WN, but remained the 
same in both restive and CTM periods. Namely, while 
alerting stimulus increased sympathetic activity more, it 
caused a reduction in parasympathetic activity in healthy 
subjects. Therefore, the LF/HF ratio was highest during 
WN in the control group. This confirms the result of a past 
study that states the HF power, which is decreased by 
uncomfortable stimuli, may be sensitive to stress reduction 
in resting state [23]. In contrast, there were no significant 
differences in terms of LF, HF, and LF/HF ratio in 
schizophrenia patients during these two different auditory 
stimuli periods. This may be related to impairments of 
schizophrenia patients in auditory discrimination [24] or 
related to cardiac autonomic dysfunction in schizophrenia 
patients.  
A post hoc power analysis revealed that on the basis of 
the mean a limited statistical power because of the modest 
sample size. Therefore, it is suggested to increase the 
number of participants in each group for future studies.

V. 
CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, the results obtained for HRV measures 
support that the variations in cardiac autonomic activity 
during the restive baseline and other stimulation periods 
are different between schizophrenia patients and healthy 
individuals. The reduced parasympathetic activity in 
schizophrenic patients can be considered as strongly 
relating the risk factor of cardiac morbidity.
