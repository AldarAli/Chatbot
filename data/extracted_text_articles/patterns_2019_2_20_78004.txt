Abstract—This paper is the second part of a series of three
thematically connected papers and presents four patterns for
nonprofessional web developers. The patterns in this part of the
series address updates, setting up and maintaining mail servers
and securing a web shop. Starting with a pattern that provides
basic information necessary for any type of web presence,
while the subsequent patterns provide more in-depth information
specializing on speciﬁc topics.
Keywords–Patterns; On-line; Security; Privacy; Novice Users.

INTRODUCTION
Never has it been that easy to construct and set up a
website. The internet offers a vast amount of easy to use tools
and websites that allow nonprofessionals to develop, design
and shape a personal web presence. This web presence can
then be put online with only a few mouse clicks. Without
the proper knowledge about web security and web privacy
however, these websites may be turned into a potential threat to
the internet community. Poorly set-up and maintained websites
can easily be hijacked by cyber criminals. The criminals
usually compromise the site in a way, that they start to
distribute malware or ransomware to infect the computers of
inexperienced users visiting the website.
We created a set of patterns describing common security
and privacy issues and how they can be addressed on a high
level. This paper constitutes the second part of a series of
three thematically connected papers, which describe patterns
from the same pattern collection. Paper one contains two
meta-patterns and a general description how the patterns were
generated and structured. Paper three contains a set of four
additional patterns addressing concrete issues (e.g., frequency
of backups, data protection compliance, etc.).
In this paper, we will ﬁrst outline relevant related work
from the domains of web privacy and web security focusing
on updates, mail servers and the security of web shops. Section
II provides a short outline of relevant related work from the
aforementioned focus areas. Section III introduces the four
patterns with the titles: ”When and how often should I install
updates?”, ”Should I set up or operate a mail server myself?”,
”How should I set up / operate a mail server myself?” and
”How do I secure a web shop and what should be taken into
consideration?”. Section IV concludes this paper.
II.
RELATED WORK
Updates are intended to improve previously installed pro-
grams. The necessary changes may range from simple and
invisible changes, such as bug ﬁxes or improved security
patches up to major changes in the user interface, as well as
the addition of new functions or changes of already existing
features that may affect user workﬂow. Non-expert users tend
to skip updates due to previous negative experiences, e.g.,
unwanted and unexpected changes in the user interface or
annoying ”update now” pop-up messages [1]. Skipping updates
leads to more compromised computers, even though they could
have been protected as security updates were available but had
not yet been applied [2]. A more recent Security Intelligence
Report from Microsoft [3] shows that the amount of compro-
mised computers is still rising mainly because cyber criminals
prefer easy targets, such as novice users and non-experts. It
is easier to compromise computers and servers that are not
efﬁciently protected due to missing protection software, secu-
rity updates or poorly conﬁgured environments. Even when
a computer, server or website uses protection software and is
up-to-date, the exploitation of access control mechanisms with
weak passwords is one of the bigger problems. Pearman at al.
[4] show that a lot of users reuse passwords when they have
to manage a large number of them. Additionally, there is trend
to use weak passwords, if the system is allowing the creation
and use of them [5].

PATTERNS
A. When and how often should I install updates?
Intent: This pattern addresses the topic of updates for
software applications and operating systems on the personal
computers, as well as on servers. The main aim is to answer
when, how often and why updates should be installed in
general.
Problem Statement: Keeping software or systems up to
date is very important. Systems which are not updated fre-
quently are more vulnerable to attacks from the outside com-
pared to systems that are continuously held up to date.
Scenario: In order to secure your own system and reduce
the vulnerabilities attackers may use to get into your system, it
is necessary to maintain your system with the newest updates.
Solution: Updates should be installed in regular intervals.
However, this deﬁnition does not precisely deﬁne the actual
time period.
Therefore, we recommend the usage of automatic updates
if an application is offering this feature. Important security-
related programs (e.g., anti-virus software or operating sys-
tems) should be checked for updates on a daily basis. While,

PATTERNS 2019 : The Eleventh International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

for all other installed programs its sufﬁcient to check for
updates on a weekly or monthly basis.
Before the installation of any kind of update, we
recommend to create a system backup for safetys sake.
In unfavorable cases, updates may lead to problems or
incompatibilities. Especially major updates or version jumps in
programs may be irreversible. Therefore, it is advised to plan
ahead and calculate some time to test the system thoroughly
after after bigger version jumps, upgrades and updates. More
about backups can be found in pattern: When and how should
I create backups? [6].
• It is recommended to keep systems and software up-to-
date from the beginning.
◦ Up-to-date means, that all (primarily security-relevant)
updates for a system or software currently available are
installed.
• Systems, software or websites working with sensitive
data have higher priority.
◦ It is recommended to check for updates on a daily basis.
This applies to systems and computers accessing the
web server and the applications running on the server.
This point is especially important, if the website is
working with personal or sensitive data (account data,
addresses, etc.).
◦ Usually, the hosting provider takes care core appli-
cation updates (e.g., operating system, mySQL, PHP,
etc.).
• Establishing of an update day is recommended. For
example, once a month for the whole system or once
a week or day for systems or applications that handle
important or personal data.
• Automated updates are recommended, but you should also
look manually regularly (once a week).
◦ In certain cases, it is possible that an automatic update
messes up the automatic update function. In this case,
manual updates are the way to go.
• Set up an information network which informs you about
update releases. A couple of software and hardware
providers offer mailing lists and info websites for that
purpose.
In case certain software is not being updated anymore, it
is advisable to look for alternatives that are kept up to date.
Examples: Automated Updates - At certain time inter-
vals (e.g., hourly, daily or weekly), the system automatically
searches for updates.
Patch Day - On a patch day, all updates currently available
will be applied at a previous determined ﬁxed day (e.g., once
a week or once a month). The updates are usually tested on a
separate system before being applied onto the main system, in
order to eliminate any problems and / or compatibility issues.
Software Update Strategies - Create your own update strat-
egy. Set up a schedule for update checking and deployment.
This allows you to have a complete overview to when and if
an update was deployed, which program the update was for
and whether a certain machine already received an update.
WordPress update - WordPress offers two ways of updating
the core application. The ﬁrst option is the automatic update
function and the second is the manual update.
• To utilize the automatic update function of WordPress,
go to the WordPress Admin Panel and select ”Up-
dates” on the left sidebar. In case that the Word-
Press version was installed with the default settings,
you can also access this update function directly using
the following url:www.example.com/wp-admin/update-
core.php (replace example.com with your own url). This
page shows you the currently available updates for the
WordPress core installation, plugins, translations and
themes. If updates are available, they can be applied by
clicking the update button for the corresponding applica-
tion or component.
• In order to update WordPress manually, please refer to
the instructions provided on this page: Manually Update
WordPress [ger].
Important Mailing Lists - The article linked below, offers
interesting facts regarding updates. Furthermore, it provides
important mailing lists at the end of the article: Important
Mailinglists [7].
Additional mailing lists and more information can be found
here: Additional Links, Mailinglists and Newsgroups [8].

B. Should I set up or operate a mail server myself?
Intent: This pattern aims to help users to make a decision
whether they should run their own mail server or not.
Problem Statement: The administration and maintenance
of a mail server complicated and unfortunately often under-
rated. There are a vast amount of guides on the internet, that
aim to explain how to set up a mail server. However, setting
up, running and maintaining a mail server requires a lot of
specialist knowledge. Unfortunately, laymen do not or only
insufﬁciently possess this kind of knowledge.
Scenario: Sufﬁcient web space and a domain were ac-
quired. The page is now online. For obvious reasons, it seems
like a good idea to get mail addresses matching your domain
by setting up a mail server by yourself. But is that a good
idea?

Solution
Operating and maintaining Mail servers is a complex
task. If you are unsure whether you have the skills or not,
don not risk anything and leave it to professionals.
The following points should be considered before the
decision, whether it makes sense to operate your own mail
server:
• The optimal setup of a mail server is complicated.
◦ It is deceptively easy to set up a mail server. Myriads
of guides and a hand full of easy to use applications
can be found online. Unfortunately the security aspect
is neglected in many of these guides, as it is time
consuming and complicated.
◦ Setting up a mail server requires expertise and certain
knowledge of UNIX systems.
◦ The default settings are deﬁnitely neither the best, nor
are they recommended! Running a mail server using
the default setting should be avoided at all costs!
• Set-up a spam ﬁlter.
◦ A spam ﬁlter reduces the number of spam emails that
would otherwise end up in users’ mailboxes.
◦ Spam ﬁlters should always be adjusted very carefully.
Additionally, the ﬁlter needs readjustments every now
and then, as the content of the spam emails will change
over time. Setting up a good and reliable spam ﬁlter is
very time consuming.
• Antivirus Software
◦ Emails, especially with attachments should always be
checked by an antivirus software before redirecting
them to the receiver.
◦ Security mechanisms like this have to be installed and
adjusted. Additionally, they need to be kept up-to-date
in order to do their work.
• Offering webmail access.
◦ Usually, users want to retrieve their emails not only
through a software. A web platform might be manda-
tory.
◦ This web platform (usually, a piece of software in-
stalled on a webserver, e.g., roundcube [16]) has to
hosted and adjusted.
◦ This software has to be kept up-to-date. Backups and
the maintenance are mandatory.
• Blacklisting.
◦ The main task of a mail server is to send emails to
the addressed receivers. This might not be possible if
your own mail server is on a blacklist. Blacklisted mail
servers usually fail to deliver the messages, as they will
be blocked by the mail server at the receivers end.
◦ Once a mail server is on a blacklist, removing it from
the list might take a while.
◦ A mail server is blacklisted in case it is used to send out
spam mails. This usually happens when the mail server
is compromised due to incorrect or faulty conﬁguration.
• Time consuming maintenance.
◦ Backups are mandatory and data recovery must be
guaranteed.
◦ All updates must be tested in advance.
Even the smallest changes can render the mail
server dysfunctional.
◦ Finding a problem in case the server is malfunctioning,
is difﬁcult.
Assuming that emails can no longer be received by
other users; where should you start to look for the
problem?
These are just but a few of many issues, illustrating how
complex the operation and maintenance of a mail server is.
Please consider whether it is worth the risk and the time
hosting a mail server by yourself. There are a lot of companies
offering low-priced email services with included maintenance,
antivirus checks and spam ﬁlters.
The easiest and safe way to a mail server is though a
email service provider!

C. How should I set up / operate a mail server myself?
Intent: This pattern elucidates the available options to
secure your own mail server.
Problem Statement: Secure communication and data in-
tegrity are very important and highly valued in digital com-
munications. Imagine that your email end up in the recipient’s
spam folder, or even worse, it will be blocked by the recipients
mail server before it even reaches the in box. Whether your
mails will be blocked before they reach the destination or not,
is usually decided by the security and conﬁguration of your
own mail server.
Scenario: An mail address using the domain name should
has to be set up by you. How can you set it up a secure mail
service on your own server?
Solution: Before you start to setting up your own mail
server, please read the pattern Should I set up or operate
a mail server myself?” [18]. Setting up and running a mail
server is time consuming and complex.
Deﬁnition of Terms - SMTP is the acronym for Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol. This protocol is used to send or receive
emails from different mail servers. IMAP and POP3 are
transmission protocols used to retrieve emails from a mail
server.
In case a mail software is already installed on the server,
step 1 can be skipped.
1. Install an email software application on the server
- Independent of the mail application which will be used,
following points need to be clariﬁed in advance:
37

PATTERNS 2019 : The Eleventh International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

• Check whether your server meets the requirements for the
software you intend to use.
◦ Only one SMTP application per server is recom-
mended.
• Pay attention to possible incompatibilities.
◦ Remove previous SMTP applications completely, be-
fore installing a new one.
• Use only SMTP applications that are general available.
◦ Applications handling any kind of communication
should always be kept up-to-date.
It is recommended to use the IMAP protocol when re-
trieving the emails from the mail server. IMAP synchronizes
the client (mail program on the smartphone or computer)
with the server, when the client connects to the server. This
synchronization allows other devices and applications to catch
up to the most recent status. Therefore, you will not see already
read emails as unread.
2. Securing the mail server -
Following points should always be kept in mind:
• NEVER use the default settings when setting up or
securing a mail server.
• Immediately change the default passwords.
• Change passwords in regular intervals (especially admin
accounts).
◦ More information regarding passwords can be found
in the pattern ”How do I secure a web shop and what
should be taken into consideration?” [19] please refer
to the sections ”Solution” and ”Examples”.
• All settings, conﬁgurations and functions should be tested
before applying them.
• The functionality and security of the mail server has to
be tested regularly.
After installing the mail server - please check your
conﬁguration and adjust the options as listed below to
increase the security:
• Activate Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer
Security (TLS) encryption.
• Deactivate SSLv2 and SSLv3.
• Activate SMTP-AUTH.
• Activate TSL encryption for incoming and outgoing
emails.
• Reduce the number of possible connections to mitigate
DDoS attacks.
• Decrease the number of failed login attempts.
• Use DNS-blacklists to intercept spam mails.
• Use reverse DNS LookUp to verify the sender.
• Activate SPF (Sender Policy Framework).
• Create local blacklists. In case it is necessary to block
IP-addresses manually.

of your email transfer. However, in order to use the same
certiﬁcate make sure, that the mail server is using the
same domain (e.g., example.com) as your website and
not a sub domain (e.g., mail.example.com)
• Change DNS MX entry (record) of the mail application
from @mail.example.com to @example.com in order to
get it working.

D. How do I secure a web shop and what should be taken into
consideration?
Intent: This pattern explains which aspects you need to
keep in mind if you want to designing a good web shop
focusing on security.
Problem Statement: Online shopping is getting more and
more important. With its growth, the number of users accounts
on e-commerce platforms exploded. Nowadays web shops, e-
commerce places and other web presences with a lot of users
are popular target for cyber criminals.
Scenario: Creating and setting up an online shop is quite
simple with the right guides. Keeping the website and customer
data safe however, can be challenging. Storing customer data
safe and secure should be the highest priority!
Solution
Maintaining and operating an online shop is a lot of
work. The recently introduced EU GDPR has strengthened the
rights of customers. Thus, if you want to avoid any problems
especially legal ones - consider to consult a professional web
developer for the creation and maintenance of a web shop.
Attention: This pattern is not a legal advice! We
addressed the GDPR (https://www.dsb.gv.at/gesetze-in-
osterreich [ger]) and applicable data protection regulations
during our research for the patterns, however, we are no
legal advisors, nor are we lawyers or privacy experts. We
shall not have any liability whatsoever for the accuracy,
completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the
provided information.
If you still want to run a web shop by yourself after
this warning, please pay attention to the following points:
GDPR - As the owner and operator of a web shop, you
have to design and set up the shop in a GDPR compliant way.
Some of the changes are simple and require only the addition
of business information and contact details on your site, other
changes may be technically more challenging. Please consider
visiting this side https://www.wko.at/service/wirtschaftsrecht-
gewerberecht/AGB im Internet - im Detail.html [ger] in or-
der to get informed on what information you have to provide
to your visitors to be GDPR compliant.
Encrypted Communication - It is absolutely necessary to
encrypt the communication with your web shop. Especially if
you offer direct payment options on your site. The encrypted
communication is used to ensure data integrity.
Data and System Security - The GDPR requires you to keep
your system up-to-date! The data security on the systems has
to be guaranteed.
Shop certiﬁcates and quality seals - Shop certiﬁcates and
seals of approval create trust in the web shop. These certiﬁcates
suggest the customer, that the web shop meets certain quality
standards (e.g., data security, etc.). Many trusted certiﬁcate
or seal of approval providers check the website and the
associated system, before they evaluate them. Depending on
different factors, they decide whether the web shop is worthy
of receiving a seal of approval or a trusted certiﬁcate.
Secure Passwords - Most of the time users are required
to create an account, before they can order from a web
shop. During the account creation process, they usually have
to pick a password. It is recommended to aid the users
during the password creation process, persuading them to use
stronger passwords. Recent studies show a longer password (8
characters or more) is much more secure than a password with
less characters (even when they are using special characters).
The following rules can be set as an requirement to
persuade users to create a stronger password:
• The password should contain at least one uppercase and
lowercase character.
• One special character is required.
◦ , ( , ), =, !, etc.
• Avoid simple words, birthday dates, names or repeated
letter sequences, such as:
◦ asdfasdf, 123456, Heinz1, 12.10.2019, 121212, Super-
man
• Minimum length should be 8 characters.
Examples
Safety Aspects - How to set up an SSL/TLS encrypted
communication on a website is explained in the pattern ”How
do I encrypt the communication with my website?” [20]. As
a web shop works with personal data (e.g., names, addresses,
banking information, etc.) the safety of this data has to be
assured. The following patterns explain how to assure this:
What contributes to the security of a website? [21], When
and how should I create backups? [6], How do I store data
securely? [22], Which data am I allowed to save? [23], and
What information do I have to provide to visitors of my
website? [24].

Data Informative - The GDPR gives individuals a right
to be informed about the collection and use of their per-
sonal data. If a user requests his personal data, the op-
erator of the site has to provide the request informa-
tion within one month. More Information concerning this
topic can be found here: https://www.dsb.gv.at/fragen-und-
antworten#Wie beantworte ich ein Auskunftsersuchen
Password meter for secure passwords - The following
Figures 123 show a password meter indicating the strength
/ security of a password depending on length, characters used
and complexity. Figure 1 uses a password with more than the
required six characters, however it is considered weak due
to lack of complexity or the use of repeated strings, such as
”abcdabcd”. The approach in Figure 2 is better compared to
the password shown in Figure 1, thus, it can be considered
as a medium strength password. Even though the password is
shorter, it may contain numbers apart from standard characters,
making dictionary attacks more difﬁcult. Figure 3 displays
how a password meter would indicate the use of a strong
password. A strong password should be at least 8 characters
long, containing uppercase and lowercase characters, as well
as numbers and special characters if possible.

Figure 1. Password strength comparison - weak

Figure 1 indicates that the password is longer than the required
6 characters, but a repeated string may have been selected (e.g.,
”asdfasdf”), making the password less secure.
Figure 2. Password strength comparison - medium
medium
In Figure 2, the password is shorter compared to Figure 1.
However, it meets the minimum of the required 6 characters.
Since it meets the requirements and probably uses numbers
apart from characters it is considered more secure but not
overwhelmingly safe.

Figure 3 shows a much longer password using more characters
as required and therefore, the most secure password out of the

CONCLUSION
The patterns presented in this paper are interdependent and
based on one another. The ﬁrst pattern explains the necessity
of updates for secure systems and offers recommendations for
handling the update routine. This knowledge is the basis for
the subsequent patterns in this work, addressing the set up /
operation of a mail server, as well as security improvement of
web shops, as they rely on safe, secure and up-to-date systems
in order to keep the personal data of potential users safe and
secure. While these patterns can address only a fraction of
possible problems and questions that may occur during web
development, they selected the most common ones, with the
aim to provide applicable solutions and examples for them.
Future work will focus on the extension of the problem list,
while keeping the existing patterns updated to ensure the
validity and usability.
