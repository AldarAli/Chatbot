Abstract—Inertial and magnetic sensors are nowadays avail-
able as integrated components in common portable devices
(smartphones and smartwatches). Despite the continuous reduc-
tion of cost and size, their application to the body kinematics
is not quite widespread in the consumer market. The main
obstacles are the system calibration and setup, in terms of
time and complexity. Magnetometers are hard to handle in
indoor applications due to inconsistent magnetic disturbances;
and the calibration of multiple units can be challenging for non
technicians. In order to overcome those limitations, we developed
a fast custom magnetometer-free calibration easily reproducible
by non technician, to be used in our novel smart clothes [1] (the
electronics is fully integrated in the clothes), for applications
targeting the consumer market.

I. INTRODUCTION
Real time human motion tracking has a wide potential
in many application ﬁelds, e.g., tele-rehabilitation, sport per-
formance assessment, ergonomics [2]-[5]. The gold standard
for 3D motion capture (MoCap) is the marker-based opti-
cal tracking system. However, those systems can only be
used in laboratories with specialized technician, after a time-
consuming set-up. These are the reasons why inertial sensors-
based motion capture has gained huge popularity in the last
few years. In particular, triaxial gyroscopes and accelerometers
based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMSs) are
often integrated together to form Inertial Measurement Units
(IMUs); if magnetic sensors are included, they are called
Magnetic Inertial Measurement Units (MIMUs). MEMS IMUs
are cheap, small, self-contained, light weight and easy to be
worn. The orientation of the body segments (and thus the joint
kinematics) can be estimated by putting those sensors on the
body segments of interest. Sensor fusion (SF) and segment to
sensor (STS) calibration are crucial phases that strongly affect
the overall system outcome [8]-[9]. Through SF algorithms the
IMU orientation is estimated by fusing the angular velocity,
acceleration and the magnetic ﬁeld. However, the magnetic
disturbances, especially indoor, can lead to inaccuracy; be-
sides, to properly calibrate multiple magnetometers might be
too challenging for non-technicians. For what concerns the
STS calibration, there is the need for a compromise between
the accuracy and the usability by non-technicians. To ﬁnd this
compromise, we developed a magnetometer-free calibration
of our smart clothes (shirt and pants with STMicroelectronics
inertial sensors integrated, [1]) that can be used at home by
non-technicians, once provided with a few instructions.
II. TURINGSENSE CALIBRATION
Turingsense smart clothes (Fig. 1) contain 16 STMicro-
electronics LSM6DSR inertial measurement units (triaxial
accelerometers and gyroscopes, [8]), are fully washable and
come in different sizes. They are chargeable via micro-USB
and have fully wireless communication.

The deﬁnitions and the computational procedures needed to
obtain the information of the motion of body segments starting
from sensor readings (angular velocity and acceleration) are
deﬁned as biomechanical protocol. In particular, the main
objective of the biomechanical protocol is to perform the
sensor to segment calibration. The biomechanical protocol

used in the Turinsense garment (Fig. 2) has two main steps:
(1) N-pose; (2) functional motions [9].
(1) Step 1: N-pose. The ﬁrst step consists in asking the user to
stand still in N-pose (neutral pose). For each IMU, the acquired
accelerometer data is averaged to estimate the vertical direc-
tion. This averaged accelerometer vector represents an estimate
of the anatomical longitudinal direction of the underlying body
segment. Moreover, the information from this step is used for
the navigation reference frames alignment.
(2) Step 2: Functional motions. The second step consists in
asking the user to perform two functional motions: one for
the (a) upper body and the other for the (b) lower body.
(a) Upper body: a 90-degrees humeral ﬂexion in the sagittal
plane, keeping the elbow and the wrist extended, with neutral
elbow pronation.
(b) Lower body: a 90-degrees femoral ﬂexion in the sagittal
plane, keeping the knee locked.
During the funcional motions, the recorded gyroscope data is
transformed to unit-norm vectors to identify the axis on which
the sagittal motion occurs. The average of the normalized
gyroscope vectors represents an estimate of the anatomical
medio-lateral direction of the body segment where the sensor
is attached. [9].

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The Turingsense smart clothes are currently sold in USA
and Canada since December 2019. Thus, it is possible to
analyze the success rate of the STS calibration among real
users. The data stored in the Turingsense cloud database are
used for both an inter-subject and intra-subject analyses of the
STS success rate at the ﬁrst try.
The STS success rate among 45 real users is reported in
Table I (one trial per user), including single steps and whole
procedures rate.

The attemps are detected through speciﬁc motion detection
algorithms. It is noteworthy that the number of N-poses
attempts might include poses where the user had not started to
follow the instructions and, thus, not really trying. It explaines
the slighlty minor number of successes of the N-pose phase.
In addition, an intra-subject analysis is proposed in Table II,
where 8 trials per user have been considered to evaluate the
intra-subject success rate of the STS on the ﬁrst try (i.e. each
STS step is performed once).

IV. DISCUSSION
Results on real user scenarios demonstrate that the calibra-
tion steps implemented are easy to perform by non-technicians,
and the given instructions allow the user to reach MoCap
rapidly. Furthermore, the availability of smart clothing largely
simpliﬁes the approach and the acceptability of the user to the
technology.
V. CONCLUSION
The TS inertial system calibration has been developed to
be used with TS smart garment, the ﬁrst consumer clothes
with electronics fully integrated. Based on the data, the TS
calibration appears to be easy to perform by non-tecnician
people, thus highlighting the huge potential to apply this
technology to a variety of ﬁelds, such as, digital health, ﬁtness
tracking, etc.
