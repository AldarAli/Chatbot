Abstract—Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been applied
in many ﬁelds such as military, trafﬁc management, natural
disaster prevention and assistance, and agriculture. Due to their
characteristics, they are natural candidates to integrate the
Internet of Intelligent Things (IoIT), a network composed of
devices that are autonomous and mobile and have both sensing
and action taking capabilities. The insertion of UAVs into IoIT
infrastructure brings new dimensions to UAV applications and at
the same time introduces new challenges. In this paper, we outline
some opportunities and challenges brought by the insertion of
UAVs into IoIT.

INTRODUCTION
Due to the development of processing, sensing and com-
munication technologies, many once simple devices are now
able to perform more complex tasks and communicate with
other devices or systems. This is the base of the Internet of
Things (IoT) paradigm, whose core concept revolves around
ubiquitous, uniquely identiﬁable everyday objects equipped
with sensing, networking and processing capabilities that com-
municating with each other to achieve a common goal [1][2].
The IoT paradigm is being applied in several study ﬁelds; it
is easy to ﬁnd in the literature many applications in healthcare,
industry, smart farms and cities, environmental monitoring
and others. In some cases, application-speciﬁc networks are
considered IoT branches, such as the Internet of Vehicles [3]
or the Internet of Mobile Things [4]. The Internet of Intelligent
Things (IoIT) is said to be composed of devices that are
autonomous and mobile and have both sensing and action
taking capabilities [5].
Popularly known as drones, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) are natural candidates to integrate with IoIT. Their
integration with other vehicles and systems enables more
complex missions, in which acquired data is up-to-date and
intelligent actions can be taken either remotely or locally in
cooperation with other devices — all with remote supervi-
sion. This integration, however, brings new challenges to be
addressed regarding public safety and privacy, standardisation
and technical aspects.
In this paper, we present some UAV applications that can
be boosted by being integrated with IoIT, as well as new
opportunities brought by connected UAVs, and challenges
that need to be addressed so that the integration can be
done seamlessly. Section II brings background information
on UAVs and IoT. Section III present some related work.
Section IV presents the opportunities in inserting UAVs into
IoIT. Section V outlines some challenges that arise by UAV
and IoIT integration. Finally, Section VI presents the paper
conclusion.

BACKGROUND
In this section, some background concepts covering Un-
manned Aircraft Systems, Flying Ad hoc NETworks and the
Internet of Things are presented.
A. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)
UAVs are gaining popularity in both military and civilian
segments, with the technology being successfully used in
applications such as surveillance, disaster control and response,
infrastructure and environmental monitoring, among others.
Usually, an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) is composed
by UAVs, the Ground Control Station (GCS) and the commu-
nication links [6][7]. Despite UAVs being usually considered
resource-constrained devices, they also beneﬁted from technol-
ogy development and are now able to provide more complex
functionality that lead to more sophisticated missions.
In recent years, the use of multi-UAV solutions in civilian
applications has increased [8] since it presents numerous
advantages. Multi-UAV systems have higher scalability (larger
covered area) and survivability (the mission can still be per-
formed even if one UAV fails), usually complete missions
faster than a single UAV and have lower acquisition and
maintenance costs [8][9][10].
Establishing efﬁcient communication in a multi-UAV sys-
tem, however, is a major challenge. Opposed to single-UAV
systems, in which the communication can easily be done
through a GCS or satellite connection, multi-UAV systems
that use the infrastructure for inter-vehicle communication can
experience disturbances in link maintenance due to environ-
mental conditions or terrain topology, and the mission target

area is limited by the network coverage. Therefore, an ad hoc
approach is generally applied for multi-UAV systems, forming
a Flying Ad hoc NETwork (FANET) [11][10].
B. Flying Ad hoc NETworks (FANETs)
An ad hoc network is a collection of nodes forming
a temporary network with no infrastructure or centralised
administration that is able to operate stand-alone or connected
to the Internet. When nodes are mobile, the network is called
MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork). In this case, network
topology is dynamic and may change as the nodes (or routers)
move. If nodes are vehicles, the network is called VANET
(Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork), and, if vehicles are UAVs, the
network is called FANET.
Even though they may seem similar, FANETs have some
characteristics that differ them from other types of ad hoc
network [10]. Firstly, node mobility is usually much higher in
FANETs due to node moving speed. Also, nodes in a FANET
are usually kilometres apart and may have their course altered
due to UAV movements, environmental changes or mission
updates, resulting in a very uncharacteristic mobility model.
All these facts contribute to a more frequently topology change
due to UAV loss or UAV injection or even because of varia-
tions in the communication link/channel quality. Finally, some
FANET protocols may need accurate localisation data faster
than the one provided by a GPS (Global Positioning System).
In these cases, the UAV must have other means to acquire
this information (for instance, an Inertial Measurement Unit
— IMU). Also, when considering small UAVs, computational
capabilities and power consumption constraints must be taken
into account. Routing and administration protocols must be
energy-efﬁcient to prolong the network lifetime [8].
C. Internet of Things (IoT)
Even though the Internet of Things theme has been vastly
explored over the last few years, it still lacks a wide-accepted
deﬁnition. The general idea of IoT is a large amount of
everyday objects pervasively integrated in our environment,
equipped with identifying, sensing, networking and processing
capabilities, and able to communicate among themselves in
order to complete a common task [1][2]. This results in a very
distributed network system composed by entities that both pro-
vide and consume data from the physical world through sen-
sors and actuators [12]. The application realm of IoT is really
large, including areas such as health-care, smart environments
(smart homes, factories or cities), environmental monitoring,
and disaster alert and recovering [1][2][13][14][15].
Different technologies are involved in enabling IoT sys-
tems. Identifying techniques are crucial for uniquely address
each connected device, ensuring the identiﬁcation reliability
and persistence. Communication technologies in general play
a major role in these applications. New protocols and network
strategies are necessary so that devices with both power
and computational resources constrains can be integrated into
the IoT. Middleware systems will be necessary to make the
abstraction of all devices or things and make them available
to users and applications. Also, it is expected that IoT systems
will generate a large amount of data, making data storage
a key technology for IoT and Big Data strategies essential
for knowledge extraction [1][16][17]. Cloud platforms are
being considered an important part of IoT systems and have
gained interests in research recently [16][18]. The merge of
IoT with cloud computing provides easy access to virtually
unlimited processing and storage capabilities on demand and
at a low cost, enhancing IoT scalability and performance
[13][18]. Given its portability, the cloud is very suitable for
IoT architecture, being able not only to aggregate, analyse
and distribute collected IoT data continuously and securely
but also to remotely manage and control systems. Moreover,
it can concentrate services from different providers and bring
them to the users in an easy, intuitive way [13][19].
Considering the amount of aspects and technologies in-
volved, it is not surprising that IoT technology also comes
with many challenges. Scalability can be considered a very
onerous task given the large number of connected devices.
How to locate, identify, authenticate, use and maintain them
in a reliable manner is a hard problem to solve [12][16][20].
Interoperability issues will also arise due to a variety of devices
supporting different protocols and platforms, or very resource-
constrained devices that do not support any communication
protocol. These problems must be considered by both de-
velopers and manufacturers since system inception so that
device integration is done without compromising performance
[12][16]. Data sharing policies among different applications
also have to be considered. Deciding which data will be
available to which application, as well as who has the higher
priority has to be done carefully in order to ensure system
trust and avoid application conﬂicts [12][20]. The lack of
standardisation of both architecture and protocols is a major
obstacle for IoT implementation, preventing both universal
integration of devices — creating a “Babel Tower Effect”
among them — and the creation of a competitive market
in which all-size players can provide quality products for
customers [16]. Security and trust of communication and
data are a key challenge to address not only to guarantee
system functionality, but also to have it accepted by the
general public [12][16][20]. The integration with the cloud
also brings its own challenges: the cloud must support a
large number of users, providing at the same time real-time
responses that meet system requirements; be prepared to deal
with contextual and non-structured data, as well as resource-
constrained devices and unreliable connectivity; and offer easy
means for developing and deploying IoT applications. Data
and communication security must also be addressed, as well
as standardisation of IoT-supporting architecture, and device
virtualization [16][17][18].
III.
RELATED WORK
The integration of UAVs and the Internet/cloud is a fairly
recent research topic and is primarily focused in providing
UAV telemetry information though a cloud platform or a
service-oriented architecture that virtualizes UAVs and make
them accessible through a cloud/IoT infrastructure. Some
examples are discussed in this section.
In [21], a cloud-supported UAV application framework
in which a client hosted at the UAV responsible for image
acquisition, which are sent to a server in the cloud for image
processing and data storage. The results are sent to a control
centre to be evaluated by a human operator.
Authors in [22] propose an emergency-management ser-
vice. A cloud platform manage UAVs that can be invoked by
threatened citizens through a smartphone app. When the UAV
reaches the person, a real-time video streaming is provided to
security authorities, which can remotely operate the UAV in
order to assess the danger and take necessary actions.

ICAS 2017 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems

In [23], a cloud-based architecture for mission control
called Dronemap is proposed. The cloud infrastructure is used
to realise UAV virtualization and perform resource-demanding
computations. In this architecture, the user requests a mission,
performed by one or more UAVs selected by the user or
automatically by a cloud manager. While the mission is being
executed, relevant data are reported real-time to the user.
Authors from [24] present a framework to offer UAV as a
Service (UAVaaS), in which UAVs are hired by a different
set of users trough an Internet interface to execute a task.
While waypoints and video feeds are available to the users,
control and navigation functionality are handled by UAV’s
on board ﬂight controller. A cloud coordinator handles all
communication between the users and UAVs in order to
provide better security and optimize resource usage.
In [25], the authors propose a technique to control UAVs
using the Cloud — the user inputs only the state of the
ﬂight (for instance, altitude, direction and speed) and the
system makes the necessary control adjustments so that user
requirements are met. The communication between UAVs and
the cloud is made by the remote ground station, which has
the ability to connect to the cloud through Internet and to the
UAVs using a wireless communication link (radio system).
Authors in [26] propose an UAV-Cloud platform in a
Resource-Oriented Architecture in which UAVs act as servers
whose resources can be accessed by APIs, applying a broker
architecture for scalability. A proof of concept is provided
using Arduino devices as UAVs and RESTful APIs to access
their resources.
The work presented in [27] present a softwarization of
the network so that the UAV infrastructure is decoupled from
control. A controller layer virtualizes the infrastructure to the
higher layers, while an orchestration layer manages the mis-
sion. A loosely coupled architecture is used to connect UAVs
and sensors, with a middle layer managing the cooperation
between the two.
IV.
UAVS INTO IOIT: OPPORTUNITIES
So what happens when we integrate UAVs into IoIT and
connect them to the cloud? First of all, UAVs will have at
their disposal the virtually unlimited cloud processing and
storing capabilities, allowing the use of smaller, cheaper UAVs
in missions. One must be careful, however, about how much
processing will be done within the cloud. Processing primary
tasks as obstacle avoidance remotely will bring a latency for
the system not acceptable for aircraft [28]. Therefore, the cloud
must be used for tasks that demand high computational power
and can afford a quasi-instantaneous response.
Also, UAV telemetry and captured data will be available to
the user through the cloud, making new data readily available
and enabling real-time operations and decision making from
any location. Thus, the cloud can also be used for the execution
of machine learning techniques and algorithms, improving the
overall operation by using the acquired experience.
The connection of UAVs will also be boosted. Aircraft will
be able to communicate among themselves and share data,
network resources, and services even with no line-of-sight
(LoS), enhancing UAS collaboration and cooperation.
UAVs are likely to be considered as systems of systems.
Every internal aircraft module necessary to ﬂy (e.g., motors,
actuators) or perform missions (e.g., cameras, thermal sensors)
can be considered a single system. Such a view leads to a next-
level-approach where every aircraft module is a thing on an IoT
network that is fully capable of providing real-time information
and take actions. The UAV can be considered a network of
things (1st order) connected to the IoIT infrastructure, and
the UAV itself would also be a node on the IoIT network
(2nd order). Moreover, such modules can be considered not
simply things, but also smart and intelligent things that can be
connected as an independent network node and even provide
cloud-based services to users nearby, e.g., local sensing, com-
putation and decisions capabilities or remote resources. That is
a potential achievement that inherits important characteristics
from the ﬂy by wireless paradigm [29].
The integration of UAVs and IoIT and the consequent UAV
availability to other systems in real-time can enhance UAV
performance in many situations, as described in this Section.
Moreover, the possibility of moving a set of sensors (such as
a vehicle) to an area that lacks in IoIT coverage will provide
more precise services delivery, improved Quality of Service
(QoS) and better sensors positioning.
Regardless of the application, UAVs as intelligent things
are able to perform self-diagnosis in order to verify whether
they are capable of performing the required task or providing
the requested service. If unexpected events during the mission
generate failure or unavailability, the IoIT redundancy offers
replacement possibilities.
A. Emergency Applications
Emergency situations are always a trial for the city infras-
tructure. In some cases, the situation happens in an area of
difﬁcult access, delaying the emergency personnel response
and in some cases jeopardising the victim’s medical care. IoIT
can improve emergency response by integrating UAVs and
other devices in emergency situations.
UAVs in particular can be used to perform a ﬁrst assess-
ment sense and detect victims, specially in areas of difﬁcult
access such as mountains or very large areas like the ocean.
Once the victim is located, the UAV can send through IoIT
infrastructure the precise victim location to the emergency
response team together with video feed for a quick evaluation
of the situation. If needed, the same UAV or a different one can
be used to deliver supplies such as bottled water or ﬁrst-aid
resources for immediate use until emergency personnel arrives.
Victim rescue can also beneﬁt from IoIT. The UAV posi-
tioned near the victim can send weather conditions and terrain
topology data so that the emergency response infrastructure
can decide in advance if the rescue will be done by air or
ground, optimising the emergency resources usage. In case of
ground rescue, the UAV can also scout the area in order to
identify blocked roads and other access difﬁculties, aiding the
team to decide which path to take to reach the victim.
UAVs and other IoIT participants can also be used to
improve the communication network in case it suffered damage
during the emergency. Papers such as [30] and [28] propose the
use of UAVs to build a temporary, mobile network infrastruc-
ture to be used by emergency personnel or the population in
general until communication services are operating normally.
B. Smart Cities Applications
Smart Cities are becoming a topic of great interest in
research. The objective of Smart Cities is to provide better
quality of life with efﬁcient infrastructure at reduced costs
by integrating multiple assets such as transportation systems,
power plants, law enforcement and others [31].

UAVs can perform several tasks in a smart city when
connected to the IoIT. They can monitor in real-time the city
infrastructure such as power lines, bridges, roads and railroads,
reducing maintenance costs. Law enforcement can also be
aided by patrolling, monitoring crowds or following a person
of interest during a chase. They can also monitor the trafﬁc
ﬂow and communicate the Intelligent Transportation System
(ITS) about road accidents, as well as providing video images
for emergency personnel. Finally, UAVs can also function as
network infrastructure for city areas in which the connection
link is limited, integrating them to the rest of the city and
expanding the range of smart services.
C. Industry & Retail Applications
Industries have a lot to beneﬁt from IoIT and its inter-
face with other connected devices. The integration of smart
machines in smart factories, smart storage facilities and smart
supply chains will allow to automate the entire product chain,
from production to delivery. For instance, a smart storage can
detect if the sales of a particular product have increased and
trigger a higher production so that this speciﬁc product is
always available. In retail, smart supply chains will be able to
provide real-time information for both suppliers and costumers,
increasing the efﬁciency and customer experience.
In industries, UAVs can be used for real-time supervision
of outdoor areas of the factory or for infrastructure inspection
such as building structures or transportation ducts in oil and
gas industry. When considering retail, UAVs are already being
used in delivery of goods for major players such as Amazon
[32], and can provide great customer experience by notifying
the delivery and allowing it to be supervised in real-time.
D. Smart Farm Applications
Smart Farms also have great beneﬁt potential from IoIT.
The use of autonomous vehicles together with ubiquitous
sensors for planting, monitoring crops and cattle and harvesting
can increase efﬁciency of production by reducing its costs.
Figure 1 presents examples of smart farm applications such
as: (A) Surveillance in real-time; (B) Services integration; and
(C) Identiﬁcation of unexpected issues.
UAVs in particular can be used in many different ways in a
smart farm [31]. UAVs can monitor farm borders for intruders
or wildlife predators, promptly sending an alert for farm owner
and calling law enforcement through IoIT infrastructure if
necessary or dispersing the animals before they damage the
crops or cattle. Monitor tasks can also extend to ﬁelds and
cattle conditions, triggering suitable actions if a problem is
encountered. They can also search for missing cattle and
inspect the farm infrastructure such as silos or barn roofs.
In plantation process, UAVs have been used for chemicals
spraying, which can be optimised by the use of soil data
gathered by IoIT connected sensors in the ground.
E. Government Applications
Border protection and surveillance is a task performed
by different means, from human surveillance to walls and
monitoring cameras. With the use of IoIT, this task can be
automated and performed by unmanned vehicles (ground,
aerial and aquatic) in cooperation, responding real-time to a
remote control station that can perform the necessary protocol
when an anomaly is detected. Speciﬁcally, UAVs can also be
used to monitor forests and areas of environmental protection
to identify problems such as forest ﬁre or areas of illegal
logging and notify the competent authority so that proper
actions can be taken.
F. Vehicular Sensors as a Service
The integration of mobile objects (ﬂying, driving, ﬂoating,
rolling, diving, walking, etc.) to IoIT networks will provide
means of moving sensors to the right place at the right
time. That leads to the possibility of enabling modules as
potential providers of cloud-based real-time services to nearby
networks and users, improving targeted information delivery.
This approach has great potential on providing ﬂexible intelli-
gent mapping, efﬁcient goods delivery, and search and rescue
services with high precision.
G. Environmental monitoring
Environmental monitoring is another promising domain for
unmanned vehicles connected to the IoIT. There is a growing
necessity to monitor great barrier reef or pole ice regarding
climate changes. The application of Unmanned Underwater
Vehicles (UUV) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) di-
rectly connected to satellites or somehow supported by UAVs
will provide IoIT connectivity that can improve such activities
with real-time information and services both ways.
V.
UAVS INTO IOIT: CHALLENGES
As seen before, the integration of UAVs into IoIT brings
a lot of opportunities. However, there are many challenges
that need to be overcome — some of them well known by
the unmanned vehicle community, others emerging due to the
connection of vehicles to an infrastructure such as IoIT. In
general, these challenges are classiﬁed in three categories:
public safety and privacy, standardisation and technical.
A. Public Safety and Privacy Challenges
Conﬁdentiality issues regarding the data acquired by UAVs
is a major concern — particularly if there is critical information
being collected — and will play a starring role in public
acceptance of the technology. There is a tendency to store as
much data as possible into the UAV main memory in order to
ensure availability [33], which ends up being a critical security
weakness [34]. If the UAV is stolen or has its control taken, it
can be used as a gateway to probe sensitive information from
the secured network it is authenticated in. IoIT could improve
security by transferring sensitive data to the cloud. However,
providing data distribution in a secure manner on UAVs or
other resource-restricted devices is another challenge.
89

ICAS 2017 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems

Another concern for the general population would be
snooping — a UAV can take unauthorised video or photos
and share them online, making them nearly impossible to
be removed and very difﬁcult to identify the perpetrator.
It is likely that governments will enact legislation to UAV
registration and to prevent privacy invasion, as done in some
states in the US [35]. Moreover, providing vehicular sensors as
a service will increase risks, leading to the demand for more
precise information security approaches.
B. Regulation & Standardisation Challenges
Certiﬁcation is a must for insertion of UAVs into the
airspace and prevent the technology of being used for nefarious
purposes, such as physical assault, drug smuggling and others
[36]. UAV safety plays a major role in this regulations, since
a UAV out of control can cause damage to property or harm
people. Because of that, many regulation agencies such as FAA
[37] and EASA [38] have started to regulate the UAV market.
As with IoT, standardisation is also a major challenge for
IoIT, and must involve both the industry and governments.
From a technical point of view, standardisation is necessary to
ensure all devices are able to communicate, preventing a “Ba-
bel Tower Effect” in which devices become split into disjoint
subsets (for instance, all devices from the same manufacturer)
that can only talk to others from the same subset. From a
social and economic point of view, standardisation will favour
the entrance of small and medium companies in the market,
stimulating entrepreneurship and competition, beneﬁting the
ﬁnal customer and spreading the use of the technology.
C. Technical challenges
There are many technical issues in UAVs being integrated
into IoIT. For starters, UAVs are resource-constrained devices.
Hardware and software design must take into account limited
memory, storage and processing capabilities, as well as a
limited power source. Thus, algorithms and communication
protocols must be as energy-efﬁcient as possible. This aspect
demands a local intelligence to decide how to partition compu-
tation and data over local and remote resources that can also be
temporally unreachable because of wireless connection outage.
Also, IoIT will be formed with a variety of devices devel-
oped for various platforms and using different communication
protocols, which can lead to compatibility and interoperability
issues. Furthermore, the inclusion of vehicular sensors as
things on the IoIT network will increase the complexity of the
entire system, since the communication links can be performed
directly from sensors belonging to different vehicles. This het-
erogeneity will also extend to the acquired data, that will most
likely be non-structured. How data is gathered, distributed,
stored and recovered has to be planned carefully in order to
ensure real-time and security requirements.
Apart from certiﬁcation, there is also a rising concern
with GPS security. GPS spooﬁng attacks have become more
frequent. Such attacks can cause the aircraft to completely lose
control, which is a very critical issue. The GPS spooﬁng may
help attackers to hijack UAVs, another issue that is strongly
related to man-in-the-middle attacks.
Security is always a challenge in any communicating
system and relate to all other aspects aforementioned. Lim-
ited resources demand efﬁcient security algorithms that do
not compromise performance or resource/power consumption;
heterogeneity deﬁes the idea of implementing a global security
policy for all devices and data storage must also be covered
by security in case the communication is interrupted or the
physical integrity of the device compromised. Therefore, se-
curity solutions must permeate all layers of the architecture —
reducing the breaches throughout the layers will consequently
reduce the overall chances of attacks to the network.
Safety is another important aspect for the devices, which
must be able to determine the “health” and the authenticity of
both its internal and external components [11] — something
even more challenging if the internal components are also
connected wirelessly.
VI.
CONCLUSION
IoIT is a network composed of autonomous and mobile
devices equipped with both sensing and action taking capabil-
ities. UAVs are natural candidates to be integrated into IoIT,
which enable a new degree of collaboration between devices
and real-time supervision of missions. One promising oppor-
tunity is the use of vehicles and sensors as services allowing
a better integration of all things, leading to an environment
composed by everything, updated every-time and available
everywhere. This integration, however, introduces new chal-
lenges to be addressed regarding public safety and privacy,
standardisation and technical aspects. Despite the challenges,
the integration of UAVs into IoIT is a promising research topic
with high chances of applicability. In this paper, we presented
how UAV integration to IoIT can improve applications, as well
as the current challenges.
By proposing solutions to the identiﬁed challenges, the
development of IoIT integrated with autonomous vehicles
should be facilitated in order to achieve relevant advances in
this research area. Moreover, the challenges presented here
are only a sampling of potential issues that might be faced
in this new paradigm. Besides the number of challenges, the
several different missions and applications pointed out that can
be performed in the near future are exciting. This is why not
only the military but also the civilians, the academics, and the
industry are enthusiastic about novel uses and applications of
autonomous vehicles and IoIT.
