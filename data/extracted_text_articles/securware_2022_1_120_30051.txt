Abstract—The European Union’s Green Deal and other similar
regulations advocate to reuse batteries of electrical vehicles
(”second life”) to reduce greenhouse gases. To ease the assessment
of the best fitting second life applications for a distinctly used
battery, product life cycle data plays an important role. A digital
battery pass will be mandatory for future batteries and will
contain such data collected throughout the product’s life cycle.
Having trustworthy data is one key element of the battery pass
in order to provide authentic batteries. This paper presents a
concept to securely bind the pass to the battery itself by using
physical unclonable functions for creating a unique identifier
per battery. The approach is based on certificates and makes
use of Certificate Transparency to foster trust in the issued
certificates. Attacks on product life cycle data or certificates and
counterfeiting batteries can be detected.

parency; electric vehicle battery; battery identity; battery pass.
I. INTRODUCTION
The European Union’s (EU) Green Deal aims to reduce
greenhouse gases towards net-zero emissions by 2050 [1]. One
of the measures is to lower the use of fossil energies in the
transportation sector. Electrically driven vehicles foster this
goal and are expected to achieve high sales numbers in the
upcoming years: The Faraday Institute forecasts a worldwide
demand of more than 5,900 GWh in the year 2040 (2020: 110
GWh) [2]. The rise of Electrical Vehicles (EV) is accompanied
by an increasing need for high voltage batteries. However,
batteries degrade during usage and charging. They can only
be used in an EV until their capacity degraded to 80% [3] [4].
This will result in a large number of dismounted and unusable
EV-batteries having a negative economical, ecological and
social impact [5]–[7]. However, these batteries may be still
fine for other use cases. To support recycling and reusing of
products and materials the EU introduced the Circular Econ-
omy Action Plan containing the reuse of batteries as one pillar
[8]. Its goal is to set up applications for a battery’s second
life either as complete product in a different environment or
dismantled in new products.
The new mass market for EV batteries will also encourage
the production of counterfeit batteries. Non-certified or non-
qualified batteries can introduce safety risks due to deviations
from specifications of genuine products and especially due
to cost-savings in risk reducing controls and management sys-
tems [9]. Reduced capacity and lifetime, overheating, and self-
ignition, as well as social aspects like underpaid workers and
bad working conditions during manufacturing are examples
for likely effects when using counterfeit EV-batteries.
Circular economy and the fight against counterfeiting em-
phasize a need for authentic batteries: Trust in the battery’s
quality, evidence in the correct implementation of the specifi-
cation, and traceability of the product life cycle enhance the
opportunities for second life applications and lower the risk
of introducing low quality and dangerous products into the
market.
Both, the readiness for circular economy and the circulation of
only high-quality batteries, shall be regulated within the new
and as of today drafted EU-regulation about the treatment of
(old) batteries [10]. The proposal presents a digital battery
pass as a record of manufacturer, materials, and specifications
of every single battery. This paper presents an approach to
inherently bind the digital pass to the physical battery by using
certificates based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF).
Physical Unclonable Function: A PUF uses physical devi-
ations that occur during production to create a unique and
unclonable identifier [11]. It is described as a challenge-
response-pair (CRP) where a device to be authenticated needs
to prove the ownership of the PUF-identifier. There are two
different types: weak PUFs always provide the same identifier,
strong PUFs can create multiple identifier. An example for
a weak PUF is the SRAM-PUF which takes advantage of
the cells’ random behavior after powering whereas an optical
PUF where randomly distributed particles on a surface are
illuminated from different directions creating unique shadows
is an example for a strong PUF [12]. PUFs are used as an
computational and financial inexpensive alternative of storing
cryptographic keys or identifier in non-volatile memory [11].
Certificate Transparency: Certificate Transparency (CT) was
originally developed by Google and is about transparent and
trust-worthy issuing of certificates used in the Web PKI [13].
It is summarized in the experimental RFC 6962 [14] and
deals with the difficulties of trusting Certificate Authorities
(CA) in general: private keys associated with a certificate may
be stolen or created in a wrongful way such that encryption

itself would not be damaged but an attacker might be able
to decrypt the communication without knowledge of the the
necessary key. A common way to check the trustworthiness
of CAs is to examine audits. However, audits often check
for formal aspects only than for a correct implementation of
technical processes.
The idea of CT is about storing certificates in publicly
available append-only logs that can be validated by everyone.
Figure 1 shows the steps needed to implement CT: The owner
of the domain requests a certificate by the CA which creates
a pre-certificate and sends it to the log. The latter is managed
as a Merkle Tree [15]. A Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)
ensuring that the certificate is added to the log is send to the
CA. The certificate is extended with the SCT and transferred
the domain owner. From this time on, the domain owner can
use it as normal certificate, e.g., for hosting websites. At the
end user’s site, the certificate is checked for the existence of
SCTs, e.g., during TLS handshake. Some internet browser
require that the certificate is signed with at least two SCTs.
The certificate logs are checked periodically by external
monitors. The domain owner is informed if there are new and
especially odd activities with certificates of its domain.

Furthermore, there are other methods for detecting counterfeit
products, e.g., by statistical measures [16], physical inspection,
or electrical examination [17]. However, the presented concept
is triggered by the EU regulation concerning the battery
pass and therefore, the concept of logging and auditing is
reasonable.
The remaining paper is structured as followed: Section II
describes related work as a basis for a concept for authentic
batteries which is introduced in Section III. Current and future
activities are summarized in Section IV.
II. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, the idea of a digital product pass
for single products is unique to batteries. Other applications
do have static product records or they are only implemented
for a group of products and not for single devices, e.g., like the
International Material Data System (IMDS) [18], the Building
Information Modeling (BIM) based Material Passport [19], or
the Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) Passport [20]. Additionally, the
battery pass will be the first pass that is required by law. The
following related research results introduce only comparable
parts of the presented concept.
A. PUFs based on batteries
In [21], Bosch describes the calculation of PUF identifiers
out of a set of different parameters: pressure drop between
two sides of the battery, the batteries natural frequency, the
temperature pattern, the open circuit voltage (OCV) or the air
leak rate [21]. The created PUF identifier is saved as a physical
tag on top of the battery or in the battery management system’s
memory. However, the identifier can only be calculated in
a dismounted state. This method shows the possibility of a
battery PUF creation in general.
[22] presented a method to authenticate an outstation in a
distributed energy storage network. This work takes advantage
of the fact that the cells’ voltages differ at the same state
of charge (SoC). Both, the outstation and the master station,
sanitize a challenge-reply-table with continuously updated
measurements presenting a model of every cell. The authen-
tication challenge is formed out of a selection of cells. The
SoC and the voltages are measured and sent back to the master
station. If the actual measurements match with the values in the
challenge-reply-table the outstation is accepted as authentic.
Both works demonstrate that it is feasible to use PUFs on bat-
teries. However, existing works use the PUF as a mechanism
to create an identity. We want to extend this to use the PUF
as a derivation for cryptographic keys.
B. Blockchain with PUFs
A common mechanism to implement digital product passes
is the use of blockchain [23] [24]. Casino et al. described
a blockchain as ”distributed append-only timestamped data
structure” [25] where no central and trusted authority is
involved. Exchanging assets, digital or physical, between two
blockchain participants is achieved and recorded with transac-
tions. They have to be validated by other participating nodes
using a consensus algorithm in order to prevent corruption
or forgery of branches. Blockchains in the sector of supply
chain management can increase trust, traceability, transparency
and accountability. They are installed for better visibility and
enhanced optimization of a supply chain. [25]
PUFChain is a method that combines blockchain with PUFs
within the Internet-of-Everything (IoE) domain where trusted
77

nodes authenticate IoE-data collected from client nodes [26].
The process is divided in three phases: During the enrollment,
the client’s PUF-CRP are calculated and stored in a secure
database. The phases of transactions consist of data collection,
PUF response generation, and hashing of both. The data
and the hash is added to the blockchain and needs to be
authenticated by trusted nodes. These nodes recalculate the
hash by using the client data and the pre-calculated PUF
response retrieved from the database and validate the block
if both hashes match. An application of PUFChain in the
Internet-of-Energy can be found in [27].
An approach to enable trust in supply chain by tracing was
presented in [28]. Newly manufactured devices need to be
registered in a blockchain with a unique ID, e.g., a PUF.
Device transfers are recorded in the blockchain. The con-
tractual ownership alters only after a transfer confirmation
which is done by calculating the unique device ID of the
received device and comparing it with the ID mentioned in
the transaction payload. End users can check the device’s
authenticity by matching the computed ID with the blockchain
content.
Whereas blockchain is a popular method for storing tamper-
proofed data, we decided to use a different approach. In our
opinion, the system consists for trusted partners. Therefore, a
decentralized distribution of data is not necessary. A database
can be hosted, e.g., by the EU enforcing the battery reg-
ulations. Another aspect is that in this specific application
consensus algorithms are useful only to a limit extent as it
will just provide a proof of formal attributes of transaction but
not on the transaction content itself: For example a blockchain
party validating a new block cannot check the correctness of,
e.g., a new temperature maximum or a degradation of capacity
as it does not have access to the battery itself.
III. CONCEPT FOR AUTHENTIC BATTERIES
A. Introduction
The general aim of our method is to have one single source
of truth containing information about the battery’s life cycle
including the manufacturing process, product acceptance tests
(PAT), measures of quality control, and the usage history.
Tracing materials and processes foster consumer’s trust in the
battery and enables an easier assessment of the batteries’ status
for recycling or reusing.
The data of the life cycle record is stored in a database that can
be permissioned in order to control and restrict read and write
access of supply chain parties involved. Access control also
protects the parties’ intellectual property (IP). It is mandatory
to have a secure binding between the life cycle record and
the battery itself ensuring the correspondence between both.
The secure binding is established by the use of certificates
in combination with PUFs that provide unique identifiers for
each battery.

B. Data for battery pass’s records
Data is added to the battery pass during manufacturing,
product testing, and quality controlling. At end user level, the
data is needed to emphasize a remarkable downgrade of, e.g.,
the state of health (SoH) or capacity and to record minimum
and maximum temperatures, voltages and currents. The latter
are important to assess the batteries health for a second life
application. The data acquisition building the life cycle record
is split into three phases (see Figure 2).
Assembly and initial product testing takes place during the
production stage at the battery OEM (original equipment
manufacturer). Information about manufacturer, working con-
ditions, date of production, and results of acceptance tests are
stored in the battery pass. Afterwards, the battery is transferred
to the vehicle’s OEM to be built into the intended vehicle.
Again, information about the vehicle manufacturer, working
conditions, and the vehicle including the vehicle identification
number (VIN) are stored in the record.
We are assuming the car to be delivered to the consumer
directly after production. At this stage the battery will be
used in its intended environment. Significant changes of the
battery’s quality will be logged to the life cycle record. These
changes include temperature, voltage and current maxima and
minima and SoH and capacity downgrade. This information
will ease the battery’s assessment before entering the second
life.
The preparation of the second life is divided into two steps:
First, the battery is dismounted from the vehicle and the date
and the implementing company are stored in the life cycle
record. The activity of entering the second life contains events
like firmware updates, quality tests and maintenance activities.
Again, the battery will be transferred to a consumer. We
assume an environment in which the life cycle record can be
sanitized. Therefore, the stage of the second life equals the
consumer stage.
The format of the battery pass’s data is not defined inhere.

However, the JSON data format may be reasonable as it is
widely used and easy to read and process.
C. Security Considerations
With the presented concept the following security related
aspects shall be considered: The battery pass and its records
shall be bound to the battery in order to state out that these
records are only valid for this specific battery. Manipulation of
the battery pass has to be detectable as well as the circulation
of counterfeit batteries having no or stolen battery passes.
Updates of the records shall only be possible from the battery
itself or from a system that has access to the battery. This
ensures the validity of the data without the possibility of
data added by a third-party not involved in the process. Trust
and transparency shall be treated to foster the battery pass’s
acceptance by the user and in general a successful assessment
of second life applications.
D. Security Architecture
The technical implementation of our method is based on
signed battery data whereas the keys are derived from the
battery’s PUF. Figure 3 shows the overall process of adding
data and verifying the battery’s identity. We are assuming the
private and public key derived from the PUF already exist. As
elaborated in the related work section (Section II), this is a
reasonable assumption.

Three phases are applicable:
The most functional part of the method is adding and updating
data of the battery as it is described in Sec. III-B. If new data
is generated it will be sent to a central database containing
historic and current data of each battery (Figure 3a). In
the battery the data is signed with its private key. Only
the signature is added to a battery specific certificate also
containing the public key. If a certificate already exists for the
battery a reissuing is needed and the old one has to be revoked.
The certificate itself is attached to an append-only log. We
are relying on Certificate Transparency which is a commonly
used method developed by Google to store and handle identity
certificates in a trusted and verifiable way. Whereas the log
itself does not fulfill any functional requirement, it provides
additional trust and transparency into the certificate as it can
be validated from external and public parties.
One could argue to add the battery data to the certificate
introducing the advantage of having one single document
containing all relevant information about the battery. How-
ever, having this, the battery’s data is publicly available and
therefore, IP may be revealed as well as the opportunity for
malicious analysis about production statistics and performance
of a battery OEM. A dedicated database can be restricted to
a reduced number of users.
In order to check the validity of the data in accordance with the
corresponding certificate, access to the data and the certificate
is needed. Using the public key stored in the certificate the
signatures can be verified (Figure 3b). In this context, another
opportunity to avoid disclosure of IP may be possible by
letting the signatures be checked by the database itself and
letting it deliver a summary of data not revealing IP.
In the third phase, it is checked that the certificate belongs to
the battery as described in Figure 3c. Therefore, a challenge-
response-mechanism is used where the user sends a challenge
consisting of random number encrypted with the public key
to the battery. The challenge is decrypted using the battery’s
private key and the response is sent back to the user. If the
response equals the original random number it is verified that
the certificate belongs to the battery as the private key is
directly derived from the battery’s PUF.
To reduce the risk of stolen or reproduced keys by an attacker
the derived key may be stored in a Hardware Security Module
(HSM), e.g., placed on the Battery Management System
(BMS). However, the cost-efficiency of HSMs in the context
of industrial applications with large quantities having high
pressure on costs has to be evaluated [29].
E. Challenges
The main challenge of the presented method is the derivation
of keys from the battery’s PUF. It is required that the keys do
not change over time. However, due to aging of cells and the
battery pack the PUF and therefore, the keys may change. The
validation steps mentioned above cannot be executed anymore
resulting in a failure of the complete method. The same applies
79

for genuine repairs or maintenance activities of the battery.
Single cells will not be exchanged probably, but battery packs.
This would result in a new PUF and so in invalid existing
private and public keys.
To overcome both, two approaches might be appropriate: First,
using a model forecasting the cell and battery aging in order to
create static cryptographic keys. And second, if an imminent
change is foreseeable having a mechanism to modify the
existing keys, e.g., with pre-calculated challenges and a hash
chain for tracking expired keys.
Instead of using the battery’s cells to create unique identifier
one could also use the surrounding electrical components as
origin for physical unclonable functions. The entropy might
be enough to create cryptographic keys as there are many
components built in one battery pack. These components do
not age in the same way as cells do.
Challenges also arise in the general use of the battery pass.
Standardization across companies is mandatory to enable
comparability of batteries. This also applies for the update pro-
cedure of the battery pass. Questions concerning the frequency
and the resolution of record updates have to be answered.
F. Security Analysis
In the following section it is analyzed if the presented concept
complies with the requirements stated in Section III-C.
Attack Model: We assume that the attacker has read and
write access to the database. As the certificates are stored
publicly following the methods of Certificate Transparency the
adversary can read certificates. However, the attacker cannot
read or re-create the battery’s private key as we assume that
the physical access to the battery and its related components
is restricted.
Binding battery pass and battery: The battery pass and the
physical battery are bound using the cryptographic keys cre-
ated from the battery’s PUF.
Detection of manipulated battery pass: A manipulation of data
in the database will be recognized when the data’s signature
is verified. The verification of the signatures should be a
mandatory step when working with these batteries, e.g., for
an assessment of the second life applications.
However, manipulation or deletion of data can result in finan-
cial and ecological damage as it is the basis for further use
of the battery. If the data is deleted, assumptions based on
statistical measures have to be consulted which may result in
a worse assessment of the state of health.
Circulation of counterfeit batteries: If an attacker duplicates
the certificate in order to sell a counterfeit battery with a
pseudo-valid certificate, the attack may not be recognized until
the link between the certificate and the battery is verified.
Whereas signature for the data is valid, the challenge-response
will fail: The public key of the certificate does not match to
the private key of the battery. Therefore, the decryption of the
response will fail.
Update of battery pass only with access to battery: Records
can be added to the database without having access to the
battery. However, the battery pass, i.e., the certificate can only
be reissued with the record’s signature which is created with
the cryptographic keys derived from the PUF. Therefore, a
valid update of the battery pass is only possible with physical
access to the battery.
Generating trust and transparency: Trust and transparency for
user’s acceptance and for trustworthy assessment of second life
applications is created with the use of cryptographic keys on
the one hand and on the other hand with the use of Certificate
Transparency where certificates can be validated by external
parties.
Several attack scenarios have been described. None of them
can be executed on its own as there need to be attacks
on multiple system parts to be successful. However, it also
showed that a verification of the different links between
certificate, data and battery is mandatory to ensure the system’s
security.
Nevertheless, a complete and in-depth security analysis will
be executed in the future to strengthen the given statements.
G. Efficiency of Data Transfer and Verification
In the current EU project MARBEL (Manufacturing and
assembly of modular and reusable Electric Vehicle battery for
environment-friendly and lightweight mobility) the efficiency
of data transfer with a state-of-the-art BMS has been analyzed
in a Proof-of-Concept. Tests have been made with a frequency
of data transfer ranging from 5 Hz to 200 Hz sending single
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol) mes-
sages. Authentication and encryption was established using
the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol adding a security
related overhead to every message. The average message size
summed up to 90 bytes which corresponded to a measured
maximum data rate of 144 kBits/s. The findings from these
tests appear to support the assumption of an efficient data
transfer. However, a continuous stream of battery data might
not be required as the degradation of the battery’s state of
health is a slow process. Data may be also buffered over a
defined time and sent in blocks.
Data will be verified on servers which can be highly optimized.
Therefore, it is expected that the verification can be carried out
efficiently as well.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Circular economy and the fight against product counterfeiting
increase the need for authentic products. The digital battery
pass is one example for achieving trust and traceability of a
product. The paper presented a concept to manage a battery’s
life cycle record by using certificates. The correspondence
between the batteries identity and the battery pass is achieved
with PUFs constructed of the battery’s physical deviations.
Using the PUF-enabled certificates, it is possible to detect
counterfeit as well as low-quality batteries. Challenges occur
in the consistency of PUFs due to aging and maintenance

issues of the product pass.
Future work includes the implementation of a Proof-of-
Concept followed by a performance analysis and an in-depth
formal security analysis in order to evaluate the functionality
in general and the security measures of the concept. Other
mechanisms for detecting counterfeit electronic products will
be analyzed and might enhance the presented concept. The
consistency of PUFs in the context of batteries will be part of
further extensive investigations.
