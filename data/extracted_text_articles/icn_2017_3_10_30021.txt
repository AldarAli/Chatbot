Abstract—
Recently,
advanced
WSN
(Wireless
Sensor
Network) technologies, such as IoT (Internet of Things) and
M2M (Machine to Machine) are widely applicable to various
fields. On the other hand, in the network protocols of future
wireless networks, it is required to obtain the sensing data
from the summarized monitoring values in the large-scale
WSN, i.e., it cannot be efficiently built based on the current
host-centric scheme. We should redesign based on the content-
centric concept. Under these perspectives, we focus on ICN
(Information Centric Network)-based WSN. In particular, in
this manuscript, we propose a novel off-path caching scheme
by using the overhearing sensing data, and we boost the effort
of
our
off-path
caching
mechanism
by
using
the
SIC
(Successive

technique.
In
the
numerical results, we reveal that the amount of stored sensing
data could increase by using exhaustive Monte Carlo computer
simulations.
As
a
result,
the
proposed
scheme
can
be
maximally 3.69 times as improved as the comparable system
without using any off-path caching method.

INTRODUCTION
A new WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), such as IoT
(Internet of Things) and M2M (Machine to Machine), plays
a primary role in providing global access by using billions of
various devices. In the WSN, the network protocol, as well
as the current Internet infrastructures, are founded upon the
host-centric architecture. In the view of evolving traditional
network
frameworks,
the
ICN
(Information
Centric
Network) architecture is promoting a new communication
model [1]. The ICN architecture is fundamentally different
from the traditional IP address-based and host-centric
network, i.e., a major concept of ICN is the ability to name
data independently from a current location (at which the
required sensing data are provided). The ICN-based schemes
have been investigated not only in the wired networks, but
also in the wireless and mobile networks (including IoT,
M2M and WSN) [2][3].
In this manuscript, we focus on a novel caching scheme
for the important consideration of ICN-based WSN proposal.
Regarding the caching mechanism, there are two common
principles, such as the on-path and the off-path caching
methods [4]. In the on-path caching, the network exploits
information caught along the routing path taken by a name
resolution request; while in the off-path caching, the network
exploits information caught outside those paths. Regarding
the related works for the caching schemes, the traditional
ICN frameworks, such as DONA (Data-Oriented Network
Architecture) [5] and NDN (Named Data Networking) [6]
have natively supported the on-path caching method. The
authors in [7] have proposed four on-line intra-domain cache
management
algorithms
and
[8]
have
realized
an
improvement by using the content-space partitioning and the
hash-routing techniques.
In
particular,
we
focus
on
the
off-path
caching
mechanism. Most researchers have introduced an exclusive
mechanism,
which
popular
contents
are
actively
and
positively replicated. On the other hand, we effectively
utilize the specific wireless feature, such as overhearing
phenomena, i.e., when the sensor node transmits the sensing
data via the wireless link, its neighbor sensor nodes could
receive its
sensing
data due
to
the
free-space radio
propagation regardless of necessary or unnecessary. In other
words, the proposed scheme can realize the effective off-path
caching mechanism without using alternative exclusive data
packets and another wireless communication module. Note
that, although the signal processing for receiving and
decoding transactions need additional energy consumptions,
their electrical power is sufficiently smaller than the radio
transmission power. Therefore, the cost of extra power
consumption could be ignored, unlike the wired network
system.
Moreover, regarding the signal processing of overhearing
transactions, we utilize the SIC (Successive Interference
Cancellation) technique [9] in order to boost the off-path
caching capability. Under the SIC-based system, the receiver
side tries to decode the strongest signal in the parallel signals
from several transmitter sides. If the strongest signal can be
successfully decoded, the decoded signal is encoded again
and is subtracted from the received signal. Thus, the
decoding performance of remaining signal can be improved
by removing the strongest interference. The SIC technique
has
been
extensively
studied
as
the
physical
layer
technology; whereas, its performance and behavior in the
ICN-based wireless sensor network remain unknown, i.e.,
our
study
can
demonstrate
significant
preliminary
evaluations.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the proposed scheme. Section III provides the
computer simulation results. Finally, the acknowledgment
and conclusions close the article.
II.
PROPOSED SCHEME
As shown in Figure 1, the sensor nodes are distributed in
the observation area, and every sensor node measures the
environmental monitoring values as the sensing data. In the
ICN-based system, there is no difference between the
original and replicate information when other sensor node
requests the same sensing data. Therefore, similar to the
traditional ICN studies, the proposed scheme establishes the
data transmission link between the subscriber and publisher
nodes (that is the routing path). We define the sensor node
who transfers and forwards the sensing data along the
routing path as the relay node. According to the ICN
principles, the relay nodes store the forwarding data into
their cache memory as the on-path caching transaction in
order to effectively respond to the sensing data in case of a
duplicated scenario.
On the other hand, regarding the SIC method, let ܲ௜,௝
denote the signal strength at the ݆-th sensor node (that is
receiver node) based on the overhearing processing from the
݅-th sensor node (that is a relay node) and let ℳ௝ denote the
set of concurrent transmitting sensor nodes that can be heard
by the ݆-th sensor node. If the signal from the ݅-th sensor
node to the ݆-th sensor node can be decoded correctly, ܲ௜,௝ is
satisfied with
ℋ: 
௉೔,ೕ
∑
௉ೖ,ೕାఙమ
ೖಯ೔
ೖ∈ℳೕ
≥ߚ (1) 
whereߚ is the power level of required received signal
threshold andߪଶ is the power of ambient noise, respectively.
In short, (1) indicates that the ݆-th sensor node can store the
replicated data of the ݅-th sensor node, if the SINR (Signal to
Interfealance plus Noise Ratio) is sufficiently large.
As shown in Figure 2, letݕ denote the ݆-th sensor node’s
received signal strength, which is expressed as
 ݕ=∑ܲ௠,௝
ெೕ
௠ୀଵ
 
(2) 
whereܯ௝ is the amount of ℳ௝’s elements. In the proposed
scheme, the decoder works to recover the strongest signal
among the input signals (such as the received signal in the
first transaction). Therefore, the ݆-th sensor node tries to
decode the signals based on (1), the received signal can be
decoded correctly if and only if

whereܭ denotes the number of successful decoded signals,
ݕො௞ andݕ௞ denote the correct decoded signal and the
reconstructed transmission signal based on the decoded
signal, respectively. In (2) and (3), we assume that bothݕ௞
and ܲ௠,௝ are non-decreasing order asݕଵ ≥ݕଶ ≥ ⋯ ≥ݕ௄ and
ܲଵ,௝ ≥ ܲଶ,௝ ≥ ⋯ ≥ ܲ௄,௝, respectively.
If we realize the SIC mechanism as shown in Figure 2,
we should formulate the detailed protocol design. However,
its consideration is out of scope because of analyzing the
principal
evaluation
in
this
paper.
In
particular,
the
considered scheme (with the above terms) should adaptively
switch based on the sensor node status, such as not only
transmission and receiving modes but also the overhearing
mode, which is our future works.

NUMERICAL RESULT
Regarding the radio propagation model, we ignore the
multi-path
fading
and
shadowing
to
avoid
system
complexity. Therefore, the received signal strength can be
calculated based on
 
ܲୖଡ଼ = ܲ୘ଡ଼ −ܮ୘ଡ଼ +ܩ୘ଡ଼ −ܮ୔+ܩୖଡ଼ −ܮୖଡ଼ (dB) 
(4) 
where ܲ୘ଡ଼ and ܲୖଡ଼ are the electrical radio powers,ܮ୘ଡ଼ and
ܮୖଡ଼ are the circuit power losses, andܩ୘ଡ଼ andܩୖଡ଼ are the
antenna gains at the transmitter and receiver terminals,
respectively. We determine the above parameters (without
ܲୖଡ଼ andܮ୔) based on the familiar XBee RF module [10]. As
shown in Table I, we illustrate the simulation parameters
(including above constant values). Note that, the circuit
losses at transmitter and receiver sides are not taken into
account to avoid system complexity, which occurs in case of
the impedance mismatching and power losses at physical
circuits as the thermal noise.
In (4),ܮ୔ is the radio-wave attenuation, which we can
calculateܮ୔ based on the ratio propagation model [11] with
ܮ୔=ܣ+10ߛ logଵ଴(݀/݀଴) 
(5) 
and
ܣ=20 logଵ଴(4ߨ݀଴/ߣ) (6) 
and
ߛ=ܽ−ܾℎ଴ + ܿ/ℎ଴ 
(7) 
where ݀ is the distance between sensor nodes,ߣ is the radio
wavelength, ℎ଴ is the antenna height, and ݀଴, ܽ, ܾ and ܿ are
the constant values depending on the surround environments
(see Table I) that are given by [11].
In the computer simulation, the sensor nodes are
randomly scattered and the pair of publisher and subscriber
nodes is randomly selected. The routing path between the
publisher and subscriber nodes is decided based on the
minimum physical distance. For eliminating the calculation
costs, we utilize the Dijkstra’s algorithm [12] (whose

algorithm can obtain the optimal path to minimizing the
weight links). Regarding the SIC method, we calculate the
signal strength based on the distance among sensor nodes,
and we assume that the SIC mechanism are ideally
conducted and worked.
Figure 3 shows the number of sensor nodes, ܰ, versus
the ratio between the sensor nodes that can correctly store the
overhearing data and the overall sensor nodes,ߩ. As a result,
ߩ is improved depending on increasing of ܰ, because of
increasing
the
sensor
nodes
that
can
store
with
the
overhearing
transactions
due
to
increasing
a
densely
deployment. In the case when 170 ≤ ܰ region,ߩ maintains a
constant value because of reaching the upper limitation. In
comparison with the comparable scheme (without using the
off-path caching method), our scheme can improve by 251%,
284%, 341% and 369% at ܰ = 50, 100, 150 and 200,
respectively.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a novel caching mechanism
with the overhearing phenomena and SIC techniques for
ICN-WSN. Computer simulation demonstrated that the
proposed scheme could have a maximum of 3.69 times
improvement over the comparable scheme. In future works,
we should consider the detailed protocol design, and
demonstrate and discuss under a realistic environment.
