Abstract — The accurate force measurement is a problem of a 
great importance in industry, research and society because of 
extremely wide range of force relating applications. Over the 
last decade, increasing attention has been paid among the 
National Institutes of Metrology (NMIs) worldwide in 
measurement of small forces, which play a more important 
role in micro or nanotechnology and other significant areas 
(medicine, energy, environment). The equipments used to 
make such measurements must have metrological traceability 
to a realization of SI unit of force, within the required 
uncertainty. In this respect, the NMIs have started to study 
methods for completing a hierarchy of SI-traceable force 
metrology at low force level. As it is known, one of the ways to 
achieve traceability route to SI units for force measurements is 
through the definition of mass, length and time. For this 
purpose, the known method for force calibrations or 
measurements is the use of deadweight machines, based on 
masses suspended in the Earth’s gravitational field (force 
generated by a known mass in a known gravitational field). 
Another way for measuring small forces is based on the 
comparison of a force transducer with the indication of a 
balance, 
which 
works 
on 
the 
Electromagnetic 
Force 
Compensation (EMFC) mode. Starting from these two 
methods, the Mass laboratory of National Institute of 
Metrology (INM) from Romania considered it necessary to 
extend the dissemination of mass unit below 1 mg, in order to 
meet current needs in the field of small forces measurements. 
In this respect, the article deals with the provision of mass 
calibrations for low force measurements, consisting in (1) 
calibration of micromass standards having nominal values 
between (100…500) µg, corresponding to approx. (1....5) µN, 
and (2) metrological characterization of a weighing instrument 
that works on the principle mentioned above and has a 
resolution of 0.1 µg (corresponding to approx. 1nN). 
 
Keywords – micromasses; low forces measurement; deadweight 
machines; mass comparator; traceability.

 INTRODUCTION  
Accurate measurements play a key role in all industrial 
activities, from research - development to the marketing of a 
product, being able to say with certainty that what cannot be 
measured, cannot be produced. 
That is the reason why "the metrologists" are 
continuously involved in the development of new 
measurement 
standards, 
new 
technical 
methods 
of 
measurement, to conceive new tools and procedures to meet 
the growing demands in improving accuracy, increasing trust 
and speed of measurements. 
In this time of flourishing nanotechnology research, the 
measurement of micro/nano forces becomes more significant 
in industry, research and society because of extremely wide 
range of force relating applications. 
Given that some tests in different fields need to measure 
low forces, relevant test systems must be traceable to the 
masses smaller than a milligram. 
In this respect, the development of the technique for 
micro-mass measuring is highly vital for MEMS (Micro-
Electro-Mechanical Systems) and NEMS (Nano-Electro-
mechanical Systems) applications and also, for providing 
traceability to the SI units (International System of Units, 
international abbreviation SI) for such measurements. 
The extension of dissemination of mass scale below this 
limit represents the basis of micro/nano force measurements 
being required by industries such as pharmaceutical, defense, 
environmental 
monitoring, 
energy 
production 
and 
transportation, etc. 
The calibration of these micromasses was carried out for 
the first time in Romania, at INM.  
In a first stage, were calibrated two sets of micromass 
standards belonging to INM (having foil shape) and after 
that, in a second stage, these weights were used as check 
standards for calibration of other micromass weights having 
wire shape. In the paper, only the second stage of this 
calibration is presented. 
The article is divided into six sections as follows: 
introduction, a short description of the methods used for 
force measurements, equipments and micromass standards 
used in calibrations, evaluation of standard uncertainty in the 
calibration of the weights, assessment of ultra-microbalance 
used for low force measurements, and conclusions.

 METHODS USED FOR FORCE MEASUREMENTS. A 
SHORT DESCRIPTION 
Currently, there are three main methods used for the 
force measurement [1]: 
a) Mass balance, where the unknown force is balanced 
against a known mass using a digital weighing instrument. 
The gravimetric calibration by using mass standards is 
much more accurate (with two orders of magnitude) than by 
using force measurements based on the dependence of some 
electric, magnetic, acoustic or optical parameters variation 
with the applied load; 
b) Force balance, i.e., balancing force via a magnet-coil 
arrangement, called electromagnetic force compensation, or 
by means of Electrostatic Force Balance (EFB);

c) Deflection type transducers measuring the specific 
deformation of an elastic element, e.g., piezoresistive 
cantilever as portable microforce calibration standard. 
By tradition, the traceability route for force measurement 
is the force generated by a known mass in a known 
gravitational field [2]. This force is referred to by the term 
deadweight. Thus, a deadweight force is traceable if a mass 
artifact (corresponding to the deadweight) is available. 
For this purpose are used deadweight force machines 
(considered primary force standards), based on masses 
suspended in the Earth’s gravitational field. The traceability 
is established from a traceable mass artifact combined with 
an accurate determination of the local gravity. 
Another way for developing primary standards based on 
deadweights is to use a balance. This principle is based on 
the comparison of a force transducer with the indication of 
an EMFC balance. The force transducer is pressed in a 
controlled way against the balance and, according to 
Newton’s principle (action equals reaction), the force 
equivalent mass indication on the balance is taken as the 
reference [3]. This way, the mechanical forces applied to the 
transducer can be compared indirectly with the deadweights.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EQUIPMENTS AND MICROMASS  
STANDARDS USED IN CALIBRATION  
A. Weighing instrument 
There are two ways to use a weighing instrument: 
-  As a mass comparator whose measurable properties 
are its sensitivity and/or the mass value of the smallest scale 
interval, measurement repeatability results (determined 
according to measurement cycle used, ABBA or ABA [4]) 
and, if necessary, the effect of the loads eccentrically placed 
(eccentricity).  
In this case, the mass comparators allow only differential 
weighing (the mass comparator gives the difference of mass 
values between the two weights, mass standard and test 
weight); mass 
comparators are used 
only 
in the 
dissemination of mass unit starting from national mass 
standard (with values derived from the International 
Prototype of the kilogram) to the standards of the lowest 
accuracy. 
- As a direct weighing instrument (a common balance) 
whose measurable properties are repeatability of indications, 
the whole range of display scale, built-in weights and, if 
necessary, the effect of the loads eccentrically placed 
(eccentricity)  
In this case, the balance can be used both for differential 
and for proportional weighing (the balance indicates the 
mass of the body placed on its pan, without having recourse 
to mass standards) [5]. 
The weighing instrument used in our research is an 
UMX 5 balance (Mettler fabrication), presented in Figure 1, 
which operates in an electro-magnetic force compensation 
(EMFC) mode, namely the mass of a sample (weighed 
object) is determined by measuring the force that is exerted 
by the sample on its support in the gravitational field of the 
Earth [6]. 
 
 
Figure 1.  
UMX 5 Mass comparator [7] 
As was shown, the UMX 5 can be used as mass 
comparator (for the calibration of the weights), whereas for 
the next stage, in the low force measurements can be used as 
a direct weighing instrument. 
The 
weighing 
instrument 
has 
the 
following 
specifications: 
- maximum capacity: 5.1 g; 
 
- readability: 0.0001 mg. 
B.  Air Density Measurement Equipment   
The mass of an object is obtained by weighing in air. 
Because the weighing instrument indicates a value that is 
proportional to the gravitational force on the object reduced 
by the buoyancy of air, the instrument’s indication in general 
has to be corrected for the buoyancy effect. The value of this 
correction depends on the density of the object (depending 
on the material that is made) and the density of the air [8]. 
A schematic representation of the air buoyancy is 
presented in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  
Representation of the air buoyancy [9]  
The usual method of determining air density is to 
measure temperature, pressure and humidity and calculate air 
density using the equation recommended by the Comité 
International des Poids et Mesures, modified in 2007 [10]. 
The mass laboratory is located in a basement and the air 
conditions are controlled. 
For accurate determination of the air density an 
environmental monitoring system is used, consisting in a 
precise “climate station”, having the following technical 
parameters:

C. Description of the micromasses     
The unknown weights to be calibrated are wire shaped, 
Figure 3, being kept in a protection box, along with a 
handling tool, Figure 4.  
The microstandards have the nominal value between 
(500…100) µg with a classical sequence of (5; 2; 2; 1). 
All the weights are made of aluminum alloy. At this 
moment, this limits the minimum mass of the standard to 
about 100 µg, any smaller mass being difficult to handle.

D. Measurement model   
In the calibration of mass standards, when the highest 
accuracy is required, the comparison by subdivision method 
is mainly used. In short, the comparison consists of 
comparing groups of the same nominal value. These groups 
are performed in several variants, which have the same 
nominal value, variants that are compared between them, 
allowing a control for all the achieved measurements. 
With this method, only one reference weight is used; the 
number of weighing equations should be larger than the 
number of unknown weights and an appropriate adjustment 
calculation should be performed in order to avoid 
propagating errors. In the matrix design, although all the 
micromass are considered unknown, in the interpretation of 
the results, the micromass foil shape belonging to INM, 
constitute also, check standards for the measurement. 
As is defined in [4], a check standard is used in a 
statistical control process to provide a “check” to ensure that 
standards, measurement processes and results are within 
acceptable statistical limits. A check standard is usually a 
weight, which is included in the weighing design as an 
‘unknown’ weight. The control procedure works best with 
weighing designs where the check standard can easily be 
incorporated into the design as an unknown weight [4]. 
Using as reference standard a mass of 1 mg, made of 
aluminum alloy, seven micromass standards are calibrated 
arranging them in ten possible pairs; in the design, as check 
standards are used: 1 mg INM, 0.5 mg INM and 0.1mg INM. 
The calibration data used are obtained from weighing 
cycles ABBA for each yi (which is the weighing comparison 
according to design matrix “X”). 
The comparison scheme can be represented in matrix 
form as follow: 
Y
X
e







where 
      Y (n,1)  is the vector of the n observations (including 
buoyancy corrections); 
      β (k, 1) vector of the k mass values of the standards to 
be determined; 
      X (n, k) design matrix (entries of the design matrix are 
+1, –1, and 0, according to the role played by each of the 
parameters (from the vector β) in each comparison; 
      e (n,1) vector of the deviations ; 
si (n,1) is the vector containing standard deviation of the 
mean value of each mass difference.

The general mathematical model for “y”, corrected

with: 
 
 
Δm

each group of weights) involved in a measurement. 
To estimate the unknown masses of the weights, the least 
square method was used [5] [11]. 
The design matrix “X” and the vector “Y“ are 
transformed in X’ and Y’ respectively. This transformation is 
usually performed when the observations are of unequal 
accuracy (to render them of equal variance). Taking into 
account that such tiny micromass standards are calibrated 
and the scale division of the comparator is very small       
(0.1 µg), any influence, which can affect the results should 
be considered: 
X’ = G∙X  and  Y’ = G∙Y

EVALUATING STANDARD UNCERTAINTY IN THE 
CALIBRATION OF THE WEIGHTS 
In evaluating standard uncertainty associated with the 
results of calibration, the following contributions must be 
taken into account:  
- type A uncertainty: evaluation of uncertainty method by 
statistical analysis of series of repeated observations; 
- type B uncertainty is evaluated by scientific judgment 
based on all of the available information on the possible 
variability of an input quantity that has not been obtained 
from repeated observations. 
A.  Type A evaluation of standard uncertainty. Uncertainty

The standard deviation (uncertainty of type A) of a 
particular unknown weight is given by:

M is the total number of the weights.  
If   y' = X' 

weighing results, the vector of the weighted residuals, e', 
can be obtained from: 
e' = y' - y'

B. Type B evaluation of standard uncertainty  
The components of type B uncertainty are: 
 Reference standard, ur; 
 Resolution of the weighing instrument, ures; 
 Sensitivity of the weighing instrument, us; 
 Effect of the air buoyancy, ub; 
 Effect of the load eccentric placed, uecc; 
 Magnetic proprieties of the weights, uma; 
 Convection effects, uconv. 
All these components are calculated in the same manner 
as in [11] [12].

ASSESSMENT OF ULTRA - MICROBALANCE 
The balance was characterized only in the range 100 µg 
to 1 mg corresponding to the nominal mass of the calibrated 
micro standards. 
A. Tests 
performed 
for 
the calibration 
of 
ultra-
microbalance 
 The calibration of the weighing instrument consisted in 
[13]: 
- applying test loads to the instrument under specified 
conditions; 
- determining the errors of the indication and uncertainty 
of measurement attributed to the results.  
For a load j applied on the pan in an ascending, 
descending, or in combination way, the error of indication 
was calculated as follows:

where Ij is the indication of the balance and mmmj is the mass 
value of the micromass from the calibration certificate.    The 
errors of indication were determined at the next loads: 1 mg, 
900 µg, 700 µg, 600 µg, 500 µg, 300 µg, 200 µg and 100 µg; 
- repeatability test consisted in loading the balance with 
the same load under repeatability conditions, namely: the 
same measurement procedure, same operator, same 
measuring system, same operating conditions and same 
location and replicate measurements on the same or similar 
objects over a short period of time [14]. Repeatability of 
indication was determined at the next loads: 1 mg, 0.5 mg, 
0.2 mg and 0.1 mg. 
- determining the effect of the loads eccentrically placed: 
the load Lecc was applied in an arbitrary order on the pan in 
the positions indicated in Figure 6 (A, B, C, D, E) in order to 
check the influence of eccentrically placed weights on the 
measurement. The eccentricity was performed at 200 µg.

TABLE I.  
CENTRALIZATION OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE ULTRA-MICROBALANCE  CALIBRATION 
 
 
 
Table I contains a centralization of results obtained in the 
calibration of the microbalance in the corresponding range of 
calibrated micromasses.  
 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The aim of the work described here is to provide mass 
calibrations for force measurements below 10 µN by 
extending the mass scale below 1 mg. 
Thus, traceable force can be obtained using mass artifacts 
ranging from (100…500) µg to create appropriate 
deadweight loads. 
Other applications of micromasses are in improving 
uncertainty in determining the indication error and sensitivity 
error of weighing instruments of special accuracy (micro and 
ultra-microbalances). 
In the future, these microweights will become essential 
for 
providing 
traceability 
for new 
areas 
such as 
biotechnology and to meet the current requirements of 
various sectors of health and defense. 
The paper focused on the calibration of weights below   
1mg, carried out for the first time in Romania, at INM. 
Also, a balance with special accuracy (ultra-micro) was 
characterized in a metrological manner for the first time in 
the low range 1 mg … 100 µg using micromass standards. 
Thus, the balance can be used as was described at the 
Section  II. 
Measurement procedures and associated uncertainty 
obtained in the calibrations of the microweights and of the 
balance were presented.  
Currently, the smallest mass standard used in metrology 
is 1 mg. Although in OIML recommendation [4], the 
traceability of microweights to SI units is not identified 
(some referring being made only in the description of the  
 
subdivision method), their calibration gives the possibility to 
extend the dissemination of mass scale below this limit.
