Abstract—A new method in bioinformatics, which is referred to as
3D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences is brieﬂy outlined.
The aim of this work is an application of this method to the
description of the Zika virus genome. We expect to reveal some
new features of the sequences comparing to our previous results
obtained by using the 2D-dynamic representation.

INTRODUCTION
The problem of classiﬁcation is related to the problem of
similarity of the objects. The objects arranged in simple, one-
dimensional sets may be classiﬁed in a unique way according
to a single aspect of similarity. The problem becomes more
complicated if we consider multi-dimensional sets, i.e., objects
characterized by several different aspects. The degree of simi-
larity (classiﬁcation to some particular groups) depends on the
set of selected aspects, on the number of aspects considered
and on the mathematical measure establishing the relations
between different properties.
The aim of the studies is a creation of new bioinformatical
models carrying information about similarity of the DNA
sequences. This information is relevant for solving many
biomedical problems. The inspiration for these studies has
interdisciplinary character.
A sequence is deﬁned as a sequence of symbols. In the
case of the DNA this is a sequence composed of four letters
corresponding to four nucleotides: A - adenine, C - cytosine,
G - guanine, T - thymine.
The starting point in the methods mentioned above is a
DNA sequence represented as a sequence of four symbols in
the 5′ to 3′ direction. In the methods called in the literature
Graphical representations of DNA sequences, the sequence of
symbols is represented by graphs. The aim of these methods is
the creation of both graphs and descriptors representing DNA
sequences in a unique way. It may happen that a method can
not distinguish between two or more different DNA sequences.
In these cases, a nonuniqueness appears, which means that
several different sequences are represented by the same graph
or by the same descriptor. This kind of nonuniqueness in
graphical bioinformatics is called in the English literature
degeneracy.
Nonuniqueness of the description (degeneracy) is an un-
desired feature of the method. Removing this feature may be
difﬁcult in graphical representation methods. The graphs repre-
senting DNA sequences are plotted in two or three-dimensional
space. The sequences are long and are composed of four
different bases. A reduction of such complicated objects to
simple, small, two or three-dimensional graphs corresponding
to the perceptional abilities of humans, without a signiﬁcant
loss of information, is difﬁcult and often leads to degeneracy.
It is also not obvious how to assign nondegenerate descriptors
to such graphs. One of the achievements of the present work
is the construction of methods which are either free of this
uncertainty or the remaining uncertainty is much lower than
in the other formerly known methods.
Recently, we have proposed a new method of comparison
of DNA/RNA sequences, called by us 3D-dynamic representa-
tion of DNA/RNA sequences [1] [2]. This method belongs to a
group of methods in bioinformatics called graphical represen-
tation methods (See for reviews [3]–[5]). These methods allow
for both graphical and numerical comparison of the considered
objects. The sequences are very long, and it is not obvious how
to represent them graphically. Each method reveals different
aspects of similarity, and therefore new approaches are created.
The aim of this work is an application of this method to
the description of the Zika virus genome. We expect to reveal
some new features of the sequences comparing to our previous
results obtained by using the 2D-dynamic representation.

METHOD AND EXPECTED RESULTS
In 3D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences method,
the sequence is represented by a set of material points in a 3D
space [1] [2]. The way of construction of the 3D-dynamic
graph is described in [1]. The examples of 3D dynamic
graphs representing histone H1 coding sequences of plants
and of vertebrates are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
The starting point of 3D-dynamic graphs is the origin of
the coordinate system – the coordinates of this points are
zeros. Each of the bases is represented by a basis vector.
Therefore the dimensions of the graphs and their location
contain information about the number of particular bases and
about their distribution in DNA sequences.
The name of this method (3D-dynamic representation of
DNA sequences) is related to the numerical characteristics
of the graphs (called in the theory of molecular similarity
descriptors), which are analogous to the ones used in the
dynamics, i.e., coordinates of the centers of mass of the graphs,
and moments of inertia of the graphs.

The coordinates of the center of mass of the 3D-dynamic
graph, in the {X, Y, Z} coordinate system are deﬁned as [1]

where xi, yi, zi are the coordinates of the mass mi. Since
mi = 1 for all the points, the total mass of the sequence is
N = P
i mi, where N is the length of the sequence. Then,
the coordinates of the center of mass of the 3D-dynamic graph
may be expressed as

where Ik are the eigenvalues and ωk are the eigenvectors.
The eigenvalues I1, I2, I3 are called the principal moments
of inertia. As the descriptors we select the square roots of the

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In the present work we describe the sequences of the Zika
virus genome using 3D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA
Sequences. Recently, we have obtained some correlations of
the descriptors with time using 2D-dynamic representation of
DNA/RNA sequences [6]. Using the present method, some new
features of the considered objects are revealed.
Summarizing, using graphical representation methods dif-
ferent aspects of similarity of the DNA sequences, can be
considered separately. Only simple objects can be classiﬁed
in a unique way in terms of their similarity. A pair of complex
objects can be similar in one aspect and very different in
another one. Using these methods one can indicate proper-
ties which are identical or very different for the same pair
of the DNA sequences. Graphical representations of DNA
sequences constitute both numerical and graphical tools for
similarity/dissimilarity analysis of DNA sequences. They can
be applied for solving a large class of problems in biology and
medical sciences that require such an analysis.
