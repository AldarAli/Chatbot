Abstract—This paper proposes a censored and ordered sequen-
tial collaborative spectrum sensing scheme for cognitive radio
ad hoc network (CRAHN). The scheme uses the ordered of
the sensing data reliability for enabling the Dempster Shafer
theory of evidence sequential combination. A preceding censored
process removes the nodes having insigniﬁcant sensing data to
the broadcasting sensing result process. The advantage of ordered
sequential and censored mechanism will help to reduces commu-
nication resources (the energy consumption, the coordination and
overhead in control channel and the sensing result collecting time)
while keeping the same sensing performance compared with the
conventional centralized cooperative spectrum sensing.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, Cognitive Radio (CR) which enables op-
portunistic access to underutilized licensed spectrum band has
been considered as a promising technology. Spectrum sensing
(SS) plays an essential role in CR. Among various spectrum
sensing techniques, energy detection is an engaging method
due to its easy implementation and admirable performance.
However, its major disadvantage is that the receiver signal
strength can be seriously weakened at a particular geographical
location due to multi-path fading and shadow effect [1]. In
order to overcome the hidden node problem in which a single
sensing node cannot distinguish between an idle or a deep
fade band, the collaborative SS scheme has been considered
in many literatures (see [2]-[8] for examples).
By utilizing the diversity of distributed sensing data re-
sources based on a fusion rule such as “And rule,” “Or
rule,” “k out of n,” etc. [2][3], cooperative spectrum sensing
(CSS) can simultaneously decrease both the miss detection
and the false-alarm probability of a single sensing node. A
data fusion scheme for CR network based on Dempster-
Shafer theory of evidence (D-S theory) was ﬁrst proposed
in [4]. This scheme shows a signiﬁcant improvement in the
detection probability as well as considerable reduction in
the false alarms probability without any requirement of prior
primary system’s activity information. Nguyen Thanh and Koo
[5] enhanced the D-S theory based fusion scheme in [4] to
obtain a very high gain of combination by utilizing available
primary signal’s SNR. However, such above advantages of data
fusion schemes are at the cost of overhead trafﬁc of control
signaling and sensing results transmission, which consumes
more communication resources such as reporting time delay,
control channel bandwidth and transmission energy. The re-
quirement resources will be extremely large when the number
of CR User (CU) increases. However, only a few works
have considered this problem. Yeelin and Su [6] proposes
a sequential test for CSS to control the average number of
the reporting bits and reduce the mean detection time and
bandwidth. In [7], a data fusion scheme which utilizes a D-S
theory based ordered sequential test for higher efﬁciency (i.e,
lower reporting resources requirement) and faster detection is
proposed. However, all of these sequential fusion schemes not
only do not take advantage of removing the low reliability data
from reporting by a censoring method as proposed in [8] but
also can be only applied for centralized CR networks which
require a data fusion center to control the process of sequential
test.
For the case of CR ad hoc network (CRAHN), due to
the lack of central controller, each CU is responsible for
determining its actions based on its local observation. Since
the CU cannot predict the inﬂuence of its actions on the entire
network only with its local observation, collaboration schemes,
in which the observed information can be exchanged among
devices are essential [9]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider
an effective mechanism for sequential fusion in such the case.
In this paper, we propose a collaborative SS scheme for
CRAHN based on censored and ordered sequential D-S theory
combination. The censored and ordered collaborative mecha-
nism enables the sensing data sequentially to be combined in
a descending sequence of reliability. This will help to reduce
the number of reporting data and the sensing time.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes the system model. Section 3 introduces the col-
laborative spectrum sensing based on D-S theory. Section 4
proposes the censored and ordered collaborative mechanism.

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
We consider a single-hop CRAHN with a dedicated com-
mon control channel (CCC) and multiple CUs sharing the
same frequency band with a licensed system as shown in Fig.
1. In order to increase the reliability of the licensed user (LU)
protection, the CUs, after sensing the spectrum band, exchange
their SS information each other. Therefore, the collaborative
SS model which does not require a central controller will be
adopted into our CRAHN. As a result, the whole process
of SS includes two phase: the individual SS phase and the
collaborative phase. The individual SS for detecting the LUs
signal is essentially a binary hypotheses testing problem as
follows:
(
H0 : x (t) = n (t)
H1 : x (t) = h (t) s (t) + n (t)
(1)
where H0 and H1 are the hypotheses of the absence and
presence of the LU’s signal, respectively, x (t) represents the
received data at the CU, h (t) denotes the gain of the channel
between LU and CU, s (t) is the signal transmitted from the
primary user and n (t) is the additive white Gaussian noise.
The spectrum sensing method is energy detection. The output
of energy detector is the received signal power which is given
by
xE =
XN
n=1 |xn|2
(2)
where xn is the n-th sample of the received signal and
N = 2T W. T and W denote the detection time and signal
bandwidth, respectively. When N is relatively large (e.g.
N > 200), xE can be well approximated as a Gaussian random
variable under both hypotheses H1 and H0, with mean µ1, µ0
and variance σ2
1, σ2
0, respectively [10], such that

µ0 = N
σ2
0 = 2N
µ1 = N (γ + 1)
σ2
1 = 2N (2γ + 1)
(3)
where γ is the SNR of the LU’s signal at the CU.
III. THE D-S THEORY BASED COLLABORATIVE SPECTRUM
SENSING
A. Basic probability assignment estimation
In order to apply D-S theory of evidence to the collaborative
spectrum sensing scheme, the frame of discernment A is
deﬁned as {H1, H0, Ω}, where Ω, called ignorance hypothesis,
denotes either hypotheses is true. After sensing time, each
CU will estimate its self-assessed decision credibility which
is equivalent to Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) for these
hypotheses. The BPA function is deﬁned as a form of the
cumulative density function similar to those in [5] as follows:
mi (H0) =
Z +∞
xEi
1
√
2πσ0i
exp
 
−(x − µ0i)2
2σ2
0i
!
dx
(4)
mi (H1) =
Z +∞
xEi
1
√
2πσ1i
exp
 
−(x − µ1i)2
2σ2
1i
!
dx
(5)
mi (Ω) = 1 − mi (H1) − mi (H0)
(6)
where mi (H0), mi (H1) and mi (Ω) are the BPA of hypothe-
ses H0, H1 and Ω of the i-th CU, respectively. Using these
functions, the BPA of hypotheses H0 and H1 are unique for
each test statistics value xEi and vary in such a way that the
larger xEi is the larger mi (H1) and the smaller mi (H0) are
and vice versa. These values are broadcasted from various CUs
and combined at each CUs to obtain a ﬁnal decision.
B. D-S theory based combination
According to the D-S theory of evidence, the combination
of the BPAs from n sources can be obtained via the following
equations [11]:
m (H0) =
X
A1∩A2∩.An=H0
n
Y
i=1
mi (Ai)
,
(1 − K)
(7)
m (H1) =
X
A1∩A2∩.An=H1
n
Y
i=1
mi (Ai)
,
(1 − K)
(8)
where
K =
X
A1∩A2∩...An=∅
n
Y
i=1
mi (Ai)
and Ai can be one element of the set {H1, H0, Ω}.
A simple decision strategy is chosen; and the global decision
is made while considering the following numerical relation-
ships:
log
m (H1)
m (H0)
 H0
≶
H1
0
(9)
where the ratio m(H1)
m(H0) is considered as the global combination
ratio.

The censored and ordered collaborative mechanism
IV. THE CENSORED AND ORDERED COLLABORATIVE
MECHANISM
As mentioned above, the main problem of D-S theory based
collaborative spectrum sensing as well as other schemes is
the large communication resource requirement for reporting
sensing results, particularly, in a large cognitive radio network.
For this reason, in order to reduce the overhead, the total
processing time and the energy consumption for spectrum
sensing, we propose an censored and ordered sensing data
reliability broadcasting mechanism in which nodes with higher
current sensing datas reliability will broadcast earlier and
nodes with sensing datas reliability lower than a censored
threshold will not report as shown in Fig. 2. The highest sens-
ing data reliability node, which is free after ﬁrst broadcasting
its sensing data, becomes the general node and makes the ﬁnal
decision.
The proposed ordered collaborative mechanism includes the
reservation period and the broadcasting period. In the ﬁrst
period, the CUs make a reservation by utilizing a short burst
signal according to a reservation timeslot RT . Since every CU
can listen to the CCC, the broadcasting time slot position can
be determined according to the reservation burst order.
In details, the reservation period Treserve is divided into κ
reservation timeslots (κ ≥ M, i.e., number of CUs). Each
timeslot length tslot is equal to a slot time, i.e., the time
required by the radio layer for functioning carrier sensing.
After sensing the spectrum band, each CU estimates its
data reliability and conducts a censored process. This means
that the CU will take no action if the sensing data reliability
is smaller than a minimum reliability threshold ηmin. The
selection of the minimum threshold has to guarantee that the
discarded, i.e. lower reliability than ηmin, sensing data have
less signiﬁcant in the contribution to ﬁnal decision if it is used.
After the censored process, the CU whose sensing data
reliability is larger than ηmin will calculate the reservation
timeslot RT according to the data reliability as follows:
RT =
$
ηmax − ηlog
i
ηmax − ηmin
κ
%
(10)
where ⌊.⌋ is a round-down operator and ηmax is the maximum
reliability threshold. The ηmax is selected large enough such
that a reliable ﬁnal decision can immediately be concluded if
the data reliability is a larger than that value.
In broadcasting period, CUs will transmit their sensing data
at the corresponding reserved data timeslot if the ﬁrst part
of the data timeslot, equivalent to a slot time, is empty. In
contrast, if the ﬁrst part of the data timeslot is occupied by a
burst signal, the nodes have to wait for the followed beacon
message which includes the stop broadcasting request and ﬁnal
decision result from the general node.
V. THE CENSORED AND ORDERED SEQUENTIAL D-S
THEORY BASED COLLABORATIVE SPECTRUM SENSING
SCHEME
For broadcasting the sensing result in the sequence of
the data reliability, the i-th CU will make its self-assessed
credibility ratio which is deﬁned by:
ηlog
i
=
log mi (H1)
mi (H0)
 .
(11)
At the general node, the broadcasted BPA is immediately
combined in the sequence as follows:
mk
combined (Hj) = mk−1
combined (Hj) ⊕ mk (Hj)
j = 0, 1
(12)
where k = 1, ..., MC, mk−1
combined (Hj) and mk
combined (Hj)
are the (k − 1)-th and (k)-th combined BPA of hypothesis
Hj, respectively, MC is the total number of CUs joined in the
broadcasting process after censoring and ⊕ is the combination
operator deﬁned based on DS-theory as follows:
ma ⊕ mb (Hj) =
ma(Hj)mb(Ω)+ma(Hj)mb(Hj)+ma(Ω)mb(Hj)
1−[ma(Hj)mb(H1−j)+ma(H1−j)mb(Hj)]
,
(13)
ma ⊕ mb (Ω) = 1 − ma ⊕ mb (H1) − ma ⊕ mb (H0) , (14)
where j = 0, 1, and a and b denote the two arbitrary combining
sources.
Due to the commutative and associative properties of the
D-S theory combination operator ⊕, the combined result of
the sequential CSS scheme will be equal to that of the non-
sequential one as in (7) and (8) when all nodes’ sensing data
are combined as the same time. Therefore, instead of using the
0 as a threshold for the ﬁnal decision making as in (9), the
general node adopts a couple thresholds ±δ where δ > 0 for
comparing the combination ratio. The value of δ is selected
large enough so that the cooperative gain is equivalently
maintained though the number of combined sensing data is
lower. The proposed sequential fusion scheme is based on the
following ﬁnal decision making strategy:

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
For simulation, we assume that the LU signal is DTV signal
whose bandwidth is 6 MHz. 20 sensing nodes with the same
LU signals SNR are in the network. The local sensing time
is 50 µs. Firstly, we consider the inﬂuence of the censoring
threshold ηmin and the sequential test’s threshold δ on the
collaborative SS performance, i.e. the global error probability
as shown in Fig.3. In the ﬁgure, the conventional (CO), the
conventional sequential (CS), the censored (CE), the censored
and conventional sequential (CE-CS), the ordered sequential
(OS) and the censored and ordered sequential (CE-OS) DS-
theory based data fusion are simulated under the same LUs
signal SNR as -15 dB at all 20 CUs. As shown in the ﬁgure, the
error probabilities of all others fusion scheme are converged to
that of CO DS-theory based one when the value threshold δ is
adequate enough (i.e. δ ≥ 8). Furthermore, when the threshold
δ is large the increasing of threshold ηmin in the range [0, 1]
softly reduces the sensing performance.

Fig. 4 shows the average percent of broadcasting number
of CS, CE, OS, CE-CS and CE-OS fusion schemes according
to δ with different values of ηmin under the LU’s signal SNR
= -15 dB at all 20 CUs. The ﬁgure indicates that the number
of broadcasting nodes is low when the threshold δ is low.
Therefore, the selection of threshold δ is a tradeoff between
performance and network overhead. Beside, as shown in the
Fig.4, the average percent of broadcasting number for the same
fusion scheme will decrease when we increase the value of
ηmin. In the case of our proposed CE-OS scheme, at δ = 10,
for example, the average percent of broadcasting number is
65% for ηmin = 0 (i.e., OS scheme), 60% for ηmin = 0.2
and 52% for ηmin = 0.6. This result is fully signiﬁcant if
we note that the SS performance is almost unaffected in the
range from 0.2 to 0.6 of the threshold ηmin at δ = 10 in Fig. 3.
Above all, compared with other schemes, our proposed CE-OS
73

fusion outperforms the other schemes in the same threshold
condition. Indeed, as shown in the Fig. 4, at δ = 10 and ηmin
= 0.6, the average broadcasting number percent is 77% for
CE fusion, 62% for CE-CS fusion and 52% for our proposed
CE-OS fusion.
For further consideration, the ﬁve above schemes are sim-
ulated with different SNR conditions and different threshold
ηmin values while keeping δ =10. As shown in the Fig.5, for
CE fusion, the broadcasting number increases when the SNR
increases. This can be explained by the fact that the sensing
data reliability will be improved when the SNR increases. For
both CE-CS and CE-OS fusion, however, the broadcasting
numbers is reduced when the SNR value increases. Similarly
to previous results the same best performance is obtained by
our proposed CE-OS scheme.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a censored and ordered sequential D-S the-
ory based collaborative SS scheme for CRAHN has been
proposed. The preceding censored process and the followed
ordered sequential fusion not only mantain the same sensing
performance compared with the conventional cooperative cen-
tralized spectrum sensing scheme but also strongly reducing
the collaborative resource requirements such as the overhead
of control channel, the energy and the collecting sensing data
time. For future works, the detail protocol for coordination
between CUs and the timming for making the proposed
scheme precisely work in practice require more research.
