Abstract— We live in a mobile world and usability is an 
important issue for mobile. Considering two mobile websites, 
how can you tell one of them is more usable and user friendly 
than the other one? This paper shows how to make a usability 
evaluation on mobile websites. It covers many guidelines and 
researches offered to designers to make user friendly 
interfaces. In this study, we introduce a usability evaluation 
tool that provides an environment for usability experts and 
describe how we use it in our Guided-Based Usability 
Evaluation Model (GBUEM). This study is aimed to contribute 
to mobile usability area, which is an important and hot topic. 
Keywords-usability; mobile; evaluation; usability guidelines

 INTRODUCTION  
In today's world, the use of mobile website is increasing 
day by day and internet access from mobile devices is 
gaining importance. A substantial part of Web users connect 
internet from mobile devices. Each year there is a huge 
growth in the mobile share of web traffic across the world. In 
the fourth quarter of 2012, 23.14 % of total website traffic 
was generated via mobile devices, while the same number 
was a mere 12.59% in 2011 [1]. Mobile devices have 
advantages compared to desktop computers from the point of 
accessibility and portability. 
Most of the operations that can be done with regular 
websites can also be done via mobile websites, which are 
specifically designed for mobile devices. Success rate of 
mobile website usability is 64%, while the same number is 
58% for regular websites, which are designed for full-screen 
desktop computers [2]. It leads us to the fact that website 
designers should also focus on building mobile websites 
besides regular websites. 
One of the most important problems of mobile Web is 
the usability problem. The mobile Web provides very 
different set of challenges, such as limited bandwith, limited 
input capabilities, small screen size, and no flash script 
capabilities [3].  Because of this, there can be many usability 
problems for the end users. Users can revisit the websites if 
they are satisfied in performing their tasks. To this end, 
increasing mobile usability standards is important for helping 
users to enhance their web surfing experience in mobile 
websites. Usability problems need to be investigated and 
solved in order to make end user more satisfied. In this 
context, we argue that evaluation of the usability of mobile 
websites has significance.     
This paper includes following sections. Section II 
presents the definition of mobile usability and background of 
our study. Section III presents the Guided-Based Usability 
Evaluation on Mobile Websites. Section IV presents the 
practice of proposal methodology. Finally, section V 
presents the future work and conclusion of our study. 
II. 
BACKGROUND FOR MOBILE USABILITY 
A. Usability Definition  
There are several usability definitions. ISO 9241-11 
gives the conventional usability definition. It defines 
usability as "the extent to which a product can be used with 
effectiveness (number/percentage of completed tasks within 
allotted time, number of errors), efficiency (time to complete 
a task) and satisfaction (subjective user attitude) in a 
specified context of use" [4]. 
 On the other hand, usability is defined by five quality 
components by Nielsen Norman Group, which is the leading 
research group in usability [5]. 
 
Learnability: how easy users perform their basic 
tasks in the first place?  
 
Efficiency: how quickly can users perform a task? 
 
Memorability: how easy is to reuse the system after 
a break? 
 
Errors: How many errors do users make and how 
serious are these errors using the interface? 
 
Satisfaction: How do users like the interface? 
B. Mobile Usability Background 
Usability is a key concept in mobile world because in 
mobile world tasks are time sensitive. Mobile websites 
should provide user satisfaction. If a website is not user 
friendly, users may leave the website page immediately. On 
average, the user spends less than a minute on a web page 
[6]. This is a very little time for websites. In order to increase

ICIW 2013 : The Eighth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

this number, websites should be designed based on user 
perspective. 
Mobile devices, which are designed for a specific 
function, can perform additional tasks with some limited 
processing capabilities, wireless network connection and 
memory [7]. Mobile devices have more limitations compared 
to desktop computers. These limitations can cause many 
usability problems. Mobile web usability success rate of 
today is almost the same as the desktop usability success rate 
of 1999. Current desktop usability success rate is 84%, and 
unless its mobile counterpart starts improving rapidly, it will 
not reach that level until 2026 [2]. This demonstrates that 
there is room for research and development in mobile 
usability.  
It is about twice as hard to understand complicated 
content when reading in touch screen based mobile phones 
compared to desktop computers. In this study, the only 
parameter that is accounted for is the screen size, which is 
the reason for lower comprehension score in mobile devices 
[8]. According to this research, it can be concluded that a 
separate mobile version of website should be designed to 
have a better understanding of the content for the user. The 
website should automatically detect the mobile device of the 
user, and divert it to the mobile website [9]. 
Traditional usability methods that are employed for 
desktop computer environments, are not directly applicable 
for mobile environments due to certain mobile specifications. 
New approaches and methodologies should be considered in 
the context of mobile. Mobile devices and mobile 
technologies change rapidly therefore usability evaluation 
methods and guidelines should be revised.  
There are other studies on mobile web environment, 
which investigates the environmental effects on mobile web 
usability, mobile web usability documentation, remote 
usability testing, lab and environmental mobile usability 
testing. Nielsen Norman Group has also two reports on 
mobile web usability [9-12]. Contribution of our study is 
defining a practical way and presenting an environment for 
experts to evaluate a mobile website according to researches 
and guidelines.  
III. 
GUIDED-BASED USABILITY EVALUATION  
In this study, we show how GBUEM can be applied on 
mobile websites in a practical way. In this context, 
guidelines, which make recommendation for mobile websites 
in terms of usability, are analyzed. In the analysis process, 
these guidelines are categorized and list of rule is defined. 
Fig. 1 demonstrates the flow chart for how GBUEM is 
performed.  
A. Usability Standards and Guidelines 
ISO-9241-151 Guidance on World Wide Web User 
Interfaces provides guidance on the human-centred software 
design for Web user interfaces with the aim of increasing 
usability. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Guided-Based Usability Evaluation Model 
 
This standard contains recommendations specific to Web 
interfaces. “Research-Based Web Design & Usability 
Guideline” (RBWDUG) is also not compatible with mobile 
Web 
interface. 
But 
these 
guidelines 
have 
some 
recommendations, which can be applied on mobile websites. 
First part of our study is to investigate and expose these 
recommendations. It is clear that the design of mobile Web 
interfaces or smart devices could require additional guidance 
[13] . 
Second part of our study is to do a literature search on 
guidelines, which are tailored towards mobile websites. 
Nielsen Norman Group’s Mobile Usability Guidelines make 
suggestions for Mobile Web Interfaces. “Usability Of 
Mobile Websites” (UMW) guidance is based on methodical 
observations, interviews, user diaries, as well as in-house 
expert reviews [14]. Their first mobile usability report is 
announced in 2011 and includes 85 design guidelines for 
Improving Access to Web-Based Content and Services 
Through Mobile Devices.  In the following year, there have 
been huge technological improvements in mobile therefore 
requirements for mobile devices have changed. In 2012, 
second edition of mobile usability is announced and the 
number of design guidelines increased to 210 [2].  
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced 
"Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0" guidance. This guidance 
outlines 60 guidelines in ten groups for designers and 
developers to design and deliver content that works well on 
mobile devices. Its main objective is to improve the user 
experience of the Web when accessed from mobile devices 
[15].  
Apple’s IOS Human Interface Guidelines and Android 
Human Interface Guidelines are style guidelines for 
designers who make user interfaces for applications. They 
tell designers how to design user friendly applications 
depending on operating systems. These guidelines are not

independent from the platforms. Main objective of these 
guidelines is to provide consistent design on dependent 
operating 
system. 
They 
commonly 
do 
not 
make 
recommendations for mobile websites, which run on 
different kind of operating systems [16, 17]. 
B. Guided-Based Usability Evaluation Method 
Literature search on guidelines is followed by the 
categorization step. In the categorization step, guidelines are 
grouped according to their focuses. List of rule is created in 
the following categories: accessing, content, homepage, 
typing, links, searching, navigation, forms, menus, logging, 
errors, listing and scrolling, images-videos, information.

All searching guidelines, which are applicable on mobile 
websites, are investigated and a list of searching rules is 
defined. The searching list is broken down into following 3 
rule groups as follows: Search function, search results and 
repeating and refining searches. 
C. Usability Evaluation Tool 
In this study, we have developed an evaluation tool, 
which is coined as Usability Evaluator (UE). This tool keeps 
a database, which is a list of rules, defined during the 
analysis process of usability guidelines. The proposed tool 
provides an environment for usability experts to evaluate 
mobile websites via list of usability rules. Fig. 2 
demonstrates the flow chart for how UE is performed.

Figure 2. UE Flowchart 
 
 
UE has “List Editor” menu as shown in Fig.3. Using this 
menu rules can be prioritized, edited and deleted. Experts 
can use “Site Evaluation” menu to criticize websites 
according to rules. UE can calculate percent of success on 
each rule.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. UE Rule List Editor 
 
In the “Test Management” menu, evaluated websites can 
be monitored. Evaluation statistics can be pulled out 
depending on the website. EU user authorization can be 
defined by using “User Management” menu. 
 
IV. 
GUIDED-BASED USABILITY EVALUATION IN 
PRACTICE 
In this section, we demonstrate practical application of 
GBUEM on mobile websites. We picked 3 mobile news 
websites (News X, News Y, News Z) and 3 usability experts 
from our organization to make the evaluation. 
 
  
In our study, we focused on touch screen based mobile 
phones, which have smaller screens than tablets. This 
evaluation was performed on Samsung Galaxy Note 
smartphone. 
In this practice, weights of the rule categories were 
determined by the usability experts as shown Table IV. 
Weighted category scores are obtained by multiplying 
average category scores and category weights for each 
category.  Total score is the sum of the weighted category 
scores. 
    
Weighted Category Score (WCS) = Weight of the 
Category (W) * Category Score (CS)

                             Figure 6. “News Z” Evaluation Results of UE 
 
In this evaluation, usability success rate of these 3 mobile 
websites are 67%, 71% and 64% eventually. These results 
are very close to the result of Nielsen Norman Group 
participant test, which was 64% [14].   
 
The basic findings in this evaluation are as following: 
 
 
One of these websites does not detect that user is 
connected through on a mobile phone and does not 
direct the user to mobile site.   
 
2 of these websites do not include a link to mobile 
sites. 
 
One of these websites uses "wap" word in the site 
title instead of "mobile" or "m" word. 
 
One of these websites does not include a link to full 
sites. 
 
2 of these websites do not include communication 
information, about link and privacy policy on their 
mobile websites.  
 
2 of the websites do not have search option. Users 
are not able to search news in archive and in other 
sections. 
 
One of the websites plays the video on the full site if 
user clicks on the mobile page. 
 
One of the websites does not include at a link to 
navigation on every page of mobile website. 
 
2 of the websites do not split the list into multiple 
pages and do not show one page at a time. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This study summarized background for mobile usability 
and gave statistics about mobile and usability issues. In this 
paper, we have proposed a methodology for user experts in 
evaluating the usability of mobile websites. We focused on 
performing this evaluation in a practical and simple way. We 
discussed the guidelines in the context of mobile usability. 
We introduced UE and described its operation.  We used our 
tool for evaluating the usability of some mobile websites. 
Based on the results of this evaluation, we came up with 
some basic problems. Usability success rate of these 
websites will be increased by fixing these basic usability 
problems. 
In the process of analyzing guidelines we surveyed 
literature on mobile usability and determined that there is no 
standard addressing mobile user interfaces. Some of the 
guidelines are inadequate and subjective. Considering 
increasing usage share and importance of mobile websites, 
there should be a standard for mobile user interfaces. If such 
a mobile usability standard exists, designers and developers 
could use this standard for designing consistent mobile user 
interfaces, which would result in higher mobile user 
satisfaction. This survey shows us that a standardization 
study on mobile user interfaces is needed. 
This study is intended to help usability professionals in 
evaluation of mobile environments. We proposed a model to 
evaluate mobile websites, which didn’t involve mobile 
applications. In our future studies, we will apply this 
evaluation model on mobile applications by changing the list 
of rules for UE. Apple’s App Store and Google’s Android 
Market user reviews will also be considered to evaluate 
mobile applications. This model will be applied on not only 
news websites but also shopping, banking and video sharing 
websites.
