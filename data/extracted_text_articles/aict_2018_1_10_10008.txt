Abstract— This paper proposes to model the damage estimates 
for complex hazards caused by natural disasters. Although a 
single disaster system is currently in place for both natural 
and social disasters, the system for complex disasters is still in 
development. Complex disasters can be classified into different 
types, depending on the type of disaster. A study was 
conducted on the diseases caused by floods among complex 
disasters. Research methods were examined to suggest a 
complex disaster prediction model in conjunction with the 
existing natural disaster prediction model developed, and 
appropriate modeling methods were proposed estimating the 
infection rate of the disease. This paper will help build a 
complex disaster prediction system.

 INTRODUCTION  
Property damage and casualties caused by natural 
disasters such as flood and earthquake have been an issue for 
a very long time. Several countries carried out studies to 
minimize the damage caused by disasters and have 
developed methods to calculate the expected damage and 
extent of occurrence. 
However, this natural disaster can lead to complex 
disasters where various kinds of disasters occur at the same 
time. A single disaster means that only one disaster occurs, 
such as a flood or earthquake. A complex disaster is a 
disaster made out of single disasters that occur one after the 
other. In order to solve these complex disaster problems, we 
selected a flood and vector- borne disease disaster that can 
predict the extent of the damage by each single disaster 
calculation model. 
In this paper, we calculated the possibility of infection of 
vector-borne diseases depending on the magnitude of the 
flood, which represents the spread of vector diseases. It also 
showed the extent of the damage expected as a result of the 
occurrence of the vector-borne disease.

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DISASTER PREDICTION 
SYSTEM 
We analyzed the flood damage prediction system and the 
vector diffusion prediction system to understand the 
information of the existing system related to the prevention 
and 
prediction 
of 
disaster 
damage. 
The 
Extreme 
Programming-Stormwater 
& Wastewater 
Management 
Model (XP-SWMM) system was selected as the flood 
damage prediction system and the Spatio-Temporal 
Epidemiological Modeler (STEM) system was selected as 
the vector diffusion prediction system. Each system is 
primarily used to identify the spread of floods and disease. 
In order to run XP-SWMM and STEM systems, data 
must be entered directly by the user. In XP-SWMM system, 
the user must directly input the location information of the 
area and the rainfall data of the corresponding area [1]. In 
STEM system, disease information and data on local 
populations and transport systems should be entered in 
advance. When a disease occurs, the user must enter data 
about the location and information about the disease. [2]. 
III. 
COMPLEX DISASTER LINKAGE PLAN THROUGH 
VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE 
XP-SWMM and STEM can be analyzed for floods and 
diseases, but they cannot be utilized in the event of a 
disaster in which both occur in combination. Therefore, a 
linkage plan about complex disasters is needed. 
A. A modeling plan for complex disaster damage 
prediction 
The rate of disease incidence caused by disasters is 
applied to the prediction model of social disaster, which 
indicates the extent of damage to the final complex disaster. 
To apply infection rate data of vector-borne disease to the 
STEM, a social disaster prediction model, the McDonald-
Ross method should be applied, which is a method for

analyzing the spread of the disease. The McDonald-Ross 
method is structured as shown in Figure 1. 
ℎ is the total population, ℎ𝑠 is the susceptible person, ℎ𝑖 
is the infected person, ℎ𝑟  the recovered person, ℎ𝑢 the death 
rate, 𝑚𝑠 the susceptible mosquito, 𝑚𝑖 the infected mosquito, 
𝑚𝑢 the proportion of the dead mosquito, 𝑏 the bite rate, ℎ𝑏 is 
the probability of infection from mosquitoes to humans, 𝑚𝑏 
is the probability of mosquito infection in humans, and 𝑏𝑦 is 
the rate of recovery [3].

B. Calculation method of infectious disease rate 
In order to calculate the infection rate to be applied to the 
McDonald-Ross method, the probability of mosquito 
occurrence in the floodplain when the flood occurred was 
calculated and then the disease infection rate was calculated. 
First, if a flood occurred and a certain amount of time 
passed, we check for the existence of mosquitoes in the 
floodplain and calculate the number of bites per person 
according to the number of mosquitoes in the area. Next, we 
need to calculate the rate of infection of the disease in unit 
area using the number of bites per person.  
The probability of mosquito occurrence is calculated by 
the number of mosquito species and the number of 
occurrences according to the flooded area. To determine if 
mosquitoes are present in the flooded area, a mosquito 
existence discrimination formula based on the Indices of 
Local Wetness (ILW) is applied. ILW represents a wetting 
index according to a water level threshold within a certain 
range. To represent the ILW value, the area to be measured 
is divided into the number of areas to be calculated. 
The procedure for calculating ILW values is as follows. 
Divide the area of 10 square meters into 576 squares and set 
the flood threshold to 0.5 m. Calculate a value of 1 if the 
value of inundation in the flooded area is greater than the 
flood threshold value. Otherwise, calculate a value of zero. 
Then, add up the calculated values for each block to 
calculate the ILW value. Based on the calculated ILW value, 
the probability of occurrence of mosquitoes in the area to be 
measured is calculated [4]. 
The number of bites per unit area can be calculated from 
the mosquito incidence calculated and the number of 
mosquito populations when the mosquito occurs. The 
number of bites per person is calculated by dividing the 
number of mosquitoes per unit area by the number of people 
per unit area as shown in (1), then multiplying Human Blood 
Index (HBI) which is the probability of a person being bitten 
by a mosquito. The probability of HBI in this paper is 0.008% 
[5]. 

Bites per person = 
𝑀𝑜𝑠𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎
𝑃𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎
× 𝐻𝐵𝐼.
 
The number of bites per person can be used to calculate 
the infection rate of the vectors. The rate of infection can be 
calculated at (2) and the rate of infection can be calculated 
using the number of m of mosquito bites per person and the 
rate of transmission of mosquitoes r [6]. In case of mosquito 
transmission rate, the statistical value specified by each 
country can be applied. For example, in the United States, it 
is assumed that the disease occurred when the transmission 
rate of mosquitoes was more than 0.1 percent.

P =  1 − 𝑒−𝑚𝑟.

IV. 
SIMULATION RESULT AND CONCLUSION 
In the results of the natural disaster module XP-SWMM, 
the flood range and the inundation data are transferred to the 
input data from the disease connection module. Connection 
modules calculate the rate of infection, according to the 
amount of mosquitoes generated by the input data and 
provide it as input data for social disasters. 
The output data of the link module are input to the social 
disaster module STEM to calculate the main diffusion path 
according to the type of the disease type, and finally, the 
spread range of the disease is calculated. Assuming that 
sufficient time has elapsed since the flood, we calculate ILW 
data and mosquitoes occurrence in Region A. If mosquito 
existence is detected, the infection rate of the disease can be 
calculated and the disease spread path can be confirmed as 
shown in Figure 2.

In this paper, a study was conducted to integrate each 
analysis model of flood and disease. We proposed a 
connection method to integrate existing analytical models 
into a single model. We derived the expected diffusion result, 
according to the data value calculation. If we continue this 
study, it will be easier to identify and respond to the extent 
of damage about various complex disasters. If the research 
continues, we will eventually be able to integrate the various 
disaster analysis models into one.
