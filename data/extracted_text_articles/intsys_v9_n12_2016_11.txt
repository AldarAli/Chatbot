Abstract— SUMMIT is a mobile app that aims to gamify the 
experience of walkers and hikers and benefit the local 
communities through which they perambulate. It encourages 
physical activity through gamification of the user experience 
by adding additional elements of social fun and motivation to 
walking and hiking activities. It rewards users for their 
physical effort by offering access to local resources, hence 
increasing awareness and appreciation of the local assets and 
heritage and contributing to the local economy. The evaluation 
results show that both businesses and walkers were very 
receptive to the idea. A modified version of SUMMIT, the 
Science Safari App was implemented in a zoo setting and its 
potential implications are discussed.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
SUMMIT [1] is a location-based mobile app that 
encourages the walking and hiking community to avail 
themselves 
of 
local 
resources 
including 
hospitality 
businesses, product vendors, tourist attractions and local 
information.  
Romanticism era in the 18th century brought forth a shift 
in attitudes to the landscape and nature leading to the 
manifestation of the idea of walking through the countryside 
for pleasure [2]. An explosion of long distance walking 
routes occurred in the late 20th century with the Appalachian 
Trail in the USA [3] and the Pennine Way in Britain [4] as 
early examples. In Scotland, tourism figures from 2012 show 
that walking and hiking was the second most popular tourist 
activity among domestic visitors [5]. However, for many of 
these visitors, the walk can be the sole purpose of their trip 
and they may not access any other local attractions or local 
businesses. 
The key goal of SUMMIT is to “gamify” the user 
experience by adding additional elements of social fun, 
motivation and rewards to walking activities whilst 
increasing cultural appreciation through promotion of the 
local amenities and services to the benefit of the local 
economy. 
The idea behind it is to challenge walkers and hikers to 
reach checkpoints (geo-fenced areas) that are located along 
popular walking and hiking routes. When walkers reach a 
checkpoint they are presented with a list of rewards on their 
mobile app from which they can choose their favourite as 
illustrated in Fig. 1. The rewards are provided by local 
businesses in the area and may include things like a free 
muffin or a 20% discount on a product. For example, if the 
walker decides to choose a free muffin as his reward at some 
checkpoint, he selects this in his app and a virtual muffin is 
added to his “reward knapsack”.  He then takes this virtual 
muffin to the local shop that offered this reward to exchange 
his virtual muffin for a real one.  While he is there he may 
also buy a coffee or take friends with him who may also 
make some purchases.

In this way, SUMMIT benefits both walkers and local 
businesses. It encourages physical activity by making such 
activities more fun and rewarding but also introduces 
walkers and hikers to new local resources in the area that 
they might not have visited otherwise.   
Additionally, a great advantage of SUMMIT is its 
flexibility 
and 
extensibility. With 
some 
adaptations 
SUMMIT is deployable at different tourist sites with many 
points of interests where a stimulating route can be generated 
to improve visitors’ tour experiences. One such place is the 
zoo. During Explorathon’15 [6] at RZSS Edinburgh Zoo [7], 
the Science Safari App, a modified version of SUMMIT was 
released to visitors. The Explorathon’15 at RZSS Edinburgh 
Zoo held on the European Researcher’s Night, which takes 
place simultaneously every year in hundreds of cities across 
Europe and beyond is a mini science festival where scientists 
from Edinburgh’s universities showcased their ground 
breaking research to the public. The Science Safari App was 
used to guide visitors around the different science exhibits on 
display. 
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II 
presents the related work. Section III presents the findings 
from a focus workshop carried out prior to development 
while Section IV presents the design of SUMMIT, both the 
mobile and web apps. An evaluation of the first prototype 
that was carried out in the wild on Arthur’s Seat in 
Edinburgh, Scotland is detailed in Section V along with the 
results and discussions. Section VI presents the Science 
Safari App and some potential implication of its application 
in the zoo setting. Section VII concludes the paper. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Pervasive gaming takes the gaming experience into the 
real world, focusing on introducing game elements into the 
everyday life of players. It exploits interaction devices such 
as handhelds to display virtual elements [8], generates 
location-sensitive responses to interaction [9], employs 
technology through which human game-masters can exercise 
control of the game experience [10] and involves interactive 
actors to perform non-player characters [11]. 
Pirates! [12] was one of the first successful attempts to 
port the computer game into the real world and the IPerG 
project [13] has successfully executed a number of pervasive 
games in real spaces such as Epidemic Menace [14] and Day 
of the Figurines [15]. Other groups have produced 
educational pervasive games such as Virus [16] and Paranoia 
Syndrome [17]. Artistically oriented pervasive games such 
as Can You See Me Now? [8] used whole cities as the game 
environment. Ludocity [18], a collection of pervasive games 
inspired by theatre, painting, dance and other art forms also 
exploits public places such as city streets and parks for social 
play. All Ludocity games are released under creative 
commons licences, which allow everyone to run the games 
for free. Ingress by Google [19] is a near real-time 
augmented reality massively multiplayer online pervasive 
game with a complex science fiction back story and 
continuous open narrative.  
On the other hand, SUMMIT is a real-world outdoor 
treasure hunt game using Global Positioning System (GPS)-
enabled devices inspired by geocaching [20]. Analogous to 
geocaching, SUMMIT 
“hides” rewards of different 
categories at different places along a popular route for users 
to find and collect. These rewards reflect the distinctive 
resources offered by the local area and community 
encouraging users to appreciate and take advantage of the 
local amenities on offer. SUMMIT also logs users’ 
achievements and allows them to perform social comparison 
of their performance against others, thus introducing a 
competitive 
element 
to 
the 
overall 
walking/hiking 
experience. 
To date, quite a few treasure hunt based pervasive 
applications 
aiming 
at 
increasing 
cultural 
heritage 
appreciation have emerged including the Stealit App [21], 
Regensburg REXplorer game [22], the Global Treasure 
Apps [23], the Museum Explorer [24] and Huntzz [25].  
The Stealit App was developed for the National Museum 
of Scotland in Culture Hack Scotland 2011 by Alex 
Waterson and Jen Davies. It maps over 1000 items from the 
museum collections onto Festival venues throughout 
Edinburgh and encourages players to “steal” them. The 
Global Treasure App entice users to follow clues at different 
tourist attractions to collect gold, silver or bronze treasure 
tokens and real-world rewards such as a badge or money off 
in gift-shops and cafes. In the Museum Explorer App, users 
have a mission to track down nine mystery objects within 
the museum to unlock special explorer badge. The Huntzz 
App allows anyone to create and share treasure hunts. 
The main difference between these applications and 
SUMMIT is that these applications do not reward users 
based on physical achievements but on solving puzzles and 
clues. Only the Global Treasure Apps include real-world 
rewards but the focus is on promoting artifacts and 
attractions rather than local businesses and communities.  
Although other stamping schemes for tourist checkpoints 
exist [26], these schemes usually require all checkpoints to 
be reached to validate the completion of a tour with the aim 
of collecting badges or similar rewards. On the other hand, 
SUMMIT users do not need to reach all checkpoints to 
collect rewards and have the flexibility of choosing their 
desired 
rewards. 
Instead 
of 
automated 
checkpoint 
verification, the stamping schemes involve manually dating 
and stamping of a personal completion brochure or manually 
entering codes collected from checkpoints on the respective 
websites for electronic validation. 
Many zoos have created their own mobile apps such as 
the ZSL London Zoo App [27], Chester Zoo App [28], the 
Smithsonian National Zoo App [29] and the Dinosaurs 
Return App [30]. Most of these applications focus on helping 
visitors find their way around and discover the different 
animals and attractions available.  
The ZSL London Zoo App, the Chester Zoo App and the 
Smithsonian National Zoo App all present animal facts, 
photos and videos, incorporate a GPS-enabled interactive 
zoo map and a planner showing all daily events around the 
zoo. Additionally, the ZSL London Zoo App features a 
Walkabout Game where visitors have to find and photograph 
animals to win prizes. Users of the Chester Zoo App can

collect special animal badges as they walk around the zoo. 
The Smithsonian National Zoo App on the other hand lets 
anyone with Android or iOS mobile devices enjoy the zoo 
wherever they are with its virtual component.  
The Dinosaurs Return App was developed in conjunction 
to the Dinosaurs exhibition [31] at RZSS Edinburgh Zoo. 
The exhibition took place from April to November 2015 
aiming to raise awareness about the real threat of extinction 
faced by many endangered species today. Visitors can watch 
dinosaurs come alive in the palm of their hand by scanning 
augmented reality tags scattered around the site. There is also 
a dinosaur quiz and an exhibition map to aid visitors. 
The Science Safari App was developed from the 
SUMMIT project and targeted a range of scientific research 
exhibits at RZSS Edinburgh Zoo as part of the 
Explorathon’15 event [10]. SUMMIT is easily extensible to 
any locations in the world by adding new routes information 
and checkpoint coordinates, hence providing a quick way to 
generate interesting routes and create awareness in visitors 
about what is on offer at one-off events such as 
Explorathon’15 as well as longer term local resources. 
III. 
DESIGN WORKSHOP 
SUMMIT was proposed for the Fort William area [32].  
To inform the design of SUMMIT, we met with our contact 
from Visit Fort William [33] to discuss requirements both 
from hikers and businesses point of view. Through this 
collaboration, we identified three interesting routes around 
the area including Ben Nevis, Glen Nevis and Kinlochleven.  
A site analysis of the Ben Nevis area confirmed our 
expectations that the 3G signal is intermittent and cannot be 
relied upon. GPS and mobile network connectivity loss can 
have a negative impact on the user experience if not handled 
appropriately. Hence, a mechanism that allows users to have 
an undisrupted interaction is vital to the system. 
Additionally, we ran a focus workshop with hikers and 
walkers to understand more about their use of technology 
when out in the wild. The group provided some interesting 
suggestions for before, during and after the hike.  
Before the hike, it was proposed that weather forecast, 
route information on a map, predicted completion time and 
a checking in feature to say that they are going for a hike 
would be useful. During the hike, the ability to connect to 
social network for sharing, performance measure, alert to 
possible interesting diversion and emergency button to call 
for help are desirable. After the hike, there need to be a 
feature for checking out to say that they have completed the 
journey as well as the ability to view collected rewards. 
Some interesting issues were also raised such as concerns 
about draining battery power, suggestion for group specific 
rewards and some views that information about the local 
town might be more important than real-world rewards. 
They also mentioned that during a walk/hike, they usually 
keep their phones in the pocket.  
Moreover, there seemed to be a consensus that the target 
group for the app is the younger generation. Personalisation 
of rewards to age groups or user types can be beneficial. 
These feedbacks informed the design of the SUMMIT 
service including seamless connectivity, availability of a 
route map, information about estimated distance and 
completion time, a check-in check-out feature, ability to 
share on social network sites such as Facebook, ability to 
view an assortment of rewards and select them as well as the 
need for minimum interaction with the service while en 
route.  
Unfortunately, due to limited time and resources, we 
were not able to implement suggestions such as weather 
forecast, 
real-time 
performance 
measure, 
interesting 
diversion alert, emergency help button or personalisation of 
rewards but focused on those deemed important for the 
purpose of the SUMMIT service.  
IV. 
THE SUMMIT SYSTEM 
The SUMMIT system consists of two main components: 
a web app, which allows business users to manage the 
rewards that they provide, and a mobile app, which is used 
by the walkers and hikers. Fig. 2 illustrates the SUMMIT 
system deployment including the server where information 
about business users and app users are stored.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. SUMMIT system deployment. 
 
A. SUMMIT Mobile Application 
The mobile app was developed for the Android platform. 
It aims to enhance the walking activities by supporting the 
users’ personal achievement element through a reward 
scheme and the social competition element through 
comparisons of their progress against others via the social 
network site, Facebook.  
The mobile app monitors the users’ outdoor locations 
while they are en route using GPS. Each route has several 
pre-defined checkpoints, usually selected based on their 
touristic values to the respective region that are geo-fenced 
122
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 9 no 1 & 2, year 2016, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

areas. The app does not provide real-time navigation but as 
users reach checkpoints, the phone will start vibrating and 
notifications will appear on the system bar. When this 
happens, users will unlock new virtual reward items 
provided by local businesses, which they can exchange into 
real rewards.  
Prior to the hike, users can check out different routes and 
rewards associated with each of the routes. They can then 
select a route that provides the rewards they desire and suits 
their constraints in terms of time and distance. This 
flexibility enables users to personalise their tour experience 
based on their needs at any particular time.  
Fig. 3 shows the workflow of the mobile app. Before 
users can use the mobile app, they have to register. After 
they have registered and logged in, they will see 5 tabs 
including “Route”, “K-sack”, “Reward”, “Claim” and 
“Facebook”. Fig. 4 shows the Login Screen of the app while 
Fig. 5 shows the “Route” tab, which lists the available 
routes, estimated distance and time as well as the 
checkpoints and rewards associated with each route.  
When users select a route, the route information will be 
downloaded onto their phone assuming Internet connection 
is available. By pre-loading the routes, the issue of unreliable 
3G signal is avoided as the route information is now locally 
stored, hence will always be available to users when en 
route.

When the user is ready for the hike, they check-in by 
pressing the “Start Route” button, which activates 
checkpoints tracking. During the hike, only GPS signal is 
required to track users’ position. Since each checkpoint 
covers an area of 50 metre radius, a short loss of GPS signal 
does not affect the performance of the app. These approaches 
give users a virtual “Always-On” connectivity impression 
allowing them to have an undisrupted interaction experience. 
The problem of draining the battery power is also minimised 
as the phone is not constantly connected to the network. 
Synchronisation with the server occurs the next time network 
connectivity is available and activated by the user when all 
logged data on the mobile device is uploaded.  
To help users locate the rewards, a map that shows the 
locations of the different checkpoints is provided as 
illustrated in Fig. 6. The associated rewards will 
automatically be added to the user’s knapsack (“K-sack” 
tab) at each checkpoint. When network connection is 
available, users can select one reward for each checkpoint 
through a selection dialog as shown in Fig. 7.  
After they have made their selection, the rewards will 
appear under the “Reward” tab. To claim a particular reward 
on this list, the user needs to tap on the reward and a claim 
dialog as shown in Fig. 8 will appear. By clicking claim, the 
reward will appear under the “Claim” tab and on the 
supplier system (for the web app description, please refer to 
Section B) where the claim can be authorised.

Users can also post their achievements onto Facebook if 
they wish as illustrated in Fig. 9 allowing them to compare 
their progress against others en route. When they have 
completed the hike, they check-out by pressing the “End 
Route” button, which will subsequently stop checkpoints 
tracking and upload all the users’ progress onto the server 
when Internet connection is available.

B. SUMMIT Web Application 
The web app was developed to enable easy sign-up of 
local businesses as reward providers. Once registered as 
business users, they can perform the actions depicted in the 
workflow diagram in Fig. 10.  
 
 
 
Figure 10. SUMMIT web app workflow. 
The supplier can add, edit or delete a business. They can 
add, deactivate, re-activate, delete and edit a specific reward 
item. They can also approve claims from the mobile app 
users.  
Fig. 11 shows the web app dashboard with four tabs: 
Your Information, Add Business, Add Rewards and Manage 
Claims. The “Your Information” tab displays the list of 
businesses and rewards owned by a provider as well as the 
available actions. Alert icons will appear beside reward items 
that reach zero count so that the provider can decide to add 
more of the reward or delete it. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11. Web app dashboard. 
 
The “Add Business” tab allows the suppliers to add 
business(es) while the “Add Reward” tab allows them to 
add reward(s). The “Manage Claims” tab in Fig. 12 lists all 
pending claims from the mobile app users. To authorise a 
claim from a specific user, the supplier has to click on the 
approve icon to the right of the claim with the respective 
user name.

V. 
EVALUATION 
This section details the evaluation we carried out on the 
SUMMIT Mobile App and Web App.  
 
A. Experimental Setup 
The experimental setups for both platforms are presented 
below. 
 
1) The Mobile App  
A trial of the SUMMIT mobile app has been carried out 
with 24 participants; 18 males and 6 females. Participants 
were volunteers who are either interested in mobile 
applications or hikers and walkers. They were issued with 
Samsung Galaxy SIII phones with the mobile app pre-
installed and were asked to hike up Arthur’s Seat (Fig. 13), a 
popular rural area within the City of Edinburgh with many 
local businesses in proximity.  
One of the main reasons we chose Arthur’s Seat for the 
trial was because it is much more accessible from Heriot-
Watt University making recruitment of participants easier as 
compared to routes around the Fort William areas such as 
Ben Nevis, Glen Nevis and Kinlochleven. Logistically, it is 
almost impossible to organise a group up north for a hike and 
back within a day. The unpredictable weather made the task 
even more difficult. On the other hand, participants can go 
up Arthur’s Seat at their own convenience when the weather 
permitted anytime during the 3 weeks period of the trial.  
After participants had completed the hike, they were 
asked to complete a questionnaire. They were asked to rate 
different features of the app on a 5-point Likert scale. These 
features included: 
S1: route information 
S2: map 
S3: rewards motivation 
S4: advance knowledge of rewards 
S5: rewards selection 
S6: claim system 
S7: rewards choices 
S8: claim intention 
S9: Facebook functionality and  
S10: ease of use of the app.  
Additionally, they were given the freedom to provide 
further comments about any part of the mobile app or their 
experience of using it. Please refer to Appendix I for the full 
list of questions. 
 
2) The Web App  
A total of 7 businesses signed up to the rewards scheme.  
In order to participate, the suppliers were asked to create a 
business account and add their own reward(s). The rewards 
were to remain active during the period of the trial and the 
following couple of months.  
A week after the trial ended, they were contacted to 
gather their feedback on the web app. Some personal 
information and previous experience in using apps for 
advertising purposes were gathered. Other questions 
included the number of customers the mobile app brought 
into the shops, other desired features for the web app and 
free comments on the web app and their experience in using 
it. Please refer to Appendix II for the full list of questions.

B. Results and Discussion 
In the following subsections, we present the results of 
our evaluation of both platforms and relevant implications 
are discussed. 
 
1) The Mobile App 
The chart in Fig. 14 shows the overall average rating of 
all 24 participants. On average participants were neutral on 
the usefulness of the route information (S1). Taking the level 
of significance, α = 0.05, a Mann-Whitney test on this 
variable between the younger (less than 40 years old, n=17, 
M=3.418, SD=0.425) and the older (more than 40 years old, 
n=7, M=2.286, SD=0.694) users showed a significant 
difference with U(24)=13, Z=-3.050, p=0.002 (see Fig. 15).  
 
 
 
Figure 14. Overall average rating of all 24 participants. 
 
The older generation found the route information not 
useful while the younger generation found it useful. This 
might be because the older users were used to using 
guidebooks when walking and were expecting directional 
information such as descriptions of terrain and photographs 
126
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 9 no 1 & 2, year 2016, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

of each checkpoint, which was not provided via the app and 
might have led to some of them getting lost along the way. 
On average the participants found the map informative 
(S2). However, they would have preferred an interactive 
map, which tells them their position in relation to the 
checkpoints at any particular time instance, “a real-time blue 
dot” as they called it.  
 
 
 
Figure 15. Average rating comparison between younger and older users. 
(* denotes variables with significant differences, α = 0.05) 
 
The participants found the rewards motivated them to go 
on the hike (S3). Although not statistically significant, a 
closer look at the comparison between novice (n=8), 
intermediate (n=11) and experienced hikers (n=5) in Fig. 16 
revealed that novice and intermediate hikers found the 
rewards more motivating than experienced hikers. This could 
be due to the fact that experienced hikers have the passion to 
hike and thus will do it irrespective of whether they are being 
rewarded or not.  
Some participants mentioned in their questionnaire that 
the rewards served as an initial motivation. As they moved 
from one checkpoint to another, the fact that there were 
rewards attached to each of the checkpoints became less 
important to them and, instead, their ultimate goal was to 
reach all the checkpoints and complete the route as reflected 
in the participants’ comments.  
 
“The motivation was the challenge to reach all the 
checkpoints.” 
 
“The biggest motivation to keep walking weren't the 
rewards but the challenge to reach the next checkpoint.” 
 
This interesting finding suggests that the gamification 
aspect of numbering the checkpoints itself provided enough 
motivation for the user to carry on once they had started. 
This implies that it might not be necessary to assign rewards 
to all checkpoints but only to a few important ones to give 
them the initial push. 
Overall, participants thought that it was important to 
know the rewards in advance (S4) and to be given the option 
to choose from a selection of rewards (S5). They also found 
the claim system easy to use (S6).  
 
 
 
Figure 16. Average rating comparison between Experienced, Intermediate 
and Novice hikers. 
 
In terms of the range of rewards provided (S7), there was 
again a significant difference between younger (n=17) and 
older (n=7) users. This was revealed by applying the Mann-
Whitney test, with U(24)=17, Z=-2.842, p=0.005, to the 
results in Fig. 15. The younger users seemed to be satisfied 
with the type of rewards provided, which included discounts 
on food, drinks, shoes, sweets, clothes, souvenirs and tours, 
while the older users were not.  
The older users would have liked some rewards that they 
could redeem immediately after the hike, for example, 
refreshments, discount at a local hotel or B&B and rewards 
targeted at kids. The younger users also mentioned that free 
rewards, money-off vouchers for tourist attractions such as 
National Trust locations, the storytelling centre, museums, 
zoos and castles as well as offers related to sport or physical 
activities would be beneficial. 
The intention to claim all rewards (S8) also revealed a 
significant difference between the two age groups. Many of 
the participants were exhausted after the hike and selected 
their rewards only after they were home and once they were 
not in the vicinity of the shops. They were therefore less 
keen to make the effort to return to the area to collect their 
rewards at a later date. Their need during the short period 
before and after the trial may also determine whether the 
participants will claim their rewards, for example, discount 
on shoes will be useful if the participant is in need of a new 
pair of shoes but might be worthless otherwise. Again, the 
Mann-Whitney test showed a significant difference between 
the older and younger users, U(24)=21.5, Z=-2.529, 
p=0.013. Since the older users were less interested in the 
rewards, they were also less inclined to claim them.  
The participants rated the ability to post their 
achievement onto Facebook (S9) fairly low. One reason for 
this might be because, as the app was only a prototype, the 
users had to use test user accounts instead of their own 
accounts. As a result the achievement posts did not appear 
127
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 9 no 1 & 2, year 2016, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

on their own Facebook wall or timeline. Observing the chart 
in Fig. 15, younger users seem to have a more positive 
outlook on this feature than older users although the Mann-
Whitney test did not show a significant difference. 
Finally, the average rating for ease of use of the app 
(S10) was good. However, there was again a significant 
difference between the older and younger users, as 
confirmed by the Mann-Whitney test, U(24)=17.5, Z=-
2.801, p=0.005. This could be due to the fact that the 
younger users were more accustomed with mobile apps and 
thus had a better idea about the flow of control and 
operations of the app and phone in general. For example, a 
couple of the older participants were having some technical 
problems such as locating the back button on the phone and 
getting Facebook login to work as reflected in their 
comments: 
 
“Hardest bit was finding the 'Back' button.” 
 
“Couldn't get the Facebook login to work” 
 
Moreover, only 2 out of the 7 older participants are 
experienced mobile apps users while 10 out of 17 younger 
participants are experienced users.  
The feedback on subjective questions revealed that some 
participants would have liked the mobile app to provide 
more 
interesting 
information 
about 
the route 
and 
checkpoints. One of the experienced hikers suggested that it 
would be useful if the app could show real-time progress 
such as the time he took to go from one checkpoint to 
another and the overall time he took to complete the route. 
This would allow users to compare their real-time progress 
with each other, hence increasing the competitive element of 
the app.  
The mobile app has also been found to provide 
motivation for a second time visitor to hike a hill/mountain 
that they have conquered before, as one of the participants 
stated: 
 
“Thanks for giving me a reason to walk up Arthur's 
Seat. I am feeling revitalised and refreshed now I'm 
home! This serves as an excellent reason to walk up 
hills/mountains that you have already conquered (I've 
been up Arthur's Seat twice).” 
 
2) The Web App 
From the perspective of the suppliers, overall they were 
very satisfied with the usability of the web app. The 
participating suppliers’ age ranges from 30 to 70 and only 
one of them has previous experience of using an app for 
advertising purposes. Moreover, many of the shops have 
staffs working on shifts. As a result, they were not very 
meticulous in recording or updating the actual rewards that 
were redeemed in their system so we are unable to report 
actual numbers but we were assured that rewards were 
indeed claimed.  
 
 
Figure 17. The average suppliers rating of different Web app features. 
 
Observing Fig. 17, they found the registration process 
straightforward (S1), an average rating of 4.857 out of 5. It 
is also easy to add business(es) (S2) and reward(s) (S3). 
They found the claim management system easy to use (S4). 
All the suppliers who took part in the trial think that the app 
can potentially be a useful advertising medium (S5), hence 
the rating of 4 out of 5.  
In order to encourage claims after the trial, one of the 
suppliers offered an additional deal on top of those provided 
on the mobile app if participants claimed within a particular 
period of time.  
The suppliers remained very enthusiastic about the 
SUMMIT system following the trial. One of the suppliers 
suggested that it might be useful to include an online claim 
facility, which might encourage more claims as the 
participants would be able to redeem their rewards anywhere 
at their own convenience.  
VI. 
THE SCIENCE SAFARI APP 
As previously stated, SUMMIT is easily extensible to 
new routes and attractions. Consequently, the Science Safari 
App [34] was created for the Explorathon’15 event [6] at 
RZSS Edinburgh Zoo [7] to guide visitors around the 
science exhibits.  
A. Explorathon ’15 Event 
At the Explorathon’15 event [6], visitors were invited to 
download the Science Safari App [34] onto their Android 
device when they arrived at the zoo. All available exhibits 
were listed on the “Route” tab and as the visitors attended 
each of them, the app registered the entry with notional

reward.  Depending on the number of exhibits clocked, a 
final reward was delivered as the visitor was leaving the 
zoo. Various rewards were offered including sweets, pens, 
keyrings and badges. The “Explorer” badges personalised 
with name was the most popular among children.  
B. Future Potential 
Successively, the Science Safari App enabled the visitor 
movement around the site to be captured as illustrated in 
Fig. 18. This information is invaluable to RZSS Edinburgh 
Zoo for future planning such as identifying where new 
services should be located and how to minimize congestion. 
 
 
 
Figure 18. Example visitor route around the exhibits with time stamps. 
 
RZSS Edinburgh Zoo recognises the potential of this type 
of technology to enhance visitors’ experience and how it 
could be used to support its mission to engage the public in 
conservation issues. It already employs technology such as 
the Dinosaur Return App discussed earlier, online webcams 
(for pandas, penguins and squirrel monkeys) and the online 
learning system Moodle [35] through which the public can 
take courses in relevant subjects.  
As a result, RZSS Edinburgh Zoo is exploring further with 
us how the reward-based gamification aspects of SUMMIT 
can be used to encourage and create awareness in visitors 
about conservation, hence fulfilling its aims of providing 
recreational and educational value to visitors. 
In order to realise this potential, the first step would be to 
capture the visitor flow with a much larger monitoring 
programme using portable device such as suitably located 
RFID reader while issuing each visitors with RFID labels, 
which permit both indoor and outdoor tracking. The data 
gathered will then be mined to identify pattern for daily and 
seasonal variations. The rewards may then be assigned to 
less “popular” locations or where important messages on 
conservation are being delivered.  
Additionally, 
to 
maximize 
the 
visitors 
learning 
experience, delivery of meaningful and coherent content is 
crucial. Visitors usually determine their own routes around 
different points of interests and this variability can make it 
difficult to deliver understandable content to them. A way to 
overcome this is by recording movement history as visitors 
traverse the zoo and alert them to other related exhibits based 
on this information. We have developed such solutions in a 
number of previous projects [36, 37, 38, 39].  
A further novel information delivery approach in which 
content is personalised and adapted to a visitor’s prior 
knowledge based on what they have already received would 
avoid the annoying repetition common to current information 
delivery systems. This will provide visitors with unique 
narratives and experiences evolving around their own 
interests and knowledge. 
The opportunity to deploy and test these ideas in a public 
setting such as RZSS Edinburgh Zoo will enable us to 
further our research in this field. 
VII. FUTURE WORK 
In its current state, the SUMMIT Mobile app is easily 
extensible to other locations by adding new routes 
information and checkpoints coordinates. However, there 
are still room for improvement which could further the 
potential of the app. 
 
It would be beneficial to include an interactive map 
that dynamically updates the user’s position on the 
map during the hike, for example a real-time ‘blue 
dot’ that tracks the user on the map.  
 
To increase cultural appreciation, the app can take 
advantage of attractions along a certain route and 
uses these as checkpoints. This will encourage 
visitors to make diversions and visit places that 
they might not be visiting when they do the usual 
hike. The user experience and engagement can also 
be improved if the app can provide the users with 
interesting and meaningful information about these 
locations. 
 
To target users of all ages, the app may benefit 
from a wider range of rewards with greater 
intrinsic values for example useful information 
about the local area, discounts on tickets for local 
events or entrance to local attractions and offers 
related to sports or physical activities available in 
the local area.  
 
It might also be useful to personalise the rewards 
according to age group or type of users so that their 
needs are better met as suggested by the focus 
group.  
129

 
It would be worthwhile to grade the route with 
different level of difficulty so that the user can 
choose routes that are suited to their capability 
reducing the possibility of struggles or lose of 
interests.  
 
Information regarding personal progress can be 
valuable for some users who are interested in how 
they are performing such as the overall completion 
time and the time taken to go from one checkpoint 
to another.  
 
Presentation 
of 
personalised 
and 
coherent 
information based on users’ prior knowledge will 
increase engagement and improve recreational and 
educational experiences. 
An improvement to the SUMMIT Web app would be the 
inclusion of an online claim facility which allows the user to 
make the claim online without the need to physically visit the 
shops. This might benefit hikers who travel through regions 
that take hours or days. However, this will work only for 
intangible rewards or rewards that can be sent through post. 
This will also encourage the participation of more businesses 
as the constraint of location is eliminated. Care has to be 
taken to ensure that priorities are still given to local 
businesses in the target area. 
A larger scale evaluation at the Fort William area will 
provide us with more insights about users’ perception and 
experiences of the apps. 
VIII.  CONCLUSION 
SUMMIT has successfully added the elements of social 
fun and motivation to walking and hiking activities. It helps 
to promote local resources around a route by making users 
aware of their existence through its rewards scheme and 
checkpoints assignment. Business users were satisfied with 
its ease of use and appreciated its potential as a useful 
medium for advertising and delivering their wares and 
services. Its application in a public “in-the-wild” setting at 
RZSS Edinburgh Zoo has also proved successful and 
demonstrated the potential of such technology in improving 
visitor experiences and education.
