Abstract—In advanced countries, populations are getting older.
Cognitive
disorders are an
important
problem in these
countries. We need to measure the deterioration of brain
functions with the process of aging. For synchronizing with
other motion, we need to feel the other motion, to recognize the
motion,
to
memorize
the
motion,
and
to
generate
the
synchronizing motion. We need many kinds of brain functions
to perform a cooperative movement. The authors proposed the
cooperative
visual
synchronization
task,
its’
measuring
method, implementation and experiments to measure and
evaluate the performance of motor control functions. The new
task and the measuring method enable to measure the precise
movements easily and in a short period of time. The proposed
method is safe, because there is no need to attach a device to a
subject nor to make exaggerated motions. This paper presents
a method to evaluate the aging process of motor control
functions using the objective measurement of cooperative
movement in both hands, its implementation, and experiments.

I.
INTRODUCTION
With aging, our physical function deteriorates, and also
our
brain
functions
do.
In
advanced
countries,
our
populations are getting older. Our physical deteriorations are
measured easily. We need to measure the deterioration of
brain functions also. There are tests to measure memory
functions and congnitive disorders.
A cooperative movement with other movements is more
difficult than simple movements. For instance, clapping
hands is easy. However, clapping hands synchronizing with
other people is difficult. Synchronizing movement is the base
of cooperative movement. For synchronizing with another
motion, we need to feel the other motion, to recognize the
motion, to memorize the motion, and to generate the
synchronizing motion. We may estimate the performance of
total
brain
function
by
observing
the
process
of
synchronizing movement.
There are many motor tasks that measure human motor
function abilities. They are the Purdue pegboard task, a seal
affixation task, a tray carrying task, etc. [1] - [3]. These tasks
estimate human motor function abilities based on the results
from the tasks. There is no observation on the process of the
tasks. There are also some synchronization tasks used to
measure the motor function of a human. One example is a
synchronization of ﬁnger taps with periodically ﬂashing 
visual
stimuli
and
synchronization
with
an
auditory
metronome. In these tasks, the timing between the stimuli
and the tapping is measured. There is no observation about
the process of the tapping [4] - [10].
Recently, many cheap and easy measurement methods
for the movements of a human body have been developed.
For instance, some of these sensors include Kinect sensor,
and
Leap
motion sensor [11] [12]. There are many
applications that use these sensors to control computers. For
example, there are many video games that use these sensors
to control avatars in the games [13].
Using the new motion sensor, we can measure the motion
of hands easily and precisely. The human hands are the parts
of the body that can make the most complex movements. We
have
proposed
a
method
that
measures
the
precise
movements of hands synchronizing the movements of hands
on a display. The synchronization needs visual perception of
the displayed hands’ images and precise control over the arm
muscles. The resulting measure is very sensitive. With this
measure, we can observe the performance of the motor
function precisely [14].
This paper proposes a new estimation method to evaluate
the performance of a brain function of an elderly person with
the measurement of a motion control function in cooperative
synchronizing movements. We believe this method helps to
detect the cognition disorder in early stages.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
discusses the task to synchronize hands’ movements with
visual presentation. Next, we discuss the experimental setup
in Section III, and show our experimental results in Section
IV. Finally, we conclude this work in Section V.
II.
VISUAL SYNCHRONIZATION TASK
There are many motor tasks that intend to measure the
motor function of a human. However, most of these tasks
measure the results from the tasks. There are some tasks that
measure the synchronization between a finger tap and
stimuli. With human observations, it is difficult to measure
the process of synchronizing movements. Now, we can use a
Kinect sensor and a Leap Motion sensor. These sensors
measure the three-dimensional movements of a human body.
With these sensors, we can measure the precise movements
of a human body.
We can synchronize our movements with each other. For
instance, when dancing, dancers can synchronize their
movements with each other. A synchronization of movement
is more difficult work than a simple imitation of movement.
To generate synchronized movements, we need to observe
49

the motion to be synchronized. We need to generate the
motion to be similar to the motion synchronized. We need to
observe the generated motion synchronizing the original
motion. We need to estimate the divergence between the
original motion synchronized and the motion synchronizing
the original motion. We need to control the speed of the
motion synchronizing. These functions form a feedback loop.
However, there is a delay in our processing. To compensate
our brain’s processing delay, we need to estimate the delay
itself and make proper amount of feedforward.
This processing loop is shown in Fig. 1. For estimating
the total brain function, we need to include all the functions
of the brain. The visual synchronization task includes vision
and motor functions. The vision includes not only the static
sight, but also the dynamic sight.
The visual synchronization is more difficult than audio
synchronization. So, we observe the wider brain functions
with
the
visual
synchronization
tasks
than
the audio
synchronization tasks.
Our
proposed
visual
synchronization
task
is
the
synchronization between the position of stimuli on a display
and the position of the hands. Our synchronization task is not
the synchronization between the timing of the stimuli and the
timing of action. The measurement of timing is only one
scalar value in a cycle of stimuli. In our proposed
synchronization task, the measuring result is a sequence of
triples of the positions of the stimuli and the ones of subject’s
hands in a cycle of stimuli. For instance, we have 100
measurements in a cycle of stimuli.
A.
Motion synchronization measure
We define the synchronization measure using Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) results of the estimated poses of
both hands in each cycle. If a subject makes complete
synchronization to the stimuli, the resulting pose of both
hands follows a complete sine curve. As a result, at every
cycle of the rotation of hands, the result of FFT has a zero
value at the second term or higher terms. We define the
measure as (1). This measure increases with the distance
from ideal sine curve.
ܰܵܯ=(෍݉௫
௧/４
ｘ＝２
)
൘݉１
(1)
In (1), t is the number of terms. ݉௫ is the absolute value
of the x-th term of the result of FFT. ݉ଵ is the power of the
lowest frequency. This represents one cycle of a hand’s
rotation. If the rotation of a hand follows the stimuli images
precisely, ݉ଵ carries all powers of the hand’s rotation. Other
terms carry no power. In that case, the measure in (1) is 0.
݉଴ is a value that represents the average of poses. This is
not included in (1). As a result, this measure does not depend
on the absolute poses of hands.
We call
this
measure
as Non-Smoothness-Measure
(NSM). This measure may span from 0 to infinity.
Our proposed system observes two hands. So at every
cycle, we have two NSMs.
B.
Phase
The NSM is the measure of the difference of a motion
based on the displayed motion. However, there is a
difference of timing between the displayed motion and a
user’s motion. The tapping test measures the difference
between a stimulus and the response of a user. In the
proposed synchronization task, the difference in timing is the
difference of phases.
In the result of FFT, there are phases of all frequencies.
In our experiments, these are from 0 Hz to 50 Hz. The signal
of 1 Hz represents the ideal motion based on the proposed
example motion. Therefore, we use the phase of the signal of
1 Hz for evaluating the timing of the motion.
III.
EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Experiments Setup
From the pre-experiments, the speed of the hands’
rotation is best at one cycle per second. Subjects need about
three cycles to synchronize their movements of hands to the
proposed motion images and remember the motion. As a
result, one trial of an experiment needs at least 11 S. For
getting reliable results, we decided that the length of a trial
would be 25 cycles of rotations. This means that one trial
needs 25 S. Fig. 2 shows the relations among parts, cycles,
and sections in a trial. A cycle is one flip of hands. There are
two parts. One part is an example displaying part. The other
is no-example displaying part. The sections are periods to
analyze measured data. The first section shows the status of a
subject in the motion example displaying part. The second
section does the status just after the disappearance of the
motion example. The third section shows the status a few

seconds after the example motion disappears. Before starting
a trial, we instruct subjects to synchronize their hands to the
displayed hands’ images and continue to move the hands
after the example motion disappears.
B. Experiment
1)
Young and Healthy People
We obtained 156 valid trials with four healthy, male
students, with ages between 23 - 24 years old. At each trial,
we have 25 pairs of NSMs and 25 pairs of phases, at most. In
many cases, a subject could not move his hands as the
displayed hands at the first cycle. The NSM shows the
difference of the motion of subject’s hands from the
proposed
example
motion.
The
phase
represents
the
difference of the timing between the proposed example
motion and the motion made by a subject.
2)
Elderly people
We performed experiments with elderly people, 75 years
old in average. They are all healthy for their age. In our
observation, one female has difficulty walking. So, we have
14 healthy elderly people, four males and ten females. Each
one made two trials, for a total of 28 trials. One trial had a
failure in measurement. We obtained 27 valid measurements
of the trials.
3)
Measure for a trial
In a single cycle, the measured movements of hands may
match the proposed example movements accidentally. We
estimate the performance of the motion control function with
the average motions in three continuous cycles. And, we
estimate the performance of a subject in a trial with the best
movements in the averages of three continuous cycles.
Equation (2) defines the performance of a hand in a trial.
NSMH = min
௜ୀଵ,଼ ܽݒ݁ݎܽ݃݁(ܰܵܯ௜,ܰܵܯ௜ାଵ, ܰܵܯ௜ାଶ)
(2)
NSMH is the performance of a hand in a trial. ܰܵܯ௜ is
the NSM at i-th cycle defined as (1). We have two NSMHs in
a trial. They represent the performances of both hands.
We define the performance measure in a trial as (3).
NSMT = min(ܰܵܯܪ௅,ܰܵܯܪோ)
(3)
In (3), NSMT is the performance measure in a trial.
ܰܵܯܪ௅ is the NSMH of the left hand. ܰܵܯܪோ is the NSMH
of the right hand. This NSMT represents the performance of
a subject in a trial.
IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSIONS
A. NSMs
1)
Young people
Table I summarizes the NSMs at each cycle in young
people. At the first cycle, a subject tries to synchronize his
hands’ motions with the displayed example motion. The
average NSM of the first cycle is larger than other cycles.
After three cycles, a subject completes the synchronization of
his hands to the displayed motions. The NSMs at cycle 3 to
cycle 10 are low. At the start of cycle 11, the example hands
image disappears. The NSM at cycle 11 increases a little.
The differences among cycles are small. Fig.3 shows the
average of NSMs in each cycle.
In our experiments, the memory related to simple motion
is good in the first five seconds from the disappearance of the

proposed example motion shown in Fig. 3. After five
seconds, there is a little loss in motion precision.
We computed the difference between the distribution of
the NSMs at cycle 10 and the distribution of other cycles
after cycle 10.
We confirm that they have the same distributions using t-
test. Table II shows the probability of sameness of the
distributions from one of the cycle 10. Fig. 4 shows the
probabilities. From cycle 13 to cycle 19, the probabilities are
decreasing. This shows that the short-term memory of motor
function decrease rapidly. After cycle 20, subjects lost the
memory about the motion, and their hands’ motions became
more random.
With NSMTs, we estimate the performance of the
younger people in synchronizing their hands’ movement to
the displayed hands’ movement. Fig. 5 shows the distribution
of NSMTs of younger subjects. The NSMTs concentrate
around 0.2.
2)
Elderly people
Table III summarizes the NSMs at each cycle in elderly
people. At the first cycle, an elderly subject synchronizes his
hands’ motions to the displayed example motion. The
average NSM of the first cycle is larger than other cycles.
After six cycles, a subject finishes to synchronize his hands
to the displayed motions. The NSMs at cycle 4 to cycle 10
are low. At the start of cycle 11, the displayed example hands

image disappears. The NSM increases from cycle 11 to cycle
14. The differences between cycles are not large. Fig. 6
shows the average of NSMs in each cycle.
3)
Comparison between young people and elderly people
We have 158 NSMTs of young people and 27 NSMTs of
elderly people. On average, the NSMTs of young people are
smaller than the NSMTs of elderly people. However, we
need to check the reliability. We perform a t-test with these
two groups of NSMTs. Table IV shows the result of the t-test.
The probability of being the same is less than 10-9. The
deference between young people and elderly people is
significant. This implies that NSMT can measure the
deterioration as a result of the aging process. There is an
apparent difference between NSMs of young people and
ones of elderly people, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 6.
4)
Aging in NSMTs
In elderly people, the deterioration of motor control
function increases with the aging process. Fig. 7 shows the
relation between the age and the NSMT of each elderly
person. The correlation coefficient between the age and the
NSMT of elderly people is 0.467. There is a linear relation
between the age and the NSMT. The linear approximation is
(4).
NSMT = 0.0088a − 0.26
(4)
In (4), NSMT is the performance measure of motor
control function. a is the age of a subject. The age ranges
between 66 years old and 83 years old.
The average of NSMTs is about 0.2 in young people. If
the deterioration of motor control function shows a linear

relation with the age of a subject from the start of the
deterioration, we can estimate the motor control function age
with (5) over 53 years old people.
NSMA = 114MSNT + 29.5
(5)
In (5), NSMA is an aging years of motor control function.
NSMT is a measured NSM at a trial. This shows the
measurement of motor control function can estimate the
aging of a brain function of elderly people.
B. Phases
The phase of the measured motion represents the timing
of motion. In phases, there is apparent difference between the
first period where the example motion is displayed and the
second period where the example is not displayed in a trial.
In the part from cycle 1 to cycle 10, the phases keep a
similar value. From cycle 11, the phases change gradually.
This represents the difference between the speed of the
example motion and one of the memorized motions. From
this phase change, we can measure the difference of timings
between the example motion and the memorized motion.
1)
Young people
We assume that the phase change in the first part of a
trial is smaller than the phase change in the second part of the
trial. We divided all cycles into three sections. To confirm
this assumption, we calculate the linear approximation of the
phases in each section. The first section starts from cycle 4,
and ends at cycle10. The second section goes from cycle 11
to cycle 17. The third section goes from cycle 17 to cycle 23,
as shown in Fig. 2. In 158 valid trials, there are delays and
advances in phases. We evaluate phase change in absolute
value.
Table V shows the averages of the slant of each section.
The average absolute slant of phases in the first section is
smaller than the one in the second section and the third
section. Fig. 8 shows this relation. In Fig. 8, there is an
apparent increase of phase changes in 2nd and 3rd sections.
Statistically, the first section and the second section have
difference bases. Calculation of the t-test confirms that the
difference is significant. The t-measure between these two
sections is over 12. The probability is under 10-26. The t-
measure between the second section and the third section is
0.18. The probability is over 0.85. This confirms that the
second and the third sections have a same base. This result
means that the memory about the timing of motion remains
for at least 15 seconds.
2)
Elderly people
We also calculate the linear approximation of the phases.
Table VI shows the average absolute slant of phase’s change
in each section.
There are apparent differences of the phase changes
between young people and elderly people. Elderly people
have some difficulties to keep the pace of flipping their
hands. In phases, it is difficult to find the proper scale
representing an aging process.
C. Discussion
With the NSMs, there is no apparent change between
with and without a displayed motion example. Before 15
seconds, there is little decay of the memory of motion. After
16 seconds, Fig. 3 shows a little increase of the NSMs.
With the phases, there is apparent difference between
with and without a displayed motion example. The changes
of measured phases represent an error in the timing of a
measured motion. Some trials show delay, and others show
advance. The phase change shows the error about the
memory of the timing. The proposed method measures the
timing and the process of movements. A classical tapping
test measures the timing only. However, in this experiment,
the difference of 0.001 radian in phase is the difference of
0.00016 seconds in time. The proposed timing measure about
motor function based on the phase of the basic movement is
very keen. The classical tapping test can measure the
difference of 0.0001 seconds now. However, the mechanical
features about a hand and a switch make it difficult to
measure the small difference of time.
V.
CONCLUSION
This paper proposes the pair of the measurement and
evaluation method of motor control function to estimate the
deterioration with an aging process. The proposed method is
implemented and tested in experiments. The task is easy to
perform. For instance, it needs only 25 seconds. The

proposed Non-Smoothness Measure has enough power of
discrimination of a motor control function. The phase
changes also have enough power to measure the very small
error in timing remembered.
The experimental results confirm that the proposed
method can measure and evaluate the deterioration of a
motor control function with an aging process precisely. This
paper proposed a method to estimate the age according to the
aging process of the motor control function. This age helps to
measure the deterioration of the brain function, and it can
detect the very first stage of cognitive impairment. We will
perform larger scale experiments in the next step.
