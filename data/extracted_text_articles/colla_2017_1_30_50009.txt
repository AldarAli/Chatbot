Abstract—Collaborative decision making processes exchange in-
formation, data and opinions between the actors involved in
their resolution. As a result, their preferences are often modiﬁed.
In order to identify the social leaders (those who inﬂuence
others), one must analyze the magnitude of the change in each
actor´’s preference structure and its relation to the opinions and
preferences expressed by the others. Networks created from the
interactions between the actors permit to calculate measures of
trust and reputation. In this work, we derive a measure of the
inﬂuence received by the decision makers, obtained from their
conﬁdence in those with whom they interact during a decision
making process, carried out by the Analytical Hierarchical
Process (AHP) in the framework of e–Cognocracy.
Keywords–AHP; e-Cognocracy; Trust; Reputation; Inﬂuence.

INTRODUCTION
Decision making in the Knowledge Society is a collabora-
tive task; a correct decision requires individual motivations,
but an effective decision also requires the acquisition of
information from external sources to assess the outcomes of the
decision made. In a decision making process, several actors or
agents intervene, exchanging opinions and data, and providing
arguments through debates.
These actors have channels through which to exchange this
information, constituting a network in which this exchange
often coexists with another series of actions or experiences
shared by the same decision makers, belonging to areas beyond
the decision in question. The set of actions that the actors carry
out in the network, together with the information that some
actors obtain from others, generate trust in one another. In
turn, actors earn a reputation, which can make them inﬂuential.
In order to understand the nature of the decision making
processes, it is important to identify the social leaders -the
persons whose opinions inﬂuence the preferences of others,
and to obtain a measure of how they inﬂuence the other actors’
preferences.
This paper details the way to obtain the network of
inﬂuence of the actors involved in group decision and, from
them, determine their inﬂuence, in the framework of a decision
making process that uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process
(AHP) under the paradigm of e-Cognocracy.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II introduces the concepts of reputation and inﬂuence, the
methodology on which the calculation of inﬂuence, known as
e-Cognocracy, is based, and the multicriteria approach used,
AHP. Section III shows the proposed procedure for determin-
ing the inﬂuence of decision makers and their relationship with
reputation. Section IV shows the results obtained in a real
experience that was carried out following this methodology.
Finally, Section V contains the most outstanding conclusions
of this work, as well as possible extensions of the same and
future lines of work.

BACKGROUND
The determination of inﬂuence requires the calculation of
trust between actors and the reputation of each of them. On
the other hand, the present study has been carried out using
the AHP methodology for decision making, within the e-
Cognocracy framework.
A. Trust, reputation and inﬂuence
Trust and reputation are studied in many different disci-
plines [1] as key factors to explain the behavior of people
integrated into social networks.
We can consider that, given a set of actors D
=
{D1, . . . , DN}, the trust τij of the actor Di in the actor
Dj is the expectation that Di puts in that Dj adopts a
certain behavior at a given moment (see, for example, [2]).
While the reputation ri of the actor Di is a measure of the
prestige that Di has among the other actors, understood as
the perception that the agent creates past actions about its
intentions and norms [1]. Trust is a subjective indicator, which
is usually built on the basis of the personal impressions that
an actor derives from another, through the observation of the
interactions between them; the reputation of an actor is a single
value obtained from observations carried out in the social
network to which the actor belongs [3].
Finally, reputation of an actor can inﬂuence the preferences
of other actors.
B. E–Cognocracy
The e-Cognocracy is a new model of democracy that
emerged in 2003 as a system to integrate immigration into
the Knowledge Society [4]. Since then, the Multicriteria De-
cision Making Group (GDMZ), a research group from the
University of Zaragoza, has been developing new philosophical
arguments to support its evolution and numerous technological
and methodological tools for its implementation.
E-Cognocracy combines the two most widespread models
of democracy at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century [5]:
representative or liberal democracy and participatory or direct
democracy. In this way, some of the limitations of represen-
tative democracies (lack of transparency and accountability
of representatives, and lack of participation and control of
citizens) and direct democracies (populism, overvaluation of

individual interests, lack of a long-term vision of the system,
etc.) are resolved.
In terms of its methodology, e-Cognocracy consists of
seven basic stages: (i) problem formulation; (ii) ﬁrst voting
round; (iii) discussion; (iv) second voting round; (v) knowledge
extraction, (vi) evaluation; (vii) documentation.
C. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
The AHP [6],[7] is a technique that allows the resolution
of multicriteria, multienvironment and multiactor problems,
incorporating into the model the subjective aspects and the
inherent uncertainty in the decision making of real systems.
This multicriteria technique combines the objective associated
to traditional science with the subjective associated to human
being. It also presents a well behavior in multiactor decision
making. Some main features of this method are: the modeling
of the problem through the construction of a hierarchy in which
the relevant aspects of the problem (criteria, alternatives, etc.)
are collected; the incorporation of preferences through pairwise
comparisons; and the deduction of a ratio scale derived from
relative preferences (judgements) measured on an absolute
scale.
Another of the most outstanding features of this mul-
ticriterion methodology is the possibility of evaluating the
decision maker’s consistency in the issuance of judgments, not
being necessary that such judgments be perfectly consistent or
cardinal transitive.
Basically, the original AHP method consists of four stages:
(1) construction of a model, in this case a hierarchy, that
represents the decision problem; (2) incorporation of the
decision maker´’s judgments; this is made by making paired
comparisons between the elements of the same level of the
hierarchy with respect to the common node of the next higher
level; in this way, each judgment focuses on the comparison
of two elements with respect to a single characteristic; (3)
calculation, from the pairwise comparison matrices issued by
the decision maker in the previous stage, of the values that
determine the relative importance of the elements of a level
with respect to a node of the higher level (local priorities) and
then the global priorities of all the elements of the hierarchy
are obtained; and (4) synthesis of the global priorities of the
alternatives to obtain their total or ﬁnal priorities.
III.
DETERMINATION OF THE INFLUENCES
In a discrete multicriteria multiactor decision problem
following the methodology of e-Cognocracy, the preference
structure of each decision maker can be modiﬁed from the
ﬁrst round to the second. This modiﬁcation may be due to the
inﬂuence received during the discussion stage, after analyzing
the contribution of the other actors. The result of all the
interactions that take place during the debate process is a
matrix of trusts T = (τij)N×N (some may be empty, if there is
no interaction between two actors), and a vector of reputations
R = (r1, . . . , rN)T . The interactions between the decision
makers (corresponding to the non-null elements of T ) deﬁne a
network of trusts, that is, a directed acyclic graph G(D, E) in
which the vertices are the actors and E = (eij) is the matrix
of adjacencies of the graph G:
eij =

0
otherwise
(1)
where ℜ is the relationship Di ℜDj ⇔ Dj has generated trust
in Di.
If A = {A1, . . . , AM} are the alternatives and wk =
(ωk
1, . . . , ωk
M) the preference structure of the decision maker
Dk, then wk ∈ SM for k = 1, . . . , N, being
SM = {(w1, . . . , wM) | wi ≥ 0 and
M
X
i=1
wi = 1}
(2)
the compositional space or simplex M-dimensional.
In order to determine the inﬂuence that each actor has
received from those with whom it has interacted, the center of
inﬂuence of each actor Di is calculated, that is, a representative
position of all the actors that have exerted their inﬂuence on
him. This position corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the
preference structures of the decision makers Dj belonging to
his/her network of inﬂuences, weighted by the trust τij:

and xj = (xj
1, . . . , xj
M−1) is the projection of the preference
structure wj of actor Dj in the last round (ﬁnal decision) on the
Cartesian space RM−1, using the centered log-ratio transform

(4)
The purpose of this transformation is to convert a decision
maker’s preference structure into values for which it makes
sense to calculate Cartesian distances. The extent to which the
distance between the position of the decision maker Di and
his/her center of inﬂuence has changed between rounds is a
measure of the inﬂuence received.

APPLICATION TO A REAL EXPERIENCE
In April 2015 an experiment was carried out on the
selection of the best mobility strategy in the city of Zaragoza,
taking as a starting point the tram line existing at that time.
The problem consisted of four alternatives, proposed by four
political parties, and was carried out in two voting rounds with
an intermediate debate, in which the students of the subject
Electronic Government and Public Decisions intervened, and
to which were also invited the representatives of the political
parties that presented candidacy to the Council of Zaragoza
for the impending municipal elections [8]. In total, 27 people
participated in the discussion, although only 16 of them
participated in the two rounds of voting, and therefore they
were the only ones with whom this study could be carried out.
The discussion took place on the Social Cognocracy Network
(SCN) [9], a social network designed by the GDMZ based on
the e-Cognocracy. Through this social network, the discussion
stage provides measures of the actors’ trust and reputation [10].
After the ﬁrst voting round, a discussion was developed
in the forum, with the participation of the students and the
political representatives. In the forum, each actor Dj could
valuate the reputation of the others, as well as the importance
of the topics and the comments to the topics that were posted,
by giving values from 0 to 10 to three quantitative indices:

Actors were also able to assess the importance of their own
topics and comments, and even to rate themselves (self-trust).
From these indices, the reputation ri of each actor and the
relevance of topics (RT
i ) and comments (RC
i ) were obtained,
using the expressions:
ri =

(5)
being N the total number of comments posted to a topic and
nc the number of answers to a speciﬁc comment in that topic.
This process is recursive, so that a valuation emitted at an
instant modiﬁes the previous values, that are recalculated.
Then, a second voting round was performed, and the voters’
preference structures were obtained.
Figure 1 shows the inﬂuence network obtained after the
discussion stage, as well as the reputation and the preferred
alternative of the actors who participated in the three stages.
Table I shows the values obtained for the inﬂuence index after
the two voting rounds and the discussion.
Analyzing the reputation and the inﬂuence indices, several
well differentiated proﬁles are found:
1)
Users with a high inﬂuence index and a low reputa-
tion, whose network of inﬂuence is formed by high
reputation users: U00041G, U00057H.
2)
Users with a low inﬂuence index and a high reputa-
tion, whose network of inﬂuence is formed by users

maker it represents.
of high reputation: U00002C, U00018D, L19, Omael

3)
Users with a low inﬂuence index and a low reputa-
tion, whose network of inﬂuence is formed by high
reputation users: U00003I, Johnny Snow, U00031B.
4)
Other users: Humano anonimo, Paul Gascoigne,
U00027C, U00034J, U00039J, U00047C.
Users with proﬁle 4 correspond to cases in which no
clear pattern can be identiﬁed, either because the number of
inﬂuencers is scarce or because their network of inﬂuence is
composed of people of very different reputations. The three
other proﬁles are perfectly characterized, observing how all the
decision makers with high inﬂuence index (ﬁrst proﬁle) have
modiﬁed their main decision between one round and another,
behavior that is not observed in the decision makers with low
inﬂuence rates.
V.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Based on the reputations of the decision makers obtained
in a multiactor decision making process, we construct an indi-
cator of the inﬂuence that a decision maker receives from the
actors with whom he interacts. This indicator makes it possible
to identify the most inﬂuential actors and, consequently, those
who have received a greater inﬂuence from others. These
others can be identiﬁed through his/her network of inﬂuence.
Our future work will focus on the analysis of the content
of the messages using text mining techniques, which will
allow for the combination of the quantitative analysis with
a qualitative analysis that accurately identiﬁes the arguments
presented during the debate.
