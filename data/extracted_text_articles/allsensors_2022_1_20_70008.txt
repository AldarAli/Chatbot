Abstract— Communications within personal working/living 
spaces are highly demanded. To support people’s wayfinding 
activities, we propose a Visible Light Communication (VLC) 
cooperative system that supports guidance services and uses an 
edge/fog-based architecture for wayfinding services. A mesh 
cellular hybrid structure is proposed. The dynamic navigation 
system is composed of several transmitters (ceiling luminaries), 
which send the map information and path messages required 
to wayfinding. The luminaires are equipped with one of two 
types of nodes: a “mesh” controller that connects with other 
nodes in its vicinity and can forward messages to other devices 
in the mesh, effectively acting like routers nodes in the network 
and a “mesh/cellular” hybrid controller, that is also equipped 
with a modem providing IP base connectivity to the central 
manager services. These nodes act as border-router and can be 
used for edge computing. Mobile optical receivers, using joint 
transmission, collect the data at high frame rates, extracts their 
location to perform positioning and, concomitantly, the 
transmitted data from each transmitter. Each luminaire, 
through VLC, reports its geographic position and specific 
information to the users, making it available for whatever use. 
Bidirectional communication is implemented and the best 
route to navigate through venue calculated. The results show 
that the system makes possible not only the self-localization, 
but also to infer the travel direction and to interact with 
information received optimizing the route towards a static or 
dynamic destination.

INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, wireless networks have seen a demand for 
increased data rate requirements. For a realistic coverage 
with the data rate requirements, a large bandwidth is needed 
which remains a limiting factor when compared with the RF 
communication technologies. Consequently, research has 
started 
exploring 
alternate 
wireless 
transmission 
technologies to meet the ever-increasing demand. In this 
context, the huge bandwidth available in the unlicensed 
electromagnetic spectrum in the optical domain is seen as a 
promising solution to the spectrum crunch.  
Visible Light Communication (VLC) makes use of the 
higher frequencies in the visual band and extends the 
capabilities of data transmission using general light sources. 
VLC has been regarded as an additional communication 
technology [1] [2] to fulfill the high data rate demands and 
as a new affiliate in the beyond fifth generation (5G) 
heterogeneous networks. It can be easily used in indoor 
environments using the existing LED lighting infrastructure 
with few modifications [3] [4]. Research has shown that 
compared to outdoors, people tend to lose orientation a lot 
easier within complex buildings [5] [6]. Fine-grained indoor 
localization can be useful, enabling several applications [7] [ 
8].  
This work focuses on the use of VLC as a support for the 
transmission of information, providing advertising services 
and specific information to users. The goal is a cooperative 
system that supports guidance services and uses an edge/fog 
based architecture for wayfinding services. Here, the 
luminaire, through VLC, reports its geographical positions 
and specific information to the users since its infrastructure 
can also be reused to embed the fog nodes in them. The 
system is composed of several transmitters (LEDs 
luminaries), which send the map information and path 
messages required to wayfinding. Data is encoded, 
modulated and converted into light signals emitted by the 
transmitters. Every mobile terminal is equipped with a 
receiver module for receiving the mapped information 
generated from the ceiling light and displays this 
information in the mobile terminal. The receiver module 
includes a photodetector based on a tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H 
pin/pin light-controlled filter [9] [10].  
Visible light can be used as an ID system and can be 
employed for identifying the room number and the building 
itself. The main idea is to divide the service area into spatial 
beams originating from the different ID light sources and 
identify each beam with a unique timed sequence of light 
signals. The signboards, based on arrays of LEDs, 
positioned in strategic directions to broadcast the

information [11], are modulated acting as down- and up-link 
channels in the bidirectional communication. For the 
consumer services, the applications are enormous. The 
objective is to allow the implementation of new services in 
these areas using data from the VLC System, for indoor and 
outdoor. Positioning, navigation, security and even mission 
critical services are possible use cases that should be 
implemented.  
In this paper, a LED-supported guidance VLC system is 
proposed. After the Introduction, in Section II, the 
communication system is described. In Section III, the main 
experimental results are presented, downlink and uplink 
transmission is implemented and the best route to navigate 
calculated. In Section IV, the conclusions are drawn. 
II. 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, DESIGN AND 
ARCHITECTURE 
The main goal is to specify the system conceptual design 
and define a set of use cases for a VLC based guidance 
system to be used by mobile users inside large buildings. 
 
A. 
Communication system and cooperative localization 
The system is composed by two modules: the transmitter 
and the receiver. The block diagram and the transmitter and 
receiver relative positions are presented in Figure 1. Both 
communication modules are software defined, where

Data from the sender is converted into an intermediate 
data representation, byte format, and converted into light 
signals emitted by the transmitter module. The data bit 
stream is input to a modulator where an ON–OFF Keying 
(OOK) modulation is utilized. On the transmission side, a 
modulation and conversion from digital to analog data is 
done. The driver circuit will keep an average value (DC 
power level) for illumination, combining it with the analog 
data intended for communication. The visible light emitted 
by the LEDs passes through the transmission medium and is 
then received by the MUX device.  
To realize both the communication and the building 
illumination, white light tetra-chromatic sources are used 
providing a different data channel for each chip. Each 
luminaire is composed of four white LEDs framed at the 
corners of a square. At each node, only one chip of the LED 
is modulated for data transmission, the Red (R: 626 nm), the 
Green (G: 530 nm), the Blue (B: 470 nm) or the Violet (V). 
Data is encoded, modulated and converted into light signals 
emitted by the transmitters. Modulation and digital-to-
analog conversion of the information bits is done using 
signal processing techniques. The signal is propagating 
through the optical channel and a VLC receiver, at the 
reception end of the communication link, is responsible to 
extract the data from the modulated light beam. It 
transforms the light signal into an electrical signal that is 
subsequently decoded to extract the transmitted information.

On the receiving side, this is first done by a silicon

converted back to digital format for demodulation. The

system controller consists of a set of programmable 
modules. To receive the I2V information from several 
transmitters, the receiver must be located at the overlap of 
the circles that set the transmission range (radial) of each 
transmitter. The coverage map for a square unit cell is 
displayed in Figure 2. The LEDs are modeled as Lambertian 
sources where the luminance is distributed uniformly in all 
directions, whereas the luminous intensity is different in all 
directions [12]. The nine possible overlaps (#1-#9), defined 
as fingerprint regions, as well as receiver orientations (2-9 
steering angles; ) are also pointed out for the unit square 
cell in Figure 2. The input of the aided navigation system is 
the coded signal sent by the transmitters to an identify user, 
and includes its position in the network P(x, y, z), inside the 
unit cell and the steering angle, , that guides the user across 
his path. The device receives multiple signals, finds the 
centroid of the received coordinates, and stores it as the 
reference point position. Nine reference points, for each unit 
cell, are identified giving a fine-grained resolution in the 
localization of the mobile device across each cell.  
The VLC photosensitive receiver is a double pin/pin 
photodetector based on a tandem heterostructure, p-i'-n/p-i-n 
sandwiched between two conductive transparent contacts. 
Exposed to light, the device offers high sensitivity and 
linear response, generating a proportional electrical current. 
Its quick response enables the possibility of high-speed 
communications. Since the photodetector response is 
insensitive to the frequency, phase, or polarization of the 
carriers, this kind of receiver is useful for intensity-
modulated signals. The generated photocurrent is processed 
using a transimpedance circuit obtaining a proportional 
voltage. An OOK modulation scheme was used to code the 
information. This way digital data is represented by the 
presence or absence of a carrier wave. The obtained voltage 
is then processed, by using signal conditioning techniques 
(adaptive bandpass filtering and amplification, triggering 
and demultiplexing), until the data signal is reconstructed at 
the data processing unit (digital conversion, decoding and 
decision) [13] [14].

Architecture 
and 
Multi-person 
Cooperative 
Localization   
Fog/Edge computing bridges the gap between the cloud 
and 
end 
devices 
by 
enabling 
computing, 
storage, 
networking, and data management on network nodes within 
the close vicinity of IoT devices. A mesh network is a good 
fit since it dynamically reconfigures itself and grows with 
the size of any installation. In Figure 3, the proposed 
architecture is illustrated. 
Under this architecture, the short-range mesh network 
purpose is twofold: enable edge computing and device-to-
cloud communication, by ensuring a secure communication 
from a luminaire controller to the edge computer or 
datacenter (I2CM), through a neighbor luminaire/signboard 
controller with an active cellular connection; and enable 
peer-to-peer communication (I2I), to exchange information. 
It performs much of the processing on embedded computing 
platforms, directly interfacing to sensors and controllers. It 
supports geo-distribution, local decision making, and real-
time load-balancing. Moreover, it depends on the 
collaboration of near-located end-user devices, instead of 
relying on the remote servers, which reduces the 
deployment costs and delay.

Scenario and building model 
Building a geometry model of buildings’ interiors is 
complex. 
In 
the 
proposed 
architecture 
each 
room/crossing/exit represents a node, and a path as the links 
between nodes. The proposed scenario is a multi-level 
building. Lighting in large environments is designed to 
illuminate the entire space in a uniform way. Ceiling plans 
for the LED array layout, in floor level is shown in Figure 4.

available time, he adds customized points of interest 
(wayfinding services). The requested information (I2D) is 
sent by the emitters at the ceiling to its receiver. 
The indoor route throughout the building (track) is 
presented to the user by a responding message transmitted 
by the ceiling luminaires that work also either as router or 
mesh/cellular nodes. With this request/response concept, the 
generated landmark-based instructions help the user to 
unambiguously identify the correct decision point where a 
change of direction (pose) is needed, as well as offer 
information for the user to confirm that he/she is on the right 
way. 
III. 
GEOTRACKING, NAVIGATION AND ROUTE CONTROL  
Bi-directional communication between the infrastructure 
and the mobile receiver is analyzed. 
 
A. Communication 
protocol 
and 
coding/decoding 
techniques 
To code the information, an On-Off Keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used, and it was considered a 
synchronous transmission based on a 64- bits data frame.  
The frame is divided into six blocks (Sync, ID, 
pin1/pin2, Angle , Request/Response and Wayfinding 
Data). The first block is the synchronization block [10101], 
the last is the payload data (wayfinding message) and a stop 
bit ends the frame. The second block, the ID block, 4+4+4 
bits, gives the geolocation (x,y,z coordinates) of the emitters 
inside the array (Xi,j,k). Cell’s IDs are encoded using a 4 bits 
binary representation for the decimal number. When 
bidirectional communication is required, the user must 
register by choosing a username (pin1) with 4 decimal 
numbers, each one associated to a RGBV channel. If buddy 
friend services are required a 4-binary code of the meeting 
(pin2) must be inserted. The  block (steering angle ()) 
completes the pose in a frame time q(x,y, , t). Eight 
steering angles along the cardinal points are possible from a 
start point to the next goal as pointed out as dotted arrows in 
Figure 4. The codes assigned to the pin2 and to  are the 
same in all the channels. If no wayfinding services are 
required these last three blocks are set at zero and the user 
only receives its own location. The last block is used to 
transmit the wayfinding message.  
When bidirectional communication is required, the user 
must register by choosing a username (pin1) with 4 decimal 
numbers, each one associated to a colour channel. So, to 
compose the decimal code each digit (0-9) has its own 
colour, codified in a 4-binary bit code. If buddy friend 
services are required a 4-binary code of the meeting (pin2) 
must be inserted. The  block (steering angle ()) completes 
the pose in a frame time q(x,y, , t). Eight steering angles 
along the cardinal points and coded with the same number 
of the footprints in the unit cell (Figure 2) are possible from 
a start point to the next goal. If no wayfinding services are 
required these last three blocks are set at zero and the user 
only receives its own location. The last block is used to 
transmit the wayfinding message. A stop bit is used at the 
end of each frame.

Based on the measured photocurrent signal by the

establish this assignment. In Figure 5a, it is plotted the 
calibration curve that uses 16 distinct photocurrent 
thresholds resultant from the combination of the RGBV 
modulated signals from VLC emitter. The correspondence 
between each 4-binary code and the photocurrent level is

synchronization header [10101] is imposed simultaneously 
to all emitters. In the second block, labelled as calibration, 
the bit sequence was chosen to allow all the on/off sixteen 
possible combinations of the four RGBV input channels (24). 
Finally, a random message was transmitted [15]. Comparing 
the calibrated levels (d0-d15) with the different assigned 4-
digit binary [RGBV] codes, ascribed to each level, the 
decoding is straightforward, and the message decoded [16]. 
In Figure 5b, the MUX received signal and the decoding 
information that allows the VLC geotracking and guidance 
in successive instants (t0, t1, t2) from user “7261” guiding 
him along his track is exemplified. The visualized cells, 
paths, and the reference points (footprints) are also shown as 
inserts. Data shows that at t0 the network location of the 
received signals is R3,2,1, G3,1,1, B4,2,1 and V4,1,1, at t1 the user 
receives the signal only from the R3,2,1, B4,2,1 nodes and at t2 
he was moved to the next cell since the node G3,1,1 was 
added at the receiver. Hence, the mobile user “7261” begins 
his route into position #1 (t0) and wants to be directed to his 
goal position, in the next cell (# 9). During the route the 
navigator is guided to E (code 3) and, at t1, steers to SE 
(code 2), cross footprint #2 (t3) and arrives to #9. The 
ceiling lamps (landmarks) spread over all the building and 
act as edge/fog nodes in the network, providing well-
structured paths that maintain a navigator’s orientation with 
respect to both the next landmark along the path and the 
distance to the eventual destination. Also, the VLC dynamic 
system enables cooperative and oppositional geolocation. In 
some cases, it is in the user’s interest to be accurately 
located, so that they can be offered information relevant to 
their location and orientation (pin 1, pin2 and  blocks). In 
other cases, users prefer not to disclose their location for 
privacy, in this case these last three blocks are set at zero 
and the user only receives its own location.  
 
B. Multi-person cooperative localization and guidance 
services 
Bi-directional communication between VLC emitters 
and receivers is available at a VLC ready handheld device, 
through the control manager interconnected with a 
signboard receiver located at each unit cells (#1). These 
communications channels constitute the uplink (D2I) and 
downlink channels (I2D). Each user (D2I) sends to the local 
controller a “request” message with the pose, qi (t), (x,y,z, ), 
user code (pin1) and also adds its needs (code meeting and 
wayfinding data). For route coordination the CM, using the 
information of the network’s VLC location capability, sends 
a personalized “response” message to each client at the 
requested pose with his wayfinding needs. 
In Figure 6, the MUX synchronized signals received by 
two users that have requested wayfinding services, at 
different times, are displayed. We have assumed that a user 
located at C2,3,-1,  arrived first (t1), auto-identified as 
("7261") and informed the controller of his intention to find 
a friend for a previously scheduled meeting (code 3). A 
buddy list is then generated and will include all the users 
who have the same meeting code. User “3009” arrives later 
(t3), sends the alert notification (C4,4,1; t3) to be triggered 
when his friend is in his floor vicinity, level 1, identifies 
himself (“3009”) and uses the same code (code 3), to track 
the best way to his meeting.

After this request (t3), the buddy finder service uses the 
location information from both user’ devices to determine 
the proximity of their owners (qij (t)) and sends a response 
message with the best route to the meeting.  
The pedestrian movement along the path can be thought 
as a queue, where the pedestrians arrive at a path, wait if the 
path is congested and then move once the congestion 
reduces.

model the queuing system: The initial arrival time (t0) and 
the path, respectively, defined as the time when the 
pedestrian leaves the previous path and the actual movement 
along the path, qi (t, t’). Here, the service time is calculated 
using walking speed and distance of the path. The number 
of service units or resources is determined from the capacity 
of the path, n(qi (x,y,z, , t))  and walking speed that depends 
on the number of request services, and on the direction of 
movement along the path qi (x,y,z, , t). Since the number of 
service units is same as the capacity of the path, the queue 
size is theoretically zero. Once appended by the CM 
(request message), the pedestrians are served immediately 
(response message). If the number of pedestrians exceeds 
the path capacity, a backlog is automatically formed until 
the starting node. The hybrid controller integrates the 
number of requests and individual positions received during 
the same time interval. Once the individual positions are 
known, qi (t), the relative positions are calculated, qij (t). If 
the relative position is less than a threshold distance, a 
crowded region locally exists, and an alert message is sent 
for the users. This alert allows the CM to recalculate, in real 
time, the best route for the users, qi (t,t´), that request 
wayfinding services avoiding crowded regions. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A cooperative indoor VLC localization and navigation 
system is proposed. In a multi-level building scenario, the 
architecture 
of 
the 
system 
and 
the 
protocol 
of 
communication were defined. Bi-directional communication 
between the infrastructure and the mobile receiver was 
analyzed. According to global results, the location of a 
mobile receiver is found in conjunction with data 
transmission. VLC's dynamic LED-aided navigation system 
is designed to give users accurate route guidance and enable 
navigation and geotracking. The multi-person cooperative 
localization system detects crowded regions and alerts the 
user to reschedule meetups, as well as provides guidance 
information. With those alerts, the CM can recalculate, in 
real time, the best route for users requesting wayfinding 
services, avoiding crowded areas.
