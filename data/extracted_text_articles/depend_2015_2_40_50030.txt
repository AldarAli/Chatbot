Abstract— With the proliferation of fairly powerful mobile 
devices and ubiquitous wireless technology, traditional mobile 
ad hoc networks (MANETs) now migrate into a new era of 
service oriented MANETs wherein a mobile device can provide 
and receive service from other mobile devices it encounters 
and interacts with. We discuss our ongoing research efforts in 
trust management and trust-based algorithm design for 
service-oriented MANET applications to answer the challenges 
of MANET environments, including no centralized authority, 
dynamically changing topology, limited bandwidth and battery 
power, limited observations, unreliable communication, and 
the presence of malicious nodes who act to break the system 
functionality as well as selfish nodes who act to maximize their 
own gain. We also highlight key ideas and experiences learned, 
and provide future research directions.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
An autonomous service-oriented mobile ad hoc network 
(MANET) is populated with service providers (SPs) and 
service requesters (SRs). A realization of service-oriented 
MANETs is a web-based peer-to-peer service system with 
mobile nodes providing web services and users (through 
their mobile devices) invoking web services. Unlike a web 
service system in which nodes are connected to the Internet, 
nodes in service-oriented MANETs are mobile and the 
communication between peers not within radio range is 
multi-hop with nodes in the system serving as routers. One 
can view a service-oriented MANET as an instance of  
Internet of Things (IoT) systems [7] with a wide range of 
mobile applications including smart-city, smart tourism, 
smart car, smart environmental monitoring, and healthcare 
[1]. It is particularly suitable to military applications where 
all nodes are mobile with multi-hop communication. 
This paper discusses our ongoing research work in trust 
management and trust-based algorithm design for service-
oriented MANETs, key ideas and experiences learned, and 
future research directions. Our aims are to (1) identify trust 
dimensions for service-oriented MANET applications; (2) 
develop an efficient and effective trust protocol for service-
oriented MANETs; and (3) develop efficient and effective 
trust-based algorithms for a set of service-oriented MANET 
applications. The overarching principle is the design notion 
of adaptive control, allowing trust computation, aggregation, 
propagation, formation (out of multiple trust dimensions) 
and update decisions to be dynamically adjusted to minimize 
trust bias and maximize application performance. This goal 
is to be achieved in the presence of malicious mobile devices 
performing a wide range of attacks, including bad-mouthing, 
ballot-stuffing, packet dropping, opportunistic service, self-
promotion, conflicting behavior, and on-off service attacks 
for personal gain. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
discusses related work. Section III discusses the threat model 
for service-oriented MANETs. Section IV presents our 
solutions toward trust management of mobile devices in 
service oriented MANETs. Section V presents our solutions 
toward trust-based service management for performance 
optimization of service-oriented MANET applications.  
Section VI summarizes key research ideas and experiences 
learned. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper and 
outlines future research directions.

RELATED WORK 
Many existing trust models for predicting trust are based 
on Bayesian inference [3]. Bayesian inference treats trust as 
a random variable following a probability distribution (e.g., 
Beta distribution) with its model parameters being updated 
upon new observations. A shortcoming of Bayesian 
inference is that trust value does not reveal the uncertainty of 
trust since it is just a mean. For example, the same trust value 
can be given to two nodes despite one node was observed for 
just 2 times, while the other node was observed for 20 times. 
Belief theory or subjective logic trust models [9] have been 
proposed to remedy the problem mentioned above, by 
introducing uncertainty into trust calculation. Fuzzy logic 
based trust models are also well studied in the literature [12]. 
Instead of using a binary set, a membership function is 
defined indicating the degree to which a node is considered 
trustworthy. Relative to the works cited above based on 
Bayesian inference, belief theory, or fuzzy logic, we take an 
entirely different approach. Our root is in statistical analysis. 
We develop a regression-based trust model to learn the 
behavior pattern of a SP, taking context information into 
consideration to estimate the reliability trust of a SP that is 
selected by a SR to execute a service request under a 
particular environment context.  
A significant amount of work has been done in the area 
of trust-based defenses against attacks in MANETs [13]-
[18], [35]-[38]. A common drawback is that dynamically 
tuning trust parameters may perform poorly when a node 
38

does not have enough self-observation experiences with 
other nodes in MANET environments and must rely on 
recommendations. Different from the works cited above, we 
advocate the use a robust statistical kernel to tolerate false 
recommendations to effectively achieve resiliency against 
recommendation attacks. Also unlike existing work, our goal 
is not to identify “bad” SPs, but to predict whether a SP, 
whether “good” or “bad,” can provide good service, given a 
set of context variables characterizing the MANET 
operational environment, including dynamically changing 
topology, limited bandwidth, battery power, and unreliable 
communication. In our approach, a SR learns and predicts a 
SP’s service behavior taking context information into 
consideration, instead of just judging a SP’s trustworthiness 
from self-observations or recommendations received, as 
having been done in existing works.  
III. 
THREAT MODEL 
Just like Internet-based web services, in a service-
oriented MANET there are malicious SPs acting for their 
own gain. The common goal of malicious nodes is to 
increase their chance of being selected for providing service. 
Malicious nodes can collude to achieve this common goal. 
We consider the following malicious attacks in our research: 
1. Bad-mouthing attacks: a malicious node can ruin the 
trust 
of 
a 
good 
node 
(by 
providing 
bad 
recommendations against it) so as to decrease the 
chance of that node being selected for service. This is a 
form of collusion recommendation attacks, i.e., a 
malicious node can collaborate with other malicious 
nodes to ruin the trust of a good node. 
2. Ballot-stuffing attacks: a malicious node can boost the 
trust of another malicious node (by providing good 
recommendations) so as to increase the chance of that 
malicious node being selected as a SP. This is another 
form of collusion recommendation attacks, i.e., a 
malicious node can collaborate with other malicious 
nodes to boost the trust of each other. 
3. Packet-dropping attacks: when serving as a packet 
relaying node, a malicious node can delay forwarding 
or simply drop data packets to ruin the trust of the 
source node.  
4. Opportunistic service attacks: a malicious node can 
provide good service to gain high reputation when it 
senses its trust status is low, and can provide bad 
service when it senses its trust status  is high.  
5. Self-promotion attacks: A malicious node can boost its 
service quality information so as to increase its chance 
of being selected as a SP. 
6. Conflicting behavior attacks: a malicious node can 
selectively provide satisfactory service for some SRs 
while unsatisfactory for others. Here, we note that a 
node’s best service quality is dictated by the 
environmental and operational conditions at the time a 
service request is issued. Therefore, a malicious node 
can only perform conflicting behavior attacks with a 
service quality not exceeding its best service quality. 
7. On-off attacks: instead of always performing its best 
service, a malicious node can perform bad service. With 
on-off attacks, a malicious node performs bad service 
on and off (or randomly) so as to avoid being labeled as 
a low trust node and risk itself not being selected as a 
SP, as well as not being able to effectively perform bad-
mouthing and ballot-stuffing attacks. One can view on-
off attacks as random attacks. 
A malicious node may also perform data modification 
attacks to ruin the reputation of a good node. We assume 
data/source authentication techniques based on PKI can 
prevent such attacks. A malicious node may also jam the 
communication channel or perform denial of service (DoS) 
attacks to overwhelm a SP. We assume that standard 
intrusion detection techniques [8] are in place to mitigate 
such attacks. 
IV. 
TRUST MANAGEMENT 
One challenge for implementing trust management in 
service-oriented MANETs is to reliably estimate the trust 
levels of SPs in a fully distributed manner, in contrast with 
an e-commerce system with a centralized authority for trust 
management. Most existing works take direct evidence for 
direct trust assessment and propagates its observations to 
other nodes as recommendations for indirect trust 
assessment. However, a malicious node may violate this 
protocol. Further, trust management of mobile devices must 
take “service context” information into consideration. Such 
service context information includes the current capability 
of a SP (e.g., energy status), the service environment (e.g., 
congested wireless traffic), the identity of the SR (e.g., a 
friend or a stranger), the payoff obtained (which is 
application-dependent), and the service cost (e.g., energy 
consumed). All these factors are called “context” variables 
based on which the service behavior of a node forms a 
pattern. The key to effective trust management is therefore 
to learn the service behavior pattern of a node toward these 
context variables. The behavior pattern learned can be used 
to assess the reliability trust [3] of a SP when it is selected 
to service a request in a particular context state 
characterized by these context variables.  
More specifically, within a specific type of service, SR 
𝑖’s observation 𝑠𝑖𝑖
𝑡  at time 𝑡 of the service quality received 
from SP 𝑗 is either “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory.” If the 
service quality is satisfactory, then 𝑠𝑖𝑖
𝑡 =1 and SP 𝑗  is 
considered trustworthy; otherwise, 𝑠𝑖𝑖
𝑡 =0 and SP 𝑗  is 
considered 
untrustworthy. 
Let 
the 
operational 
and 
environmental conditions at time 𝑡 be characterized by a set 
of distinct context variables deemed appropriate for an 
application, denoted by a column vector 𝐱𝑡 = [𝑥0
𝑡, … , 𝑥𝑚
𝑡 ]⊤, 
where 𝑥𝑖
𝑡  represents the ith context variable. Then, 
reliability trust or just trust for short is the probability that 
SP 𝑗 is capable of providing satisfactory service under the 
operational and environment conditions at time 𝑡 described 
by the context variable set 𝐱𝑡.  
Let 𝑘 (𝑘 ≠ 𝑖) be a recommender who had a prior service 
experience with SP 𝑗 and is asked by SR 𝑖 to provide its 
feedback regarding SP 𝑗. The recommendation from node 𝑘 
is in the form of [𝐱𝑡,  𝑠𝑘𝑖
𝑡 ] specifying the specific operational 
and environmental context conditions in 𝐱𝑡 under which the 
39

observation in 𝑠𝑘𝑖
𝑡  was made. For notational conveniences, 
let 𝐒𝒊𝒊 = ൣ𝑠𝑖𝑖
𝑡0, … , 𝑠𝑖𝑖
𝑡𝑛൧
⊤, 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗, denote 
the 
cumulative 
evidence gathered by SR 𝑖 regarding SP j’s service quality 
over 
[𝑡0, 𝑡𝑛]
including 
self-observations 
and 
recommendations. Also let 𝐗 = [𝐱𝑡0, … , 𝐱𝑡𝑛]⊤  denote the 
corresponding operational and environmental context 
conditions when the observations are made.  
The problem is to learn the service behavior pattern of 
SP 𝑗 by a latent variable 𝛃𝑖 between 𝑺𝒊𝒊 and 𝐗, and predict 
the probability that SP j is trustworthy at time t, given the 
context environment set at time n+1, 𝐱𝑡𝑛+1,  as input, 
i.e., 𝑇𝑖,𝑖
𝑡𝑛+1 = Pr൛𝑠𝑖𝑖
𝑡𝑛+1 = 1ห𝐱𝑡𝑛+1, 𝛃𝑖ൟ. Essentially 𝑇𝑖,𝑖
𝑡𝑛+1 
obtained above is the reliability trust of SP 𝑗 at time 𝑡𝑛+1 
from SR 𝑖’s perspective. The service quality at time n+1, 
𝑠̂𝑖𝑖
𝑡𝑛+1,  can be predicted by setting a trust threshold, 
depending on the SR’s tolerance for the risk.  
A common practice is to set the trust threshold as a value 
greater than 0.5. For example, if the trust threshold is set to 
be 0.6 by SR i then the requested service performed by SP j 
is predicted to be satisfactory when the predicted reliability 
trust is greater than 0.6. 
In [2], we utilized logit regression as the behavior 
pattern learning mechanism to solve the above trust 
assessment problem, resulting in a trust management 
protocol which we call LogitTrust.  
LogitTrust assesses each SP in terms of its service 
behavior 
patterns 
in 
response 
to 
operational 
and 
environmental changes characterized by three context 
variables: ൣ𝑥𝑒
𝑡, 𝑥𝑐
𝑡, 𝑥𝑝
𝑡൧for energy, capability, and price (or 
reward). Energy is used to measure the cost of task 
execution. In a congested environment the probability of 
wireless channel contention and signal interference will be 
high, so it will cost more for a SP to execute a task because 
the SP needs to consume more energy in listening to the 
channel and repeating packet transmission. The reasons for 
considering the above context variables in service-oriented 
MANET environments are: (a) a SP is more likely to 
provide inferior service when the cost of servicing the task 
is high (b) a SP is likely to provide inferior service when it 
is limited in resources and capability; and (c) a profit-aware 
SP is more likely to provide quality service when the SR 
offers a higher price.  
SR i will assess the three context variables ൣ𝑥𝑒
𝑡, 𝑥𝑐
𝑡, 𝑥𝑝
𝑡൧ 
while it sends a service request to SP j as follows: 𝑥𝑒
𝑡 is 
estimated by the number of neighbors sharing the channel as 
more energy is consumed for channel contention and packet 
retransmission when there are more nodes sharing the 
channel; 𝑥𝑐
𝑡 is estimated by the packet traffic to SP 𝑗 as more 
traffic to SP 𝑗 hinders its processing capability; 𝑥𝑝
𝑡 is SR i’s 
reward to SP j upon satisfactory service completion. When 
SP j completes the service, SR i will assess if the service is 
satisfactory (1) or not (0), and store the service outcome 
together with ൣ𝑥𝑒
𝑡, 𝑥𝑐
𝑡, 𝑥𝑝
𝑡൧ context information as one record 
in the dataset set for learning. It can also pass this 
experience record to another node as a recommendation.  A 
SR in the system uses its own self-observations and 
recommendations received to learn the behavior pattern of a 
SP, and predict the reliability trust of the SP on a service 
request in a particular context environment. 
Relying on its robust learning engine, LogitTrust is 
highly 
effective 
against 
dishonest 
recommendations 
(through bad-mouthing and ballot-stuffing attacks). It 
significantly outperforms existing trust computation models 
such as Beta reputation with belief discounting [3] and 
Adaptive Trust Management [4] in terms of trust accuracy 
because it takes context information into consideration in 
service behavior assessment. LogitTrust is also efficient in 
terms of computational complexity as it utilizes a simple 
linear model to model the relation between context variables 
and observations. 
With conflicting behavior attacks, a SP can selectively 
provide satisfactory service for some SRs while providing 
unsatisfactory service for others. In general, the relation 
between a SR and a SP determines the SP’s service attitude 
toward the SR. This is naturally solved by LogitTrust since 
LogitTrust is based on SR-SP pairing. That is, each SR 
evaluates each SP based on its own self-observations and 
filtered recommendations. If SP j provides bad services to a 
particular SR, then this evidence will be considered by this 
SR as it learns SP j’s behavior pattern (that is, 𝛃𝑖) and will 
not trust SP j with its service request. 
With on-off attacks, a malicious node will attack only 
randomly so as to evade detection and avoid being classified 
as a malicious node. To the system, this malicious node is 
not 100% of the time providing bad service, but just a 
percentage of time providing bad service. Therefore, SP j 
performing on-off attacks translates into SP j providing bad 
service only randomly instead of persistently, which is a 
pattern that can be learned by SR as LogitTrust learns SP j’s 
behavior pattern (that is, 𝛃𝑖). This in effect allows each SR 
to cope with a particular SP’s on-off attack behavior. 
V. 
TRUST-BASED ALGORITHM DESIGN FOR 
APPLICATION PERFORMANCE MAXIMIZATION 
Service-oriented MANET applications are on the rise 
thanks to the proliferation of fairly powerful mobile devices 
and ubiquitous wireless technology. We aim to design and 
validate trust-based algorithms for application performance 
maximization for service-oriented MANET applications 
with the goal of satisfying multiple objectives with 
conflicting goals to achieve multi-objective optimization 
(MOO).  
Trust-based service composition and binding (with or 
without MOO) has been studied in the web services domain 
but only a single-trust, i.e., a single dimension of trust, was 
considered. This largely ignores the fact that trust is multi-
dimensional. Identifying proper trust components and 
forming the overall trust out of multiple trust components to 
maximize application performance is of paramount 
importance. We advocate the use of two key trust 
dimensions 
in 
service 
request 
execution, 
namely, 
competence and integrity, as the building blocks of a 
composite trust metric.  
Below we discuss our trust-based service management 
40

DEPEND 2015 : The Eighth International Conference on Dependability

algorithm designs for solving two service-oriented MANET 
applications with MOO.  
In [5], we investigated a trust-based dynamic task 
assignment algorithm for performing dynamic task-to-node 
service assignments to satisfy multiple objectives with 
conflicting goals. The results demonstrated that our trust-
based solution has low complexity and yet can achieve 
performance comparable to that of the ideal solution with 
perfect knowledge of node reliability, and can significantly 
outperform the non-trust-based solution. We analyzed how 
MOO is achieved by the ideal, trust-based and non-trust-
based solutions, and identified parameter settings under 
which the trust protocol performance in terms of MOO is 
optimized for the trust-based solution which can best 
balance multiple objectives with conflicting goals. The 
results obtained are useful for dynamic trust management to 
maximize application performance in terms of MOO in the 
presence of malicious attacks.  
In [6], we investigated a trust-based service composition 
algorithm designed to satisfy mobile user service requests 
with multiple objectives including maximizing quality-of-
service (QoS) and quality-of-information (QoI) while 
minimizing the service cost (e.g., pricing) with the user 
satisfaction ultimately measuring success. With a service 
request in hand, a SR has to first formulate a service 
composition plan based on the available SPs it encounters 
and interacts with dynamically, and then determine the best 
node-to-service assignment for achieving MOO. Dynamic 
service composition and binding is especially complicated in 
MANETs because of the space-time complexity of mobile 
devices. This issue is further compounded by the fact that the 
information received is often malicious, erroneous, partly 
trusted, uncertain and incomplete in MANET environments. 
Our trust-based service composition and binding algorithm 
based on multi-trust outperforms the non-trust-based 
counterpart using blacklisting, as well as a single-trust-based 
algorithm using a traditional beta reputation system.  
Our trust-based algorithm has a linear runtime 
complexity and is able to achieve a solution quality 
approaching that generated by Integer Linear Programming 
without sacrificing much solution accuracy. We conducted a 
comparative performance analysis of single-trust vs. multi-
trust protocols for peer-to-peer trust evaluation in service-
oriented MANETs. We utilized trust to effectively prevent 
malicious nodes from disrupting the operation of a service-
oriented MANET. We conducted a detailed performance 
analysis and demonstrated that our trust-based algorithm can 
effectively penalize malicious nodes performing bad-
mouthing, ballot-stuffing packet dropping, self-promotion, or 
opportunistic service attacks, thus filtering out malicious 
nodes from service participation, and can ultimately lead to 
high user satisfaction. 
VI. 
KEY IDEAS AND EXPERIENCES LEARNED 
The major difference between a service-oriented 
MANET and an Internet-based web service system is that 
the information received in MANET environments is often 
malicious, 
erroneous, 
partly 
trusted, 
uncertain 
and 
incomplete. In this paper we discussed key research ideas 
for trust-based service management of mobile devices in 
service-oriented MANETs wherein every node can be a 
service provider or a service requester.  
The first key idea is to take special characteristics of 
service-oriented MANET environments into consideration 
so as to design an efficient and effective trust protocol. We 
discussed a novel logit regression-based trust model called 
LogitTrust to dynamically estimate the trust of a mobile 
device based on how it behaves in response to dynamically 
changing MANET environments characterized by a set of 
context 
variables. 
LogitTrust 
outperforms 
traditional 
approaches based on Bayesian Inference with belief 
discounting in terms of trust accuracy and resiliency against 
attacks, while maintaining a low false positive rate. It is 
efficient as it adopts a simple liner model for behavior 
learning with low computational complexity. It is effective 
since it reflects dynamic MANET characteristics, such as 
limited bandwidth and battery power, as context variables in 
the learning model formulation.  
The 2nd key idea is to use multi-trust instead of single-
trust for trust-based algorithm design, recognizing multi-
dimensional trust assessment is critical for decision makings. 
The 3rd key idea is that multi-trust-based algorithm 
design is application specific. One must apply the best trust 
formation tailored to the application requirements to achieve 
application performance maximization, especially for those 
applications with multi-objective optimization goals. We 
demonstrated 
that 
our 
multi-trust-based 
algorithm 
outperforms its non-trust-based and single-trust-based 
counterparts with multi-objective optimization over a range 
of service-oriented MANET applications, including node-
to-service composition and binding, and node-to-task 
assignment 
MANET 
applications. 
Furthermore, 
we 
demonstrated that our multi-trust-based algorithms for 
solving these problems are efficient (with linear runtime 
complexity) and effective without compromising solution 
optimality, when compared with non-trust-based solutions, 
and other single-trust-based solutions based on Bayesian 
inference.  
VII. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS 
There are several future research directions for trust 
management 
of 
mobile 
devices 
in 
service-oriented 
MANETs:  
First, we plan to address the issue of runtime learning 
and decision making for MANET nodes with limited 
storage and computation resources. This may involve the 
use of heuristics for each resource-limited node to store 
most relevant trust records [10].  
Second, we plan to incorporate adaptive control to the 
trust protocol design. A possible direction is to use a 
recommendation filtering mechanism to dynamically decide 
if a recommendation is to be taken or not. Adaptive control 
may be achieved by adjusting the recommender filtering 
threshold value based on the hostility level in the 
environment. When the hostility level is low (i.e., not many 
“bad” nodes are out there), one can set a low threshold so as 
to take in recommendations into the dataset, because 
chances are all recommendations are benign. On the other 
41

DEPEND 2015 : The Eighth International Conference on Dependability

hand, when the hostility level is high, one can set a high 
threshold to filter out false recommendations so as not to 
contaminate the dataset for effective behavior learning.  
Third, although we have reflected MANET environment 
characteristics such as limited bandwidth and energy power 
as context variables in our trust model formulation, we have 
not considered node social behaviors which can also be 
treated as context information. A context variable such as 
“friendship” can dictate whether a node will perform good 
service or bad service toward another node, or if a node will 
perform ballot-stuffing or bad-mouthing attack toward 
another node. We plan to further test the resiliency of 
LogitTrust [2] against more complicated environmental and 
operational scenarios such as noisy environments, social-
based service behaviors, as well as more sophisticated attack 
behaviors such as opportunistic, collusion and insidious 
attacks [11].  
Lastly, we plan to leverage game theory and artificial 
intelligence principles [19]-[23], and stochastic Petri net 
modeling techniques [24]-[34] to capture the dynamics 
between attacker/defense behaviors [39]-[42] and reason 
how a service requester can perform counterattacks by 
adaptive trust-based service management for achieving 
multi-objective optimization of service quality.
