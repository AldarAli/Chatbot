Abstract— The problem of interpretation and simulation of the 
Aesthetic Emotions (not inspired by a pragmatic goal, but by 
impression of Artwork, natural phenomena, etc.) is considered 
under the Natural-Constructive Approach to modeling the 
cognitive process. The designed cognitive architecture is 
represented by the complex multilevel combination of various 
types of neuroprocessors, with the whole system being 
composed of two subsystems, by analogy with the two 
hemispheres of the human brain. Only one subsystem involves 
mandatory random component (noise), and the noise-
amplitude 
variation 
controls 
the 
subsystem 
activity 
representing the emotional responses. A peculiar feature of the 
architecture is the fuzzy set at the lowest (“image”) hierarchy 
level. This neuroprocessor contains images of the objects 
recorded by weak (“grey”) connections that reflect personal 
(unformulated) experience. It is shown that individual aesthetic 
preferences arise at the border of image (fuzzy set) and 
symbolic internal information. The concept of Chef-d’oeuvre is 
associated with the “paradox of recognition”, which is caused 
by 
ambiguous 
impression 
(familiar 
and 
unusual 
simultaneously) induced by the Artwork. These impressions 
could be accompanied by small oscillation (trembling) of the 
noise amplitude around a normal value that represents an 
analogue to the human “goosebumps”. 
Keywords – emotions; neuroprocessor; noise; paradox; 
ambiguity; weak connections. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This paper represents a sequel to the series of works [1]–
[4] on modeling intrinsic human cognitive features — 
intuition, emotions, individuality, etc., — in an artificial 
cognitive system. This problem is considered within the 
Natural-Constructive Approach (NCA) elaborated just for 
human-like cognition modeling on the base of Dynamical 
Theory of Information (DTI) [5][6], Neuroscience [7][8] 
and Neuropsychology [9] data, and Neurocomputing 
[10][12] (though based on the dynamical-formal-neuron 
concept, [1]). Among other popular approaches to modeling 
the cognitive systems, such as Active Agent models [13], 
Brain Re-Engineering [14][15], etc, NCA is somewhat 
similar to the Deep Learning paradigm [16][17] though it 
involves several important distinctive features.  
The 
Natural-Constructive 
Cognitive 
Architecture 
(NCCA) designed under NCA represents a combination of 
two linked subsystems, in analogy with two cerebral 
hemispheres, the right (RH) and the left (LH) ones. Each 
subsystem represents a complex multi-level hierarchical 
structure of the two-type neuroprocessors. One subsystem 
(RH) is responsible for processing of new information and 
learning, while the other one (LH) refers to the processing 
of well-known information (recognition, forecast, etc.).  
Being biologically inspired, NCCA (as well as each 
neuromorphic model) inevitably faced the problem of 
Explanatory Gap [18]. This implies that despite the huge 
amount of experimental information on brain neurons 
(“Brain” area) and on psychological reactions and rational 
thinking (“Mind” area), the main challenge is to reveal the 
mechanism of transition from neural ensemble to the 
consciousness and self-appraisal. It concerns rational, as 
well as emotional aspects of the cognitive process.  
Note that one of the basic elements of NCA is DTI, the 
theory of information origin. It seems to be the most 
relevant tool to analyze the Explanatory Gap problem, since 
information itself represents the dual-nature object: it has 
material, as well as virtual nature. According to Quastler’s 
definition [19], information is the “memorized random 
choice of one option among several similar ones”. 
Objective (material) information is the choice made by 
Nature; it does not depend on individuality and refers to the 
“Brain” approach. Subjective (conventional) information 
represents the choice made by living subjects (people, 
animals, neurons) as a result of interaction within their 
community, which refers to the “Mind” sphere. Thus, NCA 
includes inherently the possibility to bridge the Gap.  
The problem of incorporating the “emotio” and “ratio” 
in a unified cognitive (artificial) system attracts now great 
attention and evokes a lot of studies (see, e.g., [20]–[30]). 
However, the variety (great number) of different approaches 
itself indicates that the problem is far from being solved.  
Under NCA, emotions are considered as a product of 
interaction of two different-nature variables. One belongs to 
the “Brain” representation and corresponds to the 
aggregated composition of neurotransmitters. The other 
refers to the “Mind” representation and corresponds to 
variation of the random-element (noise) amplitude. The 
activity of two subsystems is controlled by the emotional 
manifestation expressed via the noise-amplitude derivative. 
In this process, negative emotions (nervousness, fear) evoke 
RH activation, while positive ones (relaxation, relief, 
satisfaction) activate LH.   
Note that the problem of integration of emotions and 
rational reasoning could be formulated and even solved, as 
far as so-called “pragmatic” emotions (those that are 
associated with certain goal) are concerned. In this case, 
quite obvious reasons should play the main role: achieving

the goal results in positive emotions, and vice versa [2]. But 
what are the reasons for so-called Aesthetic Emotions (AE), 
i.e., those that are evoked by Nature phenomena (sunrise, 
rainbow, fire, water cascade, etc.), Artwork, Music, etc.? In 
this case, the very concept of “positive\negative” does not 
work, and one could soon speak about formed preferences. 
These emotions are strictly individual, with the reasons for 
personal sympathy and antipathy being often unclear for the 
person himself/herself.  
Seemingly, there are no rational motives for personal 
sympathies and preferences, and that is why formalization 
and simulation of AE (i.e., interpreting in terms of neurons 
and their interactions) represents the most difficult problem. 
Moreover, this area is traditionally attributed not to natural 
sciences, but to the Humanities and Art study. Nevertheless, 
this work represents an attempt to reveal possible 
mechanisms that could cause AE.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section II is focused 
on the formulation of the AE problem. In Section III, the 
main peculiar features of NCCA are discussed. In Section 
IV, the hypothesis on the mechanism of AE is presented. 
Summary and discussion of further working perspectives are 
presented in Section V.  
II. 
1BFORMALIZATION OF AE PROBLEM   
The problem of revealing the AE nature and 
mechanisms should be solved again from the “Brain” and 
“Mind” positions together. This implies that one has to take 
into account neurophysiology, as well as psychology and 
personal experience motives.   
A. 
4BGeneral considerations   
Apparently, it is the cultural context that does play a 
very important role here. Indeed, something quite unknown, 
like, e.g., Japanese music for European people, could hardly 
evoke sincere emotions (may be academic interest only).   
The other first-glance reasons for AE (see, e.g., [31]) 
could be connected with:    
 
childish vague impressions;  
 
personal fuzzy associations; 
 
the influence of cultural mini-media (family, 
messmates, etc.). 
Actually, 
all 
these 
factors 
produce 
subjective 
associations, and this is the very mechanism of the Art 
perception. Indeed, the lack of clear goal that could provide 
“rational” emotions (i.e., those that could be explained by 
evident reasons) should be compensated by certain 
excitation caused by personal indirect (i.e., fuzzy, vague) 
associations. Surely, they are strictly individual, and this 
provides the explanation of personal impression.  
Note that the Art perception, being quite subjective, 
could be measured objectively: really deep impression 
produces a “goosebumps” (horripilation), and this feeling is 
quite sincere and could not be shammed. Of course, one 
could express admiration remaining quite indifferent, but 
the “goosebumps” could not be felt if there are none. 
But then, the question arises: what is the “masterpiece”, 
or Chef-D’oeuvre (ChD)? Why a certain piece of Art is 
perceived as ingenious by almost the whole community? 
Surely, there is a great influence of the mass media 
(fashion). Generally speaking, there is a great temptation to 
define ChD as a “product of convention in the society 
expressed in monetary ($) equivalent”. This factor actually 
works, but it cannot explain the phenomenon. There should 
be something inherent to the ChD itself, that does 
distinguish the ingenious creation from a solid professional 
work. In other words, what factors could provide the 
difference between Mozart and Salieri? And is it possible to 
explain personal Art preferences and the phenomenon of 
ChD from the positions of neuromorphic cognitive 
modeling? This problem is the subject of the present paper.   
B. 
4BPhysiology & psychology  
Any piece of Art is perceived as sensor information, 
which is obtained by sensory organs. For example, any 
Painting represents (roughly speaking) a color pattern. It is 
well known from physiology that human beings differently 
perceive the excitations in different parts of the color 
spectrum. The visual perception is most sensitive in the 
green part of spectrum where the greatest number of various 
shades could be distinguished [32]. Vice versa, the red part 
of the spectrum awakes nervousness and involuntary fear 
(may be associated with the dangerous fire).  
As far as the music is considered, its physical effect on 
the human organism is obvious. Indeed, the music,   from 
ancient times up to nowadays,  produces a rhythmic 
impact that does interfere with proper rhythms of the human  
brain (see, e.g., [24][33]). It is well known that only a part 
of the acoustic spectrum is pleasant for the human ear and 
could be perceived as music [33][34]. Some other 
frequencies (including the ultrasonic and infrasonic regions) 
do produce a strong but destructive effect on human 
psychical state, with the most “soft” manifestation being the 
uncontrolled nervousness and fear [24].  
Perhaps, these peculiarities of human perception 
originated from the process of evolutionary adaptation to the 
Environment: certain really dangerous phenomena (e.g., 
earthquake) are accompanied by rare and unusual visual and 
acoustic effects, and this circumstance is sewn in the genetic 
memory of human beings. However, these reasons do not 
explain individual preferences concerning normal (pleasant) 
spectrum region.  
Finally, what about the Literature? It does produce a 
significant effect on many people, but is not directly related 
with “raw” sensory perception. Thus, only the “Brain” 
representation cannot explain the AE enigma.  
C. 
4Art Study  
The Art study seems to be more relevant to the problem 
under consideration. First of all, it does take into account the 
role of cultural context and the mentality of a given society. 
This partly explains why the recognition of some Artwork’s 
ingenuity often does not come immediately but requires 
certain time: the society has to be ready to admit the pattern. 
In economy, the term “competence” is used to describe the 
social readiness to certain innovations. But the very 
mechanism of the competence occurrence is not clear and 
even considered.

However, the Art study is also divided into separated 
branches where specific regularities (common features) had 
been revealed.  
1) 
Painting, Sculpture and Architecture: From the 
Leonardo times, they were studied even mathematically (the 
concepts of “Golden Section”, “3D-perspective”, etc.). 
However, such painting schools as primitivism (Pirosmani, 
Henry Russo) and surrealism (Salvatore Dali) do neglect the 
perspective, but some their patterns are nonetheless 
admitted as ChD.    
2) Music: European and Eastern (Japanese and China) 
music representations (harmony) do differ essentially, with 
only a small number of people paying tribute to both 
musical patterns. European Music School is based on the 
concepts of consonance and dissonance, which correspond 
to different and definite ratio of the note frequencies within 
one chord. It appears that the consonance is pleasant for 
perception, and vice versa. However, great (ingenious) 
musical compositions from Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, etc. 
do involve as consonances, as well as a quote of 
dissonances. Moreover, the patterns of major and minor 
music (well defined by the frequency ratios) produce 
different and again individual effect. Several studies (see 
[23][24]) have shown that the major music, in spite of its 
bravura character, often is not admitted, while the minor 
music, despite its somewhat tragic shadow (like the 
“Funeral March” of Chopin, or “Lacrimosa” of Mozart, or 
“Casta Diva” of Bellini), produces strong and rather light 
emotions.  
3)  Literature: This is the most mysterious Art, since it 
does not appeal directly to any organs of sense, but does 
produce strong impression to the majority of people. This 
process requires active cooperation of the author and the 
reader, since the effect could be produced only in the case if 
the reader would reproduce the situation described in the 
literature using the elements of his own personal experience. 
Hence, the key words here are imagination and empathy. 
However, these processes should be initiated by verbal 
information. But what is the mechanism of such effect?  
Under NCA, all these problems could be formulated and 
even solved in terms of neurons and their connections.    
III. 
1B1BNATURAL-CONSTRUCTIVE COGNITIVE 
ARCHITECTURE (NCCA)   
Let us recall briefly the main features of the architecture 
NCCA developed in our previous works [1][2].   
A. 
4BSchematic representation of NCCA 
The schematic representation of NCCA is shown in 
Figure 1. The whole system represents complex multilevel 
block-hierarchical combination of the Hopfield [10] and 
Grossberg [11] type neuroprocessors. According to DTI 
principles [6], as well as neuropsychology data [9], the 
system is combined of two coupled subsystems, the right 
Hemi-system (RH) and the left Hemi-system (LH) by 
analogy to the cerebral hemispheres of human brain. One of 
them (RH) is responsible for learning the new information, 
the other (LH) does process the well-known information.  
 
Figure 1. Schematic representation of NCCA.  
This functional specialization is secured by three factors: 
 
the random component (noise) present in RH only;  
 
different training rules in the two subsystems: 
Hebbian principle [8] of frequently-used connection 
amplification in RH (providing the choice), and 
Hopfield’s principle [10] of selecting  relevant 
connections (“redundant cut-off”) in LH;  
 
the “connection-blackening” principle of self-
organization: well-trained images in RH are 
replicated in LH (see below).   
According to these factors, the whole system does 
evolve by self-development (in Figure 1  from the left to 
the right). The ground (zero) level is represented by two H-
type processors receiving the external information directly 
from the organs of sense. These “raw” images of real 
objects presented to the system are recorded in the form of 
certain chain of neurons (pure distributed memory).  
All other levels  = 1,…N are presented by G-type 
processors carrying the symbolic information. It is necessary 
to stress that each generated symbol carries out all the 
information about its image in a compressed form [12]. 
Each symbol G is linked by semantic connections (-1) 
with its “parent” image at the previous level and (+1) with 
its “child” symbol at the next level +1. Besides, it is linked 
with its neighbors by cooperative connections (which create 
that “current” image at the  level).  
Note that increasing level’s number corresponds to 
increasing degree of “abstraction”, that means the weaker 
relation with the neurons-progenitors (those directly 
connected with the organs of sense). The high-level symbols 
correspond to abstract concepts, which are not based on any 
raw image of real object,  such as consciousness, 
conscience, love, etc. It should be stressed that internal 
abstract symbol information can be verbalized, i.e., 
associated with the words by means of common language, 
and this stage represents the highest level of the system’s 
26

evolution [33]. These very levels correspond to developed 
human consciousness that refers to the “Mind” sphere.  
However, these high-level symbols could be excited 
from outside by words and then, decomposed to lower-level 
image-of-symbols down to the lowest image level. This 
process represents the mechanism of imagination.

The mathematical grounds for the architecture presented 
in Figure 1 were discussed in details in the works [1][2][4].

Here, variables H and G refer to purely “cognitive” 
components, which are associated with neocortex structures. 
The functionals H, and G describe internal dynamics of 
corresponding neurons; the functionals YR{Gk
R} and 
YL{Gk
L} describe interaction of symbols at various levels.  
The bottom block of equations (5)–(7) refers to 
representation of emotions. The variable (t) represents  
purely “emotional” component produced by sub-cortical 
(“Brain”) structures; it represents the effective composition 
of neurotransmitters (the difference between stimulants and 
inhibitors). The variable Z(t) represents the amplitude of 
random (stochastic) component presented in RH only. The 
functional X{,Gk
R} refers to the process of new symbol 
formation; the discrepancy D(t) describes the difference in 
RH and LH records of the same real object.  
The variable (t) refers to the cross-subsystem 
connections, which provide the dialog between two 
subsystems. Here,  = +0 corresponds to RHLH 
transfer, while  = 0 corresponds to LHRH. Note that 
this is the only variable present in each of the seven 
equations, thus sewing all the components together.   
This system of equations is complete (in math sense), 
since all the variables are determined via their mutual 
interactions. The first two equations refer to the lowest 
(zero) level of hierarchy, while the next (G variables) 
describe =1,…N  symbolic levels. Note that the dotted line 
between two first equations and the other equations 
indicates the analogy with the dotted line in Figure 1. This 
line symbolizes the virtual border between the “Brain” and 
the “Mind”. Indeed, the H-plates (zero-level of the 
hierarchy) containing only the “raw images”, serve to 
represent the sensory information received from the organs 
of sense. This information is (roughly speaking) objective, 
and this level belongs to the “Brain”.  
The first level (=1) corresponds to the symbols of  
typical images. It already belongs to the “Mind”, since any 
symbol represents not objective, but conventional, i.e., 
subjective and individual (for a given system) information. 
The same is true for all other hierarchy levels, up to the 
highest level associated with the abstract information. 
Hence, any symbolic information refers to the “Mind”.  
Thus, we can infer that the phenomena appearing at the 
transition from the “Brain” to the “Mind” occur at the 
virtual border between zero and first levels.  
C.  Formation of Two Basic Levels of NCCA 
Let us consider in more details the small fragment of the 
architecture 
NCCA 
— 
the 
lower 
(basic) 
levels 
corresponding to  = 0, 1 (see Figure 2). The H-type plates 
(=0) are responsible for recording the raw sensory 
information in the form of distributed memory. This implies 
that each external real object presented to the system excites

a chain of neurons, which is called the “image”. The choice 
of those neurons (i.e., generation of information) proceeds 
in RH with required participation of the noise. Then, the 
connections in the chain are to be trained according to 
Hebb’s principle of amplifying the frequently-used 
connection (see Figure 3a).  
 
 
Figure 3. Dynamics of neuron’s connection (t) training for (a) 
Hebb’s rule and (b) Hopfield’s rule. 
The plate H0 contains maximum information on each 
object whenever presented to the system, i.e., all generated 
connections, as weak (“grey”), as well as strong (“black”) 
ones. Let us clarify this point.  
Note that each presentation of the same object results in 
activation of slightly different set of neurons. Let us 
introduce the notions: 
 
“Core” neurons  the neurons that are excited at 
each presentation of the given object. These neurons 
form strong (“black”) connections between them, 
thus providing the “typical image” of the object, 
representing its typical attributes.   
 
“Halo” neurons  a part (and by far not a small 
one) of neurons that are excited relatively rarely, at 
some atypical presenting and/or reflect atypical 
(inessential) attributes of the given object. The 
connections between them and core neurons are 
weaker (“grey”), so that they surround the core 
neurons forming a grey “halo” blurring the typical 
image (that is why H0 was called the fuzzy set).   
The “connection-blackening” principle implies that 
when the main bulk of connections between the core 
neurons become strong enough, i.e., achieve the level of so 
called “black” connections 0, the image is treated as 
learned (well-known) or “typical” one. Such images are 
transferred (by the direct one-to-one cross-subsystem  
connections) to the plate Htyp in LH for memorization and 
storage. Then, all connections in LH are trained according to 
the Hopfield’s rule that corresponds to selection of relevant 
connections at the “black” level of 0, with diminishing 
other (redundant) connections (see Figure 3b).  
The next step of the system’s self-organized evolution 
consists in conversion of the image into symbol. It was 
shown in [1][4] that in NCCA, this procedure corresponds 
to generation of the conventional (subjective) information. 
After the typical image (the chain of core neurons) is 
transferred to the plate G1 in RH, the free choice of a single 
neuron-symbol occurs as a result of the competitive 
interaction (see Figure 2). Then again, according to the 
connection-blackening 
principle, 
after 
the 
semantic 
connections R (one-to-many) between the chosen symbol 
and its image became strong (“black”) enough, the symbol 
is replicated in LH. Here, it forms its semantic connections 
L with the typical image according to Hopfield’s training 
principle of selecting relevant connections.   
Let us stress that only the core neurons are involved into 
the typical image of the given object. Under NCA, these 
core neurons are modified to be excited directly by 
corresponding symbol. Moreover, at relatively high 
(verbalized) levels of hierarchy, the typical images could be 
excited by means of corresponding words.  
The halo neurons, in spite of their participation in the 
training process, are not connected with any symbol (and 
thus, with any word), hence they could not be controlled by 
the “Mind”. The information on the halo neurons together 
with their gray connections is stored in the fuzzy set H0 only 
and could be activated just occasionally (by chance); this 
very process represents the “insight”.   
Finally, it is very important to stress that in the process 
of transition from H0 to Htyp, a part of associative 
connections between the raw images also could be lost. In 
Figure 2, bottom part (RH), all the presented images are 
connected associatively. In the upper part (LH), one image 
appears to be quite separated from two others (connected 
objectively), since its connections with them were mediated 
only by the halo-neurons.  
Thus, the fuzzy set plays a very important and enigmatic 
role in the cognitive process. Actually, it could be treated as 
the sub-consciousness filled with personal subjective 
associations and motives. Returning to possible reasons of 
AE listed above  namely, childish vague impressions, 
personal fuzzy (indirect) associations, etc.,  we can infer 
that the source of AE is hidden just in the fuzzy set H0.    
Note that hidden (latent) information appears also at the 
higher levels of hierarchy. Generalized images, i.e., images 
created by a set of symbols, also involve their core neuron-
symbols, as well as halo-symbols that are presented in RH 
only and not transferred to the corresponding level in LH. 
Hence, this part of latent information (auxiliary and 
individual for a given system) representing its casual 
(episodic) experience could be associated with the intuition. 
These halo-symbols refer to not so deeply hidden 
information and could be activated by certain (again 
occasional) words. These triggering words may have no 
relation to the current problems, but could switch on the 
chain of indirect (personal) association and thus, lead to 
unexpected (intuitive) solution also looking like insight.  
Thus, we infer that the motives for AE are connected 
with the halo-neurons (including halo-symbols).    
IV. APPROACHES TO AE NATURE AND PHENOMENON OF 
CHEF-D’OEUVRE  
Any cognitive process is based on the recognition of an 
object\phenomenon\situation 
and 
its 
trend, 
i.e., 
the 
anticipation (forecast). And the forecast is based on the first 
impressions in the process of recognition. In the presence of 
a rational goal, this process always is accompanied by 
pronounced emotions. Under NCA, emotional manifestation 
is directly connected with the noise-amplitude derivative

dZ/dt defined by (6), which controls the subsystem activity 
(). According to (6)(7), negative emotions (nervousness, 
fear) correspond to incorrect recognition (dZ/dt>0) and 
activation of RH (<0), consequently. Vice versa, correct 
recognition and prognosis results in decreasing noise 
amplitude (dZ/dt<0) with switching on LH (>0), which is 
accompanied by relaxation, satisfaction, etc. Let us consider 
certain details of these processes.  
A. Recognition & Prognosis 
The procedures of recognition and prognosis were 
considered in details in our works [3][4]. It was shown that 
recognition goal can be achieved by means of the low levels 
=0 (“images”) and =1 (typical-image symbols). The 
examinee object is recorded in H0 and compared with 
known (learned) typical images in Htyp. Further procedure is 
controlled by the value of discrepancy D0(t) between the 
RH and LH zero-level records, which can be  defined as:   
0
0 )
(

 

(8) 
where summation proceeds over excited neurons.  
 There are several typical regimes.  
 The examinee object is well-known to the system, i.e., its 
image completely coincides with one of typical images, 
so that D(0)=0. Then, it is associated with corresponding 
symbol in LH, and RH does not participate further in the 
process. Emotional manifestations are absent (dZ/dt=0).   
 The examinee object is similar to one of the known 
typical images (fits its “attracting area”), D(0)0<Dcr. 
Then, it is treated as an already known object: it has its 
typical image together with the corresponding symbol 
GL,1. Here, however, the recognition accuracy requires 
verification. For this purpose, the symbol should be 
transferred to RH for decomposition, and the result is 
compared 
with 
the 
examinee 
image. 
Here, 
the 
discrepancy provokes repeating, and the procedure should 
pass over several iterations. This corresponds to dumping 
oscillation of the noise amplitude dZ/dt (see Figure 4a) 
representing the emotional fluctuations.  
 The examinee object is unknown to the system (D>Dcr). 
This provokes the recognition failure, that is accompanied 
(depending on the final goal) by either zero, or negative 
emotion manifestations. Then, the full procedure of new 
image formation and recording to Htyp  is to be performed.  
 
 
Figure 4. Typical patterns of the noise amplitude Z(t) behavior in the cases 
of (a) recognition procedure; (b) incorrect prognosis with sense of humor 
manifestation, and (c) Aesthetic Emotions (“goosebumps”). 
The prognosis represents the recognition of time-
dependent process and proceeds in a similar way. Special 
case of incorrect prognosis, which activates the sense of 
humor has been discussed in [3][4]. It appears when 
examinee process seems familiar up to some moment t*, but 
the next bulk of information appears to be once unexpected, 
but still well-known. This switches the recognition process 
to the other, also familiar pattern. This corresponds to the 
specific reaction of the system,  namely, sharp up-down 
jump (“spike”) in the noise amplitude, which could be 
associated with human laughter (see Figure 4b).  
B. Interpretation of AE: “Recognition Paradox”  
Perception of any Artwork represents a particular case of 
recognition-and-anticipation procedure (see, e.g., [24]). 
Contrary to everyday life, when recognition is a part of 
behavioral program and connected with obvious and rational 
goal, the Artwork does not require any actions, so that the 
goal of such anticipation is not pragmatic, but rather latent.  
It could be connected with certain dissatisfaction, i.e., 
ambiguous impression produced by the piece of Art, which 
does not allow to put it in line with any known symbol (and 
consequently, with a certain word). Differently speaking, 
AE arise when the impression cannot be formulated and 
explained.  
According with the above consideration, AE appear if 
the examinee object\phenomenon does excite the halo 
neurons in RH. Since they are not connected with any 
specific symbol and thus, such impressions remain 
unconscious, this gives rise to a “vague effect” that could 
not be formalized or verbalized; these very impressions 
produce tingling sensations called the “goosebumps” (or 
“horripilation”). This also implies that the discrepancy D(t) 
defined by (8) could never come to zero since information 
on halo neurons is absent in LH, but its value is small. 
Hence, the “goosebumps” correspond to small vibration 
(trembling) of Z(t) around the normal value (Figure 4c).      
According to this hypothesis, strong AE, which can be 
treated as personal impression produced by the masterpiece 
(ChD), could be caused by the “recognition paradox”. This 
phenomenon can take place in at least two cases.  
1) Recognition paradox #1: It appears if the Art 
object is very similar to something well known, despite 
some minor and even unconscious (by the first glance) 
difference (light inaccuracy), which involves the halo-
neurons only. Then, D(0)=D(t)0, but this discrepancy 
could not be comprehended and explained by words. The 
most pronounced example of such painting ChD is the 
“Black Square” of Malevich, which appears to be neither 
square, nor monotone black. This pattern contains actually 
small (and even invisible) deviations in lines and color, and 
these differences could be measured objectively. Hence, the 
eyes (i.e., the “Brain”, not the “Mind”) do actually notice 
this inaccuracy, and this provides some ambiguous 
impression of dissatisfaction producing AE. Speaking 
picturesquely, this feeling may be expressed by the formula 
“to see invisible”.

COGNITIVE 2017 : The Ninth International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications

Thus, in this case, the paradox consists in the fact that 
small and incomprehensible deviations of ChD from the 
ordinary pattern emphasize its individuality.  
2) Recognition paradox #2: ChD looks like several 
familiar patterns simultaneously, so it could not be 
recognized as any of them. It could be linked with all of 
them by associative “grey” connections in RH (via the 
“halo”-neurons), while in LH, all these patterns with 
corresponding symbols are separated. Such type of ChD 
activates fuzzy subjective associations, which were stored in 
RH but lost in LH. In other words, the “Brain” does know it, 
but the “Mind” cannot formulate and comprehend.  
Perception of such ChD is to a large extent similar to 
manifestation of the sense of humor, but in this case, the 
incorrect (ambiguous) prognosis cannot be turned to a new 
familiar symbol and the corresponding word, i.e., again 
cannot be formulated and explained.   
Striking examples of such type ChD are the great 
musical compositions of Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, 
Wagner, etc., which have something insensibly in common 
with each other (classical), as well as with the older 
traditional (often folk) music (see, e.g., [33]). 
Speaking picturesquely, this impression could be 
formulated as “to unite unconnectable”.   
3) General formula of ChD: In both these cases of 
recognition paradox, LH could not perform alone the 
recognition task, so that RH should be activated. This is the 
mechanism of AE appearance. Both these pathways lead to 
the feeling of ChD and realize the formula: “to see invisible, 
to unite unconnectable”. Accounting for participation of the 
halo-neurons, we may rephrase this formula as “the “Brain” 
does already know, while the “Mind” still cannot realize”. 
Let us point out to the interesting consequence of the 
“halo-neuron hypothesis”. It implies that halo-neurons do 
accompany the corresponding core neurons. It means that  
the system actually has recorded and memorized similar 
(but not identical) patterns. In other words, the system has 
its own experience with the patterns of a given type and 
hence, has sufficiently large repertoire (expertise) in such 
area. Nevertheless, relatively inexperienced (“green”) 
system could perceive ChD, but only in those parts, which 
are familiar to the system itself. This effect corresponds to 
the formula “each person has its own vision of ChD”.  
Note that the presented hypothesis provides a key to the 
explanation of another enigma: why the pleasure of favorite 
Art patterns does not lose its luster after multiple acts of 
perception? In contrast to a joke, which provides the 
impression due to an element of unexpectedness and its 
subsequent resolution, the recognition paradox has no 
resolution: an ambiguous feeling arises whenever this 
Artwork is presented.   
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK   
Thus, it is shown that NCCA contains inherent 
possibility to reveal the mechanism of Aesthetic Emotions 
(AE) appearance. The whole architecture represents a 
combination of two multilevel subsystems, in analogy with 
two hemispheres of human brain. One of them (RH) 
processes any new, unexpected or ambiguous information. 
The other one is dealing with familiar (well known), i.e., 
clearly formulated information. The role of each subsystem 
in solving the current problem should be controlled by 
emotions (in particular, AE).  
It is shown that the AE reasons are stored at the ground 
(“image”) level of the architecture in the RH subsystem, 
which is called the fuzzy set H0. This neuroprocessor 
contains the whole information whenever recorded. In 
particular, it involves insignificant (at the first glance) 
information stored in weak (“grey”) connections between 
so-called “halo” neurons, which correspond to atypical 
(inessential) attributes of real objects. This information is 
hidden in RH only and is transferred neither to LH nor to 
the high (symbolic) hierarchy levels of RH, hence could be 
neither formulated nor comprehended.  
According to our main hypothesis, the mechanism of AE 
consists in excitation of personal subjective (may be vague) 
associations provided by weak connections via halo 
neurons. These associations could not be formulated and 
verbalized, thus, comprehended. Within NCCA, these 
excitations correspond to small oscillation (“trembling”) of 
the noise amplitude Z(t) that could be treated as analogy to 
human feeling of “goosebumps”.   
This hypothesis provides the possibility to explain 
several enigmas connected with AE: 
 This explains the individuality of AE;  
 This involves all the intuitively obvious reasons for AE 
listed above  childish vague impressions, fuzzy 
associations, indirect influence of micro-society, etc.  
 Deep AE, i.e., personal feeling of ChD could be caused 
by the recognition paradox, which arises when the 
Artwork seems familiar and unusual simultaneously, with 
this impression being not formulated and explained.  
 In aphoristic form, the feeling of ChD can be presented as 
“to see invisible, to unite unconnectable”.  
 Perception of any Artwork requires proper personal 
repertoire (competence, erudition, etc.) stored as in 
episodic (RH), as well as in semantic (LH) memory. 
Otherwise, the system remains quite indifferent to any 
piece of Art including ChD. This explains the “enigma of 
blind and deaf”.   
 The mechanisms providing sense of humor and AE 
actually have something in common. However, the sense 
of humor is caused by unexpectedness (surprise), which 
could be still recognized immediately. But AE arise in the 
case of ambiguous (paradoxical) impression that remains 
unformulated (hence, unrecognized) even in the long run. 
That is why a joke, repeated twice, does not cause a 
specific reaction (laughter), while favorite Artwork (ChD) 
always causes another specific reaction (“goosebumps”). 
Returning to the Explanatory Gap challenge, we can 
infer that the study of AE, being seemingly not a scientific 
problem (rather Humanities and Art study), actually 
provides the possibility to “open a gate” to the gap between 
“Brain” and “Mind”. It is shown that AE emerge (as 
indicated in Figure 1) at that virtual border. Then, general 
formula “to see invisible, to unite unconnectable” could be 
expressed in more constructive (still aphoristic) form:

“Brain does already know, while Mind cannot still realize”. 
And this very ambiguity provides the feeling of ChD.  
Let us emphasize that all these reasons are inherently 
connected with NCA grounds. This is DTI that point out the 
role of conventional (subjective) information as a whole, 
and the role of a symbol as a representative of this 
information in particular. According to NCA viewpoint, the 
symbol is the very first object that, being relied on the 
“Brain” area, represents a “molecule of the Mind”. And this 
is the technique of nonlinear differential equations that 
enable us to describe the procedure of symbol formation and 
the point where weak (“grey”) connections appear to be lost.   
It should be stressed that all these arguments represent 
not an instruction for ChD production, and not the method 
to estimate the value of ChD. The study represents only an 
attempt to understand the mechanisms of perception of the 
Art as a whole and ChD in particular. Nonetheless, this 
study can be used in social surveys, highly targeted 
advertising, and other social actions.   
However, we have not discussed here the phenomenon 
of “socially accepted ChD”  why the significant part of 
society (not only certain persons) does feel a “goosebumps” 
caused by certain (ingenious) piece of Art? The mechanism 
could be similar, but this problem requires further work.
