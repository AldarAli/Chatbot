Abstract— In this paper, we illustrate a practical way to 
determine the systematic error of a micro-electro-mechanical 
systems inertia measurement unit sensor-based altitude and 
height reference system mounted on a drill-head for 
underground navigation. This enables for calibration purposes 
and for alignment of the system in a designated global 
reference frame. Furthermore, an extension of this is to enable 
for onboard real-time calibration in the field with direct access 
to required parameters over a designed underground wireless 
ad hoc sensor network telemetry system. This contribution is in 
line with the embedded systems component of the ubiquitous 
devices and operative systems track of the conference.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recent developments in the field of wellbore drilling has 
seen the gradual migration towards the concept of 
digitalization of key aspects of the entire drilling operation 
[1]. This has therefore seen the move towards the 
optimization of drilling operations utilizing the so-called 
modern technology tools so as to gain economic advantage 
by way of improving the efficiency of the drilling process 
[1]. There is therefore a push towards sensor-controlled 
deep drilling process so as to provide suitable sensor data 
continuously 
in 
real-time. 
This 
requires 
a 
deeper 
understanding of multimodal sensors/sensor networks and 
their conditions of use. Therefore, for field test verification, 
we have realized an appropriate ad-hoc sensor network 
along the entire drill string. We also describe the necessity 
for using a suitable calibration process and give an outlook 
on how we can generate training data in the next steps to 
provide a deep neural network solution to process the sensor 
data. 
In our Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)-
based Altitude and Height Reference System (AHRS) for 
bottom hole trajectory tracking, the main concept is to 
minimize the errors associated with the IMU sensors before 
the application of a suitable mathematical model in order to 
obtain an optimal estimation of the orientation and therefore 
improve the trajectory of the well path. To facilitate this 
process 
is 
our 
in-house 
designed 
and 
developed 
underground wireless ad hoc sensor network borehole 
telemetry system which allows for real-time data exchange 
during a drilling operation irrespective of the drill depth. An 
extension of this will be to enable the calibration process to 
be done directly on the field while only communicating the 
required parameters for the process.  
In general, the contribution of this paper is to provide a 
methodology for MEMS sensor positioning and calibration 
which can be applied (on-field) by making use of a robotic 
arm-mounted 
miniature 
drill-head 
where 
different 
orientations can be simulated thus representing a multi-
position platform for effective sensor calibration. Our 
robotic-arm-mounted IMU-based AHRS drill-head is 
programmed at preset orientations whose positions are 
accurately known from the settings on the robotic arm and 
used in the estimation of the deterministic errors. The 
known orientation angles are used with the known local 
gravity vector to establish the resolved known MEMS 
accelerometer output data from each of the 3 orthogonal 
axes which is then used in the determination of the 
calibration parameters. 
Sensor system testing and calibration for Inertial 
Measurement Unit (IMU)-based navigation systems is of 
critical importance and has significant consequences in 
terms of cost and performance of the host vehicle. Basically, 
the testing and calibration techniques employed needs to 
reflect the type of application and importantly, the 
environment in which the sensor and systems are to operate 
[2]-[6]. Testing is done to enable the output signals to be 
calibrated and to understand the behavior of the device unit 
in various situations and environment. In other terms, 
sensors are calibrated by comparing the analogue or digital 
signals produced by the sensor with the known input 
motion. So, for instance, from the rate transfer tests, the 
output signals from a gyroscope can be compared with the 
accurately known rotation rate and the scale factor deduced. 
Also, using gravity vector as an accurate standard, the scale-
factor of an accelerometer can be defined. Application of 
error compensation is then utilized to correct the effects of a 
predictable systematic error. A basic requirement is that an 
error process can be represented by an equation and 
modelled mathematically, and that a signal corresponding to 
the disturbing effect such as temperature or acceleration, is 
available and can be measured to the required accuracy [4]. 
The accuracy that may be achieved from the application of 
compensation techniques is dependent on precisely how the

coefficients in the “error” equations represents the actual 
sensor errors. The representation can often vary as a 
function of time, the environment in which the sensor is 
used and how often it is used. For more demanding 
applications, it may be necessary to re-calibrate the sensor 
regularly, to ensure that the compensation routines are as 
effective as required by the particular application. Usually, 
the sensor system is mounted on a multi-axis table or on a 
rig. The unit may be rotated through a series of accurately 
known angles and positioned in different orientations with 
respect to the local gravity vector. The dominant sensor 
errors may then be determined from static measurements of 
acceleration and turn rate taken in each orientation of the 
unit. 
In Section II of our paper, we provide an overview of the 
related works on the approach utilized for IMU sensor 
calibration. Section III then outlines the general equation 
model representation for the combined form of the 
deterministic and stochastic model of the IMU sensor output 
data. In Section IV, we discuss the calibration process and 
the methodology for determination of the calibration 
parameters for finding the deterministic errors associated 
with two mounted inexpensive MEMS IMU sensors used 
for the wellbore trajectory tracking process. We then discuss 
an experimental setup for verification of our calibration 
process. In Section V, we give the conclusion and an 
overview of ongoing research in view of the adaptation of 
deep-learning techniques to improve the calibration process.

RELATED WORKS 
Introduction to topics surrounding AHRS fail to 
sufficiently describe the error characteristics of the inertial 
systems. Inertial system design and performance prediction 
depends on accurate knowledge of sensor level behavior and 
therefore it is important to be able to understand and analyze 
the intrinsic noise characteristics of the IMU sensors to 
develop the necessary stochastic model to be used in the 
AHRS model. Generally, the IMU sensor errors are 
composed of the deterministic and stochastic parts. The 
main deterministic errors are the bias and misalignment 
errors. The misalignment errors are composed of the scale 
factor and the non-orthogonal errors of the sensor [3]-[5]. 
Laboratory calibration procedures are normally employed in 
the elimination of these deterministic errors. El-Diasty et al. 
[3] discussed two calibration methodologies used to find the 
calibration parameters in order to remove the deterministic 
errors (systematic errors); inertial biases (bias offset), scale 
factor and non-orthogonality errors. This involves the six-
position static test (up and down position for the inertial 
sensor axes) [3]-[5]. Basically, the non-orthogonality error 
is as a result of the imperfect mounting of the IMU sensors 
along the orthogonal axis at the time of manufacturing. 
However, in most cases, upon the final integration of the 
IMU sensor in the final application hardware, there is also 
the need for a re-calibration of the IMU sensor output as a 
result of imperfection in the alignment of the IMU sensor 
with respect to the final application hardware, which in this 
case is the drill-head. In the field, there is the difficulty or 
lack of adequate means to properly re-calibrate the inertial 
sensors after physically mounting of the hardware on the 
respective device. This approach therefore provides a means 
to utilize the drill tube holder which has the ability to be 
oriented at different angular positions like that of a robotic 
arm to be utilized for the purposes of calibration. 
El-Diasty et al. [3] work is based on the premise that the 
IMU sensor is in alignment with local gravity vector and 
therefore gives a general description of how the calibration 
parameters are determined using the two-position static tests 
in the zenith direction for the case of the MEMS 
accelerometer. In their approach, the calibration was done 
by inducing an excitation signal as input to MEMS 
accelerometer which is done with local gravity as the 
excitation/reference signal [3].  In the case of the MEMS 
gyroscope, the test is done by the use of a two-position 
dynamic test in any direction [4]. This involves a gyro 
excitation signal input in the form of a known rotation rate 
using a calibration turn-table. They discuss further the so-
called six position direct method and the six-position 
weighted least square method approach to determine the 
inertial bias, scale factor and non-orthogonal deterministic 
errors. However, for certain applications, this zenith 
position is determined by the geometry (physical structure) 
of the application hardware of interest which for our case 
would be the bottom hole assembly or the drill-head. The 
sensor reference frame is defined by the body to which the 
IMU MEMS sensor is strapped unto. This therefore 
necessitates the need to determine the alignment of the IMU 
MEMS sensor relative to the body frame of bottom hole 
assembly or drill-head on which it is mounted. So basically, 
the final deployment would require for a re-alignment of the 
IMU MEMS sensors with respect to the drill-head 
orientation.

CALIBRATION IN THE GLOBAL REFERENCE FRAME FOR 
DETERMINISTIC ERRORS 
The calibration of our IMU-based AHRS miniature drill-    
head involved finding the parameters/coefficients that map 
the measured MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope triad 
outputs from each sensor’s reference frame unto our 
designated navigation reference frame shown as the global 
reference frame in Figure 1.

In our setup, for the IMU sensors, we used the Vectornav-
100T and the MPU-9255 MEMS sensors which are of 
industrial and consumer grade respectively. The IMU

which a linear regression analysis by which an attempt to 
find the best, in the least-square sense, straight line to fit a 
given set of data can be made.  
 
A. Experimental setup and description  
     Our experimental setup consisted of the two IMU 
sensors mentioned earlier; Vectornav-100T and the MPU-
9255, each composed of a MEMS gyroscope accelerometer 
triad with axis orthogonal and mounted on a miniature drill-
head to form our AHRS integrated system. Eight preset 
orientations at predefined and accurately measured angles 
on the Kuka Robot was programmed. At each defined 
orientation, 1000 measurements were recorded from both 
sensors at a data rate of 20Hz. This was then used in the 
formulation given in (6) to generate the unknown regression 
parameters for the misalignment and bias which minimizes 
the errors using the maximum likelihood estimation method. 
Given a set of parameter values with the matrix 
representation and observations, the estimated regression 
parameters were determined. The general equation is written 
in the form.

    Considering the calibration of our drill-head mounted 
MEMS IMU sensors after mounting both on the robotic 
arm, as mentioned earlier, the robotic arm was preset to 
assume a number of orientations to enable the sensor data in 
the respective orientations to be recorded and used for the 
calibration 
process. 
The 
calibration 
entailed 
the 
determination of the mapping misalignment matrix and bias 
vector for the transformation of the sensor output from the 
sensor reference frame to our designated global/navigation 
reference frame. In our case, the recordings were done twice 
in each preset orientation position as observed in Table 1.

Table I shows the true accelerometer output approximated 
to three decimals places for the different orientation 
positions (p) preset on the robotic arm with respect to our 
designated global/navigation reference frame. The recorded 
measurement in the respective orientation from both MEMS 
IMU accelerometer sensors is given in Table II. At each 
orientation position, up to 1000 readings were taken and 
then afterwards averaged to obtain the respective output on 
each 
axis. 
The

from 
the 
Vectornav-100T 
accelerometer is labelled as the vn_ax, vn_ay and vn_az for 
the respective x, y, and z axes while for that of the MPU-

The recorded MEMS accelerometer triads output data 
shown in Table 2 were then used as the observation

Conceptually, an unlimited or arbitrary number of different 
preset locations can be utilized for generating the true 
outputs to be used in the bias vector and misalignment 
vector determination process. However, the number of 
observations/measurements should be equal or greater than 
the number of unknown parameters to ensure a non-
underdetermined system. 
    For the determination of the calibration parameters of the 
MEMS IMU gyroscope triad, the high resolution, high 
accurate calibration turn-table was utilized. With rotation in 
the clockwise direction considered positive, two preset 
rotation speeds of equal magnitudes at 200 degrees per 
second (°/s) but in opposite directions were applied to each 
axis while the axis of interest was aligned with gravity in the 
upwards direction on the turn table as shown in Figure 4.

Again 1000 readings were taken and then afterwards 
averaged to obtain the respective output on each axis as 
shown in Table 4. The results of the readings from Table IV 
were then used as the observations representation in 
equation (6) and the maximum likelihood method again 
used for the determination of the misalignment and bias 
mapping matrix and vector respectively. Temperature 
dependency was considered such that the misalignment and 
the bias were recalculated according to the corresponding 
sensitivities per degree increase in temperature of both 
MEMS IMU accelerometer and gyroscope triads.

B. Verification of Calibration 
For the verification of our calibration process, the Kuka 
robotic arm was then programmed for motion along a 
specified trajectory. The trajectory involved the movement 
of the drill head from a station position A, through station 
position B and finally settling at position point C. In this 
setup the vertical displacement from A to B was made with 
a distance of 0.5m. The position C was then set at an 
inclination angle of about 30° from station position B and 
also with a displacement of 0.5m from B. We then 
established the ground truth of our drill-head trajectory 
based on the Kuka robots coordinate system with the points 
A, B and C as shown in Figure 2. The points of the station 
positions A, B and C were referenced to a central reference 
point on the robot. To determine the true geometric 
measurements, the numerical values of the positions given 
as vector coordinates indicated by the robotic PLC read out 
was used. Note that the measurements were given in 
millimeters. For actual verification of the trajectory of the 
miniature drill-head, a recording of the changing position 
vector coordinates was made and graphed to give a good 
representation of the ground truth from the perspective of

station positions A, B, and C on the Kuka Robot and from which the true

the robotic arm. Only the trajectory and drill-head 
orientation were of interest. In Figure 3, the mounting 
positions of the miniature drill-drill head on the robotic arm 
as well as the turn-table for the static measurements are 
shown. From the station position vector coordinates, A, B, 
C, the distance traversed from station A through station B to 
station C is determined from the readout of the robot 
coordinate system. From the Figure 2 information, we can 
easily compute the respective displacement vectors and 
consequently the distance from position A to position B. 
Figures 4-7 show the output of the two MEMS 
accelerometer and gyroscope triads; MPU-9255 and 
vectornav-100T, during translational motion in both the 
body 
frame 
of 
reference 
and 
the 
designated 
global/navigation reference frame. The two IMU sensors 
were mounted on different positions on the drill-head setup. 
Figure 4 shows the respective 3-axis accelerometer output 
which reflects difference in mounting positions. After 
application of the determined bias vector and misalignment 
matrices, the resulting converted outputs of the respective 
MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope triads in the global 
reference frame were plotted as shown in Figure 6. The 
outputs of both sensors show the expected similarity in 
values after the removal of the deterministic bias offset, 
scale factor and non-orthogonal systematic errors.

global reference 
This converted output data, after denoising, is then used as 
the input source in the AHRS model for the respective 
orientation estimation and consequently the overall the 
wellbore trajectory determination. Slight differences in 
output can be explained as the effects of temperature 
variations within the laboratory environment. The random 
errors left afterwards are the residual bias and residual 
misalignment errors which could then be stochastically 
modelled and utilized in the optimal estimator for the 
trajectory tracking process.  
Improvement of the overall accuracy of the measurement 
can also be attributed to both the number and performance 
specification of the individual sensors used within a cluster 
or single node which is calibrated.

CONCLUSION, ONGOING RESEARCH AND OUTLOOK 
The aim is to enable an adoptable concept of the algorithm 
to be directly implementable on the onboard microprocessor

with the required parameters transferred to all sensor node 
modules over the underground wireless ad hoc network to 
facilitate the calibration process in real-time. Taking into 
consideration recent trends in machine learning and neural 
networks [11], a possible extension of this calibration 
process is with the use of multiple point measurements with 
the respective output data as training data within a neural 
network. Investigation into the possibility of improving the 
estimation of well-bore trajectory tracking utilizing the 
concept of artificial neural networks for predicting the 
orientation of the drill-head or bottom hole assembly would 
be of great interest.

This notwithstanding, will not completely discard the 
current concept of using appropriate navigation models, 
such as the AHRS mathematical model in conjunction with 
an optimal estimator for continuously tracking the drill-
head/bottom hole assembly, but would rather serve to 
complement the other. The concept for a laboratory setup is 
to use the miniature drill-head-mounted on the robotic arm 
to generate training data to be used in determining the 
different orientations of the drill-head during underground 
borehole navigation. The aim is to generate a proper set of 
coordinates characterizing a set of landmarks as inputs from 
the relevant sensors and the outputs characterizing the 
correlating orientation positions or the transformed 
orientation position. Theoretically, there will be an infinity 
of positions in the input landmark set or data points which 
will capture all possible orientations of the drill head 
relative to a designated frame of reference. In practicality, a 
couple 
of 
important 
beacon 
positions 
with 
their 
corresponding output landmarks set could be carefully 
selected and used as training data. This can then be 
extrapolated to capture all possible representations of the 
orientation. Controlled temperature (and pressure condition) 
could be included in the training data set to capture the 
effect of temperature rise on the IMU sensor data output.  
The machination equation will be used in the optimal 
estimator filter in the classical sense for estimation of the 
bottom hole assembly/drill head orientation and the output 
fused or used as extra information in addition to the output 
generated by the artificial neural network. This technique 
would serve as an extension to find a more accurate estimate 
of the overall well-bore trajectory estimation. A comparison 
of the results of the optimal filter to that of the artificial 
neural network could be evaluated and further used as 
training data set to improve the neural network.
