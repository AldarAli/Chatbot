PRINCIPLES OF RADAR FAULT DIAGNOSIS BASED ON 
DUAL-MODE FUSION 
A.    Wavelet BP method 
BP (Back Propagation) [1] is a widely used feed-forward 
neural network model, which is superior to other network 
forms for the systematicness, completeness and ease 
application of its algorithm; it is particularly suitable for fast 
pattern recognition and classification applications. 
In order to improve the operating speed, the improved BP 
neural network model of Morlet wavelet function [4] is 
adopted in this paper. It has three layer structures: input layer 
X, middle H layer and output layer Y, each layer of network 
is composed by multiple neurons, as shown in Figure 1. The 
input layer of the network takes M nodes according to the 
type number of failure, output layer for fault diagnosis 
conclusion, suppose that there is N conclusion and implicit 
layer was washed with K nodes reasoning judgment. BP

In the training, the momentum is added in the weights 
and threshold correction algorithm and the former correction 
value is used to smooth learning path step, to avoid falling 
into the local minimum value and accelerate learning speed. 
In order to avoid causing the oscillation of the weights and 
threshold correction in the sample-by-sample training, we 
adopt batch training methods. The output of the network is 
not a simple weighted sum, but the network hidden layer 
wavelet node is weighted summation firstly, and then 
converted by the Sigmoid function [7], to obtain the final 
output of the network, this is conducive to the handling 
classification problems and reduce the possibility of 
divergence in the training process at the same time. 
 The direct fusion of wavelet and BP neural network, 
namely wavelet yuan [1] instead of neurons, is that the 
weights of the input layer to the hidden layer and the hidden 
layer threshold are respectively instead by the scaling of 
wavelet function and the translation parameters. On the same 
learning task, wavelet BP network has the characteristics of 
self-learning, adaptive, and fault tolerance, and it could avoid 
blindness on the BP neural network structure design, the 
structure is more simple, the speed of convergence is faster. 
B. Improved CBR method  
CBR puts forward solutions for the current fault by 
summing up the expert fault diagnosis experiences, using 
experts 
have 
successfully 
solved 
similar 
problems, 
comparing background and conditions of the old and new 
fault analysis, adjustment, modifying the existing fault 
diagnosis experience; so, it is also known as case-based 
reasoning method [2]. 
 
Figure 2.  Improved CBR process diagram 
 Case Representation: Disposed case model, G = (A, B, C, 
S, R), which is based on the case model of the feature vector, 
each case G should contain the following: (1) Case No. A; (2) 
Case information B (fault phenomenon description, fault 
source); (3) Case description C behavior characteristics 1 
(index 1, value 1), …, behavior characteristics N (index N, 
value N)]; (4) Solution S is the solution method for the 
failure; (5) Case retrieve information R (retrieval sequence 
number, frequency of use). 
  Standard case base Z stores series of case G in an 
interconnected database, Standard case base is divided into 
three layers: The first layer is the system layer, which is 
divided according to the main components in the weather

radar system, such as antenna device system layer, power 
plant system layer, operating platform system layer, display 
device system layer, etc. The second layer is the 
representative case layer, corresponding to the typical 
representative cases that are under the system layer. The 
third layer is the sub-case layer which is a collection of a 
certain class of cases, each case of the same sub-case layer 
should be as similar as possible, each case of the different 
sub-case layer should be as far as possible not similar, and 
the same type of sub-case number should be at least 3. 
 Case Retrieval: The fault system uses the “hierarchical 
retrieval, the distance matching” method, focusing on the 
fault eigenvectors of target case, it makes sure that the failure 
occurred in what parts, and then finds the corresponding 
representative case in the system layer, the last fine in the 
sub-case select the cases corresponding to the minimum 
similarity distance, finally selects the corresponding 
minimum similarity distance case in the sub-cases. In a 
predetermined threshold range, there may be more than one 
sub-case to meet the requirements, or cannot find a matching 
case, at the time it could call the expertise libraries 
knowledge, for those who probability of occurrence is high, 
or have occurred many times of failure as a fixed case for 
feedback matching, regard the final solution as a case for a 
new solution and add to the standard case base after new 
solutions normalized. If there are hardware replacement 
requirements in solution, then the hardware replace adjusting 
parameter database will update the parameter testing 
procedures and specific parameter value debugging method. 
An improved CBR process is shown in Figure 2. 
 Similar distance function matching method: Case 
matching algorithm uses the similarity distance function 
matching 
method,

where Xj is the j-dimensional vector-valued of target case, 
Zij is the j-th vector-value of i-th standard sub case, Si is the 
similarity between the target case and i- th standard sub case, 
Wij is the weight coefficient, which is usually determined by 
expert experience data. 
The definition of the similar distance function between 
the target case X and i- th standard case Zi is: 
di = 1- Si  <  (0,1)                         (7) 
where  (0, 1) is the determination threshold, when d 
is less than the threshold, we can see that the fault exists 
similarity between standard case and target case. 
C. Dual mode fusion algorithm  
Multi-modal fusion fault diagnosis is the information 
processing technology that developed in the last decade, it 
males a variety of diagnostic information intelligent process 
as a whole, results more accurate and complete judgment 
than a single diagnosis and ultimately gives higher reliable 
fault diagnosis results [6,7]. It involves a multifaceted 
theories and techniques, such as signal processing, 
estimation theory, uncertainty theory, pattern recognition, 
and optimization techniques, neural networks, artificial 
intelligence, and so on. Multi-modal fusion fault diagnosis 
usually belongs to the decision-making level fusion, which 
associates the diagnostic results of different algorithms, and 
then gets the joint inference results through the correlation 
processing, decision-making fusion decision. The common 
methods are Bayesian inference [7], Dempster-Shafer 
evidence theory [8] and fuzzy set theory [8], the expert 
system [3], etc. 
The overall diagnostic result is actually the decision that 
is made after integrate the individual diagnostic information. 
In the decision-level fusion of dual-mode radar fault 
diagnosis results, We actually obtained the number of 
diagnostic information is at least two or more than two, but it 
does not say that they have completely and accurately 
represent the overall diagnostic conclusions; so, the decision-
making level fusion is needed. In the view of Bayesian 
statistical point, their diagnostic information can be viewed 
as random variables, these random variables is not 
necessarily the true value of the overall diagnosis, but only a 
random performance of the overall truth value, but they are 
all fraught with some information of the overall true value. 
Therefore, we could make re-integration of this information, 
eventually infer the overall diagnostic information, and give 
the best fault diagnosis results. 
According to the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence 
[8,9], setting up

confidence level, 
i  is the weight. 2 factors should be 
mainly considered in setting the weight
i : (a) Performance 
weight factors: Different fault feature extraction methods 
have different characteristics, so the fault diagnosis rate and 
stability are different too. After a large number of 
experiments, statistical diagnostic results in the actual 
environment, this paper uses average correct diagnosis rate 
of failure as performance weights. (b) Correlation weight 
factors: Making use of the improved DS combination rule 
requires the independence of each other between the various 
types of fault cases. However, there is a inevitably 
correlation between the information provided by each failure 
characterization in the practical application, so we should 
give larger weights for the separate fault cases, on the 
contrary, give smaller weights.

radar intelligent fault diagnosis system based on improved 
DS is shown in Figure 3. Failure phenomena were 
respectively sent into wavelet BP neural network module and 
the improved case-based reasoning module for fault 
diagnosis of the first phase, the resulting case solution hi, hj 
and then fed into the improved the DS dual mode fusion 
module for fusion of the second order to obtain the highest 
reliable fault diagnosis conclusion and failure solutions, if 
the fault solutions exist hardware replacement requirements, 
the hardware replacement adjustment parameter database 
will give the corresponding parameter test steps after replace 
the components and specific debugging method of parameter 
values, which is a very practical expert knowledge base 
designed based on the author’s many years of work 
experience [6, 10]. 
In the maintenance of the electronic systems, judging 
which one overall device damage to replace the whole device 
is often called a device-level maintenance, judging which 
one Printed Circuit Board (PCB) damage of device and 
replace the circuit board is called plate level maintenance, 
judging which one element, chip burnt out of the circuit 
board and replace the components and chip is called the 
maintenance of chip level. Therefore, we divide fault 
diagnosis level of the weather radar system into 
corresponding three levels: device level fault diagnosis, plate 
level fault diagnosis, chip level fault diagnosis, and give the 
corresponding failure maintenance solutions of the device-
level, plate level and chip-level. The experimental data show 
that the wavelet BP method is particularly suitable in the 
chip-level fault diagnosis, improved CBR method is 
particularly suitable for device-level fault diagnosis; the plate 
level fault diagnosis method can use both.

 CASE ANALYSIS 
Based on 3830 weather radar system [6], as an example, 
the analysis of the system of drive fault phenomena, fault 
type is the key. The drive function is receiving control 
instruction sent by servo control panel and R/D conversion 
board driver interface circuit, including antenna speed 
steering instructions, positioning position command, control 
mode selection instruction, etc., receiving motor with rotary 
encoder (code disc) delivery of the antenna at present speed, 
steering, etc. state information, and eventually generating a 
driving antenna rotational drive signal from the internal 
operation treatment sent to drive antenna scanning bearing 
motor and pitching machine. The 3830 weather radar system 
drive function diagram is shown in Figure 4. The drive 
maintenance of 3830 weather radar system is defined as a 
device-level fault diagnosis, the maintenance of drive plate 
and chip, is defined as the drive plate and chip plate level 
and chip-level fault diagnosis.

the 11 main consumable components transistors and 
integrated circuits, define the type of fault as 11, wavelet BP 
output nodes as11, the input nodes as 8, the number the 
hidden layer wavelet function nodes can be adjusted 
according to the actual training effect, in this case is taken as 
16. 
BP 
wavelet 
fault 
diagnosis algorithm 
specific 
implementation steps are as follows: 
 1) Initialization of the network parameters. The random 
wavelet dilation factor, translation factor, the initial value of 
the network connection weights, Learning rate = 0.8, 
momentum factor = 0.1, learning number = 2000, counter = 
1, system error = 0.001, is shown in Figure 5. 
 2) Entering the learning samples and network training. 
The training samples are usually obtained by a number of 
experimental data, or by entering the value after the 
normalization of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) 
software simulation data [6] into the network as training 
sample, less than 1000 training, and network convergence. 
   3) Circuit Fault Diagnosis. The voltage value of the test 
fault circuit and the test data after pretreatment input to the 
wavelet BP network have been trained well for the fault 
diagnosis of the circuit. For example, let the servo drive 
MHD053A1V plate in the circuit shown in Figure 6 VDC = 
0V, namely the circuit's power supply is disconnected; the 7- 
th test point voltage value is 0V. Input all eight test point 
voltage value after normality to the wavelet BP network and 
the trained wavelet BP network can give the circuit fault 
diagnosis results for "VDC = 0V" number. Diagnostic results 
are the same with the actual situation, showing that the 
present method is effective for circuit fault diagnosis.

B. CBR application cases 
3830 weather radar drive a fault case is shown in Table 1. 
Failure case Numbers is TQ3 and the T of TQ3 represents 
system layer of antenna device, Q represents case layer drive, 
1 represents drive of the cases is 1 case, take Wij=1.  
C. The application of the dual-mode Fusion 
According to the previous dual-mode fusion algorithm 
and fault determination rules, wavelet BP usually takes 
larger value in credibility of the chip-level fault diagnosis, So 
their weights in the chip-level fault diagnosis can be set at 
95%, 75%; 
However, the improved CBR method take a larger value 
in the credibility of device-level fault diagnosis, their 
weights were set at 75%, 95%; Both methods have their own 
strengths in plate level fault diagnosis, the weights can be set 
at 50%, 50%. Then, follow the improved DS's dual mode 
fusion algorithm described in Section 2.3 to fusion, the 
1
2
,
  were respectively 0.6, and 0.1. 
D. The adjustment parameter database after components 
changing 
Because after components replacement, usually, there is a 
need for adjustment and settings of some parameters to 
ensure that the radar system works in the best state; so, the 
fault diagnosis system especially adds an adjustment 
parameter database. For example, the CINRAD / CC radar 
servo system drive replacement parameter settings shown in 
Table 2. The calibration setting after the radar servo system 
antenna replacement is shown in Table 3. 
E. Failure phenomenon: Antenna azimuth fixed 
Feature 1: Without electricity, antenna could be more 
easily rotated, no abnormal noise; Feature 2: It has overload 
alarm; Feature 3: The electromagnetic brake act correctly; 
Feature 4.1: Motor connecting wire normal; Feature 4.2: The 
resistance value of the 1, 2, 3 line and ground resistance on 
XS03 is infinite; Feature 4.3: The mutual resistance of 5, 6, 7 
line on XS03 is not basic equal. 
If there is an input failure characteristics into the dual-
mode weather radar intelligent fault diagnosis system, the 
diagnostic conclusion of these characteristics in wavelet BP 
is 0, the fault diagnostic conclusion in improved CBR is: The 
drive is damage, similar distance function d12 = 0.0012. The 
fault diagnostic conclusion in the improved DS's dual-mode 
is: the drive is damage, the credibility is 95%, exclusion 
program; solution is to replace the azimuth drive, and 
process according to the requirements of components

The fault diagnosis conclusion could be regarded as a new 
phenomenon of the failure sent to the input of the system 
and then have a chip-level diagnosis of the drive failure. 
Collect eight test points voltage of the drive firstly, and 
then set the eight voltage values  into the dual-mode 
weather radar intelligent fault diagnosis system as the new 
fault feature for secondary diagnosis. For example, the 
seven test point voltage = 0V, the voltage of the other test 
points is normal, then the diagnostic conclusion of these 
characteristics in wavelet BP is 10: the feedback signal 
connection circuit of drive power is abnormal; the fault 
diagnostic conclusion in CBR is 0; the fault diagnostic 
conclusion in the improved DS's dual-mode fusion is that 
the feedback signal connection circuit of drive power is 
abnormal, the credibility is 95%, exclusion program; 
remedy is to check the DC power supply of the feedback 
signal connection circuit or the circuit is partly open. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The dual-mode weather radar intelligent fault 
diagnosis system is a practical intelligent fault diagnosis 
system.  It is result of combined with theory and practice.  
The wavelet BP method is particularly suitable in the 
chip-level fault diagnosis, improved CBR method is 
particularly suitable for device-level fault diagnosis, and 
the plate level fault diagnosis method can use both. The 
fusion of the two kinds of fault diagnosis model increased 
the "adaptability" of radar circuit fault diagnosis system, 
which is effective for the radar fault diagnosis of device 
level, plate level, chip level, and give correspond the fault 
repair solutions at the same time, the improved d-s fusion 
algorithm of dual mode actually improved the credibility 
of the radar fault diagnosis, increased the radar equipment 
analytical, the radar fault components positioning 
accuracy can be improved. The parameter settings 
database after components replacement and the feedback 
processing functions of fault diagnosis conclusion are 
newly added in the system, these features are fully 
demonstrated the practicality and effectiveness of the 
system. 
But, this system is relatively complex, calculations 
require long times. On the basis of the guarantee the 
accuracy of fault diagnosis, still need to improve the 
efficiency; this is the future research direction in 
this paper.
