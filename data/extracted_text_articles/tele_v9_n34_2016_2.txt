Abstract— The adaptive modulation technique is a promising 
solution to resolve the problem of spectrum scarcity. A key 
issue that defines the performance of adaptive modulation 
systems is the ability to find the optimum switching points 
between neighboring modulations. In this paper, we analyze 
the influence of the fading channel model in the optimum 
switching points, assuming a Nakagami-m fading model and 
both real and non-real-time traffic. Therefore, two criteria 
were considered to determine the optimum switching points: 
the maximum throughput criterion, for a real-time traffic 
scenario, and the delay criterion, for a non-real-time traffic 
scenario. 
Keywords- Adaptive modulation; delay criterion; maximum 
throughput criterion; Nakagami-m fading; optimum switching

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Due to the exponential growing of the traffic in 
telecommunications networks in the last years, problems like 
the demand for higher transmission rates and the scarcity of 
spectrum have become extremely relevant. Several studies 
have been developed in order to improve the performance 
and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for such networks. In 
this regard, the adaptive modulation technique has gained 
great attention as a promising solution to improve the 
performance of channels with time-varying conditions. For 
example, reference [1], published in ICN 2016, analyses the 
optimum switching point in an adaptive modulation system 
in a particular scenario. 
Adaptive modulation technique consists of the dynamic 
adaptation of the modulation scheme as a function of the 
channel’s state, according to a given performance criterion. 
The receiver makes an estimation of the channel state and 
sends this information back to the transmitter through a 
feedback channel. Based on this information, the transmitter 
modifies the modulation order, so that it better matches the 
conditions of the channel at that time [1] – [6]. 
The definition of the best points to switch between two 
modulations is a key issue in the adaptive modulation 
technique. In general, the change in modulation order occurs 
between neighboring modulations. Given a modulation with 
2n points in its constellation, the neighboring modulation has 
2n-1 or 2n+1 points in its constellation [1] [4] [5]. 
Several ways of determining the switching points 
between neighboring modulations have been mentioned in 
the literature. The most common are to determine the 
switching points as a function of a target for the bit error rate 
(BER) [2] or a target for the packet error rate (PER) in the 
channel [6]. However, as proven in [4], these criteria do not 
optimize some QoS parameters, such as throughput and 
delay; thus, these authors proposed the calculation of the 
optimum switching points based on the maximum 
throughput criterion, considering real-time traffic, and the 
delay to transmit a correct PDU (Packet Data Unit) for non-
real-time traffic. The analysis presented in [4] considers a 
memory-less channel, e.g., an AWGN (Additive White 
Gaussian Noise) channel in a wireless ATM (Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode) network. This approach, however, is not 
appropriate for several wireless channels, in which there is 
fading. Then, in [5], the authors extended the analysis 
presented in [4], taking into account Rayleigh fading 
channels. In [1], the authors extended the analysis presented 
in [4] and [5], considering a more general fading model: a 
Nakagami-m channel. However, in [1], the authors analyzed 
the influence of the channel model in the optimum switching 
points, taking into account only the maximum throughput 
criterion. 
In this paper, we extended the analysis presented in [1] 
[4] [5], examining in depth the influence of the channel 
model in the optimum switching points of an adaptive 
modulation scheme and considering a Nakagami-m fading 
channel and two scenarios: real-time and non-real-time 
traffic. To compute the optimum switching points, we use 
the maximum throughput criterion for scenarios with real-
time traffic and the delay criterion for non-real-time traffic, 
where a packet received with error can be retransmitted until 
it is correctly received. 
The analysis in this paper considers transmissions in a 
wireless network with a Nakagami-m block fading channel 
that uses adaptive M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation 
(M-QAM). 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In 
Section II, we introduce the system and channel models; in 
Section III, we present the calculation of the exact PER in 
the channel, which is necessary to compute the throughput 
and the delay. The maximum throughput criterion is 
presented in Section IV, and the delay criterion is discussed 
in Section V; Section VI presents the numerical results, and 
finally, we present our conclusions in Section VII.

II. 
SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODELS  
In this section, we define the characteristics of the system 
and the channel model considered in this paper. 
A. System Model 
The system is composed of one base station, which 
manages all traffic, and several users that transmit over the 
wireless network, following the model presented in [4]. We 
assume a network using TDMA (Time Division Multiple 
Access), where time is divided into frames composed of the 
downlink and uplink periods.  
In the downlink period, the base station communicates 
with the terminals through Time Division Multiplexing 
(TDM) and transmits the updated modulation information for 
users via broadcast. The modulation order is defined frame 
by frame based on the chosen performance criterion. In the 
uplink period, when users receive permission to transmit, 
they transmit data using TDMA. One TDMA frame is 
divided into X time slots, where each time slot allows the 
transmission of ns bits. 
In a communication system, data messages are usually 
transmitted in packets. In this paper, one data message 
containing nd bits is fragmented into Z packets, each packet 
with ns bits. Only one packet is transmitted in each time slot. 
In addition, each user has only one time slot per frame for 
their transmissions. Thus, Z frames are necessary to transmit 
a data message, Z = nd/ns. Figure 1 illustrates the frame 
structure and the transmission process in the uplink. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Channel Model 
We assume a slowly-varying Nakagami-m block fading 
channel, whose complex gain values remains invariant over a 
single frame but may vary between adjacent frames. Thus, 
the choice of modulation order is made on a frame-by-frame 
basis [1] – [3] [6]. So, the probability density function (pdf) 
of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is given by [2] [6]:

 and m is the 
Nakagami fading parameter [2] [6]. 
The Nakagami-m probability distribution is widely used 
in the literature to represent a wide range of well-known 
multipath fades [2]. The Nakagami-m fading model is 
equivalent to a set of independent Rayleigh fading channels 
obtained by maximum ratio combining (MRC), where m 
represents the diversity order [7]. So, other distributions can 
be modeled with the variation of parameter m. For instance, 
when m = 0.5, the Nakagami-m fading model represents the 
unilateral Gaussian distribution (which corresponds to the 
greatest amount of multipath fading scenarios); when m = 1, 
the Nakagami-m distribution results in a Rayleigh 
distribution model, and when m > 1, there is a one-to-one 
mapping between the Nakagami fading parameter and the 
Rician factor, which allows the Nakagami distribution to 
approach the Rice distribution [2]. Moreover, reference [2] 
claims that the Nakagami-m distribution often provides the 
best fit for urban and indoor multipath propagation. Thus, in 
this paper, we analyze the influence of the variation of the 
diversity order m in the optimum switching points in an 
adaptive modulation scheme. 
III. 
CALCULATION OF THE EXACT PER 
To compute the throughput and the delay in the network, 
it is necessary to compute the PER. In this section, we 
summarize the approach used to compute the instantaneous 
and average PER. 
A. Instantaneous PER 
In the scenario considered in this paper, the base station 
defines the best modulation in terms of the throughput or 
delay that the terminal should use to transmit data in the 
uplink frame. Six modulation schemes were chosen for our 
analysis: M-QAM with M = 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256. Each 
M-ary modulation scheme has Rn bits per symbol, where n = 
1, 2… 6 and represents the modulation mode set at the 
moment.  
In the current literature, the calculation of the PER is 
usually given as a function of the BER, and it is given as [6]: 



(2) 
where ns represents the number of bit in a packet. 
The expression (2) considers a system where the bits 
inside a packet have the same BER, with uncorrelated bit-
errors. However, for large-size QAM constellations, the 
author of [6] claims that the PER calculation using (2) is not

accurate since the information bits of the same packet occur 
with different error probabilities for such constellations. 
Thus, in this paper, we considered the approach proposed 
by [6] to compute the PER, which is based on the 
methodology proposed in [8] to compute the exact BER for 
an arbitrary rectangular M-QAM modulation.  
Following [8], we assume that a rectangular M-QAM 
modulation can be modeled as two independent I-ary and J-
ary pulse amplitude modulations (PAM), where M = I x J.  
The exact BER calculation is obtained by observing regular 
patterns that occur due to the characteristics of Gray code bit 
mapping. The error probability of the kth bit in-phase 
components of the I-ary PAM , where k ϵ {1, 2, …, log2 I}, is 
given by [8]:

finally  I = 2 and J = 4 for 8-QAM. 
B. Average PER 
In order to consider the influence of the channel fading in 
the system, we initially need to find the average PER value. 
For each modulation, the average PER can be determined by 
the integral of the instantaneous PER for the current 
modulation (n) multiplied by the probability density function 
of the average symbol energy-to-noise density ratio (Es/N0), 
which in this case is the pdf of a Nakagami-m distribution [6] 
[9] [10]. So, the average PER is defined by:

IV. 
THE MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT CRITERION 
The maximum throughput criterion has been considered 
in the real-time traffic scenario, where no error correction 
protocol was implemented. To compute the throughput, only 
successfully transmitted packets were considered (a 
parameter referred as goodput by some authors). We also 
assume an adaptive modulation scheme without error control 
coding, where all transmitted bits are information bits. 
Following [4], to compute the normalized throughput of the 
current modulations, we consider the following parameters: 
 
The ratio between the maximum number of 
transmitted bits and the maximum number of 
possible bits. In other words, the number of bits per 
symbol of the current modulation over the number of 
bits per symbol of a reference modulation; 
 
The percentage of packets correctly received. 
So, the normalized throughput of the current modulation 
is given by:

DELAY CRITERION 
In 
communication 
systems 
with 
non-real-time 
applications, 
in 
general, 
errors 
are 
corrected 
by 
retransmission using some retransmission protocol. In this 
context, the average time to transmit a correct data message 
is an important criterion to analyze the system performance 
[4] [5]. 
In our analysis, we consider that the ARQ (Automatic 
Repeat ReQuest) protocol is implemented at the data 
message level. Thus, if a single data packet is not 
successfully 
received, 
the 
entire 
data 
message 
is 
retransmitted. In this scenario, the average time to transmit a 
correct data message for a given modulation is given by [4]:

The optimum switching points between neighboring

average time to transmit a data message for a 2n-1-QAM 
modulation, with n = 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4. Thus, using (9), (11)

VI. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, we present numerical results for the 
optimum switching points using the maximum throughput 
criterion and delay criterion. We analyze the influence of the 
fading on the optimum switching points by varying the 
diversity order m of the Nakagami fading considering m = 
0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 10, where the last value was used in order to 
consider an AWGN-like channel. 
The calculation of the average PER is made by (3), (4), 
(5) and (6). Then, the PER is replaced in (8) to compute the 
probability that a packet was correctly received for 
throughput criterion and replaced in (10) to compute the 
probability that a data message was correctly received for 
delay criterion. All computations were performed using the 
Mathcad software. 
When the system switches from one modulation to 
another one, the transmission power, or the average symbol 
energy, is kept constant. Thus, following [1] [4] [5], we 
analyze the system performance as a function of the 
parameter Es/N0, which represents the average symbol 
energy-to-noise density ratio. 
A. Throughput Criterion 
To calculate the normalized throughput (η), we replaced 
the result found by (8) in (7). We considered 256-QAM as 
the reference modulation and set the packet length, following 
[4], as ns = 424 bits. 
The optimum switching point between two neighboring 
modulations is obtained by the crossover point of the 
corresponding curves of the throughput (η).  
Figures 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 show the throughput curves as a 
function of the average symbol energy-to-noise density ratio, 
for 256-, 128- and 64-QAM modulations, considering  m = 
47

0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 10, respectively. Figures 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 
show the throughput curves as a function of the average 
symbol energy-to-noise density ratio, for 64-, 32-, 16- and 8-
QAM modulations, again considering m = 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 10, 
respectively. 
Table I presents the optimum switching points and the 
throughput at these points. We can observe that the 
throughput at the switching points increases as m grows. In 
other words, if the channel fading becomes less severe, the 
throughput at these switching points increases. 
In addition, we can see that the optimum points vary with 
the fading order (represented by the parameter m of the 
Nakagami model), and for a particular value of m, we can 
observe that the average symbol energy-to-noise density 
ratio in the switching points is not fixed, but varies with the 
neighboring modulations.

Finally, through the analysis of Figures 3 to 12 and Table 
I, we can observe that some switching points between some 
neighboring modulations are close to each other. For 
example, the switching point between the neighboring 
modulations 256-QAM to 128-QAM is close to the 
switching point between the neighboring modulations 128-
QAM to 64-QAM when m assumes the values m = 1, 2, 3 
and 10. The same behavior can be observed for the switching 
point between the neighboring modulations 64-QAM to 32-
QAM and the switching point between the neighboring 
modulations 32-QAM to 16-QAM. Consequently, their 
throughput values are also very close to each other. 
Therefore, we can conclude that some modulations (like 128-
QAM and 32-QAM) should not be considered for the 
implementation of an adaptive modulation scheme when the 
throughput criterion is considered. 
Moreover, for the case of more severe fading, when m = 
0.5, the switching point from 128 to 64-QAM occurs before 
the switching point from 256 to 128-QAM. The same occurs

for the switching point from 32 to 16-QAM, which occurs 
before the switching point from 64 to 32-QAM. So, we can 
conclude that 128-QAM and 32-QAM modulations should 
not be used in the adaptive modulation system in this case.

B. Delay Criterion 
To compute the performance factor (δ), we employ the 
result obtained by (10) in (13) and, following [4], set the 
parameters X = 10 and K = 1. Now, the optimum switching 
point between two neighboring modulations is obtained by 
the crossover point of the curves of the performance factor 
(δ) with the line δ = 1. 
1) Analysis of the Influence of the Z: 
 Initially, we analyzed the influence of the length of the 
data message in the performance factor (δ). For this, we vary 
the parameter Z for a fixed slot size equal to ns = 424 bits. 
Figures 13 and 14 represent the performance factor curves 
between modulations 256- and 128-QAM and between 
modulations 128- and 64-QAM, respectively, considering Z 
= 1, 10, 100 and 1000 and the diversity order m = 10 
(approaching an AWGN channel performance). We can 
observe that the optimum switching point depends on the 
data message length. As Z increases, so will the value of 
Es/N0 at this optimum switching point. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2) Comparing the results for throughput and delay 
criteria: 
In this section, we compare the results obtained by the 
maximum throughput and the delay criteria. To be fair, we 
set Z = 1, and we compute the optimum switching points for 
both criteria. As Z = 1, the number of bits in a time slot, ns, is 
equal to the length of a data message, nd. Two packet lengths 
are considered in our analysis: ns = 424 and 4240 bits. Again, 
in order to consider the effect of the channel model in the 
optimum switching points, we consider the diversity order, 
m, equal to 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 10.  
Figures 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 show the performance 
factor curves for ns = 424 bits and m = 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 10, 
respectively. Figures 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 show the 
performance factor curves for m = 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 10,

respectively, but consider a larger packet size, ns = 4240 bits. 
The performance factor curves in these figures are between 
the following modulations: 256- and 128-QAM, 128- and 
64-QAM, 64- and 32-QAM, 32- and 16-QAM, and 16- and

Table II shows the optimum switching points between 
neighboring modulations for ns = 424 bits for both criteria.

Analyzing Tables II and III, and the Figures 15 to 24, we 
can observe that the optimum switching points for the delay 
criterion assume values of Es/N0 larger than the optimum 
switching points for the throughput criterion. Thus, the 
optimum switching points depend on of the considered 
criterion. We can also see that the greater the length of the 
data message, the larger is the Es/N0 in the optimum 
switching points. 
We can observe again that the optimum switching points 
change as m varies. Thus, the optimum switching points 
depend on the channel model.

It can also be seen that the average symbol energy-to-
noise density in the optimum switching points using the 
delay criterion decreases as m increases.  
Similarly to the throughput criterion, in the case of the 
delay criterion and m = 0.5, the switching point from 128- to 
64-QAM occurs before the switching point from 256- to 
128-QAM for both values of ns. In addition, the switching 
point from 32- to 16-QAM occurs before the switching point 
from 64- to 32-QAM. Thus, again, for m = 0.5, the 
modulations 128-QAM and 32-QAM should not be used in 
the adaptive modulation system if the delay criterion is used.

VII. CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we considered a system with adaptive 
modulation and a Nakagami-m fading channel. We analyzed 
the influence of the channel model in the optimum switching 
points between neighboring modulations considering two 
scenarios: real-time and non-real-time traffic. To compute 
these points, we employed the maximum throughput 
criterion for real-time traffic and the mean time to transmit a 
data message for non-real-time traffic.  We considered M-
QAM modulations, with M = 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256, and 
we varied the diversity order of the channel setting, i.e., m = 
0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 10. 
We concluded that the optimum switching points depend 
on the channel model and on the type of the traffic in the 
system (real-time and non-real-time traffic) that defines the 
best criterion to compute the switching points.  
We also observed that for the throughput criterion, some 
modulations (like 128-QAM and 32-QAM) can be neglected 
in the implementation of a practical adaptive modulation 
scheme. 
Furthermore, for systems where the fading channel is 
severe (m = 0.5), the switching point from 128- to 64-QAM 
occurs before the switching point from 256- to 128-QAM, 
and the switching point from 32- to 16-QAM occurs before 
the switching point from 64- to 32-QAM, for both criteria 
(throughput and delay). Therefore, 128-QAM and 32-QAM 
should not be used in the adaptive modulation system in this 
case.
