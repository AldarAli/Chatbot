Abstract—Most myoelectric controlled systems are based on 
the common assumption that there is no information in the 
instantaneous value of the myoelectric signal and therefore, 
analysis is made on the steady state of the muscle contraction. 
However, this control scheme faces two main drawbacks: users 
need to be trained in order to produce the sustained 
contractions, and the control signal can only be generated until 
the steady state is reached. Prosthetic devices with long 
actuating delays often result in users’ frustration and 
eventually, in the abandonment of the devices. As a proposed 
solution, analysis of the transient state of the electromyography 
(EMG) signal would allow classifying movements during the 
dynamic part of the muscle contractions reducing the time 
required to generate control commands. This paper proposes a 
novel method for transient EMG classification based on the use 
of Hjorth’s parameters. Surface multichannel EMG signals 
were recorded from 10 normally limbed subjects for both the 
transient and steady EMG states while performing six different 
hand motions. Comparatively high classification accuracy was 
obtained from the transient state analysis of the signals 
suggesting the existence of deterministic information in this 
part of the muscle contraction and the fact that Hjorth’s 
parameters seem to adapt well enough to the nature of 
myoelectric signals as to allow extracting highly representative 
information from them.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Research on the use of electromyography (EMG) for 
upper limb prostheses control has been conducted since the 
1940’s [1]. In the following years, remarkable progress in 
myoelectric controlled devices has been achieved; however, 
still numerous challenges remain in signal processing in 
order to replicate as close as possible the functions of the 
human limb. Development on this area must be closely 
related 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
psychological 
complexities that the amputee faces [2] due to the fact that 
the prosthetic device becomes an extension of the patient’s 
body.  
High 
abandonment 
rates 
reported 
for 
upper 
limb 
prosthesis [3] make evident the need to improve myoelectric 
control. The performance of a myoelectric controlled system 
is evaluated with regards to three important aspects of 
controllability [4]: the accuracy of movement selection, the 
intuitiveness of the actuating control, and the response time 
of the control system. A 200 to 300 ms interval is a clinically 
recognized maximum delay that users find acceptable before 
they get frustrated with the response time of the 
prosthesis [4]-[6]. Hence, the motivation to analyze the 
transient state of the EMG signal arises in order to identify 
movements while the muscle contraction is being generated 
and not until it reaches a steady state. 
The EMG signal is a non-stationary, non-linear, and 
stochastic process produced as a result of the summation of 
several motor unit action potential trains (MUAPTs) [1],[7]-
[9]. However, two main states can be recognized during the 
muscle contraction. The transient state is described as the 
bursts of myoelectric activity that accompany sudden 
muscular effort while executing the movement. It is related 
with the beginning of the activation of the motor units (MUs) 
that will be involved in the muscle contraction. The steady 
state corresponds to the part of the contraction when almost 
every MU that will be involved in the movement is already 
activated. It will be considered as the muscular effort during 
a sustained contraction when the movement’s final position 
is reached, and the muscle length is no longer modified, i.e., 
the myoelectric signal produced by a stable muscle 
contraction [10],[11]. 
The aim of this work is to propose a novel method for 
transient state analysis of the multichannel EMG signal by 
using normalized slope descriptors (NSDs) as features for 
classification. The main objectives are proving that Hjorth’s 
parameters are suitable for EMG analysis, and demonstrating 
the possibility of identifying movements from the beginning 
of the muscle contraction in order to reduce the delay 
obtained when waiting until the steady state is reached to 
generate the control signal.  
 In the following sections, this paper provides an 
overview of the state of the art in the use of the transient 
EMG state for movement identification followed by an 
introduction to Hjorth’s parameters and there use in 
biomedical applications. Subsequently, it explains the 
method that was followed, including the data acquisition 
protocol and the signal processing method, as well as the 
results obtained from the analysis of both the transient and 
steady EMG signals recorded from 10 normally limbed

subjects in order to identify a set of hand and wrist 
movements. Results are discussed and compared to 
previously reported methods. Finally, the last section 
presents conclusions and some ideas on the future work that 
can be done. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF THE TRANSIENT 
EMG STATE FOR MYOELECTRIC CONTROL 
EMG classification has been most often based on the 
steady state analysis of the muscle contraction. This has 
greatly 
simplified 
commercial 
myoelectric 
controlled 
systems that usually rely on the premise of the accepted 
myoelectric signal generation models. However, the steady 
state contains a short temporal structure of the active 
modification of recruitment and firing patterns involved in 
the contraction and that can be found within the transient 
state [1],[5],[6],[10]. In 1993, Hudgins et al. [5] were the 
first to consider the structure in the myoelectric signal (MES) 
during the onset of the contraction to develop a new control 
strategy based on the analysis of the transient EMG state. 
They were able to discriminate between four movements 
with roughly 90% accuracy. Only a few studies, such as 
[12]-[15], have reported the use of the transient state to 
classify EMG signals. Englehart et al. [6] introduced the use 
of Wavelet Transform (WT) and Wavelet Packet Transform 
(WPT) for classification of transient EMG signals. They 
classified more accurately the steady state than the transient 
data. However, Hangrove et al. [16] showed that including 
transient data along with steady state data while training the 
classifier increases the classification error, but it also 
increases real-time performance and system usability, which 
should be considered when evaluating the system.   
The use of multichannel EMG provides a better 
representation of the real muscle activity in the collected 
signal [17]-[19]. The increase in classification performance 
while increasing the number of channels was investigated 
in [20]. Moreover, with multichannel EMG, the positions of 
the electrodes become less critical [21], making it a 
promising technique. However, when extrapolating the 
system to amputees, an excessive number of electrode sites 
could be hard or even not possible to locate.  
Interference and muscle crosstalk introduce non-linearity 
into the EMG signal. The combination of muscle tissue, 
adipose tissue, skin, and the skin-electrode interface behaves 
like a non-linear low pass filter that attenuates and distorts 
the surface EMG signal; nevertheless, methods for non-
linear time series analysis have not been widely applied to 
EMG [7].  
III. 
HJORTH’S PARAMETERS 
Hjorth introduced, in 1970, three parameters based on 
time domain properties [22]-[25]. They were intended as a 
clinically useful tool capable of describing quantitatively the 
graphical characteristics of an electroencephalography 
(EEG) trace in terms of amplitude, slope, and slope spread, 
so that they receive the name of normalized slope descriptors 
(NSDs). These parameters are named “activity”, “mobility”, 
and “complexity”. 
Activity measures the variance of the amplitude of the 
signal as shown in (1). In the frequency domain, it can be 
conceived as the envelope of the power spectrum.  
Mobility measures the ratio between the standard 
deviation of the slope and the standard deviation of the 
amplitude given per time unit; hence, it represents dominant 
frequency. This ratio depends on the curve shape in such a 
way that it measures the relative average slope. Its 
mathematical definition is presented in (2). 
Complexity is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies 
any deviation from the sine shape as an increase from unit. It 
is calculated as shown in (3). It can be interpreted as a 
measure of the signal’s bandwidth.

where 𝑚!  is the spectral moment at order n, 𝜎!
!  is the 
variance from the analyzed segment of the non-linear time 
series f(t), and 𝜎! and 𝜎! are the standard deviations of the 
first and second derivatives of f(t), respectively. It has been 
shown that the spectral moment of order 2n corresponds to 
the variance 𝜎!
! of the derivative of order n [24], so that: 
𝑚! = 𝜎!
!, 𝑚! = 𝜎!

The spectral moment 𝑚! can also be calculated in terms 
of its frequency as shown in (4).

S 𝜔  corresponds to the power density spectrum, and it is 
obtained from the multiplication of the Fourier Transform, 
𝐹 𝜔 , by its conjugate, 𝐹∗ 𝜔 , which causes the phase to be 
excluded. As the frequency description from the Fourier 
transform is always symmetrical with respect to zero 
frequency, in a statistical approach to the shape of the 
frequency distribution, all odd moments will become zero, 
and the information will be contained in the even moments.  
Hjorth’s parameters serve as a bridge between a physical 
time domain interpretation and the conventional frequency 
domain description [23]. The transformation between both 
domains is based on the energy equality within the actual 
epoch and can be calculated by the time-frequency 
relationship shown in (5)-(7).

Hjorth’s parameters were originally formulated for EEG 
analysis and description and have been widely used in sleep 
EEG processing for data reduction and discrimination of 
sleep stages [26]-[28]. Other studies related with EEG signal 
analysis have reported the use of Hjorth’s parameters for 
applications such as psychotropic drug research [26],[27], 
assessment of postalcoholic diseases [29], temporal lobe 
seizures lateralization [25], classification of facial movement 
artifacts in the EEG signal [30], monitoring changes in EEG 
signals of patients with renal failure before and after 
hemodialysis [31], creating ink topographic displays for 
visual monitoring of changes in EEG signals [32], evaluation 
of performance in channel reduction for EEG classification 
in emotion assessment [33], among others. Mouzé-Amady 
and Horwat [34] applied NSDs to EMG signals and 
concluded that they could be used to describe the spectral 
content of surface EMG during repetitive movements due to 
their results of high correlation coefficients (ranging from 
0.81 to 0.93) between Hjorth’s mobility and the FFT mean 
frequency. Hjorth’s parameters have also been applied 
successfully in non-biomedical fields [22]. 
IV. 
METHOD 
A.  Data Acquisition Protocol 
The surface EMG signals used for this study were those 
recorded in [35] using 8 differential channels (Ag-AgCl 
surface electrodes model VERMED NeuroPlus A10043 with 
an inter-electrode distance of 1.5 cm) placed on the dominant 
forearm of 10 normally limbed subjects, aged between 23 
and 50, and with no register of neuromuscular disorders. The 
electrode disposition is shown in Fig. 1. To ensure the 
positioning of the electrodes over the muscles of interest, 
each participant was asked to repeatedly close and open the 
hand in order to identify the muscles mentioned in table I.

The skin was carefully cleaned before electrode 
placement, and the reference electrode was located on the 
elbow. Each subject was asked to execute six different hand 
motions, 
namely 
hand 
opening/closing, 
wrist 
pronation/supination, and wrist flexion/extension. The series 
of movements were repeated five times with a one-minute 
rest between them in order to avoid muscle fatigue. Each 
recording was 20 seconds long, starting with the forearm in 
an inactive position, followed by the dynamic part of the 
contraction, and finished by sustaining the contraction, once 
the final position was reached, until the end of the recording.  
Written consent was obtained from every subject before 
starting the study. In a previous session, the protocol was 
explained to each of the participants and the amplification 
gain of the eight differential EMG channels was calibrated 
according to the amplitude of the contraction for each 
subject.  
In order to reduce unwanted variability, every participant 
was asked to perform the study in a standing position with 
the dominant arm extended to the front and the hand relaxed.  
The acquisition system consisted of 8 differential 
channels with adjustable amplification gain and a first order 
analog band-pass filter with a low cut-off frequency of 20 Hz 
and a high cut-off frequency of 400 Hz. Each analog output 
was connected to a National Instruments acquisition card 
(model DAQ-Card 6024WE) for 12-bit A/D conversion. 
EMG signals were recorded with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. 
B. Data Processing 
The multichannel EMG signals were processed and 
analyzed using MATLAB® (version R2012b). Each 
recording was divided by supervision in transient and steady 
states. The transient state was extracted from the part of the 
EMG recording that corresponded to the dynamic part of the 
movement. The steady state consisted of the section in the 
recording where the final position was reached and the 
muscle contraction was sustained. A Hamming window was 
applied to segment the signal for feature extraction. 
Classification performance was tested with two window 
lengths, 256 and 128 ms, both with 50% sample overlap. 
A wavelet shrinkage method at third level of 
decomposition and based on Stein’s unbiased risk estimate

(SURE) was applied to each windowed segment for de-
noising purposes and to narrow the signal’s frequency band. 
The decomposition level was chosen considering that the 
main concentration of energy in the surface EMG signal is 
located within the band of 50-150 Hz. The de-noised signals 
were rescaled using a noise level dependent estimation.  
Once the window length was selected, Hjorth’s 
parameters were calculated per channel for each of the 
segments using (1)-(3). This was made for every movement. 
Each of these parameters constituted an independent input; 
they were arranged in rows in order to build the feature 
matrix. Four different input matrices were tested to evaluate 
which one yielded the best performance. The first one 
contained as inputs the three parameters for each of the 
channels. The other three consisted of just two independent 
inputs per channel excluding one of the parameters in each 
case, i.e., the first one excluded complexity, the second one 
excluded mobility, and the third one excluded activity. 
C. Artificial Neural Network’s Parameters 
For classification of the EMG signals, an artificial neural 
network (ANN) model was trained using the aforementioned 
feature matrices as inputs, containing 24 independent inputs 
when using the three parameters and 16 in the cases where 
two parameters were used. A Bayesian regulation 
backpropagation algorithm was used to train the model. The 
final ANN’s architecture depended on the available feature 
matrix dimension; however, the model consisted of only one 
hidden layer with 9 neurons in it. This number of neurons 
was defined based on experimental testing. For classification 
purposes, the network output was binary codified, i.e., a 
unique 3-digit combination of zeros and ones was used to 
identify each of the movements.   
In order to evaluate the network’s performance, a k-fold 
cross-validation process (k=5) was carried out.

RESULTS 
A.  Window Length Selection 
Two Hamming windows of different size were tested 
over the whole transient data set. The first one had a length 
of 256 ms and the second one of 128 ms. Both windows 
were applied with a 50% sample overlap. Table II and Fig. 2 
show the classification percentage obtained for each window 
length.

Classification percentage did not decrease dramatically 
when using the 128 ms window length as compared to the 
256 ms window; therefore, the smaller window size was 
used for the following tests considering that decreasing 
processing delays was one of the objectives.  
B. Hjorth’s Parameters Selection 
Classification performance was evaluated with four 
different feature matrices in order to select which of Hjorth’s 
parameters allowed extracting the most representative 
information from the signals. Each matrix consisted of a 
different set of Hjorth’s parameters as previously explained 
in section IV.    
The test was applied on the transient state of the EMG 
signals. The obtained results are shown in Table III. The 
column labeled ‘A, M, and C’ contains the classification 
percentages for each movement type using the three Hjorth’s 
parameters. The three following columns denote the 
classification percentages obtained when using just two of 
the parameters.     
The mean classification error percentage obtained from 
using each feature matrix was calculated and is presented in 
Fig. 3. These percentages consider the mean classification 
for the whole test population including every movement 
type.

Figure 3. Mean classification error percentage obtained by using different 
 combinations of Hjorth’s parameters as features for classification. 
As the lowest classification error was obtained from 
using mobility and complexity as input features, the 
following comparison between classification performance 
using the transient and steady EMG states was made with 
this selected feature matrix.  
The parameter ‘activity’ was no longer considered for 
the analysis.     
C. Comparison in Classification Accuracy of the Transient 
and Steady EMG States 
Previous studies such as [6], have reported higher 
classification accuracy when using the steady state of the 
EMG signal as compared to the transient state; therefore, the 
proposed method was evaluated for both EMG states. The 
mean classification percentages obtained for each of the 
subjects are presented in Table IV. The comparison in mean 
classification accuracy per movement type is illustrated in

VI. 
DISCUSSION 
The proposed method departs from the use of features 
originally intended for EEG description. The EEG signal is 
formed by the superposition of characteristic responses; in a 
similar way, the EMG signal is the superposition of MUAPs, 
which seems to make Hjorth’s parameters also suitable for 
their analysis due to the nature of myoelectric sources. 
The parameters’ values, except for activity, referring to a 
single response, are also valid for a superposition of 
responses [23], which can justify that classification error 
increases when including this parameter, as shown in Fig. 3. 
For non-periodic phenomena with a limited complexity, as it 
is the case of the EMG signal, the basic information is 
essentially contained in the first few polynomial coefficients; 
therefore, 
the 
number 
of 
required 
(non-redundant) 
parameters correspond to the complexity of the system under 
observation [24]. Several studies [25],[26],[28],[31] have 
reported to find significant information in EEG traces using 
just two of Hjorth’s parameters; furthermore, three of them 
reported to find them in mobility and complexity as it was 
the case in the present study.    
Hjorth explained in [24] the way in which Hjorth’s 
parameters describe first and second order responses of a 
system. The response of a first order system is an 
exponentially decaying impulse 𝑒!∝! , where α is the 
inverse time constant of the system. When Hjorth’s 
parameters are computed for this response, mobility is 
identical to α and hence describes the system. The response 
of a second order system is modeled as a decaying sinusoid 
𝑒!∝! ∙ sin  (𝛽 ∙ 𝑡) . The relationship between Hjorth’s 
parameters and the constants of the system are given in (8). 
By making some algebraic manipulations, the constants can 
be expressed as a function of Hjorth’s parameters as in (9).

Based on the previous assumptions, the system is 
completely determined by mobility and complexity. The 
number of required descriptors to obtain the basic 
information of the system corresponds to the system’s order. 
The muscle contraction can be modeled as a second order 
system, which would justify the performance achieved by 
using these two parameters.  
The mean classification percentage obtained from the 
steady EMG signals was just slightly higher than the one 
reported for the transient state (refer to Fig. 4). This suggests 
that similar classification accuracy can be obtained from both 
EMG states using Hjorth’s parameters as compared to 
previous reported methods [6].   
The lowest classification percentages using both the 
transient and steady states corresponded to pronation and 
supination movements. This indicates that the muscles 
recorded by the EMG channels, which are mainly flexors 
and extensors, had less participation in these two movement 
types. Classification accuracy did not suffer a significant 
decrease when using a window length of 128 ms as 
compared to one of 256 ms, which could allow obtaining a 
faster response for control purposes and would make it more 
suitable for on-line applications.  
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
It has been widely discussed whether or not the transient 
state of the muscle contraction contains enough relevant 
information as to accurately discriminate between different 
types of motions; however, Hjorth’s parameters seem to 
adapt well enough to the transient MES as to extract highly 
representative information from it. Most myoelectric 
controlled devices have been based on the assumption that 
there is no information in the instantaneous value of the 
MES; therefore, it is necessary to wait until a sustained 
stable contraction is reached in order to generate the control 
signal and start actuating the device, which is not desirable in 
clinical applications. The present study reaffirms the 
existence of deterministic components within the onset part 
of the muscle contraction as initially proposed by 
Hudgins et al. [5], and the fact that the information is 
relevant enough as to discriminate between the proposed 
movements. Using the transient EMG state for myoelectric 
control would allow generating a control signal since the 
beginning of the muscle contraction, which would also 
resemble more to the natural movement of the human limb 
and would allow diminishing the actuating delay of the 
devices. Even if classification is slightly higher when using 
the steady state, including transient MES information can 
lead to more robust usability and performance. If the system 
is capable of identifying the transient EMG state, the subject 
is simply prompted to perform a contraction in a natural 
manner instead of needing long training periods to learn how 
to make the sustained contractions.  
Hjorth’s parameters allow characterizing signals in both 
the time and frequency domains. Although they are based on 
spectral moments, they can be calculated using time 
variances, which implies simpler processing and makes it 
more suitable for continuous on-line calculations as 
compared to frequency-domain analysis that normally 
requires complex transformations. 
The analyzed data proved to contain significant 
information within the first 128 ms of the onset of the 
contraction. Classification was more accurate when using a 
256 ms window for feature extraction; however, this value 
gets really close to the clinically recognized maximum delay 
for real-time applications (200 to 300 ms), and the total 
system’s delay has yet to be considered. Thus, a 128 ms 
window seems to provide a good compromise between 
system’s accuracy and response time. 
Using multichannel EMG signals allows recording 
information from several muscle sites, which allows 
analyzing the participation of corresponding muscles on a 
certain movement; however, when using a great number of 
electrodes, extrapolating the system to an amputee patient 
becomes very complex and sometimes not feasible.  
As future work, we propose to use a greater number of 
subjects to test the algorithm’s performance; to develop a 
reliable method to automatically identify the onset of the 
contraction regardless of the noise affecting the system, 
which would allow automatically initiating feature extraction 
in order to generate the control signal; to increase the number 
of movements to identify; and to extrapolate the system to 
amputee subjects.
