Abstract - In this paper, we present as far as we know for the 
first time, a unique method combining visibility analysis in 3D 
environments with dynamic motion planning algorithm, 
named Visibility Velocity Obstacles (VVO). Our method is 
based on two major steps. The first step is based on analytic 
visibility boundaries calculation in 3D environments, taking 
into account sensors' capabilities including probabilistic 
consideration. In the second stage, we generate VVO 
transferring visibility boundaries from the position space to the 
velocity space, for each object. Each VVO represents velocity's 
set of possible future collision and visibility boundaries. Based 
on our analysis in velocity space, we plan our trajectory by 
selecting future robot's velocity at each time step, tracking 
after specific target considering visibility constraints as 
integral part of the velocities space. We formulate the tracked 
target in the environment as part of our planner and include 
visibility analysis for the next time step as part of our planning 
in the same search space. For the first time, we define visibility 
aspects as part of velocity space, where all the objects are 
modeled from visibility point of view. We introduce potential 
trajectory planner combining unified 3D visibility analysis for 
target tracking as part of dynamic motion planning.

 INTRODUCTION 
Trajectory 
planning 
has 
developed alongside 
the 
increasing numbers of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), 
drones unmanned ground vehicles all over the world, with a 
wide range of applications such as surveillance, information 
gathering, suppression of enemy defenses, air to air combat, 
mapping buildings and facilities, etc. 
Most of these applications are involved in very 
complicated environments (e.g., urban), with complex terrain 
for civil and military domains [1].  
With these growing needs, several basic capabilities must 
be achieved. One of these capabilities is the need to avoid 
obstacles such as buildings or other moving objects, while 
autonomously navigating in 3D urban environments. 
Path planning problems have been extensively studied in 
the robotics community, finding a collision-free path in static 
or dynamic environments, i.e., moving or static obstacles. 
Over the past twenty years, many methods have been 
proposed, such as starting roadmap, cell decomposition, and 
potential field [6]. 
In this paper, we present visibility aspects as part of 
velocity space, where all the objects are modeled from 
visibility point of view. We introduce potential trajectory 
planner combining unified 3D visibility analysis for target 
tracking as part of dynamic motion planning. In the first part, 
we formulate visibility boundaries problem and introduce 
analytic solution that in the following sub-section integrated 
with sensor's limitations. Later on, we present the VVO 
method, demonstrated with visibility boundaries with cars, 
pedestrians and buildings visibility boundaries. In the last 
part, we suggest pursuer planner using VVO for UAV test 
case.  
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Path planning becomes trajectory planning when a time 
dimension is added for dynamic obstacles [7][8]. Later on, a 
vehicle's dynamic and kinematic constraints have been taken 
into account, in a process called kinodynamic planning [9]. 
All of these methods focus solely on obstacle avoidance. 
Trajectory planning for air traffic control and ground 
vehicles has been well studied [10], based on short path 
algorithms using 2D polygons, 3D surfaces [11]. UAVs 
navigation has also been explored with vision-based methods 
[12], with local planning or a predefined global path [13]. 
UAV path planning is different from simple robot path 
planning, due to the fact that a UAV cannot stop, and must 
maintain its velocity above the minimum, as well as not 
being able to make sharp turns. 
UAV path planning methods usually decompose the path 
planning into two steps: first, using some common path 
planning method in a polygonal environment [6], then, 
considering UAV dynamic and kinematic constraints into the 
trajectory [14]. These methods assume decoupling, which 
affects the trajectory, as stated by all authors.  
However, most of the effort focused on UAV trajectory 
planning is related to obstacle avoidance with kinodynamic 
constraints, without taking into account visibility analysis as 
part of the nature of the trajectory in urban environments.

The visibility problem has been extensively studied over 
the last twenty years, due to the importance of visibility in 
GIS and Geomatics, computer graphics and computer vision, 
and robotics. Accurate visibility computation in 3D 
environments is a very complicated task demanding a high 
computational effort, which could hardly have been done in 
a very short time using traditional well-known visibility 
methods [15]. The exact visibility methods are highly 
complex, and cannot be used for fast applications due to their 
long computation time. Previous research in visibility 
computation has been devoted to open environments using 
DEM models, representing raster data in 2.5D (Polyhedral 
model), and do not address, or suggest solutions for, dense 
built-up areas. Most of these works have focused on 
approximate visibility computation, enabling fast results 
using interpolations of visibility values between points, 
calculating point visibility with the Line of Sight (LOS) 
method [16]. Other fast algorithms are based on the 
conservative Potentially Visible Set (PVS) [17]. These 
methods are not always completely accurate, as they may 
render hidden objects' parts as visible due to various 
simplifications and heuristics. 
A vast number of algorithms have been suggested for 
speeding up the process and reducing computation time. 
Franklin [18] evaluated and approximated visibility for each 
cell in a DEM model based on greedy algorithms. Wang et 
al. [19] introduced a Grid-based DEM method using 
viewshed horizon, saving computation time based on 
relations between surfaces and the LOS method. Later on, an 
extended method for viewshed computation was presented, 
using reference planes rather than sightlines [20].  
One of the most efficient methods for DEM visibility 
computation is based on shadow-casting routine. The routine 
cast shadowed volumes in the DEM, like a light bubble [21]. 
Extensive research treated Digital Terrain Models (DTM) in 
open terrains, mainly Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) 
and Regular Square Grid (RSG) structures. Visibility 
analysis in terrain was classified into point, line and region 
visibility, and several algorithms were introduced, based on 
horizon computation describing visibility boundary [22]. 
Only a few works have treated visibility analysis in urban 
environments. A mathematical model of an urban scene, 
calculating probabilistic visibility for a given object from a 
specific viewcell in the scene, has been presented by [23]. 
This is a very interesting concept, which extends the 
traditional deterministic visibility concept. Nevertheless, the 
buildings are modeled as cylinders, and the main challenges 
of spatial analysis and building model were not tackled. 
Other methods were developed, subject to computer graphics 
and vision fields, dealing with exact visibility in 3D scenes, 
without considering environmental constraints. Plantinga and 
Dyer [15] used the aspect graph – a graph with all the 
different views of an object. Due to their computational 
complexity, all of these works are not applicable to a large 
scene with near real-time demands, such as UAV trajectory 
planning.

We extend our previous work [2], developed for a fast 
and efficient visibility analysis for buildings in urban 
environments, and consider also a basic structure of 
cylinders, which allows us to model pedestrians and trees. 
Based on our probabilistic visibility computation of dynamic 
objects, we test the effect of these by using data gathered 
from web-oriented GIS sources to update our estimation and 
prediction on these entities. 
B. Dynamic Objects – Modeling and Probabilistic Visibility 
Dynamic objects such as moving cars and pedestrians, 
directly affect visibility in urban environments. 
Due to modeling limitations, these entities are usually 
neglected in spatial analysis aspects. We focus on three 
major dynamic objects in an urban case: moving cars and 
pedestrians. Each object is modeled with 3D boxes or 3D 
cylinders, which allow us to extend the use of our previous 
visibility analysis in urban environments presented for static 
objects [2]. 
 
1) Moving Car 
 
3D Modeling: As we mentioned earlier, web-cameras in 
urban environments can record the moving cars at any

specific time. Image sources such as web cameras, like other 
similar sensors sources, demand an additional stage of 
Automatic Target Detection (ATD) algorithms to extract 
these objects from the image [31]. In this research we do not 
focus on ATD, which must be implemented when shifting 
from the research described in the paper toward an 
applicable system. 
The common car structure can be easily modeled by two 
3D boxes, as can be seen in Fig. 1(b), which is similar to the 
original car structure presented in Fig. 1(a).

Ccar(x, y, z) as presented extensively in [2] for a building

visible surfaces of the car object, from viewpoint 
V(x0, y0,z0), where the maximum surface's number is six and 
each surface defined by four points, NCBP_bound ≤ 24. 
In Fig. 2, the car is modeled by using two 3D boxes.

Probabilistic Visibility Analysis  
 
Visibility has been treated as Boolean values. Due to 
incomplete information and the uncertainties of predicting 
the car's location at future times, visibility becomes much 
more complicated. 
As it is well known from basic kinematics, CBP can be 
estimated in future time t + ∆t as: 
 
CBPi(t + ∆t) = CBPi(t) + V(t)∆t + A(t)∆t2
2
                              
 
Where V(t) is the car velocity vector V(t) = (vxvy  )T, and 
the acceleration vector  A(t) = (axay  )T. Estimation of a 
car's location in the future based on a web camera is not a 
simple task. Driver behavior generates multi-decision 
modeling, such as car-following behavior, gap acceptance 
behavior, or lane-change cases including traffic flow, speed 
etc. [32]. 
Our probabilistic car model is based on microscopic 
simulation models that were properly calibrated and 
validated using VISSIM simulation. VISSIM is a time-based 
microscopic simulation tool that uses various driver 
behaviors and vehicle performances to accurately represent 

350

an urban traffic model. The VISSIM simulation model has 
been validated when compared to the data from various real-
world situations [33] and used for the test-bed network by 
[34][35], and on driver behavior research defining average 
speed and acceleration [32]. 
The average speed in urban environments is about 45 
[km/hr], from a minimum of 40 [km/hr] up to a maximum of 
50 [km/hr]. In the situation of a free driving case, which is 
the common mode in urban environments [36], the 
acceleration 
of 
family 
car 
can 
change 
between 1 to 3.5 [m
⁄sec2
], and on average 2.5 [m
⁄sec2
], as 
seen in Fig. 3. 
 
Fig. 3. Average Acceleration Rate of a Family Car in an Urban 
Environment [32] 
As can be seen from several validations of car and driver 
estimation, velocity and acceleration are distributed as 
normal ones, and lead to normal location distribution: 
V(t)~N(μ = 45, σ2 = 10) 
A(t)~N(μ = 2.5, σ2 = 1) 
CBP(t + ∆t)~ ∑ N 
 
 
In time step t, where the car's location is taken from a 
web-camera, visibility analysis from CBP(t)is an exact one, 
based on our previous visibility analysis [2], as seen in Fig. 2 
Visibility analysis becomes probabilistic for future time t +
∆t, applying the same visibility analysis for CBP(t + ∆t) 
presented in Fig. 4. 
 
Fig. 4. Probabilistic Visibility Analysis for CBP 
In Fig. 4, the car's location from a web-camera appears in 
the bottom left side. For ∆t = 2[sec], the car's location is 
marked by two 3D boxes, where CBP for each of them is the 
boundary of visible surfaces marked in red. The probability 
that the visible surfaces, which are bounded by CBP, will be 
visible in future time is based on the last update taken from 
the web application (depicted with arrows in Fig. 4, 
computed by using two different random normal PDF values 
for V and A based on eq. (4). 
2) Pedestrians 
3D Modeling: Pedestrian modeling can be done in high 
resolution, but due to ATD algorithms capabilities, 
pedestrians are usually bounded by a 3D cylinder and not as 
an exact detailed model [31]. For this reason, we model 
pedestrians as 3D cylinders, which is somewhat conservative 
but still applicable. 
Pedestrian can be easily modeled by 3D cylinder, as seen 
in Fig. 5 (marked in red), which is similar to the output from 
ATD methods tested on a web-camera output recognizing 
walkers in urban environments. 
We extend our previous visibility analysis concept [2] and 
include new objects modeled as cylinders as continuous 
curves parameterizationCPeds(x, y, z).

As can be noted, these equations are not related to Z axis, 
and the visibility boundary points are the same for each x-y 
cylinder profile. 
The visibility statement leads to complex equation, which 
does not appear to be a simple computational task. This 
equation can be efficiently solved by finding where the 
equation changes its sign and crosses zero value; we used 
analytic solution to speed up computation time and to avoid 
numeric approximations. We generate two values of θ 
generating two silhouette points in a very short time 
computation. Based on an analytic solution to the cylinder 
case, a fast and exact analytic solution can be found for the 
visibility problem from a viewpoint. 
We define the solution presented in eq. (8) as x-y-z 
coordinates values for the cylinder case as Pedestrian 
Boundary Points (PBP). PBP are the set of visible 
silhouette points for a 3D cylinder modeling the pedestrian, 
as presented in Fig. 6:

C. Visibility Analysis Considering Sensor's Stochastic 
Character 
In this section, we extend our visibility model by 
exploring and including sensors' sensing capabilities and 
physical constraints. Our visibility analysis is based on the 
fact that sensors are located at specific visibility points. 
Sensors are commonly treated as deterministic detectors, 
where a target can only be detected or undetected. These 
simplistic sensing models are based on the disc model 
[37][38]. 
We study sensors' visibility-based placement effected by 
taking into account the stochastic character of target 
detection. We present a single sensor model, including noisy 
measurement, and define the necessary condition for 
visibility analysis with false alarm and detection probabilities 
for each visibility point's candidate. 
 
1) Single Visibility Sensing Model 
Most of the physical signals are based on energy vs. 
distance from single source model. Different kind of sensors 
such as: radars, lasers, acoustics, etc., are based on this signal 
character. Like other signal models presented in the literature 
[39][40][41] we use signal decay model as follows:

L(d) = {
L0
( d
d0)k
, if d > d0
L0,
if d ≤ d0
 
 
where L0 is the original energy emitted by the target, k is the 
decaying factor (typical values from 2 to 5), and d0 is a 
constant determined by the size of the target and the sensor. 
We model the sensor's noise Ni located at visibility point 
Vi , using zero-mean normal distribution, Ni~N(0, σ2) . 
Sensor signal energy including noise effect, Si , can be 
formulated as: 
 
Si = L(di) + Ni
2 
 
In practice, Si parameters are set by empiric datasets.  
 
2) Necessary Condition for Visibility  
Nowadays, detection systems use more and more data 
fusion methods [42][43]. In order to use multi sensors 
benefits, fusion and local decision-making using several 
sensors' data is a very common capability. As with other 
distributed data fusion methods, we assume that each sensor 
sends the energy measurement to a Local Decision Making 
Module (LDMM). Similar to other well known fusion 
methods [41], the LDMM integrates and compares the 
average sensors' measurements n against detection threshold 
τ.     
Detection probability, denoted by PD, is the probability 
that a target is correctly detected. Supposing that n sensors 
take part in the data fusion applied in the LDMM, detection 
probability is given by: 
 
PD = P(1
n ∑(L(di) + Ni
2) > τ)

Where Ni σ~N(0,1)

 and Xn  denote the distribution

probability of making a positive detection decision when no 
target is present. False alarm rate probability, denoted by PF, 
is given by:

Conditions Necessary for Visibility: Given two real 
numbers, 𝑎 ∈ (0,1)  and 𝑏 ∈ (0,1) . Visibility 
Point 
𝑉𝑖(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) can be defined as visible point if and only if  
𝑃𝐹(𝑉𝑖) ≤ 𝑎 and 𝑃𝐷(𝑉𝑖) ≥ 𝑏. 
 
We integrate our unique concept of probabilistic 
visibility into the velocity space. We transform the 
visibility's boundaries from location to velocity space. 
 
IV. 
VISIBILITY VELOCITY OBSTACLES (VVO) 
The visibility velocity obstacle represents the set of all 
velocities from a viewpoint, occluded with other objects in 
the environment. It essentially maps static and moving 
objects into the robot’s velocity space considering visibility 
boundaries.  
The VVO of an object with circular visibility boundary 
points such as the pedestrians case, PBP, that is moving at a 
constant velocity vb, is a cone in the velocity space at point 
A. In Fig. 7, the position space and velocity space of A are 
overlaid to illustrate the relationship between the two spaces. 
The VVO is generated by first constructing the Relative 
Velocity Cone (RVC) from A to the boundaries of the object, 
i.e., PBP, then translating RVC by vb. 
Each point in VVO represents a velocity vector that 
originates at A. Any velocity of A that penetrates VVO is a 
occluded velocity that based on the current situation, would 
result in a occlusion between A and the pedestrian at some 
future time. Fig. 7 shows two velocities of A: one that 
penetrates VVO, hence a occluded velocity, and one that 
does not. All velocities of A that are outside of VVO are 
visible from the current robot's position as the obstacle 
denotes as B, stays on its current course. The visibility 
velocity obstacle thus allows determining if a given velocity 
is occluded, and suggesting possible changes to this velocity 
for better visibility. If PBP is known to move along a curved 
trajectory or at varying speeds, it would be best represented 
by the nonlinear visibility velocity obstacle case discussed 
next.

The VVO consists of all velocities of A at t0 predicting 
visibility's boundaries related to obstacles at the environment 
at any time t>t0. Selecting a single velocity, va, at time t = t0 
outside the VVO, guarantees visibility to this specific 
obstacle at time t. It is constructed as a union of its temporal 
elements, VVO(t), which is the set of all absolute velocities 
of A, va, that would allow visibility at a specific time t. 
Referring to Fig. 8, va that would result in occlusion with 
point p in B at time t > t0, expressed in a frame centered at 
A(t0), is simply: 
va = VBPi
t − t0
 
                                              
where r is the vector to point p in the blocker’s fixed frame, 
and visibility boundaries denoted as Visibility Boundary 
Points (VBP). The set, VVO(t) of all absolute velocities of A 
that would result in occlusion with any point in B at time t > 
t0 is thus: 
 
VVO(t) = VBPi(t)
t − t0
 
                                        
 
Clearly, VVO(t) is a scaled B for two dimensional case 
with circular object, located at a distance from A that is 
inversely proportional to time t. The entire VVO is the union 
of its temporal subsets from t0, the current time, to some set 
future time horizon th: 
 
VVO(t) = ⋃
VBPi(t)
t − t0
th
t=t0
 
                                           
The presented VVO generate a warped cone in a case of 
2D circular object. If VBP(t) is bounded over t = (t0, ∞), 
then the apex of this cone is at A(t0).We extend our analysis 
to 3D general case, where the objects can be cubes, cylinders 
and circles. The mathematical analysis with visibility 
boundaries is based on VBP presented in the previous part 
for different kind of objects such as buildings, cars and 
pedestrians. 
 
We transform the visibility's boundaries into the velocity 
space, by moving the VBP to the velocity space, in the same 
analysis presented for 2D circle boundary's. 
Following that, we present 3D extension for VBP case, 
transformed to the velocity space. 
Given two objects, VBP1, VBP2 will create a VVO 
representing VBP2 (and vice-versa) such that VBP1 wishes 
to choose a guaranteed collision-free velocity for the time 
interval τ, and visibility boundary in velocity space.  
The Nonlinear Visibility Velocity Obstacle (NVVO) 
accounts for a general trajectory of the object, while 
assuming a constant velocity of the robot. It applies to the 
scenario shown in Fig. 8, where, at time t0 , a point A 
attempts to plan visible trajectory related an object, PBP, that 
is following a general known trajectory, c(t), and at time t0 is 
located at c(t0). PBP represents the set of points that define 
the geometry of the visibility boundaries of the object, grown 
by the radius of the robot. In case of pedestrians where PBP 
is a circle, then c(t) represents the trajectory followed by its 
center.

PURSUER PLANNER USING VVO  
Our planner, similar to previous work [45] is a local one, 
generating one step ahead every time step reaching toward 
the goal, which is a depth first A* search over a tree. We 
extend previous planners, which take into account kinematic 
and dynamic constraints [9][14] and present a local planner 
for UAV as case study with these constraints, which for the 
first time generates fast and exact visible trajectories based 
on VVO, tracking after a target by choosing the optimal 
next action based on velocity estimation.  
The fast and efficient visibility analysis of our method, 
allows us to generate the most visible trajectory from a start 
state
qstart
 to the goal state 
qgoal
in 3D urban environments, 
which can be extended to real performances in the future. 
We assume knowledge of the 3D urban environment model, 
and by using Visibility Velocity Obstacles (VVO) method 
to avoid occlusion, exploring maximum visible node in the 
next time step and track a specific target. 
At each time step, the planner computes the next eighth 
Attainable Velocities (AV), as detailed in the next sub-
section. The nodes, which are not occluded, i.e., nodes 
outside Visibility Velocity Obstacles, are explored. The 
planner computes the cost for these visible nodes and 
chooses the node with the optimal cost according to mission 
type. In our case, the optimal cost related to the node with 
minimum velocities difference between the robot and the 
tracked target. 
 
1) Attainable Velocities  
 
Based on the dynamic and kinematic constraints, UAVs 
velocities at the next time step are limited. At each time step 
during the trajectory planning, we map the AV, the 
velocities set at the next time step t
+
, which generate the 
optimal trajectory, as is well-known from Dubins theory 
[28]. 
We denote the allowable controls as 
(

We denote the set of dynamic constraints bounding 
control's rate of change as

Considering the extremal controllers as part of the 
motion primitives of the trajectory cannot ensure time-
optimal trajectory for Dubins airplane model [28], but is still 
a suitable heuristic based on time-optimal trajectories of 
Dubin - car and point mass models. 
We calculate the next time step's feasible velocities

, consist of the current UAVs position and

computes the set of AV, 
~
(
)
U t

, from the current UAV 
velocity,
( )
U t
, as shown in Fig. 10. We ensure the 
visibility of nodes by computing a set of Visibility Velocity 
Obstacles (VVO).  
In Fig. 10, nodes inside VVO, marked in red, are 
occluded. Nodes out of VVO are further evaluated; visible 
nodes are colored in blue. The safe node with the lowest 
cost, which is the next most visible node, is explored in the 
next time step. This is repeated while generating the most 
visible trajectory, as discussed in the next sub-section. 
Attainable velocities profile is similar to a trunked cake 
slice, as seen in Figure 10, due to the Dubins airplane model 
with one time step integration ahead. Simple models 
attainable velocities, such as point mass, create rectangular 
profile [4].     
 
3) Cost Function 
Our search is guided by minimum invisible parts from 
viewpoint V to the 3D urban environment model, with 
minimal difference between robot's velocity 𝑣𝑎 and tracked 
target 𝑣𝑡𝑐𝑘 .  
The cost function is computed for each visible 
node  (𝑞, 𝑞̇) ∋ 𝑉𝑉𝑂 , i.e., node outside VVO, considering 
UAV velocities at the next time step: 
  
𝑤(𝑞(𝑡 + 𝜏)) = 𝑎𝑏𝑠(𝑣𝑎(𝑞(𝑡 + 𝜏)
− 𝑣𝑡𝑐𝑘(𝑞(𝑡 + 𝜏))

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper proposes an online motion planning 
algorithm in 3D environments for tracking target, taking 
into account visibility analysis. The planner is based on 
local search and includes dynamic and kinematic constraints 
as complete part of the planner. Visibility boundaries, which 
are based on analytic solution for several kind of objects in 
3D urban environments, also include uncertainty and 
probabilistic factors. Each VVO represents velocity's set of 
possible future collision and visibility boundaries. Based on 
our analysis in velocity space, we plan our trajectory by 
selecting future robot's velocity at each time step, tracking 
after specific target considering visibility constraints as 
integral part of the velocities space. We formulate the 
tracked target in the environment and include visibility 
analysis for the next time step as part of our planning in the 
same search space.
