Abstract — The paper describes the governmental knowledge 
base constructed from Brazilian laws, the events that surround 
them and authorities responsible for these. The knowledge 
base is built on RDF (Resource Description Framework) 
language through the Brazilian Official Gazette, which is the 
access for official information. This knowledge base is linked 
to other Brazilian Open Data and being one more effort in 
Open Government Partnership [10] to reflect the country’s 
commitment to strengthen the transparency of government 
action, to prevent and combat corruption. The self-
management characteristic in the knowledge base was 
obtained through an architecture that monitors the laws status 
in all Brazilian Open Data Providers and highlights the 
inconsistencies in a period of time. This system is used by the 
Secretary of Federal Treasury and presents a well-founded 
basis for checking the accuracy and validity of the decrees in a 
Federal Budget domain.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In the context of Open Data [10], Brazil has been 
actively participating and the last news was a federal law 
recently launched for the purpose of free access of federal 
information by Brazilian citizens [2], taking into account 
that some information is fundamental to the safety and 
operation of government public companies. 
The main information source is the Federal Official 
Gazette, which is a PDF document and contains legislation, 
jurisprudence and administrative actions. Published by 
authority since 1808, the today’s Brazilian Gazette is the 
Brazilian Government’s Official Journal. It was set up to 
provide King Jonh with news while he and his court were in 
Brazil publishing Decree, Laws, Program and Internal 
Rules. With a new edition every day, today’s Brazilian 
Gazette contains a huge amount of information and 
statutory notices about decisions and changes in a local and 
national level. The Brazilian Gazette is a natural candidate 
for the government semantically enables the potential reuse 
of information. 
Our goal is making public sector’s information available 
in a way that enables and maximizes its reuse for citizens, 
consumers and government adding maximum value. 
Furthermore, we notice that due to the complexity of 
managing a large number of documents within an 
organization, a mechanism for automating the documents 
annotation task has become essential in order to facilitate 
the retrieval of information. 
Sacramento et al. [22] defines and relates ontology, 
knowledge base and data sources such as used within this 
research: 
 
(a) An ontology is a pair O=(V,S) such that 
(i) V is a finite alphabet, the vocabulary of O, 
whose atomic concepts and atomic roles are called the 
classes and properties of O, respectively, and 
(ii) S is a finite set of inclusions in V, constraints 
of O. 
(b) A knowledge base is a triple KB=(V,S,A) such that 
(i) (V,S) is an ontology, and 
(ii) A is a finite set of assertions in V. 
(c) A data source is a pair DS=(V,A) such that 
(i) V is a finite alphabet, and 
(ii) A is a finite set of assertions in V. 
 
Within this work, ontology, knowledge base and data 
sources are used with this caution. Similarly, RDF 
(Resource Description Framework) [7] is a triple subject-
property-object, usually described as P (S, O), where a 
13

given subject S has a property P that assumes the value O. 
Sacramento et al. [22] defines Linked Data as a set of best 
practices for publishing and connecting structured data on 
the Web [24]. From the user’s perspective, the main goal of 
Linked Data is the provision of integrated access to data 
from a wide range of distributed and heterogeneous data 
sources [25]. 
The linked data is achieved through interaction with 
other 
Brazilian 
open 
knowledge 
bases 
developed 
independently, making use of technology patterns according 
to [17].  
The self-management characteristic was incorporate in 
this work through an application that monitors the RDF 
(Resource Description Framework) triples and validates the 
integrating facts between several datasets. In this paper, 
self-management knowledge base is defined as a knowledge 
base that monitors and analyses the data linking between 
the data sources used to. 
The aims of this project are two fold: 
• 
Address the practical challenges of publishing 
public governmental information in a way that maximize its 
reuse and ensure valid and consistent information; 
• 
Give to Brazilian Gazette a new role, as a vehicle of 
semantically enabled official information, ensuring publicly 
available. 
II.  RELATED WORKS 
Our project is inserted in the Brazilian Initiative Linking 
Open Data for moving the Web from the idea of separated 
documents to wide information space of components easier 
to discover, more valuable and easier for people to reuse. 
In the context of semantic web, applications can help to 
produce value-added content by simply treating resources 
information unstructured. There is a need for readers to 
know where to get new and pertinent information and how 
to consume it. The RDF (Resource Description Framework) 
provides a common framework that allows data to be shared 
and reused across application, enterprise and community 
boundaries. Also, it provides a simple data formalism for 
talking about things, their properties, inter-relationships and 
categories.  
According to Berners-Lee [27], the raw data should be 
made available as soon as possible. Preferably, it should be 
put up as Linked Data. Also, it should be linked to other 
sources, which will allow any data communication to be 
composed of many mixed vocabularies.  
Joshi et al. [30] proposes to querying linked data by 
using alignments for processing queries, whose constituent 
data come from heterogeneous sources. They treat 
alignment between datasets using similarities of ontology 
instances. This similarity is calculated by names with 
natural language processing and, the ontologies and datasets 
used for. 
Heim et al. [29] define relationship discovery via the 
Semantic Web as a highly user-centered process. They 
identified 
semantic 
relation 
through 
user´s 
social 
bookmarks. 
DBPedia [28] is a typical case of a large Linked 
Dataset, which essentially, makes the content of Wikipedia 
[31] available in RDF (Resource Description Framework). 
The importance of DBPedia is not only that it includes 
Wikipedia data, but also that it incorporates links to other 
datasets, e.g., to Geonames [33]. Providing links in terms of 
RDF triples, a user might exploit the knowledge from other 
datasets when developing an application through of 
integrating facts from several datasets. 
Nevertheless, a large amount of unstructured textual 
information is supposed to be processed before annotating 
and validating information that are publicly available. Some 
definitions found in the literature define semantic 
annotation as a specific schema to create and use metadata, 
enabling new methods of access to information [12]. Eller 
[5] points out that the semantic annotation of documents 
describes its contents by the association of relevant 
resources through predicate, also described in the ontology. 
Eller [5] also developed a system for semantic annotation of 
documents related to lawsuits using the Smore tool with 
support of an ontology in RDF (Resource Description 
Framework) to facilitate the process of semantic annotation 
of documents for specific areas. 
Many services available on the Internet offer generation 
of semantic information from textual information. We can 
highlight OpenCalais [15], Zemanta [16], Ontos [11] and 
TextWise [14]. All these are characterized by enrichment of 
web pages content with hints (notes) from knowledge bases 
as DBpedia, GeoNames, IMDB [34] and Musibrainz [35]. 
OpenCalais [15] is a service provided by Reuters [13], 
through which it is possible to create semantic content from 
unstructured source text. The OpenCalais performs natural 
language processing (English and French) and also use 
machine learning techniques to define entities in the text. 
The entities are divided into three categories: 
• 
Named entities - people, companies, organizations, 
books, albums, authors, geographic entities; 
• 
Facts - categorized by position, political events, etc; 
• 
Events - sports, change of command, etc; 
 
According to [15], using these information it is possible 
to build maps (or graphs or networks) linking documents to 
people, companies, places, and various other entities. 
OpenCalais uses the microformat language [6] to express its 
annotations.  
Since API proposed by Zemanta [16] provides 
functionality for generating semantic information from not 
semantics textual information, Zemanta Service Web 
returns a set of information (annotations) associated with 
the text submit for it, such as photos, magazine articles and 
links from Wikipedia articles, each corresponding to a 
resource in DBpedia ontology. 
Brazilian LexML Project [19] aims to unify, organize 
and facilitate the access to legislative and legal information 
made available in digital form by all authorities of 
Executive, Legislative and Judiciary at the federal, state and 
municipal levels.

This project produce a controlled vocabulary that plays 
a key role for organization of legislative and legal 
information, allowing the integration of this vocabularies 
used by different governament houses. For example, the 
user may inform the prefix "urn:lex:br:lei" in the URN 
(Uniform Resource Name) of Supreme Court judgment. 
Thus, "urn:lex:br:federal:lei:2008-06-19;11705" is the 
standard name for the law nº11705 and internationally 
recognized unambiguously, which ensure a single URN for 
each piece of legislation. However, one of the major 
challenges for the legal domain is the retroactivity principle 
of the law to meet current regulations. 
The vocabularies published by LexML use the W3C 
SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) format 
[20] and organize the legislative and legal information, 
allowing, among other things, conducting process patterns 
of URN (Uniform Resource Name) and the integration of 
vocabularies used by different Houses. The Document Type 
Vocabulary available in (LexML 2011) was used in this 
work. However, another limitation of this project is the 
absence of Linked Data, for example, when a law cites 
another law, without use the identifier of this law. What 
results in nonexistence of Linked Data, not allow the 
complete reuse. 
III. 
SIOP-LEGIS 
SIOP-LEGIS is a Knowledge Organizational System 
that mines Brazilian Official Gazette daily generating 
metadata for each document related to Federal Treasury 
domain. 
Nowadays, SIOP-LEGIS repository 
has 
a 
collection of more than 80.000 indexed documents since 
2008 and that number increases daily [32]. The goal of 
SIOP-LEGIS system is to use the most accurate official 
document set wherever possible to aggregate and interlink 
document that refer to the same resource (Decree, Laws, 
Program and Internal Rules). Thus, there is a clear need of 
applying temporal database concepts to RDF (Resource 
Description Framework) to allow metadata navigation 
across time. 
Initially, a mining module was proposed to automate the 
indexing process of documents found in Federal Official 
Gazette that is a PDF document, which contains a domain 
documents set considered relevant [32]. As shown in Figure 
1, despite being a PDF, there is no publicly available 
metadata or text format from the government press, which 
makes more difficult to automatically process of reading 
and indexing the Official Gazette. The technological 
challenge was to create a mining algorithm that is not tied 
to the current layout of the Gazette and not being vulnerable 
to small changes in the style of the Gazette, which is an 
unlikely situation. 
 
Figure 1. Process of conversion, mining and identification of documents 
in Federal Official Gazette 
 
For each domain document identified, a metadata is 
automatically created as shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2. Metadata created automatically (in Portuguese language) for 
each domain document identified through Dublin Core metadata terms 
[26] 
 
The mining module was created with the purpose of an 
API making the whole process transparent to the user, 
taking as input the Federal Official Gazette (in PDF format) 
and the RDF (Resource Description Framework) model that 
specify the structure of Official Gazette. After, the output is 
the documents list with their metadata. The Figure 3 
summarizes the internal process of mining the Official 
Gazette. 
Importantly, the Official Gazette has its text printed in 
several columns or combination of one, two to three 
columns.  
A. Knowledge representation with RDF ontologies 
Our proposal follows the LAG (List of Government 
Affairs) [9], whose approach is embedded in the e-Ping 
architecture - Standards of Interoperability for Electronic 
Government, whose the goal is to define a minimum set of 
assumptions, policies and specifications that regulate the 
use of Information Technology in the Brazilian government 
15

domain, establishing the conditions of interaction between 
federal houses and the society. 
B. Resource Recognition 
Resources are types of documents found in Official 
Gazette and already mapped by the Senate through the 
LexML project [19] within a controlled vocabulary: 
Decree, Laws, Program and Internal Rules.  
The interested resource recognition occurs as drawn on 
Figure 4, when a resource is crawled on text and its unique 
identifier is recovered in the third-part LEXML knowledge 
base as shown in Figure 3, where we can see the URN 
present in the metadata of a law published by the 
government.  
 
 
Figure 3. A result search for the law 'Lei nº6.969', which has an 
unique identifier 'urn:lex:br:federal:lei:1981-12-10-6969'. 
 
 
Figure 4. Government action (‘revogada’, in Portuguese language) 
identified between two resources: ‘Portaria Nº374’ repeal ‘Portaria Nº62’. 
 
The law cited in the Gazette is mapped in LEXML 
project to consolidate the Linked Open Data. Right now, 
the resource has a unique identity URN. 
C. Event Recognition 
The events between resources are present in the 
government acts that change the documents status over 
time: publication, grinding, re-publication, repeal and 
amendment. Thus, our goal was to process each document 
and find each governmental act between two resources and 
represents 
them 
on 
RDF 
(Resource 
Description 
Framework) language [7] to allow, among other things, 
control the events time. 
 
 
TABLE 1. EVENTS MODELED BY THE PROPOSED PROCESS 
 
 
Table 1 presents the events currently recognized and 
modeled with their respective unique identifiers. As shown 
in Figure 4, the events are identified between two resources, 
thus creating the RDF (Resource Description Framework) 
triple with the document date. This date will control the 
chronological order to know the resource status during its 
cycle life. 
D. Authorities Recognition  
The proposed governmental knowledge base is also 
monitoring the signing date, authority and role authority. 
Through the signing date, the chronological order of decree 
transformations over time is constructed. 
 
 
Figure 5. Shows the Brazilian authorities found in one Brazilian 
Official Gazette  
 
With recognition is possible to identify the authority 
responsible for the promulgation of a decree. These 
authorities are in the third-party knowledge base maintend 
by the Planning Ministry, whose are reponsible for make 
this information public.  
Figure 5 illustrates a document processing of Brazilian 
authorities identified. An exemple, Court of Auditors 
(Tribunal de Contas, in Portuguese). We can see three 
situations: the authority recognized successfully ‘
’, the 
authorities recognized with some difference in spelling 
‘
’ and; possible authority, but not recognized by the 
base ‘
’. 
E. Named Entities Recognition 
Our governmental knowledge base performs the named 
entity recognition (NER) from other Brazilian open data. A 
major limitation here is this third-party dataset do not 
adopted open standard RDF (Resource Description 
Framework) technology. Even though this limitation, we are 
16

ICDS 2013 : The Seventh International Conference on Digital Society

motivated to computationally solve it in order to go forward 
in our project.  
The solution thanks the Brazilian law that obliged all 
authorities of Executive, Legislative and Judiciary at the 
federal, state and municipal levels become available public 
servants with their occupation and function. From this 
information source, we have developed an algorithm to 
extract the names and performed the recognition of named 
entity on the Corpus. 
 
 
Figure 6. An example of third-party official document with possible 
entities that can sign official decree. 
 
Then, the official document issued by the Ministry, as 
Figure 6, is processed and used as input for the named 
entities recognition. In Figure 6, we have two employees 
with the Unique Personal Identifier (CPF, in Portuguese), 
Employee Name (Nome do servidor, in Portuguese) and 
their actual workplace (Órgão, in Portuguese), which are 
treated as authorities in this paper. 
IV. 
CASE STUDY 
Nowadays, our project is used by Federal Budget 
Secretary in order to audit federal publications within the 
domain of Federal Budget. The strength of the approach is 
the ability to audit documents through a user friendly 
interface that allows users to search for documents related 
to one of the available parameters as shows in the Figure 7: 
• 
Authority (Autoridade, in Portuguese): grace the 
named entity identified in the processing; 
• 
Date Signature (Data de Assinatura, in Portuguese) 
and Publication Date (Data de Publicação, in Portuguese) 
that used concomitantly with Revoked field (Revogado, in 
Portuguese) to identify the status of a Document Type on a 
specific period of time. 
 
 
Figure 7. A user friendly interface that allows users to search for 
documents related to one of the available parameters 
 
The processing result can be viewed in the search 
performed by the graphic user interface for documents or 
government actions available to the citizens in Portuguese 
language. Figure 8 shows a search result with RDF 
(Resource Description Framework) link and the URN of 
each document highlighted in red, listing with the 
differential:  
• 
Shows the URN of each document, as present in 
this paper;  
• 
Shows the possibility of export the RDF document 
representation, which allows a future automatic processing 
of documents returned in the search. 
 
 
Figure 8. Search result with RDF link and the URN of each document 
highlighted in red 
 
In Figure 9, we can see the RDF document that brings 
temporal processing of a federal document. From this point 
is possible to know the document status in a given 
month/year and the changes ocurrs so far. The temporal 
question is addressed by the knowledge base with 
information about each interesting event of selected 
document (resource).

Figure 9. RDF representation of the government act with the use of 
controlled vocabularies 
 
The weakness remains the effective natural language 
processing to identify named entity of interest. Figure 10 
shows the needed association between person's name (Jose 
Guilherme Tollstadius Leal, in Portuguese) with his title (in 
Portuguese, Secretario Substituto de Defesa Agrope…), 
which requires a high precision and recall. 
 
 
Figure 10. The desirable association between person's name 
(JOSÉ...LEAL , in Portuguese) with his title (in Portuguese, 
SECRETÁRIO...ABASTECIMENTO)  
 
We could have this information in a relational database, 
but the goal here is the open access to government 
governamental linked knowledge base in a reuse form and 
understandable 
way. 
Besides 
creating 
the 
base 
interconnected with other databases that follow the open 
Brazilian international standard defined by [21]. 
V.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 The SIOP project [32] is part of Presidency initiative 
and Federal Budget Secretary for information provision for 
society. In addition to providing linked and interoperable 
open knowledge base, the proposal allows the development 
of tools to read the data provided by own government. 
Note that this need arose for approval of government's 
public accounts. Moreover, there is a whole temporal 
control that lets us flag automatically when a rule is valid 
before causing inconsistency in the knowledge base. 
The link between resources and third-party LEXML 
base, as well as government actions were done without 
problems because they are defined in a controlled 
vocabulary with a federal initiative. The big problem that 
remains is the named people recognition in the document. 
Despite being included as a future work, the first 
experiments showed an accuracy and recall of 64% and 
61% respectively, which is still a unsatisfactory desire for 
the project. 
Initially, we are working on fully automated process of 
documents selection in a domain of interest through the 
creation of rules that contain the terms of a domain 
ontology. The goal is to extend the application to other 
domains that has interest in other documents that would be 
selected automatically for processing. 
Another work in parallel is to verify the person 
responsible for the decree, validating his authority for 
decree's promulgation in a period of time. The goal is to 
find inconsistencies in the knowledge base and indicates 
them for the domain specialist. With this,  self-management 
characteristic will be added to the knowledge base. 
Another ongoing future work is the creation of a unique 
identifier for authorities and people identified through 
recognition. However, this are suppose be provided by 
third-party governmental institution responsible for this 
information, with already happening with the project that 
provides a LEXML identifier to government actions 
promulgated, for example, the identifier ‘urn: lex: br : 
ministerio.planejamento.orcamento.gestao: decree :2010-
04-28, 777 ' for ‘Decree No. 7778 of 04/28/2012’, as 
Figure 7. The current recommended best practice for RDF 
identifiers is to distinguish between resource identifiers and 
document URLs. Resource identifiers are used as identifiers 
within RDF graphs, while document URLs are used on the 
web to retrieve documents [7]. 
Finally, a next work is become our Linked Open 
Government Knowledge Base available in web-service 
access to meet the information with capable of inference.
