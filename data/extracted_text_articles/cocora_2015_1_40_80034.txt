Abstract - The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide 
service use and is used as a reference for many other time base 
systems, altitude, latitude and longitude. Intentional jammers 
(jammers) have degraded the reception of GPS signals, causing 
the receivers to fall out of sync. The technique employed in 
Independent Components Analysis (ICA) provides the ability to 
separate and mitigate the interference (jamming). A Software-
Defined Radio (SDR) was used to confirm the effectiveness of 
this technique against jamming. 
Keywords - GPS; jammers; ICA; jamming; SDR. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is one of the most 
used 
telecommunications 
systems, 
used 
in 
various 
applications like online mapping, car tracking, traffic control, 
etc. [1]. To avoid the localization of a target by GPS, some 
portable devices were developed to interfere with localization 
signal reception.  
The received GPS signal normally has a low power, i.e.,   
-160 dBm, with approximately 20 MHz of bandwidth. Thus, 
a jammer device, that produces the interference signal in the 
same frequency bands with the GPS signal, can interrupt the 
signal reception for kilometers [2]. The utilization of these 
devices are forbidden, but they can be easily acquired in the 
market [3]. 
Some techniques have been developed to combat the 
jammers as adaptive filtering [4][5], filtering in the time - 
frequency domain [6][7], adaptive antennas [8][9], among 
others. In this paper, we propose the utilization a blind source 
separation technique Independent Component Analysis (ICA) 
to separate the GPS signal from the interference. ICA has an 
efficient implementation and good performance in the low 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) situations, as is the case of GPS 
signals.  
We used real measurement signal to validate the proposed 
utilization and the obtained results shows the efficiency of 
ICA in the GPS signal recovery.  
This article is arranged as follows: Section II presents the 
software-defined radio, in Section III is a brief description of 
the method of analysis in independent components (ICA). 
Section IV presents the used software-defined radio. The 
application of the method proposed in the situation is defined 
in Section V. Finally, the results and conclusions are in 
Section VI. 
II. 
SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO 
The Software-Defined Radio (SDR) is designed as a 
reconfigurable and flexible arrangement of radio that is based 
on a software [16]. Thus, it provides the possibility of 
implementing several radio configurations, only by changing 
software parameters, taking advantage of the same hardware 
structure. Moreover, thanks to the high processing power of 
the platform, one can use a more elaborate signal processing 
with real-time radio systems in a fast development 
environment of use applications. 
GNU Radio is a free software platform and open source 
used in the development of hardware without radios in a 
simulation environment, or with an external RF hardware 
cost. There are pre-defined blocks in an internal library or 
created by the user, which operate independently and, when 
connected, form software-defined radios. 
The Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) [17] is 
an RF device consisting of a motherboard and a set of plates 
daughters. On-board analog-to-digital converters are in the 
reception area (path from the antenna to the processing 
system), digital to analog converters in the transmission zone 
(path processing system to the antenna) and an FPGA to 
multiplex data the daughter card from reception to the 
computer and vice versa. 
Each daughter card is designed for a range of frequencies 
and, in a typical configuration, are arranged into four units: 
two for transmission and two for reception. 
III. 
INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS 
The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [10] is a 
blind source separation method, where the base on the linear 
mixture of signal sources, the objective is to recover a 
statistically independent and non Gaussian representation of 
each source.  
Consider

independent 
sources 
(𝑠1, 𝑠2, 𝑠3, … , 𝑠𝑛)and 𝑚 measurements of mixture of these 
sources, (𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3, … , 𝑥𝑛), written as a linear combination of 
the sources by

The first step for the application of ICA is to choose a cost 
function. After, an optimization method to optimize the cost 
functions must be chosen. In this work, we use an efficient 
method to perform these tasks, the FastICA [18], which is 
based on maximizing nengetropia [10], using as cost function 
the nonlinear function:

and symmetrical orthogonalization.

SOFTWARE-DEFINED RADIO USED 
For the verification of the application of ICA result to 
separate the GPS signal jamming, a software-defined radio 
was used, GNSS-SDR, proposed in [19]. This radio 
implements 
an 
algorithm 
for 
the 
acquisition 
and 
demodulation of the signal and another location algorithm, 
based on information derived from the first.

V. 
APPLICATION OF THE METHOD IN PROPOSED CASE 
To demonstrate the application of the proposed method 
used a GPS signal from the Crawdad database [11], 
represented in Figure 3. This signal has central frequency of 
1575.42 MHz, sampling rate of 6.4 GHz, span of 5 MHz and 
320000 samples were registered. It was acquired using a 
Tektronix RSA3408A real time spectrum analyzer, a Rojone 
A-GPSA95NS antenna, Rojone AMA-061B amplifier and a 
DC blocker.

As interference signal was used a chirp signal signal, 
generate using Matlab®, shown in Figure 4. This signal has a 
central frequency of 1575.42 MHz (GPS L1 Band), initial 
frequency (𝑓0)  in 1570.42 MHz, final frequency (𝑓1)  in 
1580.42 MHz and a quasi static sweeping mode, whose 
instantaneous frequency is given by

𝑓𝑖(𝑡) = 𝑓0 + (𝑓1 − 𝑓0)𝑡2

according to signals emitted by GPS jammers [12][13].

FastICA [18] was the algorithm used to separate the 
mixture of the GPS and Chirp signal. According to [14] and 
[15],  ICA has some restrictions, and one of them is the signal 
sources have non Gaussian distribution. When the sources are 
Gaussian there is no guarantee of source recovery. GPS 
signal has probability distribution near of Gaussian (2.971 
kurtosis).  
However, when we apply the FastICA to some mixture of 
GPS signals, the sources were recovered. As ICA does not 
guarantee prefect recovery of phase, or order of the recovered 
signal, as shown in [14] and [15], we used the cross

and recovered signals. 
When compared  by correlation, the original GPS signal 
and the first recovered component, shown in Figure 5, the 
obtained correlation -0.0067.

The results shown in Figures 5 and 6 indicate the similarity 
between recovered signals. In the comparison between the 
original GPS signal and the second recovered component, 
presented in Figure 7, the correlation coefficient is 0.9987.

In Figure 8, the comparison of original chirp signal and

has great similarity.

As GPS signals has its data modulated by C/A code (a 
PRN-Code broadcast at 1.023MHz which spreading the data 
over a 2MHz bandwidth), which in turn modulates the L1 
carrier (1575,42 MHz) using Binary-Phase-Shift-Keying 
(BPSK), the original GPS signal (Figure 9), the mixture of 
the GPS signal and signal interference (Figure 10) and the 
recovered GPS signal (Figure 11) were demodulated.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION 
Since FastICA does not guarantee that the original signals 
are recovered in the same order, we made four comparisons 
between the original signals and the signals recovered to 
detect which pairs of signals corresponded. In this test, it was 
found that the original GPS signal had a low correlation (-
0.0067) with the first independent component and a high 
correlation (0.9987) to the second one. This indicates that the 
second independent component of the GPS signal is recovered 
with the same phase. 
Then, it was discovered that the original chirp signal had 
high correlation with the first independent component (-
0.9998) and low correlation with the second (-0.0049). This 
indicates that the first independent component represents the 
chirp signal recovered with reversed phase. 
To confirm the first conclusion, a second test was done. 
The test compared three GPS signals between them: the 
original, the original mixed with interference and the 
recovered. The correlation between the original and blended 
signals, and between the mixed with the recovered was low 
(0.0501 and 0.0434, respectively). This indicates that the 
compared signals have no similarity. In the confrontation 
between the original and recovered signals, a high coefficient 
of correlation was achieved (0.9935), indicating that the 
signals tested have great similarity. 
In this case, it is concluded that the chirp signal actually 
represented an interference to the GPS signal, as the signal 
was demodulated when mixed, did not correlate with either 
the original signal as the recovered signal. Another 
conclusion, and the most important, is that the analysis in 
independent component (ICA) was really a tool capable of 
separating interference (chirp signal) of the desired signal 
(GPS), since the comparison between the original and GPS 
signals recovered by ICA, could become a very high 
similarity. 
Finally, as obtained by the RDS-GNSS position 
coordinates corresponding to the original GPS signals, mixed 
and recovered, has the following output: the difference 
between the original coordinates of the extracted GPS signal, 
and the retrieved signal was only 68 meters, as shown in 
Figure 12. While the GPS signal mixed with the chirp 
interference will not return any coordinate point indicating 
that there was actually a loss of synchronization with the GPS 
satellites, if the jamming still present.

point (B). 
 
This work was the result of the first research on the topic 
in question. In the future, it will continue to be developed, so 
that consideration be other mitigating interference in GPS 
signals, such as the multi-jamming and other waveforms.
