Abstract— Nowadays, websites are considered to be responsive 
as a matter of course. Relatable literature focuses on the 
technical implementation of the associated changes and rarely 
addresses the potential negative usability implications. 
Therefore, this article addresses user expectations concerning 
the presentation of a website on different devices. A series of 
experiments focusing on selected visual and functional aspects 
of a website requiring adaptation is presented for this purpose 
and their findings are discussed. 
Keywords-RWD; responsive; webdesign; mental model; user 
tests; usability; user experience; first-click-test. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Responsive Web Design (RWD) can enhance user 
experience significantly – but it can also be detrimental. If a 
user knows the presentation of a website from a particular 
presentation environment, then modifying that website to a 
different presentation environment may cause, for instance, a 
loss of orientation [1][2]. A standardized realization of 
responsive behavior could counter such effects to some 
extent. However, responsive behavior may strongly depend 
on application context and device-specific constraints, and 
thus be highly diverse. This might explain why standards 
such as DIN EN ISO1 9241-151 recommend to consider 
contextual aspects for user interface design, but provide few 
hints regarding the realization of responsive behavior. 
Platform-specific user interface guidelines (e.g., [3]) fill this 
gap to some extent, but cannot necessarily be applied to 
manufacturer-independent scenarios. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
addresses related work. Section III deals with the performed 
usability tests in context of this article. The results and goals 
of these tests are discussed in Section IV. 
II. 
RELATED WORK  
Human expectations (or behavioral patterns) relate to so-
called “mental models”, a central concept of human-
computer interaction [4]. Such models assume that humans 
compile personal experiences into abstract models, which are 
then used to predict real-world behavior. Based on the stored 
knowledge a quick interpretation and reaction to external and 
internal events is possible [5]. Therefore, a presentation and 
interaction model of a website, which is close to the user’s 
mental model of that site, can support understanding and 
operation [6][7] and may contribute to an anticipatory design 
process [33].  
Acquiring a mental model can be challenging. People do 
not have access to their entire belief structure. Consequently, 
they have no direct conscious access to the mental model 
they have constructed from previous experiences. Thus, an 
interview may result in an incomplete or wrong model [8]. 
Therefore, hints concerning users’ mental model of a 
responsive web page’s behavior must be acquired in a 
different way. To some extent, this is addressed by studies 
investigating the usability of responsive webpages (e.g., a 
webpage for a conference [31] or the tourism domain [32]). 
In order to continue such efforts for a wider application 
focus, the work presented in the following combines research 
concerning current trends in responsive behavior with 
experiments in a given application (a web page concerned 
with job offers) and results from cognitive science. 
III. 
EXPERIMENTS 
The following experiments share the primary goal of 
improving the understanding of today’s users’ mental model 
of responsive web pages. Derived goals include insights to 
the relevance of device-specific features for the mental 
model and people’s understanding of responsive behavior.

A. Preparation  
A preparatory study targeted user expectation concerning 
responsive behavior, which are likely due to the widespread 
adoption of responsive design. Based on the 30 most visited 
websites in Germany (category: online shops and news sites) 
[9][10][12], an analysis on the visualization of websites on 
different devices was conducted. Its focus was on position 
and presentation of the main menu. In summary, this analysis 
indicates a wide adoption of changeable menus. In desktop 
format, 80% of the menus are positioned in the upper area, 
12

followed by positioning on the left with 40%. The smaller 
the device, the more this distribution changes. On 
smartphones, for example, 63% of the menus are positioned 
on the left. On small displays, 90% of the menus are 
displayed in form of a hamburger icon. The format of the 
menu usually stays consistent and is not affected by how the 
device is held in vertical or horizontal format. 
 
B. Survey 
 
To get a basic understanding of users themselves in the 
context of RWD, a survey conducted via an online form was 
performed (see Table 1, column “Survey”). 
   
1) General web user capabilities 
All subjects stated they are competent in the German and 
83% also in the English language. The older the participants 
are, the more their ability to understand English terms 
decreases. After the age 45, the English skills drops from 
96% to 58%. To ensure users understand website texts, 
English expressions should be avoided as the age of the 
target group increases. 
Next, the participants were asked, which devices they 
have that can that enable website access. 97% said they own 
a smartphone, followed by a laptop with 79% a tablet with 
64% and desktop computer with 43%. The survey also 
revealed that older subjects are more likely to own a tablet 
device than a laptop. They also prefer to use a combination 
of tablet and smartphone, while the younger generation tends 
to use a smartphone and laptop. The older subjects’ 
preference could be explained with the more intuitive 
human-computer interaction of the tablet compared to 
desktop computers. Especially for people with special needs, 
such as a limited field of vision, this is attractive. This 
includes, among others, the older generation [11]. 
With regard to the operation of the various devices, the 
majority of users rated themselves as confident to very 
confident (e.g., 81% in operating mobile devices). Older test 
persons tended to give a poorer estimate of neutral to 
confident. This can probably be attributed to the time spent 
using websites. While the younger participants stated that 
they spent an average of two to four hours a day on websites, 
the older generation spent just under one hour. In addition, 
the fundamental experience with the digital world plays a 
role here (digital immigrants) [13]. 
2) Web user expectations 
This test showed that good usability and uncomplicated 
navigation were particularly important website features to all 
participants. Furthermore, it showed that a fast-loading time 
is especially relevant for younger test persons. Whereas for 
older participants it is uncomplicated navigation.  
Based on the laptop representation of a website, 
participants were asked to choose one of three given mobile 
variants (see Figure 1). Variant 2 in Figure 1 is visually most 
similar to the initial device, but to match the desktop look, 
the text was shortened. The test persons are therefore mostly 
unaware that a change has been made, because only variant 1 
is unchanged. The majority of the participants chose variant 
3, in which changes were made to both the content and the 
layout. It is assumed this decision is made based on 
experience (mental model) [14]. 
 
3) Comprehension for adaptive behavior 
In general, most participants indicated an understanding 
of website visual customization. When it comes to changes 
in function, the results are different. Here, more than half of 
all subjects had no understanding for adjustments. 
Nevertheless, only 21% said that an understanding of 
website customization is very important to them. In contrast, 
74% stated that reaching their goal for visit the site quickly, 
was very important to them. This suggests that the 
scrutability of a website customization is irrelevant to the 
participants if it helps them reach their destination faster. 
C. Preference test 
A preference test in form of an interview was realized 
[15]. Since a small number of respondents was expected, an 
even distribution of age groups was chosen for the test 
persons (see Table 1, column “Preference-Test”).  
1) Visualizing web users mental model  
Based on a printed screenshot of the desktop version of the 
start page of Hochschuljobbörse [16], participants were 
asked to outline its tablet and smartphone version. Figure 2 
shows sketches of two participants. These sketches reveal 
that younger test persons are aware of the entire website. The 
respondents only adapted the content to the width of the 
device without changing the data itself. For display on a 
smartphone, 
expectations 
differed. 
Some 
participants 
expected an identical presentation on the smartphone as well 
as on the tablet (see Figure 2 (a)). Other respondents changed 
     V A R I A N T  1                 V A R I A N T  2                 V A R I A N T  3

the layout of the website and adapted the content to the 
compressed display size. Although all test persons received 
the same instruction, some participants only focused on 
sketching the big image. The test showed that this behavior 
only occurs among older test persons.  
This observation may relate to human brain evolution. 
An impact on the executive function can be expected with 
increasing age. Part of this is the control of attention, which 
is used to perceive external stimuli. Some stimuli are noticed 
instinctively; others require awareness and attention [17]. 
Due to these findings, we assume that the triggered 
stimulus of the image might be too strong for older 
participants. As a result, they were less aware of the other 
web elements shown. Beyond, these observations suggest 
that a single mental model can hardly represent the 
expectations of all age groups. 
2) Expectations on content and layout 
The participants were presented the desktop version of a 
dummy website and had to choose one of two given mobile 
versions. 65% favored a customized version with shortened 
text, cropped images, and the menu as a hamburger icon. The 
older the respondent was, the stronger the preference was for 
the unchanged version.  
Furthermore, 95% of users want access to all content, 
regardless of what device is used. If this is not realizable 
(e.g., small display) the participants preferred additional 
pages over reduction. An opposite result was obtained for the 
adaption of the layout. When switching the device position, 
35% of the respondents prefer an unchanged layout.  These 
participants called the reason for “being used to” this. Due to 
a changed device orientation, the website layout is not 
adjusted here either. In this Case, 65% preferred a change in 
the data layout for an improved overview.  
Additionally, the participants were asked about the 
presentation of texts and images on different display sizes. 
Their responses indicated that they were generally unwilling 
to read texts on digital devices. For images, the relevant 
elements 
depicted 
should 
be 
easily 
recognizable. 
Furthermore, a good overview of the site content should also 
be guaranteed. Beyond, the larger the screen area the more 
images and text should be displayed. However, one test 
participant reported that he prefers reading text on large 
surfaces – but uses a smartphone for reading in the first 
place. The readiness of mobile devices might explain such 
contradictive behavior [18].  
3) Mouseover effects 
Mouseover effects can be used to highlight interactive 
elements. Most of the test persons perceive these effects as 
positive. Mouseovers also frequently display tooltips. This 
additional data cannot be activated on devices without mouse 
input. As mentioned before, web users want access to the 
same information no matter which device they use. By 
applying tooltips, this is not given. In summary, the use of 
this additional information should be applied wisely, or an 
alternative presentation should be considered for other input 
techniques.  
4) Device orientation 
Asked for their preferred device orientation of mobile 
devices, 90% answered they mostly use their smartphone 
vertically. Also among the six typical cell phone holding 
positions, the phone is only horizontal in one [19]. In 
contrast to the smartphone, the participants in this 
preference-test preferred to operate the tablet primarily 
horizontally. Explained can this by the similarity to the 
desktop presentation. Some Internet users already use the 
tablet as a laptop replacement. With the help of magnetic 
keyboards, the tablet can be quickly converted into a mini 
laptop at any time [20]. 
5) Expectations on menu 
According to the test participants, there should be an 
everlasting access to the menu. However, for smaller display 
areas, menu fixation can be counterproductive. Often the 
browser buttons require a lot of screen space. Sticking the 
website menu in place reduce the area for displaying the 
content, this way interactions may become harder to perform. 
For example, scrolling requires a certain space to perform the 
desired gesture. If this area is small, this can become difficult 
[21]. Taken together, this suggests avoiding fixation of 
menus on small displays.  
In addition, the participants were asked to evaluate 
navigation elements that can appear and disappear compared 
to a permanent presentation. With large display areas, all 
participants favor the permanent version. On devices with 
small display, a collapsed menu variant is preferred. In 
relation to a changed device orientation, the menu display 
should remain constant in the opinion of the users, especially 
older participants. Younger users prefer a changed menu 
presentation, when all menu items can be shown directly.  
Furthermore, instead of overwriting menu items, the 
respondents preferred an extension with sub items. They 
explained this with the possibility to compare menu options. 
Jumping back and forth between different subpages will also 
be avoided. Only two users disagree to the addition of menu 
sub items. They stated an overload resulting from the choice 
of elements. This phenomenon is called Paradox of Choice. 
Paradox since a larger selection is intuitively regarded as 
positive. In practice, however, too many options can be 
considered difficult or frustrating [22][23]. 
6) Thumb zone 
Subsequently, the participants should define the menu 
placement they expect on different devices (out of 6 
predefined menu positions). For the laptop and tablet 
(vertical and horizontal), the menu in the upper area received 
most votes, followed by the arrangement left. Similarly, most 
smartphone users prefer the menu at the top and left. A few 
expected the arrangement at the bottom of the screen. One of 
the respondents justified this decision with the phone’s 
handling. He unconsciously refers to the so-called thumb 
zone. The thumb performs most phone interactions. As a 
result, only one third of the screen, the so-called "thumb 
zone", can be reached effortlessly. For frequently used 
interaction elements (which are not limited to menus [21]), it 
14

is therefore recommended to place them within reach. For 
smartphones, this means at the bottom of the page.  
In summary, from an ergonomic point of view, placing a 
menu at the bottom can lead to an improvement in usability. 
This additionally makes clear, that the mental model alone 
does not increase the usability of a website.  
D. First-click-test 
As the name suggests, a first-click test analyzes the users’ 
first click on a user interface [24]. The probability of 
successfully completing a task on a website is twice as high 
if the first click was correct [25]. The first-click-test of this 
article (see Table 1, column “First-Click-Test”) was set up in 
the form of the A/B-test concept [26].  
For Original Version A and adapted Version B, the web 
presentation of the Hochschuljobbörse was used again. In the 
context of this article, the focus lies not only on the correct 
click but also on the time needed for it. Consequently, it can 
be identified how far the composition of the website 
corresponds to the mental model of the test person.  
 
 
        Figure 3. Horizontal (a) and vertical (b) smartphone version of the job 
search subpage. 
 
1) Right amount of information 
Different results between the test versions can already be 
seen in the first task. The respondents in the original version 
A found the menu 5 seconds faster on average than the 
respondents in version B. Due the compression in Version B, 
more elements are visible on one display area. As a result, 
the viewer may be flooded with information, which 
influences the information processing.  
With increasing information input, the performance of 
human information processing increases linearly up to a 
threshold value. Above this threshold, however, performance 
degrades dramatically [27]. 
Consequently, more information input does not always 
have a positive effect for the viewer. However, avoiding 
information overload should not result in too less displayed 
information. These negative effects can be shown by looking 
at the results of the mobile representations.  
In the horizontal position (see Figure 3 (a) right), the 
layout of the page has not been adapted to the changed 
device position, instead it has simply been scaled. The 
header image is enlarged to such an extent that the user can 
hardly recognize any further information. Consequently, the 
user lacks an overview of the site. In the modified version B, 
the layout was changed to fit the new device position (see 
Figure 3 (b)). As a result, nearly the same number of 
elements are displayed in both orientations. Thus, the sum of 
the information to be processed does not change or only 
minimally for the viewer. Due to this, respondents in test 
version B find the searched element three times faster than 
participants in group A. 
 
2) Webpage length 
As can be seen in Figure 3 (a), the page length is 
minimized 
by 
adjusting 
the 
layout. 
Consequently, 
participants had to perform fewer interactions to retrieve the 
desired data. This may also be a cause for the quick finding 
of the searched element. However, shortening the page 
length does not generally improve the user experience. For 
example, hiding content in order to reduce page load time 
[28] may shorten a webpage. A first-click test showed that 
participants needed 13 seconds longer to find a partially 
hidden section. This time loss is high when compared to the 
desired performance improvement [28]. Collapsing small 
elements should therefore be avoided. 
 
3) Orientation and recognition 
If the user can process the information presented more 
quickly, he or she will also orientate faster on the website 
[27]. The test also showed that the users’ orientation can be 
guided with the help of highlighted elements. By 
highlighting, users found the desired element 5 times faster. 
Additionally, a familiar presentation of interactive 
elements allows the user to recognize these faster. If a click 
is not followed by the expected action, a user may get 
frustrated. This effect can be reduced by following web 
design conventions. For example, buttons should be designed 
as rectangles with a three-dimensional appearance [29]. As a 
result, web users not only recognize interactive elements 
better, but the subjects of this test also clicked more precisely 
on the correct them (Figure 3 (b)).  
The findings of this test further suggest the use of 
“anchor points” that do not or hardly change their position 
and form, regardless of the layout or design of the page. How 
relevant such an anchor can be is shown in the mobile 
version of the job search window. In Figure 4 (b), the light 
blue header represents this anchor with a button to return to 
the previous page. In the original version A (see Figure 4 
(a)), all test subjects wrongly chose the X in the upper left 
corner of the browser window which closes the window 
instead of the correct one in right bottom corner.

Figure 4. Vertical smartphone version of the job search formular subpage. 
 
In addition, the test subjects needed an average of 16 
seconds for this incorrect decision. Due to the everlasting 
anchor in the form of the header, the participants of group B 
needed only three seconds to click on the correct button. 
4) Popups 
Pop-up windows offer a way to convey important 
information without losing the context of the current screen 
[30] and to attract the user’s attention. However, this may be 
disadvantageously for the user. For instance, if the user 
wants to search for a job at the Hochschuljobbörse website 
first a window with internships information pops up. Once 
closed, however, the user can no longer access the pop-up 
without reloading the page. 
To avoid such potentially confusing behavior, both test 
groups were asked to assess a modified version of the web 
page, where information about internships is not directly 
visible or overlap with the job search form. Only a field that 
refers to further information is displayed. In both test groups, 
most participants opted for no overlap version. 
5) Menu features 
A mental model can be changed, which is shown by the 
mobile menu presentation of the test. In the original version, 
the menu is presented as a hamburger icon and the position is 
unchanged (in the middle under the header). Based on the 
website analysis, menu icon is predominantly positioned in 
the top left corner. This placement was presented to the 
participants of the modified test variant B. Although the 
original version deviates from the usual arrangement, the 
subjects recognized both menu variants at the same rate. This 
suggests that the participants adjusted their mental model 
based on the desktop variant shown earlier.  
Participants were also asked to choose one of two 
smartphone menu variants (seen in Figure 5). In test group A 
(see Figure 5 (a)), 96% opted for variant 1. The majority in 
group B (see Figure 5 (b)) also voted for version 1, but only 
57%. Reasons for this can be found in the preference-test 
results. Users indicated to prefer the overview of all menu 
items. Since the menu items of test version A, variant 2 do 
not fit on one screen area, the participants presumably opt for 
variant 1. The reasoning is again confirmed by the narrow 
decision of the participants of group B. This is because all 
items are clearly visible on the screen in both versions. The 
fact that most of the participants in group B nevertheless tend 
towards variant 1 can be attributed to the fact that the 
initially collapsed menu items prevent the user from feeling 
overwhelmed. 
In the horizontal representation on the smartphone, the 
participants in test group A were shown a folded-out menu 
variant. Test group B still showed the hamburger icon in the 
upper left corner. It showed that the participants of the 
unchanged variant needed five seconds less to click on the 
menu than in the changed one. Due to the changed menu 
form, the user must first process the newly information, this 
takes time. The fact that older users emphasize with 
consistent menu representations (preference-test) is also 
reflected in this test. Participants between 18 and 34 years of 
age needed on average only 4 seconds longer to recognize 
the menu in the adapted version. For the older test subjects, it 
is 8 seconds more. From an information processing point of 
view, users benefit from a consistent website presentation. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This article seeks to providing insights to the relation 
between adaption of webpages and human cognition. A 
series of experiments indicated, for instance, that users do 
not notice small adaptations if they lead to a web site that 
looks "the same" on different devices. For fast processing of 
information, the right amount of information should be 
presented on a display surface. Due to the increasing 
perceptual limitations in old age, this turned out to be 
especially relevant for older web users. In general, the test 
results usually differed due to age groups. For example, 
while the older generation prefers a constant website display 
across all devices, younger web users welcome an 
adjustment if it improves the web experience for them. 
These results are limited in the following ways. First, 
only German participants have taken part in the test. Since 
experiences may differ due to cultural background, the 
results in this article should only be used for the German 
region. Second, the results are based on purely visual 
experiments and theoretical questions. Third, responsiveness 
should not be considered as an isolated variable when 
assessing the general user-friendliness of a website, which is 
also affected, e.g., by visual design and content selection.

Future work may build on these findings in various ways. 
Beside additional verification of the presented results by 
further studies, users’ changing expectations concerning 
adaptive behavior suggest a continuous repetition of such 
studies – and eventually a representation of derived 
recommendations able to comprise the evolution of user 
expectations.
