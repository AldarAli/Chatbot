analyzing the bit error probability of pilot aided orthog-
onal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems.
A comparative analysis with the conventional pilot pattern
schemes, overlapped pilot scheme and interlaced pilot scheme,
is developed. The results obtained here can be directly applied
to evaluate the performance of OFDMA systems in mesh
networks as well.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, orthogonal frequency division multi-
ple access (OFDMA) has been widely adopted for many
contemporary wireless systems such as wireless LANs,
digital video broadcasting for handheld terminals (DVB-
H) [1], Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
(WiMAX) [2], and second generation terrestrial digital video
broadcasting (DVB-T2) [3] due to its ﬂexibility on resource
allocation and robustness to multipath fading channel.
Channel estimation plays an important part in an OFDMA
system because it is used to coherently decode the trans-
mission signal and to combine the diversity. The effect of
channel estimation for OFDM systems is considered recently
for examples in [4], [5], and [6]. For the channel estimation,
a known signal so-called pilot is usually employed. The
pilot symbols are uniformly inserted into the transmission
data stream. These pilot symbols are transmitted through
the channel to convey the channel information. Channel
estimator at the receiver obtains the channel information
from these corrupted pilot symbols and determines the
channel response of data symbol region by interpolating
the channel response between samples obtained using pilot
symbols.
For a single user case, it is obvious that more pilot
symbols lead to better performance but with sacriﬁcing in
the symbol rate. Therefore the number of pilot symbols
is a trade-off between channel estimation accuracy and
bandwidth efﬁciency. However, for multi-user case, it is
not obvious that more pilot symbols outperform less pilot
symbols due to interference between users. If pilot symbols
are corrupted, data fail to be demodulated irrespective of
correcting processes such as despreading and decoding. Pilot
power boost-up does not help in this case because signal
to interference ratio remains the same. The solution is to
make the pilot symbols from different users not to collide
each other because pilot symbols are relatively stronger than
spread data symbols. The channel estimation performance is
improved by reducing the number of pilot symbol collisions.
However better channel estimation performance dose not
always guarantee better data detection performance. The
interference of pilot symbol region and the interference of
data symbol region are trade-off each other. With this point,
we focus on how to design pilot pattern for mesh networks
where serious interference exists.
In this paper, our objective is to present an initial approach
to design pilot patterns for mesh networks by analyzing
the performance of OFDMA system using traditional pi-
lot schemes, overlapped pilot scheme and interlaced pilot
scheme, for multi-user channel. The analysis and results can
be directly extended to the design of pilot patterns for mesh
networks.
The rest of the paper has been organized as follows.
Section II contains the system model and pilot aided channel
estimation for OFDMA system. Section III provides bit
error probability (BEP) analysis for uncoded OFDMA and
coded OFDMA systems. Simulation results are in Section
IV. Finally, Section V summarizes our main results.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A typical OFDM system is reviewed as follows. In the
discrete time domain, the transmitted lth OFDM signal is
expressed by
xl[n] =
N−1
X
k=0
Xl[k]ej2πkn/N
(1)
where Xl[k] is a data signal and n is the time index and k
and N are subcarrier index and total number of subcarriers
respectively.
The received OFDM signal can be written as
Yl[k] =
N−1
X
n=0
{hl[n] ⊛ xl[n] + zl[n]} e−j2πkn/N
=
N−1

(2)
where ⊛ is the convolution function, Hl[k] is the channel
response of the kth signal and lth OFDM symbol and Zl[k]
is interference and Gaussian noise term.
Based on equation (2), if Hl[k] is known perfectly at
the receiver, the maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver would
decode the symbol as follows:
ˆXl[k] = Yl[k]
Hl[k]
(3)
However, in various OFDMA systems (just as many
other systems), the channel is not perfectly known. Thus,
the channel estimation is necessary and pilot symbols are
usually used for the channel estimation.
A. Pilot Aided Channel Estimation
For the channel estimation, a known symbol so-called
pilot signal is usually employed. Before the transmission,
pilot signals are uniformly inserted into the data stream.
Upon receiving the corrupted pilot signals at the receiver,
the channel impulse response at pilot locations is estimated.
The channel impulse response at data locations can then
be obtained through interpolation with the channel impulse
response estimated at pilot locations.
We consider the least-squares (LS) estimate for the chan-
nel estimation. The lth estimated channel response can be
obtained as follows:
ˆHl[p] = Yl[p]
Xl[p] = Hl[p] + Zl[p]
Xl[p] = Hl[p] + Vl[p]
(4)
where the subscript p denotes the index of pilot subcarrier,
Xl[p] is the pth pilot signal at the lth OFDM symbol and
Yl[p] is the received symbol corresponding to pilot signal
Xl[p] and Vl[p] is the channel estimation error term.
For the data location, the channel response can be esti-
mated by taking interpolation between the pilot’s channel
estimate. There are several forms to interpolate: uniform,
spline interpolation, and 2D Wiener interpolation etc. Here,
the linear interpolation is used. In the linear interpolation,
the data channel estimate is given by
ˆHl[d] =

1 − s
S

ˆHl[p] + s
S
ˆHl[p + 1]
(5)
where d denotes the index of data subcarrier, S is the
interval between pilot subcarriers and s is the distance
between the pth pilot subcarrier and the dth data subcarrier.
Thus, the transmitted data signal at the dth data subcarrier
and the lth OFDM symbol can be estimated by
ˆXl[d] = Yl[d]
ˆHl[d]
.
(6)
For two schemes, overlapped pilot scheme and interlaced
pilot scheme, the above formula can be re-written as follows:
Overlapped pilot scheme:
ˆXl[d] = Yl[d]
ˆHl[d]
= Xl[d] + Zl[d]
ˆHl[d]
− Vl[d]Xl[d]
ˆHl[d]
(7)
ˆZl[d] = Il[d] + Nl[d]
(8)
Il[d] =
X
i∈κ
H(i)
l [d]X(i)
l [d]
(9)
where Il[d] is the interference of dth data signal and lth
OFDM symbol, H(i)
l [d] and X(i)
l [d] are the channel response
and the data signal of ith user respectively and κ is the set
of neighbor users.
Interlaced pilot scheme:
ˆXl[d1] = Yl[d1]
ˆHl[d1]
= Xl[d1] + Zl[d1]
ˆHl[d1]
− Vl[d1]Xl[d1]
ˆHl[d1]
(10)
ˆZl[d1] = Il[d1] + Nl[d1]

ˆHl[d2]

ˆZl[d2] = Il[d2] + Nl[d2]

where j is the user index that jth user’s pilot signal is
interfering.
For the interlaced pilot scheme, we can divide the data
signals into two parts. The ﬁrst part is the region that one
of neighbor user’s pilot signal and another neighbor users’
data signals are interfering. The second part is the region
that all of neighbor users’ data signals are interfering. The
ﬁrst part gets more interference than second part because
the pilot power is boosted for accurate channel estimation.
At the above equations, we denote d1 as the data subcarrier
index in the ﬁrst part and d2 as the data subcarrier index in
the second part.
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF OFDMA SYSTEM
A. Uncoded OFDMA System
In this paper, we show the BEP performance analysis of
the QPSK because the performance of other constellations,
16-QAM and 64-QAM, can be derived in a similar manner.
A QPSK symbol can be written as X = XI+iXQ = |X|eiθ,
where XI, XQ ∈ {1, −1}.

obtained as
γb[k] =

(E[|Z[k]|2 + |V [k]|2|X[k]|2])
(24)
where V [k](=
ˆ
H[k] − H[k]) is the channel estimation
error at kth subcarrier and K denotes the number of bits
represented by one symbol. For example, K = 1 for BPSK
and K = 2 for QPSK.
For a reasonably good estimate, ˆH ≈ H then the average
SINR per bit is approximated by
γb ≈ E[|HX|2]
K(E[|Z|2]).
(25)
From the above equation 25, the average SINR per bit of
QPSK is expressed as
γb =

For two cases, the overlapped pilot case and the interlaced
pilot case, above equation (20) and (22) can be re-written
as follows:

B. Coded OFDMA System
Error correcting coding is an essential part of OFDMA
systems for wireless communications. OFDMA in a fading
environment is almost always used with coding to improve
its performance and as such is often referred to as Coded
OFDMA or COFDMA. Just as we can introduce time diver-
sity through coding and interleaving in a ﬂat-fading single-
carrier system, we can introduce frequency diversity through
coding and interleaving across subcarriers in an OFDMA
system. With coding and interleaving across subcarriers, the
strong subcarriers help the weak ones. Thus overall data
detection performance is dependent on the ratio of strong
part and weak part.

To compare the performance of COFDMA systems using
overlapped pilot scheme and interlaced pilot scheme, we
consider the union bound derived in [7], [8]. We use turbo
code and BPSK signaling on the Rayleigh fading channel.
Then the union bound on the bit-error rate is given by

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
For the simulation, we used turbo code of Fig. 2 in
[9] and punctured with code rate 1/2. The LS channel
estimation method is used on the Rayleigh fading channel.
All simulations are performed in MATLAB program.
Figs. 2 and 3 show the BEP performance of overlapped
pilot scheme and interlaced pilot scheme, and uncoded
BPSK in [10]. These ﬁgures indicate that interlaced pilot
scheme outperforms overlapped with some serious interfer-
ence environments (not always). We can recheck this from
Fig. 4.

The effect of pilot power boosting can be observed from
Fig. 5. When the pilot power boosting increases, the BEP
performance of interlaced pilot scheme becomes worse. The
reason for this is that the pilot power of interference are
also increased. For overlapped pilot scheme, the BEP perfor-
mance is improved as pilot power increase because channel
estimation error is decreased with ﬁxed SINR simulation
environment.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we analyze the performance of overlapped
pilot scheme and interlaced pilot scheme for channel esti-
mation. This comparison is of special interest since the pilot
pattern affects the performance of OFDMA systems. Sim-
ulation results in terms of BEP corroborate our theoretical
analysis.
We notice that interlaced pilot pattern is more suitable for
the multi-user networks like mesh network in which serious
interference exists. Various pilot design is possible for mesh
networks and we expect that our systematic approach and
simulation results obtained here can be directly applied to
evaluate the performance of pilot aided OFDMA systems
for mesh networks.
