Abstract — Enhanced Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC) are 
required 
for 
the 
current 
demand 
of 
flexibility 
and 
reconfigurability in telecommunications networks. Thus, an 
extensive characterization and testing is necessary to provide an 
accurate prediction of the PIC performance. The use of Spatial 
Light Modulator (SLM) as a diffractive device to reconstruct 
images from Computer Generated Holograms (CGH) allows to 
modulate the wave form of a light beam. In this study, we 
proposed the use of the SLM technology as a flexible platform 
for feeding photonic integrated processors. Preliminary results 
were obtained, to produce a multiplexing/demultiplexing CGH 
to be applied into an optical chip for data compression based on 
Haar wavelet transform.

INTRODUCTION 
In the recent years, we have witnessed a huge increase in 
the data traffic which the traditional copper based electronic 
mediums fail to carry [1] [2]. The subsequent evolution in 
optical communications has led to the emergence of Photonic 
Integrated Circuits (PIC). PIC-based optical communication 
offers an efficient and cost-effective alternative to data 
transmission driving to a significant growth in the segment 
[1]. It is expected an annual growth rate of 25.2% during the 
estimate period of 2015 to 2022 [2]. Furthermore, PIC 
increasing demand can also be attributed to innovative 
applications in bio-photonics [1]. 
PIC can be characterized as a multiport device composed 
by an integrated system of optical elements embedded onto a 
single chip using a waveguide architecture [3]. The testing of 
optical components is more difficult than testing electrical 
components and for an accurate prediction of the PIC 
performance, an extensive characterization and testing is 
required [4]. Moreover, optical components testing is difficult 
and time-consuming, e.g., due to the tight 3D alignment 
tolerances for accurate coupling of light [4]. 
The SLM capability to dynamically reconfigure the light 
makes it an attractive technology to excite cores and/or modes 
[5], [6], as it allows the arbitrary addition or removal of 
channels by the software and it is anticipated that it can 
improve channel compensation. This feature can then be 
explored to feed/receive optical signal from the PIC. 
SLM is an electrically programmable device that 
modulates light according to a spatial (pixel) pattern [7]. This 
device can control incident light in amplitude-only, phase-
only or the combination phase-amplitude [7], [8]. However, 
common methods of hologram generation cannot arbitrarily 
modulate the amplitude and phase of a beam simultaneously 
[9], [10]. It is not then possible to simply address the inverse 
Fourier Transform of the desired pattern into the far-field and 
replicate the resulting distribution of amplitude and phase 
directly on the SLM [9]. Thus, it is necessary to apply 
optimization algorithms to calculate the best hologram 
possible within the constraints of the device [9]. 
The SLM based on nematic Liquid Crystal on Silicon 
(LCoS) technology is an electrically addressed reflection type 
phase-only spatial light modulator in which the liquid crystal 
is controlled by a direct and accurate voltage and can modulate 
the wave front of a light beam [8], [11]. It is used as a 
diffractive device to reconstruct images from Computer 
Generated Holography (CGH) [12]. This optical signal 
processing can be produced with different techniques, e.g., 
linear Fourier transform (i.e., linear phase mask) [13], 
Iterative Fourier Transform Algorithm (IFTA) [14], [15], 
Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm [16] and simulated annealing 
[17]. The use of a SLM as a diffractive device to reconstruct 
images from CGH allows to modulate the wave front of a light 
beam. 
In this study, we proposed the use of the SLM technology 
as a flexible platform for feeding photonic integrated 
processors, i.e., to feed/receive optical signal from the PIC. 
Preliminary results were obtained, to produce an expected 
CGH to be applied into an optical chip for data compression 
based on Haar wavelet transform. The paper is organized in 
four sections. Section II describes the methodology applied. 
Subsection II-A presents the design of the PIC for data 
compression; subsection II-B presents the generation and 
optimization of the CGH; and subsection II-C presents the 
SLM setup. Section III and IV presents the obtained results 
and its discussion, respectively. Section V concludes the study 
and presents future work.

II. 
METHODOLOGY 
The methodology is divided into three subsections: A) the 
design of the optical chip for data compression based in Haar 
wavelet transform; B) the algorithms used for the generation 
and optimization of the CGH; and C) the implementation of 
the SLM setup to acquire the CGH. 
A. PIC for data compression based on Haar wavelet 
transform 
The design of the new data compression chip based on 
Haar Transform (HT) is presented in Figure 1 [3]. 
 
Figure 1. Design of an optical chip for data compression based on HT. 
The chip is composed by four Distributed Feedback (DFB) 
lasers (L1-L4), three asymmetric couplers (C1-C3), six PIN 
photodiodes for network monitoring (PIN: L1, L4, C1, C2, 
C3M1, C3M2) two spot size converters, six multimode 
interferometers (MMI) 1x2 and one MMI 2x2. 
The HT operations include Low-pass (L) and High-pass 
(H) filters applied over one dimension at a time. This filtering 
operation corresponds to the calculation of the average 
between two neighbors’ pixels values (low-pass) or the 
difference between them (high-pass) [18]. The HT is 
implemented with a 3 asymmetric couplers (2x2) network, 
which reproduces the required operations, i.e., the average 
(sum) and the difference (subtraction) between the optical 
input pair [3]. The proposed asymmetric couplers were 
designed and simulated in the OptoDesigner from Phoenix 
Software [19]. 
The 2D HT can be decomposed in 4 sub-bands, LL, LH, 
HL and HH [18]. The LL gives the data compressed. In the 
chip these 4 sub-bands can be extrapolated from the 4 output 
waveguides (WG) at the end of the 3 asymmetric couplers 
network, see Figure 2. The measurements of the distance 
between the 4 WG at the end of the 3 asymmetric coupler 
network (represented as d1, d2 and d3 in Figure 2) have an 
order of magnitude of 200 m. Measurements were performed 
with a Leica microscope (DM 750M; 1CC50 HD) and an 
objective of 20x (HI Plan EPI, 20x/0.40) [20].

at the end of the 3 asymmetric coupler network. 
Further description of the design and characterization of 
the optical chip can be found in this study [3]. 
B. Generation of the CGH 
The CGH produces a phase mask or diffractive optical 
element to apply to the SLM [13]. The information to be 
transformed (in the Fourier domain) is introduced into the 
optical system by the SLM, with a phase mask that is 
appropriate to the input function of interest [21]. The 
following calculus applied for the generation of the CGH were 
based in the Fourier optical principles presented in [21]. 
The CGH was obtained with a linear phase mask 
calculated in the frequency domain (1), where 𝑐𝑥 and 𝑐𝑦 are 
the horizontal and vertical tilt parameters, respectively; and 𝑓𝑥 
and 𝑓𝑦 are the spatial frequency matrix arrays corresponding 
to the image to be generated in the 𝑋 and 𝑌 axis, respectively. 
𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑟 = −2𝜋(𝑐𝑥 𝑓𝑥 + 𝑐𝑦 𝑓𝑦) 
(1) 
The mask transfer function to be sent to the SLM, is given 
by 𝐻𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘 = ∠(exp(𝑖𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑟)) , ensuring that the phase 
values are set in the range of [−𝜋, 𝜋].  
An estimation of the output signal is given by (2). 
𝑆𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑡(𝐻(𝑓𝑓𝑡(𝑆𝑖𝑛)) 
(2) 
𝑆𝑖𝑛  describes the signal of the input beam (3), where 
(𝑥0, 𝑦0)  provides the horizontal and vertical position and 
(𝑤𝑥, 𝑤𝑦) the width and the height of the beam, respectively, 
see Figure 3.

1) Optimization of the CGH 
To obtain a hologram that replicates the output of the 4 
WG of the optical chip (see Figure 2), the linear 
transformations in the Fourier domain presented in (4), (5) 
were applied. 
𝐻 = ∠(𝑒𝑖𝐻1 + 𝑒𝑖𝐻2 + 𝑒𝑖𝐻3 + 𝑒𝑖𝐻4) 
(4) 
𝐻1 = exp (𝑖 ∗ (2𝜋(𝑐𝑥1 ∗ 𝑓𝑥 + 𝑐𝑦1 ∗ 𝑓𝑦))) 
(5) 
A phase-only SLM does not allow to simply address the 
inverse Fourier of the desired pattern into the far-field and 
replicate the resulting distribution of amplitude and phase 
directly on the SLM [9], thus it is challenging to spatially 
modulate the light with the expected resolution and accuracy. 
To overcome this difficulty, an iterative algorithm to 
obtain the desired hologram with an error factor 𝛿 ≤ 5% was 
implemented. The main steps of the algorithm can be 
described as: i) generate a 1st linear phase mask to produce 
the expected initial field (𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑝), based on (4); ii) initially set 
the four values 𝑎1−4  to 1, from 𝐻 = ∠(𝑎1𝑒𝑖𝐻1 + 𝑎2𝑒𝑖𝐻2 +
𝑎3𝑒𝑖𝐻3 + 𝑎4𝑒𝑖𝐻4); iii) acquire the hologram generated by SLM 
(𝐼𝑆𝐿𝑀) with a camera and feed this data to the algorithm; iv) 
calculate the difference between the hologram generated and 
the initial field expected, defined as error factor: 𝛿 =
𝑎𝑏𝑠(𝐼𝑆𝐿𝑀 − 𝐼1) ≤ 0.05 ; iv) if the condition 𝛿 ≤ 0.05  is not 
satisfied repeat steps (ii-iv) by iteratively adjusting the values 
of 𝑎1−4 to compensate the error factor. The algorithm was 
developed in Matlab [22], which was able to control both 
SLM and camera hardware. The block diagram of the 
algorithm is presented in Figure 4.

the CGH. 
The error factor ( 𝛿 ) reproduces the deviation of the 
generated hologram when compared with the expected output 
of the optical chip, i.e., the dimensions of the 4 WG.  
C. Setup to generate the CGH 
A reflective LCoS phase only SLM, model PLUTO-
TELCO-012, with a wavelength range of 1400-1700 nm, an 
active area of 15.36 mm × 8.64 mm, a pixel pitch of 8.0 µm, 
a fill factor of 92% and reflectivity of 80% [8] was used to 
generate the hologram. The setup was composed by: a laser 
(1550nm wavelength); a polarization controller; two lenses 
(AC254-050-C-ML, AR coating 1050-1620nm) L1 and L2 
with a focal length of 75mm and 250mm, respectively; a Near-
Infrared (IR) (1460-1600nm) camera (sensing area: 6.44.8, 
resolution: 752582, pixel size: 8.68.3) to capture the 
hologram produced; and a neutral density to avoid saturation 
in the camera acquisition, see Figure 5. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The hologram was generated in 1st order of diffraction 
where the polarization was occurring.  
 
Figure 5. Hologram acquired by the IR camera, left: initial CGH; right: 
CGH optimized. 
 Figure 6 presents the holograms acquired by the IR 
camera, i.e., the initial hologram fed to the optimization 
algorithm with an obtained error factor 𝛿 ≤ 17% (left figure) 
and the final optimized CGH, with an error factor 𝛿 < 2% 
(right figure). 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
A significant improvement in the generated hologram is 
achieved with CGH optimization, i.e., a reduction of the error 
factor (𝛿) by 15%. Nevertheless, optical artefacts associated 
with the diffraction of light were not completely eliminated, 
i.e., additional 2 spots (with less intensity) are generated. This 
diffraction artefact can cause a reduction of signal expected at 
the 4 output WG of the optical chip. 
The phase mask that replicates the expected output of the 
optical chip can be used to multiplex/demultiplex the obtained 
result. Furthermore, a phase mask which addresses the HT 
operations can also be applied to invert the compression 
induced by the HT (optically implemented in the chip with the 
3 asymmetric couplers network). 
The use of the SLM will then allow to provide a proof of 
concept of the PIC operation. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
An extensive PIC characterization and testing is essential 
to provide an accurate prediction of its performance. To 
complement the PIC characterization process is proposed in 
this study a concept to use the SLM as a flexible platform for 
feeding photonic integrated processors. The capacity of the 
SLM to dynamically reconfigure light allows to feed and/or 
receive information to the PIC. This data can be used to 
provide a proof of concept of the operation performed by the 
optical chip, e.g., 2D HT. A first preliminary result was 
obtained, i.e., a phase mask that can be used to feed/receive
