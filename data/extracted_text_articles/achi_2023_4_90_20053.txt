Abstract—In Japan, there is a well-known idiomatic expres-
sion called “anshin anzen.” Generally, “anshin” is defined as
“subjective peace” and “anzen” as “objective safety.” However,
previous studies have shown that objective safety, which is
determined by physical measurements, does not always match
the subjective feeling of safety. How does the feeling of safety
differ from “anshin,” which is inherently subjective? In this study,
participants were asked to evaluate “anshin” or feeling of safety
for automobile features, and the two evaluations were compared.
The results showed that both evaluations decreased in response
to high malfunction rates, but the feeling of safety evaluations did
not decrease for the high criticality features. Additionally, both
evaluations increased for moderate or low malfunction rates,
but the feeling of safety evaluations did not increase for low
criticality features. These findings indicate that the feeling of
safety is sensitive to feature criticality and information.
Keywords-component; anshin; anzen; subjective evaluation.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Concept of “Anshin and Anzen”
In the Japanese language, there is a well-known idiomatic
expression called “anshin anzen.” “Anshin” is translated as
“peace of mind and freedom from care [anxiety]” and “anzen”
as “safety, security, and freedom from danger” [1]. Although
these two are often used together, there are subtle differences
in their meanings. “Anshin” has unique nuances that cannot
be translated into English accurately [2]. Hereafter, “anshin”
is used as it is although “anzen” is replaced with “safety”.
Actually, the terms “anshin” and “anzen” are used dif-
ferently. For example, “koutsu anzen (traffic [road] safety)”,
“anzen unten (safe driving)”, and “anzen kijun (safety stan-
dards)” are listed in the Japanese dictionary; however, “koutsu
anshin (traffic [road] peace)”, “anshin unten (peaceful driv-
ing)”, or “anshin kijun (peace standards)” are not listed [1].
According to the Japanese definitions, “anshin” is subjective
and safety is objective. “Anshin” is a subjective feeling based
on psychological factors. There are no definite steps to evoke
“anshin,” whereas safety can be ensured with technology [3];
“anshin” varies significantly from person to person and is
strongly dependent on trust whereas safety evaluation requires
an objective and quantitative approach [4]. “Anshin” is the
belief that the situation is not very different from what one
expects and that one can accept a sudden unexpected mishap.
In contrast, safety is objectively defined as the absence of
damage to individuals and communities [5].
B. “Anzen-kan” (Feeling of Safety)
In recent years in traffic studies, subjective evaluations
from drivers or pedestrians have become important. Studies
have focused on aspects, such as risk perception [6]–[8],
comfort/discomfort [9]–[12], and fear [11].
Objective safety, which is determined based on physical
measurements such as speed and gap between two vehicles,
does not always match subjective evaluations [13]. For exam-
ple, passengers in an automated vehicle perceive risk even
when the vehicle maintains an objectively safe speed and
gap [8]. A model was built to estimate risk perception of
pedestrians based on physical measurements [13].
Thus, it is important to verify how people perceive objective
safety subjectively. The feeling of safety is apparently the same
as the subjective “anshin”, but with some subtle differences.
The term “safety” is mostly used in the context of nuclear
power and disasters while “anshin” is mainly used for life
and economy; thus, the two terms are clearly used differently
in Japan. It is predicted that feeling of safety evaluation will
be lower than “anshin” evaluation for machinery posing a high
risk to human life because the objective criteria would be
stringent. Therefore, the first goal of this study is to verify the
differences between “anshin” and feeling of safety evaluations
for automobile features with different levels of criticality.
Subjective evaluations of automobile features are affected
by information about their performance, that is, how they
function. Drivers’ subjective evaluations change in response to
information regarding Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC); these
evaluations change further when they practically use of ACC
[14]. Thus, information indicating functional instability may
affect “anshin” and feeling of safety evaluations, especially
when the feature is critical. Therefore, the second goal of

this study is to verify how “anshin” and feeling of safety
evaluations change before and after the provision of informa-
tion regarding the unstable performance of automobile features
having varying levels of safety criticality.
Section 2 describes the experimental method and Section
3 describes the results of the experiment. In Section 4, we
discuss the differences between “anshin” and feeling of safety
evaluations.
II. METHOD
A. Experimental Design
The following four factors were manipulated in the
experiment: Evaluation (“Anshin”/Feeling of Safety; between-
participant
factor);
Malfunction
(MHigh/MMid/MLow;
between-participant factor); Criticality (CHigh/CMid/CLow;
within-participant factor); and Phase (Pre-evaluation/Post-
evaluation; within-participant factor). The Evaluation factor
is set as a between-participant factor to prevent confusion
between “anshin” and safety. The Malfunction factor was also
set as a between-participant factor to prevent direct effects of
values of malfunction rates.
B. Participant
We recruited 270 participants using a crowdsourcing service
and randomly assigned each participant to one of six condi-
tions. Due to incomplete questionnaires, 29 participants were
excluded. Thus, 241 participants were included in the analysis
(Table I; Mage = 40.96, SDage = 8.77).

C. Procedure
All the procedures were conducted on a browser, and
informed consent was obtained in advance. First, participants
were asked to respond freely to the question: “What do you
think about ‘anshin’?” in the “anshin” conditions or “What
do you think about safety?” in the feeling of safety condi-
tions to improve the validity of the subsequent evaluations.
Next, the automobile feature to be evaluated was presented.
For example, a question in the anshin-CHigh condition was
as follows: “In recent years, the automatic driving feature
has become popular. This feature allows a vehicle to sense
its surroundings and automatically drive to the destination.
Although this feature is effective in reducing drivers’ efforts,
malfunctions can still occur. What do you feel about its
‘anshin’?” Participants were asked to respond using a 7-point
scale (Pre-evaluation).
Subsequently, as a report, a total of six malfunction rates
measured for three regions by two companies were pre-
sented. The six malfunction rates were approximately 2% in
the MHigh conditions, 0.02% in the MMid conditions, and
0.0002% in the MLow conditions on average. Participants
responded to the same question as in the pre-evaluation
considering the malfunction rates (Post-evaluation).
Similarly, participants responded to questions about the au-
tomobile features in CMid and CLow conditions, which were
automatic parking and automatic wipers, respectively. The
order of three safety criticality conditions was counterbalanced
among participants.
III. RESULTS
A. Pre-Evaluations
In order to verify the differences between “anshin” and
feeling of safety evaluations of automobile features vary-
ing in safety criticality, Evaluation × Criticality ANOVA
was conducted in the pre-evaluation (Figure 1). The results
showed that the main effect of Evaluation was significant
(F(1, 239) = 23.78, p < .001, ηp = .09), and feeling of
safety evaluation was higher than the “anshin” evaluation. The
main effect of Criticality was also significant (F(2, 478) =
165.66, p < .001, ηp = .40), and further analysis showed
that the evaluations were higher for CHigh, CMid, and CLow
in that order (ts > 7.43, ps < .001). However, the interaction
was not significant (F(2, 478) = 0.30, p < .001, ηp = .09).
Thus, although the feeling of safety evaluation was higher
than the “anshin” evaluation in pre-evaluation, there was no
difference between “anshin” and feeling of safety with respect
to the safety criticality of the automobile features.

B. Changes due to Information
To verify the differences in changes in “anshin” and feeling
of safety evaluations before and after the provision of informa-
tion regarding the unstable performance of features varying in
safety criticality, Malfunction × Criticality × Phase ANOVAs
were conducted in the two evaluations (Figure 2). The common
and distinct characteristics are separately reported below.
1) Common Characteristics: The main effects of Criticality
were significant in both “anshin” and feeling of safety evalu-
ations and further analysis showed that the evaluations were
higher for CLow, CMid, and CHigh in that order (“anshin”:
ts > 5.54, ps < .001; feeling of safety: ts > 5.54, ps < .001).
Malfunction × Phase interactions were significant, and the
simple main effects were significant in MHigh, MMid, and

MLow conditions (“anshin”: Fs > 8.57, ps < .006, ηps >
.19; feeling of safety: Fs > 9.56, ps < .004, ηps > .19).
Specifically, the pre-evaluations were higher in the MHigh
condition and the post-evaluations were higher in the MMid
and MLow conditions. Thus, both of “anshin” and feeling of
safety evaluations decreased with high malfunction rates, but
increased with moderate or low malfunction rates.
2) Distinct Characteristics: Because the second-order in-
teraction of Malfunction × Criticality × Phase was significant
only in the feeling of safety condition, further analysis was
conducted (Table III). The results showed that the decreases
due to high malfunction rates were not found in the CHigh
condition. On the other hand, the increases due to moder-
ate or low malfunction rates were not found in the CLow
condition. In sum, the following two differences were found.
First, with high malfunction rates, the “anshin” evaluations
decreased uniformly, but the feeling of safety evaluations did
not decrease for the high criticality features (i.e., automatic
driving). Second, with moderate or low malfunction rates,
the “anshin” evaluations increased uniformly, but the feeling
of safety evaluations did not increase for the low criticality
features (i.e., automatic wipers).
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The first goal of this study was to verify the differences
between “anshin” and feeling of safety evaluations of au-
tomobile features having varying levels of safety criticality.
The results revealed that the feeling of safety evaluations was
higher than the “anshin” evaluations. Additionally, the higher
the criticality, the higher both evaluations, but no difference
was found between the two evaluations. The safety evaluations
had been expected to be lower than the “anshin” evaluations
for high criticality features, but they were higher overall. This
indicates that “anshin” is more stringent than feeling of safety.
This difference needs to be verified in future research.
The second goal was to verify the differences in changes
in “anshin” and feeling of safety evaluations before and after
the provision of information about the unstable performance
of features having varying levels of criticality. The results
revealed that both evaluations decreased in response to high
malfunction rates, but the feeling of safety evaluations did not
decrease for the high criticality features. Additionally, both
evaluations increased for moderate or low malfunction rates,
but the feeling of safety evaluations did not increase for the
low criticality features.
It has been shown that drivers’ trust in ACC decreases
immediately after some problems of ACC are presented [14].
Assuming that ACC is a high criticality feature and that the
information indicates instability, the finding is similar to this
previous study that the information about a malfunctioning
critical feature decreases “anshin” evaluations.
It is notable, however, that such a decrease was not ob-

served in the feeling of safety evaluations. That may be
because feeling of safety evaluations involves a deep process
with respect to the significance of the unstable-performance-
related information of a critical feature. Although unstable
performance is inherently problematic, it may be favorably
interpreted as an indication of the technical complexity of
a critical feature, preventing a decrease in feeling of safety
evaluation. Similarly, feeling of safety evaluations did not
improve when non-critical features were described as stable.
The reason may be that the stable performance of low-critical
features is objectively interpreted as non-relevant to safety.
Further verification is needed on this point.
These findings that the feeling of safety is sensitive to
feature criticality of function and information about unstable
performance suggests the possibility that the feeling of safety
is based on objective physical measurements. In this sense,
“anshin” may be relatively insensitive and more subjective.
Although it has been suggested that “anshin” includes pro-
cesses of prediction and trust [4], whether the feeling of safety
includes these processes must be carefully verified.
