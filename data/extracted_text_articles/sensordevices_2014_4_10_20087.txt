Abstract— In this paper, we present a wavelength selector 
based on a monolithic multilayer pi’n/pin a-SiC:H optical filter 
that requires appropriate near-ultraviolet steady states optical 
switches to select the desired wavelengths in the visible-near 
infrared (VIS-NIR) ranges. Results show that the background 
intensity works as a selector in the infrared/visible regions, 
shifting the sensor sensitivity. Low intensities select the NIR 
range while high intensities select the visible part. Here, the 
optical gain is very high in the red range, decreases in the 
green range, and stays near one in the blue region decreasing 
strongly 
in 
the 
near-ultraviolet 
range. 
The 
transfer 
characteristics effects due to changes in steady state light 
intensity and wavelength backgrounds are presented. The 
relationship between the optical inputs and the output signal is 
established when a multiplexed signal is analysed. An 
optoelectronic model gives insight into the physics of the 
selector.

INTRODUCTION  
Newly 
developed 
technologies 
for 
infrared 
telecommunication systems allowed the increase of 
capacity, distance and functionality, switching and control 
with the design of new reconfigurable logic active filter 
gates by “bridging the gaps” and combining the optical 
filters properties. Expanding 
far beyond traditional 
applications in optical interconnects at telecommunication 
wavelengths [1] [2], the SiC nanophotonic integrated circuit 
platform has recently proven its merits for working with 
visible range optical signals. To enhance the transmission 
capacity 
and 
the 
application 
flexibility 
of 
optical 
communication efforts have to be considered, namely the 
Wavelength Division Multiplexing based on tandem a-
SiC:H light controlled filters, when different visible signals 
are encoded in the same optical transmission path [3] [4]. In 
this paper, the shift of the visible range to telecom band can 
be accomplished using the same wavelength selector but 
under near-ultraviolet optical bias, acting as reconfigurable 
active filters in the visible and near infrared ranges. These 
active filters act as interface devices that establish the bridge 
between the infrared and red spectral range playing a key 
role to bridging the infrared and the visible optical 
communication technology. They can be used to perform 
different filtering processes, such as: amplification, 
switching, and wavelength conversion. 
After a short introduction, in Section II, the design, 
characterization, and operation of the device is described. In 
Section III, the light filtering properties are analyzed and in 
Section 
IV, 
the 
methodology 
that 
supports 
the 
visible/infrared tuning is presented.  In Section V, an 
optoelectronic model gives insight into the physics of the 
device and, finally in Section VI the main conclusions are 
presented. 
II. 
DEVICE DESIGN, CHARACTERIZATION AND 
OPERATION 
The selector is realized by using a double pi’n/pin a-
SiC:H photodetector with TCO front and back biased 
optical gating elements as depicted in Figure 1. The active 
device 
consists 
of 
a 
p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n 
heterostructure. The thicknesses and optical gap of the front 
i'- (200 nm; 2.1 eV) and back i- (1000 nm; 1.8 eV) layers 
are optimized for light absorption in the blue and red ranges, 
respectively [5].  
Optoelectronic characterization was performed through 
spectral response and transmittance measurements without 
and with steady state applied optical bias. The optical bias 
(; background) was superimposed using near-ultraviolet 
Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) (390 nm). Currents between 
0.005 mA and 30 mA were used to drive the LEDs in order 
to change the light flux background.

Monochromatic (infrared, red, green, blue and violet; 
IR,R,G,B,V;) pulsed communication channels (input channels) 
are combined together, each one with a specific bit sequence 
and absorbed accordingly their wavelengths (see arrow 
magnitudes in Figure 1). The combined optical signal 
(multiplexed signal; MUX) is analyzed by reading out the 
generated photocurrent under negative applied voltage (-
8V), without and with near-ultraviolet background (390nm) 
and different intensities, applied either from front (F) or 
back (B) sides. The device operates within the visible/NIR 
range using as input color channels the square wave 
modulated low power light supplied by near-infrared/red 
(NIR/ R: 880 nm-626nm), green (G: 524 nm), blue (B: 470 
nm) and violet (V: 400 nm) LEDs. 
In Figure 2a, the transmittances from the front and back 
diodes are plotted as well as the transmittance of the 
complete device without any background light. In Figure 2b, 
the transmittance is displayed under different 390 nm 
background intensities.

Results confirm the influence of the thickness of each 
front and back diode on the transmittance of the whole 
device. It is interesting to notice that under front light 
irradiation, the transmittance decreases in the infrared range 
as the background intensity increases leading to an infrared 
absorption window. 
III. 
LIGHT FILTERING PROPERTIES 
The spectral sensitivity was tested through spectral 
response measurements [6] [7] without applied optical bias 
and under 390 nm front and back backgrounds of variable 
intensities. In Figure 3 the spectral gain (α), defined as the 
ratio between the spectral photocurrent with and without 
applied optical bias, is displayed under near-UV (=390 
nm; Figures 3a and 3b) illuminations. In Figure 3a, the light 
was applied from the front (F) and in Figure 3b, the 
irradiation occurs from the back side (B). The background 
intensity () was changed between 5µWcm-2 and 3800 
µWcm-2.

Front (a) and back (b) spectral gains (αF,B) under =390 nm  
irradiation. 
Results show that the optical gains have opposite 
behaviors, under front and back irradiations. Under 390 nm 
front irradiation (Figure 3a) and low flux, the gain is high in 
the infrared region, presents a well-defined peak at 750 nm 
and strongly quenches in the visible range. As the power 
intensity increases, the peak shifts to the visible range and 
can be deconvoluted into two peaks, one in the red range 
that slightly increases with the power density of the 
background and another in the green range that strongly

increases with the intensity of the ultra-violet radiation. In 
the blue range, the gain is much lower. This shows the 
controlled high-pass filtering properties of the device under 
different background intensities. Under back bias (Figure 
3b) the gain in the blue/violet range has a maximum near 
420 nm that quickly increases with the intensity. Besides it 
strongly lowers for wavelengths higher than 450 nm, acting 
as a short-pass filter. Thus, back irradiation, tunes the 
violet/blue region of the visible spectrum whatever the flux 
intensity, while front irradiation, depending on the 
background intensity, selects the infrared or the visible 
spectral ranges. Here, low fluxes select the near infrared 
region and cut the visible one, the reddish part of the 
spectrum is selected at medium fluxes, and high fluxes tune 
the red/green ranges with different gains.  
IV. 
VISIBLE AND INFRA-RED TUNING  
Four monochromatic pulsed lights separately (645nm, 
697 nm, 850 nm and 880 nm input channels) or combined 
(MUX signal; Figure 5) illuminated the device at 12000 bps. 
 Steady state 390 nm bias at different intensities 
(1µWcm-2<F,B<3000µWcm-2) 
were 
superimposed 
separately from the front and the back device side and the 
photocurrent was measured. The ratio between the 
photocurrent with and without applied optical bias was 
inferred and the gain for each wavelength channel 
determined. In Figure 4a, 880 nm transient signals at 
different flux irradiation are presented under front 
irradiations and back irradiations and in Figure 4b for the 
645 nm channel the diverse gain are also displayed.  In 
Figure 4c the gains for the four analyzed channels are 
shown as a function of the background intensity.  
As expected from Figure 3, in the red/infrared spectral 
ranges, the optical gain depends on optical bias intensity and 
on the wavelength of the input channels. Results show that, 
even under transient conditions and using commercial 
visible and NIR LEDs, the background side and intensity 
alters the signal magnitude of the input channels. Under 
front irradiation, as the light flux increases, the magnitudes 
of all the input channels increases being higher at 645 nm 
then at 697 nm, 850 nm or 880 nm. Under back irradiation, 
as the flux intensity increases the magnitude of the channels 
decreases, quickly in the visible range and stays almost 
constant in the infrared range. Even across narrow 
bandwidths, the photocurrent gains are quite different 
(Figure 4c). This nonlinearity provides the possibility for 
selective tuning of the visible and IR wavelengths allowing 
their recognition.  
In Figure 5, the MUX signals due to the combination of 
the four wavelength channels is displayed, under front and 
back irradiation. The signals were normalized to their values 
at the maximum flux.  
Results confirm that the magnitude of the combined 
signal depends mainly on the channel wavelength through 
its own gain.

Figure 5.  Front and back MUX signals under front and back =390 nm 
irradiation and different background intensities. 
This nonlinearity allows identifying the different input 
channels in a narrow red/infrared range. The 390 nm 
radiation is absorbed at the beginning of the front diode and, 
due to the self-bias effect, increases the electric field at the 
back diode where the red/infrared incoming photons (see 
Figure 2) are absorbed accordingly to their wavelengths (see 
Figure 3) resulting in an increased collection. Under back 
irradiation, the electric field decreases mainly at the i-n back 
interface quenching the red/NIR input signals in different 
ways. This effect may be due to the increased absorption 
under back irradiation (Figure 2) that increases the number 
of carriers generated by the infra-red photons. So, by 
switching between front and back irradiation the photonic 
function is modified from a long- to a band-pass filter 
allowing, alternately selecting the red or the infrared 
channels, making the bridge between the visible and the 
infrared regions.

OPTOELECTRONIC MODEL  
Based 
on 
the 
experimental 
results 
and 
device 
configuration a two connected phototransistors model 
(Figure 6a), made out of a short- and a long-pass filter was 
developed [5] and upgraded to include several input 
channels.  
In Figure 6b, the block diagram of the optoelectronic 
state model is displayed. The resistors (R1, R2) and 
capacitors 
(C1, 
C2) 
synthesize 
the 
desired 
filter 
characteristics. The input signals, IR,Rn,G,B,V model the input 
channels and i(t) the output signal. The amplifying 
elements, 1 and 2 are linear combinations of the optical 
gains of each impinging channel, respectively into the front 
and back phototransistors and take into account the 
enhancement or quenching of the channels (Figure 4) due to 
the steady state irradiation. Under front irradiation: 2>>1 
and under back irradiation 1>>2. This affects the reverse 
photo capacitances, (α1,2 /C1,2) that determine the influence 
of the system input on the state change.

A graphics user interface computer program was 
designed 
and 
programmed 
within 
the 
MATLAB® 
programming language, to ease the task of numerical 
simulation. 
This 
interface 
allows 
selecting 
model 
parameters, along with the plotting of both bit signal and 
simulated and experimental photocurrent results. To 
simulate the input channels we have used the individual 
magnitude of each input channel without background 
lighting, and the corresponding gain at the simulated 
background intensity (see Figures 4). Figure 7, presents 
results of a numerical simulation with 3000 µW/cm2 front 
and back =390 nm irradiation, using in Figure 7a the MUX 
signal of Figure 5 and in Figure 7b a VIS/NIR combination 
of V=400 nm, G=524 nm, R=697 nm, IR=850 nm input 
channels. Here, the front gains were αV=0.82, αG=2.85, 
αR=4.35, αIR=3.27 and the back ones, respectively: 11.5, 
0.68, 0.92 and 0.5. Values of R1=10 K, R2=1 K, 
C1=1000 pF, C2=20000 pF were used during the simulation 
process (Figure 6b). On top of both figures the drive input 
LED signals guide the eyes into the different on/off states 
and correspondent wavelengths. 
A good fitting between experimental and simulated 
results was achieved. The plots show the ability of the 
presented model to simulate the sensitivity behaviour of the 
proposed system in the visible/infrared spectral ranges. The 
optoelectronic model with light biasing control has proven 
to be a good tool to design optical filters. Furthermore, this 
model allows for extracting theoretical parameters by fitting 
the model to the measured data (internal resistors and 
capacitors).

CONCLUSIONS  
An optoelectronic device based on a-SiC:H technology is 
analyzed. Tailoring the filter wavelength in the NIR/VIS 
was achieved by using near-ultraviolet backgrounds and 
changing the irradiation side and intensity. Results show 
that the pi´n/pin multilayered structure functions and 
parameters are reconfigurable under front and back 
irradiation, acting as data selector in the VIS/NIR ranges. 
The device performs wavelength division multiplexing 
(WDM) optoelectronic logic functions providing photonic 
functions such as signal amplification, filtering and 
switching. The opto-electrical model with light biasing 
control has proven to be a good tool to design optical filters 
in the VIS/NIR. An optoelectronic model was presented and 
proven to be a good tool to design optical filters in the 
VIS/NIR range.
