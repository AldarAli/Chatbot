Abstract—In order to better solve the problem of low accuracy 
caused by inaccurate word segmentation in the task of 
extracting Chinese medicine named entities, the extraction 
technology relies heavily on the characteristics of manual 
development, and needs guidance of domain knowledge. This 
paper proposes a named entity recognition in the field of 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Based on character 
vectors for Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory with a 
Conditional Random Field (Bidirectional LSTM-CRF). First of 
all, the model uses the word2vec tool to convert the corpus into 
a character vector, which can avoid the influence of inaccurate 
word segmentation in Chinese medicine field on entity 
recognition; then use Bidirectional LSTM neural network to 
extract deep features of sentence level, and reduce the 
workload of manual feature setting in the traditional method; 
Finally access to the CRF layer, and the Viterbi algorithm is 
used to dynamically plan the most reasonable tag output of the 
sentence, and the correlation between the output tags is 
considered. We use different models to conduct experiments on 
the TCM corpus. The results show that the model proposed in 
this paper has a good effect. The F value of the evaluation 
index on the three types of Chinese medicine, prescription and 
syndrome type has reached 90%.

INTRODUCTION 
The knowledge of TCM diagnosis is a historical treasure 
left by the Chinese nation for thousands of years and has a 
strong guiding role in the clinical treatment. In the field of 
traditional Chinese medicine, the forms of expression 
between syndromes, prescriptions and traditional Chinese 
medicines are diverse and complex, and they are used 
throughout the treatment process of Chinese medicine [1][2]. 
In order to construct a knowledge graph of the Chinese 
medicine field and form a structured knowledge, the 
extraction of three types of entities such as syndrome type, 
prescription and traditional Chinese medicine is particularly 
important and a very meaningful step. 
Named entity recognition is a type of problem of 
sequence labeling. It is the basic work of information 
extraction, information retrieval, machine translation and 
other tasks [3]. The current mainstream methods for named 
entity recognition are based on statistical and rule-based 
language model methods [4]. The statistical based method 
automatically extracts the composition law of the named 
entity directly from the text, and identifies the entity through 
the model-trained language model [5]. The statistical method 
for the named entity recognition has a hidden Markov model 
[6] and the conditional random field Model [7]. The rule-
based approach [8] uses the rational knowledge of linguists 
to identify named entities through rules written by linguists. 
Traditional named entity recognition methods require a 
wealth of domain expert knowledge to extract a large 
number of artificial features [8]. 
With the rapid development of deep learning, the 
advantages of neural networks in dealing with natural 
language processing problems have gradually emerged. The 
core technology of deep learning is to express text features in 
the form of word vectors. Zheng et al. [9] proposed using 
neural networks for named entity recognition tasks, and 
using perceptron algorithm for accelerated training models; 
later, Recurrent Neural Network applications appeared in 
sequence labeling problems. Chowdhury et al. [10] The 
Recurrent Neural Network is used for sequence tasks, 
achieving better results and avoiding feature engineering. 
However, it is difficult for recurrent neural networks to 
obtain long distance dependent information, and long 
distance information is lost. In order to solve the problem of 
long distance information dependence. Xu et al.[11] used a 
Bidirectional LSTM neural network and a conditional 
random field method to identify medical names. This method 
takes advantage of LSTM's feature extraction and considers 
the relationship between output tags in combination with 
CRF, making Long Short-Term Memory with a Conditional 
Random Field (LSTM-CRF) model is widely used in 
Chinese named entity recognition tasks [12][13]. However, 
due to the lack of obvious space between Chinese characters, 
word segmentation processing is required, but the current 
word segmentation software is aimed at the general field and 
rarely involves special fields. In order to solve the erroneous 
influence of inaccurate word segmentation on entity 
recognition, Dong et al. [14] used character-level vectors as 
input for deep learning to perform entity recognition, but 
these are all considered in the general field, without 
considering the particularity of the Chinese medicine field.  
There are deficiencies in Chinese word segmentation in 
the field of Chinese medicine. Many Chinese medical terms 
are misclassified. For example, “Yin and Yang deficiency 
syndrome” is a word, and the commonly used word

segmentation tool will divide it into: “Yin and Yang”, “Two” 
and "Deficiency syndrome", this wrong participle will 
seriously affect the entity recognition effect.  
This paper provides a Bidirectional LSTM-CRF named 
entity recognition method based on character vector, which 
lays a foundation for the knowledge graph construction in 
the field of traditional Chinese medicine. By continuously 
adjusting the parameters of the model, until the neural 
network 
parameter 
combination 
suitable 
for 
entity 
recognition in the Chinese medicine field is found, the effect 
of the entity recognition is optimized.  
Section II introduces the model proposed in this paper; 
the model is based on character vector with Bidirectional 
LSTM entity recognition method in the field of traditional 
Chinese medicine. In Section III, the contrast experiment and 
adjustment model parameters are given. It is proved that the 
proposed model in this paper has certain advantages. The 
parameters of LSTM neural network model suitable for 
traditional Chinese medicine are found. Finally, the 
conclusion and future work of this research are found in 
Section IV. 
II. BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM-CRF MODEL BASED ON 
CHARACTER VECTOR 
For the identification of entities in the field of traditional 
Chinese medicine, this paper identifies the three types of 
entities: syndrome type, prescription and traditional Chinese 
medicine, which are marked by two words. B-XX indicates 
the first type of entity, while I-XX indicates other words of 
the entity. The specific label forms of the three types of 
entities are shown in TABLE I. 
As shown in Figure 1, the schematic diagram of the 
character vector based Bidirectional LSTM-CRF TCM 
domain named entity recognition model designed for this 
paper. The model is divided into three parts: the character 
vector layer, the Bidirectional LSTM neural network layer, 
and the CRF tag inference layer. The character vector layer 
converts the input text into a recognizable numerical form of 
the neural network, and then calculates the output feature 
vector 
th  of each character through the bidirectional LSTM 
neural network. The CRF inference layer finds the most 
suitable output tag sequence of the sentence through 
dynamic programming to make up Subsequent to the defect 
that the Softmax output tags are independent of each other.

A. Characters Vector Layer 
The structure of the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model is 
shown in Figure 1. The bottom end of the input is the 
sequence to be labeled "Ma Huang soup contains cassia 
twig", which is the input layer in the figure. Since the neural 
network 
algorithm 
cannot 
directly 
process 
Chinese 
characters, it is necessary to convert the text into a vector 
form. There are two ways to vector the text: one-hot and 
distributed representation. Since the distributed vector 
representation can reduce the dimension of the vector and 
can effectively represent the association between semantics. 
This paper adopts the distributed representation method for 
text vector. The character embedding operation is required 
before entering the model. This article use Google's opening 
source tool word2vec to convert the text into a character 
vector. Suppose the input sentence is S , and the set of

B. Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network Layer 
The LSTM neural network is an improvement to the 
common RNN neural network. Its main purpose is to solve 
the problem of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion. 
The biggest difference from the RNN neural network is the 
neural unit. The neural unit of the LSTM neural network 
joins the gate structure, including the input gate, the output 
gate and the forgetting gate. The neural unit of the LSTM 
neural network is shown in Figure 2.

EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS 
In this section, we mainly verify the validity of the 
application of the Bidirectional LSTM neural network based 
on character vector on the entity extraction task in the field 
of traditional Chinese medicine. 
A. Experiment Data And Evaluation Indicators  
The corpus used in the experiment is the Chinese 
medicine diagnosis text and classic Chinese medicine books 
provided by Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine, such as the TCM syndrome differential diagnosis 
book, a total of 32,700 sentences related to syndromes and 
prescriptions, and Chinese medicine, totaling more than 2 
million character. After many years of clinical experience, 
the corpus has been comprehensively covered with 
information on syndromes, prescriptions, Chinese medicine 
and other related entities. 
In

In order to verify the effect of the proposed character 
vector based Bidirectional LSTM-CRF on TCM entity 
recognition, this paper sets up three sets of comparative 
experiments.  
Experiment 1: The first set of experiments was to 
verify the impact of different algorithms on entity 
recognition in the Chinese medicine field. TABLE III shows 
the experimental results of the CRF model, the Character 
vector based bidirectional LSTM-Softmax model (Char-
BLSTM-Softmax) 
and 
the 
Character 
vector 
based 
Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model (Char-BLSTM-CRF). 
As we saw from the test results in TABLE III, The 
Char-BLSTM-CRF model has the best experimental results, 
which is more than one percentage point higher than the F-
value of the Char-BLSTM-Softmax model. Due to the 
Softmax classifier in the Char-BLSTM-Softmax model does 
not consider the dependencies between the outputs tags, 
CRF classifiers use Viterbi algorithm for dynamic 
programming, the output label path is the most scientific. 
Therefore, the Char-BLSTM-CRF model has a certain 
improvement compared to Char-BLSTM-Softmax. The 
CRF model has the worst experimental results because the 
model requires manual extraction of high quality features. 
This indicates that the character vector based on BLSTM-
CRF model proposed in this paper has a good effect in 
entity recognition in the field of Chinese medicine. 
Experiment 2: This paper constructs the embedding 
vector with character and words. Experiment to verify the 
effect of character and word vector on Bidirectional LSTM-
CRF model. It is further proved that the Bidirectional 
LSTM-CRF entity recognition model based on character 
vector can avoid the influence of inaccurate word 
segmentation on entity recognition in TCM domain. The 
Bidirectional LSTM-CRF entity recognition model based on 
word vector is abbreviated as Word-BLSTM-CRF. The 
experimental results are shown in TABLE IV.  
The experimental performance of the Char-BLSTM-
CRF model is 6 percentage points higher than the Word-
BLSTM-CRF in F value. Because of the Word-BLSTM-
CRF model needs to segment the corpus before labeling, the 
existing word segmentation tools are inaccurate for the 
terminology of the Chinese medicine field, resulting in poor 
experimental results. However, Char-BLSTM-CRF model 
does not need to word segmentation. It labels each character 
to avoid errors caused by inaccurate word segmentation. 
Experiment 3: In experiment 1 and experiment 2, we 
fixed the parameters of the LSTM neural network model. In 
this experiment, by adjusting the parameters, the best 
parameters suitable for the identification of named entities 
in the field of Chinese medicine were found. Parameters that 
can be adjusted include Dropout values, optimizer and 
learning rate.

The Dropout parameter adjustment experiment means 
that the fixed optimizer is Adam; the learning rate is 0.001; 
and the Dropout value ranges from 0.1 to 0.5, and is 
incremented by an integral multiple of 0.1. The 
experimental results are shown in TABLE V. It can be 
clearly seen that when the Dropout value is 0.5, the model 
has the best effect and the F value is the highest. 
The optimizer parameter adjustment experiment refers 
to the fixed Dropout of 0.5, the learning rate is 0.001, and 
the experimental results of the optimizer can select Adam, 
Adagrad, SGD, and Momentum. The experimental results 
are shown in TABLE VI. It can be clearly seen that the 
fixed Dropout and learning rate, the Adam optimizer have 
the fastest convergence and the best results. 
The experimental results of the learning rate parameter 
adjustment are shown in TABLE VII. At this time, the fixed 
Dropout is 0.5, the optimizer is Adam, and the learning rate 
is set to 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001. According to the 
experimental results, when the optimizer and Dropout are 
fixed, learning rate is 0.001, the effect of the model is 
optimal at this time. 
According to the results of the above three sets of 
parameter experiments, the parameter combination of the 
Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model which is most suitable for 
TCM entity identification is Dropout=0.5, the learning rate 
is 0.001, and the optimizer is Adam. At this time, the 
comprehensive performance F value of the model reaches 
90% above, the identification of named entities in the field 
of Chinese medicine has a good effect.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The identification of TCM entities is a basic work in 
the construction of knowledge graph in this field. The main 
work of the article is to focus on this topic. This paper 
proposes a Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model based on 
character vector, which uses character vector as input to 
replace the word vector in traditional deep learning, to avoid 
the influence of inaccurate TCM segmentation on entity 
recognition. 
The 
bidirectional 
LSTM 
with 
context 
information is used as the input. The hidden layer of the 
neural network solves the problem of dependence on long 
text input and mitigates the gradient explosion. Finally, it 
accesses the CRF tag inference layer to solve the 
dependency problem between output tags. In this paper, a 
lot of experiments have been done on the TCM entity 
corpus. The results show that the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF 
model based on character vector is better than other 
algorithms, and the parameters that are most suitable for 
TCM entity recognition are found through experiments. 
However, from the results, the F value of the best 
experimental results in the article is only 91.42%, and there 
is still much room for improvement. In order to seek a 
bigger breakthrough, the future work will focus on the 
establishment of a high-quality corpus. In this process, more 
scholars in the field of Chinese medicine will be introduced 
to participate in the establishment of the corpus, so that the 
work has a better effect.
