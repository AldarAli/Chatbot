Circuit-Switched Voice over Scalable UMTS 
 
Abstract— Scalable Universal Mobile Telecommunications 
System (S-UMTS) carriers occupy bandwidth different than 
regular UMTS carriers and may fit in available spectrum that 
cannot be used by UMTS carriers today. Due to the bandwidth 
scaling, the data rates in S-UMTS are scaled by the bandwidth 
scaling factor compared to regular UMTS for the same physical 
layer configuration. However, some services like Circuit-
Switched (CS) voice needs the same data rate in S-UMTS as in 
regular UMTS. The modified configuration needed in S-UMTS to 
maintain the data rate of such services is proposed. Additionally, 
both uplink and downlink voice capacity in S-UMTS are shown 
to scale with the bandwidth scaling factor.

 INTRODUCTION 
    UMTS has a chip rate of 3.84 Megachips per second (Mcps) 
and a nominal 5 MHz channel bandwidth. Many operators 
own spectrum that is non 5 MHz multiples, creating unusable 
narrow-bandwidth fragments where a 5 MHz carrier cannot be 
accommodated. Fig. 1 shows an example where a regular 
UMTS carrier may not fit the available spectrum between two 
UMTS carriers while a S-UMTS carrier occupying less than 5 
MHz may fit.

   This paper focuses on generating a S-UMTS carrier by 
scaling down the chip rate with respect to a regular UMTS 
carrier. Hence, such a S-UMTS carrier occupies smaller 
bandwidth than a regular UMTS carrier. Accordingly, the chip 
duration is increased or “dilated” by the same factor. For 
example, to generate a 2.5 MHz S-UMTS carrier, the chip rate 
is reduced by a factor of 2 from 3.84 Mcps to 1.92 Mcps. In S-
UMTS due to the time dilation, chip duration, slot duration, 
frame duration, sub frame duration, and Transmission Time 
Interval (TTI) get scaled up, i.e., dilated by a factor of Dcr 
which is the chip rate divisor (Dcr =2 for 2.5 MHz S-UMTS). 
Hence, the data rate in S-UMTS gets scaled down by the same 
factor Dcr compared to regular UMTS. The same Power 
Spectral Density (PSD) is assumed for S-UMTS and UMTS.  
 
S-UMTS has the same link budget as UMTS and thus 
maintains the same coverage. S-UMTS parameters with 
respect to regular UMTS are shown in TABLE I.

    The scaling down of data rate in S-UMTS poses a challenge 
to support services like CS voice using the same vocoder 
where the service needs to maintain the same data rate as in 
regular UMTS. The support for 12.2 kbps Adaptive Multi-
Rate (AMR) over 2.5 MHz (Dcr=2) S-UMTS is discussed in 
this paper. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section II discusses the configurations for supporting AMR 
12.2 kbps over regular UMTS; Section III discusses the 
changes in configurations needed for supporting AMR 12.2 
kbps over Dcr=2 S-UMTS; Section IV shows that the voice 
capacity of S-UMTS scales with the bandwidth while Section 
V concludes the paper.    
II. 
FULL RATE AMR 12.2KBPS VOICE OVER UMTS 
 
     Full rate AMR corresponds to bit rate 12.2 kbps, namely 
“Conversational / speech / UL:12.2 DL:12.2 kbps / CS RAB + 
UL:3.4 DL:3.4 kbps SRBs for DCCH”, as defined in [1], 
Section 6.10.2.2. Every 20 ms, the AMR vocoder produces a 
set of voice frames designated Class-A, Class-B, and Class-C. 
The Class-A bit sequence is the most important, is CRC 
protected and convolutionally encoded at rate 1/3. The Class-
B does not have a CRC, but is encoded at the same rate of 1/3 
as Class-A. The Class-C is the least important, which does not 
have a CRC and only encoded at rate 1/2. Each class is 
mapped to a separate Radio Access Bearer (RAB) subflow, 
which is then mapped to a separate Dedicated Traffic Channel 
(DTCH logical channel). The 3 DTCHs operate in Radio Link 
Control (RLC) Transparent Mode (TM) with a maximum 
Service Data Unit (SDU) size of 81, 103, and 60 bits 
respectively. The configuration for the DTCH carrying Class 
A bits also allows a SDU size of 39 bits for the Silence 
Indicator Descriptor (SID) and 0 bits for a Null frame. 
Medium Access Control (MAC) maps each DTCH directly

onto the associated Dedicated Channel (DCH transport 
channel) without adding a header. Using a TTI of 20 ms, half 
of the MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) is transmitted during 
one radio frame (10 ms), and the other half is transmitted 
during the next radio frame. 
        
    There are four DCCHs allocated to carry control plane 
signaling, two for Radio Resource Control (RRC) and two for 
Non Access Stratum (NAS). MAC multiplexes the four 
DCCHs onto a single DCH, adding a header containing the 
C/T (Control/Traffic) field to identify the logical channel from 
which the data was sent. The DCH is CRC protected and 
convolutionally encoded at rate 1/3. Using a 40 ms TTI, the 
MAC PDU is distributed over four radio frames, concatenated 
with the blocks from the voice DCHs. Therefore, there are 
four Signaling Radio Bearers (SRBs) for RRC and NAS 
signaling and one RAB for voice. The mapping is as follows: 
• 4 SRBs → 4 DCCHs → 1 DCH using 40 ms TTI 
• 1 RAB → 3 DTCHs → 3 DCHs using 20 ms TTI 
 
    Fig. 2 shows the transport channel procedure for “AMR DL: 
12.2 kbps RAB + DL: 3.4 kbps SRB” in UMTS. 
 
 
Figure 2.  TrCH procedure for “AMR DL: 12.2 kbps RAB + DL: 3.4 kbps 
SRB” in UMTS 
  
    The individual TrCHs are broken from their TTI into 10 ms 
frames. These frames are then serially multiplexed into a 
Coded Composite Transport Channel (CCTrCH). Thus each 
CCTrCH contains a portion of the AMR Class-A, Class-B, 
and Class-C bit sequences, plus a portion of the signaling 
information. A downlink Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH) 
with 60 kbps is allocated to carry one CCTrCH. A second 
round of interleaving is done on the CCTrCh. The 510 coded 
bits per radio frame include CRC and tail bits, rate 1/2 or 1/3 
bits-to-coded bits coding, and rate matching (RM). Then the 
coded bits go through serial-to-parallel conversion and are 
placed onto a 30 ksps Dedicated Physical Data Channel 
(DPDCH).  Fig. 3 shows the transport channel multiplexing 
and mapping to physical channels for “AMR DL: 12.2 kbps 
RAB + DL: 3.4 kbps SRB” in UMTS. It is to be noted that the 
Fig. 2 and 3 are for one of the six transport format 
combinations (TFCs) as specified in [1], Section 6.10.2.4.1.4:

FULL RATE AMR 12.2KBPS VOICE OVER S-UMTS 
(DCR=2) 
 
   The physical layer configuration for AMR voice service in 
regular UMTS (e.g., up to Rel-11) no longer meets the 
required data rate for AMR 12.2 kbps in S-UMTS. On the 
other hand, supporting full rate AMR (12.2kbps) is a 
requirement for many infra vendors and operators. The 
proposed solution to facilitate the support of CS voice over S-
UMTS uses  
a) SF reduction  
b) TTI inverse scaling 
 
 
Figure 4.  TrCH procedure for “AMR DL: 12.2 kbps RAB + DL: 3.4 kbps 
SRB” in Dcr=2 S-UMTS 
 
    Fig. 4 shows the transport channel procedure for “AMR DL: 
12.2 kbps RAB + DL: 3.4 kbps SRB” in Dcr=2 S-UMTS. For 
12.2 kbps AMR, one voice frame is still mapped to a 20 ms 
time window upon transmission, irrespective of Dcr in S-
UMTS. To meet the requirements, SF reduction by Dcr in both 
DL and UL is proposed along with the following mapping 
 
•4 SRBs → 4 DCCHs → 1 DCH using 20 x Dcr, i.e., 20 x 2 
ms = 40 ms TTI 
•1 RAB → 3 DTCHs → 3 DCHs using 10 x Dcr, i.e., 10 x 2 
ms = 20 ms TTI 
 
   It is to be noted, that 10 x Dcr ms and 20 x Dcr ms TTI in S-
UMTS correspond to 10 ms and 20 ms TTI respectively in 
regular UMTS except the time dilation in S-UMTS by Dcr.

DCCH TTI are broken into two 20 ms radio frames. TABLE

DPCCH and DPDCH are time multiplexed as DPCH, and use

   The modified version of slot format 8 for Dcr=2 S-UMTS in

the timing and bit requirements of AMR 12.2 kbps are the 
same, the SF is reduced to increase the bits/slot and bits/frame 
accordingly. However, the channel bitrate or channel symbol 
rate stays unchanged as time is dilated for Dcr=2 S-UMTS. 
The RM tuning method also stays unchanged in Dcr=2 S-
UMTS as compared to regular UMTS. The slot format 8B in 
TABLE X does not correspond to any slot format in regular 
UMTS.

  The slot formats 2 and 3 for Dcr=2 S-UMTS in TABLE XI 
correspond to slot formats 3 and 4 respectively for UMTS in 
TABLE V for UL DPDCH. For Dcr=2 S-UMTS, as there is 
less bandwidth while the timing and bit requirements of AMR 
12.2 kbps are the same, the SF is reduced to increase the 
bits/slot and bits/frame accordingly.  However, the channel 
bitrate or channel symbol rate stays unchanged as time is 
dilated for Dcr=2 S-UMTS. The RM tuning method also stays 
unchanged. The slot formats 0, 0A and 0B for Dcr=2 S-UMTS 
in TABLE XII correspond to slot formats 0, 0A and 0B 
respectively for UMTS in TABLE VI for UL DPDCH. For UL 
DPCCH, all slot formats have SF 256. Hence, the bits/slot and 
bits/frame stays the same and channel bitrate and channel 
symbol rates are scaled down by Dcr. As a result, the Transmit 
Power Control (TPC) rate is reduced from 1500Hz in UMTS 
to 1500/ Dcr, i.e., 750 Hz in Dcr=2 S-UMTS.

from its TTI into 10 x Dcr ms, i.e., 20 ms frames. These frames 
are then serially multiplexed into a Coded Composite 
Transport Channel (CCTrCH). Thus, each CCTrCH contains 
an AMR Class-A, B, and C bit sequences, plus a portion of the 
signaling information. A downlink DPCH with 120/Dcr, i.e., 
120/2=60 kbps is allocated to carry one CCTrCH. A second 
round of interleaving is done on the CCTrCh. The 510 x Dcr, 
i.e., 1020 coded bits per radio frame include CRC and tail bits, 
rate 1/2 or 1/3 bits-to-coded bits coding, and RM. Then the 
coded bits go through serial-to-parallel conversion and are 
placed onto a 60/ Dcr, i.e., 60/2=30 ksps DPDCH.

    RM is done before radio frame segmentation in the DL for 
UMTS. For Dcr=2, radio frame segmentation is not needed for 
TrCh# A, TrCh# B and TrCh# C. At this point, the number of 
bits are exactly equal for UMTS and Dcr=2 S-UMTS as there 
is no difference in processing till radio frame segmentation. As 
a result, RM attributes stay the same for Dcr=2 S-UMTS as in 
UMTS.  For the RM example earlier shown in TABLE VII, 
the DL slot format is 8 (modified) with SF 64 (TABLE X). 
There are (12+56) x 15=1020 data bits in a 10 x Dcr, i.e., 20 
ms radio frame. The RM attributes, the channel coded bits and 
bits after RM for the four transport channels stay the same as 
in TABLE VII. Using the TTI of each of the four transport 
channels, the above bits match 1020, i.e., 312 + 328 + 166 + 
428/2 = 1020. 
 
A. Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI) 
 
a) Blind Transport Format Detection for Dcr=2 S-UMTS 
DL 
    In UMTS, Blind Transport Format Detection (BTFD) is 
used for “AMR DL: 12.2 kbps RAB + DL: 3.4 kbps SRB” as 
DL slot format 8 with SF 128 as shown in TABLE IV has no 
TFCI. BTFD is used in UMTS DL for AMR voice because if 
the TFCI field is sent, the SF would have to be lower and 
lower SFs for voice provide a greater potential to run out of 
Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) codes. For 
Dcr=2, the modified slot format 8 as shown in TABLE X also 
has no TFCI. Section 4.3.1 of [3] puts a number of restrictions 
that need to be fulfilled for BTFD. In order to allow BTFD for 
AMR 12.2 kbps for Dcr=2 S-UMTS, the following restriction 
needs to be changed. 
• 
the number of CCTrCH bits received per radio frame 
is 600 x Dcr or less instead of 600. 
 
b) UL TFCI 
     
    There are 32 TFCI encoded bits that needs to be transmitted 
at least once every 20ms, i.e., every voice frame.  TFCI is 
encoded using a (32, 10) sub-code of the second order Reed-
Muller code [3]. If the TFCI consists of less than 10 bits, it is 
padded with zeroes to 10 bits, by setting the most significant 
bits to zero. The bits of the 32 bit TFCI code word are directly 
mapped to the slots of the radio frame. Within a slot the bit 
with lower index is transmitted before the bit with higher 
index. The coded bits  are mapped to the transmitted TFCI 
bits  according to the following formula: 
 
 = 32  
 
                        (2) 
 
     For uplink physical channels regardless of the SF, bits 
 and   of the TFCI code word are not transmitted. Using 
slot format 0 in TABLE XII, there are 2x15 =30 TFCI 
encoded bits every frame duration of 10 x Dcr, i.e., 20ms. 
Therefore, bits b30 and b31 of the TFCI code word are not 
transmitted. For uplink compressed mode, the slot format is 
changed so that no TFCI coded bits are lost [3]. The different 
slot formats in compressed mode do not match the exact 
number of TFCI coded bits for all possible Transmission Gap 
Lengths (TGL). Repetition of the TFCI bits is therefore used. 
 
B. TPC and Pilot 
 
    For the TPC and pilot bits in DL, the patterns defined in [2], 
are used. Similarly, for the TPC and pilot bits in UL, the 
patterns defined in [2], are used. 
 
C. Transmission Power 
   
   Generally, a reduction in SF has impacts on the link budget. 
In order to maintain the same voice service coverage, the UE  
and NodeB need to increase the transmission power according 
to the chosen SF. The baseline assumption is that the Power 
Spectral Density (PSD) remains the same in both uplink and 
downlink for UMTS and S-UMTS. Since the S-UMTS 
bandwidth is 1/Dcr of that of regular UMTS, the total transmit 
power of S-UMTS is also 1/Dcr of the transmit power of 
regular UMTS. However, for supporting AMR voice, this has 
been relaxed. In the DL, the total transmit power of S-UMTS 
133

is still assumed to 1/Dcr of the transmit power of regular 
UMTS and hence, same PSD remains for S-UMTS. However, 
the transmit power for each voice channel is same in S-UMTS 
and in regular UMTS. In the UL, the UE transmit power in S-
UMTS is assumed to be the same as that in regular UMTS. In 
other words, the transmit power in S-UMTS for AMR in both 
UL and DL is increased by 10#$10(&'() dB w.r.t. same 
PSD to compensate for SF reduction.   
 
D. Latency  
     
    Once the first voice frame (equivalently 20 ms long) is 
available at the MAC, it will be delivered to the PHY. After 
some PHY layer processing (assuming processing time does 
not scale with Dcr), the over-the-air transmission is allowed to 
start only at the next radio frame boundary due to the current 
specification restriction. However, for Dcr=2 S-UMTS, as the 
TTI is 10 x Dcr =20 ms and the radio frame is also 10 x Dcr 
=20 ms, there is no additional latency compared to regular 
UMTS. For Dcr > 2, there would be additional latency due to 
TTI (10 x Dcr) being greater than 20 ms. 
IV. 
VOICE CAPACITY 
The voice capacity in the uplink and downlink are compared 
between UMTS and S-UMTS in A and B respectively. 
A. 
Uplink Capacity 
 
The upper bound of the uplink capacity, referred to as the pole 
capacity (*+,-.) of a UMTS carrier, can be estimated using the 
standard uplink capacity equation [8]

? = Voice Activity Factor (VAF) 
∝ = Interference factor (ratio between the other cell 
interference power and the total received signal power of users 
in the cell) 
Note:  VAF depends on the vocoder, channel coding etc. and 
is typically considered as 60% 
 
 The pole capacity is obtained by assuming that the user 
equipment (UE) has infinite transmission power and the 
interference at the Node-B receiver goes to infinity. For a 
practical system, both the UE transmission power and the 
node-B receiver allowed interference level are limited and the 
operating point is set well below the pole capacity. This 
operating point is referred to as the uplink loading and is 
defined as the percentage of the pole capacity. From the pole 
capacity, a practical cell capacity (Nuser,η) for a system can 
be calculated after the uplink loading (η) has been determined, 
as shown in (3).

         (6) 
      The link efficiency for S-UMTS is same as the link 
efficiency for UMTS as seen from (6). Hence, S-UMTS 
maintains the coverage of UMTS. Therefore, in (3) for pole 
capacity in uplink, everything remain same for S-UMTS as in 
UMTS except  : that changes from 3.84 MHz in regular 
UMTS to 1.92 MHz for Dcr=2 S-UMTS. The uplink loading 
(η) is also assumed to be same for S-UMTS. As a result, for 
the same loading factor, the uplink cell capacity for voice 
services is inversely proportional to the value of Dcr according 
to (3) and (4). 
 
B. 
Downlink Capacity 
 
  In the downlink as well, the pole capacity can be interpreted 
as the maximum capacity with infinite base station power. The 
following equation is used or the downlink pole capacity

Q = Interference factor (ratio between the other cell

multipath effect and the limitations of the rake receiver)  
 
Note:  Cell geometry is the inverse of Q  
            
   The overhead channel power is the power for the overhead 
channels in UMTS and S-UMTS, e.g., Primary and Secondary 
Synchronization Channels, Primary Common Pilot Channel, 
Primary Common Control Physical Channel, Secondary 
Common Control Physical Channel, Paging Indicator Channel 
etc. In S-UMTS, the overhead scales with the bandwidth and 
hence, S-UMTS has the same signaling overhead percentage 
as UMTS.

  In (7), everything except W remains same for S-UMTS as in 
UMTS. Hence, the downlink cell capacity for voice services is 
inversely proportional to the value of Dcr. Thus, a trade-off can 
be achieved in S-UMTS between data rate, power and 
capacity. For services that need to maintain the same data rate 
over S-UMTS as in UMTS, the capacity is scaled down by Dcr 
in S-UMTS while for other services, the capacity is unchanged 
but data rate is scaled down by Dcr in S-UMTS as shown 
TABLE I and TABLE XIII. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
 
    S-UMTS carriers occupy different bandwidth than regular 
UMTS carriers and may fit in spectrum where regular UMTS 
carrier cannot fit. Solutions for supporting full rate AMR (12.2 
Kbps) over Dcr=2 S-UMTS have been proposed with no 
additional delay. As S-UMTS uses the same vocoder, it offers 
the same voice quality as regular UMTS. The proposed 
solution can be extended for other AMR rates and also for 
other S-UMTS Dcr values. It is also shown that the voice 
capacity for S-UMTS scales with the bandwidth. As the 
system bandwidth in S-UMTS is scaled by the bandwidth 
scaling factor Dcr, S-UMTS UL and DL voice capacity are 
also scaled by the same factor Dcr compared to regular UMTS.
