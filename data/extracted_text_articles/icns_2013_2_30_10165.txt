Abstract—A virtual network reconﬁguration is one efﬁcient
approach to accommodate the trafﬁc that changes signiﬁcantly.
By reconﬁguring the virtual network, the network accommodates
the trafﬁc even when the trafﬁc pattern changes signiﬁcantly.
The reconﬁgure has a large impact on the trafﬁc passing the
reconﬁgured paths. Thus, the number of reconﬁgured paths
should be minimized. The number of reconﬁgured paths depends
on the virtual network topology before the reconﬁguration, and
some topology requires a large number of reconﬁgured paths to
handle the trafﬁc changes. In this paper, we investigate the virtual
network topology, which can handle signiﬁcant trafﬁc changes by
reconﬁguring only a small number of paths. To investigate the
virtual network, we propose a index based on the evolution model
in the changing environments. We evaluate our index through
simulation, and clarify that our index indicates the adaptability
of virtual networks. We also compare our index with betweenness
centrality, and clarify that our index identiﬁes the virtual network
with high adaptability to trafﬁc changes more accurately.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, various new applications have been de-
ployed over the Internet. Such application leads the increase
of the trafﬁc amount and the unpredictable trafﬁc changes
[1]. A network must accommodate such a time-varying traf-
ﬁc efﬁciently. However, accommodating time-varying trafﬁc
efﬁciently is difﬁcult, because even if a backbone network
suitable for the current trafﬁc is constructed, the backbone
network becomes no longer suitable to trafﬁc after the trafﬁc
change.
One approach to accommodate such a large time-varying
trafﬁc is to reconﬁgure the virtual network. Several methods
to reconﬁgure the virtual network have been proposed [2],
[3], [4]. In these methods, a virtual network is constructed
over the optical network, which is constructed of the optical
cross connects (OXCs) and IP routers. In this optical network,
each outbound port of an edge IP router is connected to
an OXC port. Lightpaths (hereafter called optical paths) are
established between two IP routers by conﬁguring OXCs along
the route between the routers. A set of routers and optical paths
between the routers forms a virtual network. Trafﬁc between
two routers is carried over the virtual network using IP layer
routing. In this network, the virtual network is reconﬁgured
dynamically by adding or deleting optical paths so as to suite
the current trafﬁc.
In case of signiﬁcant trafﬁc change, a large number of
optical paths may be required to be added to accommodate
the trafﬁc after the change. However, adding a large number
of optical paths may take a large overheadbecause we require
setting OXCs for each optical path.
One approach to avoid adding a large number of optical
paths is to construct an adaptive virtual network, which can
handle any trafﬁc change by adding a small number of optical
paths in advance. Thus, we investigate the adaptive virtual
network.
There are several metrics of the network topology. The
betweenness centrality of a link [5] indicates the probability
that trafﬁc from a source node to a destination node passes the
link. The link criticality [6], [7] is obtained by dividing the
betweenness centrality by the bandwidth of the link. The link
whose betweenness centrality or link criticality is high may be
passed by a large amount of trafﬁc. Thus, the topology with
links with high betweenness centrality or link criticality is easy
to be congested. However, these indices do not indicate the
number of optical paths required to be added when congestions
occur.
In this paper, we propose an index that identiﬁes the adap-
tive virtual network that can handle signiﬁcant trafﬁc changes
by adding only a small number of optical paths. To propose
the index, we are inspired by the natural lifeforms that survive
and evolve in the case of signiﬁcant environmental changes.
The natural lifefroms are modeled [8] as a suite of functions,
which synthesizes products from environmental resources. In
this model, each individual dies if enough products for survival
cannot be generated, while it duplicates itself and evolves if
enough products are generated.
We model the virtual network by the similar way to the
natural lifeforms, and propose an index called ﬂow inclusive
relation modularity (FIRM).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we explain the characteristics of the lifeforms, which survive
and evolve under signiﬁcant environmental changes. Then,
inspired by the characteristics of the natural lifeforms, we
propose an index that identiﬁes the adaptive virtual network.
In Section III, we mention the steps to evaluate our index. In
Section IV, we show the result of the evaluation. Finally, we
conclude and mention about future work in Section V.

II. ADAPTABILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND
MODULARITY
A. Environmental Changes and Modularity in Lifeforms
Lipson et al. [8] clariﬁed one of the characteristics of the
lifeforms that survive and evolve under signiﬁcant environ-
mental changes through simulations. They modeled individuals
as a suite of functions, which synthesizes products from
environmental resources as shown in Fig. 1. In this model,
each individual dies if enough products for survival cannot
be generated, while it duplicates itself and evolves if enough
products are generated. Through the simulation using this
model, they investigated the characteristics of lifeforms that
can survive and evolve in signiﬁcant environmental changes.
Among the characteristics of the lifeforms, they focus on the
relationship between functions. Each function consumes some
resources and generate products. The relationship between
functions exists when those functions consumes the same
resources or when those functions carries out or blocks the
production of the same product. By using the relationship,
they deﬁne the index called modularity, which is deﬁned by
the number of groups after dividing the functions into groups
that includes the related functions. According to the results of
Lipson et al. [8], the lifeforms with higher modularity survive
and evolve. In addition, the lifeforms evolves so as to have
higher modularity.
When the modularity is high, functions belonging to the
different modules have only a small impact on each other.
Thus, the environmental changes on the functions in a module
do not affect the other functions in the other modules. As a
result, the individuals with the large modularity survive and
evolve in the environmental changes.
B. Trafﬁc Changes and Modularity in Virtual Network Oper-
ation
Inspired by the lifeforms that survive and evolve in the
signiﬁcant environmental changes, we model the virtual net-
work, and propose an index that identiﬁes the virtual network
that can handle signiﬁcant trafﬁc changes by adding a small
number of optical paths.
1) Functions in Virtual Network: The function of the virtual
network is to accommodate trafﬁc. We model this function
of the virtual network, as shown in Fig. 2. In this model, a

virtual network accommodates trafﬁc demands by assigning
trafﬁc demands with links. When the utilizations of all links
are less than the threshold, we regard the virtual network as
being operated properly.
The model shown in Fig. 2 is similar to the model of
lifeforms shown in Fig. 1. The trafﬁc demands of the model
in Fig. 2 correspond to the resources of the model in Fig. 1.
Therefore, applying the results of the lifeforms, a virtual
network whose functions have large modularity may be adap-
tive to the signiﬁcant trafﬁc changes. Thus, in this paper, we
deﬁne the modularity of the functions of the virtual network,
and investigate the relationship between the modularity and the
number of optical paths required to be added to accommodate
signiﬁcant trafﬁc change.
2) Relationships between Functions in Virtual Network: To
deﬁne a modularity of a virtual network, we need to deﬁne
the relationship among the functions in the virtual network. In
this paper, the function of the virtual network is modeled as
the suite of the function that accommodates each ﬂow passing
between source and destination nodes. In this subsection, we
deﬁne the relationship between functions. There are several
approaches to deﬁne the relationship between functions. For
example, one approach is to regard the functions related to
the ﬂows passing the same link as the related functions. In
this paper, we focus on the close relationship between the
functions. We deﬁne the relationship as follows; the functions
for ﬂow A and for ﬂow B is regarded to have the relationship
if the all links passed by the ﬂow A are also passed by the ﬂow
B. Hereafter, we call this relationship ﬂow inclusive relation
(FIR).
As shown in Fig. 3, FIR is described as a graph where a
vertex is deﬁned for each ﬂow. The vertices are connected with
edges if their corresponding functions have FIR. Hereafter, we
call this graph ﬂow inclusive relation graph, and call its vertices
ﬂow nodes.
3) Flow Inclusive Relation Modularity: Applying the re-
sults of Lipson et al. [8] to the virtual network, the virtual
network with high modularity has strong adaptability to en-
vironmental changes. In this paper, we deﬁne the modularity
by the modularity of the ﬂow inclusive graph calculated by
the method proposed by Newman [9]. Hereafter, we call this
modularity the ﬂow inclusive relation modularity (FIRM).

denser inner-module edges and sparser inter-module edges.
Newman [9] proposed a method to divide a given network
into modules so as to achieve higher modularity. This method
recursively divides a network into two modules so as to
maximize the modularity until the division no longer increases
the modularity.
In this paper, we obtain a ﬂow inclusive relation modularity
of the virtual network by applying this method [9]. The
obtained ﬂow inclusive relation modularity indicates whether
the functions of the network are divided into groups so that
each group includes the functions closely related to each other.
In the network with the large ﬂow inclusive relation mod-
ularity, several ﬂows are closely related. If the congestion
occurs, the congestion is mitigated by adding an optical path
to the node pair which are the source and destination node
of a ﬂow passing the congested links, and changing the route
of the ﬂows. Moreover, the congestion of the other links may
also be mitigated, because adding the optical path enables the
route change of the other ﬂows belonging to the same module.
As a result, the congestion of all links may be mitigated by
adding a small number of paths.
III. EVALUATION METHOD
A. Overview of the Evaluation Method
In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between the ﬂow
inclusive relation modularity of a virtual network and the
number of optical paths required to be added to accommodate
signiﬁcant trafﬁc changes. In our evaluation, we perform the
following steps. First, we prepare some initial virtual networks
having various ﬂow inclusive relation modularities. We calcu-
late the ﬂow inclusive relation modularities of initial virtual
networks. Then we generate the trafﬁc changes by randomly
generating the trafﬁc, and reconﬁgure the virtual network so
as to accommodate the trafﬁc. We count the number of optical
paths added to accommodate the trafﬁc.
In this evaluation, we generate 10 patterns of trafﬁc matrices
for each initial virtual network.
In the rest of this section, we describe the details of
the generation method of initial virtual networks and trafﬁc
matrices, and the reconﬁguration method of virtual network
used in the evaluation.
B. The Generation Method of Initial Virtual Networks
In order to generate initial virtual networks with various
FIRMs, we use a method to generate topologies with various
modularity proposed by Hidaka [10]. This method uses the
number of groups n and probability parameter p as inputs,
and generates the topology by the following steps.
First, this method generates n groups and locate one node
in each group. The nodes are connected so as to form a ring.
Then, this method adds the nodes. When adding a node, the
group of the node is selected randomly. The additional node
is connected to one node randomly selected from the nodes
in the group. Furthermore, an edge between the additional
node and the node which belongs to other group is added
with probability p or an edge between the additional node and
the node in the same group is added with probability (1 − p).
This method generates various topologies depending on the
value p.
In this paper, we generate 255 initial virtual networks by
changing the parameter p from 0.00 to 1.00 at 0.02 intervals.
We set the number of nodes to 49 and the number of groups
to 5.
C. The Generation Method of Trafﬁc Matrices
Antoniou et al. [11] monitored the trafﬁc in ISPs and
clariﬁes that the trafﬁc between source and destination router
pairs follows a log normal distribution. Thus, in this paper,
we generate trafﬁc matrices so as to follow the lognormal
distrubution, whose parameters are set to the same value as
the results by Antoniou et al. [11].
D. The Reconﬁguration Method of Virtual Netowrks
In this paper, we use a reconﬁguration method based on the
method proposed by Genc¸ata et al. [4]. This method continues
to add optical paths until the utilizations of all links become
lower than the threshold Th.
30

In this paper, we use a method that accommodates the trafﬁc
by a small number of optical paths. To make the number of
optical paths required to be added small, we add the optical
paths where we can minimize the maximum link utilization.
The reconﬁguration method performs the following steps.
1) Calculate all the utilizations of links. Denote the maxi-
mum link utilization as L.
2) If L ≤ Th the reconﬁguration is over. Otherwise go 3.
3) For each node pair, calculate the maximum link utiliza-
tion when the optical path between the pair is added.
4) Add the lightpath between the node pair that minimizes
the maximum link utilization. Then go back to 1.
In the above steps, we calculate the routes over the virtual
network by CSPF. To avoid a large overhead, when adding an
optical path, we change only the routes of the ﬂows passing
the link whose utilization is larger than Th.
IV. EVALUATION RESULT
A. Relation between Flow Inclusive Relation Modularity and
the Number of Added Paths
Fig. 4 shows the relation between the ﬂow inclusive relation
modularity and the number of added paths. In this ﬁgure,
the horizontal axis indicates FIRMs of each virtual network,
and the vertical axis indicates the number of added paths
of each virtual network. Each circle indicates the average
number of added paths and each error bar indicates the 68.27%
conﬁdence interval of the added paths.
From Fig. 4, there are negative correlation between the
FIRM and the number of added paths except for 2 virtual net-
works, which do not contain links with utilization larger than
Th. This is because adding an optical path between a source
and destination nodes of a ﬂow whose corresponding function
belongs to a module mitigates not only the congestions of the
links passed by the ﬂow but also the congestions of the links
passed by the ﬂows whose corresponding functions belong to
the same module.
The modules in the ﬂow inclusive relation graph correspond
to the cohesion of ﬂows passing the same links. If the FIR in
the module is close, by adding an optical path between the
source node and destination node of a ﬂow in the module, we
change not only the routes of the ﬂow but also the routes of
the other ﬂows in the same module. As a result, by adding a
small number of optical paths, all of the congestions may be
mitigated. On the other hand, if the FIRM is low, a large
number of optical paths are required to be added because
the number of ﬂows whose routes can be changed by adding
optical paths is small.
B. Comparison with Betweenness
In this subsection, we compare the FIRM with the between-
ness centrality. The betweenness centrality of a link indicates
the probability that the congestion occur at the link. In this
subsection, we investigate the maximum betweenness central-
ity among all links. Fig. 5 shows the relation between the
maximum betweenness centrality and the number of optical
paths required to be added. In this ﬁgure, the horizontal axis

indicates the maximum betweenness centrality of each virtual
network, and the vertical axis indicates the number of added
paths of each virtual network.
From Fig. 5, there are the positive relation between the
maximum betweenness centrality and the number of optical
paths required to be added. This is because the virtual network
with the smaller maximum betweenness centrality has less
possibility to congest. Therefore, in the virtual network with
the small maximum betweenness centrality, few links are
congested, and the number of optical paths required to be
added is small.
However, the above discussion does not indicates that
the virtual network with the smaller maximum betweenness
centrality is adaptive to any trafﬁc changes by adding only
a small number of optical paths. If the trafﬁc changes more
signiﬁcantly, the number of the congested links becomes large.
Even in this case, the virtual network should accommodate
trafﬁc by adding only a small number of optical paths.
Therefore, we focus on virtual networks having the mul-
tiple congested links. In this comparison, we use the virtual
networks whose maximum betweenness centralities are from
0.4 to 0.5. In this comparison, we also exclude the virtual net-
works with the larger maximum betweenness centralities than
0.5, because the virtual network with the large betweenness
centrality should not be constructed, because it is too easy to
be congested.
Fig. 6 shows the relations between the ﬂow inclusive
relation modularity or the maximum betweenness centrality
and the number of optical paths required to be added, among
the virtual networks whose maximum betweenness centralities
are from 0.4 to 0.5. There is clearly observable negative
correlation in Fig. 6a. On the other hand, several virtual
networks have the similar maximum betweenness centralities,
but have various numbers of added optical paths. This is
because the maximum betweenness centrality identiﬁes only
the virtual network easy to congest and cannot identify the
virtual networks that handle trafﬁc changes by adding only a

C. Evaluation Result with False Negative Rate and False
Positive Rate
To evaluate the relation between the ﬂow inclusive modu-
larity and the number of optical paths required to be added
more clearly, we investigate the accuracy of the method to
identify the virtual network that only a small number of
additional optical paths to handle trafﬁc changes. In this
evaluation, we use the following method to identify the virtual
networks based on the ﬂow inclusive relation modularity or
the maximum betweenness centrality. In the case of FIRM,
we set a threshold to the FIRM, and identify a network with
FIRM higher than the threshold as the network that requires
only a small number of additional optical paths. In the case of
maximum betweenness centrality, we identify a network with
the maximum betweenness centrality lower than the threshold
as the network that requires only a small number of additional
paths.
In this paper, we use the false negative rate (FNR) and the
false positive rate (FPR) as metrics to evaluate the accuracy.
FNR is deﬁned by
FNR = mfn/mp,
(2)
where mp is the number of virtual networks whose average
numbers of additional paths are less than a certain threshold
Rgoal, and mfn is the number of virtual networks which are
identiﬁed as the virtual networks that require more than Rth
additional optical paths but require only less than Rth addi-
tional optical paths. Similarly, the false positive rate (FPR)
is deﬁned by
FPR = mfp/mn,
(3)
where mn is the number of virtual networks whose average
numbers of additional paths are more than a certain threshold
Rth, and mfp is the number of virtual networks which are
identiﬁed as the virtual networks that require less than Rth

optical paths.
In this section, we investigated the relationship between
FNR and FPR of virtual netwoks with the maximum be-
tweenness centrality from 0.4 to 0.5, changing the threshold
for each index. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between FNR
and FPR in the case of FIRM. In Fig. 7, Rth is set to 10.
The horizontal axis indicates the FNR, and the vertical axis
indicates the FPR.
In the same manner, Fig. 8 shows the relationship between
FNR and FPR in the case of maximum betweenness cen-
trality. In Fig. 8, Rth is set to 10. The horizontal axis indicates
the FNR, and the vertical axis indicates the FPR.
Comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 8, the method using FIRM
achieves both lower FNR and lower FPR at the same
time. This result means that FIRM identiﬁes virtual networks,
which can accommodate signiﬁcant trafﬁc changes with less
additional paths more accurately. Therefore, to construct the
adaptive virtual network that can handle signiﬁcant trafﬁc
changes by adding only a small number of optical paths, we

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed the ﬂow inclusive relation modu-
larity (FIRM) as an index to identify the virtual network, which
can handle signiﬁcant trafﬁc changes by reconﬁguring only
a small number of optical paths. Through the evaluation of
relationship between the FIRM and the number of optical paths
required to be added, we clariﬁed that the FIRM identiﬁes the
virtual networks, which can accommodate any trafﬁc changes
with a small number of additional paths. Our future work
includes a method to construct virtual networks with the large
FIRM. For example, if the virtual network has low adaptability
and the link utilization are increasing, some optical paths
should be added to increase the FIRM so as to increase the
adaptability to future trafﬁc increases. On the other hand,
if the link utilization is sufﬁciently low, some optical paths
should be deleted to release the resources so as to be used by
the future reconﬁguration. When deleting the optical paths,
by considering the FIRM, we keep the adaptability to trafﬁc
changes.
