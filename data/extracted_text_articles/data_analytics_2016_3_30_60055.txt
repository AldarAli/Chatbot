Abstract - In this study, we evaluate different
effective factors related to marketing and sales and
discuss the various prediction methods. The field of this
study is the car industry and the tools used for
classification, comparison and weight determination is
the
Analytical
Hierarchy
Process
(AHP).
Artificial
Neural
Networks
are
used
for
identifying
the
architecture and shaping the process of prediction. In
order to do so, using a questionnaire presented to
experts in the field, the factors affecting car sales in
North
America
were
identified
and
the
processed
weights obtained from these opinions were fed to the
neural network as input, so that, ultimately, by teaching
the network through different algorithms, the optimal
solution can be obtained. The conceptual model of the
research first identifies the factors affecting sales and
then tries to determine the interconnection among the
data. In order to compare the performance of this
method, we needed a valid and established measure so
that we can assess the methods based on it. Therefore,
linear and exponential regression methods were selected
to compare the degree of error and to obtain a more
desirable final output which is closer to reality. The
obtained result indicates the successful performance of
the neural network compared to other selected methods
and it was found that it has a lower Minimum Square
Error (MSE) compared to others.

INTRODUCTION
Management
has
always
been
significant
for
people, companies, and governments. Each one of these
groups has dealt with this issue somehow and they try to
maximize their wealth. Hence, they have to make the right
decisions, one of which is the decision regarding (future)
investments. This study evaluates the utilization of neural
networks for predicting sales in the car industry and
compares it with reality. It justifies the use of neural
networks in this industry for the prediction process.
Generally, car manufacturing industries include design,
development,
manufacturing,
marketing
and
sale
of
different
equipment
for
motor
vehicles.
The
set
of
companies and factories involved in design, manufacturing,
marketing, and sale of motor vehicles are a part of this
industry. In 2008, more than 70 million motor vehicles
including ordinary cars and commercial vehicles were
manufactured around the world. In 2007, a total number of
71.9 million cars were sold in the world, with 22.9 million
sold in Europe, 21.4 million sold in Asia and Pacific
Region, 19.4 million sold in the US and Canada, 4.4 million
sold in Latin America, 2.4 million sold in the Middle East,
and 1.4 million sold in Africa. When the market was
experiencing a recession in the US and Japan, Asia and
South
America
significantly
grew
and
got
stronger.
Moreover, it seems that large markets in Russia, Brazil,
India and China have experienced a rapid growth. The car
industry, as one of the largest industries in the world hosting
a large amount of people, financial and time resources, is in
dire need of accurate predictions of its future and its
competitors in order to reach big and sensitive decisions.
Perhaps one of the biggest concerns of the managers and
manufacturers in the car industry and the investors in this
field is the prediction of product sales and planning for the
future manufacturing volume. If a manager can have a more
accurate prediction regarding the future sales volume and
car demand, they can absolutely optimize the investment
volume, recruit workforce and optimally use time to reach
optimal decisions and carry out macro strategies.

THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE STUDY
Five initial exogenous variables were used as the
input for the neural network and the network was prepared
for the entrance of the sixth variable; namely, the effect of
season and month on buying behavior (see Figure 1). Then,
the effect of the month was normalized and used as the main
input for the network. Weights affecting the car sales were
already extracted in previous studies; however, due to the
specific geographical focus of this study, we needed to
generate these effective weights. Therefore, the factors were
extracted
from
electronic
databases,
particularly
two
prestigious studies in the car industry, and, after generating
them and presenting questionnaires to experts in the same
geographical region and integrating the sum of the weights,
the viewpoints were ordered using analytical hierarchy
process.
In
order
to
be
used
in
other
studies,
the
questionnaires were classified into sub-factors for each
factor, too and the weights of the head factors were
introduced into the system of the study. Regarding the
introduction of seasonal and monthly effects, by identifying
and analyzing high-sale and low-sale months and ranking
these sites using the Excel software application, the months
were ranked based on the sales volume from 2010 to 2015
and then they were normalized using Equation 1:
Where
: Equals the maximum value for each entry;
: Equals the minimum value for each entry;
: Is the value of the
entry.
: Is the normalized value of the
entry.
Due to the stability of criteria selection for humans,
the data arising from individual judgment and their taste in
time have stability and solidity. For instance, an individual
who cares about safety, based on personality stability theory
and selection stability, is very likely not to change his mind
about his choice in the next five years. Therefore, after
using fixed weights, due to the dynamic nature of neural
networks, this study requires a dynamic measure for better
training the network. In order to reach this, the seasonal and
monthly data are used as the sixth variable for making the
entries dynamic. The method for extracting monthly data for
each country is different, since the coefficients of the
months are different in each country. In the following, the
monthly weights extraction process for the USA and the
normalization method for these weights are discussed in
detail [2].

The schematic conceptual model of the study is
devised and presented for representation and simplification
of the inputs and objectives framework. The conceptual
model in this study is represented by expressing the factors
affecting sales, categorization and the desired objective.

METHODOLOGY
Regarding objectives, this study searches for a scientific
process for improving decision making about the future of
the car industry, the time consumed, the energy, and the
investment,
as
well
as
preventing
the
untimely
manufacturing, which interferes with the economic cycle and
leads to the loss of the industry. This can be used in
governmental and non-governmental sectors, whether from
the viewpoint of industrial policy making or the viewpoint of
enterprise profitability. Regarding the type and nature, this
study is a descriptive-analytical one since it evaluates and
analyzes the current state of the market.
In this study, at first, the factors affecting car sales are
identified based on previous studies and researches and then,
these are presented to a panel of experts in order to be
ranked.

presented along with the main input data to the neural
network so that, while teaching the main data and using these
weights, a better forecasting for the future can be obtained.
Finally, the prediction data is compared to the real data so
that the validity of the developed model can be measured.
The statistical population of the study includes the market for
the products of Kia and Hyundai corporations in the US and
Canada from 2010 until 2015. This information is extracted
from
the
formal
electronic
databases
supervising
the
American industries as well as the databases of Kia and
Hyundai corporations. In order to gather the required data for
the theoretical sections (e.g. previous studies or introduction
to artificial neural networks), the library method (using
online databases, books, dissertations, and online articles)
was used and for gathering the data related to the weights,
the expert panel method was used and the opinions were
integrated using the relevant software applications [8].
IV.
DATA ANALYSIS
In this section, the multi-layer back propagation
neural network is applied on the sales data for Kia and
Hyundai corporations in the US and Canada from 2010 until
2015 in order to propose a model for predicting the car sales
based on artificial intelligence. The 6 determining variables
for car sales (economic, dimension, performance, safety,
driver and passengers’ comfort, dimensions, size, and the
appearance of the car as well as the seasonal effects on sale)
were used in two groups as the input for the network. In the
first
group,
which
includes
the
first
five
variables
mentioned, the data was extracted using questionnaire from
the expert panel and was fed into the group analytical
hierarchy process. The cumulative results obtained from the
Expert Choice software application were considered as the
first group of inputs. The system was taught using these
weights and was prepared for the second group of inputs,
which include the seasonal effects on sale. The inputs of the
artificial neural network have been normalized so that they
can be between 0 and 1, and then they are fed into the neural
network. In this study, a neural network with two hidden
layers is used and the different network parameters (such as,
the number of neurons, the type of network training
algorithm, the fraction of the data tested by the network, and
so on) were optimized using the neural network branch of
MATLAB software application. Since the neural network
toolboxes in MATLAB software application are intended to
be used in ordinary and non-professional conditions and
have a higher error compared to the manual configuration
condition, this study uses the input codes obtained after
performing a huge number of tests. In order to arrive at
opinions relevant to the industry as well as the customers,
this study uses the opinions of individuals who were
unbiased and non-stakeholders while related to the car
industry so that they can add both versions of an opinion to
the questionnaire [3]. Table I represents the target data
which include the sales volume of Kia and Hyundai cars in
the USA from 2010 to 2015.
In order to extract the monthly effective data and
the seasonal effect on buying behavior, we ranked the high-
sale months using data classification in Excel software
application and then the obtained rankings were normalized.
This data, presented in Table II, is the input variables of the
study for the artificial neural network to teach it and
determine implicit relations between the network inputs and
the network outputs. We use the term “implicit” because, in
order to discover the relations among the data, the artificial
neural network assesses the numbers in its black box.
Hence, finding the exact relations and allocated weights by
the network itself is highly complex, even impossible due to
being highly time-consuming task.

Figure 3: The Schematic Representation of the Neural Network Formed in
the Study with Expected Inputs and Output
Due to the presence of an output at the end for
predicting sales in each country (The US and Canada), a
neuron is placed in the output layer of the neural network.
The most important advantage of using this method is that
even if the training accuracy for the network is not high, the
network still keeps its generality [7]. Therefore, generally,
the neural network involves six inputs and an output with
two hidden layers. A schematic representation of the utilized
neural network is presented in Fig.3.
The research data is categorized into three sections
including training data, test data and evaluation data. The
training data is simply used for adjusting the weights and
biases of the neural network, while the test data is not
involved in the training process of the network and it is just
used for the generalization test of the network. The
evaluation data is used for testing the generalization of the
network in each stage of network training and then it is used
for adjusting the network’s weights and biases. MSE is used
as a function of the neural network performance. In order to
improve
the
performance
of
the
network,
the
cross
validation process is used for interrupting the training of the
network. In this process, if the error of the network over the
evaluation data after
times subsequent trainings is not
improved, then the network training will be stopped in order
to maintain the generalizability of the network. This study
uses
as the criterion for stopping the network
training.
Another
criterion
used
for
maintaining
the
generalizability of the neural network is the gradient of the
network in each repetition and, in this study, in order to
reach the desired results,
is adopted [5].
V.
ANALYZING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE NEURAL
NETWORK
In this section, the best algorithm for training the
neural network and determining the number of neurons in
the hidden layers is selected. Moreover, the sensitivity
analysis is carried out on the fraction of data to be used as
the test and evaluation data sets. Therefore, it has been tried
to optimize the parameters of the neural network based on
the network error.
VI.
SELECTING THE BEST PATTERN FOR NETWORK
TRAINING
The number of neurons in the first and second
hidden layers are considered to be 10 and 1, respectively.
By changing the network training algorithm, the training
error over the test data is measured. The error obtained over
the test data is used for selecting the network training
algorithm based on a network with higher generalization
capability [4]. Since the initial weights and biases of the
network are selected randomly and these values affect the
performance of the network, the neural network was carried
out 30 times for each algorithm and the minimum error in
these 30 runs was selected as a criterion for measuring the
appropriate
algorithm
for
training
the
network
[6].
Accordingly, the results are presented in Fig.4.

Network Training Algorithms

DATA ANALYTICS 2016 : The Fifth International Conference on Data Analytics

Based on the results presented in Fig.4, training
algorithms of
and
have the lowest error-
based on the mean error MSE. Since the
algorithm
has the lowest error, it is used for training the network.
VII.
DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL VALUE FOR THE
NUMBER OF NEURONS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND HIDDEN
LAYERS
Determining the number of neurons in hidden
layers is of particular significance in the structure of neural
networks. The presence of huge number of neurons in
hidden layers will lead to the higher complexity of the
neural network and increasing number of its adjustable
parameters (weights and biases). Whereas, the presence of a
fewer number of neurons in hidden layers can lead to a
situation where the neural network is not able to efficiently
describe the relations present between the inputs and output
of the network. In order to determine the optimal number of
neurons in the first and second hidden layers, by keeping all
the other parameters constant, the first and second hidden
layers vary between 5 and 12 and between 1 and 10,
respectively, and the value of the minimum error (MSE) for
each
state
over
the
test
data
is
calculated.
This
computational tolerance is presented in Table III, along with
extracting the optimal solution.
VIII.
THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM TRAINING THE
NEURAL NETWORK
Based on the sensitivity analysis carried out in the
previous section and the adjustment of different parameters
for the neural network, the following values are selected for
the neural network and in order to reach the best results over
the neural network, the network is run multiple times in
order to obtain the lowest value of MSE.

After training the optimized neural network, Fig.5
is obtained for the error of the network. It is worth
mentioning that after 8 repetitions from the beginning of
network training, variations in the values of network
parameters
significantly
reduced,
indicating
the
convergence of the network in low repetitions. It should also

Test Data

Regression Pattern
be said that the network training is carried out in Batch
mode, which means that the selection of weights and biases
of the network is done after applying all the training data.
Another method is to update the weights and biases of the
network after applying each individual input. In Fig.5, we
trained and optimized the network using the Bayesian
command. As mentioned before, the method with lowest
error for optimizing the problem is to use the training
algorithm. Perhaps, in most cases, the Levenberg-Marquardt
(LM) algorithm provides a suitable solution. However,
regarding the current study which differs from other studies,
due to limited data at the input level and the lack of rich data
for forming the network, the Bayesian algorithm provides a
better optimization.
In the fields of management and economics, it is
highly common to use the regression method for predicting
a factor or some factors in the future. The regression method

Values of the Data

uses data trends to predict the next step of the data.
Generally, regression is classified as linear or non-linear or
exponential.
In
this
study,
in
order
to
evaluate
the
performance and efficiency of the neural network, the
prediction data are compared to the real data as well as the
data predicted
by the regression
method. The linear
regression is closer to reality compared to the non-linear
regression [10]. In order to facilitate the comparison, the
data are simplified based on 10 to the power of 8 [1]. As can
be inferred from Table IV, each model or method providing
lower error compared to the real data, is more reliable and
usable. In this study, the neural network is used as a pioneer
network in minimizing the prediction error. Fig.7 shows
how much the error of this claim is compared to the real
data.
IX.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In this study, neural networks were used for
predicting
car
sales.
The
important
point
and
the
differentiating aspect of this study compared to previous
studies is using limited data which is considered one of the
weaknesses of neural networks. However, at the end, with
the proper architecture and training and using an optimal
algorithm, this study was successful in optimizing this
network even for limited data. The results obtained over
training, test, and evaluation data indicate the capability of
the neural network as one of the artificial intelligence
methods for accurate prediction of car sales. Using the
simulation
carried
out
for
the
neural
network
and
determining the method for changing car sales based on
different parameters, it was concluded that the neural
network is able to efficiently predict the normal trend of car
sales based on the six factors of price, performance, safety,
appearance, and comfort as well as the effects of months on
the sale volume. Accordingly, it was concluded that based
on the data utilized, the highest impact from car aspects on
the sale are for safety and generally, the sales variations are
influenced by the season and month. The trained neural
network can be used in the future as a criterion for
predicting car sales over limited data. Accordingly, before
manufacturing the desired car, the trained neural network
can be used to determine if this manufactured car attracts
enough demand and sale capability or not or the investment
will be influenced by demand risk loss. Based on the
positive performance of neural network in this study, it is
recommended to compare the artificial neural network and
fitting curves for subjects with limited and poor data [9].
