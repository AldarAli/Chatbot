Abstract—The subject of this paper is a comparison of the 
different criteria and strategies of signal reception in space-
time coding MIMO systems operating under dynamic flat 
fading and channel cross-correlation. The dynamic fading 
means that a Doppler shift is comparable with the transmission 
rate. The criterion of comparison is a mean bit error rate. The 
BER characteristics are obtained via Monte Carlo simulation. 
Many strategies and antennas configurations are analyzed, 
including space-time maximum likelihood, and zero forcing, as 
well as 2x1, 2x2 and 2x3 antenna setup. Simulation  
demonstrates that the receiver with 3 antennas and simple 
maximum likelihood decoder usually acts better than receiver 
with a fewer number of antennas and a more sophisticated 
reception strategy.

 INTRODUCTION 
Potential performance benefits and a remarkable capacity 
promised by MIMO (multiple input – multiple output) 
systems attracted a lot of interest in the recent years. 
However, to keep this promise, many strict conditions have 
to be satisfied. This refers, inter alia, to the assumption of a 
quasi-static fading where the channel gains h(t)=h(t+T) [1] 
[2]. Under real conditions, the transfer function h(t) changes 
itself over the code word and this leads to interference, 
supposing the Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion is used 
[7][8]. At the same time, the interference suppression 
methods, e.g. Zero Forcing (ZF) or Minimum Mean Square 
Error (MMSE) techniques are applied [4][5][6], as well as 
the QR decomposition [10] and the Maximum Likelihood 
Space-Time decoding (ML-ST) [8]. These strategies are 
usually examined in MISO (multiple input - single output) 
configuration and in the absence of a cross-correlation. 
Those approaches outperform linear combiner with the ML 
detector. However, they are more complex. The influence of 
the number of receiving antennas on this benefit was not 
taken into account, as well as the effect of cross-correlation. 
In the present paper, several antennas architectures and 
popular detector schemes - ML, ML-ST, ZF, MMSE - are 
analyzed, both for channel cross-correlation and for dynamic 
flat fading. The comparison of performance is carried out on 
the basis of BER characteristics. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the system model. Section III deals with  
interference suppression techniques. In Section IV, the 
Monte Carlo simulations are carried out and the obtained 
results are analyzed. Section V contains a concise 
conclusion. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The considered system consists of two transmitting and 
one, two or three receiving antennas, Fig 1. All antennas are 
potentially mobile and omni-directional. It is assumed that 
the system exploits the space-time coding strategy [3]. In 
principle, the maximum likelihood decision rule is applied 
assuming that the interference suppression (IS) is performed 
first. The channel undergoes frequency flat and time-
selective Rayleigh fading. The channel gains are identical

[3]. For the 2x2 MIMO system, received signals in antennas

In real channels, however, the off-diagonal elements of

INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION 
The main idea leading to interference suppression 
techniques is to built a matrix W to fulfill condition

where I stands for diagonal matrix of real elements. In the ZF 
technique it takes a form [4]

As a consequence, elements causing the interference are 
reduced to zero but the variance of system noise is at the 
same time increased, what obviously deteriorates system 
performance. The way to reduce this effect is to built a 
modified matrix (8) and minimize the noise via the MMSE 
technique [13].

Most publications deal with systems with one receiving 
antenna. This assumption provides an opportunity to use a 
simple matrix inversion. However, for a few receiving 
antennas the problem of matrix inversion is more complex. 
Such a matrix is no longer the square one and the advanced 
pseudo-inversion has to be carried out [9]

Still another technique employs a space-time decoder, ML-

IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
In order to compare the different strategies the Monte 
Carlo simulation method was applied. As a measure of 
channel variations, the normalized fading rate FdTS was 
used, where Fd stands for a maximum Doppler spread and 
TS for a symbol duration time (at times, this parameter is 
called the normalized fading bandwidth, BT). 
Three values of FdTS were used: 0.01 for quasi-static 
fading, 0.05 for moderate fading and 0.1 for fast fading. The 
first results, Fig.2, refer to ZF and MMSE techniques. The 
benefit of using MMSE instead of ZF becomes more and 
more negligible as the number of receiving antennas 
exceeds one. For the 2x2 setup, both detectors provide 
comparable results even for fast fading, and for the 2x3 
setup, the difference disappears. Such results were expected.

It is to be noted that the size of identity matrix I is dictated 
by the size of the 
H H H
 matrix in (8). 
 
 
Figure 2.  BER performance of ZF/MMSE strategies for 2x1, 2x2, 2x3 
antennas setups and FdTS=0.01 - 0.1 
For the Alamouti code, this operation always leads to a 
2x2 square matrix irrespective of the number of receiving 
antennas, because there are always 2 transmitting antennas. 
The noise minimizing component 
 2I
 have the same value 
for all considered antennas configurations. 
Thus, the benefit of using MMSE instead of ZF becomes 
smaller with the increase of the number of receiving 
antennas. One can see from Fig. 2 that the highest impact on 
the behavior of all characteristics evokes the number of 
receiving antennas – the higher the number, the lower the 
BER. The next factor is the type of detector: the ML gives 
the poorest results, ZF and ML-ST seem better and 
comparable to each other. The influence of a cross-
correlation is temperate. 
 
Figure 3.  . BER performance of ML, ZF, ML-ST strategies for setups 
2x1, 2x2, 2x3 and fast fading, negligible cross-correlation 
However, it can be noticed that the ML detector in a 2x2 
setup gives better performance than all considered detectors 
in a 2x1 configuration in a range of SNR from 0 to approx. 
30dB. 
Fig. 5 refers to strong channel cross-correlation and fast 
fading. 
The a, b, c parts of the Fig. 5 refer to ML, ZF and ML-ST 
respectively. Colors denote the number of receiving 
antennas and 
 
solid lines – fast fading strong correlated case; 
 
dashed lines – fast fading uncorrelated case; 
 
dotted bold lines – moderate fading uncorrelated 
case as a reference level. 
It can be seen that all considered strategies suffer from 
fading and cross-correlation. The greatest impact on the 
behavior of all characteristics again evokes the number of 
receiving antennas – the higher the number, the lower the 
BER. The next factor is the type of detector: the ML gives 
the weakest results, ZF and ML-ST seem better and 
comparable to each other. The influence of a cross-
correlation is temperate. 
The second group of results, Fig.3 and Fig. 4, refer to ML, 
ZF and ML-ST strategies (MMSE was neglected) for 
moderate fading and both uncorrelated channel and low 
channel cross-correlation. The elements of the correlation 
matrix were set randomly from the values of 0.2 to 0.4. This 
operation was described in detail in [11]. 
For the 2x1 setup, deteriorations of performance for all 
strategies are caused mainly by fading, while cross-
correlation can be treated as a nearly small supplement. For 
2x2 or 2x3 setups and ML strategy, the influence of both 
factors - fading and cross-correlation - are comparable, 
while for ZF and ML-ST the cross-correlation dominates.

However, it is worth noting that for the 2x3 setup and 
typical conditions of moderate fading and low cross-
correlation, 
the 
simple 
ML 
detector 
offers 
better 
performance than ZF or ML-ST applied in a 2x1 or 2x2 
setup, Fig. 3 and 4. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We carried out a comparison of ML, ZF, MMSE and 
ML-ST reception strategies in STBC MIMO systems for 
2x1, 2x2 and 2x3 antennas setup. As a criterion of the 
comparison of the BER, characteristics obtained via Monte 
Carlo simulation were used. These characteristics show that 
an additional antenna (setup 2x3) used in a typical moderate 
fading and low cross-correlation environment gives better 
results than a sophisticated reception procedure, e.g. ML-ST. 
The benefits of using MMSE instead of ZF become smaller 
with an increase of the number of receiving antennas. The 
greatest impact on characteristics is caused by the number of 
receiving antennas. It was also shown that a low cross-
correlation acts as an additive error source and is nearly 
independent on fading. The above conclusions are, however, 
not valid for a strong cross-correlation case and for fast 
fading where the ZF/ML-ST strategies bring even better 
results than ML in a 2x3 setup.
