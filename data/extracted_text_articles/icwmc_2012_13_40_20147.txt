Abstract—Multicasting is a spectrally efficient method for 
supporting group communication by allowing transmission of 
packets to multiple destinations using fewer resources. To 
incorporate cooperative diversity, Cooperative Extended 
Balanced Space-Time Block Codes (CEBSTBCs) have been 
proposed providing full diversity when one or more feedback 
bits are sent back via feedback channel. However, the 
CEBSTBCs 
are 
designed 
for 
cooperative 
unicast 
communication in the literature. This paper presents a novel 
wireless multicasting scheme which selects the optimum 
CEBSTBC for all vehicular users to support wireless multicast. 
The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated for 
not only vehicle-to-vehicle communication but also for vehicle-
to-infrastructure cases. Extensive detailed simulations are 
performed to show the feasibility of full rate and full diversity 
multicast service provisioning in vehicular communications.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
One of the space-time coding scheme is Orthogonal 
Space-Time Block Codes (OSTBCs), which provides full 
diversity advantage with low decoding complexity. The 
transmitted symbols are decoded separately using linear 
processing [1]. However, full diversity and full rate for more 
than two antennas cannot be achieved with OSTBCs. Several 
quasi-orthogonal STBCs that provide full rate at the expense 
of some loss in diversity [2],[3] and OSTBCs that provide 
full diversity with some loss in code rate [1], [4] have been 
proposed in the literature. In [5], full rate Balanced Space-
Time Block Coding (BSTBC) have been proposed which 
achieve full diversity for arbitrary number of transmit 
antennas when one or more feedback bits are sent back via 
feedback channel. The main drawback of the BSTBC is 
limited coding gain. In [6-7], the Extended Balanced Space- 
Time Block Coding (EBSTBC) scheme has been proposed. 
In the EBSTBC, an arbitrary number of codes can be 
generated for improved coding gain. 
Owing to insufficient antenna space, cost and hardware 
limitations, wireless users may not be able to support 
multiple transmit antennas. To overcome this difficulty, 
recently, researchers have been looking for methods to 
exploit spatial diversity using the antennas of different users 
in a network. This type of diversity is called the cooperative 
diversity [8] where virtual antenna arrays can be formed to 
overcome the drawback of channel correlation and space 
limitations of mobile unit. In addition, cooperative diversity 
reduces the required transmit power which leads to longer 
battery life and increases capacity in interference limited 
systems. The application of EBSTBCs into the cooperative 
communication is Cooperative Extended Balanced Space-
Time Block Codes (CEBSTBCs), which was proposed in 
[7]. 
It is known that multicasting is an efficient method of 
supporting 
group 
communication 
as 
it 
allows 
for 
transmission of packets to multiple destinations using fewer 
network resources [9]. Along with the widespread 
deployment of wireless networks, the fast-improving 
capabilities of mobile devices, content and service providers 
are 
increasingly 
interested 
in 
supporting 
multicast 
communications over wireless networks. 
Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have recently 
attracted much attention from car manufacturers, road 
operators and standardization bodies. The primarily aim of 
ITS is to increase the road safety by means of vehicle-to-
vehicle 
(V2V) 
and 
vehicle-to-infrastructure 
(V2I) 
communication. Considerable effort has been dedicated to 
defining architectures, services and application scenarios for 
both V2V and V2I paradigms [10]. To the best our 
knowledge, there is no space-time block coding which 
achieves full rate and full diversity for more than one user 
for vehicular communication. In this paper, we propose a 
novel coding selection scheme for wireless multicasting. 
Extensive simulations are performed to show the feasibility 
of the full rate full diversity multicast service provisioning in 
V2V and V2I communication. In this regard, in the second 
section, the system models are described, in the third section, 
the CEBSTBCs are explained, in the fourth section, 
Multicast Cooperative Extended Balanced Space-Time 
Block Coding (MCEBSTBC) is presented, and in the last 
section, the results of the paper and the conclusion are given. 
The following notation is used in the paper: The 
superscript * denotes the conjugate operation; Re{.} and 
Im{.} are the real and imaginary part of the argument, 
respectively. The operator . 
   rounds to the smallest integer 
greater or equal than its argument; the operator max(.) 
returns the largest of its operands and the min(.) returns the 
minimum of its operands.

SYSTEM MODELS 
A. Vehicle-to-Vehicle System Model 
The vehicle-to-vehicle system model consists of one 
source, N cooperative vehicles and L multicast vehicle 
users. All nodes are equipped with one single antenna. The 
Rayleigh channel model and the related second-order 
channel statistics originally proposed for a base station-to-
mobile link fail to provide an accurate model for dynamic 
vehicle-to-vehicle link. Instead, the cascaded (double) 
Rayleigh fading channel model has been proposed [11-12], 
which provides a realistic description of an intervehicular 
channel where two Rayleigh fading processes are assumed 
to be generated by independent groups of scatterers around 
the two mobile terminals [13]. In the intervehicular system 
model, all channels are assumed to be frequency flat double 
Rayleigh fading channel. hsri is the channel coefficient from 
the source vehicle to the ith cooperative vehicle (relay) and 
hij is the channel coefficient from the ith cooperative vehicle 
to the jth multicast vehicle user where i=1, 2,.., n and j=1, 
2,.., L. 
The channels are quasi-static, namely, the fading 
coefficients remain constant over the duration of one frame. 
Each multicast vehicle user is assumed to have perfect 
knowledge of its own channels. It is also assumed that the 
multicast users have no knowledge of the source vehicle-
cooperative vehicle (relay) channels. Each cooperative 
vehicle is assumed to have perfect knowledge of its own 
source vehicle-cooperative vehicle channel. The cooperative 
vehicles employ amplify and forward protocol [8]. The 
noise is modeled as additive white Gaussian whose 
components are circular complex random variable with 
zero-mean and variance σ2. P is the average transmitted 
power of the source vehicle and the cooperative vehicles. 
The source data bits are mapped by streams of y bits into M-
ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) symbols, where M=2y.  
B. Vehicle-to-Infrastructure System Model 
The vehicle-to-infrastructure system model is similar 
vehicle-to-vehicle system model except in the cooperative 
vehicle-multicast user channel part. In V2I system, 
cooperative vehicle to multicast user channels are assumed 
frequency flat Rayleigh fading channel where the channel 
gains are circularly complex Gaussian random variables and 
statistically independent from each other.  
III. 
COOPERATIVE EXTENDED BALANCED SPACE-TIME 
BLOCK CODING 
The Cooperative Extended Balanced Space-Time Block 
Coding (CEBSTBC) can be obtained when an extension 
matrix is multiplied with an Orthogonal Space-Time Block 
Coding [14-15]. Since Alamouti`s code is the only 
orthogonal code with rate one and minimum delay, the 
CEBSTBCs can be obtained as an extension of the 
Alamouti`s code [16]. 
 
C=XW.  
 
      (1) 
 
Here, X is the Alamouti’s code and W is the 2xN matrix 
where N≥2 and the rank of W must be 2. The following 
example shows how to generate the CEBSTBCs for three 
transmitters. Consider the CEBSTBC pair with transmission 
matrix 
  
(2) 
 
 
where a=ej2πm/q, q is the extension level and m=0, 1,…q-1. 
The columns and rows of C1 denote symbols transmitted 
from three cooperative relays in two signaling intervals, 
respectively. The matrix C1 is obtained from the Alamouti 
code using Equation (1) where 
 
 
       
(3)          
In this fashion, arbitrary number of the CEBSTBCs can 
be generated. It can be shown that the number of possible 
CEBSTBCs is qN-2(2N-1-1) [7]. For that reason, the 
destination needs N+d feedback bits (N≥3) to select any 
possible CEBSTBCs where

. N-2 
feedback bits are needed to achieve full diversity as in 
CBSTBCs [14]. The rest of the d+2 feedback bits provide 
an additional coding gain. 
 
IV. 
MULTICAST COOPERATIVE EXTENDED BALANCED 
SPACE-TIME BLOCK CODING 
Multicast Cooperative Extended Balanced Space-Time 
Block Coding (MCEBSTBC) can be obtained when an 
optimum CEBSTBC is selected for all multicast users. The 
MCEBSTBC 
contains 
two 
phases: 
Multicast 
frame 
initialization phase and multicast transmission phase. In the 
first phase, the multicast users transmit their channel state 
information (CSI) to the selected multicast user and the 
selected multicast user selects the optimum CEBSTBC for 
all multicast users. This phase is shown in Figure 1. In 
Figure 2, multicast transmission phase is shown. In this 
phase, the source transmits data to the cooperative relays and 
the cooperative relays transmit to the multicast users 
according to selected the MCEBSTBC. 
A. MCEBSTBC for Three Cooperative Vehicles 
When three cooperative vehicles are present at the 
environment then, C1, C2 and C3 are available MCEBSTBC 
matrices. These matrices are

Figure 1.  Multicast frame initialization phase of the MCEBSTBC: A) 
Channel coefficients are transmitted to the selected multicast vehicle user 
B) Selected code is transmitted both the cooperative vehicles and rest of the 
multicast vehicle users. 
 
Figure 2.  Multicast transmission phase of the MCEBSTBC: A) Broadcast 
phase B) Cooperation phase.  
The selected multicast user picks the MCEBSTBC Cj, 
j=1,2,3 that generates the optimum coding gain for all the 
multicast users. Two bits of feedback is needed to select the 
MCEBSTBC matrices and k bits of feedback is needed to 
select the feedback a where k =d+1. In [6-7], the optimum 
code is selected according to the single user channel 
coefficients. However, the optimum MCEBSTBC for all 
multicast users is selected according to the following 
maximin approach 
 
                  
   (5) 
 
 
 
where a  is selected to maximize the terms in the brackets 
[14]. The optimum MCEBSTBC is employed after 
combining, the observations at the jth vehicle multicast user, 
to obtain  
 (6) 
 
Here, 
s ,ˆi j
is the estimate of the ith symbol at the jth 
multicast vehicle user; η1,j and η2,j are the noise samples at 
the jth multicast vehicle user.  
Fig. 3 shows the percentage of the channels that achieve 
full diversity for various multicast vehicle users when three 
cooperative vehicles are present in the environment. 
MCEBSTBC 
with 
one 
bit 
extension 
of 
feedback 
(MCEBSTBC (k=1)) achieves full diversity with only one 
user (unicast communication), since MCEBSTBC with one 
bit extension of feedback yields only 6 different codes. 
MCEBSTBC with two or more bit extension of feedback 
supports full diversity for two users. When five or more 
multicast users are present in the wireless environment, full 
diversity can be achieved in 70% or less of all possible 
channel conditions. 
 The following are the properties of the MEBSTBC for 
three cooperative relays: 
i) One bit extension of feedback (k=1) cannot achieve full 
rate and full diversity for two multicast users. 
ii) Two or more bit extension of feedback (k≥2) achieves 
full rate and full diversity for two multicast users. 
iii) The full diversity can be achieved for an arbitrary number 
of multicast users, if the below inequality is satisfied for all 
possible channel conditions.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS 
The bit error probabilities of the MCEBSTBC are 
evaluated for quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) 
modulation by computer simulations. The frame length is 
128 symbol duration. The source vehicle-cooperative vehicle 
(relay) channels are better quality in signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) than cooperative vehicle-multicast vehicle user 
channels whose difference is quantified by differential 
signal-to-noise ratio (DSNR). In the Figures 5-8, DSNR is 
assumed to be 25 dB for three and four cooperative vehicles. 
For comparison, the bit error rate (BER) curve of the unicast 
CEBSTBC [7] is also included in Figure 5-8. 
Figure 5 presents the bit error probabilities of the 
MCEBSTBC with four bits extension of feedback for three 
cooperative vehicles and various numbers of multicast 
vehicle users. It can be seen from the Figure 5 that the full 
diversity cannot be achieved for more than four multicast 
users since the slope of the curves is decreased. Compared to 
the MCEBSTBC with 2 multicast users (2 Mult. 
MCEBSTBC (k=4)), the CEBSTBC with four bits extension 
of feedback (Unicast CEBSTBC (k=4) [7]) has a SNR 
advantage of only 0.54 dB for a BER value of 1x10-3. 
However, the MCEBSTBC with 2 multicast users (2 Mult. 
MCEBSTBC (k=4)) provides better performance than the 
CEBSTBC with one bit extension of feedback (Unicast 
CEBSTBC (k=1) [7]) and the system transmission rate is 
doubled. Relative to the MCEBSTBC with 3 multicast users 
(3 Mult. MCEBSTBC (k=4)), the MCEBSTBC with 4 
multicast users (4 Mult. MCEBSTBC (k=4)), and the 
MCEBSTBC with 5 multicast users (5 Mult. MCEBSTBC

(k=4)), the CEBSTBCs with four bit extension of feedback 
(Unicast CEBSTBC (k=4) [7]) has a SNR advantage of 
merely 1.1 dB, 1.7 dB, and 2.45 dB, respectively. The 
proposed MCEBSTBC sacrifices some coding gain to utilize 
system resources efficiently.

Figure 6 presents the bit error probabilities of the 
MCEBSTBC with four bits extension of feedback for four 
cooperative relays and various numbers of multicast users. It 
can be seen from the Figure 7 that the full diversity can be 
achieved for five multicast users since the slope of the curves 
does not change. Compared to the CEBSTBC with four bits 
extension of feedback (Unicast CEBSTBC (k=4) [7]), the 
MCEBSTBC with 2 multicast users (2 Mult. MCEBSTBC 
(k=4)) has a SNR advantage of just 0.77 dB for a BER value 
of 1x10-4. However, the MCEBSTBC with 3 multicast users 
(3 Mult. MCEBSTBC (k=4)) provides just 0.25 dB worse 
performance than the CEBSTBC with one bit extension of 
feedback (Unicast CEBSTBC (k=1) [7]) and the system 
transmission rate is tripled. In comparison the MCEBSTBC 
with 3 multicast users (3 Mult. MCEBSTBC (k=4)), the 
MCEBSTBC with 4 multicast users (4 Mult. MCEBSTBC 
(k=4)), and the MCEBSTBC with 5 multicast users (5 Mult. 
MCEBSTBC (k=4)), the CEBSTBCs with four bit extension 
of feedback (Unicast CEBSTBC (k=4) [7]) has a SNR 
advantage of only 1.37 dB, 1.88 dB, and 2.21 dB, 
respectively. Once again, the proposed MCEBSTBC 
sacrifices a slight coding gain but the system transmission 
rate is increased L times. 
In the sequel, we simulate the cooperative V2I 
communication. In this scenario, the multicast users are at 
the infrastructure and the cooperative vehicle-multicast 
users´ channels are Rayleigh fading. Figure 7 depicts the bit 
error probabilities of the MCEBSTBC with four bits 
extension of feedback for three cooperative vehicles and 
various numbers of multicast users. It can be seen from the 
Figure 7 that the full diversity cannot be achieved more than 
four multicast users since the slope of curves is decreased. 
Table 1 presents required SNR values for a BER value of 
1x10-3. It can be easily seen that the proposed MCEBSTBC 
sacrifices some coding gain to utilize system resources 
efficiently.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, full rate and full diversity multicast service 
provisioning in V2V and V2I communications was analyzed 
and simulated. It has been observed that compared to the 
unicast CEBSTBC, the MCEBSTBC does not utilize all 
available codes and employs optimum CEBSTBC for all 
multicast vehicle users. This optimization sacrifices a slight 
coding gain to utilize system resources efficiently. Namely, 
by using the MCEBSTBC, the system transmission rate is 
increased in proportion to the number of multicast users. The 
larger cooperative vehicles present at the wireless 
environment, the fuller diversity full rate wireless 
multicasting can be achieved. The proposed multicast 
technique might be implemented easily in IEEE 802.11p [17] 
which defines enhancements to 802.11 required to support 
ITS applications [17].
