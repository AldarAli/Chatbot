Abstract— Agricultural systems are complex systems, whose 
study requires approaches capable of recognizing the inherent 
feedbacks 
between 
people`s 
behavior, 
incentives, 
and 
environmental outcomes. Although several studies deal with 
agricultural systems from that perspective, there are 
comparatively few that study irrigation schemes based on the 
feedback effects that may threaten their sustainability. This 
paper uses feedback loop polarity analysis to build an 
algorithm to predict irrigation systems` resilience tipping 
points. It concludes by suggesting that the basic ideas 
presented might be useful to build operational early warning 
signals for critical transitions in irrigation systems and in a 
wider range of systems where tipping points are suspected to 
exist.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
 
As defined by Holling [6], ecological resilience refers 
to the ability to absorb change and disturbance and still 
maintain the same relationships that control a system’s 
behavior. Nonetheless, the literature is still unclear on how 
to measure resilience in different systems and therefore on 
how well that concept translates in practice to analyzing the 
vulnerability of social systems more broadly [2]. As we 
cannot hope to manage what we do not even measure, the 
issue of measurement seems critical for the progress of the 
research on the field. This paper aims at contributing to 
bridge that gap by proposing a codified procedure, based on 
loop polarity analysis [1], for identifying in advance 
irrigation systems` resilience thresholds.  
There are comparatively few works focusing on factors 
that can threaten the sustainability of irrigation systems [4]. 
Most of them show that irrigation projects can cause 
catchment degradation but are also (more often than not) 
their victims [8]. The most obvious consequence of 
catchment deterioration by irrigation is erosion, leading to 
siltation of canals and of reservoirs. This makes poor 
operation and maintenance (O&M) the bigger problem for 
the sustainability of irrigation projects mainly in less 
developed countries where many of those projects are 
managed for incompetent bureaucracies combined with 
weak irrigator associations. Causality above can also 
manifest in reverse, because farmers may simply be unable 
to carry out maintenance expenses, for being caught in 
feedback reinforcing loops of inadequate maintenance. 
Elinor Ostrom [10: p.89] puts the question as follows. 
“Unless farmers pay the fees used to hire O&M staff or 
they perform these O&M activities themselves, many 
irrigation agencies will not be able to do anything more than 
operate systems in a minimal fashion. Little investment can 
be made in routine or emergency maintenance. The initial 
lack of maintenance triggers a vicious circle that has been 
characteristic of many large systems constructed in recent 
years. Without adequate maintenance, system reliability 
begins to deteriorate. As reliability diminishes, farmers are 
less willing to make investments in expensive seeds and 
fertilizers that are of little benefit without a reliable water 
supply. Without these input investments, the net return from 
irrigated agriculture declines. As returns fall, farmers 
become still more resistant to contributing to the system`s 
sustainability.”  
This paper indicates how to identify in advance the 
critical points beyond which, due to the action of vicious 
feedback loops, irrigation systems lose resilience when hit 
by even tiny, and so hard to notice, environmental shocks. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 
II presents a hypothetical system dynamics model that 
underpins the above conclusion and summarizes the essence 
of the loop polarity analysis approach. Section III presents a 
codified procedure for computing resilience tipping points 
of irrigation systems. Sections IV and V, respectively, 
present and discuss the main results of simulation, 
suggesting how to identify leverage intervention points in 
collapsing irrigation systems. Section VI concludes by 
suggesting that the basic ideas presented might be useful to 
build operational early warning signals for critical 
transitions not only in irrigation systems, but in a wider 
range of systems, where tipping points are suspected to 
exist. 
 
 
II. THE MODEL  
 
Professor Ostrom`s ideas on the sustainability of 
irrigation systems outlined in the introductory section were 
later formalized in a system dynamics model by herself and 
colleagues at Indiana University [13], which we synthesize 
in Figure 1.

The fully documented original Stella version model 
is presented in the referred paper and the present VENSIM 
version is available upon request. In the basic stock-flow 
structure of the simplified model, there are just two loops. In 
the self-reinforcing loop labeled as “the death spiral”, the 
deterioration of the irrigation infrastructure due to 
inadequate maintenance leads to falling output, benefits and 
infrastructure maintenance, which further decreases the 
infrastructure reliability.  In the stabilization loop, decreases 
in the depreciation flow due to the reduction in the state. 
The time path of the value of the infrastructure is then given 
by the following differential equation: 
 
 
dInfrastructure/dt = Maintenance – Infrastructure Losses (1) 
 
where: 
 
Maintenance = min (Maintenance Dues, net Benefit)        (2) 
 Net Benefit  = Before Maintenance Net Benefit – Domestic 
Expenditures                                                                       (3) 
 
and 
 
Infrastructure Losses = Infrastructure * Depreciation Rate 
(4) 
 
Disturbances like changes in rain regime are modeled as 
follows. 
 
Rain Regime = Mean Precipitation Level - PULSE(y, t)* R            
 
 
 
                                                 (5)         
 
where R  is the change in the precipitation level starting in 
year y and lasting for t  years.  
 
 
 
 
The degree of resilience of the above system can be 
assessed as follows: what level of disturbance, droughts for

instance, can the system withstand before the agents stop 
investing the total amount needed for the integral 
maintenance of the infrastructure?  
It is easy to see that as far as irrigators are able to pay 
maintenance fees the infrastructure is maintained in 
appropriated use conditions. But if they are forced to spend 
less than that value, the maintenance rate will be lower than 
infrastructure losses and the infrastructure will decrease in 
size. Hence, in the next period, the amount appropriated of 
water, output and profits will decrease and so do 
maintenance spending. Once the irrigators are forced to pay 
less than the right maintenance dues, the system can enter 
into a snow-ball trajectory we have labeled “the death 
spiral”, because the final outcome of the process is the 
complete deterioration of the existing infrastructure. Figure 
2 presents the argument graphically. In the following 
sections, we indicate how to calculate resilience tipping 
points of irrigation systems.  
 
              
 
 
Figure 2. Maintenance and infrastructure losses: k  is the 
value of the infrastucture at time t and k1, its resilience tipping point. 
Below that point, the death spiral dominates (maintenance<infrastructure 
losses) and the system collapses to k0, while above it the stabilization loop 
dominates the system`s dynamics and it will recover its former operation 
conditions (k2).  
 
 
III. METHODOLOGY 
A more rigorous analysis for how important dynamic 
patterns arise in social ecological from feedback structures 
can be found in the classical Richardson’s [11] paper on 
loop dominance, on which this paper is based.  
According to Richardson, the polarity of a single 
feedback loop involving a single level x and an inflow rate 
 = dx/dt is defined by sign
 , which is consistent 
with a more intuitive characterization as follows. The 
denominator of the fraction – dx – can be thought of as a 
small change in x, for instance a small change in fish caught 
in a particular fishery, which is traced around the loop until 
it results in a small change - d
in the inflow rate, say in 
the regeneration rate of the system,  = 
. If the change in 
the rate, d  , is in the same direction as the change in the 
level, dx, then they have the same sign. As 
 is an inflow 
rate and thus is added to the level, the loop is a positive one 
and hence reinforces the initial change In such case 
sign
 is positive and will be negative if the polarity of 
the loop is negative, that is if the resulting change in the 
inflow rate is in the oposite direction to the change dx. If  
is an outflow rate, all we have to do to extend the above 
definition for loop polarity is to attach a negative sign to the 
expression for 
, since variation in the same direction in 
the outflow, e.g in the death rate, and in the level, e.g. in the 
fish population means that the loop polarity is negative. 
In order to identify irrigation systems’ resilience tipping 
points, that is the points where systems dynamics shift from 
an equilibrium behavior pattern to an exponential decay one, 
we propose a codified procedure to Richardson’s ideas 
based on a generalization of the simple stability test 
proposed by Ford [5: 54-55], and developed by  Bueno [1]. 
The idea is to introduce a change in the system and 
watch how it reacts. The level variable is any stock in the 
model we wish to test. If the stock returns to the original 
value after the system is hit by an exogenous shock, the 
equilibrium is stable. On the contrary, if the stock moves 
farther and farther away from the equilibrium, the 
equilibrium is unstable. In the first case, we can say that the 
loop polarity of the feedback structure is negative while in 
the second case it is positive. Our conjecture is that the loss 
of resilience of irrigation systems can be seen as a 
bifurcation point where loop polarity changes from negative 
to positive sign .  
 
The procedure is as follows: 
 
 
1) Choose a variable of interest (x) that represents 
the resource users want to preserve and whose 
state they are able to assess. 
2) Compute the ratio 
 for the observed 
conditions of the system and over a chosen 
reference time interval, attaching a negative 
sign to  if  
is an outflow rate 
3)  Choose a parameter that can vary  
 . Use 
the parameter to vary that ratio until 
 
changes sign in the reference time interval.

4) Compute the value of the variable of interest at 
the point where 
 changes sign and compare 
this value to the equilibrium value obtained in 
the last run before 
 shifts sign to identify 
the tipping point of the variable of interest 
which is inside this interval. The critical value 
of the variable of the interest assessed from the 
parameter chosen is the last equilibrium value 
before the sign shifts.   
 
5)  Repeat steps 2-4 for other parameters. 
 
6) Select the largest of the critical value of the 
variable of interest obtained by steps 2-4 as the 
critical resilience level of the system and 
compare this to the actual observed level ( or 
the simulated level at the actual observed 
conditions of the fishery); resilience degree is 
computed as: 
                  
                                      
 
IV. RESULTS 
Assuming the variable of the interest is the irrigation 
infrastructure and performing calculations only for the 
parameter rain regime, Figure 3a shows that an irrigation 
system can lose sustainability due to small variations in 
environmental conditions. A reduction of 0.1% in the annual 
precipitation from year 20 to year 24 (35.2% drought → 
35.3% drought) is enough to put the system on the collapse 
mode if it is operating close to its tipping point. In that 
mode, irrigators are unable to pay maintenance dues and, 
hence, maintenance falls below depreciation and the 
variable of interest – infrastructure – enter into a downward 
endogenous trajectory (Figure 3c). 
It is noticed that between, say, years 25-45, 
unsustainable systems present a slowing down pattern 
before an abrupt change. This result – which indicates the 
tension among stabilizing (e.g., the stabilization loop) and 
amplifying (e.g., the death spiral) feedback loops working in 
tandem upon the system’s dynamics near tipping points - 
has been identified as a universal property of systems 
approaching that threshold, and hence may be seen as an 
early warning signal of sustainability loss [14]. 
When the system is operating in collapse mode as in 
Figure 3e), the  ratio 
 shifts from negative to positive in 
year 49, which allows to compute its resilience tipping point 
as indicated in step  6 above. This indicates infrastructure 
has started to deteriorate at an increasing rate, progressively 
moving away from its equilibrium value. When the system 
is operating in the equilibrium mode (Fig. 3d), on the other 
hand, the system’s loop polarity shifts from positive to 
negative, indicating that the system will approach an 
equilibrium path afterwards. 
As indicated in the Section I, the explanation of why the 
system displays an explosive behavior is that it becomes 
dominated by amplifying loops, as the death spiral in our 
basic model. 
 
 
V. DISCUSSION 
 
Simulations performed in Section III suggest that a 
major reason for the loss of sustainability of an irrigation 
system is the inability of farmers to perform O & M 
properly. At the system`s tipping point, i.e. at year 49, the 
infrastructure reaches the critical value in which profits 
equal household expenses: US$ 150,000. At this point, 
system´s resilience degree is zero, according the indicator 
calculated in step 6. Environmental shocks like droughts, 
henceforth, can lead irrigation systems to collapse by 
reducing the incomes of the irrigators below the level 
consistent with both maintenance dues and the payment of 
household expenses necessary for the survival of farmers 
and their families. 
Now, imagine that after realizing that the system is on a 
collapse trajectory government decides to intervene, 
financing the total annual spending on maintenance costs in 
a particular year. It is easy to infer that if government acts 
timely by complementing private maintenance before the 
tipping point, say at year 47, the system will be able to 
recover relatively easily (Figure 4). But, if it postpones 
intervention even just for one or two years, the system will 
collapse, because it may already be dominated by the death 
spiral loop.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
Mostly because measurement or predictions of 
thresholds in socio-ecological systems (SESs) have low 
precision, the precise meaning of resilience and its 
identification still remain a subject of debate. This work has 
attempted to bridge that gap by providing a relatively simple 
procedure to assess resilience in a particular type of SESs - 
irrigation systems - based on loop dominance analysis. The 
proposed procedure uses changes in loop polarity from 
negative to positive as a signal of resilience loss. 
Specifically, it is shown that irrigation systems lose 
resilience when stabilizing (negative) feedback loops stop 
dominating dynamics forcing farmers´ income in a 
downward endogenous trajectory that impairs the ability of 
producers to carry out the necessary maintenance expenses. 
Hence, problems of maintenance of irrigation systems 
operating near tipping points can many times be explained 
by the inability of users to pay for maintenance of 
infrastructure and not by their refusal to pay the costs to 
maintain systems integrity. But can this approach 
(complemented by other techniques) help identify early 
signs of loss of resilience in order to enable government 
agencies to act timely to prevent the collapse of fragile 
irrigation systems? 
Recent developments in the field of dynamical systems 
have suggested so. A number of generic symptoms may 
occur in a wide class of systems as they approach tipping 
points. One of those symptoms, which can indeed be 
considered as a universal property of systems approaching 
tipping points, is a phenomenon known in dynamical 
systems theory as critical slowing down [3]. Systems’ 
dynamics in such case is dominated by a damped, driven 
effect created when positive and negative feedbacks operate 
in tandem.  This implies that systems operating near tipping 
points become increasingly slow in recovering from small 
perturbations, due to the fact that amplifying (positive) 
feedbacks loops, such as the “death spiral”, begin to offset 
the stabilizing effect of negative feedback loops as the 
stabilization loop in model presented in Figure 1, that is 
becoming less resilient in terms of this work [9]. Figure 4 
depicts this characteristic slowing down process in action as 
an irrigation system approaches its tipping point: the later 
the system recovers original characteristics, the longer the 
return time to a sustainable exploitation path. Applied 
literature has tested a number of techniques to check 
whether the theoretically predicted critical slowing down 
may indeed be identified in actual complex systems, such as 
sensitivity and time series analyses. For instance, a way to 
test whether a system is slowing down is to interpret 
fluctuations in the state of the system as it responds to 
natural perturbations. Slowing down then should be 
reflected as a decrease in the rates of changing of the system 
near systems’ tipping point (calculated by the approach 
proposed in this work), which may be measured by an 
increase in the short term correlation in key variables time 
series [7], such as farmer’s income. 
Unfortunately, there are signals that process is already 
taking place in several regions of the world. Growth in 
irrigation, mainly in arid countries in the Middle and Near 
East, has dramatically slowed over the last decades to a rate 
that is inadequate to keep up with the expanding food 
requirements. Besides, extensive areas of land in a number 
of countries have been degraded by waterlogging and 
salinization resulting of poor agricultural management and 
maintenance, which has resulted in major environmental 
disturbances and raised doubts about its very sustainability 
in many places in the world [12]. As a consequence of these 
problems, there will be probably fewer investments in new 
and existing irrigation projects in the future that have been 
made in the last decades, unless major improvements in the 
operation and maintenance of existing irrigation systems can 
bring those systems back to sustainable patterns of use, 
particularly in the world’s poorest regions.
