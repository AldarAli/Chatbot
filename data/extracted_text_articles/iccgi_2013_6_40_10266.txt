Abstract- In this study, a new method has been developed for 
the detection of brain tumor in magnetic resonance images. 
Magnetic resonance images are analyzed using the Zernike 
moments and different orders of Zernike moments are 
calculated. The image is divided into two parts from the center 
of the image. The average value of the pixels located at the 
central line is calculated. The new vectors of the pixel are 
formed based on the calculated average value. The value 
obtained from the low and high order of Zernike moments are 
used to calculate the proper threshold value which can extract 
the tumor efficiently. The proposed method was tested with the 
different magnetic resonance images containing tumor and the 
algorithm was successful to analyze the tumor part from the 
brain image.

 INTRODUCTION 
According to the data of World Health Organization 
(WHO), more than 400000 persons take the treatment of 
brain tumor every year [29]. Treatment of brain tumor is a 
difficult task. It is believed that a careful diagnosis might 
save patients life. The segmentation of brain tumor from 
Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is a difficult task  that 
involves several disciplines such as pathology, MRI physics, 
radiologist’s perception, and image analysis based on 
intensity, shape and size. There are several issues and 
challenges in proper segmentation of brain tumor. Tumors 
differ with shape, size and location and varies with their 
intensity. The accurate segmentation of brain tumor is of 
great 
interest. 
Most 
patients 
in 
hospital 
undergo 
Computerised Tomography (CT) scan and MRI for the 
identification of tumor part in the brain. Manual 
segmentation is risky most of the time and may create 
problem during the diagnosis by naked eye. Therefore, it is 
always necessary to use an automatic method to extract the 
tumor part of the brain; this reduces the human error. 
Different methods and approaches have been proposed 
for the extraction of brain tumor. Some methods are manual, 
others are semi-automatic and  others are automatic. Fuzzy, 
clustering, edge detection, region growing, and level set 
methods are introduced in the field of segmentation. 
Clustering-based methods, such as K-means clusteting, have 
a fast speed even on large datesets but they doesn’t provide 
the same result in each run due to their dependency on 
initial 
random 
assignments 
[1-2]. 
Hierarchial 
self-
organizing  map- based multiscale image segmentation [3] 
and 3D variational segmentation-based methods [4] were 
also used for the image segmentaiton [5,6].  
These methods used artificial intelligence techniques 
for automated tumor segmentation. Statistical pattern 
recognition based methods [7,8-10] fall short, partly because 
large deformations occur in the intracranial tissues due to 
the growth of the tumor and edema. However, these 
tehniques need to significiantly modify the brain atlas to 
accomodate the tumors, which specially lead to poor results. 
The method presented by Singh and Dubey method [27] 
used the marker based watershed approach to segment the 
tumor, but it is not an efficient method because it loses 
tumor information and it is time consuming. Most  
researchers are using Markov random fields (MRFs) [11,12], 
which involve estimating the parameters for a parametric 
model that has one set of parameters to express the 
probability that each specific voxel is a tumor, and another 
set to express the distribution over the labels for a pair of 
adjacent voxels. In  Gray Level Co-occurance Matrix 
(GLCM) method [14], there is an inherent problem to 
choose the optimal inter-pixel distance in a given situation. 
Zernike moments are the mapping of an image onto a set of 
complex Zernike polynomials [15]. J.K. Udupa et al. [16] 
combined morphological process and the region growing 
methods in order to determine tumor volume. Based on the 
fuzzy logic, Khotanzad and Hong[17] used the fuzzy 
clustering or the fuzzy connectedness for addressing the 
problem of abnormal tissue segmentation and classification. 
Some authors [18-21] used Zernike moments and 
implemented in the area of image analysis. Zernike 
polynomials are orthogonal to each other. Zernike moments 
can represent the properties of an image with no redundancy 
or overlap information between the moments [22]. Due to 
these properties, Zernike moments have been widely used in 
different types of applications [15]. Zernike moments have 
been used in shape based image retrieval [23], feature set 
[24] and edge detection in pattern recognition [25]. Even  
though Zernike moments are used in various fields, they hve 
drawbacks 
of 
computational 
complexity 
that 
make 
unsuitable for real time application. 
In this paper, a new method has been developed for the 
diagnosis of the MR images containing tumor. The main 
aim of the paper is to extract the tumor part efficiently from 
MR images and reduce human manual interaction. The 
detail of Zernike moments has been described in section II, 
the detail algorithm for the extraction of brain tumor has

PROPOSED METHOD 
In this paper, the value of low and high order Zernike 
moments are used to segment the tumor from the MR 
images. The input image is divided into two parts with 
different pixels value. The division of pixel is performed 
vertically from the center of the image. The low order and 
high order Zernike moments are calculated using Equ. (5). 
The values of low and high order Zernike polynomials are 
used to calculate low and high order of Zernike moments 
respectively. In the proposed method, different values of 
Zernike moments are calculated at different order. Thus, 
obtained value is utilized to calculate the mean value, which 
separates the tumor from the image. The detail procedure 
for extraction of tumor image is discussed in the following 
section. 
A. Feature extraction and Selection 
The image is divided into two left and right 
hemispheres. These two hemispheres of the image contain 
complex Zernike moment value. The division of pixel is 
based on the average value of the pixels located at the center 
boundary of image.  
Let us assume that (

complex Zernike moments value.

b x y
 is the image 
pixels located at the center boundary of image. We calculate 
the average value of the pixel ( , )
b x y  located at the center 
boundary of the image as shown in the fig. (1). Average 
pixel value is calculated using following equation.

where, N  is the total number of pixels located at the center

The image is divided into left and right hemisphere; 
choose the minimum pixel values (that is not zero) from the 
left hemisphere of the divided image. Thus, form vector of 
all the pixels that lies between minimum values of the left 
hemisphere of the image to the average value Avgvalue of 
the boundary. Similarly, choose the minimum value of pixel 
from the right hemisphere of the image to the average value
Avgvalue of the center boundary of the image. Thus, vector 
form is the range of minimum pixel value from the left and 
right hemisphere to the average value of central boundary 
pixel. These pixels vector are combined together and treated 
as a single image

Fig. 3-7 show the different images obtained from the 
proposed method and other two methods, region grow and 
Singh and Dubey method.  In Fig. 3 (a) is the original image 
with the huge mass of tumor. Fig. 3(b), (c) and (d) are the 
tumor images obtained by the proposed, region 
Singh and Dubey method respectively. It is clear from the 
experimental results that the proposed method effectively 
extracts the tumor part accurately rather than other two 
methods. Similarly, from Figs. 4-7, the proposed method 
gives better results in comparison to other methods. 
Therefore, by subjective analysis it is clear that
method outperforms the other two methods 
of tumor part from the input brain MRI images.
To prove the proposed method is better than the 
grows and Singh and Dubey method quantitatively, we 
calculate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
complexity. 
Root mean square error (RMSE): it is a quadratic 
scoring rule which measures the average magnitude of the 
error. The RMSE value is calculated as

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, an efficient method for the extraction of 
brain tumor has been introduced. The proposed method is 
based on the Zernike moments. The high order Zernike 
moments not only have very high computational complexity 
but they are even sensitive to noise. Therefore, the proper 
value should be chosen that is shown in above table. Some 
values from the low order Zernike moments are chosen
that high order value does not have much effect during the 
computation value of mean value. T
values from the low and high order Zernike moments are 
able to extract the tumor part from the different kinds of

brain tumor images invariant of its shape, size and intensity. 
The method proposed here is simpler and easy to understand. 
Even the proposed method is able to extract the tumor 
efficiently from the MR images; it also paves the way for 
the expert to decide whether the extracted brain tumor is 
benign and malignant due to many pathological features. 
This will be the subject of future research.
