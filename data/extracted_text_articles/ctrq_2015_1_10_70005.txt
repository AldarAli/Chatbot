Abstract — Business communication should become more 
effective through Unified Communications (UC) solutions. 
With UC, communication services such as telephony, video 
conferencing, presence, chat, file sharing, etc. become available 
independent of location or end device. Seamless mobility - the 
possibility of remaining connected on a mobile device while the 
connection is being handed off between different networks - is 
the most important technical factor in efficient mobile 
communication, especially in the field of UC telephony, which 
uses both conventional mobile and Internet Protocol (IP) 
networks for voice calls. Unforeseeable external influences on 
the quality of service (QoS) and unforeseeable operating 
conditions of the mobile technology frequently result in 
connection disruptions. This wastes the user’s time and energy 
and results in a poor performance rating. Based on the 
example of a mobile UC solution, this paper presents the 
requirements placed on mobile UC telephony. The QoS 
barriers, user expectations, and principles for the design of 
QoS-sensitive interaction are summarized. An example is 
provided of how the UC-telephony user’s quality of experience 
(QoE) can be increased on the basis of a Handover 
Convenience Information Support (HOCIS) by means of 
implementing QoS-sensitive user interaction.

 INTRODUCTION 
To achieve reliable seamless mobility, i.e., the possibility 
for the user to remain continuously connected across various 
network standards, current and future technologies for the 
development 
of 
a 
Unified 
Communications 
(UC) 
environment must be able to handle differing – both known 
and unknown – connection standards, end devices, and 
application combinations [1]. To ensure this, both network 
technologies and user navigation must continuously be 
expanded. The key points of this paper summarize the results 
of a user-centric design approach that foresees both an 
expansion of network compatibility and of user experience. 
It is the researchers’ goal to perform an innovation process in 
developing a user-friendly interface for mobile UC, by the 
means of a patent-based QoS-sensitive backend technology. 
The process aims at improving the Quality of Experience 
(QoE) of mobile workers [2] potentially using UC telephony. 
Hence, 
the 
following 
Sections 
summarize 
the 
implementation process (analysis, planning, design and 
development, evaluation, optimization, and implementation) 
of the so-called “Handover Convenience Information 
System“ patent (HOCIS) [3] in the mobile clients of an 
existing 
Voice 
over 
Internet 
Protocol 
(VoIP) 
UC 
environment. The results stated in this paper are excerpts 
from the transfer research between the TELES FMC+C 
Innovations GmbH and the Institute of Electronic Business 
(IEB). To that end, the IEB performed, among other things, 
primary and secondary research in the form of expert and 
development workshops, as well as user surveys, focus 
groups, and analyses of literature. The paper is structured in 
two main parts. Whereas Sections II to IV provide an 
overview of current service and design challenges as well as 
the researchers’ findings for a QoS-sensitive user experience 
design (UXD), Sections V and VI present the case study 
report of the research-based innovation process, which led 
from a network technology patent to a user centric service 
implementation.

QOS SERVICE BARRIERS AND RAMIFICATIONS FOR 
THE USE OF MOBILE UC

technology 
will 
determine 
the 
future 
of 
telecommunications [4]. However, according to estimates, 
there are few concrete figures on the actual use and 
prevalence of UC technologies. In 2011, Ralf Lehmann 
spoke of a limited UC prevalence (12 percent) and usage 
primarily by large corporations [5]. Just as little information 
is available about the development as on the actual 
prevalence; there are hardly any figures for the providers’ 
network failure and disruption rates. If it can be assumed 
that higher data rates and better Wi-Fi connections can be 
found in offices than the comparatively high fluctuations of 
mobile networks, the UC technologies in the end depend on 
the provider’s quality of service. External disruptions occur 
frequently [6]. This holds true especially for mobile data 
transmission, as here the utilization of the faster Fourth 
Generation (4G)/Long-term Evolution (LTE) technology is 
relatively rare. In Germany, for instance, significantly less 
than 10 percent of mobile communication customers use the 
new LTE technology, while classical telephony and

Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) 
Internet are much more important for the majority of users 
[6]. Beyond this differing prevalence of technical standards, 
the technical challenges, for example, circuit switched 
fallback (CSFB), must also be overcome [8]. Consequently, 
unknown disruptions and interruptions, varying connection 
and network standards and unforeseeable usages must be 
taken for granted in technology that uses VoIP. 
For the user, such connection and bandwidth problems 
in mobile or stationary VoIP usage have a negative impact 
or result in a communication breakdown. In such cases, 
users frequently resort to the simple call with the generally 
better-established Second Generation (2G)/Global System 
for 
Mobile 
Communications 
(GSM). 
For 
the 
communication process, this generally results in a change of 
application and telephone number. Such connection 
problems waste the user’s time and are frustrating. On the 
other hand, for providers of UC solutions, such situations 
represent the hazard that the negative perception will be 
directed at the application. Qualitative interviews by the IEB 
have shown that in cases of a disruption, a user can rarely 
distinguish between QoS, bandwidth problems, or software 
failures. 
III. 
QOS AND QOE – REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DESIGN OF 
QOS-SENSITIVE USER INTERACTION 
UC telephony aims to provide increased communication 
effectiveness, in particular for business telephony. The IEB 
conducted a user group analysis and surveys of a group of 
demographically diverse volunteers for the purpose of 
determining user needs in UC telephony clients. The results 
showed that the user group of this technology is 
heterogeneous and their specific requirements can hardly be 
predicted. This technical and user-specific variability for the 
expansion of seamless mobility in the professional UC 
environment shows that mobile telephony applications will 
have to be able to react flexibly to usage-specific and 
technical influences. The expert workshops and focus 
groups demonstrated that along with the requirements for 
the flexible use of the application, the user also requires a 
simplification of the technical processes and functional 
possibilities. Surprisingly, fundamental feedback about 
telephony status was expressed as one of the primary wishes 
of the users. It is precisely this example that shows that the 
service blueprints of conventional mobile telephony 
apparently contain gaps between the background processes 
and users’ activities. This means that background processes, 
such as network status and quality or network handovers, 
have not yet been sufficiently expanded as touch-points (i.e. 
interaction moments between device and user). The 
volunteers requested a touch-point for the immediate 
information about the call being broken off as a service 
function. Furthermore, those surveyed displayed a great 
discrepancy in their understanding of technology and in 
their willingness to learn, as well as in the telephony and 
cost behavior. For these differing uses and contexts, there 
was the requirement that universal, comprehensible, but 
individually configurable service functions would have to be 
designed. 
The 
application-specific 
user 
requirements 
therefore 
must 
be 
implemented 
with 
the 
primary 
requirement of user friendliness (according to Richter these 
are: Effectiveness, efficiency, performance, promotion of 
learning, 
learnability, 
potential 
to 
be 
remembered, 
flexibility, degree of freedom, adjustment, satisfaction, 
acceptance, task suitability, customization to individual 
needs, transparency, openness, self-descriptiveness, support, 
compatibility, conformance to expectations, consistency, 
uniformity, 
tolerance, 
fault 
tolerance, 
feedback, 
manageability, controllability) [9] – and always pursuing the 
aim of allowing for an interruption-free call.  
IV. 
QOS AND QOE – PRINCIPLES FOR THE DESIGN OF 
QOS-SENSITIVE USER INTERACTION 
QoS-sensitive interaction is a unique segment of the 
field of interaction design that needed be achieved. Whereas 
video telephony software like Microsoft’s Skype offers a 
visual and acoustic feedback when a call is temporarily 
interrupted, voice telephony applications rarely give a 
prompt feedback. The herein described approach on QoS-
sensitive user interaction with (HOCIS) convenience 
messages requires more elements than hold or waiting 
music. Whilst other UC applications such as Unify’s Soft 
Client, Cisco’s Jabber or ComdaSys’ MC Client partly 
provide service functions like network handover between 
different mobile data networks and handover functions 
between devices, this approach aims at providing an 
integrated set of QoS-sensitive support functions for all UC 
telephony options. This development focuses on a user 
interaction principles which combines status information, 
options 
evaluation 
and 
user 
assistance. 
From 
the 
accompanying research and development, the IEB has 
determined the following principles that must be pursued in 
the design of the user interaction and call control: The 
graphical user interface (GUI) should be based as closely as 
possible on the specific interaction habits using Android or 
Apple’s mobile Operating System (iOS). Here, however, a 
distinction between the phones’ basic telephony application 
and the UC application is still required. The handling of the 
interaction scenarios, during and prior to the call, requires 
adaptability to individual user preferences. For the sound 
design of the user interaction, the evaluation with the focus 
groups showed that a design similar to the telephone sounds 
the users have already learned, so-called auditory icons (use 
of such sounds, which are taken from daily life and that are 
closely linked to the event used for because of previous 
experiences (for instance: crumple up a paper). A 
multidimensional conveyance of information is possible, for 
instance, through indications regarding, size, age, or size of 
a problem) [10], does not provide enough distinction. For 
innovative functional parameters like warnings, abstract 
sounds, i.e., earcons (abstract, synthetic sound events which 
can create an own, simple language, with variations 
(density, timbre, level, speed, frequency) of melodic or 
rhythmic motifs) [11], have proven to be more effective. 
The design of the sounds takes on a more important role 
than the conventional design of internal, functional sounds, 
such as waiting music and call waiting. The fact that most 
service functions occur during the call means that the

challenge is to provide a sensitive sound design that 
provides the user with the necessary information about the 
function and purpose [12] while simultaneously creating a 
minimum level of distraction. The design of the functional 
sounds is subject to special volume (amplitude), pitch 
(frequency), and timbre (spectrum) [13] requirements. They 
should be audible within complex user contexts, but also 
distinguishable from the device’s own telephony application 
sounds. These goals can be reached by integrating various 
functional parameters in a “family” of sounds. The specific 
requirements for QoS-sensitive interaction design are part of 
the fundamental need to communicate complex, technical 
processes in multisensory messages and implement them in 
options. To properly service user expectations and user 
demands, the messages must be customizable and adjustable 
in both form and function. These principles are also applied 
in the following case study. 
V. 
CASE STUDY: IMPLEMENTATION OF CONVENIENCE 
MESSAGES IN TELES FMC+C‘S UC1000 
The requirements for the QoS user interaction described 
above are the result of recommendations for the 
implementation of the HOCIS patent in the existing mobile 
UC clients of the TELES FMC+C company, which is 
currently available for iOS and Android devices [14]. Key 
Features of this client are: Single-number service; Seamless 
call handover between GSM and Wi-Fi, UMTS and LTE 
with convenience messages; Mobile VoIP, callback and 
callthrough; Visual voicemail, fax, presence and instant 
messaging; Extension dialing; Integrated corporate address 
book; Call transfer from desk phone to mobile phone and 
vice versa; Mobile access to desk phone features; 
Customizable to any IP Centrex or IP Centrex. Beyond the 
functions typical for UC, such as single-number service, 
instant 
messaging, 
presence, 
integrated 
company 
phonebook, etc. the application provides special features, 
including seamless handover between GSM, Wireless 
Fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology, UMTS, and LTE connections, 
and 
“convenience 
messages” 
which 
communicate 
information about the status of the telephony service to the 
user based on a QoS-sensitive evaluation of the telephone 
background process. The process of evaluating QoS input 
and translating it into so-called events is handled by the 
patented HOCIS solution. In particular, QoS information 
such as signal strength, packet loss, jitter, latency, as well as 
information about roaming status and network availability 
or loss, are evaluated, interpreted and reported in events 
(Table I).

These eight events of the HOCIS patent are the inputs 
that are available for the QoE/QoS service functions and 
option menus for the UC1000 mobile clients. These events 
form the interface between the background processes and 
the user. The corresponding design of the touch-points 
provides the user with 10 use cases so as to allow more 
effective and reliable VoIP-UC telephony. To that end, 
service functions in the use cases (Table II) distinguish 
between the network and the device prior to and during the 
call and the handover. In accordance with a successful or 
failed service process, the interaction is designed so that 
continuous communication is maintained. 
The aim of QoS-sensitive convenience messages is to 
offer the user the greatest number of alternative options for 
an ongoing communication process. The decision as per 
which events and their corresponding messages were 
implemented in the frontend of the client and which ones 
were considered as background processes, in other words as 
automatic service functions, was based on the researcher’s 
user experience design (UXD) process which included 
qualitative and quantitative methods. This process consisted 
of the above-mentioned expert workshops, focus groups and 
usability tests. 
Based on the results of this process, the TELES system 
of “Convenience Messages” consists of multisensory 
elements that allow the user to receive the corresponding 
system messages for any system, always with the aim of 
providing a more comfortable and reliable telephoning 
experience. Among the elements included in multisensory 
convenience messaging (see example in Table III) are: 
graphic 
elements, 
text

(on-display) 
sound 
elements, vibration elements, light-emitting diodes (LED),

different

to be notified by sound, LED or vibration. Each of these 
elements can be set or adjusted in the application’s settings 
menu and used in combination or individually. The user’s 
preferences are then also reflected in the user’s cost 
behavior: the user may prefer a less expensive connection 
(and a higher risk of connection loss and warnings about 
disruptions) or high connection quality and call continuity 
(with possible higher costs). The configuration menu allows 
for settings that reflect the preference for these service 
functions. Depending on the service function (costs or 
quality), the individual elements (sound/vibration/LED) can 
be set separately. In another sub-menu a choice between 
“optimization” and “warning” can be set according to the 
user’s preference. Not only can the user define whether or 
not to be informed about cost features with an on/off switch, 
but a sub-section also provides an option to be warned about 
cost hazards or separately informed about potential cost 
savings.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Mobile UC/UCC telephony is a permanent service process 
(voice call availability and continuity). User touch-points of 
the UC/UCC service result from telecommunication 
activities. These are triggered by the user, but are controlled 
by permanent and situational background processes. The 
UC1000 mobile client including convenience messages 
improves the telephony experience by means of specially 
designed QoS sensitive messages that support the user of 
mobile VoIP telephony and provide greater transparency and 
opportunities for intervention. The increase in QoE occurs 
in particular through: 
• 
Improved telephony quality resulting from the use 
of innovative network technology 
• 
Automatic user navigation in handling connection 
problems 
• 
Feedback about the telephone connection and call 
quality, and warnings about possible interruptions  
• 
Tips for improved connection options and call 
quality 
• 
Assurance of improved user telephony experience 
through service-oriented user interaction 
• 
Consolidation of the QoS and QoE relationship

• 
Extension of seamless mobility 
For the users of the UC1000 Mobile with HOCIS, the 
implementation of QoS-sensitive messages and service 
functions offers the potential for increased QoE in UC 
telephony. Beyond the basic feedback about the status of the 
telephony service, the UC1000 with HOCIS also offers 
service functions such as cost control, cost warning, quality 
warning, device management, and forewarning features. 
These features provide the user with transparency, extended 
options, and control of telephone bills and private and 
business telephony with a single device. 
The merger of the extended network handover 
technology HOCIS with an integrated research and 
interaction design process through the IEB has resulted in a 
user-oriented expansion of the UC1000 to include the 
HOCIS application. Reliable connections, transparency, and 
user navigation are increased by means of a service-oriented 
interaction concept. Each user can individually configure 
how to be informed, warned, and assisted with QoS service 
functions – through text, graphics, sound, LED, vibration or 
voice messages. The innovative core is in the development 
of multisensory user navigation, which is based on an 
interaction concept with its own sound design, voice 
messages, and media elements. The result is an improved 
sense of QoS and increased QoE of professional UC 
telephony. The UC1000 with HOCIS, including QoS-
sensitive convenience messages, is a system that routinely 
aids the professional user’s telephone communication 
efficiently and in a service-oriented manner, across all UC 
functions. 
This example for the implementation of convenience 
messaging in an existing UC client on the basis of the 
HOCIS technology demonstrates a unique approach for 
QoS-sensitive user interaction. The possibility to adapt this 
system to any provider’s telephony infrastructure shows that 
the potential greatly exceeds the application in Unified 
Communications. Based on this result, it can be assumed 
that QoS-sensitive user interaction offers opportunities for 
wider-ranging applications in telecommunications and 
consolidates the QoS/QoE ratio to the user’s benefit.
