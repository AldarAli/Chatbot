Abstract—In
this
paper,
we
address
the
temperature
dependences of sensing properties of a GaAs-based bipolar
transistor
with
a
metal-semiconductor-metal
hydrogen-
sensitive sensor. Experimental results reveal that (1) response
times obtained from the sensing base and collector currents in
0.01% H2/N2 are 350 s and 400 s at 50oC; (2) Only a power
consumption of 0.25 to 1.25 W is required in a standby mode;
and (3) the sensing collector current gain in 1% H2/N2 is
increased from 900 at 25oC to 1910 at 50oC, then to 2010 at
80oC and finally to 2890 at 110oC.

INTRODUCTION
Hydrogen has been widely used as an energy carrier,
while its flammable and explosive properties make the safety
an important issue. After the report on detection of hydrogen
using a Si-based metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) structure
[1],
metal-semiconductor
(MS)
diodes
and
field-effect
transistors (FETs) [2][4] combined with catalytic metals
were employed as hydrogen-sensitive sensors. Commonly
accepted sensing sequences for the MS-type sensors are as
follows:
the
hydrogen
molecules
are
adsorbed
and
dissociated at the metal surface, followed by forming a
dipole layer at the MS interface. Therefore, a lowering of
Schottky barrier height due to the dipole layer brings about
an increased current [4]. However, these forward-biased MS-
type sensors in a standby mode generally produce quite large
power consumption. In this work, GaAs-based bipolar
transistors were fabricated with MSM hydrogen-sensitive
sensors to evaluate temperature dependence of sensing
properties.
Experiments
and
measurements
about
the
proposed hydrogen sensor are described in Section II. In
Section III, experimental results including key merits, such
as sensitivity and response time, are addressed. Finally,
conclusions are drawn in Section IV.
II.
EXPERIMENTS
A GaAs-based transistor together with a MSM hydrogen-
sensitive sensor was proposed in this work. Figure 1(a)
shows
cross
sectional
view
of
the
proposed
sensor.
Structured parameters can be found in [5]. Fabrication of the
GaAs-based transistor started with performing the emitter
and the base mesas in the transistor region. The emitter, the
collector, and the base Ohmic contacts were formed by
depositing AuGeNi and AuZn upon the cap, the sub-
collector and the base layers, respectively. The base-emitter
and the base-collector junction areas are AE = 2.5610-4 cm2
and AC = 1.7610-3 cm2, respectively. The MSM hydrogen-
sensitive sensor is fabricated with two Schottky electrodes
formed by depositing a 30 nm Pd mixture on the collector
layer. The sensing area of each multiple-finger electrode is
810-4 cm2, resulting in a MSM structure with a diode
current smaller than 510-8 A. Common-emitter current gains
of our GaAs-based bipolar transistor are generally smaller
than unity when the base current is smaller than 10-7 A. Thus,
such small diode current will not be amplified by the GaAs-
based bipolar transistor and low power consumption is
expected for our sensor in a standby mode.

Figure 1(b) shows an equivalent circuit symbol of the
proposed sensor. In order to carry out our hydrogen detection,
a custom-made, 235 ml flow-through test chamber was used.
The test temperatures were at 25oC, 50oC, 80oC, and 110oC.
Various
hydrogen-containing
gases
with
specific
gas
concentrations of 0.01% to 1% H2/N2 were employed at a
flow rate of 500 sccm (Standard Cubic Centimeter per
Minute). Static and dynamic sensing currents were measured
using a HP semiconductor parameter analyzer.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Response time is an important feature for a gas sensor.
Figure 2 shows the transient current response of the proposed
sensor, called hydrogen sensing transistor, to the introduction
and removal of various hydrogen-containing gases at 50oC.
The hydrogen sensing transistor is biased at VBE=2 V and
VCE=5 V. Notice that IBN (ICN) and IBH (ICH) are the base
(collector)
currents
in
N2
and
hydrogen-containing
ambiences, respectively. Due to limited measurements, the
two transient currents were not recorded during the same run.
The measured IBH starts to increase at the time when a 1%
H2/N2 gas is introduced. After saturation in the IBH, air gas is
used to completely remove the 1% H2/N2 and the IBH returns
to its baseline. Measurements were repeatedly performed in
ambiences cycled from air/N2 to other hydrogen-containing
gases and then back to air/N2. It is found that IBH saturates at
2.8410-6 A in 1% H2/N2 while ICH is much larger (1.410-4
A). This is reasonable since IBH is amplified by the GaAs-
based transistor. We also find that tas obtained from IBH and
ICH depend on both hydrogen concentration and ambient
temperature. The response times defined in [4] in 0.01%
H2/N2 are 350 s and 400 s from IBH and ICH at 50oC.
Obviously, the proposed sensor produces good repeatability
since IBH and ICH were not recorded at the same run while
they respond well to various hydrogen-containing gases.

Figure 3 shows temperature dependences of sensing
properties of the GaAs-based hydrogen sensing transistor.
Basically, our hydrogen sensing transistor is formed by
connecting the base electrode of the GaAs-based transistor
with the MSM hydrogen-sensitive sensor. Eventually, the
base current is mainly dominated by the MSM diode which
has its current independent of biased voltage. Thus, a
constant VBE = 3.0 V is now employed to bias the hydrogen
sensing transistor. Instead of a conventional base current, N2
and various hydrogen-containing gases are now used as input
signals while sensing collector currents (ICN and ICH) are
employed as output signals. When the hydrogen sensing
transistor is subjected into a N2 ambience, it is in a standby
mode. Figure 3(a) is indicative of ICN = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and
0.25 A at 25oC, 50oC, 80oC, and 110oC, respectively. Only
a power consumption of 0.25 to 1.25 W is required for our
hydrogen sensing transistor. When the hydrogen sensing
transistor is in a hydrogen-containing ambience, a dipole-
induced current occurring in the MSM hydrogen-sensitive
sensor will act as the base current (IBH) that is then amplified
by the GaAs-based transistor to ICH. As a result, relative high
static sensing collector currents are expected. Figures 3(b) to
3(d) show ICH versus VCE characteristics of the hydrogen
sensing transistor subjected into various hydrogen-containing
ambiences for 5-fold ta. Experimental results reveal that ICH
in 1% H2/N2 at VCE = 3.0 V is increased from 45 A at 25oC
to 191 A at 50oC, then to 301 A at 80oC and finally to 723
A at 110oC. Estimated sensing collector current gains (GC)
are as high as 900, 1910, 2010, and 2890 for the hydrogen
sensing transistor in 1% H2/N2 at 25oC, 50oC, 80oC, and
110oC, respectively. Even if the proposed sensor is in a
0.01% H2/N2 ambience, GC = 360 (850) is still obtained at
25oC (110oC).

CONCLUSIONS
Hydrogen sensing properties of a GaAs-based hydrogen
sensing transistors in the common-emitter mode were studied.
Hydrogen-containing gases, instead of the base currents were
employed as input signals. Common-emitter characteristics
(ICH vs. VCE) show sensing current gains of 900 and 2890 in
1% H2/N2 at 25oC and 110oC. Besides, a low detection limit
of 100 ppm of the proposed sensor was also presented.
