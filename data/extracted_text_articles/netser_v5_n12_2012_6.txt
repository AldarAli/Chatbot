Abstract—This paper presents a detailed analysis on the Long 
Term Evolution performance in both downlink and uplink 
directions emphasizing the most important aspects that 
influence the performance indicators. Round Robin and 
Weighted Round Robin scheduling strategies, in time domain 
and time-frequency domain, are used in different scenarios 
concerning antenna configuration, number of users and types 
of services in order to evaluate cell throughput, average user 
throughput and cell capacity. The control channels bring some 
limitations in the number of users served and on the actual 
transmission bandwidth when time-frequency domain packet 
scheduling is implemented and all these are reflected in the 
simulation results. This paper offers an image of the LTE 
network performance in various scenarios, the most important 
aspect being the cell capacity evaluation with a certain 
minimum or expected service throughput.

INTRODUCTION
In the context of a continuous mobile traffic growth 
along with the high requirements of users and operators, 
3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) has standardized a 
new technology called Long Term Evolution (LTE) as the 
next step of the current 3G/HSPA (High Speed Packet 
Access) networks to meet the needs of future broadband 
cellular communications. It may be considered as a 
milestone towards 4G (Fourth Generation) standardization. 
The requirements set for LTE that are specified in [1] 
envisage high peak data rates, low latency, increased spectral 
efficiency, scalable bandwidth, optimized performance for 
mobile speed, etc. In order to fulfill this extensive range of 
requirements several key technologies have been considered 
for LTE radio interface of which the most important are: 
multiple-access through Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (OFDMA) in downlink and Single Carrier -
Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) in uplink 
and multiple-antenna technology. 
Packet Scheduling is one of LTE Radio Resource 
Management (RRM) functions, responsible for allocating 
resources to the users and, when making the scheduling 
decisions, it may take into account the channel quality 
information from the user terminals (UE), the QoS (Quality 
of service) requirements, the buffer status, the interference 
situation, etc. [2]. Like in HSPA or WiMAX, the scheduling 
algorithm used is not specified in the standard and it is 
eNodeB (Evolved NodeB) vendor specific. 
The LTE downlink has been previously analyzed in 
several papers like [3], [4], [5] and [6]. The authors 
evaluated the system and/or user throughput and the fairness 
of the scheduling algorithms used in their simulations, but 
the work was restricted either to SISO (Single Input Single 
Output) antenna technology, or the users experiencing the 
same radio conditions. Very few papers considered the 
PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) limitation in 
the number of users served and the terminal category impact. 
For LTE uplink there are fewer papers, some examples being 
[7], [8] and [9]. As for downlink, the control channels 
limitation is scarcely mentioned and evaluated and none of 
them analyzes the priority set for a specific type of users and 
its impact on cell capacity and throughput. 
In this paper, we evaluate the performance of packet 
scheduling in downlink and uplink LTE using the Round 
Robin and Weighted Round Robin strategies through the 
results obtained for the average cell throughput, the achieved 
user throughput and the system capacity. These results may 
be considered in the LTE network design, in order to 
approximate the number of users that can be served with a 
certain throughput in a commercial LTE network.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II discusses several aspects on scheduling and 
assigned resources in downlink LTE system followed by an 
insight on resource allocation in LTE uplink presented in 
Section III. Section IV describes the Round Robin and 
Weighted Round Robin scheduling models used in the 
simulations and Section V depicts the results of the 
simulated scenarios. The conclusions are driven in Section 
VI. 
II.
SEVERAL ASPECTS ON RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN 
LTE DOWNLINK
The LTE downlink is mainly characterized by OFDMA 
as multiple access scheme and MIMO (Multiple Input 
Multiple Output) technology. The benefit of deploying 
OFDMA technology on downlink LTE is the ability of 
allocating capacity on both time and frequency, allowing

multiple users to be scheduled at a time. The minimum 
resource that can be assigned to a user consists of two 
Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) and it is known as chunk 
or simply Resource Block (RB) [2],[10]. In downlink LTE 
one PRB is mapped on 12 subcarriers (180 kHz) and 7 
OFDM symbols (0.5 ms) and this is true for non-MBSFN 
(Multimedia Broadcast multicast service Single Frequency 
Network) LTE systems and for normal CP (Cyclic Prefix). 
Scheduling decisions can be made each TTI (Time 
Transmission Interval) that in LTE is equal to 1 ms.
For non-real time services dynamic scheduling is usually 
used as it provides flexible and even full utilization of the 
resource. This scheduler performs scheduling decisions 
every TTI by allocating RBs to the users, as well as 
transmission parameters including modulation and coding 
scheme. The latter is referred to as link adaptation. The 
allocated RBs and the selected modulation and coding 
scheme are signaled to the scheduled users on the PDCCH
(Physical Downlink Control Channel). The dynamic packet 
scheduler also interacts closely with the HARQ (Hybrid 
Automatic Repeat Request) manager as it is responsible for 
scheduling retransmissions and it may also take into account 
the QoS attributes and buffer information [6], [11].
The schedulers in the eNodeB may or may not take into 
consideration the channel information when making 
scheduling decisions. An alternative to channel-dependent 
scheduling is Round Robin strategy that serves the users in 
cyclic order, regardless the channel information.
Although OFDMA technology allows the users to be 
multiplexed in time and frequency, the scheduler, according 
to the implemented algorithm, may choose to allocate the 
entire bandwidth to a single user, reducing the scheduling to 
be done only in time domain. The channel-sensitive 
scheduling done in time domain only is called Non-
Frequency Selective Scheduling (NFSS) and the scheduling 
exploiting the channel variations in both time and frequency 
is known as Frequency Selective Scheduling (FSS) as 
specified in [12]. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of FSS for two 
users [6], [13].
When scheduling is done in time and frequency domain, 
independently if it is channel-aware or not, the number of
multiplexed users in each TTI is limited by the number of
Figure 1. Frequency selective scheduling illustration for two users in 
downlink LTE
PDCCHs that can be configured. This depends on the system 
bandwidth, the number of symbols signaled for PDCCH 
allocation, the PDCCH format number, etc. [10], [11], [14], 
[15].  
The PDCCHs are intended to provide both uplink and 
downlink scheduling information and in the assumption of 
half of the users making downlink transmissions, the 
maximum number of scheduled users per TTI in downlink 
LTE is half of the number of PDCCHs available. The authors 
from [11] discussed this constraint and proposed a three-step 
packet scheduling algorithm as it is depicted in Fig. 2 [11]. 
The highest number of PDCCHs is obtained with 
PDCCH format 0 (excellent radio conditions), but in real 
scenarios there will be a mix of PDCCH formats in order to 
realize link adaptation [11].
From all the multiple antenna techniques that can be used 
in downlink LTE the most performance improvements in
terms of cell/user throughput and cell capacity are reached 
with MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output). The baseline 
antenna configuration for MIMO and antenna diversity is 
two transmit antennas at the cell site and two antennas at the 
terminal. The higher-order downlink MIMO and antenna 
diversity (four TX and two or four RX antennas) is also 
supported. The basic MIMO schemes applicable to the 
downlink are illustrated in Fig. 3.
These schemes can be applied depending on the scenario 
(indoor, urban and rural coverage) and the UE capability.
The multi-antenna technology brings a new dimension 
on mobile radio – SPACE – and its implementation is based 
on three fundamental principles:

Diversity gain – Use of the space-diversity provided 
by the multiple antennas to improve the robustness 
of the transmission against multipath fading (Fig. 
3A).

Array gain – Concentration of energy in one or more 
given directions via precoding or beamforming. This 
also allows multiple users located in different 
directions to be served simultaneously (so-called 
multi-user MIMO) (Fig. 3B and Fig. 3D).

Spatial multiplexing gain – Transmission of multiple 
signal streams to a single user on multiple spatial 
layers created by combinations of the available 
antennas (Fig. 3C) [16].
III.
SEVERAL ASPECTS ON RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN 
LTE UPLINK
The high PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio) of the 
transmitted signal in OFDMA and the limited power of the 
mobile terminal determined 3GPP to choose a different 
scheme for LTE uplink 
Figure 3. MIMO schemes for LTE downlink
This multiple access technology is a variation of OFDMA, 
but with initial precoding stage using DFT (Discrete Fourier 
Transform), which results in each subcarrier carrying a linear 
combination of data symbols instead of each data symbol 
being mapped to a separate subcarrier.  This results in a 
single-carrier waveform that exhibits a significantly lower
PAPR than OFDMA, but keeps the multipath resistance and 
the inter-user orthogonality [11].
The smallest resource that can be assigned to a user also 
consists of two PRBs  adjacent in time and for simplicity of 
expression, in the rest of the paper we will use the term 
resource block (RB). In uplink LTE one PRB is mapped on 
12 subcarriers, each of 15 kHz, and 7 SC-FDMA symbols, 
with 0.5 ms time duration and this is true for non-MBSFN 
LTE systems and for normal CP [2], [10]. As well as in 
downlink, SC-FDMA allows multiple users to be scheduled 
at a time and the scheduling decisions can be made each TTI.
Unlike OFDMA, SC-FDMA constrains transmission to 
occur only on adjacent subcarriers in order to maintain its 
single carrier property. This means that RBs cannot be 
allocated freely and must be contiguous, limiting both 
frequency and multi-user diversity. 
LTE defines both localized and distributed scheduling in 
the downlink direction, but only localized scheduling in the 
uplink direction in order to keep the PAPR small in the SC-
FDMA symbols of each user. Fig. 4 compares the localized 
and the distributed scheduling [17].  
Figure 4. Localized vs. distributed scheduling in LTE
Taking into account that the PDCCH limitation applies 
also in LTE uplink, the scheduling framework from Fig. 2 
can be used in LTE uplink too. 
The LTE uplink is more impacted by the control 
information than the downlink. The actual transmission 
bandwidth in uplink is limited by the PUCCH (Physical 
Uplink Control Channel) regions and some typical expected 
number for different LTE bandwidths are presented in [16] 
and shown in Table I. PUCCH carries scheduling requests, 
ACK/NACK information related to downlink data packets, 
CQI (Channel Quality Information) etc. The number of 
PUCCH RBs per slot is the same as the number of PUCCH 
regions per sub-frame.  
IV.
ROUND ROBIN AND WEIGHTED ROUND ROBIN
SCHEDULING MODELS IN LTE
As mentioned in Section II, Round Robin (RR)
scheduling is a channel non-aware scheduling scheme that 
lets users take turns in using the shared resources (time 
and/or RBs), without taking the instantaneous channel 
conditions into account. Therefore, it offers great fairness 
among the users in radio resource assignment, but degrades 
the system throughput. Weighted Round Robin (WRR) is a 
variation of RR with priorities defined for different service 
categories. Time Domain (TD) RR and WRR, as well as 
Time and Frequency (FD) RR and WRR scheduling models 
are described in this Section.
A.
Time Domain Round Robin and Weighted Round Robin 
scheduling model
In TD RR the first reached user is served with the whole 
frequency spectrum for a specific time period (1 TTI), not 
making use of  the information on his channel quality. Then 
these resources are revoked back and assigned to the next 
user for another time period. The previously served user is 
placed at the end of the waiting queue so it can be served in 
the next round. This algorithm continues in the same manner
[18]. Fig. 5 illustrates the resource sharing between two users 
with TD RR algorithm. The colors and the line orientation 
make the difference between the users. In this example, 
every user is allocated 100% of the RBs and 50% of the time 
resource, so each gets 50% of the global resource [6]. The 
TD WRR differentiates from TD RR in the number and the 
type of users served.
Let us suppose a CBR (Constant Bit Rate) service of 500 
kbps and a SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) throughput per RB 
given by the radio conditions of 1 Mbps. Assuming there is 
one static user making the service and the same SNR is 
experienced in each RB and in all TTIs, the maximum 
amount of data that can be sent during 1 TTI per RB is 1 kb.

Figure 5. Resource sharing between two users with TD RR
Considering the system bandwidth of 20 MHz, which 
consists of 100 RBs, the user needs to be allocated all 
resources for five TTIs to reach his service throughput. 
Therefore the user must be allocated 1/200 of the total 
resource in order to be served.  This ratio is equal to service 
throughput / (SNR throughput * total number of RBs given 
by the system bandwidth). This represents the main idea in 
the TD RR model.
B.
Time and Frequency Domain Round Robin and 
Weighted Round Robin scheduling model
The FD RR allows multiple users to be scheduled within 
one TTI in cyclic order. Keeping in mind the PDCCH 
limitation discussed in Section II, the scheduling framework 
from Fig. 2 can be applied. The TDPS (Time Domain Packet 
Scheduling) may select N users in RR fashion to be 
scheduled in one TTI, but the PDCCH resources (M) must be 
checked in order to see if all users selected by the TDPS can 
be simultaneously scheduled. M users at most can be the 
input of FDPS (Frequency Domain Packet Scheduling), 
which schedules each user with RR strategy across different 
RBs. In the next TTI the users that were not selected in the 
previous one will be scheduled in the same manner and so on 
[6].
The FD RR is briefly presented in [19] where PDCCH 
constraint is not considered. The authors propose that all 
users be allocated one RB before reallocating to the same 
user. If the number of users waiting to be scheduled is less 
than the number of PDCCHs per TTI, this approach is 
correct, but only for LTE downlink (as in uplink the RBs 
must be adjacent). But if the number of users selected within 
one TTI is greater than the number of configurable PDCCHs 
and if the idea of allocating one RB to each user is 
maintained, the result will be a waste of resources [6].
The resource sharing between two users with FD RR, 
assuming a hypothetical system bandwidth of two RBs, is 
depicted in Fig. 6. As in Fig. 5, each user is allocated 50% 
of the global resource.
Figure 6. Resource sharing between two users with FD RR
Taking the example given in Section III.A, but 
considering the limitation of 20 PDCCHs per TTI for 
downlink LTE as it is concluded from [11], [14] and [15] 
and 40 users having the same radio conditions and making 
the same service, one user needs to be allocated 1 RB for 
500 TTIs [6]. The global resource in this case is reduced due 
to PDCCH constraint i.e. the maximum throughput given by 
the radio conditions * number of PDCCHs. The radio 
resource ratio assigned to each user is 1/40, higher than in 
TD RR example, so the capacity will be smaller.
A solution to address this problem would be the 
allocation of more RBs at once to each user in order to 
exploit all transmission bandwidth [6].
Knowing that for 20 MHz band in downlink LTE 20 
users can be simultaneously scheduled at most, each user 
can be allocated 5 RBs before assigning resources to another 
one. In this case, the FD RR cell throughput in LTE 
downlink will be the same as for TD RR, with the only 
advantage of being more suited to services with small 
packets and some delay requirements [6].
The FD RR cell throughput in LTE uplink will be less 
than that in TD RR due to the limitation in the actual
transmission bandwidth brought by PUCCH. 
As it was previously mentioned for TD WRR, the FD 
WRR has an impact on the number and types of users 
served, but the main principle is that from FD RR.  
V.
SIMULATION SCENARIOS AND RESULTS
A computer simulation using C++ platform is conducted 
to evaluate the performance of RR and WRR scheduling in 
downlink and uplink LTE, based on the mathematical 
modeling of these scheduling strategies, along with the basic 
network parameters.  For the simulations performed a single 
cell eNodeB is considered, with a carrier frequency of 2.6 
GHz FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) and a system 
bandwidth of  20 MHz. 
Besides SISO (Single Input Single Output) antenna 
configuration used in [6], in this paper we also consider 
MIMO 2x2 and we present several simulation results for 
LTE uplink using SIMO (Single Input Multiple Output) 
1x2.  Moreover, in several scenarios the users are uniformly 
distributed in the cell compared to the results presented in 
[6], which treated the case of all users experimenting the 
same radio conditions.
In the simulations considering SISO in LTE downlink 
category 1 terminals are used with ~10 Mbps, in those with 
SIMO 1x2 in LTE uplink it is assumed that all users have 
category 3 terminals with ~50 Mbps, while in those with 
MIMO 2x2 category 3 terminals with ~100 Mbps are 
chosen.
In order to reduce the complexity of the system 
simulations, we assume that equal downlink transmit power 
is allocated on each RB, all transmitted packets are received 
correctly and the users are static. For LTE uplink scenarios, 
we also assume that the UE transmit power can sustain the 
entire bandwidth allocation to a single user during 1 TTI. 
The downlink SNR values for SISO case used in this 
paper, resulting from pathloss, shadow fading, multipath 
fading, eNodeB transmit power and thermal noise, are listed

in Table II, along with the corresponding modulation and 
coding schemes and data rates.  The downlink SNR values 
for MIMO 2x2 are listed in Table III and those for SIMO 
1x2 for LTE uplink in Table IV.
The following sub-sections present the simulation results 
for cell throughput, average user throughput and system 
capacity in downlink and uplink LTE with RR and WRR
scheduling models. There are two categories of users 
considered: the first makes a CBR streaming service (e.g. 
video streaming) with a certain expected throughput (under 
this value the users cannot be served) and the second makes 
a VBR best effort service (e.g. data transfer using File 
Transfer Protocol) with a defined minimum accepted 
throughput, but it can reach more. The maximum best effort 
throughput reached is limited by the minimum between the 
data rate corresponding to the SNR experienced and the 
maximum throughput given by the user terminal category.   
For all simulation scenarios, the FD RR scheduling 
model considered is the one with 1 RB allocation to each 
user before reallocating another one to other user. The 
reason for this choice stands in emphasizing the PDCCH 
impact on simultaneously served users that also leads, in 
certain situations, in cell throughput limitation.

A.
Cell throughput results for LTE downlink with SISO
These results have been previously presented in [6].
A 2 Mbps expected throughput is chosen for streaming 
users and the same value is considered as the minimum 
throughput for best effort users. It is assumed that all users 
experience the same radio conditions.
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the cell throughput with TD RR 
and FD RR for streaming users and best effort users.
The dependence of the cell throughput on the SNR values 
with 30 users in the cell is depicted in Fig. 7. An interesting 
evolution is shown by the cell throughput in FD RR for 
streaming service, where the cell saturation is reached. The 
explanation lies in both PDCCHs limitation of 20 per TTI 
and the CBR service of 2 Mbps. Despite the PDCCH 
limitation in FD RR for best effort users, cell saturation is 
not reached due to their capability of achieving a higher 
throughput compared to their service throughput. All 30 
users are served only in TD RR for the last SNR throughput 
value.
Considering that the users experience only the last SNR 
value from Table II, the cell throughput is evaluated with the 
number of users in the cell trying to reach their service. 
When comparing TD RR with FD RR based on the results 
illustrated in Fig. 8 it can be concluded that for best effort 
users they show the same cell throughput evolution. Despite 
the PDDCH limitation, the best effort users may achieve a
higher throughput than the minimum defined one.

This is not the case for streaming users because in TD 
RR the cell throughput is higher due to a higher number of 
users served. From the cell throughput saturation it can also 
be seen that in TD RR there are 31 streaming users served, 
while in FD RR only 20 users reach their service 
requirements (the maximum 20 PDCCHs that can be 
configured within 1 TTI does not necessarily limits the 
number of served users in the cell to 20; for a lower expected 
throughput, the number of users served is more than 20 in 
FD RR with one 1 RB allocated to each user, as it will be 
presented in the scenarios concerning MIMO 2x2 in LTE 
downlink and SIMO 1x2 in LTE uplink).
B.
Average user throughput results for LTE downlink with 
SISO
Fig. 9 shows the evolution of average user throughput 
with the number of users in the cell (experiencing the same 
radio conditions as in Fig. 8). For streaming service the user 
throughput is constant at 2 Mbps, while for best effort users 
it varies until the cell saturation is reached, the saturation 
point being the maximum number of users served. The 
maximum best effort user throughput in the case of 1 and 5 
users in the cell is limited by the terminal category at 10 
Mbps. The achievable best effort user throughput is higher in 
FD RR than in TD RR for more than 20 users in the cell 
because there are fewer users served and the cell resource is 
shared between a smaller number users.
All the results presented so far were obtained considering 
separately streaming and best effort users, not mixed. The 
following Section presents the case with traffic mix and cell 
capacity evaluation.
C.
System capacity results for LTE downlink with SISO
Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show for both scheduling strategies 
how many users are served from the total number of users in 
the cell and the impact of the priority set for streaming 
service on the number and types of users scheduled. Half of 
the users in the cell are best effort users. The cell saturation 
is reached for 31 users served in TD RR and 20 in FD RR. 
When no priority is set (TD and FD RR), the number of 
served streaming users is equal to that of best effort users.

users served. The following sub-sections present simulation

obtained 
through 
simulations 
of 
various 
scenarios  
considering MIMO 2x2 antenna configuration and 2 Mbps as 
the expected throughput for streaming users and 500 kbps as 
the minimum  throughput for best effort users. Similar to 
SISO case, the cell throughput is evaluated for all SNR 
values from Table II  and for several numbers of users in the 
cell. The dependence of the cell throughput on the SNR 
values with 50 users in the cell is depicted in Fig. 12. As in 
SISO scenario, in FD RR for streaming service the 
maximum cell throughput is limited to a value that in this 
case is equal to 40 Mbps.
The explanation lies in both PDCCHs limitation of 20 per 
TTI and the CBR service of 2 Mbps. But there is a major 
difference between this figure and Fig. 7 regarding the cell 
throughput in FD RR for best effort users.

Figure 12. Cell throughput vs. SNR in LTE downlink with MIMO 2x2 for 
TD RR and FD RR
Because the best effort service requires a lower minimum 
throughput (500 kbps compared to 2 Mbps from previous 
scenario), there can be more than 20 users served in the cell 
for the last 5 SNR values. While in TD RR all 50 streaming 
and best effort users are served in the case where users 
experience the best radio conditions of those presented in 
Table II, in FD RR only 45 best effort users are assigned 
resources to get the required service. This emphasizes the 
poor performance of FD RR with 1 RB assigned and 
imposes the use of FD RR with more RBs assigned (e.g. 5 
RBs) that has the same results as TD RR, but is more suited 
for power limited scenarios, low traffic or services with 
certain latency requirements.
The cell throughput evolution with the number of users, 
considering all users in the best radio conditions, is depicted 
in Fig. 13. Compared to Fig. 8, cell throughput for TD RR 
and FD RR, in the case of best effort traffic only, does not 
show the same evolution. This is due to the fact that in this 
case FD RR strategy allows more than 20 users in the cell to 
be served (45), thus limiting to 20 the effective number of 
RBs to be assigned to users every TTI (as 20 MHz 
bandwidth has 100 RBs and the maximum number of 
PDCCHs per TTI is 20).

Figure 14. Cell throughput vs. the number of users in the cell in LTE 
downlink with MIMO 2x2 for TD RR and FD RR for users uniformly 
distributed in the cell
For streaming traffic only, the cell throughput with TD 
RR is higher than in FD RR due to a higher number of users 
served in the first case. In FD RR the maximum cell 
throughput is limited to 40 Mbps due to PDCCH, while in 
TD RR the cell throughput reaches 100 Mbps.
The cell throughput evolution with the number of users
when the users are uniformly distributed in the cell, thus 
experiencing different radio conditions, is illustrated in Fig. 
14. The number of PDCCHs in this case will be less than 20 
per TTI because it will be a mix of PDCCH formats (40% 
Format 0, 30 % Format 1, 20 % Format 2 and 10% Format 
3) [11], not only format 0, as considered so far. It results ~13 
PDCCHs per TTI for downlink. Comparing Fig. 14 with Fig. 
13, the maximum cell throughput value is the first difference 
to be noticed. As expected, in the scenario for Fig. 14, which 
is closer to a real one as different users experience different 
radio conditions, cell throughput barely exceeds 60 Mbps. 
And this is the case for best effort users that expect a lower 
throughput than the streaming users. In the latter case, the 
cell throughput reaches 46 Mbps, meaning 23 streaming 
users served. With FD RR, there are less than 20 users 
accepted that make streaming traffic or best effort traffic. 
More specifically, in this scenario, with FD RR only 13 
streaming users are served vs. 20 in the previous scenario 
and 13 best effort users vs. 45 are allowed to make the traffic 
required.
E.
Average user throughput results for LTE downlink with 
MIMO 2x2
The evolution of average user throughput with the 
number of users in the cell when users experience the best 
radio conditions is depicted in Fig. 15. For streaming 
service the user throughput is constant at 2 Mbps (as 
imposed by streaming service requirements), while for best 
effort users it varies, and cell saturation is reached for 45 
users with FD RR. Comparing TD RR with FD RR in the 
case of best effort traffic only, besides the fact that with

in the cell in LTE downlink with MIMO 2x2 for TD RR and FD RR for 
users experiencing the best radio conditions
TD RR all 50 best effort users are served, the best effort
user throughput for all 45 users is 2249 kbps with TD RR 
and 500 kbps with FD RR.
The average user throughput for both TD RR and FD RR 
with one type of users in the cell (streaming or best effort) 
when the users are uniformly distributed in the cell is
depicted in Fig. 5.16. A comparison between Fig. 16 and Fig. 
15 is necessary in order to outline the decrease in average 
user throughput when the users are uniformly distributed in 
the cell versus the case where all users were experiencing the 
best radio conditions. For 5 users in the cell it was obtained 
~11 Mbps vs. ~23 Mbps. Similar to the previous case, in FD 
RR the average user throughput is higher than the one with 
TD RR (less users served, the cell resources divided between 
fewer users).

When no priority is set (TD RR and FD RR), the number 
of served streaming users is equal to that of best effort users. 
For 100 users in the cell and priority set (WRR), in TD 
WRR there are 25 best effort users and all 50 streaming 
users served, while in FD WRR there is no best effort user 
served and 20 streaming users served. These results 
emphasize the waste of resources generated by FD RR 
strategy with only 1 RB allocated to each user.
G.
Cell throughput results for LTE uplink with SIMO 1x2
The following sub-sections present the simulation results 
for LTE uplink. For uplink performance evaluation, it was 
chosen a scenario with 1x2 SIMO, 20 MHz system 
bandwidth, with best effort and streaming users having 
category 3 terminals (~50 Mbps). For streaming service it is 
defined a constant throughput of 1 Mbps, while for best 
effort service a minimum throughput of 200 kbps. 
It has to be reminded the uplink control overhead 
mentioned in Section III and specified in Table I that limits 
the actual transmission bandwidth. Also, the single-carrier 
property of uplink transmission cannot be neglected and in 
order to assure adjacent RBs in FD RR in the scenarios with 
up to 20 users in the cell, the users are assigned from the 
start with a several number of RBs (instead of 1 to each user 
before reassigning to the first one).

The cell throughput evolution with SNR values is shown 
in Fig. 19. 50 users were considered in the cell trying to 
reach the service. As for the first two SNR values, only 20 
users best effort users can be served in FD RR, the cell 
throughput values are equal to those in TD RR (the cell 
resources are fully utilized). For the other SNR values, there 
can  be more best effort users served in FD RR, but due to 
the minimum throughput of 200 Kbps abd the PDDCH 
limitation, the transmission bandwidth is limited to 20 RBs 
(considering that the FD RR with 1 RB allocated to each 
user). The cell throughput for streaming service in FD RR is 
limited to 20 Mbps, also due to PDCCH constraint.
Fig. 20 illustrates the cell throughput evolution with the 
number of users in the cell in the best radio conditions 
scenario. As in Fig. 13, the FD RR cell throughput for best 
effort traffic drops when there are more than 20 users in the
cell due to the transmission bandwidth limitation to 20 RBs 
(given by the PDCCH constraint). As expected, the cell 
throughput with FD RR with streaming users is limited to 
20 Mbps (20 users served), while in TD RR 42 streaming 
users make the required service. The TD RR throughput is 
higher than the FD RR one when there are more than 20 
users in the cell. 
H.
Average user throughput results for LTE uplink with 
SIMO 1x2
Fig. 21 illustrates the average user throughput evolution 
with the number of the users in the cells, the simulation 
being made with the highest SNR value.
The streaming user throughput was expected to be 1 
Mbps, while an interesting evolution is seen in FD RR with 
best effort traffic: for less than 20 users in the cell, the cell 
resources are fully utilized and the users get a high 
throughput, while for more than 20 users the RBs that can 
be allocated are limited to 20 and in the case of 50 best 
effort users trying to reach their service, they are all served, 
but with 203 kbps. With TD RR strategy, all 50 best effort 
users are served, the minimum service throughput acquired 
being 851 kbps.

System capacity results for LTE uplink with SIMO 1x2
All the previous results for LTE uplink have been 
obtained considering, in turn, streaming and best effort users.
This Section presents the case with traffic mix and evaluates 
cell capacity with RR and WRR.
Fig. 22 and Fig. 23 show for RR and WRR scheduling 
algorithms, in TD and FD, how many users of a certain 
service category are served from the total number of users in 
the cell All users are assumed to be experiencing the highest 
SNR value from Table III. Half of the users in the cell are 
best effort users.
For TD RR and FD RR the number of served streaming 
users is equal to that of best effort users. For 80 users in the 
cell, in TD WRR all 40 streaming users are served, but only 
7 best effort users are accepted, while in FD RR all best 
effort users are rejected. In the case of equal priorities
between streaming nd best effort service (TDRR and FD 
RR) for 80 users in the cell, with TD RR there are 35
streaming and 35 best effort users served, and with FD RR 
10 users of each category are rejected.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper evaluates the performance of LTE downlink 
and uplink in what concerns cell throughput, average user 
throughput and cell capacity using two scheduling models in 
various 
scenarios 
of 
antenna 
configurations, 
radio 
conditions, number of users and service categories. The 
constraint of PDCCHs on the number of users scheduled 
each TTI, both for LTE downlink and uplink, has also been 
outlined and depicted in the simulation results, making FD 
RR with 1 RB assigned to each user less efficient when the 
number of users in the cell is higher than the PDCCHs. It 
was also discussed the limitation in the actual number of 
RBs in the transmission bandwidth brought by the uplink 
control channels. Taking into account that the mobile 
terminal is power limited and may not be able to support the 
assignment of the entire system bandwidth, the FD RR with 
more than 1 RB per user per TTI is more suited. 
Despite its limitations, these scheduling models can offer 
an image of the LTE network performance and may be a 
useful tool to design an optimized LTE network, the most 
important aspect being the cell capacity evaluation with 
certain minimum or expected service throughput. Certain 
scenarios presented in this paper have been replicated in
other simulation environments and the results obtained were 
similar to those presented in Section V.
Future work will focus on the analysis of LTE network 
performance using Opnet simulator as it offers some 
performance indicators evolution in time, latency results and 
more complex traffic mix scenarios.
