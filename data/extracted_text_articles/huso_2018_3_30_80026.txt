Abstract—User
reviews
provide
a
rich
source
of
information
regarding
user
interests.
Many
Web
platforms allow or even encourage their visitors to leave
their feedback regarding the products and services they
have consumed. The Term Frequency (TF) and the
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) are two factors that
have
been
used
extensively
in
capturing
users’
preferences. This paper collects users’ reviews from e-
tourism Web platforms, calculates the TF and the IDF
for each user and adopts a multi-criteria approach in
order to quantify users’ preferences and dynamically
adapt the websites design accordingly. It utilizes the
Analytic
Hierarchy
Process
(AHP)
and
similarity
methods in order to determine the relative importance of
terms and Web pages and then rearranges them in a
new website structure.

INTRODUCTION
According to the Internet Web statistics, there are
approximately 7,634,758,428 Web users around the globe
[1]. Data also shows that more than 1.5 billion websites
exist today, with more 200 million being active [2]. A great
number of Web users often leave their feedback in the form
of users’ reviews, thus developing a very rich source of
information regarding services and products, customers’
needs and suppliers’ quality. Thus, a huge amount of
information becomes available to users for almost every
single topic. Although this is a very promising development,
at the same time searching through this vast ocean of data in
order to identify the required information is quite of an
endeavour. Within the context of Web personalisation,
context
personalisation
aims
at
providing
the
right
information
to
the
right
user,
while
presentation
personalisation focuses on presenting the content with the
most suitable media combination taking into account users’
factors such as media limitations, users’ media preferences,
etc [3]. With respect to presentation personalisation, [3]
suggest 5 groups of factors to be taken into consideration:
User-specific
features
pertain
to
users’
media
preferences. For example, a user would rather choose a
graphical to text presentation. Information features refer to
representational differences and capabilities of media since
not all media are equally suitable for projecting the same
piece of information. Contextual information refers to user
environmental conditions, such as noise, light, weather,
speed, etc. that may affect the presentation quality to the
user. Media constraints imply the need to effectively
combine the characteristics and capabilities of different
media in order to improve the quality of presentation.
Limitations
of
technical
resources
relate
to
device
limitations such as screen size, bandwidth, etc. With respect
to content personalisation, the analysis of User Generated
Content (UGC) provides Web developers as well as service
and product designers with valuable information regarding
users’ preferences as well as suppliers quality and potential
[4]. The Term Frequency (TF) and the Inverse Document
Frequency (IDF) are used extensively in capturing user
preferences [5]. Several representational methodologies
have been proposed for developing user profiles. Most
frequently though are the three different formats namely:
keywords,
semantic
networks
and
concept-based
representations [5][6]. Keywords represent domains of
users’ preferences. They are associated with weights that
indicate the strength of user interests for a particular topic.
Polysemy and Synonymy are problems associated with
keywords. Semantic networks, address these problems, by
representing keywords with nodes on graphs that are
connected
with
each
other,
including
co-occurrences.
Concept-based representations resemble semantic networks
in structure but they differ in having nodes to represent
abstract topics rather than keywords [5][6]. Filtering and
clustering techniques are very useful in reducing the number
of concepts that are found on the Web when attempting to
formulate user profiles. However, [6] argues that these
techniques lack effectiveness for they produce the same
structure of user preferences for users with different needs,
thus
failing
to
produce
highly
refine,
accurate
and
personalised representations of individual users. Research
shows that while many approaches have been used in order
to
produce
and
use
user
profiles,
e.g.
in
Web

personalisation, recommender systems, etc., there exists no
definite procedure for deriving user interests [6][7]. The
AHP have been used in documents ranking [8]. However,
the use of multi-criteria methods in analysing the TF-IDF is
overlooked. This paper addresses the need for investigating
alternative ways of developing user preferences models and
suggests the analysis of the TF-IDF with the use of AHP.
Thus, this research aims to propose a multi-criteria
approach based on the AHP and the TF-IDF for adapting
websites design according to users’ preferences relative
importance. The relative importance of users’ interests has
not been considered in the literature. When it comes to
personalisation though, it is the relative importance of terms
for each individual user that would rank and distinguish
users’ interests and subsequently decide how to structure
websites. Web adaptation is a decision making process
where users would pairwise compare terms and decide
which ones they mostly prefer to know about. Their choices
influence the Web design, which needs to adapt to users’
preferences. The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
Section II presents the proposed methodology and the
methods used for data analysis. In Section III, the paper
discusses the empirical study and the data analysis. Finally,
the paper presents its conclusions in Section IV.
II.
METHODOLOGY AND METHODS
This paper aims to dynamically rearrange the structure
of websites, according to user interests. By capturing and
modelling user preferences, this paper proposes an approach
to reallocate Web pages based on their importance. Web
pages’ importance is calculated based on user priorities.
Data is collected from platforms such as TripAdvisor.com
and Booking.com. User reviews, regarding users’ stay in
Greece and Italy hotels, were collected by using the Scrapy
Web crawler tool. The reviews were then analysed by
utilizing the Knime text mining tool. Next, the importance
of each term was calculated and analysed by utilizing the
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) multicriteria analysis
method. In recent years, many researchers adopted Multi-
Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches to problem
solving such assessing alternative solutions, to selection
problems, strategic analysis [9] etc. The steps of the
proposed methodology adopted follow.
A.
Methodology for evaluating business strategy
based on Web analytics.
Step 1: Collect documents published by users.
A total of 5453 reviews were collected, from hotels
ranging from 3 to 5 stars. The data size is more than
sufficient for calculating user preferences with AHP.
Reviews were analysed in order to calculate the Term
Frequency (TF) and the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
factors.
Step 2: Calculate the importance

Each row of the UIM matrix represents the preferences
of the user associated with the corresponding. The UIM will
later be used to calculate the interests’ similarities among
users and recommend users items to see.
Step 3: Evaluate the relative importance of each Web
page for every user using AHP.
Each Web page is assessed in terms of the importance of
the terms it contains. Drawing on each user’s UIV, the AHP
pairwise comparison matrix is calculated. The pairwise
comparison matrix that shows terms’ perceived importance
for each user takes the following form.

In order to proceed with the AHP, assume the following
hierarchy:
Figure 1: The AHP hierarchy for the evaluation of Web pages relative
importance
The terms relative importance for each user reflects Web
pages importance for each user, since a Web page is a
collection of terms. Thus, the AHP analysis returns the
relative importance of each term; therefore, the relative
weight of each Web page for each user. A Web page is
modelled as a vector which elements are the relative
importance
rw(t)
of each term as resulted from the AHP,
weighted by the normalised frequency (
ptwp tk
,
) that term
kt appears on the corresponding Web page (
p
wp
1,...
).
Time related factors can also be used in measuring Web
pages importance. Thus, drawing on the AHP theory, the
importance of every Web page is represented by the User
Page Vector (UPV) as follows:

values are re-grouped in website layers.
Step 6: Rearrange Web pages into website layers (L).
The total number of Web pages (P) in a website is
calculated by using the following formula:
tpp
P  T
,
(4)
where P, is the total number of Web pages in a website;
T indicates the total number of terms identified and tpp, is
the number of terms allowed per page. The resulting number
P is round up to the next integer if needed.
Next, assume the allowed number of Web Pages per
Layer (WPL) in the website and calculate the number of
required website layers (L), by using the following formula:
wpl
P
L 
,
(5)
where L is the total number of layers in a website; P, is
the total number of Web pages in a website and wpl is the
allowed number of Web pages per layer. The resulting
number L is round up to the next integer if needed.
Web pages of similar importance are grouped together
into
the
layers.

B.
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Method.
The AHP method was developed by [10]–[13]. It
considers a hierarchy of criteria and possibly sub-criteria
that contribute towards the realisation of the goal. The AHP
calculates the relative weight of each criterion, i.e. the
importance of each criterion with respect to the goal. Upon
the criteria hierarchy and their relative importance, the AHP
evaluates and ranks a set of alternatives. The AHP and its
fuzzy extension [14] have been extensively used in multi-
criteria decision making problems [15], such as in selection
[16]–[18], strategic management [19], in determining the
critical factors of success for information service industry
[14], etc. The steps of the AHP are discussed below:
AHP Step 1: Assume a set of criteria which are
evaluated in a pairwise manner using a nine point scale [13].
The criteria are represented by the comparison matrix A.

where w represents the eigenvector of the matrix A
comparison matrix, and
max
is the largest eigenvalue of
the matrix A.
AHP Step 3: Calculate the consistency rate.
The consistency of the matrix and subsequently the
consistency of the weights is calculated by examining the
reliability of judgments in the pairwise comparison. The
Consistency Index (CI) and the Consistency Ratio (CR) are
defined by using the following formulas:

Next, assume a subset of the terms’ frequencies, as
shown in Table 4, for each web page. This data is collected
by counting the number each term appears on each Web
page. For example, the term “furnish” appears 3 times in
Web page-1, 5 times in Web page-2, etc.

Drawing on the importance and similarities degrees
shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively, Web pages are
grouped into layers. Assuming that the allowed number of
terms per page (tpp=2) and total number of terms (T=13),
then the maximum number of Web pages is 13/2=6.5 round
up to 7, by applying formula (4). By applying formula (5),
assuming wpl=2 pages per layer, the maximum number of
layers is 7/2, which rounded returns maximum 4 layers in

the website. Results show that Web page-1 is the most
important followed by Web page-2 and Web page-5.
However, Web page-5 is the least important of the three,
thus it is arranged in a hierarchical level below in the
website, since the maximum number of pages per layer
(wpl) is set at two (2). Web page-3 is grouped with Web
page-2 since the two are more similar than with the other
pages. Thus, Web page-3 is linked to Web page-2 but in a
layer below, due to (wpl) limitation. Similarly, Web page-4
is linked with Web page-1 but following in a layer below.
Thus, the resulting website structure is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: The resulting Web structure
In the same way, similarities among terms are calculated
so that terms are re-arranged accordingly, i.e. to be removed
from one page and linked with another. By calculating the
similarities between terms and among Web pages, terms can
be grouped dynamically and re-grouped so that the content
of Web pages changes, thus manipulating the page’s
importance in a flexible way and produce alternative
websites’ designs.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
UGC provides a rich source of information regarding
user preferences. Content personalisation and presentation
personalisation rely on understanding and modelling users’
interests. This paper suggests that the use of multi-criteria
approaches can be used in conjunction with similarity
methods to analyse text indices such as the TF-IDF, etc. The
proposed approach utilises the AHP in order to calculate the
relative importance of terms and subsequently of the
associated
Web
pages.
Upon
their
importance
and
similarities terms and Web pages can be re-arranged, thus
producing Web structures that dynamically adapt to user
preferences following. As soon as user interests’ change and
these changes can be traced in UGC, the proposed approach
recalculates importance and similarity degrees and adapts
the Web design. Future research can focus on calculating
similarities of users and adopting recommender systems
technologies and methods in the Web design domain.
