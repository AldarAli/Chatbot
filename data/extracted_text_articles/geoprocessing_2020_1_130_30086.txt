Abstract—This work proposes a workﬂow for the publication
of Open Spatial Data. The main contribution of this work
is the automatic generation of metadata extracted from Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) spatial services providing access
to feature types and coverages. Besides, this work adopts a
geospatial extension of the Data Catalog Vocabulary metadata
application proﬁle for data portals in Europe for the description
of datasets. This extension, called GeoDCAT-AP, has been adopted
because it allows for an appropriate crosswalk between the
annotation requirements in the spatial domain and the metadata
models accepted in general Open Data portals. The feasibility of
the proposed workﬂow has been tested within the framework of
the TRAFAIR project to publish monitoring and forecasting air
quality data.

INTRODUCTION
TRAFAIR (Understanding trafﬁc ﬂows to improve air
quality) is a European project co-ﬁnanced by the Connecting
Europe Facility of the European Union (Project Nr. 2017-EU-
IA-0167), whose main objectives are the monitoring of air
quality in urban areas, and the development of forecasting
air quality services based on meteorological predictions and
urban trafﬁc ﬂows [1], [2]. The project also aims to publish
monitoring and forecasting air quality data as Open Data and
to develop client applications to make both citizens and public
administrations aware of the air quality and the responsible
use of private transport.
To facilitate the visualization and download of monitoring
and forecasting data, project partners have chosen the use of
GeoServer software, which facilitates the setting up of servers
accessible through the standardized service interfaces compli-
ant with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) speciﬁcations:
Web Mapping Services (WMS) for visualization, Web Feature
Services (WFS) for the download of feature data, and Web
Coverage Services (WCS) for the download of coverage data.
Figure 1 shows a layered architecture with the data and service
components managed in the TRAFAIR project.
However, the simple publication of OGC services cannot
be considered as Open Data publication. To make data really
accessible as Open Data, we need to register datasets in ofﬁcial
Open Data portals. Furthermore, the publication of datasets in
the European Data Portal (EDP) [3] is a requirement of the
project. To register as Open Data the TRAFAIR outcomes, the
ﬁrst step has been to select an appropriate metadata proﬁle
compliant with the metadata models accepted in the Open
Data context. Taking into account the spatial character of data
managed in TRAFAIR, we have adopted the GeoDCAT-AP
metadata proﬁle [4]. GeoDCAT-AP is a metadata proﬁle that
extends DCAT-AP, a metadata proﬁle designed by the Euro-
pean Commission to describe public sector data. GeoDCAT-AP
metadata properties have been designed to assure compliance
with the metadata requirements of the European INSPIRE
directive for establishing a spatial information infrastructure
in Europe [5].
On the other hand, to minimize the effort of creating
metadata and the registration of these data in Open Data
portals, we decided to automate this process employing a
software that retrieves the capabilities of OGC services and
converts this information into metadata records that are later
ingested in a CKAN-like Open Data server. CKAN [6] is the
most widely used Open source platform to support Open Data
portals, which includes the necessary plug-ins to exchange
metadata in RDF format (the serialization format used for
GeoDCAT-AP).
The objective of this work is to describe the workﬂow that
we have proposed for the publication of Open Spatial Data in-
tegrating the automatic generation of GeoDCAT-AP metadata.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section
II introduces background information on the GeoDCAT-AP
metadata model. Section III describes our proposed workﬂow
for the publication of Open Spatial Data. Section IV describes
the feasibility of the application of the proposed workﬂow in
the cities of Modena, Santiago de Compostela, and Zaragoza.
Section V reviews related works in the literature. Last, this
paper ends with some conclusions and an outline of future
work.

GEODCAT-AP: A METADATA PROFILE FOR OPEN
SPATIAL DATA
ISO 19115 is the international standard for geographic
metadata proposed by the International Organisation for Stan-
dardization (ISO) [7], which has been widely adopted during
the last decade in the geographic information community in
both public and private sectors.
However, in the Open Data domain, more general and sim-
ple metadata schemas are needed to facilitate the publication
of datasets from different disciplines in the same metadata

repository. DCAT is the acronym for W3C’s Data Catalogue
vocabulary) [8] and can be considered as a basic and general
core of metadata properties shared by the different metadata
schemas used in various Open Data initiatives. In the case of
Europe, the European Union proposed in 2013 DCAT-AP [9],
a speciﬁcation based on DCAT for describing public sector
datasets in Europe. Compared to DCAT, DCAT-AP provides
stricter deﬁnitions of catalogs, datasets, distributions, and other
objects.
As mentioned in the introduction, within the context of
this project, we have selected GeoDCAT-AP v1.01 [4]. This
extension of DCAT-AP [9] was designed for the description
of spatial data and its metadata properties have an exact
mapping with the main elements of ISO 19115 metadata. This
mapping assures the transformation of GeoDCAT-AP records
into equivalent ISO 19115 metadata records compliant with
INSPIRE requirements [10].

Figure 2. Entities and properties used from GeoDCAT-AP
The description of datasets according to GeoDCAT-AP is
mainly focused on providing information about three main
entities: a Catalog that is published through an Open Data por-
tal containing Datasets and the associated Distribution forms
of each dataset. Besides, GeoDCAT-AP makes a distinction
between core and extended properties. The core set is the
selection of DCAT-AP metadata properties that have a direct
binding with ISO 19115 and INSPIRE metadata. The extended
set is a superset of the core set, including additional metadata
properties to provide a complete binding with ISO 19115 and
INSPIRE metadata. In some cases, these additional properties
belong to other metadata vocabularies. In other cases, although
the properties belong to DCAT-AP, they are classiﬁed as
extended because they only provide a partial binding with ISO
19115 and INSPIRE.
Figure 2 shows a UML diagram with the properties from
GeoDCAT-AP that are needed for describing datasets and
distributions in TRAFAIR. Most of these properties belong
to the core set of GeoDCAT-AP. The only exceptions are
the dct:type property of Datasets and the dct:description
property of Distributions. dct:type is employed to indicate
whether the described resource is a dataset or a dataset series.
dct:description allows the description of the spatial resolution
of associated distributions. Although GeoDCAT-AP proposes
rdfs:comment as a provisional property to ﬁll this resolution
information, there is no direct mapping of this property to
CKAN ﬁelds and we have considered dct:description as a valid
alternative.

PROPOSED WORKFLOW FOR THE PUBLICATION OF
OPEN SPATIAL DATA
Figure 3 shows an activity diagram with the main ﬁve steps
of the workﬂow that we have proposed for the publication of
Open Spatial Data. For steps 1, 3, and 4, we have developed
software to automate as much as possible the automatic gener-
ation and release of metadata. Steps 2 and 5 are accomplished
thanks to the use of existing software packages.
The ﬁrst step is the ingestion of layers in a spatial data
warehouse. GeoServer is the software package selected for
managing the publication of spatial data layers, either discrete
feature data or coverage data. In the context of this project,
we have developed speciﬁc software in Java and R languages
to ingest feature types (supported in a spatial database) and

coverages in GeoServer through its REST API [11], [12].
Concerning metadata generation, this software takes care of
sending to the REST API the appropriate values for the tags
enumerated in the GeoServer column of Table I.
The second step is the publication of layers as OGC
services. This step is directly achieved thanks to the GeoServer
software, which provides access to layers through different
OGC services. Feature types, such as observations retrieved
from trafﬁc and air quality sensors, may be downloaded
through a WFS service. In the case of coverages for air
quality monitoring (interpolations of geo-referenced sensor
observations) or coverages for predicting quality (the result of
applying a Lagrangian model for the dispersion of pollutants
called GRAL [13]), a WCS service is used to retrieve these
raster data. Beyond WFS and WCS, some layers are also
available to perform server-side map rendering using a WMS
service.
The third step is the harvesting of metadata from OGC ser-
vices through its GetCapabilities operation. To implement this
step, we have developed a Python program that takes proﬁt of
OWSLib [14], a Python package for client programming with
OGC web service interface standards and their related content
models. This software interacts with the OGC interface, instead
of the GeoServer REST API, because we wanted to make this
software scalable enough to integrate in the future other layers
managed by software packages different from GeoServer. The
algorithm behind this software generates a Dataset instance for
every layer published in WFS or WCS services. In addition,
each Dataset has at least one associated Distribution instance
in the form of a link to a WFS or WCS service. In some
cases, if the layer is also rendered through a WMS, a second
distribution linking to the WMS service is generated. The
OWSLib column in Table I shows the ﬁelds retrieved with
OWSLib package to generate the corresponding GeoDCAT-
AP property.
The fourth step is the ingestion of metadata in the Open
Data server of the institution in charge of publishing the
air quality data of the local area. As a continuation of the
software in the previous step, our Python program transforms
the information retrieved in the previous step into a dictionary
with the required items to construct a dataset and its associated
resources, which are immediately inserted in the CKAN-based
local Open Data server through its REST API [15]. The CKAN
column in Table I indicates the tags that are used in this
dictionary data structure to generate later RDF metadata based
on GeoDCAT-AP. The mapping between CKAN ﬁelds and
RDF properties is the one proposed in the ckanext-dcat plugin
of CKAN [16].
The ﬁnal step is the harvesting of metadata in the local
servers by regional and national Open Data portals until
the EDP ﬁnally harvests metadata. This step is beyond the
scope of the TRAFAIR project. However, we assume that
upper-level portals are based on CKAN technology (or have
a similar mechanism for the harvesting of subscribed lower
level catalogs). On the one hand, the ckanext-dcat plugin of
CKAN allows the publication of datasets metadata as RDF in
compliance with DCAT-AP vocabularies. On the other hand,
the ckanext-harvest plugin of CKAN allows us to harvest the
contents of different types of catalog sources.
Last, it must be noted that the steps of the workﬂow can
be either executed automatically in a row, or they can be
interleaved with manual supervision to revise the information
associated to layers in GeoServer (before applying steps 3 and
4) or the metadata in local CKAN servers (before harvesting
takes place in step 5). Besides, the workﬂow can be applied
incrementally to take into account new layers created in
GeoServer, or to update CKAN metadata if the conﬁguration
of layers in GeoServer has changed.

DEPLOYMENT OF OPEN DATA IN THE CITIES OF
MODENA, SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA AND ZARAGOZA
Figure 4 shows the deployment of speciﬁc Open Data
portals in the cities of Modena (Italy), Santiago de Compostela
(Spain) and Zaragoza (Spain). The ﬁgure also shows how the
local GeoServers are queried with the software described in
steps 3 and 4 of the proposed workﬂow to feed the contents
of the local Open Data portals. In addition, the ﬁgure shows
the Open Data portals at regional, national, and European level
that harvest the contents of the local Open Data portals.
In the case of Modena, the Open Data contents managed
by the municipal government of Modena (Comune di Modena)
are directly ingested in the CKAN-based Open Data server
provided by the regional government of Emilia-Romagna [17].
The contents of this portal are harvested by the Italian Gov-
ernment Open Data portal (dati.gov.it).
In the case of Santiago de Compostela, the Open Data
portal is managed by the municipal government of Santiago de
Compostela (Concello de Santiago) [18]. Later, the contents
of this portal are harvested by the Spanish Government Open
Data portal (datos.gob.es).
The case of Zaragoza is more complicated. There is
an Open Data portal based on CKAN maintained by the
researchers of the University of Zaragoza involved in the
TRAFAIR project. However, the Open Data contents of the
University are published through a different kind of repository
(called Zaguan) based on MARC metadata and accessible
through the OAI-PMH protocol. In this case, we had to develop
a speciﬁc program to upload the GeoDCAT-AP metadata
periodically in MARC format at Zaguan portal (see ﬁgure

regional government of Aragon, and later by the Spanish
Government Open Data portal.
All datasets provided by different TRAFAIR partners on
local portals will also appear at EDP [3]. The EDP will act as
a common collector of all data related to air quality and trafﬁc
that will be generated and published within the different cities
and will also encourage the reuse of the TRAFAIR outcomes.

RELATED WORK
There are several examples of works trying to crawl the
contents of OGC services and automate the generation of meta-
data items that are later ingested in catalogs compliant with
the OGC Catalog Services for the Web (CSW) speciﬁcation.
For instance, Nogueras-Iso et al. [20] proposed a mechanism
to derive metadata from the capabilities information returned
by OGC services (e.g., WMS, WFS or WCS) and create
entries in a catalog of geographic information services. A
related solution is the CSW - ISO 19115 community module
of GeoServer software [21]. This GeoServer extension allows
the browsing of GeoServer layers through a CSW API, but
no details are provided about the OGC services providing
access to the layers. This extension is also comparable to
the harvesting possibility offered by Geonetwork (a software
for deploying geographic metadata catalogs) to use the Get-
Capabilities response of an OGC service (e.g., WMS, WFS
or WCS) to generate ISO 19115 metadata for the resources
delivered by the service [22]. Another example studying in
more detail the layers advertised in a GetCapabilities response
is the one proposed by Florczyk et al. [23]. This work describes
a method for the automatic detection of the orthoimage layers
discovered in the GetCapabilities responses of Web Map
Services, which was used to feed the contents of a virtual
catalog of orthoimages.
Concerning the synchronized publication of data and meta-
data, there are also examples of works trying to deﬁne work-
ﬂows for the joint publication of datasets and metadata. For
instance, Gil-Altaba et al. [24] proposed a service framework
that used the GeoServer REST API to create a new data
store accessible through OGC services, and immediately ingest
the associated metadata to this datastore into a CSW catalog
supported with Geonetwork software.
The previous works are focused on generating ISO 19115
- compliant metadata. However, for publication of geographic
information as Open Data, solutions generating DCAT-based
metadata are required. Perego et al. [25] describe uses cases
for proﬁle-based content negotiation and publishing metadata
on the web where a GeoDCAT-AP API has been developed to
transform original content according to ISO 19115 metadata
standard into DCAT-AP metadata in various formats. A similar
approach is provided through the ckanext-spatial plugin of
CKAN [26]. This plugin allows harvesting the ISO 19115
contents of CSW catalogs. Nevertheless, none of these two
approaches derive metadata automatically from services.
The workﬂow for the publication of open data proposed
in this work contributes to the state of the art as it provides

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have proposed the workﬂow for the publication of Open
Spatial Data that can be customized to other projects dealing
with spatial data that must be publicly accessible. Besides,
we have demonstrated how GeoDCAT-AP metadata can be
applied in a real use case to describe more speciﬁcally spatial
data than other more general metadata vocabularies based on
DCAT. The TRAFAIR project proposes a light adoption of
GeoDCAT-AP that is feasible with minimum resources: all
the proposed metadata elements are also included as part of
the metadata elements included in DCAT-AP, and all these
metadata elements can be edited through CKAN servers (either
manually or through the CKAN API).
However, we must admit that not all GeoDCAT-AP guide-
lines to ﬁll metadata elements could be followed by local
Open Data portals because they must comply with constrained
proﬁles of DCAT-AP imposed by national governments, which
are beyond the control of project members. For instance,
TRAFAIR proposes the use of INSPIRE data themes (i.e.
“atmosphere” and ”environment facilities”) as values for
dcat:theme because GeoDCAT-AP aims to be compliant with
INSPIRE metadata rules, but unfortunately, the rules of our
local portals force us to select a theme from a very limited con-
trolled vocabulary established by the corresponding national
government. A similar case occurs with metadata elements
like dct:provenance, which is included both in DCAT-AP and
GeoDCAT-AP but not in the Spanish subset of DCAT-AP [27].
As future work, we plan to integrate the software that we
have developed for the automatic generation and publication
of metadata as a new plugin of CKAN, or as an extension of
existing ckanext-spatial plugin. Another work in progress is
the evaluation of the quality of metadata according to several
approaches like the Metadata Quality Assurance methodology
[28] or the ISO 19157-based method for metadata quality
analysis [29].
