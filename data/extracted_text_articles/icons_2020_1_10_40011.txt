Abstract—The human is a complex machine and the health 
care system is the mechanic hired to maintain and repair both 
the hardware and software. External forces are constantly 
pushing out ``software-updates'', ``bugs'' and ``viruses'' 
affecting the human being in different ways. Finding the best 
way to treat a patient is challenging without knowing the 
patients background story. That story is formed from the 
moment the patient is born and is pushed in different 
directions by various sources. Family, friends, teachers, 
strangers, media, and for the last 15 years or so, social media, 
are all contributors to shaping the mind of a young individual. 
This paper looks closer at the physiological and psychological 
causes and effects of diagnosing pregnant women with 
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), and the authors reflect 
and discuss how the Norwegian health care system can treat 
the condition in a way that supports individuality and 
complexity. Diseases that are correlated with certain lifestyles 
are frequently mentioned in media, often as warnings or 
motivation for a healthy lifestyle. However, the reasons for 
getting these diseases are more complex than usually 
presented. The entire fault is put on the individual's ability to 
live healthy, which is an unfair burden that may again result in 
low self-esteem and poor lifestyle choices. Systems thinking 
tools such as the conceptagon and systemigram are utilized in 
an attempt to capture the complexity of the problem and the 
system most suitable for solving it.

 INTRODUCTION 
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a diagnosis seen 
in between 6-11% of pregnant Norwegian women [1]. 
Hormones due to the pregnancy causes the insulin to have 
lower effect and if the body is not able to compensate for 
this, the blood sugar levels may rise above a defined limit. 
The reason why the body is not able to compensate for the 
increased need for insulin is not well documented, but factors 
such as genetics, lifestyle, obesity, age, ethnicity and 
environment are often mentioned [2], [3]. The combination 
of these factors determines the risk of developing this 
condition. Most of the literature focus on the technical causes 
and effects of being diagnosed with GDM [4]–[6], while the 
psychological effects are not considered to the same degree. 
It is reasonable to assume that receiving such a diagnose will 
have some effect on the wellbeing of the patient, in addition 
to the frequent need for blood sugar monitoring and potential 
medication. In today’s society, a person diagnosed with any 
kind of diabetes will automatically be exposed to some 
degree of stigma. The word diabetes is often correlated with 
laziness, low self-discipline and unhealthy eating. Many 
people will choose not to share the diagnosis with their 
surroundings, which may influence how well they are able to 
manage the condition. When a pregnant woman is diagnosed 
with GDM without receiving sufficient information from the 
doctor she will probably try to acquire the information 
herself. The Internet is overflowing with relevant, irrelevant, 
correct and incorrect information, which can be challenging 
to filter, and the patient may end up being stressed and 
worried. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the 
complexity of the GDM diagnosis. By using systems 
thinking tools, the authors can look at the current gestational 
diabetes research from a new perspective. The Norwegian 
health care system is treated as the System of Interest (SoI), 
while the patient is seen as a stakeholder. The authors have 
used system engineering tools, such as the conceptagon and 
systemigram to create the models that are presented in 
section II. A research study of causes and effects of being 
diagnosed with GDM has been performed by the authors in 
section III before adding own reflections in section IV, and 
conclusion and further work in section V. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In order to analyze, synthesize and inquire the system of 
interest, a framework called conceptagon is utilized and 
described in the next subsections. A systemigram is 
developed and presented to identify the relationships and 
activities between the SoI and its stakeholders. Both the 
conceptagon and systemigram are included in the systems 
engineering toolkit and are helpful when striving to achieve a 
holistic view of a problem or system, according to the 
methodology done in other domains [7]–[10]. 
A. Conceptagon 
The conceptagon [11] is a framework for applied systems 
thinking. Its purpose is to present different concepts in a 
common language that system experts with different 
backgrounds can understand. The conceptagon, consisting of 
the SoI in the center and seven triples distributed around it, is 
shown in Figure 1. The triples each include three concepts 
1

ICONS 2020 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Systems

that are known as fundamental terms in several disciplines. 
During the next paragraphs, the authors describe the SoI 
through each of the concepts shown in the conceptagon. 
 
 
Figure 1 Conceptagon [11] 
 
 
 
Figure 2 Boundaries 
 
1) Boundary: The boundaries are defined by identifying 
the interior and the exterior of the SoI and are crucial for 
understanding what the SoI consists of. The interior 
includes factors that the SoI have control over and that is 
relevant to the problem presented in this paper, while the 
exterior identifies factors that must be taken into account. 
The SoI may be able to impact the external factors, but does 
not have control over them. Figure 2 presents the interior 
and exterior of the SoI. The Norwegian health care system is 
split into several divisions with different functions. The 
doctor’s office is where the patient have their check ups and 
regular visits; the health clinic gives support to women 
during their pregnancy and follow up kids with check ups 
and vaccines; the hospitals treats serious and acute illness; 
and the polyclinics treat patients that are in need of 
specialists. The government is shown as part of the exterior 
of the SoI. The Norwegian health care system is funded by 
the government. Universities often collaborate with the 
Norwegian health care system to get support from 
specialists and to stay on top of what kind of research is 
needed. Food and lifestyle companies, such as food 
producers and gyms, are often driven by a need to make 
money. They have an indirect impact on the SoI by affecting 
the patients in one direction or the other. The patient is also 
seen as part of the exterior and giving the patient the best 
care possible is the main purpose of the SoI. Media and 
social media are, like the food/lifestyle companies indirectly 
affecting the SoI by pushing unfiltered information, 
commercials, research, opinions and warnings on the 
patient. 
 
 
Figure 3 Functions 
 
2) Function: As described in paragraph 1), the different 
divisions of the SoI have different functions. As illustrated 
in Figure 3, the patient will receive support and information 
from at least four different functions in the Norwegian 
health care system. The employees are stationed at different 
locations and use different computer systems. The patient 
needs to bring what is called a “health card” to each 
appointment, which is a piece of paper that the doctor, 
nurse, midwife or specialist fills out after each visit. Due to 
strict laws against sharing personal data, information cannot 
automatically be shared with other parts of the health care 
system in all cases.

3) Transformations: A system should always transform 
the given input to a desired output. Figure 4 shows that the 
patient gives input to the Norwegian health care system in 
form of body measurements (weight, height, etc.), test 
materials (blood, urin, saliva), personal history and 
reflections. The health care systems are tasked to use the 
given input to provide the patient a diagnose, suitable 
treatment, relevant information and necessary support. 
 
 
Figure 4 Transformations 
 
4) Emergence: The Norwegian health care system is 
dependent on using reliable tools and cannot afford to be 
pioneers in using new technology. Machines, computer 
systems and medicine must all be certified to meet 
appropriate standards. The consequences of failure can be 
fatal. Introducing new medicine or treatment methods will 
therefore take time before it is approved and considered 
safe. 
5) Communication: The divisions in the Norwegian 
health care system that is in focus during this paper are 
funded by the state or the county. Hospitals and polyclinics 
that are funded by the state will be able to offer more equal 
treatment throughout the country. The doctor’s office and 
health clinics that are founded by each county might offer 
different services and level of support from county to 
county. Each facility has control over themselves, after 
complying with certain requirements, but the funding has an 
impact on the possibilities. 
6) Relationships: To best support the patient, all parts of 
the system should work as a whole. The constantly 
increasing use of technology in todays society introduces a 
world of opportunities to integrate systems and share 
information. Despite this, the different functions in the 
Norwegian health care system are not sharing information in 
an effective manner. Security and restrictions for sharing 
personal data sets limitations and slows down the 
“digitalization”. Today the patient needs to bring a “health 
card” to each appointment. After being diagnosed with 
GDM at the doctors office, she needs to bring her ”health 
card” to the health center and the ultrasound appointments 
and describe to them what the status is. 
7) Harmony: The Norwegian health care system offers a 
large variety of services. As shown in Figure 5, the different 
functions are funded by different parts of the Norwegian 
government. The allocated resources for the different 
functions may therefore vary. The functions that are covered 
by the county are often low on resources, while the 
functions covered by the state have stricter requirements for 
resource allocation. 
 
 
Figure 5 Systemigram 
B. Systemigram 
Identifying stakeholders and the relationship between 
them is useful to obtain a holistic view. Figure 5 presents a 
systemigram where the system of interest, its stakeholders 
and the relationships are identified. As illustrated, the 
patient is affected by a number of other stakeholders that 
cannot be controlled by the system of interest (SoI). It is 
important to identify these and acknowledge their presence. 
In that way, the health care system can develop means to 
reduce the negative effects these external factors may have 
on the patients. 
III. 
 RESEARCH STUDY 
While gathering research, the authors aimed to answer 
the following three questions: 
• 
What are the risk factors for being diagnosed with 
GDM? 
• 
What are the potential physiological effects for the 
woman and baby? 
• 
What are the potential psychological effects for the 
woman and what can these result in?

A. Developing GDM 
6-11% of pregnant Norwegian women are diagnosed 
with GDM [1]. The reasons for developing the condition are 
complex and not fully documented. What is known is that 
during a pregnancy, the hormones released in the body 
reduces the effectiveness of the insulin. In most cases the 
body is able to increase the insulin production sufficiently, 
but in other cases not. Factors that increases the risk of 
developing GDM are [12]:  
• 
Glucosuria 
• 
Family history of type 2 diabetes or GDM 
• 
History of unexplained fetal demise 
• 
High age 
• 
Obesity 
 
 
Figure 6 Barriers preventing people to lead a healthy lifestyle [13] 
 
 
 
Figure 7 Causal loop diagram 
 
If we look at the last point, obesity, which is the factor that 
is often in focus, the causes for this are again complex. 
Three commonly known factors for developing a high BMI 
are: 
• 
Lifestyle 
• 
Genetics 
• 
Environment 
When eating too much and/or unhealthy food and 
performing little exercise, the body will gain weight. How 
much and in what rate may depend on genetics. How to stop 
the obesity epidemic, that is frequently mentioned in the 
news these days, is not a question with a straightforward 
answer. The media’s focus and the ”black and white” 
attitude of some people may be a contributing factor to the 
problem rather than the solution. Devsam et al. [13] 
mentions some barriers preventing people to lead a healthy 
lifestyle. These are illustrated in Figure 6. Barriers such as 
fatigue may also be observed as an effect of unhealthy 
lifestyle choices, resulting in a downward spiral that is hard 
to come out of. The reinforcing causal loop diagram in 
Figure 7 illustrates this phenomenon. 
B. Physiological effects of GDM 
GDM is a condition that is usually limited to the 
pregnancy. A well-managed condition will not contribute to 
any dangerous consequences, but if the condition is not well 
managed the risk of serious complications for the baby, as 
listed below, may increase significantly [14]: 
• 
High gestational birth weight  
• 
Overall metabolic complications 
• 
Stillbirth 
• 
Shoulder dystocia 
Similarly, if the condition is poorly managed, consequences 
for the mother may be [15]: 
• 
Hypertension 
• 
Cesarean delivery 
• 
Risk of developing diabetes type 2 later in life 
A positive outcome of receiving the diagnosis is actually 
that many women are able to change their lifestyle during 
pregnancy and able to maintain the new lifestyle after giving 
birth [16]. 
C. Psychological effects of GDM 
Evans and O’Brien say in their paper [17]: 
“The implication that impending 
motherhood is a condition of risk or 
peril that requires ‘surveillance, 
control, and intervention at any sign of 
deviation from normal’ might 
undermine one’s self-identity and 
desired level of autonomy as a 
pregnant woman.” 
Even a normal pregnancy introduces new thoughts, worries 
and changes to the body that in themselves can be 
overwhelming. Being informed about abnormalities can add 
unnecessary stress and worry. Several studies have been 
conducted on this topic and a common conclusion of most 
of these studies are that the women diagnosed with GDM 
have more negative emotions attached to their pregnancy 
and health than women without the diagnosis. Devsam et al. 
[13] conducted a study where they gathered the initial 
4

ICONS 2020 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Systems

responses from women who was diagnosed with GDM, 
before proposing a framework to enhance midwifery 
assessment. The initial responses are presented in Figure 8. 
The guilt could be related to not taking better care of 
themselves, staying in a stressful job or having the baby late 
in life. The women repeatedly asked questions about the 
causes of their condition and often blamed themselves for it 
[13], [18]. They also had negative reactions as to how to 
control the condition, as shown in Figure 9.

IV. 
 REFLECTION AND DISCUSSION 
Is the benefits of testing, diagnosing and treating 
pregnant women with GDM outweighing the negative 
psychological implications the diagnosis may have on the 
individuals? Jarrett [19] writes in his paper that: 
“The association between blood 
glucose concentrations and fetal 
weight is lost when adjustment is made 
for maternal weight and age.” 
He also states that: 
“The women with gestational diabetes 
in the original Boston studies had 
higher perinatal mortality, though the 
difference was not statistically 
significant, and the published analyses 
did not sufficiently examine the 
potential confounding variables, of 
which age and obesity were the most 
obvious.” 
This implicates that the GDM diagnosis itself is not causing 
the complications, and may only introduce extra stress to the 
patient. There is however reason to believe that receiving 
the diagnosis may have positive impact on the patient’s 
ability to change their lifestyle. According to Sjøgren et al. 
[16] 34% of the women included in their study that was 
diagnosed with GDM were able to stick to a healthy diet 
also after pregnancy. Egeland et al. [20] states that GDM 
does introduce higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. 
Detection and control of the diagnosis will help reduce these 
risks, but how can the health care system best treat and 
support the women receiving the diagnosis? As several 
studies show, the psychological impact on the patient is 
significant and should not be underestimated. Lawson et al. 
[18] states that women experience fear, depression and 
anxiety. It is important that the patient receives relevant and 
correct information immediately after the diagnosis has been 
set, to outweigh the often “one-sided” information 
introduced by the media. As described by Devsam et al. 
[13], Swedish women experienced a two weeks gap between 
receiving the diagnosis and having the first appointment at 
the specialized diabetes clinic where they had to seek 
information from books and the Internet in between. During 
the appointment with the specialist, their concerns were 
reduced. This implies that it is beneficial to reserve some 
time after the glucose intolerance test to properly inform and 
support the women that is diagnosed with GDM. 
V. 
 CONCLUSION 
The first part of the paper presents the health care system 
as the system of interest by using different systems thinking 
tools. The purpose of using these tools is to illustrate the 
complexity of the system of interest and the gestational 
diabetes diagnosis in an understandable way. The last part 
of the paper discusses the physiological and psychological 
aspects of the diagnosis before discussing the positive and 
negative effects of being diagnosed. Even though the 
research is pointing in different directions regarding the 
potential consequences of GDM, the diagnosis can be a 
wakeup call that motivates the patient to adopt a healthier 
lifestyle. The psychological implications should not be 
underestimated, but considered to a greater extent in the 
health care system. Giving thorough information as close to 
the diagnosing as possible should be prioritized to avoid a 
long period where the patient seeks information that may 
turn out irrelevant or incorrect. Some future work could be a 
5

ICONS 2020 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Systems

research study investigating if rapid and thorough 
information reduces the negative psychological effects on 
the patient. Such a study may give the health care system 
motivation to prioritize giving the information earlier. 
Another interesting case for future work would be using 
systems thinking methods, such as the conceptagon and 
systemigram, to identify which factors have the most   
positive and negative impact on the psychology of the 
patient. This may contribute to finding focus areas for 
information flow.
