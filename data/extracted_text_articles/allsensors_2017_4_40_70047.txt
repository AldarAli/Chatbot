Abstract— The paper presents an area and speed efficient 
CMOS layout design of shift register on 180 nanometer (nm) 
technology. The proposed shift register is designed using Serial 
In Serial Out (SISO) and Serial In Parallel Out (SIPO) 
techniques. Shift registers are commonly used in large number 
of sequential circuits and processors for temporary storage of 
data. The area and speed of developed layout designs are 
improved by optimized placement and routing for layout. The 
schematic and layout of both designs are simulated and 
analyzed using Cadence software. It can be observed from 
simulated results that the delay of SISO register is 0.97 ns and 
the delay of SIPO register is 0.71 ns. The SISO register shows 
78.6% improvement in delay and SIPO register shows 27.46 % 
improvement in delay. The silicon area consumption of SISO 
register is 140.6 nm x 129.49 nm and SIPO register is 130.98 
nm x 85.91 nm to provide cost effective solution for Very Large 
Scale Integration (VLSI) applications.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The new era of technology had a great impact on the 
field of VLSI, which is constantly under examination by 
many researchers throughout the world. It involves mainly 
increase in speed, reduction of area and power consumption 
[1]. Most vital component of the Integrated Circuits (ICs) 
for temporary storage of data is a Flip Flop. It stores a 
logical condition of one or more input signals using external 
clock [2]. Flip-flops are used in majority of computational 
circuits to store the data and provide adequate processing 
time to different circuits inside a system. In CMOS circuits, 
D Flip Flop (DFF) is essential building block and is 
responsible for the delay and total power dissipation 
calculations of any electronic system. Shift registers, which 
are created with the help of D flip-flops, have their intensive 
applications in various VLSI fields. The design of a shift 
register includes an N-bit shift register, made out of N 
number of Flip Flops [3][4][5]. 
 
A register is a circuit with two or more D Flip Flops 
connected together such that they all work exactly in the 
same way and a single clock synchronizes all the flip flops 
[6][7]. Each of these flip-flops has the ability of storing a 
single logic i.e., 0 or 1. There are limited compositions of 0 
and 1 that can be stored into a register. These combinations 
are called the state of the register. Flip-Flops can store data 
in multiple sizes like 4, 8, 16, 32 or even 64 bits. Thus, 
several Flip Flops are combined to form a register to store 
whole data [8][9]. Fully custom 4-bit CMOS shift register 
consumes less power and less area as compare to semi 
custom and auto generated designs [10]. Double Edge 
Triggered Flip Flops are bi-stable flip-flop circuits in which 
data is latched at rising and falling edge of the clock signal. 
Using such flip-flops permits the rate of data processing to 
be preserved while using lower clock frequency. Therefore, 
power consumption in DETFF based circuits is less [11].  
 
Three important factors related to nanometer technology 
based shift registers are power, delay and area. Most of the 
existing designs are concentrating on power factor without 
considering others. Some are working on power and area 
factors by ignoring delay factor which is very important 
these days for real time applications. So in order to fill these 
gaps related to shift register designs, optimized SISO and 
SIPO registers are developed in this paper to provide area 
efficient cost effective solution for real time applications. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents shift register overview. In Section III, schematic 
design and simulations are presented. Section IV explains 
the layout design and analysis. Finally, Section V concludes 
the paper with the future work. 
  
II. SHIFT REGISTER 
The main use of shift register is transmission of data 
after storage in serial or parallel manner. Serial means 
steady progression of bits in sequential manner and parallel 
means progression of all bits at the same time. Generally, 
shift registers are classified according to their structure into 
four different operating modes:  
1. Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) - The data is fed serially 
as input and the shifted output also occurs serially, one bit at 
a time in either left or right direction under clock control. 
 
2. Serial-In Parallel-Out (SIPO) - The register is loaded 
with serial data, one bit at a time, with the output being 
stored in parallel form.

3. Parallel-In Serial-Out (PISO) - The data is loaded in 
parallel form into the register simultaneously and is shifted 
out of the register serially one bit at a time under clock 
control. 
 
4. Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) - The parallel data is 
loaded simultaneously into the register, and transferred 
together to their respective outputs by the same clock pulse 
[12]. 
A. Serial In Serial Out Shift Register 
 
Fig. 1 shows an example of four-bit SISO shift register 
using Single Bit Flip-Flop (SBFF). 
 
 
Figure 1. Serial-In Serial-Out Shift Register 
 
A 4-bit SISO shift register is shown which takes four 
clock pulses to store the data bits and additional four cycles 
to transfer the data bits out from the register [12][13]. 
 
B. 
Serial-In to Parallel-Out (SIPO) 
 
Fig. 2 shows a four-bit SIPO shift register which takes 
four clocks to process the input data and single clock to 
transfer the output data [10][11]. 
 
 
Figure 2. Serial-In to Parallel-Out 4-bit Shift Register 
 
Every clock pulse impacts the register by shifting the data 
of every stage one place to the right. This data value at the 
output can now be read directly from QA. After the fourth 
clock pulse has ended the 4-bits of data are stored in the 
register and will remain there provided clocking of the 
register has stopped.  
III. SCHEMATIC DESIGN SIMULATION  
The schematic of SISO register has been designed and 
simulated using 1.8V operating voltage on 180nm 
technology. Fig. 3 shows the schematic design of D flip-flop 
using NAND modules with power consumption of 
746.8mW and delay of 0.245ns.
