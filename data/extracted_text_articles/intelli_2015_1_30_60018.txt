Abstract— This paper considers psychological evaluation of the 
visual impression of the delayed movement of an avatar that 
performs interaction where actions of human are imitated by 
using the skeleton model obtained from Kinect sensor. In the 
interaction, the perception of the level of delay, impression of 
delay and habituation to the delayed movement of the avator 
are investigated through some exercising experiments. From 
the results of the questionnaire for subjects who experience the 
delayed movement of the avator, those visual impression are 
analyzed and the novel habituation based on a certain level in 
the experience is discussed. 
Keywords-delayed movement;avator;visual impression;  
habituation. 
 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Avatar can be projected on a screen in real time by 
applying humanoid Computer Graphics (CG) on the skeleton 
model extracted from the human motion capture. By seeing 
the avatar, the user can evaluate one’s own motion in real 
time while moving. 
However, in the real-time display of the avatar, in fact, 
time delay occurs during the process of extracting 
information from body motion and information process of 
applying it to humanoid CG. In other words, time delay 
occurs while the movement of user is reflected and displayed 
in the avatar. 
Time delay is known to affect the human psychology. 
Many research works have been undertaken regarding this 
mainly focusing on the interaction between humans and 
artifacts. It was pointed out that the delay of the computer 
response time adversely affects psychology [1],. The 
psychological influence in the utterance delay was studied 
well [2],[3], and it was  found that delay of one second or 
more has adverse impact, and voice of the conversation tends 
to increase. The effect of appearance of an artificial agent 
and utterance time on psychology was studied [4],[5], and it 
was shown that higher is the delay, worse are the 
psychological changes. In the conversation between humans 
and robots, it was investigated the effect of starting time of 
utterance by Robot and timing of nodding on the psychology, 
and revealed that delay gives bad feelings [6],[7],.  
In these studies, it is stated that in the interaction between 
humans and artifacts, delayed reaction of artifacts to a 
stimulus from the outside world has a negative impact on the 
psychology of humans. This impact pertains to usability 
when a human uses the artifacts, and it must be treated as an 
important problem. However, these studies consider the 
cases while verbal communication is taking place, and they 
do not discuss the effect of time delay in the body motion 
interaction between humans and artifacts on the psychology. 
In this paper, we will discuss about psychological 
evaluation of the visual impression of the delayed motion of 
the avatar as an artifact that performs interaction where 
actions of human are simulated. Motion considered in this 
paper is swing movement often seen in exercising, where the 
human raises and lowers both arms. We will have this 
discussion about perception of the level of delay, impression 
of delay, and habituation to delay. Here, the level of delay 
means a quantitative expression of how much the delay a 
human feels.  
We will explain the details of the experiment conducted 
in this paper for psychological evaluation. Recent software 
systems of artifacts can adjust the delayed degree of 
movement with digital filter functions. In other words, it is 
possible to adjust the delay time in the process of displaying 
avatar with human motion capture. Using this, in our 
experiment, we measured the stage from when the human 
clearly recognizes it as delay when the delay time is changed 
in a stepwise manner. Measuring this delayed degree should 
be useful in offering guidance for improving the avatar 
system. 
Next, we administered a questionnaire survey about the 
impression the subject got when seeing the avatar that moves 
according to the movement of the subject. We studied the 
impression the subject got when the he saw that movement 
of the avatar is slower than him (hereinafter referred to as the 
delayed movement) while the subject does the swing 
movement.  
In Section 3, in order to obtain the characteristics of this 
impression, we use different movements than the delayed 
movement. These are two types of movements, namely, state 
where movements of the subject and the avatar seem to be 
matching (hereinafter referred to as the synchro movement) 
and the state where movement of the avatar seems to have 
progressed than that of the subject (hereinafter referred to as 
the lead movement). The reason why these two movements 
are conducted is that the synchro movement is used for the 
bench mark and the lead motion is used to highlight the 
visual impression for the delay movement. Then, we will 
compare impression evaluation and consider habituation to 
delay.

EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT AND METHOD 
Hardware used in the experiment is comprised of 
Microsoft Kinect for measuring the movement of the subject, 
PC that creates movement of the avatar based on the 
movement of the subject, and projector and screen for 
displaying the avatar to the subject. 
Figure.1 
shows 
the 
hardware 
configuration 
for 
measurement of the human motion and the avatar display 
system. As software, we used Kinect for windows SDK [8], 
which is the library for obtaining the human motion from the 
depth data photographed with Kinect and Microsoft XNA 
[9] ,for drawing the avatar. With Kinect for Windows SDK, 
we can obtain the subject's movement data, and by 
transferring this data to Microsoft XNA, avatar can display 
identical movement as the subject.  
 Figure. 2 shows an image of the avatar displayed to the 
subject during the experiment. Figure. 3 shows the 
experiment in progress where the subject is moving his body 
while watching the avatar. Strictly speaking, movements of 
the avatar and the subject are not synchronized. Rather, after 
measuring the movement of the subject with Kinect, 
movement is created in the avatar and after that the avatar 
will act. Therefore, irrespective of whether the subject 
realizes or not, movement of the avatar starts with delay. In 
Kinect, with the filter process, by delaying and advancing the 
subsequent movement, it is possible to control the delay time 
from the actual movement.  
In this experiment, in the first place, we will measure the 
level of delay where the subject feels that delay has occurred 
while gradually increasing the delayed degree of the 
movement of the avatar. For implementing the delayed 
movement in the avatar, in this paper, we adjust the 
parameters of digital filter included in Kinect for Windows 
SDK. This filter is equipped with the smoothing function, 
and it is used for removing the errors in the measurement 
data where such errors have occurred due to disturbance of 
shooting conditions and the like in Kinect. By changing the 
parameters of this filter, it is possible to have smoothing 
effect and cause delay in the movement data of the subject 
obtained with Kinect. Then, by implementing this movement 
data with delay on the avatar, movement of the avatar will be 
delayed than the actual movement of the subject.  
As the filter parameters, Prediction [>=0.0] and 
Smoothing [0.0 , 1.0] are available. Value of Prediction is the 
number of frames that predicts the movement. Its default 
value is 0.0, and it tends to overshoot from around 0.5. So, 
we used the values in the range of 0.4 and below. Value of 
Smoothing is the smoothing index. When it is 0.0, there is no 
delay, and when it is 1.0, delay is at the maximum. Default 
value is 0.5, and based on our experience, we selected values 
equal to or higher than this value.  
Table I shows the perceived level of delay in five stages 
as the level of delay with respect to the delayed movement in 
this experiment. 
We will now explain about the method of creating this 
perceived level. During the course when the subject moves 
his body while watching the avatar displayed on the screen, 
we gradually changed the parameter value using the 
Smoothing function of Kinect. When increasing the 
parameter of Smoothing, the movement of the avatar will not 
be able to keep up with the movement of the subject, and 
movement will become sluggish. This state where the avatar 
hardly move is considered as maximum delay. Against this, 
the state where the movement of avatar appears to be

synchronous with the subject himself is considered as 
minimum delay, and this interval was divided into 5 stages.  
Subject's movement of raising and lowering arms while 
watching the avatar was aligned too to the metronome of 
100BPM (Beat Per Minute). Parameter set #1 through #5 
shown in Table I was changed every 5 seconds. The subject 
would move his body for every parameter set. After that the 
subject was asked "Do you think that the avatar you just saw 
was delayed compared to your movement?" Subject's 
response was collected in Yes / No or Possibly as shown in 
Table III. This was repeated 5 times, and response data was 
collected and summarized.  
For verifying impression evaluation with respect to 
delayed movement, we thought that it is necessary to have 
another comparison target. Based on this, we designed 
"synchro movement" and "lead movement". The former one 
synchronizes with the movement of the subject, while the 
latter one advances the phase of movement using differential 
operation. This was implemented using the parameters 
shown in Table II. 
In this experiment, we used three movements, namely, 
"delayed movement", "synchro movement", and "lead 
movement". The "synchro movement" is placed as a bench 
mark to measure objectively, to compare, and to evaluate the 
difference of the impression. 
The following experiment was carried out for impression 
evaluation.  
[Step 1] In the first place, in order to have the experience of 
the delayed movement of the avatar, while watching the 
avatar moving as per the settings of #3 in Table I, the 
subject moved his body for about 5 seconds along with the 
sounds of metronome and experienced the delayed 
movement of the avatar. Similarly, the subject moved his 
body for about 5 seconds for the lead movement (Lead in 
Table2) and the synchro movement (Synchronization in 
Table 2) and experienced these movements. 
[Step 2] In order to find out perception of the level of delay, 
we changed the parameter set in Table I from #1 to #5 at 
every 5 seconds. Every time when changing the parameter, 
we asked the subject whether the movement is delayed or 
not. 
[Step 3] Next, we find out how the impression regarding 
delayed differs from synchro movement and lead 
movement. For that, for each subject, we run the delay 
movement using the parameter sets in Table I for which the 
subjects felt the delay, and we changed the movements of 
avatar as per the following patterns. 
[Pattern 1] delayed movement (10 seconds) →  synchro 
movement (10 seconds) →  delayed movement (10 
seconds) 
[Pattern 2] synchro movement (10 seconds) →  synchro 
movement (10 seconds) →  synchro movement (10 
seconds)  
[Pattern 3] lead movement (10 seconds) →  synchro 
movement (10 seconds) → lead movement (10 seconds) 
 
These patterns were created based on the concept of 
placing the synchro movement at the middle position, and 
placing three types of movement patterns on both sides. 
In this experiment, there was 14 subjects, all males in 
their 20s. As for the sequence of the experiment, after 
completing [Step 1], subjects went to [Step 2], and after that 
they went to [Step 3]. Step 1 is preparation for the 
experiment to be conducted here onwards. 
III. 
ANALYSIS OF IMPRESSION EVALUATION 
A. Evaluation Items 
Restating the explanation given in Chapter 2, the 
following are the evaluation items in impression evaluation.  
 
P1: From what stage does the subject sense "delay" in the 
movement of the avatar? This leads to perceptual 
evaluation of the level of delay.  
P2: What kind of the impression the subject forms regarding 
delayed movement of the avatar?  
P3: Look into impression of each movement of the avatar, 
and see if there are any differences in the evaluation of 
each pattern. This leads to finding out habituation to delay.   
 
For investigating P1, we conducted the experiment 
mentioned in [Step 2] in the preceding section. For 
investigating P2 and P3, we conducted the experiment 
mentioned in [Step 3].  
B. Analysis of P1 
Response data for three perceptions, namely, the 
movement of the avatar is "delayed", "possibly delayed", and 
"not delayed", was summarized for each parameter set. Table 
III shows the results of this. 
From the results in Table III, for parameter set 3 and 
above, about 40% of the subjects responded that the 
movement of the avatar is "delayed". For parameter set 2 and 
above, about half of the subjects responded that the 
movement of the avatar is "possible delayed". Smoothing of 
parameter set 2 is set only slightly higher than the default

value, and it resulted in somewhat ambiguous perception. In 
the case of parameter set 4 and 5, the subjects are divided 
into two groups, namely, group that clearly recognized that 
the movement is "delayed" and the group that vaguely 
sensed the delay. However, this excludes a small number of 
subjects who responded that the movement is "not delayed". 
In the case of parameter set 5, about 70% of the subjects 
recognized that the movement of the avatar is clearly 
"delayed".  
Based on these results, it came to light that the subjects 
sense the "delayed movement" of the avatar from parameter 
3 onwards. At the stage of parameter set 2, the subjects may 
not sense that the movement is delayed. 
C. Analysis of P2 
In P2, we administered a questionnaire survey to find out 
the kind of impression with respect to the "delayed 
movement" of the avatar. Simultaneously, apart from the 
"delayed movement", we also studied the "synchro 
movement" and the "lead movement". With regard to the 
pair of adjectives used in this method, we referred to the 
previous studies [10], [11] ,related to impression evaluation 
of the movement of robot, and we prepared 13 pairs of 
adjectives shown in Table IV and we conducted evaluation 
in 7 stages.  
Table V shows the average value of response data 
obtained from 14 subjects for three movements. Next, from 
the data group of each movement, in order to find out 
relationship with the respective impression evaluation, we 
conducted correspondence analysis [12], on the results 
shown in Table V. Figure. 4 shows the outcome of this 
analysis. 
The following can be concluded from the results shown 
in Figure. 4. 
 
For the “delayed movement”, the subjects formed the 
impressions such as “like other human”, “unexpected”, 
and “unfriendly”, and other impressions such as “fast 
and slow” and “ moderate” based on the speed of 
movement 
 
For “synchro movement”, the subjects formed the 
impressions such as “smooth”, “natural”, “like oneself”, 
“enjoyable”, “soft”, and “comfortable”.  
 
Subjects formed the impression that the “lead 
movement” was “hard” and “intense”. However, some 
of the subjects responded that they formed the 
impressions such as “interesting”, “as expected”, and 
“pleasant”. 
 
 As compared to the “synchro movement”, the subjects 
clearly realized the difference in the movement in the 
“delayed movement”. The subjects felt uncomfortable 
that the movement of avatar didn’t match with their 
movement. 
 
There were some subjects who favorably treated the 
“delayed movement” as smooth movement. However,

in terms of the overall trend, subjects had a negative 
impression of the “delayed movement”. 
 
Impression became positive in the case of the “synchro 
movement”. 
 
In the “lead movement”, while there was negative 
impression, simultaneously, the subjects also found it 
“interesting” and “pleasant”. 
 
In the settings of the "lead movement", in the present 
Kinect, the avatar reacted acutely to the speed of 
exercising in the subjects, which formed the impression 
such as "hard" and "intense". However, there were 
opposite responses to this impression such as 
"interesting", "as expected" and "pleasant". 
 
D. Analysis of P3 
In the preceding paragraph, we mentioned that apart from 
"hard" and "intense" that was the impression evaluation with 
respect to the "lead movement", subjects formed the 
impression of "interesting", "as expected" and "pleasant" as 
in the case of "synchro movement". Because it was found 
that the subjects formed similar impression in these two 
movement patterns, we will verify whether there are any 
differences in impression between the "synchro movement" 
and the "lead movement". From the point of view, P3 was 
designed.  
 We carried out impression evaluation for the experiment 
[Step 3] where three types of movements, namely, "delayed 
movement", "synchro movement", and "lead movement" are 
combined. Here, data group for each of three types of 
movements of avatar were named as data group of 
movements. We set the hypothesis that "there is no 
difference between levels due to the data group of 
movement", and we carried out corresponding one-way 
analysis of variance (Repeated measures ANOVA)[13],. 
Table VI shows the results of this analysis. The one-way 
analysis of variance (Repeated measures ANOVA) is used to 
determine whether there are any significant differences 
between the means of two or more groups. 
Results in Table VI showed statistical significant in the 
class of movement from the significance level (p < 0.01). 
Accordingly, the hypothesis "There is not difference between 
the levels" was rejected, and it can be said that the 
impression formed in the subjects for three movements of the 
avatar are different.  
Furthermore, in order to shed light on the difference 
between movements of different phase, we used the 
Bonferroni's 
method 
[14], 
and 
conducted 
multiple 
comparison. Table VII shows the results of this comparison.  
Based on these results, it is evident that in the movements 
of the avatar, "delayed movement" and "synchro movement", 
and "delayed movement" and "lead movement" are 
statistically significant (p<0.05). In other words, the 
impression formed for "delayed movement" is different from 
that for "synchro movement" and "lead movement". On the 
other hand, it cannot be said that impression differs for 
"synchro movement" and "lead movement".

IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
In the present paper, we shed light on the numerical value 
of the level of delay based on the experiment where the 
subject recognizes that the movement of the avatar is 
"delayed" from his movement, and we verified its stage. 
Next, we conducted a survey about impression formed by the 
subject 
regarding 
the 
avatar 
that 
moves 
out 
of 
synchronization with the subject.  
To start with, as the results of P1 stated in this paper, we 
conducted experiment and quantitatively define the level of 
delay where the subjects recognize that the movement of the 
avatar is "delayed" than their movement, and we ascertained 
the stage of this level. As a result, it became clear that at 
parameter 3 and above, about 40% of subject sensed 
"delayed movement" where the movement in the avatar was 
delayed compared to the subjects' movement.  
Next, as the result for P2, it came to light that the subjects 
feel uncomfortable with the "delayed movement". In the 
"synchro movement" experienced  by the subjects after the 
delayed movement, they formed the impressions such as 
"natural", "like oneself", and "amiable", and in the "lead 
movement", the subjects formed the impressions such as " 
hard" and "intense", as well as "interesting", "as expected", 
and "pleasant". 
In P3, we verified whether there is any difference in the 
impression evaluation of each of three types of movements 
of the avatar confirmed in P2, namely, "delayed movement", 
"synchro movement", and "lead movement". Here, we found 
that while the "delayed movement" gave a different 
impression than the "synchro movement" and the "lead 
movement", it cannot be said that impression differed in the 
"synchro movement" and the "lead movement". As for the 
impression of the "lead movement", the impression 
evaluation was "interesting", "as expected" and "pleasant", 
which was most likely because of habituation [15], in 
perception in terms of mitigation of the sense of discomfort 
to time delay and adverse psychological effect (becoming 
insensitive). This habituation differs from simple stimulation 
[16], mentioned in the preceding studies and reactive 
habituation [17], that occurs due to iterative presentation of 
irritation. Habituation showed by these results are similar to 
habituation explained by [18], [19], in terms of order effect 
where after experiencing the "synchro movement", the 
subjects become insensitive to the delay of the movement. 
However, we think it is a new finding that the order of 
movement patterns affects psychology. Nonetheless, we 
have used only three patterns of order in this experiment, and 
our next challenge is to study and discuss changes in 
impression and habituation for different order of movements.
