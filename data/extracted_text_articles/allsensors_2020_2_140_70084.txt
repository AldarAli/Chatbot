Abstract—This work reports a highly sensitive Fe doped ZnO
nanoneedles
based
gas
sensor
for
detection
at
low
concentrations. Pure and Fe doped ZnO were synthesized via a
hydrothermal method and spray-coated onto an alumina
substrates. The sensing properties were investigated under
different
temperatures
and
concentrations.
Fe
doping
significantly
increased
the
sensing

of
ZnO
nanoneedles. The 5 at% Fe doped sensor showed the best
response to isopropanol and the optimal working temperature
is 275oC. The sensor showed a high response to 250 ppb
isopropanol, together with high stability under different
humidity levels.

INTRODUCTION
To realize the early detection of lung cancer via e-nose,
sensors with high response to low concentrations of Volatile
Organic Compounds (VOCs) biomarkers are necessary.
Metal oxide sensor is a good candidate for the sensors in e-
nose [1][2]. Isopropanol is one of the important biomarkers
of lung cancer. The concentration of isopropanol in the
breath of lung cancer patients can come up to over 270 ppb,
with an average concentration of 438 ppb [3]. In this work,
we present a sensor that can detect ppb level isopropanol as
low as to 250 ppb with good stability in humidity.
In Section Ⅱ, we will introduce the method we use to
synthesize the sensing materials, characterizing the as-
synthesized powders and making the sensing test. In Section
Ⅲ, the results of characterization and sensing test are shown.
We conclude our work in Section IV.
II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The ZnO nanoneedles are synthesized via a simple
hydrothermal method. 3×10-3 mol of Zn(NO3)•2H2O were
dissolved into 44 ml of deionized water. Meanwhile, 1 g of
Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) was dissolved
in 22 ml of ethanol. After that, 3×10-2 mol of NaOH was
added into the Zn(NO3)2 solution, then the two different
solutions were mixed, followed with the addition of 10 ml
ethylenediamine. The solution was treated at 100oC for 2 h in
an oven. The obtained powder was washed and dried in an
oven overnight. To prepare the Fe-doped ZnO needles,
Fe(NO3)3 solutions with different concentrations were slowly
added into the Zn(NO3)2 solution before the addition of
NaOH. The doping contents of Fe were 1%, 3% and 5% by
atom ratio, which are written as 1 at%, 3 at% and 5 at% Fe-
ZnO. The sensors are prepared on alumina substrate with
gold interdigitated electrodes by spraying.
The
as-synthesized
powders
are
characterized
by
Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) [4], Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) [5] and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
[6]. The gas sensing test is carried out in a home-made
system. The gas flow is controlled at 1 L/min by 3 flow
meters. Before the sensing test, all the sensors were pre-
heated at 350oC for 1 week. The response of the sensors was
defined as S=(Ra-Rg)/Rg. In the equation, S refers to the
response of the sensor, Ra represents the electrical resistance
in air, Rg represents the electrical resistance the target gas.
The response and recovery time were respectively defined as
the time needed to reach 90% of the maximum response and
the time needed to recover to 110% of the baseline.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD of the samples indicated that all the samples
are ZnO or Fe-doped ZnO without any other impurities. The
main peak of Fe-ZnO has a small shifting to the left with the
increase of the amount of Fe, indicating that the Fe3+ was
doped into the ZnO. The SEM picture of pure and different
Fe-doped ZnO are shown in Figure 1. All the samples have
needle like nanostructure. The Fe doping changed the
structure of ZnO, making the needles become smaller.

Fig. 2 (a) and (b) exhibited the resistance change and gas
sensing performance of Fe-ZnO to different concentrations
of isopropanol at 275oC with 50% Relative Humidity (RH).
The resistance of the four sensors decreased significantly
with the presence of isopropanol, which indicated that the
Fe-doped ZnO remains n-type. The response of 5 at% Fe-
doped
ZnO
nanoneedles
can
reach
23.6
when
the
concentration
of
isopropanol
is
5
ppm.
When
the
concentration of isopropanol decreased to 250 ppb, the
response still can reach around 4.7. The response and
recovery time of 5 at% Fe-doped ZnO to 5 ppm ZnO is
calculated as 51 s and 762 s respectively. Fig. 2 (c) shows the
response to 5 ppm isopropanol at different temperature. It
can be seen that the Fe doping not only increases the
response,
but
also
decreases
the
optimal
operating
temperature. Fig. 2 (d) is the response to 5 ppm isopropanol
under different RH. From 25% to 100%, the response of 5
at% Fe-ZnO is not affected by RH a lot. In Table 1, we
compared the results with some other works.
For the gas sensing mechanism, we consider that the
isopropanol reacted with both the adsorbed oxygen ions and
the Fe3+ doped in the ZnO.
IV.
CONCLUSION
ZnO and Fe-doped ZnO nanoneedles were synthesized
via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The Fe doping
changed the morphology of ZnO. The Fe-doped ZnO retains
the n-type semiconductor property. The 5 at% Fe-doped ZnO
showed the best sensing performance to isopropanol at
275oC with fast response. The improvement of sensing
properties is considered as the adjustment of the band
structure by the doping of Fe.
