Abstract— The present work gathers all the experience and
knowledge from a group of students of last semester, taking the
course entitled “Project of mechatronic engineering”, which
focused on actual problems of the local region. This class used
an investigation method to approach these problems and teach
students about self-learning. The objective of this project was
to show students how the theory learned in school can be
applied on the field.
Keywords—
inquiry-based
learning;
project;
challenge;
image processing.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In many situations, undergraduate students struggle to
identify the relationship between the knowledge they have
acquired throughout the course of their bachelor studies and
their future jobs. Some manage to apply their studies through
internships in their field, where they develop specific tasks
for the companies they work for; others get involved in
projects of interest to those entities and develop other
abilities through research.
The current tendency to solve these problems is the
linkage through university-industry projects that can occur
through different pedagogical approaches, for example
Research-Based Learning (RBL). This approach consists in
applying teaching and learning strategies that aim to connect
research with teaching.
[1]. Berkeley, Warwick, MIT,
Oxford, among others, are prestigious universities that
promote this practice.
Pedaste et al. [2] identify and summarize the main
characteristics of the RBL and set out the five phases and
subphases, which are written in parenthesis, that distinguish
it (see Figure 1): orientation, conceptualization (questioning
and
hypothesis
generation),
investigation
(exploration,
experimentation
and
data
interpretation),
conclusion,
discussion (communication and reflection).
The authors did not find a framework which could gather
and elaborate on the five phases and subphases exposed
above, which allowed them to define the phases and
subphases in what they called the Research Cycle, as shown
in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Research Cycle.
It is important to mention three elements of reference [2]:
1) The formulation of the technique is useful as
guidance
for
those
who
desire
to
incorporate
the
pedagogical approach of RBL in their classes.
2) The presence of the discussion phase running parallel
to the other phases provides a method in which designing is
constantly happening, and it is not necessary to wait until
the end to make adjustments because pondering and
communication can be done at any moment.
3) Depending on the available information regarding the
problem, three approaches can be proposed by students to
develop the project: based on data, based on a hypothesis
starting from a known theory, and based on questions that
allow the formulation of a hypothesis. This last one is
considered to come from the second.
Among the advantages that RBL offers, it can be
mentioned that it allows better mentoring relationships
between the professors and the students than traditional

teaching, which results in improved learning and retention in
undergraduate students. Also, enrollment in postgraduate
education might be increased. In addition, students develop
creativity, problem solving and intellectual independence;
they also develop an understanding of research methodology.
Finally,
RBL
promotes
a
culture
oriented
towards
innovation. The other pillar that supports this work is
Applied Research (AR). The term “Applied Research” was
popularized during the twentieth century to refer to the type
of scientific studies aimed at solving problems of daily life
and controlling practical situations. It is currently a relevant
topic, considering the close connection it has between
education and industry. Its objective is to solve a specific
approach focusing on the search and consolidation of
knowledge
for
its
application
and,
therefore,
for
the
enrichment of cultural and scientific development [3].
Some important considerations about AR are highlighted
below:
1)
It can not be developed outside of theoretical and
basic knowledge, which means that it is based on the results
of Basic Research (BR), so that AR is the logical continuity
of BR. However, the relationship between AR and BR is
biunivocal, because the results of the AR help to rectify and
expand
the
concepts
emanating
from
the
BR,
thus
contributing to the consolidations of a theory. As expressed
in [4], many academics carry out the hybrid research,
mixing both types of research, due to the need to obtain
funds for their investigation, which can be provided by
public or private institutions, letting them to test or apply
what they have researched.
2)
It allows to transform theoretical knowledge into
concepts, prototypes, products, processes or services. This
implies a close collaboration between the academy and
higher education (teachers and students), industry and users.
Therefore, there is a need for the participation of the end
users and the industry responsible for verifying that it meets
the needs.
This
work
gathers
the
experience
carried
out
by
mechatronic students, which allows them to identify the
relationship between the knowledge acquired throughout
their career, and an application in a real work environment.
Part of the objective of devolving the current research work
was to answer the question: “To what extent do the
mechatronic engineering students recognize the link between
the knowledge acquired in their career and the way they
carry out an AR project associated with the solution of a real-
world problem proposed by a company or an institution?”
First, the students were presented with a need from a
company or institution, which must be solved by applying
the
knowledge
gained
throughout
their
career.
After
choosing a problem, the objectives were set. Table I shows
the general objective and the specific objectives set.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we
explain the approach taken to address the work and which
projects arose from class. In Section 3, the results are
explained and divided between each component of the
project. We conclude in Section 4 with a summary of the
work.
TABLE I.
GENERAL AND SPECIFIC OBJETVIES OF THE WORK.
Main
Goal
Determine the extent to which a mechatronic engineer student
can manage to identify the relation between the knowledge of
their profession and the surrounding environment, by carrying
out an AR project associated with the solution of a real-world
problem, proposed by a company or an institution.
Specific
Objec-
tives
1. Apply the RBL approach to develop AR projects
2. Identify the characteristics of an AR from this definition
and its differences with an BR.
3. Design, build and test prototypes of mechatronic products
that solve specific problems in their area of activity.
4. Promote the management of new knowledge not addressed
in classes.
5. Encourage teamwork, so that this leads to the development
of a functional mechatronic product, and to the elaboration of
the descriptive memory that collects all the information
corresponding to its design.
6. Expose the results achieved before a court of professors and
experts.
II. METHODOLOGY
The RBL was developed through an AR in the class of
“Project of mechatronic engineering”, whose essence is
precisely the solution of a real-world problem in a given
context, seeking the implementation or the use of knowledge
received or self-acquired. 13 students participated in this
task, which were grouped into two teams at the beginning of
the semester, and they had the full semester to complete the
project.

Of the three routes suggested in [9], the second one was
chosen, where from a real known problem and an idea-
solution based on a theory, a hypothesis is generated. The
hypothesis triggers a research process based on experiments,
tests and analysis of the results. Each team worked on a
different problem, which is shown in Table II.
Both problems were worked on during the time given.
The students had freedom to find their own solutions, in
order to encourage the development of abilities and skills not
seen in class, helping them to gain knowledge in other areas.
III. PARTIAL RESULTS OBTAINED
From the characterization discussed, the partial results
obtained in the measurement of the temperature of the cattle
are exemplified. Only these results will be explained in detail
for conceptualization purposes.
After defining the method to use for the measurement of
the temperature of the livestock, considering the economic
resources, an approach was determined. The team decided to
develop a prototype with cheap components, in a way in
which it would show the main idea of the whole project.
A. Camera
Research was done in order to choose an accurate
thermographic camera that fulfills the specifications of the
project.
After
a
thorough
investigation,
the
Adafruit
AMG8833 [5] was chosen, although the Flir E6 [6] is a
better option technically, but it is too expensive for this
project.
The AMG8833 camera complies with the needs of the
project, although it has a poor accuracy of -+3ºC, a
maximum reach of 5 meters and a field of view of 60º. Table
III was created to show how different the accuracy of the
AMG8833 is, compared to other types of temperature
sensors. For the camera the maximum measured temperature
was considered. Also, a wet simulation was done in order
account for the situation when an animal becomes wet when
water it is sprayed on it.

The camera works with inter-integrated circuits (I2C)
communication,
which
can
be
connected
to
a
microcontroller. For this case an Arduino was chosen. As the
Adafruit has open libraries for Arduino, it facilitates the use
of
this
device.
The
sensor
sends
an 8x8
matrix of
temperatures, which can be seen in Figure 2, where each
number corresponds to a pixel of a picture.
Figure 2. 8x8 Matrix example.
Although the sensor does not capture an image, only
temperatures, the data was processed on MATLAB to create
an image, which is shown in Figure 3. Due to the small
number of pixels, the array had to be converted into a larger
one. For this, a method called bicubic interpolation was used
to create a 32x32 image and improve the quality.

B. Identification System
The
project
is
supposed
to
be
operating
in
an
establishment where there is a large amount of livestock. For
this reason, an identification system had to be implemented,
in order to identify the cow, in this case, as it gives helpful
information to the carer. For identification, a radio frequency
identification (RFID) RC522 module was used, but other
methods can be used, such as image identification or
magnetic sensor. The RFID module has a reach of approx. 5
cm [7]. Although is a short distance, these types of systems
can be made so that they reach up to 10 meters, which is
enough for projects implemented in the field. These systems
identify pre-programmed
identification
cards
that
pass
through the range of the RFID signal.
C. Mechanism
The location where the project would be placed is in a
barn where livestock is kept. For this reason, the idea of
mounting the camera with the identification system on a
base, which would be held by a movement system involving
a band that moves the system back and forth. It is supported
by 2 rails. In addition to moving back and forth, the base of
the camera can move on the spot 120º to increase the field of
view. A 3D model was designed, as shown in Figure 4,
before
implementing
it
using
specific
materials.
The
materials used to create the prototype were: ABS plastic,
wood, steel bars, toothed band, DC motor, servo motors,
electric components (H bridge, resistors) and copper cable.
The prototype range of motion was under 50 cm.

D. Data system
All the data is saved on a platform where a table of
temperatures
with
their
corresponding
thermographic
images is placed together with the date and time of the
measurement. In this way, the end user can go back to past
records or look into present ones. MATLAB was used to
process the data and save such files into a specific folder in
the computer.
E. Prototype
After consolidating all the parts of the system, the final
prototype was created. An image of the result is shown in
Figure 5.
Figure 5.
Final protype of the temperature acquisition system.
As shown in Figure 5, the prototype was constructed at a
smaller scale, so it can be tested in the classroom. In order to
be tested in a barn, the prototype would need to measure at
least 6 meters in length, to fit in the barn structure. For this
reason, the team decided to first prove the mechanical and
electronic functioning with a smaller size device, as a larger
prototype would have the same principle.
IV. CONLUSION
The objective of this paper was to allow mechatronic
students to relate the acquired knowledge throughout their
career, with an AR project to implement a solution for a real-
world problem. This was reached through the research done
and with the reported results. The RBL approach was applied
throughout an entire university semester as part of the course
entitled “Project of mechatronic engineering”.
Following this RBL approach, solutions were reached as
well as some transversal key competences were developed,
for example, teamwork, written, presentation skills, and
abilities
to
solve
complex
problems.
In
addition
to
developing
competences,
the
project’s
team
gained
knowledge regarding image processing and skills on the use
of software for programming and data management, in this
case were MATLAB and Arduino. The obtained results
allowed the qualitatively evaluation of the students (final
grades between 95 and 100), two rubrics were used to grade
the written proof and the oral presentation.
The project allowed students to link applied investigation
with
the
research-based
learning
method,
achieving
something that most desire, which is to solve problem based
on an industry or company needs through an academic
approach.
We suggest the following recommendations for the
follow-up of the project:
1) Employ project management tools, for example:
Wrike, Asana and Flow, in order to ensure a better control
of the project phases.
2) Apply a survey to the students, where they state what
have they learned, which challenges they have overcome
and what area of opportunity they discovered. In the same
way, apply other survey to the client, where he can express
the level of satisfaction with the problem solution.
3) For the complexity of the problem, the prototype was
constructed at a smaller scale, which is yet to be adapted, so
it can be placed in a barn.
