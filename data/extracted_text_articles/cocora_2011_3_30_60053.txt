 INTRODUCTION 
At the beginning of the mobile Internet age, it becomes 
clear there is a strong need of mobile equipment able to 
maximize its wireless connectivity. 
There are several reasons that make extremely attractive 
the usage of multi-standard radio transceivers to enable the 
wireless interoperation of such mobile equipment. 
First of all, a multi-standard solution is efficient as only 
one design is required to handle the mobile device wireless 
communication. Thus the number of different dedicated ICs 
or IP blocks inside a large SoC is reduced. This simplifies 
the overall communication platform integration. Secondly, 
since only one design is required to cover for the all the 
targeted wireless standards all cost related to the IP 
development and testing are minimized. 
The ideal multi-standard receiver was proposed by 
Mitola in [1]. The Software Defined Radio Receiver (SDRR) 
shown in Fig. 1.a is the optimal choice from system level 
perspective, as it comprises only an ADC. In reality, due to 
practical 
implementation 
constrains, 
a 
multi-standard 
receiver requires a signal conditioning path in between the 
antenna and the ADC. The SDRR concept shown in Fig. 1.b 
relaxes the ADC specifications by ensuring for the wanted 
signal additional selectivity and amplification. 
A possible SDRR implementation is shown in Fig. 1.c, 
[2]. The receiver is based on the direct conversion 
architecture, the optimum choice for a multi-standard 
enactment, [3]. Also, the homodyne receiver is embedding a 
full signal conditioning path. The received signal is 
amplified by the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and then 
downconverted to baseband.

The blockers and interferers are removed by the channel 
selection Low Pass Filter (LPF) and then the Variable Gain 
Amplifier (VGA) boosts the useful signal to optimally load 
the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). 
Through digital control the SDRR blocks main 
characteristics (e. g., bandwidth, noise, and linearity) can be 
changed dynamically depending on the particular standard 
requirements or even on the particular communication burst 
necessities. 
The paper’s main goal is to identify the key electrical 
requirements and their values for a SDRR based on the 
Fig. 1.c concept targeting compatibility to the major 
commercial wireless standards listed in Table I. Based on a 
systematic approach, the paper introduces a standard 
independent methodology for evaluating the SDRR 
performance. 
Section II defines the SDRR receiver sensitivity, NF and 
gain requirements, while Section III analyses the blocker and 
interferers impact on the SDRR linearity requirements. 
Section IV concludes the paper.

One of the most important parameters of a wireless 
receiver is its sensitivity, SRX. The sensitivity is defined as 
the minimum input signal the receiver must be able to 
demodulate within a specified Bit Error Rate (BER).

Thus, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio at the RX output, SNRout, 
has to be above a minimum value SNR0. SNR0 value is set by 
the received useful signal modulation characteristics and it 
incorporates the digital demodulator non-idealities. 
Based on the analysis presented in [9], the SNR0 as a 
function of the BER has been determined for the basic 
modulation schemes. Table I notes the targeted standards 
signal modulation and the corresponding SNR0 values. The 
SNR0 has a negative value for UMTS and WLAN 802-11 
standards, as it accounts the processing gain specific to direct 
sequence spread spectrum systems, [10]. 
The usage of SNR0 facilitates the finding of the multi-
standard receiver key electrical parameters by enabling a 
standard independent approach. 
As each standard specifies a sensitivity level, given the 
useful signal RF bandwidth, BWRF, the receiver NF, NFRX, is 
calculated as:

where N0 = kBT = −174 dBm/Hz represents the noise power 
spectral density at the antenna output for T = 290 °K. 
In practice, an overhead to SNR0 should be considered in 
(1), since the overall receiver SNR is degraded by multiple 
factors, not only by noise (e. g., imperfect impedance 
matching, multipath channel). 
The receiver NF specifications for all the wireless 
standards can be calculated with (1) by accounting the 
specified sensitivity levels from Table I. 
A NF as the one derived by (1) can be obtained at the 
expense of larger power consumption of thy receiver. 
 
In order to maximize the link budget, most commercially 
available dedicated receivers push their sensitivity level 
towards smaller and smaller values by decreasing NFRX. 
Hence, a true re-configurable multi-standard solution 
must embed a receiver with a small NF (typically < 3 dB) in 
order to be able to achieve a low enough sensitivity for all 
the targeted standards. Table I also comprises the required 
sensitivity levels, assuming NFRX = 3 dB, for all the 
envisaged wireless standards. 
B. Maximum gain requirements 
In general, the receiver signal conditioning path gain is 
constraint by the received signal strength. 
Any wireless receiver with an analog signal conditioning 
path embeds at least one variable gain block (for example 
VGA in Fig. 1.c). Thus, for each communication burst an 
Automated Gain Control loop (AGC) measures the Receiver 
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and changes the receiver 
gain accordingly, in order to avoid the ADC overloading and 
to optimally load it. 
The receiver maximum gain requirements are constraint 
by the ADC full scale level, FSADC, and the specified 
receiver sensitivity. 
In order to optimally load the ADC, the receiver signal 
conditioning path maximum gain, GRX, is given by:

For a multi-standard receiver embedding analog signal 
conditioning (see Fig. 1.c), k is set by the Variable Gain 
Amplifier (VGA) gain step (e. g., 6 dB, [11]). Equation (2) 
assumes all interferes and blockers have been totally filtered 
out before the ADC. This corresponds to the case of 
complete analog channel selection. 
Table II presents the receiver signal conditioning path 
maximum gain requirement for all the envisaged standards 
calculated based on equation (2) for a 1 V FS ADC and for a 
receiver matched to 100 Ω with k = 0.9; the NFRX of the 
receiver was assumed to be 3 dB. For direct sequence spread 
spectrum systems (e. g., WLAN 802.11b) the gain 
requirement is smaller, as in practice other signals will be 
present as well inside the received bandwidth. 
Nonetheless, we can conclude, based on Table II data, 
that the low sensitivity levels of the targeted wireless 
standards require a large maximum gain for the multi-
standard receiver. 
III. 
BLOCKERS AND INTERFERERS IMPACT ON THE 
MULTI-STANDARD RECEIVER CHARACTERISTICS 
Besides the useful signal, other interferers and blockers 
can be present at the antenna input. The list comprising all 
interferes and blockers under which influence the receiver 
must still be able to properly demodulate the wanted signal 
represents the receiver blocker diagram. For each wireless 
standard such a receiver blocker diagram is specified. 
Based on the targeted standards blockers diagrams 
analysis it results there are two major issues due to blockers 
and interferes: 
 
the receiver output clipping, due to the large receiver 
gain requirements and to the large difference between the 
useful signal and the blocker levels (i. e., typically > 
+40 dBc); 
 
intermodulation distortions that fall in-band, due to the 
receiver not perfectly linear transfer characteristic. 
The receiver output clipping can be handled by making 
the LNA and VGA blocks gain variable. Through  
On the other hand intermodulation distortions are un-
wanted products that potentially fall in-band and cannot be 
disseminated from the useful signal. Thus the wanted signal 
demodulation is affected due to the SNDR degradation. 
Further on the analysis presented in this Section focuses on 
finding the values for the Figures of Merit (FOMs) used in 
evaluating the radio receiver linearity performance: the IIP2 
and IIP3. 
A. Finding the SDR IIP2 
While receiving the RF input power may change 
significantly because of the reception of unwanted 
blockers/interferers. Due to the receiver even order 
distortions, the received signal DC offset component will 
change. This dynamic offset effect upsets the received signal 
demodulation, especially if the envisaged modulation 
concentrates a large part of the symbol spectral power at low 
frequencies. This is the case for older standards like GSM, as 
the latest wireless standards use modulation schemes that do 
not carry information at low frequencies. 
The figure of merit quantizing the analog front-end 
second order distortions is the second order intercept point, 
IP2. The SDRR input referred IP2, IIP2RX, is given by, [12]:

where Pblocker is the blocker level and Pin is the wanted signal 
level. 
Based on the targeted standards analysis, it results the 
worst case scenario is met for the GSM standard that requires 
IIP2RX = +46 dBm, [2]. 
B. Finding the SDR IIP3 
For most wireless receivers, given the fully differential 
circuit implementation, the dominant non-linear contribution 
comes from the third order coefficient of power series 
expansion of their transfer characteristic. The maximum in-
band level of the third-order intermodulation product, PIM3, 
must be smaller than the useful RF signal level with SNR0: 




In practice, a supplementary head room to SNR0 should 
be considered, since the overall receiver SNR is degraded by 
multiple factors, not only by the down-converted spurs. 
Given (4), the receiver IIP3, IIP3RX, must meet the 
condition specified by the equation:

where Pinterferer is the power per interferer of two interferers 
that cause the in-band third order distortion. 
A special case is represented by OFDM Signals. An 
OFDM signal comprises frequency orthogonal sub-carriers, 
[9]. Receiver non-linearity leads to formation of bogus 
signals in-band due to sub-carrier intermodulation. The 
figure of merit in evaluating the third order intermodulation 
products thus formed is the Composite Triple Beat (CTB). 
As is pointed out in [13] the worst case for the CTB 
products level is found in the centre band of the OFDM 
signal spectrum:

Each wireless standard specifies a set of particular 
intermodulation conditions. Table III summarises the power 
per interferer of two interferers that cause the in-band 
distortion and the input signal power. By analysing all the 
targeted standards, the receiver IIP3 specifications were 
derived using (5) or (9) and noted in Table III. The large 
variations in the IIP3 requirements are a reflection of the 
extreme reception conditions specific to the wireless 
environment. In [12] it is shown a versatile receiver is able 
to mitigate all presented scenarios, by adjusted dynamically 
its linearity and noise performance with the received power.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper conducted an analysis for finding the main 
requirements for a SDRR targeting compatibility with the 
major commercial wireless standards (see Table I).  
Thanks to the standard independent systematic approach 
the presented analysis found the values for the key SDRR 
electrical specifications (i. e., NFRX, IIP2RX and IIP3RX) that 
ensure its compatibility with the envisaged standards. 
Of course, a true SDRR has to be versatile and robust, 
such as it can adjust dynamically its performance (e. g., 
NFRX, IIP3RX) depending on the communication burst 
particularities. Nonetheless if a SDRR targets compatibility 
with the standards from Table I, it must meet the electrical 
specifications determined in this analysis.  
So, the presented analysis constitutes the starting point in 
building the SDRR. Further on, the SDRR electrical 
specifications must be partitioned over its building blocks. 
The optimal specification partitioning must account the 
limitations due to the physical implementation (i. e., CMOS 
process) for each of the SDRR building blocks.
