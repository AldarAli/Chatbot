Abstract – Cochlear implants are used by deaf people to recover 
partial hearing. The electrode array inserted inside the cochlea is an 
extensive area of research. The aim of the electrodes array is to 
directly stimulate the nerve fibers inside the Organ of Corti. The 
electrical model of the physical system consisting of  Organ of Corti 
and the electrodes is presented in this paper. This model allowed to 
run SPICE simulations in order to theoretically detect the minimal 
voltage sufficient for nerve fiber stimulation as well as the impact of 
the electrode voltage on the duration of  nerve fibers stimulation. 
Besides, to ensure functional sound perception, the electrode 
potential should depend on their position inside the cochlea. A 
afferent nerve fiber repartition map over the cochlea position, 
considering the frequency sensitivity of the different parts of the ear 
was created. This projection allowed to propose a theoretical 
electrodes potential correction based on their cochlea position.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Cochlear implants are an electrical device used by severely 
deaf people to gain or recover partial audition. They allow direct 
stimulation of  the auditory fibers using an electrodes array 
designed to reproduce the stimulus that would be generated by a 
healthy cochlea.  
To do so, an external part of the hearing devices is located 
outside the ear and contains a microphone that captures the 
acoustic waves and transforms them into an electrical signal used 
by the data processing unit. Then, this signal is transmitted to the 
receiver, located within the patient’s head, close the skull. The 
receiver is composed of a demodulator and a set of electrodes 
driven by electrical signals that will contract the cochlea and 
stimulate the auditory nerve [1], [2], [3]. 
Cochlear implants directly stimulate the nerve fibers inside 
the cochlea, and requires surgery to pull the electrodes array 
inside the scala tympani (Figure 1). 
The connection between the electrodes in the scala tympani 
and the auditory nerve fibers is critical for efficient nerve fibers 
stimulation.  
In an healthy ear, when a sound wave is produced, it strikes 
the eardrum and this vibration is reported in the oval window 
using ossicles. The oval window is the very first part of the 
cochlea. This oval window vibration creates a wave propagating 
inside the scala vestibuli, which is filled with perilymph. 
Figure 1. Cochlear implant device [3] 
 
According to biophysical theories [4], [5] when a mechanical 
wave propagates inside the cochlea, the Basilar Membrane (BM) 
distorts to absorb the wave energy, resulting in a height variation 
of the BM, which compresses the organ of Corti. As shown in 
Figure 2, the organ of Corti is composed of Hair Cells (HC) 
(Outer Hair Cells (OHC) and Inner Hair Cells (IHC)), which 
have stereocilia at their end. When BM vibrates, stereocilia 
position change allowing potassium channels to open [6, 7]. 
Opening of the potassium channels creates the depolarization of 
the HC allowing complex mechanisms to take place (reviewed in 
[8], [9], [10]), and finally, resulting in neurotransmitter released 
in the synapse. Once released, these neurotransmitters travel to 
the post synaptic cell (the nerve fiber) and creates the 
depolarization of the nerve fiber. This depolarization, if 
sufficiently important, generates an Action Potential (AP) 
running through the nerve cell membrane [11], [12]. 
The aim of the electrodes array of the cochlear implant is to 
generate an AP once a sound is perceived.

Consequently, to obtain the same Action Potential at the 
nerve fiber using only electrode stimulation, two possibilities 
exist. First the direct nerve fiber stimulation can be made by 
changing the nerve membrane potential in order to produce a 
membrane depolarization above the threshold of Voltage 
Sensitive Na+ Channels (Nav) to create an AP [13]. The second 
solution consists in opening the potassium channels of the 
stereocilia to recreate the complete stimulation process. As HC or 
stereocilia are disfunctionning in the vast majority of implanted 
patients, only the first mechanism is considered in this paper.  
Electrical model of electrodes inserted within the cochlea 
have been proposed by Hartmann et al. [14], where the spatial 
distribution of electrical potential was measured for intracochlear 
stimulation.    In addition, electronic model of electrode/neuron 
coupling is available in [15] in order to reveal the most efficient 
coupling conditions. However, both models lack of physical 
connection with AP generation. In this paper, we present an 
electrical description of the electrode and organ of Corti in order 
to obtain theoretical minimal stimulation voltage sent to the 
electrodes for AP generation. Furthermore, this model allowed us  
to link the stimulation voltage with the duration of the nerve 
fibers stimulation. Then the impact of surrounding electrodes 
were theoretically investigated. 
The next section presents the theoretical model developed for 
the Organ of Corti associated with the electrodes. Thereafter, 
simulation results from SPICE software are presented.  
The threshold of hearing [16] describes the minimum power 
of the acoustic vibration required to perceive a sound related to 
the sound frequency. This relation is not linear for mammals, 
indicating that various physical properties of the ear ensure this 
frequency selectivity. As the Central Nervous System (CNS) 
interprets the message sent by the afferent nerve fibers, this 
frequency selection has to be recreated in cochlear implants 
where the afferent nerve fibers are directly stimulated. In that 
intent, we used two topographic maps of the cochlea: one 
describing the repartition of the afferent nerve fibers (also called 
Spiral Ganglion Cells (SGC) (cf Section V)) over their place 
inside the cochlea and another one describing the same 
repartition but weighted by a threshold of hearing related 
function. By comparing the number of afferent nerve cells 
stimulated in both maps, we defined corrective coefficients. 
These coefficients were used to correct the potential sent to the 
electrodes and may permit better sound reconstruction by the 
brain. 
Finally, the conclusion and future work direction are  
presented.

ORGAN OF CORTI ELECTRICAL ANALOG 
 
The electrical equivalent circuit of human tissue used in this 
paper is the one presented in Figure 3 and extracted from Cole 
and Cole impedance model [17], which has been shown to fit 
experimental data. The human tissues considered were the one 
present in Figure 2. The value of Rs, Rp , Ch and Cp were obtained 
using a gain response extraction over frequencies analysis.  
The electrical analog model is based on the impedance 
response over frequencies. Rs and Ch model the tissue impedance 
at low frequencies. As the maximum hearing frequency is 22khz, 
it was considered in this paper that Rp and Cp could be neglected 
as their model the energy loss and tissue response in high 
frequencies. 
 
Figure 3. Human tissue electrical analog [17] 
 
To obtain the numerical values for Rs and Ch for all the 
tissues or interfaces, we use the physical equations for the 
capacitance (parallel-plate capacitor) and for the resistance 
computation (cylindrical resistance model) [18], [19]. 
The values of the relative permeability and electrical 
conductivity for the nerves were extracted from [20] or from [21] 
for platinum as electrodes are mainly composed of it. However as 
far as the authors know, no relative permeability or electrical 
conductivity was available for Deiter cells or Basilar Membrane 
tissue. As Deiter cells are mainly composed of microtubules [22], 
which are involved in mechanical transport as actin proteins 
found in muscles cells and because the width of the BM is 
negligible compared to the Deiter cell height, we chose to take 
the relative permeability and electrical conductivity of muscle 
cells to characterize those two tissues.

On the other hand, the computation of the capacitance and the 
resistances (Cpatch, Rppatch, Rspatch ) between two electrodes is 
more complex, as highlighted Figure 4, those variables depend on 
the distance between the two electrodes. The Cable Model 
Theory was used to compute those variables as the space between 
two electrodes is composed of various tissues rendering the Cole 
and Cole model implementation difficult. We simplified the 
tissue between two electrodes as only made of Deiter cells, then 
we implemented the Cable Model Theory in order to obtain a 
general impedance depending on the electrodes distance.  
To compute Rspatch, the cylindrical model of resistance was 
considered. The cylinder going from the first electrode to the 
second electrode, as defined in Figure 5.a, was used to compute 
Rspatch (expressed in (1)):

one electrode and the corresponding nerve fibers. Those values 
were respectively extracted from [23] and [24]. y is the variable 
shown in Figures 5.a, 5.b and 5.c.  
Rppatch models the resistance between the two longitudinal edges 
of the cylinder defined previously. Hence, this computation 
changes as expressed in (2), as it models all the losses through 
the ground from one electrode to another one.

The electrical description containing only a single electrode is 
shown Figure 6.a. The input voltage generator is directly 
connected to the electrodes analog model (low frequencies 
model), which can be eventually considered as a perfect 
conductor compared to the other resistance values. Then the 
current can flow to the nerve cell or can go back to the ground. 
The current loss through the physical isolation between the 
electrode and the ground is neglected as the insulator has a low 
loss tangent (high resistivity). The membrane rest potential of a 
nerve cell is around -70mV, explaining the two -70mV voltage 
generators, in Figure 6.a. We defined the analog equivalent 
circuit of a nerve cell using a resistance (Rn) in parallel with a 
capacitor (Cn) (this electrical description should not be confused 
with the Hodgkin-Huxley model [25], which is used to model 
ions flow through the nerve cell membrane and not the electron 
flow). 
In addition, the electrical description of the system starting 
from the nerve and going through all the body to the earth was 
not considered because very little electrical current is going 
through this pathway.

The interspike time was taken randomly and greatly depends on 
the amplitude of the stimulus [26]. However, the electrical analog 
presented in this paper does not account for this effect.

We performed also a parametric simulation using the 
electrical description of Figure 6.b, where the surrounding 
electrodes are added. The central electrode had a DC voltage of 
1V and we varied the voltage of the surrounding electrodes 
between 0.9 and 5V. According to resistances and capacitances 
values used in Figure 6.b, analytical computation showed that 
when the voltage of the surrounding electrodes was maximum 
(5V), the nerve  fibers (above the central electrode) membrane 
potential Vm variation was 0.5mV, which was not high enough 
to stimulate these nerve fibers (the ones that should be stimulated 
only by the central electrode). 
The overall system consumption is a great significance as 
cochlear implants are not convenient for the user to recharge. The 
study of the power consumption is presented Figure 9. 
 
 
Figure 9. Current consumption during one stimulation period 
 
The current peaks during each input signal transitions could reach 
1A. Consequently, the maximum power consumed during a 
square input signal generation by the electrodes was around 1W 
(peak value), whereas the mean power consumed per period was 
around 50mW. These results may be used for the electrode array 
design to define battery size as well as electrode minimum width. 
 
IV. 
NERVE REPARTITION MAP 
 
The biomechanical most widespread theory of BM vibration 
is the Traveling Wave theory: following acoustic vibrations, the 
BM is excited and vibrates at a particular place inside the 
cochlea. This place depends on the sound wave frequency as well 
as sound amplitude [27], [28]. Cochlear implants aim to recreate 
the neural stimuli of an healthy cochlea using an wired electrodes 
array inserted inside the scala tympani, close to the BM. As each 
electrode is at a fixed place inside the cochlea, electrode 
stimulation will excite only a limited region of the cochlea which 
will be further interpreted in the brain as a sound of a certain 
frequency as indicated in Figure 10. Consequently, sound 
division into single frequency (using the Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) algorithm for instance) is necessary to select the right 
electrode to activate which then stimulates its surrounding nerve 
fibers. 
In order to only select the nerve fibers associated with the 
resonating IHC, we created an afferent nerve fiber map of the 
cochlea including the frequency selective mechanisms of the ear.

V. 
SPIRAL GANGLIONS 
 
There are between 30000 to 40000 nerve fibers in the cochlea of 
a normal adult [29]. Three types of nerve fibers innervate the 
cochlea: autonomic, which are  associated with blood vessel and 
other physiological functions, afferent (conducting information 
from the cochlea to the brain) and efferent (conducting 
information from the brain to the cochlea, especially to the Outer 
Hair Cells). Afferent nerve fibers are produced by Spiral 
Ganglions Cells (SGC) [30]. Spiral ganglions are synaptically 
connected to the IHC and OHC as indicated in Figure 11. 
Type I SGC represent 95% of the SGC and each one connects 
to a single IHC whereas a single IHC is connected to 10-20 type I 
SGC [30].There are around 15 nerve fibers per IHC in the lower 
second turn of the cochlea and this number changes from the base

to the apex, most probably slightly contributing the cochlea 
sensitivity toward certain frequencies [31], [32
Type II spiral ganglions are smaller and unmyelinated and 
mostly connect OHC.  
It may be deduced that IHC are surrounded by almost all the 
afferent nerve fibers, therefore, they are thought to function 
primarily as sensory receptors [34]. OHC otherwise are more 
connected with motor properties of the stereocilia 
permit an higher accuracy in sound perception.
 In [36], the spiral ganglions repartition over the cochlea 
distance from the base is presented for cats. We assumed that the 
spiral ganglions cochlea distribution for other terrestrial mammal 
species was similar [37], [38] (this assumption may be used as 
first approximation).

As type II SGC function in hearing sensation has been partially 
understood and because their number is limited compared to type 
I SGC number, we neglected type II SGC, and supposed in this 
model that: 
• 
the total SGC number and repartition was entirely 
defined by type I SGC.  
• 
the total afferent nerve cell number and repartition 
inside the cochlea was therefore similar to type I SGC 
number and repartition.

contributes to frequency sensitivity in mammalian hearing,

human ear is composed of the outer ear, the medium ear and the 
inner ear (where BM makes the Organ of Corti oscillates) [41].

The cochlea sensitivity toward certain frequencies may be 
further affected by other physiological factors, such as different 
afferent nerve fibers repartition and stimulation, depending on the 
position on the cochlea. Several mechanisms have been proposed 
such as: 
• 
IHCs frequency response (similar to a low pass filter 
with a resonating pulse around 10KHz) 
IHCs frequency response may

To the authors personal interpretation the frequency select
the cochlea is greatly linked to biophysics of the cochlea, to IHCs 
potential change and repartition and ear/middle ear resonance 
rather than nerve fiber topography (as it failed to explain the 
amplification peak in the 3-4KHz range 
 
VII. 
AFFERENT NERVE FIBERS REPARTIT
As indicated in [29], the number of afferent nerve fibers in the 
cochlea is around 40000 and their effective stimulation is 
depending on the sound wave frequency. We hence decided 
create an afferent nerve repartition map already including all the 
physical or anatomical mechanisms presented in Section 
we called Afferent Nerve Fibers Repartition Map Including Ear 
Frequency Selection Mechanisms or MEFFRINAM map), in 
order to roughly define the number of afferent nerve fibers 
affected by a sound wave. This map presents great interest for 
cochlear implants application as the electrodes array are directly 
stimulating these nerve fibers  and the outer/middle ear 
resonance, the BM variations depending on wave frequencies, the

cochlear implants, making the use of this map fundamental to 
recreate a realistic hearing.  
To develop this topographic map we took first the reverse 
function of the human hearing threshold over 
get the human ear sensitivity toward the frequencies. 
By making this function linear (R(f)) and then reversing it 
(IR(f)), it allowed us to estimate the cochlea sensitivity toward 
frequency. Transforming the I
density function (PIR(f)) and  multiplying it with the total number 
of afferent nerves in the cochlea (Nb

when stimulated by a mechanical wave,

(distance from the base). 
The cochlea sensitivity toward certain frequencies may be 
further affected by other physiological factors, such as different

position on the cochlea. Several mechanisms have been proposed 
IHCs frequency response (similar to a low pass filter 
with a resonating pulse around 10KHz) [47], [48]. The 
IHCs frequency response may result from different 
IHCs length inside the cochlea or to their stereocilia and 
cellular mechanical properties. Furthermore, gradient of

spiral ganglions repartition is related to 
the frequency of the sound wave but fails to explain the 
4KHz frequency peak (cf spiral ganglions frequency 
, presented in Figure 13) [36], [46] 
To the authors personal interpretation the frequency selectivity of 
the cochlea is greatly linked to biophysics of the cochlea, to IHCs 
potential change and repartition and ear/middle ear resonance 
rather than nerve fiber topography (as it failed to explain the 
4KHz range [46]). 
ERVE FIBERS REPARTITION INSIDE THE 
COCHLEA 
 
the number of afferent nerve fibers in the 
cochlea is around 40000 and their effective stimulation is 
depending on the sound wave frequency. We hence decided to 
create an afferent nerve repartition map already including all the 
physical or anatomical mechanisms presented in Section V (that 
we called Afferent Nerve Fibers Repartition Map Including Ear 
Frequency Selection Mechanisms or MEFFRINAM map), in 
roughly define the number of afferent nerve fibers 
affected by a sound wave. This map presents great interest for 
cochlear implants application as the electrodes array are directly 
stimulating these nerve fibers  and the outer/middle ear 
variations depending on wave frequencies, the 
of Corti selective mechanisms, etc. are bypassed in 
cochlear implants, making the use of this map fundamental to 
To develop this topographic map we took first the reverse 
unction of the human hearing threshold over frequencies [16] to 
get the human ear sensitivity toward the frequencies.  
By making this function linear (R(f)) and then reversing it 
(f)), it allowed us to estimate the cochlea sensitivity toward 
Transforming the IR(f) function into a probability 
(f)) and  multiplying it with the total number 
of afferent nerves in the cochlea (Nbafferentnerves) resulted in the 
Afferent Nerve Fibers Repartition Map Including Ear Frequency 
Selection Mechanisms (MEFFRINAM map) of the cochlea as

VIII. 
BENEFITS OF THE CREATED TOPOGRAPHIC MAP FOR 
COCHLEAR IMPLANTS 
 
In severely deaf people the use of cochlear implants helps to 
partially recover the hearing function. In implanted patients the 
afferent nerve fibers stimulation is directly done through 
electrodes and does not require the Organ of Corti as explained in 
Section I. By remembering that we made the approximation that 
the afferent nerve fibers were equivalent to the SGC, the afferent 
nerve fibers selected by the electrodes is given by the spiral 
ganglions repartition map. 
We use CI422 device characteristics with an insertion depth 
of 20-25mm, a mean diameter of the electrodes around 0.35mm 
and a spacing between the electrodes around 0.45mm. As 
explained in [23] the number of nerve fibers stimulated by an 
electrode is a function of the power magnitude as well as the 
proximity of the electrodes with the SGC.  
We supposed that the electrodes are very close to the SGC, 
resulting in a window type selection (very accurate) of the 
afferent nerve fibers. In practice, this may be inexact as the 
insertion of the electrode array inside the scala tympani is 
difficult and usually result in spacing between the electrodes 
array and the Spiral ganglions [51] .In consequence, in practice, 
the nerve fibers selection mathematical description is closer to a 
Gaussian function. 
 
 
Figure 14. Packet of afferent nerve fibers selected by the electrodes of the 
cochlear implants 
 
From Figures 13 and 14, it can be easily deduced that the 
cochlear implant electrodes do not provide the required 
amplification in the 2KHz – 6KHz frequency range as Cochlear 
amplification is not done. Algorithmic correction by modifying 
the energy sent to the electrodes may be  used to correct this 
defective amplification. This algorithmic correction should be 
based on the human hearing threshold or similarly on the 
equivalent afferent nerve fibers stimulated map, which takes into 
consideration the amplification mechanisms of an healthy 
cochlea. 
Using the mathematical logarithmic spiral representation 
presented in [52], the spatial representation of the cochlea can be 
performed. The mathematical equation in the cited document 
describes a flat spiral disagreeing with a real cochlea, however 
we may use the z direction to plot information such as the nerve 
fiber topographic map or those nerve fibers selected by the 
electrodes array, as indicated in Figures 15 and 16.

AMPLIFICATION COEFFICIENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS COMPARISON 
 
Cochlear implant electrodes should hence be multiplied by a 
scalar coefficient to correctly model the frequency sensitivity of 
the ear. This correction is compulsory as the Central Nervous 
System interprets neuronal signals already amplified in some 
particular frequencies. If the frequency amplitude dependence is 
not reproduced in cochlear implants it may result in inability to 
correctly hear certain frequencies (especially in the 3-4KHz 
band), ultimately resulting in sound distortion. Comparison 
between the MEFFRIMAM map and the Spiral Ganglions 
topographic map selected by the cochlear implants is exposed in 
Figure 17.  
To correctly model the frequency response of an healthy ear, 
each electrode should be multiplied with the coefficient indicated 
in Figure 18. We further supposed that the number of nerve fibers 
stimulated is linearly increasing with the amplitude of the 
electrode. This may be inaccurate for high voltage stimulus or 
very low voltage stimulus due to saturation mechanisms [53], 
[54], [55]. 
 
Figure 17. Comparison between the Spiral Ganglions stimulated by the electrodes 
and the  created MEFFRIMAM map 
 
To compute this average coefficient a simple division was 
performed between the afferent nerve fibers number in the 
MEFFRIMAM map and the afferent nerve fibers number defined 
by the spiral ganglions map for the same position inside the 
cochlea. The average value of this coefficient was retained for 
each electrode.  
The multiplication of these coefficients with the voltage value 
that must be sent at an electrode to stimulate an afferent nerve 
fiber response (defined in Section III) could be done in the 
processing unit of the cochlear implant. Furthermore, coefficients 
amplitude tuning tests performed in deaf people using cochlear 
implants for each electrode may add precision in the hearing 
response of these patients.

CONCLUSION 
 
The theoretical electrical description presented in this paper 
was used to carry out simulations allowing the detection of the 
minimum voltage needed to ensure nerve fibers stimulation. This 
voltage was found around 0.9 V. Furthermore, the current peaks 
during each input signal transitions could reach 1A (peak value),  
and the mean power consumed per period was around 50mW. 
These results may be used as requirements for the electrode array 
design and corresponding control electronics. 
It has also been suggested that two consecutive electrodes 
were not disturbing one another and that the duration of the 
stimulation did not depend on the input electrode voltage. A more 
complex model, including the spike trains frequency (which is

the number of spikes generated per second) related to the 
electrode input voltage is being currently developed. 
Furthermore, using the threshold of hearing function, we 
created a topographic map of afferent nerve fibers repartition 
inside the cochlea weighted by the frequency selectivity of an 
healthy ear. This map may be of great value to decrease sound 
distortion in cochlear implants. Corrective coefficients were 
defined for each electrodes in order to allow electrode potential 
fine tuning based on the biophysical properties of the ear. 
Besides physical tests are ongoing to ensure that the 
theoretical results obtained match the measurements. Deaf people 
using cochlear implants were asked to kindly submit themselves 
to cochlear implant reprogramming in order to test if the 
threshold of 0.9 V was sufficient; if not, it would greatly affect 
the perturbation between electrodes. We are also currently 
implementing the electrode potential correction algorithm in a 
portative platform in order to estimate its power consumption and 
facilitate its integration in cochlear implant device.
