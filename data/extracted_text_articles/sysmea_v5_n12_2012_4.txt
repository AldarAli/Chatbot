Abstract—The inverse scattering problem of a quantum star
graph is shown to be solvable as a diagonalization problem
of Hermitian unitary matrix when the connection condition is
given by scale invariant Fulop-Tsutsui form. This enables the
construction of quantum graphs with desired properties. The
quantum vertices with uniform and reﬂectionless scatterings are
examined, and their ﬁnite graph approximations are constructed.
It is shown that a controllable spectral ﬁlter can be constructed
from a certain reﬂectionless graph with the application of
external potential on a line.

I. INTRODUCTION
The inverse scattering is one of the most intriguing problems
in quantum mechanics. The inverse scattering problem of
quantum graph [1], [2], [3], [4], in particular, has two aspects.
Because the quantum graph is a nontrivial solvable system
[5], it presents a challenge for extending the range of solvable
inverse scattering problems. It is also increasingly becoming
important as the design principle of single electron devices
based on nanoscale quantum wires.
In this article, we consider the inverse scattering problem on
a star graph with Fulop-Tsutsui vertices [6], the scale invariant
subset of most general vertex couplings [7]. A star graph is
the elementary building block of generic graph having many
half-lines connected together at a single point, the singular
vertex. The scattering matrix of star graph with Fulop-Tsutsui
condition is energy independent. We exploit this simplicity to
give the full answer to its inverse scattering problem in the
form of diagonalization problem of Hermitian unitary matrix.
Two special examples of inverse scattering problems, that of
reﬂectionless transmission, and of equal-scattering including
the reﬂection, are examined in detail. Very interesting designs
involving Diophantine numbers emerge for the realization of
quantum device with such properties. Since any singular vertex
is effectively reduced to Fulop-Tsutsui vertex in both high and
low energy limits [8], our study hopefully opens up a door
for the full study of inverse scattering problems for general
singular vertex.
The quantum graph has to be controllable by external ﬁeld
of macroscopic scale, if it is to be useful as a quantum device.
We formulate scattering problems on a quantum graph with
constant potentials with differing strengths applied to graph
lines. The formalism is applied to analyze several models of
quantum graphs with external potential on a line. The existence
of threshold resonance phenomenon is pointed out, and it is
shown to be useful in designing controllable spectral ﬁltering
devices. Speciﬁcally, a controllable band ﬁlter with ﬂat spectral
response is constructed from a n = 4 reﬂectionless quantum
graph.
This article is organized as follows: In the second section,
we formulate the inverse scattering problem of scale invariant
graph vertices in terms of matrix diagonalization. In the
third section, a scheme to approximate the vertex with small
structures made up of δ-vertices is developed. In the fourth
section, the scheme is applied to obtain reﬂectionless and
equitransmitting quantum graphs. The accuracy of the approxi-
mating procedure is also examined in the same section. In the
ﬁfth section, with the application of the quantum graphs as
controllable quantum devices in mind, the scattering formalism
is extended to handle the added external potentials on the lines.
In the sixth section, we take a look at the threshold resonance
phenomenon which is found in the quantum graph with a line
subjected to the added potential. In the seventh section, we
examine a n = 4 reﬂectionless graph with a positive external
potential on a line, and point out its utility as band spectral
ﬁlter. The paper ends with the concluding eighth section.
II. INVERSE SCATTERING AS DIAGONALIZATION
The quantum graph is a system made up of interconnected
one-dimensional lines on which a quantum particle moves
around. The simplest nontrivial quantum graph is a star-shaped
graph with a single node. This “elementary particle of quantum
graph” is also referred to as singular quantum vertex. We
start by considering a singular quantum vertex of degree n,
having n half-lines comming out of a point-like node (Fig. 1).
The quantum particle moving on i-th line is described by the
wave function ψi(xi) which satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation,
which, after proper rescaling of the units, read
− d2
dx2
i
ψi(xi) = k2ψi(xi)
(i = 1, ..., n).
(1)
The coordinates xi on the i-th line are labeled outwardly from
the singular vertex, which is assigned the value xi = 0 for all
i. The speciﬁcation of the connection condition at the node

in which ψ′

on i-th line. The current conservation at the node can be
expressed as
Ψ†Ψ′ − Ψ′†Ψ = 0.

It is hown in [7] that this condition can be rephrased as
AΨ + BΨ = 0.

with two n × n matrices A and B, which satisfy
A†B = B†A,
rank(A, B) = n.
(5)
It is shown in [9] that this most general connection condition
is characterized by a complex matrix T of size (n − m) × m
where m can take the integer value m = 1, 2, ..., n − 1, and
is given by

where I(l) signiﬁes the identity matrix of size l×l. To achieve
the from (7), we may have to suitably renumber lines, in
general.
The particle coming in from the j-th line and scattered off
the singular vertex is described by the scattering wave function
on the i-th line, ψ(j)
i (x) which is given in the form
ψ(j)
i (x) = e−ikx + Sjjeikx

Consider matrices M = {ψij(0)} and M ′ = {ψ′
ij(0)}. They
are given, in terms of S by
M = I(n) + S,
M ′ = ik(−I(n) + S),

Since each column of M and M ′ satisﬁes the equation (7),
we have

the matrix V deﬁned by

where R is the matrix whose elements are made from absolute
values of matrix elements of Q, i.e.
R = {rij} = {|Qij|}.

The matrix J(n) is of size n × n with all elements given by

These ﬁne tunings of length and strength are necessary to
counter the generic opaqueness brought in with every addition

where the obvious notations Fij =

ril are adopted. Note that the equation (33) is exact
and does not involve any approximation. In the short range
limit d → 0, we have Fij = 1 + O(d2) and Gij = 1 + O(d2).
We can then show, with a straightforward calculation in the
manner of [9], that the limit d → 0 gives the desired
connection condition for Fulop-Tsutsui vertex (7).
IV. REFLECTIONLESS AND EQUISCATTERING GRAPHS
With the solution of the inverse scattering fully formulated,
it is now possible to ﬁnd a Fulop-Tsutsui vertex from a
given scattering matrix with speciﬁc requirement. Our previous
results detailed in [12] showing the reconstruction of “Free-
like” scattering is one such example, and could have been
achieved easier with current method. We now ask whether
there is fully reﬂectionless graph whose scattering matrix
has only zeros for its diagonal elements, Sii = 0. Vertices
yielding such scattering matrix is known to be useful in
developing semiclasical theory of quantum spectra [13]. If we

limit ourselves to real S, it becomes symmetric matrix with
Sij = Sji.
We note a useful relation concerning the trace of the
scattering matrix. Taking the trace of (17) and utilizing
tr(AB) = tr(BA), we have
tr S = tr Zm = 2m − n.
(34)
Since S for reﬂectionless scattering is traceless, we can have
such scattering only for n = 2m.
Our ﬁrst example is with n = 4 whose S is given by
S =

such matrix exists for n = 4, and given by

We now take a look at the convergence of the ﬁnite size
graph approximation by numerical calculations. In Figure
3, we display the scattering matrix of the ﬁnite graph that
is constructed to approximate equal-scattering reﬂectionless
matrix, (41). These are calculated directly from (33). The value
of the wave length k is in the unit of 1/d. The convergence
can be seen as quite good below kd ≲ 0.2. Numerical analysis
of other examples of different graphs give essentially the
same conclusion that the construction does represent physical
realization of singular Fulop-Tsutsui vertex.
V. SCATTERING MATRIX FOR GRAPH WITH POTENTIALS
We are interested in controlling the scattering properties of
a quantum star graph with n lines through the addition of
potentials on the lines. Suppose that constant potential Ui is
applied to the i-th line. The Schr¨odinger equation now reads
− d2
dx2
i
ψi(xi) = (k2 − Ui)ψi(xi)
(i = 1, ..., n).
(50)
Suppose a quantum particle with mechanical energy E comes
in the vertex from the j-th line, and scattered into all the lines
through the vertex. The i-th component of the wave function
is given by
ψ(j)
i (x) = e−ikix + Sjjeikix
(i = j)
=
r
kj
ki
Sijeikix
(i ̸= j),
(51)
where kℓ is the local momentum on the ℓ-th line, deﬁned by
kℓ =
p
E − Uℓ,
(52)
where Uℓ is the potential on the ℓ-th line. The coefﬁcients
p
kj/ki is there to impose proper normalization to guarantee
that the ﬂux conservation is given by Ψ†Ψ′ − Ψ′†Ψ = 0 as
before. The scattering matrix S = {Sij} now depends, besides
the internal properties of the vertex, on E and U1, U2, . . . , Un.

M ′ = iK2(−I(n) + K−1SK),
(53)
where the matrix K is deﬁned by its elements
Kij =

kiδij.
(54)
The boundary condition AM + BM ′ = 0, together with (53)
leads to [14]
S = −(AK−1 + iBK)−1(AK−1 − iBK) ,
(55)
which is the desired equation.

the physical Riemann surface at the cut that runs between

VII. FLUX CONTROL AND QUANTUM SLUICE-GATE
Let us consider an n = 4 star graph, in search of another
model of the quantum device, which is schematically illus-
trated in Fig. 8. The roles of individual lines are identiﬁed as
follows:
• Line 1 is the input. Particles of various energies are
coming in the vertex along this line.
• Line 2 is the output. Particles passed through the vertex
are gathered on this line.
• Line 3 is the controling line. We assume that this line is
subjected to an adjustable constant external potential U.
• Line 4 is the drain Our analysis has shown that this
seemingly redundant line is needed for the device we
wish to construct.
The vertex coupling is again assumed to be of a Fulop-Tsutsui
type, speciﬁed by the coupling matrix

There is a value of the parameter a that deserves a particular
attention, namely a = 1/

disappears and the function P(k; U) becomes constant in the
whole interval (0,

The situation is evident in Fig. 10. This can be also regarded

Our device behaves as a spectral ﬁlter with a ﬂat passband that
transmits one fourth of quantum particles with momenta k ∈
[0,
√
U] to the output, whereas particles with higher momenta
are diverted to other lines, mainly to 3 and 4. The process is
directly controlled by the external potential U. Note that, at
this parameter value a = 1/

2. The transmission probability P(k; U) as a function
of k with the value of the potential set to U = 1 is plotted in the top
ﬁgure. The lower ﬁgure shows the reﬂection probability |S11(k; U)|2 and
the probabilities of transmission to the controlling line |S31(k; U)|2 and to
the drain line |S41(k; U)|2.
Since increasing U opens the channel 1→2 for more par-
ticles, the device can be regarded as a quantum sluice-gate,
applicable as a quantum ﬂux controller (Fig. 11). When there
are many particles described by the momentum distribution
ρ(k) on the line 1, the ﬂux J to the line 2 is given by
J(U) =
Z
dkρ(k)kP(k; U) .
(83)
Assuming the Fermi distribution with Fermi momentum kF
larger than our range of operation of
√
U, we can set ρ(k) =
ρ = const. With the approximation P(k; U) ≈ 1
4Θ(
√
U − k),
we obtain
J(U) = 1
8ρU,
(84)
which indicates the linear ﬂux control.
The sluice-gate built from an n = 4 star graph has another
possible mode of operation. We can apply another external
ﬁeld V which we assume to be in the range 0 < V < U to
the line No. 4. The local momenta on lines 1 to 4 are given
by
k1 = k2 = k,
k3 =
p
k2 − U,
k4 =
p
k2 − V .
(85)
The system now has two threshold momenta given by
kth1 =

U,
kth2 =

whose edges are connected to external lines. The examination
of more complicated graphs, having purely internal lines, is
the natural future direction.
The full solution to the inverse scattering problem and its
use as a basis for ﬁltering device, which we have shown in
this article, amount to the partial fulﬁllment of the hope, that
quantum graph could be a solvable model and useful design
tool at the same time. The application of the quantum graphs
we have considered here obviously is just a starting attempt,
to which many follow-ups in the future should be expected.
