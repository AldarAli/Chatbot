Evolution 
(LTE) 
uses 
different 
techniques to achieve high throughput required, such as the 
HARQ techniques, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) 
transmission schemes and estimation techniques. In the 
present paper, research focuses on Downlink LTE channel 
estimation which is based on the interpolation to estimate 
channel coefficients. Thus, we propose an adaptive method for 
polynomial interpolation based on Lagrange polynomial. We 
perform the Downlink LTE system for Single-Input Single-
Output (SISO) and MIMO transmission then compare the 
obtained results with linear and Sinus Cardinal Interpolations. 
The simulation results show that the Lagrange method 
outperforms the linear interpolation in term of Block Error 
Rate (BLER) and throughput vs. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

 INTRODUCTION  
In modern world, requirement of high data rate 
communication has become inevitable.  Applications such 
as streaming transmission, video images, and World Wide 
Web browsing require high speed data transmission with 
mobility. In order to fulfill these data requirements, the 3rd 
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [1][2] introduced 
Long Term Evolution (LTE), to provide high speed data rate 
for mobile communication. The LTE system affords an 
important effective bit rate and allows increasing system 
capacity in terms of numbers of simultaneous calls per cell. 
In addition, it has a low latency compared to 3G/3G + 
networks. It offers a theoretical speed of 100 Mbits/ s in the 
Downlink and 50Mbits/s in the Uplink transmission. The 
LTE uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation 
(OFDM) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation 
multiple access technique (OFDMA) in the downlink 
transmission [3]. The OFDM provides the signal transmitted 
robustness against the multipath effect and can improve the 
spectral efficiency of the system [4][5]. On the other hand, 
the implementation of MIMO system increases channel 
capacity and decreases the signal fading by sending the 
same information at the same time through multiple 
antennas[5]. The combination of these two powerful 
technologies (MIMO-OFDM) in the LTE system improving 
thus the spectral efficiency and throughput offered without 
increasing resources for base bands and power output. To 
best exploit the power of MIMO-OFDM technology, it is 
imperative to manage at best the estimation of the channel 
coefficients; this operation is ensured by the interpolation of 
pilots. 
In this paper, we represent a polynomial interpolation 
algorithm using the method of Lagrange [10] which greatly 
reduces the complexity of the transceiver. The simulation is 
made on a ‚ÄòVehicular A‚Äô (Veh A) [11][12] channel through 
SISO and MIMO system using Least Square equalizer (LS). 
Section II of this paper give an over view of MIMO-OFDM 
transmission. In Section III, we present Lagrange 
interpolation algorithm. Finally, Section IV provides the 
numerical results. 
II. 
MIMO-OFDM TRANSMISSION  
A. MIMO OFDM transmissions schemes 
In this section, we are going to describe the MIMO 
OFDM transmission scheme. A modulation block is used to 
modulate the original binary data symbol using the complex 
constellation QPSK, 16 QAM or 64 QAM according to the 
LTE standard [6][7]. Pilot insertion is generated according 
to the LTE standards, followed by Inverse Fast Fourier 
Transform operation (IFFT); at the end, a cyclical prefix is 
inserted to remedy the phenomenon of the Inter Symbol 
Interference (ISI) and the Inter Sub carriers Interference. 
Transmission is made through a multipath Fast Fading 
channel over a multiple antenna system. Multiple antennas 
can be used in the transmitter and the receiver; 
consequently, MIMO encoders are needed to increase the 
spatial diversity or the channel capacity. Applying MIMO 
allows us to get a diversity gain to remove signal fading or 
getting a gain in terms of capacity. Generally, there are three 
types of MIMO receivers, as presented in [1]. At the 
reception, the cyclical prefix is firstly removed, followed by 
the Fast Fourier Transform operation (FFT); after the 
extraction of pilots, parameters of channel is estimated 
through the block interpolation followed by equalization. 
The method of interpolation chosen is essential to make the 
estimation more efficient and to reduce the equalizer 
complexity.

B. Aanalysis of standard LTE pilot scattering 
In the LTE standards, pilots are placed in a well-defined 
ways to cover up the frequency and time domain. The 
location of pilots for 2x2 MIMO transmissions scheme in 
LTE system is shown in the following figures. 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Pilot structure of Transmit 
 
Fig. 3. Pilot structure of Transmitter 2. 
It can be seen that, through the first antenna, pilots are 
disposed in OFDM symbols numbers 1, 5, 8 and 12 while 
for the second antenna, they are placed in the same OFDM 
symbols, but in different subcarriers index. 
Those positions allow a better coverage of the frequency 
and time and reduce the risk of interference in reception [3].

DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERPOLATION ALGORITHM 
A. Linear Interpolation  
In 
linear 
polynomial 
interpolation, 
the 
channel 
coefficients are estimated using the linear relationship 
between two successive pilots.

extracted and then  interpolation block is attacked to 
estimate the parameter ()

interpolation operation is necessary for both frequency and 
time domain.  
In the present work, we use a Lagrange polynomial 
interpolation for frequency domain and linear interpolation 
for temporary. The interpolation algorithm is represented as

A. Simulation results and discussion 
To observe the effect of the Lagrange polynomial 
interpolation compared with linear and SinC interpolation 
techniques, we simulate and trace the performance of LTE 
Downlink system in SISO and MIMO transmission over 
multipath channel (ITU-Veh A) using an LS equalizer . The 
simulations have been carried out for the 16-QAM (CQI=7). 
The Block Error Rate (BLER) and throughput vs. SNR 
results were study. Figures 5 and 6 show Block Error Rate 
vs. SNR for known channel, Lagrange polynomial, Sinus 
Cardinal and linear interpolations for both SISO and MIMO 
transmission.

The BLER results of LTE downlink transmission for 
SISO and MIMO transmission scheme is shown in Fig. 5 
and Fig. 6. We can see that the Lagrange polynomial 
interpolation enhances the performance of downlink LTE 
system by almost than 2 dB for BLER =10-1.

Fig 8 .Throughputvs. SNR for MIMO Transmission over Veh-A channel, 
CQI=7. 
As shown in Figures 7 and 8 the throughput of SISO and 
MIMO transmission for CQI=7 over Vehicular A channel 
can be compared. We can note that the suggested algorithm 
of interpolation improve throughput compared to the linear 
and Sinus Cardinal interpolation. For example, with 
throughput=1 MHz we have a gain almost than 1dB for 
SISO and MIMO systems. 
After studying performance, we find that the Lagrange 
polynomial interpolation offers a significant improvement 
compared to the linear and Sinus Cardinal Interpolation, as a 
result of the precision given by using n pilots to estimate 
each parameter channel. In fact, the use of n pilots in 
estimation of the channel coefficients takes into account the 
correlation between the pilot subcarriers; which makes this 
calculation more accurate and thus enhances the system 
efficiency. 
It is obvious that this polynomial interpolation algorithm 
is more complex than the linear and Sinus Cardinal 
Interpolation,   however it significantly improves system 
performance especially in the case of a fast fading channel 
(our case). 
On the other hand, this algorithm has the advantage of 
having an adaptable order of polynomial interpolation n 
according to transmission condition. For example, in our 
case, we use a channel ITU-Veh A in the Bandwidth of 1.4 
MHz where we have n = 5 for same Bandwidth but for ITU- 
PEDISTRIAN-B channel n = 4. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In the present work  , adaptive polynomial interpolation 
algorithm was described in relation with the method of 
Lagrange for Downlink LTE system. Simulation is achieved 
through an ITU-Veh A channel with CQI = 7 and for SISO 
and MIMO systems .We conclude that, despite the 
complexity of this algorithm (compared to the linear and 
Sinus Cardinal Interpolation), it offers a considerable 
improvement of the performance of Downlink LTE system. 
In effect, using a maximum number of pilots to estimate the 
parameters of the channel (5 in our case) against two for a 
linear interpolation optimize considerably the estimation of 
these parameters.
