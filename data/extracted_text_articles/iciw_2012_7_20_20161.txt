Abstract—This paper presents the design and functionality of a 
methane (CH4) concentration measurement system, based on a 
virtual instrumentation (VI) solution implemented using 
National Instruments’ LabVIEW. It contains a semiconductor 
type dedicated gas sensor, specific conditioning circuitry and a 
software program running on a portable computer. An 
important feature of the proposed implementation is the 
possibility to transmit calculation results and receive control 
commands from a mobile phone with internet connectivity. 
Other features include data logging of concentration 
parameters and statistical calculations. The instrumentation 
represents a cost effective solution due to software/hardware 
adaptability and can be easily extended for monitoring other 
gases. Experimental results which illustrate the operation of 
the system in CH4 contaminated environments are also 
presented.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The use of semiconductor type gas sensors for 
applications which investigate ambient air pollution levels is 
a common approach due to several reasons. These sensors 
combine high sensitivity to target gases, low power 
consumption, long life, straightforward installation and low 
cost. Together with an appropriate software application, one 
can develop a measurement system which can be adapted to 
monitor one or several gases [1, 2, 3]. 
The use of combustible gases within industrial and civil 
buildings represents a permanent explosion and/or fire 
potential danger. Such disasters happen due to gas 
accumulations caused by improper device operation or 
leakage. When concentrations of such gases reach the LEL 
(Lower Explosion Limit) values, in contact with the air and a 
fire source (spark, high surface temperature), they can cause 
explosions which may lead to life and material loss. 
Mobile phone applications offer new possibilities of 
effective remote control and monitoring. They are becoming 
more 
reliable, 
interesting 
and 
attractive. 
Extensive 
development of such solutions for domains like city car 
parking, power plant monitoring, SMS (Short Message 
Service) if monitored parameters are outside allowed limits, 
SMTP e-mailing or medical condition monitoring, is a 
current concern. Instrumentation companies offer software 
and hardware packages for development of mobile solutions 
for hand-held devices and smart-phones. 
Wen et al. [4] describes an interesting tele-monitoring 
application which records ECG signals, processes the 
waveforms and sends SMS (Short Message Service) 
messages to authorized mobile phones if anomalies are 
automatically detected. The communication between the 
elements of this system is provided by a Web Server and the 
TCP/IP protocol. 
Another implementation which uses a mobile device for 
transmission of SMS warnings with the purpose of alerting 
farmers is proposed by Aziz et al. [17]. Recorded 
temperature data is processed and with the help of a GSM 
modem, alerts are sent to mobile phones in case levels 
exceed accepted limits.    
This paper presents a virtual instrumentation which was 
designed for CH4 concentration calculation and monitoring. 
The concept of VI involves a software and hardware 
ensemble which has the purpose of replacing a stand-alone, 
dedicated device. The main advantage of this approach is the 
possibility to exploit the calculus power and performances of 
the PC on which the software component runs. 
Technological innovations together with customer needs 
for increased functionality in smaller dimensions devices, 
have caused the spread of VI in domains like: health and 
medicine, environmental monitoring, remote monitoring, 
structural investigations, clean energy production, data 
transmission, industrial control, education, robotics and/or 
automation. 
In related literature, the use of VI is demonstrated by 
Farhey in [5]. The author presents a solution for monitoring 
the structure of a bridge. Recorded data are used for 
evaluating the condition of the construction. The system 
includes sensors, wireless transmitters and a user-friendly 
graphical user interface. 
Rana and Khan [6] present the complete implementation 
of a Digital Oscilloscope which uses a NI PCI-6035E card 
and LabVIEW. This tool is used to study complex signals 
and includes algorithms for frequency and time domains 
analysis. 
In order to extend the mobility of our application, access 
to measurement results and program control is available by 
the use of a web browser on a mobile phone. The user can 
also choose to store data values and calculations results on

the host computer. These options turn the proposed 
instrumentation into a portable solution which is both 
reliable, low cost and can be easily adapted to perform 
different analysis on the measured data [4, 6]. 
There are two important components which constitute the 
CH4 monitoring system.  
The hardware includes the TGS2611-C00 methane gas 
sensor. This sensor satisfies the performance requirements of 
the UL1484 and EN50194 standards. Specific applications 
are domestic gas alarms, portable gas detectors or gas leak 
detectors for gas appliances. It is part of a measurement 
circuit connected through a data acquisition device to a 
personal computer. The sensor’s analog output is sampled 
and transmitted to a computer program using USB 
connectivity. In manufacturer specifications, the use of this 
sensor is restricted to detecting if the CH4 concentration 
exceeds the accepted limit. 
The software component uses state-machine architecture 
for both, control of the measurement circuit and data 
processing requirements [7, 8]. It was implemented using 
LabVIEW development environment with the Database 
Connectivity Toolset and the NI DAQ MX drivers. NI 
Multisim 11.0 was used for circuit design and analysis. PHP 
5.3.5 and MySQL 5.1.54 (embedded in EasyPHP 5.3.5.0) 
were used for data transmission and application control. Line 
style flash charts designed by AmCharts were included in the 
mobile phone user interface. The LabVIEW Web Publishing 
Tool was used for creating the HTML document which can 
be accessed using a notebook. In such cases, one has to 
check if the RunTime Engine software component is 
installed on the remote computer [10, 11]. 
Section 2 presents the CH4 concentration measurement 
system. This section includes a description of a proposed 
empirical algorithm for methane concentration calculation. 
The virtual instrumentation hardware and the software 
components are discussed. Section 3 presents relevant 
experimental 
results. 
Conclusions 
regarding 
both 
experimental results and future development of the 
application are mentioned in the final section. 
II. 
METHANE CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENT SYSTEM 
An overview of the CH4 measurement system is 
presented in Fig. 1. The functionality was tested under 
laboratory conditions. The measurement circuit contains the 
CH4 gas sensor and the proper signal conditioning. This 
circuit was placed in a laboratory where we could safely feed 
target gas concentrations to the sensor. Using a data 
acquisition device (NI USB-6251) as interface between the 
circuit and the computer running the acquisition software, 
data is sampled and analyzed. If the user chooses to remotely 
view the calculation results and control the application, an 
option for Internet Connectivity is available. In this scenario, 
raw measured data and calculation results are sent to a 
remote Web Server with SQL and PHP support. Remote 
access to all available information requires authentication 
(using a username and a password) and can be obtained via 
an html page which resides on the Web Server. For this case 
we used a Mobile Phone and a Notebook to both view data 
and control the measurement circuit. 
 
Figure 1. Overview of the methane concentration measurement system. 
 
The TGS2611-C00 semiconductor type gas sensor is the 
core of the application. It provides high sensitivity to 
methane and low power consumption. For this particular 
application, the sensor was used with the pre-calibrated 
NGM2611-C13 module. This module includes temperature 
compensation and meets RoHS regulations. Variations of the 
electrical parameters for the TGS2611-C00 sensing element 
are very consistent with concentrations of CH4 in the 
surrounding environment [3, 9, 15]. 
Fig. 2 shows the logarithmic representation for the 
sensitivity characteristics of the TGS2611-C00 under 
standard test conditions (manufacturer specifications). One 
can notice that the sensor internal resistance ratio (Rs/Ro), 
decreases as target gas concentration increases. 
 
 
Figure 2. Gas sensor TGS2611 description: sensitivity characteristics. 
 
In the case of methane, the sensitivity characteristics 
show that R0 is equal to the sensor resistance Rs when the 
concentration is 5000 ppm. The recommended concentration 
values domain is 300 ppm to 10000 ppm. These 
characteristics are specific for every sensor type. Therefore, 
one should pay attention to the producer code for each device 
(#11 in our case) because the load resistor should be chosen 
in accordance. 
The accepted Lower Explosion Limit (LEL) value is 
50000 ppm. For this particular case, the NGM2611-C13

module was calibrated to generate an alarm signal when the 
gas concentration reaches 5000 ppm (or 10%LEL). In 
practice, this limit is variable due to factors like test 
conditions tolerances, heat generation inside the sensor 
enclosure or humidity. If the circuit is operating at 
recommended parameters, the interval for the accepted alarm 
limit value is 5%LEL to 20%LEL. 
Fig. 3 shows the NGM2611-C13 basic circuit diagram. 
 
 
Figure 3. Calibrated module basic diagram. 
 
The operation of the implemented measurement circuit 
requires a current IC = 90 mA and a steady VC = 5 V voltage. 
As the current flows through the heater, the sensing element 
is heated and starts to react to the target gas. The voltage 
divider which contains the sensing element and RL outputs at 
pin number 2 an electrical potential which increases with the 
gas concentration. At the same time, the voltage divider 
composed of R1, RTH, R2, R3 and RVR (potentiometer 
resistance) sets on pin 3 the alarm signal threshold which in 
this case is approximately VAlarm = 2.5 V (alarm threshold). 
When the voltage on pin 2 exceeds VAlarm the alarm signal is 
triggered. In this way one can detect if the CH4 concentration 
is above the established limit. 
A. An empirical relation for concentration calculation 
As specified by the manufacturer, the common use of the 
TGS2611-C00 is for detecting if the CH4 concentration level 
exceeds the 5000 ppm limit. This paper extends the 
application range of the TGS2611-C00 sensor to continuous 
monitoring of methane concentration. Thus, based on the 
sensitivity characteristics presented in Fig. 2, an empirical 
relation between the CH4 concentration value and the 
sensor’s output voltage was determined. As a first step, the 
empirical relation (1), between the sensor’s internal 
resistance ratio Rs /Ro and the methane concentration C, was 
found.

The values of the empirical constants are: D = 46.2 and k

internal

ratio

concentration. The logarithmic representation (bottom) is 
consistent with the appropriate sensitivity characteristic 
presented in Fig. 2. This means that the constants D and k 
were accurately determined.

For an output voltage VRL = VC/2 = 2.5 V corresponding 
to a CH4 concentration C = 5000 ppm, it follows that RL =  
Rs at C = 5000 ppm, or RL =  R0. Thus, (2) can be also

B. Virtual instrumentation hardware 
For this particular application, the data acquisition device 
must provide 2 analog input lines and the 5 V power line. 
The multifunction NI USB-6251 device offers the required 
features. A connector with screw terminals (CB-68LPR) was 
used to easily access individual signals. Highly selective 
response to CH4 can be obtained by eliminating transients by 
using a filtering material or an appropriate delaying circuit. 
The latter solution was chosen for this particular 
implementation. The sensor's response to the target gas 
stabilizes within minutes (2.5 minutes according to 
manufacturer specifications), depending on how long it has 
been inactive. A warm-up alarm prevention RC circuit was 
implemented with the purpose of delaying the sensor 
response after power-up. Only when the acquired data is 
stationary can the correct concentration be calculated [12, 
13]. 
Target gas concentration may fluctuate around the 
10%LEL level. A circuit for prevention of disturbing 
intermittent alarming was implemented. In this way a range 
for the alarming threshold was created. The alarm is 
triggered when the sensor voltage exceeds the upper range 
and lasts until the voltage drops below the lower range. 
A final RC circuit was implemented with the purpose of 
eliminating false alarms caused by the sensor’s reaction to 
transient interference gases such as alcohol vapors. The 
recommended timing for the alarm delay is 15 s. 
The component values for the TGS2611-C00 sensor were 
set in order to simulate the case when the RS value 
corresponds to a 5000 ppm gas concentration.  The values 
for the NGM2611-C13 module components are set 
according to specific measurements. The Data Acquisition 
part was implemented using the MCP601 amplifier as a 
voltage follower. In this way the sensor voltage is transferred 
to an input line of the NI USB-6251. The conditioning 
circuits were designed using LM339 comparators. A single 
LM339 chip was used in the actual circuit since it contains 
four separate comparators.  
C. Virtual instrumentation software 
The main features of the proposed instrumentation are: 
 
The possibility to change the acquisition sampling 
time from 1 second to 5 seconds. The user can stop 
the acquisition and resume it without losing the 
displayed data. 
 
For ulterior processing, measurement data and 
calculations results can be saved in a text file on 
the host computer. 
 
The user can activate the option for sending data to 
the server and for allowing remote application 
control from the mobile phone. 
 
Calculations are performed and displayed with 
each 
measurement. 
Methane 
concentration 
calculated in ppm and percentage, real-time voltage 
values for the sensor signal and the alarm limit 
(VAlarm). The concentration values are obtained 
based 
on 
the 
linearity 
of 
the 
sensitivity 
characteristics. The voltage values can be studied 
in order to see if the circuitry is functioning at 
correct parameters. 
 
Error messages are displayed if the server or the 
input lines of the NI USB-6251 cannot be accessed. 
 
Time domain representations for the sensor output 
voltage, alarm limit voltage and a running average 
of the last 4 measured sensor voltage values are 
presented.   
Some practical applications in which these features can 
be used are gas concentration monitoring in residential 
buildings, tunnels or underground parking. Also, collected 
data can be used for statistical calculations which are used 
for long term studies of concentration evolution. 
Fig. 6 presents the basic execution diagram of the 
software component.

The software component was developed using the JKI 
software add-on state-machine architecture. The advantage 
of using the JKI state-machine is that starting from a well

defined structure, new states for Acquiring Data, 
Calculations and Data Saving were introduced. We adapted 
the existing Data Initialize/CleanUp states according to 
particular needs. Another important issue is the functionality 
of the front panel buttons when the application is running. 
Property nodes which disable and enable the front panel 
buttons can be used as the code execution flows through the 
states. In this way one can avoid the situation of front panel 
freezing when the application is in the Acquiring Data state 
and the user presses the Exit button.  
Fig. 7 shows the front panel of the virtual instrument. A 
short period when the gas concentration exceeds the allowed 
limit can be noticed on the voltage waveform graph. 
Operation settings, calculation results and functionality 
errors indicators are included. 
 
 
Figure 7. Front panel of the virtual instrument. 
 
The Database Connectivity Toolset is used to transmit 
and receive information to/from a server from/to the 
application running on the software program. Before running 
the program, an UDL (Universal Data Link) file was created 
in order to define the communication with the server. This 
file is used by the DB Tools Open Connection function from 
the Database Connectivity Toolset. Once the remote 
connection is successful, the program will be able to transmit 
and receive data over the Internet. Two tables are used for 
this particular application. One is used for storage of current 
measurement data, the other is used for remote commands 
sent from the mobile phone to the instrumentation [14, 16]. 
If new measurement data is available on the server, a 
remote user can connect to the database and view the results. 
The same server hosts the PHP files which can be accessed 
using the mobile phone browser. Furthermore, if the remote 
user works with a portable computer, two connectivity 
possibilities are available: either by using the PHP files on 
the server or by using the HTML document created with the 
LabVIEW Web Publishing Tool on the host computer. The 
client computer must have the RunTime Engine software 
component installed. This allows complete control of the 
main application, if requested by the client computer and 
granted by the host computer. 
When accessing the PHP file on the server, an 
AmCharts’ Flash line graph is loaded. Using the same PHP 
script, data values (last 12 recorded) and calculation results 
are read from the database and displayed on the mobile 
phone screen. If needed, the mobile phone user can stop the 
main application.  
Fig. 8 shows the remote operation of the measurement 
system using a client notebook (upper image) and the mobile 
phone (bottom image). In both cases one can notice that the 
measurement system senses the presence of a higher 
methane concentration.

III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Confirmation of the application’s functionality was 
carried out in laboratory conditions. The NGM2611-C13 
module was exposed to concentrations which were above 
and below the accepted LEL value. 
Table 1 presents measurement results recorded several 
minutes after the sensor response has settled, including the 
short time period when a high CH4 concentration was 
recorded. Immediate reaction to the presence of CH4 inside 
the sensor’s enclosure can be noticed. After the target gas 
slowly exits, the sensor’s response falls to initial values. The 
values presented in the table were obtained using (5). Since 
this relation is considered accurate over the 300 ppm to 
10000 ppm domain, one can notice that the valid calculations 
are presented in bold.

IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, the design and implementation of a virtual 
instrumentation solution for monitoring CH4 concentrations 
was presented. The application uses the TGS2611-C00 
sensor, the NI USB-6251 data acquisition device and the 
LabVIEW 2009 development environment. 
An original and state of the art feature of the proposed 
system is the possibility to remotely view measurement 
results and control the operation using a mobile phone with 
Internet connectivity and Flash script capabilities. Remote 
access from a client computer, using the LabVIEW Web 
Publishing Tool, is also possible. 
Experimental results showed that the proposed system’s 
response to the sudden exposure to a high concentration was 
accurate and fast. Remote monitoring from a mobile phone 
and a client notebook were successful. This determined the 
conclusion that the proposed instrumentation has been 
properly designed and implemented. An empirical formula 
for concentration calculation was proposed in (5) and was 
implemented in the software component. 
As further development, our goal is to test the precision 
with which CH4 concentrations are determined. This can be 
done by taking measurements in spaces where a 
predetermined 
methane 
concentration 
is 
inserted. 
Furthermore, new options for controlling the instrument 
using the mobile phone are needed. This will assure 
complete operation from distance without the imperative 
need of a computer.
