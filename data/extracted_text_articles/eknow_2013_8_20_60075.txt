Abstract—This paper describes a new method for analyzing 
emergent organizational behaviors, which are causes of 
innovation and deviation phenomena, through an agent based 
model and a case design. Organizational deviation is 
inextricably linked to innovation, because their mechanisms 
are similar in terms of breaking operational standards. We 
have assumed that the former and the latter are different in 
external utilities, and under this assumption, we have 
developed a unified agent based model. The agent base 
simulations have been conducted based on the model, for 
analyzing the emergence process of innovation and deviation. 
The simulation results have been compared with case analysis 
in order to obtain an in-depth understanding of inextricably 
linked organizational phenomena, and to distinguish the 
similarities and differences between innovation and deviation.  
Keywords-Agent based modeling; organizational deviation; 
case design; organizational behavior 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Innovation is the act of producing something newly 
introduced. Organizational deviation is misconduct in 
organizational management. Companies tend to control 
organizational deviation strictly because they would get 
serious damage when it has been revealed. Direct control of 
deviation may, however, reduce the power of Innovation, 
because both deviation and innovation have similar 
mechanisms of breaking standards. 
In sociology, deviation is classified into three categories 
[1]. First is criminality, second is violating conduct norms, 
and third is labeling. This paper is based on the concept of 
the second category, because it contains similar notions to 
innovation 
which 
is 
achieved 
from 
organizational 
improvement by breaking standards. Our model is built from 
the belief that organizational deviation and innovation have 
similar mechanisms, but they are different in the external 
utility or disutility.   
Organizational 
deviation 
does 
not 
always 
occur 
according to immoral agents’ wrongdoing [2]. It may emerge 
from unintentional behaviors of the agents with the bounded 
rationality, because they tend to act shortsightedly and to 
converge to local optima. It means that if agents have 
behaved aiming at Innovation, they would commit deviation 
unintentionally by producing disutility to the society. The 
shortsighted behavior is enhanced by the difficulty in 
recognizing the utility landscape. Therefore, we incorporate 
a hierarchical utility landscape into our model by expanding 
the landscape theory [3, 4]. The landscape theory explains 
the  shortsighted behavior of agents by the limited range of 
view to landscape on which they behave.  
The purpose of this paper is presenting a method for 
analyzing 
inextricably 
linked 
phenomena 
such 
as 
organizational innovation and deviation by combination of 
agent based simulation, manual simulation and case 
description.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II 
explains our unified model of deviation and innovation; 
Section III shows the result of computer simulation  ; Section 
IV explains the case design and analysis approach ; Section 
V presents the results of the manual simulation ;  Section VI 
describes the model based 'virtual' case ; and Section VII 
presents the conclusion and future work. 
 
II. 
AGENT BASED MODEL  
This section describes our unified model of deviation 
and innovation, which simplifies a real structure of an 
organization and the relation between an organization and a 
society. Agent based modeling method is applied in order to 
examine the bottom up emergence process of innovation  
and deviation. In this model, the implemented hierarchical 
utility landscape consists of three layers: individual, 
organizational, and social utility.

In figure1, Hierarchical organizational structure which 
consists of three layers is brought into our model, because it 
is seen in many companies. Utility function of individuals 
means experience and values of each agent. Utility function 
of organization means business model of a company. Utility 
function of society means social norms. 
In this model, agents choose their actions according to 
the rewards from organization and information from 
neighbors. As a result, their utility production which means 
contribution to an organization and a society is determined 
based on utility landscape. The accumulated organizational 
utility is distributed to all agents based on their amount of 
contribution through the system of rewards. The result-based 
reward is applied in this model Agents can recognize their 
own utilities, however, they cannot recognize organizational 
and social utility landscape completely. Therefore, both 
deviation and Innovation may emerge depending on 
experiment conditions, and this is the advantage of our 
model. Based on the model, we define two types of 
phenomena as shown in table 1 : a) Innovation is the increase 
of both organizational and social utility production, b) 
Organizational deviation is the decrease social utility 
production. 
For example, in a Japanese pastry company case, the 
reduction of product disposals is consistent with their beliefs, 
in other words employees could recognize their individual 
utility. However they could neither recognize the social 
regulations, nor company’s damages due to consideration of 
violating law. In other words, they could neither recognize 
social utility nor organizational utility landscape thoroughly. 
As a result, they conducted organizational deviation despite 
of aiming at innovation.

B. Utility Function 
The Utility functions which are described in the previous 
section, are based on the NK fitness landscape model [5, 6]. 
NK model determines the values of N integer sequences, and 
utility landscape is defined by the combinations of K integers. 
Figure 2 shows a sample of integer combinations and their 
values, in case of N=6 and K=1.

The variation of utility functions is described by 
number sequences and their evaluation values. Evaluation 
value is given between 0 to 1 depending on combinations of 
integers. The complexity of utility landscape depends on the 
number of integers and their combinations..  
C. Choosing Actions of Agents  
Each agent changes their action in order to increase 
their satisfaction according to the formula (1). In formula 
(1), the degree of satisfaction of agents increases along with 
the rising of their individual utilities: Uind_i(X), rewards 
from organization: Rei, and contributions for social utility: 
Usoc(X). The index i means the number of agents.

Agents imitate the actions of other agents whose actions 
are similar to them and receiving more rewards from 
organization according to the formula (2). Pj means the 
probability that agenti imitates the action of agentj. k means 
the number of agent. Lij means the similarity of action 
between agenti and agentj. Agents evaluate their satisfaction 
after imitation, and then return to original action when their 
degrees of satisfaction have been declined by the imitation.

The agents produce their own utility, and contribute to

The contributions of agents are accumulated in an 
organization and a society. 
III. 
COMPUTER SIMULATION EXPERIMENT  
Based on the descriptions of the model in previous 
section, we have developed the simulator according to agent 
based computational architecture [7] in Java language. This 
section describes settings and results of the agent based 
simulation experiment. Those results are confirmed by 
manual simulation and case  description in following section. 
In this experiment, the change in utility production 
amount of an organization and a society is analyzed by 
shifting the diversity of agents from 0% (uniform 
organization) to 100% (diversified organization). All agents 
have unique individual utility functions in the organization 
with 100% diversity, while they have common utility 
functions in the organization with 0% diversity. The other 
conditions are fixed. 
Figure 3 shows the result that is emerged when 
improving diversification in agents. In figure 3, both social 
utility and organizational utility productions are increasing 
with improving diversification. This result suggests that the 
diversification in agents prompts Innovation type activities 
according to the definitions in Table1, and the result is 
corresponding to previous study [8].

Figure 3.  Utility production change that occurs with diversification. 
This result means that mutual imitation in diversified 
organization makes individual utility production decline, 
because individual utility functions of agents are different 
from each other. As a result, agents tend to increase 
organizational utility and social utility production amount in 
order to complement the lowering of individual utility 
production, and to maintain their satisfaction which is 
determined by the formula (1).   
 
IV. 
CASE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS APPROACH  
Figure 4 presents the steps of case design and analysis. 
The simulation results in previous section are confirmed 
through these steps moreover innovation and deviation 
phenomena are analyzed from different point of view. The 
overview of case design and analysis approach is as follows. 
 The first part is Case Settings. In this part, the model 
elements are converted to the business management elements. 
Then case story template and utility landscape are developed 
according to those elements. The second part is Manual 
Simulation which is described in chapter V. In this part, 
manual simulation is conducted based on our model. The 
third part is Confirmation of Simulation Results. The result 
of agent based simulation which is described in chapter III is 
confirmed by the manual simulation in this section. The 
fourth part is Case Development. The could-be cases are 
developed in line with the case story template and the results 
of manual simulations in chapter VI.

MANUAL SIMULATION AND CONFIRMATION OF 
COMUPUTER SIMULATION RESULT    
This Before case development, utility landscapes are set 
in table 3 and table 4 using NK model which is described 
previously. We have set N=3 and K=1 for case settings and 
manual simulation.   A fictional food maker is assumed in

this paper. We assume that this food maker is required to 
reduce the production cost because of increasing competition 
however there are strict regulations in food industry.

Manual simulations using simple NK model are 
conducted based on table 3 and 4. Table 5 and 7 show the 
case settings which are social norms, the food maker's policy 
of manufacturing, and each assembly leader's policy. The 
situation of Case A is that all assembly leaders have same 
management policy, so that means uniform organization 
(Table 5). The Case B is that each assembly leader has 
different management policy, so that means diversified 
organization (Table 7). The manual simulation enables the 
confirmation of computer simulation results by tracing the 
behavior changing of each agent particularly. 
 
A. Manual Simulation: Case A 
In case A, all assembly leaders have same cost-conscious 
management policy as shown in table 5, and there is a certain 
degree of conflict between social norms and food maker's 
policy. Table 6 describes the process of manual simulation of 
case A, which is conducted according to landscape settings 
and behavior rules of agents. Each assembly line leader's 
behavior has been changed by searching for more 
satisfactory action, and also imitating of another leader's 
action according to NK model settings as shown in table 5.  
Figure 6 shows the transition of utility production by 
assembly leaders as the results of behavior change. The 
social utility production means contribution to society by 
protecting of food safety. The organization utility means 
contribution to corporate objectives such as cost reduction. 
Assembly leaders receive rewards by their contributions.  
The individual utility means comfort of leaders which are 
achieved by the consistency with their management policies. 
As shown in figure 6, deviation type phenomenon emerges 
because social utility production amount is decreasing while 
organization utility production is increasing. It is because 
that all assembly leaders have cost-conscious management 
policy, and the food maker has also cost-conscious 
management policy while balancing with food safety.

B. Manual Simulation: Case B 
In case B, each assembly leader has different 
management policy as shown in table 7, and there is a 
certain degree of conflict between social norms and food 
maker's policy. The management policy of leader 1 is 
safety conscious, leader 2 is balance of safety and cost, 
leader 3 is cost conscious.  
Figure 7 shows the transition of utility production by 
assembly leaders as the results of behavior change. As 
shown in figure 7, innovation type phenomenon emerges 
because social utility production and organization utility 
production amount are increasing. It is because that leader 
1 and 2 have found the appropriate action which enable the 
increasing of both social utility and organization utility by 
own searching. And in addition, leader 3 who has cost 
conscious policy, has imitated their actions although he 
could not find the appropriate action by himself. 
 The explanation of  manual simulation process of case 
B is omitted.

Figure 7.  Manual Simulation Result: Case B. 
C. Confirmation of Computer Simulation  
The computer simulation result which is shown in 
figure 3 suggests that the diversification in agents prompts 
Innovation phenomena.  This result is confirmed by 
manual simulation in Case A and B by observing the 
behavior change of each assembly leader. The results of 
manual simulation show that diversified organization tends 
to emerge innovation type phenomena in case B while 
uniform organization tend to emerge deviation type 
phenomena in case A.

 CASE DEVELOPMENT  
A. Purpose and Approach 
A model based fictional case is described in this 
section according to the case story template (figure 5) and 
the results of manual simulation. There are two purposes 
of model based case description. The first is to understand 
the emergence process of innovation and deviation at more 
detailed level than simulation. The second is to compare 
the description level of model based case with that of 
actual case.   
The underlined portions are model elements and the 
italic words in parenthesis are the name of model elements. 
Only the story of case A is described in this paper. The 
stories of case B are omitted due to space limitation.  
 
B. Model based fictional case: Case A 
A food maker applied the product cost reduction policy 
because of severe competition in food industry. The 
company intended to balance cost reduction and product 
safety (Organizational Utility Function), however its 
policy was not completely fit to the requirements from 
consumers 
(Conflict 
between 
Social 
Utility 
and 
Organizational Utility).

In the food maker, the education programs were 
conducted for employees in order to strengthen their sense 
of cost reduction. As a result, most employees shared 
strong cost-consciousness(Individual Utility Function) in 
that company. Under the situation, cost reduction 
activities were executed in one of the factory in the food 
maker as follows.      
There were three assembly line leaders in the factory 
whose cost reduction policies were different from each 
other at the beginning. The assembly line leader 1 applied 
the safest way in three leaders. He sought production 
process efficiency, set use-by date based on guidelines, 
and conducted bacteria test for quality control (Behavior 
Status).  The leader 2 applied same method of cost 
reduction and use-by date setting as leader 1, however he 
conducted flavor test instead of bacteria test (Behavior 
Status). The leader 3 pursued waste prevention of raw 
materials, but ensured product safety by set use-by date 
based on guidelines, and conducted bacteria test 
(Behavior Status). 
In that situation, the assembly line leader 1 who applied 
the safest policy received the least reward according to 
the result-based reward system (Utility Distribution).  The 
leader 1 was frustrated at less reward and changed his 
way of quality control form  bacteria test to flavor test by 
imitating the way of leader 2 ( Imitation Learning). At the 
same time, the leader 2 and 3 applied the method of 
setting use-by date based on case-by-case judgments for 
more cost reduction through their trial and errors (Hill 
Climb Learning). This method had a risk of product safety 
decreasing, however it was consistent with their cost-
conscious policy(Individual Utility Function).  Therefore 
the leader 1 received less reward again because the leader 
2 and 3 applied more effective cost reduction 
method(Individual Utility Function), even though he 
imitated the method of leader 2 previously. So that, the 
leader 1 imitated the method of leader 2 again (Imitation 
Learning), because leader 2 received more reward than 
him.  
    As described above, all three leaders applied more 
effective cost reduction method while sacrificing the safety 
of products. They recognized the methods which are 
effective for product safety, but they were not satisfied 
with those methods because of inconsistency with their 
cost-consciousness and less reward(Structure of Agent's 
Satisfaction). As a result of assembly line leader's behavior 
change, the factory achieved cost reduction target 
(Organization Utility Production), however its risk of 
reducing the product safety increased significantly (Social 
Utility Production)..  
 
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
This paper presented a method for analyzing 
inextricably linked phenomena such as organizational 
innovation and deviation by combination of agent based 
simulation, manual simulation and case description.  
As described previously, a Japanese pastry company 
intended to conduct innovation in order to increase their 
organizational utilities, however they fell into deviation by 
unintentional decreasing of social utility because it 
falsified the expiration dates of products. According to the 
results of simulation and case description, it is detected 
that the emergence of deviation or innovation depends on 
the diversity of organization in this paper. It is also 
detected that how the diversity of organization impacts on 
behaviors and learning activities of agents.  
The advantage of this method is that it enables to 
approach toward inextricably linked phenomena with 
unified model and the combination of multiple method of 
analysis. The unified model enables to observe that small 
changes of model parameters would cause both deviation 
and innovation phenomena. Thus it is the contribution to 
organizational innovation and deviation research area, 
because previous studies tend to approach from one side, 
such as only innovation side [8] or deviation side [10]. The 
model based ‘virtual’ case description is the novel method 
in terms of creating future scenarios compared to standard 
case study which is based on past phenomena. 
In the further work, we would refine the method of 
manual simulation and case description with applying this 
method to another type of inextricably linked phenomena. 
And we would develop the novel method for creating 
future scenarios by integrating agent based simulation and 
model based case design. It is expected to reduce 
unexpected problems in organizational management.
