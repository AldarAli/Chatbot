Abstract— The Algerian Satellite Based Augmentation System 
(AL-SBAS) is developed by the Algerian Space Agency (ASAL) 
and is based on Algerian geostationary satellite Alcomsat-1. AL-
SBAS permits to transmit SBAS messages according to the 
international standards defined by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO). Compared to existing SBAS, 
currently the service area of AL-SBAS is limited to Algeria only. 
Thus, the number of Ionospheric Grid Points (IGP) and 
satellites “to be increased “ is lower than the existing SBAS, in 
particular the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay 
Service (EGNOS). The Al-SBAS correction messages are 
calculated by the Data-Processing Center (DPC) using GPS 
satellite data collected from a terrestrial network of 18 
Reference Stations (RS), which are geographically distributed 
over the entire country. This work presents the main 
characteristics and preliminary performance tests of the AL-
SBAS System. The analysis concerns in particular the 
parameters of pseudo-range and ionospheric correction, as well 
as the integrity transmitted by the system. Very promising 
results have been achieved considering the number of currently 
available reference stations in the south of Algeria, which is a 
region EGNOS does not cover. The ionospheric indicators using 
EGNOS are between 8 and 15, while the AL-SBAS allows to 
have indicators ranging between 6 and 13.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
A Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) is an 
augmentation system that transmits the complementary 
information to correct errors of measurements and to ensure 
integrity. SBAS broadcasts corrections of the Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)  satellite clock, satellite 
orbital error and corrections of ionospheric delays related to 
the signal propagation to improve positioning performance 
[1].  
Many countries have established their own SBAS’s. 
Currently, there are four operational SBAS, including the US 
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), the European 
EGNOS system, the Indian GPS Aided Geostationary 
Augmented Navigation (GAGAN), and the Japanese Multi-
functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS). Russia 
has also deployed its SBAS system, named the System for 
Differential Corrections and Monitoring (SDCM). In 
addition, some countries, such as Australia, Nigeria, and 
Korea, are testing their SBASs named the Southern 
Positioning Augmentation Network (SPAN), Nigerian 
Satellite 
Augmentation 
System 
(NSAS) 
and 
Korea 
Augmentation Satellite System (KASS) respectively. China 
is planning to broadcast SBAS messages via BeiDou 
Satellite-Based Augmentation System (BDSBAS) [2] [3].  
Algeria is also one of the countries that is implementing a 
similar augmentation system based on the geostationary 
satellite Alcomsat-1, in order to provide services for Algeria 
and the surrounding area.  
Alcomsat-1 communications satellite was launched on 
December 11, 2017, and is located at 24.8° W in a 
geostationary orbit.  Figure 1 illustrates the coverage of 
Alcomsat-1 Navigation Overlay Services named AL-SBAS. 
The coverage of Alcomsat-1 includes the entire Africa, South 
America and part of Europe. Alcomsat-1 Communications 
Satellite is equipped with 33 transponders, including L1&L5 
signals navigation augmentation (the other bands are Ku and 
Ka) [4].

The AL-SBAS permits to improve the positioning 
accuracy and integrity in Algeria and the nearby countries. 
The system aims to provide SBAS services not only for 
aviation users but also for other general users, such as 
surveying, transportation and railways, etc. 
The AL-SBAS collects GPS observations and corrects 
GPS satellites ephemeris errors, clock errors, and ionospheric 
errors together with the corresponding integrity parameters in 
real-time. The system broadcasts differential corrections 
through geostationary satellite (Alcomsat-1) with a high 
accuracy and a significant capability for integrity 
augmentation.

The mathematical model of the corrected observation 
equation using AL-SBAS messages is defined as follows [5]:  
𝑙𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 𝑙𝑚𝑒𝑠 + 𝑅𝐶𝑓𝑎𝑠𝑡+𝑅𝐶𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 − 𝑅𝐶𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑜 + 𝑅𝐶𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜                   (1) 
where 𝑙𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟  is the pseudo - range for position 
determination application, 𝑙𝑚𝑒𝑠  is the measured pseudo - 
range, 𝑅𝐶𝑓𝑎𝑠𝑡  is the fast corrections, 𝑅𝐶𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘  is the clock 
corrections, 𝑅𝐶𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑜  is the ionospheric corrections and 
𝑅𝐶𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜 is the tropospheric corrections. 
 
The main objectives of this work consists of analysing the 
evaluation of AL-SBAS corrections in Algeria and 
comparing the results with EGNOS. 
  The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
presents the Algerian augmentation system. Section III shows 
the results of the study. We conclude our work in Section IV.  
II. 
OVERVIEW OF THE ALGERIAN AUGMENTATION 
SYSTEM (AL-SBAS) BASED ON ALCOMSAT-1 
The AL-SBAS system functionality is similar to the 
SBAS, where a number of ground reference stations monitor 
the GPS satellites signals and provide their observations to 
one or more Master Control stations. An augmentation 
message is generated and transmitted via uplink stations 
within the uplink the coverage area of the geostationary 
satellite. Finally, this satellite broadcasts these signals 
regionally to users with messages to improve positioning 
accuracy and integrity. 
AL-SBAS consists of 18 RS that are installed only in 
Algeria and are covering all the Algerian territory, one DPC 
and one Ground Uplink Land Station in Algiers (GULS) [6]. 
 
A summary description of the AL-SBAS architecture is 
provided in Figure 2. 
               Figure 2.  AL-SBAS system description. 
A. Overview of AL-SBAS L1 Signal  
The structure of AL-SBAS signal is defined to have full 
compatibility with the SBAS signal. The generator of 
Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) code for spreading spectrum is 
the same as GPS/SBAS L1 (1575.42 MHz).  
The following PRN code number 148 is allocated to AL-
SBAS for use on L1 C/A code; Table 1 presents the PRN 
assignments for the  AL-SBAS system published in October 
2021 [7].

The AL-SBAS message structure is like other SBAS 
composed of 8-bit preamble (to ensure the synchronization of 
frame), 6-bit to define the Message Type (MT), 212-bit data 
field to provide corresponding data, and 24-bit Cyclic 
Redundancy Check (CRC) parity. Figure 3 illustrates all the 
correction parameters and integrity information that are 
included in 250-bit data every second [8].

AL-SBAS transmits messages in hexadecimal format; an 
example of the AL-SBAS raw message is given by Figure 4 
on 1 December, from 1:00:01 to 1:00:10 with message type 
MT: 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 25, 0, 2, 3 and 4.

In addition to differential corrections, the SBAS also 
monitors and broadcasts the integrity of GPS satellite signals. 
The user can determine which satellites and IGP are usable for 
reliable positioning computation. 
C. AL-SBAS Transmission Test  
 
The test transmission of AL-SBAS with code PRN 148 on 
Alcomsat-1 geostationary satellite was started in July 20, 
2020. Currently, this system is intended for test and 
development purposes only, which will be refined and 
developed to become a fully certified and operational SBAS 
for the Algerian region.   
 
The AL-SBAS transmission was not permanently 
available for each day of year 2021 and during daytime until 
21 May (DOY 142). To observe the function of the AL-SBAS 
in 2021, an analysis of transmitted messages has been 
performed for that year. These messages are available on the 
CNES Navigation and Time Monitoring FTP Service [9]. It 
gives access to AL-SBAS, which allows in an easier way to 
find and download files, which allows in an easier way to find 
and download files, regarding the AL-SBAS historical data. 
Figure 5 shows the number of messages transmitted by AL-
SBAS for each day of the year 2021. 
 
Figure 5. Histogram of Availability and the number of messages 
transmitted by AL-SBAS during year 2021. The Histogram is based on data 
from CNES site [9]. The days where no message is transmitted are not 
presented. 
For 2021, there were days and times in which the system 
did not send any messages. The AL-SBAS satellite broadcasts 
one message per second and thus the number of SBAS 
messages during a period of 24 hours is 86400 (100%).  
The total message count for AL-SBAS messages varies for 
each day of the year and (from) hour-to-hour. In particular, the 
total message count for day 22, 23, 24, 25, 82, 141 and 142 
was close to 100%.  
III. 
PURPOSE AND STUDY RESULTS 
The main purpose of this work is to test the current AL-
SBAS performance and compare these results with EGNOS 
in Algeria without Ranging and Integrity Monitoring Stations 
(RIMS).  
     The corrections of AL-SBAS and EGNOS are downloaded 
from the CNES FTP server [9]. These files are provided in the 
RINEX - B format [10]. The analysis was performed for the 
time period December 1st to 6th, 2022. 
A. Analysis Result of Satellite Status  
The augmented information related to satellite orbital and 
clock errors is calculated using MT 1, 2 to 5, 24 and 25. MT 1 
provides a Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) mask that specifies 
the PRN number of the augmented satellite.  MT 2 to 5 and 24 
provide fast corrections and User Differential Range Error 
Indicators (UDREI). The UDREI values range from 0 to 15. 
UDREI equal to 14 means that the satellite is not monitored, 
while if it is equal to 15 means that it is not used [11],  MT 24 
and 25 provide long-term correction. Histograms of UDREI 
parameters for 32 GPS satellites using EGNOS are presented 
in Figure 6.  
 
Figure 6. UDREI indicators of each satellite GPS using EGNOS. 
By analyzing the indicators of precision transmitted by 
EGNOS, we notice that these indicators vary between 5 and 
15, which means there are some satellites that are not 
monitored by the system and that the system recommends not 
to use some satellites. On the other hand, the indicators 
transmitted by AL-SBAS vary between 5 and 14, as shown in 
the histogram of the Figure 7.

B. Analysis Result of Ionospheric Error 
The ionospheric correction is calculated using the 
information from MT 18 and 26. MT 18 provides the IGP 
mask that indicates the position of IGP and MT 26 provides 
ionospheric correction GIVD (Grid Ionospheric Vertical 
Delay) and indicators GIVEI (Grid Ionospheric Vertical Error 
Indicator) for each IGP. The GIVEI values range from 0 to 15. 
GIVEI equal to 14 means that the status of the IGP is not 
monitored, while if it is equal to 15 means that it is not usable 
[12]. 
The analysis result of MT 18 and 26, which are related to 
the ionospheric error correction shows that the AL-SBAS and 
EGNOS broadcast ionospheric corrections in the area [-25, 
+25] degree in longitude and [+5 ,+50] degrees in latitude and 
[-80, +80] degrees in longitude and [+10,+85] degrees in 
latitude,  respectively. Figures 8 and 9 present the IGPs 
covered by AL-SBAS and EGNOS transmissions.

Figure 9. IGPs covered in EGNOS transmissions. 
The vertical delay and indicators transmitted by AL-SBAS 
and EGNOS for two IGP of Lat 35 N, 25 N and long 0 E are 
given in Table 3.

For the AL-SBAS system, both IGPs are used to calculate 
an augmented position, however, for EGNOS the IGPs at 25° 
range from 0 m to 63.875 m, which indicates that this IGP is 
not monitored, or it is marked Do Not Use. The GIVEI is an 
indicator of the vertical ionospheric error.  
It can be noted that for some IGP points, EGNOS cannot 
calculate the ionospheric delay, due to the lack of RIMS in 
Algeria. 
The implementation of a RIM in the country will permit 
further improvement of the corrections transmitted by the 
EGNOS system, particularly ionospheric correction [10]. 
To better analyze the impact of the reference station to 
modelling ionospheric error, a comparison of the temporal 
variation of ionospheric delay over 24 hours for IGP at 25° in 
latitude and 0° in longitude was performed. The variation of 
this correction is presented in the two Figures 10 and 11 for 
EGNOS and AL-SBAS.

For latitude 25°, it is clear to see the lack of data, related to 
the “Not Monitored” state of EGNOS, while for AL-SBAS, 
this value varies between 1 m and 9 m. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION  
Algeria 
has 
been 
developing 
a 
satellite-based 
augmentation system called Algerian Satellite Based 
Augmentation System (AL-SBAS). The service area is 
limited to Algeria and nearby countries. The AL-SBAS 
augments the GPS standard positioning service by providing 
differential GPS corrections and integrity monitoring 
information. 
The main objective of this work is to analyse and compare 
the corrections transmitted by AL-SBAS and EGNOS in 
Algeria. The major conclusions reached of the analysis 
performed are: 
• The augmentation of AL-SBAS covers the entire 
country of Algeria, while the EGNOS system covers 
only the northern part of the country. 
• Results of the AL-SBAS performance confirmed that 
ionospheric corrections from the currently available 
reference stations are more accurate than EGNOS, 
particularly in the southern part of Algeria.  
These encouraging results open the possibility of a 
better application of the Algerian SBAS corrections in the 
future. In addition, it is recommended to test the availability 
and the effectiveness of AL-SBAS corrections by using a low 
cost receiver in real time. 
As a perspective, we encourage the cooperation between 
the African air navigation services to accelerate the SBAS 
services deployment and provision to meet requirements of 
the aviation and extend the coverage of AL-SBAS system by 
adding reference stations in neighboring countries in order to 
improve the system performance.
