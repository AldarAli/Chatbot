Abstract—This paper presents a new simulator capable of 
frequency and time domain simulations for surface acoustic 
wave devices such as surface acoustic wave resonators and 
reflective delay lines. Developed within Matlab and based on 
the equations of Mason’s equivalent circuit model, the 
proposed 
simulator 
allows 
considerable 
reduction 
in 
simulation durations and does not require high computational 
resources as existing finite element model tools. It is flexible 
and reliable. Made up of only six files totalizing 40 kilobytes in 
size, the simulator can be launched on any computer running 
Matlab.

INTRODUCTION 
Surface 
Acoustic 
Wave 
(SAW) 
devices 
have 
revolutionized the domain of telecommunications by the 
possibility to design compact and low cost filters [1]. They 
are widely used as electronic filters, resonators, delay lines, 
correlators, convolvers or wireless identification systems 
integrated into modern communication systems. The 
evolution 
of 
telecommunications 
standards 
and 
requirements, especially for low-loss Radio Frequency (RF) 
filters used in mobile phones, led to the development of high 
performance SAW devices, which require flexible, precise 
and efficient models and simulation tools [2].  
Several models including the impulse model, the 
Equivalent Circuit Models (ECM) [3], the Coupling of 
Modes (COM) model [4], and the matrix models [5] have 
been proposed for SAW devices. However, only the ECM, 
the COM approach and the P-matrix model have been 
developed to maturity [6]. For its part, the impulse model is 
not reliable. Indeed, it does not take into account second 
order effects such as propagation losses, reflections and 
dispersions. 
On the other hand, some Finite Element Model (FEM) 
tools; e.g., COMSOL [7], Coventor [8], ANSYS HFSS [9]; 
provide 3D view and 3D simulation for SAW devices. 
However, the higher the number of fingers is, the longer the 
simulation duration is, and the higher the required 
computational resources are. Designers are then faced with a 
challenge to find a compromise allowing them to reduce the 
computational complexity of the desired FEM simulation. 
An alternative consists of implementing the ECM into 
computer tools such as Ansoft, Spice or ADS. But, again, the 
same problem can occur when the number of fingers is high. 
Despite that, the ECMs are particularly efficient for 
modeling the interaction between the electrical and non-
electrical components of SAW devices. The analogies 
between the electrical and mechanical elements are described 
by W.P. Mason in [10]. The ECM for one pair of fingers he 
proposed is presented in [11]. As SAW devices are generally 
composed of several periodic sections; each section consists 
of a pair of fingers; Mason’s ECM can be easily applied.  
From Mason’s ECM equations, it is possible to build, 
with Matlab, functions that compute the S-parameters of 
each section, set up the links between sections, and then 
compute the S-parameters of the entire simulated device. 
Since most of the computations can be modeled by matrix 
operations, using Matlab should reduce simulation duration. 
Therefore, this paper presents a new SAW device simulator 
based on this approach. The simulator has been implemented 
into a Matlab program to reduce the required computational 
power. 
The paper is organized as follows: Sections II and III 
describe the operating principle and the design of the 
proposed simulator. The reliability of the simulation results 
is demonstrated in Section IV. Section V highlights the main 
advantages provided by the simulator. 
II. 
MASON’S ECM AND PROPOSED SIMULATOR 
A. Mason’s ECM 
SAW resonators and delay lines are composed of three 
main components, to wit IDTs (InterDigital Transducers), 
reflectors, and propagation paths. Each IDT and reflector 
consists of several pairs of fingers. Mason’s ECMs for one 
pair of IDT fingers and reflector fingers are illustrated in   
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The ECM Mason proposed for acoustic 
propagation paths is depicted in Fig. 3 [12].

B. Proposed simulator 
The simulator was developed with Matlab Version 
7.13.0.564 (R2011b), and is dedicated to the simulation of 
SAW resonators and delay lines. The operating principle of 
the proposed simulator is shown in Fig. 4.

The major dimensions and parameters of the device to be 
simulated are first defined by the user. The simulator offers 
the possibility to run frequency domain simulations and time 
domain simulations.  
Frequency response, impedance parameters and transfer 
characteristics are provided by the frequency domain 
simulation module. These include reflection coefficient S33 
at the electrical port for SAW resonators, S21 for SAW 
delay lines, acoustic impedance and equivalent electrical 
impedance. The impulse response, which can be considered 
as a signature for SAW identification tags, is calculated by 
the time domain simulation module. 
III. 
DESIGN OF THE SIMULATOR 
The design method (see Fig. 5) is based on a modular 
approach. Each element of the simulated device is first 
represented by its Mason’s equivalent circuit. This concerns 
IDTs, reflectors and propagation paths. Electrical circuit 
equations are deducted, and then implemented into Matlab 
functions that extract the S-parameters of each block. 
Interconnects between blocks are realized by another Matlab 
function created for this purpose.

The created functions are exported into a Matlab program 
that computes the S-parameters of the entire simulated 
device and the equivalent electrical impedance. The results 
are plotted according to the frequency range set by the user. 
The time domain simulation capability of the simulator lies 
in a configurable FFT/IFFT module that predicts the 
response of the device to a user-defined interrogation signal. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The materials parameters used in the simulations are 
summarized in Table I. They can be modified by the user, at 
any time, depending on the properties of the piezoelectric 
substrate and the metallic layer of the simulated SAW 
device. The dielectric permittivity of LiNbO3 is given         
in [12] and the acoustic velocity was extracted from 
COMSOL simulation. 
A. Frequency domain 
The first simulated device is a one port SAW resonator. 
It has the same configuration as the SAW device shown in 
Fig. 5. The dimensions of each element are presented in 
Table II. The SAW device was simulated with the proposed 
simulator and then fabricated. Fig. 6 depicts a comparison 
between simulation and measurement results.  
The results demonstrate the reliability of the simulator. 
The resonance behavior predicted by the simulator matches 
well with the measurement results (see Fig. 6). For example, 
the simulator predicts a resonance frequency of 171.3 MHz 
when the measured resonance frequency 
is about           
171.4 MHz.

The SAW resonator from which the measurements were 
taken is not perfectly adapted to 50 Ω. The fabrication 
process is being improved yet.  
B. Time domain 
To demonstrate the time domain simulation capability of 
the simulator, a one port SAW reflective delay line has been 
simulated. The delay line consists of three reflectors R1, R2, 
and R3, separated by three propagation paths PP1, PP2 and 
PP3 (see Fig. 7). The dimensions are summarized in Table 
III. A short pulse of sinusoidal signal is used as 
interrogation signal.

Figure 8.  Time domain simulation capability of the simulator 
 
 
 
The time domain response predicted by the simulator is 
illustrated in Fig. 8. The output signal is composed of four 
successive short pulses resulting from reflections at the 
electrical port and on the three reflectors.  
The simulation results are compared with the expected 
results (see Table IV). The expected time delay of the 
reflection on Ri (i=1, 2, 3) is given by Ti = 2Li / v, where Li 
is the one-way path length to Ri and v is the acoustic 
velocity. Good agreement between expected results and 
simulation results are observed. 
V. 
ADVANTAGES OF THE SIMULATOR 
Several one port resonators have been simulated in order 
to observe the variation of the simulation duration with the 
number of fingers in each IDT and reflector (see Fig. 9). The 
same experiment has been carried out on some one port 
SAW reflective delay lines by varying the number of 
reflectors (see Fig. 10). The materials parameters and 
dimensions of the simulated devices are the same as those 
presented in Table I, Table II, and Table III. The simulation 
durations were evaluated with the Matlab instruction        
tic... toc.  
 
Figure 9.  Frequency domain simulation duration  
 
Figure 10.  Time domain simulation duration 
All simulations were performed using an Intel Core i5-2500 
Central Processing Unit @3.30 GHz and 16 gigabytes of 
RAM. The simulation duration increases with the number of 
fingers and the number of reflectors. Even for a one port 
SAW reflective delay line composed of an IDT with 150 
fingers and four reflectors with 20 fingers each, the 
simulation duration is less than one second. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The proposed new SAW device simulator provides a 
considerable reduction of the required computational 
resource and simulation duration. While FEM simulations 
with COMSOL, or Coventor, or ANSYS HFSS generally 
last from about ten minutes to several days [13], depending 
on the complexity of the structure of the simulated device, 
this simulator allows users to get frequency and time domain 
simulation results in less than one second.   
SAW resonators and SAW reflective delay lines have 
been simulated. The reliability of the simulator has been 
demonstrated 
by 
comparing 
simulation results 
with 
measurement results. Given that the simulation parameters 
can be easily modified and a modular approach is used, the 
new simulator should be able to simulate any SAW device 
based on the same modules.
