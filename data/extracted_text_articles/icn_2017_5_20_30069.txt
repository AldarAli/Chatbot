Abstract— Cognitive radio is a promising technology for the 
next generation of wireless networks. Performance analysis of 
multiple access protocols in cognitive radio networks has been 
presented in the literature, but only considering the unreal 
situation of perfect channel sensing. In this paper, we extend 
an analytical model previously proposed to evaluate the 
performance of a cognitive radio network using Slotted Aloha 
and CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) multiple access 
protocols. In our new model, we consider imperfect channel 
sensing, resulting in more realistic performance analysis. After 
that, we investigate the influence of the parameters related to 
the performance of the channel sensing process in the 
performance of the network.  
Keywords— Cognitive Radio; Multiple Access; Imperfect 
sensing; Throughput; Performance analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Cognitive Radio (CR) is a new paradigm for the design 
of wireless communications systems, which aims to enhance 
the utilization of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum [1][2]. 
The motivation behind CR is the scarcity of radio frequency 
spectrum due to the increase in traffic in wireless networks. 
A study made by the Spectrum Policy Task Force (SPTF) of 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has shown 
that some frequency bands are heavily used by licensed 
systems, in some particular locations and periods of time, but 
there are also many frequency bands that are only partly 
occupied or largely unoccupied [2]. A way to overcome 
these limitations is to promote changes in the current 
licensing model, by allowing secondary users (SUs) to 
access spectrum opportunities, also called spectrum holes, 
without causing harmful interference to the licensed users or 
primary users (PUs).  
Cognitive Radio is defined as a radio that can change its 
transmission parameters based on the environment in which 
it is operating. The main functions of CR include spectral 
detection, spectrum management, spectral mobility and 
spectrum sharing [2]. Its paramount objective is to provide 
adaptability to wireless transmission systems through 
Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) in order to optimize the 
performance of the system and improve the use of spectrum. 
The components of the cognitive radio network 
architecture can be classified into two groups: primary 
network and secondary network. The primary network is the 
licensed network infrastructure, which is authorized to 
exploit a certain band of the frequency spectrum. The 
secondary network is not licensed to operate in the 
designated band and its stations can access the spectrum in 
an opportunistic way, exploring the bands unused by PUs. 
Medium Access Control (MAC) is a key issue in 
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN). In the primary network, 
the MAC protocols are important in order to organize the 
access to the channel of different PUs. In the secondary 
network, the MAC protocols have the responsibility to 
organize the access of SUs to the idle channels of the 
primary network and prevent the licensed network from 
harmful interference [3]. 
In [3], the performance of CRN is analyzed for several 
MAC protocols, including the analysis that considers 
Slotted Aloha in the primary network and Slotted Carrier 
Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) in the secondary network. 
In these analyses, the capture effect is taken into account in 
the primary and secondary networks. However, the analyses 
presented in [3] do not consider the Packet Error Rate (PER) 
due to simultaneously transmission of two or more stations. 
This lack in the performance analysis has been solved by the 
extension presented in [4]. However, the analyses presented 
in [3] and [4] do not consider one important aspect, the 
imperfect sensing in the secondary network, and therefore 
can lead to unrealistic results. Thus, the main goal of this 
paper is to extend the analyses presented in [3] and [4], by 
considering the effect of imperfect sensing in the 
mathematical formulation. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in 
Section II, we present the proposal of a new analytical 
model to compute the performance of the primary and 
secondary networks considering the effect of imperfect 
sensing; Section III presents numerical results and a 
comparison between the results obtained with our model 
with the results previously presented in [4]; the conclusions 
are given in Section IV. 
II. 
THE  PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM MODEL 
In the network architecture considered in this paper, the 
primary network uses Slotted Aloha as multiple access 
protocol and the secondary network uses Slotted-CSMA. The 
primary access point (PAP) and the secondary access point 
(SAP) provide services for primary and secondary networks, 
respectively. In the primary network, there are Np PUs and,

among these, Ip stations are attempting to transmit their data 
packets during a time slot. On the other hand, the secondary 
network has Ns SUs and during a given time slot there are Js 
SUs attempting to transmit their packets [3][4]. 
A. Structure of Time Slot and Mini-Slot 
The channel is time slot based on the primary network 
and mini-slot based on the secondary network. So, each time 
slot of Slotted Aloha is subdivided into mini-slots. The 
duration of each mini-slot is equal to the maximum 
propagation delay (τ) found in the primary and secondary 
networks and corresponds to the distance from point a to b in 
Figure 1 [3][4].  
 
Figure 1. Slots structure of Slotted Aloha for primary users and Slotted 
CSMA for secondary users. 
There are two types of mini-slots: a few intended for 
carrier sensing, defining the carrier sensing period (Smi), and 
the most of them intended for packet transmissions, defining 
the transmission period (Tmi) to the SUs, as illustrated in 
Figure 1 [3][4]. According to Figure 1, the maximum sensing 
period allowed is from point a, i.e., in the beginning of a 
time slot, to point c; the sensing point is set to happen at the 
beginning of each mini-slot. The distance between point c 
and point e is specified as the maximum length of the data 
packets (Tmi) from the secondary network in terms of the 
number of mini-slots. Therefore, the packet length of the 
secondary network is shorter than the packet length of the 
primary network due to the carrier sensing period [3][4]. 
B. Fading Model for Primary and Secondary Network 
In this paper, following [3] and [4], a quasi-static fading 
model is used, according to the Rayleigh statistical model, 
wherein the instantaneous power of the received signal have 
an exponential distribution, as represented by (1): 
 
 
p(δ ) = 1
Δ e−δ /Δ.                                 (1) 
where Δ is the mean power of the received signal and δ is 
the instantaneous power of the received signal. 
C. Channel Sensing  
The spectral sensing is one of the most critical parts of 
the CRN. Before transmit, the secondary network performs 
channel sensing, which can be modeled as a hypothesis 
testing problem. We assumed that H0 denotes the hypothesis 
that the channel is inactive, and H1 denotes the hypothesis 
that the channel is active. Thus,
0ˆH  denotes the decision that 
there are not primary users in the channel and 
1ˆH  denotes the 
decision that there are primary users in the channel. With the 
result of the decision and the true nature of the activity of the 
primary network, we can define the probability of a correct 
decision about the channel when a PU is active, given by (2), 
and the probability of false alarm when the primary network 
is inactive, given by (3) [5][6]: 
Pd = Pr
⎡⎣ ˆH1 H1
⎤⎦                             (2) 
 
Pf = Pr
⎡⎣ ˆH1 H0
⎤⎦                             (3) 
D. The Interfering Model 
In the model used in [4], denominated original model, the 
sensing process is considered perfect. As a consequence, if 
the primary network uses a time slot, the SUs do not transmit 
in that slot. Thus, only other PUs can interfere with the 
transmission of a given PU. Similarly, the SUs will transmit 
only in idle slots (slots without transmission of PUs) and, as 
a consequence, only other SUs can interfere with the 
transmission of a given SU. In the model proposed in this 
paper, we consider imperfect sensing, resulting in that SUs 
and PUs can transmit simultaneously and therefore can 
interfere with each other. 
E. Traffic  Model for the Primary and Secondary Network  
During a time slot, any PU that is not in a retransmission 
state can generate a new packet with probability σp. 
Therefore, the probability that a PU does not generate any 
packet is (1-σp). If a new packet is generated in the network, 
it is transmitted immediately in the next time slot. If the 
packet is not successfully transmitted during a time slot, it is 
retransmitted with probability σp in the following time slots 
until that packet is successfully transmitted. Users in the 
retransmission state cannot generate new data packets.  
In the secondary network, using Slotted CSMA multiple 
access protocol, each SU can generate a new packet with 
probability (σmi) during a mini-slot. Consequently, the 
probability of an SU does not generate a new packet is (1- 
σmi). Whether an SU is in the retransmission state, it cannot 
generate a new packet.  In the beginning of a time slot, the 
SAP senses the channel and decides if it is idle or busy by 
the PU. If the decision is given as busy, a SU with a packet 
to transmit does not use the channel, stores the packet in a 
buffer and try again to transmit the packet in the next time 
slot. If the SAP decision regarding of the channel is idle, an 
SU with a packet to transmit has permission to sense the 
channel in the next detection point inside the carrier 
detection period. If the decision of the SU is idle, the packet 
is transmitted immediately. If the decision of the SU is busy, 
the packet is stored in a buffer and the SU attempts to 
transmit it again in the next time slot. If an SU generates a 
packet outside of the carrier detection period, this packet is 
stored and the transmission is attempted in the next time slot. 
If an SU transmits a packet and a collision occur, the SU 
goes to the retransmission state and tries to retransmit the 
packet in the next time slot. 
When the channel state is busy, the SAP and SU have 
PdSAP and PdSU as the detection probability of the channel 
state, respectively. However, if the channel state is idle, the 
82

SAP and SU have PfSAP and PfSU as the probability of false 
alarm, respectively. 
F. Probability of Secondary User Transmissions in a 
Given Time Slot 
To compute the performance of primary and secondary 
networks, we need to calculate the probability mass function 
(PMF) of the number of SUs attempting to transmit in a 
given time slot. 
The computation of the probability of Js SUs attempting 
to transmit in a time slot (Ptx(Js)) depends on the state of the 
channel. If the channel is busy, the transmission will only 
occur if the SAP miss detects the status of the channel, which 
occurs with probability 1- PdSAP, and the SU also miss detect 
the status of the channel, which occurs with probability 1- 
PdSU. If the channel is idle, the SU only transmits if the SAP 
correctly detects the status of the channel, with occurs with 
probability 1-PfSAP, and the SU also correctly detects the 
status of the channel, with occurs with probability 1-PfSU. In 
both hypotheses, channel busy or idle, this probability can be 
computed by (4), where PSAP = PdSAP if the channel is busy 
and PSAP = PfSAP if the channel is idle and PSU = PdSU
 if the 
channel is busy and PSU = PfSU if the channel is idle. 
In (4), Smi denotes the number of mini-slots that compose 
the carrier detection period, numbered from 0 to Smi-1. The 
number of stations that will detect the carrier at the 
beginning of mini-slot i is equal to the number of stations 
that generated packets during the mini-slot i-1. The stations 
that generated packets in the Smi-1 mini-slot will detect the 
carrier in the beginning of the Smi mini-slot, which already 
belongs to the transmission period. Still in (4), Bi (i = 0,1,2 
..., Smi) denotes the maximum number of stations that can 
generate packets to be transmitted starting from the mini-slot 
i; Xi (i = 0,1,2 ..., Smi) denotes the number of stations that 
effectively generated packets to be transmitted starting from 
the mini-slot i; ji (i = 0,1,2 ..., Smi) denotes the number of 
stations that missed detected the status of the channel and 
effectively transmitted starting from the mini-slot i. The 
other parameters define the limits in the sums and are 
defined in Table (1).

To validate the PMF expressed by (4), we compare the 
results obtained with the equation with the results obtained 
using Monte Carlo simulation. 
G. Power Level Applied in the Network 
Let Xp and Xs be the mean values of instantaneous power 
of the concerned packet from primary and secondary 
networks, respectively. Let Y and Z be the mean values of 
the interfering powers of one packet from the primary and 
secondary networks, respectively. Following [3], we define 
Xp=Y and Xs=Z. Having in mind that the SUs work with 
lower levels of transmission powers, in order to minimize 
interference in the PU’s, denoting the relation between the 
powers in the primary and secondary networks by γ, we 
have [3]:

H. Analysis of the Capture Effect  
 According to [7], the signals arriving at the receiver have 
different power levels due to different transmission powers 
practiced by the users and also due to the fading in the 
wireless channel.  
If the ratio between the received power of the concerned 
packet and the sum of the received powers of all interfering 
packets is greater than a given threshold, called capture ratio 
(R), then the concerned packet is captured by the access 
point. 
The capture probabilities for the primary and secondary 
networks have been analyzed in [4] considering perfect 
sensing. In this paper, we modify the analyses presented in 
[4] in order to consider the effect of imperfect sensing. 
In the primary network, if a given time slot is occupied 
by a PU, there are two scenarios in terms of interfering 
power: the SAP correctly detect the channel as occupied and 
the interfering power comes only from other PUs; the SAP 
miss detect the channel as idle and the interfering power 
comes from other PUs and also from SUs that miss detect 
the channel as idle too. In this latter case, the PMF of the 
number of SUs attempting to transmit in a given time slot is 
given by (4) considering that the channel is busy. 
Considering these scenarios, the capture probability can be 
computed by (6).

In the secondary network, if a given time slot is 
occupied by a PU, there is a transmission from SUs only if 
the SAP and some SUs miss detect the channel as idle. In 
this case, the interfering power comes from PUs and other 
SUs; the PMF of the number of SUs attempting to transmit 
in a given time slot is given by (4) considering that the 
channel is busy. On the other hand, if a given time slot is 
idle, there are transmissions from SUs only if the SAP 
correctly detect the channel as idle and the transmissions 
come from SUs that correctly detect the channel as idle; the 
PMF of the number of SUs attempting to transmit in a given 
time slot is given by (4) considering that the channel is idle. 
Considering these scenarios, the capture probability can be 
computed by (7).

Packet Error Rate Analysis 
In this paper, following [4], the PER is calculated for a 
fading channel as a function of SIR, through the use of a 
fairly accurate upper bound presented in [8]. The SIR in the 
primary and secondary networks depends on the number of 
PUs and SUs attempting to transmit and are given, 
respectively, by (8) and (9), which Ip is the number of PUs 
attempting to transmit and Js is the number of SUs 
attempting to transmit, whose PMF is given by (4).

K. The Secondary Network Throughput for the New Model  
The definition of the secondary network throughput (Vns) 
is similar to the definition for the primary network: the 
mean number of packets transmitted by the SUs and 
correctly received by the SAP during a time slot. However, 
to consider the overhead due to the detection period used by 
the CSMA protocol, it is necessary to consider an additional 
factor, which is the length of the packet in terms of mini-
slots (Tmi) divided by the total number of mini-slots used in 
the transmission process, including both transmission period 
and carrier sensing period (Tmi + Smi). The secondary 
network throughput can be computed by:  
Vns ≅

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS  
The curves presented in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 show the 
throughput for the primary network and secondary network. 
They are plotted as a function of the primary traffic load, 
defined as Gp = Npσp, considering the original model 
presented in [4] and the new model proposed here, which 
take into account the imperfect sensing of the channel. To 
compare the numerical results between the models, we 
considered the same parameters used in [4], i.e., Np=Ns=10, 
w0=3.4467, γ=10 and R=3 dB, Smi=5 and Tmi=10. For the 
new model, we set additionally the values of PdSAP, PdSU, 
PfSAP and PfSU as specified in the figures. 
In Figures 2 and 3, we plotted the throughput in the 
primary network varying PdSAP and PdSU, respectively. 
Analyzing the figures, we can conclude that the performance 
of primary network tends to decrease as the values of PdSAP 
or PdSU decreases. The results obtained with the original 
model are optimistic due to consider a perfect sensing 
process. Also, we can observe that the effect of imperfect 
sensing can not be neglected in the performance analysis of 
the system.  
In Figure 4, we plotted the throughput in the secondary 
network varying PfSAP. The performance of the network tends 
to decrease according to the value of PfSAP increase. 
Comparing the models, it is verified that the original model 
presents an optimistic result in relation to the results obtained 
with the new model. Again, the effect of the imperfect 
sensing process can not be neglected in the performance 
analysis of the system.

Figure 5. Influence of PdSU in the secondary network throughput with

In Figure 5, we plotted the throughput in the secondary 
network varying PdSU. Analyzing the figure, we can conclude 
that the performance of the network tends to decrease as the 
value of PdSU decreases. Once more, the original model 
presents an optimistic result in relation to the results obtained 
with the new model and the effects of the imperfect sensing 
process can not be neglected in the performance analysis of 
the network. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we extended the analysis presented in [4], 
considering the effect of imperfect sensing in the throughput 
of a cognitive radio network that uses Slotted Aloha and 
CSMA multiple access protocols in the primary and 
secondary network, respectively. We conclude that the 
throughput in the primary and secondary network reduces 
when we consider the effects of the imperfect sensing and, 
therefore, the effect of the imperfect sensing in the 
performance of the networks can not be neglected. Also, we 
analyze the influence of the parameters PdPAS, PdSU , PfPAS 
and PfSU   in the performance of the system. As a future 
study, one can investigate the influence of channel coding 
and cooperative sensing techniques in the performance of 
the system. Also, one can analyze the performance of the 
system in terms of delay.
