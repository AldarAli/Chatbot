Abstract—Cloud services have become more popular because
of their decreasing cost. However, it is difficult to select the
optimal cloud service because there are many services whose
service levels are different. We evaluate our proposed method
for dynamically selecting the optimal cloud services to store
data
in
a
heterogeneous
multi-cloud
environment.
The
evaluation used the SLAs of actual cloud services and the
results indicate it is possible to select a combination of cloud
services.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Cloud computing has recently become popular. Methods
involving a combination of multiple cloud services have
been proposed, [2]-[4], which provide users with more
advantages
(availability or confidentiality) than usage of
single clouds.
These methods need to select the best combinations of
cloud services. As there are many different types of cloud
services with various service levels, a wide variety of service
levels can be constructed in heterogeneous multi-cloud
environments. Especially, multiple services are used at the
same time.
We first describe the proposed method. Then, we are
quantifying the evaluation using the developed prototype.
Furthermore, we present a concrete case using actual cloud
services.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We present
the related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the
assumed environment and the proposed method. In Section
4, we show the overview of the evaluation system. In
Section 5, we describe the evaluation using actual public
cloud services implementing the prototype of this proposed
method, and evaluate the communication speed. Finally, we
conclude the paper in Section 6.

RELATED WORK
Approaches which use multiple cloud services have
been proposed to improve availability and confidentiality,
cost, performance, etc., when compared with single cloud
services. For example, DepSky [3] improved the availability,
integrity, and confidentiality of data stored in clouds. The
high-availability and integrity layer (HAIL) [6], which
accepts a set of servers to prove to clients that stored files
are complete and recoverable, was developed on links
between multiple cloud services.
Files that users want to manage in cloud storage have
properties
of
various
degrees
of
confidentiality
and
availability.
Therefore,
it
is
necessary
to
change
the
requirements per file. This means one has to reselect the best
combination of cloud per file. Cardellini et al. demonstrated
how to select the best services [10] in relation to the cost-
effective use of such services. Tsai et al. proposed a cost-
effective intelligent configuration model [11]. In addition, a
file-distribution method using a secret sharing scheme was
proposed and evaluated in a homogeneous multi-cloud
environment [12]. A data management method in this
environment was also proposed [13].
There are also security concerns about public clouds.
Cloud security in terms of data management has also been
discussed [15]-[18]. To solve one of these issues, a method
in which a system automatically selects appropriate cloud
services using a service-level agreement (SLA) written in
extensible markup language (XML) has been proposed [19].
Currently, there is no way to select and evaluate optimal
cloud services from many different clouds (heterogeneous
multi-clouds) in using multiple clouds at the same time in the
proposed environment [12][13].

PROPOSED METHOD
A. Assumed Environment
We assumed a multi-cloud environment with many
cloud-storage services in a secret sharing scheme, and all of
these services had machine readable SLAs written in XML
[12][13][22]. In this section, we introduce the proposed
method [22] which is evaluated.
Figures 1 and 2 outline the proposed method. A user
selects a set of cloud services using their SLAs depending on
the required availability, confidentiality, and cost. Then, all
combinations of cloud services are calculated by the user
requirements, and it is determined to store in cloud services.
When a file is stored in cloud services, it is distributed using
a (k, L, n) secret sharing scheme [19]. However, the user
requirement is different per file. The best combination of
cloud services is selected by calculating when a user stores
the secret information.
B. (k, L, n) secret sharing scheme
The (k, L, n) secret sharing scheme was devised by
Yamamoto [20] and is an extension of the (k, n) secret
sharing scheme presented by Shamir [21]. It can reduce the
amount of distributed information compared to the (k, n)
secret sharing scheme.
By applying the (k, L, n) secret sharing scheme to secret
information x, n pieces of distribution information are
obtained. The restoration of the information is performed by
collecting k pieces. Additionally, the data size of the
distributed information becomes 1/L times that of the secret
information. It is possible to identify part of the secret
information from many k-Ls that are less than the ks of
distributed information. Fewer k-Ls provide safety with
regard to information theory, so it is not possible to obtain
any secret information.
C. Matching user requests with cloud service levels
In the proposed method [22], user requirements are
defined using four indicators.
1) Cost: Required cost per amount data (to store 1 MB
[yen/MB])
2) Confidentiality: Risk of secret data being identified
from data stored to cloud services
3) Availability: Total operating rate [%] of multi-cloud
4) Transfer time: Upload time and download time [s/MB]
We assumed these indicators are written in SLA of cloud
services. Therefore,
we
calculate
and
select the best
combinations of cloud services using the user requests.
D. Formulas that correspond to user requests
In the proposed method, the best combination of cloud
services is selected by calculating [22].
a) Uploading
As it is necessary for users and cloud services to
communicate during uploads, availability, transfer time, and
costs are important as metrics.

b) Storing
As it is not necessary to communicate with cloud
services, confidentiality of the secret data is very important.

Confidentiality
is

to
the

As it is necessary to communicate with clouds, the

The availability in a cloud service to upload distribution
information is the probability that users can communicate

E. Relationship between the indicators and (k, L, n) secret
sharing scheme
In the proposed method [22], the combination of cloud
services is calculated by the user requirements, and secret
information is uploaded for the selected cloud services using
(k, L, n) secret sharing scheme. Table I summarizes the
relationships between the indicators and the actions.
The availability in uploading is worse when the value of n
is increasing. The total operating rate is worse because of
increasing the number of distributions. The cost in uploading
is better when the value of L is increasing, but it is worse
when the value of n is increasing. The smaller size of data
can be stored in cloud services inexpensively, but the total
cost is increasing because of increasing the number of
distributions. The transfer time in uploading is better when
the value of L is increasing, but it is worse when the value of
n is increasing. The smaller size of data can be stored in
cloud services quickly, but the total transfer time is
increasing because of increasing the number of distributions.
The confidentiality in storing is better when the value of k
is increasing, but it is worse when the value of L and n are
increasing because of equation (5).
The availability in downloading is better when the value
of n is increasing, but it is worse when the value of k is
increasing. It is necessary to collect k pieces of distribution

IV.
OVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION SYSTEM
In this section, we explain the evaluation of a method
proposed in a previous study [22] using some of the metrics
in a heterogeneous cloud environment. In the previous study,
we assumed the value of SLA for private and public cloud
services, and selected some combinations using the proposed
method.
For the result, some combinations were calculated for
some situations; highest availability, lowest cost or highest
confidentiality.
In the current study, we investigated some actual SLAs
of public cloud services. Specifically, we investigated the
SLAs of Google Drive, CloudN, KDDI, BOX, Dropbox, and
One Drive. Table II lists the SLA metrics for these cloud
services. However, these name of cloud services were
expressed from P0 to P5 in Table II for consideration to the
cloud services. In Table II, all cloud services did not provide
leakage probability and communication speed. Therefore, we
assumed the value of leakage probability based on the
description of confidentiality. We decided whether the
acquisition of security standards and the policy of security
are written in SLA of each cloud services or not.
For communication speed, we did not evaluate the
communication speed because we cannot estimate the value.
However, it is necessary to evaluate the communication
speed. Then we developed a prototype in this proposed
method and evaluated the communication speed between the
cloud services and user. Here, we use five cloud services:
Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and One Drive. For the
implementation, we use these cloud services, which provide
API. The results will be described later.
Then, Figure 3 shows the image of the evaluation model.
We
selected
the
combination
of
cloud
services,
and
determined the parameter of a (k, L, n) secret sharing scheme
using the proposed equation. In addition, we developed a
prototype for uploading and downloading the distributed data
using that parameter.
V.
ACTUAL CLOUD EVALUATION
A. Actual SLAs description and setting
Table III lists the metrics of private and public cloud
services that satisfy the actual SLAs. However, we assumed
the same value as that of the private clouds in Table III
because the actual value of private cloud is not written.
Additionally, P0 is getting the ISO 27001[23] and written the
policy of security in SLA, we assumed it is the better value
of leakage probability than other public cloud services. On
the other hand, P3 and P5 are written nothing about security.
Then we assumed these are the worse value of leakage
probability than other public cloud services.
Here, cost is defined as [yen/(month・GB)], and the user
has already contracted for all the public cloud services.
Cost = ∑
௜∈௡ Cost of Cloud୧
.
(8)
Therefore, the costs of all combinations are fixed.

All cloud services have sufficient communication speed;
therefore, we did not evaluate transfer time. The L of all
combinations was
only one. Then,
we
calculated
all
combinations of cloud services, and Table IV lists the three
unique combinations. As a result, the parameter of (k, L, n)
secret sharing scheme is (k = 2, L = 1, n = 4) or (k = 4, L = 1,
n = 4)
Combinations (p0, p1, p2, p4 in k = 2) and (p1, p2, p3,
p4) have the best availability; Combination (p0, p1, p2, p4 in
k = 2) has a lower cost than Combination (p1, p2, p3, p4).
Combination (p0, p1, p2, p4 in k = 4) has the highest
confidentiality, which is better than that of private clouds.
However, the availability of Combination (p0, p1, p2, p4 in
k=4) is the worst. This is caused by parameter k, that made
availability in downloading worse.
B. Evaluation of communication speed
Table V lists all the combinations of these cloud services.
Here, the value of n in (k, L, n) secret sharing scheme is four.
Combinations (p0, p3, p5), (p3, p4, p5), and (p0, p4, p5)
have better availability than Combination (p0, p3, p4).
Then, we measured the communication speed for each
cloud services (Table VI) and all the combinations (Table
VII). Here, the data size is 10 [MB], upload time is the
average of 10 measurements, and download time is the
average of 3 measurements. In addition, the download time
is measured for all combinations.
In Table VII, Combination (p0, p3, p4) has the best
upload time, and the combination of cloud p0 and p4 has the
best
download
time.
Therefore,
depending
on
the
combination of clouds chosen, it is possible to have a better
communication speed than using only one cloud service.
However, all of the combinations are worse upload time than
only each cloud, and cloud p3 is also worse download time.
Thus, the communication speed of some combinations is
worse than using each cloud service.
Additionally, Combination (p0, p3, p4) has the worst
availability in Table V. Combination (p0, p4, p5) does not
have a good upload time but has a good average download
time
compared
to
other
combinations.
We
need
the
communication speed of the SLA to evaluate cloud services
not only operating rate, and find the best cloud services.
However, this evaluation is one example. In the actual
situation, the best combinations can be selected by the
calculation taking into consideration the user requirements in
this proposed method.
VI.
CONCLUSION
We evaluated a method using multiple cloud storage
services in a heterogeneous cloud environment by using
concrete values of three metrics. We found that some
combinations of cloud services were more useful compared
to only one private cloud service. All combinations had both
advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, we found that the
communication speed is necessary for the new evaluation
value. However, we only implemented the prototype. In the
future, we need to implement the actual system.
