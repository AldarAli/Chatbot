Abstract— This paper investigates the applicability of an
intuitive advertising system for large indoor environments
using Visible Light Communication (VLC). This VLC based
positioning system includes the use of the visible light signal to
light the space and to transmit the information for positioning
of travelers and of advertising campaigns in the surroundings.
An LED-assisted positioning and navigation VLC system is
proposed. A VLC scenario for large environments is analyzed,
the
emitters
and
receivers
are
characterized
and
the
communication
protocol
presented.
Different
layouts
are
investigated. Square and hexagonal meshes are tested and a 2D
localization
design,
demonstrated
by
a
prototype
implementation, is presented. The key differences between
both topologies are discussed. For both, the transmitted
information,
indoor
position,
path
direction,
as
well
as
bidirectional communication are determined. The results
showed that the LED-aided VLC navigation system makes
possible to determine the position of a mobile target inside the
network, to infer the travel direction as a function of time and
to interact with the information received.

INTRODUCTION
Advertising is used to stimulate market demand. The
purpose is to transmit the right message to the right receiver
at the right time, as well as the collection, understanding and
decoding of the message in a proper manner. Usually,
advertisement signs are used to communicate, and they are
placed in geographically identified areas in order to capture
customers' attention. The most obvious method of using
signs is through billboards located in high traffic areas.
Indoor billboards are designed in order to attract the
attention of those moving past the sign. Handheld devices
make up the growing mobile device market. Such devices
allow customers to stay informed, gather information and
communicate with others without being tied to a physical
location and offer significant opportunity for marketers to
reach customers at anytime and anyplace. Also, with
geographic positioning features included in newer mobile
devices, the medium has the potential to provide marketers
with
the
ability
to
target
customers
based
on
their
geographic location.
Airports are among the largest shopping centres. They
must satisfy high service requirements. Business travellers
have all the information concerning their flight on their
boarding pass. With a clearly arranged Web interface, they
can see the most frequented areas inside an airport and can
take action if certain areas become overcrowded, meaning
that those places can be highlighted on an interactive map.
Additionally, it is also an advantage if the shopping function
is complemented by other features, for example, if the
customer could be informed about the current waiting times
or be given recommendations.
Nowadays, indoor positioning methods are mainly
based
on
Wi-Fi
[1],
Bluetooth,
Radio-Frequency
Identification
(RFID)
[2]
and
Visible
Light
Communications (VLC) [3]. VLC is a data transmission
technology [4] that can easily be employed in indoor
environments since it can use the existing LED lighting
infrastructure with simple modifications [5][6]. In this paper,
we propose the use of modulated visible light, carried out by
white polychromatic low cost LEDs. This means that the
LEDs are useful twofold by providing illumination as well
as communication. The use of white polychromatic LEDs
offers the possibility of Wavelength Division Multiplexing
(WDM), which enhances the transmission data rate. A
WDM receiver based on tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin
light controlled filter can be used [7][8] to decode the
received information. Here, when different visible signals
are encoded in the same optical transmission path, the
device multiplexes the different optical channels, performs
different filtering processes (amplification, switching, and

wavelength conversion) and finally decodes the encoded
signals recovering the transmitted information.
Research is still necessary to design LED arrangements
that
can
optimize
communication
performance
while
meeting the illumination constraints for a variety of large
indoor layouts. The main idea is to divide the space into
spatial beams originating from the different light sources,
and identify each beam with a unique timed sequence of
light signals. Fine-grained indoor localization can enable
several applications in airports, supermarkets and shopping
malls. Information on the exact location of products can
greatly improve the customer's shopping experience and
enable customer analytics and marketing [9].
In
this
paper,
an
LED-assisted
positioning
and
navigation VLC system is proposed. The paper is organized
as follows. After the introduction (Section I), in Section II, a
VLC scenario for large environments is established, the
emitters
and
receivers
are
characterized
and
the
communication
protocol
is
presented.
In
Section
III,
different layouts are analyzed. Square and hexagonal
meshes
are
tested
and
a
2D
localization
design’
demonstrated by a prototype implementation, is presented.
The key differences between the two topologies are
discussed. For both, the transmitted information, indoor
position,
path
direction
as
well
as
bidirectional
communication are determined. Finally, in Section IV,
conclusions and future trends are addressed.
The proposed LED aided system involves wireless
communication, smart sensors and optical sources network,
building up a transdisciplinary approach framed in cyber-
physical systems.

SYSTEM DESIGN
A.
VLC Scenario
The indoor environment chosen is an airport and two
topologies were considered: the square for the main hall and
the hexagonal for the marketing zones. The reported plan
and the proposed scenario are presented in Figure 1. Here, a
user navigates from outdoor to indoor. The user sends a
request message to find out what gate he/she is boarding at,
and in the available time until boarding, he/she adds
customized points of interest, routes from restaurants, shops,
and halls within the airport. The requested information is
sent by the emitters from the ceiling to the receiver. The
traveler is equipped with a receiver. After the check-in at the
main airport entrance, the user passes through airport
security and, depending on the available time until boarding,
he/she can go directly to the gate or shop, eat or rest. After
registration, he/she sends to the central controller a message
request in order to add, in the available time, customized
points of interest, routes from restaurants, shops, gates, halls
to boarding or the right track. On his path, the passenger is
advised how to reach its destination and the possibility to
use location based advertising (available selection of goods
advice and restaurants).

The Emitters for Large Environments
LED bulbs, at the nodes of the network, act as
transmitters,
broadcasting
the
information.
An
optical
receiver extracts its location to perform positioning and,
concomitantly, the transmitted data from each transmitter.
To synchronize the signals from multiple LEDs, the
transmitters use different IDs, allowing the signal to be
reconstructed at the receiver.
Ceiling plans for the LED array layout are shown in
Figure 2. Two topologies were set for the unit cell: the
square, (Figure 2a) and the hexagonal (Figure 2b). Red (R;
626 nm), Green (G; 530 nm), Blue (B; 470 nm) and violet
(V; 390 nm) LEDs, at the nodes of the network, are used
[10][11]. In both topologies, each node, Xi,j, carries its own
color, X, (RGBV) as well as its ID position in the network
(i,j). In both, the grid sizes were chosen to avoid overlap in
the receiver from adjacent grid points. To improve its
practicality,
the
tested
geometric
scenario
in
the
experimental results uses a grid in smaller size (with 2 cm
between adjacent nodes).
For
data
transmission,
commercially
available
polychromatic white LEDs were used. On each node, only
one chip is modulated for data transmission. To receive the
information from several transmitters, the receiver must be
positioned where the irradiated circles from each transmitter
overlap, producing at the receiver, a multiplexed (MUX)
signal
that,
after
demultiplexing,
acts
twofold
as
a
positioning system and a data transmitter. The generated
regions, defined onwards as footprints, are pointed out in
Figure 2 and reported in Table I.

The device receives multiple signals (footprints), finds
the centroid of the received coordinates and stores it as the

The receiver
The
VLC
photosensitive
receiver
is
a
pinpin
photodetector based on a multilayer hetero-structure, p-i'(a -
SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n sandwiched between two transparent
contacts [8]. The device offers high sensitivity and linear
response, generating a proportional electrical current. Its
quick response enables the possibility of high speed
communications. The device operates within the visible
range using, for data transmission, the modulated light
supplied by the RGBV LEDs transmitters. The generated
photocurrent is processed using a trans-impedance circuit
obtaining a proportional voltage. The voltage is then
processed,
by
using
signal
conditioning
techniques
(adaptive bandpass filtering and amplification, triggering
and demultiplexing), until the data signal is reconstructed at
the data processing unit (digital conversion, decoding and
decision) [12].
D.
The OOK Modulation Scheme
An on-off keying modulation scheme was used. To
create a communication protocol to ensure the required
system
performance
and
overcome
the
technology
constraints, a 32 bits data frame was designed.

topology; R-1,-1 ; G0,-1; B1,0 and V0,0 are the transmitted node
packet from the array in the network. A stop bit is used at
the end of each frame. The first five bits are used for time
synchronization. The same synchronization header [10101],
in an on-off pattern, is imposed simultaneously to all
emitters. Each colour signal (RGBV) carries its own ID-
BIT, so, the next bits give the coordinates of the emitter
inside the array (Xi,j). The cell’s IDs are encoded using a
binary representation for the decimal number. In the square
topology (Figure 3a), six bits are used: the first three for the
binary code of the line and the other three for the column. In
the hexagonal topology, 60º Cartesian coordinates were
applied (Figure 2b). An extra bit was added at the beginning
of the binary code to represent the number's sign: setting
that bit to 0 is for a positive number, and setting it to 1 is for
a negative number. The remaining bits in the number
indicate the absolute value. So, the next eight bits (ID) are
assigned, respectively, to the x and y coordinates (i,j) of the
emitter in the array (Figure 3b). For both, the last bits in the
frame are reserved for the message sent by the Xij node
(payload data). With this information, the method will give
an exact, unique answer, i.e., the location of the receiver in
the array (Xi,j).
Results show that, in the square network, R1,2 , G1,3, B2,2
and V2,3 are the transmitted node packets, in a time slot,
from the unit cell where the restrooms are located (Figure
2a). In the hexagonal network, the nodes R-1,-1, G0,-1, B1,0 and
V0,0, located in the first ring of the restaurant zone (Figure
2b), are the transmitters.

The data acquisition was obtained with the presence of
environment light. The bit sequence (on the top of the figure)
was chosen to
allow all
the sixteen possible on/off
combinations of the four input channels (24).
Results show that the code signal presents as many
separated levels as the on/off possible combinations of the
input
channels,
allowing
decoding
the
transmitted
information [12]. All the ordered levels (d0-d15) are pointed
out at the correspondent levels and are displayed as
horizontal dotted lines. On the right hand side, the match
between MUX levels and the 4 bits binary code assigned to
each level is shown. For demonstration of the decoding
technique, a signal received in the same time frame in #1, is
also added (dotted curve). Comparing the calibrated levels
(d1-d15) with the different assigned 4-digit binary code, the
decoding is straightforward. Each decoded message also
carries the transmitter’s node address. So, the next block of
six bits, in the square topology (or eight in the hexagonal
one), gives de ID of the received node.

Travel direction
To compute the point-to-point along a path, we need the
data along the path. The input of the aided navigation
system is the coded MUX signal, and the output is the
system state decoded at each time step (t). As a proof of
concept, in the lab, a navigation data bit transition was
tested by moving the receiver along a known pattern path. In
this example (Figure 5), at t1, the user enters the hall by line
#9, goes to position #1 at t2 and chooses the boarding
terminal or the marketing zones at t3, being directed into one
of the three indicated directions (A # 7; B # 3 or C # 5).
The results show that, as the receiver moves between
generated point regions, the received information pattern
changes. Between two consecutive data sets, there is a
navigation data bit transition (channel is missing or added).
We observe that, when the receiver moves from #9 to # 1
(Figure 5), two different ID channels are added (B2,4 and
V2,3). Here, the 4-binary bit code has changed from [1100]
to [1111].
In Figure 6, a path crossing the hexagonal topology is
also tested. Here, the receiver enters the restaurants area

Taking into account Figure 2b and the frame structure

at #4 [1110]/ R-1,-3 G-2,-3 B-1,-2. At t2, it arrives at #5 [1111]/
R-1,-3 G-2,-3 B-1,-2. V0,-2, and then, at t3, it moves towards #3,
[1011]/ G-2,-3 B-1,-2. V0,-2.
The main results from both topologies show that fine
grained
localization
is
achieved
by
detecting
the
wavelengths of the received channels in each region. The
location and path of a mobile receiver was obtained based
on the LED-based navigation system. In an orthogonal
layout (hall), the square topology is the best. It allows
crossroads and the client can walk easily in the horizontal,
vertical, or both directions. In concentric layouts, to fill all
the space with hexagons presents advantages (restaurants,
and shops areas). Here, the client can move around and walk
between the different rings toward the outside region.
C.
Bidiretional communication
Bidirectional communication between VLC emitters
and receivers in a handheld device can be established
through a control manager linked to an indoor billboard.
Each ceiling lamp broadcasts a message with its ID and
advertising, which is received and processed by the receiver.
Using a white polychromatic LED as transmitter, the
receptor sends to the local controller a “request” message
with its location (ID) and adds its needs for the available
time (payload data). For route coordination, the local
controller emitter sends the “response” message.
In Figure 7, the MUX signal assigned to a “request”
and a “response” message are displayed. At the top, the
decoded information is presented. On the right side, the
match between the MUX signal and the 4-binary code is
pointed out. Here, in a time slot, the traveler, in position #3
(R3,2 , B2,2), sends to the central controller the message
“request” in order to add the points of interest (boarding or
the right track). After that, it is advised through a “response”
message, that the request was received, how to reach the
destination
in
time
and
how
to
use
location
based
advertising.

intended and finally in the last block appears the requested

[000000] responds to a request of a passenger located in
position # 3 (R3,2, B2,2) and sends back the requested
information.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
An LED-assisted navigation system for large indoor
environments was proposed. For lighting, data transmission
and positioning, white LEDs were used. A SiC optical
MUX/DEMUX mobile receiver decodes the data and based
on the synchronism and ID of the joint transmitters it infers
its path location, timing and user flows.
A VLC scenario for an airport was established and the
communication
protocol
presented.
The
bi-directional
communication between the infrastructure and the mobile
receiver was analysed. Two cellular networks were tested
and compared: square and hexagonal. The main results
show that, for both topologies, the location of a mobile
receiver, concomitant with data transmission is achieved.
The LED-aided VLC navigation system makes possible to
determine the position of a mobile target inside the network,
to infer the travel direction as a function of the time and to
interact with the received information.
Minding the benefits of VLC, it is expected that this
type of communication will have an important role in
positioning
applications.
Moving
towards
real
implementation, the performances of such systems still need
to improve. As a future goal, we plan to finalize the
embedded application for experimenting in several network
layouts. Effects such as synchronization, shadowing and
ambient light noise will be minimized by distributing
lighting
sources
(MIMO
techniques)
to
optimize
the
coverage.
