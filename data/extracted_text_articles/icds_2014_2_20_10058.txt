Abstract -The paper describes how users in a small transitional 
country perceive open government data. It discusses the 
objectives of opening government data to the public, considers 
what end-users require, and investigates impediments to end-
user’s adoption of open data. The results reveal the following: 
end-users are generally unprepared to use open data; they 
have no confidence in the credibility of published data; end 
users do not differentiate between open data and private data; 
they are not familiar with the purpose of open data and 
opportunities arising from using them. Finally, the paper 
discusses possible government measures to boost open data 
usage. The following measures are proposed: a single open 
data portal should be organized; data suppliers should be 
stimulated to publish, certify and maintain their open data; 
and end-users should be encouraged to use the data. 
Keywords-open data; open government data 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The concept of open data has existed for some time. It 
corresponds to open movement, such as open access to 
scientific information, open source software etc. In this 
paper, we shall mainly consider government data (GD), also 
referred to as public sector information (PSI). Government 
bodies collect, produce, reproduce and disseminate public 
data in many areas of activity while accomplishing their 
institutional tasks. These data, such as geographical 
information, statistics, weather data, transportation data, 
public health data, etc. are of public interest, belong to the 
whole community and every citizen is entitled to know and 
use them. Government data could be opened for re-use by 
citizens, business and industry, science, media, civil society 
and others. The benefits of opening government data are 
numerous, even it is impossible to predict what value it will 
create in the future [1]. 
To achieve their full potential, government data must be 
open. Making data open could enormously increase civil 
sector engagement. An effective public information system 
should include a considerable amount of open government 
data and be equipped with efficient tools for data analysis 
and visualization. 
The paper describes the position and the early experience 
of an open data initiative in a small transitional country (the 
Republic of Croatia with about 4 million inhabitants). It 
discusses the objectives of opening government data to the 
public, considers what end-users require, investigates 
impediments to end-user’s adoption of open data, and 
possible government measures to boost open data usage. It is 
organized as follows. The definition and types of open data 
are discussed in Section II, end-users’ requirements as seen 
by the average user are described in Section III, the main 
impediments to citizens’ adoption of open government data 
are considered in Section IV, and possible government 
measures for boosting the usage of open data are described in 
Section V and summarized in Section VI. The findings listed 
correspond to the specific situation of a smaller community, 
in the grip of recession and not too enthusiastic about 
opening government data. 
II. 
DEFINITION OF OPEN DATA  
Formal definitions of open data are relatively new. Open 
Data Institute [2] defines open data as information that is 
available for anyone to use, for any purpose, at no cost. 
OpenDefinition.org [3] defines open data as data that can be 
freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone. 
Private data, i.e., sensitive personal data, cannot be the 
subject of open data. There is no consensus on what 
constitutes private data, and the debate on the subject 
continues.  
Two most prominent types of open data are open science 
data and open government data. 
Open science data (OSD) are freely available, allowing 
any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, 
index, use by software or use for any other legal purpose. 
When the data are reproduced or distributed the copyright 
must be acknowledged, author’s control over the integrity of 
their work must be preserved and the work must be cited. 
Public availability and reusability of scientific data leads to 
transparency, fairness and increased quality of science. Open 
science data are creating value in science itself. 
The same is true for open government data (OGD), 
which we are considering in the paper. Open government 
data are data produced by government or its bodies, that can 
be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone, resulting 
in a fairer and better government. As discussed in the 
literature [1], [11], [13], reasons for making data open 
include: (a) transparency and accountability, (b) innovation 
and economic development; and (c) inclusion, empowerment 
and law enforcement.

A. Transparency and Accountability 
Open data increase transparency. Free access to 
government data can empower citizens to exercise their 
democratic rights [11]. Consequently, transparency increases 
the accountability of government and its bodies. It is 
reasonable to expect that they will make better decisions in 
the public interest. The focus is on the political domain. 
Open data create value in government itself by increasing its 
efficiency. 
B. Innovation and Economic Development 
Open data may enable innovators to improve services or 
build new products and services within public or private 
sector. Open data may shift certain decision making from the 
state into the market [1]. The key focus is on the economic 
domain. Open data create value in many ways, for example 
by helping create new products or services in places where 
they are missing, including the development of new products 
built directly on PSI [13]. 
A type of open data, which may be considered as OGD in 
a very broad of sense, is open business data (OBD). The key 
focus is also on the economic domain. The source of data is 
the business sector. Examples include data collected at the 
chambers of commerce or trade, statistical or marketing 
agencies or in corporations that are willing to open their data 
to general public. 
C. Inclusion, Empowerment and Law Enforcement 
The motivation to open government data is to involve 
citizens in policing and law enforcement [11]. Open data 
may remove power imbalances that resulted from 
asymmetric information, bring new actors in the political 
debate, especially those with special interests or needs. The 
key focus is on the social and law domain. 
III. 
USER REQUIREMENTS ON OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA 
Who are the typical stakeholders and users of open data? 
They are not a uniform group of people who share the same 
urge and interest to access data. In [5] they are classified as 
public 
sector, 
private 
sector, donors, 
civil 
society 
organizations, academia, civil hackers, and media, depending 
on their role in open data initiatives. Based on data driven 
classification [5] they are classified as data producers, data 
consumers, data intermediaries and data specialists. The 
Table I presents the different types of stakeholders, based on 
their expected main roles and tasks. 
What do users, i.e., data consumers, expect from open 
data? They want to have access to (a) all types of useful data, 
(b) in a single place, (c) that the data are easily accessible, 
(d) appropriately described and interpreted, and (e) free or 
almost free. The findings are based on a number of 
unstructured interviews with potential users, and public 
consultations with non-governmental organizations, business 
sector and academia, both of which were conducted in the 
preparatory phase of the Croatian government’s e-Citizen 
project [23]. Then established, the Open Government 
Partnership helped to define the expectations from open data.  
A. All Types of Useful Data 
Users will access the data they need for various purposes. 
Each users’ community is unique in its own way and has its 
own needs and priorities in accessing data. We are discussing 
data consumers’ needs and priorities in Croatia. Although a 
member state of the EU from July 2013, Croatia is in many 
aspects a transitional state. The needs and priorities of data 
consumers in transitional states may be different from the 
ones in highly democratic EU member states. 
The Croatian Parliament recently adopted the new Right 
to Information Act [15], aligned with the PSI Directive [16], 
and a process of alignment with the PSI Directive revision 
[17] is also planned to be accomplished in next two years. 
The Open Government Partnership Action Plan for the 
implementation of the Open Government Partnership 
initiative in Croatia 2012-2013 [24] has also been created. 
Consequently, according to the Right to Information Act and 
other regulation acts, e.g. Public Procurement Act, State 
Budget Act, etc., a number of datasets has been made 
available to the public. Open government data web portal is 
not yet available, although it is being developed [25].

Although citizens are increasingly aware that greater 
government transparency and accountability are necessary, 
government is still not transparent enough. According to the 
results of online interviews with individuals working in 
public administration in Croatia, most of them are willing to 
provide open data to the public.  
The state suffers a long recession. The society is 
encumbered by corruption (Croatia is ranked 62nd according 
to the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions 
Index [18]). Opening data to the general public is therefore 
crucial and of highest priority.  
All reasons to make data open apply as we need to 
achieve (a) transparency and accountability, (b) innovation 
and economic development; and (c) inclusion, empowerment 
and law enforcement. Most Croatian citizens list these goals 
in the same order. 
B. In a Single Place 
Users will prefer to access open data through a single 
neutral place, i.e., a web portal, where they can find all the 
available open data. The neutral place, web portal, may be 
owned by government but it must not mirror any kind of 
politics, government bodies’ relationships, election cycles 
and other obstacles which will prevent users from trusting 
open government data. 
Who owns and maintains data is a very important 
question. The owner or steward of open data could be either 
a web portal or a public (government) agency. Stewardship 
of open data is particularly important as it manages the 
quality and timeliness of open data and related metadata.  
Following legal requirements, the Croatian Parliament 
recently set up the position of Information Commissioner 
[19] whose expected involvement in the implementation of 
open data will raise confidence, at least in the case of 
Croatia.  
The Croatian Government additionally investigated the 
treatment of public data by public authorities and was able to 
prove that it is essential to develop a single open data portal. 
Since a single public administration portal is being built 
under the domain gov.hr as a one-stop-shop for all users, it 
would be logical to have open data published under the same 
domain, for example, data.gov.hr. This would be in line with 
similar naming practices for national portals in the EU and 
the rest of the World (e.g. data.gov.uk, data.gov.it, data.gv.at, 
data.gov, etc.).   
A useful model for using and managing a web portal is 
shown in Fig. 1 [6]. The model consists of the data user 
finding data, the data portal acting as single point of access 
to open data; and the data supplier producing and collecting 
data. The left-hand side of the Fig. 1 shows the model of 
direct data provision. The data supplier produces data and 
collects them (1) at the data portal. The data are published on 
the data portal (2) and located at the data portal. Users find 
(3) and obtain (4) data from the data portal. The right-hand 
side of the Fig. 1 shows the model of indirect data provision. 
The data supplier produces, collects and publishes data (1). 
The data are located at the data supplier but the metadata are 
collected and located at the data portal (2). At the data portal, 
users find (3) data obtained (4) by the data supplier. 
In both models, metadata are located at the data portal 
making data retrievable through the data portal. In direct data 
provision model the data are settled at the data portal, and in 
indirect model at the data supplier. Both models can be 
implemented on the same data portal, leaving data suppliers 
to choose between the direct and indirect model of collecting 
data or metadata. 
After starting open data initiative the majority of the open 
data will be governmental data. There are a lot of data 
outside governmental sources that may be opened. For 
instance, business data collected at the chambers of 
commerce or trade could be opened. In a small community, 
such as a city, county or even a small country like Croatia, it 
may be appropriate, at least for budgetary reasons, to have a 
single place to access all open data. 
C. Easily Accessible and Linkable to Other Data 
In addition to access through a single web portal, the ease 
of access is of crucial importance. Open data are easily 
accessible if users can approach all open data through a 
central metadata portal. It is essential that the metadata portal 
represents the full repertoire of open data consistently and 
clearly. A good proposal for metadata repertoire and 
classification of themes covered by open data is described in 
[5]. 
Most of current OGD portals make data available to users 
of the web portals as downloadable files in formats such as 
pdf, xls, csv, xml, json etc. Making data available as linked 
data (LD) through RDF model and RESTful APIs or 
SPARQL search interfaces is not so common although 
linked data offers the best practices for publishing and 
linking data on the web. 
To benefit from open data, it is important to allow linking 
disparate open data sets. The linked open data (LOD) can 
serve as a platform for new knowledge and can enable new 
services or applications. Services and application are easier 
to develop in a LOD environment. Tim Berners-Lee, initiator 
of linked data, suggests a five stars classification scheme for 
open data: 
 
one star: Information is available on the web in any 
format under an open license 
 
two stars: Information is available as structured data 
(e.g. in Excel instead of an image scan of a table) 
 
three stars: Information is available in non-
proprietary formats (e.g. csv instead of Excel) 
 
four stars: URI identification is used so users can 
point at individual data

five stars: Data are linked to other data to provide 
context. Network effect is achieved. 
Achieving full benefit of linked open data can be 
obtained in the following steps: (a) Analyzing and cleaning 
data, modeling them by choosing established vocabularies, 
conversion data to RDF [7], (b) creating an unifier resource 
identifier (URI) for each data object, (c) choosing 
appropriate vocabularies for open data or creation of own 
vocabulary, (d) specification of licenses for re-using data, (e) 
conversion to RDF. Before publishing, data may be linked to 
other data, which may increase their value. 
The three stars level is considered the minimum for the 
release of government data for re-use: non-proprietary, 
machine readable, and accessible via the web. Benefits of 
linked open data, which are data with four and five stars, 
include possibilities of linkage to them from any other place, 
possibilities of bookmarking them and re-using parts of 
them. 
D. Appropriately Described 
Data should be thoroughly described in order to explain 
the problem or area to which they relate. The open data 
description includes metadata described in user’s words 
explaining objects, attributes and relationships between data. 
The purpose of data initially collected should be explained, 
i.e., why the data are collected, the context of the data 
collection, possible applications of data, for what purpose 
data should not or cannot be used, etc. The data should be 
declared not to violate privacy principles. Raw data should 
include full details explaining what the data relates to, how 
they were collected, who collected them, and how they are 
formatted. 
Data consumer should be aware that re-use of open data 
should acknowledge the source of data.  
E. Free or Almost Free 
Access to open data should be free. Price of Internet 
access should be acceptable to all classes of users. 
IV. 
IMPEDIMENTS TO CITIZENS’ADOPTION OF OPEN 
GOVERNMENT DATA  
The impediments to adoption of open government data 
are many, from political and social to technical. The paper 
presents a number of impediments to adoption of open 
government data. The evidence was collected by observing 
the process of opening the data in Croatia [15], [23], [24], 
[25] and from discussions with potential open data 
consumers. Our findings were compared to experiences 
accompanying open data initiatives in the EU, predominantly 
in the UK [10]. The majority of impediments noted are quite 
the same as in communities that have overcome the initial 
steps in opening data. The presented impediments are listed 
in the natural order, from those conceptual to technical. Here 
are, in our opinion, the most significant impediments: 
(1) Some citizens do not know or they do not feel that 
they have the right to seek public information from 
government and its bodies. 
(2) Many citizens are not familiar with the concept and 
importance of open data. The same findings are seen 
in advanced communities, such as in the UK where 
Open data dialogue report [10] finds that participants 
of the dialogue “found the concept of open data to be 
abstract and relatively hard to engage with”. 
(3) Most citizens cannot precisely differentiate between 
public and private data. 
(4) Many citizens do not feel that seeking public 
information will make any difference in practical 
problem solving in their community.  
(5) In some, less developed communities, citizens do not 
have complete confidence in the published public 
data. 
(6) Many citizens do not express an interest in 
personally exploring datasets. Rather they are more 
interested in the results and implications of 
researching open data. The principal benefits of open 
data are seen to be for researchers rather than the 
public [10]. 
(7) Many citizens lack computer knowledge to access 
open data, and have difficulties in understanding 
forms and formats of published data. 
(8) Many citizens experience the web portal of open 
government data as not user friendly enough, but 
only appropriate for computer specialists who are 
able to work with csv, json, ogd, txt, xls and other 
formats. 
The conceptual impediments (1-5) show that citizens 
need to become more strongly aware that they have the right 
to use public data, to enhance their data understanding and 
their belief in the data. Technical impediments (6-8) show 
that citizens need to acquire technical skills to access and use 
the data, or that data should be displayed in a technically 
acceptable manner. 
V. 
GOVERNMENT MEASURES FOR BOOSTING THE USAGE 
OF OPEN DATA 
To overcome any of previously mentioned impediments 
and boost the usage of open government data, one or more 
measures can be implemented. The proposed measures have 
been derived from experiences accompanying open data 
initiatives abroad [8], [9], [11], [12] and in Croatia (e.g. 
e-Citizen project [23], which represents a continuation and 
the improvement of the public reform process started in 
Croatia in the last decade; and Open Government Partnership 
[21], [24], which additionally helps to streamline priorities of 
opening public processes). The measures are listed in the 
natural order, as the measures on the conceptual level (1-11) 
and the measures on the technical level (12-15): 
(1) Governments often act as secrecy keepers, not 
openness leaders. In all countries studied [11], the 
closed government culture is detected as the barrier 
to opening data. Government should define a 
strategy to change its culture by looking at the 
experiences of leading governments, following 
various global, regional, citizens’ or market 
initiatives, 
implementing 
EU 
directives 
or 
monitoring activities on open data. 
(2) Government should provide a useful definition and 
explanation of both public and open data that is 
36

ICDS 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Digital Society

 
accepted by law, administration and citizens [8]. A 
kind of consensus is needed.  
(3) In all countries the tensions between open data 
policy and the privacy of citizens are recognized 
[11]. Therefore, the difference between open and 
private data must be clearly defined and explained.  
(4) In less developed communities the general public 
should be educated that it has the right to seek public 
data. By whom? Self-education, appropriate civil 
society activities, and clever government initiatives 
should change the situation. Imposing proper 
licensing may help [8] in understanding the right to 
public information. 
(5) Marketing of open data is poor. Citizens and 
interested parties are not sufficiently informed on 
government’s activities on opening data. The civil 
society and government itself should do their best to 
market open data; explain pros of using and re-using 
open data. 
(6) In addition to standard marketing of open data, 
government should educate citizens to understand 
and use data [8]. Sharing useful stories and cases of 
successful open data usage would be helpful. Similar 
goals have been set in the Open Data Support project 
[20]. It should open a channel for communicating 
users’ ideas, proposals for improvement of data or 
publishing 
new 
data, 
useful 
successful 
or 
unsuccessful cases, impediments etc. through social 
media or forums. Publisher of open data must be 
prepared to respond to users’ communication. 
(7) Users should be attracted by selecting high value 
datasets. Datasets may be considered to be of high 
value if they satisfy the following criteria: data 
publication is mandatory by law (e.g. regulated by 
acts, directives, tenders or budget data); the data 
result from a primary governmental activity (such as 
health, transportation, financial data); the high level 
of preparedness of data (already online, such as 
weather data), or data of high value in general (such 
as business data). The focus should be on local, 
specific issues to raise interest for open data, at least 
at the moment of introducing open data [8]. 
(8) Non-governmental 
organizations, 
charity 
organizations and business associations have to be 
involved in open data initiatives [8], [21]. 
(9) Governments should act like product developers and 
measure the outcome of their activity. Open data 
needs to be a product that will improve transparency, 
accountability, economic, social and other aspects of 
community. 
(10) Government should clearly define and explain to 
users the difference between public data and private 
data. Personal data should be confidential, and must 
not be violated in any way, such as by combination 
of related datasets. Misunderstanding open data as 
an attack on privacy prevents full adoption of open 
data. Government should define and explain to users 
what open data as opposed to private data are. 
(11) In communities where citizens do not have full 
confidence in the published public information, data 
openness 
should 
be 
governed 
through 
an 
independent body.  
(12) The quality of open data is often questionable or 
below acceptable limits to permit the publication of 
data. Even in countries with experience in open data 
initiatives it is reported [9] that “information is often 
treated as a black box in the open data movement, 
information is often seen as a given, used 
uncritically, and trusted without examination, open 
data was collected or created for other purposes, it 
substantial risks for validity, relevance, and trust.” 
When publishing open data, government has to 
ensure their quality. Data should be checked for 
inaccuracies before being opened. 
(13) Since many citizens and other users are not keen on 
personally exploring datasets the web portal should 
be equipped with as many data applications as 
realistically possible. A proper user friendly 
interface would be a catalyst of using open data. 
(14) The open data territory in not yet standardized to an 
acceptable level. The open data portal should use the 
accepted standards, and reduce number of used 
formats to the smallest number possible. Its 
graphical interface should be user friendly. The 
classification of themes covered by the open data 
portal should be adjusted to the interests of data 
consumers and dependent on local circumstances. 
(15) The quality of published data may vary from dataset 
to dataset. New practice of datasets certification such 
as by Open Data Institute [12] may help “data users 
to understand its quality, licensing, structure, and its 
usability, publishers understand how they can better 
connect with their users, etc.” Certification may be 
localized, which is better than no certification at all. 
VI. 
SUGGESTED ACTIONS  
A general strategy of opening government data should be 
concentrated on actions in the following areas:  
(1) Organizing a single open data web portal (a) 
supported by adequate technical and organizational 
infrastructure, (b) by monitoring activities on the 
portal and constant analysis of data usage in order to 
be constantly improved,  
(2) Stimulating data owners or data suppliers to publish, 
certify and regularly maintain their data; and 
(3) Encouraging end-users to use open data (a) 
considering users’ feedback using forums or other 
appropriate tools, and (b) stimulating end-users or 
data suppliers to develop applications on open data 
and publish results based on processed data. 
All of the actions above represent a challenge. They need 
to be well planned, performed, monitored, analyzed and 
continually improved.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The key dimensions of implementing open government 
data as outlined by OECD [14] include challenges related to 
policy, technology, financing, organization, culture, and 
legal frameworks. Addressing these challenges is essential in 
a small transitional community, e.g., Croatia, if we are to 
create an ecosystem, and build sustainable business models 
for OGD initiatives that can generate the desired benefits. If 
not properly tackled, these challenges might obstruct or 
restrict the capture of benefits of national efforts aimed at 
spurring OGD. 
Additionally, participation of Croatia in the Open 
Government 
Partnership 
has 
already 
helped 
non-
governmental organizations, charity organizations and 
business associations to be involved in open data initiatives.  
On the other hand, there are many successful examples of 
countries which succeeded in opening data. Learning from 
these 
examples 
could 
streamline Croatia to 
faster 
achievement of better results in this area. It has been 
proposed that additional support be given to the already 
established collaboration of all interested parties and that 
already proven technical solutions be reused [22] in order to 
start with the open data portal in a short period of time. 
The paper presented the position and early experience of 
an open data initiative as seen by end-users in a small 
transitional country. The future work may consider 
monitoring the development of the users’ perspective on 
open 
government 
data, 
discuss 
development 
and 
implementation of measures for boosting the usage of open 
data, analyze the results of their implementation, and 
compare the results with solutions in other countries or 
communities.
