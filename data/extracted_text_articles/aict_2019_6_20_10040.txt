I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, with the rapid development of wireless 
communication technology, various communication services 
are deployed, but as the communication traffic volume 
increases, frequency bands available for communication are 
being exhausted. Therefore, studies on VLC technology 
using Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are under way [1][2]. 
This is because LEDs have features, such as high-speed 
responsiveness, low power consumption, and ease of 
dissemination due to low cost [3]. 
However, depending on the frequency characteristic of the 
LED, the usable bandwidth is limited, and it is difficult to 
obtain enough communication speed. Therefore, a VLC 
technique utilizing an OFDM scheme capable of improving 
frequency utilization efficiency has been studied. Here, the 
OFDM scheme is commonly adopted in wireless systems, 
Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), Long Term Evolution (LTE), 
Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial (DVB-T), etc., due to 
its great advantage of high spectrum utilization that is about 
twice the spectral efficiency of a single carrier scheme.  
The OFDM scheme, however, requires highly accurate 
OFDM symbol synchronization, and if the synchronization is 
not performed accurately, demodulated data will be collapsed 
because of losing orthogonality between subcarriers. 
Therefore, ordinary OFDM receivers for burst packet 
transmission systems, such as the 802.11 Wireless Local Area 
Network (WLAN) systems, acquire symbol synchronization 
in the preamble period and retain synchronization by using 
correlation of Guard-Intervals (GIs). On the other hand, 
continuous (non-burst) transmission 
systems, such as Digital TeleVision (DTV) systems, acquire 
symbol synchronization mainly by using correlation of GIs, 
because those systems cannot employ preamble scheme [4].  
As OFDM signal is essentially a sum of multiple subcarrier 
signals aligned in frequency domain, its probability density 
function in time domain resembles Gaussian distribution. The 
CAZAC precoding makes time-domain signal of M-ary 
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) OFDM signal 
into time-domain signal of M-QAM single-carrier signal with 
some phase rotation [5] - [9]. This single-carrier wave-form 
in OFDM with CAZAC precoding, CAZAC-OFDM, enables 
superficially normal data output through the FFT and the 
CAZAC decoding even though the FFT processing executes 
by using sample points over two adjacent OFDM symbols, 
although the output data becomes a value of incorrect signal 
point in the M-QAM constellation. Among various input 
data, null data is still null at the output ports of the CAZAC 
decoder, and if we allocate null data at a fixed position in the 
OFDM symbols, we can estimate the deviation from the 
aureate symbol timing position by checking the null data 
port-number of the CAZAC decoder.  
In this paper, we propose a new technique of symbol timing 
estimation for visible light communications using CAZAC-
OFDM scheme, which enables to avoid the use of the 
preamble and guard-intervals. In the case of visible light 
communications, which is one of typical Line-Of-Sight 
(LOS) communications, it is not necessary to employ the GI 
aiming at preventing interference between adjacent OFDM 
symbols because we do not need to consider multipath 
channels. Moreover, the GI has a demerit of leading to a 
decrease in data rate. 
By simulations, we have acquired an accurate OFDM 
symbol synchronization after checking only two symbol size 
of FFT points with arbitrary start timing, even though those 
stride over two adjacent OFDM symbols. Here, we used only 
one null data per one OFDM symbol, and did not use a 
preamble or guard interval. Therefore, our symbol 
synchronization technique makes it possible to maximize 
throughput of visible light OFDM systems.  
The remainder of this paper is organized into sections as 
follows: Section 2 gives an overview of symbol 
synchronization in a conventional OFDM scheme and 
Section 3 gives an overview of CAZAC-OFDM. Section 4 
presents the proposed scheme that makes use of the features 
of CAZAC-OFDM and Section 5 presents the performance

evaluation and simulation results of the proposed scheme. 
Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6. 
II. 
VISIBLE LIGHT OFDM  
A. Visible Light Communication (VLC) 
Visible light communication is a communication 
technology utilizing light visible to the human eye. 
Communication is enabled by modulating this visible light. 
The transmitted light is received by a light receiving element, 
such as a photodiode, and the data is reproduced by 
demodulating. As a light source, LEDs are mainly used for 
their characteristics, such as high-speed responsiveness and 
low power consumption. Also, since LEDs are widely used 
as lighting in various places in everyday life, visible light 
communication using LEDs is expected because existing 
infrastructure equipment can be used for communication as it 
is. 
B. OFDM scheme 
The OFDM scheme is a type of multicarrier modulation 
and is a scheme in which data is divided into several 
subcarriers and transmitted in parallel. 
On the transmission side, data is divided into N data by 
serial-parallel 
conversion, 
quadrature 
modulation 
is 
performed, and data is transmitted on different carrier waves. 
At this time, Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) is 
performed after primary modulation of the data sequence. An 
input signal after mapping by primary modulation is defined 
as X (length N), and a nth OFDM time signal corresponding 
thereto as x[n] is defined as  
             𝑥[𝑛] = 1
𝑁 ∑ 𝑋[𝑘]𝑒𝑗2𝜋
𝑁 𝑘𝑛
𝑁−1
𝑘=0
 
(1) 
where 𝑋[𝑘]  is the frequency-domain signal, and N is the 
number of subcarriers. After IFFT, a guard interval is inserted 
and the OFDM symbol is generated. 
On the receiving side, the data is restored by demodulating 
the signal by the reverse procedure of the transmitting side 
using the corresponding n subcarriers. 
Also, in the frequency domain, since the peak values of the 
respective subcarriers are arranged to satisfy mutual 
orthogonality, it is possible to efficiently use the frequency 
band and send the data. 
C. Symbol synchronization 
In the OFDM scheme, when FFT processing is not 
performed at the correct position, the data collapses on the 
receiving 
side. 
Therefore, 
highly 
accurate 
symbol 
synchronization is indispensable for demodulating data. 
There are mainly two symbol synchronization methods in 
the OFDM scheme [4]. 
As shown in Figure 1, by using the fact that the correlation 
value becomes maximum when the signal matches the known 
sequence, the head of the symbol is detected, and 
synchronization is enabled. 
 
Figure 1. Symbol synchronization method using preamble 
 
As shown in Figure 2, the other is a synchronization 
method that is performed by autocorrelation using guard 
intervals.  
 
Figure 2. Symbol synchronization method using Guard Interval 
 
This is since the rear part of the symbol is copied and added 
to the head and the correlation with the waveform delayed by 
the original one symbol length is maximized, the beginning 
of the symbol is detected, and synchronization can be 
performed. 
III. 
CAZAC-OFDM 
The CAZAC sequence is also called a constant amplitude 
zero auto-correlation sequence, and is a sequence having 
characteristics that the amplitude is constant in both the time 
domain and the frequency domain [5]. 
The OFDM scheme precoded using this CAZAC sequence 
is called CAZAC-OFDM. In the OFDM precoding process, a 
Zadoff-Chu sequence, which is one type of CAZAC sequence, 
is used. 
The Zadoff-Chu sequence 𝐶(𝑘) is defined as 
        𝐶(𝑘) =
{  
  exp (𝑗 𝜋𝑟𝑘2
𝐿
)                     ∶ 𝐿 is even
exp (𝑗 𝜋𝑟𝑘(𝑘 + 1)
𝐿
)         ∶ 𝐿 is odd 
 
(2) 
             𝑘 = 0,1, … , 𝐿 − 1 
 
where 𝐿  is the sequence length, 𝑟 is the sequence number, 
and 𝑟 takes an arbitrary integer value prime to 𝐿. In this case, 
when CAZAC precoding is used for OFDM, the sequence 
length 𝐿 is a power of 2. The reason for this is based on the 
FFT size in OFDM. 
Therefore, if 𝑟 = 1 and 𝐿 = 𝑁2 in (2), since 𝐿 is an even 
number, the Zadoff-Chu sequence 𝐶(𝑘) can be expressed as 
(3).

                𝐶(𝑘) = exp (𝑗 𝜋𝑘2
𝑁2  )   
(3) 
             𝑘 = 0,1, … , 𝑁 − 1 
 
 
From (3), CAZAC precoding is expressed by (4) using 𝑁th 
order complex square matrix 𝑀 . Here, the matrix 𝑀  is 
obtained by rearranging (3) in the row direction. 
     𝑀 = 1

⋯
⋯

⋱
…
⋮
𝑐𝑁2−1
] 
(4) 
On the transmission side, precoding is performed by 
multiplying the matrix of (4) with the mapping data before 
IFFT, so that a time signal in CAZAC-OFDM can be obtained. 
The signal 𝑋′after CAZAC precoding in the case where the 
data string to be transmitted is 𝑋 = [𝑋0, 𝑋1,⋅⋅⋅, 𝑋𝑁−1 ]  is 
given by (5). 
      𝑋′ = 𝑀 ⋅ 𝑋

(5) 
Since IFFT processing is performed on this equation, the 
time signal 𝑥(𝑛) of CAZAC-OFDM of the nth sample after 
the IFFT can be finally defined as (6) [5]. 
              𝑥(𝑛) = 𝐶(𝑁
2−𝑛)𝑚𝑜𝑑(𝑁) ⋅ 𝑋(𝑁
2−𝑛)𝑚𝑜𝑑(𝑁) 
(6) 
Therefore, the signal point at this time is as shown in 
Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3. Time domain Signals of OFDM and CAZAC-OFDM 
 
From Figure 3, it is confirmed that the waveform of the 
time signal of CAZAC-OFDM is obtained by phase-rotating 
the value of the mapping data, and the amplitude becomes 
constant as compared with ordinary OFDM. 
Also, from (6), the relationship between the symbols 
before and after the CAZAC precoding and the IFFT 
processing on the transmission side is shown in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4. Symbol configuration before and after  
 
From Figure 4, it is confirmed that the positions of the 
values before and after the CAZAC precoding and the IFFT 
processing are exchanged and uniquely determined. Also, 
before and after CAZAC decoding and FFT processing on the 
receiving side, they are exchanged in the same way. 
In the symbol synchronization method proposed in this 
paper, we use the characteristics where this value is swapped. 
IV. 
PROPOSED METHOD 
A. Proposed symbol composition 
In the ordinary OFDM scheme, symbol synchronization is 
performed by using correlation characteristics of preamble 
and guard-interval. However, we do not need to consider the 
multipath environment in visible light communication, so we 
assume that the guard-interval, which is originally intended 
to absorb delayed waves due to multipath, is unnecessary. 
Therefore, utilizing the characteristics of the transmission 
waveform by CAZAC precoding, symbol synchronization is 
achieved by inserting null data instead of guard-interval on 
the transmitting side and detecting null on the receiving side. 
Therefore, the configuration of the symbol is as shown in 
Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5. Proposed symbol composition 
 
Here, one symbol is composed of 64 subcarriers, one null 
for synchronization and one pilot signal are inserted in the 
last part of the symbol in the time domain. We consider that 
at least one is enough to detect nulls, so the number of nulls 
inserted is one. 
In the ordinary OFDM scheme in wireless communication, 
four pilot signals are inserted, but this time we have proposed 
one symbol configuration. The reason is that the main role of 
the pilot signal is phase correction and amplitude correction, 
and usually we do not consider that the amplitude and phase 
rotation abruptly change in a short period of symbol time, so 
we think that enough estimation and correction are possible 
by taking the moving average of the pilot signal.

Here, the symbol configuration before and after 
modulation on the receiving side is shown in Figure 6. 
 
 
Figure 6. Symbol configuration before and after 
CAZAC decoding and FFT. 
 
As shown in Figure 6, when CAZAC decoding and FFT 
processing are performed on the receiving side, the null data 
is outputted with the value being 0 being replaced with the 
center position. 
By utilizing this fact, synchronization is enabled by 
detecting the null and correcting the position of the FFT 
processing. 
B. Null detection and synchronization method 
In the ordinary OFDM scheme, there is a problem with 
data collapsing when FFT points stride over two adjacent 
OFDM symbols. Even though we insert nulls on the sender 
side, we cannot detect nulls without accurate synchronization 
and FFT processing at the correct position. Therefore, highly 
accurate timing estimation is necessary, and FFT processing 
cannot be performed at an arbitrary timing. 
However, in CAZAC-OFDM, even though FFT points 
stride over two adjacent OFDM symbols, data does not 
collapse, and the values of signal points at different points are 
output. Among them, null data is output as it is null and the 
direction and amount of deviation from the proper 
synchronous position can be accurately detected from the 
output port number. 
Here, in FFT processing the received data, the case where 
it is performed at the correct position and at an arbitrary 
position are shown in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7. FFT points position 
 
Here, ① and ③ are cases where FFT processing is 
performed at the correct position, and ② and ④ are cases 
where FFT processing is performed at an arbitrary position. 
Moreover, ① and ② are ordinary OFDM scheme without 
CAZAC, and ③ and ④ are CAZAC-OFDM with CAZAC. 
The output of two symbols after FFT processing at this time 
is shown in Figure 8. The waveform is the absolute value of 
the value of the data. 
 
 
Figure 8. The contents of data in two symbols after FFT 
 
As shown in Figure 8, since FFT processing is performed 
at the correct position in ① and ③, the output data does not 
collapse and outputs completely the same value, and the null 
is output to the place of X (33). 
It can be seen that, if the FFT processing is performed at 
an arbitrary timing in the output of ② in the ordinary OFDM 
scheme, the data collapses and the magnitude of the 
amplitude becomes uneven. Also, the null inserted on the 
transmitting side is completely collapsed, it cannot be 
detected, and synchronization cannot be performed. 
However, in the proposed method with CAZAC, even 
though FFT processing is performed at an arbitrary position 
that is not a correct position, the data does not collapse, and 
the data is exchanged between the symbols, but the null data 
is output as null. Also, from Figure 6, since the positions of 
the values before and after the CAZAC decoding and the FFT 
are uniquely determined, by comparing with the position of 
the null after performing the FFT processing at the correct 
position, we can estimate the deviation. 
Here, in ④ in Figure 8, nulls are output at the location of 
X (10), so it is seen that the FFT points are shifted by 24 
samples as compared with the place of null in ③. 
Therefore, in the proposed CAZAC-OFDM, it is 
unnecessary to estimate the timing of highly accurate 
symbols before performing FFT processing, and even though 
FFT processing is performed at arbitrary timing, highly 
accurate synchronization is achieved. 
Detection of null is done by minimum value judgment, as 
follows: perform CAZAC decoding and FFT processing at an 
arbitrary timing, and then take the absolute value and make 
the minimum value determination. Since null has a value of 
0 and no data other than null has a value of 0, null can be 
reliably detected by performing the minimum value 
determination. 
However, this is a case of a communication environment 
in an ideal state, and some noise occurs in actual 
108

communication. When noise is added, data other than null 
may be detected by the minimum value determination, 
making it difficult to detect the correct null. 
Therefore, before the minimum value judgment is made, 
the system configuration is constructed in which the value of 
the flowing data is accumulated in the section where one 
symbol and the minimum value judgment is made for the 
cumulative sum. As a result, even though the detection of the 
null is mistaken for the data of one symbol, the accuracy of 
detection of the null can be improved by accumulating the 
data of the next symbol. 
We provide an example to explain the minimum value 
judgment when two symbols are accumulated after adding 
noise. The waveforms of (a) and (b) of Figure 9 are obtained 
by dividing the received data for two symbols into data for 
each individual symbol. When the minimum value is 
determined for each piece of data, the position of the 
minimum value is detected. Here, the correct detection 
position of this null is assumed to be the 26th position. In (b), 
the position of the minimum value is the 26th position and 
the null detection succeeds, whereas in (a) the position of the 
minimum value is the 18th position, and the null detection is 
incorrect. 
As described above, when noise is added, the detection of 
null may fail in the minimum value determination with only 
one symbol. To solve this, take the cumulative sum. Figure 
10 shows a waveform of a data value obtained by taking the 
cumulative sum of two symbols. 
When accumulating the data values of (a) and (b) in Figure 
9, it becomes as shown in Figure 10, the minimum value 
clearly appears and the detection of null succeeds.

Therefore, even though the detection of the null is 
mistaken for the data of one symbol, the accuracy of detection 
of the null can be improved by accumulating the data of the 
next symbol.

one null and one pilot. From this result, it is understood that 
the error rate, which is the reproducible range, falls within the 
range of 10−3 or less when SNR is 16 or more. 
Even though the receiving side performs FFT processing 
at an arbitrary timing, null is instantaneously detected by the 
minimum value judgment, and the cutout position of the FFT 
points is corrected. Therefore, it can be confirmed that the 
BER characteristic almost agrees with the value shown in 
Figure 12 regardless of the timing at which the FFT 
processing is performed. 
C. Simulation result (Null detection success rate) 
Figure 13 shows the detection success probability of null 
when simulated with the specifications in Table 1. Here, for 
detection, we compared the detection success probabilities of 
nulls when the minimum value judgment is performed on the 
cumulative sum for one symbol and two symbols, giving 
three symbols. 
 
 
Figure 13. Comparison of null detection success probability 
 
From the result of Figure 13, when null detection was 
performed only for one symbol, the probability of success 
became 100% when the SNR was 20 or more. Likewise, in 
the case of the cumulative sum of two symbols, the success 
probability became 100% when the SNR was 16 or more, and, 
in the case of the cumulative sum of 3 symbols, the SNR was 
13 or more. 
From this result, it is found that the detection success 
probability of null improves as the number of symbols to be 
accumulated increases. Therefore, it was confirmed that 
highly accurate synchronization can be achieved by 
increasing the number of symbols required for detection even 
in an environment with great influence of noise with low SNR. 
Moreover, from the results in Figure 12, SNR was 16 or 
more in the proposed method where the error rate falls within 
the range of 10−3 or less. Therefore, when the SNR is 16 or 
more, the detection success probability becomes 100% when 
the number of symbols to be accumulated is at least two. 
From the above results, it was confirmed that highly 
accurate symbol synchronization can be performed without 
failure by judging the cumulative sum of the two symbols by 
the minimum value. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we show that the amplitude of the OFDM 
signal is constant by using CAZAC precoding and inserted 
null data can be extracted as null. Also, we verified that null 
data can be extracted without corruption even though FFT 
points that stride over two adjacent OFDM symbols. We 
verified that, by using this characteristic, it is possible to 
perform synchronization with enough performance after 
checking only two symbol size of FFT points with arbitrary 
start timing.
