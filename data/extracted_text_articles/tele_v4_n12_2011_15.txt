Abstract - This paper presents a comparison of the channel
properties for the DRM+ (Digital Radio Mondiale, Mode E)
radio system in the frequency Bands II and III for mobile
reception. The impact of different transmitting frequencies and
receiver velocities is analyzed by simulations of the system
performance with different channel proﬁles. A closer view is
taken on the upper bounds of receiver velocities as this is
the main problem for proper reception at higher frequencies.
Additionally, measurements of the DRM+ system in the VHF-
Bands II and III are presented to analyze and compare the
performance in the real-world. The theoretical work show that
reception is possible up to receiver velocities of around 200
km/h in Band III in a worst case scenario. The measurements
show comparable results for Band II and III.

I. INTRODUCTION
DRM+ is an extension of the long, medium and short-
wave DRM standard up to the upper VHF band. Field
trials with DRM+ were conducted in Hannover [1] and
Kaiserslautern [2] in Band II and in Paris in Band I. It has
been approved in the ETSI (European Telecommunications
Standards Institute) DRM standard [3] for frequencies up to
174 MHz. In Germany and other countries the VHF-Band II
(87,5-108 MHz) is fully occupied by FM-radio, which will
not be switched off in the next years. At the same time,
in Band III, which allocates the frequencies from 174 to
230 MHz, there is a lot of free spectrum intended for audio
broadcast, therefore evaluations about the use of DRM+ in
Band III were started. In Band III DRM+ can coexist with
the multiplex radio system DAB (Digital Audio Broadcast),
offering local radios a cheap and ﬂexible possibility to
digitize their signals, which is hardly possible with DAB
due to its multiplexed structure [4].
Section II in this paper gives a short introduction to
the DRM+ system parameters. Evaluations of the channel
properties, simulations of the effects of mobile reception
for different receiver velocities at different frequencies are

presented in Section III and Section IV gives a comparison
of measurement results in Band II and III. Section V gives a
conclusion of the possibilities and limitations of the DRM+
system in the VHF-Band III from 174-230 MHz.
II. DRM+ SYSTEM PARAMETERS
The DRM+ system uses Coded Orthogonal Frequency-
Division Multiplex (COFDM) modulation with different
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) constellations as
subcarrier modulation. The additional use of different code
rates result in data rates from 37 to 186 kbps with up
to 4 audio streams or data channels. A signal with a low
data rate is more robust and needs a lower signal level for
proper reception. Table I shows the system parameters in an
overview.
In order to improve the robustness of the bit stream
against burst errors, bit interleaving and multilevel coding
is carried out over one transmission frame (100 ms) and
cell interleaving over 6 transmission frames (600 ms).
In the simulations and the measurements 16-QAM sub-
carrier modulation with a code rate of R0 = 0.5 (protection
level 2) resulting in a bit rate of 149 kbps was used.
III. IMPACT OF THE MOBILE CHANNEL
The following Section gives an overview of the channel
properties at different frequencies and receiver velocities and
how they can effect the reception.

A. Channel properties
To analyze the performance of the system at different fre-
quencies and receiver velocities, simulations were conducted
with a rural channel, implemented as a tapped delay ﬁlter as
described in [5] and shown in Figure 1. The complex output
signal r(t) is generated as shown in Equation 1.
r(t) =
NT
X
k=1
Gk(t)m(t − τk).
(1)
With the complex input signal m(t), the relative path
delays τk and the path process Gk(t). |Gk(t)| follows a
Rayleigh distribution, the phase follows a uniform distribu-
tion, every path is characterized by a Doppler spectrum and
a certain attenuation. In case that all waves are arriving from
all directions at the receiving antenna with approximately the
same power the real Doppler spectrum can be approximated
by the Jakes spectrum:
Pd(f) =
A
q
1 − ( f
fd )2
for
|f| ≤ fd
(2)
For propagation paths with large delay times for example
the ’Single Frequency Network’ used in Section III-D, the
Gaussian spectra are used. They are deﬁned with the help
of the Gaussian function:
G(f, A, f1, f2) = Ae
− (f−f1)2

The spectra denoted by ’Gauss1’ and ’Gauss2’ consist of a
single Gaussian function and are deﬁned as [3]:

for a ’rural’ channel. A set of other channels is given in the
DRM ETSI Standard [3].
B. Inter-Carrier-Interference
A moving receiver causes Doppler shifts of the OFDM
carriers. If this is combined with multipath propagation,
paths from different directions can cause frequency de-
pendent Doppler shifts, which results in Inter-Carrier-
Interference (ICI). This interference can be handled as
additional near-Gaussian noise [6]. In [7] upper bounds of
the normalized interference power for a classical (Jakes)
channel model depending on the maximum Doppler shifts
(fd) and the symbol duration (Ts) are given as
PICI ≤ 1
12(2πfdTs)2.
(5)
The Doppler shift increases with increasing carrier fre-
quencies f0 and receiver velocities v as fd = f0 · v
c ·cos(α),
with the speed of light c and the angle between the direction
of arrival and the direction of motion α.
The effect of ICI power was added as an additional noise
relative to the signal amplitude in function of the receiver
velocity for an angle α = 0 as the worst caste scenario
when the receiver is moving directly towards or away from
the transmitter on a radial route.
Additionally to the averaged Bit Error Rate (BER) the
BER with a service availability of 99 % was plotted. In [8]
a ’good’ mobile reception is deﬁned as having a coverage
of 99 % of the locations. The simulation was conducted
with 100 channel calls. Every call loads a random set of

path processes, which stands for a different set of multipath
components, that can be seen as different locations. An
approximation of the 99 % coverage probability can be
calculated as the average of the (in this case) 99 simulation
calls, having the lowest BER. With every call 120 frames
(12 sec. of data) containing a pseudo-random bit sequence
were ﬁltered by the tapped delay ﬁlter, decoded and the BER
was calculated.
C. ICI in a ’rural’ channel
Simulations were conducted with a ’rural’ channel proﬁle
for receiver velocities from 100 - 300 km/h. It’s parameters
are given in Table II.
Figure 2 shows the simulation of the performance of a
DRM+ system in Band III (200 MHz). For comparison
Figure 3 shows the results for Band II (100 MHz). The BER
for a coverage probability of 99 % is plotted together with
the values for 100 % for receiver velocities from 100 to
300 km/h. In [9] a BER of 10−4 is given as a value where
a proper reception is still possible in a DRM system. The
simulation results show that at 100 MHz a signal to noise
ratio (SNR) of 20 dB is necessary to reach this value at a

A ’Single Frequency Network’ of two transmitters
velocity of 100 km/h. For 300 km/h a SNR of 22.5 dB is
necessary. At 200 MHz and 100 km/h the necessary SNR
stays the same as at 100 MHz. Stepping up the receiver
velocity, the impact of the ICI increases faster. In Band III
at 150 km/h a SNR of 22.5 dB is necessary, at 200 km/h
the BER of 10−4 is hardly achieved with around 30 dB. At
higher velocities this scenario doesn’t achive a bit error rate
of 10−4.
The coverage probability has no big effect on the system
performance within the analyzed velocities. At a frequency
of 100 MHz and the lowest velocity, small differences
can be seen at high SNR values, at 200 MHz there are
no differences between the full coverage and a coverage
probability of 99 %. This shows that the coherence time of
the channel at these frequencies is short enough (for 150
km/h it is 0.072 sec. at 100 MHz and 0.036 sec. at 200
MHz) that the average over the simulation time stays nearly
the same. The deep fades are short enough that the cell- and
bitinterleaver can handle them. Simulations carried out with
low receiver velocities as shown in Section III-E showed
more differences between the full coverage and a certain
coverage probability.
D. ICI in a ’Single Frequency Network’ channel
A special case of propagation occurs in a ’Single Fre-
quency Network’ (SFN) as shown in Figure 4. It represents
a network of transmitters sharing the same radio frequency
to achieve a large area coverage. As shown in Table III the
delays are in the range of several hundreds micro seconds
representing signals arriving from the different transmitter
stations in the overlapping area.
Simulation were conducted with a ’Single Frequency
Network’ (SFN) channel proﬁle for receiver velocities from
50 - 200 km/h. Figure 5 shows the worst case performance of
a ’Single Frequency Network’ at a frequency of 200 MHz.
It can be seen that for a receiver velocity of 150 km/h a
slightly higher SNR is needed as for 100 km/h to get a bit
error rate below 10−4. For 200 km/h it is still possible to
get a proper reception, but more ﬁeld strength is needed.
E. Slow and ﬂat fading
For low receiver velocities in Band II slow fading over
the whole signal bandwidth can lead to deep fades, lasting

longer than the cell interleavers time (600 ms). This can
result in signal dropouts as there is no chance to recover
the signal by the following error correction. As a shorter
wavelength results in a higher spatial resolution of the
interference pattern in the air, the coherence time becomes
smaller, which results in less dropouts due to slow fading.
Figure 6 shows a comparison of the system performance
with a slowly moving receiver at 10 km/h for frequencies
of 100 and 200 MHz. The performance is enhanced by the
higher frequency. Additionally an error probability of 95 %,
calculated as described in Section III-B, is plotted. The dif-
ferences between full ’coverage’ and a coverage probability
of 95 % in this slow channel exceed the differences in
the fast channel clearly, especially for the lower frequency.
The reason for this are the higher spatial resolution of the
interference patterns of the ﬁeld strength in the air. Mov-
ing through this interference patterns, the resulting signal
dropouts are shorter with higher frequencies, the interleaver
and error correction can work.
F. The pilot grid
For channel estimation DRM+ uses pilots, that are dis-
tributed diagonally over the frames [10]. As shown in
Figure 7 the pilots are inserted on every fourth subcarrier
and every four symbols. As described in [11], the maximum
Doppler frequency a system can handle depends on the pilot
grid in time direction.
Considering the symbol duration of Ts=2.5 ms, in time
direction, the channel is measured every 4 ∗ Ts=10 ms
resulting in a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. To satisfy
the sampling theorem the maximum Doppler frequency fd,
which is the reciprocal of the channels coherence time, has
to fulﬁll the condition: fd < 50 Hz. At 100 MHz this value is
achieved at a velocity of 540 km/h, at 200 MHz at 270 km/h.

IV. MEASUREMENTS IN BAND II AND III
In winter/spring 2010 DRM+ measurements were con-
ducted at 95.2 MHz (Band II) and 176.64 MHz (Band III)
in the city of Hannover and its surroundings. The transmitter
was located at the roof of the university building at a height
of 70 m over the ground. Both in Band II and III an
ERP (Effective Radiated Power) of 30 W was transmitted
with directive yagi antennas with nearly the same radiation
pattern, so that in the main beam the results of the coverage
measurements are comparable. The transmission content was
generated with a Fraunhofer Content Server and consisted
of an audio stream with a bit rate of 103.6 kbps and a
pseudo-random bit sequence with 45.4 kbps, to measure the
Bit Error Rate (BER). The transmitter equipment consisted
of a modulator from RFmondial, an ampliﬁer from Nautel
for Band II and a Thomson linear ampliﬁer for Band III.
The measurements included the ﬁeld strength, which was
recorded with an Rhode & Schwarz test receiver (ESVB), the
audio status and BER of the receiver (RFmondial software
receiver) and the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), calculated
via the time correlation/synchronization.

Measurement results in Band III
A. Measurements in an urban environment
To test the reception in an urban environment measure-
ments were conducted in the inner city of Hannover. As this
area is located in the main beam of the transmission the re-
sults for Band II and III are comparable. The measurements
were conducted at a velocity of around 15 km/h on the same
route.
In Figures 8 and 9, the results are shown over the time.
In the ﬁrst row the ﬁeld strength is plotted. Additionally the
mean ﬁeld strength (mean fs) and the standard deviation
of the ﬁeld strength (std fs) are inserted in the Figures.
This shows that the ﬁeld strength in Band II is slightly
higher than in Band III, the standard deviation is a bit lower
in Band III which can be caused by differences in slow
and ﬂat fading. The second row shows the BER, which
is slightly lower in Band III than in Band II. The third
one shows the calculated SNR which is higher in Band
III. As at the time of the measurement in Band III only
block 12A (around 223 MHz) is used for DAB in the region
of Hannover, this could be caused by less interferences. In
Band II interferences from other FM transmitters can effect
the reception and degrade the SNR. The last row shows the
status of the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of the Fast
Access Channel (FAC), the CRC of the Service Description
Channel (SDC) and the audio decoder errors (0: errorfree, 1:
one or more CRC/audio frames corrupted). Here some more
errors show up in Band III. On the whole at both frequencies
the reception was nearly the same.
B. Measurements of the coverage limit
Additional measurements of the coverage limit were con-
ducted on a highway leaving the city in the main beam and
passing rural area and some villages. In the maps in Figure
10 and 11 the audio status is plotted.

Measurement results in Band II
While the reception in the open (ﬂat) environment is still
good, errors came up passing villages. Compared to Band
III, in Band II some more errors occurred while leaving the
city of Hannover and in the village before Sehnde. Here
due to a four-lane road velocities up to 100 km/h could be
driven. This could be caused again by higher interferences
with FM in Band II.
V. CONCLUSION
Evaluations of the channel properties in Band III for a
DRM+ system show that the main problems using the system
at higher frequencies are the Inter-Carrier-Interference and
the density of pilots needed for the channel estimation.
Simulations of the systems performance in a ’rural’ chan-
nel, including the effects of ICI as noise in function of the
receiver velocities, show no differences between Band II and
III for a velocity of 100 km/h. At velocities up to 200 km/h
the reception was effected by the ICI but still sufﬁce the
bit error rate necessary for proper reception. In Band II
reception was still possible at 300 km/h, in Band III with
velocities higher than 200 km/h, the BER exceeds the value
necessary for proper reception in the evaluated worst case
scenario.
The simulations of a ’Single Frequency Network’ at a
frequency of 200 MHz show a similar result. Reception is
possible up to receiver velocities of 200 km/h.
To fulﬁll the sampling theorem for the pilots that have to
be sampled for the channel estimation, in Band III a Doppler
shift corresponding to a receiver velocity of 270 km/h should
not be exceeded.
Regarding slow and ﬂat fading, which appear at low
receiver velocities in a multipath environment, the shorter
wavelength in Band III can reduce the problem as the
interference pattern has a higher spatial resolution. As a

result, a receiver is passing the deep fades in a shorter time
and the interleaver and error correction can work.
The measurements conducted in Band II and III show no
big differences. While measuring the coverage limit, less
errors were recorded in Band III, which can be caused by
less interferences in Band III in Hannover.
A real speed test could not be conducted due to speed
limits. As the ICI only becomes a problem when different
carriers are effected by different Doppler shifts due to
multipath propagation, this tests should be made in a region
with obstacles in the countryside. The region of Hannover
is a quite ﬂat area.
