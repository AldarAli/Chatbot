Abstract—Aging 
populations 
are 
putting 
a 
strain 
on 
professional care facilities. Technology can ease this strain while 
at the same time improving the quality of life for senior citizens. 
Using robotic home companions and utilising sensors to monitor 
and improve the life of seniors, it is possible to help caregivers 
target their efforts to be more effective. It is important to 
observe privacy concerns while developing these technologies to 
ensure acceptance by the end users. In this work, we provide an 
overview of such technologies already in place and discuss their 
limitations. This is done by surveying relevant literature. 
Findings show that the available technologies are still far from 
solving the current challenges.  
Keywords-quality of life; senior citizens; ambient assisted 
living; companionship. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
According to researchers like Prince et al. [1], it is 
estimated that 5-7% of the elderly population (≥60 years) of 
each world region has dementia. In 2021, more than 55 
million people suffered from this disease, with an expected 
increase to 78 million in 2030 and 139 million in 2050. In 
addition to these findings, Alzheimer Nederland [2] estimates 
that around 290,000 people have dementia in the 
Netherlands, 95% of whom are above 65 years of age.  
The increasing number of elderly caused by the aging 
population will only increase the number of elderly patients 
according to Wan et al. [3] and the Alzheimer’s report [4]. 
Research done by Daviglus and Bell [5] found a link between 
the cognitive decline of ageing and an increase in the number 
of cases of depression or dementia. This means that, in a few 
short years, caring facilities will overflow with the number of 
patients needing care which the seniors cannot provide by 
themselves. 
Much research has been trying to counter the problem of 
overfull care facilities and the reluctance of elderly patients 
to move out of their homes. Studies that investigate the 
Quality of Life (QoL) and technological possibilities that 
make life easier for the dementia patients and their caregivers 
are an important asset. 
Currently, there are projects that help to make living with 
dementia tolerable. These projects try to recognise the signs 
and symptoms of patients with dementia. Once analysed, the 
data will support the improvement of the help that dementia 
patients receive, and it can also slow down the progression of 
the disease. These inventions mainly focus on the use of 
sensors and collection of data of their patients to improve 
their living situations [6][7]. 
Data collection is also an important part of these projects. 
The collection of data gives insight, information and is an 
essential function for the healthcare sector. Through data 
collection and analysis, caregivers can understand situations 
better. Research has been conducted into what kind of sensors 
can be useful to collect data of dementia patients.  
This article is an overview of the challenges dementia 
patients and care facilities will have in the near future, the 
developing technological solutions trying to solve these 
challenges and the privacy concerns these solutions may 
raise. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 
II, we explore assessing QoL using a list of indicators. Then, 
in Section III, we see what technologies are currently 
available that can manage the mentioned challenges. Finally, 
we discuss the most relevant privacy concerns in Section IV 
before summarizing with the conclusions in Section V.  
II. QUALITY-OF-LIFE INDICATORS 
Quality of Life (QoL) has become a major topic of study 
within dementia research. Alzheimer’s disease or a related 
state of dementia can affect the lives of patients and their 
families. 
One of the most important aspects that can determine the 
stage of dementia is the QoL. Several studies used developed 
methods to measure the QoL. Examples of methods are 
Dementia Quality of Life Instrument (DEMQOL) (which is 
conducted by those with dementia themselves) and 
DEMQOL-proxy (which is conducted by the caregivers) [8]. 
Sensors can be used to measure the emotional, social and 
physical well-being of a senior citizen, and their ability to 
function in daily life (the QoL). McCaffrey et al. [9] created 
the DEMQOL to gather information from dementia patients 
through the caretakers and the patients themselves. This 
information 
would 
be 
passed 
through 
8 
generic 
measurements and 6 dementia-specific measurements added 
by Ettema, Dröes and Lange [10] to create an indicator of the 
QoL. After reviewing this model and its addition, researchers

like Ann and Gene concluded that this method can be used 
across the different subtypes and stages of dementia [11]. 
Furthermore, several studies have been done on which 
technologies can help to identify dementia or to support 
people with dementia. According to Hoffmeyer [12], 
dementia can be identified by using mobile sensors (such as 
an accelerometer). This research achieved an accuracy of 
81%. 
Currently, most anomaly detection systems are often data 
or application specific, but anomaly detection can be useful 
in many situations. Anomaly detection methods are explored 
to monitor the QoL of senior citizens. This method is a 
seemingly natural tool to automatically detect anomalies in 
any possible sensor data that can represent time series [13]. 
According to researchers like Wang and Zeng [14], 
results show that people with early dementia have more 
alternations of sleep-wake cycles. The quantity and quality of 
sleep may reflect their dementia condition and can affect the 
QoL for people with dementia. Sleeping patterns can be 
detected continuously and transformed into data and 
visualised in a dashboard where a caretaker could see the 
quality of overall sleep. The caretaker could then decide who 
to visit when making the rounds. 
In conclusion, it may be possible to combine the idea of 
the DEMQOL questionnaire and sensors to track the 
condition of the senior citizens. Deciding which indicators 
should be measured to track the QoL should be decided by 
experts that currently do such assessments face to face with 
the senior citizens. By automating this process using the 
sensor data and visualising it on dashboards to be monitored 
by caretakers, they can gain insights in how their patients are 
progressing in real time all the time. Caretakers can use this 
information to provide targeted and timely care to their 
patients. 
III. DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION 
The increasing number of elderly people has not gone 
unnoticed for long. Their placement in care homes and 
wellbeing 
has 
been 
researched, 
and 
technological 
advancements are being developed to support their QoL. 
A. Home companion 
A current trend with caretakers is the introduction of 
home companions to their patients. Home companions are 
pet-like toys which simulate the having of and caring for a 
pet. These toys often look like dogs or cats which can move 
parts of their body to simulate the interactions the patient can 
have with an actual pet. Developers are using these toys to 
provide the seniors with companionship and thereby raising 
their QoL. 
Examples of such interactive companions include Paro, a 
robotic home companion who had the appearance of a seal 
[15]. Paro was used to reduce stress and loneliness inside care 
facilities. It encouraged communication between residents 
and to the robot itself, which concluded in psychological 
improvement and even reduced stress levels. Other robotic 
companions, like the Oleo and ifbot [16], would also help 
improve the overall QoL but are too expensive for civilian 
everyday use. These robots do show the potential and 
effectiveness of increasing the QoL for elderly patients living 
alone. 
B. Sensors and monitoring 
1) Home automation 
Smart homes also have the potential for making the life 
of people in general and senior citizens in particular easier. In 
their research exploring using smart homes to support 
seniors, Demiris and Hensel found that most of them cover 
monitoring or automation [17]. In case of automation, these 
systems can do that in multiple ways. One example is XBee 
[25] where seniors can operate home appliances from an app. 
By doing this, the elderly do not have to deal with the 
complicated dials which are on home appliances, such as 
washing machines or dryers. However, a commonly found 
disadvantage to these systems is their cost of installation. 
Also, there are still manual activities that have to be done in 
order to complete these day-to-day activities. For example, 
the wash still has to be put into the machine in order to turn 
it on from an app. 
A different example is allowing relatives or caretakers to 
help seniors manage their home, even from remote distances. 
This way unexpected visitors or unsupervised trips by the 
seniors could be detected and stopped when needed. Even 
though the feedback for these types of systems is largely 
positive, some elderly expressed concerns about the intrusion 
on their privacy. Also, a more unexpected conclusion from 
this particular research was that elderly tended to turn more 
indolent. For example, instead of normally checking for the 
door being closed and in case of forgetfulness asking the 
system, elderly did not even bother checking for it themselves 
but relying on the system in the first case. 
 
2) Fall prevention and detection 
The European Union has been funding projects that help 
prevent falls for seniors for many years now as it is a common 
cause of severe injury. Falling accounts for approximately 
40% of all injury deaths among the elderly. As a result, these 
European Union funded projects are aimed towards 
prevention and protection of commonly falling elderly. 
Preventing a fall can be done for example by having 
sensors detecting when seniors might be about to get up with 
a lower blood pressure. Having a system that would sound an 
alarm in such a situation can advise the elderly that they 
should not exert themselves and thereby keep them safe [28]. 
The main goal is that by detecting a fall, an automated 
system can proceed to call for assistance. This can be 
essential when, for example, a senior has passed out or is for 
any reason unable to call for assistance themselves. A unique 
approach to this problem is using vibration detection [27], 
which measures vibrations in the ground and can identify 
when someone has fallen. Practical studies found this 
technology quite promising. However, its performance can 
vary depending on floor type. 
 
3) Other research 
There is also different research done with the aim to help 
elderly live at home for longer, such as research regarding 
day-to-day planning [26]. This research proposes an activity 
8

schedule generator, where stable schedules can be generated. 
The generator can even keep into account what the layout of 
the house is and what smart devices the patient has. Such a 
system can help an elderly person organise the work they 
have to do in a normal day-to-day planning. Moreover, by 
being able to generate daily scenarios for the life of a senior 
at home, it can also help developers of smart devices to 
further improve their systems, as it can also be used to mimic 
the life of an elderly person. Difficulties with this system is 
that it can be abstract and there is not a ready to download 
version available at the time of writing. 
Such mimicking of daily activity was also used to learn 
the normal behaviour of a specific elderly person in other 
monitoring related research [29]. This research shows that 
learning the normal behaviour of a specific individual allows 
us to spot changes in behaviour. These changes, although 
sometimes benevolent, can be indicators of mental or 
physical problems. Whilst the system learns these 
behavioural changes, it can determine whether or not to act 
upon this, or at least communicate it via the interface it is 
attached to. This system is still undergoing a lot of 
development, as it is far from perfect. The system would 
during practical tests not always notice behavioural changes 
in time. Furthermore, privacy is still a large issue, because 
there are cameras and other sensors required for the system 
to work. 
IV.   PRIVACY 
A recurring trend with many of the above-mentioned 
interventions is that they rely on the collection of data. This 
data is needed not only to monitor the patient, but also to 
improve the product itself. It is important to carefully 
scrutinise what data can be collected, because collecting data 
can be harmful if not done correctly according to research by 
Melander-Wikman et al. [18], Boise et al. [19] and Townsend 
et al. [20]. 
A lot of research has already been done about monitoring 
elderly patients. It would then come to no surprise that a lot 
of issues with data collection methods have appeared. For 
instance, Fukuda et al. [21] found that by monitoring patients, 
the caretakers are invading their personal space. Surprisingly, 
Melander-Wikman, Fälthom and Gard [18] found that the 
elderly tend to react positively towards the collection of data, 
if the data is used for the right purposes and if there is enough 
transparency [18]. The reluctance towards being monitored 
can differ based on individual opinions and does not seem to 
be a consensus among the patients. 
Research by Schulz et al. [21] and Holone et al. [22] 
shows that monitoring elderly patients without their 
knowledge or approval could lead to aversion or reluctance 
to the inventions, to the point patients would even show 
“privacy enhancing behaviour [23]. In such a situation, 
patients actively avoid the sensors installed in their homes, 
thereby defeating the purpose of installing the sensors in the 
first place [30]. This shows that the elderly patients should be 
made aware of the situation and the monitoring so they could 
negotiate their privacy if necessary. 
Care facilities already use devices that collect data, for 
instance a fall detection device by Melander-Wikman, 
Fälthom and Ghard [18]. The reaction of the elderly towards 
the up-and-coming monitoring devices was either positive or 
indifferent, stating they are already being surveyed anyway. 
Their only concern was the possible misuse of their data, 
found by Boise [19]. Research by Townsend, Knoefel and 
Goebran [20] shows that most elderly patients disregard their 
privacy when it would mean they could live autonomously 
longer. 
V. CONCLUSION 
To conclude this article, it shows that the increasing 
amount of elderly people with dementia due to cognitive 
decline and the ageing of the population will be a serious 
issue in the next 20 years. 
Developers are working hard to create new ways to 
stimulate patients, decrease their stress and increase their 
well-being. There are multiple ways to do this, such as by the 
use of home companions or Smart Homes. Development in 
this area is fast and new research is continuously being done. 
There have been multiple findings throughout our report, 
which can be summarised into a few key points. The first 
point is that, in order for the elderly to stay at home longer, 
they rely on having tasks automated. This can be quite easily 
explained as day-to-day tasks can be tiresome, which was 
even shown in research where the life of elderly was 
simulated. 
Continuing with the tiresome factor, the second key 
element seemed to be the focus on elderly and them being 
prone to falling. The elderly seem to fall more often and be 
more vulnerable to injuries as well. There is a lot of research 
done on this subject, some of it supported by European 
funding. However, most research seems to primarily aim at 
detecting falls or acting upon results of falling. This focus 
should shift towards avoiding falling and preventing injuries 
when the elderly fall. As more and more research is being 
done, this shift in priority should be taken into account. 
However, the developing technological solutions also 
come with a price. Not only financially, but also the privacy 
the elderly need to give up in order to be able to live at home 
longer. Privacy among the elderly is a sensitive issue. Though 
some are less concerned about it, it should still be managed 
correctly, ethically and legally. Research performed by 
previous groups shows what technology can be used without 
legal or social repercussions, as well as data collection 
methods which can intrude on the privacy of the patients. 
With increasing numbers of elderly people with dementia 
world-wide, the coming inventions will help control the 
overflow of patients and help relieve stress for the patients, 
families and care facilities.
