Abstract— BioMet®Phon is a software application developed 
for the characterization of voice in voice quality evaluation. 
Initially it was conceived as plain research code to estimate the 
glottal source from voice and obtain the biomechanical 
parameters of the vocal folds from the spectral density of the 
estimate. This code grew to what is now the Glottex®Engine 
package (G®E). Further demands from users in laryngology 
and speech therapy fields instantiated the development of a 
specific Graphic User Interface (GUI’s) to encapsulate user 
interaction with the G®E. This gave place to BioMet®Phon, an 
application which extracts the glottal source from voice and 
offers a complete parameterization of this signal, including 
distortion, cepstral, spectral, biomechanical, time domain, 
contact and tremor parameters. The semantic capabilities of 
biomechanical parameters are discussed. Study cases from its 
application to the field of laryngology and speech therapy are 
given and discussed. Validation results in voice pathology 
detection are also presented. Applications to laryngology, 
speech therapy, and monitoring neurological deterioration in 
the elder are proposed. 
Keywords: speech therapy; voice quality analysis; dysphonia. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we give an overview on an end-user-driven 
application to study the glottal source and its associated 
mucosal wave [1] for voice quality assessment, pathology 
detection and classification. The glottal source may be seen 
as the pressure build-up in the glottis just above the vocal 
folds in the laryngeal cavity. It is the result of the phonation 
cycle, seen as a sequence of openings and closings of the 
vocal folds under the influence of lung pressure and vocal 
fold visco-elasticity and air dynamics [2]. The glottal source 
is expected to follow closely the pattern proposed by G. 
Liljencrants and G. Fant [3] known as the L-F pattern given 
in Figure 1. The L-F profile (top blue line) is the result of 
simulating the flow of air from the lungs to the vocal tract 
through the glottis as the vocal folds open and close (the 
equivalent light seen through the glottis is called the gap in 
dash red). Classically the cycle is considered to start at the 
opening instant (tO), nevertheless, as this instant sometimes 
is rather inaccurate, the closing instant (t=0) is preferred. The 
sudden stop of the airflow by vocal folds at contact produces 
a fast drop of the dynamic pressure from 0 to a minimum (at 
t=0 and t=tC). 
 
Figure 1 
L-F pattern. Top: glottal opening (gap) in dash-red; glottal flow 
in green; glottal source in blue. Bottom: sequence of L-F patterns for 8 
consecutive phonation cycles. 
After a time interval (tR: recovery time), the dynamic 
pressure returns to its quiescent value (0). During the 
remnant part of the closed phase ending at tO, the vocal folds 
are supposedly in contact and no airflow is allowed through 
the glottis. The dynamic pressure remains in its resting value 
(0). At tO the vocal folds start opening, and a pressure build-
up towards a maximum is produced (tM) where the airflow 
(green line) is in its steepest ascent. As the vocal folds come 
closer (adduction), the pressure drops crossing the resting 
value at tCl, and falling to a minimum when both vocal folds 
produce a complete flow stop (tC). This pattern is repeated 
each glottal during the phonation process. From what has 
been said, it may seem clear that the specific profiles of the 
recovery, closed, open and closing phases will reveal 
important details of the system biomechanics. A good 
reconstruction of the glottal source is of most relevance to 
ensure proper estimates of the system biomechanics. For 
such, a careful removal of the vocal tract by system inversion 
is necessary [1]. Biomechanical parameters offer a more 
relevant semantics of vocal fold physiological structure than 
classical acoustic parameters derived from voice. Section II 
presents dysphonic voice biomechanical modeling, in 
Section III study cases are discussed, Section IV is devoted

conclusions and future work are summarized. 
II. 
MODELLING DYSPHONIA WITH BIOMET®PHON 
The computer routines providing the inversion of the 
vocal tract and the reconstruction of the glottal source are 
encapsulated in a software package referred to as the 
Glottex®Engine (G®E), which is built as a C++ package 
generated from MATLAB® [4]. It produces a set of 65 
parameters 
including 
distortion, 
cepstral, 
spectral, 
biomechanical, temporal, contact and tremor obtained from 
the glottal source following the methodology in Figure 3. 
This requires the inversion of the vocal tract and the vocal 
fold biomechanics, as explained in [1]. A good example of 
the glottal source reconstruction from a normophonic male 
subject, non-smoker, pathology-free condition assessed by 
objective endoscopy, is shown in Figure 2. 
The reconstructed glottal source and flow are quite realistic 
and resemble the simulated pattern in Figure 1. The time 
references (tR1, tR2, tO1 and tO2) and contact defects 
(ContGap, AdducGap and PermGap) are also given. In the 
specialized literature there are other methodologies and 
products which also estimate parameter sets from voice and 
use them in the assessment of pathology [5]. The most 
important feature that the parameters estimated by 
BioMet®Phon convey when compared with these other 
approaches is their ability to fill is the semantic gap between 
acoustics and structure. This concept addresses the ability of 
the biomechanical structural parameters provided by 
BioMet®Phon to describe the etiologic characteristics of the 
dysphonia in contrast to other methodologies. For instance, it 
is well known that many times deviations in the behavior of 
jitter and shimmer or HNR (harmonics-noise ratio) may point 
to the presence of pathology in voice [6], but one cannot go 
any further on investigating which kind of pathology may be 
behind this behavior. Special care has been devoted in G®E 
technology to define the biomechanical parameters adding 
description capabilities of physiological structures.

neurological parameters from voice. 
This makes the biomechanical parameters by far the most 
interesting parameter set to assess the dysphonic conditions 
of a patient in relation with a specific etiology. The 
biomechanical parameters are defined from a 2-mass model 
of the vocal folds [7] as the one depicted in Figure 4. The 
template (a) illustrates the physiological structure of the 
vocal folds as a body composed by the musculis vocalis, and 
a cover or lamina propria and the conjunctive tissues in 
Reinke’s space and the visco-elastic ligament giving support 
to the folds.

The biomechanical model in (b) shows that the massive 
structures of the cover and Reinke’s space have been 
included in the cover masses Mcl and Mcr for the left (l) and 
right (r) vocal folds. Masses Mbl and Mbr account for the 
body and visco-elastic ligaments. It must be kept in mind 
that these masses are not tissular distributed masses, but 
dynamic point-like ones (a dynamic mass is simply a relation 
between force and acceleration, and is only a fraction of the 
tissular mass). Visco-elastic parameters Kcl and Kcr explain 
the relations between tissue compression and acting forces 
on the cover and Reinke’s space. Parameters Kbl and Kbr bear 
also the same meaning regarding the body and visco-elastic 
ligament. Visco-elastic parameters account for the behavior 
of the conjunctive tissues under compression as well as for 
the contribution of the lamina propria and musculus vocalis 
along its length due to the stretching forced by the crico-
arytenoid muscles on the vocal folds during adduction and 
contact phases. Besides, the visco-elastic parameter encloses 
also the losses, which account for energy dissipation in heat, 
radiation and turbulence. Having this description in mind, the 
subset of biomechanical parameters is composed of the 
following correlates: 
• 
Parameter 35: Dynamic mass associated to the body, as 
an average of Mbl and Mbr. 
• 
Parameter 37: Stiffness parameter associated to the body 
averaged on the left and right folds (Kbl and Kbr). 
• 
Parameter 38: Unbalance of dynamic body mass per 
each two neighbor cycles. 
• 
Parameter 40: Unbalance of body stiffness per each two 
neighbor cycles. 
• 
Parameter 41: Dynamic mass associated to the cover 
averaged on the left and right folds (Mcl and Mcr). 
• 
Parameter 43: Stiffness parameter associated to the 
cover averaged on the left and right folds (Kcl and Kcr). 
• 
Parameter 44: Unbalance of dynamic cover masses per 
each two neighbor cycles. 
• 
Parameter 46: Unbalance of cover stiffness per each two 
neighbor cycles. 
The estimation of the above parameters is carried out by 
inverting the 2-mass model in Figure 4 in the spectral 
domain as described in [1]. Examples of estimates from each 
parameter on a balanced database of 50 male and 50 female 
normophonic speakers collected and evaluated by endoscopy 
at Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón are given in 
Figure 5 and Figure 6. It may be seen that parameter 35 
(body mass) is differentially distributed for males and for 
females, being larger for males, as expected. The distribution 
for parameter 37 (body stiffness) is distributed differentially 
but reciprocally (larger for females than for males), as well 
as parameter 43 (cover stiffness). On the other hand, cover 
masses (parameter 41) do not show gender differences. 
Regarding unbalance parameters (38, 40, 44 and 46) all the 
distributions concentrate towards low values with a few 
exceptions (outliers). This means that large unbalance may 
be an indication of dysphonic or pathological behavior. The 
irregular behavior of these parameters bears a clear 
semantics on possible dysphonia of pathological etiology.

nomophonic male and female datasets (given in rel. values). Abscisae give 
unbalance relative to unity (for instance, 0.01 is 1%). Ordinates give 
number of subjects. 
Accordingly to a full study of specific pathologic cases 
treated at Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón the most 
frequent behaviors may be classified within one of the 
following groups:  
• 
If body mass and stiffness are significantly increased 
above normality in a given case, this may be taken as an 
indication to a possible pathology affecting the vocal 
fold body. For instance, non-reciprocal body over-
stiffness may point out to vocal fold paresis in one or 
both vocal folds. On the contrary, an increment in the 
body stiffness accompanied by a reciprocal reduction of 
mass or vice-versa may point out to a modal variation in 
pitch as in prosodic intonation or in singing.  
• 
An increment in the cover stiffness not accompanied by 
a reciprocal reduction of mass most probably will point 
out to lesions affecting the lamina propria or Reinke’s 
space, especially if an increment in mass is also 
observed. For instance, non-reciprocal over-stiffness in 
the cover may be a clear indication that a lesion 
(nodules, polyps, cysts, or unilateral paresis) may be 
under development or already installed affecting the 
cover and possibly Reinke’s space. 
• 
An unbalance, expressed mainly in the body stiffness 
may point out also to unilateral or asymmetric vocal fold 
paresis. 
• 
An unbalance in the fold cover may be associated with 
unilateral lesions affecting the cover or Reinke´s space 
(polyps, cysts). 
 
The statistics of the biomechanical parameters for the 
normophonic sets described have been incorporated into 
G®E. The package is embedded into a Graphic User 
Interface (see Figure 7) as the application BioMet®Phon, 
designed 
for 
use 
in 
Voice 
Quality 
Analysis 
by 
Laryngologists or Speech Therapists. The GUI is rather 
simple: a new voice recording, analysis and its automatic 
report in Adobe®pdf, and Excel® may be generated in less 
than 10 s by three button clicks. The GUI allows the 
handling of a small patient's database. Once a patient is 
selected either a new recording may be obtained and 
analyzed or an old one may be processed. A sketch of the 
glottal source is presented in the upper right window of 
Figure 7.

A set of five selected parameters are presented in 
comparative windows (mid bottom) showing normality 
limits and ticketing the results as green (within normality), 
blue (under normality) or red (above normality). This code 
allows a fast semantic interpretation by the laryngologist or 
speech therapist. 
III. 
PRE-POST-TREATMENT STUDY CASES 
In what follows, a typical study case will show how 
BioMet®Phon may be used in assessing voice quality 
improvement after treatment. A specific case of pre-
treatment compared with three post-treatment inspections are 
presented and discussed. It corresponds to a female patient 
65 years-old who suffered from post-Thyroidectomic Vocal 
Fold Recurrent Paralysis (pTVFRP). The treatment consisted 
in infiltration of fat from the patient in the vocal folds. The 
patient’s voice was examined for almost a year (2011) once 
before the intervention (pre: March) and three times after the 
intervention (post1: May; post2: September; and post3: 
November). The behavior of twelve parameters from the set 
of 65 is plotted in Figure 8. The 8 most relevant parameters 
for dysphonic voice evaluation are listed in TABLE I. 
Classically 2-Jitter, 3-Shimmer and 5-HNR are parameters 
used very often in voice quality evaluation, as they are 
known to be well correlated with dysphonic voice [6]. 
Nevertheless these parameters lack structural semantics, as 
they do not allow producing hypotheses on possible 
etiological circumstances. On the contrary biomechanical 
parameters as the subset left (38-Body Mass Unbalance, 40- 
Body Stiffness Unbalance, 41-Cover Mass, 43-Cover 
Stiffness, 44-Cover Mass Unbalance and 45-Cover Stiffness 
Unbalance) allow casting hypotheses on possible etiological 
implications based on their specific definitions.

It may be seen that jitter (2) correlates more with fold 
body unbalance (38, 40), whereas shimmer (3) is more 
related to cover parameters (41, 43, 44, 46). As jitter and 
body unbalance suffer an increment after intervention (in 
post1 relative to pre) contrary to shimmer and cover 
parameters, it seems that the intervention affected the fold 
body in a different way than to the cover. It is like if initially 
after treatment the fold body suffered a regression to 
pathological behavior, which disappeared later (possible 
after fat assimilation by surrounding fold tissues). This 
observation demonstrates the superior introspective power of 
the biomechanical parameters compared to classical 
acoustical ones regarding physiological semantics. 
IV. 
VALIDATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The ultimate objective of an application to evaluate voice 
quality is to produce accurate results in detecting dysphonic 
voice from normal. Therefore, a validation of the application 
was carried out using a database of 200 subjects collected at 
Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón divided into two 
subsets of 100 subjects equally balanced by gender, and 
these on their turn comprising half normophonic and half 
dysphonic subjects. Therefore, the set used in the study 
consisted in 50+50+50+50 subjects balanced by gender and 
voicing condition. The age span covered from 20 to 60 years, 
the medians in 35 for male and 34 for females. Sustained 
phonation emissions of vowel /a/ were recorded in three 
different sessions. Samples 200 ms long of each emission 
were used in the extraction of a set of 65 parameters for each 
phonation cycle. Estimations of medians (Q2), first (Q1) and 
third quartiles (Q3) were used as distribution descriptors for 
each emission. Medians from each emission were used in the 
study, to evaluate the probability of a given patient 
observation xq being associated to the respective gender 
normophonic set:

The database was processed using a ten-time cross-validation 
procedure replacing 5 subjects each time out of 50 within a 
ten-time scale, thus producing 1000 scores per gender set. 
The results are plotted in Figure 9 and Figure 10 for each 
respective gender set as Tippet plots, ROC (Receiver 
Operator Characteristic), Reliability Functions and DET 
(Detection-Error Trade-off) curves [8].

Figure 10 Respective validation results for the female sets (see Figure 9).  
The results show that BioMet®Phon provides fairly 
similar detection capabilities for both genders. Tippett plots 
(upper left) show the evolution of false positive and negative 
detections as a function of the threshold θ. DET curves 
(lower right) scaled in logarithmic axes offer a clear view of 
the Equal Error Rate point (EER), which is the point of the 
curve where the rate of False Positives and Negatives equal. 
This can be taken as a merit factor, which is around 2.7% for 
the male set and 3.2% for the female set. These curves allow 
considering different detection scenarios. For instance, to 
reduce the rate of False Negatives to 1% in the male set a 
rate of 15% False Positives should be admitted. As the 
emission of a False Negative in the detection of dysphonic 
voice is far more critical that the emission of a False 
Positive, it should be admitted that around 1 out of 6 subjects 
with normal voice should be labeled in exchange of less than 
1 out of 100 dysphonic being labeled as normophonics. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The present paper introduced a software package for the 
extraction of semantic information from the glottal source 
obtained from phonation has been introduced under the name 
of Glottal®Engine. Based on this technology, a specific GUI 
to be applied in voice quality analysis in the clinics has been 
developed under the name of BioMet®Phon. The validation 
of this application for laryngological and speech therapeutic 
purposes has been tested on specific study cases, one of 
which has been discussed to a certain extent. Data from the 
validation tests have also been presented and discussed, 
showing the capabilities of the technology in the detection of 
dysphonia and in hypothesizing its possible causes. Future 
work foresees the extension of this methodology to 
neurological 
disease 
monitoring 
and 
emotional 
characterization from voiced speech.
