Abstract—An autonomic approach for responding to 
security incidents is proposed, which aims to replace 
traditionally people intensive, reactive, and technically complex 
methods for responding to security incidents. In addition, the 
approach provides the ability for systems to evolve in response 
to the nature of the attacks, building an immunity iteratively 
based on real environmental conditions. The solution works 
alongside existing systems and controls, addressing failures to 
resolve the complexities of security engineering in heterogenous 
systems spanning endpoints, traditional data centres, private 
cloud, and public cloud. 
Keywords—autonomic computing; security; infosec; incident 
response; cloud computing; control. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Cloud computing is a paradigm for providing information 
technology infrastructure and services to users who do not 
want to own and operate their own physical equipment and 
want to be able to deploy and scale their applications at will. 
There are many benefits to this, which have led to ever 
increasing adoption of cloud computing services, at the 
expense of more traditional data centres. It was predicted that 
2022 [1] would see spending on public cloud services of 
$482.155 billion, an increase of 21.7% over 2021, and an 
increase of 53.6% over 2020.  There is no sign of this increase 
in spending abating. IBM [2] lists the benefits as: 
• Flexibility allows services to be accessed and scaled 
to fit ever changing demands, from anywhere on the 
Internet. 
• Efficiency means that users do not need to spend 
money on physical equipment, much of which may be 
redundant, while being able to bring applications to 
market quicker. 
• Strategic value is derived from having access to the 
latest technology as it becomes available, from new 
processors to the latest machine learning platforms. 
Private cloud is where a company or entity make use of 
their own networking and compute to provide services to users 
via the use of virtualisation technologies, such as OpenStack 
[3]. This allows services to be provisioned using an 
Application Programming Interface (API), then torn down 
again via the same API when the services are no longer 
needed. Like private cloud, public cloud aims to provide 
flexible and scalable resources to users, but this service is 
provided by a third-party, such as Amazon, in the form of 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google in the form of 
Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
Services provided by cloud match those available in 
traditional data centres, but are categorised into several 
distinct areas. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides 
basic computing infrastructure in the form of virtual machines, 
networking, and storage. This is a core element of all clouds, 
both public and private, and has arguably [4] become 
increasingly commoditised. AWS have the Elastic Compute 
Cloud (EC2) service for virtual machines, while GCP has 
Google Compute Engine (GCE) providing the same service, 
as just two examples. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is an 
abstraction which prevents the user from needing to manage 
compute directly, and instead provides a framework for 
building and deploying applications. As part of this, advanced 
features, such as identity, access management and security are 
usually provided. Examples of this are Google App Engine, 
Heroku and Vertex AI [5]. Software as a Service (SaaS) 
removes practically all responsibility from the user of 
managing and running an application (other than managing 
user access), and instead provides direct business value. 
Examples of this are Salesforce, public GitHub, and Google 
Docs [6]. Finally, Container as a Service (CaaS) refers to a 
service which orchestrates many different sub-components 
running in containers into a fully managed distributed 
application. While the term is agnostic of any given 
implementation of the technology, this usually refers to 
Kubernetes [7], a platform developed by Google to manage 
massive applications. Each of the major public clouds offer 
managed Kubernetes services; GCP provides Google 
Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure provides Azure Kubernetes 
Service (AKS), and AWS provides Elastic Kubernetes Service 
(EKS). Out of the various service offerings offered in cloud, 
CaaS is the closest to offering autonomic capabilities. 
Casalicchio argues [8] that container orchestration does not 
include any autonomic features because of a reliance on 
hypervisors and simplistic heuristics for actions like scaling, 
but this misses two key points. The hypervisor is not the 
autonomic management agent in a CaaS, it is the master node 
[9] along with the Kube-Controller-Manager, and secondly 
that the process of scaling pods and nodes is already 
autonomic in the case of managed offerings, such as GKE. 
Underlining this shift in how Information Technology (IT) 
services are deployed and managed are the kind of workloads 
being run on clouds. They are no longer the reserve of small, 
rapidly innovating start-ups, but are used by over 90% of the 
largest companies in the world [10]. Large financial 
institutions like CapitalOne closed the last of their data centres 
in 2020, relying entirely on Amazon Web Services to run their 
entire I.T. estate [11]. However, with this seismic shift in how 
services are run, so have these new services been exposed to 
new kinds of threats. While a threat is often thought of as a 
malicious actor, whether that be a script kiddie or hacker 
collective, the most significant cause of breaches is human 
error. In fact, IBM found [12] that human error is the root 
cause in 95% of cases. The combination of simple to deploy 
services with complex and difficult to fully understand API 
configurations means that even before services are deployed, 
vulnerabilities are already built into a service. With the ease

with which new Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) 
are brought to bear by attackers on the Internet, security 
practitioners are facing multiple threats from internal and 
external vectors. This has led to both a shortage of trained 
cyber professionals [13] and burnout among existing people 
[14]. Clearly, the burden on cyber professionals is increasing, 
with 2021 seeing a 1885% increase in ransomware attacks 
alone [15]. 
Security in IT systems (often referred to simply as Cyber) 
is a central concern in how people conduct their lives, how 
nations and governments run their countries and manage their 
societies. The digitisation of society, while providing an 
unprecedented 
level 
of 
access 
to 
information 
and 
communication, has introduced an equal and opposite issue in 
exposing our society to threats that transcend both physical, 
national, and geographical boundaries. 
Hagen et al. [16] refer to the challenges of physical 
distance, borders and time diminishing. However, the impact 
of this is that society has become much more susceptible to 
various kinds of malignant activity from threat actors that 
ranges from causing reputational damage in the form of web 
site defacement, hacktivism from organisations like 
Anonymous [17], or even attack from nation states. 
Cryptographer and security expert Bruce Schneier predicted 
[18] the rise of rapid automated attacks, perpetrated from a 
distance, and the subsequent proliferation of these techniques 
would require only a single skilled threat actor, while the 
ability to communicate at will over long distances in secret 
would mean that a technique could simply be copied by others. 
The prevalence and effectiveness of cyber-attacks by nation 
states has resulted in a move to defensive postures that will 
possibly include what is euphemistically called a kinetic 
response – a cyber-attack could soon lead to a physical 
military response [19]. Given the state of current computing 
paradigms and the associated financial and societal risks, 
methods must be developed which can remove the burden of 
securing of those paradigms as much as possible from the 
human. 
In Section 2, security in cloud computing is examined, 
focusing on defense in depth.   Section 3 focuses on 
Autonomic Cloud Computing for security.  Section 4 goes into 
more detail on applying these autonomic principles for 
security.  Section 5 proposes an Autonomic Incident Response 
System, and finally the paper concludes with Section 6.  
II. SECURITY IN CLOUD COMPUTING 
Regardless of the computing paradigm being deployed, 
effective security programmes adopt some fundamental 
principles, which can be utilised regardless of the computing 
paradigm. The principle of these approaches is defense in 
depth (Figure 1), which calls for a series of defensive 
mechanisms which are layered to protect valuable data and 
information. Having multiple layers of security ensures that 
there are redundant controls in place if a specific control is 
compromised [20]. However, these layers are typically not 
environment aware. An example here is a firewall that is used 
to block non-authorised network traffic, which protects a 
virtual machine, which runs anti-virus software, which is 
detecting malware. Neither security control is aware of the 
other, or shares information about their environment. This is a 
major shortcoming and prevents contextual knowledge from 
being shared to protect other assets if a machine is infected 
with malware. Ideally, the anti-virus agent would let the 
firewall know that a piece of malware would try to attack other 
assets (this process is referred to as traversal) by passing 
metadata, which notes a particular traffic of network traffic 
using five-tuple [21] data along with a file hash as part of a 
message payload. The firewall could then react to the attack 
in real-time. At the same time, the malware metadata could be 
used by another component, such as a malware sandbox where 
it could be detonated to provide further data to further enhance 
defensive measures, or even to maintain a chain of custody for 
forensic analysis of a breach. This process is part of what is 
referred to as incident response, which is a procedure for 
dealing with a security incident. 
 
Figure 1. Defense in depth. 
The scenario described is already understood by security 
practitioners (though this is a simpler use case), but there are 
two issues which make this process very resource intensive 
and increasingly unmanageable: 
• The incident response process is manual, meaning it is 
very resource intensive and requires specific expertise. 
• There are many of these incidents per day, and too few 
people to respond. This has led to the prevalence of a 
condition called alert fatigue, which is the scenario 
where security teams have too many alerts to be able 
to work effectively [22]. 
The security industry has attempted to resolve these core 
issues by introducing new kinds of tools and automation to 
make the job of the security team easier. There are several 
classes of tools to achieve this. An ad-hoc nomenclature exists 
which describes the types of security data that are used in 
cloud and security platforms. An Indicator of Compromise 
(IoC) is a digital artifact, such as a file, hash or configuration 
that is a sign of an attack. These can be shared among systems 
so that they can all be protected by detecting an attack. 
Organisations called Information Sharing and Analysis 
Centers (ISACs) exist for industry verticals where trusted 
partners can share these using threat sharing platforms, e.g., 
the Financial Services ISAC (FS-ISAC). A vulnerability is a 
package or system misconfiguration that is susceptible to 
attack, and lastly an exploit is a piece of software or technique 
that can be used to take advantage of a vulnerability. Security 
Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms 
perform two main functions. Firstly, they collect log and event 
information from networks and devices and store the data so 
that it can be searched. Logs could take the form of access 
logs, network traffic information, web requests or DNS 
requests. All this log data enables the second purpose of these 
platforms, which is to look for anomalies in the logs that may

be indicative of a breach or attempted attack, both in real-time 
and as part of a forensic analysis of a breach. For example, if 
a log message indicates a particular IP address is performing 
thousands of requests a second, it may be indicative of a DDoS 
attack. Rules are written which describe these conditions, and 
when these conditions are detected, alerts are raised which are 
handled by a human operator. It does so in real-time, but as 
the volumes of logs have increased exponentially, these 
platforms are having trouble scaling to meet demand. Threat 
intelligence seeks to augment a SIEM by providing 
information about malicious sources, which can be then used 
in real-time to filter alerts, reducing the cognitive load on the 
security practitioner. Practically, if a SIEM has a known list 
of IP addresses that it knows are a source of malicious traffic, 
then it can prioritise alerts on those rather than attempting to 
filter and analyse all sources. 
Integrating SIEM, threat intelligence and other tools, such 
as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools together and 
providing procedures for responding to threats are Security 
Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platforms 
Repetitive processes can be handled automatically, and a 
SOAR platform could be used to respond to a malware attack 
as described, or to automatically shut down a virtual machine 
if it is found to be infected with a critical vulnerability. Like a 
SIEM, these rules or playbooks must be manually written for 
the platform to be effective. With so many different tools and 
techniques, there is a significant challenge in simply being 
able to integrate them. The single common standard for 
sharing vulnerability information for many years has been the 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) standard [23], 
which is how software vulnerabilities, such as Heartbleed [24] 
are communicated for consumption by human and machine 
alike. It describes details, such as whether the vulnerability 
can be exploited over a network or without authentication to 
the host system. In recent years, several other standards have 
emerged under the stewardship of Oasis in the form of the 
Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) standard, 
and complementary Trusted Automated eXchange of 
Indicator Information (TAXII) standard. These formats are 
XML-based and are used to describe all manner of threats, 
such as malware or network-based attacks, independent of any 
single vendor or implementation, and indicators of 
compromise using the embedded CyBOX standard. The 
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a standard 
proposed by NIST [25] that allows for automated vulnerability 
management and is in use by many major security solutions. 
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an important 
standard because it attempts to add a dynamic weight to a 
vulnerability through its environmental score. If a 
vulnerability is exposed directly to the Internet, then the 
weight is increased to reflect the higher risk of exploitation, or 
if mitigated by a network control, it is greatly reduced for the 
opposite effect.  Other standards exist expressing similar data, 
but in summary, there are many standards that support 
integration of various security tools and processes. 
The integration of various log sources, security platforms 
and controls together are an ideal outcome, which in theory 
should produce an effective immune system that can detect 
and respond to threats more effectively. The reality is far from 
the truth. The result of efforts by security vendors to solve 
these many problems has resulted in an explosion in 
complexity of security tools which require all new skills to be 
able to operate and interpret. In fact, deploying new security 
tools may not improve security at all, but have the opposite 
effect due to a decreasing ability to detect an attack [26]. Even 
in the case where a tool adopts an open standard, such as 
SCAP, if other tools in the environment do not at least support 
it also, then the ability to integrate is greatly reduced. 
III. AUTONOMIC CLOUD COMPUTING AND SECURITY 
 
While autonomic computing is a well-defined domain, it 
does not hold exclusivity over the main features of an 
autonomic system, and cloud computing platforms exhibit 
several features which classify aspects as autonomic. Indeed, 
Cloud Computing was Autonomic Computing’s major impact 
success during its 2nd decade [27]. These principles are refined 
into just four, so-called self-CHOP. 
• Self-Configuration 
• Self-Healing 
• Self-Optimisation 
• Self-Protection 
Self-configuration is supported by both IaaS and PaaS 
services to build distributed applications. Etchevers et al. [28] 
outline various methods to achieve this. Virtualisation and 
corresponding formats are a focus of the paper which 
concludes that the formalisms and mechanisms offered by 
industry are basic, non-exhaustive and non-extensible. A key 
point from the paper is that vendors are moving towards 
common APIs, such as OVF to describe applications. 
However, the paper does not explore the practice of 
configuration 
management, 
which 
addresses 
the 
shortcomings identified by providing the ability to 
autonomously configure multiple applications and multiple 
fine-grained applications. Popular tools in this space are 
Puppet, Chef, Ansible and Terraform. Each of these tools 
possess a management component or master which configures 
new and existing components, such as new servers coming 
online via an agent or surrogate agent process. Both the master 
and agents are akin to an autonomic manager, which exchange 
information on the desired state of an environment and the 
actual state. Configuration drift (Figure 2) is where the 
configuration of a service differs from the expected 
configuration, and it is this that the master attempts to correct 
for each service. It does so iteratively through a process called 
eventual consistency, in which the master issues commands 
over a secure channel to make corrections, and the services (in 
fact, an autonomic manager) respond with a snapshot of their 
current state. This continues until there is no configuration 
drift. This mechanism results in what is a self-healing process 
that can operate with any aspect of the cloud that can be 
managed programmatically. Configuration management tools 
can integrate with any aspect of a cloud environment, 
including security controls. This results in a declarative 
capability to define the desired state of an environment. While 
this implies a static system, these tools also allow rules to be 
added which dictate how a system should behave under load 
or when failures occur, which gives the environment the 
ability to define fault tolerance declaratively and have the 
managers enact it. Cloud is also self-optimising because it can 
scale many aspects of the environment according to pre-
defined conditions and rules. This ability to pre-programme 
the addition and removal of services from the environment 
results in apoptotic services. Servers may be started (using the 
autonomic 
processes 
available 
from 
configuration 
management tools) based on some collection of metrics, such 
as requests per second to an application or increased CPU 
usage. Then when loads fall back under some threshold 
(which could be static or learned over time) servers are shut 
down again. The ability to shutdown services in response to 
67

some environmental event is a key part of an autonomic 
security capability. For example, if a server is compromised, 
it should be quarantined, snapshotted for forensics, then 
shutdown before it can be used by an attacker to traverse the 
network. What is lacking in cloud is the integration and 
proliferation of these events in a way which is standardised 
and in real-time. The environmental event could come from a 
SIEM platform or threat intelligence platform using STIX. 
 
Figure 2. 
Configuration drift. 
The ability to declare what a cloud environment should 
look like and have configuration management processes 
configure and heal services gives us the ability to build self-
protecting systems. However, this is where the current state of 
cloud largely fails to embrace autonomic principles. To self-
protect, a component must be aware of internal and external 
threats, and this complexity is why securing any IT system, 
not just cloud is becoming exponentially more difficult. 
Consider the following incident example: 
• Configuration manager defines a network and 
application which runs on port 443. 
• The application uses version 10.1 of a web server. 
• A new server starts up and it’s agent communicates 
with the master to retrieve it’s configuration and install 
the application running on port 443. 
• The new server reports back to the configuration 
manager which compares declared versus actual state, 
sees they are the same, so no further action is taken. 
• Thirty minutes later, the new server checks again with 
the master to compare declared state. They are the 
same, so no changes are required. 
• A new zero day exploit on the web server being used 
is found. There is no patch available yet, but metadata 
is available. 
• An application is running for which there is no defence 
yet. 
There are several possible mitigations for this. The use of 
a SOAR platform may be able to automatically shut this 
service down or create a firewall rule that blocks traffic to this 
port. The issue is that the SOAR does not know about the zero 
day to be able to take an action in the first place. A threat 
intelligence 
feed 
could 
provide 
this 
information 
automatically, but there will always be a lag between a zero 
day being found and exploited and the time it is detected and 
mitigated. Even the associated CVE may not contain enough 
metadata to be assist an autonomous security platform, and 
there is often a lag of days or weeks before information is 
available in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), 
examined in detail by Ruohonen [29].  In addition, in real-
world scenarios, services are simply not shut down and 
security controls automatically configured without oversight, 
due to the risk of business outages or even inadvertently 
introducing even more vulnerabilities into a system. Security 
platforms, such as IBM QRadar Risk Manager [30] disabled 
features which allowed the automatic configuration of 
security controls for these reasons. Even in an environment 
where a mature configuration management strategy is in 
place, security tools are in place and well-tuned, incidents 
cannot be responded to in real-time. 
IV. APPLYING AUTONOMIC PRINCIPLES TO SECURITY 
Clearly, there are significant efforts to bring the power of 
automation to bear on the dual problem of ever-increasing 
complexity, and ever more scarce resources when it comes to 
dealing with it. Cloud has nascent support for an autonomous 
approach to security in the form of configuration management 
tools APIs (though unique to each cloud implementation). 
Defence in depth strategies call for multiple independent 
components working together to provide layered security, and 
while individual controls are effective at addressing specific 
kinds of controls, such as protecting a web application or 
defending a network, they are not context-aware because they 
do not understand the environment in which they are 
operating. (This means that if a vulnerability is present, it is 
not clear how critical it is. It could be hidden behind many 
other controls or exposed directly to the Internet). This is a key 
requirement of eight conditions that IBM define [31] as 
features of an autonomic system, which are: 
• The system is aware of the resources it can access and 
why it is connected to other systems. 
• It can automatically configure itself based on its 
environment. 
• It must be able to optimise itself for efficiency. 
• It must be resilient in the face of problems through self-
healing or avoiding issues. 
• It must protect itself against attacks. 
• It must adapt to its environment by establishing 
connections with adjacent systems. 
• It should rely on open standards. 
• It can predict demand for its resources and adapt in a 
manner transparent to other systems. 
Research in autonomic security is relatively non-existent 
but is gaining momentum in industry. Google have labelled 
their own initiatives as the “10x SOC”, referring to a security 
operations center which can be considered the central nervous 
system in an enterprise. The focus of this effort is to address 
the issues set out by this paper, in terms of throughput 
achieved over current methods [32]. As is predictable for a 
vendor publication, prominence is given to specific products, 
but nevertheless, it identifies the following building blocks of 
an autonomic SOC: 
Products, including Chronicle, Looker and BigQuery, 
which mirror the functionality of a SIEM in providing analysis 
of logs and events. 
Integrations to EDR, SOAR, etc. 
Blueprints, including network forensics and telemetry. 
Content, which includes rules, logs and security detection 
playbooks. 
Despite originating from a deeply technical company like 
Google, their full paper [33] does not propose an autonomic 
solution, and falls short of any kind of technical insight into 
68

an approach, but it does serve to underline the finding of this 
paper so far, and that is the components are available to build 
an autonomous system. What is lacking is cohesion in the 
form of an autonomic communications channel and 
standardised message formats. This paper has identified 
several open message formats that can be used to 
communicate security information between all kinds of 
components. 
Thus, reviewing the eight attributes of an autonomic 
system and combining it with what has been identified so far 
in terms of cloud and security technology, we can map the 
eight autonomic principles as defined by IBM to an autonomic 
security solution for cloud environments. 
• It can be aware of systems that it is connected to via 
the use of configuration management declared state. 
• It can configure itself and other components via 
configuration management agents. 
• It can optimise itself through metrics gathered from the 
environment via manager components and data 
generated by the cloud platform to block threats not 
previously seen. 
• It can self-heal by turning off infected or compromised 
hosts using SOAR or restarting services that 
unexpectedly crash or fail. 
• It can protect itself by declaring known state, and 
fixing configuration issues if configuration drift is 
detected. 
• It can partially adapt to its environment by using the 
declared state to understand adjacent systems and use 
environment information to modify its own behaviour. 
• Many open standards exist which allow components 
to communicate, such as STIX, TAXII, SCAP and 
ATT&CK. 
• It can predict demand and future events by using 
environment information and threat intelligence data. 
To achieve an autonomic solution, cloud and security 
technology must operate as a single immune system, rather 
than as vestigial appendages to one another. 
V. AN AUTONOMIC INCIDENT RESPONSE SYSTEM 
This paper has summarised the many challenges facing 
security practitioners as they secure and defend their platforms 
against both internal and external actors. It has also researched 
the current state of cloud as a means for managing complex 
distributed applications. In doing so, a complex and 
heterogenous landscape of point solutions and loose 
integrations has been identified which increases complexity 
rather than reduces it. Proposing a solution which introduces 
yet another security tool to actively manage will not resolve 
the issues in a meaningful way. Therefore, the following must 
be true of any solution: 
• The solution must augment existing tools and 
platforms. i.e., the solution should utilise existing 
security services or agents as their managed 
component. 
• The solution should adopt autonomic principles in a 
manner which does not increase the cognitive load on 
security practitioners. It will do this by automating 
incident response and cutting the human out of the 
loop. 
• The solution must adopt open standards to enable 
messages and knowledge to be shared among 
components of the solution. 
An autonomic solution requires that the following 
components be present in the solution: 
• An autonomic element which is a combination of a 
managed component and an autonomic manager 
• The managed component which in this case could be 
any kind of security apparatus that we would to 
managed autonomically, e.g., a firewall or user access 
list. 
• The autonomic manager, which operates the 
managed component based on feedback, such as 
messages received from the environment. 
• Communication between the autonomic elements will 
be achieved with an autonomic communications 
channel. As part of this, messages will be formatted 
according to open standards, such as STIX, CyBOX 
and SCAP. 
The environment should be considered as the full extent 
of a cloud deployment which hosts infrastructure that provides 
some value, of any combination of services. In the case of a 
website, this could be virtual machines, databases, message 
queues and an in-memory cache, for example. A defence in-
depth strategy (Figure 3) calls for multiple layers of security. 
The solution proposes that each logical layer of such a strategy 
is secured by an autonomic element as described. 
 
 
Figure 3. Autonomic defence in depth. 
Autonomic elements must consume and emit the 
following kinds of messages: 
• Indicator of compromise data will be passed between 
autonomic elements using the OpenIOC standard. This 
is our reflex signal, to which the system is expected to 
respond, which should result in a mitigation. Examples 
of this message may be an IoC for a piece of malware 
identified by an EDR solution (the managed 
component) 
and 
published 
to 
the 
autonomic 
communications channel by an attached autonomic 
manager. 
• Vulnerabilities will be expressed using the CVE 
format and associated Common Platform Enumeration 
(CPE) format which allows specific operating system, 
package, and version information to be expressed. An 
example message would specify that OpenSSL version 
1.1.3 on Linux has a critical vulnerability. 
• Mitigations required for managed components will be 
passed using the SCAP standard, which contains 
machine 
readable 
data 
expressing 
how 
the 
69

environment state should be modified to remediate a 
vulnerability, possibly an apoptotic response to the 
reflex signal. An example SCAP message would 
specify that a certain Windows 11 Pro service should 
be disabled. 
A scalable and fault tolerant message bus, such as Kafka 
or RabbitMQ will constitute the autonomic communications 
channel which each autonomic manager will both subscribe 
and publish to. These message queues are built to ensure that 
messages are always delivered and can scale up to many 
millions of messages per second, so important security events 
are guaranteed to be delivered. Each managed component is 
an existing security control or cloud service. The autonomic 
manager integrates with it via existing APIs and acts as a 
gateway between control specific messages and the 
standardised formats the solution is relying on. While each 
autonomic element receives every reflex signal being 
triggered, it is up to each specific element to decide how to 
react to it, and if it also needs to transmit a reflex signal in turn. 
By combining both cloud services and security controls into a 
single autonomous system, an immune system is created 
which removes the need for a human in the loop because 
existing security tools integrate poorly with the environment 
they are protecting. 
To understand how the solution would work, consider 
Figure 4. AM5, which manages a vulnerability scanner, 
detects a vulnerability on a VM and emits an SCAP message 
with remedial details. AM4 receives the message and issues a 
system command which updates the environment state with 
the remedial action and the change is made as configuration 
drift has occurred between the desired state and actual state. 
AM1, AM2 and AM3 receives the message but does not 
perform any action. 
In another scenario, AM3 detects that data is being sent to 
an unauthorised IP outside of the environment. It emits an 
OpenIOC message. AM1 receives the message and instantly 
enacts a change to the environment to block this network 
traffic. In addition, AM2 receives the message and queries the 
Cloud Armor Web Application Firewall (WAF) for all traffic 
sent from the offending external IP address and emits an 
OpenIOC message. Upon receiving the message AM5 
conducts a vulnerability scan of the web applications being 
hosted that interacted with the external IP, based on the 
messages from AM2. 
At no point in these interactions is a human necessary to 
perform any action. This fact is the advantage of an autonomic 
security solution, as the workload on security practitioners is 
greatly reduced. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
So far, the security industry has failed to take advantage of 
the many features covered by this paper, and only increased 
the complexity of systems overall, failing to take advantage of 
autonomic principles in favour of artificial complexity.

Taking a devil’s advocate position, a serious ethical issue with 
the solution is the consumption of data which has historically 
been heavily biased against network traffic originating in 
certain regions, and weight that traffic is much more 
negatively based on this fact alone. In this solution, this will 
manifest itself in the number of IoCs being flagged as 
originating in regions, such as Russia or China. The root cause 
of this is the bias in threat intelligence which is either directly 
or indirectly consumed by security tools and cloud platforms. 
This will directly lead to users from those areas being treated 
differently than others based on an explicit bias. However, the 
move to purely autonomous security platforms can greatly 
reduce this issue by removing very real cognitive bias 
introduced by human operators. Of course, the irony of the 
tendency to instantly associate any activity from Russian and 
Chinese sources is that although both these countries are 
undeniably involved in cyber warfare as nation states [34], in 
the case of Russia at least they have not launched a mass 
surveillance and illegal wiretapping campaign to match the 
scope of that perpetrated by GCHQ and the NSA in the form 
of the PRISM programme [35]. So, in this case, a very real 
bias results in blind spots as teams may not consider ‘friendly’ 
nation states as potential sources of attack. This is underlined 
by the simple fact that attempting to search for material 
associated with nation state threat actors will yield results that 
are almost exclusively non-western countries. Finally, to 
underline the effect of cognitive bias, consider the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine and its impact on the security 
practitioner. Given the clear distinction in the roles of 
aggressor and victim as portrayed in western media, this could 
result in a human unconsciously giving more weight to a 
Russian IoC than a Ukrainian IoC. The ability for an 
autonomous system to operate purely on observations and data 
effectively negates this very real shortcoming in ‘human-in-
the-loop’ security platforms. Lastly, it is worth noting (at least 
as of 2013) that Russia was only fourth in the rankings for 
sources of cyber-attacks, while the US was second [36]. 
Autonomicity provides the opportunity to remove bias from 
the system along with its stated aim of intelligent self-
management.
