Abstract—Non-verbal signals expressed through body language
play a crucial role in our daily communications. Facial ex-
pressions, in particular, are the most universal signs to express
innate emotional cues. Human faces convey important informa-
tion in social interactions, which help us to better understand
our interlocutor. Nowadays, humanoids and social robots are
becoming increasingly similar to humans both aesthetically and
expressively. However, their visual expressiveness is a crucial issue
in making these robots more realistic and intuitively perceived
as human-like. This paper presents a preliminary study aimed
at evaluating the capability of a humanoid to perform facial
expressions in terms of recognition rate and response time
in comparison with humans’ ability. Results showed that the
recognition rate of human and robot expressions did not reveal
differences while the physical robot can convey expressions better
than its 2D photos and its 3D models. Moreover, the results
showed that both human and robot positive expressions were
better recognized than the negative ones.
Keywords–Facial expressions; emotion perception; humanoid
robot; expression recognition; social robots.

INTRODUCTION
Human beings communicate in a rich and sophisticated
way through different channels, i.e., sound, vision, touch and
smell. In particular, in human social relationships visual infor-
mation plays a crucial role. Human faces convey important
information both from static features such as identity, age
and gender, and from dynamic changes such as expressions,
eye blinking and muscular micro-movements. The ability to
recognize and understand facial expressions of an interlocutor
allows us to establish and manage empathic links, which drive
our social relationships.
Charles Darwin was the ﬁrst to observe that basic expres-
sions such as anger, disgust, contempt, fear, surprise, sadness,
happiness, are universal and innate [1]. Indeed, human beings
are able to recognize faces and read facial expressions almost
unconsciously and with little or no effort [2].
In the last years due to rapid advances in robotics and
computer graphics, more and more interactive robots and
agents have become common in our daily lives. The rapid
growth of robotics has made possible the development of
a new class of emphatic machines known as social robots.
These innovative agents are used in various ﬁelds ranging
from entertainment to human assistance and health care [3].
Hashimoto and his collegues [4] proposed an android robot
called SAYA as a teacher in elementary and university classes.
SAYA was remotely controlled by an opertor makeing the
robot able to perform facial expressions, head and eye move-
ments, and utterances. The experimental studies showed that
SAYA was more accepted by elementary school children than
by university students enhancing their interests for the class.
The ability to express emotions is clearly becoming fun-
damental for a social robot’s believability [5] driving the
research on the design of user-friendly social robots able to
reproduce human-like facial expressions [6]. Costa and her
team [7] presented a perceptual study with ZECA, a robotic
child able to perform facial expressions and gestures. ZECA
was used in human-robot interaction studies with children with
autism demonstrating their capability to recognize the robot
expressions.
Humanoids and social robots are usually high-cost products
typically used in academia and research ﬁelds only. On the
other hand virtual avatars are widely used as social characters
for games, storytelling and tutoring [8]. However, humanoids
and avatars differ in a fundamental aspect: the embodiment.
This work is based on the hypothesis that highly anthropo-
morphic robots with physical embodiment are able to convey
expressions and socially interact easier and more intuitively
than avatars and 3D models [9][10]. Indeed, the embodiment
could help robots to express their emotions by means of a
physical and real aspect, which is absent in a screen.

[11][12][13]. Our work aimed at studying the capability of
a realistic humanoid robot to show facial expressions in
comparison with 2D pictures and 3D models of itself and of a
female human. Our robot was built with a female appearance
in order to take advantage of the higher expressivity of female
expressions as demonstared by Adolph et. al. [14]. In our
experiments, participants were asked to evaluate three set
of facial expressions through questionnaires, as previously
done by Becker-Asano and Ishiguro [15] and in other similar
works [16][17] and their answers were evaluated in terms of
recognition rate and response time.
This paper is structured as follows: Section II describes the
material used to create the stimuli for the experiment; Section
III presents the method and the protocol of the experiment
and its setup; Section IV explains the statistical analysis and
the related results about the facial expression recognition; in
the end, Section V summarizes the results of the experiment
drawing a general conclusion.
II.
MATERIALS
The material used for the experiment included various
stimuli: the FACE (Facial Automaton for Conveying Emotions)
robot; the FACE robot avatar and a set of 2D and 3D pictures
of a women performing facial expressions.
A. The robot FACE
FACE is an android female face used to study human-
robot interactions with a focus on non-verbal communication,
developed in collaboration with Hanson Robotics [18][19][20].
FACE consists of a passive body with a realistic facial system
made of an artiﬁcial skull covered by a porous elastomer called
FrubberTM. FACE is animated by 32 servo motors positioned
inside the skull and in the upper torso (Figure 1).
In this study the attention was focused on recognizing the
six basic emotions considered as ’universally accepted’ by Paul
Ekman [21], i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and
surprise. The FACE’s original facial expressions were man-
ually created using the Hybrid Engine for Facial Expression
Synthesis module (HEFES) [19] following anatomical facial
expressions guidelines (Artanatomia) [22].
To standardize the methodology for creating the FACE’s fa-
cial expressions, we adopted the Facial Action Coding System
(FACS) developed by Ekman and Friesen [23]. Using FACS, a
facial expression can be decomposed into Action Units (AUs),
which are deﬁned as observable independent facial movements.
The FACE’s servo motors are positioned similarly to the major
facial muscles therefore it is possible to ﬁnd a correspondence
between them and the AUs (Figure 1).
B. Synthetic 2D and 3D stimuli
The stimuli chosen for the experiment were 2D images and
3D models of the robot FACE and of a female human.
An image of each of the 6 basic emotions plus the neutral
face was used to create the set of 7 2D photos for FACE. The
set of 7 3D models of FACE was created using the Autodesk
123D catch R⃝ program, which generates 3D models taking as
inputs one hundred photos acquired moving around the robot
from the left to the right side covering about 180◦.
The set of human 2D photos and 3D models was taken
by selecting a female subject (item bs103) from the Bospho-
rus Database [24], a 2D/3D collection of FACS-based facial
Figure 2. The stimuli used in the experiment: 2D photos (ﬁrst row) and 3D
models (second row) of (a) FACE expressions and (b) human expressions
expressions acquired using a structured-light 3D scanner [25].
Figure 2 shows 2D photos and 3D models of FACE and the
human subject used in this experiment.
Due to technical problems of a servo motor corresponding
to the buccinator muscle (motor n. 4), FACE was partially
enable to raise the left part of the smile obtaining an ambiguous
happiness expression. Motor n. 4 is used only in the happyness
expression, consequently we excluded the data relative to the
happyness from the analysis.
III.
METHOD
A. Experimental setup
Participants were seated comfortably at a desk about 0.5m
far either from a TV screen (Size: 32 inch, Frame rate: 100Hz,
Resolution: 1920 x 1080) or the robot. The experiment setup
included one laptop for controlling the robot FACE and one
laptop for controlling the animation on the TV screen.
10 participants (7 males, 3 females) aged 19 − 31 years
(mean age 24.1 ± 3.4) were recruited for the experiment.
All participants attended scientiﬁc disciplines at University of
Pisa (IT), were native Italian speakers and had either normal
or corrected to normal vision. All participants gave written
informed consent for the experiment.
B. Experimental Protocol
The protocol of the experiment was organized in 3 phases:
•
First phase: each participant had to recognize 14 2D
photos of facial expressions: 7 photos of humans from
the Bosphorus database and 7 photos of FACE, in
random order (different for each participant);
•
Second phase: each participant had to recognize
14 3D models of facial expressions: 7 3D models
of humans from the Bosphorus database and 7 3D
models of FACE, in random order (different for each
participant);
•
Third phase: each participant had to recognize 6 basic
expressions performed by the robot FACE in random
order (different for each participant).

The Unity 3D R⃝ software was used as front end animation
tool to show both 2D photos and 3D models. In each phase, the
participant had at most 30 seconds to recognize the expression.
A C# program was developed to orchestrate the expression
times as follow: at most 10 seconds was given to observe the
expression followed by at most 20 seconds to answer. In the
ﬁrst and second phase, after the ﬁrst 10 seconds or whether
the participant pressed “Enter” on the keyboard (before the
end of the ﬁrst 10 seconds), i.e., the participant was ready
to give an answer, a black screen appeared on the TV. After
pressing “Enter” the participant had to choose one of the
possible answers of the questionnaire (listed in Table I). The
response time was also recorded on the “Enter” key pressing.
In the third phase, after the ﬁrst 10 seconds or whether
the participant selected the answer on the screen (before the
end of the ﬁrst 10 seconds), i.e., the participant was ready
to answer, the robot performed the neutral expression. In this
case, the participant evaluated 6 instead of 7 different facial
expressions since the neutral expression was used as “black
screen”. To answer, the participant had to select an option
directly on the screen through a software tool running on a
laptop. The response time was recorded on the mouse clicking.
IV.
DATA ANALYSIS
The set of expressions considered in the analysis included
anger, disgust, fear, sadness and surprise. As mentioned in Sec.
II-B, the happiness expression of the robot was ambiguous
due to technical problems with a servo motor therefore it was
excluded from all datasets in the data analysis.
The facial expression recognition rates were analyzed using
the Cohen’s kappa [26], a statistical measure of inter-rater
reliability used to examine the agreement between observers
on the assignment of categories of a categorical variable.
The Cohen’s kappa ranges from -1.0 to 1.0, where large
numbers mean better reliability, values near zero suggest that
agreement is attributable to chance, and values less than zero
signify that agreement is even less than that which could be
attributed to chance. According to Landis and Koch [27], with
a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, kappa can be classiﬁed according
to the following: k <= 0.00 less than chance agreement,
0.01 < k < 0.20 slight agreement, 0.21 < k < 0.40
fair agreement, 0.41 < k
< 0.60 moderate agreement,
0.61 < k < 0.80 substantial agreement, and 0.81 < k <= 1
almost perfect agreement.
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [28] and the analysis of
variance were applied to the datasets of the response times.
The Anova-1way parametric test with a post-hoc Bonferroni
test [29] was used to examine the category differences. The
statistical inference was carried out using the OriginLab soft-
ware [30].
A. Are facial expressions of the robot perceived as well as
the expressions of humans (expressed as 2D photos or 3D
models)? Yes
Table I shows the confusion matrix of the participants’
answers for 2D human photos, 3D human models and robot
FACE’s expressions. The Cohen’s kappa of the three categories
showed a homogeneous expression evaluation with the best
level of agreement for the expressions performed by the
physical robot: KHum2D = 0.570 (p < 0.001) 95% CI (0.350,
0.789), KHum3D = 0.606 (p < 0.001) 95% CI (0.401, 0.809)
and KRobot = 0.701 (p < 0.001) 95% CI (0.530, 0.871). For
all three categories, the best recognition rate was achieved for
the surprise expression. Human anger, fear and sadness were
not so well understood when shown both as 2D photos and
3D models.
Figure 3 shows a trend of increasing recognition rate for
stimuli that gradually become more realistic, i.e., from human
2D photos to human 3D models up to the physical robot.
This supports our hypothesis about the importance of the
embodiment in conveying expressions.
All participants were instructed to choose a label for each
expression as soon as they recognized it and their response
time was recorded. Table II shows the means and the standard
deviations of the response time for each expression in the three
categories: human 2D photos and 3D models and FACE robot.
The Anova-1way parametric test did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
differences between the three categories (F(2,68) = 0.55309,

p = 0.57774, α = 0.05) (Figure 4). This data conﬁrm that the
facial expressions performed by FACE were perceived similar
to human expressions.

robot FACE expression recognition.
B. Is there a valid and useful reason to create and develop
a realistic humanoid robot instead of using its 2D photos or
its 3D models? Yes
Previous results demonstrated that FACE can convey ex-
pressions that are recognized with a similar rate of human 2D
photos and 3D models. Moreover, our study tried to investigate
if the embodiment of the FACE robot is an added value,
which could help people to better understand and interpret the
expressed emotional status.
Table III shows the confusion matrix of the participants’
answers for the robot expressions shown as 2D photos, 3D
models and physical robot. As in the previous case, for all
three categories, the best recognition rate was achieved for the
surprise expression. The expressions performed by the robot
were less confused than those shown in 2D photos or 3D
models. The level of agreement between the participants was
comparable for the three categories of the facial expressions
performed by the FACE robot with the best level of agreement
for stimuli performed by the physical robot as in the previous
case: KF ACE2D = 0.519 (p < 0.001) 95% CI (0.284, 0.752),
KF ACE3D = 0.604 (p < 0.001) 95% CI (0.375, 0.832) and
KRobot = 0.701 (p < 0.001) 95% CI (0.530, 0.871).
A comparison between the robot stimuli that gradually
become more realistic, i.e., from 2D photos to 3D models up
to the physical robot, shows a trend of increasing recognition
rate for stimuli performed by the physical robot (Figure 5).
This suggests that the embodiment of the robot conveys the
expressions better than 2D photos and 3D models.

The Anova-1way parametric test could not distinguish be-
tween the three distributions (F(2,57) = 1.66754, p = 0.19778,
α = 0.05). The time for recognizing an expression performed
by the robot was comparable to the one required to recognize
the same expression as 2D photo or 3D model (Figure 6).
Figure 7 shows that the surprise expression achieved the
best recognition rate in comparison with each negative expres-
sion with a difference of at least of 25%.

CONCLUSION
Our study aimed at investigating (1) if the recognition
rate of facial expressions performed by FACE were similar
to the ones achieved with humans stimuli and (2) if there
were differences in recognizing facial expressions performed
by FACE using its 2D photos, 3D models or the robot itself.
The ﬁnal dataset used in the analysis did not include the
happiness expression because it was considered ambiguous due
to an abnormal functioning of a servo motor.
In regard to the ﬁrst question, our preliminary results
demonstrate that the recognition rate of human expressions
is similar to the one of the robot expressions. This supports
our hypothesis that the robot is able to convey emotion through
facial expressions as well as human 2D photos and 3D models.
Concerning the second question, we found that the physical
robot can convey expressions better than its photos and its
3D models. We could hypothesize that this study support
the direction of the contention that the dynamic and the
embodiment of social humanoids improve the recognition and
discrimination of emotions in comparison with 2D pictures and
3D displays [31][32][33].
Usually positive expressions may not require the analysis
of the entire face to be recognized since they can be charac-
terized by a single feature, such as a smiling mouth for the
happiness [34]. This phenomenon makes the recognition of the
expression simpler and then faster [35]. Our results conﬁrmed
this phenomenon. A comparison between the recognition rates
of 2D and 3D human expressions showed that the surprise
expression was generally recognized better than the negative
expressions. Indeed, anger was often confused with contempt
or not recognized at all, disgust was confused with fear or pain
while fear with surprise and sadness with pity or pain. Even in
the case of 2D and 3D robot expressions, the best recognition
rate was achieved for surprise while anger and disgust were
often confused with disgust or contempt, fear with disgust or
pity and sadness with pity or not recognized at all.
In conclusion, we based our experiment on the hypothesis
that the embodiment of highly anthropomorphic robots could
help them to express their emotions by means of a physical
aspect, which is absent in a virtual character on a screen.
Our results found that there is a general tendency to better

recognize expressions performed by the physical robot than the
ones shown as 2D photos and 3D models. The embodiment
of the robot and its dynamics could be an added value to help
people to better understand and interpret the emotional status
of a robot.
This work represents a preliminary study of the emotion
conveying capability of our robot and its results are encour-
aging for future experiments. These results highlighted that
generating facial expressions is a challenging task that requires
high-ﬁdelity reproduction therefore future developments will
concern improving the performance of the robot in expressing
emotions. In addition to the exclusion of the expression of
happiness, two factors may have inﬂuenced the statistical
analysis: the small size of the sample and the extended forced-
choice paradigm. Thus, new effective experimental tests will
be designed to be more effective. Moreover, this study give
us the foundations for the setup of a therapeutic scenario in
which the FACE robot will be used as emotional display in
the autism treatment.
