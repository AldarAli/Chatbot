Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown light on the
need to prioritize and improve the existing health systems
globally. Especially in South Asia, the pandemic has left a long-
term scar on the economy and people’s lives. It has burdened the
cities to improve their overall health and medical infrastructure
facilities. Though several makeshift solutions developed in due
time provided intermediate relief to the cities, a long-term
solution to make the city self-sufficient in terms of resources,
especially in situations like the pandemic becomes necessary.
Thus, a collaborative approach to bring about an overall change
in the existing health system is required. In this work, we
provide an in-depth Spatio-temporal analysis of the air quality
in an Indian smart city - Pune and propose a simulator tool
that assists authorities in making informed decisions on adding
medical infrastructure facilities. This simulator tool takes in
static demographical inputs, user inputs related to the city
infrastructure, and forecasted dynamic inputs like critical zones
or hotspots along with the overall air quality levels to predict
the risk scores of wards. This numerical predicted score is an
indicator of the ward level risk. Concerned authorities can use
this tool to foresee the ward conditions and understand the
impact of the risk score in a ward with incremental variations
in the ward facilities during the pandemic. Further, the Spatio-
temporal analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) shows how
certain strategies and guidelines imposed during the pandemic
can help bring in significant improvement in the environmental
health condition of the city. It provides a detailed summary of the
variation in the air quality index and pollutant concentrations
in Pune from March 2020 to July 2021. Overall, this work
provides a retrospective view on the impact of demographic,
medical infrastructure, and environmental parameters on the
ward condition and how improvement in these parameters can
help cities ameliorate the existing health system in challenging
times like the pandemic.

I. Introduction
The research presented in this paper is an extension of
our previous work [1]. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is
an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It
eventually started spreading across the globe and soon became
a matter of international concern. The World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) declared this disease a pandemic in March 2020.
Since then, it has caused more than 526 million cases across
the globe claiming millions of lives [2].
Like several other countries around the world, India also
faced challenges related to the economy, infrastructure, med-
ical facilities, human resources, and environment due to the
pandemic. The second wave of COVID-19 in India has had
severe consequences in the terms of escalating positive cases,
shortage of medical infrastructure facilities reduced medical
supplies for treatments, and increased death rates, particularly
in the younger population [3]. Scientists and researchers across
the globe have been trying to identify the causes for the same.
However, the reason for this is still not apparent and is beyond
current scientific explanations. Purva et al. [3] believe that
India’s poor air quality index could be a potential factor as
to why the spread of the infection has been severe across the
country. Given that 9 of the 15 most polluted cities globally
are in India, it could be postulated that the ability of the Indian
population to fight against COVID-19 is impaired because
people’s lungs are severely affected by air pollution. Further,
a study by Comunian et al. [4] suggest that an increase in fine
particulate matter PM2.5 is associated with an increased risk
of COVID-19 infection. The atmospheric particulate matter
could create a suitable environment for transporting the virus
to greater distances. This could induce inflammation in lung
cells and exposure to the particulate matter could further
increase the susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19
patient symptoms.
In our previous work [1], we studied the effects of COVID-
19, particularly in the smart city of Pune, a western Indian
state of Maharashtra, and devised a scoring mechanism to
dynamically predict the risk levels and the environmental
health in the city. This work is an extension of the same.
In this paper, we further do an in-depth analysis of the
air quality conditions in Pune city during the period of the
COVID-19 pandemic and implement a simulator that helps
authorities foresee the reduction of risk scores in the city
with the addition of medical infrastructure facilities during the
pandemic. The timeline of the COVID-19 wave in India during
our study can be broadly divided into three phases: Phase 1

(March 2020 to Oct 2020), Maintenance Phase (November
2020 to February 2021), and Phase 2 (March 2021 to June
2021). In our paper, we select the following months in each
of the three phases for detailed analysis. Phase 1 (March,
April, May 2020), Maintenance Phase (January, February,
March 2021), and Phase 2 (May, June, July 2021). According
to reports [5], during the second wave, Maharashtra was
India’s worst-affected state, just as it was in the first wave
of COVID-19. A total of 35 percent of cases were reported
in the first wave, while 6 percent of cases were registered
during the Maintenance Phase. The second wave reported 59
percent cases in Pune. Pune being a smart city has taken
several initiatives to fight against this pandemic. Right from
setting up a command-and-control center for the supervision
and community surveillance of containment zones, tracking
the number of positive patients, and planning health care
resources, Pune smart city team has been actively providing
support for the COVID-19 management. However, due to the
unprecedented nature and non-anticipated spread of the virus,
the 2nd phase of the pandemic had a devastating effect on the
city. In this work, we analyze the ward level risk scores with
changes in the ward medical and infrastructure facilities and
propose tools, and suggestions to help reduce the risk levels in
such situations. The contributions of this work are as follows:
• Spatio-temporal analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI)
during the pandemic: Descriptive statistics are used
to assess the Spatio-temporal variations of various en-
vironmental attributes including AQI, sound (dB), ozone
(ppb), NO2 (ppb), SO2 (ppb) and particulate matter PM2.5
(µg/m3) during the 3 phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Spatial analysis is used to study the variations in attributes
across the wards. While temporal analysis is used to study
the variations in attributes of the ward over time. Quan-
tification of the pollutant levels across the study period is
provided to understand how the lockdown impacted the
AQI levels in the city. Suggestive measures to control the
degradation of ward environmental health are provided.
• A simulator tool to analyze the reduction in the ward
level COVID-19 risk score with incremental change
in the ward medical and infrastructure facilities: As
introduced in our previous work [1], we had developed
an aggregated data-rich model that predicts the ward
level risk scores. This numerical score was indicative
of the overall risk associated with the ward in terms
of its medical infrastructural health, demographics, and
environmental health. Based on the risk scores, the wards
were categorized into risk zones - Severe (100-80), High
(80-60), Moderate (60-40), Low (40-20), and Very Low
(20-0). The higher the risk value, the greater the COVID-
19 risk. In this work, we provide an extension to this
model to help simulate and analyze the reduction in
the ward level COVID-19 risk score with incremental
change in the ward medical and infrastructure facilities.
The inputs to the tool include static inputs like the
ward demographics (ward population, literate population,
children under the age of 6, number of houses in the ward,
family size, and working population), dynamic inputs like
the number of hotspots, health score of wards along with
user inputs like additional hospitals and beds to be added.
The dynamic inputs are forecasted based on previous data
while the user inputs are directly fed to the model. Train-
ing data is prepared to reflect the ward attributes and is
used to train the model. Based on the user inputs, required
features are forecasted and then fed to the model to get the
corresponding risk scores. This simulator tool provides
detailed information on the impact of critical attributes
including medical infrastructure facilities (hospitals, beds
in hospitals), ward demographics (population statistics),
and ward environmental health (AQI, population, and tree
count) on the ward risk levels. With the help of this tool,
concerned authorities can foresee the risk scores for var-
ious wards in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-Pune,
categorize the wards into risk zones based on the risk
scores, and try to understand the impact of incremental
improvement in the ward medical infrastructure facilities
on the ward risk via simulation.
Overall, the work in this paper provides granular ward
level AQI statistics and localized information dynamically
considering the change in the attributes. The simulator tool
provides adequate information to concerned authorities to plan
and further improve the infrastructure and medical facilities
in the ward. The simulation helps them understand how
improving the ward facilities will impact the risk score and
in turn their categorization to risk zone.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the overall methodology, and Section III
provides technical information about the data sources, data
analysis, and modeling with suitable graphs and plots. Section
IV presents the discussion of the results while Section V
describes the conclusion of our approach.
II. Methodology
This section provides details on the study area and briefly
explains the contributions of this research.
A. Study Area
Pune is the seventh most populous city in India and the
second-largest city in the state of Maharashtra, with an esti-
mated population of 7.4 million as of 2020 [6]. Pune is also
the 101st largest city in the world by population. It is also one
of the fastest-growing cities in the Asia-Pacific region. The
Mercer 2019 Quality of Living rankings evaluated local living
conditions in more than 440 cities around the world where
Pune ranked at 143 [7]. PMC is the civic body that governs
the inner limits of Pune spread over an area of 331.26 sq. km.
Based on the 2011 census, the data from 144 wards of the
PMC region is considered in this study [8]. The government of
India has started the National Smart Cities Mission program to
develop smart cities across the country. The Union Ministry of
Urban Development in India is responsible for implementing

this mission in collaboration with the state governments of the
respective cities. Projects were launched in 20 cities selected
in the first batch of the mission through a city challenge
competition. Pune was one among them that was shortlisted
by the Minister of Urban Development.
B. COVID-19 Phase-wise AQI Analysis in Pune
Air Quality data [9] of Pune city is collected, pre-processed,
and analyzed over the study period, Phase 1 (March 2020 to
May 2020), Maintenance Phase (January 2021 to March 2021),
and Phase 2 (May to July 2021). Ward-wise variations across
months and days are studied in detail. We summarize our
findings phase-wise and interpret the reasons for the variations
in the parameter. This sub-section provides an overview of
how the overall AQI has varied in Pune as a result of various
precautionary measures that were taken during the study
period.
C. Simulator tool to analyze the reduction in the ward level
COVID-19 risk score with incremental change in the ward
medical and infrastructure facilities.
This tool helps users analyze the variations in the risk score
of the ward that is calculated based on essential parameters
like the ward demographics, environmental health as well as
the current medical and infrastructure facilities. The simulator
tool is built on top of the Gradient Tree Boosting-based risk
prediction model proposed in our previous work [1]. Based
on the current risk score of the ward, users can vary the
input features and understand their impact on the risk scores.
Improvement in the ward medical facilities will reduce the risk
level in the ward and its impact can be easily understood with
this simulator. This makes it easier to help city authorities
plan and improve the ward medical facilities in challenging
times like the pandemic. Appropriate user interface screens
are implemented to access the features of this simulator tool.
III. Implemention and Results
This section provides details on the data sources involved,
analysis, and data modeling along with the results and sup-
ported user screens.
A. COVID-19 Phase-wise AQI Analysis in Pune
1) Data Sources: Air Quality data [9]: The Pune Urban
Data Exchange (PUDX) platform provides data related to the
air quality sensors installed in several parts of Pune city.
50+ sensors installed across the city actively measure the
concentrations of pollutants. The sensors provide AQI readings
every 15 minutes. A pipeline is created, and a job is scheduled
to collect this data regularly. The collected sensor data is then
mapped to the appropriate wards.
2) Data Analysis: Spatio-temporal analysis of AQI in PMC-
Pune: AQI for the wards in Pune across a period of months
is studied in detail. We studied the AQI over the study period,
Phase 1 (March 2020 to May 2020), Maintenance Phase
(January 2021 to March 2021), and Phase 2 (May to July
2021). According to the study [10], Pune had been ranked
299th on the air pollution index across the globe, 8th in
the state, and 74th across the country. However, in 2020,
during Phase 1, we saw a significant decrease in the AQI
levels across wards in PMC-Pune, especially during April.
The average AQI levels saw a decrease of 36% from March to
May. This reduction can be majorly attributed to the restriction
in activities that were imposed with a nationwide lockdown
persisting across these months. Figure 1 shows the average
AQI levels in PMC-Pune during this phase. We also studied
the variations of AQI at individual ward levels both month-
wise and day-wise. Table I below shows the month-wise AQI
values in 10 wards during Phase 1 and variation in the AQI
between May-20 and March-20.

The negative variation indicates improvement in the AQI
level while a positive variation shows how it has degraded
over time. Most of the wards showed improvements in their air
quality index. Some wards showed as little as 2% improvement
in their AQI levels while a few others showed 100% improve-
ment. It can be noticed that the AQI levels were relatively
lower in April-2020 when strict lockdown rules were imposed
across the city. However, by the end of May, the unlock
phases had begun. Increased activity during this period in some
wards might have led to positive variation being seen in their

AQI levels. This significant decrease in various attributes can
be contributed to the suspension of activities and restrictions
imposed on citizens during the lockdown. Residential areas
like Lohagaon, Kothrud, Baner-Balewadi, and many others as
shown in Table I showed a significant reduction in attributes
like AQI, sound, and pollutant concentrations with the impo-
sition of lockdown. Figure 2 shows variations in Sound, NO2,
SO2, PM2.5 and Ozone levels during this phase across Pune.
Month-wise and day-wise AQI variations of the ward, Baner-
Balewadi during Phase 1 are shown in Figure 3.
Figure 2. AQI Parameter variation during Phase 1
Overall, during Phase 1 PMC-Pune had
• 36.0% decrease in AQI level
• 11.0% decrease in Sound level
• 58.0% decrease in SO2 level
• 39.0% decrease in NO2 level
• 48.0% decrease in PM2.5 level
• 2.0% increase in Ozone level
With the lifting of restrictions, activities across the country
slowly began to resume after the first wave of COVID-
19. During the Maintenance Phase from November 2020 to
January 2020, there were a relatively lesser number of cases
seen across the country. By the end of February, the cases saw
a surge in number, and people started cautiously following
the COVID-19 protocols. Overall, during this phase, the AQI
levels decrease by 16% as shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows
the variation in other AQI parameters.
This decrease in AQI levels was also reflected in some
wards during this period. However, the effect of the relaxation
of COVID-19 rules and protocols was seen in contributing
to increasing the AQI levels in a few more. Table II shows
the ward-wise variations across months in this period. Month-
wise and day-wise AQI variations of the ward, Baner-Balewadi
during the Maintenance Phase are shown in Figure 6.
Overall, during the Maintenance Phase, PMC-Pune had
• 17.0% decrease in AQI level
• 1.0% increase in Sound level
• 36.0% decrease in SO2 level
• 20.0% decrease in NO2 level
• 29.0% decrease in PM2.5 level
• 114.0% increase in Ozone level

According to a study, [11] a high NOx level reacts with
Ozone and mops it up. The Ozone that escapes to cleaner
areas has no NOx to further cannibalize it and as a result,
Ozone concentration builds up in these areas. This explains the
increase in concentrations of Ozone in the atmosphere during
this phase.
According to the report, [6], nearly 59% of the cases in Pune
were reported during Phase 2. It was noticed that the numbers
were increasing rapidly. With changing symptoms unlike those
seen in Phase1, people in the age group of 20 to 45 years were
mainly affected during this phase. They showed symptoms like
low-grade fever and severe breathlessness. During this phase,
Maharashtra was one of India’s worst-affected states in the
country. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra then announced a
lockdown starting from the second week of April that lasted
till May. We analyzed the AQI levels during this phase as
shown in Figure 9 and other parameters as shown in Figure
8.
A few wards saw drastic changes in the AQI levels during
this phase. Table III shows the ward-wise variations across
months in this period. Month-wise and day-wise AQI varia-
tions of the ward, Baner-Balewadi during Phase 2 are shown
in Figure 9. Overall, during phase 2, PMC-Pune had
• 6.0% decrease in AQI level
• 1.0% increase in the Sound level
• 21.0% increase in SO2 level
• 9.0% decrease in NO2 level
• 21.0% increase in PM2.5 level
• 30.0% decrease in Ozone level
Though levels of AQI, Ozone, and NO2 decreased during
this period, there was a significant increase in the SO2 level.
With the increase in COVID-19 cases, cities began manufac-
turing essential medical aids including the PPE kits in large
quantities demanding higher energy consumption and in turn
leading to higher emissions of SO2 from the power plants.
This may have led to increased SO2 levels in the city.
Utilizing a mix of epidemiological data, satellite data, and
other monitoring information from around the world, Pozzer et
al. [12] estimated that on average, 15% of worldwide deaths
from COVID-19 may be linked to chronic exposure to air
pollution. They also found out that an increase in exposure
to hazardous air pollutants is associated with a 9% increase

in death among patients with COVID-19. With this as the
reference, we summarized the AQI levels along with the total
COVID-19 cases reported (in %) and the fatality rate against
the reported cases in Pune in Table IV.
During the Maintenance Phase, there was an increase in
the average AQI level and the fatalities that occurred in the
reported cases. It may be ascertained that higher concentrations
of air pollutants in certain wards may have caused increased
respiratory stress, thereby increasing vulnerability to severe
illness during Phase 2 of COVID-19. As reported by another
study by Wu et al. [13], just a small increase (1 microgram
per cubic meter) in long-term average exposure to fine particle

pollution is associated with an 11% increase in the COVID-
19 death rate for that country. We summarized the average
variations of pollutant concentrations in Pune across the study
period in Table V. Most of the parameters saw an increase in
their concentration levels during the Maintenance phase or the
relaxation phase. This increase in levels may have contributed
to the surge in cases during Phase 2. Figure 11 shows the
variations of pollutants across the study period. From this, we
can essentially conclude that the higher the air pollution index
and the pollutant concentrations, the more it correlated to poor
health outcomes due to COVID-19 in Pune. Figure 10 shows
various diseases attributed by air pollution in India in 2019
[14]. It can thus be inferred that with certain restrictions and
measures, the concentration of pollutants can be significantly
reduced in the city. This will not only help in improving
the overall air quality but will also help prevent premature
deaths, morbidity issues, and several other serious respiratory
diseases in people. It will largely contribute to preventing the
aggravation of respiratory stress, especially during challenging

times like the pandemic.
B. Simulator tool to analyze the reduction in the ward level
COVID-19 risk score with incremental change in the ward
medical and infrastructure facilities.
This tool helps users analyze the variations in the risk score
of the ward that is calculated based on essential parameters like
the ward demographics, environmental health as well as the
current medical and infrastructure facilities. As described in
our previous work [1], we had developed a comprehensive risk
scoring model that considered thirteen features as described in
Table VI to model the risk level of the ward.
The data collected for these features was used to train
and test the model. Several machine learning-based prediction
algorithms like Linear Regressor, Random Forest, K-Nearest
Neighbor, and Gradient Tree Boosting were used to predict the
risk scores based on the thirteen input features selected. The
predicted risk score values and their variations for the wards
across days were studied in detail. The average prediction
error rate of models using various machine learning algorithms
was compared and the Gradient Tree Boosting algorithm was
selected to predict the ward level risk scores. The work in this
paper provides an extension to this model. Based on the current
risk score of the ward, users can vary the input features like
the number of beds(x) and hospitals(y) and understand their
impact on the risk scores. Improvement in the ward medical
facilities will reduce the risk level in the ward and its impact
can be easily understood with this simulator. This makes
it easier to help them plan and improve the ward medical
facilities in challenging times like the pandemic. The thirteen
features that are used to predict the risk score of the ward
can be divided into three categories - static, user inputs, and
forecasted inputs.
1) Data inputs:
• Static inputs: Publicly available ward information like -
ward area, number of houses, number of literates, number
of children below age 6, working population, and average
family size in the wards is collected from the data sources
provided by the government [15].
• User inputs: Additional number of beds and hospitals that
are to be added in a ward are taken as input from the user.
• Forecasted inputs: Informed estimates on the parameters
like the hotspots and AQI of the ward that varies with
time are forecasted using Prophet model [16].
2) Modelling the Simulator: Appropriate data collection,
data preparation, analysis and pre-processing, model training,
and testing using thirteen features are done to build the risk
model. Data for training the model is collected daily from
the previously mentioned sources. First, a pipeline is created,
and a job is scheduled for periodic data collection. Data is

collected from all the above-mentioned data sources on a day-
to-day basis. This is followed by data pre-processing, data
aggregation, and model building. In the pre-processing step,
the geo-coordinates and addresses available in the collected
data are mapped to appropriate ward IDs using geocoding
and mapping techniques. Further, in the data aggregation step,
based on ward IDs the data is aggregated at the ward level.
Data is cleaned and the missing values are imputed with
appropriate techniques. This data is used to train the risk
score prediction and simulator model. With the help of the risk
score, users (city authorities, planners so on) can categorize
the wards into various levels of risk and further select the ward
to see how the risk score varies with changes in the current
ward medical infrastructure facilities. The risk score initially
calculated by the model is used as the reference (R). Using the
simulator tool, they can understand and analyze the impact of
incremental variations in the ward facilities like the number
of beds (x) and hospitals(y) over the risk score during the
analysis period. The tool can also help users make decisions
on further improving the current ward medical infrastructure
facilities. Figure 12 shows the user interface for the simulator
tool.
As a first step, a user selects the ward and based on the
existing data, the model predicts the risk score (R) of the
ward. The initial details are shown in the table on the screen.
With this as the reference, the user can fine-tune the input
parameters like the number of beds(x1) and hospitals(y1) to be
further added under the parameter fine-tuning section to get the
new risk score (R1). In the backend, for the selected ward, the
simulator tool collects the static data (Features 2,3,4,5,6) from
the database. Further, using the previously available data for

the ward, the tool forecasts the value for the features (Features
1 and 13) for the entered date using the Prophet model. The
accuracy of the forecasting model is validated with the actual
data for a few wards as shown in Table VII. Using these inputs,
the tool predicts the new risk score for the entered inputs.
Figure 13 shows the simulated risk scores. Table VIII shows
how risk scores for a few wards changed with the change in
input features.
From the predicted risk scores, it is evident that the potential
risk level of the wards can be reduced by improving the ward
medical infrastructure facilities (number of beds, hospitals).
In most of the wards, increasing the ward facilities resulted in
a change in the ward risk zones. However, it must be noted
that no single attribute or feature can individually explain the
measure of ward risk. Therefore, using this tool, the user can
vary the inputs related to the number of beds and hospitals
that can be added to the ward and precisely understand how
it impacts the risk score. Users can accordingly increase the
value of the input features till the ward risk reduces to an
acceptable level. This type of impact analysis in turn assists the
authorities to make informed decisions to increase the medical
infrastructure facilities in the ward during the pandemic.
IV. Discussion of Results

COVID-19 risk score for PMC-Pune in detail during the

pandemic. AQI information was collected from air sensors
deployed across the city and mapped to their respective wards.
During Phase 1, 29 of the 34 wards showed improvement in
the AQI levels. This improvement was majorly seen due to the
strict lockdown rules imposed across the country to limit the
movement of the population. While 21 out of 26 wards and
15 out of 31 wards showed improvement in the AQI levels
during the Maintenance Phase and Phase 2, respectively. The
surge in the AQI levels can be associated with the minimal
restrictions during the unlock phases in the country, increased
vehicular movements, increased energy consumption, and an
increase in industrial operations related to the production of es-
sential supplies. The significant decrease in certain parameters
across the months can be attributed to nationwide lockdown,
implementation of protocols, and other precautionary measures
taken by the people during the pandemic to curb the COVID-
19 cases across the country. Overall, AQI varied by 48%,
sound by 18%, Ozone by 51%, NO2 by 37%, SO2 by 29%
and PM2.5 by 47% from March 2020 to July 2021.
Further, the simulator tool introduced in this paper fore-
casted the dynamic parameters like the AQI levels in the
ward with 94.5% accuracy. Along with the user inputs, these
forecasted values were used to simulate the risk scores of the
wards. From the simulator results, the impact of improving
ward-level medical and infrastructural facilities and its asso-
ciation with the ward risk score became evident. This tool
not only helps authorities foresee hotspots or AQI levels in
the wards over days, and categorize wards based on their risk
levels but also helps them make informed decisions on incre-
mental improvements in the ward medical and infrastructure
facilities during challenging situations like the pandemic.
V. Conclusion and Future Work
This paper provides an in-depth Spatio-temporal analysis
of the AQI levels of the wards in PMC-Pune. Since our
study is done at a granular ward level, with such analysis
it becomes easier for authorities and city planners to take
action in improving the overall environmental health and living
conditions of the city. The study highlights how the air quality
and other air pollutants varied in the wards over the months
in PMC-Pune during the pandemic. With the imposition of
restrictions, the wards saw significant improvements in the
AQI. Thus, it advocates the need to improve the overall envi-
ronmental health conditions of the wards in the city. Further,
the simulator tool introduced in this work, helps authorities
foresee and understand the impact of the risk score in the
ward with incremental variations in the ward facilities during
the pandemic. City planners can use this tool to assess and
estimate the required increase in the ward medical facilities
that would bring in a reduction in the ward risk score. Thus,
this tool acts as an aid that assists city planners in their ward
planning activities. When the overall condition of the ward
improves, its ability to handle situations like the pandemic
increases. With better facilities, the living conditions in the
ward can improve and the ward can gradually attain self-
sufficiency. Overall, this paper is based on the data available
in PMC-Pune. However, the same can be extended to other
smart cities where similar data is available.
