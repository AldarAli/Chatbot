Abstract— The aim of this work is to enhance the side channel
information that is revealed by the power consumption of a
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). An initial measure-
ment setup is proposed for measuring the signal quality, and
then adjustments and modifications to the hardware are done
to enhance this quality. Once an acceptable signal is measura-
ble, data is gathered and useful information in this raw data is
determined using a standard leakage assessment methodology.
The used methodology generates a quantitative score regard-
ing the presence of useful information in the raw data, and can
therefore indicate whether a system is vulnerable to side chan-
nel attacks or not. In this work, several modifications are pre-
sented along with their effect on the captured signal’s quality
and the amount of useful information in the collected raw data.

INTRODUCTION
Even though modern key-based encryption algorithms
are in theory considered as mathematically secure, this as-
sumption is not valid for their respective implementations.
Sophisticated techniques like Side Channel Attacks (SCAs)
can take advantage of certain implementation characteristics
to reveal secret information of their inner state [1] - pp.180,
which then, in turn, can be used to reconstruct the crypto-
graphic key in use [2]. As the name states, this kind of attack
is performed on side channels, information channels, which
unintentionally disclose internal information of a device.
Common side channels are power consumption, execution
time, acoustic and ElectroMagnetic (EM) radiation [1] -
pp.181. A power analysis attack for example exploits the
data-dependent nature of the switching activity of a crypto-
graphic implementation. Since these attacks can be non-
invasive and only use information extracted from physical
observation, it is difficult to detect them and consequently
one cannot be sure if a secret key is already compromised
[2].
The most common side channel analysis is power based,
which is also the focus of this work. A measurement setup is
presented that gathers side channel information leaked from
the power consumption of an FPGA board. The board is
modified in multiple stages, while collecting data on every
stage and conducting analysis on it to evaluate each modifi-
cation. The evaluation is performed by collecting side chan-
nel information of an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
implementation running on an FPGA and rating it according
to its impact. Contrary to other works in this field [3]-[7],
this paper focuses on FPGA evaluation boards that have
higher similarity with commercially available products,
rather than using boards designed for physical security anal-
ysis of cryptographic modules, such as SCA Standard Eval-
uation Board (SASEBO) and SCA User Reference Architec-
ture (SAKURA) board [7]. One example board designed
specifically for security analysis is the SAKURA-X, which is
equipped with a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA for cryptographic
circuits and a Spartan-6 as control unit. Usually, the focus of
measurement setups based on these boards is the security
evaluation of an algorithm’s implementation and correspond-
ing countermeasures. Performing side channel attacks on
them is considerably easier, which is also a reason why they
are not used in practice [7].
This work aims to depict possible obstacles while prepar-
ing off-the-shelf FPGA boards for side channel attacks and
show how to overcome them. Rather than performing a suc-
cessful key extraction itself, it should support other research-
ers at successfully leveraging all available side channel in-
formation. The main contributions of this work are:

a systematic modification approach for a state of the
art FPGA evaluation board to enable power-based
side channel attacks,

an improvement of common measurement setups by
FPGA board modifications, e.g., replacing resistors
and removing capacitors,

an improvement of common measurement setups by
optimizing soft parameters, such as logic frequency,

quantifying the quality of a measured signal for spe-
cific modifications and

assessing the amount of useful information within
captured raw data, once the signal reaches an ac-
ceptable level of quality.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents related work. The measurement setup is explained
in Section III, while improvements of the setup are presented
in Section IV. Section V presents an evaluation of the meas-
urement data. Finally, Section VI provides a conclusion.

RELATED WORK
The first published work on SCA goes back to Kocher in
1996, where it was shown that the variation in execution
time of an algorithm can leak information [8]. This leakage

information can be used to extract secret keys used in the
algorithm. SCAs can be classified in several ways; this work
will refer to the classification presented by Zhou and Feng in
[9], which is based on the following three criteria.

Control over the computation process: According to
this classification, an SCA can be an active attack if
the attacker influences the behavior of the system
and observes the difference in the operation or in-
formation leaked. A passive attack, on the other
hand, refers to SCAs where the attacker does not in-
terfere with the operation of the target system. Fault
Injection (FI) attacks are an example of the former,
while power analysis attacks are of the later type.

Way of accessing the module: This classification di-
vides SCAs into three different types, namely inva-
sive, semi-invasive and non-invasive attacks [10].
These types refer to the degree of tampering done to
the system for acquiring information. Non-invasive,
being the lowest degree equals no hardware modifi-
cation. On the other hand, invasive attack means ex-
tensive modification that could include depackaging
the Integrated Circuit (IC), capacitor removal or
changing resistors.

Methods used in the analysis process: This third
classification is based on the process used to analyze
the acquired data. The attack could be characterized
as Simple SCA (SSCA) if there is a direct relation
between the leakage information and the secret.
However, if SSCA is not possible due to high noise,
statistical methods can be used to extract the secret.
Such attacks will be classified as Differential SCA
(DSCA) [9].
Zhou and Feng in [9] also discussed known SCAs,
which are timing, fault, power analysis, Electro-Magnetic
(EM), acoustic, visible light, error message, frequency-
based, cache-based and scan-based attacks. The measure-
ment setup and modifications presented in this work are
intended for power analysis. They require some modifica-
tion to the board and use statistical methods for information
analysis, but they do not control the algorithm’s execution.
Consequently, our setup can be used for passive semi-
invasive differential SCA. The term “differential” in this
case should not be confused with Differential Power Analy-
sis (DPA) [13]. In power-based SCAs, Simple Power Anal-
ysis (SPA) comes under SSCA, while DPA, Correlational
Power Analysis (CPA) [11] and Test Vector Leakage As-
sessment (TVLA) [17][18] come under the category of
DSCA.
SPAs interpret the power consumption measurements di-
rectly, which means that the attacker tries to extract a key
using one or few traces [12]. In practice, these attacks are
not considered a major threat because they require detailed
knowledge of the implementation of the cryptographic algo-
rithm. In contrast, DPA does not require detailed knowledge
of the target setup and can extract a key even if traces con-
tain noise [12]. A trace is a set of measurement points that
are measured during execution of the target algorithm, in
this case AES. CPA, introduced by Brier et al. [11] and
currently the most commonly used SCA, is based on the
estimated correlation between the power traces of a hypo-
thetical model and measured power traces.
In this work, evaluation of the leaked information is
done using TVLA [18]. TVLA was first introduced in 2011
in Non-Invasive Attack Testing Workshop [17]. This ap-
proach requires execution of a cryptographic algorithm with
pre-specified input vectors and then performs statistical tests
on the measured power consumption. These tests produce
scores, which can clearly show whether a cryptographic
algorithm is leaking sensitive information or not. The ad-
vantage of performing TVLA analysis is that it is faster by
multiple orders of magnitude in comparison to key extrac-
tion attacks, such as DPA and CPA. In addition, it is also
real-time meaning the test can be performed as the meas-
urement data is being collected. Between the two types of
TVLA tests, this work utilizes general TVLA, which com-
pares measurements from a device performing AES on fixed
inputs and from a device performing AES on random inputs.
According to [18], non-specific tests are most successful in
leakage assessment.
For executing a successful attack, authors in [14]
showed that removing decoupling capacitors and powering
the device from accumulators via linear stabilizers make the
environment ideal. They were able to extract the key by
analyzing just 5,000 traces. The target device used in this
attack was a Spartan 3E Starter Board. Moradi et al. in [16]
presented a successful SCA on Virtex 4 and Virtex 5 Xilinx
devices by targeting the internal bitstream decryption en-
gine. In addition, a comparison of SASEBO and SAKURA
boards, discussed earlier, is presented by Nomata et al. in
[6], where it is said that one thousand to two thousand
waveforms are required for obtaining all bytes of the key
with SASEBO-G, SASEBO-GII and SAKURA-G boards.
On SAKURA-X, additional amplification of the waveform
is required to extract keys. SASEBO-G comes with a Xilinx
Virtex-II, SASEBO-GII with a Xilinx Virtex-5, SAKURA-
G with a Xilinx Spartan-6 and SAKURA-X with a Kintex-7
[7]. Our work is different from the rest as we are targeting a
comparatively newer FPGA placed on a Xilinx Evaluation
Board rather than on a FPGA board designed for side chan-
nel analysis specifically.

MEASUREMENT SETUP
A.
Target Cryptographic Algorithm
In the measurement setup, the target algorithm is a
hardware implementation of AES [15] with 128-bit key
length. Implementation executes within 13 clock cycles,
where the round keys are generated in the first two, and then
a round of AES is executed during each clock. The 16 S-
boxes of the Byte Substitution (BS) Layer are implemented
as lookup tables and are executed in parallel in one clock
that should make the attack harder in comparison to an im-
plementation that executes one S-box per clock. AES is

packaged in the Advanced Extensible Interface (AXI) and
communication between AXI-wrapped AES on the FPGA
and host computer is realized via a JTAG-to-AXI interface.

Basics of Power Analysis
The power consumption of FPGAs, as with all integrat-
ed circuits, is divided into dynamic and static power. Dy-
namic Power Consumption (DPC) is caused by changes of
signal values, while static power is always present even
when no signal transitions occurs [24]. DPC can be correlat-
ed with specific bits [1] - pp. 300. At a fixed point in time,
an
output
signal
of
a
Complementary
Metal-Oxide-
Semiconductor (CMOS) cell can perform one of four transi-
tions [12] - pp. 29. The transitions 0→0 (P00) and 1→1 (P11)
cause only static power consumption, while 0→1 (P01) and
1→0 (P10) consume both static and dynamic power. The
exact values of P00, P01, P10 and P11 depend on the cell type
and process technology, but generally P00 ≈ P11 << P01, P10.
In addition, they depend on the data being processed [12] –
pp. 29.
Since registers in digital circuits are typically synchro-
nized by a clock signal, a current flow is caused by the sim-
ultaneous switching of the logic cells at each rising edge of
the clock. This current flow or the respective voltage drop
can be measured using a digital oscilloscope and thus electri-
cal signals can be recorded over a certain period. To measure
characteristics such as power or current with an oscilloscope,
it is necessary to generate a voltage signal that is proportion-
al to these characteristics. In a measurement setup for power
analysis attacks, there are two common ways for SCAs to
generate a voltage signal that is proportional to the power
consumption of the cryptographic device. It can either be
generated by placing a small measurement resistor between
negative (VSS) or positive supply voltage (VDD) of the device
and the source or ground. The current flowing through this
resistor causes a voltage that can then be measured.
The structure of all hardware components for doing so
and their communication is shown in Figure 1. An AES
implementation on the FPGA is triggered to encrypt multiple
plaintexts while the attached oscilloscope measures the con-
sumed power and transfers all captured data to a host ma-
chine.
The target device is a Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable
SoC ZC702 Evaluation Kit v1. This board contains a Zynq-
7000 XC7Z020-1CLG484C with 85,000 logic cells.
Figure 1. Measurement Setup
The Zynq-7000 series integrates an ARM Cortex-A9
based processor and a 28nm programming logic (PL). The
evaluation board includes Low Pin Count - FPGA Mezza-
nine Card (FMC) connections to attach an FMC debug
board. This is used to connect the digital channels of the
oscilloscope.
Additionally, the board has three power controllers, each
managing several switching regulators. The power control-
lers are PMBus-compliant system controllers from Texas
Instruments. This allows the voltage and current levels to be
set [25]. Every controller monitors different voltages. One is
responsible for the core voltages, one for the auxiliary volt-
ages and the third for the 3.3 V and 2.5 V supply voltages.
The core voltage includes VCCINT and VCCPINT among others.
VCCINT is the 1V internal supply voltage for the PL [26] and
therefore the target voltage for power analysis attacks on the
PL. The evaluation board by default contains a
meas-
urement resistor connected to a voltage amplifier that can be
used for this purpose.
A Keysight MSO9104A oscilloscope with a resolution of
8 bits, a bandwidth of 1GHz and up to 20 GS/s sampling rate
is used to perform the actual measurement. The settings of
this oscilloscope are adjusted to match the target AES algo-
rithm. The horizontal resolution is set to equal the period of
one full AES round. For vertical resolution, the entire verti-
cal range of the oscilloscope is used. The signal is sampled
with a Keysight N2750A active differential probe with 1.5
GHz bandwidth. The tip of the probe is soldered to the corre-
sponding measuring point on the board.
Test data in form of plaintexts is generated according to
the TVLA specifications and sent to an AES core implemen-
tation on the programmable logic, utilizing a 128-bit sym-
metric key. A measurement is started at the beginning of
every first AES round and all results are transferred back as
raw data using Ethernet. Each measurement consists of an
averaging of the same plaintext, which is performed directly
on the oscilloscope. Figure 2 shows the resulting measure-
ment plot.

AES run (left) and an average of 128 AES runs (right) respectively.
IV.
IMPROVING THE MEASUREMENT SETUP
In order to perform a power analysis attack, the captured
data needs to meet certain quality standards. Data quality
can be compared using peak-to-peak voltage (VP2P) during
execution of AES encryption, which should be at least 3mV
according to related measurements on a SAKURA-X board
[6] in order to allow successful power analysis attacks. The
55

initial measurement, shown in Figure 2, shows ten peaks
corresponding to the ten AES rounds performed. The signal
quality is not sufficient to isolate intermediate computations
like S-Box calculation, which are typically needed for dif-
ferential power analysis, therefore no VP2P can be calculat-
ed.
In order to improve data quality, multiple changes are
possible. First, the internal measuring resistor can be re-
placed to generate a higher voltage drop and therefore a
stronger signal. Secondly, the supply voltage VCCINT can be
stabilized by using an external power source to eliminate
unrelated fluctuations [21]. Finally, fluctuations related to
the actual AES execution can be amplified by removing
capacitors from the board. The descriptions and results of
the individual steps are discussed in the following sections.
A.
Replacement of the Internal Measuring Resistor
As explained before, a measuring resistor is needed to
generate an observable signal, where the exact resistance has
to be chosen in a prudent manner. A higher value means
higher voltage fluctuation, which is easier to measure [21].
However, the voltage drop across the resistor reduces the
voltage that arrives at the cryptographic circuit. This in turn
results in a lower power consumption of the cryptographic
device, making it harder to measure. Therefore, a suitable
trade-off has to be found for the resistance. Due to the very
low resistance of the internal resistor, the resulting voltage
drop is comparably low; consequently, it should be replaced.
Based on experiments with other boards [19] [20], a
and a
resistor respectively is evaluated for best results.
The plotted data is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Even
though the single AES rounds are still not visible using high-
er resistance, the VP2P amplitude increased to roughly 1mV
(0.1 ) or 1.5mV (1 ). Since the 1
resistor yields better
results it will be used in all subsequent experiments.

B.
External Power Supply
Using an external power supply can further improve
measurement quality by reducing noise on the voltage line,
i.e., VCCINT and VCCPINT [22] – pp. 6. Therefore, an Agilent
66319D Power Supply Unit (PSU) is used to power the pro-
grammable logic instead of the internal power supply. This,
however, interrupts the FPGA’s power-on sequence; hence,
it must be taken care of manually. For the programming
logic, the required power-on sequence is VCCINT → VCCBRAM
→ VCCAUX → VCCO, meaning the PSU has to be switched on
before the FPGA board. The switch-off sequence conse-
quently is in reverse order [26]. This change results in a
voltage amplitude of up to 2.3mV, as can be seen in Figure 5
(right). Moreover, this time the single S-Box calculations are
visible in the signal.
Figure 5. Average measured voltage signal using an external power
supply for 128 AES runs (left) and detailed zoom of the signal (right).
C.
Removing Capacitors
As can be seen in Figure 5 (left), the voltage signal is al-
most constant on a larger scale. This is due to multiple ca-
pacitors between VCCINT and GND, which effectively prevent
the power consumption from fluctuating – they smooth the
signal. This causes a masking of the required power infor-
mation and thus prevents power analysis attacks [23][28].

named according to device schematic.

To overcome this limitation, capacitors are removed if
possible. Some are necessary to ensure correct operation of
the FPGA. Again, the voltage is measured and plotted in
Figure 6. Compared to Figure 5 the individual AES rounds
are visible now. The VP2P signal amplitude increases to 3mV.

supply for 128 AES runs (left) and detailed zoom of the signal (right).
D.
Reducing AES Clock Frequency
High clock frequencies can cause the power consumption
signals to overlap in successive clock cycles, resulting in
noise in the measured data [12] - pp. 58. Quality of the
measured traces can therefore be further improved by lower-
ing the clock frequency of the cryptographic algorithm. Con-
sequently, the clock frequency is reduced from 30MHz to
3.125MHz. In order to keep the scenario as realistic as possi-
ble [6][12] - pp. 58 and [1] - pp.296, the frequency is not
lowered further. Average results for 128 measurement are
shown in Figure 7 next to the result for a frequency of
30MHz as comparison. The signal amplitude is clearly in-
creased, now ranging up to 4.3mV.
Figure 7. Average measured voltage using a frequency of 3.125 MHz
for a 128AES runs (right). Results with f=30MHz for comparison (left).
This section concludes here with TABLE 2, showing results
after each modification. The final value of 3.16mV shows
that the quality of the captured signal is high and is compa-
rable to the P2P value of 3mV reported in [6] using SA-
KURA-X Board.

EVALUATION OF SIDE CHANNEL INFORMATION
Until now, the paper presented several modifications and
their effect on the quality of a captured signal. In this section,
we will evaluate how much information is leaked by the
cryptographic module after each modification.
For this, a general TVLA test is performed, which is
conducted on two different sets of plaintext, i.e., random and
fixed [17]. Encryption is performed on the random as well as
on the fixed plaintext with the same key, and the measure-
ment data is randomized for eliminating time dependent
distortions. According to [17], if the test score is higher than
4.5 or lower than -4.5, the test is failed meaning the device is
leaking enough information for a successful attack.
A.
External Power Supply and 1Ω Measuring Resistor 
Measurement data from the setup with 1Ω measuring re-
sistor and external power supply is used to conduct a first
general TVLA test. For fixed and for random input, n traces
are collected. Two independent t-tests are performed; one by
comparing the first half of traces from both data sets and
another using the second half.
As shown in Figure 8, the maximum values of the first t-
test after about 20,000 traces are briefly above the threshold
of 4.5. However, because the values of the second t-test are
below the limit, the test is passed. General TVLA is then
applied to all measurements that is 60,000 random and
60,000 fixed inputs, which results in maximum t-value of
6.49.
Figure 8. General TVLA test with external power supply
B.
Removing Capacitors
Measurement data from the setup with external power
supply, replaced internal resistor and removed capacitors is
analyzed with TVLA as well. The test score crossed the
value of 4.5 after 2,373 TVLA traces and stayed above that
threshold afterwards, as can be seen in Figure 9. This corre-
sponds to the calculation of t-tests for 9,492 measured traces
(one TVLA trace is composed of four measured traces).
When the test is applied to all 120,000 traces, a maximum
test score of 28.45 results.

C.
Reduced Clock Frequency and Vertical Resolution
Two more parameters, namely AES clock frequency and
vertical resolution, are adjusted in order to get a better
TVLA score. TVLA is applied on the measurement data
while reducing clock frequency to 3.125MHz and setting the
vertical limit to 5.9mV/div including all the previous modi-
fications. This results in a maximum t-value of 14.23, which
is lower than the 28.45 with a clock frequency of 30MHz
and 5.9mV/div vertical resolution. However, when the ver-
tical resolution is adjusted to 2.3mV/div using Zone Trigger
[29][30], a maximum t-value of 60.58 is achieved which can
be seen in Figure 10. This is the highest t-value reached by
any modification presented in this paper.
Figure 10. General TVLA test with external power supply, removed
capacitors, 3.125MHz frequency.
The maximum t-values for all the modifications are
summarized in TABLE 3. The t-value achieved with the
final measurement setup is 60.58, which is comparably
lower than 190 achieved on a SAKURA-G Board. However,
the higher value could be attributed to the 65nm technology
node of the Xilinx Virtex-5 used on the SASEBO-GII board
[7][17].

CONCLUSION
This work presents steps to implement a measurement
setup that can capture leakage information. The target hard-
ware, a commercial off-the-shelf board, is modified iterative-
ly and the parameters of the setup are adjusted to acquire a
higher quality signal for post processing. To compare the
quality of the signal, the peak-to-peak amplitude is used. The
resulting peak-to-peak voltage is 3.16mV, which is compa-
rable to SAKURA-X Board's P2P value that is approx. 3mV.
Once an acceptable quality of signal is achieved, measure-
ment data is gathered, which is then put through a methodol-
ogy to check whether the data contains useful information or
not. For this purpose, Test Vector Leakage Assessment is
used. The result of each modification and adjustment is
shown for both cases, i.e., signal quality and leakage infor-
mation. However, results of the general TVLA test show a
relatively low t-value (60.58) in comparison to a SASEBO-
GII board, which could be attributed to the smaller 28nm
node of the device under target. The setup could be further
tweaked to increase the t-value if necessary, though the cur-
rent t-value already suggests that the platform is vulnerable
to power analysis attacks.
