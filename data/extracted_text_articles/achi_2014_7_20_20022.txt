Abstract—Comparing active and passive modes with wrist 
flexion/extension motions, the authors examined the posture 
angle perception and reproduction characteristics through 
psychophysical experiments using a mechanically haptic wrist 
interface: mean values and standard deviations of the 
perceptual/reproduced angle errors were obtained, and were 
examined by ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA).   The 
characteristics can be applied to wearable haptic interfaces 
employing kinesthetic sensations in a form of an instruction 
scheme referred to as a “restrained instruction”: the restrained 
instruction is based on the idea that the just-noticeable small 
amount of externally applied forces being would be enough for 
learners to trigger voluntary motions with their body elements.

 INTRODUCTION 
In 
recent 
years, 
exoskeleton 
robotic-suits 
and 
rehabilitation-systems have been developed in various forms 
such as full-bodies [1][2], gait rehabilitations [3], arms 
[4][5][6]. It was also realized as grounded instruction 
systems [7]. They exerted large enough forces for person 
body elements to be moved passively  
Contrary to these power assisting systems, pose and 
kinesthetic senses embodied in human bodies can be utilized 
for motion instruction in the form of body-worn haptic 
interfaces. As with the kinesthetic-sensation-based motion 
instruction schemes, J. Iqbal et al. presented a prototype of 
hand exoskeleton-type finger motion-assisting device for 
accomplishing common daily life activities, and showed 
some optimization algorithms for mechanical design [8][9]. 
Muscle spindles are so sensitive to notice muscle 
contractions, and, therefore, noticeable threshold levels of 
human joint flexion/extension movements were reported to 
be a very small level of less than 0.1 degrees [10][11]. Thus, 
the thresholds were very small, which give us a suggestion 
that we need not a large amount of external stimuli for 
notifying us of the movements.  
Considering this point, the authors have been developing 
interfaces that are characterized by featuring a novel 
instruction scheme, i.e., just-noticeably small-force scheme: 
it is assumed that the just-noticeable small external forces 
would be enough to trigger learners to voluntarily move their 
muscles. We call the voluntary motion as “active”, and the 
scheme as a “restrained instruction”. The restrained 
instruction scheme has an advantage of small power, and 
makes systems compact and light weighted. Furthermore, the 
actively-inspired-motion-based 
instruction 
scheme 
is 
expected to be effective for learning motions compared to 
the passively-forced-motion-based instruction scheme. Here, 
as for the with/without human-initiative effects on the 
performances, some results were summarized by Proske and 
Gandevia [12]. As for the effects of muscle conditioning on 
position sense at the human elbow flexors, T. J. Allen et al. 
reported in the left/right forearms matching task that there 
were not significant differences with respect to the effect of 
the sense of effort [13]. Contrary to this, S. C. Gandevia et al. 
showed a role for efferent outflow signals in the mean that 
motor commands contribute to human position sense [14], 
and the effects of human initiative were not confirmative. 
Thus, paying attention to the initiative factor, the authors 
have studied on absolute-angle perceptual characteristics 
with the wrist flexion/extension using a mechanically haptic 
wrist interface as well as the elbow joint [15].  
Learning some specific postures is one of the important 
processes in motion learning processes: for examples, still-
posed postures are essential for some exercises such as 
“yoga” 
positions, 
and, 
even 
in 
dynamic 
motions, 
instantaneous postures at the motion-phase transitions are 
also crucial. Especially in the case of the restrained 
instruction, we shall feel it difficult to notice the external 
exhilarated motions than in the other case of forcible 
instructions. Even in such cases, we would be able to notice 
the joint angle changes between the before-and-after 
instructions if the changes were larger than Just Noticeable 
Differences (JNDs). Therefore, the JNDs are useful for 
learning some specific postures, and were examined as well 
as the mean errors in this paper. 
Section II explains the psychophysical experimental 
method, i.e., apparatus and procedures, for examining the 
wrist flexion/extension angle perceptual characteristics. Next, 
Section III first presents the experimental results, and 
examines the systematic and random errors: the former is

given by the mean error and the latter is by the standard 
deviations. Both the errors suggest reproducibility in the 
still-posed posture reproductions after motion learning 
procedures. Finally, Section IV addresses the conclusion and 
future work.

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
This section describes the psychophysical experimental 
method, i.e., apparatus and procedures, for examining the 
wrist 
flexion/extension 
angle 
perception/reproduction 
performances in the extension/flexion motions. Here, 
assuming that there might be a difference in the 
performances with respect to subject initiative, the authors 
introduced two levels of a subject initiative factor to make a 
comparative study: one level is an active haptic scheme, and 
the other one is a passive haptic scheme.  
A. Apparatus 
A simple wrist-bending apparatus was designed to carry 
out a psychophysical experiment for examining the wrist 
flexion/extension angle perceptual characteristics. Figure 1 
shows the experimental apparatus. A servo-motor was 
attached to a lower side of the gate-shaped aluminum frame. 
The servo-motor exerts torques, and makes subject’s wrist to 
forcibly do flexion/extension motions via cushion-buffered-
holders.

B. Procedures 
1) Conditions: In this experiment, a back-and-forth 
motion from an initially instructed before-bend angle, via 
another angle that were given as mask stimulus, to the after-
bend angle was tested. Relating to the back-and-forth 
motion, kinesthetic sense characteristics, i.e., wrist-bend 
perceptual characteristics, were examined.  
Here, focusing attention to the motion initiative factor, 
the authors introduced two levels: one is a passive haptic 
mode, and the other is an active haptic mode. The passive 
haptic mode (Pa) is considered to be a representative 
passive-based instruction. The subject does not take initiative, 
but the actuator forcibly rotated the subject’s wrist. An 
ability to notice the deviations of the after-bend angles from 
the before-bend angles was examined: perceptual errors of 
the differences between the initially instructed angles and the 
returned angles were examined in this mode. The active 
haptic mode (Ac) represents a realization concept of “the 
restrained instruction scheme” proposed in this paper. The 
subject takes initiative, and voluntarily activates the wrist 
flexion/extension. An ability to reproduce the initially 
instructed angles after an active bending process was 
examined in this mode. That is, the reproduction errors 
between the initially instructed before-bend angles and the 
returned after-bend angles, to which subjects voluntarily bent 
their wrist so as to reproduce the initially instructed angles, 
were examined.  
In addition to the initiative, the subject and the interaction 
factors, the other two factors, i.e., an initial angle factor, and 
an angular velocity factor were examined. The levels of the 
initial angle factor were (1) the straight wrist condition, i.e., 
0°, (2) a medium level of dorsiflexion condition of -30°.  The 
other levels of the angular velocity factor were (1) a 
relatively higher speed of 30°/s, (2) a lower speed of 10°/s. 
Right handed four male subjects aged 23 to 59 
participated in the experiment. Thus, the total number of 
factor level combinations was given by 32(=2×2×2×4). As 
described in the next section, for each of the factor level 
combinations, tasks were repeated by 10 runs, and, therefore, 
the total number of runs was 320(=32×10). 
 
2) Task and Procedure: The procedure was composed 
of pre-steps and perceptual steps as in the followings. 
[Pre-step 1] The subject sat on a chair, and his right hand 
was held tight to the equipment via the opposing cushions, 
so that his forearm being horizontal and their upper arm 
being vertical. 
[Pre-step 2] The subject closed his eyes, and a white noise 
sound was applied to the subject via headphones for 
masking any sound cues on the perception.  
The perceptual steps were implemented for both the 
passive and active modes:

a) Passive mode: This mode was carried out by the 
following procedures (see Figure 2).  
 
 
Preparatory step                     [Step1] Test target stimulus acceptance. 
 
 
[Step3] Mask stimulus acceptance 
[Step4] Pseudo-test stimulus acceptance 
Figure 2.  Experimental procedures in the passive mode 
[Step1] Passive test target stimulus acceptance: the system 
forcibly bent a subject wrist from an arbitrary position to 
an initial angle using the servomotor.  This step simulated a 
process of forcible initial position learning process. 
[Step2] The subject was informed that his wrist angle had 
come to the initial position. 
[Step3] Passive mask stimulus acceptance: the system 
forcibly bent the subject wrist to approximately -60° in the 
dorsiflexion 
direction. 
This 
process 
simulated 
a 
consecutively delivered passive instruction. 
[Step4] Passive pseudo-test stimulus acceptance: the system, 
finally, forcibly returned the subject wrist to a destination 
angle chosen from a set of angles a little bit deviated from 
the initial angle: the deviations from the initial angle were  
-20°, -16°, -12°, -8°, -4°, 0°, 4°, 8°, 12°, 16°, 20°. Ten 
kinds of deviations were chosen for them and were 
presented. This process also simulated the second-
consecutively delivered passive instruction.  
[Step5] Looking at an answer board being set horizontally, 
the subject opened his eyes, and answered the amounts of 
his perceived value with the deviation of the destination 
angle from the initial angle: the answer board was a 
protractor-like scale, the fineness of which   was 1° (see 
Figure 3). The ability to notice deviations was considered 
to be related to an ability for passive posture reproductions. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Answer board: subjects chose a character showing the amounts 
of their perceived angular difference between the before-and-after-bend 
angle. 
b) Active mode: This mode was carried out by the 
following procedures (see Figure 4).  
 
 
Preparatory step                     [Step1] Test target stimulus acceptance. 
 
 
[Step3] Mask stimulus self-production  
[Step4] Test stimulus self-reproduction  
Figure 4.  Experimental procedures in the active mode:  there is no 
difference in the appearance between this figure and Figure 3. The crucial 
difference is in whether there is a subject’s intention or not. 
 [Step1] Passive test target stimulus acceptance: the system 
forcibly bent the subject wrist to an initial angle using the 
servomotor. This step simulated a process of the forcible 
learning process. 
[Step2] The subject was informed that his wrist had come to 
the initial position. Then, the electrical current of the 
driving servomotor was cut off, which made the subject 
wrist to move freely with small torque being enough to 
cancel frictions induced at reduction gears.  
[Step3] Active mask stimulus self-production: the subject 
bent one’s wrist up to the mechanical limit. This process 
simulated a process where learners themselves voluntarily 
change their postures. 
[Step4]  Active test stimulus reproduction: the subject bent 
one’s wrist up towards the initial position. This process 
was another voluntarily changing process, and simulated a 
process to reproduce the specific postures instructed before. 
[Step5] The system measured the subject wrist angle. 
A series from Step 1 to Step 5 was repeated ten times.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section, the experimental results are first presented, 
and, then, they are examined from the viewpoint of the mean 
errors and the standard deviations. The mean errors represent 
biases, and are, so-called, the systematic errors. The standard 
deviations represent the widths of scattering, and are, so-
called, the random errors. Both the errors suggest 
reproducibility in the still-posed posture reproductions after 
motion learning procedures. The latter standard deviations 
will be also related to JNDs. 
A. Systematic Errors 
In the passive mode, the errors were defined by the 
perceived angle errors, i.e., the angular differences of the 
perceived angles from the true angles that had been deviated 
by -20° to 20° from the initial angles. On the other hand, 
those in the active mode were defined by the angular 
differences of the reproduced angles from the initial angles. 
As for the perceived/reproduced angle errors, the factors 
to be tested were the subject activity, the initial angles, the 
angular velocities, the subjects, and the interaction. Class 
means represent the systematic errors, and the experimental 
results with the global mean and the class means for three 
factors are shown in Figure 5.

The initiative factor (Ac/Pa) shows a significant 
difference with a 0.1% level. In the case of the active mode, 
there can be seen a tendency of systematic errors in the 
dorsiflexion direction, while, in the other case of the passive 
mode, there was an opposite tendency in the palmar flexion 
direction. From the viewpoint of the magnitudes, the active 
mode was superior to the passive mode. 
The angular velocity factor also shows a significant 
difference with a 0.1% level of significance. The factor 
effects of either the initiative factor or the angular velocity 
factor were 1 to 2 °. The subject factor and the interaction 
factor also show significant differences. The remaining 
initial angle factor alone shows no significant difference.  
The factor effects can be applied in the practical motion 
instruction: they enable us to estimate systematic errors and 
to cancel the errors. 
 
B. Random Errors 
The 
Standard 
Deviations 
(SDs) 
of 
the 
perceived/reproduced angle error variations represent the 
random errors, and, furthermore, can be converted an 
important measure of JND.   The JNDs suggest some limits 
of accuracies of angular instructions. 
Here, note that the JND represents the difference between 
a pair of stimuli, and is defined by the 75 % point in the 
psychometric curve. Therefore, if the psychometric curve is 
to be approximated by the normal distribution, the 
cumulative probability of 75 % corresponds to 0.674×SD. 
Thus, JNDs are approximately converted from the SDs by 
JND = 0.674 × SDsum                            (1)
where SDsum is given by the sum of the global mean SDgm 
and the three factor effects, EAc/Pa, EInitial angle, EAngular velocity. 
That is, 
 SDsum = SDm + EAc/Pa + EInitial angle + EAngular elocity

As for the converted JNDs, some of the experimental 
results with the global mean and the class means for three 
factors are shown in Figure 6.

The significances among the between-class variations of 
class means were, also, tested by repeated-ANOVA as 
shown in Table II. We can find the initiative factor (Ac/Pa) 
shows significant difference with the significant level of 
0.1%. Besides the initiative factor, we couldn’t find any 
significant difference for the other factors of the initial angle, 
the angular velocity, and the subject. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
For establishing a new motion instructing scheme, i.e., 
the restrained instruction scheme, the authors have studied 
kinesthetic sensation with wrist bending motions. 
 
As for the subject’s initiative, the active mode was 
superior to the other passive mode from both the 
viewpoints of the systematic errors and the random 
ones in an initial angle reproductions task. 
 
The former knowledge of the systematic errors 
enabled us to estimate and to cancel the errors. 
 
The latter results were converted into the JNDs, and 
the JNDs suggested some limits of accuracies of 
angular instructions. 
In the future, we will make a profound study on the 
kinesthetic sensations of wrist bending motions and will 
extend to other joint motions.
