Abstract— This paper explains a framework known as “Mobile 
Intelligent 
Advertising 
Framework” 
which 
provides 
personalized recommendations to the user in a privacy friendly 
manner. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, and tablets are 
everywhere now. So, retailers and advertisers want to rely 
more on mobile data to recommend products to their 
consumers and most importantly they want to understand 
consumer interests to recommend meaningful ones. Our 
framework includes an Android app, which tries to understand 
the user passively using the available mobile data that the user 
gives access to, such as browsing history, accelerometer data, 
call log history, etc., and recommends a product after data 
analysis. The app can also communicate with any digital sign 
nearby which triggers the sign to play targeted ads to the user 
viewing the sign instead of random ones. This paper explains 
the important components of the framework briefly and 
presents an overview of current state of the art in capturing 
user’s interests through mobile data for providing relevant 
recommendations. 
Keywords-Mobile; Intelligent Advertising Framework; Digital 
Signs; Data Mining; Lifestyle Analysis; Privacy. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, mobile devices such as smartphones and 
tablets have grown significantly and they present new 
opportunities and challenges. This applies to the field of 
retail too where retailers and advertisers now not only have a 
new medium to showcase their products and ads to their 
consumers but also should give importance to new and 
important fields such as mobile data to show relevant stuffs 
to the consumers. Mobile data is a good source of data for 
providing personalized recommendations. Unlike random 
ones, these personalized targeted recommendations such as 
ads can provide more value to the consumers thereby 
benefitting both retailers and advertisers too. There are few 
applications out there with context-aware platforms, such as 
Qualcomm’s Gimbal [7] and Google Now [6]. But, these do 
not address privacy as our framework attempts to do by 
handling all the analysis locally within the device.  
Our paper is organized in 3 sections. The first section is 
Introduction; the second section explains the entire 
framework, which is further divided into many subsections. 
The last section is the conclusion and future work.  
Section 2 begins by explaining the entire framework 
briefly. This is followed by describing the data needed for 
analysis, various data sources and its collection. This is 
followed by the description of the lifestyle analysis and the 
lifestyle model. Using this model, lifestyle analysis is done 
based upon which relevant recommendations are provided to 
the user. This is followed by the subsection, describing the 
various tools that were used to build the framework -
RapidMiner, Lingpipe. The following sub section explains 
the communication between the digital sign and the mobile 
phone, to play targeted ads on the sign instead of random 
ones which is followed by the explanation of the privacy 
importance 
emphasized 
by 
our 
framework 
which 
distinguishes it from many other existing context-aware 
platforms and finally the subsection presenting experiments 
and results.  
II. 
MOBILE INTELLIGENT ADVERTISING FRAMEWORK 
(MIAF) 
Big data in terabytes and petabytes is floating around 
from various sources, which can provide valuable insights on 
current and future trends of an industry. This applies to many 
industries, such as healthcare, transportation, retail, finance, 
and many more. Data have proved to be important in mobile 
too, 
which 
can 
be 
utilized 
to 
provide 
many 
recommendations, such as ads, fitness updates, etc. These 
mobile data can come from different sources and sensors. 
Some of them are call log data, browsing history, 
accelerometer data, battery usage, ambient light, app usage, 
location data and much more. Developing an intelligent 
framework which fetches the right data, integrates data from 
various sources, does analysis and provides relevant 
recommendations in a privacy friendly manner is not trivial. 
Our framework approaches to solve this problem. 
As essential part of MIAF, an Android app was created to 
facilitate data analysis within the mobile. When a user 
installs this app, he or she has to provide some minimum 
information to get recommendations which is age and gender 
bracket, e.g., Adult Male. The app can access only the part of 
mobile data to which the user gives permission to.

Fig. 1 explains the overall MIAF architecture briefly. We 
are collecting data, such as product reviews, cleaning the 
data and training a classification engine based on Lingpipe 
[3], a text processing tool kit suitable for mobiles.  The 
products selected are grouped into different age, gender, city, 
lifestyle groups (a/g/c/l, respectively). Lingpipe classification 
models for different a/g/c/l groups are built by training the 
model with respective products. Currently, we have around 
80 a/g/c/l profiles. So, there are 4 age groups (Child, Young 
Adult, Adult, and Senior), 2 genders, 2 cities and 5 lifestyles. 
For example, adult male, from New York with social 
lifestyle. So, when a user installs the app, information such 
as age, gender, location is easily captured and further 
lifestyle analysis of the user is done. Based on the user’s 
profile, the respective trained Lingpipe model is imported to 
the mobile. The new real-time mobile data, such as browsing 
history, Facebook and Twitter data are processed and passed 
into this model to get relevant product recommendations. So, 
the entire mining and analysis happens locally without the 
data leaving the device. Besides providing product 
recommendations, the app can also communicate to any 
digital sign nearby to play relevant ads and also this app can 
be integrated behind any retailer’s app who is interested in 
providing personalized recommendations to their loyal 
consumers. This framework also includes many other 
features, such as targeted advertising based on facial 
detection [1][9]; this paper mainly concentrates on the 
mobile part of the framework. 
A. Data 
The Lingpipe classification engine requires training data 
to provide product and lifestyle recommendations. Product 
reviews fetched from various websites served as a good 
source of training data using which valuable product insights 
were extracted for each of the product category. Reviews 
were preferred instead of product description as they can be 
correlated with the user’s data more and also reviews have 
become more important as consumers now trust reviews 
more than description before purchasing a product. A web 
crawler developed using PHP [14] was used to fetch the 
reviews for a set of preselected products. Further data based 
on different demographics (a/g/c) were obtained from 
Neilsen Company [5]. These data comprised of different 
kinds of mobile data, such as app usage data, browsing 
history, battery usage, call log data, etc. 
B. Lifestyle Analysis 
Knowing the lifestyle of a user helps to recommend 
better products as consumers usually buy products based on 
their lifestyles, e.g., a fitness cautious person may prefer 
product, such as running shoes, sports good, etc. 
Determining the lifestyle of a user after doing analysis of 
mobile data is not a trivial problem. MIAF architecture can 
recommend different lifestyles to a user which are social, 
talks a lot, travels a lot, fitness cautious and busy. The varied 
data sources used to determine lifestyle are call log (duration 
over some period), battery usage (percentage over some 
period), accelerometer (jogging, running or walking) and 
number of locations (e.g., number of distinct locations 
visited in a day) data. Table 1 depicts how data for 
recommending lifestyle looks for particular demographics 
after collecting and doing some analysis in a day. 
 
TABLE I. TABLE FOR LIFESTYLE ANALYSIS 
C. Lifestyle Model 
A lifestyle model was built using the historical data 
obtained from Neilsen [5] company. The varied data sources 
used to compute lifestyle were obtained based on different 
demographics, as shown in Table 1. To build this model, a 
weighted table was constructed by clustering each of the data 
sources into 5 groups (since 5 lifestyles) for every a/g/c 
group. K means clustering algorithm [10] was used and the 5 
centroids of the 5 clusters were assigned as weights for each 
of the data sources. Table 2 shows the weights computed for 
some of the data sources after clustering the historical data 
for a particular a/g/c group. Such weighted tables are created 
for all the data sources for every a/g/c profile. 
 
TABLE II. SAMPLE TABLE FOR LIFESTYLE MODEL 
 
These weights are used as multipliers; so, when the new 
user mobile data comes (all in numerical values), they are 
multiplied with these multipliers and finally summed up to 
determine one lifestyle. The lifestyle with the greatest weight 
will be selected. This is explained in Table 3; if Sum1 is the 
greatest, that particular user is tagged with social lifestyle. 
The weights are updated as and when, new data is collected 
and added to the historical data collection.

D. Rapidminer 
Rapidminer [2], an open source data mining tool, served 
as a scratchpad to understand and build some data mining 
models 
such as 
classification 
and 
clustering. This 
understanding eased the development process of MIAF app. 
Product reviews fetched from various websites were 
processed and a classification model based on Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) [11] was developed in Rapidminer. 
The measure of accuracy of the model gave some confidence 
to build the same on the Android Mobile platform. SVM 
outperformed other classification engines, such as K- Nearest 
Neighbor (KNN) [13] and Naïve Bayes  [12]. 
Rapidminer was also used for implementing clustering 
algorithm for detection of lifestyle as discussed above. K – 
Means clustering algorithm served well as we wanted to 
divide the data into 5 (k = 5) lifestyles to find 5 centroids.  
E. Lingpipe 
Lingpipe [3] is a Java-based framework text processing 
tool kit which served well for Android data mining. Its 
Software Development Kit (SDK) is easy to integrate with 
the mobile platform.  Lifestyle models were built based on 
different demographics as discussed above. Further, for 
various a/g/c/l profiles, Lingpipe product classification 
models are built for product recommendation and these are 
built offline in the cloud. Depending upon the user profile 
respective trained model is imported to the mobile through 
MIAF. Cloud is used to build all the pre-trained data models 
and storage of the same. None of the user information is 
pushed into the cloud as it is handled within the device itself. 
By having all the training handled in the cloud there is no 
overload on the mobile Central Processing Unit (CPU) and 
the battery, as training of the data model requires more CPU 
overhead. User privacy is also preserved by utilizing the 
cloud only for the required and by not pushing everything to 
it.  
TF-IDF 
(Term 
Frequency 
– 
Inverse 
Document 
Frequency) classifier [15] was used as it had better 
classification accuracy then other classifiers, such as Naïve 
Bayes [12]. SVM was not supported by Lingpipe. 
Tokenization, transformation of tokens, stop word removal, 
stemming and filtering of tokens was used for cleaning of 
text. Depending on the user profile (a/g/c/l), the respective 
model is imported from the cloud to the mobile to provide 
product recommendations. This model keeps updating, too, 
periodically, if needed. For example, if a user previously was 
in New York and recently moved to San Francisco, a new 
product model will be imported to the user mobile to provide 
relevant product recommendations. 
MIAF app receives mobile data which are made up of 
browsing history keywords, twitter keywords and Facebook 
keywords. Browsing pages are parsed and top n words based 
on TF-IDF score are extracted, same with Facebook page 
and Twitter page. All these top TF-IDF words extracted are 
concatenated and passed into the model imported into the 
mobile to recommend products. All the word vectors are 
stored in SQLite database [16] within the device. So, no user 
mobile data leaves the mobile. The data are cleaned from 
SQLite every week, so that there is no overload on the 
database and not cleaned very frequently too for the creation 
of meaningful user profiles.  Currently, in a device, products 
can be recommended from 100 product lists. 
F. Talking of Mobile and Digital Sign 
Digital signs [4] are part of every industry where they are 
present in airports, shopping malls and retailer shops. MIAF 
app can make the ads played on the digital sign more 
valuable. To bring more value for ads, we wanted our app to 
talk with the digital sign. Extensible Messaging and Presence 
Protocol (XMPP) [17], a messaging protocol was used to 
establish this communication channel. So, when a user with 
MIAF app walks near any digital sign communication 
channel between them is built and the ad played on the 
digital sign will be related to the ad recommended on the 
user’s mobile. This is explained in Fig. 2, where the 
communication between the mobile and the digital sign is 
established using XMPP, iPhone ad is played on the sign 
after the word  “iPhone”  is transferred from mobile to the 
sign.

G. Privacy 
Most of the applications that exist now do not handle 
user’s data securely, as most of the mobile data analysis are 
pushed into the cloud due to limited mobile computing 
resources. Our app handles all the required analysis locally in 
the mobile with minimal effect on the battery usage. Only a 
single word vector such as iPad, sun glass, etc., goes out of 
the device. No user data are withheld. The user can opt in 
and opt out of the service anytime. The products or ads are 
targeted in a more generalized way, where the targeting is 
done based on demographics, but not for any particular 
individual. We are looking into adding more levels of 
security and privacy by encrypting the data and also 
investigating on integrating with McAfee [8] software on 
Android.

H. Experiments and Results 
MIAF app was shared among a few employees within the 
company for feedback and also among few customers. The 
results have been positive. Due to time constraints and other 
issues we have not documented the results for publishing 
purposes. But, we have conducted an experiment to prove 
targeted advertising is more relevant then non – targeted 
advertising based on AVA [1] technology, which is an Intel 
based technology used to target ads, based on demographics. 
The experiment was conducted in a supermarket over a 
period of 9 months. There was monthly sale increase of 16% 
and 3% monthly viewership time increase with targeted ads 
compared to non- targeted ones and the results are published 
[9]. By adding the mobile part, we believe sales and 
viewership can increase more bringing in more value to the 
consumers and the retailers too. Further, we compared MIAF 
to other similar applications out there. Google Now [6] has 
the proximity beacon missing and with Gimbal [7], the 
analytics apps need to be created by the customer and most 
importantly both the applications do not handle the analysis 
locally within the device like MIAF. 
III. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have attempted to explain a software 
framework for mobiles and digital signage using which 
relevant and personalized recommendations can be reached 
to the right consumer at the right time in a privacy friendly 
manner. With the limited data available, user’s interest is 
captured passively by analyzing the lifestyle of the user and 
all this analysis happens locally within the device to protect 
the privacy. Further, based on lifestyle relevant products are 
recommended. In the future, we want to make this 
application more efficient and scalable by adding more 
features such as Graph databases and also by expanding the 
product lists from 100’s to 1000’s. We are also extending the 
framework to not only recommend ads or products, but also 
predict next user’s activity, e.g., a user usually calls at noon 
every day; so, it is noon now and he/she may want to call. In 
the future, we want to extend MIAF to other platforms than 
Android.
