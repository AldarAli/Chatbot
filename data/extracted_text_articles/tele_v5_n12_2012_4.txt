I. 
INTRODUCTION 
At the beginning of the mobile Internet age, it becomes 
clear there is a strong need of mobile equipment able to 
maximize its wireless connectivity. 
There are several reasons that make extremely attractive 
the usage of multi-standard radio transceivers to enable the 
wireless interoperation of such mobile equipment, [1,2]. 
Firstly, a multi-standard solution is efficient as only one 
design is required to handle the mobile device wireless 
communication. Thus, the number of different dedicated ICs 
or IP blocks inside a large SoC is reduced. This simplifies 
the overall communication platform integration. 
Secondly, since only one design is required to cover for 
all the targeted wireless standards all cost related to the IP 
development and testing are minimized. 
The ideal multi-standard receiver was proposed by 
Mitola in [3]. The Software Defined Radio Receiver (SDRR) 
shown in Fig. 1.a is the optimal choice from system level 
perspective, as it comprises only an ADC. 
In reality, due to practical implementation constrains, a 
multi-standard receiver requires a signal conditioning block 
in between the antenna and the ADC. The SDRR concept 
shown in Fig. 1.b relaxes the ADC specifications by ensuring 
additional selectivity and amplification for the wanted signal. 
First, the paper focuses on finding the optimal 
architecture for the SDRR signal conditioning block that 
enables its monolithic integration.

Based on a detailed overview of the key receiver 
architectures, Section II introduces the optimal architecture 
for a SDRR that targets compatibility to the major 
commercial wireless standards listed in Table I. 
Second, the paper pursues the identification of the SDRR 
key electrical requirements and their values. Based on a 
systematic approach, the paper introduces a standard 
independent methodology for evaluating the SDRR 
performance. 
Section III defines the SDRR receiver sensitivity, NF and 
gain requirements, while Section IV analyses the blocker and 
interferers impact on the SDRR linearity requirements. 
Section V concludes the paper. 
II. 
INTRODUCING THE OPTIMAL ARCHITECUTRE OF THE 
SIGNAL CONDITIONING BLOCK 
This Section covers one of the paper’s goals that is to 
find the optimal architecture for the SDRR signal 
conditioning block enabling its monolithic integration. In 
Section II.A, the key receiver architectures are analyzed, 
while 
Section II.B 
determines 
the 
quadrature 
direct 
conversion topology suits best the envisaged purpose.  
Section II.C overviews the architectural changes that 
make the homodyne receivers ready for monolithical 
integration. The presented solutions are realized without 
introducing particular analog tricks to satisfy the needs of 
only one of the standards, as the SDRR must represent 
“universal receivers”, and not be turned into a “multi-
standard ASICs”. 
A. Overview of Key Receiver Architectures 
First of all, one of the most popular receiver architectures 
is the heterodyne architecture. It was developed in 1918 by 
Edwin Armstrong as a viable alternative to the regenerative 
receiver with respect to the technical issues of vacuum tubes 
implementation, [4].

The basic block schematic of this concept is depicted in 
Fig. 2. The original superheterodyne uses only one 
downconverter 
mixer 
(i. 
e., 
single 
conversion 
superheterodyne), and mixes the Radio Frequency, RF, input 
signal with the Local Oscillator, LO, signal. 
The resulting signal frequency is mixed down by the 
mixer (i. e., MIX in Fig. 2), to an Intermediate Frequency, 
IF, equal to the difference between the RF carrier and LO 
signal frequencies. 
Intrinsically the mixing process will render at the mixer 
output also the sum frequency component. For most 
applications this component represents an unwanted signal 
and is filtered by the band pass filter (i. e., BPF in Fig. 2) 
following the mixer and/or in the mixer output stage. 
The major issue of the heterodyne topology is the image 
frequency rejection. 
The issue is two symmetrical signals with frequencies 
spaced apart by twice the IF frequency are downconverted 
by LO mixing to the same IF frequency, as shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 2.  Single Conversion Superheterodyne Receiver Block Schematic. 
Generally, only one of the two sideband signals conveys 
useful information, while the other represents an unwanted 
image signal. 
Thus, for superheterodyne receivers image signal 
rejection is critical for a proper signal demodulation. 
The superheterodyne architecture solves the issue by 
filtering the image signal before it enters the mixer, or more 
precisely, immediately after the antenna in the external 
image reject filter (i. e., IRF in Fig. 2). 
The image rejection filter specifications depend on the IF 
value and they are more relaxed as the image frequency is 
larger, respectively as the distance between the RF carrier 
and its image is larger. 
Signal conditioning constraints, set by the channel 
selection filter located after the down conversion mixer (i. e., 
the second band pass filter of Fig. 2), prevent the choice of a 
very large IF. This toughens image filtering requirements. In 
practice, ceramic filters satisfy the constraints, but they 
possess two major drawbacks: they are quite expensive and 
by far not compatible with monolithic integration. 
Channel selection is also demanding, as for many 
applications channel bandwidth is fairly small compared 
with IF. In such context, bandpass Surface Acoustic Wave 
(SAW) filters are used for analog channel selection. But, 
these types of filters are unattractive to SoC ICs for the same 
two reasons as the ceramic antenna filters: incompatibility 
with monolithic integration and high cost. 
Basically, single conversion superheterodyne receiver 
design is driven by the trade-off between antenna and 
channel filtering, which imposes the optimum IF frequency.

Figure 3.  Down-conversion: a. without Image Rejection and b. with Image Rejection. 
 
Second of all, so far, the design of superheterodyne 
receivers has been optimized to alleviate image rejection 
rather than optimizing RF performance. Thus, using an 
image rejection receiver that implements a complex mixer to 
cancel out the unwanted image signal, removes the lock on 
architecture enabling the RF performance optimization. The 
principle schematic of such a receiver is depicted in Fig. 4.a. 
The complex mixer is made out of two mixers which 
share the same RF input, while the LO port is controlled by 
two quadrature signals. By adding a 90 degrees delay line in 
one signal path, the down converted image signals will be in-
phase, while the useful signals will be 180 degrees delayed. 
Hence, by considering the difference between the two paths 
the image signal is cancelled, while the useful signal is 
added. The major advantage of this approach is the antenna 
filtering becomes less critical. Thus, the use of expensive and 
bulky, external (off-chip), ceramic filters are no longer 
required. On the other hand, the image rejection now 
depends on the quadrature accuracy of both gain and phase 
of the LO and IF paths. If the two LO signals exhibit exactly 
90 degrees phase delay and have the same amplitude, while 
the gain of the two paths are perfectly matched, the 
unwanted image signal is completely rejected. 
Hence, image rejection receivers cancel out the image 
signals by subtracting two – potentially very large – signals, 
resulting in a difference that is theoretically equal to zero. 
 
However, any gain error or phase error between the two 
signal paths will determine an incomplete annihilation of the 
image signal. Thus the image rejection, IR, is given by, [10]:

where Gain represents the receiver’s gain, GainI-Qerr is the I-
Q gain mismatch and PhaseI-Qerr is the I-Q phase mismatch. 
Since accurate wide-band quadrature phase shifters are 
difficult to design, Weaver receivers of Fig. 4.b are 
preferred. 
To cancel the need for the 90 degrees phase shift on the 
signal path an extra pair of mixers and quadrature LO signals 
are required. Still, the LO signals quadrature accuracy, of 
both gain and phase, and the gain matching of the quadrature 
downconverted channels set the image rejection performance 
as described by (1). 
 
Third of all, all receiver architectures presented so far 
have to fight image rejection. In direct conversion receivers 
also known as homodyne receivers, the IF frequency is zero, 
hence, the useful signal is its own image.

Therefore, in a homodyne receiver (see Fig. 5) the image 
signal has an amplitude comparable to the useful signal, and 
hence, 
image 
rejection 
requirements 
are 
relaxed. 
Furthermore, all baseband processing, like analogue filtering, 
analog-to-digital conversion and the digital demodulation, 
take place at the lowest possible frequency. 
These features make the homodyne receiver an ideal 
candidate for monolithic integration and open the possibility 
of creating an “universal” receiver, compatible with all 
wireless standards, [4]. 
However, 
although 
direct 
conversion 
receivers 
monolithic integration seems straight forward there are 
several drawbacks to this approach. 
The second major issue of direct conversion architecture 
is that even order distortions generate a signal dependent DC 
offset. 
Another issue of such architecture is self-mixing. 
Basically, the LO signal, which in most cases is orders of 
magnitude larger than the RF signal, leaks to the RF port of 
the mixer and it will be mixed down to baseband. If the LO 
leaking signal is phase shifted with respect to the real LO, 
this almost always being the case in practice, the DC offset 
caused by self-mixing may dominate the mixer output. 
 
Finally, although direct conversion architecture has 
relaxed image rejection specifications, it has to fight with DC 
offset, 1/f noise and self-mixing.  
Hence, the low-IF architectures (see Fig. 6) become 
attractive. Essentially, the RF signal will now be 
downconverted to a low IF frequency (i. e., up to a few 
hundred kHz) and thus, the issues of direct conversion 
receivers are alleviated. 
But, the image rejection requirements are again tight. 
This stresses the implementation of the active poly-phase 
filter that follows the mixer and is used for image rejection 
and channel selection.

B. SDRR Architecture Choice: Heterodyne vs. Homodyne 
The main features of a SDRR must be a versatile 
architecture and the ability to be reconfigured on-the-fly as 
the communication burst requires.  
From the perspective of SoCs, the optimization of the 
chip power dissipation and die area is mandatory. As the 
SDRR will be a part of a SoC, this trade-off must be the 
main guideline in sizing the SDRR design, as well as in 
choosing its architecture, as a first and, very important, 
starting point. 
 
From area perspective the cumbersome image rejection 
filters of superheterodyne topology are not so attractive for 
monolithic integration. 
On the other hand, for direct conversion architecture the 
image rejection requirements are much smaller than for any 
other receiver architecture. 
Furthermore, the IF selection for superheterodyne 
architectures 
is 
fairly 
cumbersome 
and 
cannot 
be 
extrapolated in a systematic way to all standards, as it would 
be required for a true SDRR, [11]. 
The IF should be chosen to avoid the in-band down-
conversion of strong interferers. In most applications the 
nearest strong interferers is located three channels apart from 
the RF carrier, [12]. As the channel bandwidth differs even 
within the same wireless standard, it is not possible to select 
intermediate frequencies which will lead to reuse of same 
image filters for a multi-standard environment compatible 
receiver. 
Similarly, it is difficult to design an accurate wide-band 
90° phase shift block for the image rejection receiver of 
Fig. 4.a, as imposed by a multi-standard application. Also, 
the fact the Weaver receiver from Fig. 4.b requires a cascade 
of two complex mixers increases the overall receiver area 
and power consumption, while it is also constraining its 
image rejection capabilities. 
 
From power consumption perspective the homodyne 
topology has even more advantages. First of all, the 
baseband signal processing takes place at the lowest possible 
frequency. Secondly, this topology is not tributary to the 
3 dB noise penalty of superheterodyne architectures, [11]. 
 
Hence, 
the 
SDRR 
architectures 
of 
choice 
are 
superheterodyne, homodyne or low-IF. 
Table II summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of 
the three architectures with respect to monolithic integration 
in a SDR SoC. 
Given the overview presented in Table II, it becomes 
clear the direct conversion receivers represent the optimal 
choice for satisfying the requirements of a true SDRR.  
This has been validated through several circuit 
implementations in CMOS processes, [1, 13-15]. 
As noted, zero-IF receivers are susceptible to multiple 
issues (e. g., DC offset, 1/f noise, the self-mixing process), 
which make their monolithic integration quite a challenging 
task. All these aspects will be discussed in the following sub-
section.

C. Making the Homodyne Architecture Ready for 
Monolithical Integration 
As detailed in the previous sub-section and in-depth 
analyzed in [16], due to intrinsic operation of homodyne 
systems, they exhibit a large sensitivity to DC offset, either 
static or dynamic, and 1/f noise. Also, self-mixing issues can 
dramatically reduce performance of receivers implemented 
with direct conversion architectures. 
 
First of all, homodyne architecture is extremely sensitive 
to static DC offsets and 1/f noise. As for some wireless 
standards a large part of the signal energy is found at low 
frequencies (e. g., GSM), the down-converter mixer output is 
DC coupled to the anti-alias LPF. Thus, the receiver output 
risks of being overloaded even for small values of the DC 
offset, in the order of a few hundreds μV given the large 
VGA gain, usually larger than 60 dB, [17]. Regular AC 
coupling will not solve the issue, as receiver settling will be 
severely affected by a low cut−off frequency in the order of a 
few hundred Hz. 
Hence, the receiver must embed an offset calibration 
loop. 
One possibility is to use the correlated double sampling 
offset compensation technique, [18]. This is preferred to 
chopper stabilization, [19], as there is no risk of spurs 
overwhelming the receiver output spectrum. The receiver 
block schematic embedding offset calibration is shown in 
Fig. 7, redrawn from [16]. 
In the first phase (i. e., Offset_meas control signal is 
“High” – switches closed) the baseband chain DC offset is 
sampled on a capacitor, via the additional transimpedance 
amplifier, while the antenna input is shorted to ground, [10]. 
During normal operation, the second phase (i. e., 
Offset_meas is “Low” – switches open), the RF input is 
connected back to the antenna and the signal flows through 
the receiver, while the DC offset is inherently cancelled out. 
The static DC offset compensation loop will also reduce 
the 1/f noise level. 
The Fig. 7 receiver embeds multiple LNAs to mitigate 
the multi-standard frequency plan requirements from Table I.

The second major issue of the homodyne receiver 
architecture is the signal dependent DC offset generation due 
to even order distortions. the received input power can 
change dynamically, since other transmitters may start to 
communicate, a dynamic offset component is generated due 
to the receiver second order non-linearity. Therefore, 
dynamic offset compensation, to the extent required by 
almost all commercial wireless standards, implies the usage 
of a differential architecture for the whole receiver chain, 
starting with its LNA. 
 
Thirdly, the self mixing process, determined by the LO 
mixing with the LO signal leaking the VCO to the receiver 
input, can generate a large DC offset overloading the 
receiver output. Hence, the VCO must not oscillate at the 
same frequency with the RF carrier frequency. Hence, the 
quadrature LO signals driving the downconverter mixer must 
be obtained by dividing down the VCO frequency in the LO 
divider block from Fig. 7 (e. g., [20]). Moreover, very good 
isolation between RF and LO mixer ports is required for 
good receiver performance. 
III. 
DEFINING THE SDR SENSITIVITY, NOISE FIGURE AND 
GAIN REQUIREMENTS 
A. Introducing the Minimum Signal-to-Noise Ratio 
Required for Proper Signal Demodulation, SNR0 
The front-end must be able to downconvert the useful 
signal without hampering its electrical properties, such as the 
baseband processor is able to demodulate the information 
within a specified Bit Error Rate (BER). Basically there is a 
minimum SNR at the receiver output, SNRout, required for 
the digital demodulator to properly demodulate the useful 
signal. This minimum SNRout value is further on denoted as 
SNR0. 
As expected, higher SNRs are required to demodulate the 
signal within the same BER as the modulation number of 
bits per symbol increases. 
Increasing the SNR requirements is achieved at the cost 
of higher power consumption, by increasing the signal 
power, or at the cost of lowering the bandwidth. In any case, 
there is a trade-off between power consumption and BitRate 
(BR). This can be mathematically expressed as follows:

where S, respectively N, is the receiver input signal, 
respectively noise, power, Eb is the energy per bit, N0 is the 
noise power density at the receiver input; in practice, 
N0 = kBT∙F – where F is the receiver noise factor. 
Given (2), the maximum bit-rate from can be written as,

As (4) shows, the minimum Eb only depends on N0 and 
on the coding scheme, through the BR/BW ratio. 
There are two extreme cases depending on the BR/BW 
ratio value. 
Firstly, if BR/BW is very low (i. e., a large BW is used for 
a small BR) the limit from (4) is: 

Eb  N0 ln2


This case is exploited by spread spectrum systems. 
Basically, the SNR0 has a negative value for UMTS and 
WLAN 802-11 standards, as it accounts the processing gain, 
[21]. 
Secondly, for large BR/BW (e. g., for 64QAM), the limit 
from (4) becomes:

As an example the SNR from (7) translates to 18 dB 
SNR0 for 64QAM. Of course, this theoretical limit translates 
to a few dB higher value in practical implementation. 
Based on the analysis presented in [22], the SNR0 as a 
function of the BER has been determined for the basic 
modulation schemes. Table I notes the targeted standards 
signal modulation and the corresponding SNR0 values. 
The usage of the concept “SNR0” facilitates the finding of 
the multi-standard receiver key electrical parameters by 
enabling a standard independent approach. 
B. Sensitivity and Noise Figure 
One of the most important parameters of a wireless 
receiver is its sensitivity, SRX. The sensitivity is defined as 
the minimum input signal the receiver must be able to 
demodulate within the specified BER. 
Thus, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio at the RX output, SNRout, 
has to be above SNR0. As each standard specifies a 
sensitivity level, given the useful signal RF bandwidth, 
BWRF, the receiver NF, NFRX, is calculated as:

In practice, an overhead to SNR0 should be considered in 
(8), since the overall receiver SNR is degraded by multiple 
factors, not only by noise (e. g., imperfect impedance 
matching, multipath channel). 
The receiver NF specifications for all the wireless 
standards can be calculated with (8) by accounting the 
specified sensitivity levels from Table I. 
A NF as the one derived by (8) can be obtained at the 
expense of larger power consumption of thy receiver. 
 
In order to maximize the link budget, most commercially 
available dedicated receivers push their sensitivity level 
towards smaller and smaller values by decreasing NFRX. 
Hence, a true re-configurable multi-standard solution 
must embed a receiver with a small NF (typically < 3 dB) in 
order to be able to achieve a low enough sensitivity for all 
the targeted standards. Table I also comprises the required 
sensitivity levels, assuming NFRX = 3 dB, for all the 
envisaged wireless standards. 
C. Maximum gain requirements 
In general, the receiver signal conditioning path gain is 
constraint by the received signal strength. 
Any wireless receiver with an analog signal conditioning 
path embeds at least one variable gain block. 
Thus, for each communication burst an Automated Gain 
Control loop (AGC) measures the Receiver Signal Strength 
Indicator (RSSI) and changes the receiver gain accordingly, 
in order to avoid the ADC overloading and to optimally load 
it. 
The receiver maximum gain requirements are constraint 
by the ADC full scale level, FSADC, and the specified 
receiver sensitivity. 
In order to optimally load the ADC, the receiver signal 
conditioning path maximum gain, GRX, is given by: 


where k < 1 accounts the head room taken to avoid the ADC 
overloading.

For a multi-standard receiver embedding analog signal 
conditioning (see Fig. 1.c), k is set by the Variable Gain 
Amplifier (VGA) gain step (e. g., 6 dB, [14]). Equation (9) 
assumes all interferes and blockers have been totally filtered 
out before the ADC. This corresponds to the case of 
complete analog channel selection. 
Table III presents the receiver signal conditioning path 
maximum gain requirement for all the envisaged standards 
calculated based on equation (9) for a 1 V FS ADC and for a 
receiver matched to 100 Ω with k = 0.9; the NFRX of the 
receiver was assumed to be 3 dB. For direct sequence spread 
spectrum systems (e. g., WLAN 802.11b) the gain 
requirement is smaller, as in practice other signals will be 
present as well inside the received bandwidth. 
Nonetheless, we can conclude, based on Table II data, 
that the low sensitivity levels of the targeted wireless 
standards require a large maximum gain for the multi-
standard receiver. 
IV. 
BLOCKERS AND INTERFERERS IMPACT ON THE 
MULTI-STANDARD RECEIVER CHARACTERISTICS 
Besides the useful signal, other interferers and blockers 
can be present at the antenna input. The list comprising all 
interferes and blockers under which influence the receiver 
must still be able to properly demodulate the wanted signal 
represents the receiver blocker diagram. For each wireless 
standard such a receiver blocker diagram is specified. 
Based on the envisaged wireless standards blocker 
diagram analysis, in [12] a receiver generic blockers diagram 
has been constructed. This newly introduced tool enables the 
designer to handle efficiently the large amount of 
information comprised in the targeted radio standards. 
Thus, based on the receiver generic blockers diagram 
analysis it results immediately there are two major issues due 
to blockers and interferes: 
 
the receiver output clipping, due to the large receiver 
gain requirements and to the large difference between the 
useful signal and the blocker levels (i. e., typically > 
+40 dBc); 
 
intermodulation distortions that fall in-band, due to the 
receiver not perfectly linear transfer characteristic. 
The receiver output clipping can be handled (i) by 
making the LNA and VGA blocks gain variable and (ii) by 
allowing the receiver high frequency part noise and linearity 
performance to adjust with the RF front-end gain. This has 
analysed in-depth in [23]. 
On the other hand intermodulation distortions are un-
wanted products that potentially fall in-band and cannot be 
disseminated from the useful signal. Thus the wanted signal 
demodulation is affected due to the SNR degradation. 
Further on the analysis presented in this Section focuses on 
finding the values for the Figures of Merit (FOMs) used in 
evaluating the radio receiver linearity performance: the IIP2 
and IIP3. 
A. Finding the SDR IIP2 
While receiving the RF input power may change 
significantly because of the reception of unwanted 
blockers/interferers. Due to the receiver even order

distortions, the received signal DC offset component will 
change. This dynamic offset effect upsets the received signal 
demodulation, especially if the envisaged modulation 
concentrates a large part of the symbol spectral power at low 
frequencies. This is the case for older standards like GSM, as 
the latest wireless standards use modulation schemes that do 
not carry information at low frequencies. 
The figure of merit quantizing the analog front-end 
second order distortions is the second order intercept point, 
IP2. The SDRR input referred IP2, IIP2RX, is given by, [10]:

where Pblocker is the blocker level and Pin is the wanted signal 
level. 
Based on the targeted standards analysis, it results the 
worst case scenario is met for the GSM standard that requires 
IIP2RX = +46 dBm, [2]. 
B. Finding the SDR IIP3 
For most wireless receivers, given the fully differential 
circuit implementation, the dominant non-linear contribution 
comes from the third order coefficient of power series 
expansion of their transfer characteristic. The maximum in-
band level of the third-order intermodulation product, PIM3, 
must be smaller than the useful RF signal level with SNR0:

In practice, a supplementary head room to SNR0 should

multiple factors, not only by the down-converted spurs.

where Pinterferer is the power per interferer of two interferers

A special case is represented by OFDM Signals. An 
OFDM signal comprises frequency orthogonal sub-carriers, 
[19]. Receiver non-linearity leads to formation of bogus 
signals in-band due to sub-carrier intermodulation. The 
figure of merit in evaluating the third order intermodulation 
products thus formed is the Composite Triple Beat (CTB). 
As is pointed out in [24] the worst case for the CTB 
products level is found in the centre band of the OFDM 
signal spectrum:

Hence, in order for the digital back-end to be able to still

Each wireless standard specifies a set of particular 
intermodulation conditions. Table IV summarises the power 
per interferer of two interferers that cause the in-band 
distortion and the input signal power. By analysing all the 
targeted standards, the receiver IIP3 specifications were 
derived using (12) or (15) and noted in Table IV. The large 
variations in the IIP3 requirements are a reflection of the 
extreme reception conditions specific to the wireless 
environment. In [23] it is shown a versatile receiver is able 
to mitigate all presented scenarios, by adjusted dynamically 
its linearity and noise performance with the received power.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper conducted an analysis for finding the optimal 
architecture for a SDRR embedding analog signal 
conditioning and targeting compatibility with the major 
commercial wireless standards (see Table I).

Based on the analysis of the key receiver architectures, 
the homodyne receiver is found to suit best a monolithic 
implementation of a SDRR. By enhancing the classical 
homodyne architecture through the inclusion of an offset 
cancelation loop and quadrature LO generators the SDRR 
monolithic integration is made possible. The presented 
solutions are realized without introducing particular analog 
tricks to satisfy the needs of only one of the standards, as the 
SDRR must represent “universal receivers”, and not be 
turned into “multi-standard ASICs”. 
Further on, the minimum SNR at the receiver output, 
SNR0, required for a proper signal demodulation was 
calculated for all the envisaged standards. The usage of the 
concept “SNR0” facilitates the finding of the multi-standard 
receiver key electrical parameters by enabling a standard 
independent approach. 
Thanks to the standard independent systematic approach 
the presented analysis found the values for the key SDRR 
electrical specifications (i. e., NFRX, IIP2RX and IIP3RX) that 
ensure its compatibility with the envisaged standards. 
Of course, a true SDRR has to be versatile and robust, 
such as it can adjust dynamically its performance (e. g., 
NFRX, IIP3RX) depending on the communication burst 
particularities. Nonetheless if a SDRR targets compatibility 
with the standards from Table I, it must meet the electrical 
specifications determined in this analysis.  
So, the presented analysis constitutes the starting point in 
building the SDRR. Further on, the SDRR electrical 
specifications must be partitioned over its building blocks. 
The optimal specification partitioning must account the 
limitations due to the physical implementation (i. e., CMOS 
process) for each of the SDRR building blocks.
