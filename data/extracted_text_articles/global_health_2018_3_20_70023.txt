Abstract—Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most common
Organophosphorus
Pesticides
(OP)
used
worldwide.
The
toxicity of CPF results from the phosphorylation of the
acetylcholinesterase enzyme at nerve endings leading to a
cholinergic poisoning in both central and peripheral nervous
system. Neurobehavioral alterations, such as cognitive deficits
and locomotor impairment, have been extensively reported in
studies following an acute exposure to CPF, but to less extent
following a chronic exposure. The aim of this study is to
examine the effects of chronic dietary exposure to CPF for 6
weeks on the spontaneous motor activity and the physiological
parameters of two skeletal muscles, soleus and extensor
digitorum longus (edl), involved in motor activities in young
rats. Young rats were fed diets containing 1 mg/kg/day CPF
(CPF1) or 5 mg/kg/day CPF (CPF5) for six weeks. Behavioral
testing to assess the locomotor activity has been performed on
weekly basis. The fibers from soleus and edl muscles were
dissected and used to study contractile properties. Our results
showed
that
animals
treated
with
CPF
suffered
from
hypolocomotion dose independent, which have been clearly
manifested as an increase in latency time as well as the number
of errors assessed by the beam walking test and a significant
decrease in the beam balance time. CPF5 exposure showed an
increase in twitch tension comparing to control groups for both
soleus and edl. However, CPF1 exposure induces a decrease in
twitch contraction in edl muscle. Repeated low level exposure
to CPF1 and CPF5 impaired the fatigability index of soleus but
not edl muscle. Those dose independent decrements reported in
the behavioral tests came along a significant effect on the
muscle’s contractile parameters. Thus, the greater level of
contraction in both soleus and edl muscles studied in vitro
might be linked to the alterations shown in the locomotor
activity of rats.

INTRODUCTION
Even though lots of governmental regulations are being
engaged to limit the market growth of chlorpyrifos (CPF)
over the next seven years (up to 2022), it remains one of the
most common Organophosphorus Pesticides (OP) used
worldwide [1]. Its toxicity results primarily from the
inhibition of the AcetylCholinesterase Enzyme (AChE) at
nerve endings that will lead to the accumulation of the
acetylcholine
(Ach)
in
the
synaptic
cleft.
This
will
overstimulate the effector organ, such as neurons in the
Central Nervous System (CNS) and the skeletal muscle cells
and will lead to cholinergic poisoning [2]. Neurobehavioral
alterations,
such
as
cognitive
deficits
and
locomotor
impairment, have been extensively reported in previous
studies following an acute exposure to CPF via two main
routes subcutaneous [3] [4] or intragastric administration
[5], but to less extent following a chronic exposure via one
of the main route “the ingestion of contaminated food”. The
aim of this study is to investigate whether the repeated
exposure of young rats for six weeks to low doses CPF will
affect 1) the spontaneous motor activity assessed by the
beam walking test and prehensile traction test and 2) the
physiological parameters of two skeletal muscles involved
in the motor activities: the soleus, a slow-oxidative muscle
and the edl (extensor digitorum longus), a fast-glycolytic
muscle. The paper proceeds as follows: Section II describes
the experimental design, data are analyzed in Section III,
and, finally, Section IV presents the discussion and draws
the conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.
Experimental protocol
30 adults male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old,
average body weight 200 g) were housed in a plastic cage
and maintained on a 12L:12D cycle and temperature
maintained at 23°C. They were randomly divided into three
groups of 10 each: control, CPF1 and CPF5. Rats in CPF1
and CPF5 treated groups were fed a diet containing the CPF
at 1 mg/kg/day and 5mg/kg/day respectively for 6 weeks.
The control group was given only the standard pellet diet
with the vehicle (corn oil).
B.
Behavioral experiments
The locomotor activity was assessed on a weekly basis
during the treatment period. In the beam walking test, the rat
had to cross the beam readily in order to reach a box placed
at the other end. Traversing latency and number of hind-
limb slips were measured. In the prehensile traction test, rats
were assessed for their ability to grasp with their forepaws a
horizontal rod, for a one minute. Latency from when the
animal mounted the rod to when it fell from it was
measured.
C.
Measurement of muscle contractility parameters
After 6 weeks of exposure to CPF, the rats were
sacrificed. Soleus and edl were removed and the preparation
was mounted as described by Joumaa and Leoty [6]. The
preparation was stimulated by square electrical pulses at 0.1
Hz. After equilibration, single twitches were elicited. For
each twitch the peak twitch tension was determined. The
fatigue resistance was evaluated using a protocol consisting
of a 2 Hz train of supramaximal stimuli for a 5 min period.
The fatigue index was calculated as the percentage of initial
force remaining after 5 min of muscle stimulation.
III.
RESULTS
A.
Behavior measurements
Our results show that at weeks 5 and 6, there was a
significant increase in time to cross the beam in both CPF1
and CPF5 compared to control group (Fig. 1).

mean ± SEM. *: p ˂ 0.05 for CPF1 vs control at week 05 and 06 and CPF5 
vs control at week 05. **: p ˂ 0.01 for CPF5 vs control at week 06.   
Also, in the hind limb slips test, there was a significant
increase in the mean number of errors in both CPF1 and
CPF5 groups compared to control group. Regarding the
prehensile traction test, there was a significant decrease in
latency time from when the animal grasped the horizontal
rod with its forepaws to when it fell from it between treated
groups (CPF1, CPF5) and control group at weeks 5 and 6
(Fig. 2). No significant difference was observed between
CPF1 and CPF5 groups at weeks 5 and 6.

B.
Contractility parameters
For the edl muscle, our data showed a significant
decrease in twitch of contraction (Pt) in CPF1 rats compared
to control rats. However, a significant increase in twitch of
contraction was observed in rats exposed to CPF5 (Table I).
In
Soleus
muscle,
twitch
of
contraction
significantly
increase in both CPF1 and CPF5 rats compared to control
rats (Table I). Repeated low level exposure to both CPF1
and CPF5 significantly increases the fatigability index of
soleus but not edl muscle.

following beam walking test, which have been clearly
manifested as an increase in latency time, as well as the
number of errors through walking the horizontal rod.
Impairment in the motor function was also recorded
following the prehensile test showing a significant decrease
in the time spent and the ability for hanging on the rope
compared to the control group. This alteration in locomotors
activity can be referred either to an effect on CNS or
peripheral
skeletal
muscles.
In
our
study,
the
dose
independent decrements reported in the behavioral tests of
treated rats came along a significant effect on the soleus and
edl muscle’s amplitude of contraction and fatigability. The
greater level of contraction and the decrease in fatigue
resistance in vitro for soleus muscle at the two different
doses might be linked to the alterations shown in the
locomotors activity of rats. Our present findings are
consistent with the documented effects of repeated low level
exposure to CPF on another slow oxidative skeletal muscle
which is the diaphragm [7]. The increase in twitch tension is
explained by the decrease of AchE activity in the studied
muscle [7]. In conclusion, the significant variations in motor
activity and contractile parameters suggest a possible effect
of CPF on skeletal muscle function by affecting the
expression of some of the main actors of contraction, such
as
Ryanodine
receptor
and
SERCA
pump
that
are
responsible
for
calcium
homeostasis.
This
study
demonstrates that exposure to CPF has an impact on the
vital physiological functions of vulnerable populations.
These
deleterious
effects
could
have
long-term
consequences in maintaining body homeostasis and human
health.
