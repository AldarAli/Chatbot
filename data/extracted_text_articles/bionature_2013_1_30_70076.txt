Abstract—Fatty acid status of the White Sea herring from 
Dvina, Kandalaksha and Onega Bays of the White Sea in 
autumn was investigated. The fatty acid profile of the herring 
groups from studied sites was characterized by high amount of 
monounsaturated fatty acids, among which 18:1(n-9) and 
16:1(n-7) dominated. The herring from Kandalaksha Bay had 
higher (р≤0.05) level of 18:1(n-9) fatty acid than the fish from 
Onega Bay, whereas the last one was characterized by low 
(р≤0.05) level of 16:1(n-7). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 
were the second largest group in the herrings, mainly because 
of (n-3) fatty acids. In the herring from Onega Bay, the level of 
22:6(n-3) was significantly (p≤0.05) higher than in other fishes. 
Besides that, this fishes were characterized by high level of (n-
3)/(n-6) PUFA, 18:3(n-3)/18:3(n-6) and 16:0/18:1(n-9) ratios. 
Detected lipid status reflects ecological and biochemical 
features of fish adaptation in relation to specific ecological 
factors of the inhabitation areas of the White Sea and choice of 
optimal and adequate survival strategy in sub-Arctic. The 
results of this work present information about some features of 
mechanisms of adaptations on the level of lipid spectra and the 
role of fatty acid constituents in ecological and biochemical 
adaptions of the White Sea herring.

 INTRODUCTION  
Lipids and fatty acids have important functions in cell 
metabolism and play a significant role in biochemical 
adaptations of organisms to changing environmental 
conditions (abiotic, biotic, anthropogenic factors) [1-4]. Fish 
lipids, mainly their fatty acids (FA), are the basic source of 
metabolic energy and structural elements for their growth, 
development, reproduction, and survival [1-3]. Especially, it 
concerns fishes that have high level of lipids in their bodies 
as herring, salmon, trout etc. [5-8]. Fatty acids are one of the 
most sensitive lipid components that take active part in 
compensatory mechanisms of adaptation of organisms in 
normal and in stress [1-2]. Quick change of lipid and fatty-
acid profile of fish tissues and organs contributes to optimal 
process of life activity and their adaptation, including 
thermal adaptation, to changing environment [3]. 
The population of the White Sea herring Clupea pallasii 
marisalbi Berg (Clupeiformes, Clupeidae) is one of the 
similar forms of Pacific herring and one of the main and the 
most commercial fish in the White Sea. The local groups of 
herring are subject to particular hydrological conditions in 
different bays of the sea [9]. The biochemical studies of the 
White Sea herring are not numerous. Biochemical 
adaptations to specific ecological conditions of the White 
Sea (specific temperature regime, high speed of currents, 
water exchange with the Barents Sea, small depths, low 
concentration 
of 
mineral 
substances 
and 
organic 
compounds, low level of salinity, relatively short vegetation 
period, etc.) cannot ignore changes in lipid status of the fish. 
Fatty acid status of the White Sea herring from different 
bays (Dvina, Kandalaksha and Onega bays) in autumn 
season was investigated. 
The results of this research will contribute to the current 
knowledge about the role and functions of lipids that take 
part in development and formation of biochemical 
adaptations of other fish species. They also present new 
information about the features of mechanisms of adaptations 
on the level of lipid status of the studied fish in the sub-
Arctic region.  
The presented paper consists of next sections: material 
and methods, results of fatty acid analysis of the White Sea 
herring from different Bays, discussion, conclusion and 
acknowledgement.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
The White Sea herring adults were collected in October, 
2010 in Dvina (64o57' 38o23'), Kandalaksha (67o02' 32o23') 
and Onega Bays (64o59' 36o37') of the White Sea at depth 
50, 25 and 38 meters and at temperature 6.5o, 2.9o and 
6.7oC, respectively, according the method described by [10]. 
In total 66 individual specimens (n) were analyzed. 
Flesh of the fish was homogenized in 10 volumes (10 ml 
each) of 96% ethyl alcohol mixed with 0.001% of the 
antioxidant. Sample homogenates were placed in glass vials 
and stored onboard the ship in a cold room until delivery to 
the laboratory. The material was then fixed in a solvent 
system of chloroform:methanol (2:1, volume/volume), and

total lipids (TL) were extracted following the method [11]. 
The residues recovered after lipid extraction of the flesh 
were dried over phosphoric anhydride until the samples had 
reached a constant weight. The residues were weighted to 
determine the approximate percentage of total lipids (T) on 
a dry-weight basis (1), where β – lipids extracted (g) and α – 
residue weight (g): 
 
Τ = β ∗ 100/(α  + β). 
(1) 
The fatty acids composition of the total lipids was 
analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. Fatty acid methyl 
esters (FAME) were identified with a “Chromatek-Crystall-
5000.1” (Russia) gas chromatograph with flame-ionization 
detector on a Zebron Capillary Gas Chromatographic 
Column (Phenomenex, USA). The isothermic column 
regime was used (2250C), temperature of detector – 2500C; 
temperature of evaporator – 2400C. For recording and 
integration “Chromatek-Analytik-5000.1” software (Russia) 
was applied. 
The research was carried out using the facilities of the 
Equipment Sharing Centre of the Institute of Biology, 
KarRC of RAS 
Data were tested for normal distribution. Differences 
between means of fatty acids of total lipids in herrings from 
studied areas of the sea were analyzed by analysis of 
variance ANOVA (p≤0.05).  
III. 
RESULTS 
The biochemical analysis showed that the herring from 
Kandalaksha Bay had higher level of TL (41.7% dw) 
compared to the herring from Dvinsky and Onega Bays 
(34.5%; 31.8% dw, respectively) (Table I). In Table 1, 
Values in the same row with the same superscripted letter 
are not significantly different (p˃0.05) among fishes from 
different areas of the Sea and values in the same row with 
the different superscripted letter are significantly different 
(p≤0.05) among fishes.

The fatty acid spectrum of total lipids of the White Sea 
herring from all investigated bays were performed by 
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (from 38.81 to 
42.06% of total FA), among which 18:1(n-9) and 16:1(n-7) 
FA dominated (within the limits 18.40 – 20.14% and 7.73 – 
11.45% of total FA, respectively) (Table 1). The herring 
from Kandalaksha Bay had higher (р≤0.05) level of 18:1(n-
9) FA than the fish from Onega Bay, whereas the last one 
was characterized by low (р≤0.05) level of 16:1(n-7) FA. It 
was determined that the amount of other MUFAs – 18:1(n-
7), 20:1(n-9), 22:1(n-11), 22:1(n-7), 24:1(n-9) – did not 
exceed 5.0 % of total FA but their levels were significantly 
different (р≤0.05) among fishes from different bays of the 
sea. 
It was shown that the level of saturated FA (SFA) was 
high. Among SFA – 16:0 and 14:0 FA dominated and 
ranged from 21.40 to 22.26% and from 8.80 to 12.40% of 
total FA, respectively in all investigated groups of herring. 
Low concentration of 18:0 FA (1.66 – 3.21% of total FA) 
was detected in relation to fish from all sea regions. 
Polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) amount was within the 
limits from 20.71 to 23.92% of total FA, mainly because of 
(n-3) polyenic FA (15.12 – 19.19% of total FA) in the 
White Sea herring from all investigated areas. Among (n-3) 
PUFA – 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) were dominated. The 
White Sea herring from Onega Bay was slightly 
distinguished by high level (р≤0.05) of these acids (mainly 
22:6(n-3)) 
and 
(n-3)/(n-6), 
18:3(n-3)/18:2(n-6) 
and 
16:0/18:1(n-9) ratios.   
Thus, high level of total MUFAs (р≥0.05) was typical 
for the White Sea herring from all the studied inhabitations 
of the White Sea. The variations of some FA: with high 
level 17:0, 17:1(n-7), 18:0, 18:2(n-7), 22:1(n-7), 24:1(n-9), 
22:6(n-3) and low level - 14:0, 16:1(n-7), 16:3(n-6), 18:1(n-
5), 18:2(n-6), - differed the herring from Onega bay from 
others. Besides that, this fishes were characterized by high 
level 
of 
(n-3)/(n-6)PUFA, 
18:3(n-3)/18:3(n-6) 
and 
16:0/18:1(n-9) ratios.  
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Fatty acid status of the White Sea herring from different 
bays of the White Sea (Dvina, Kandalaksha and Onega 
Bays) in autumn season was investigated. High level of 
MUFAs is one of the typical features of aquatic marine 
organisms in northern latitudes. MUFA were the dominant 
FA group in all the herring groups in studied sites of the 
White Sea. Among MUFA – 18:1(n-9) and 16:1(n-7) were 
the most abundant. It is known that some MUFAs are 
dietary derived and they are trophic biomarkers for marine 
organisms: 18:1(n-9) FA is the main biomarker of 
dinoflagellates and bacterial plankton while 16:1(n-7) FA is 
the 
biomarker 
of 
diatoms 
microalgae 
[12-16]. 
Dinoflagellates and diatoms microalgae make the main 
contribution to biomass of the White Sea phytoplankton 
[17]. In the end of October (time of material collection) the 
phytoplankton bloom period finishes. In water there are just 
mass species of flagellates and diatoms algae disappears 
[18]. This fact explains lower level of 16:1(n-7) FA in 
herring from Onega Bay in comparison with fish from other 
places of the White Sea.  
It was outlined that herrings of the studied bays had low 
level of 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11) FA (1.46 – 2.10 % and 
0.88 – 1.44 % of total FA, respectively) that are synthesized 
de novo only by planktivorous species Calanus spp. [15] 
[19]. Therefore, in this period these zooplankton species 
made up small amount of herring diet that was evidently 
reflected on FA spectrum of the White Sea herring. 
Respectively high level of SFA, the domination of 16:0 
and 14:0 FA, was connected not only with de novo synthesis 
but also with their accumulation related to feeding on phyto- 
and zooplankton, presence and availability of which differed 
in food web and food habits of herring from different areas 
of the White Sea. Low level of 14:0 as well as 16:1(n-7) FA, 
biomarkers of diatoms, in herrings from Onega Bay in 
comparison with herrings from other studied area might be 
connected with decrease of producing capacity of diatoms 
algae in this period. The 16:0/18:1(n-9) ratio was higher in 
herring from Onega Bay. It indicated higher degree of 
intensity of lipid metabolism [20]. 
Low level of PUFA, especially 22:6(n-3) FA among the 
White Sea herring in comparison with other arctic and 
subarctic fish species shows that these FA played secondary 
role in terms of biomembrane functioning in these 
conditions. The correlation between (n-3) and (n-6) PUFA 
plays a specific role in organism due to competitive 
relations in the process of their metabolism [21]. It is also 
shown that cold water pelagic fishes have higher (n-3) 
PUFA level that satisfy their need in essential fatty acids 
more than (n-6) and (n-9) PUFA [4] [22] [23]. The (n-3)/(n-
6) PUFA ratio was higher in herring from Onega Bay than 
among fish groups in other bays of the sea. The change of 
lipid unsaturation degree is one of the basic mechanisms of 
regulation of activity of membrane connected enzymes 
under environment fluctuations [1] [24].  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The difference in terms total lipids and fatty acids 
among the White Sea herring from the studied bays of the 
White Sea was presented. The results of the paper present 
information about some features of mechanisms of 
adaptions on the level of lipid spectra and the role of fatty 
acid constituents in ecological and biochemical adaptations 
of fishes under study. It showed various influence of the 
complex of ecological factors, in this research mainly biotic 
(trophic). The determined spectra of fatty acids among the 
White Sea herring from its different bays confirm that in the 
period of fattening the main source of their nutrition were 
the diatoms algae and dinoflagellates and the income of 
copepods was small. Such lipid status reflects ecological 
and biochemical features of fish adaptation in relation to 
specific hydrobiological and trophoecological factors of the 
inhabitation areas of the White Sea and choice of optimal 
and adequate survival strategy in future. Detailed analysis of

separate fatty acids, their ratios of herrings from different 
sites of the White Sea in respect to abiotic factors 
(temperature, depth, water currents) will be given in future. 
The results of this work will contribute to the current
