Abstract—Rapid discovery and access of geospatial resources
is critical for many application domains that require agile data
integration. In this context, cross-domain geospatial applica-
tions need immediate access to geospatial resources of interest
in order to rapidly integrate them in scalable, functional
Web applications. In this paper we explore new perspectives
to build pragmatic geospatial Web applications, drawing on
the ideas of recent initiatives like Linked Open Data and
Open Archives Initiative. By using and extending standards
and principles from these initiatives we are able to model
single and composite geoprocessing services as a collection of
heterogeneous Web resources. Such collections are built by
the principle aggregation by linking that enables to connect
and link multiple geospatial data and services across different
application domains.

I. INTRODUCTION
Geospatial data sets are increasingly becoming available
in open repositories. Not only as ofﬁcial, validated data sets
collected by authorities and experts that make them available
through catalogues in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI)
nodes, but also as on-line resources dispersed everywhere
produced by thousands of individuals. Nonexpert users are
taking the role of productors of geospatial data through
the massive use of social networks (Flickr, Twitter, etc.)
and location-based devices (mobile phones, digital cameras,
etc.), which leads to huge amounts of rich georeferenced
user-generated content in a great variety of sizes and for-
mats [2]. As some authors pointed out [3], SDI nodes
cannot ignore the millions of users providing up-to-date
data anywhere at any time, becoming a challenging task for
the next generation of geospatial applications to conciliate
the up-bottom approach in traditional SDI creation with the
bottom-up approach powered by users [4].
In the SDI context geoprocessing services are a power-
ful means for creating web-based applications, integrating
geospatial data from multiple sources [5] [6] [7]. In addition,
Brauner et al. [8] have recently reported a set of research
projects focused on designing and implementing geoprocess-
ing services, in order to draw a research agenda for future
developments in the realm of distributed geoprocessing
computing. According to these studies [3] [8], some issues
that should be addressed in the near future are:
• The need of integrating information from multiple
and heterogeneous sources to beneﬁt from the rich,
valuable, up-to-date user-generated content.
• The lack of ﬂexible mechanisms to create on-demand,
scalable service-oriented geospatial solutions that con-
tains relevant geospatial resources such as geoprocess-
ing services, geospatial data and user-generated content.
Our long-term research goal pursues new perspectives to
provide pragmatic, scalable approaches to creation of geo-
processing workﬂows that take into account user-generated
content out of SDI context. Here we focus on the facet
of description (leaving other facets like execution aside for
now) of geoprocessing services in such a way that let users
create collections of related geoprocessing services.
The proposed approach draws on the principles and best
practices exposed by Linked Open Data (LOD) [9] [10]. This
initiative stems from the very principles of Web architecture
and pursues the goal of “enabling people to share structured
data on the Web as easily as they can share currently
Web resources” [9]. The idea consists of publishing data
in a structured manner and creating typed links between
data resources from heterogeneous sources, assuming these
two tenets: (i) RDF (Resource Description Framework) data
model is used as common model to publish structured
data; and (ii) extensive use of typed links to connect data
from different data sources. Essentially, it is assumed that
the more interlinked data, the more aspects of meaning
(richness) might be represented.
Although accessing to data itself may be viewed as
a prior goal, users are already retrieving georeferenced
data either through SDI data download services or from
open repositories such as Flickr, Open Street Maps and
Twitter. The availability and stability of latter data sets
are fundamental and should be reinforced, though, the real
impediment is to provide better connections (interlinking)
among the vast amount of user-generated data, SDI content,
and geoprocessing services so that experts and nonexperts
alike may access to structured data and services for their
cross-domain geospatial applications. Furthermore, our aim
here is to apply the OAI-ORE (Open Archive Initiative -

Object Reuse and Exchange) protocol (see Section II-C),
which has been proven to be successful in digital library
projects, extending it with new types of relationships to the
geospatial landscape in order to support not only structured
data, as LOD states, but also interlinking other types of Web
resources like geoprocessing services.
This paper is an extended version of a conference paper
referenced in [1]. The rest of the paper is structured as
follows. In Section II we introduce the basic concepts used
throughout this paper focusing speciﬁcally on the OAI-
ORE’s abstract data model. The proposed approach to model
geoprocessing services and data as collections of interlinked
heterogeneous resources is described in Section III. Sec-
tion IV compares our work with related projects. Finally,
Section V concludes by summarizing the key features of
our approach and discussing ongoing work.
II. BACKGROUND
This section presents relevant concepts and deﬁnitions for
the remaining sections. In particular, the following subsec-
tions will shortly introduce the SDI and related geospatial
services, the LOD project, and the OAI-ORE speciﬁcation.
A. SDI and geoprocessing services
Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) describe the notion of
service-oriented management, accessing, and processing of
geospatial data. The implementation of SDI has traditionally
followed a service oriented architecture paradigm where web
services technology plays a enabling role in data integration
and promotion of interoperability among heterogeneous dis-
tributed information sources [11].
Geospatial web services allow users to access, manage,
and process geospatial data in a distributed manner [12]. The
demand for interoperability has boosted the development
of standards and tools to facilitate data transformation and
integration, mostly in terms of standard interfaces speciﬁed
by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC1) and Technical
Committee 211 (TC2112) of International Organization for
Standardization (ISO). The Web Map Service (WMS), the
Web Feature Service (WFS) and the Web Coverage Service
(WCS) are some prominent examples of OGC interfaces for
geospatial services. All come in different versions, where
WMS 1.3.0 [13], WFS 1.1.0 [14], and WCS 1.1.2 [15] are
the most recent. The central building-blocks for data, as well
as service discovery, are provided by the Catalogue Services
for the Web (CSW) [16] and so called geoportals [17]. The
CSW provides one access point to users that search for
geospatial data.
Geoprocessing services essentially transform geospatial
data to produce new data or meaningful information [18].
A substantial leap ahead in the domain of geoprocessing
1http://www.opengeospatial.org/
2http://www.isotc211.org/
services was the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) spec-
iﬁcation [19]. This speciﬁcation was designed to encapsulate
generic operations and algorithms over the Internet. The
basic operational unit of the OGC WPS is the notion of
process, that is, a geospatial operation with inputs and
outputs of a deﬁned type. This means that a given WPS
instance (a concrete WPS service running) may offer one
or various operations (or processes) as normal web services
do. The common communication pattern between a client
and a WPS instance encompasses three types of requests.
A request can be sent to the WPS instance via HTTP GET
with parameters provided as Key-Value Pairs (KVP) or via
HTTP POST, with parameters supplied in a XML document.
These three types of requests are:
• GetCapabilities. First, a WPS instance receives a KVP
getCapabilities request (which is common for all OGC
geospatial services) and simply responds with an XML
document, containing metadata such as server provider,
contact information, general description, and a list of
contained geoprocessing operations (processes) offered
by the queried WPS instance.
• DescribeProcess. A WPS-client selects a process iden-
tiﬁer from the getCapabilities response and performs
a describeProcess request, either as KVP or as XML
document. The WPS instance responds with an XML
document containing needed information for the so-
licited process, such as input and output parameter
names and types, so that the WPS-client may later build
the execute request.
• Execute. The WPS-client eventually requests the ex-
ecution of a geospatial operation, with all required
input data by invoking the execute method as an XML
document request. The WPS instance then runs the
operation and returns the results informing also of its
status.
As geospatial web solutions continue to grow and in-
crease in complexity, many standards organizations, industry
bodies, and the geospatial research community have paid
attention to the effective composition and orchestration of
geospatial web services [20]. Rather than describing a new
service interface for geoprocessing services, our aim here
is to propose a new way to improve service compositions
in terms of collections or aggregations of geoprocessing
services in line with the principles of the Linked Data
community.
B. Linked Open Data
Linked Open Data (LOD) represents a style of information
publishing on the Web. This style relies on traditional web
technologies and the usage of light-weight techniques for
data model representation. The former resides on the use
of Uniform Resource Identiﬁers (URI) as reference points.
A URI is used to uniquely identify a resource, i.e., a
piece of data, and also for actual access to the resource
201
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 3 no 3 & 4, year 2010, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

representation. This implies that HTTP URI should be
deferenciable URI, that is, user can look up these URIs to
retrieve resource representations. Content negotiation comes
here to allow clients to specify an acceptable representation
of a data set [21]. While connecting to a data source, the
client may specify the desired representation. This may be,
for instance, plain RDF, or an HTML representation with
increased readability for the human user.
The former refers to the Resource Description Framework
(RDF) as basic structure for any form of description. RDF
provides means to describe any kind of resource in form of
triples (subject-predicate-object). In this way, data published
according to LOD principles is exposed in RDF format
and interlinked by exploting the intrinsic capabilities of the
RDF model to link resources. As we will see in the next
section, OAI-ORE and LOD share some characteristics what
make OAI-ORE a suitable candidate to model collections of
geoprocessing services with the beneﬁts of the LOD project.
C. OAI-ORE’s abstract data model
The Open Archive Initiative - Object Reuse and Exchange
(OAI-ORE) protocol [22] deﬁnes an abstract data model [23]
for describing, reusing, and exchanging collections of Web
resources. The aim of this protocol is to expose rich content
(text, images, data, video, etc.) in aggregations to be then
fed by applications in the realm of digital library domain.
Obviously, OAI-ORE is closely related with the OAI -
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) [24], since
for instance source content (e.g., e-prints records) described
in OAI-ORE can be harvested automatically in order to
replicate it in others remote repositories [25].
Conceptually, the OAI-ORE’s abstract data model builds
strongly on the principles deﬁned on LOD. First, the notion
of “addressable resources” indicates that resources of any
type (ﬁle, image, text document, metadata, process, etc.)
should be identiﬁed using HTTP URI. Secondly, exploiting
the simple mechanism of “typed links” to connect resources
enables the discovery, browsing, and access to more related
and connected data.
In principle, the use of the capabilities of OAI-ORE and
LOD to build scalable, distributed Web applications that in-
tegrate heterogeneous remote sources becomes evident [26];
LOD takes the principles of the current Web architecture, the
most, by far, scalable and distributed information system. As
the OAI-ORE’s abstract data model relies on such principles,
we ﬁnd a rational argument to use it to link collections
of Web resources, considering a geoprocessing service as
a particular type of Web resource.
Before discussing how the OAI-ORE’s abstract data
model can be used for describing and linking geoprocessing
services (see Section III), we introduce here its key enti-
ties [23]. The simpliﬁed diagram in Figure 1 shows how
these entities are related each other. The entity Aggregation
Figure 1.
Simpliﬁed OAI-ORE’s abstract data model
plays a central role as it represents a collection of address-
able resources that in turn are called Aggregated Resources
(AR). The ore:aggregates relation denotes here the “aggre-
gation by linking” mechanism to connect resources related
in some way. This implies that both Aggregations and AR
entities are addressable resources in the sense that both use
HTTP URI as referencing method. Here comes the process
of dereferencing URI, another key aspect in LOD, which
just means looking up a URI on the Web in order to get
either the resource itself or its representation.
Aggregation and AR are abstract terms that must still
refer to concrete resources, which can be of any type
such as a document, image, process, service, and even
a chain of geoprocessing services as we will see in the
following section. The OAI-ORE speciﬁcation makes use
of the Resource Map entity to provide a concrete repre-
sentation for the whole aggregation, mostly derived from
RDF. Some suggested formats in the speciﬁcation are the
Atom syndication format [27], RDF/XML3, and RDFa4 (a
microformat for extending XHTML to support RDF). We
use the RDF/XML serialization so that resulting collections
can be readily added and connected to other LOD datasets
since RDF triples are the common data model.
OAI-ORE deﬁnes a useful abstract entity called Proxy (P)
by which it is possible to express the role an aggregated re-
source has explicitly in the context of an aggregation. For ex-
ample, two resources may have a temporal relationship that
connects to each other and this is only meaningful within
the aggregation context in which they are deﬁned. The use
of relationships from and to Proxy elements instead of the
Aggregated Resource elements they represent does not affect
the original resource. In addtion, the use of Proxy elements

does not make private information explicit (e.g., temporal
and semantic relationships) to external aggregations because
either this knowledge is not required or is meaningless to
them. The Proxy entity thus enables encapsulation, a major
driving force to support reusability [28].
Besides the Proxy entity, OAI-ORE protocol permits the
use of relationships to link directly to resources and aggre-
gations. These relationships can be either internal, between
the resources deﬁned within the aggregation, or external,
linking to external resources such as georeferenced user-
generated content. In both cases, speciﬁc relationships such
as ore:aggregates and ore:describes are deﬁned. An example
of external relationship is ore:similarTo. However, following
the “typed link” principle of LOD, those resources deﬁned
in a given OAI-ORE aggregation may, indeed should, link
to and be linked from other external resources based on re-
lationships characterized semantically by other vocabularies.
Aside from linking related resources, the “aggregation
by linking” mechanism makes it ease to create complex
hierarchical aggregations from simpler ones. This implies
that collections of resources can be scaled and reused easily,
since incorporating or eliminating a resource from a given
collection simply means to refer or not to its HTTP URI.
Next section focuses on how geoprocessing services can
be seen as resources and described using the OAI-ORE’s
abstract data model.
III. APPROACH
This section ﬁrst proposes the conceptual architecture
that supports our approach and lists some assumptions that
drive our research at the present stage. Then a set of new
relationships to model geoprocessing services inside an OAI-
ORE colection is presented as an extension on this protocol.
Finally we describe how to use the OAI-ORE and the
new extension to model geoprocessing service and their
composition.
A. Architecture
SDI-based applications are built upon a multilayer ar-
chitecture as depicted in the right side of Figure 2 (blue
boxes). Application layer may contain thin client tools such
as geoportals, mashups and rich internet applications (e.g.,
Flex, JavaFX), and also thick desktop-based clients. The
middleware layer comprises multiple distributed services,
which allow client applications to discover, access, and pro-
cess geospatial data and metadata from remote repositories
(Data layer). SDI applications work in this way because SDI
nodes are normally architectured in such a way5.
To provide better connections with other type of data
out of SDI content, like user-generated content and LOD
datasets (blue clouds and gray circles in Figure 2), we have
added a Transformation process to convert heterogeneous
5http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reports/ImplementingRules/network/D3

Proposed architecture
source resources into RDF/XML format. The source re-
sources may be geospatial data sets in SDI repositories, geo-
referenced documents, pictures or tweets (Twitter messages),
as well as geoprocessing services to compute calculations
over such datasets. The black arrows in Figure 2 shows the
two-step transformation process: ﬁrst resource collections
are generated based on the OAI-ORE data model to be
then serialized as RDF/XML documents. Besides resulting
collections may be readily connected to resources in other
RDF-based LOD datasets6 across several communities and
domains [9].
The proposed architecture poses some requirements for
interlinking geoprocessing resources: addressable resources
(data and services), connecting (linking) resources, and the
ability to see and link resource descriptions (metadata)
for each resource. In the following we enumerate some
assumptions taken in this paper for describing collections
of interlinked Web resources:
• Geospatial datasets and services are addresable re-
sources, i.e., have referenciable HTTP URI [9] [10]
[26].
• A geoprocessing service is considered a type of Web
resource, which let us rely on the OAI-ORE protocol
to model interlinking geoprocessing services.
• Since a geoprocesing service is a resource, a chain
of geoprocessing services may be then comparable
to a collection of heterogeneous Web resources. A
collection thereby is a resource with own metadata.
B. Extending the OAI-ORE abstract data model
A geoprocessing service can be characterized by its sig-
nature: a function or capability, and a set of input and output
parameters. Taking this simple approach, the mapping to the
OAI-ORE’s abstract data model is driven by the following
6http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/
203
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 3 no 3 & 4, year 2010, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

rules: (i) a geoprocessing service is an Aggregation entity;
(ii) its components are Aggregated Resources, i.e., the
capability of the resource, and the collections of input and
output parameters; (iii) a Resource Map entity then describes
the Aggregation using a serialization format.
These assumptions describe a method for mapping geo-
processing service elements with the OAI-ORE data model,
however, the built-in relationships deﬁned by this speciﬁca-
tion are not enough to express the roles and relationships
for modelling aggregations of geoprocessing services. In
order to appropiately deﬁne these relationships, we have
extended the OAI-ORE abstract data model with a set of
new relationships (with preﬁx ores) that can be applied to
the already existing elements.
Table I brieﬂy shows these new relationships altogheter
with their name, URI, the inverse relationship in the case this
exists and their domain and range properties. Not only the
deﬁnition of these relationships but also the elements that
make use of them is an important aspect to consider. The
relationships among the different elements that describe a
geoprocessing service can only be meaningful in the context
of this description and they may not be useful or represen-
tative outside the geoprocessing service description for an
aggregated resource. In order to encapsulate this information
most of the new relationships deﬁned are applied to the
Proxy element. The Proxy actually becomes a key element
for describing the geoprocessing service representing and
containing the internal relationships that models it.
Geoprocessing services may receive an input to ge-
nerate
an
output
or
result.
This
behaviour
is
mod-
eled
in
our
approach
through
the
use
of
the
re-
lationships ores:aggregatesInput, ores:inputAggregatedBy,
ores:aggregatesOutput and ores:outputAggregatedBy. The
ﬁrst two relationships allow the speciﬁcation of the input
for a given service being each relationship the inverse for
the other. The last two ones do the proper in the task of
specifying the output for the service representing again an
inverse relationship among them. Since a service can have
zero or more inputs (and outputs), the cardinality of these
relationships can be speciﬁed as zero to any.
Similar behaviour occurs when deﬁning the inner pro-
cesses that compounds the geoprocessing service. This
components can also specify their inputs and outputs us-
ing the declared relationships ores:inputFor, ores:hasInput,
ores:outputFor, ores:hasOutput. A given process may have
zero or more inputs and zero or more outputs that can be
speciﬁed by using any number of relationships to link both,
the process and the inputs or outputs represented by their
corresponding Proxy element.
The different processes that compound the geoprocessing
service have to be described in a certain partial order. To
model this feature, the proposed extension of the OAI-
ORE data model deﬁnes the relationships ores:next and
ores:previous. These two new relationships can be applied

only to those Proxy elements that represent processes as
aggregated resources and indicate the next or the previous
processes that should be followed during the service execu-
tion. Thanks to these relationships it is possible not only to
specify an order for the inner processes but also navigate
among them and check for instance the requirements (i.e.,
output of a process that serves as input for another) in order
to start the execution of a process.

tions in others as aggregated resources of the latter indicating
the resource map or serialization of the former by the rela-
tionship ore:isDescribedBy that links both. The same may
happen when describing a geoprocessing service, however,
in this case the aggregations can have two different roles:
either describing a collection of aggregated resources or
describing a executable geoprocessing service. In the ﬁrst
case all of the aggregated resources could be used as input
for a given process. In the second case, through, it makes
sense that only the aggregated resources that represent the
output of its execution may be of interest instead of the
entire service description (collection).
This behaviour represents an ambiguity concerning the
role a nested aggregation plays in a service description.
To resolve it the relationship ores:hasOutput can be used
to specify in both cases those elements that can be reused
by other geoprocessing service descriptions when the ﬁrst
aggregation is used as one of its aggregated resources. The
use of ores:hasOutput makes it easy to reuse the output of
a geoprocessing service or a collection of other resources
and also allows to specify only a subset of the aggregated
resources in a collection or intermediate results in a geopro-
cessing service that may be of interest although they are not
the result for the service execution.
C. Modeling geoprocessing services as Web resources
Considering the OAI-ORE speciﬁcation and the previ-
ously explained extension based on it, let us consider now a
concrete geoprocessing service like a transformation service
that converts a source KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
ﬁle [29] into a GML (Geography Markup Language) for-
mat [30]. This service is called Kml2Gml and takes one
input parameter –a data resource–, and returns the corre-
sponding GML content as an addressable resource so that
can be retrieved by dereferencing its URI.
Figure 3 illustrates this simple scenario using a named
graph to represent the mappings between the Kml2Gml
service and the OAI-ORE’s abstract data model including
the relationships deﬁned in the extension for describing
geoprocessing services. From top to bottom, the Resource
Map entity named ReM-1 describes, through the relationship
ore:describes, the Aggregation entity A-1. The A-1 entity
is composed, through the relationship ore:aggregates, of
three Aggregated Resource entities, named AR-1, AR-2, and
AR-3 respectively. These AR entities map to counterpart
resources of the Gml2Kml service. In this particular case,
AR-2 represents the function, AR-1 the input resource,
and AR-3 the output resource. Their corresponding Proxy
elements are also represented in the graph by the elements
P-1, P-2 and P-3 respectevily and allow the deﬁnition of the
required relationships for the aggregated resources that are
meaningful only in the service description context. Table II
lists the set of URL for the resulting addressable resources,
both abstract (Aggregation, Aggregated Resource and Proxy

and services.
Figure 3 shows in grey tone all those relationships not de-
ﬁned by the presented extension. These relationships include
those externally deﬁned such as dcterms:creator, used by the
Resource Map and Aggregation entities to point to an author
(external) resource based on the Dublin Core vocabulary7.
As described previously, AR-1 and AR-3 entities represent
the needed input and output resources for the capability
resource AR-2. To capture these relationships between re-
sources in the OAI-ORE’s abstract data model, it is required
a couple of steps. First, we create a Proxy entity for each
AR entity (P1, P2, and P3 respectively). So a Proxy entity
is tied to the corresponding AR entity by two OAI-ORE
built-in relationships, namely ore:proxyFor and ore:proxyIn.
The former indicates that the Proxy entity is for a concrete

AR entity. The latter is informative and just keeps informed
the upper Aggregation A-1 about the active Proxy entities.
Second, semantic relationships among resources are possible
by means of relationships belonging to vocabularies, either
in the OAI-ORE domain itself or in others.
It is here where the extension plays its role modelling the
geoprocessing service through the use of the requiered rela-
tionships. For example ores:hasInput and ores:inputFor in-
dicate that AR-1 (input resource) serves as input to the AR-
2 (capability resource). Something similar happens for the
ores:hasOutput and ores:outputFor relationship but involving
the AR-2 and AR-3 entities to indicate the output for the for-
mer. The relationships ores:inputAggregatedBy and its invers
ores:aggregatesInput indicate that the entity AR-1 through its
Proxy entity P-1 serve as input for the aggregation A-1 that
models the entire service. In order to indicate the output of
the service the relationships ores:outputAggregatedBy and
ores:aggregatesOutput links both the Aggregation A-1 and
the Aggregated Resource AR-3 through its Proxy P-3.
Although OAI-ORE data model and the proposed exten-
sion deﬁne the required relationships to model geoprocessing
services as aggregations, other relationships and terms can
be used to enrich a description of a collection. These terms
and relationships can be created for a concrete purpose
or reused from common vocabularies in other ﬁelds. The
use of common vocabularies in the geoprocessing context
is a tricky question. Some authors claim the need of a
geoprocessing taxonomy [8], as a mechanims to provide a
common semantic background on which discovery, access,
and composition of geoprocessing services can be achieved.
In other words, for effective interoperability it is a must
to build and label similar resources in compatible ways.
Otherwise, the task of choosing, extending, and merging
vocabularies becomes a sensitive issue [31].
As a best practice, semantic terms should be reused from
well-known vocabularies wherever possible, avoiding the
deﬁnition of new terms if they already exist. As OAI-ORE
protocol supports the use of existing vocabularies, we have
followed this strategy by reusing relationships from well-
known vocabularies like RDF schemas8 (e.g., rdf:domain).
In this way, additional metadata for the whole collection
(e.g., use case, context, data provenance) may also be en-
coded as external resources using meaningful relationships.
Table III lists the most relevant relationships used in the
Km2Gml geoprocessing service scenario.
Another example of widely-used vocabulary with geo-
graphic connotations is the case of the vocabulary or ontol-
ogy offered by Geonames9. This vocabulary is expressed in
OWL [32] and offers a collection of over six million of place
names and other relevant terms to express relationships.
In addition, Geonames features are interlinked each other
by means of typed links denoting hierarchical inclusion
(e.g., continent, countries, administratives units, etc.) and
proximity. The Geonames vocabulary seems to be a feasible
choice to link geospatial resources (user-generated content,
SDI content, OAI-ORE aggregations), thus offering a simple
mechanism of georeferencing heterogeneous Web resources.
Therefore, the combination of Proxy entities and meaningful
relationships from (existing) vocabularies enables the deﬁni-
tion of ﬂexible and customized connections among disparate
resources of a given aggregation.
Finally the code in Figure 4 shows a portion of a possible
RDF/XML representation that describes a geoprocessing
service as represented in Figure 3 following the OAI-ORE
recommendations for serializing aggregations.
D. Interlinking geoprocessing services
The previous section described how OAI-ORE’s abstract
data model is used and extended to describe a geoprocessing
service. To illustrate our approach a simple geoprocessing
services was used as example of aggregation of resources.
Independently of its complexity any geoprocessing service
can be modeled following the same pattern: a capacity
resource, one or more input resources and one or more
output resources. This section sketches how a chain of geo-
processing services is modelled as a collection of interlinked
aggregated resources and how another collection can be
reused as input for a capacity resource.
Figure 5 shows a chain of two services represented in
OAI-ORE. In this case, the AR-2 and AR-4 entities represent
geoprocessing services. Returning to our simple scenario,
AR-2 refers to the Kml2Gml service while the AR-4 would
be a topology function like intersection that operates over
the results of AR-2 and a collection of geometries deﬁned
in AR-5. Again, the key aspect is the combination of Proxy
entities and suitable relationships that express properties

Figure 4.

description
over the AR entities, such as the order in which the services
should be organized and what resources acts as input and
output parameters.
As observed in Figure 5, the ores:next and ores:previous
relationships introduce the partial order among the resources
AR-2 and AR-4 of the collection. Also, the ores:hasInput,
Figure 5.
Interlinking geoprocessing services in OAI-ORE
ores:hasOutput and their inverse relationships connect prop-
erly all of the aggregated resources. Note that the Proxy en-
tity P-3 has two relations –ores:inputFor and ores:outputFor–
, but each one refers to disjoint Proxy entities (P-2 and P-4
respectively). This means that the entity P-3 plays a different
role depending on which target entity is connected to.
In this scenario the geoprocessing service referenced
by the resource AR-4 and its Proxy entity P-4 represents
an intersection function that accepts two inputs: a GML
geometry returned by the Kml2Gml service and a second
geometry deﬁned by the resource AR-5. The latter represents
in fact another collection as indicated by the relationship
ore:isDescribedBy that links the Aggregated Resource entity
with the Resource Map entity for serialization. As indicated
in previous sections, the taks of nesting and reusing ag-
gregations involves the use of OAI-ORE built-in relation-
ships along with the proposed ores:aggregatesOutput (and/or
its inverse relationship ores:outputAggregatedBy when re-
quired) for indicating those resources that can be reused in
other collections. By using these relationships all the geome-
tries required to perform the intersection function through

the capacity resource AR-4 are indicated conveniently in the
collection AR-5. Similarly the different outputs generated
by the execution of the interlinked geoprocessing services
in our example are anotated by using these relationships. It
is important to note that not only the ﬁnal result is indicated
(intersection function result) but also intermediate results
(Kml conversion to Gml).
Connecting to alternative resources is also possible
and even desirable. The P-2’s outcomming relationship
rdfs:seeAlso lets us connect to other functional-like services
for data transformation. In practice, therefore, composing
and reusing entire aggregations and aggregated resources by
“aggregation by linking” mechanism is possible and even
encouraged in the speciﬁcation of the OAI-ORE protocol
itself [22].
IV. RELATED WORK
Geospatial data have been traditionally disposed in collec-
tions. Raster data ﬁles covering the same area normally come
as sets of ﬁles that form a collection, and in consequence
metadata descriptions are also organized in nested collec-
tions [33] [34]. This imposes some degree of linkage since
data are grouped according to a certain geographic criterion
(proximity, overlay, etc.). The term collection here embraces
resources and metadata together, no longer stored separately.
Besides, as highlighted throughout this paper, we emphasize
tremendous heterogeneity with regard to resources [35],
say, geoprocessing services, multimedia resources, and raster
data may be part of the same collection.
Regarding geoprocessing services, several research works
deal directly with the OGC WPS speciﬁcation [5] [7] [36]. In
most cases, composing properly geospatial services remains
still unsatisfactory due to the complexity inherent in some
service speciﬁcation (eg. WFS interface). Other alterna-
tives to distributed geoprocessing computing are semantic-
based [37], grid-enabled [38], and REST extensions for
BPEL [39].
In the digital libraries domain, recent works have explored
the connections between OAI-PMH and LOD communi-
ties [40]. OAI-ORE related development has been constantly
increasing since its birth, not only at server but also at desk-
top level appearing different tools that allow users to create
their own collections or compound objets. This is the case
of LORE [41] a tool created for authoring and publishing
compound objects or collections based on the OAI-ORE
model for representing bibliographic relationships.
Recent works reveal an increasing interest in connecting
geospatial resources of any type [42]. In the SDI community,
Florczyk et al. (2010) are exploiting semantic linkages to
services in SDIs [43]. The authors propose a linked ontology
of administrative units for referencing the same geographic
concept to the corresponding instances form multiple WFS
services. Similar examples come from the Ordnance Survey,
with the publication of the Administrative Geography of
Great Britain, an initiative to publish administrative units
as linked data sources [44]. Shade and Cox (2010) have
recently pointed the similarities between LOD and SDI since
geospatial data encoded in GML permit simple mappings to
RDF [45]. Our approach built on the OAI-ORE data model
goes in this line to provide better support for metadata of
individual resources and entire collections. Each resource
and its metadata form a logical unit no longer separated,
which enables greatly the discovery, access, and linkage to
resources and collections.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper has presented an ongoing approach to concili-
ate geospatial services and data with external LOD datasets.
The use and extension of OAI-ORE protocol to model col-
lections of interlinked geoprocessing services allows users
to regroup and restructure the spectrum of data and services
over the Web, in order to build functional, cross-domain
Web applications. What is novel here is the straightforward,
direct method for describing and packaging resources and
collections, compared with the family of business process
languages (BPEL, etc.), which makes it easy to browse,
compose, access and visualize collections of interlinked
geospatial resources.
Applications consuming properly structured data are still
missing [26]. In this sense, our future research efforts are
centred on building suitable tools to support the creation
of OAI-ORE collections and their visualization over vir-
tual globe platforms. Other challenging tasks concern with
connecting current SDI catalogue services and applications
(geoportals, etc.) to LOD datasets in order to link the rela-
tively small SDI community to others much bigger, so that
geospatial researchers may tackle multidisciplinary projects
that expand the boundaries of geospatial information.
