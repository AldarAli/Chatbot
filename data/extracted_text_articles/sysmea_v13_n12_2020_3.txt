Abstract—In this study, we analyze the maintenance data 
provided by Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation; the data 
consists of recent Taipei metro system maintenance record.  
However, it is unclear whether the lifetime information of the 
system is contained within the partial-lifespan maintenance 
record of a still-young metro system.  Furthermore, the Taipei 
metro system is renowned for its performance and well 
maintenance, which further complicates the analysis.  Based on 
limited maintenance records, the research objective is to explore 
the feasibility of extracting reliable information that is 
indicative of the current stage of life and the remaining lifetime 
of the metro system.

 INTRODUCTION 
In line of the recent reported research study [1], we further 
analyze the maintenance record of the Taipei Mass Rapid 
Transit (MRT) system, which is a well-maintained system 
renown worldwide for its tidiness, stability and efficiency.  
The Taipei metro system of Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation 
(TRTC) began operation on March 28, 1996; it has been 
operating for 24 years.  Since the MRT TRTC is relatively 
young, most of the equipment has not yet been replaced; the 
records of repair and maintenance are detailed and are stored 
in digital form.  The goal of this research is to determine 
whether it is possible to acquire status information of the 
system from the limited time-span maintenance records.  Such 
information may be crucial for improving the performance of 
the Taipei MRT system.  More generally, this research may 
shed light on enhancing performance of other metropolitan 
MRT systems. 
Here we investigate the feasibility of extracting 
information from the Taipei MRT maintenance record and 
determine whether it is possible to acquire reliable 
information of the system performance from the limited time-
span maintenance records.  If the maintenance data indeed 
contains such information of the current system status, our 
goal is to assess the current stage of life of the Taipei MRT 
system and determine the remaining lifetime. 
The performance and degradation of metropolitan metro 
systems have generally been the focus of the daily public.  
Various studies have been reported, including technical issues 
of the MRT.  Rail track condition monitoring is an important 
technical concern of the MRT system [2].  However, constant 
monitoring of the MRT system is not available, typically the 
usual maintenance is performed once a month or less.  Track 
condition has attracted much attention since it is a potential 
threat to the railway system.  Studies to prevent such problem 
have been reported [3]-[5].  The general goal of the research 
and technical modifications is to improve the performance and 
reliability of a mass rapid transit system.       
Comparing information of other metropolitan mass 
transport systems may be helpful.  As reported in [6], train 
R36 of the New York metropolitan subway serviced from 
1964 to 2003, a total of 39 years.  R160s were used to replace 
45-year-old trains.  News reported that the oldest trains of the 
New York City Subway were planned to serve for 58 years, 
and later this type of train were actually found too old with 
very high failure rate and not appealing to the general public 
[7].  The subway train lifetime was estimated to be around 40 
to 50 years.  For example, since 1987, some lines of Singapore 
Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) have been operating for 30 years.  
Thus, the actual wear-out period of a metro system, assuming 
they are similar, may roughly lie between 20 years (the oldest 
TRTC asset), and 40 years (New York City Subway).  
However, all of these metropolitan metro systems are different 
in various aspects, including: model, company, maintenance, 
management culture, etc.  It is natural that the characteristics 
of these MRT systems are not the same or even far from 
similar.  With multiple factors entangled, the problem to 
accurately assess the system performance and age may be very 
challenging. 
Assessment and quantification of the system current 
status are essential to improving performance; to accurately 
assess the system current status is often nontrivial.  The 
degradation curve is commonly employed for estimation of 
the system current status.  Analysis of the reliability relies on 
the failure rate and maintenance records [8].  Based on the 
status of the system, possible improvement of the

maintenance and performance can be assessed.  To study the 
maintenance and performance characteristics, various 
approaches have been reported [9]-[17], including the 
popular bathtub curve analysis [18]-[23].  Typically the 
Bathtub-shaped curve is employed for system performance 
analysis [24].  Analysis based upon the bathtub curve has 
been extensively applied to various problems; modifications 
to improve applicability have been reported [11], [25], [26].  
It is possible that the bathtub-shaped curve could be affected 
by human factors; for example, if the asset retired in its early 
stage, the curve may not rise up within the wear-out period 
and may even descend.  If properly maintained, the curve 
may not rise in the wear-out period, similar to the situation in 
airline industry.  However, few MRT systems in reality 
exhibit degradation behavior similar to the bathtub-shaped 
curve model [27].  It is possible such bathtub curve may not 
be the ideal model for analyzing the metro system 
performance.   
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
describes the goal of this research project. Section III 
describes the research method.  Section IV summarizes the 
data analysis.  A summary is presented in Section V, a 
conclusion in Section VI, and lastly, a description of the

RESEARCH GOAL 
We propose a thorough investigation of the Taipei MRT 
data.  Available data consists of 11 MRT systems: electric 
multiple unit (EMU) propulsion, EMU air conditioner, EMU 
communication, switcher, platform door, 22kV switchboard, 
automated fare collection (AFC) door, Wenhu Line traffic 
control computer, transmission system, elevator, and 
escalator.  By analyzing the dataset with various approaches, 
such as deep learning, the research objective is to analyze the 
current status of the system, and identify possible tendencies 
or features that may be indicative of the system performance. 
III. 
METHODS 
The bathtub-shaped curve model [24] is commonly 
employed to assess the system condition.  It consists of a 
break-in trend as the system condition improves, followed by 
a plateau regime where the system condition is stable; after 
the stable regime, the system condition withers with 
increased malfunction rate, followed by a steep increase of 
malfunction rate as the system breaks down.  Together, the 
bathtub-shaped curve represents the various stages of an ideal 
system.   
The bathtub-shaped degradation curve is a theoretical 
model used in many problems.  It is an idealized evolution 
trend of a system.  The feasibility of applying such bathtub-
shaped curve may depend on the application.  Specifically, 
the system condition may not follow the same degradation 
curve, also, each equipment system may exhibit different 
characteristics depending on the specific application.  
Furthermore, each equipment in the Taipei metro system 
consists of various brands and various models that may 
possess different intrinsic characteristics.  Together, all these 
factors intertwined complicates the situation and it is very 
challenging to dis-entangle the complex problem.  
Ideally, analysis of the maintenance data would yield a 
simple bathtub-shaped degradation curve for each equipment.  
However, most systems do not follow the same degradation 
curve, not to mention each equipment may exhibit different 
characteristics. Since each equipment is maintained by 
human, the degradation curve is unlikely to be a simple 
universal bathtub-shaped curve.  By analyzing the 
maintenance data, our goal is to decipher the feasibility to 
assess the MRT current stage of life based on available data 
ranging over a limited time-span. 
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
We use the maintenance records provided by TRTC.  The 
AFC gates statistics are shown in Figure 1; the average 
malfunction rate is calculated and shown in Figure 2.  As 
shown in Figure 1, the equipment consists of mixed brand, 
model, age; thus, the total number of malfunctions is not 
representative of individual equipment. 
Based on the data analysis, it is found that the failure rate 
has been declining each year.  It is speculated that this 
declination is due to the TRTC’s maintenance becoming 
better and better.  On the other hand, because of the difference 
on the age and amount of the equipment, the total number of 
malfunctions is not a direct indication of the failure rate of a 
specific equipment. 
 
 
 
With sufficient maintenance data of escalators and 
elevators, we try to quantify the failure rate vs. the age of each 
individual equipment.  On the other hand, for some 
equipment that seem to have no difference among each other, 
e.g., EMU, platform door, switcher and 22kV switchboard, 
we use the original method of analyzing the failure times 
against failure date.  As for the Wenhu line Central control

decreases monotonically with time.   (Blue line): the total number of 
incidences per month; (orange line): the total number of equipment (as 
the MRT system is expands, the total number of equipment increases; 
(gray line): the monthly malfunction rate.

computers, AFC gates and transmission system, we cannot 
decipher the replaced new ones from others, so we employ 
the latter method. 
The following data of the number of escalators, elevators, 
equipment of individual station and the operation time of 
individual equipment are acquired from the Internet data and 
the records given by TRTC, and may differ from the actual 
number.  
 
 
 
 
Notice that the malfunction rate of Figure 2 rises on both 
ends of the curve.  The malfunction rate increases with time 
as the system becomes frail and old.  Also, the data points on 
the left and right side of the curve each belongs to different 
groups of systems.  It is speculated that the systems of the left 
side may have received adequate maintenance from the early 
years and therefore exhibits a lower malfunction rate; 
whereas the systems of the right side received adequate 
maintenance in its later years and therefore exhibits a higher 
malfunction rate. 
 
 
 
We also tried categorizing the maintenance record 
according to different subway lines (Figure 3).  Notice that 
the data span varies for each subway line, since some subway 
stations were built much earlier and some were built later.  
However, there are possible pitfalls with such categorization: 
each subway line has different number of stations; even along 
the same subway line, the age of each station also differs.  For 
example, for the Songshan-Xintien Line, its stations roughly 
can be divided into two groups: stations that have been 
established for more than ten years, or less than ten years.  If 
each sub-group has a characteristic peak, then the overall 
malfunction rate of Songshan-Xintien Line may exhibit two 
peaks due to each sub-groups.  Analyzing the same escalator 
all employed  the same time should be more appropriate.   
 
 
 
As shown in Figure 4, the malfunction incidents as a 
function of station age is sporadic.  It is infeasible to add up 
all these curves of different stations, because some stations 
have more escalators and the weighting differs.  Nevertheless, 
though sporadic, the average malfunction incident rate is 
clearly lower for younger stations.

In Figure 5, the trend varies with different brands.  In 
addition, the number of escalators of each brand is not the 
same and therefore the comparison may not be conclusive. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6 is obtained by averaging the malfunction rate of 
each elevator.  There is some increase followed by decrease 
in the middle.  Overall, there is no clear trend of increase or 
decrease.   
 
 
 
 
 
The elevator average malfunction rate vs. age (year) is 
shown in Figure 7.  The data was reorganized; the trend as 
shown can be separated into two groups (the two red boxes 
as indicated in Figure 7).  It seems that the younger group of 
elevators (left red box) and older group (right red box) of 
elevators both exhibit a decrease in the malfunction rate with 
time.  It is suggested that the maintenance technique may 
have improved or maintenance has been employed more 
frequently, so that the malfunction rate degrease with time, 
regardless of the specific age of the elevator.   
 
Figure 8 is the malfunction rate plotted against the 
number of years to date.  The overall variation does not show 
a monotonic trend.  It is suggested that the malfunction rate 
of the elevator is not directly dependent upon the elevator age.

The elevator average malfunction incidents vs. age (year) 
is depicted in Figure 9; the trend is similar to Figure 8.  The 
variation between each month is not pronounced; in addition, 
increase, decrease, occurs sporadically.  Overall, the 
characteristics are not apparent.     
Figure 10 is the malfunction rate as a function of age for 
20 elevators.  The plotted data exhibits large variations with 
sporadic behavior.  It is difficult to come up with an average 
trend to represent the general behavior of these elevators.   
    
 
 
 
The number of elevator malfunction incidents as a 
function of age is shown in Figure 11.  As compared to the 
escalator, there is not apparent increase of the malfunction 
rate similar to the elevator case (Figure 2).  Then we analyze 
the maintenance record of the MRT transmission system.  
Though the total number of transmission system is given, the 
age of each transmission system cannot be deciphered.  
    
 
 
As shown in Figure 12, the total number of transmission 
systems increases with time, and the number of malfunction 
incidents also increased slightly with time.  The malfunction 
ratio (gray line) does not show an overall increase with time. 
 
 
 
 
As shown in Figure 13, the total number of malfunction 
counts per month appears to be steady.  However, since the 
total number of equipment varied with time, this steadiness 
of the escalator malfunction rate is not conclusive.  More data 
is required to ascertain its general trend.     
 
 
 
The malfunction count per year for an individual escalator 
is plotted in Figure 14.  The decrease near age of 20 years 
may be due to incomplete data.  Overall, the malfunction 
count per year is steady and gradually rises with time.

Figure 15 is the average escalator malfunction rate, 
showing a trend of gradual increase with the escalator age.  
However, the overall malfunction rate should increase with 
age; we anticipate the general trend increases if the data range 
is expended to 40 years or more. 
 
 
Figure 16 is the malfunction rate for six individual 
escalators.  Notice that the individual variation is pronounced, 
suggesting that malfunction rate is not solely dependent upon 
the age of the escalator.    
Trend of the maintenance data showed that the failure rate 
has been declining every year until it reached low and stable 
end tail.  Possible factors are analyzed; this mostly likely is 
due to the improvement of MRT maintenance.  On the other 
hand, since the age of each equipment and the number of 
samples for each equipment are not consistent, the total 
failure rate is not a fair representation of a specific individual 
equipment.  Thus, our goal is to analyze the age’s effect of 
the individual equipment. 
 
 
With sufficient maintenance data of escalators and 
elevators, we quantify the failure rate vs. the age for each 
individual equipment with correlation analysis.  On the other 
hand, for some equipment that seem to have no variation 
among one another, e.g., EMU, platform door, switcher and 
22kV switchboard, we propose to calculate the malfunction 
rate vs. date of incident.  As shown in Figure 17, the Wenhu 
line Central AFC gate failure rate vs. date is analyzed.  The 
spikes at the center is likely due to lack of sufficient data 
points to reveal detail trend.  Overall, the malfunction rate 
decreases and later increases, exhibiting behavior similar to a 
bathtub curve.   
Then we analyze the maintenance data of the escalator 
system, elevator system, and EMU air conditioner of the 
metro system.  These three systems are essential components 
of the metro system.  The elevator and escalator are used 
regularly by the commuting people.   
 
 
 
There are 1144 escalators that have been recorded.  From 
Figure 18, it is apparent that the malfunction rate increases 
with time.  Nevertheless, there are two major age groups of 
escalators; it is unclear the trend of the younger group and 
older group of escalators are the same.  Data analysis suggests 
Figure 15.  The average escalator malfunction rate.  This is the 
average malfunction rate acquired from Figure 14.  Notice that 
the overall malfunction rate gradually increases with age.

that these two group should be analyzed separately instead of 
as a whole.   
The maintenance records of the elevator, escalator, and 
EMU air conditioner are analyzed.  As shown in Figure 18, 
the maintenance record of the escalator is depicted; trend of 
the malfunction rate is irregular.  Maybe due to limited span 
of the maintenance data, the specific stage of life-time is not 
apparent; further analysis is required. 
 
 
 
Next, the maintenance record of the elevator system is 
shown in Figure 19.  The maintenance record decreases with 
time monotonically.  This monotonic trend appears to be a 
good match with the ideal bathtub-shaped curve. 
Lastly, the maintenance record of the EMU air conditioner 
is shown in Figure 20, also exhibiting a decrease in its 
malfunction rate.  However, compared to the smooth trend of 
Figure 8, the EMU air conditioner maintenance data is more 
volatile.  Though the maintenance data of the three systems 
differ, they all roughly decrease with time, suggesting that the 
system is still young whereas the performance is still 
improving.  Or, the system is being well-maintained such that 
the malfunction rate does not reflect the system performance 
accurately.  
 
 
The maintenance record provided by TRTC consists of 
only number of malfunction incidents per month.  However, 
the severity of each malfunction may be drastically different, 
from as simple as the replacement of light bulb, up to power 
combustion resulting in system complete breakdown.  Yet, in 
the available maintenance records, there is no information 
describing the severity of the malfunction event.  Statistical 
analyses of these three systems (escalator, elevator, and EMU 
air conditioner) exhibit no apparent degradation of the system.  
Trends of the maintenance records suggest that the system 
condition improves with time, which is not the typical 
characteristics of a withering system.   
 
 
More data point is required to determine the general trend 
of the malfunction rate.  As shown in Figure 21, the trend 
decreases slightly with age; additional data point would be 
helpful to pinpoint the overall malfunction rate trend.  
Similarly, in Figure 22, more data is required to depict the 
trend of the malfunction rate of Muzha Line MRT platform 
screen door.

DISCUSSION 
Taipei Metro is still very young compared to other 
metropolitan metro systems in the world.  For instance, the 
first subway route of New York City began operating in 1904 
[6]; Tokyo Metro began operating in 1927.  As mentioned in 
related data survey, New York Subway replaces its trains 
about every 40 years, far older than TRTC’s age.  Based on 
the available Taipei metro maintenance record, the objective 
of this research is to assess the current condition of the metro 
system, and furthermore, if possible, to estimate the 
remaining lifetime of each system.   
By means of data analysis, our goal is to identify 
characteristics indicative of the current status of the metro 
system, remaining lifetime, and extrapolate its future trend.  
Data analysis of the Taipei metro system maintenance record 
revealed general trend and characteristics of the system 
condition and performance, however, information regarding 
the total lifespan of the system, current stage-of-life, and 
remaining lifetime have not been ascertained.  Possible 
reasons include: i) the system is still in its early stage, ii) the 
regular maintenance altered the natural deterioration trend, iii) 
the maintenance records being insufficient both in quantity 
and variety.  As a result, the estimation of system remaining 
lifetime based on the limited maintenance data is very 
challenging.   
On the other hand, using the count of malfunction 
incidents reported each month to assess the performance of 
Taipei Metro system is not very sensitive or informative. 
There are various types of malfunction, small glitches in the 
system, or, as large as a system failure, each of these incident 
reports are treated and weighed equally as a single event.  
Thus, the recorded failure rate is not an accurate measure of 
the system performance.  Furthermore, each equipment 
consists of various brands and models, it may be infeasible to 
statistically come up with a universal degradation 
relationship for such complex systems.   
Furthermore, with essential components replaced by new 
ones through regular maintenance is like renewing the system 
lifetime, which further complicates the estimation of system 
lifetime.  As for when an equipment is due to be replaced is 
determined by a wide range of factors, including: economic 
consideration, new technology, the public opinion for a 
trendy new system, etc.  Oftentimes the equipment may be 
operating properly, yet, it is retired and replaced for non-
technical reasons such as politics or public opinion, etc.  
Thus, for pragmatic concerns, lifespan of the equipment is 
not the critical factor for retirement/replacement.  
On a more fundamental level, it is undetermined that the 
desired information can be extracted from the maintenance 
record.  The specific information may be entangled and 
infeasible to be extracted from the limited maintenance 
records.  More importantly, the desired information may not 
be fully contained within the dataset.  The maintenance 
record may cover only a small fraction of the entire system 
lifespan.  Therefore, the accuracy to estimate the system 
lifetime based upon the provided information may be limited.  
Even though the malfunction rate may not be a sensitive 
and reliable measure of the Metro system present status, it 
can still provide useful information: i) the maintenance is 
considered appropriate if the failure rate continues to stay 
low; ii) the maintenance needs to be renovated if the failure 
rate continues to increase.  We suggest recording more 
parameters that are indicative of the equipment status, such 
as: recording the number of passengers using the equipment, 
the operating time, the number of passengers effected by the 
failure incident, the cost of repair, or even the weather 
condition such as humidity or earthquake.  Recent research 
[7] suggested that system performance can be better assessed 
with more information used to monitor the system; the 
analysis outcome can better reflect the system status and 
remaining lifetime.   
Based on the available maintenance record of the Taipei 
metro system, statistical analysis indicates that no signs of 
deterioration or withering.  The data analysis falls short to 
yield information regarding the total lifespan, the current 
stage of life, and the remaining lifetime.  If data with longer 
span and more variables is available, it is possible that such 
information can be ascertained.  On the other hand, data 
analysis shows that the maintenance of the Taipei metro 
system is adequate.   
Overall, TRTC is doing a fine job in terms of maintenance 
and repair, which is clearly reflected in its low malfunction 
rate.  Based on the maintenance record, it is reasonable to 
extrapolate and predict that the Taipei Metro system can 
maintain its current level of performance for a good 20 to 60 
years without significant degradation.  Since “trendiness” 
cannot be achieved via maintenance, if the Metro system is 
renovated every few years with new technology and trendy 
products such as slick new cable cars with new technologies; 
brighter flat displays with higher contrast, smart tint 
windows, etc., it is possible that Taipei Metro system can 
maintain a constant modern slick appearance that differs from 
other metropolitan metro systems (such as Tokyo, New York, 
Boston, etc.) that appears to be aged.   As the maintenance 
data has shown, the Taipei Metro system is performing well 
and data analysis suggests that it would likely continue its 
performance at its current standard.   
 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
    The maintenance record provided by TRTC contains only 
number of malfunction incidents per month; the record 
contained no severity information or detailed description of 
the specific malfunction.  Thus, the simple malfunction rate 
record falls short to provide an informative description of the 
status of the Taipei metro system, which involves enormous 
number of factors including human.  Such complex system 
exhibits sophisticated characteristics that can hardly be 
characterized with a single variable.  Thus, it is unrealistic to 
decipher the system status with just a single variable.

    Nevertheless, we believe rich information is embedded 
within the maintenance records and can be harnessed with the 
appropriate analysis tools.  Possibly with big data analysis, 
one can decipher more information that may help enhance the 
MRT performance.  Instead of a single parameter (number of 
malfunction incidents per month), with more recorded data 
(i.e., longer timespan, wider variety of variables, and detailed 
description of each malfunction incident), combined with big 
data analysis, it would be more feasible to yield information 
indicative of the system condition to better monitor the 
system condition. 
 
 
VII. FUTURE WORK 
In order to extract information indicative of the system 
status, we propose the following:   
First, based upon the original maintenance records, 
calculate the duration between: i) when the equipment was 
first engaged in operation, and ii) the failure date. This time 
interval represents the duration of malfunction-free operation, 
which is also the time for a malfunction to take place.  By 
analyzing the malfunction-free duration instead of the number 
of malfunctions each month may yield more realistic 
relationship.   
Second, calculate the failure times per month to acquire 
the failure rate for each individual equipment.  (For the 
equipment related to EMU, the failure rate is acquired by the 
failure time divided by the total mileage.) 
Third, average each equipment’s failure times to get the 
average failure rate.  Use a statistical software to calculate the 
regression curve, and extrapolate to compare with other metro 
system performance data. 
The above three steps are to be performed repeatedly.  
Each step is employed to process another set of data. The 
difference between each dataset is compared and analyzed for 
its regression behavior and general trend.  Based on 
experience analyzing the Taipei MRT dataset, we believe the 
above approach would enable extraction of crucial 
information that is indicative of the system status.
