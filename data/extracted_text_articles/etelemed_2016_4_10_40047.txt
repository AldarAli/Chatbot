Abstract—Telerehabilitation allows continued rehabilitation at 
home after discharge. The use of rehabilitation technology 
supporting wrist and hand movements within a motivational 
gaming 
environment 
could 
enable 
patients 
to 
train 
independently and ultimately serve as a way to increase the 
dosage of practice. This has been previously examined in the 
European Supervised Care & Rehabilitation Involving 
Personal Telerobotics (SCRIPT) project using a first 
prototype, showing potential feasibility, although several 
usability issues needed further attention. The current study 
examined feasibility and clinical changes of a second iteration 
training system, involving an updated wrist and hand 
supporting orthosis and larger variety of games with respect to 
the first iteration. The paper is relevant for the conference, 
reporting a new telemedicine service, combining physical 
orthotic support with remote offline supervision, for 
telerehabilitation at home after stroke. Nine chronic stroke 
patients with impaired arm and hand function were recruited 
to use the training system at home for six weeks. Evaluation of 
feasibility and arm and hand function were assessed before 
and after training. Median weekly training duration was 113 
minutes. Participants accepted the six weeks of training 
(median Intrinsic Motivation Inventory = 4.4 points and 
median System Usability Scale = 73%). After training, 
significant improvements were found for the Fugl-Meyer 
assessment, Action Research Arm Test and self-perceived 
amount of arm and hand use in daily life. These findings 
indicate that technology-supported arm and hand training can 
be a promising tool for self-administered practice at home 
after stroke.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Stroke is one of the most common causes of adult 
disability. Even in the chronic phase, motor problems still 
persist in the majority of stroke patients [1], leading to 
difficulties in performing activities of daily living 
independently. Motor problems that persist in the chronic 
phase may be partly due to learned nonuse of the affected 
upper limb [2]. Stimulating the use of the affected upper 
extremity has shown to overcome the learned nonuse [3]. 
Technology has the potential to support rehabilitation 
since it can provide high-intensive, repetitive, task-specific, 
interactive treatment of the impaired upper extremity. 
Besides, it has the potential to accurately quantify therapy 
and monitor patients’ progress, while also providing 
immediate feedback to patients, as well as therapists. 
Rehabilitation robotics has been shown to be as effective as 
conventional rehabilitation for the hemiparetic arm [4]-[7]. 
Most research so far has shown significant improvements in 
upper limb motor function, although evidence of the transfer 
of robotic training effects to activities in daily life remains 
limited, as is observed for most interventions in stroke 
rehabilitation, including conventional therapy [8]. To 
maximize independent use of the upper extremity in daily 
life, it is important to include functional movements of both 
the proximal and distal arm and hand into post-stroke 
training, since a generalization effect to improvements on the 
entire upper extremity was found [9][10].  
Most robotic devices are mainly suitable for the clinical 
setting with direct supervision of a therapist [5]. A next step 
would be to provide such systems at home, to enable self-
administered practice of the arm and hand after stroke [11]. 
This is especially interesting since an increasing number of 
stroke survivors is expected, which will result in increased 
demands on healthcare systems [12]. New ways of providing 
healthcare services, such as teleconsultation and remote 
monitoring and treatment in the patient’s home are therefore 
needed.  
Telemedicine systems for upper extremity exercise 
showed promising results in improving health of stroke 
patients [13]. In addition, healthcare professionals and 
participants reported good levels of satisfaction and 
acceptance of telerehabilitation interventions [13][14]. This 
is in line with the precursor of the current study, using a 
passive device with three motivational rehabilitation games 
for arm and hand training at home [15][16], showing that the

training was motivational which was underlined by an 
average weekly training duration of 105 ± 66 minutes. 
Usability showed potential, although several usability issues 
needed further attention. Clinical evaluations showed modest 
changes in arm and hand function [15]. 
In the current study, we expanded this research by using 
a next iteration of the developed training system. Lessons 
learned regarding usability findings, therapeutic benefit and 
practical issues which were obtained in the first iteration of 
patient measurements with the SCRIPT system [15][16] have 
been taken into account for the design of the second 
prototype. An updated passive wrist and hand orthosis with 
improved user interface including nine exercise games was 
provided. The new games further focused on functional 
exercises incorporating versatile grasping gestures. The 
second prototype was evaluated with a new group of chronic 
stroke patients. The objective of the current study was to 
examine feasibility (user acceptance and adherence) and 
clinical changes in arm and hand function of a second 
generation technology-supported arm and hand training 
system at home in chronic stroke. The paper is structured as 
follows: the methods of the study are presented in Section 2, 
the results are shown in Section 3, followed by the 
discussion in Section 4 and conclusion in Section 5. 
II. 
METHODS 
A. Participants 
Participants 
were 
recruited 
from 
the 
Roessingh 
Rehabilitation center, Enschede, the Netherlands and IRCCS 
San Raffaele Pisana, Rome, Italy. Participants were eligible 
for inclusion if they (1) had a stroke between 6 months and 5 
years ago; (2) were between 18 and 80 years of age; (3) had 
limited arm and hand function because of the stroke, but 
having at least active control of 15° elbow flexion and 
having active finger flexion of at least a quarter of the 
passive range of motion; (4) were living at home and having 
internet access; (5) were able to understand and follow 
instructions; (6) had no additional orthopedic, neurological, 
or rheumatologic disease of the upper extremity; and (7) no 
severe neglect or uncorrected visual impairments. All 
participants provided written informed consent before 
participation. The study protocol was approved by the local 
medical ethics committees (Medisch Spectrum Twente, 
Enschede, the Netherlands and the IRCCS San Raffaele 
Pisana ethics committee, Rome, Italy). 
B. Study design 
This feasibility study has a longitudinal design. The 
participants received six weeks of self-administered 
technology-supported training for the arm and hand at home. 
Evaluation of arm and hand function was based on a baseline 
measurement pre-training and an evaluation measurement 
within one week post-training, performed at the research lab 
of the rehabilitation center. 
C. Training intervention 
Participants used a technology-supported training system 
[16], which consisted of a slightly adapted version of the 
SCRIPT dynamic wrist and hand orthosis [17], a mobile arm 
support (SaeboMAS, Saebo Inc., Charlotte NC, USA) and a 
computer with webcam and touchscreen displaying exercise 
games (Figure 1). The mobile arm support was used to 
support the weight of the proximal arm. The wrist and hand 
orthosis is a passive exoskeleton worn on the forearm and 
hand, customized to the hand size of each participant. It 
provides extension forces to the wrist and fingers via passive 
leaf springs and elastic tension cords [17]. The orthosis was 
equipped with sensors to measure joint excursions of the 
wrist and hand, which allowed control of nine exercise 
games. A green marker placed on the hand plate of the 
orthosis was used to track the location of the orthosis by 
means of a camera placed on top of the screen to incorporate 
translational movements of the arm.  
The exercise games consisted of various difficulty 
categories, to match the progress of individual participants. 
The categories were classified in a game difficulty schedule, 
ranked according to increasing complexity. Complexity was 
higher when a game required multiple movement planes 
(from 1D to 3D), involved a higher number of gestures to 
control the game, movements with progression from 
proximal to distal movements or gross to fine manipulation. 
The gestures needed to control the games were hand opening 
and closing, wrist flexion and extension, forearm pronation 
and supination, and reaching forwards, backwards and 
moving left or right. For hand opening and closing we could 
distinguish a general grasp, cylinder grasp, tripod grasp and 
lateral grasp, which have been shown to be reliable hand 
postures which could be recognized during performance of 
rehabilitation games [18]. Translational movements of the 
hand were integrated with wrist and hand movements (e.g., 
moving the hand to a target, grasping, transferring to a 
different target, releasing) to emphasize functional, task-
specific movements. 
The training environment was available within a 
motivational 
user 
interface 
including 
feedback 
on 
performance, which was displayed on the touchscreen. The 
general recommendation for training was about 30 minutes 
per day, six days a week. Participants could train at the time

of the day they preferred and were allowed to practice 
additionally if they wished to. A trained healthcare 
professional followed the participants’ training progress 
remotely, offline, via another user interface available on a 
secured website and provided feedback by means of sending 
motivational messages when training duration was low. In 
addition, the healthcare professional visited each participant 
once per week to ensure competence with the training 
system, informally monitor progress, and to answer potential 
questions. Based on performance of the exercise games, in 
addition to ranking on the game difficulty schedule, the 
healthcare professional decided if a participant could move 
up to the next category of games. The professional adjusted 
the training program for the participants remotely. 
D. Evaluation 
1) User experience 
The 
frequency 
and 
duration 
of 
training 
were 
automatically stored within the system and displayed in the 
user interface. The total minutes of training per week were 
counted to provide the total weekly training duration. These 
weekly training durations of all six weeks of training were 
used to calculate the average amount of practice over six 
weeks.  
Motivation during training was measured using the 
Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire [19]. It 
provides qualitative information about the content and level 
of motivation that a participant experienced during the 
training period (maximum score = 7). A higher score 
represents higher motivation during training, with a neutral 
score of four. 
The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a 10-item scale 
providing a global view of subjective usability [20][21]. The 
questions were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 
‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’. Scores are translated 
to 0–100%, with a higher score representing better usability. 
Interventions with scores in the 90s are exceptional, scores in 
the 70s and 80s are promising, and with SUS scores below 
50 one can be almost certain that the intervention will have 
usability difficulties in the field. The SUS and IMI were 
completed during the post-evaluation measurement only. 
2) Arm and hand function tests 
Clinical tests were used to quantify general arm function 
before and after the training. The scales used are valid, 
standardized assessments, which were performed according 
to their specific test protocols.  
The upper extremity part of the Brunnstrom Fugl-Meyer 
assessment (FM) evaluates motor status and the degree of 
synergy-development in the arm (maximum score = 66) [22]. 
Separate scores were calculated for proximal (maximum = 
42) and distal components of the FM (maximum = 24). 
The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) evaluates 
coordination, dexterity and upper extremity function on the 
subtests grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement 
(maximum score = 57) [23].  
The Motor Activity Log (MAL) is a semi-structured 
interview for hemiparetic stroke patients to assess the 
perceived use of their paretic arm and hand (amount of use 
(AOU) and quality of movement (QOM)) during activities of 
daily living (maximum score = 5 per subsection) [24].  
The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) was used to assess 
changes in function, activity and participation following 
stroke. The questionnaire assesses eight domains related to 
function, activities and participation. Each domain score has 
a range of zero to hundred percent, with a higher score 
indicating better quality of life [25]. 
E. Statistical analyses 
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS 
Statistics 
19 
for 
Windows. 
Outcomes 
were 
non-
parametrically tested for statistical significance due to the 
small sample size. Descriptive statistical methods (median 
with interquartile range (IQR)) were used to describe the 
participant characteristics and all outcome measures. 
Outcomes of each clinical scale were compared between 
both evaluation measurements using the Wilcoxon signed 
rank test. The level for significance was set at α ≤ .05. 
III. 
RESULTS 
A. Participants 
Nine participants (six in the Netherlands, three in Italy) 
were included in the study. Two participants were lost to the 
study. One because of personal problems not related to this 
study and one having recurrent technical problems with the 
system. The characteristics of the remaining seven 
participants are shown in Table 1. 
B. User experience 
The participants actually used the system, but with a 
large amount of variation between and within individuals 
(Figure 2). Median weekly training duration for the group, 
averaged over six weeks, was 113 (IQR 69 – 158) minutes. 
One participant (E01) exceeded the advised training duration 
of 180 minutes per week once, and two other participants 
(D08 and E03) exceeded the advised duration several times. 
The median score on the SUS was 73% (IQR 60% – 
83%). On individual level, four participants rated usability 
over 70% and three participants between 50 and 70%. 
Overall, the participants enjoyed the six weeks of 
training, as reflected in the overall median score on the IMI 
of 4.4 points (IQR 3.9 – 6.0 points). Table 2 shows 
individual participant results and group medians on all 
outcomes.

C. Arm and hand function tests 
On group level, the Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a 
significant improvement after training for the FM total, FM 
proximal part, ARAT, and MAL AOU (Table 3). The FM 
showed a median improvement of 4.0 points (P = 0.034) for 
the total scale, and median improvement of 3.0 points (P = 
0.027) for the proximal part only. The ARAT improved with 
median 2.0 points (P = 0.045) over training, and the MAL 
AOU with median 0.2 points (P = 0.046). 
Examination of individual scores (Table 2) shows quite 
substantial improvements for one participant (E01), grossly 
exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (MID) 
for FM and ARAT [26], constituting changes greater than 
10% of the total score. Participant E03 approaches MCID for 
FM with six points improvement. In addition, two 
participants (D09 and E03) exceeded MCID for the MAL 
QOM, of which E03 also exceeded MCID on MAL AOU 
[27], and participant E01 approaches MCID for both MAL 
AOU and QOM. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
A second generation technology-supported arm and hand 
training system was evaluated in patients with chronic stroke 
in their own home. The present findings show that training at 
home using the training system was feasible, since patients 
accepted the training well (median SUS = 73%) and were 
motivated (median IMI = 4.4). This was reflected in a 
median weekly training duration of 113 minutes (i.e.,

approximately 15 minutes per day). Participants showed 
improvements in arm and hand function, dexterity and self-
perceived amount of arm and hand use in daily life.  
The motivation outcomes of the current study indicate 
that patients perceived the training as motivating, to a similar 
extent as interventions applying rehabilitation technology in 
a clinical setting [28][29]. With a median SUS score of 73% 
the training system was rated as promising. This might be 
related to a large variation of games available in the current 
study, which was much appreciated by the participants. 
Although participants positively valued the training system, 
several usability issues were identified and should be 
considered when implementing further design adaptations. 
In particular, some games caused errors after leaving the 
pause screen resulting in incorrect saving of the data, 
controlling one game was not clear for some participants, 
and another game had limited fluent game control in poor 
day light. The game utilized the position of a marker on the 
orthosis to determine hand position in space, however poor 
day light impacted on capturing this position accurately. 
Although these issues were not major, if repeated or 
cumulative, they are likely to result in frustration and might 
influence the motivation and attitude towards use of the 
system, which can negatively affect the adherence to training 
over time [30].  
In the current study, participants were able to make their 
own decisions about their training schedule, without direct, 
real-time supervision of a therapist. The rationale for this 
was to remove the training constraints and increase therapy 
availability. Compared to previous telerehabilitation studies 
in which training sessions are often scheduled beforehand 
and with direct supervision [13][31], the achieved training 
duration of median 113 minutes per week was substantial,

suggesting that stroke patients do have the incentive to train 
at home and were able to use the system. This adherence 
falls within the range reported in other recent studies into 
technology-supported home-based self-administered upper 
limb therapy programs after stroke [30][32][33]. On the 
other hand, most participants did not reach the advised 
training duration, which is also comparable to these previous 
home-based studies [15][30][32][33]. 
One of the major assumptions concerning tele-
rehabilitation using technologies is that when patients accept 
the technology and clinically benefit from it, they will 
actually use such a system when provided. However in 
practice, several factors, such as low motivation, fatigue and 
musculoskeletal issues can result in limited adherence [34], 
while training dose is an important factor in rehabilitation 
outcome 
[35]. When considering individual results, 
participants who had a rather high amount of training per 
week (>100 minutes), showed substantial improvements on 
arm and hand function. This suggests that actual adherence 
during self-administered practice is a highly relevant 
outcome. Moreover, stimulation of adherence should receive 
wide attention when designing and implementing home-
based training interventions. 
Several strategies can be considered for stimulation of 
adherence. Research has shown that regular patient-therapist 
contact during treatment has a motivational effect and can 
increase therapy adherence [36]. In our study, additional 
motivational strategies were implemented in a subset of our 
games [37], to increase participants’ independent training 
time at home. This comprised more direct feedback about 
training duration, such as showing motivational messages 
about the duration after completion of each game, or 
continuously showing a timer during game play. We 
incorporated approaches from the field of psychology and 
education theory to further overcome this barrier, such as 
setting the correct balance between supporting and 
challenging, to maximize adherence to therapy [37]. 
However, our adaptive game-difficulty setting was not 
available in all games. In addition, patients’ self-discipline 
might also play a role in this kind of unsupervised home 
training. So in future, it is also valuable to look closer at 
other characteristics such as patients’ attitudes, personality 
traits, coping skills and commitments in daily life [30][32] to 
enable understanding of the most suitable patients for this 
kind of self-administered training.  
The extent of improvement in motor function of the arm 
in the present study corresponded with those found in other 
robot-aided studies in chronic stroke in a clinical setting [4]-
[7], and with therapy programs for the upper limb performed 
at home [13]. Perceived use of the affected arm in daily life 
as assessed by the MAL did significantly change on group 
level after six weeks training, which was also reflected in an 
improved dexterity capacity as measured by ARAT. Three of 
the games contained functional movements: integration of 
reaching, grasping and transportation simultaneously, and the 
inclusion of specific grasps, such as cylinder grasp, lateral 
grasp and palmar prehension grasp, to represent handling of 
different objects. This might have played a role in the 
improvements on activity level in the current study, since 
task-specificity is an important factor in restoration of arm 
and hand function after stroke [9][38]. However, these 
improvements are still modest on group level and not 
clinically relevant in terms of functional improvements. On 
the other hand, games with more complex gestures were only 
made available to patients after some progress was made in 
simpler games which could impact on the extent of these 
modest improvements. When these aspects are incorporated 
more prominently and in more games, exercises become 
even more functional and task-specific, which is expected to 
further enhance the clinical impact.  
This study was performed with chronic stroke patients, 
limiting bias from spontaneous recovery and simultaneous 
other treatments. Home-based training could be considered 
at an earlier stage, where larger treatment effects would be 
expected. Further, only data of seven chronic stroke patients 
with mainly moderate stroke are available. Findings of the 
present study can only be partly generalized to other stroke 
survivors because of the small number of participants in this 
study. Future research should consider implementing a large 
randomized controlled trial, with sufficient statistical power 
to compare the effects with a control group. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The positive results for motivation, usability and actual 
training duration in this study indicate that home-based 
technology-supported arm and hand training is a feasible tool 
to enable self-administered practice at home. The improved 
arm and hand function and increased performance on activity 
level (both actual as well as perceived) indicates that self-
administered home-based training can have a clinical value. 
Such an application has the potential to allow a higher dose 
of treatment than would be possible when depending on 
therapist availability in a conventional setting, if adherence 
can be stimulated further. Future research regarding 
telerehabilitation should therefore pay attention to adherence 
(stimulation) and the functional nature of exercises. 
Furthermore, identification of factors associated with better 
treatment outcomes (e.g., time post stroke, stroke severity 
and personal characteristics) is needed in order to understand 
who would benefit most from this technology-supported 
training at home.
