Abstract — Most financial documents are presented to 
governments and governors in computer language (e.g., 
XBRL). Information acquired from said reports should be 
free from faults, omissions and fraud, making it trustworthy 
to the point of supporting strategic decisions by the 
organizations that receive them. Although XBRL technologies 
present financial data and its accounting semantics, the 
auditing techniques used (which make this data even more 
trustworthy) are not stored or listed in the XBRL taxonomies. 
This fact makes it difficult to perform the auditing of these 
files,  given that it’s up to the auditor to apply the concepts of 
auditing manually, without the assistance of the automated 
auditing process. With the continuous auditing it’s more and 
more possible to avoid the recidivism of fraud or even to 
identify it more quickly. Despite many auditing operations 
being performed under the XBRL perspective, it has not yet 
been defined a standard for the auditing of XBRL files. This 
paper proposes the establishment of a link database 
(Linkbase, in XLINK language), based on the XBRL 
specifications, which has been named xAudit, for the listing 
and storing of auditing techniques in XBRL taxonomies. To 
do so, a solution has been created, based on the XBRL 
definitions and auditing-specific regulations. Using xAudit, 
people try to solve the shortage for a standard for XBRL 
auditing. Some important points of the auditing process are 
raised in the present article. Using xAudit, it’s expected that 
organizations can achieve improved results, real-time 
verification and accurate data analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Financial reports are meant to provide useful 
information for the interested sides involved in an 
organization or its processes. All information acquired 
from these reports should be free from mistakes, omissions 
and fraud, making it trustworthy to the point of supporting 
strategic decisions by the organizations that receive them 
[1].  
Auditing is a systematic process, documented and 
independent for the acquirement of evidence (registers, fact 
submission or other information) that aim to verify the 
satisfactory meeting of the defined criteria (set of policies, 
procedures or requirements) [2]. 
Standardizing is one of the factors that contribute for a 
suitable auditing, given that, with non-standardized data, 
it’s up to the auditor to manually “clean” the data so the 
automated auditing process can take place [1].  
XBRL technology has been increasingly utilized by 
national and international financial systems, such as 
SICONFI system, of the National Treasury Secretariat of 
Brazil [13]. In 2009, the American Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), started demanding for companies of 
local or foreign capital, with operations in the country, to 
disclose their financial reports in XBRL format [3]. In 
March of 2017, an update on their internal systems enabled 
public companies to use the XBRL format for the emission 
of financial statements, as well [4]. The Organisation for 
Economic 
Cooperation 
and 
Development 
(OECD) 
recommends that tax administrators take into consideration 
data formatting that allows for the use of automated 
auditing, in order to minimize potential costs for the 
interested 
sides. 
To 
that 
effect, 
the 
Organisation 
acknowledges in particular the use of open financial data 
standards, such as XBRL and XBRL GL [5]. 
Many auditing operations have been built on the XBRL 
perspective, such as the Forensic LMDQL [6]. In February 
4th, 2015, the XBRL International [7] organized a meeting 
to take a standing regarding the drafting of a proposal to be 
sent to members of the international normalization 
committee [8] to establish an International Standard (ISO) 
for auditing data with commercial and governmental usage, 
for both internal and external auditing. Several relevant 
decrees and regulations of international, national and 
regional levels were presented, but the project wasn’t 
approved nonetheless, given the proposal hadn’t taken into 
consideration several standards known to the committee, 
e.g., OECD Standard Audit File – Tax, United Nations 
auditing regulations [14], Swedish SIE [15], Dutch 
Auditfile Financieel [16], Object Management Group’s GL 
Facility and Open Application Group’s (OAGIS). Some 
aspects were pointed out to guide the improvement of the 
standardizing proposal, such as a more accurate definition 
of terms deemed vague and/or indeterminate [5], and so a 
new evaluation of the project is awaited anytime soon.  
Based on this scenario, as there is no agreement on 
which standard to be used or even a regulation as basis for 
the execution of the auditing process, it is understood that 
there’s a need for a generic standard for the representation 
of different auditing techniques, contributing to the 
implementation of auditing on XBRL reports. Therefore, an 
extension of the XBRL 2.1 is proposed, named xAudit, to 
assist in this process. Said extension is based on XBRL 
standards, such as Generic Links [17], so that it is a 
solution consistent with the syntactic and semantic 
structure of XBRL. xAudit can be a new and useful tool to 
aid and automate the auditing process in XBRL-formatted 
files.

THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
      This session presents the concepts of XBRL and 
Continuous Audit. 
A. XBRL
XBRL, is and open international standard, based on 
XML (Extensible Markup Language), meant for the 
exchange of business information. XBRL has its 
specifications 
defined 
by 
the 
XBRL 
International 
Consortium [18], being based on the technological 
standards of W3C [19]. XBRL is already present in many 
countries, including The United States, Japan, Korea, 
United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Argentina, France, 
China, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Brazil [9]. 
The XBRL 2.1 specification is formed by two main 
elements: taxonomy and instance document. In taxonomy, 
the terms representing financial concepts are described, i.e., 
the vocabulary that will be used in the instance document, 
as well as the relations between said terms, the description 
and classification of the business. The semantics and syntax 
of the financial information is described in the taxonomy. 
On the other hand, the instance document contains the 
financial data and the description of its textual elements. 
An instance document may be connected to more than one 
taxonomy at once, as long as it uses elements described in 
them. The set of these two elements, instance document 
and taxonomy, is what composes XBRL documents [10]. 
An XBRL document can be generated from data 
acquired from many sources, including, but not restricted 
to: XML documents, manual inputs and databases. The 
distribution of an XBRL document can be executed in a 
way that integrates it in several different formats (HTML, 
PDF, Word RTF) or even in a database [10]. Receiving 
documents in various formats, converting them into and 
auditable format (XBRL) favors the process of acquiring 
evidence generated in all organizational levels, in order to 
increase even further the amount for analysis or the range 
of the auditing. In addition, distributing the information in 
different formats allow even more integration between 
different software platforms. 
     With a standardized representation, the XBRL facilitates 
the acquisition of trustworthy and accurate data, providing 
a better analysis of the risk of the transaction, control 
mitigation and operational efficiency [10]. 
Financial information of the kind distributed through 
XBRL reports must be trustworthy, given that it is essential 
for the daily routine of organizations, as decisions about 
investments and credit, or even strategic organizational 
planning, are made based on it [1]. 
B. Continuous Auditing 
In the auditing process, the evidence is acquired and 
presented in conclusive reports, in a way that points out 
aspects that require improvements, as well as stresses 
unconformities, aiming to solve their original cause, thus 
avoiding recurrence.  
In traditional auditing, the process tends to be slow, 
especially because of aggravating effects such as the sample 
limitation or even the manual procedures. Generally, the 
market acts dynamically and, if the rhythm of the auditing is 
slower, the decision-making, most of the time, tends to be 
delayed, inducing a loss of competitive edge, increased 
costs and decreased productivity [10].  
In the paradigm of traditional auditing, the data is 
periodically verified and, as an outcome, faults, fraud or 
omissions can last long periods without being detected by 
an auditing or because of it [1].  
Continuous auditing takes place more frequently or 
even continuously. In this process, the monitoring of 
controls and operations in a shorter time lapse allow for the 
auditor to detect the deviations faster and more efficiently, 
contributing for a timely, adequate response [1]. 
The continuous auditing process becomes even more 
efficient with the use of technology and automation 
Improved methods make significant increases in efficiency 
of an auditing process more likely to happen, as it allow for 
more frequent auditings, making the information more 
reliable and readily available [1]. 
The monitoring and continuous auditing processes 
integrated with XBRL technology allow for data, in the 
operational level, to be defined in a single way, being then 
read, interpreted and analyzed in real time. A standardized 
representation favors a more trustworthy and efficient data 
collection, to achieve a higher capacity of data analysis, 
being able to account for negotiation risks, efficiency and 
operational control, meeting of determinations and demand 
verification in a shorter time [10]. 
For the present work, auditing techniques have been 
applied to enable the identification and responsibilization 
of the auditor, definition of context of the auditing to be 
executed, type and method of the auditing, conformity, 
action management, activities and processes scheduling, 
among others. Said techniques are available for reference in 
Section IV (xAudit Specification). 
III.
CORRELATED WORKS
The number of articles produced in Brazil about XBRL 
is not high. The main focuses of research, discussion and 
propagation of XBRL in Brazil are the TECSI-USP 
(Laboratory of Technology and Information Systems) 
coordinated by Dr. Edson Luiz Riccio, and the Group of 
Research in Software Engineering and Applications 
(GESA) [20] [21], laboratory of the master’s in Systems 
and Computing from UNIFACS (Salvador University), 
coordinated by professor Dr. Paulo Caetano da Silva 
(Farias, 2014). The former, TECSI, operates exclusively in 
the area of business, while the latter, GESA, develops 
works based on XBRL technology, both in the areas of 
business and Information Technology.  
Regulations and standards are defined in order to adapt, 
from the existing taxonomies, the needs of each country 
and region [5]. A few studies were pointed, regarding 
topics like the benefits and challenges of XBRL in Brazil; 
data models for federal organizations; continuous auditing, 
however not necessarily about XBRL; implications of 
XBRL in the process of continuous auditing.
It is noticed the existence of standards that enable data 
extraction from accountability systems, for example the 
standards developed by American Institute of Certified 
40

ICIW 2018 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

Public Accountants (AICPA), with the goal of generating 
files that are fit for auditing [11].  
Due to the difficulty in finding national and 
international researches about auditing in XBRL files, it is 
hoped that xAudit fills this gap, in order to instigate the 
topic in the academic community and create a generic 
representation for auditing techniques in XBRL-formatted 
data, thus allowing for the automation of auditing processes 
in XBRL documents, and its use in public and private 
institutions.
IV.
XAUDIT SPECIFICATION
Taking into account the existence of auditing 
regulations, such as NBR ISO 19011 (Guidelines for the 
auditing of quality and/or environmental management 
systems) [2], and the Data Standard for Auditing, proposed 
by American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
(AICPA) [3], it was sought, in this work, to analyze these 
documents in order to identify essential terminology and 
concepts for an auditing process that, put together and 
adjusted, could create a standard to be used jointly with 
XBRL technology for Continuous Auditing, in this case, 
the xAudit.  
In Figure 1, it is represented the set of documents used 
as basis for the theoretical foundation of xAudit, as well as 
its relationship with XBRL technology. 
Figure 1. xAudit.
To enable the execution of continuous auditing in 
XBRL files, a set of terms to be annexed to the xAudit 
taxonomy has been defined, which in turn represents part 
of the auditing process.  
In order for an auditing to take place, it is required that 
a range, criteria, reference regulations and evidence to be 
analyzed are defined. Aiming to meet the organizational 
schedule in what regards the period and scope of the 
audited processes, it is proposed the representation og an 
auditing plan, containing information, such as frequency, 
kind of auditing and responsible parts [2].  
This way, XBRL instances for certain processes may be 
analyzed based on the established criteria. The conformity 
analysis may also be executed, and log files generated, 
which will be basis for the composition of the 
recommendation report of the auditing. Taking into account 
the improvements pointed out, action plans can be laid out 
for monitoring the steps taken as a result of the auditing. 
In Figure 2, an UML representation of xAudit can be 
seen. Following that, its elements are described. 
Figure 2. UML representation of xAudit.
Given that business auditing techniques can be 
mathematically represented, this work also proposes the 
interconnection between xAudit and XBRL technologies, 
such as XBRL Formula and MathML, which represent 
documents of business regulations and mathematical 
calculations, respectively. It’s also presented in this work 
an XBRL Linkbase, as an xAudit element, to establish the 
connection between the technologies, as illustrated by 
Figure 3. 
Figure 3. Connection Between The Technologies.
The specific elements for the composition of xAudit are 
described below. 
A. Audit Schema 
The xAudit schema file defines the elements that can be 
part of the semantic representation of the auditing 
technique. These elements are based on XBRL taxonomy. 
B. Audit Linkbase 
The file <Audit Linkbase> is a document that stores the 
representation of the auditing technique and its connections 
with the business elements. This file is an specialization of 
the Generic Link specification (XBRL Inc., 2009), which 
has been devised to extend XBRL to new semantics.  
In this file (Audit Linkbase), the taxonomist expresses 
the elements that represent the auditing technique. This 
representation is based on the elements contained in the 
xAudit schema file, which is explained below: 
1)
Audit Link 
The element <AuditLink> represents a set of 
interconnected elements. The subelements of <AuditLink> 
are (i) Locator [12], which locates elements in the XBRL 
taxonomy (ii) Resource [12], specified to represent a 
41

ICIW 2018 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

resource to be used by the taxonomist and (iii) Arc [12], 
which establishes a connection arc between the previous 
elements. AuditLink may contain several Locators, 
Resources and Arcs. 
1.1)  Audit Technique 
The element <AuditTechnique> represents the auditing 
technique. Ten children elements have been specified for 
its formal representation: 
1.1.1)
TechniqueName
The element <TechniqueName> describes the name of 
the applied auditing technique. 
1.1.2)
Description
The element <Description> represents the theoretical 
concept of the technique represented in the file. This 
description has to be in natural language, as expressed in 
the Lang attribute. 
1.1.3)
Mathformula
The element <Mathformula> represents a mathematical 
formula that formalizes the respective auditing technique, 
based on the elements defined in the xAudit schema file. 
1.1.4)
ObjectiveAudit
The element <ObjectiveAudit> determines the objective 
of the auditing that will be executed. Three different 
objectives were defined, divided by level:   
●
Level 1: <Routine Check> (Detect routine 
transaction irregularities that stand out);
●
Level 2: <Conformity Check> (Aims to compare 
the set criteria with collected evidence);
●
Level 3: <Reanalysis check> (Redo the auditing 
process in order to verify the consistency of the 
collected data).
1.1.5)
Audit Plan
The element <AuditPlan> defines details that facilitate 
the understanding between the involved parts, in such a 
way that reflects the complexity of the auditing, just as 
much as it enables the process. Composed by the elements: 
<CriterionAudit>, 
<EscopeAudit>, 
<PeriodAudit>, 
<ProcesseActivitie>, 
<TypeAudit> 
e 
<ResponsabilitiesAudit>, described below:
1.1.5.1)
CriterionAudit
The element <CriterionAudit> is used as reference for 
ascertaining of conformity. It describes the regulations and 
regulatory items to be used as criteria. (EX: 1: NBC TA 
230 – AUDITING DOCUMENT - CFC, items 10 and 11, 
2: NBC TA 530 – AUDITING SAMPLING, items 5 and 
6);  
1.1.5.2)
EscopeAudit
The element <EscopeAudit> describes the scope and 
limits of the auditing that will be executed, in a way that 
defines what hierarchical or documental levels will be 
audited. 
1.1.5.3
PeriodAudit
<PeriodAudit> defines the period in which the audit 
will take place, as well as the schedule for its execution. 
1.1.5.4)
ProcessActivitie
<ProcessActivitie> defines the processes or activities 
that will go through documental analysis. 
1.1.5.5)
TypeAudit
<TypeAudit> determines if the auditing process will be 
carried out by an internal or external (independent) team, 
about the audited organization. 
1.1.5.6)
ResponsabilitiesAudit
The element <ResponsabilitiesAudit> delegates the 
responsible individuals, that will legally answer during the 
auditing, as well as the auditor responsible for the 
<ReportRecommendation>.  
1.1.6)
DocumentAnalises
The element <DocumentAnalises> is responsible for 
containing instances of the documents to be critically 
analyzed. It must be taken into consideration the size, 
complexity and nature of the organization, as well as the 
<ObjectivAudit> and the <EscopeAudit>. Only verifiable 
data may be selected for analysis. 
1.1.7)
LogFindings
<LogFindings> stores the log of the findings of the 
process, being able to point out the conformity or 
unconformity of <DocumentAnalises> in respect to 
<CriterionAudit>.  
1.1.8)
ReportRecommendation
The element <ReportRecommendation> is sent after the 
analysis of the element <LogFindings> and based on the 
unconformities that were evidenced a report containing a 
description 
of 
them, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
element 
<CriterionAudit> regarding the unconformities found and 
their degree is written.  
The degrees are divided in two, namely:  
●
Simple Degree: Simple fault that does not 
compromise the integrity of the financial report, 
but requires improvements in order to avoid 
making its usage impossible;
●
High Degree: Major fault that compromises the 
integrity of the financial report, rendering it 
unusable.
1.1.9)
PlanAction
The element <PlanAction> is set to solve possible faults 
pointed out, by attributing actions and their respective 
responsible parts that will have to monitor their completion. 
1.1.10) AuditArc 
The element <AuditArc> establishes a connection arc 
between the <Locator> and the <AuditTechnique>. 
1.1.10.1)
 Conformity 
<Conformity> is a subelement of <AuditArc>, which 
expresses the conformity level established by the 
connection between  <Locator> and <AuditTechnique>. 
V.
CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
The xAudit specification proposal has, as an objective, 
solve the shortage of auditing standards for XBRL data, 
thus contributing positively for the consolidation of the 
XBRL standard and its utilization. Important aspects in an 
auditing process can be represented in xAudit: the 
responsibilization of the auditor, definition of context, type 
and method of auditing, conformity, action management, 
among others. Continuous auditing is one of the keys to 
improve and audit business processes. The use of adequate 
technology directly influences the achievement of better 
42

results, real-time verification and accurate data analysis, in 
this case, a use of xAudit will be of great value in this task. 
xAudit creates a layer of software for representation of 
auditing processes, and with that, it is expected that 
auditing software administration can execute its processes 
in a standardized fashion. 
This work is currently still in the concept definition 
stage, the following stages will consist of the specification 
definition, creation of a taxonomy based in auditing 
regulations and xAudit, the development of an application 
that opens the doors for the executing of auditing based on 
a real case study and verifying the performance of said 
auditing.  
xAudit is a proposal for the improvement of current 
auditing processes, to be of use as a tool for the auditing 
process in XBRL-formatted files.
