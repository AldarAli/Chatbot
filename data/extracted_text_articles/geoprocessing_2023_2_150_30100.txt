INTRODUCTION
This paper presents the results of the research on prac-
tical employment of coherent multi-disciplinary contextuali-
sation and symbolic representation of worldwide Holocene-
prehistoric volcanological features and archaeological settle-
ment infrastructures. The goal of contextualisation especially
targets prehistoric contexts worldwide, identifying and inte-
grating archaeological, prehistoric objects with objects from
other scientiﬁc disciplines on equal footing, promoting a co-
herent multi-disciplinary conceptual methodological approach.
The methodological goal of this research is the creation
of practical and sustainable knowledge-based methods and
tool sets, which provide solid means for sustainable long-
term research. The methods and sets of tools should provide
standardised components, which can be continuously further
developed and adopted to future research questions and targets.
The research targets ﬂexible context processing, integra-
tion, and representation, which includes further development
of knowledge resources, visualisation, and chorological and
chronological views for analysis, interpretation, decision mak-
ing, and new insight. Two major practical reference implemen-
tations were deployed for full implementations, realisations,
and continuous further developments: The new versions of the
prehistory-protohistory and archaeology Conceptual Knowl-
edge Reference Implementation (CKRI) [1] and the Com-
ponent Reference Implementations (CRI) framework [2] for
conceptual knowledge-based context integration, complements
processing, and geoscientiﬁc visualisation. CKRI provides the
knowledge framework, including multi-disciplinary contexts of
natural sciences and humanities [3]. CRI provides the required
component groups and components for the implementation and
realisation of all the procedural modules.
The reference implementations are based on the fundamental
methodology of knowledge complements [4], considering that
many facets of knowledge, including prehistory, need to be
continuously acquired and reviewed [5]. Creating contextu-
alisation requires to coherently integrate multi-disciplinary
knowledge and to enable symbolic representations. Realisa-
tions need to integrate a wide range of components as required
from participating disciplines, e.g., for dynamical processing,
geoprocessing, spatial contextualisation.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Sections II and
III present the implementations of and conceptual knowledge
and the respective components with all required references.
Section IV provides the results to selected scenarios. Sec-
tions V and VI discuss case scenarios and summarise lessons
learned, conclusions, and future work.
II.
CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE IMPLEMENTATION
Implementations and realisations are based on the CKRI
reference implementation [6], and respective contextualisation.
References are capable to integrate required context. Besides
the core scope of this knowledge-focussed research on prehis-
toric, archaeological, and geoscientiﬁc questions, procedural
complements are employed and extended via the CRI frame
reference implementations [7]. Both provide sustainable funda-
ments for highest levels of reproducibility and standardisation.
Many aspects of knowledge [8], including meaning, can be
described using knowledge complements supporting a modern
deﬁnition of knowledge [9] and subsequent component instru-
mentation, e.g., considering factual, conceptual, procedural,
metacognitive, and structural knowledge. Complements are
a means of understanding and targeting new insight, e.g.,
enabling advanced contextualisation, integration, analysis, syn-
thesis, innovation, prospection, and documentation. Regarding
knowledge, it should be taken for granted, that scientiﬁc
members of any disciplines nowerdays continuously practice
and train themselves in development and practical employment
of methods, algorithms, and components as required by their
disciplines and keep track with how to integrate methods.

A. Coherent conceptual knowledge implementation
Universally coherent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowl-
edge is implemented via the CKRI [6], demonstrated with
Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) [10] code references,
spanning the main tables based on science and knowledge

COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS
A. Resulting methodological component integration
Integration components, reﬂecting standards and sustainable
modules are based on the major groups of the CRI. The CRI
framework is provided in development stage edition E.0.3.9.
The ten major CRI component groups are:
1)
Conceptual knowledge frameworks.
2)
Conceptual knowledge base.
3)
Integration of scientiﬁc reference frameworks.
4)
Formalisation.
5)
Methodologies and workﬂows integration.
6)
Prehistory Knowledge Resources.
7)
Natural Sciences Knowledge Resources.
8)
Inherent representation groups.
9)
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation.
10)
Structures and symbolic representation.
All parts were realised based on CRI components, with reali-
sations fully referenced in the following sections.
The conceptual knowledge was realised for all disciplines
via the CKRI conceptual knowledge framework [6] and op-
erations (Table III). CKRI is demonstrated with UDC [10]
references. For demonstration, CKRI references are illustrated
via the multi-lingual UDC summary [10] released by the UDC
Consortium, Creative Commons license [12].
Relevant scientiﬁc practices, frameworks, and standards
from disciplines and contexts are integrated with the Knowl-
edge Resources, e.g., here details regarding volcanological
features, chronologies, spatial information, and Volcanic Ex-
plosivity Index (VEI) [13]. Corresponding coherent comple-
mentary results and details on faceting are available for a whole
inventory of volcanological features groups [1].
All integration components, for all disciplines, require an
explicit and continuous formalisation [14] process. The for-
malisation includes computation model support, e.g., paralleli-
sation standards, OpenMP [15], Reg Exp patterns, e.g., Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) [16]. Here, common
scale of entities for primary objects is 103 and for secondary
objects 104–105. Processing operations [17] were parallelised
for primary (n1) features groups with respective instances.
Methodologies for creating and utilising methods include
model processing, remote sensing, spatial mapping, high in-
formation densities, and visualisation. Respective contextu-
alisation for scenarios in prehistory should be done under
conditions especially reﬂecting state-of-the-art methods, e.g.,
spatial operations, triangulation, gradient computation, and
projection.
The symbolic representation of the contextualisation can be
done with a wide range of methods, algorithms, and available
components, e.g., implemented here via LX Professional Sci-
entiﬁc Content-Context-Suite (LX PSCC Suite) deploying the
Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) [17] for visualisation.
Prehistoric objects and contexts are taken from The Prehis-
tory and Archaeology Knowledge Archive (PAKA), which is

GEOProcessing 2023 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Advanced Geographic Information Systems, Applications, and Services

in continuous development for more than three decades [18],
released by DIMF [19].
Several coherent systems of major natural sciences’ context
object groups from KR realisations have been implemented, es-
pecially Knowledge Resources (KR) focussing on volcanolog-
ical features [13] deployed with in depth contextualisation and
with a wide range [10] of contexts [20] and structures [21].
The contextualisation solution can employ state-of-the-art
results from many disciplines, e.g., context from the natural
sciences resources, integrating their inherent representation and
common utilisation, e.g., points, polygons, lines, and spatial
techniques and standards. Here, resources are Digital Elevation
Models (DEM), High Resolution (HR) (Space) Shuttle Radar
Topography Mission (SRTM) [22] data fusion [23], HR Digital
Chart of the World (DCW) [24], and Global Self-consistent
Hierarchical High-resolution Geography (GSHHG) [25].
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation of prehistoric targets can
use the overall insight from all disciplines, e.g., parametrising
algorithms and creating palaeolandscapes.
Structure is an organisation of interrelated entities in a
material or non-material object or system [21]. Here, relevant
examples of sustainable implementations are NetCDF [26]
based standards, including advanced features, hybrid structure
integration, and parallel computing support (PnetCDF).
Overall, all parts of the solution were implemented and
realised via these components. Especially, GMT modules were
deployed for select procedures together with PCRE and Perl
ﬁlters. Spatial distance dependencies of objects and conditional
decision criteria were realised via GMT geodesic calculation,
which is very accurate using the Vincenty algorithm [27].

SCENARIOS, IMPLEMENTATIONS AND RESULTS
The results for a multi-disciplinary case scenario from
the current research with two primary case instances were
choosen, Holocene-prehistoric volcanological features of strato
volcanoes and maars (CKRI: UDC:511.2...), with geospherical
calculations on a global scale and context discovery with
coherently classiﬁed archaeological settlement infrastructure
instances (CKRI: UDC:711....,692,903,902,...) in geospherical radii
of 300 km spatial distance from primary objects.
A. Methodological approach
The method can be summarised as follows.
•
Selection of KR, components, primary and secondary
object types, symbolic representation, ...
•
Conceptual knowledge assignment.
•
Selection of chronological properties.
•
Selection of primary objects.
•
Selection of secondary objects.
•
Calculation of secondary objects’ geospherical spatial
distances.
•
Parallelisation of conceptual knowledge processing.
•
Parametrisation of symbolic representation.
•
Parallelisation of context data processing.
•
Visualisation processing.
•
(Further development of resources and implementations
by the speciﬁc disciplines.)
In new applications, all steps and items should be carefully
and intentionally addressed for any intelligent employment,
depending on the research questions and contexts.
B. Resulting context groups
An excerpt of the two primary context groups and criteria
(α and β ) and contextualisation of archaeological settlement
infrastructures is shown in (Table IV).

The primary decision criteria include conceptual context,
feature object type, chronology, and position. The secondary
decision criteria include conceptual context, prehistoric object
type, chronology, position, and conditional geospherical spatial
distance depending on respective primary objects. Prehistoric
object groups include all available language representations,
e.g., ‘en’ and ‘de’. Here, the ﬁrst primary object group deﬁnes
the spatial projection for consecutive primary groups.
C. Resulting context discovery matrices
Table V shows an excerpt of the result matrix of Holocene-
prehistoric volcanological features groups and respective
facets, namely conceptual knowledge, chronology, and chorol-
ogy for the two scenarios (α and
β
in Table IV). The
result matrix includes conceptual knowledge view groups [10]
based on CKRI references [6], factual knowledge from the
Knowledge Resources objects, and respective country codes.
Context example references for the features groups facets
show Prehistoric Volcanic Activity (PVA), Historic Volcanic
Activity (HVA), and Continued Volcanic Activity (CVA), e.g.,
latent volcanic activity. PVA are consequence of the Holocene-
prehistoric chronological contextualisation for all objects in
the resulting volcanological features groups. Cases for which
further facts are holding true can also allow past-prehistoric
contextualisation, e.g., with HVA and CVA. Resulting context
discovery matrices for both primary case instances of the
scenario for multi-disciplinary contextualisation of settlements
are given in Tables VI and VII. Instances α and β refer to
Table IV. Figure 1 shows a corresponding visualisation of the
calculation results of the context discovery for both instances.

DISCUSSION OF CASE SCENARIO RESULTS
Implementation and realisation provide a seamlessly coher-
ent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge contextualisation
for the case scenario and its instances.
The context discovery result matrices (Tables VI and VII)
for the instances α and
β both refer to n2 in Table IV.
Especially, these secondary object groups include objects from
Middle Neolithic (MN) to at least Late Iron Age (LIA),
including ages in between, e.g., Bronze Age. The objects
groups comprise all types of settlement infrastructures, e.g.,
Celtic ramparts, Viereckschanzen (VS), and middens with set-
tlement contexts. The resulting group of strato volcanoes aligns
along 0 ◦/360 ◦ longitude (Figure 1). An appropriate Transverse
Mercator projection was choosen in order to minimise the
distortion along a respective meridian for the generation of
the primary results of strato volcanoes and results for other
consecutive, secondary, contextualised volcanological features,
e.g., maars. The CRI framework components were employed
for all steps, including knowledge organisation, conceptual
and spatial calculation, and visualisation. Primary objects,
strato volcano (medium green volcano symbol) and maars
(light green volcano symbol) are marked as well as resulting
secondary objects, settlements (blue rectangular symbols), all
in their precise georeferenced position. Resulting conceptual
knowledge is given for these objects. Resulting sums of
secondary discovery objects were calculated. Any case can
be dynamically contextualised with coherent multi-disciplinary
knowledge, as demonstrated for geosciences, prehistory, and
archaeology, e.g., referring to prehistoric object properties and

Any resulting contextualisation matrices and coherent con-
ceptual and faceted knowledge can further be input to con-
secutive contextualisation processes. The more, solutions with
individual methods and workﬂows can be created for countless
different questions and situations.

CONCLUSION
This research implemented and realised multi-disciplinary
contextualisation, based on employing the contextualisation
reference implementation frameworks for coherent multi-
disciplinary conceptual knowledge-spatial context discovery
achieved its goals and proved efﬁcient and sustainable. The
case scenarios for context discovery of archaeological settle-
ment infrastructures for Holocene-prehistoric volcanological
features resulted in valuable contextualisation potential and
possible insight.
The contextualisation integrates conceptual, factual, proce-
dural, structural, and metacognitive knowledge complements.
Based on the methodological approach, complements can be
identiﬁed and assigned during the contextualisation processes.
An excerpt of complements relevant for this case scenario
are CKRI classiﬁcation, position data, calculation algorithms,
content structures, and parametrisation experiences.
The methods and reference implementations can be efﬁ-
ciently and effectively employed for practical implementations
and realisations for multi-disciplinary research, especially in
prehistory, archaeology, natural sciences, and humanities. The
solutions provide countless facilities and modules for adopting
to individual solutions.
Future research will address archaeological settlement in-
frastructures and further object groups and new models for
their coherent multi-disciplinary contextualisation. Prehistoric
object groups are matter of future surveys and investigations,
e.g., context artefacts and soil characteristics, including further
integration and processing of knowledge complements, georef-
erencing, spatial and satellite data processing.
