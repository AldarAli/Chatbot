Abstract—In this paper, we propose a method for selecting a
single data collection point for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV)-enabled disaster recovery network where UAVs need to
collect messages from refugees while hovering above multiple
shelters. Just by sensing the Received Signal Strengths (RSSs) for
the wireless signals transmitted from multiple shelters at fewer
randomly-selected points in the three-dimensional (3D) region
above a disaster-hit area, through a tensor completion, the
proposed method reconstructs full RSS maps for the multiple
shelters in the entire 3D region, and selects a single data collection
point using the reconstructed RSS maps where UAVs can collect
messages from them more quickly and more energy-efﬁciently.
The experimental results reveal that by sensing RSSs in 25% of a
3D region, the proposed method can collect messages from three
transmitters using a shorter route of UAV in a shorter message
collection time.

INTRODUCTION
When a large-scale disaster causes catastrophic damage to
infrastructure and lifeline, such as roads, buildings, water, gas,
electric power and information networks, a lot of people are
dead and forced to live as refugees in shelters. The primary
concern of refugees is to let them know their families’ safety
and let their families know their safety, therefore, before the
recovery of terrestrial information network, it is essential to
quickly construct a temporary information network in the
disaster-hit area.
Since Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can quickly ﬂy
anywhere in the sky, they are promised to play an essential
in it, where UAVs, which are equipped with wireless commu-
nication tools, visit to collect messages from refugees while
hovering above shelters [1].
In the usage of UAVs, there is one serious problem, and
that is the operation time is severely limited even thanks to the
current battery technology, such as typically 20-40 minutes and
the energy consumption by ﬂying and hovering is dominant.
Therefore, when a region in a disaster-hit area is assigned to
a UAV, if there are many shelters to visit in the region, it
may be prohibitive for the UAV to visit all the shelters. In
this case, it should be better for the UAV to collect messages
from multiple shelters at a single point where the UAV can
receive the wireless signals from them simultaneously in better
channel conditions. This is also effective for enlarging the size
of region assigned to a UAV.
Let us assume that a disaster-hit area has been divided into
many three-dimensional (3D) regions. The quality of wireless
channel is proportional to Received Signal Strength (RSS),
so we believe it reasonable to divide the UAV operation into
two stages, such as RSS sensing stage and message collection
stage. In the RSS sensing stage, a UAV visits many points in
a 3D region assigned to it, and it senses the RSSs for multiple
shelters there. Then, we select the one out of the visited points
where the RSSs can be larger for the multiple shelters. In the
message collection stage, a single point has been selected for
each region in the disaster-hit area, so a single or multiple
UAVs can visit all the points according to the route solved as
a vehicle routing problem (VRP) [2]. Note that how to apply
the VRP for the UAV route planning is out of the scope of
this paper.
In the RSS sensing stage, there is one more serious prob-
lem, and that is wireless channel condition is affected by the
distribution of surrounding buildings in urban areas, so even
for a single shelter, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a good point where the
condition is better for the shelter. Furthermore, if the 3D region
is huge, it may be also prohibitive for the UAV to ﬂy fully in
the entire 3D region. Therefore, it is mandatory to develop
an efﬁcient method to select a single message collection point
even for a huge disaster-hit region.
In this paper, by dealing with the 3D-RSS spatial distribu-
tion (MAP) as a 3D tensor, we propose a tensor completion-
based selection method of a single data collection point for
multiple shelters. The use of UAV has been well discussed
in disaster recovery scenarios; a UAV-assisted network as a
substitute for terrestrial information communication network
[3], image collection [4], rescue [5] and so on. However, there
have been no works which try to select message collection
points in a UAV-enabled disaster recovery network. VRP is

applied for a UAV delivery problem [6], but it selects delivery
points in advance, although there is a lot of freedom in
selecting them.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
the models and assumptions, and Section III mathematically
states the problem. Section IV proposes three methods for
selection of the RSS sensing points and collection points of
messages, and Section V evaluates the performance of the
proposed methods using experimental data. Finally, Section
VI concludes the paper.
II.
MODELS AND ASSUMPTIONS
It is assumed that the wireless communication tool between
refugees and a UAV is Wi-Fi [7], since it has been widely and
commonly used as a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
standard over the world. However, since many Wi-Fi com-
munication links do not guarantee communication qualities,
a Wi-Fi connection may take a long time, for instance, more
than 10 sec [8], and this implies that if refugees independently
try to access the access point installed in the UAV hovering
above them, the message collection time of the UAV becomes
extremely longer. Therefore, it is also assumed that in each
shelter, there is a server which has already stored the messages
of refugees staying it. When the UAV visits a shelter, the server
tries to transmit its stored messages to the UAV by Wi-Fi. In
the following, servers are referred to as “transmitters (TXs),”
and their stored messages are simply referred to as “data.”
A. Layout model
Figure 1 shows the layout model, where there is a 3D
region of interest R, Q stationary TXs and a ﬂying UAV. The
size of R is Xm × Y m × Zm, and R is divided into N1 ×
N2 × N3 = Nv voxels with size of ΔXm × ΔY m × ΔZm,
where N1, N2 and N3 denote the number of voxels dividing
R in the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis directions, respectively. We
label the voxels with l = i + N1(j − 1) + N1N2(k − 1)
(l = 1, 2, . . . , Nv, i = 1, 2, . . . N1, j = 1, 2, . . . N2, k =
1, 2, . . . N3), deﬁne the location of the center of gravity of the
l = i+N1(j−1)+N1N2(k−1)-th voxel as Vl = [xi, yj, zk]T ,
and deﬁne the set of all Vls as V = {V1, V2, . . . , VNv}.
In addition, Q TXs are located at the outsides of R and we
deﬁne the location of the q-th TX as Sq = [Xq, Y q, Zq]T
(q = 1, 2, . . . , Q).
The UAV visits the centers of gravity of voxels to sense
RSSs for Q TXs. We deﬁne the location of the m-th visit of
UAV as Um (m = 1, 2, . . . , M), the set of all Ums as U =
{U1, U2, . . . , UM} and the sensing rate as Bsense = M/Nv.
B. Route model
In the RSS sensing stage, a realistic way is to visit
and sense RSSs only at fewer part of the voxels along a
predetermined route Ω in R. When the voxels to visit have
been selected as U, determining the shortest route for visiting
all the voxels is a kind of the 3D Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP), and there have been a lot of solvers for the TSP [9]
[10]. In this paper, therefore, we do not care about how to
determine the shortest route, namely, the “route” in this paper
naturally means the shortest route.
C. Wireless communication model
In the RSS sensing stage, Q TXs transmit their wireless
signals for UAV, and UAV tries to receive the wireless signals
from all the TXs and sense their RSSs, however, in each visit,
UAV cannot always receive the wireless signals from all the
Q TXs. We deﬁne the probability that UAV can receive the
wireless signal from the q-th TX in the m-th visit as Crec, and
deﬁne the RSS as Rq
m in dBm when it is possible.
On the other hand, in the data collection stage, after a
single data collection point has been selected, UAV collects
the data from all the TXs while hovering at the selected point.
When Wi-Fi is employed between the TXs and UAV, the data
transmission rate is an increasing function of RSS [11], for
instance, f(Rq
ˆm)bps, where ˆm is the voxel index for the data
collection point and Rq
ˆm is the RSS for the q-th TX at the
data collection point. Therefore, deﬁning the size of data for
the q-th TX as Dq bits, its required data collection time is
given by
T q
ˆm = Dq/f(Rq
ˆm).

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Selection of a single data collection point is divided into
the following two optimization problems.
A. RSS sensing stage
UAV sequentially visits U1, U2, . . . , UM, so deﬁning the
route length as Lroute, the problem is given by
ﬁnd
U = {U1, U2, . . . , UM} ⊆ V
(2)
which minimizes
Lroute =
M−1

m=1
∥Um+1 − Um∥.
(3)
B. Data collection stage
The data collection point, which is included in a subset
of V, should minimize the total data collection time, so the
problem is given by
ﬁnd
U ˆm ∈ a subset of V
(4)
which minimizes
Ttotal =
Q

q=1
T q
ˆm.
(5)
At Um, the dominant factor to determine the total data
collection time is the maximum among T 1
m, T 2
m, . . . , T Q
m, and
from (1), the data collection time is a decreasing function

of RSS. Therefore, when D1 ≈ D2 ≈ . . . ≈ DQ, deﬁning
Rmin
m
as the minimum of R1
m, R2
m, . . . , RQ
m, this problem is
reformulated as
ﬁnd
U ˆm ∈ a subset of V
(6)
ˆm = argm max
{Rmin
1
, Rmin
2
, . . . , Rmin
M }.
(7)
Once ˆm has been selected, the corresponding voxel label
can be identiﬁed. For instance, for U ˆm = [xˆi, yˆj, zˆk]T , a
distinct voxel label is given by ˆl = ˆi+N1(ˆj−1)+N1N2(ˆk−1).
IV.
SOLUTIONS
We propose the following three methods to solve the
problem.
A. Full visits and full RSS sensing
If UAV can visit all the voxels where it senses RSSs for all
the TXs, it can select the best data collection point, although
the route is maximized:
ﬁnd
U ˆm ∈ V
(8)
ˆm = argm max
{Rmin
1
, Rmin
2
, . . . , Rmin
Nv }.
(9)
We refer to this method as the Full Visit/Full RSS Sensing
(FV/FS) method. Note that the FV/FS method gives the
performance lower-bound.
B. Random visits and random RSS sensing
It is very difﬁcult to select M voxels, which gives the
shortest route. Therefore, in this paper, we randomly select M
voxels out of Nv voxels.
To formulate the problem of selecting the data collection
point, we deﬁne the set of visited voxels where UAV can sense
RSS for the q-th TX (q = 1, 2, . . . , Q):
Uq = {Um ∈ U|m = 1, 2, . . . , M, Rq
m exists}.
(10)
Furthermore, we deﬁne the set of visited voxels where UAV
can sense RSSs for all the Q TXs:
U1·2···Q =
Q

q=1
Uq.
(11)
Using (11), this problem is given by
ﬁnd
U ˆm ∈ U1·2···Q
(12)
ˆm = argm max
{Rmin
1
, Rmin
2
, . . . , Rmin
M }
(13)
where Rmin
m
is replaced by 0 when m is not included in the set
of indexes of U1·2···Q. We refer to this method as the Random
Visit/Random RSS Sensing (RV/RS) method.
C. Random visits, tensor completion and random RSS sensing
Similar to the RV/RS method, we randomly select M
voxels out of Nv voxels, but before selecting the data collection
point, we reconstruct the RSS maps for all the TXs at all the
voxels by means of a 3D tensor completion as if UAV visits
all the voxels.
We deﬁne a 3D-RSS tensor in R for the q-th TX as
Rq = {Rq
ijk|
i = 1, 2, · · · , N1,
j = 1, 2, · · · , N2, k = 1, 2, · · · , N3}.
(14)
Note that we can sense the RSSs at the voxels over the
predetemined route Ω where UAV can receive the wireless
signal from the q-th TX. Therefore, according to the Total
Variation Low Rank Tensor Completion (TVLRTC) method
[12], the reconstruction problem of a tensor Wq is given by
(q = 1, 2, . . . , Q)
Wq ={W q
ijk| i = 1, 2, · · · , N1,
j = 1, 2, · · · , N2, k = 1, 2, · · · , N3}

(17), (·)|Ωq is the operation of picking up the elements along
the predetemined route Ω where UAV can receive the wireless
signal from the q-th TX from (·) . So ﬁnally, replacing the

EXPERIMENT AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we
conducted an experiment in Osaka City University. Figure 2 (a)
shows the photo of the experiment. We placed three TXs near
the windows inside the buildings, which transmit the 2.4GHz
band Wi-Fi signals, as shown in Figures 2 (b) - (d). On the
other hand, the RSS sensing region had 3D sizes of X = 30m,
Y = 8m and Z = 10m. The experimental site is located in an
urban area, so ﬂying a UAV in the air is prohibitive. Therefore,
instead of UAV, we attached a receiver (RX) to the top of a
pole, as shown in Figure 2 (e). Dividing the sensing region
by 2m interval along the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, namely,
ΔX = ΔY = ΔZ = 2m, N1 = 15, N2 = 4, and N3 = 5,
we sensed the RSSs for the TXs at each voxel in total Nv =
300 voxels. In addition, we set the RSS sensable probability
Crec = 0.6. TABLE I shows the speciﬁcations of experiment.
Figure 3 compares the fully sensed RSS map by the FV/FS
method, the randomly selected RSS map by the RV/RS method

and the reconstructed RSS map by the RV/TC/RS method, for
the three TXs, respectively, when setting the RSS sensing ratio
Bsense of 0.25 (= 75/300, M = 75) and λ = 0.07 [13]. Since
the RSS sensable probability is set as Crec = 0.6, the RSSs
for TX#1, TX#2 and TX#3 are sensed only at 48 voxels, 43
voxels and 47 voxels out of 75 voxels, respectively, but we can
see that the RSS maps can be accurately reconstructed by the
tensor completion. Deﬁning the Relative Square Error (RSE)
of reconstructionfor the q-th TX as
RSEq = ||Rq − Wq||F
||Rq||F
(21)
where ||(·)||F denotes the Frobenius norm of tensor (·), we
obtain RSE1 = 0.06, RSE2 = 0.03, and RSE3 = 0.05.
We have set Bsense = 0.25 and λ = 0.07 to show the
RSS maps in Figure 3, but Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the
dependencies of RSEq on Bsense and λ, respectively. We can
see that RSEq becomes ﬂat when Bsense is more than 0.2 and
also it becomes ﬂat when λ is more than 0.07.
Figure 6 compares the total route length among the FV/FS,
RV/RS, and RV/TC/RS methods when setting Bsense = 0.25
and λ = 0.07. We can see that as compared with the FV/FS
method, the RV/RS and the RV/TC/RS method can reduce the
total route length by around 60%.
Finally, to compare the total data collection time among
the three methods, according to the data sheet of Xbee Wi-Fi,
we deﬁne f(Rq

three TXs, so the selected voxels cannot give higher RSSs,
resulting in a much longer data collection time. On the other
hand, as the clue of the RSSs for the fewer selected voxels,
the RV/TC/RS method can reconstruct the RSS maps for the
three TXs almost perfectly through the tensor completion as
if the UAV senses the RSSs fully in the entire 3D region. We
can see that there is no difference in the total data collection
time between the FV/FS method and the RV/TC/RS method.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed the tensor completion-
based method for selecting a single data collection point for
multiple transmitters in a UAV-enabled disaster recovery net-
work. The experimental results have shown that the RV/TC/RS
method can select the truly best data collection giving the
shortest data collection time by sensing the RSSs in 25% of
the 3D region.
We have randomly selected a fewer RSS sensing points
and simply connected them with a short route, so our future
work includes the selection of RSS sensing points which
can be connected with the shortest route while keeping the
MAP reconstruction accuracy the highest. In addition, we have
discussed a single data collection point selection, so another of
our future works is to select multiple but less data collection
points for multiple transmitters.
