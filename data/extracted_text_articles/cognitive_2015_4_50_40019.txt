Abstract— The authors measured electroencephalograms 
(EEGs) from subjects when recalling several types of images. 
Each image presented consisted of four types of line drawings 
of body parts. During these experiments, the electrodes were 
fixed on the scalp of the subjects. However, recorded EEGs 
had multiple components, including muscle and brain poten-
tials. Recently, independent component analysis (ICA) has 
been used for EEG analysis. ICA is a technical method for 
solving the so-called “cocktail party problem”. We applied 
ICA to single-trial EEGs for preprocessing to obtain actual 
brain activity, and then attempted to estimate spatiotemporal 
brain activity using equivalent current dipole source localiza-
tion (ECDL). Our results were almost identical with previous 
results using ECDL analysis on event Related Potentials 
(ERPs). In this paper, we present experiments suggesting that 
ICA is effective as a preprocessing method for estimation of 
spatiotemporal brain activity using the ECDL and three-dipole 
model.

 INTRODUCTION 
According to research on the human brain, the primary 
processing of a visual stimulus occurs in V1 and V2 in the 
occipital lobe. Initially, a stimulus presented to the right 
visual field is processed in the left hemisphere and a stimu-
lus presented to the left visual field is processed in the right 
hemisphere. Next, processing moves on to the parietal asso-
ciative areas [1].  
Higher order processing in the brain is associated with 
laterality. For example, Wernicke’s area and the Broca’s 
area are located in the left hemisphere in 99% of right-
handed people and 70% of left-handed people [2, 3]. Lan-
guage is also processed in the angular gyrus (AnG), the 
fusiform gyrus (FuG), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and 
the prefrontal area (PFA) [4].  
Using equivalent current dipole localization (ECDL) 
techniques [5] applied to summed and averaged electroen-
cephalograms (EEGs), we previously reported that ECDs 
can be localized to the right middle temporal gyrus, and 
estimated in areas related to working memory for spatial 
perception, such as the right inferior or the right middle 
frontal gyrus for input stimulus of arrow symbols. Further, 
using Chinese characters as stimulus, ECD were also local-
ized to the prefrontal area and the precentral gyrus [6 - 10].  
To improve the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, generally 
single-trial EEG data are summed and averaged. This results 
in event related potentials (ERPs). When using such a meth-
od, the experiment should be repeated many times to gain 
accurate data. However, many repetitions can cause subject 
fatigue.  
Recently, independent component analysis (ICA) [11] 
has been used to analyze acoustic and EEG data. ICA is a 
mathematical concept used to solve a problem, for example 
where a number of people are talking simultaneously in a 
room, and a listener is trying to follow a discussion (cocktail 
party problem). The human brain can solve this auditory 
source separation problem, but it is a complex problem for 
digital signal processing. 
Moreover, EEGs used in brain research contain external 
sources of electric magnetic fields and/or muscle potentials 
from eye blinks of the subject for example.  
In this paper, we used ICA to process single-trial EEGs, 
and attempted to remove artifacts from the subject’s head 
movements. If effective, then the number of EEG measure-
ment trials could be reduced significantly, that would reduce 
fatigue of the subject. Furthermore, as we have been using 
EEGs in a brain-computer interface (BCI) experiment in our 
laboratory, the use of ICA processing may increase discrim-
ination accuracy. 
To confirm the efficiency of ICA, we used an ECDL 
method for single-trial EEGs after application of ICA [11]. 
We compared these results with our previous results using 
ECDL on ERPs [12]. 
In section II, the ICA methodology is detailed. In section 
III, preprocessing of EEGs using ICA is described. In sec-
tion IV, results of one dipole analysis using the ECDL 
method after ICA are shown. In section V, results of three- 
dipole analysis using the ECDL method after ICA are 
shown. In Section VI the results are discussed.

II. 
INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS 
First, we consider unknown n signals generated from in-
dependent signal sources 
 
 s1(t), s2(t),  … , sn(t), 
(1) 
and n measured signals that are linearly mixed with the  
original sources 
 
 x1(t), x2(t),  … , xn(t). 
(2) 
Supposing that a linear relationship with a matrix A, 
which is independent of time, is  

x(t) = As(t). 
(3) 
 
It is assumed that the original sources are connected line-
arly to the signals by a matrix A, as in (3). The purpose of 
ICA is to separate the signals into n independent components 
without knowledge of the matrix A, under the assumption of 
independence of s(t). If a real matrix W exists, then by the 
following equation  

y(t) = Wx(t), 
(4) 

the original signal can be recovered by reconstructing mutu-
ally independent y(t). If WA = I holds then, y(t) coincides 
with s(t), where I is a unit matrix. However, the equation WA 
= PD is acceptable, because the order of the signals does not 
affect the isolation of the components of y(t), where P is a 
matrix with one single row to each column and D is a diago-
nal matrix. Under one of the definitions of independence of 
signals, we determine W so that cost is minimized for one of 
the cost functions defined elsewhere.  
This is the so-called “the cocktail party problem”, a 
mathematical treatment of the effect of discerning the voice 
of interest from background noise. 
III. 
PREPROCESSING OF EEGS BY ICA  
In this study, we used the ICA analysis tool ICALAB  
(RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan) for single-trial EEG 
preprocessing (Figure 1), which is implemented in 
MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The algorithm 
we used was Fixed-Point ICA, where correspondence of the 
input and output is held. For EEG data from 19ch, based on 
the international 10-20 system, ICALAB is able to obtain the 
independent components and reconstructs the measured EEG 
data. In this study, we extracted 19ch component data on 
ICALAB, an then obtained 19ch EEG data (y1, y2,  …, y19) 
on the basis of the independent components.   
Furthermore, as the Fixed-Point ICA generates results for 
y1–y19 corresponding to the original 19ch EEG data, we 
applied the ECDL method to results from ICA to obtained 
ECDs, and then compared these using a three-dipole model 
and one-dipole model. 
IV. 
ONE-DIPOLE MODEL OF ECDL                                    
AFTER PREPROCESSING WITH ICA 
With regard to the EEG data in the present paper, we 
compared estimated results of the present study with that of 
our previous results using the ECDL method [12]. Figure 2 
shows an example of ERPs obtained from our previous re-
search. The estimated results from multiple brain areas ac-
cording to latency are shown in Table I. An example of sin-
gle-trial EEG data is shown in Figure 3, while an example of 
a single-trial EEG signal processed by ICA is shown in Fig-
ure 4. 
After preprocessing by ICA, we analyzed the data using 
the one-dipole ECDL method, and compared the results with 
Table 1. According to ECD, coincident activity was ob-
served in V1, the posterior central gyrus (PstCG) and the 
parahippocampus. However, the ICA results revealed no 
coincident activity estimated in language areas; i.e., Broca’s 
area and Wernicke’s area, and the fusiform gyrus, which is 
involved in cognition. In addition, the goodness of fit (GOF), 
an evaluation criterion of the estimated results used in the 
ECDL method, did not reach 99%.

In a preanalysis using the one-dipole ECDL method, we 
found partial concurrence with our previous results [8]. 
Figure 4 shows an example of estimated ECDs using the 
one-dipole ECDL method. Two cases are shown, one with 
disparsed ECDs and the other with concentrated ECDs.

To improve estimation accuracy, we applied ICA to a 
partial data, one half (from 1 to 1000 ms) and one forth 
(from 1 to 500 ms, and from 501 to 1000 ms). By narrowing 
the range of latency, the estimated brain parts were increased, 
but the GOFs were not improved.  
V. 
APPLICATION OF A THREE-DIPOLE MODEL OF ECDL 
AFTER PREPROCESSING USING ICA 
Next, we attempted to estimate spatiotemporal brain ac-
tivity using a three-dipole model, which is more accurate 
than a one-dipole method, to reconstruct data from y1–y19 
using ICA. In addition, considering the recording of ERPs in 
Figure 2, we modified the analysis range of latency from 
2000 to 1000 ms. Figure 3 shows an example of the results 
applied to y1, among reconstructed data using ICA from y1–
y19. In Figure 3, the sign and ratio is significant in the y axis. 
In addition, Table II shows estimated results of brain areas 
according to latency. In Table III, we compared the estimat-
ed result of each channel y1–y19 with previous results shown 
in Table I [8]. Coincident areas are shown in Table III.

DISCUSSION 
In the present study, we compared results from an ECDL 
three-dipole method to single-trial EEG data, after applying 
ICA, with results using a similar ECDL method to ERPs.  
As shown in TABLE III, our estimated results were al-
most identical with that of our previous research. However, 
the new estimated results different in that there were brain 
areas that were lost in our previous ERP data analyses. 
We conclude that ICA is effective as a pre-processing 
method for estimation using ECDL with a three-dipole mod-
el. Moreover, changing the latency range from 0–2000 ms to 
0–1000 ms improved the results. These findings suggest that 
dividing the latency range more precisely may obtain better 
preprocessing results using ICA for the ECDL three-dipole 
method used here.
