Abstract—Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit 
electromagnetic radiation at regular intervals and can be used 
for navigation and for detection of meteoroids and asteroids. 
The detection of a pulsar signal for a short time (in real time) is 
difficult because the signals are very weak. In this paper, we 
develop a detection algorithm, which includes three basic 
stages: moving average filter with a jumping window, Hough 
transform and detector. The algorithm proposed in the paper 
was verified with pulsar signals from Jodrell Bank Centre for 
Astrophysics.

processing, moving average filter with a jumping window 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Pulsars are fast rotating neutron stars (see Figure 1) that 
periodically emit broadband electromagnetic pulses [1]. The 
emission period is thought to be the same as the rotation 
period. Although individual pulsar pulses vary in strength 
and shape, the average pulse shape is stable and 
characterizes each pulsar.

The idea of using pulsars, rapidly rotating neutron stars, 
for orientation in space is not new [2]-[4]. It is similar to the 
oldest idea - navigation of ships centuries ago through 
observation of the visible stars with sextants and using the 
star and sea charts. This approach is similar, but the 
difference is in the reception of radio signals instead the 
light emission of stars.  
A similar approach for navigation by satellites is in 
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). This requires 
to search very specific, fast and effective methods and 
algorithms for detection and estimation of their parameters.  
Earlier, the practical realization of the idea of space 
navigation was difficult, first, the insufficient number of 
known pulsars, and secondly - sophisticated technology to 
detect them. But in recent years, the situation has changed 
significantly. Since the discovery of the first pulsar in 1967, 
approximately 2100 pulsars have been found.  
The pulsar signal can be used also for observation and 
detection of falling cosmic objects as asteroids and 
meteoroids [14]. This information would be useful in 
creating early warning systems. 
The main difficulty in detecting a signal from the pulsar 
by radio telescopes is the low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) 
at the receiver input (from -40 dB to -90 dB). Another 
difficulty in the study of the pulsars is a great consumption 
of time needed for detecting the signal from them, about 1-2 
hours [5]-[11], [15]. 
Since each pulsar has a unique period, in [4] is applied 
epoch folding algorithm to shape the pulsar pulse, remove 
noise, and find the pulsar. Folding is similar to integration 
except that in folding, the data is broken into a sequence of 
discrete intervals corresponding to the period of the 
expected pulsar and then added (or folded) ensuring that the 
pulsar signal is reinforced with each fold, while the noise 
approaches a mean zero. The epoch folding method is 
convenient, but the integration time is too much. It is equal 
to the number of period of repetition of the signal from the 
pulsar multiplied by the length of the period. 
In [5] it is discussed the possibility to improve the signal 
to noise ratio by using Moving Average Filter with a Jumping 
Window (MAFJW) in time domain signal. As a result of this 
processing, the number of samples in the record will be 
reduced in proportion to the number of cells in jumping 
window. The small number of samples will increase the 
further signal processing. 
In this paper, we propose the use of Hough transform as 
method for detecting of pulsar pulse sequence. This 
algorithm is tested over real pulsar signals. In the previous 
works, the Hough Transform is used to detect straight lines 
in image. This transformation is also used in algorithms for 
detecting of target and trajectories of moving targets [13], 
[16]. In this paper, we offer an unconventional approach to

detecting pulsar signal using Hough transform. In the further 
work will be evaluated the efficiency of the proposed 
algorithm. 
Section 2 describes the algorithm for signal processing. 
Section 3 discusses the experimental results. Finally, section 
4 draws conclusions based on the obtained results. 
II. SIGNAL PROCESSING 
The considered algorithm of signal processing of the 
pulsar signals experimental data is shown in Figure 2. It 
includes the following stages: filtration by the MAFJW; 
Hough transform and, finally detector.

A. Filtering by the MAFJW 
The aim of this study is to examine the possibility to 
increase the signal to noise ratio of the received pulsar signal 
by means of one modification of a Moving Average Filter, 
which uses the Jumping Window (MAFJW). It takes N 
samples of input at a time and take the average of those N-
samples and produces a single output point. It is a very 
simple structure that comes handy for scientists and 
engineers to filter an unwanted noisy component from the 
input data.  

, n=N+1, 2N+1,.., MN+1   
Where n contrary to the traditional Moving Average Filter 
(MAF) where the number of output samples is equal to the 
number of input samples, the MAFJW reduces the number 
of output samples N times, where N is the length of the 
Jumping Window. The number of input samples is MN, and 
the number of output samples is M. Therefore in contrary to 
the traditional Moving Average window, the MAFJW acts 
not only as a low-pass filter but a decimator as well. When 
the signal processing is carried out in the time domain, the 
use of the MAFJW can be very useful in the sense of 
reducing the processing time.  
B. Hough Transform 
The standard Hough transform and the related Radon 
transform have received much attention in recent years [13]. 
Using them makes possible the transformation of two-
dimensional images with lines into a domain of possible line 
parameters, where each image line corresponds to a peak, 
positioned at the respective line parameters. For these 
reasons, many line detection applications appeared within the 
image processing, computer vision, and seismic research 
areas. The use of the standard Hough transform (SHT) for 
target detection and track determination in white Gaussian 
noise is introduced by Carlson, Evans and Wilson in [12]. 
The standard Hough transform maps points from trajectory 
of the observation space termed as range-time 
r  t
 data 
space into curves in Hough parameter space. The trajectory 
from the observation space can be defined by the angle   of 
its perpendicular from the origin and the distance   from the 
origin to the line along the perpendicular.  


where r  and t  are coordinates measured from the origin of 
  and   axis in the lower left. The result of transformation 
is a sinusoid with magnitude and phase depending on the 
value of the point in range-time 
r  t
 space.  
Each point in the Hough parameter space corresponds to 
one 
straight 
line 
in 
the 
r  t
 space 
with 
two 
parameters
,  
. Each of the sinusoids corresponds to a set 
of possible straight lines through the point. If a straight line 
exists in the 
r  t
 space, by means of the Hough transform 
it can be viewed as a point of intersection of sinusoids 
defined by the Hough transform. The parameters   and   
define the linear trajectory in the Hough parameter space, 
which could be transformed back to the 
r  t
 space 
showing the current distance to the target.  
C. Detection algorithm 
The detection algorithm is based on threshold processing 
of the cells in the Hough parametric space [13]. According 
to this algorithm, we tested a simple hypothesis H1 (pulsar 
signal is present) against a simple alternative H0 (pulsar 
signal is absent). Each cell from the Hough parameter space 
is intersected by a limited set of sinusoids obtained by 
Hough transform. If the number of intersections in any of 
the cells in the parameter space exceeds a fixed threshold 
(TM), pulsar signal detection is indicated.

RESULTS  
In this study, the experimental records of the signal 
received from the pulsar B0329+54 provided by Jodrell 
Bank Centre for Astrophysics are used. This is the brightest 
radio pulsar in the northern sky. Otherwise this pulsar is a 
typical, normal pulsar, rotating with a period of 0.714520 
seconds, hence the star makes about one and a half turn in a 
second, giving it a locomotive kind of sound. We can see in 
Figure 3 that each pulse has a different structure, hence the 
beam of this cosmic lighthouse is constantly changing in 
shape. This recording has been made with the Lovell 
telescope in Jodrell Bank. 
The signal in Figure 3 is obtained after signal processing 
procedure which is about 2 hours. When the SNR is about - 
20 dB, the pulsar signal will be as in Figure 4. The 
representation of the pulse signal in a matrix so that each 
pulse period is in a separate order is shown in Figure 5.

(MAFJW), the output SNR increases. The filter output for 
length of the jumping window N=100 is shown in Figure 6. 
The contour of the MAFJW output is shown in Figure 7. In 
the Figure 8 is shown Binary integration of data in Hough 
parameter space. If the number of binary integrations (BI) of 
data in the Hough parameter space (of intersections in any 
of the cells in the parameter space) exceeds the detection 
threshold, then pulsar signal is detect.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The obtained results show that the presented algorithm can 
be successfully used for processing and detection of pulsar 
signals. The signals from pulsars are very weak and difficult to 
detect. The SNR can be improved using the Moving Averaging 
Filter with a Jumping window. The pulsar signals are 
periodic with a highly stable pulse-repetition frequency 
allowing the pulse signal to form a straight line in the 
computer space. The Hough transform is a popular tool for 
line detection due to its robustness to noise and missing data.  
The presence of the Hough transform further enhances the 
detection of the pulsar signal. In the next work, the efficiency 
of the proposed algorithm will be evaluated.
