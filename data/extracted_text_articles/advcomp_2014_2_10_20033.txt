Abstract—Based on the Takagi Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model of DC 
series motor, an integral controller is designed for controlling 
its speed. The nonlinear plant is converted into regional fuzzy 
models for which the control gains are found through a set of 
linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The local fuzzy controllers 
are 
blended 
afterwards 
through 
parallel 
distributed 
compensation scheme to yield the final control law. MATLAB 
simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the 
designed controller.

 INTRODUCTION 
DC series motor is constructed by placing the field circuit 
in series wit the armature circuit and is therefore a popular 
choice for wide variety of applications which require high 
torques at low speeds such as electric traction applications 
[1]-[3]. The mathematical model of this motor is nonlinear 
due to a square law relationship between the torque it 
produces and the current supplied to it. Another source of 
nonlinearity is the product of current and speed which 
constitutes the back EMF. The model can be linearized for 
small range of operation. However, the dynamic operation 
requires the nonlinear model for designing the motor 
controller. 
A variety of nonlinear control methods have been 
reported in literature for the speed control of dc series motors 
[4]-[15]. The use of feedback linearization technique is 
reported in [4]. Through nonlinear state transformation, a 
linear control law is designed to regulate the speed of the 
motor. A nonlinear observer for speed and load torque is also 
constructed based on the current measurements. The real 
time results of the proposed approach are also presented. 
Another nonlinear control method known as back stepping is 
employed in [8] to control the speed of dc series motor. By 
introducing the virtual control inputs in a recursive fashion, 
the control Lyapunov functions are found. An improved 
version of this method is reported in [9] for achieving better 
transient performance. 
The model free techniques such as fuzzy logic and neural 
networks have also been used for the control of dc series 
motors [10]-[13]. A PID-ANN controller in [10] acquires 
training data from a conventional PID controller and the 
trained controller drives the dc motor through a chopper. The 
controller is also implemented in real time using an 80C51 
microcontroller. A rule base fuzzy logic controller is 
described in [11] which employs speed and current 
controllers for dc series motor. Both the controllers accept 
error and change in error from the set points as inputs and 
generate the firing signals for thyristors after evaluating 49 
rules in the rule base. The performance of the designed fuzzy 
scheme shows improvement compared with classical PI 
control strategy. The power of fuzzy logic controller for 
speed of dc series motors is presented in [12] where a simple 
fuzzy logic controller with a single input and single output is 
shown to perform better than PI controller. 
This paper describes model based fuzzy control of dc 
series motor. Using Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modeling 
approach, the nonlinear terms in the mathematical model are 
translated as fuzzy sets which yield a number of local linear 
models. A set of local controllers corresponding to these 
models are obtained after solving a set of LMIs which also 
guarantee the global stability of the control scheme. 
MATLAB simulations are performed to show the validity of 
the designed controller. The contribution of the paper lies in 
the design of integral fuzzy disturbance rejection controller 
for DC series motor with an objective to improve the 
transient performance of the system when load torque is 
changing frequently. The proposed controller clearly 
performs better than the pole placement state feedback 
controller as evident from the simulation results. 
We start by developing the TS fuzzy model of DC series 
motor in Section II. Controller design is presented in Section 
III followed by results in Section IV. Conclusions are drawn 
in Section V.

’ 
by rejecting the jumping load torque disturbances. The

In order to find the control gains ‘
i
K
∼
’ for the local fuzzy 
models, we impose certain performance constraints [15]. 
First, the controller should be able to minimize the effect of 
jumping load torque disturbances on the speed profile of the 
DC series motor i.e., ‘γ ’in the following inequality needs to 
be minimized:

Second, the controller should provide good transient 
performance for disturbance rejection and reference tracking 
tasks. Thus, the states should decay at a rate ‘α ’ which 
requires the derivative,

RESULTS 
The 
designed 
controller 
is 
simulated 
in 
MATLAB/Simulink 
environment 
for 
various 
speed 
references and load torques. For a reference speed of 
80rad/sec and load torque of 50Nm, the simulation results 
are shown in Fig. 3. With the same load torque applied, the 
controller is made to track a set of reference speeds 
({90,100,110} rad/sec) while motor is already running at 
80rad/sec. The results for this case are shown in Fig. 4. Then 
a sequence of jumping load torques ({60,70,80}Nm) are 
applied while the motor is running at reference speed of 100 
rad/sec with initial load torque of 50Nm. The controller is 
able to reject the load torque disturbances as evident from 
Fig. 5.  
From the simulation results, the settling time for the 
controller is found to be 0.72 sec. The deviation from the 
reference speed is recorded to be 0.36 rad/sec when the load 
torque disturbance is applied in steady state and is rejected in 
0.64 sec by the two rule fuzzy controller. The ripples in the 
current are limited to ± 0.4A of the actual value during 
steady state. 
The ripples in the current and voltage can be reduced by 
employing a larger rule base controller which implies the 
need of using more membership functions covering the 
universe of discourse. 
The proposed TS FLC is also compared with pole 
placement controller (PPC). The pole placement controller is 
designed based on averaged system model for the same 
transient specifications (
0.72 ,

s ξ

). The second 
order desired characteristic equation is therefore formed as:

=
. The third pole is placed 20 times 
farther than the dominant closed loop poles. The comparison 
of TS-FLC and PPC for a reference speed of 50rad/sec is 
shown in Fig. 7. It can be observed that PPC shows both 
undershoot and overshoot while tracking the set speed. 
However, no overshoot is seen in case of TS-FLC. The 
rejection of load torque disturbances ({60,70,80}Nm) by 
both the controllers is shown in Fig. 7 while the motor is 
running at a reference speed of 50 rad/sec. The deviation in 
speed is found to be less in case of TS-FLC as compared to 
PPC.

CONCLUSIONS 
A simple two rule TS fuzzy model of the DC series 
motor is constructed followed by a two rule integral 
controller which shares the same premise membership 
functions as that of model. The control gains are determined 
through a set of LMIs which guarantee the closed loop 
stability of the system for fuzzy regions. The performance of 
the controller is evaluated through simulation runs in 
MATLAB environment for various reference speeds and 
load torque disturbances. Future work involves the design of 
type-2 fuzzy logic controller.
