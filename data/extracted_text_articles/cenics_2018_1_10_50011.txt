Abstract—This paper expands Ultra-Low-Voltage Dual-Rail (UL-
VDR) technology to 2-input logic gates. While previous research
has been focused on inverters, it is important to investigate and
demonstrate the function and speed of ULVDR in bigger, more
complex circuits. ULVDR offers a signiﬁcant speed increase over
the more traditional Cascode Voltage Switch Logic (CVSL). Using
the industry standard 90 nm CMOS process and a supply voltage
of 300 mV, ULVDR NAND gates are more than 50 times faster
than CVSL, when comparing chain evaluation delay.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 30 years, electronics have become faster,
cheaper and much more prevalent. This has pushed the industry
towards smaller devices with lower supply voltage, as well as
power consumption. As feature sizes approach a few atoms in
length, further miniaturization becomes impossible.
Wearables, as well as smaller smart / Internet of Things
(IoT) devices, are becoming much more common. All these
devices can be powered by batteries and/or various means of
energy harvesting. Either way the circuits need to be energy
efﬁcient and possibly operate at lower supply voltages. Within
energy harvesting the supply voltage domain ranges from
175 mV to 350 mV, which is often referred to as Ultra low
Voltage. Exploring alternate circuit topologies is the most ac-
cessible way to reduce supply voltage and power consumption
while maintaining speed. New circuit topologies can be manu-
factured using existing factories and technology are favorable.
Completely new ways to build computers inspired by biology
or quantum physics are still far away from competing with the
silicon electronics industry.
A prominent new logic style which builds on CMOS [1],
CVSL [2] and domino logic [3], namely the ULVDR inverter,
is stated to be 25 times faster than traditional dual rail clocked
CVSL [4]. Our work in this paper contributes to the ﬁeld
of Ultra Low Voltage (300 mV) and is based on the design
logic presented in [4]. In this paper, we present a ULVDR
NAND/NOR gate.
The content of this paper is as follows: In Section II, we
introduce the ultra low voltage dual rail CVSL logic style.
The ULVDR NAND/NOR gates with transistor details are
discussed in Section III with the simulation verifying the logic
is presented in Section IV. In Section IV-D, we compare our
design to a CVSL gate with the simulation environment of a
chain. Finally, a conclusion is included in Section V.

ULTRA LOW VOLTAGE DUAL RAIL LOGIC
A ULVDR precharge to 1 (0P1) inverter is shown in
Figure 1. (A 0P1 gate has low voltage on inputs and high
voltage on outputs, during precharge). At 300 mV, the delay
of a ULVDR inverter has been demonstrated to be 7% of the
CVSL inverter delay [4].

During precharge:
When ϕ is high, the inverter is in precharge and not
evaluation. Recharge transistors set all ﬂoating gates to their
active state, such that both precharge (P) and evaluation
(E) transistors are conducting. The output is brought to
the precharge voltage, 300 mV for 0P1 and 0 mV for 1P0.
Keeper(K) transistors do not play a signiﬁcant role during
precharge.
During evaluation:
When ϕ is low, the inverter is in evaluation. Recharge
transistors are turned off, allowing the gate nodes of precharge
(P) and evaluation (E) transistors to ﬂoat. This is called a
ﬂoating gate. When the input rising edge arrives, capacitive
coupling causes the evaluation transistors ﬂoating gate to be
supercharged, achieving voltages outside 0 ≤ VGS ≤ 300 mV.

The output switches quickly, and the keeper (K) transistors dis-
charge the ﬂoating gate, turning the evaluation and precharge
transistors which should not be conducting completely off.
For example, on a precharge to 1 inverter, a gate voltage,
VGS ≈ 550 mV allows the output to quickly transition to 0.
Digital circuits limited to gate voltages within 0 ≤ VGS ≤
300 mV, like CVSL and CMOS, are much slower as the
transistors are only weakly conducting in this sub-threshold
state. At 300 mV, the delay of a ULVDR inverter has been
demonstrated to be 7% of the CVSL inverter delay [4].

NAND GATES
A. CVSL NAND gate
CVSL technology is used for comparison. Figure 2 shows a
static CVSL NAND. At 300 mV, the CVSL has similar speed
to a static CMOS.

Figure 2. Static CVSL NAND used for comparison
In CVSL, when the input(s) arrive, one pull-down nMOS
network is active. This pulls the output down to low, which in
turn activates the pull-up pMOS transistor of the other output.
As the other output goes high, the pMOS transistor of the
ﬁrst output is turned off, eliminating static power consumption.
After some amount of time, an evaluation delay, one pull-down
nMOS network is active, and the other pull-up pMOS transistor
is active.
Sizes used for CVSL NAND gates are shown in Table I.
Transistors are sized using W/L = 120 nm/240 nm, ﬁnger
count, N = 1 with exceptions listed in Table I. n and p
are used to specify nMOS and pMOS transistors. ∥ and s
are used for sizes applying to parallel and series transistors,
respectively. This circuit was simulated for all possible input
combinations, and average delays were computed. tdfµ and
tdrµ are the average delays (falling and rising edge on output).
Note that the rising edge is much slower than the falling edge,
due to the relatively weak pull-up pMOS.
B. ULVDR NAND
A ULVDR NAND gate was created based on the CVSL
NAND (Figure 2) and ULVDR Inverter (Figure 1). The evalu-
ation transistors were substituted by parallell(∥) and series(s)
evaluation resistors. The precharge circuitry was duplicated to
accomodate for the two ﬂoating gate inputs. Figure 3 shows
both versions of the ULVDR NAND/NOR gate.

When designing ULVDR gates and setting transistor di-
mensions it is important to consider the state of the circuit once
evaluation starts. Before the inputs arrive, all precharge and
evaluation transistors are active, with gate to source voltages,
|VGS| ≈ 300 mV. Thus, the output will be pulled by the
evaluation networks away from the precharge value. It is
important to dimension precharge and evaluation transistors
to be at equilibrium around 90% of the precharge value. This
was done by Mirmotahari, Dadashi, Azadmehr, et al. in [4]
and those sizes are used as a starting point. As the ULVDR
inverter has symmetric rails (sides) it is enough to do one such
matching per circuit.

For the ULVDR NAND/NOR gate, each rail is different
and requires separate matching. Series evaluation transistors
are doubled in size (ﬁnger count, N) to account for increased
series resistance. Precharge transistors connected to parallel
evaluation transistors are also doubled, to account for the
increased parallel conductance. New transistor dimensions
can be found in Table II. Recharge and keeper transistors
are minimum sizes, but can be scaled according to timing
requirements.

SIMULATION
A. Logic veriﬁcation
Figure 4 shows the NAND gate response to a binary
counting sequence. Stimuli sequence 00, 01, 10, 11 produces
the familiar NAND response; 1, 1, 1, 0. A1, B1 and X1 are
the noninverted signals, A2, B2 and X2 are their respective
compliments.
The transient in Figure 5 shows the evaluation transistor
ﬂoating gate voltage, FGA1, quickly jump when the input
arrives. It peaks at 565.44 mV allowing the nMOS transistors
to rapidly pull the output down to 0.
B. Parasitic delay
Using identical inputs, and ideal clock and voltage sources,
parasitic delays were simulated. Delay was measured from
input switches to output switches (50% to 50%). Another gate

When using ideal inputs and supply (300 mV) the ULVDR
gates have parasitic delays ranging from 32.1 ps to 178.0 ps.
The average parasitic delay for ULVDR NAND gates is
approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than for CVSL.
These ideal characteristics are useful for comparison, but not
realistic - Section IV-D shows a better delay estimate, using
chain delay.
C. Monte Carlo simulation
A 200 sample Monte Carlo Sweep was run to show the
effects of mismatch and process parameters (variance). The
results for both CVSL and ULVDR NAND gates are shown
in Figure 6. Both plots are on the same time scale.
D. Chain delay
In Section IV-B, parasitic delay was estimated. An ideal
input signal gives lower parasitic delay than what you can
expect in a real circuit. A more realistic delay can be estimated
using a chain of NAND gates. In this conﬁguration the NAND
gates act as inverters. There are 2 logic states, either the input
(and ouptut) is low, or high. As there are 2 versions of the
ULVDR gate the delays for these states differ.
Figures 7 and 8 show transients from the chain delay sim-
ulations. Two cases were simulated, 00 → 11 and 11 → 00.

CONCLUSION
The CVSL NAND gates achieve an average (per gate)
delay of 9.658 ns and 9.738 ns. (For the two simulation cases
mentioned in Section IV-D.) The ULVDR NAND chain has a

The chain test in Section IV indicates that ULVDR NAND
gates can be more than 50 times faster than static CVSL
NAND gates. The tradeoff is the complexity and size in silicon,
especially when considering necessary clock and precharge
circuits. This paper does not consider power usage, layout,
clock drivers, etc. Further research is needed to completely
characterize the ULVDR NAND gate and the differences be-
tween ULVDR and CVSL in terms of power, speed, robustness,
area, etc.
