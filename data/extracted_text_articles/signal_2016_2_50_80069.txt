Abstract—This paper presents a detailed analysis of the impact of
channel impairments on the performance of a mm-Wave wireless
uncoded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
architecture system based on IEEE 802.15.3c standard, for high
data-rate applications. The performance of OFDM is known to
be severely affected by multipath fading channel when its excess
delay exceeds the time guard interval of the OFDM symbol.
Hence, this paper analyses the impact of uncompressed Full
HD video content transmission over various radio propagation
environments suggested by the standard. The impact of the prop-
agation channel impairments is evaluated through appropriate
metrics based on Bit Error Rate (BER) and Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) analysis for residential, ofﬁce and kiosk scenarios
under Line-Of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS). The
feasibility of real-time high-deﬁnition video transmission using
60 GHz radio systems will be demonstrated through a proof-of-
concept test, which will allow one to perfectly understand the
system limitations, and consequently the range of applications
that might be developed.

INTRODUCTION
Communication systems at 60 GHz have recently attracted
a great deal of interest allowing multi-gigabit transmission
rates. However, radio communications at these frequencies are
characterized to yield high free space path losses and thus
limited radio coverage. Hence, the target applications or usage
models at 60 GHz are mainly short-range indoor applications
[1]. In fact, this is an advantage for indoor applications, since
the high free space loss in addition to high attenuation by walls,
furniture and other objects increases the possible frequency re-
use density [2]. Therefore, co-channel interference is reduced
and, consequently, it enables a more simpliﬁed radio network
planning in such environment scenarios.
The IEEE 802.15.3c [3] standard has been created by the
IEEE 802.15.3c Task Group 3c (TG3c) [4] as the Wireless
Personal Area Network (WPAN) standard for the 60 GHz
band, ranging from 57-66 GHz in Europe [5]. As data capacity
is ultimately tied to modulation bandwidth, the date rates
required for High Deﬁnition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) for
uncompressed video/audio streaming and for multi-gigabit ﬁle
transfers are ﬁnally met for the ﬁrst time by standard [5].
Also, the high quantities of information inherent to, e.g.,
medical image and video, as well as the latency free required
transmission, only by means of uncompressed video trans-
mission, demands the utilisation of mmWave in conjunction
with protocol independent and processing free information
paths. Thus, using 60 GHz millimetre wave band provides the
necessary bandwidth and pace for future HD systems.
To this extent, the IEEE 802.15.3c Task Group 3c has
proposed a Audio-Visual mode (AV-PHY), where OFDM has
been adopted due to its inherent higher bandwidth efﬁciency
[6] and relatively low complexity. An OFDM system is well
known to be an effective anti-multipath technique. The latter
is primarily due to its reduced channel equalization complex-
ity in the frequency domain due to a single-tap Frequency
Domain (FD) equalizer and increased time of transmitted
symbol, ain addition to the orthogonality properties between
subcarriers [6]. On the other hand, in a single carrier system,
the transmitted time symbol is the inverse of the system
bandwidth, which means that for multi-gigabit data rates the
symbol time becomes very short. This fact leads to a much
more complex receiver, i.e., a time-domain equalizer with
hundred of taps [7].
In this paper, the reliability of an uncoded OFDM wire-
less communication system to transmit uncompressed video
content at 60 GHz, based on the IEEE 802.15.3c standard
[3], under the presence of propagation channel impairments,
is assessed. The multipath fading channel models considered
are the ones suggested by TG3c [4] for ofﬁce, residential and
kiosk indoor environments, considering both LOS and NLOS
scenarios. Moreover, in order to ensure a relatively low system
complexity, Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer is considered and
Forward Error Correction Coding (FEC) is not employed. For
example in [8], it is shown that using Low Density Parity
Check Codes (LDPC) improves the system performance by
about 8 to 9 dB at the expense of system complexity and
throughput.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the
work proposed by the IEEE 802.15.3c Task Group 3c (TG3c)
on the 60 GHz channel modeling. Section III introduces

OFDM and its parameters in the system design. The details
about the proposed mm-Wave framework are presented in Sec-
tion IV. Finally, Section V provides results of the performed
analysis.

INDOOR CHANNEL MODELLING AT 60 GHZ
This section presents the channel modeling [4] proposed
by TG3c at 60 GHz for the following indoor environments:
ofﬁce, residential and kiosk. These channel models are based
on a frequency sweep technique performed using a Vector
Network Analyzer (VNA) to measure the frequency response
of the radio channel. The centre frequency and the bandwidth
considered in these measurements were 62.5 GHz and 3 GHz,
respectively. For each environment, both LOS and NLOS
scenarios were considered, except in the kiosk environment,
where only LOS has been considered. In such indoor scenarios,
multipath components are mainly obtained from reﬂected or
scattered signals from furniture, ﬂoor and ceiling.
A. Considered Power Delay Proﬁles
The IEEE 802.15.3c standard has adopted the generic
Complex Impulse Response (CIR) based on the clustering
of propagation phenomena in both time and spatial domains,
as observed in measurement data [4]. The cluster model is
based on the extension of the Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) model
[9] to the angular domain by Spencer [10]. Hence, the IEEE
802.15.3c channel modeling group [11] proposed a statistical
channel model dependent on the temporal and spatial domains,
where signals arrive at the receiver ﬁrst in a LOS component,
calculated with a two-ray model, and then in clusters (modiﬁed
S-V model). This 60 GHz channel modeling is utilized in
this work, allowing the performance evaluation of OFDM
systems over different multipath environments. Additionally,
each indoor environment has been mapped onto a channel
model and scenario, as presented in Table I.
Table I maps the environment to the channel model and
scenario [1].

Several channel realizations may be considered to yield
different power delay proﬁles (PDP) for the same multipath
environment. This occurs due to the fact that the considered
channel modeling tool [11] takes into account the uniform
distribution in terms of the scatters movements between trans-
mitter (TX) and receiver (RX) and at different antennas height.
Consequently, CIR of each channel model is obtained from
100 quasi-static realizations. Moreover, the PDP has been
analyzed in terms of averaged RMS delay spread (¯τ RMS),
coherence bandwidth for signal correlation of 0.9 ( ¯Bc0.9)
and Rician factor ( ¯K). The Bc is a key metric involved in
expressing the performance of any digital wireless system
over fading channels, where a system bandwidth smaller

than the coeherence bandwidth of the channel is required
to be considered a ﬂat-fading channel. Otherwise, the fading
channel is considered frequency-selective, making the digitally
modulated data experiencing Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI)
and, thus, higher BER. Coherence bandwidth is normally
deﬁned as the maximum frequency difference at which two
signals are highly correlated and a correlation of 0.9 (Bc0.9)
is most commonly used. It has been calculated by (1), which
is inversely proportional to ¯τ RMS [12].

ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY DIVISION
MULTIPLEXING AND SINGLE CARRIER FREQUENCY
DOMAIN EQUALIZATION
OFDM is a well known multi-carrier transmission scheme
that is mostly used to provide high-data rate links in frequency-
selective channels [6]. At the transmitter, a high-rate data
stream is transformed into Nc low-rate parallel streams allo-
cated to different orthogonal carriers that can be easily equal-
ized in the frequency domain due to the orthogonality among
all those sub-carriers. OFDM can be seen as a multiplexing
technique since the output signal is the linear sum of modulated
subcarrier signals.
The discrete expression of (2) is given by [6]:
x(mTs) =
Nc−1
X
n=0
Xnej2πnm/N,
(2)
where, Xn, n = 0,1,..., Nc-1, is the Nc data symbols corre-
sponding to a two-dimensional QAM constellation.
From (2), it is veriﬁed that the discrete OFDM version is an
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operation, which maps
the data symbols into adjacent sub-carriers. In the receiver, the
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to demodulate the data
symbols.
Although OFDM allows increased time symbol duration
for high data rate transmission in comparison with single car-
rier transmission schemes, the overlapping of OFDM symbols
due to multipath effects still has an important impact on system
performance. This fact results in the loss of orthogonality
among sub-carriers, which severely increases ISI and BER
performance. To overcome this issue, a Cyclic Preﬁx (CP)
is introduced and the symbol is cyclically extended from the

original harmonic wave of the Fourier period Ts by a guard
interval of length TCP . Additionally, the cyclically extended
guard interval transforms the convolution of the signal and
the channel from linear to a circular convolution and hence
a traditional complex time domain equalizer is replaced by
a simple single-tap Frequency Domain (FD) equalizer. More-
over, the CP functionality is only efﬁcient when the CP interval
time is larger than the maximum delay spread of the multipath
channel.

MMWAVE SYSTEM MODELS BASED ON IEEE
802.15.3C STANDARD
The OFDM is implemented based on IEEE 802.15.3c stan-
dard, as illustrated in Fig. 1. At the transmitter, a data source
is employed to generate pseudo-random bits, which are then
mapped into a Gray-coded constellation of QAM symbols. The
modulated symbols are mapped into K-subcarriers through K-
points IFFT transform. Next, a cyclic extension is inserted.
Finally, the wireless channel effect, based on the IEEE model
proposed in [4], is taken into account through the convolution
of its CIR, presented in subsection II-A, for each channel
realization. At the receiver, CIR is ideally estimated and its
FFT performed to equalize the received data. Additionally, bit
and tone interleaver are used in the OFDM system to enhance
its frequency diversity.
In order to shape the OFDM signal Power Spectral Density
(PSD), the sub-carriers are allocated into the IFFT according
to Table IV [3].

enough data rate to enable such wireless application.

A. Received Signal and Frequency Domain Equalization
The received signal, y(t), after being processed using K-
point FFT, is converted into its frequency domain, Y (k). The
received OFDM signal, Yl, considering that Tcp ≥ τmax is
given by:
Yl(k) = Hl(k).Xl(k) + Zl(k),
(3)
where, kth denote the subcarrier frequency component of the
lth transmitted OFDM signal, Hl(k) is the Channel Frequency
Response (CFR) and Zl(k) is the AWGN in the frequency
domain. The original transmitted information, Xl(k) can be
recovered using a Frequency Domain Equalization (FDE)
[13], which is performed as a K-branch linear feed-forward
equalizer with C(k) being the complex coefﬁcient of the kth
subcarrier. In this work, only one FDE approach is considered,
namely Zero Forcing (ZF) due to its relatively low implemen-
tation complexity, i.e., it does not require signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) estimation. For the ZF criterion, C(k) is deﬁned by (4).
CZF (k) =
ˆH(k)∗
| ˆH(k)|2
(4)
where, ˆH(k), ∗ and |.| denote the estimated CFR, conjugate
transpose and modulus, respectively.

EFFECT OF CHANNEL IMPAIRMENTS ON THE OFDM
PERFORMANCE
In this section, the uncoded OFDM system performance
over the IEEE standard channel model [4] at 60 GHz is
assessed using ZF equalization and employing 16 QAM mod-
ulation. The quality of the transmitted uncompressed video
content in Full HD, is assessed through BER and PSNR
analysis. In addition, it is possible to estimate the minimum
value of Eb/No to ensure a relatively satisfactory subjective
quality of the video frame depicted in Fig. 2 used for this
purpose. This is achieved by using the relation between the
PSNR (objective quality assessment metric) and the subjective
quality assessment based on viewer’s impression, presented in
Table V [14].

Figure 3. Uncoded OFDM BER performance for various channel models.
The average uncoded OFDM BER results, computed for
each channel model, are displayed in Fig. 3. It is evident
from these results that the performance of OFDM is severely
affected by the propagation channel environment. As depicted
only the performance of 16 QAM uncoded OFDM over
CM9 meets the recommended BER target for video streaming
applications, that is 10−6 [4]. This is explained by the fact
CM9 is channel model characterized with the highest Rician
factor and lowest frequency selectivity. The performance of
uncoded OFDM over CM2, CM3 and CM4 environments is
relatively poor, since an uncoded OFDM systems are well
known to lack of frequency diversity and thus in such radio
propagation channels a wireless communication is not reliable.
Additionally, CM1 fails to meet the BER target, despite being
characterized by a relatively low RMS delay, since CP interval
time is shorter than the maximum delay spread of the multipath
channel.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of uncoded OFDM
for a relatively good Quality of Service (QoS) at appropriate
Eb/No values, the degradation of the quality of the video frame
for CM9 has been studied. The video frame content (Fig. 2)
is divided into several transmitting OFDM symbols and then
transmitted over the channel model. PSNR results are depicted
in Fig. 4 using 16 QAM, together with those obtained for an
ideal radio propagation channel, i.e., no temporal dispersion
is presented (dash curve). It be can seen that the effect of
CM9 model have not signiﬁcant impact on the degradation
of the quality of reference video frame, with the maximum
achievable PSNR of about 60 dB (for a Eb/No = 13 dB). This
characterizes the video frame subjective quality as excellent

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the study of the impact of channel impair-
ments on a 60 GHz uncoded OFDM system, implemented
according to the IEEE 802.15.3c standard, for high data-rate
applications, and considering 16 QAM, was presented. The
performance assessment of the OFDM system was conducted
through BER and PSNR analysis considering the transmission
of an uncompressed Full HD video frame over residential,
ofﬁce and kiosk environments, for both NLOS and LOS
scenarios.
It has been shown that multipath effect modeled by CM4
induces the largest performance degradation of the system
when compared with CM3, CM2 and CM1. It is concluded
that the presence of LOS in the multipath scenario is re-
quired in a uncoded communication systems, for example it
is demonstrated at Eb/No = 40 dB the maximum BER of
OFDM over CM3 is lower than 10−3, whereas at the same
Eb/No over CM4 the maximum achievable BER is around
0.2. Hence, it is veriﬁed that a uncoded 16 QAM OFDM
system operating over a relatively low dispersion multipath
channel and in a LOS scenario is robust enough to provide a
excellent quality of service in streaming uncompressed video
for wireless applications. Furthermore, in order to minimize

ISI, for the cases where the BER target is not achieved,
FEC coding should be considered at the expense of system
complexity and throughput. Apart from CM9 model, no other
channel yielded relatively good communication link quality,
i.e., the desired BER target was not met for a minimum QoS.
Finally, results presented in this work demonstrate that
CM9 is appropriate for low complexity mmWave wireless
communication systems envisaged for next generations of
HDTV standards, where wireless uncompressed video stream-
ing content is a demand.
