Abstract—The 
world 
of 
the 
geo-synchronous 
satellite 
communications is witnessing, for several months now, a 
strong discussion, if not a dispute, between some systems 
manufacturers about the opportunity of increasing the 
efficiency of the coding schemes proposed by the second 
generation of the Digital Video Broadcasting standard by 
introducing some extensions. Even if the debate rises the 
interest of operators and manufacturers, its conclusions are far 
from being unanimously accepted. This paper concentrates 
mainly on the sharper low roll-off factor shaping filters 
proposed among the extensions. Their effects on the satellite 
channel are presented in a comparative analysis supported by 
measurements 
performed 
on 
commercial 
devices. 
The 
operational impacts are observed from the point of view of one 
of the main European satellite operators: Eutelsat.

INTRODUCTION 
In 2011, different manufacturers started to release new 
modulation 
and 
coding 
architectures 
for 
satellite 
communications, 
claiming 
to 
achieve 
significant 
performance improvements (higher than 15%) over their 
competitors and over the existing Second Generation of the 
Digital Video Broadcasting over Satellite (DVB-S2) 
standard [1]. The new features encompass, among others, 
sharp roll-off factors (ROF) for the shaping filters as well as 
proprietary pre-distortion and equalization techniques 
mitigating the non-linearity of the active components 
(mainly high power amplifiers). 
These novelties arose the interest of the entire satellite 
communications 
world, 
including 
standardization 
committees, such as the current DVB-Technical Module, that 
are evaluating the insertion of these new features in the 
DVB-S2 standard [2]. 
 Confronted with this innovation and the increasing 
requests for high efficiency in the capacity usage, Eutelsat, 
as one of the leading worldwide satellite operators, has to 
assume the role of customers guide in order to warrantee a 
high quality of service by using the very latest standard 
transmission techniques in the most correct way. 
One of the most frequently asked questions concerns the 
real performance of ROF reduction over a satellite link in 
particular referring to the existing DVB-S2. The objective of 
the work presented in this paper is to assess by reliable and 
reproducible 
measurements 
in 
controlled 
laboratory 
environment the pros and cons of reducing the ROF in 
satellite transmission.  
This study is based on measurements obtained with 
different professional devices and the close collaboration 
with key manufacturers in satellite communication industry. 
The devices under test are commercial products; the reported 
tests are performed over a reference DVB-S2 test bed [3]. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section II provides 
some 
backgrounds 
including 
the 
satellite 
channel 
description, the transmission techniques, their extensions and 
emission constraints. Section III is dedicated to a preliminary 
analysis of two operational scenarios. The validation 
equipment and methodology is described in Section IV, 
whereas the results are discussed in the Section V. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
A. The Satellite Link 
This paper considers operations over transparent 
geostationary satellites. To maximize their efficiency, the on-
board amplifiers are operated as close as possible to the 
saturation point. This imposes a trade-off between power 
efficiency and signal distortion. 
Further impairments onto the signal quality come from 
the Input Multiplexer (IMUX) before, and Output 
Multiplexer (OMUX) after the satellite Travelling Wave 
Tube Amplifier (TWTA) [4]. They aim at limiting 
interferences between adjacent transponders.  
On the ground, the uplink earth station high power 
amplifier (HPA) output is not filtered. So proper back-off 
setting is of paramount importance to limit in-band and out-
of-band distortion. 
On the whole, satellite transmission is impacted by 
amplitude and phase distortions mainly due to amplifiers 
working in the saturation point, group delay, phase and 
frequency errors, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) 
and phase noise. This paper will consider the effect of 
amplifiers and AWGN only. 
Studies on the non-linear degradation of end-to-end 
system performance exist in the literature and are here 
referred. These are simulations [5], extensive testing over 
emulator or satellite [6] and results obtained by the 
International 
Telecommunication 
Union 
Radio-
communication Sector (ITU-R) [7].

B. Baseline Transmission Standard and Filtering 
DVB-S2 [1] specifies the format of the digital signal to 
be transmitted over a satellite channel. It is used by the 
manufacturers 
as 
a 
reference 
document 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
transmitters 
(or 
modulators) 
for 
broadcasting, interactive services, news gathering, and 
broadband applications that will be compatible with any 
receiver. The receiver design is not described in the DVB-S2 
standard.  
DVB-S2 introduces new modulation and coding 
(modcod) schemes with respect to the previous DVB-S. 
Three higher order modulation schemes, 8PSK, 16 and 
32APSK. In particular, the last two suffer from non-linear 
distortions and their activation leads to a trade-off between 
power efficiency and signal degradation. 
In DVB-S2, a conventional square-root raised cosine 
(RRC) shaping filter is defined at the transmitter. The 35% 
ROF is inherited from DVB-S whereas new values of 25% 
and 20% have been added. Today’s industry manufacturers 
aim at extending the portfolio of their products by further 
deploying new modcods and new ROF. 
C. Extension Towards New Features and Sharper Filters 
Sharpening the roll-off of the filters changes the 
characteristics of the modulated signal. The impact onto the 
entire transmission chain should be identified to derive the 
new operational parameters to be used, for ground and space 
segments, from consolidated experience.  
The analysis and measurements performed by Eutelsat 
onto professional equipment is based on the following 
assumptions. The reference waveform is DVB-S2 with roll-
off 35%. Competitive waveforms operate at sharper roll-off 
of 5% and 10%. The impact of compensation techniques 
(i.e., pre-distortion and equalization) is assessed but these 
additional techniques are considered as non-standard [1]. 
D. Eutelsat’s Emission Constraints 
Eutelsat aims at maintaining a high level of services and 
is mainly concerned about the amount of out-of-band 
emissions and the in-band distortion. That is why the 
European operator has published a standard, commonly 
known as EESS 502 [8], giving the basic requirements for 
the earth stations (E/S) and the spectrum utilization. 
At the uplink E/S, the HPA sizing and linear operation 
has to be verified in order to reduce the risk of interference 
with other customers using the same Eutelsat satellite as well 
as with adjacent satellites.  
At the receiver, the error performance over a non-linear 
channel should be known to ensure correct link closure, as 
well as the robustness against inter-channel interference 
(ICI). The two measurement points can be found at the HPA 
output and at the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) input in 
Fig. 1. 
III. 
PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS 
A. Definitions 
This section and the remaining part of the paper, 
considers the resources of satellite transponders, or capacity, 
in terms of bandwidth and power. As all natural resources, 
also the transponder bandwidth and power are limited: 
Eutelsat’s satellites provide transponders with bandwidth of 
33, 36, 72, 115 and 237.5 MHz whereas the power received 
on ground depends on the footprint extension.  
In order to dissociate the power and the frequency, the 
power spectral density (PSD), or power per frequency unit 
(in dBW/Hz) is introduced. For linear modulation, the PSD 
is proportional, if not equivalent, to the symbol energy 
S
E which is representative of the quality of the received 
signal through the ration 
ES N0
with 
0
N  the thermal noise 
energy.  
From these definitions, it follows that a carrier modulated 
on a bandwidth B has a power C (in dBW) that is the 
mathematical integral of the signal PSD calculated over the 
bandwidth B at the receiver. Assuming an AWGN channel 
the noise power is given by 
N B
N
0
=
. The ratio 
C N
 is 
also representative of the received signal quality and we can 
use the approximation

The expression (1) is already indicative of the fact that if 
we need to improve the performance of the received signal, 
the symbol energy must be increased. But, since the 
available power on board the satellite is limited to C, the 
only way is reducing the bandwidth B and increasing the 
PSD. 
B. Two Reference Scenarios 
The DVB-S2 (or related extensions) carriers can be used 
with two configurations: single and multiple carriers per 
transponder.  
The first configuration is typical of consumer services 
like TV broadcasting and the forward channel in interactive 
networks (as it is described in the DVB-RCS standard [9]: 
 
 
Figure 1. Emulated satellite chain and critical measurement: the IMUX 
and OMUX effects have not been investigated during the tests

one carrier exploits all the power available in a single 
transponder, also working close to the saturation point of the 
TWTA on board, and the signal coming from the satellite 
can be easily received also by small and cheap end user 
antennas.  
With the same issue of exploiting the resources of a 
transponder, the configuration with only one carrier per 
transponder is used for the implementation of wideband data 
links, in which case the ground segment is represented by 
very large satellite dishes (typically over 3.2 m antennas). 
The entire transponder’s power is required in order to reach 
the highest throughput by introducing high efficiency 
modcods. 
The second configuration, i.e., multiple carriers per 
transponder (see Fig. 2) is typical for the single channel per 
carrier (SCPC) adopted for relatively small data links based 
on Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs), video 
contributions and all inbound carriers of interactive systems.  
The usage of the extended DVB-S2 features would bring 
important advantages to both these scenarios, but from the 
point of view of an operator there are also some counterparts 
to be taken into account. 
C. Sharpening the Shaping Filters: Spectrum Analysis 
First immediate advantage would come from reducing 
the ROF down to very low values. In a configuration with 
single carrier per transponder, this would permit to reduce 
the bandwidth occupied by the signal and increase the 
symbol rate and therefore the overall throughput.  
For example, in a 36 MHz transponder, the maximum 
symbol

would be 34.3 Msym/s. But also we have to maintain a 
constant value of the signal power because of the 
transponder limitation: decreasing the ROF means that the 
PSD

=1.14=0.6 dB. The link budget would 
suffer from 0.6 dB reduction and, depending on the link 
margin assumed, this could impose to choose a less efficient 
modcod and the expected gain of 4.3 Msym/s would be 
hardly applicable to real cases. Certainly, this scenario would 
benefit from the introduction of new modcods but only 
satellite links with large link margin would take a real 
advantage by the small ROF. In any case, this analysis does 
not take into account the distortion induced by the filters on 
both sides of the transponder: measurements are a helpful 
tool to study these effects, which could require a fine-tuning 
of the satellite link. 
A similar analysis can be performed in the case of multi 
carriers per transponder where the impairment due to the ICI 
must be considered. As better shown in the following of this 
paper, the TWTA saturation generates a spectrum regrowth 
at the frequencies adjacent the signal band. Such a regrowth 
is more pronounced for small ROFs (see in particular Fig. 5) 
leading to increased ICI in a multi-carriers configuration. So, 
on one hand a small ROF would allow the reduction of the 
distance between the carriers, or carriers spacing, on the 
other hand this would also drive the transponders close to 
saturation, which would increase the interference.  
Measurement results reported below in this paper will 
clarify this point and will permit to add further conclusions. 
D. Low ROF Effects on the Constellations 
One of the effects of sharpening the shaping filters 
appears in the plot of the transitions from one symbol to 
another within a constellation. These transitions generate a 
signal envelope variation over the maximum symbol energy 
which extent depends on the ROF: as smaller the ROF is as 
important is this envelope variation. 
Fig. 3 shows the envelope variation at ROF 35% (black 
lines) and 5% (red) for two QPSK signals measured at the 
output of a modulator.  
This behaviour has an immediate impact on the distortion 
and the Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) when the amplifiers 
are driven close to the saturation: as indicated in [5] pre-
distortion techniques can be applied in order to mitigate this 
effect, even if they are less effective for high order 
constellations (APSK) than for QPSK and 8PSK. Small ROF 
would further reduce the pre-distortion performances. Also,

this argumentation has been subject of some measurements 
described here below. 
IV. 
THE MEASUREMENTS: THE TESTBED DESCRIPTION 
A.  The Channel Emulator 
Eutelsat’s validation equipment mainly consists of a 
reference satellite channel emulator [3] and state-of-the-art 
professional DVB-S2 transmitter and receiver. The entire 
DVB-S2 testbed also includes traffic generators and 
recipients, spectrum analyzers, a control unit, as well as 
additional DVB-S2 devices for a multi-carrier per 
transponder configuration.  
The non-linear TWTA profile, defined in the DVB-S2 
standard [1], Fig. H.12, is emulated in order to test the 
spectrum regrowth and the end-to-end performance over a 
non-linear channel in single carrier per transponder 
configuration. It is worth mentioning that the adopted profile 
is 
pessimistic 
compared 
with 
the 
modern 
TWTA 
characteristics. Anyway, the choice of this profile becomes 
mandatory in the case the studies done in the literature are 
taken as reference. 
B. Test Conditions 
A linear channel, i.e., a link with only the presence of 
AWGN, is often considered as a reference scenario to verify 
the performance of the channel decoder. Such a performance 
should be specified also in terms of difference between the 
minimum 
ES N0
allowing a demodulator to lock a received 
signal (i.e., the lock threshold) and the 
ES N0
 at which the 
same device already locked to the signal passes to the unlock 
status (i.e., the unlock threshold).  
For the emulation of a single carrier saturating a 
transponder, a memory-less non-linearity impairment on top 
of AWGN is added. A phase noise impairment is then 
introduced to represent the receive chain down-conversion 
characteristics (in the spacecraft, low-noise block down-
converter, and tuner oscillators). At high 
RS BT
ratio (with 
S
R symbol rate, and 
T
B  the satellite transponder bandwidth), 
a major impact is due to IMUX and OMUX filtering. In fact, 
since the signal works close to the transponder boundaries 
defined by these filters, a severe group delay affects the 
carrier: this aspect is not investigated hereafter. 
Multiple carriers per transponder configuration consist in 
setting several carriers side by side, and insuring a limited 
adjacent channel interference of one to the other. 
V. 
RESULTS 
A. Transmitter End 
Measurements at the modulator output and the HPA 
output have been performed in order to characterize the 
signal. At the modulator output the roll-off reduction causes 
sharper fall of the transmit filter frequency response (Fig. 4). 
The corresponding impulse response presents oscillations 
which amplitude decreases in time slowly than for high ROF 
filters. This behavior has its counterpart in the IQ signal 
diagram as already presented in Fig. 3.  
At the output of the uplink high-power amplifier, the 
spectrum regrowth is given for Input Back-Off (IBO) values 
ranging from 0dB (saturation) to 18dB (linear region). 
Moving from 35% (Fig. 5-a) to 5% (Fig. 5–b) increases the 
out-of-band spectral regrowth by 1 to 2dB (depending on the 
IBO) as well as a change of the spectrum shape. 
Therefore, whereas a sharper roll-off is activated with the 
aim of increasing the symbol rate (see the discussion above) 
a higher power is required to keep the 
ES N0
ratio constant. 
Therefore, the uplink HPA could require a re-sizing in order 
to grant a level of unwanted out-of-band emissions 
compliant with the Eutelsat EESS 502 standard [8].

In order to enable smaller ROF, E/S operators shall 
demonstrate that their out-of-band emissions are compliant 
with the Eutelsat’s requirements. The same amount of 
spectrum regrowth is also present after on-board satellite 
TWTA, but will be partly rejected by the satellite OMUX 
filter. 
B. Receiver End: One Carrier per Transponder 
The error performance curves for modcods QPSK 1/2 
and 8PSK 2/3 are given in Fig. 6-a; those for 16APSK3/4 
and 32APSK4/5 in Fig. 6-b. For every modcod, two channels 
are investigated (AWGN plain lines, and non-linearized 
TWTA dashed lines). For each channel the performance for 
ROF 35% (blue squares) and ROF 5% (green triangles) are 
presented.  
In a linear channel, the most recent DVB-S2 
demodulators overcome the first generation DVB-S2 
chipsets by about 0.7dB to 1.7dB (from QPSK to 32APSK, 
see [7]). The use of ROF 5% always requires a 
ES N0
 ratio 
about 0.3dB higher to lock, but the steep waterfall behavior 
is unchanged. Over a non-linear channel at optimal IBO 
(given in [1], Table H.1) conventional ROF 35% suffers 
from low degradation compared to the reference figures. 5% 
ROF suffers from additional non-linear distortions of about 
0.5dB.   
For all modcods, the expected frame error rate (FER) 
versus
ES N0
waterfall curves are shifted to a higher 
ES N0
region when decreasing the ROF from 35% to 5% at 
the transmitter. 
Reference simulations results presented in [5], indicate 
that the impact on the synchronization of the carrier of ROF 
20%, 25% with reference to 35% is negligible. Our 
measurements onto professional equipment state that ROF 
5% slightly degrades the error performance over linear and 
non-linear channels. 
Another way to look at the non-linear channel is to 
search for the optimum back-off. The total degradation 
(DTOT), as defined in [5] and reported in (2), is minimized 
when the sum of the non-linear distortions suffered by 
modulated signal and the power loss due to the operation of 
the amplifier at a given back-off is minimized.

(2) 
The optimum back-off values for ROF 35% and 5% are 
given in Fig. 7. ROF reduction to 5% does not change the 
output bock-off (OBO). The optimum IBO is larger, so is the 
total degradation. 
So, when the ROF decreases, the loss over a nonlinear 
channel due to the distortion becomes stronger. To support 
the use of sharper roll-off, mitigation algorithms have been 
introduced. Some results of non-linear compensation 
techniques are presented in Fig. 7-b: even if the pre-
distortion 
seems 
achieving 
better 
performance 
than 
equalization, it also suffers from several known limitations. 
First, TWTA characteristics must be known by the 
modulator 
in 
order 
to 
calculate 
the 
pre-distortion 
coefficients. Second, the pre-distortion algorithm minimizes 
the non-linear distortion at a given back-off. Consequently, 
at higher OBO the pre-compensation of the signal increases 
the degradation: in extreme conditions the usage of 
pre-distortion in linear region causes a huge penalty.  
C. Receiver End: Multiple Carriers per Transponder 
The measurements performed with ROF down to 5% 
highlight the risks for ICI due to the sharpening of the 
shaping filters. Fig. 8 is comparable to the Fig. 30 in [10] and 
shows that the degradation increases with the reduction of 
the carrier spacing (CS) much rapidly for very small ROF. 
The consequence is that, in particular for small carriers, the 
transmission is easily exposed to frequency errors that add 
heavy impairments due to ICI. In other words, very low 
tolerance is allowed to the central frequency for low ROF

Another source of degradation of the end-to-end link 
appears when the receiver filter does not match the transmit 
filter. The dashed lines Fig. 8, labelled as “unknown” are an 
example of receivers using ROF higher - even if not 
explicitly indicated by the manufacturer - than the transmit 
filters. Obviously the ICI impact on the degradation is not 
negligible. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper reports on the test results obtained by Eutelsat 
with professional DVB-S2 equipment featuring small ROF. 
Error performance in single and multiple carriers per 
transponder configurations have been assessed. The outcome 
unveils several issues as seen from a system operator 
perspective. At the receiver, the end-to-end link degradation 
is amplified. At the transmitter as well as on board satellite, 
non-linearity is increased. In multicarrier per transponder 
configuration, the old DVB-S2 only receivers suffer from 
additional losses.  
In case of adoption of sharper roll-off factors, important 
changes must be planned at the transmitter and receiver. At 
the uplink station, more powerful high power amplifiers are 
required to limit out-of-band emissions.  
At the modulator and demodulator ends, proprietary pre- 
and/or post-compensation techniques are available to 
mitigate the non-linear distortions. Their advantages and 
weaknesses have been highlighted, but since they are not part 
of a standard no commitment onto the interoperability and 
achievable performance among chipset manufacturers can be 
assured.
