Abstract— A mathematical model is proposed to describe the 
dynamics of the heat extraction process in a domestic 
refrigerator. The concerned model is based on both the 
Newton's Law of Cooling and the Fourier Heat Equation; where 
the first one acts as the boundary condition to consider the 
physical properties of the insulation walls and their interaction 
with the environment and with the internal energy contained in 
the cooler chamber. The Fourier Equation has been 
implemented to describe the energetic behavior in the concerned 
chamber and it is grounded in the numerical consideration of 
the finite prismatic volumes concept, which take the respective 
thermodynamic properties of air or water as well as the thermal 
load distribution defines. The finite volume concept and the 
conductive equation consider the null mass exchange between 
volumes; therefore, heat conduction emulates the finite volumes 
interaction and convection simulates the cooling chamber 
boundaries. Codification was performed through Matlab and its 
experimental validation took places in the National Laboratory 
for Cooling Technology Research (LaNITeF). Certain finite 
volumes were located strategically into the cooling chamber to 
be compared with the sensor’s measurements. The model 
provides useful data to improve the understanding of the 
temperature behavior in terms of the chamber geometry, cool 
air flow and thermal load ratio, leading to basics concepts for 
the future development of control strategies to implement 
several energetic consumption optimization algorithms. 
Keywords-Heat exchange;thermal diffusivity;finite volume. 
 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, the implementation of new technologies in the 
refrigeration industry has increased significantly. The 
objective of these technological developments has different 
arguments, depending on the problem to solve, but in the 
global context, the most important issues are: the energy 
consumption of the vapor compression cooling systems, the 
heat extraction from of high magnitudes of thermal loads, the 
impact of the refrigerant gas leaks to the environment and the 
performance of the heat interchangers of the vapor 
compression thermodynamic cycle [1]. 
There are interesting contributions in the state of the art 
concerned 
with 
theoretical 
and/or 
experimental 
methodologies to extract the thermodynamic parameters of 
cooling devices or systems from several companies, 
moreover, from manufacturers of thermoelectric chillers 
(TEC) and thermoelectric generators (TEG).  
The Lineykin et al. model could be useful to analyze the 
displacement requirements of the TEC and the loading effects 
of the TEG [2]. The cited review and analysis indicate that 
greenhouse emissions from conventional vapor compression 
refrigeration systems driven by diesel engines commonly used 
for the refrigeration of food transportation can reach 40% of 
the vehicle's engine emissions [3]

Thermoacoustic refrigeration is an alternative technology 
capable to provide cooling levels for several temperature 
magnitudes, without using any substance harmful to the nature 
environment. 
Therefore, 
thermoacoustic 
represents 
a 
technology niche to increase the cooling market for a bigger 
production of perishables products [4]. Currently, the most 
efficient thermoacoustic refrigerators are used in the industrial 
environments [5], which work by taking advantage of the 
interdependence between the enthalpy carried through by the 
Gedeon mechanism and the local temperature; as an example 
of this fact we have the recently developed four-stage 
progressive wave thermoacoustic engine [6]. 
The 
prime 
movers 
and 
refrigerators 
based 
on 
thermoacoustic have gained considerable importance toward 
practical applications because of: the absence of moving 
components, 
the 
reasonable 
efficiency, 
the 
use 
of 
environmentally friendly working fluids, etc. [7]. The results 
from the experimental studies were correlated in terms of: the 
Nusselt number, the Prandtl number and the Reynolds number 
to estimate their correlation in the heat transfer stage at the 
heat exchangers. Experimental data show that there are 
significant errors in the cited heat transfer correlation analysis 
algorithm. Dynamically, these results also show that there is a 
relationship between the oscillatory heat transfer coefficient at 
the heat exchangers and both the mean pressure and the 
frequency of oscillation [8]. 
The 
perishable 
products 
conservation 
has 
been 
indispensable in any place that requires a conservation process 
for food, as well as in: restaurants, large, medium and small 
commercial stores, that transport or shows different human 
consumption products which must remain at a minimum 
temperature level to be conserved in their best conditions, as 
well as for domestic purposes in daily life [9]. 
In the other hand, cooling technology is one of the most 
used and important services for the industry manufacturing 
process, more over it is critical for many specific sectors as 
well as the healthcare and feeding; essentially because of the 
infrastructure of their production and storage processes [10]. 
Therefore, cold needs are always present in some industries, 
where the material or product is obtained, cultivated or 
extracted, also where it is transferred to the plant, factory or 
warehouse, even though in its storage time, and in its 
production and conservation processes as well as when it is 
put on sale in optimal conditions for the final consumer [11] 
and [12]. 
This article analyzes the energy exchange mechanism 
between the thermal load and tend the volume cooled by the 
evaporator. This analysis scope is extended to the behavior of 
the temperature distribution in the cooling chamber of a 
domestic refrigerator, by modifying both the density of the 
elements (finite volumes) according to their position into the 
cooling volume and the ratio between its energy consumption 
and the total thermal load (considering 3 percentages of full 
load or volume) [13]; with the purpose to focus on the cooling 
power to get a better conservation performance of the food 
characteristics for and then to improve the energetic 
performance of the concerned cooling systems [14]. 
Several deeper researches work on different areas of 
refrigeration technologies (i. e., condenser, energy exchange) 
shows that the environmental conditions change strongly 
affects these systems performances. In the matter of fact all 
cooling systems designs needs to take in account this to 
improve its energetic performance and to reduce its effect in 
the natural environment health. The improvements can also be 
developed to decrease the negative environmental impact of 
refrigerant leaks by prediction and monitoring their flow by 
using a mathematical model. These mathematical models 
have been developed by taking considering the different 
relationships between the thermodynamically variables of 
interest [15]. 
One of the most relevant foundation for the dynamic 
analysis of energy in the state of the art, was achieved and 
documented on [16], where there is a formulated 
mathematical model which use also both the Newton law for 
cooling and the heat transfer Fourier equation; by solving both 
equations using the finite volume method, without mass flow, 
considering just the thermodynamic characteristics of the 
water in different percentages of thermal load [17]. 
The present work is structured as follows: Section II 
mentions the basic concepts to detail the proposed theories 
and the expected effects. Section III presents the 
mathematical model developed and the results obtained from 
simulations, in addition to have an early interpretation of the 
process of energy exchange between mass along the internal 
volumes. Section IV explains the results generated by the 
simulations and their possible effect in the refrigeration cycle. 
Finally, section V presents the conclusions of this first stage 
of the  developed research. 
II. 
BASIC CONCEPTS 
The most important assumptions considered in the 
mathematical model proposed here, are listed as follows:  
-The environment temperature and pressure are 
homogenous and time invariant. 
-The thermodynamic characteristics of the involved 
materials are also time invariant and spatially isotropic. 
-There is no mass flow through the finite volume nodes 
into the refrigerator chamber. 
-Energy interchange into the chamber is carried out by 
conduction between inside nodes and by convection at the 
boundary conditions. 
As it was defined, with these assumptions the dynamic 
model can be synthetized as a linear relationship for the 
considered variables through both the Newton law for 
cooling and the Fourier heat transfer equation.  
In the testing procedure to emulate different levels of 
thermal load some water containers were used and locate at 
the refrigerator and freezer chambers. 
It is important to clarify that the Fourier heat transfer 
equation was implemented to solve the temperature 
conduction between the internal nodes conceived as finite 
volumes into the chamber, so that the mass flow has been 
considered null [18]. In addition, The Newton law for cooling 
solves the heat convection between the internal finite volume 
nodes and the boundary nodes at the isolation walls. Table I

      Experimentally, two states of thermal load ratio, empty 
(0%) and full (100%), were tested to determine the 
temperature evolution and the energy behavior along the 
testing time [19]. The main purpose of both tests was to 
quantify the effect of the thermal momentum into the 
refrigeration cycle performance [20]. 
A. Characteristics of the model 
The transfer medium into the confined volume of the 
refrigerator chamber for the empty scenario was considered as 
a homogeneous air mix with a thermal conductivity of 0.024 
w / m ºK, where the initial condition is the environment 
temperature as 25 °C. 
The system dynamics is altered when the thermal load 
ratio changes its magnitude from empty to full, then the 
thermodynamic properties were modified (by adding water to 
the transfer media). In this scenario the heat extraction 
behavior takes more time from its initial to its final 
equilibrium. It must take in account that the water as transfer 
media is considered due to its magnitude into the food 
composition. 
B. Theoretical Proposal 
The mathematical fundamentals of the dynamic model to 
analyze the relationship between the heat extracted from the 
cooling chambers volume and its temperature distribution, 
comes from the convection Newton Law [21],


From the Newton law the amount of heat energy is 
included in the space discretized Fourier equation where it can 
see that some characteristics can change in the time domain 
according to the estimated amount of energy that the heat 
extractor absorbs, therefore the most significant coefficients 
are the thermal conductivity, the temperature gradient and the 
volume; but in this proposal to obtain a linear approximation, 
the properties are considered time invariant throughout the 
simulation [22].

C. Volume Analysis 
 The objective of this proposal is to describe the thermal 
distribution into the refrigerator chamber; therefore, all real 
spatial dimensions and thermal conduction properties of the 
refrigerator components materials were considered. Then, 
from time and space discretized the Fourier heat transfer 
equation, the formulation for the next time state of the 
temperature was synthetized for each i, j, k internal node, in 
terms the thermal properties of the materials, which occupy 
the confined volume causing a orthonormal heat transfer flow 
with its neighbors through the three spatial directions as were.

       Spatially, some finite volume nodes location was defined 
in the same places that some sensors were located which were 
used to validate the numerical prediction. The heat source is 
the evaporator device, so that its heat input is negative, 
because it extracts the energy from the confined volume of 
the refrigerator chamber. The interaction of energy between 
the evaporator and the outside variables is not explained in 
this document. Fig. 1 shows the finite volume nodes 
distribution for the temperature model inside the refrigerator 
chamber. 
III. 
MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND SIMULATION RESULTS  
       In this section, the final formulation of the mathematical 
approach developed in the present work is detailed; adding the 
data of the real thermal and energetic conditions which are 
considered in the synthetized model (4). Furthermore, the 
Matlab codification of (4) is compiled and executed to 
generate the numerical results shown on Fig. 3. 
       The data acquisition process is applied to a commercial 
fridge with a linear compressor and the following features 
- 132 watts, 60 Hz, 0% of thermal load ratio.  
- 313 watts, 150 Hz, 100% of thermal load ratio. 
       To clarify the proposal, a computational node was defined 
for each finite volume; as it is shown in both Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. 
       The width of the insulating wall (polyurethane) for the 
refrigerator chamber is 0.05 m, and the energy entering this 
chamber was quantified as 1.64 W by equation (3); this 
energy magnitude which is added to the heat extracted by the 
evaporator, depends of the environment temperature and it is 
consistent with other authors reports [16] and [17].

discrete model for the temperature into the refrigerator chamber. 
     In the testing scenario the internal temperature of the 
cooling chamber volume as well as the thermal load energy 
start at the ambient temperature, so the despondency process 
is also considered for this prediction; to look for the variation 
magnitude in the thermal inertial moment of the entire load 
inside. Then, the entering energy leaks from the ambient were 
quantified in the same point of the initial thermal equilibrium 
as

       The value of energy that comes from the environment is 
considered homogeneously for each existing volume, in any 
of its three directions at the boundary conditions, as it is 
illustrated in Fig. 2. In the node net shown (Fig. 2) the nodes 
next to the red wall, represent the ones which utilize the 
convection mechanism of energy transfer with the 
environment while the in the remaining nodes interaction is 
describe by conduction just.  
A. Operation of the model 
The behavior of the temperature must be radial from the 
center at the energy outlet location of the evaporator node. 
Each node will have an energy extraction limit that matches 
with the phase change energy of each material in the confined 
volume as it is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 helps to detail the 
energy transfer mechanism between nodes. 
    The first simulation was developed proposing an empty 
stage for the cooling chamber, without: shelves with water 
inside, any object or internal products. Here the logic predicts 
that there is a smaller amount of energy to be transported by 
the refrigeration systems which in consequence takes less 
time to get an internal thermal equilibrium at the refrigerant 
boiling point (see Fig. 5). 
     The empirical behavior is consistent with the theoretical 
radial propagation, hence the location of the evaporator to 
show the lowest values of temperature as shown in Fig. 2, 
depositing the element of higher density to the bottom of this.   
The empirical behavior is consistent with the theoretical 
radial propagation, hence the location of the evaporator to 
show the lowest values of temperature as shown in Fig. 3, 
depositing the element of higher density in the lower part of 
it. By combining both proposed equations, depending on 
where the type of material is located, it should be 
remembered that the proposed model is not considered as 
non-linear, all the characteristics developed throughout the 
phenomenon must be constant for a first approach with the 
operation of the refrigeration cycle and a greater 
understanding of which properties may have the greatest 
impact. 
      Fig. 4 shows the same behavior as Figure 2, but with a 
transverse view on the z-axis, divided into 9 different 
instants. Subfigures 1, 2 and 3, which are the first layers,

show a considerable decrease in internal energy. Layers 4, 5, 
6 show a higher energy, but a decrease in the lower part of 
the chamber, due to the density of the air increases when the 
temperature decreases (energy is extracted from the air by the 
evaporator).  
The red zone in Figure 4 indicates that after working at 
100%, with a total time of 12 hours (simulated), the system 
does not reach the stable state. However, with 0% thermal 
load, the system stabilizes or reaches the same, because there 
is a minimum energy exchange that is very difficult to notice 
experimentally. 
     The numerical solution of the finite volume nodes for the 
temperature determines the coldest and hottest zones in the 
refrigerator chamber, depending on the current thermal load 
ratio and its distance from the evaporator location, without 
considering the flow rate of the evaporator existing energy in 
it. 
IV. 
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 
The Fourier’s equation (proposed model) solved in finite 
differences, holds a dynamic behavior like a first order 
system for all its nodes, based on the concept of finite volume 
and the sub-node strategy. The dynamic behavior obtained 
with the experimental characterization represents a behavior 
consistent to the empirical results. 
The stabilization time of the model is in good agreement 
with the experimental results, since the model proposed in 
finite differences, in each iteration, is fed by temperature data 
at the output of the evaporator (sensor available in the 
refrigerator). However, the theoretical values of the constants 
require adjustments; to reduce the deviations in a steady state.  
Based on the results obtained from the tests, 4 critical 
zones were chosen to analyze the dynamic response due to 
the thermal load, as well as the dynamic response due to the 
speed of the compressor (Fig. 7). In each zone, the 
corresponding dynamic poles are calculated from each time 
constant. Considering the poles obtained for the 4 regions of 
the load-velocity space, the errors with respect to the 
theoretical values must be considerably reduced. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
    The presented article develops a useful mathematical 
model and the results of a Matlab codification in forms of 
graphs.  
    A strong dependence has been observed between the 
coefficients of the model (thermodynamic properties) and the 
control variables that are regulated in the refrigerator device.  
    The speed of the compressor, as well as the distribution 
and magnitude of the thermal load inside the refrigerator, are 
variables that contribute to modify the temperature evolution 
of the system. 
 
The non-linearity of the phenomenon must be considered 
when modifying the value of the poles in the model and is 
supported by the improvement of the results.
