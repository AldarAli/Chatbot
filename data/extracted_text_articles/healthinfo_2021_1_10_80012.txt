Abstract—Statistical methods and machine learning methods 
are currently the most popular ways for forecasting. Some of 
these include autoregressive models, cumulative sum charts, 
growth models, Support Vector Machines for regression (SVR), 
Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) as well as several others. 
The inherent limitation associated with these models is that they 
require large sample size for accurate forecasts. In this paper, 
we investigate the ability to forecast a disease outbreak when 
data is limited by employing variations of the Grey Model (GM) 
forecasting. Lack or limitation of data is rather common in the 
early stages of a disease outbreak. We present the results of a 
simulation that shows the model’s ability to leverage the 
exponential growth associated with the rate of spread of diseases 
in the early stages. A comparative analysis of our quantitative 
results using the coronavirus dataset of a few countries indicate 
that both the Gompertz model and the PNN model perform 
better than the traditional Grey Model GM(1,1) in fitting and 
forecasting. At the same time, qualitative evidence indicate that 
the Grey Model is suitable for early-stage epidemics provided 
methods of enhancement are employed i.e. improved 
background value calculations and better methods for 
accumulative generating operation as seen in the Fractional 
Grey Model FGM(1,1) algorithm.

INTRODUCTION 
On the 31st of December 2019, World Health 
Organization (WHO)’s country office in the people’s republic 
of China picked up a media statement by the Wuhan 
municipal health commission from their website on cases of 
viral pneumonia in Wuhan. On the 1st of January 2020, the 
WHO activated its incident management support team 
(IMST) as part of its emergency response framework. On the 
9th of January 2020, the WHO reported that the Chinese 
authorities have confirmed the outbreak of a novel 
coronavirus. It took eleven days for the confirmation of the 
outbreak of the virus. Since the official declaration of the 
novel coronavirus as a global pandemic, the world has 
witnessed an immense spread of the infection. By early 
September 2021, the virus has spread to nearly every country 
causing more than 215 million infection cases and nearly 4.5 
million deaths worldwide [1], upending lives and derailing the 
global economy. 
Accurate forecasting is one of the tools that are typically 
used to plan and mitigate risk after and during the outbreak of 
a disease. Its importance is something we have come to 
appreciate in the recent coronavirus outbreak. Unlike normal 
forecasting, epidemic forecasting exhibits traits which have 
been described in [2][3] especially when considering the 
initial period of the outbreak of a disease. This initial period 
can be identified by a sharp rise in cases where numbers are 
initially dormant. An example of this would be in cases of 
influenza, where at the beginning of the season little or no 
cases are observed, then a sudden surge in number of cases is 
observed [3]. 
There are several models, which can be employed for 
modelling and forecasting the initial stage of an epidemic. 
Examples of models used in previous studies include 
autoregressive integrated moving average, holt-winters 
multiplicative, linear regression, support vector machine for 
regression, fast decision learner, regression trees, PNNs and 
PNN+cf [4]. Other proposed models for forecasting disease 
outbreaks include generalized growth models as described in 
[5]. The problem inherent with these methods and with other 
statistical and machine learning techniques is that they require 
large datasets for higher levels of accuracy [6]. In the 
coronavirus case, it took eleven days for the virus to be 
identified as a threat and as such only eleven data points were 
available. 
Small sample set problems [7][8] refer to the cases where 
the number of samples is less than 50 in respect to engineering 
applications or less than 30 regarding academic research. Such 
small number sample size cannot fully reveal the behavior of 
a system or population [9]. There are three main approaches 
for dealing with small samples forecasting. The first 
applicable method is the Grey forecasting model. This model 
uses accumulative generation operator (AGO) of the Grey 
theory to deal with raw sample set for improving the accuracy 
of forecasting [10]. A second method is the use of Virtual 
Sample generation (VSG) [10]. This latter method fills the 
information gaps among each raw sample to stabilize the 
forecasting performance through adding newly generated 
virtual samples. Some examples include mega trend diffusion 
(MTD) [11], generalized trend diffusion (GTD) [12], genetic 
algorithm based virtual sample generation (GAVSG) [13] and 
Gaussian distribution based on VSG [14]. A particular 
limitation of this approach was highlighted in a study on the 
data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS) 
that showed that Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy error increased by 
120% and 384% respectively and the improvement on the 
classification accuracy was not significant [15]. Based on this 
result, it was concluded that the use of such technique may 
incur more damage than help especially in scenarios where

life might be on the line. A third approach for dealing with 
small sample size focuses on feature extraction. This involves 
dimension reduction whereby useful attributes or features are 
identified and selected to enhance the accuracy of the forecast. 
During the initial period of disease outbreaks, all information 
acquired should be used because information on the new 
disease is limited. The different factors which affect the spread 
of the disease might not be known and as such feature 
extraction does not seem to be a suitable approach [10]. 
Based on these findings, the aim of this paper is to 
investigate the applicability of the Grey forecasting algorithm 
(GM(1,1)) to the first take off period of the coronavirus 
outbreak. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II describes shortly the state of the art in approaches 
to forecasting applied to epidemics. Section III outlines the 
sources for the data we used for out research along with the 
reason for such a choice and a short description of the 
evaluation criteria for the assessment of the performance of 
forecasting algorithms. Section IV describes a few common 
approaches to forecasting. Section V shows the result of our 
simulations, both in graphical and tabular forms, with 
different model and data from three different countries. 
Eventually, the conclusions close the article. 
 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
Most approaches to forecasting require the use of 
statistical or machine learning models which require large 
sample size for higher levels of accuracy [6]. This fact in 
conjunction with the fact that in the early stages of epidemics 
data is limited inspired the application of the Grey system 
theory to early-stage epidemic forecasting. A great deal of 
research has been successfully conducted to verify the 
application of the Grey system theory in case of epidemics. 
However, to our knowledge, very little research has been 
carried out to compare the performance of the Grey models 
to other existing models like PNNs or Growth models. In this 
paper, we aim to shed more light on the Grey forecasting 
model in hope to better equip us to fight against future 
epidemics. 
 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we outline the sources for the data we used 
for out research along with the reason for such a choice and 
a short description of the evaluation criteria for the 
assessment of the performance of forecasting algorithms.  
A. Data Source 
Due to the novelty and the united approach society 
undertook against the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) 
pandemic, there was an ample amount of data sources. In our 
study, we rely on secondary data sources resulting in time 
saving from data collection and aggregation. We considered 
various options that were referred to by reliable sources such 
as the WHO, the European Centre for Disease, and the John 
Hopkins University. We decided to not use WHO data as they 
had shifted the timing on their reports causing overlaps in 
their data timelines. The data from the European Centre for 
Disease (ECDC) and John Hopkins data was fairly similar 
instead. Eventually we chose the data available on the ECDC 
because it included a few pre-calculated variables which 
made the dataset more complete for out study. The ECDC 
data is available on ourworldindata.org. The website and the 
data were compiled with the mindset that approaching a 
common problem together is the best way to solve it. The 
website confirms the daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and 
provides various visualizations [16].  
B. Sample  
A sample size of 10 was chosen to reflect more realistic 
situations. The WHO announced the virus’s potential after 
eleven days compared with only 6 – 8 data points used in 
other studies [4][17]. We chose the data from three specific 
countries after considering various factors like political 
influences, infrastructure capabilities, corruption, and 
coronavirus timings. Upon thorough investigation countries 
which were infected early by coronavirus appear to have been 
caught unprepared and so the data observed from such 
countries appear inconsistent and un-reliable. The three 
countries whose data we chose to use in our study are 
Albania, Haiti, and Argentina. These countries were severely 
hit by the virus after March 2021, that means at a time when 
most unaffected countries were expecting and preparing for 
the arrival of Covid-19. Ultimately, this resulted in ensuring 
an adequate reporting of cases.  
C. Evaluation Criteria 
To assess the performance of the forecasting algorithms, 
there are various criterions applicable such as the Mean 
Average Error (MAE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), 
and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). We chose 
to use the MAPE because of its more intuitive interpretation. 
D. Systematic Review 
We carried out a systematic review employing the 
PRISMA guidelines [18] to further understand the different 
components of the Grey forecasting algorithm, how to 
optimize these components to increase the forecasting 
accuracy of the Grey forecasting model. 
 
IV. 
MODELS 
In this section, we provide an overview of a few common 
approaches to forecasting, including the Grey system model 
theory, Polynomial Neural Networks, and the Gompertz 
model. 
A. Grey System Theory 
The Grey system theory works on systems with partially 
identified and partially unknown information by drawing out 
crucial information through the generation and development 
of the partially known information. It can describe correctly 
and effectively the systemic operational behavior of many 
2

systems such as social, economic, agricultural, industrial, 
ecological, and biological systems [19]. The Grey system 
theory uncovers laws of change by mining and structuring 
available raw data, thereby representing an approach of 
finding data out of data. This approach is referred to as Grey 
sequence generation. This method considers that even though 
the expression of an independent system might be complex, 
its data is chaotic. There must be some internal laws ruling 
the existence of the system and its operation. Hidden laws are 
found through the generation of Grey numbers or functions 
of sequence operator. These operators allow the Grey system 
to handle various attributes that may be present within the 
data to adequately extract the information embedded within 
the sequence. Some of these operators include buffer 
operators (e.g., weakening operator, strengthening operator), 
average generation operators, stepwise ratio generation 
operators, inverse accumulating generation operators and 
accumulating generation operators [20]. 
In most instances where the GM(1,1) algorithm has been 
applied in research, it has almost always been an enhanced 
version. The most common of enhanced parameters are 
background values and accumulative generative operators.  
Background values theoretically have two primary functions. 
The first function is to smooth the data and strip it of its 
randomness and the second is to emphasize the importance of 
the newest datum [19]. The precision and the prediction 
power of the Grey model depends on the accuracy of a few 
coefficients (called the a and b coefficients), whereby the 
values of these parameters depend on the original data 
sequence and the background value, again reflecting the 
importance of the background value. Hence by improving the 
background value, the a and b coefficients are also improved 
having a compounding effect on the accuracy and 
performance of the model. The traditional GM(1,1) models 
background value is always a default value of 0.5 which is a 
high simplification of the modelling process meaning no 
preference is given to old or new data. More realistically, the 
value of the background value coefficient should be 
calculated based on the original dataset. The Accumulative 
Generative Operational algorithm (AGO) and the Inverse 
Cumulative Generative Operational algorithm (I-AGO) are 
important parts of the Grey model algorithm and are 
responsible for reducing the variation or fluctuations of the 
original series. The problem found in the algorithms used for 
the AGO sequence generation comes from the definition of 
class ratios when creating the Grey model algorithm by 
assuming that each component of the original sequence is 
positive and the class ratio of the first AGO manipulation is 
always smaller than the class ratio of the second AGO 
manipulation [20]. This means that in some cases the first 
accumulated generating operator violates the principle of 
new information priority and principle of minimal 
information of Grey system theory. However, it can be 
proved that the condition stated above is only sufficient but 
is not a necessary one [21].  
B. Polynomial Neural Network 
A previous study investigated the early-stage epidemic 
forecasting and concluded that the best algorithm is the 
Polynomial neural networks with corrected feedback with an 
RMSE of 136 [4]. PNNs belong to a group of neural 
algorithms whose theory roots back to and is based on works 
from the early 1970s [22]. Those types of neural networks are 
“self-organizing” networks to express the fact that the 
connections between the neurons in the network are selected 
during the training phase to optimize the network. The 
number of layers in the network are also determined 
automatically to produce maximum accuracy without 
overfitting [23]. 
C. Gompertz Model 
Growth models are currently the most used methods for 
early-stage forecasting of disease outbreaks. Recently, these 
models were applied to twenty infectious disease outbreaks 
representing a range of transmission routes and a wide range 
of epidemic profiles. The outbreaks ranged from slow growth 
(sub-exponential) to fast growth (close to exponential). The 
proposed generalized growth model outperformed the other 
algorithms that it was compared to [6]. 
Growth models can be grouped into at least two main 
categories. The first group includes models without inflection 
points such as the Brody and negative models [24]. The 
second group include models with sigmoidal shape that also 
poses a fixed inflection points such as the Gompertz, the 
logistic or the von Bertalanffy models [24]. The Gompertz 
and the logistic models are the most frequently adopted 
models in literature. Given that the cumulative number of 
cases by coronavirus appears to form an asymmetrical 
sigmoidal curve, the logistic and the Gompertz model 
naturally lend themselves as ideal candidates to apply [24]. 
The Gompertz model and logistic model are both growth 
models with similar properties, making them useful for the 
representation of the generalized growth models. There has 
not been a distinct advantage found between both models as 
both require constants corresponding to upper asymptote, 
time origin, and time unit or rate [25]. But in practice, it has 
been found that the logistic model gives good fits on material 
showing an inflection about midway between the asymptotes, 
while the inflection point for the Gompertz model is about 
37%. This makes the Gompertz model more suitable for first 
take off period forecasting [25]. 
D. Average Ensemble 
Enhancing the traditional GM(1,1) algorithm can be 
achieved in multiple ways, all of which offer different 
advantages and consequently have different effects on the 
algorithm. Based on the systematic review we conducted, the 
use of multi-model approach (ensembles) turned out to be one 
of the most popular methods and proved to be the most 
suitable method to apply in this paper. There are various types 
of ensembles methods namely bagging, boosting, Adaboost, 
random forest, gradient boosting, averages etc. [26].

For the purpose of this paper, we applied the average 
ensemble to the Covid-19 dataset in order to demonstrate the 
application of one of the methods of enhancement. Using the 
average of forecasts is one of the simple but effective 
methods of ensembles. Previous studies [27] suggest that 
using averages of forecasts provides improved forecasting 
accuracy and that the variability of accuracy among different 
combinations decreases, as the number of methods in the 
average increases. Similar earlier studies also indicate that, in 
some cases, the simple average ensemble can outperform its 
weighted average counterpart [28]. 
In the next section, we show the forecasting results we 
obtained using the coronavirus dataset of Albania, Argentina, 
and Haiti. The biggest influence on the countries chosen is 
the quality of data generated. Upon thorough observations of 
the data, countries like China who were hit early by the virus 
seem to have been un-prepared meaning the necessary 
actions required to adequately record and publish the 
coronavirus numbers were not in place and so countries 
which contracted coronavirus after March 2020 were chosen 
as their published data appear more reliable and consistent. 
 
V. 
RESULTS 
In this section we show the result of our simulations with 
different model for a few selected countries. 
A. Albania Forecast 
Figure 1 shows how well each model describes the 
Albania dataset and forecasts the Covid-19 cases. The y axis 
shows the number of cases while the x axis shows the days 
that have elapsed. The red line shows the actual data. The 
other lines show the fit and forecast for the models we chose 
to employ, namely the GM(1,1), the Gompertz, the PNN, and 
the ensemble model. The graphics indicates that the best 
models for the Albania dataset are the Gompertz model and 
the PNN while the GM(1,1) appears to be the worst fitting 
one. Table I  shows the MAPE values for all models we 
considered in out simulations when the data for Argentina 
was used.

Argentina. The y axis shows the number of cases while the x 
axis shows the days that have elapsed. Again, the red line 
shows the actual data available for Argentina. The GM(1,1) 
seems to forecast very high values, which is clear when 
observing the purple and the red line. The best performing 
model in this case appears indistinguishable but this can be 
explained by comparing the MAPE values as seen in Table 
II.

appears to have a particularly good fit for the data set, but 
aside from this, it can be difficult to distinguish and 
discriminate using this graph only. Table III outlines the 
MAPE values and thus can provide a clearer understanding 
on model accuracy for the data related to Haiti.

As already mentioned, the MAPE values give a better 
intuitive understanding of forecast accuracy. Overall, the 
Gompertz models and the PNN both perform equally well on 
different datasets suggesting the need for further tests using 
other datasets. The GM(1,1) consistently performed as the 
worst. While the ensemble was implemented to show the 
potential for improving the GM(1,1), the improvement can be 
attributed to the outstanding performance of the Gompertz 
model. 
D. Systematic Review 
These results from the experiments initiated an 
investigation into the methods which the Grey forecasting 
model’s parameters could be optimized to provide better 
accuracy. From the studies that we reviewed systematically, 
38% improved the background value of the Grey forecasting 
model, 23% used a multi-model approach similar to an 
ensemble while 15% enhanced the Grey forecasting model 
GM(1,1) by improving the accumulative generating 
operation mechanism, other methods employed including the 
use of Virtual sample generation (VSG), parameter 
optimization, and finally the diffusion models. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The comparison of the GM(1,1) forecasting algorithm to 
the PNN and Gompertz model against the datasets showed 
that the traditional GM(1,1) algorithm was not able to match 
the forecasting capabilities of the Gompertz and PNN model. 
This result was unexpected but has been attributed to the sub-
exponential nature of the dataset and the hidden 
nonoptimized parameters within the GM(1,1) algorithm. 
While we see that the enhanced ensemble GM(1,1) algorithm 
performs better in comparison to the traditional GM(1,1), 
enhanced GM(1,1) models which optimize the parameters 
within the GM(1,1) model itself have immense potential in 
the forecasting of early stage epidemic forecasting. 
The preliminary conclusions of this paper are confirmed in 
a separate research study by Liu and colleagues [29]. Liu uses 
fractional Grey model FGM(1,1) that is an enhanced version 
of the traditional forecasting model GM(1,1) by using a 
fractional order accumulation. Liu’s FGM(1,1) model can 
better adhere to the principle of new information priority and 
was applied to forecast the first take off period of Covid-19 
with good results. In another study [30], the GM(1,1) model 
was also applied to and compared with other modifications 
such as the non-linear Grey Bernoulli model (NGBM(1,1) 
and the FGM(1,1) model to long term cumulative forecasting 
of the Covid-19 epidemic cases in UK, USA and Italy. The 
values of root mean square error, absolute percentage error 
(APE) and R2 values for GM (1,1), NGBM (1,1) and 
fractional accumulative nonlinear Grey Bernoulli model 
(FANGBM(1,1)) for the prediction of the cumulative cases 
of Covid-19 indicate that the FANGBM is the most accurate 
with the highest R2 and lowest RMSE and APE values.  
Based on all this evidence, the aim of this paper to confirm 
the applicability of Grey forecasting model to forecast early-
stage epidemic cases has been achieved.
