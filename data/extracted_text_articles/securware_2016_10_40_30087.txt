Abstract — The quality of power-line nets is very closely
related to electromagnetic compatibility, so several quality
parameters need to be evaluated to take this into consideration.
Quality parameters are generally measured with the help of
analyzer
devices.
There
are
standard
quantities
and
parameters - as well as special data relating to the metering of
dynamic
behavior
consumption,
or
harmonic
frequency
actions, etc. The basic parameters are analyzed in accordance
to the different factors and coefficients of active and reactive
processes. Electromagnetic Compatibility Evaluation makes
use of results gained from the analysis of power-line quality.
The electromagnetic compatibility evaluation results are then
more accurate and predictive regarding the actual state and its
influence
over
a
distribution
network
from
third-party
consumption.
This
ensures
that
reliable
operations
to
consumers are maintained and that any negative interaction of
the supply network is minimalized.

INTRODUCTION
Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (further only EMC) is a
significant system for the preservation of power-line nets and
their operations, for immunity and for the economy of states.
Its determination and observance is subject to lawful
procurement and standards [1] [10]-[14][16].
The term “power-line quality” is involved in several
heterogeneous areas of the distribution network structures
connected to appliances that demand energy. The user is
closely linked to EMC problems, and the solutions require
specific access to low-net frequency (50 Hz and harmonics)
and to heavy currents and strong magnetic fields [2][3].
The stability of power-line parameters within tolerance
limits is given by legal regulations and standards which
provide
for
electric-power
distribution
in
transmission
systems. The energy consumer generally influences issues by
connecting to a network - according to the kind and type of
arrangement back to a distribution network and next - other
neighboring consumers [4].
EMC deals with the ability of each electric or electronic
device to work, fault-free, in an electromagnetic field (i.e.
electromagnetic
susceptibility)
and
do
not
generate
a
disturbance field into its surroundings (i.e. electromagnetic
interference).
The problem of EMC
is ever-more topical as a
consequence of the extensive use of low-current electronic
devices on one hand, while, on the other hand, there are ever
more numbers of power-semiconductor converters that
generate
interferential
disturbances.
These
disturbances
extend through space and in the ambient environment. The
rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II presents
basic power-lines parameters. The following sections address
interactions in a power line, periodic voltage fluctuation,
voltage asymmetry, harmonics and, finally, power line
quality measurement.
II.
POWER-LINE NET PARAMETERS
The basic parameters of a power-line network include:
• 
Supply frequency
• 
Net voltage
• 
Supply network voltage difference
• 
Rapid dynamic voltage changes
• 
Short-term voltage drops
• 
Power-line voltage asymmetry
• 
Harmonic and inter-harmonic voltage
• 
Short-term or long-term breaks in power supply
• 
Overvoltage between live conductor and earth
The measured values for each parameter have Root Mean
Square (RMS) data, peak data, and given-limit data. The
limit data relates to the agreements or contracts between
partners. Frequency and voltage parameters are system data
based on the distribution system and supply demands. The
electrical energy power producers assure these parameters at
the production point [5][8].

switches) or electrical-devices (e.g. sources, LV consumers,
automation elements, light sources, etc.). An EMI source can
also be a system that produces electrostatic charges. Other
specific
EMI
sources
include
radio
and
television
transmissions, wireless communications and nets [9].
The coupling between EMI elements is realized by cable
as a galvanic structure, or in capacitive or inductive structure
environments. A general view of EMI is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1.
EMI Inter-connection Scheme
The retro-interaction of a connected consumer is always
displayed in a real supply network. The current consumption
from nets causes voltage change at impedances over time
and according to the connection distance. These processes
have a stochastic character. A chart showing supply network
and consumer connections is shown in Figure 1 [5]-[7].
For example, it is possible to show this in the incidence
of disturbing influences from light sources. All sources
except light bulbs without regulation react specifically,
according to the time behavior of voltage in the network. The
process is represented by the following characteristics: the
effective value of the voltage; its drift; and changes in the
harmonics and inter-harmonics of voltage; etc.
IV.
PERIODIC VOLTAGE FLUCTUATION
Periodic Voltage Fluctuation over a longer time-frame is
called flicker. It is visible - without measurement, in light
sources - displayed as optic reception alterations.
Flicker is induced in appliances by switching on some
big power-loading, by starting-up some heavy-duty motors,
by some form of variable power-loading, or by dynamic
behavior at current consumption levels.
Flicker is also negatively expressed as a magnetic
arrangement, when it can shut-off switch elements. Its
negative incidence and disturbances are also displayed in the
information technology arrangements, or by computation
techniques, or measurement and actuator techniques.
V.
VOLTAGE ASYMMETRY
Multi-phase systems use an Asymmetry Classification
system. Asymmetry means that all three voltage and currents
phases have the same amplitude and the phase shift is 120°.
This is valid for a system where effective pressure is
associated with tension between successive phased tensions.
In order to classify asymmetry, there is a need to speculate
about the partition of a system into consecutive (d),
backward (e) and zero (h) systems.
The main source of asymmetry is the asymmetry of
current-loading. There are many appliances that draw heavy
power-loads from one or two phases and on the high voltage
side (e.g., train traction, electrical ovens).
Low-voltage
loading is usually single-phase and here, the situation is
without guarantee of asymmetry.
VI.
HARMONICS
The harmonic frequencies for EMC in a power-line
network can be observed up to the fiftieth harmonics scale.
Inception of harmonics is an arrangement which distorts the
sinusoidal wave. Devices - such as frequency converters
rectifiers and units that transact phase-angle control of sinus
traces induce a very strong rise in harmonics and have a very
strong influence that is possible to follow for the third
harmonics scale (150 Hz), the fifth (250 Hz) scale, and the
seventh harmonic scale (350 Hz) [5][6][8]-[11].

Voltage spikes and related disturbances are negative and
have backward effects on the power-line network from the
harmonics. Different processes are the source of harmonics
and at the connection point of devices. The harmonic
currents flow from a nonlinear arrangement to the networks
and change the impedance of the network.

POWER-LINE QUALITY MEASUREMENT
A demo-measurement was performed using a FLUKE
437 device [12].
The wiring of the device for a three-phase system is
shown in Figure 2. It is possible to parameterize this to
various kinds of networks (e.g.TN S, TN C).
Measurement is performed using an embedded micro-
computer system, programmed for the automatic metering of
concrete functions.
Figure 2.
Scheme of connection on a three-phase network
The basic metering is transformed using algorithms for
the parameters mentioned below:
•
The measurement time-window (Tw) is 10/12 cycles in
accord with the frequency - (i.e. 50/60 Hz), IEC 61000-
4-30
•
It uses 5 samples per 10 cycles
•
The sampling of metering using a Fluke 437 device is
100 kHz (10 mm), and is derived from the frequency of
sinusoids.
•
The accuracy of measurements is for voltage of 0.1%
from Vnom for a near entrance; for a current of 0.5% out
of the read values
•
The resolution is 0.01V; for flows within an i430flex
TF cable is 1x 1A; for 10x greater sensitivity, it is 0.1A
•
A 16-bit ADC on 8 channels is employed
•
The frequency accuracy and resolution is 90.001 cps

machine as an inductance appliance.

CONCLUSION
This contribution shows the significance and impacts of
connections with power-line quality. It presents all the
problems that it solves – i.e. common main problems like for
instance – the generation of harmonics, and the impacts of
fast changes – i.e. “flicker” and “voltage asymmetry”. It also
goes on to show examples of the measurement of power-line
quality by the help of modern devices - for three sample
appliances. At the same time, there is an accent on the
structure relating to electromagnetic compatibility questions.
