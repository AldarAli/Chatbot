Abstract—During the work carried out, measurements were 
taken by a local GPS network. It was the primary pre-
processing and interpretation of the data network for the city 
of Almaty. The investigation had been carried to find the 
velocity field of modern movements of the Earth's surface 
according to the GNSS-service. All the GPS-data were 
processed by the software package GAMIT/GLOBK.

 INTRODUCTION 
Deformation of the Earth's surface on the territories of 
large cities occurs very often. The main reason is the 
growing demand of high-rise buildings, the intensive 
development of underground space, hydro-mode system 
violations and finally vibration impacts. In some areas of 
Almaty, the level of impact on the geological structures is 
already approaching a critical point. This means that the 
number of destructions will increase dramatically due to any 
deformations of the Earth’s surface.  
Organization of a geodesic effective monitoring system 
of major cities is possible with high precision satellite 
methods. This allows almost continuous monitoring in a 
variety of geographical conditions to observe a certain strain 
down to millimeter level accuracy [1-4]. These studies were 
conducted for the first time in the territory of Almaty city. 
II. 
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
The goal of this work is to study the velocity of modern 
movements of the Earth’s surface by GNSS-measurements 
data for the region of Almaty. 
On the basis of the known geological conditions, taking 
into account the differences, a priori data was compiled 
which preliminary was used for observing the network for 
the Almaty region. Research showed that it is the stochastic 
network with distribution points which is the most 
appropriate solution for this region. We have relied on the 
size of the foundation block structures that may have a major 
impact on the surface deformation processes in case of their 
mutual relative movements during strong earthquakes.  
There are several kilometers between large faults when 
we consider the Earth’s crust depth is about 3 km. 
The network is split over the Almaty region with 
insignificant deviations beyond its limits (Figure 1) and 
consists of 14 observation points (Table I). The expected 
results are maps of modern movements in the territory of 
Almaty city.

METHOD 
Not being able to organize a network of GPS-
synchronized observations in the city, there were a restricted 
series of successive observations using one receiving station. 
Measurements are held periodically by each of the points 
using a Leica GRX 1200 GG Pro receiver, twice a year. The 
duration of recording satellite signals at one point is 48 hours 
in a continuous mode with intervals of 30 seconds which was 
adopted by regulations. Per one session, each point worked 
about 48 hours and produced 5720 independent acts of 
registration. This gives an opportunity for further processing

to increase the ratio of signal/random noise in the square root 
of this number (about 76 times). 
GPS - measurements was conducted since 2010 to the 
present time. GAMIT / GLOBK software package is used for 
pre-processing GPS data [7]. 
During calculations of a priori coordinates and velocities 
of points, a priori data of the Earth's rotation and orbital data 
generate a single integrated set that must be internally 
consistent. Imposition of severe restrictions on any of these 
parameters for a regional solution can deform the system. In 
order to prevent such action restriction, a priori coordinate, 
the speed, the parameters of orbit satellite and the Earth's 
rotation in the solution should not be rigid. However, that 
decision could shift or collapse the entire system of points 
and/or their velocactionity vectors. Stabilization allowing to 
define reference system by minimizing the deviation of the 
resulting solution which was obtained as the result of a 
decision using the a priori coordinates and velocities for a set 
of well-defined stations. The iterative scheme of stabilization 
automatically excludes measurements points, for which 
coordinates have large deviations. The velocity fields of the 
region are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The rest of the time points 
are not very accurately measured [4-6]. 
The permanent station SELE, part of the global network 
IGS, has an error about 0.1 mm / year. The rest of the time 
points are not very accurate measurements. This shows that 
is necessary to conduct special works to reduce the errors in 
the city network stations to the order of 1-2 mm/year.  
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
For the study of modern movements of the Earth's crust 
of Almaty, was built a local network and data collection 
from 2011 to 2012. 
The first study which was conducted in the city of 
Almaty showed that within urbanized areas such work is 
possible and necessary. The main advantage of working with 
such a system is the possibility of rate parameters 
simultaneously in three mutually orthogonal components, 
characterized by significant variations during the year. 
The errors of international IGS stations in the pre-
processing were about- 0.5-2 mm/year, and the local points 
showing the error of 5-20 mm/year. 
Errors are likely due to the small number of independent 
observations in temporary settlements, due to the inability to 
organize continuous monitoring because of the absence in 
receiver numbers and transportation problems.  
During two years of follow up in urban areas, set features 
significant movement of surface points about 3- 25 mm/year. 
The conclusion shows that it is necessary to observe 
simultaneous points, then moving receivers to other items 
with overlapping observation systems. 
To ensure the high quality of the primary data monitoring 
it is necessary to choose points of global network stations 
(IGS) with following control of the data quality.
