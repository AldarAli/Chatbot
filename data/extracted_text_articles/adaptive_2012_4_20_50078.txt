Abstract— This paper deals with the design of an interval 
observer for estimation of some state variables in an uncertain 
biotechnological process. The observer is applied to estimate 
the biomass concentration in an anaerobic bioprocess with a 
simplified mathematical model. In this approach only the 
bounds of the biomass concentration and the synthesis product 
concentration can be estimated by using appropriately 
designed interval observer. Based on this observer a robust-
adaptive control strategy of a substrate inside the reactor is 
proposed. The performance of the proposed adaptive control 
strategy is illustrated by numerical simulations applied in the 
case of an anaerobic bioprocess for which kinetic dynamics are 
highly nonlinear, time-varying and incompletely known. 
Keywords- interval observer; adaptive control; wastewater 
treatment bioprocess; biomass estimation. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the case of biotechnological processes, a frequent and 
important challenge is finding adequate and reliable sensors 
to measure all important state variables of the plant. 
Nowadays, there are a number of on-line sensors able to 
provide state information, but they are very expensive and 
their maintenance is usually time consuming [1].  
Furthermore, the biological systems contain living 
organisms that are not perfectly described by the physical 
laws, are strongly nonlinear, and they have poorly 
understood dynamics. This is one strong motivation for using 
robust methods for the control of this type of systems and for 
the estimation of the variables that are not measured [2]. By 
using control methods for the processes in the living 
organisms, the engineering motivation is to achieve better 
operational stability and production efficiency [3].  
As biotechnological processes have gained an increasing 
importance in everyday life, a series of observers for 
nonlinear biological processes have been proposed, that can 
be chosen in accordance with the information available on 
the model that is being used [4]. 
In the last decade, the optimization of this kind of 
processes and mainly of wastewater treatment receives 
increased attention. The scientists are interested of designing 
new control strategies that guarantee a better process 
working and efficiency. However, these controllers often 
require high quality measurements or efficient state 
estimation procedures [10]. 
If a high gain observer is used for obtaining a good 
estimation of the internal state, the availability of a good 
model is necessary [3]. 
If in the parameters model is a large number of 
uncertainties, the best option is to use an interval observer, 
because this method provides an estimate of the quality [1]. 
Starting from the determination of the control law, we 
continued by considering all the states in the system known, 
in order to see how this is acting in open loop, and then in 
close loop. 
Then, we considered that the process model was not 
completely known, and we proceeded to make estimations 
for unknown parameters. 
The traditional control design involves complicated 
mathematical analysis and has difficulties in controlling 
highly nonlinear and time varying plants as well. A powerful 
tool for nonlinear controller design is the feedback 
linearization [5], but its use requires the complete knowledge 
of the process. In practice, there are many processes 
described by highly nonlinear dynamics; thus an accurate 
model for these processes is difficult to develop. Therefore, 
in recent years, great progress in development of adaptive 
and robust adaptive controllers has been noticed, due to their 
ability to compensate for both parametric uncertainties and 
process parameter variations. An important assumption in 
previous works on nonlinear adaptive control was the linear 
dependence on the unknown parameters [5]. 
Adaptive controllers have a strong advantage to the 
classical PID controller by the fact that can eliminate errors 
faster and with significantly reduce fluctuations. This 
advantage allows the process to have a higher profitability 
[9]. An important disadvantage of adaptive controllers is the 
requirement of a technical expertise for understanding how 
they can be fixed if they fail [9]. 
This paper is divided in five sections: in Section II, the 
mathematical model of a de-pollution process is described; 
Section III presents an adaptive control strategy, Section IV 
is dedicated to the formulation of an interval observer, and 
Section V concludes the paper. 
II. 
MATHEMATICAL MODEL 
Pollution can be defined by the modification of the 
physical, chemical and biological components which is 
damaging for the human beings and for the environment.

Pollution is obtained by adding pollutants in the environment 
[6].  
In the last few years, the importance of biotechnology 
and of automatic control for de-pollution processes is 
permanently growing [6].  
In this paper, we consider a process described by the 
following reaction [6]:

In equation (1), the following symbols appear:

S – Substrate concentration [g/l] 
P – Synthesis product concentration [g/l] 
r – reaction rate that is defined by the equation: 
S P X
r
 ( , )
 
This model is a very simple one, because only one main 
bacterial population is considered. 
This is a prototype of the de-pollution bioprocesses 
whose dynamic model is described by the equations [6].

In figure 1, a possible form for the real feed substrate is 
presented. Because we don’t know anything about the real 
shape of feed substrate evolution, we can choose any form 
that is placed in a bounded domain ranges between the two 
limits: an inferior limit denoted by 

Sin
 and a superior limit 
denoted by 

Sin
. Because of only this limits of the feed 
substrate concentration must to be known, the shape of real 
feed substrate can be completely random. 
The real feed substrate concentration in Fig. 1 is also 
corrupted with an additive white noise with zero average 
(5% from their nominal values). 
III. 
CONTROL STRATEGIES  
A. Control Objective 
 
The control objective consists in the adjustment of the 
system in order reduce the level of pollution in the 
wastewater. To be exact, considering that the process model 
(2)-(4) is incompletely known, its parameters are time 
varying and not all the states are available for the 
measurements, the control goal is to maintain the process at 
some operating points, which correspond to a minimal 
pollution rate [7].  
We have chosen that the operating point is best to be kept 
around the point 
S*  35

B. Exactly Linearizing Feedback Controller 
 
First, we want to evaluate the ideal case where all the 
knowledge 
concerning 
the 
process 
(kinetics, 
yield 
coefficients and state variables) is available [14].

Let us consider a closed loop system whose dynamics are 
in accordance with a stable first order linear system, which 
is described by the equation below [15]:

Because in real experiments some states are not available 
for on-line measurements, in Section IV, we will estimate the 
biomass concentration using an interval observer. This 
means that the biomass concentration is only defined by its 
superior and inferior bounds. Since the control law (9) 
depends on X  this becomes an adaptive control law 
described by the following equation:

IV. 
INTERVAL OBSERVERS  
Over the last ten years, a series of techniques were 
developed from which we mention: state estimation by 
means of convex sets, interval observers and bounded error 
estimators using interval analysis [2]. 
Interval observers provide state limits that will be 
estimated: the upper bound of the state vector provided by 
the upper observer, and a lower bound determined by the 
lower observer [3]. 
Interval observers were introduced in a general context 
by using the concept of framer, which is definite as a unique 
pair of estimates able to provide uncertain state limits, 
without taking into consideration any stability constraint [5].  
Interval observers are based on positive differential 
systems and offer a way to deal with uncertainty in the 
system, when known bounds of the uncertain terms are 
available [5]. 
Note that in this process the feed substrate concentration 
Sin can be considered a disturbance whose exact values are 
not compulsory to be known, but, in the same time the values 
of Sin can vary between two known limits (an upper limit 
denoted with ―+‖ and a lower limit denoted with ―–‖ ). 
Knowing these two limits we attempt to estimate all the 
other immeasurable state variables in model (3) by using all 
available information. 
Therefore in the following we consider that the condition

To estimate the values of the biomass concentration X1 
and the synthesis product concentration P, first we introduce 
the following two additional variables [8]:

that are independent of the process kinetics that could be 
completely unknown. 
Because Sin is known only by its upper and lower limit, 
we can observe that in equations (13), (14), the additional 
values z1, and z2, can only be determined by their upper and 
lower limit values. For this reason, the real values of X1 and 
P are located in an interval that is bound by these 
parameters’ limits.

The simulations have been carried out using the model 
comprised of the equations (2) – (4), considering that the 
process lasts for 180 hours and that the input concentrations 
are in a guaranteed interval. 
The performance of designed interval observers (15)-(16) 
has been tested by performing extensive simulation 
experiments. The simulations were carried out by using the 
process model (2) – (4) under identical and realistic 
conditions. 
In figure 3 and figure 4, the graphics marked with 
continuous line correspond to values of real concentration of 
Sin, as it should be known while the graphics marked with 
dotted and interrupt lines correspond respectively to known 
upper and lower limits of Sin. 
Using different shapes of feed substrate concentration 
that are included between two known limits, it can be seen 
that the behaviour of the proposed interval observers are 
good, the values of the estimated biomass X1 and of the 
synthesis product P remaining between the limits determined 
from equations (15) and (16). 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an interval observer for estimation of some 
uncertain state variables in an uncertain biotechnological 
process was designed. Using an interval observer only an 
upper and a lower bound of the biomass concentration and 
the synthesis product concentration can be estimated by 
using an appropriately interval observer. The designed 
observer was used in an adaptive control problem of a 
substrate inside a bioreactor.  
The effectiveness and performance of the designed 
interval observers as well as of the adaptive control strategy 
were illustrated by numerical simulations applied in the case 
of an anaerobic bioprocess.
