Abstract—Heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse rate 
variability (PRV) are used as meaningful indicator of 
cardiovascular circulation assessment. However, both HRV and 
PRV are limited by the timescale of the heart beat and pulse 
wave series. Recently, a novel adaptive method based on 
Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), named instantaneous pulse 
rate variability (iPRV), was proposed. It provides a new 
indication, called very high frequency band (VHF; 0.4-0.8Hz) 
for the neural regulatory estimation and peripheral responses. 
Ten 
healthy 
subjects 
participated 
this 
study 
and 
photoplethysmography (PPG) signal was recorded in supine 
baseline and during head-up tilt (HUT) and passive leg raising 
(PLR). The results showed that the spectral power of VHF 
decreased during HUT and increased during PLR, which might 
present the compensated regulation of venous return and fluid 
responsiveness. This study showed that VHF index has potential 
to indicate the fluid responsiveness and provides the meaningful 
information for homecare application, which only requires the 
simple PPG measurement.

 INTRODUCTION  
Autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates the 
homeostasis of body system, including heart beat rhythm. 
Previous studies showed that the variability of heart rate, 
named heart rate variability (HRV), presents the ANS 
activities within specific frequency band. Heart rate variability 
is widely used as a meaningful indicator of cardiovascular 
circulation assessment in clinic. However, HRV studies are 
restricted by the feasibility and the reproducibility with 
inconvenient measurement [1].  
A substitute measurement of HRV was proposed, named 
pulse rate variability (PRV). Gil’s study examined that PRV 
is as a surrogate of HRV during non-stationary conditions [2]. 
But both HRV and PRV are limited by the timescale of the 
heart beat and the series of pulse wave time intervals. 
Recently, a novel adaptive method, named instantaneous 
pulse rate variability (iPRV), was proposed [3]. It adopted 
PRV technique and applied the frequency range extension 
method based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [4]. 
Hilbert-Huang transform is a data-processing technique which 
can deal with non-stationary and nonlinear data owing to its 
preprocess, called empirical mode decomposition (EMD). 
However, the intermittency phenomenon, called mode-
mixing problem, is involved in EMD. The mode-mixing 
problem was eliminated by noise-assisted technique, known 
as ensemble EMD (EEMD) [5]. It provides a reliable indicator 
for ANS assessment and, furthermore, breakthroughs the 
limitation of beat-to-beat series spectral analysis. It provides a 
new indication, called very high frequency band (VHF; 0.4-
0.8Hz) for the neural regulatory estimation and peripheral 
responses. The literature has examined that iPRV is reliable 
by using photoplethysmography (PPG) during non-stationary 
condition, such as head-up tilt (HUT) [6]. But its 
interpretation of VHF indication still needs further exploration 
and examination. It had been examined that VHF of HRV is 
as a novel index of left ventricular function evaluation [7], 
which further indicates the cardiac function, venous return, 
and fluid responsiveness. There is a common clinical 
experiment, named passive leg raising (PLR), which induces 
the increase of venous return and helps for the quantitative 
assessment of fluid responsiveness [8].

The aim of this study is to examine the neural regulatory 
estimation and fluid responsiveness of iPRV on VHF during 
non-stationary condition, such as HUT and PLR.  
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The 
next section presents data collection and introduces the iPRV 
analysis. Section III illustrates the results of iPRV spectrum. 
Section IV provides the discussion about mechanism of the 
VHF indication in iPRV. Conclusion is given in the last 
section.

METHODS 
A. Subjects and data collection 
All measurements were performed in a quiet temperature 
controlled room and the experiment was approved by 
institutional review board of the hospital. Ten healthy subjects 
(male: 5; age: 24±1) participated this study. The PPG signal 
was recorded by Nonin 8500 (Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, 
MN) with a sampling frequency 200Hz. All recruited subjects 
performed four trials in whole experiment. First, subjects were 
rest in supine position with 10-minute recording as baseline. 
Second, subjects were tilting up passively (HUT) on the 
automatic tilting table and kept in tilt-up position for 10 
minutes. Then, subjects were back to the supine position with 
5 minutes for recovering to baseline. Finally, subjects were 
raising leg passively (PLR) for 10 minutes. This study was 
approved by institutional review board of Tungs’ Taichung 
Metro Harbor Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from 
all participants before the experiment. 
B. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition 
EMD extracts components by several steps. First, EMD 
performs an iteratively detrending operation, named sifting 
process. The sifting process is based on energy-associated 
extraction in each timescale, which determined by the local 
extrema. Local extrema of data 𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡) are identified by peak-
valley detection. The upper envelope 𝑈𝑈(𝑡𝑡)  and lower 
envelope 𝐿𝐿(𝑡𝑡) are generated by cubic spline interpolation 
according to the local maxima and local minima. The trend in 
current timescale is computed by calculating the mean of 𝑈𝑈(𝑡𝑡) 
and 𝐿𝐿(𝑡𝑡), as 𝑀𝑀(𝑡𝑡). 
 
𝑀𝑀(𝑡𝑡) = (𝑈𝑈(𝑡𝑡) + 𝐿𝐿(𝑡𝑡))/2 
(1) 
The original data 𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡) subtracts the trend, as detrending 
operation. 
 
ℎ1(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑀𝑀(𝑡𝑡) 
(2) 
After 𝑘𝑘 times iteratively detrending operation, if the trend 
of ℎ𝑘𝑘(𝑡𝑡) satisfies the criterion as the steady constant trend, 
then the components ℎ𝑘𝑘(𝑡𝑡) were extracted from 𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡), called 
intrinsic mode function (IMF). After 𝑛𝑛 sifting process, 𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡) 
was decomposed into 𝑛𝑛 IMFs, 𝐼𝐼𝑀𝑀𝐼𝐼1(𝑡𝑡)~𝐼𝐼𝑀𝑀𝐼𝐼𝑛𝑛(𝑡𝑡), and one 
residue 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡).  
 
𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡) = ∑
𝐼𝐼𝑀𝑀𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖
𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1
(𝑡𝑡) + 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡) 
(3) 
The EMD decomposes data into IMFs without 
information loss or distortion, but it contains mode-mixing 
problem. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition eliminates 
this phenomenon by noise-assisted technique [5]. The 
ensemble 
IMFs 
are 
computed 
by 
averaging 
each 
corresponding IMF decomposed from different mixtures of 
added noise and source data. This study used EEMD for the 
PPG signal decomposition as feature extraction method. 
C. Instantaneous pulse rate variability 
The iPRV analysis contains several steps as follows 
(Figure 1). First, the blood pulse signal was extracted from 
PPG signal as one of the IMFs by using EEMD. Second, the 
instantaneous period of the blood pulse signals were 
calculated by normalized Hilbert transform (NHT) [9]. Finally, 
fast Fourier transform was performed as the spectral analysis 
of instantaneous period. The spectral power of low frequency 
(LF; 0.04-0.15Hz), high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.4Hz), and 
VHF (0.4-0.8Hz) were calculated by spectral integration as 
the clinical indicators. The spectral analysis programs in this 
study was developed by using commercial software platform 
(LabVIEW version 2013, National Instruments Corp., Austin, 
USA).

Table I and illustrated in Figure 2 in one of the subjects as an 
example. The results of all participants’ iPRV spectrum were 
similar with subtle change of the frequency peaks’ locations. 
The power of LF increased both in HUT and PLR. The power 
of HF decreased during HUT and increase during PLR. The

power of VHF decreased in HUT and increased during PLR. 
The relevant features were observed in the corresponding 
spectrum in Figure 2. The locations of the major spectral 
peaks were found around similar locations with those in iPRV

DISCUSSION 
It had been examined that the reliable iPRV spectrum can 
be assessed by PPG signal [6] and the new indicator (VHF) 
can be assessed through iPRV spectrum. Though some 
literatures investigated that VHF of HRV is a reliable 
evaluation of left ventricular function [7], VHF of iPRV still 
needs further examination. It had been examined that VHF 
contains parasympathetic activities and peripheral responses, 
which are influenced by venous return and cardiac function. 
The influences of respiration on VHF were examined by 
paced respiration study [10]. The mechanism of the VHF 
indication needs more exploration.  
This study performed the clinical experiment, known as 
HUT and PLR, for the further examination. HUT causes 
temporarily decrease of blood volume in upper body and then 
causes the decrease of venous return. These changes induce 
the auto-regulation for the compensation. The sympathetic 
activities increased during HUT, and the power of LF also 
increased, which quantitatively assessed the sympathetic 
activation. On the other hand, the parasympathetic activities 
decreased, and so did the power of HF and VHF. 
PLR causes the increase of blood volume in upper body 
and then causes the increase of venous return. The cardiac 
function was increased temporarily and induces the peripheral 
fluid responsiveness. These changes induced the regulation 
mechanism for the compensation. The parasympathetic 
activities increased during PLR and the power of HF and VHF 
also increased. The results showed that VHF has potential to 
indicate the relevant change of venous return and monitor the 
fluid responsiveness, which can be used in homecare 
monitoring. 
Though VHF provides much more information of auto-
regulation and has potential to indicate the parasympathetic 
activities and fluid responsiveness. It has several limitations 
as follows. First, the success of iPRV analysis is mainly 
depends on the waveform integrity of the PPG signal, which 
is sensitive and easy to be influenced by body movement and 
unstable measurement. Second, the EEMD of iPRV contains 
large computational power and causes huge time consumption, 
which means that it is hard to be applied as real-time 
application by recent technique. Third, the results in this study 
depend on ten healthy participants, and the population study 
needs to be performed for further examination, which is 
undergoing currently. Furthermore, VHF index should be 
examined with different group of subjects , such as not healthy 
people by using iPRV in future. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This study showed that the iPRV spectrum can be assessed 
by simple PPG measurement, which is suitable for homecare 
application, and the reliable VHF can be estimated by iPRV 
analysis. The power of VHF decreased during HUT and 
increased during PLR. The results showed the potential 
usefulness of VHF indication in venous return and fluid 
responsiveness.
