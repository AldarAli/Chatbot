Abstract—This paper presents the possibility of using RSSI 
readings to monitor a single IEEE 802.15.4 channel in the 2.4 
GHz ISM band. An overview of the main sources of 
interference - namely Wireless Local Area Networks 
(WLANs), Bluetooth devices and microwave ovens - is given. 
Finally, an algorithm to classify one second of RSSI readings 
into one of these device classes is presented. The algorithm 
classifies 762 of 790 samples (96.46 %) correctly, having its 
worst precision with 97.41 % for the Bluetooth device class and 
its worst recall/sensitivity with 84.21 % for the microwave oven 
class. This algorithm gives an overview of interfering wireless 
devices without the need of changing the channel and thus 
allowing a continuous message reception.

 INTRODUCTION 
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are small, embedded, 
in-expensive, low-power networks that are going to be 
widely deployed in the near future. They can be used in 
many applications in homes, offices and all sorts of urban 
environments. Today’s most suitable wireless transfer 
technologies for WSNs are based on the IEEE 802.15.4 
standard [1], since it provides a simple, low-power stack for 
the Physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) Layer. The 
IEEE 802.15.4 (2003) standard can physically operate in the 
three free Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency 
bands offering 27 channels: one at 868 MHz, ten in the 915 
MHz band and 16 in the 2.4 GHz band. The only frequency 
band available worldwide is 2.4 GHz, which is the most used 
ISM band, utilized by many technologies and therefore the 
band is crowded [2]. Since wireless sensor nodes are power-
constrained, 
energy 
saving 
by 
means 
of 
avoiding 
retransmissions or unnecessary on-times of the radio is an 
important task. Finding sources of interference allows 
avoiding collisions and therefore retransmissions can be 
reduced. This helps to have more reliable and energy 
efficient WSNs. 
In the following section, a discussion of related work is 
given. Then the properties of Radio Signal Strength Indicator 
(RSSI) values are presented. Afterwards, the common 
sources of interference in WSNs are described, namely: 
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Bluetooth devices 
(BT) and microwave ovens (MWOs). For each device class, 
a short summary is given and then meaningful features for 
the detection are highlighted. Based on that, an algorithm is 
developed to identify the just mentioned device classes by 
RSSI readings of a single WSN channel. Subsequently, an 
evaluation and discussion of the algorithm is given. The 
paper ends with conclusions showing the potential fields of 
application for this work.

RELATED WORK 
The coexistence of IEEE 802.15.4 with other IEEE 
standards has already been partly considered in the standard 
itself (Annex E). To avoid packet loss, the ZigBee standard 
recommends spectrum scanning with the help of RSSI 
readings for network channel management [3]. The scheme 
is only based on noise floor measurements on different 
channels and changes to a less used channel. There is no 
classification of sources of interference.  
Boano et al. are using RSSI readings to improve the 
channel simulation [4] and to recreate interference [5]. 
Especially [5] gives a good overview of the possibilities of 
RSSI readings and the sources of interference (as in this 
work, WLAN, BT and MWO are researched). Emulations of 
the different sources of interference are presented, but no 
classification is used. 
Rayanchu, Patro and Banerjee use an off-the-shelf 
WLAN interface card to measure the spectrum in the 2.4 
GHz band and to identify devices [6]. Since IEEE 802.11 
wireless network interface cards have different technical 
properties compared to IEEE 802.15.4 radios, their 
identification method differs from the one presented here. 
Their presented solution performs full spectrum scans and 
their classification of devices is based on a decision tree 
created with the help of machine learning.  
Chowdhury and Akyildiz propose spectrum sensing with 
the help of a sensor node and an offline interference source 
classification approach. They scan the full spectrum and 
identify WLANs and MWOs by matching the observed 
spectral pattern with a stored reference shape. Their 
approach scans the full spectrum, thus the sensor node 
cannot receive while performing the scan. Their number of 
researched devices for WLANs and MWOs is rather small. 
They further suggest a scheme to choose the channel, packet 
scheduling times and sleep-awake cycles [7]. 
The algorithm presented here only needs the readings of 
a single channel and thus, the measuring sensor node is

connected to the network all the time. Also, the number of 
researched devices is high for an approach using sensor 
nodes.

RSSI READINGS 
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines that an “Energy 
Detection” (ED) value must be measured for the “network 
layer as part of a channel selection algorithm. It is an 
estimate of the received signal power within the bandwidth 
of an IEEE 802.15.4 channel. No attempt is made to identify 
or decode signals on the channel. The ED time shall be equal 
to 8 symbol periods.” This ED value is also widely known as 
the RSSI value. Since no identifying or decoding takes place, 
the RSSI can be used either to detect noise on a channel, or 
to indicate the quality of an incoming packet when measured 
while receiving.  
Many applications and protocols for WSNs use the RSSI 
values to detect traffic or interference on the channel and to 
estimate 
transmission distances. Thus, RSSI is an 
enormously useful metric when used as a link quality 
estimator [8] or as part of a link quality estimator [9], and 
therefore, for routing. In addition, localization [10], channel 
management [7] and other systems rely heavily on RSSI 
readings.  
In this work, RSSI readings from the Tmote Sky [11] 
sensor node are used. The data sheet of the built-in CC2420 
radio chip [12] states a dynamic range from -100 to 0 dBm 
with an accuracy of ±6 dB and a linearity of ±3 dB. The 
RSSI is read over an 8 symbol period, which is 128 µs long 
in average. The quality of these RSSI readings was 
researched in [13] and the effects of the antenna pattern are 
shown in [14]. 
IV. 
SOURCES OF INTERFERENCE 
The main sources of interference for WSNs in the 2.4 
GHz band in urban environments and their effects on WSN 
deployments are reviewed in literature [15, 16]. In the 
literature and from the authors’ experience, the main sources 
of interference are given as: 
A. Wireless Local Area Networks 
The term WLAN or Wi-Fi is commonly used to describe 
a collection of different technologies based on the IEEE 
802.11 standard and its amendments [17]. In the following, 
the 802.11b, g and n standard [18] are of interest, since these 
operate in the 2.4 GHz band. Dependent on national 
restrictions there are up to a maximum of 14 (11 in North 
America) channels available. The IEEE 802.11b and g 
channels are 22 MHz wide and their channel center 
frequencies are only 5 MHz away from each other, thus they 
overlap each other. Channel 14 is an exception being 12 
MHz away from its predecessor (see Figure 5). IEEE 
802.11n works basically on the same channels but supports 
40 MHz wide bundled channels and multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO), which is based on multiple antennas. 
Although spread spectrum modulated signals are used, a 
single 2 MHz wide WSN channel within the 22 MHz wide 
WLAN channel shows a clear peak in the RSSI readings of 
the Tmote Sky sensor node on WLAN sending activity. 
Hence the transmitting time and temporal length can be 
roughly detected. Since this work concentrates on single 
channel measurements the spectral properties cannot be used 
for identification.  
The data rates of the previous mentioned standards are 1, 
2, 11, 54 and 150 Mbit/s. Although there are different data 
rates, the standard specifies beacons, send by the Access 
Point (AP), which are different to normal traffic. 
1) Beacon Frames: Every AP periodically sends a 
beacon frame to announce its network and to maintain 
connection to all clients in range.  To allow all network 
interface cards to see the network, this beacon is send with 
the lowest data rate (1 or 2 Mbit/s) for highest compatibility. 
The smallest theoretical beacon has a body of around 30 
bytes and 28 bytes of management frame. It has a 
measureable transfer time of roughly 0.5 or 0.25 ms. Most 
beacon frames are over 100 bytes in length and therefore, 
they are clearly traceable. The default behavior is to send 
ten beacons per second. The authors observed that all 
scanned WLANs (six in an office and 16 in a domestic 
environment) used a beaconing frequency of 10 Hz. This 
frequency is assumed for the remainder of this work. The 
beacons are good indicators of the presence of a WLAN on 
the channel and can be clearly seen in the RSSI readings as 
shown in Figure 6 (a). When the channel is heavily used the 
beacons become harder to identify as the standard does not 
provide reserved timeslot for beacons (see Figure 1 and 
Figure 6 (b)). This means that the AP has to access the 
communication medium by using the CSMA/CA algorithm 
as all participants do, resulting in the possibility of delayed 
beacons. As the AP is further away from the measuring 
sensor node, the beacons get increasingly lost in the data 
traffic. 
2) Non-Beacon Frames: All other traffic in the WLAN 
can be, depending on the network possibilities, transferred at 
a higher speed and is therefore harder to identify as WLAN 
traffic. Some small packets can even be too fast to be 
measured using 11 kHz RSSI readings. This traffic has no 
dominant pattern, due to the various amounts of different 
protocols and applications. 
B. Bluetooth Devices 
BT [19] (IEEE 802.15.1) is designed to be a low-cost, 
medium-power, robust, short-range communication platform 
for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs). It also 
operates in the 2.4 GHz band using 79 different 1 MHz wide 
channels (see Figure 5). It supports different sending classes 
with different sending powers. There are different versions 
of BT available, supporting different data rates up to 3 
 
Figure 1. Beacon transmissions on a busy network [17].

Mbit/s for Version 2.0 + Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) 
onwards. Since BT uses Adaptive Frequency Hopping 
(AFH) it is the least interfering technology presented here. 
BT changes the channel 1,600 times a second. This results in 
a time of 0.625 ms between the hops, called a slot, which is 
still traceable with a sampling rate of 11 kHz. A BT signal is 
characterized by its short spikes, due to the channel hops. 
The transmissions are organized by a Time Division 
Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme. BT supports two types of 
physical links: Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) 
links and Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) links. SCO 
links are normally used for voice transfer and are strictly 
based on single slot packets. ACL links are packet based and 
can use one, three or five slots (see Figure 2). The traffic 
load and therefore the channel usage depend very much on 
the used application profile and wireless environment. The 
traffic can be low (regular traffic as for a wireless input 
device) to high (burst traffic as for file transfer (FTP)) or 
evenly spread transfer of audio as used for wireless headsets 
(see Figure 6 (d) and Figure 6 (e)). The actual transfer spikes 
of BT in the RSSI readings are the most reliable method for 
identification. The discovery and connection phase has not 
been investigated in this work.  
C. Microwave Ovens 
MWOs are a widely used household appliance working 
in the 2.4 GHz band with high power to warm food by 
dielectric heating. The common center frequency of MWOs 
is around 2.45 GHz with a spread width of at least 5 MHz 
and the average output power is around 800 W (the precise 
specification of a model can normally be found at the type 
plate at the back of the MWO). Through shielding most of 
the output power is kept in the cooking chamber of the 
device, but some waves are emitted to the environment. 
Measurements of the spectrum and the timing patterns of 
different MWOs can be found in [20]. 
MWOs consist of a single magnetron tube that emits high 
frequency waves. Since the magnetron works always with 
full power the user-set power level is achieved by controlling 
on and off periods. This results in off times between some 
heating phases (see Figure 3). These heating phases (shown 
in Figure 6 (c)) consist of wave emitting periods that are 
typically based on the frequency of the power supply (50 Hz 
in Europe or 60 Hz in North America). The periodical 
channel blocking differs very much to the signals used for 
digital, wireless communication and can be easily identified. 
For the rest of this paper, it is assumed that the MWO is 
measured in a heating phase, because in the off times no 
waves are emitted.  
D. Other Wireless Sensors Networks 
Other WSNs operating on the same channel also have the 
potential to jam communications. The identification of other 
WSNs by RSSI readings would be possible (see Figure 6 
(f)), but is not needed, since a single channel RSSI scanner 
can still receive messages. Even if the other WSN uses a 
different MAC protocol the message will still be received, 
but it might not be interpretable. Since the protocols used for 
WSNs are very variable, a time based classification based on 
RSSI readings would be quite complex to cover all possible 
patterns. 
E. Other Devices 
There are more devices active in the 2.4 GHz band, for 
example: Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications 
(DECT) phones, wireless input devices not based on BT, or 
wireless video cameras, but they are beyond the scope of this 
paper. 
V. 
IDENTIFYING DEVICES IN THE TIME DOMAIN 
A. Experimental Setup 
To develop a decision algorithm to identify the class of 
an interfering device, a data base of RSSI readings was 
created. All samples have been collected with a single Tmote 
Sky sensor node running ContikiOS 2.5 [21]. For measuring 
the Frossi Scanner [3, 22] has been used, recording RSSI 
readings with an average sampling rate of 11,321 Hz. With 
the help of MATLAB [23] 790 samples, each one second 
long, have been cut. These samples consist of scans of 
different channels in two WLAN environments, two MWOs, 
four BT devices, and another Tmote Sky sensor node 
sending short messages. All samples have been checked 
manually by viewing a plot to make sure that the sample is 
feasible and classifiable. This data base forms the foundation 
for the later stated detection rates. Its detailed composition is 
shown in Table 1. 
B. Data Analysis 
The main part of the data analysis was done offline in 
MATLAB. Additionally WEKA [24] was used, but the 
suggested trees and rules have not been used with the present 
algorithm, since they leak domain knowledge and are purely 
based on statistics. Some thresholds have been incorporated 
in the algorithm presented here.

C. Algorithm 
The algorithm takes one second of RSSI readings as 
input and classifies it as WLAN, MWO, BT or unknown 
device. There is also the chance of an early return in the case 
where there is no signal present. In the following the 
algorithm is briefly described, an overview of the algorithm 
is given in Listing 1. The steps are worked through 
sequentially. If a classification matches, the result is returned 
and the algorithm ends. 
1) Input: 1 s (~11,300 samples) of RSSI readings with 
values in the range of [0…100]. The dBm values can be 
computed as the RSSI values minus 100. 
2) Noise: If no reading has a value greater or equal to 
15, there is no classifiable signal present. In the following 
all values under 15 mean a free channel, while higher values 
are considered as usage of the channel. The default Clear 
Channel Assessment (CCA) threshold of the radio is 23. But 
the threshold of 15 allows the algorithm to work with 
weaker signals and is still far enough away from the noise 
floor. 
3) MWO: The algorithm states that the signal is 
generated by a MWO if the following conditions are 
fulfilled: The maximum period power of the signal, found 
by a discrete Fourier transform, is between 48 and 52 or 
between 98 and 102 (based on European 50 Hz mean 
frequency). And the channel is used between 30 % and 70 
% of the time. 
4) BT: The algorithm states that the signal is generated 
by a BT device if the following conditions are fulfilled: The 
channel is never used longer than a single BT slot or the 
distance between rising flanks is mainly the [1…5] times of 
a slot time. And the channel is used less than 10 % of the 
time and the 10 Hz period power found by a discrete Fourier 
transform divided by the maximum power of all periods is 
less or equal to 0.035. 
5) WLAN: The algorithm states that the signal is 
generated by a WLAN if the following conditions are 
fulfilled: The usage of the channel is between 1 % and 30 % 
and the maximum time of a clear channel is less than 100 
ms (100 ms are the standard delay between to beacons). 
6) UNKNOWN: If none of the previous conditions are 
fulfilled, the source of the signal is unknown. 
D. Discussion of the Classification Results 
The algorithm described performs well on the previously 
mentioned data base with 28 wrongly classified data sets out 
of 790 in total (3.54 %). The detailed confusion matrix is 
given in Table 2. Samples of WSNs were used to check the 
behavior of the classifier for unknown signals and to proof 
the exclusiveness of the classes, thus the precision value for 
WSNs is not meaningful. There is no class for WSNs since 
there is no need to detect them with RSSI readings (as 
explained in Section IV-D).  
Since the signal is either binarized (channel used or clear) 
or normalized, as the FFT results, the distance to the 
interference source should be unimportant. The algorithm 
can be easily implemented on a personal computer. With an 
input of just one second of RSSI readings it is performed fast 
and can adapt quickly to changes in the wireless 
neighborhood. Unfortunately, at the moment, it is too 
complex to run on a sensor node. The memory of the node 
cannot handle the data.  
The presence of multiple sources of interference is a 
challenge for the detection algorithm and the present 
algorithm only returns a single class.  First trials showed that 
depending on the sources of interference different cases 
occur. 
Since MWOs do not monitor or react to traffic on the 
medium, they overlay the signals of WLANs and BT devices 
and the algorithm will most likely not identify other sources 
of interference, due to the dominance of the MWO. The 
interference range of a MWO is quite limited, thus further 
away from the MWO the MWO signal will decline quickly 
and the other signals will become dominant and will be 
detected by the algorithm. 
WLAN and BT are much more complex in there 
coexistence, since both of them react to the usage of the 
// 1 second of RSSI readings 
IF max(Readings) < 15 
THEN return(NOISE); 
IF ( (max(FFT.power).index between(48Hz,52Hz)) 
     OR 
     (max(FFT.power).index between(98Hz,102Hz)) 
     AND (Usage between(30%,70%) ) 
THEN return(MWO); 
IF ( (max(UsageLength) < 625 µs) OR 
     (RaisingFlanks/count(RaisingFlanks)  
      >= 0.286)) AND ((Usage <= 10%) AND  
     (FFT.Power[10HZ]/sum(FFT.Power) <= 0.035) ) 
THEN return(BT); 
IF ( (Usage between(1%,30%)) AND   
     (max(ClearanceLengths) <= 100ms) ) 
THEN return(WLAN); 
return(UNKNOWN);

medium. WLAN is quite widely spread, thus it can stand 
narrow band interference like BT. BT uses AFH and changes 
to un- or less used channels when many collisions occur on a 
channel. The principle of AFH is shown in Figure 4. 
Additionally, adaptive power control and Channel Quality 
Driven Data Rate (CQDDR) are used by BT to reduce 
interference. In the real world there are still some BT 
transmissions on the channels used by WLAN. But since 
there are many factors (distance to the sources of 
interference, data traffic and protocols used, and the just 
name interference avoiding technologies of BT) the interplay 
of BT and WLAN is not fully covered by the presented 
algorithm. In case of signals of BT and WLAN it will mostly 
classify the signal as WLAN, since WLAN is the dominant 
source of interference. According to [15], WLANs lead to 
much more lost packets than BT devices and so the 
algorithm returns the most relevant source of interference. 
Nevertheless, the detection of multiple sources of 
interference is a possible future enhancement for the 
presented algorithm.  
New classes of devices as mentioned in Section IV-E, 
like wireless DECT phones and other proprietary devices 
operating in the 2.4 GHz band could be added. The 
algorithm needs further testing with more devices. Also the 
quality of the RSSI readings across different nodes of the 
same and different models could be compared. According to 
[13] the RSSI readings across different sensor nodes are 
comparable and hence the usage of other nodes as 
measurement devices is feasible.  
As a short sanity check for the results, the authors went 
to another location and measured with a different Tmote Sky 
on channel 12 that was used by WLANs. All samples 
measured were classified correctly as WLANs. More 
consolidation of the results will be done in near future. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper reviews the possibility of using RSSI readings 
to monitor the wireless channel. The main sources of 
wireless interference are introduced, and finally an algorithm 
to classify one second of RSSI readings into a device class is 
presented. 
The results presented here can be used in many 
applications. The features of the signals highlighted here, can 
help to better simulate interference for improved channel 
models. The algorithm could run on the base station of a 
WSN enabling the base station to perform a funded 
centralized channel management. Channel sensing is also an 
important step for Cognitive Radios [25]. With the 
knowledge of the channel number the identification results 
could be improved further. An additional full spectrum scan 
could considerably improve the classification, but the ability 
to received messages without interruption on the channel 
would be lost. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is 
the first algorithm using a time series of RSSI readings of 
only a single channel to classify the wireless neighbors of a 
wireless sensor node.
