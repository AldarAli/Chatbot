Abstract—In 
southern 
Africa, 
land 
degradation 
and 
desertification affect the territory to a considerable extent. 
Given the lack of economic resources to reverse the problem in 
many countries within the region, prevention mechanisms can 
be key to address further land degradation and desertification. 
The use of Earth Observation Data for analyzing land 
degradation and desertification dynamics, in southern Africa is 
widely and consistently used. Under the Desert watch 
Extension project a consistent methodology to attain an 
Indicator of Susceptibility to Desertification was developed. In 
this paper we aim to implement the Indicator for Susceptibility 
to 
Desertification 
through 
Desert 
Watch 
Extension 
methodology, but employing new Earth Observation Data 
from the satellite mission of the Project On Board Vegetation-
Proba-V. Our preliminary results validated the use of this new 
Earth Observation data set for the analysis of the spatial 
variability as well as temporal dynamics of drought, one of the 
key driving factors of land degradation and desertification in 
the region. 
Keywords- the Southern Africa; desertification indicators; 
Proba-V; drought. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This study aims to analyse the new dynamics of 
desertification and land degradation indicators in Southern 
Africa. The study area comprises Southern Mozambique, 
Southern Zimbabwe and the Northern part of South Africa. 
The research goal is to produce an Indicator for 
Susceptibility of Desertification (ISD) through remote 
sensing data, namely the Proba-V (Project On Board 
Autonomous Vegetation)1. The Proba-V is satellite mission 
from European Spatial Agency (ESA) and Centre National d' 
Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and is providing new Earth 
Observation Data since June 2013. This product has the 
same performance as the Satellite Pour l’ Observation de la 
Terre – Vegetation (SPOT-VGT)2. Hence, it allows us to 
have series of data from 1998 to current days.

The semi-arid areas cover almost 16% of African 
continent´s surface and represent about 5.1 million km2 [1].   
Dryland degradation affects much of Africa, in general, and 
Southern Africa, in particular [2]. There are several studies 
that sought to discriminate between climate and human-
induced dryland degradation in Southern Africa [3][4][5]. 
Among various factors, the cyclical occurrence of droughts 
at local level, as well as deforestation caused by farming and 
alike activities can increase the risk of desertification 
particularly in the semi-arid areas in Southern Africa [1]. 
The indicators about the susceptibility to desertification, 
particularly in the semi-arid areas in Southern Africa region, 
still requires further study. To what extent, through the use 
of the Proba-V-new remote sensing data - a steady and 
effective Indicator for Susceptibility of Desertification –
ISD, can be obtained for Southern Africa? Our research goal 
is to employ the Proba-V satellite imagery and the DW-E 
methodology for obtaining an affective Indicator for 
Susceptibility to Desertification. We consider that using this 
new data could represent a crucial step for consolidating the 
understanding of the dynamics of desertification in Southern 
Africa.

METHODOLOGY 
In Southern Africa region, the driest months are July and 
August, whereas the rainiest months are December and 
January. Fundamentally, in the study area, two main seasons 
can be identified. One is cold and dry and another is hot and 
wet with about the same duration length of 6 months each. 
However, a decrease in precipitation can increase the 
likelihood of severe droughts. 
In the preliminary stages of this study, in order to 
calibrate the ISD using the new Proba-V images, the 
correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index (NDVI), extracted from Landsat (Thematic Mapper3, 
Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus 4  and Operational Land

Imager–Thermal Infrared Sensor5), SPOT-VGT and Proba-V 
images, was investigated by each land cover class. The 
Landsat images were pre-processed: radiometric and 
atmospheric correction, dark-object subtraction method and 
cloud and shadow mask and upscaling for Proba-V and 
SPOT-VGT spatial resolution. The images used in the 
calibration were taken from the month of September (the end 
of the dry season) for the years 2001, 2008 and 2014. 
The dynamic of desertification indicators include: a) the 
number of days per year with precipitation below 1 
millimeter (RL1) was computed from climate reanalysis of 
the data from The European Centre for Medium-Range 
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and it was the input for 
climatic component; and b) biophysical component, which is 
based on NDVI and soil brightness analysis, by land cover 
class. As work in progress, the models of desertification 
indicators 
had 
been 
determined 
using 
geostatistical 
methodologies (kriging, co-kriging, stochastic simulations ) 
with 
the 
biophysical 
and 
the 
climatic 
indicators 
[6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. This methodology coupled with 
field work (direct observation) will be pivotal to validate the 
findings as well as to ensure consistency. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The Proba-V and SPOT-VGT data products had shown a 
significant correlation with Landsat image, allowing us to 
follow through with the next step, which is the ISD.  
Despite the decreasing in spatial resolution from 30m 
(Landsat) to 100m (and 300m) (Proba-V), the temporal 
resolution was increased from 2 images per month to 6 (and 
3) per month. This is one of the major enhancements that 
the Proba-V satellite provided on Open Earth Observation 
Data. 
Our results about climatic component (see Figure 1 and 
Figure 2), suggest that there could be a steady relationship 
between the spatial dynamic of drought and spatial 
variability of semi-arid areas over the region. Figure 1 
represents the Static Component, which is the average of the 
number of days per year with precipitation below 1 
millimeter (RL1). The highest values of the average of RL1 
(red spots), seem to be spatially distributed according to 
desert areas and semi-arid areas over the region. Figure 2 
represents the Dynamic Component, which is the slope of 
the variance of number of days per year with precipitation 
below 1 millimeter (RL1). The areas with high values (in 
red) experience the major variability in rainfall and these 
areas are distributed according to the semi-arid areas over 
the region. Overall, the climatic component analysis seems 
to show high levels of consistency with previous work on 
spatial dynamics of land degradation and desertification in 
Southern Africa [2]. We are working on soil component and 
we expect to obtain desertification indicator results with 
different spatial resolution (100m, 300m) using Proba-V 
images.

In conclusion, the ISD in semi-arid areas, where the 
range of drought periods differed in magnitude in space and 
time, is 
significant 
for 
resources 
management 
and 
sustainable development strategy at national level.
