Abstract—IMT-Advanced is gaining much attention as the
next-generation mobile communication technology. In this study,
we evaluate the TCP throughput performance of mobile users
competing on an IMT-Advanced shared downlink via a network
simulation by using realistic environmental parameters. Our
focus is on evaluating the impact of two basic types of time-
frequency scheduling in which not only a time-varying wireless
condition is used but also a frequency-block-dependent wireless
condition of each user is exploited using various buffer sizes
at radio base stations and various user moving speeds. We
investigated the subtle tension between the scheduling, buffer
sizing, and user moving speed for the TCP throughput. Our
results imply that more TCP awareness is necessary for sharing
the large bandwidth of IMT-Advanced downlinks more efﬁciently.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, mobile communications have expanded rapidly
worldwide. Third-generation mobile communication systems
(3G), including wideband code division multiple Access (W-
CDMA) and high-speed packet access (HSPA) are now being
used. Moreover, cellular-phone-oriented mass contents and
individual user-data trafﬁc are increasing in conjunction with
each other every year. Therefore, the demand for high-speed
mobile communications is currently increasing. Subsequently,
the international mobile telecommunication-Advanced (IMT-
Advanced) known as 4G, which attains improvement in
communication speed, is also gaining much attention [1].
To achieve high-speed wireless access, IMT-Advanced would
need a wireless bandwidth wider than the 5 MHz of the
wireless bandwidth of W-CDMA.
Generally, because the wireless condition of each user, i.e.,
mobile station (MS), varies in time because of the interference,
fading, or the movement of the MS, the shared wireless chan-
nel for downlink access is divided into ﬁxed-length time slots
at every transmission time interval (TTI). A scheduler at the
radio base station (BS) allocates individual time slots to MSs
that depend on the wireless condition of each MS and by using
feedback information from each MS to each BS. Furthermore,
in order to utilize the wider bandwidth efﬁciently, the entire
bandwidth is divided into smaller bandwidths (i.e., frequency
blocks or subchannels); and time-frequency scheduling assigns
each subchannel to one MS at each time slot, whereas tradi-
tional time scheduling assigns the entire bandwidth to one MS
for every time slot. A subchannel assignment in a wireless link
with time-frequency scheduling is illustrated in Fig. 1, where
different colors/patterns denote different users (MSs).
The transmission control protocol (TCP) is a dominant
transport-layer protocol for end-to-end reliable data transfer,
and most of the Internet applications rely on TCP. However,
because TCP adaptively controls its sending rate of IP data-
grams in response to datagram losses and delay-time varia-
tions, its throughput characteristic is highly sensitive to diverse
factors, and is difﬁcult to estimate its throughput characteristic
analytically when the network condition varies dynamically
(e.g, [2]) . On IMT-Advanced environments, the performance
of TCP-based applications such as ﬁle transfer is expected to
be greatly affected by both conﬁgurable conditions, such as
the type of scheduling mechanism and the buffer sizing of the
BS; and environmental conditions, such as the delay time of
a core network and the moving speeds of MSs. Therefore, it
is indispensable to conduct the evaluation and investigation of
the TCP throughput performance of competing mobile users
quantitatively.
Performance evaluation of IMT-Advanced communications
using network simulators have begun to get more attention
(e.g., [3]). However, for TCP ﬂow-level performance of com-
peting mobile users in IMT-Advanced via realistic network
simulations, little is found in the literature. In our previous
work [4], the TCP performance in the Evolved UTRA and
UTRAN environments by using time scheduling and time-
frequency scheduling was evaluated using a network simu-
lation by employing realistic packet-error patterns. Building
upon that work, here we examine the TCP performance in
the new IMT-Advanced environments by using typical time-
frequency schedulers (i.e., MaxCIR and Proportional Fair
schedulers). Our focus is on evaluating the subtle tension
between the scheduling, buffer sizing, and user moving speed
for the TCP throughput.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we introduce two typical scheduling algorithms. Section III
explains our network simulation settings for large (continuous)
ﬁle downloads, and the simulation results are investigated in
terms of the impact on the base-station buffer size in Section

II. TIME-FREQUENCY SCHEDULING IN IMT-ADVANCED
We brieﬂy explain time-frequency scheduling on downlinks
in IMT-Advanced involving the BS, the MS, and their interac-
tions. When the BS receives an IP datagram as a service data
unit (SDU) from the upper link (i.e., the Internet), it divides
the IP datagram into ﬁxed-size small radio link control (RLC)
protocol data units (PDUs).
Before being sent to the MS, each PDU is queued to an
individual buffer dedicated to each destination user (i.e., MS)
before being sent to the MS. Each individual user buffer
consists of a transmission buffer and a retransmission buffer.
The number of PDUs transmitted at TTI in a subchannel
depends on the achievable transmission rate that is determined
using the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The MCSs
used in our simulation are shown in Table I, where the
right-most column Transmission Rate indicates the achievable
transmission rate in the entire bandwidth and not in each
divided subchannel. If a PDU is damaged during transmission
and cannot be fully decoded by the destination user, the
original PDU is moved to the retransmission buffer, which
is preferentially sent compared with the normal PDUs in the
transmission buffer. In our simulation (Section III), to reduce
multiple retransmissions, we use a hybrid automatic repeat
request (ARQ) with packet combining [5] as a retransmission
scheme, which can combine the retransmission PDU with the
previously received erroneous PDUs for effective decoding.
At each TTI and for each subchannel, the BS selects one
preferable user and one MCS is adopted for sending PDUs to
the selected user. This selection is based on the instantaneous
wireless conditions, i.e., the single-to-interference plus back
ground noise ratio (SINR), of individual users, which are
reported by the channel-state information (CSI) feedback from
each user to the BS with some delay (e.g., 3×TTI). In our
simulation, a mapping from every pair of an SINR value and
a sending rate (MCS) to the block error rate, which is the
error probability of transmitting PDUs within current TTI,
is prepared beforehand. Note that this delay of the SINR
value feedback may cause an inaccurate estimation of the
current wireless condition, and thus, may result in the improper
selection of both, the user to whom data has to be sent and
the MCS to be used.

Hereinafter, we brieﬂy introduce two typical schedulers
that were used in this study. Although those schedulers are
simple and some modiﬁed or compound versions may be used
in commercial services, these fundamental schedulers are of
practical importance for designing more complex schedulers.
To describe the scheduling, we use a user-selection metric
Mm,c(n) at time-slot n in subchannel c for user m; this means
that the user m who has the highest Mm,c(n) is selected in
c at n. If more than one user has the same highest value of
Mm,c(n), a user is randomly selected from these users.
The maximum carrier-to-interference power ratio (MaxCIR)
scheduler maximizes the system throughput by selecting a user
who has the best wireless condition in the subchannel for that
particular time slot. In this study, the usage of the achievable
transmission rate Rm,c(n) as the wireless condition leads to
the following user-selection metric:
Mm,c(n) = Rm,c(n).
(1)
The Proportional Fair (PF) scheduler (e.g., [6]) provides
a good trade-off between maximizing the system throughput
and satisfying fairness among users. The PF scheduler in time
scheduling can be easily implemented so as to preferentially
select a user who has not been served sufﬁciently in the
past (i.e., with a low time-averaged throughput), who has a
good wireless condition at that particular time (i.e., with a
high achievable transmission rate), and who is proven to ap-
proximately fulﬁll the proportional fairness. However, optimal
time-frequency (multi-carrier) PF scheduling is computation-
ally complex, and a number of low-complexity algorithms
have been proposed (e.g., [7], [8]) to achieve near-optimal
performance. In this study, among these time-frequency PF
schedulers, we adopt the conventional multi-carrier propor-
tional fairness scheduling (MC-PFS) algorithm [7], which is
a simple extension of the time PF scheduler and is easy to
deploy. The user selection metric is formulated as follows:
Mm,c(n) = Rm,c(n)
Tm(n) ,
(2)
where the time-averaged throughput of a user m before a time-
slot n is denoted by Tm(n), and is updated according to the
following equation in which δm,c equals 1 if user m is the
selected user at the time slot n in subchannel c, and equals 0

III. SIMULATION MODEL
The simulation model is illustrated in Fig. 2, which is
implemented using the network simulator NS-2 (ver. 2.27)
with an extended link layer module of the shared wireless
downlink we developed. The transmission rate of the wired
access links (Source–R) is 1 Gb/s, and propagation delays
are set from 1 ms to 5 ms at random to prevent TCP
synchronization. The transmission rate of the core link (R–BS)
is 1 Gb/s, and propagation delay is set to 10 ms. The shared
wireless link from the BS to the MSs of the 80 MHz bandwidth
is divided into 400 subchannels in the frequency domain, and
is also divided into many time slots with a TTI of 1 ms in the
time domain. According to the MCS, the total transmission
rate of all subchannels ranges from 15.128 Mb/s to 274 Mb/s
(Table I). The actual transmission rate per subchannel can be
obtained by dividing it by 400. The data-propagation delay
between the BS and each MS, including the processing delay,
is 1.75 ms, and the CSI feedback delay from each MS to the
BS is 3 TTI (3 ms). We assume that the uplink is error free.
Thus, neither data (TCP ACKs) nor signaling (CSI feedbacks)
are ever lost or degraded.
The time series of the wireless condition, i.e., SINR, on the
link from the BS to each MS in each subchannel at each TTI
is given in advance; the time series data is created on the basis
of the position (distance from the BS) and the moving speed of
the MSs under the 6-path GSM typical urban multi-path model
when considering realistic environments. We use data for 30
users distributed around a BS in a signal cell; according to the
distance from the BS (from near to far), the users are divided
into 10 groups of three users each, implying that the users
are roughly sorted by the order of the time-averaged wireless
condition (from good to bad) and grouped. User (group) ID-1
is assigned to the nearest group, and ID-10 is assigned to the
farthest group. In each simulation trial, we choose one user
from each group randomly and conduct the simulation with
these 10 selected users.
As shown in Fig. 2, ten TCP ﬂows from Sources (servers on
the Internet) to Destinations (MSs) are established in parallel,
and each Source sends a large ﬁle in 60 s. The starting time
of each ﬂow is randomly selected and ranges from 0 to 2 s.
Other simulation parameters are listed in Table II.
We use the “user throughput” Um as a performance index
for user m; it is a time-averaged throughput that is formulated
as follows:
Um[b/s] = bm[bit]

Then, “active time ratio” is deﬁned as:

has at least one PDU in the individual buffer on BS.

IV. TCP THROUGHPUT WITH VARYING BUFFER SIZE
We investigate the TCP performance for large ﬁle down-
loads at various buffer sizes (40, 500 and 1500 packets) of
individual buffers on the BS.
A. Performance of MaxCIR Scheduler
The user throughputs of 10 individual users (and their
average) and the selection ratio are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4,
respectively, by using MaxCIR at each buffer size of all BSs.
To maximize the system throughput, the MaxCIR scheduler
selects User 1 frequently because it is likely that User1 is
the best wireless-condition user among 10 users. In fact, in
the case of the buffer size of 500 packets shown in Fig.
4,
the selection ratio of User 1 is extremely high; moreover,

as the User ID increases, the selection ratio decreases. The
high achievable transmission rate and the high selection ratio
directly lead to the superior throughput of User 1, as shown
in Fig. 3.
However, on comparing the different buffer sizes, this
tendency considerably weakens in the case of a shorter buffer
size of 40 packets while the tendency remains in the case of
a larger buffer size of 1500 packets. The average throughput
over all users is also decreased in the case of 40 packets and
unchanged in the case of 1500 packets. In order to clarify
this tendency, the active time ratio is examined, as shown in
Fig. 5. In the case of 40 packets, the active time ratio of User
1 is approximately 40% while in the cases of 500 and 1500
packets, the active time ratios are maintained at approximately
90%. In other words, by using a short buffer size of 40 packets,
in approximately 60% of the total time slots, User 1 has no
PDU at the BS to be transmitted. Therefore, another user
could be selected even if the wireless condition of User 1
is considerably better than that of the selected user, resulting
in an increase in throughputs of Users 2-8 in the case of a 40
packet buffer. From Fig. 5, a buffer size of 500 packets is so
efﬁcient that it can keep the active time ratio ≈ 1 for all users.
To investigate the reason why the active time ratio of User
1 in the case of 500 packets is much higher than that of
40 packets while it is equivalent to that of 1500 packets, a
sample of the time variation of the TCP congestion window
size (CWND) of User 1 is shown in Fig. 6. Note that the TCP
CWND is a variable and is used to adaptively control the
number of allowable in-ﬂight packets at Sender. This ﬁgure
indicates that the TCP CWND in the case of 500 packets
is much higher than that in the case of 40 packets because
of a reduction in the IP datagram losses at the buffer on
the BS. In other words, a buffer size of 40 packets is so
small (for a possible TCP throughput of User 1) that it often
causes packet losses at User 1’s buffer, limits the TCP CWND,
and often makes the buffer empty. Conversely, a buffer size
of 500 packets is sufﬁcient to increase the TCP CWND for
maintaining a non-empty buffer.
Similarly, the TCP CWND in the case of 1500 packets is
much higher than that in the case of 500 packets. However,
between the cases with buffer sizes of 500 and 1500 packets,
the active time ratio, and thus, the user throughput remain
unchanged. In fact, the average round-trip time (RTT) and
TCP-bandwidth of User 1 for each buffer size are summarized
in Table III, where the “TCP bandwidth” denotes the size
of the time-averaged CWND in bytes divided by the time-
averaged RTT, implying the time-averaged TCP sending rate.

A larger buffer size of 1500 packets only causes a longer RTT
rather than a higher TCP bandwidth. This implies that User 1’s
TCP bandwidth approaches the wireless bandwidth available
to User 1.
B. Performance of PF Scheduler
Throughputs of individual users and their average, and
selection ratio are illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively,
with the PF scheduler at each buffer size on the BS. Because
the PF scheduler selects users in a fair fashion, in contrast
to the MaxCIR case, the selection ratio does not differ much
among the users and tends to be 0.1 (implying to be shared
evenly), as shown in Fig. 8. The user-throughput balance is
expected to approximate the proportional fairness if each user
buffer is not empty for all of the time. At least the throughput
balance tends to be milder compared with the MaxCIR case
at the expense of a lower (approximately halved) user average
throughput (i.e., a lower system throughput).
On comparing the different buffer sizes, the impact on
the user throughputs is more complicated than the MaxCIR
case discussed in the previous subsection. As the buffer size
increases from 40, 500, to1500 packets, the throughput of User
1 monotonically increases. In contrast, for most users such as
Users 2–6, the throughput with a buffer size of 500 packets
is the highest among the examined buffer sizes. The average
of all user throughputs is also maximized in the case with a
500-packet buffer size. In terms of the active time ratio shown
in Fig. 9, for all users, a buffer size of 500 packets is the
best case (i.e., closest to one) compared with the other buffer
sizes, i.e., 40 and 1500 packets. This implies that the case of
the 500-packet buffer size exhibits mostly expected behavior
in terms of the proportional fair scheduling.
In further investigation, the subtle impacts of buffer sizing
can be observed. For example, in terms of the selection ratio
shown in Fig. 8, the selection ratio of User 1 with a 500-packet
buffer size is higher than that with a 40-packet buffer size.
Accordingly, the throughput of User 1 is improved. A sample
of the time-variation in the TCP CWND of User 1, as shown
in Fig. 10 indicates that the TCP CWND with a buffer size of
500 packets is much higher than that with a buffer size of 40
packets. In contrast, despite the fact that the selection ratios of
Users 3–6 with a 500-packet buffer size were unchanged (or
slightly reduced) from those with a 40-packet buffer size, the
throughputs with a 500-packet buffer size are higher. Figure
9 implies a possible reason. The active time ratios of Users
3–6 in the case of a 40-packet buffer size are clearly lower
than those in the case of a 500-packet buffer. In the case of
a 40-packet buffer, because PF scheduler tends to maintain
the selection ratio evenly, Users 3–6 are likely to be selected
even if their wireless condition is unsuitable. This results in
a lower transmission rate and a higher retransmission rate. In
contrast, by using a buffer size of 500 packets, because of
higher active time ratios, users could be selected at a better
wireless condition.
On the other hand, comparing the cases of a 500-packet
buffer and a 1500-packet buffer, the selection ratios of Users
1, 7, and 10 in the case of a 1500-packet buffer are consid-
erably higher than those in the case of a 500-packet buffer.
Accordingly, those users’ throughputs are higher in the case
of a 1500-packet buffer while those of the other users are
lower in that case. In particular, Users 3–5 and 8 suffer from
a considerable reduction. Figure 9 implies a possible reason.
For all users, the active time ratios in the case of a 1500-packet
buffer are lower than those in the case of a 500-packet buffer.
However, the reduction in User 1 is smaller than the reductions
in Users 3–5 and 8. Those active-time-ratio reductions might
result from packet losses at the buffers on the BS because of
a mismatched buffer sizing. A sample of the time variation
of the TCP CWND of User 1 (Fig. 10) indicates that the
CWND with a 1500-packet buffer size is decreased from that
with a 500-packet buffer size because of the increasing IP-
datagram losses. In fact, as shown in Fig. 11, the packet loss
rate at the individual buffer on the BS increases for every user
when the buffer size is changed from 500 packets to 1500
packets. In addition, while User 1’s degradation is small, those
of Users 3–5 and 8 are signiﬁcant. Those unnecessary packet
losses in the case of a 1500-packet buffer cause imbalance and
inefﬁcient behavior of the PF scheduler.
V. TCP THROUGHPUT WITH VARYING MOVING SPEED
We investigate the TCP performance for large ﬁle down-
loads at various moving speeds (3, 30, and 120 km/h) of
users, i.e., MSs, in which all 10 users move at the same
speed. Note that, in our settings, each MS does not really
move to experience a different average wireless condition
(i.e., a different distance from the BS) in the cell. Instead, a
different moving speed means to choose a different variation
in the SINR because of a different Doppler frequency. In other
words, each MS is assumed to move along a circle around the
BS. The buffer size is set to 500 packets.
On comparing the different moving speeds, it is noted
that most users’ throughputs and the average decrease as the
moving speed increases. More precisely, with the MaxCIR
scheduler, as shown in Fig. 12, the throughput of User 1 is
strongly reduced at a higher moving speed while the through-
put of another user may have the potential to be improved if
its selection ratio increases because of the reduction of User
1’s active time. On the other hand, by using the PF scheduler,
as shown in Fig. 13, the degradation equally appears in each
user’s throughput because the scheduler tends to maintain the
selection ratio evenly.
In order to investigate the reason for this throughput re-
duction, a sample of the time series of the SINR value
averaged over all 400 subchannels for User 1 is examined
in Fig. 14, which simply indicates that the SINR is worse
(lower) and more rapidly variable at a higher moving speed.
The distribution of the selected MCS number for User 1 is
illustrated in Fig. 15, where a higher MCS number indicates a
better wireless condition. This ﬁgure indicates that the number
of PDUs transmitted in a higher MCS number decreases and in
a lower MCS number increases, as the moving speed increases.
This is the ﬁrst reason for the decrease in user throughputs.

Furthermore, the difference between the real SINR, which
directly affects the error rate of the transmitted PDUs, and the
advertised SINR, which is reported by CSI feedback and used
to select an optimal transmission rate, i.e., an MCS number,
is examined, as shown in Fig. 16. This ﬁgure indicates that as
the moving speed increases, the difference between the real
SINR and the advertised SINR increases because of the rapid
variation of the SINR; that is, the MCS number selection at the
BS based on the advertised SINR is frequently misestimated.
In fact, we found that the retransmission ratio increases as the
moving speed increases, as shown in Fig. 17. This is another
reason for the decrease in user throughputs.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we have
evaluated the quantitative TCP throughput performance of
individual users on IMT-Advanced by using two typical sched-
ulers with various user moving speeds via realistic network
simulations, regarding which little is found in the literature.
When 10 users with diverse distances from the BS are com-
peting for the IMT-Advanced shared downlink, the MaxCIR
scheduler doubles the total TCP throughput over 10 users
compared with PF scheduler, while it allows an extreme
imbalance among the users.
Second, we have investigated a subtle tension between the
scheduling and buffer sizing for the TCP throughput. We found
that the large bandwidth of the IMT-Advanced downlink is not
fully utilized by TCP ﬂows. This inefﬁciency mainly results
from the fact that the active time ratio (namely, the probability
that at least one PDU is held in the user’s individual buffer on
the BS and is ready to consume the shared link bandwidth) of
each user is lower than one and sometimes even lower, which
strongly depends on the user’s wireless condition, scheduling,
and buffer sizing.
To make the process more efﬁcient, there may be two
directions to take. One is to improve the TCP rate-control
mechanisms with an awareness of mobile wireless networks,
and the other is to improve scheduling with an awareness of
TCP ﬂows. For the ﬁrst direction, because a number of TCP
variants have already been proposed for high-speed large-delay
and/or wireless networks, we are preparing to investigate the
performance of them over IMT-Advanced. Conversely, for the
second direction, one simple idea is to change the individual
buffer sizes on the BS adaptively and automatically. We will
investigate this idea in future work.
