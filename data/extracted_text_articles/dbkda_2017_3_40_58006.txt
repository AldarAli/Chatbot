Abstract— According to Scopus, only in the year 2016, there 
were 15747 scientific papers about data mining and KDD. 
These have been and remain useful technologies. In this paper, 
we determine the approximation level of SIA to KDD and Data 
Mining. To this end, we have created an approximation 
framework based on definition and step process proposed by 
Fayyad. We use mapping review and systematic review from 
literature published in the last 5 years in bibliographic 
databases ACM, EBSCO, Google Scholar, IEEE, ProQuest, 
Scopus and WOS. We started with 200 papers and finally, 35 
had all quality criteria. This paper also describes the SIA 
papers and identifies a series of future research in SIA, KDD 
and Data Mining.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, our capacity to generate, transform, 
store, analyze and visualize data has increased, basically due 
to the high processing power and the low cost of the 
machines. However, within these huge and different types 
of data there is a lot of unknown information. The discovery 
of this information is possible thanks to Data Mining (DM), 
which among other sophisticated techniques applies 
artificial intelligence to find patterns and relationships 
within the data allowing the creation of models, that are 
abstract representations of reality. Common tasks in 
Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) are rule 
induction, 
classification 
and 
clustering 
problems, 
recognition pattern, predictive modeling, dependency 
detection, and so on [1]. 
A. 
The KDD process for extracting knowledge 
The first KDD workshop was in August 20, 1989, 
Detroit MI, USA, enabling researchers and practitioners to 
gather around KDD. We define the KDD process as [2]: 
“The non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, 
potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in 
data”.  
Data mining (DM) is a step in the general process to 
constituting the KDD process (see Figure 1). Data mining 
allows us to use specific algorithms for extracting patterns 
(including classification rules or trees, regression, clustering, 
sequence modeling, dependency, and line analysis) from 
data. Table I shows steps and subprocess in the KDD process

Statistical Implicative Analysis and the Knowledge 
discovery  
Statistical Implicative Analysis (SIA) was created by 
Regis Gras [4], thirty eight years ago and has a set of data 
analysis tools that that allows us to approach knowledge on 
the basis of the information contained in the database 
(individuals and variables). The approach is performed 
starting from the generation of asymmetric rules [5] between 
variables and variables classes, represented by tables 
(clusters non-hierarchical) [6], graphs (association rules) [7] 
and dendrograms (hierarchical clusters, hierarchical oriented 
clusters) [8]. The statistical theory [9] and application of SIA 
are in continuous expansion and development. The SIA 
software tool is called CHIC [10] [11], the last Windows 
version is 7.0 and the CHIC free multiplatform version is 
called RCHIC [12]. SIA has an international group of active 
researchers since 2000 [13]. Usual CHIC functions are: 
Similarity Tree, Implicative Graph, Cohesion Tree and 
Reduction. Some of the complementary options implemented 
in CHIC are: the entropy is used when analyzing a large data 
sample; the supplementary variables are qualitative variables 
such as gender, education level or economic category; the 
contribution is used to know what are the subjects or classes 
of subjects more responsible for computed implications and 
the typicality indicates the typical subjects of the population 
for computed implications.

Figure  1. Overview of the steps constituting the KDD process [3]. 
 
 
The aim of this paper is to describe SIA papers in the last 
5 years, to determine the position of SIA in KDD and DM, 
and identify a series of future research. 
 
C. 
Paper framework 
The approximation framework of Statistical Implicative 
Analysis to Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining are the 
KDD definition and the KDD steps proposed by Usama 
Fayyad [3]. This approximation allowed us to propose a 
new definition of SIA and to determine the steps that 
constitute the SIA process. We emphasize that this paper is 
a first approximation of SIA to Data Mining. 
Section II describes the systematic and mapping review of 
literature and the steps in the research realized. Section III 
describes the results and their discussion. Finally, Section IV 
describes the conclusions. 
 
II. METHOD 
In this section we show in detail the steps of the 
methodology used.  
A. 
Systematic and mapping review of literature 
In the planning of systematic and mapping review the 
objectives were identified and the protocol was  defined [14]    
[15]. The Protocol shows the method used in the systematic 
review and mapping to minimize the bias of researchers and 
that the methodology can be reproduced.  Below we 
summarize the protocol used: 
B. 
Research questions 
The systematic mapping aims to answer these questions: 
MQ1: What are the SIA papers by countries? 
MQ2: Which are the SIA papers types? 
MQ3: Which are the SIA papers Areas? 
MQ4: What are the SIA papers tendency? 
 
 
The systematic review aims to answer the question below: 
RQ1: Which KDD step is the closest to SIA papers? 
RQ2: Which KDD step is the furthest from SIA papers? 
RQ3: How close are the SIA papers to KDD steps? 
RQ4: How close are the SIA papers to KDD subprocess? 
RQ5: How close are the SIA papers to Data Mining steps? 
RQ6: Can you define the SIA based KDD definition? 
RQ7: Can you define the process for SIA based KDD? 
C. 
PICOC method 
The paper of Petticrew and Roberts [16], proposed the 
PICOC method to define our scope: 
▪ 
Population (P): Statistical implicative analysis 
papers in last five years (2012-2016). 
▪ 
Intervention (I): SIA papers with explicit analysis 
process, in last five years (2012-2016). 
▪ 
Comparison (C): No comparison intervention. 
▪ 
Outcomes (O): SIA approximation percentages to 
KDD stages 
▪ 
Context(C): SIA computational solutions. 
D. 
Time period 
The last 5 years (2012 to 2016) 
E. 
Sources 
The search was done in the following bibliographic 
databases [17]:  
▪ 
EBSCO [18], 
▪ 
Google Scholar [19], 
▪ 
IEEExplore [20],

ProQuest [21],  
▪ 
Scopus [22],  
▪

The review and mapping were carried out and the details 
for this step are presented in the following subsection. 
Figure 2 shows the steps of systematic and mapping review 
with SIA papers.

[31], quality checklists should be made. These checklists su
pport the selection process. In this way, we produced the 
following checklist of quality.

III. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
In this section we show the results obtained in the 
mapping and systematic review process. 
A. 
Mapping literature review 
In this section we describe the results and their discussion 
about mapping and systematic literature review.  
1) 
What are the SIA papers by countries? 
 
 
Figure 3. Percentage of SIA papers by countries [22] 
Figure 3 shows that the most frequent countries in the 
selected literature are from France (40.0%) and Poland 
(16.7%). France is the most frequent country because SIA

theory was originated with Regis Gras born in France. 
 
2) 
Which are the SIA papers types? 
 
Figure 4. Percentage of SIA papers by type [22] 
 
Figure 4 illustrates that studies from the chosen literature 
are 73% Articles, 20% Conference Papers, and 7% Book 
Chapter Books. This is because SIA international congress 
is producing new papers every two years. 
 
3) 
Which are the SIA papers areas? 
 
 
Figure 5. Percentage of SIA papers by Area [22] 
 
Figure 5 illustrates that most of the studies have targeted  
 
Computer Science (32.0%), Social Sciences (24.0%), 
Mathematics (23.6%) and Decision Sciences (6%). The four 
areas added are approximately 80%, this is because SIA 
theory was originated on didactic, mathematics and his 
methods are used in computer science. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4) 
What are the SIA papers tendency? 
 
 
Figure 6. SIA papers by year 
 
 
Figure 6 shows the tendency of SIA papers in general (in 
red) and SIA real applications papers (in blue), in the last 
five years. SIA real applications papers tend to increase 
because there are fewer the theoretical, historical or a 
literature review papers than real applications papers. 
B. 
Systematic literarture review 
In this section we describe the results and their discussion 
about systematic review. 
 
1) 
Which KDD step is the closest to SIA papers.  
Steps 1 (Learning the application domain) and steps 2 
(Creating a target dataset) with 100 % both, are the steps 
closest to KDD steps. This is because, all SIA real 
applications papers need a goal and a target dataset.  
 
2) 
Which KDD step is the furthest from SIA papers? 
Step 7 (Data mining) with 31 %, is the step furthest to 
KDD steps. This is because, most papers showed not a Data 
Mining pattern clearly, had descriptive analysis, histograms, 
bar diagrams, box plots and SIA graphics like a similarity 
tree, cohesion tree, implicative graph or reduction.  
 
3) 
How close are the SIA papers to KDD steps? 
Table III shows the reference of 35 SIA papers, the 
compliance or not of KDD steps process 1 to 9 (see 
introduction, quality assessment and [18]).  Also, Table III 
shows in the last two columns the numbers of positive 
compliance and the respective percentage. The final 
percentage is the 74,6 %, which is medium high close to 
KDD steps process. This means that KDD steps process and 
SIA steps process are the same in a 74,6 %.

4) 
How close are the SIA papers to KDD subprocess? 
Table III shows the reference of 35 SIA papers, the 
compliance or not of KDD subprocess A to E (see 
introduction, quality assessment and [18]).  Table IV shows 
in the last two columns the numbers of positive compliance 
and the respective percentage. The final percentage 94,2 %, 
means that KDD and SIA subprocess are very similar. 
 
5) 
How close are the SIA papers to the Data Mining 
steps? 
 
Observing step 5 (Choosing the function of data mining, 
94%), step 6 (Choosing the data mining algorithm, 54%), 
step 7 (Data mining, 31%) and subprocess (Data mining, 
86%) we have 66.4% of approach to Data Mining process. It 
is a medium high percentage. This is because the SIA 
methods can be similar to the Data Mining methods.

Can you define the SIA process based in KDD 
process? 
 
The SIA definition based on the KDD process could be: 
 Statistical Implicative Analysis is the process of 
identifying valid, useful, and understandable, r-rules in data.  
In the previous SIA definition, the words valid, useful, and 
understandable depend on the researcher interpretation of 
the SIA methods used and the results obtained. The novel 
word is not in a SIA definition because the use of SIA 
methods is novel in Data Mining.

Can you define the process for SIA based KDD? 
Figure 7 shows the steps graphic constituting the SIA 
process (based in KDD).

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The aim of this paper is to describe SIA papers in last 5 
years (2012-2016), to determine the approximation of SIA 
to KDD and DM, and identify a series of future research. To 
describe SIA papers, we use the mapping and systematic 
literature review methods. The most frequent country in the 
selected literature is France (40%); also 73% of the chosen 
literature are Articles. The studies were targeted in 
Computer Science (32.0%), Social Sciences (24.0%), 
Mathematics (23.6%), and Decision Sciences (6%). The 
four areas are approximately 80% of SIA papers total areas. 
It is important to note that the results obtained depend 
closely on the approximation framework used, in this case 
the steps of the Faday process. It was determined that SIA 
and KDD are strongly related, with a contention relationship 
of SIA to KDD. In the first approximation, considering all 
steps without subprocesses, a contention of 74.6% 
corresponding to medium high approximation was obtained. 
In the second approach, considering all the subprocesses a 
contention of SIA to KDD of 94.2% was obtained that is 
high approximation to KDD process. This is summarized by 
indicating that the overall approximation rate considering 
the complete Faday process is 84.4%  which is medium high 
approximation. The approximation achieved allowed to 
propose the steps that constitute the SIA process analysis, 
besides a new definition. The process D and steps 5 and 6 
allowed us to give a first approximation of the SIA to data 
mining, obtaining 66.4% of contention between SIA and 
Data Mining corresponding to medium high percentage. 
 
The future research in SIA, KDD and Data Mining can be to 
answer the following questions: Do SIA methods work with 
big data? Can we use similarity tree and cohesion tree like a 
data mining hierarchical cluster method? Can we use 
implicative graph like a data mining rule induction method? 
and Can we use reduction like a data mining cluster 
method?. For example we have the questions:  Do SIA 
methods work with big data?  Can we use similarity tree and 
cohesion tree like a data mining hierarchical cluster 
method? Can we use reduction SIA method like a data 
mining cluster method? and Can we use implicative graph 
like a data mining rule induction method?. The answer to 
the abode questions is future research in SIA, KDD and 
Data Mining.
