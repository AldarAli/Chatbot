Abstract— Legacy telecommunication services have been 
tending to shift to All-IP networks from closed and circuit 
switched networks by the deployment of high bandwidth and 
stable mobile broadband networks such as Long Term 
Evolution (LTE). The shift to an All-IP network leads to the 
integration of telecommunication services and internet services, 
which are called Over-The-Top (OTT) services. The trend 
towards increasing and unpredictable traffic makes it 
important for the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which is a 
call control system running over the All-IP network, to be 
flexible and reliable. With that goal, the authors have proposed 
an IMS reconfiguration mechanism using call session state 
migration, which allows the IMS to distribute live call sessions 
as required by the failure of IMS servers and the quantity of 
calls in progress. Furthermore, in this paper we propose a 
model to determine the configuration of the IMS dynamically 
from the perspective of electrical power consumption and 
performance. A formula based on the model calculates which 
IMS servers should be active and which call sessions should 
move to which IMS servers to reduce the overall power 
consumption, using linear programming. Moreover, this paper 
implements the proposal and shows its results.

INTRODUCTION 
In order to provide voice over IP (VoIP) service, mobile 
network operators (MNOs) are developing the IP multimedia 
subsystem (IMS) [1], which is a call control system over an 
IP 
network 
(adopted 
in 
GSMA 
[2]), 
to 
ensure 
interconnectivity between MNOs around the world. MNOs 
also plan to launch the Rich Communication Suite (RCS) [3], 
which will enable mobile phone users to use instant 
messaging, live video sharing, and file transfer over the IMS. 
In addition, through leveraging their IMS development, 
MNOs are now looking into the possibility of integrating 
Over-The-Top (OTT) services such as Google services, 
Facebook, and Skype. 
The support of these future services in addition to legacy 
telecommunication services such as voice and Short Message 
Service (SMS) has resulted in an increase in signaling traffic 
in the IMS. It is difficult to estimate the required system 
capacity for the increase because OTT services are created 
by third parties outside MNO's awareness. To continue to 
deal with increasing and unpredictable traffic without 
investing in extra capacity, enhanced flexibility is desirable 
in the operation of the call session control functions (CSCFs) 
of which the IMS is composed. For example, in case of 
server failure or disaster, it is desirable to ensure reliability 
by continuing the processing of CSCFs on other servers, thus 
preventing service disruption. On the other hand, it is 
desirable to minimize the number of running servers, to 
decrease power consumption. 
In order to realize the desired flexibility, we have 
proposed call session state migration [4], which allows 
call/service sessions to continue to be processed on another 
CSCF. The proposed method mainly involves a migration of 
the session states between CSCFs and a routing mechanism 
for control messages in the IMS without extensions to the 
standard procedure for control of a call/service session. 
However, the MNOs still need to decide which sessions 
should move to which CSCFs and which server can be 
stopped, even if the method provides for flexibility in the 
IMS configuration.  This makes IMS reconfiguration more 
difficult as the number of CSCFs increases. 
Thus, in this paper, we propose a model of IMS 
reconfiguration to determine the IMS configuration 
dynamically and easily so as to minimize power 
consumption and provide enough performance. The model 
incorporates the power consumption of the IMS so that the 
IMS can provide enough performance, while considering the 
power consumption of the reconfiguration, including all 
session state migration and running CSCFs. We solve the 
model and determine the reconfiguration by using linear 
programming [5]. Furthermore, we implement our proposal 
and the measurement metrics required for our model, and 
show the result of our proposal in a real environment. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
describes the IMS architecture and the call session state 
migration. Section 3 proposes a model of the IMS 
reconfiguration and its formula for linear programming. 
Section 4 shows our implementation and results of the 
experiment. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.

CALL  SESSION STATE MIGRATION 
A. IMS Architecture and Call Session Control 
Fig. 1 shows the basic IMS network configuration.  The 
following IMS components are located in the IMS core 
network that an MNO manages and operates: an Home 
Subscriber Server (HSS), which is a database server for 
managing subscribers, an Serving Call Session Control 
Function (S-CSCF), which is the main Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) [6] server for call control, a Proxy CSCF(P-

CSCF) that communicates with the User Equipment (UE) 
directly and establishes a secure connection to it, an 
Interrogating CSCF (I-CSCF), which is a kind of resolver of 
SIP message routing, and an Interconnection Border Control 
Function (IBCF) that is a gateway for other MNO’s IMSs. 
Furthermore, an Session Border Controller (SBC) providing 
a variety of functions for security and connectivity (e.g., 
access control, topology hiding, NAT traversal, protocol 
interworking, and media monitoring) is defined and often 
integrated into the P-CSCF and the IBCF in a real operation. 
A UE connects with the IMS through the IP core network 
and wireless access networks such as EV-DO [7] and Long 
Term Evolution (LTE) [8]. 
In the IMS, SIP is used for call control between CSCFs 
and UEs. First, a UE registers with the IMS before obtaining 
IMS services. The UE conducts its registration with an S-
CSCF via a P-CSCF and an I-CSCF. The S-CSCF assigned 
by the I-CSCF verifies the UE based on its authentication 
information stored in the HSS. After that, the UE uses IMS 
services by sending and receiving SIP messages to/from a 
correspondent UE via the P-CSCF, S-CSCF, and I-CSCF. 
For example, when the UE makes a call, the UE sends an 
INVITE message to the correspondent UE and establishes a 
session to communicate the required information. The 
exchanged SIP messages take, as shown in Fig. 1, the 
following path: UE#1 (caller), P-CSCF#1, S-CSCF#1, I-
CSCF#1, I-CSCF#2, S-CSCF#2, P-CSCF#2, and UE#2 
(callee). Note that the assigned P-CSCF and S-CSCF of UEs 
hold states of register and sessions and each SIP message 
includes route information to their CSCFs, thus once CSCFs 
begin to handle the session of the UEs, it is not possible to 
change CSCFs to process the sessions in the standard 
procedures. 
B. Call Session State Migration and Determinaton of IMS 
Reconfiguration 
We have proposed a call session state migration 
mechanism [4], which allows sessions to continue to be 
processed on another CSCF in order to cope with server 
failure and dynamically change the number of physical 
servers to match the network and resource usage situation. 
The method mainly consists of the migration of session 
states between CSCFs and route control of SIP messages as 
shown in Fig. 2. The session states are migrated through a 
backup server in order to backstop server failure. The routing 
of SIP messages is controlled by using OpenFlow [9] to hide 
changes in the IP address of CSCFs. OpenFlow is a flow-
based routing protocol, and we enhanced SBC to map 
between SIP sessions and flows of the OpenFlow network. 
This mechanism supports granular session migration to 
realize effective resource use. 
While the session migration mechanism has been 
proposed, MNOs still need to decide which sessions should 
move to which CSCFs and which server can be stopped. If 
there is obvious trouble such as a server failure, MNOs can 
decide easily. However, if there are a few hundred servers in 
the IMS, it is difficult to estimate outcomes and quickly 
make a decision appropriate to the situation. Thus, a model 
to determine the IMS configuration dynamically is needed to 
support the operation of a flexible IMS. 
C. Related Work 
The study of optimized configuration in networks and 
SIP servers has a long history of improving performance 
such as traffic throughput, and maximizing the amount of 
processing using limited resources. Some studies [10][11] 
tried load balancing of processing to improve the 
performance of SIP servers. Another investigation [12] tried 
to propose an effective route for reducing message delay. 
Analysis of the IMS, which has additional processing 
compared with basic SIP procedures, has also been 
undertaken. N. Rajagopal et al.[13] analyzed IMS processing 
based on queuing of SIP messages and estimated the 
overload of each CSCF based on the SIP processing 
sequence.  
The above works focused mainly on calculating the 
capability of the IMS in advanced before operation. On the 
other hand, the concept of effective resource use on demand 
has been also proposed, based on the perspective of flexible 
resource balancing using the recent development of 
virtualization technologies, rather than improvement in 
performance using limited resources [14]. This study 
proposed live session migration between physical servers by 
using a virtualized machine’s live migration on demand. V. 
Petrucci et al. [15] have proposed the concept of calculating

the required minimum number of servers and stopping the 
extra servers to save power in cluster environments. 
However, in dynamic IMS reconfiguration, we need to 
consider the specific IMS configuration and the cost of the 
reconfiguration, and in particular, live session migration. In 
addition, some metrics for the calculation must be measured 
in a real environment to evaluate their adequacy.  
III. 
PROPOSED MODEL OF DYNAMIC IMS 
RECONFIGURATION 
A. Modeling Aproach based on Power Consumption 
As an index to characterize IMS reconfiguration, we 
focus on the reduction of power consumption of the IMS 
because the purpose of a flexible IMS is to supply sufficient 
IMS capacity on demand while using minimum facilities. In 
our approach, we estimate all power consumption required 
for running the IMS and executing the reconfiguration, and 
use a linear programming method to try to reduce the total 
amount while still providing stable IMS service.  
In contrast to a static IMS configuration, a dynamically 
reconfigurable IMS can change its configuration as many 
times as needed depending on the momentary situation, such 
as the number of calls. Thus, we also consider the cycle of 
IMS reconfiguration. Otherwise, even if the number of 
servers and their power consumption could be reduced on a 
temporary basis, the total power consumption might actually 
increase if the reconfiguration and call session state 
migration happened frequently.  
B. Reference Model of IMS Reconfiguration 
Fig. 3 shows a reference model of IMS reconfiguration, 
consisting of two IMS configurations and the transition 
between them. In the IMS, there are several nodes, which are 
fundamental physical servers. An Functional Entity (FE) is a 
running and session-processing entity such as a P-CSCF on a 
node. Here, for simplicity, just one FE will run on one node 
and just one type of FE shall exist in this model so that we 
can consider this model for each type of FE independently. 
In addition, nodes in the IMS can be turned off and on for 
power saving. 
The following parameters are introduced for nodes and 
FE of the reference model.

C. Formulation  for Linear Programming 
To obtain the most suitable reconfiguration by using 
linear programming, in this section we will formulate the 
reference model of the previous section. Here, the objective 
function to be minimized by linear programming is the 
power consumption required for running the IMS and 
executing the reconfiguration.  
The power consumption of the reference mode falls into 
three categories. The first is running power, which is 
consumed by running nodes and processing sessions. It 
depends on their running time, thus it is given by:



Secondly, the power is consumed by switching node 
states such as booting and shutdown. The total power 
consumed for them is given by: 
                                


Thirdly, the migration of sessions from one FE to another 
consumes power in signaling overhead. The total power 
consumed for migrating sessions between nodes is given by:

Then, the objective function to be minimized can be 
expressed as the sum of the above: 
                       
PCM
PCS
PCR
OF



 
(8) 
In addition to the objective function, there are several 
constraints for the linear programming to take into account. 
The number of sessions cannot be larger than the FE 
capacity and its utilization to provide stable IMS capacity. 
The constraint is given by: 
                                   
K U
M
n
n 
 
 (9) 
The session transfer time is assumed to be lower than a 
given threshold in order to satisfy quality-of-service 
requirements because a large reconfiguration has an impact 
on stability of the IMS service. The constraint to suppress 
excessively large reconfigurations is given by:

Finally, the ratios of sessions to be migrated and to be 
kept on the same node should sum to one. This constraint is 
given by:



(11) 
D. Cycle of IMS Reconfiguration 
In order to reduce the power consumption of the 
reference model in a certain period of time, the cycle of the 
reconfiguration is also important because the IMS can 
execute the reconfiguration as many times as needed in the 
period. 
The 
objective 
function 
(8) 
expresses 
one 
reconfiguration from state Zpre to state Z and the current state 
Z during R. Thus, the total objective function during a certain 
period which includes state Z∈Ztotal is as described below. 
                          



Ztotal

(12) 
Ztotal is a set of state Z during the period. However, it is 
difficult to solve OFtotal all at once. Thus, the system 
evaluates the objective function (8) periodically and executes 
a reconfiguration based on the result step by step. If the 
following equation (13) is satisfied, the reconfiguration 
should 
be 
executed. 
The 
IMS 
also 
executes 
the 
reconfiguration if constraint (9) is not satisfied in the current 
state due to changing of Mn.

(13) 
This means that if the power consumption of the 
reconfiguration (6) + (7) is smaller than the expected 
reduction going from the previous state Zpre to the next state 
Z during R, the reconfiguration should be done. However, 
note that this depends on value of the expected R. Thus, to 
improve the accuracy of the model, an estimation of R based 
on the call rate in an actual environment is desirable. 
IV. 
IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION 
A. Implementation and Experiment Configuration 
To solve our objective function describing the reference 
model, we used CPLEX [5], which can solve large linear 
problems. In addition, we implemented the IMS on real 
 
Figure 4.
Experimental Network Configuration

machines to obtain the parameters required for the reference 
model and to verify our proposal. 
Fig. 4 shows our experimental network configuration. In 
the IMS network, CSCFs and an eSBC are connected via an 
OpenFlow switch. A UE Simulator connects to the IMS 
through the eSBC. A session controller connects to the 
CSCFs, OpenFlow switch, and eSBC via a HUB. An HSS 
also connects to the CSCFs via the OpenFlow switch. Table. 
I shows the specifications of the components. The P/I/S-
CSCFs and HSS were built based on the Open IMS core [16], 
which is an open-source SIP server. We implemented the 
required modules of the CSCFs for our proposed mechanism 
and the required software for the session controller and 
eSBC. We simulated a large UE load by using ims_bench 
[17], which is load testing software for the IMS (also open-
source). The controller periodically collects the number of 
sessions from each CSCF. Then on the basis of its 
information, the controller calculates the objective function 
and executes the reconfiguration if the result satisfies the 
criterion in (13).  
B. Measurements 
We executed the basic calls and their session migration to 
obtain the parameters required for evaluating the objective 
function. UEs registered with four S-CSCFs through four P-
CSCFs, and then the UEs continued to make calls to keep 
certain sessions at each P-CSCF. Here the duration of each 
call was 120 seconds. Then, we performed call session 
migration between P-CSCFs and turned the nodes on/off. 
The result is shown in Table II. The values are averages for 
four P-CSCFs. Note that here we adopted a P-CSCF as the 
target FE and measured the parameters. Of course, we can 
measure S-CSCF in the same way. 
On basis of the obtained parameters, we wrote scripts for 
CPLEX for the objective function and the constraint 
conditions. Then we verified the behavior of the dynamic 
determination of the reconfiguration and measured the power 
consumption of each P-CSCF while performing calling, call 
session migration, and turning nodes on/off. First, UEs made 
calls through four P-CSCFs randomly, and then increased the 
number of calls to exceed the upper limit of the P-CSCF. We 
observed the behavior of the reconfiguration caused by the 
constraint condition. Secondly, the UEs reduced the number 
of sessions enough to turn off one node and observed the 
behavior of the reconfiguration. Then, the UEs increased the 
number of sessions from the reduced number enough to turn 
on an additional node, and we observed the behavior in the 
same way. Finally, the UEs cycled through a decrease and 
increase, and we evaluated the reduction in power 
consumption compared with the existing static IMS 
configuration, which was simply traditional operation where 
no reconfiguration was executed and the four nodes were 
kept running.

C. Results and Discussion 
Fig. 5 shows the load balancing behavior of the 
reconfiguration when the number of sessions exceeds the 
upper limit of the P-CSCF, which is 14,400 sessions (18,000
× 0.8). The reconfiguration began to be executed with 
periodical timing of calculating criterion in (13). The excess 
sessions on P-CSCF#1 were migrated to P-CSCF#3. Fig. 6 
shows the behavior of the reconfiguration when the number 
of sessions was reduced. “Static Total Power” in the figure is 
the power consumption in the static IMS configuration, as in 
traditional operation. In our proposal, all sessions of a P-
CSCF on a node were migrated to other P-CSCFs and the 
node was turned off. On a temporary basis, its power 
consumption increased, but it became smaller than the static 
power consumption after the reconfiguration. Fig. 7 shows 
the behavior of the reconfiguration when the number of 
sessions increased. In the beginning, the power consumption 
in our proposal was small because the number of running 
nodes was small. After that, it increased temporarily to equal 
the static power consumption for turning on a node and 
processing more sessions. Fig. 8 shows the power saving 
with our proposal compared with the static power 
consumption while running for one hour. During the period, 
we repeated the behaviors of Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The interval 
time is the time for one cycle of reducing and increasing 
sessions (R = (interval time)/2). When the cycle of 
reconfiguration was long enough, although that depends on 
the situation, the power consumption was reduced by 5.9%. 
The amount of reduction becomes larger depending on the 
situation such as the changing number of nodes and sessions. 
Thus we verified the value of dynamic determination and 
reconfiguration to reduce power consumption based on our 
proposed model and formula for linear programming in a 
real environment. To use linear programming to obtain an 
optimized solution, we approximated the non-linear values 
as accurately as possible with linear values calculated from 
their averages. This does not have a large impact on our 
proposal, and could be made more precise by formulating the 
non-linear values in a more rigorous manner. Also we can 
apply our proposal to larger configurations because the time 
to solve the linear problem was about 5 seconds, and larger 
problems can be solved within practical time constraints.

CONCLUSION 
We have focused on the dynamic determination of IMS 
reconfiguration in a flexible IMS environment that can 
change its configuration by live session migration and 
turning nodes on/off. In order to realize this, we proposed a 
model of the reconfiguration and formulation to be solved by 
linear programming with the goal of saving power. 
Furthermore, we implemented a dynamic reconfigurable 
IMS that used our proposal, and verified that the 
reconfiguration reduced power consumption.
