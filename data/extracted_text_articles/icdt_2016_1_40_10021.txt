Abstract—The demand for Location Based Service (LBS) is 
increasing in the development of communication and mobile 
technologies. Moreover, location determination technologies 
especially for indoor environments are getting a lot of attention. 
Most indoor positioning methods just make use of Received 
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements that generate 
from the same floor. However, usually RSSI measurements are 
available from different floors. In that case, we have to consider 
the Dilution of Precision (DOP) used in satellite positioning 
systems. With this in mind, we can choose a better Access Point 
(AP) configuration than that of when using only APs in the same 
floor. In this paper, to improve the accuracy of indoor 
positioning, we propose an indoor positioning method that 
includes APs placed in different floors and takes into 
consideration the DOP.

INTRODUCTION  
Positioning technologies can be separated into two groups, 
that is, outdoor positioning and indoor positioning. In outdoor 
positioning, Global Positioning System (GPS) [1] is a 
common example of such technologies. In indoor positioning, 
several methods, WLAN, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc., have been 
developed depending on the situation [2]. However, WLAN 
measurement based indoor positioning methods are becoming 
a strong candidate for positioning in such environments. 
The existing methods for indoor positioning that we 
evaluate, usually, take advantage of the properties that the 
received signal strength has, to determine the distance from an 
AP to a mobile station, in order to obtain its location [3]. 
Usually, indoor positioning methods based on IEEE 802.11 
WLAN information only make use of RSSI measurements 
that generate from the same floor. However, in regular indoor 
environments such as commercial or office buildings, RSSI 
measurements from APs in different floors can be detected, 
and dilution of precision can be used to increase the accuracy 
of these measurements [4]. 
 
 
 
Given this, in the following paper, we propose an indoor 
positioning method that considers APs in different floors in 
order to increase the accuracy of the positioning system. 
This paper presents in its second section descriptions for 
the RSSI penetrated channel model and for dilution of 
precision. The third section introduces the proposed 
positioning method using DOP and an overview of the 
simulation parameters and results. In section four, we present 
our conclusions. 
II.  
RSSI PENETRATED CHANNEL MODEL AND DOP 
A. RSSI Penetrated Channel Model 
The RSSI defines a measurement of the RF energy and its 
unit is dBm. The RSSI decreases exponentially as the distance 
from the AP increases. Because of these characteristics, in this 
paper we use an RSSI attenuation model given by [5] 

RSSI[dBm] = −10n log10
𝑑
𝑑0 + 𝐴


d[m] = 10
RSSI−A
−10n 

In (1), n is the attenuation factor, parameter A is the offset 
which is the measured RSSI value at a reference point (usually 
1 meter) from the AP. And d is the distance from the AP to 
the point of measurement. d0 is the reference point distance. 
These parameters reflect the indoor propagation environment. 
Because RSSI is a sensitive parameter, it is affected by the 
environment significantly. 
In practical situations, many factors that can affect the RSSI 
value exist, such as furniture, walls, and people. These factors 
can produce signal scattering and multi-path effects. They can 
also result in positioning errors. In order to reduce positioning 
errors, proper parameter determination is necessary. 
The penetrated channel model shows the RSSI when 
measured through an additional layer. Figure 1 shows a 
schematic of the penetrated channel model.

Figure 1. Penetrated Channel Model. 
Each 
layer 
is 
separated 
by 
the 
floor.  
The floor has an attenuation factor which is different from the 
indoor environment. Also, the reference point changes from 
𝑑0 to ℎ𝑛. Therefore the penetrated channel model equation in 
the floor is as follows: 
RSSI[dBm] = −10𝑛𝑓 log10
𝑑
ℎ𝑛 + (−10𝑛 log10 ℎ𝑛 + 𝐴). 
In (3), 𝑛𝑓 is the attenuation factor in the floor, height ℎ𝑛 is 
the distance between the floor layer and the ceiling layer. 
When an RF signal passes through the floor the attenuation 
factor comes back to n and the reference point changes to 
ℎ𝑛+1 which is the distance between one floor layer and the 
next. So, the penetrated channel model equation in the next 
layer is 
RSSI[dBm] = −10𝑛 log10
𝑑
ℎ𝑛+1 ℎ𝑛 + (−10𝑛𝑓 log10
ℎ𝑛+1
ℎ𝑛 −
10𝑛 log10 ℎ𝑛 + 𝐴).

By defining the penetrated channel model, even APs that 
are located on a different layer are available for positioning. 
B. DOP(Dilution of Precision) 
The effect of satellite geometry is quantified in the measure 
called Dilution of Precision, or DOP. DOP does not depend 
on anything that cannot be predicted in advance. It only 
depends on the positions of the GPS satellites relative to the 
GPS location of the receiver. The satellite position is known 
in advance, and GPS position is also fixed, thus the DOP of a 
GPS system can be calculated even without using the GPS 
system. 
The problem of defining if the DOP is poor or good due to 
satellite geometry remains. When satellites are located at 
wide angles relative to each other, this configuration 
minimizes the error in position calculations. On the other 
hand, when satellites are grouped together or located in a line 
the geometry will be poor.  
 
DOP is often divided into several components which are 
listed below [6]: 
 VDOP: Vertical DOP 
 HDOP: Horizontal DOP 
 PDOP: Positional DOP  
 GDOP: Geometric DOP 
These components are used due to the variation of accuracy 
of the GPS system. The PDOP is most used among other 
components. The positioning error of PDOP is calculated 
from the data of GPS receiver multiplied by range error which 
is given by  
 
Positioning Error = Range Error ∗ PDOP. 
(5) 
A DOP of 2 means that whatever the range error was, the 
final positioning error will be twice as big.  
For example, if the User Estimated Range Error (UERE) is 
10 meters and the PDOP is 2, the final positioning error will 
be 20 meters. 
1) Computation of DOP: As a first step of computing 
DOP, consider the unit vectors from the receiver to satellite i 
[6] 
 
(
𝑥𝑖−𝑥
𝑅𝑖 ,
𝑦𝑖−𝑦
𝑅𝑖 ,
𝑧𝑖−𝑧
𝑅𝑖 ) 
(6) 
Where: 
𝑅𝑖 = √(𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥)2 + (𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦)2 + (𝑧𝑖 − 𝑧)2 
x, y, z: position of the receiver 
xi, yi, zi: position of the satellite 
The formula (6) in matrix form is given by 
 
𝐴 =
[
 
 
 
 
 
 
𝑥1−𝑥
𝑅1
𝑦1−𝑦
𝑅1
𝑧1−𝑧
𝑅1
−1
𝑥2−𝑥
𝑅2

−1
𝑥4−𝑥
𝑅4
𝑦4−𝑦
𝑅4
𝑧4−𝑧
𝑅4
−1]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(7) 
The first three elements of each row of A are the 
components of a unit vector from the receiver to the indicated 
satellite. Since the number of APs is three, the minimum 
number of APs required, we assume the fourth vector to have 
an infinite value and thus set every element to -1. 
Formulate the matrix, Q, as 
 
𝑄 = (𝐴𝑇𝐴)−1 =
[
 
 
 
 𝜎𝑥

𝜎𝑥𝑦
𝜎𝑥𝑧
𝜎𝑥𝑡
𝜎𝑥𝑦

𝜎𝑥𝑧
𝜎𝑦𝑧
𝜎𝑧
2
𝜎𝑧𝑡
𝜎𝑥𝑡
𝜎𝑦𝑡
𝜎𝑧𝑡
𝜎𝑡
2 ]
 
 
 
 
 
(8) 
From Q, the DOP can be calculated as 
 
𝑃𝐷𝑂𝑃 = √𝜎𝑥2 + 𝜎𝑦2 + 𝜎𝑧2

PROPOSED POSITIONING METHOD AND SIMULATION 
A. Proposed Positioning Method 
We propose a method that is divided into two steps. First, 
we scan APs. Then, we measure the received signal strength 
indicator and determine on which floor the AP is located. 
Next, we compute the DOP of each combination of APs. 
Then, a combination of three of the APs with the best DOP is 
selected and we use this combination for positioning.

Figure 2 is a representation of the proposed positioning 
algorithm used in our method. 
B. Simulation 
We conducted experiments in Kyungpook National 
University’s IT-1 building. This building’s hn is 2.57m, hn+1 is 
3.74m, and the attenuation factor n is 2.9, nf is 7.02. 
We used IpTIME N3004 model APs, Broadcom laptop 
embedded wireless network cards, and software for collecting 
the RSSI. 
Figure 3 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function 
(CDF) for both the existing method and the proposed method. 
Ninety percent of the proposed method’s CDF is less than 
1.2m. However, ninety percent of the existing method’s CDF 
is less than 2.2m.

As shown in Table 1, the positioning error of the proposed 
method is less than that of the existing method by 0.32 meters. 
The existing method uses an RSSI attenuation model in a 
WLAN environment without taking the DOP into 
consideration.  
IV.  
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper proposes an indoor positioning method using 
IEEE 802.11 WLAN RSSI measurements considering the 
penetrated channel model. In order to enhance indoor 
positioning accuracy, we use different layer APs. The 
proposed method in this paper can enhance the positioning 
accuracy in multilayer-buildings and wall-through indoor 
environments. The simulation results show that the 
positioning error of the proposed method is less than that of 
existing method by 0.32m. 
In the future, an integrated model is necessary to consider 
penetration as well as diffraction. Also, when a positioning 
error occurs there is RSSI error as well. Given this, a filter for 
correcting the RSSI error should be developed.
