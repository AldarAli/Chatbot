Abstract—The conventional soft frequency reuse (SFR) scheme 
has been considered as a useful means of inter-cell interference 
coordination (ICIC) in the downlink of cellular OFDMA 
systems. It is based on hard reservation, which partitions the 
resource regions into two orthogonal portions, one solely 
dedicated to users in the cell center and the other solely 
dedicated to those in the cell edge. In this paper, we consider 
the variants of SFR scheme, which are based on a notion of soft 
reservation. As they allow for sharing a whole resource region 
among all or some users, the wider resource region leads to the 
multi-user diversity gain, whiles still maintaining a feature of 
interference mitigation by power control and dynamic 
interference avoidance by opportunistic scheduling in each cell. 
We demonstrate that a soft reservation-based SFR scheme can 
be the best means of trading off the average system throughput 
and edge-user throughput.

 INTRODUCTION 
Link adaptation has been a common means of dealing with 
co-channel interference (CCI) under time-varying and 
location-dependent situations in cellular OFDMA systems. 
However, it cannot be a means of improving the spectrum 
efficiency of users at the cell edge as it cannot reduce the 
CCI itself. Thus, various types of inter-cell interference 
coordination (ICIC) schemes are considered for combating 
the CCI problem in the cellular OFDMA network [1] . In 
general, ICIC may involve a complex optimization 
procedure with exchanging inter-cell information.  
    Meanwhile, inter-cell frequency reuse scheme is one 
particular type of ICIC from the previous works, which does 
not require for sharing any inter-cell information. It divides 
the frequency band into orthogonal channels, a subset of 
which will be allocated to the different cells so that the inter-
cell interference can be mitigated by the sufficient frequency 
reuse distance. In the cellular OFDMA system, for example, 
a fractional frequency reuse (FFR) scheme is one particle 
example of realizing the frequency reuse strategy, which 
deals with the orthogonal frequency bands. In the frequency 
reuse scheme, the most important design criterion is to trade-
off the performance gain with interference mitigation subject 
to the larger reuse distance and performance degradation 
with the reduced amount of resource. In other words, the 
overall system throughput must be maximized by trading off 
these two aspects.  
There are two different types of FFR schemes: Partial 
Frequency Reuse (PFR) scheme [2] and Soft Frequency 
Reuse (SFR) scheme [3]. Dividing a resource region into two 
orthogonal portions, the PFR scheme employs the different 
frequency reuse factors (K) for the different portion in each 
cell, e.g., K = 1 for the resource allocated to the cell-center 
users and K = 3 for the resource allocated to the cell-edge 
users, so that all users can be loosely protected by the 
sufficient reuse distance. As opposed to the PFR scheme, the 
SFR scheme can fully use the frequency band in each cell by 
mitigating the inter-cell interference with power control. This 
particular scheme has been introduced in the early 
standardization stage of 3GPP LTE system. Even if no 
explicit specification has been provided, the ICIC parameters 
in the current LTE standard can be used to support the SFR 
scheme. 
We find that the conventional PFR/SFR scheme is based 
on hard reservation, which partitions the resource region into 
two orthogonal portions, one solely dedicated to users in the 
cell center and the other solely dedicated to those in the cell 
edge. This kind of resource allocation which restricts 
resource region to each user can ensure an SINR gain in 
average manner. As described in [4] and [5], however, it 
hurts a multi-user diversity gain and fairness of resource 
allocation, especially when the users are not uniformly 
distributed throughout the coverage. These problems can be 
handled by a soft reservation mechanism, which allows for 
sharing a whole resource region among all or some users. By 
employing soft reservation, the wider resource region leads 
to a more multi-user diversity gain and fairer resource 
allocation [4][5]. However, it is not straightforward to 
warrant the average SINR gain.  
    In this paper, we consider the variants of SFR scheme, 
which are based on a notion of soft reservation. Our 
objective is to analyze their system throughput so that their 
performance can be characterized under the varying 
conditions. Ultimately, we are expecting to identify the best 
means of trading off the average system throughput and 
edge-user throughput.  
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, we describe the SFR scheme and present its 
system model. A notion of soft reservation is introduced in 
Section III, leading to the variants of the SFR schemes. The 
performance characteristics of those variants are investigated 
in Section IV and the concluding remarks are presented in 
Section V.

SOFT FREQUENCY REUSE SCHEME: SYSTEM MODEL 
In the soft frequency reuse (SFR) scheme, the users are 
classified into the different groups, depending on their 
location within the cell. Without loss of generality, we 
consider a special case of two user groups. More 
specifically, the users in each cell site belong to the center-
user group 
C
U  or edge-user group 
E
U . The various design 
criteria can be employed to determine 
E
U  and 
C
U  [6]. For 
example, the users with their average SINR greater than the 
given threshold 
S
  are grouped into 
C
U  while those with 
the average SINR less than 
S
  are grouped into 
E
U  [3]. 
The different power levels, 
H
P  and 
LP , are employed for 
E
U  and 
C
U , respectively (
H
L
P
 P
). As illustrated in Fig. 1, 
SINR of the cell-edge users will be enhanced with the 
higher power level and furthermore, with the partial 
frequency reuse, i.e., allowing no other edge users in the 
adjacent cells to reuse the same resource. Meanwhile, all 
remaining resources are allocated to the center-user group, 
with the lower power level, which allows for the full 
frequency reuse among all the cells.  
   In the current design, let us consider the SINR trade-off 
between 
E
U  and 
C
U  for the illustrative example in Fig. 2. 
Here, we assume that there is the power difference of  dB 
between

cells as shown by the typical hexagonal cell structure in Fig.

VARIANTS OF SFR SCHEMES: HARD RESERVATION VS. 
SOFT RESERVATION 
In this section, we consider the variants of SFR schemes, 
which differ by how the resources are shared between the 
users in 
E
U  and 
C
U , for performance comparison between 
hard and soft reservation. An obvious reference scheme is 
the one that does not employ the FFR scheme while 
allocating the power level of 
H
P  to all users (referred to as 
“Normal”). The conventional SFR scheme is characterized 
by hard reservation, which means that the resources are 
completely partitioned into two regions, one for 
E
U  and the 
other for 
C
U . Depending on whether the partitioned regions 
can be changed by adapting their boundary to the user 
distribution, it can be either dynamic or static. In the current 
comparative studies, we consider the static case in which the 
partitioned regions are fixed, i.e., referred to as “Static 
SFR.”  
Meanwhile, we consider two different variants of the 
static SFR schemes, which allows for sharing the reserved 
resource of each user group whenever necessary, e.g., when 
287

one resource region is overloaded by the non-uniform user 
distribution. In fact, there are two different extreme cases: 
one case of allowing the center users to share the resources 
reserved for the edge users and the other case of allowing 
the edge users to share the resources reserved for the center 
users. More specifically, the center users can employ K = 1 
with the power level of 
LP , i.e., allowed to borrow the 
resource reserved for the edge users (referred to “SFR-FCR: 
SFR with Full Center Reuse”). In other words, the resources 
for the edge users are only softly reserved as they are shared 
with the center users. As the lower power level is employed 
by the center users, the edge users are not suffered from the 
additional interference caused by soft reservation in this 
case.  
On the other hand, the edge user can employ K = 1 with 
the power level of 
H
P , i.e., allowed to use the resource 
reserved for the center users (referred to “SFR-FER: SFR 
with Full Edge Reuse”). In this case, some edge users will 
be suffered from the additional interference from the edge 
users that share the same resource reserved for the center 
users in some adjacent cells. In fact, SFR-FCR and SFR-
FER schemes are two extreme cases for SFR scheme subject 
to soft reservation. 
The most generalized form of soft reservation in SFR is 
to share all the resources among all users in the system. As a 
whole resource can be used by both center and edge users, it 
is just the same as the conventional scheme, except that two 
different power levels are employed, depending on their 
position. The advantage of the soft reservation-based SFR 
(SFR-SR) scheme would be to improve a multi-user 
diversity gain by extending the allocation region to a whole 
band. As mentioned earlier, however, SFR-SR cannot 
maintain a fixed SINR gain, as implied by (3). Fig. 3 
illustrates the various types of SFR schemes in the 
perspective of resource sharing and power allocation.  
In order to understand the characteristics of all these 
schemes, a notion of collision must be addressed from a 
viewpoint of inter-cell coordination. Collision can be 
roughly  understood as an event of failing the interference 
coordination that is intended by scheduling and power 
allocation, mainly due to the excessive other cell 
interference incurred by the high power level for the same 
resource shared between the adjacent cells. In this work, we 
define a rather quantitative notion of collision in the course

IV. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
Various types of the SFR schemes are evaluated with 
system-level simulation for 3GPP LTE system. Table 1 
summarizes the simulation parameters used in the current 
studies, including the system parameters for LTE 
specification. 
In order to capture the performance characteristics of 
individual SFR scheme, we consider four different scenarios 
that are varying with the fading characteristics and user-
grouping criterion. We consider two different user-grouping 
criteria with using the different thresholds: SINR threshold 
and ratio threshold. More specifically, UE can be grouped 
into an edge user set if its SINR drops below the given 
SINR threshold 
S
  (SINR threshold-based), or if its SINR 
is smaller than the lowest x-th percentile SINR (load 
threshold-based). The SINR threshold-based grouping may 
suffer from the situation that may turn too many UEs into 
the edge- or center-user group, i.e., incurring overload to 
one of two partitioned regions. Such an overload problem 
can be solved by the load threshold-based grouping, which 
sets the threshold by traffic load for edge users. In the 
following evaluation, we employ the load threshold-based 
user grouping. Meanwhile, we consider both fading and 
non-fading channels. The performance under a non-fading

resource allocation while eliminating the effect of 
opportunistic scheduling. Then, evaluations are carried for 
the following four different scenarios: 
Case i) SINR-based grouping subject to fading

Case iii) load-based grouping subject to fading 
Case iv) load-based grouping subject to no fading 
A. Limitation of hard reservation: Static SFR 
Fig. 4 shows the average 5th percentile user SINR while 
Fig. 5 shows the average 5th percentile and cell throughput

 varies. 
As shown in Fig. 4, SINRs of all schemes increase with   
up to a certain point, beyond which they decrease because 
the extremely high power for cell edge user would hurt the 
center users in the neighbor cells. In Fig 5, meanwhile, there 
is an obvious trade-off between 5th percentile and total 
average throughput as   increases up to a certain point, 
beyond which both 5th percentile and total average 
throughput decrease with  . These aspects are attributed to 
SINR degradation, as depicted in (3). More specifically, as 
the SINR of cell-center users is degraded with extremely 
large  , some of the center users tend to have 5th 
percentile SINR, which causes degradation in both 5th 
percentile and total throughput. The observations from Fig. 
4 and Fig. 5 imply that the range of    must be carefully 
chosen for our comparative studies, so as to make sure that 
both SINR and throughput are not degraded at the same 
time over the given range. Note that Static SFR has neither 
SINR gain nor loss at 
  0
, as clearly in (2) and (3). In Fig. 
4(a), however, its SINR is worse than that in the scheme that 
employs any ICIC (“Normal”), which is attributed to the 
hard reservation feature of the Static SFR. In fact, it is the 
feature that reduces the multi-user diversity gain in hard 
reservation. It is clear from Fig. 4(b), which demonstrates 
that there is no performance difference between Normal and 
Static SFR.   
The same reason for aforementioned 5th percentile SINR 
degradation in hard reservation can explain the difference in 
throughput gain for each scheme between case i) and case 
ii) in Fig. 5. However, the difference between case i) and 
case iii) cannot be clearly understood by the same reason. In 
fact, the different grouping criterion is applied to case i) and 
case iii), respectively. For the SINR threshold-based 
grouping in case i), the number of users in each group varies 
with the user distribution, which may overload one resource 
region over the other and thus, lead to degradation in 5th 
percentile throughput. In case iii), meanwhile, no such 
degradation is expected as the number of users in the cell-
edge group is pre-determined.  
We note that Static SFR in case iv) outperforms that in 
case ii) or case iii) for 5th percentile throughput 
performance in Fig. 5. It is due to the fact that case iv) 
inherits both features in case ii) and case iii).  
To summarize, any scheme based on hard reservation, 
including Static SFR, suffers from degradation in 
throughput performance by losing the multi-user diversity 
gain as well as the efficiency in resource allocation.   
B. SFR-FCR vs. SFR-FER schemes 
SFR-FCR and SFR-FER are SFR schemes that employ 
soft reservation, allowing one resource region to be shared 
by the other user group. Comparison between these two 
schemes may be useful for characterizing the performance 
of soft reservation.  
In case i) of Fig. 4, SFR-FCR and SFR-FER have the 
5th percentile SINR gain of 0.3dB and 0.5dB over that of 
Static SFR with 
  0
. These 5th percentile SINR gains are 
attributed to the multi-user diversity gain obtained by soft 
reservation, which is supported by observation that neither 
SFR-FCR nor SFR-FER show any SINR gain with 
  0
. 
Note that SFR-FER has the better SINR gain with 
  0
, 
which is due to the fact that wider resource region is used by 
those in the cell-edge user group, improving the multi-user 
diversity gain. As   increases, however, the SINR gain for 
SFR-FCR improves while that for SFR-FER decreases.  The 
performance difference between SFR-FCR and SFR-FER is 
attributed to the situation that the low power 
LP  can be 
allocated to resource region for the cell-edge users with 
SFR-FCR , warranting the SINR better than (3) for the cell-
center users, while the high power 
H
P  can be allocated to 
resource region for the cell-center users with SFR-FER, 
degrading the SINR worse than (3) for the cell-center users

Fig. 5. Trade-off relation: 5th percentile vs. total throughput 
 
in each cell. 
Furthermore, SFR-FCR and SFR-FER show the 
opposite characteristics in the average total throughput 
performance.  In general, SFR-FCR tends to improve the  
total average throughput, while SFR-FER tends to improve 
the 5th percentile throughput. The difference can be 
explained as follows. The total average throughput for SFR-
FCR improves as more resource is allocated to 
C
U  by soft 
reservation of the resource allocated to 
E
U . As shown in 
case i) of Fig. 5, therefore, it outperforms the Normal 
scheme in the total average throughput, while reducing the 
5th percentile throughput. By the similar reason, meanwhile, 
the average throughput for 
E
U  improves with SFR-FER, 
which subsequently improves the 5th percentile throughput 
as the low throughput users tend to belong to 
E
U . The total 
average throughput of SFR-FER is much worse than 
Normal and Static SFR, as the resource allocated to 
C
U  is 
reduced.  
     In conclusion, we find that soft reservation only for one 
user group improves the performance of the user group 
subject to hard reservation. Furthermore, soft reservation of 
the resource for the lower SINR user group is more effective 
for throughput trade-off.  
C. Performance of soft reservation: SFR-SR 
In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the SFR-SR scheme turns out to 
provide the best trade-off performance. In Fig. 4(a), the 
difference among the largest SINRs of Static SFR, SFR-
SER, and SFR-SR is 0.64dB, while this is 0.01dB in Fig. 
4(b). It implies that SFR-SR has the larger multi-user 
diversity gain than SFR-FER and Static SFR, while 
maintaining almost the same level of SINR gain with power 
control for each user group as that with hard reservation in 
(2). Note that a soft reservation feature in SFR-SR cannot 
warrant the SINR gain in (2) only by the power control, 
without any means of inter-cell interference control. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
demonstrates 
a 
rather 
acceptable 
performance 
gain, 
which 
implies 
that 
performance 
degradation caused by collision is not significant. In fact, 
Fig. 6 shows the collision probability as varying  . Note 
that the collision probability of SFR-SR is twice as large as 
that of Static SFR, demonstrating their maximum difference 
of 15%. The SINR loss by the collision can be at most 
2.4dB in all SFR schemes, which corresponds to reduction 
in the bandwidth efficiency by 1/2 or less in the low SINR 
region. Therefore, the collision incurs reduction in 
bandwidth efficiency with the probability of 0.15 or less, 
which is also true for the cell-edge user group.  
In general, downlink interference is usually dominated 
by a small number of base stations only [10]. In other words, 
a change in total interference is mainly governed by that in 
the dominant interferers. When   is small as compared to 
the change in the channel gain, therefore, the effect of   on 
total interference can be negligible. When the gain of 
interference channel is large enough, interference is still 
large for any level of power over each scheduling period. 
Therefore, other users with the lower gain of interference 
channel must be allocated to the corresponding resource. 
The current explanation can be supported by the results in 
Fig. 6, which shows that the collision probability increases 
with   .  
Meanwhile, we note that SFR-SR is free from any 
imbalance in resource allocation between each user group, 
which is caused by hard reservation, since the required 
resource for each user group is dynamically determined by 
user scheduling. Such a desirable feature supports the fact 
that SFR-SR provides the best trade-off relation for average 
throughput as shown in case iv) of Fig. 5.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We have shown that a soft reservation-based SFR 
scheme can be a useful alternative to the variants of the hard 
reservation-based conventional SFR scheme. More 
specifically, it can be more flexible and adaptive to the 
varying user distribution in practice. Performance analysis 
with our simulation for LTE system has demonstrated that 
the proposed soft-reservation approach performs fairly well, 
even if there is no explicit coordination among the neighbor 
cells. In fact, a virtual coordination is realized by avoiding

hard reservation-based SFR scheme, in which a multi-user 
diversity gain is limited by partitioning the resource regions 
in an orthogonal manner. As the overall performance 
depends on how frequently interference measurement is 
made in each cell, our future work will investigate the 
validity of the soft reservation-based SFR scheme upon the 
system dynamics and user distribution.
