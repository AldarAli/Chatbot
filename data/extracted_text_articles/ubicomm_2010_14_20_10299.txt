Abstract—To maximize lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks,
medium access control protocols usually trade off reliability for
energy efﬁciency. Channel errors, collisions, idle listening, and
overhearing further aggravate the problem. Our work inves-
tigates opportunities to improve reliability in Wireless Sensor
Networks under such constraints. We consider a multi-hop data
gathering network in which sensor nodes are deployed around a
sink. Nodes periodically sense data and forward it to next hop
nodes. For such a network, a Medium Access Control protocol,
called CPS-MAC, is proposed. This protocol uses cooperative
communication to improve reliability by using overhearing to its
advantage. In conventional protocols, overhearing causes nodes
to receive packets which are not meant for them. Therefore, these
packets are discarded and considered a waste of energy. On the
contrary, CPS-MAC intentionally wakes up next 1-hop and 2-
hop neighbors to improve their chances of overhearing a packet.
The overheard packets are buffered and then relayed to the next
hop neighbor, combating channel fading by a cooperative spatial
diversity gain. By combining multiple copies of the same packet,
next hop neighbor is more likely to recover the original packet.
Design challenges such as efﬁciently waking up neighborhood
nodes, minimizing energy overhead, and partner selection are
addressed. Simulation results show that CPS-MAC signiﬁcantly
decreases packet error rate without expending additional energy.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are used in a wide range
of applications, such as target tracking, habitat sensing and ﬁre
detection. WSN are particularly useful in situation where an
infrastructure network is not present or not feasible. In such
conditions, sensor nodes can be deployed around a sink to
create a multi-hop data gathering network as shown in Figure
1. The nodes coordinate locally to forward each other packets.
The packets travels in a hop-by-hop fashion towards the sink.
As sensor nodes are battery powered, they operate under
strict energy constraints. Common WSN protocols such as
S-Mac, T-MAC and CSMA-MPS trade off performance for
energy efﬁciency [18], [22]. The nodes use low transmission
powers and switch the transceiver between sleep and awake
states. Fading and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel
results in channel errors, collisions, and overhearing due to
which these networks drop a signiﬁcant proportion of packets.

Signal fading can be the most severe among these impair-
ments. In a wireless channel, random scattering from reﬂectors
with different attenuation coefﬁcients results in multiple copies
of a transmitted signal arriving (and interfering) at a receiver
with different gains, phase shifts, and delays. These multiple
signal replicas can add together in a constructive or destructive
way, amplifying or attenuating the received signals amplitude.
Destructive interference results in fading, which causes tempo-
rary failure of communication, as the amplitude of the received
signal may be low to the extent that the receiver may not be
able to distinguish it from thermal noise.
Under such conditions, ensuring reliable communication
while conserving energy is a challenging problem. This
has motivated us to design Cooperative Preamble Sampling
Medium Access Control (CPS-MAC) protocol which can
improve reliability without expending additional energy. Our
protocol takes advantage of overhearing. Overhearing means
that a node will receive all messages in its reception range
including those that are intended for other nodes. Considered
problematic, specially in dense WSN, these packets are usually
discarded and this wastes energy.
We suggest using cooperative communication (CC) [3]
to take advantage of these overhead packets. In CC, nodes
cooperate to improve the overall performance of the network.

Since a transmission in the wireless channel is overheard by
neighboring nodes, these nodes can process the overheard
packets and re-transmit them [4]. Figure 2 elaborates a 3-node
CC scenario. We refer to this as a cooperative triangle, which
consists of a source, partner, and destination node. Destination
node here refers to the next-hop node in the cooperative
triangle and is used in the same context throughout this paper.
We exemplify a possible realization of a cooperative com-
munication scheme as follows (for alternatives, see [8], [12]–
[14]). The source broadcasts a message to the destination in a
ﬁrst phase. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel,
the partner station can overhear the source transmission, de-
code it, and if received correctly, forwards it to the destination
in a second phase. We refer to this two phase scheme as one
transmission cycle. By combining different copies of the same
transmission by source and partner stations, the destination can
improve its ability to decode the original packet and exploit
spatial diversity and robustness against channel variations due
to fading.

We propose to realize this concept at the Medium Access
Control (MAC) layer, which is responsible for radio usage
and scheduling transmission efﬁciently. Although CC has
already been investigated at the MAC layer for traditional
wireless networks such as wireless LANs (WLAN) based
on the IEEE802.11 standard [8], [9], [13]–[15], integrating
CC into MAC layer for WSN has received little attention.
It is important to mention here that MAC protocols for WSN
differ signiﬁcantly from MAC protocols for WLAN. In WLAN
optimization of performance parameters such as throughput,
latency, and fairness is a primary concern. In WSN energy
conservation and extending lifetime is essential. Details can
be found in Section II.
We brieﬂy outline the challenges faced in developing CC
based MAC protocols for WSN, along with solutions proposed
in CPS-MAC.
1) MAC protocols such as X-MAC try to conserve energy
by maximizing the sleep duration of the nodes [17].
CC on the other hand increases energy expenditure by
requiring nodes to be awake more often. In such a
situation, improving reliability and conserving energy
may seem counter intuitive. CPS-MAC compensates for
the additional energy expenditure by reducing the time
needed to wake up neighboring nodes and by achieving
lower packet error rates.
2) Application of CC in densely deployed WSN can result
in multiple nodes overhearing and forwarding a packet
and ﬂooding part of the network. In such situations, it
could be practical to limit the number of nodes taking
part in CC and avoid redundant transmission and energy
wastage. For this CPS-MAC includes an addressing
scheme which allows source node to select partner and
destination prior to transmission. For this, CPS-MAC
includes an addressing scheme which attempts to limit
one transmission cycle to three nodes and minimizing
the number of nodes unnecessarily overhearing the trans-
mission.
3) Under ordinary conditions data would travel in a hop-
by-hop fashion during each transmission. Narayanan et
al. [10] and Zhu et al. [11] have shown that two-hop
forwarding leads to higher total network throughput.
Therefore, CPS-MAC attempts to deliver a packet over
multiple hops in a single transmission cycle as shown in
Figure 3. Notice here that Figure 3 differs from Figure
2. This multi-hop transfer in a single transmission cycle
consumes less energy then several single-hop transfers.
The protocol uses hop count parameter for this purpose
and is explained in section III in detail.
Details of CPS-MAC are presented in Section III.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Medium Access Control in Wireless Sensor Networks
MAC protocols in WSN conserve energy by duty cycling
radio which is the main source of energy consumption. Sev-
eral MAC protocols for WSN have been proposed in recent
years, which optimize duty cycle depending upon underlying
application requirement and trafﬁc behavior [22]. They can be
divided into two main categories namely schedule-based and
contention-based.
The schedule-based approach requires nodes to synchronize
at some common time of reference such that they can wake
up collectively prior to transferring. This approach may seem
attractive at ﬁrst glance because idle-listening and overhearing
simply do not occur. However, the need to synchronize sleep-
ing schedules and the control packet overhead make them less
feasible. Ideally, a MAC protocol in WSN does not impose a
high overhead for exchanging control information. Otherwise,
a signiﬁcant amount of energy will be consumed for it.

Cooperation over multiple hops
Contention-based schemes on the other hand does not
require synchronization of sleep schedules and are more
ﬂexible to handling variable trafﬁc loads [1]. However in
such schemes, nodes who wish to transmit must content for
the channel and the winner transmits at the risk of collision.
Accordingly, these protocols contain mechanism to avoid or
to minimize the probability of collisions.
Preamble sampling is one such protocol which is speciﬁ-
cally designed for WSN [16] and is particularly useful when
the trafﬁc generation is non-periodic. Figure 4 shows the
working of the protocol. Nodes switch between sleep and listen
(awake) states. When a sender has data to send, it wakes up
the receiver by sending a preamble which is longer than the
sleep duration of the receiver node. When a receiver node
wakes up and switches its radio to listen state, it hears the
preamble, uses it to synchronize with the source, and stays
awake for incoming transmission. Then, the source initiates the
transmission at the end of the preamble. After the transmission
is complete, nodes resume duty cycling. As the cost (energy)
of waking up is transfered from receiver to sender, and there
are more receivers than senders, a lot of energy is saved.
To shorten the preamble length and further minimize energy
consumption at both sender and receiver, an improvement
to Preamble Sampling was proposed in [17] and [18]. This
scheme is known as Minimum Preamble Sampling (MPS) and
is shown in Figure 5. Here one long preamble is divided
into a series of short preambles interleaved with listening
intervals. We refer to these listening intervals as inter-preamble
spacing. If a receiving node wakes up and hears the short
preamble, it sends an acknowledgment (ACK) packet to the

B. Medium Access Control Protocols for Cooperative Com-
munication
A signiﬁcant amount of work has been done on developing
CC protocols in wireless networks to combat the effects of
channel fading. The initial work focused on physical layer
schemes [2], [6]. However, in order to realize the full potential
of cooperative communication, it is imperative that the layer
directly above the physical layer, namely the medium access
control (MAC) layer, must be able to schedule transmissions
effectively and efﬁciently. This has led researchers to inves-
tigate the support of cooperative communication in various
forms at higher protocol layers including MAC layer [7]. A
MAC protocol called CoopMAC illustrates how the legacy
IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) [9] can
be modiﬁed to use cooperative communication thus achieving
both higher throughput and lower interference [8]. More
cooperative communication protocols based on IEEE 802.11
were proposed in [12], [13], [14] and [15]. However, protocols
based on IEEE 802.11 are not feasible in WSN as they have
strict energy constraint and limited processing power.
Analyzing the effects of cooperation in legacy MAC pro-
tocols for WSN has received little attention. Mainaud et al.

[19] has recently proposed a cooperative MAC protocol for
WSN based on preamble sampling. The primary focus of the
work is to deﬁne a relay node among the neighboring nodes
and relaying decision at the link. However, the work does not
analyze the effect on energy consumption, a primary concern
in WSN.
Motivated by the previous work, we have designed CPS-
MAC.The difference between CPS-MAC and prior work is that
CPS-MAC addresses a number of design challenges such as
addressing scheme, energy efﬁcient wake up, and a scheduling
scheme which uses CC. These schemes are integrated together
into a low-overhead practical MAC protocol.
III. PROTOCOL DESIGN FOR CPS-MAC
We consider an ad hoc multi-hop data gathering network
where sensor nodes are deployed around a sink as shown in
Figure 6. Each node deﬁnes its distance from the sink using
hop count which is deﬁned as the number of intermediate
hops between the node and the sink [20]. The sensor nodes
periodically sense the data, wake up the neighboring nodes,
and broadcast the data. Neighboring nodes receive the data and
the one which is closer to the sink forward it to the next-hop
nodes. Data eventually reaches the sink which is responsible
for collecting, processing, analyzing, and forwarding the data
to a base station.

Data Gathering Network
Once the sensor nodes are physically deployed around the
sink, CPS-MAC works as follows.
A. Initialization Phase
In order to make routing decision and address nodes, CPS-
MAC uses hop count value and neighborhood information.
Hop count is the minimum number of non-cooperative trans-
missions required to reach the sink from a given node [20].
In order to setup this ﬁeld, we use a ﬂooding algorithm. An
example of such an algorithm is the Cost Field Establishment
Algorithm (CFEA) [21]. It is executed during the startup phase
of the network and whenever the network topology changes.
No CC is used during this phase. Consider the hierarchy shown
in Fig 6. Initially, the sink sets its hop count to 0 and nodes
set their hop count to ∞. The sink initiates the algorithm by
broadcasting an advertisement (ADV) packet. The content of
an ADV packet is shown in Figure 7 which would contain
nodes hop count, its own addresses, and address of its 1-hop
parent nodes. The address of 1-hop parents are needed for
addressing and will be explained in the next section.

Fig. 7.
Advertisement (ADV) Packet
The message propagates down from the parent node to the
siblings. We use the term parent and sibling because nodes
in the network are deployed in a hierarchy. Whenever a node
receives an ADV message, it determines if it leads to a smaller
hop count to the sink. If it does, the node resets its hop
count and stores the source address as its 1-hop parent and
the remaining addresses as 2-hop parent. Then, the node (re-
)transmits its own ADV packet.
The 1-hop and 2-hop parent node addresses are stored
in a routing table called CoopTable. It additionally stores
the addresses of 1-hop sibling nodes. These addresses are
obtained by simply overhearing ADV packets on the media
and analyzing the hop count value. This is feasible because
nodes do not sleep during the initialization phase and can
receive all ADV packets in their reception range. Eventually,
every node may calculate the optimal hop count to the sink
through ﬂooding. Then, the initialization phase stops and
nodes start their normal operation; for example, the node D in
the hierarchy above would have a CoopTable as follows:

NODE D: COOPTABLE PARENT NODES

(Hop Count-1)
(Hop Count-2)

The following section explains how the CoopTable is used
to address nodes and select partner nodes for cooperation.
B. Addressing Scheme
A broadcast transmission from a node to the sink over
multiple hops can result in multiple nodes forwarding the same
packet along different paths and ﬂooding the network. Though
it increases the chances of a packet eventually reaching the
sink, nodes have to pay the price of energy expenditure and
processing overhead. The problem becomes more complicated

Addressing Scheme
when we use cooperative communication because it involves
a partner node in addition to the source-destination pair. In
order to minimize this overhead and limit the cooperative
communication to 3 nodes (source-partner-destination) in each
transmission cycle, we use the CoopTable mentioned in Sec-
tion III-A. When a node has data to send, it will select both
partner (1-hop parent) and destination (2-hop parent) addresses
from the CoopTable. However, instead of adding them as two
separate addresses, the node will perform an XOR between
them and send it as a single address. Recall from the previous
section that every node stores addressing information about its
1-hop and subsequent 2-hop parents and 1-hop siblings in the
CoopTable. If multiple partner\destination pairs are possible,
the source cycles between them to divide the overhead. Nodes
also include their hop count value in the packet. Once the
packet is sent, every node that receives it extracts the address,
performs an XOR with its own address, and looks up the result
in its CoopTable. Nodes also calculate the hop count difference
with the source node and then use the following rules to
determine its role (partner /destination) in transmission.
1) If the result matches the address of a sibling node and
the hop count difference with the source node is 2, the
node acts as destination.
2) If the result matches the address of a parent node and
the hop count difference is 1 with the source node, the
node acts as partner.
3) If either the result does not matches an entry in the
lookup table or if the hop count difference is greater
than 2, the node takes no action.
For example, in Fig 8, the node with Identiﬁer (ID) 100
sends a packet to node 101 and 110. The XOR of their address
is 011, which is included in the data packet. Assuming that all
nodes in the neighborhood correctly receive the packet, they
decode the address using XOR with their own address. The
lookup in the CoopTable for the node 110 and 101 matches the
above mentioned rules and they deﬁne their roles as destination
and partner respectively. The node 111 and 010 are not able
to ﬁnd the resulting address in the CoopTable and therefore
do not take part in Cooperation. In this scheme, there is a
probability that the result from the XOR operation might result
in collision, i.e., the resulting address can map to a value
in the CoopTable even though the node was not addressed,
especially when the number of bits used for node identiﬁers
is small. However, the probability signiﬁcantly reduces when
the identiﬁer is large (e.g. 48, bit MAC address).

C. Medium Access Control Layer
We propose a MAC protocol that uses cooperative com-
munication to increase the probability of correct transmis-
sion while reducing energy consumption. Usually a broadcast
transmission can be received by nodes which are multiple
hops away from the source but they are discarded as they
suffer from bit errors due to fading and attenuation. Our
motivation is to utilize even these corrupt packets. The idea
is to form cooperative triangles in the network where each
triangle consists of source, partner, and destination as shown
in Figure 3. Nodes cooperate in this triangle to deliver multiple
copies of the packet to the destination where packet combining
[4] is used to recover the original packet. However, for
such a scheme to work, it becomes challenging to wake up
nodes which are multiple hops away before initiating a data
transmission. To solve this, we propose a wake up scheme
which is based on minimum preamble sampling explained in
Section II-A [16].
Figure 9 elaborates the working of the protocol. When a
source node has data to send, it transmits a strobed preamble
packet containing synchronization bits and the node’s hop
count value at the end. The strobed preamble is repeated until
the source receives an acknowledgment (ACK) preamble from
a neighboring node. When a neighboring node wakes up and
receives the preamble, it analyzes the hop count value. If
the receiver is not a parent node, it discards the preamble
and immediately returns to sleep state as it cannot help the
source to forward its data to the sink. 1-hop parent nodes that
receive the preamble contend for the media and the successful
node sends an ACK preamble. As no addressing is used in
preamble, any 1-hop parent node can send the ACK preamble.
This ACK preamble serves two purposes. First, it will act as
wakeup preamble sequence for the next-hop parent. Second,
the source will know that nodes in 1-hop neighborhood are
awake. After receiving the acknowledgment preamble, the
source sends the address packet. Nodes analyze the address
packet as explained in Section III-B. If a node cannot deﬁne
its role, it will return to sleep state to conserve energy. After
this, the source broadcasts the data packet. The transmission
is heard by both partner and destination yet it is unlikely to
be received correctly by both nodes at once. After receiving
the packet, the partner uses decode and forward (DAF) [4] to
decide if it should again broadcast the packet. In DAF, the
partner decodes a received packet to check for bit errors and
erroneous packets are discarded. Only if the packet is received
correctly, the partner again broadcasts the received packet to
the destination. Thus, the destination receives two copies of
the same data packet. The two packets are combined using
maximum ratio combining (MRC) [4] to recover the original
data. In its simplest form, MRC is modeled by adding the
instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the two packet
received from source and partner. This accumulation of the
instantaneous SNR increases the rate at which the destination
can reliably decode the packet. After the transmission, nodes
may return to sleep or listen state. The recipient of the data
packet will schedule a transmission for further propagation of
the data packet towards the sink.
IV. RESULTS
In this section, we present simulation results for CPS-MAC.
Simulations are conducted using Mobility Framework for the
OMNET++ discrete event simulator [23]. Our purpose is to
show how the protocol behaves and reacts to typical WSN
conditions such as fading channels, extended periods of low
data ﬂow, and their effect on power consumption. This gives
us a good understanding of how deployment on real sensor
nodes would perform.
The performance of CPS-MAC is compared with MPS-
based MAC protocol mentioned below. This means that the
nodes use MPS for waking up neighboring nodes prior to data
transmission. For comparison purpose, we have implemented
the following network conﬁguration.
1) Direct-MPS: This scenario consists of two nodes, source
and destination. The source transmits directly to the
destination and uses MPS to wake up the destination
node.

2) Relaying-MPS: In this scenario, an intermediate node is
introduced between source and destination. The source
ﬁrst wakes up the relay using MPS and transmits the
packet. The relay node then wakes up destination and
forwards the packet, if correctly received from the
source. If a node receives correct packets from both
the source and relay, it discards the duplicate packet.
This is done by keeping a sequence number of correctly
received packets in a table.
3) CPS-MAC: This scenario uses our proposed protocol
for a 3 node scenario as shown in Figure 3. We use
cooperation to exploit both the source-destination and
source-partner-destination channels.
4) CPS-MAC without cooperation: This scenario is similar
to the previous one (CPS-MAC) however, cooperation
for data packets is disabled. This gives us an idea of how
many packets are lost in the absence of cooperation.

evaluated CPS-MAC performance both with and without CC.
This performance improvement over MPS based protocol is
attributed to the CPS-MAC wake up scheme. Repeating the
preamble from the partner node increases the chances of the
destination node waking up prior to data transmission. This
process is similar to CC but here, preamble packet is repeated
at the partner station instead of data packet. Thus, the destina-
tion would receive multiple copies of the preamble packet, in-
creasing its chances of overhearing the preamble. CPS-MAC-
without-cooperation shows the performance of CPS-MAC in
the absence of cooperation. The difference in PER between
CPS-MAC and CPS-MAC-without-cooperation represents the
diversity gain achieved by CC and MRC for data packets.
The total energy consumed by the whole network for the
entire simulation duration is shows in Figure 11. The energy
consumption of CPS-MAC is comparable to direct-MPS and
signiﬁcantly less then relaying-MPS. This is because CPS-

hop partner node. As the amount of time for waking up the
node is signiﬁcantly larger than the data transmission phase,
size and number of preambles is a primary factor contributing
to the energy expenditure. By reducing both the number of
preambles sent and the time needed to wake up the nodes,
CPS-MAC is able to reduce the energy utilization, making it
comparable to direct-MPS.
Figure 12 shows the energy consumed per useful bit (EPUB)
for the three conﬁgurations. The EPUB metric takes into
account the energy consumption of all the nodes in the
topology. For high transmission power, EPUB for CPS-MAC
and direct-MPS is almost the same. However, at low trans-
mission power, the improved PER pays off and CPS-MAC
achieves signiﬁcantly lower EPUB. Figure 13 shows the trade-
off between total energy consumption and PER. For a given
PER value, CPS-MAC consumes less energy then both Direct-
MPS and Relaying-MPS. One thing to notice here is that the
Direct-MPS is more energy efﬁcient at very low transmission
power, however, the high PER value makes it infeasible for
applications where better reliability is desired.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work has shown the possible beneﬁts of using coop-
erative communication to increase the reliability and reduce
energy consumption in WSN. We propose CPS-MAC, which
improves reliability by using overhearing to its advantage. The
improvement is realized by forming cooperative triangle in
densely deployed WSN, where channel errors, collisions, idle
listening, and overhearing signiﬁcantly effect the performance.
In duty cycling MAC protocols for WSN, the wakeup scheme
has a big effect on the packet error rate at the destination.
Repeating the preamble in a cooperative manner signiﬁcantly
increases the probability of destination waking up prior to data
transmission. Results show that destination is better able to
receive and decode packets under this scheme as compared to
conventional MPS protocols.
By using CC for data packets, CPS-MAC delivers multiple
copies of packet to the destination. Packet combining using
MRC further helps CPS-MAC in combining and decoding
erroneous packets and reducing the PER. By reducing the
number of preambles and time needed to wake up the nodes
and transferring data over multiple hops, the network can
achieve signiﬁcant reduction in energy expenditure. This be-
havior is important in preamble sampling MAC protocols
as energy used in sending and receiving preambles is the
dominant factor in such protocols. Simulation results show
that energy expenditure of CPS-MAC is comparable to direct-
MPS protocol and outperforms relaying-MPS.
We are currently planning the performance evaluation of
CPS-MAC in a larger WSN conﬁguration. For such a network,
in addition to energy utilization, additional paramters such
as end-to-end latency and network throughput would also be
evaluated.
