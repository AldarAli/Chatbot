Abstract—One of the fundamental challenges in Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs) is the coverage preservation and the exten-
sion of the network lifetime continuously and effectively when
monitoring a certain area (or region) of interest. In this paper,
a coverage optimization protocol to improve the lifetime in
heterogeneous energy wireless sensor networks is proposed. The
area of interest is ﬁrst divided into subregions using a divide-and-
conquer method and then the scheduling of sensor node activity
is planned for each subregion. The proposed scheduling considers
rounds during which a small number of nodes, remaining active
for sensing, is selected to ensure coverage. Each round consists
in four phases: (i) Information Exchange, (ii) Leader Election,
(iii) Decision, and (iv) Sensing. The decision process is carried
out by a leader node, which solves an integer program. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach can prolong the network
lifetime and improve the coverage performance.

INTRODUCTION
Recent years have witnessed signiﬁcant advances in wire-
less communications and embedded micro-sensing Micro-
Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technologies which
have led to the emergence of Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) as one of the most promising technologies [1]. In
fact, they present huge potential in several domains ranging
from health care applications to military applications. A sensor
network is composed of a large number of tiny sensing devices
deployed in a region of interest. Each device has processing
and wireless communication capabilities, which enable it to
sense its environment, to compute, to store information and
to deliver report messages to a base station [2]. One of the
main design issues in WSNs is to prolong the network lifetime,
while achieving acceptable quality of service for applications.
Indeed, sensors nodes have limited resources in terms of
memory, energy and computational power.
Since sensor nodes have limited battery life; since it is
impossible to replace batteries, especially in remote and hostile
environments, it is desirable that a WSN should be deployed
with high density because spatial redundancy can then be
exploited to increase the lifetime of the network. In such a
high density network, if all sensor nodes were to be activated
at the same time, the lifetime would be reduced. To extend
the lifetime of the network, the main idea is to take advantage
of the overlapping sensing regions of some sensor nodes to
save energy by turning off some of them during the sensing
phase [3]. Obviously, the deactivation of nodes is only relevant
if the coverage of the monitored area is not affected. In this
paper, we concentrate on the area coverage problem [4], with
the objective of maximizing the network lifetime by using
an adaptive scheduling. The area of interest is divided into
subregions and an activity scheduling for sensor nodes is
planned for each subregion. In fact, the nodes in a subregion
can be seen as a cluster where each node sends sensing data to
the cluster head or the sink node. Furthermore, the activities
in a subregion/cluster can continue even if another cluster
stops due to too many node failures. Our scheduling scheme
considers rounds, where a round starts with a discovery phase
to exchange information between sensors of the subregion, in
order to choose in a suitable manner a sensor node to carry
out a coverage strategy. This coverage strategy involves the
solving of an integer program, which provides the activation
of the sensors for the sensing phase of the current round.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The
next section reviews the related work in the ﬁeld. Section III is
devoted to the scheduling strategy for energy-efﬁcient cover-
age. Section IV gives the coverage model formulation, which is
used to schedule the activation of sensors. Section V shows the
simulation results obtained using the discrete event simulator
OMNeT++ [5]. They fully demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed approach. Finally, we give concluding remarks and
some suggestions for future works in Section VI.

RELATED WORKS
In this section, we only review some recent works dealing
with the coverage lifetime maximization problem, where the
objective is to optimally schedule sensors’ activities in order
to extend WSNs lifetime. Vu [6] proposed a novel distributed
heuristic, called Distributed Energy-efﬁcient Scheduling for k-
coverage (DESK), which ensures that the energy consumption
among the sensors is balanced and the lifetime maximized
while the coverage requirement is maintained. This heuristic
works in rounds, requires only 1-hop neighbor information,
and each sensor decides its status (active or sleep) based on
the perimeter coverage model proposed by Huang and Tseng
[7]. More recently, Shibo et al. [8] expressed the coverage
problem as a minimum weight submodular set cover prob-
lem and proposed a Distributed Truncated Greedy Algorithm
(DTGA) to solve it. They take, in particular, advantage from

both temporal and spatial correlations between data sensed by
different sensors.
The works presented in [9], [10], [11] focus on the
deﬁnition of coverage-aware, distributed energy-efﬁcient and
distributed clustering methods respectively. They aim to extend
the network lifetime while ensuring the coverage. S. Misra
et al. [3] proposed a localized algorithm which conserves
energy and coverage by activating the subset of sensors with
the minimum overlapping area. It preserves the network con-
nectivity thanks to the formation of the network backbone.
J. A. Torkestani [12] designed a Learning Automata-based
Energy-Efﬁcient Coverage protocol (LAEEC) to construct a
Degree-constrained Connected Dominating Set (DCDS) in
WSNs. He showed that the correct choice of the degree-
constraint of DCDS balances the network load on the active
nodes and leads to enhance the coverage and network lifetime.
The main contribution of our approach addresses three
main questions to build a scheduling strategy.
How must the phases for information exchange, decision
and sensing be planned over time? Our algorithm divides
the timeline into rounds. Each round contains 4 phases: Infor-
mation Exchange, Leader Election, Decision, and Sensing.
What are the rules to decide which node has to be
turned on or off? Our algorithm tends to limit the overcover-
age of points of interest to avoid turning on too many sensors
covering the same areas at the same time, and tries to prevent
undercoverage. The decision is a good compromise between
these two conﬂicting objectives.
Which node should make such a decision? A leader
node should make such a decision. Our work does not consider
only one leader to compute and to broadcast the scheduling
decision to all the sensors. When the network size increases,
the network is divided into many subregions and the decision
is made by a leader in each subregion.
III.
ACTIVITY SCHEDULING
We consider a randomly and uniformly deployed network
consisting of static wireless sensors. The wireless sensors are
deployed in high density to ensure initially a full coverage
of the interested area. We assume that all nodes are homoge-
neous in terms of communication and processing capabilities
and heterogeneous in term of energy provision. The location
information is available to the sensor node either through
hardware such as embedded GPS or through location discovery
algorithms. The area of interest can be divided using the
divide-and-conquer strategy into smaller areas called subre-
gions and then our coverage protocol will be implemented in
each subregion simultaneously. Our protocol works in rounds
fashion, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1.
Multi-Round Coverage Protocol.
Each round is divided into 4 phases: Information (INFO)
Exchange, Leader Election, Decision, and Sensing. For each
round, there is exactly one set cover responsible for the sensing
task. This protocol is more reliable against an unexpected
node failure because it works in rounds. On the one hand,
if a node failure is detected before making the decision, the
node will not participate to this phase, and, on the other
hand, if the node failure occurs after the decision, the sensing
task of the network will be temporarily affected: only during
the period of sensing until a new round starts, since a new
set cover will take charge of the sensing task in the next
round. The energy consumption and some other constraints
can easily be taken into account since the sensors can update
and then exchange their information (including their residual
energy) at the beginning of each round. However, the pre-
sensing phases (INFO Exchange, Leader Election, Decision)
are energy consuming for some nodes, even when they do not
join the network to monitor the area. Below, we describe each
phase in more details.
A. Information exchange phase
Each sensor node j sends its position, remaining energy
REj, and the number of local neighbours NBRj to all
wireless sensor nodes in its subregion by using an INFO packet
and then listens to the packets sent from other nodes. After that,
each node will have information about all the sensor nodes in
the subregion. In our model, the remaining energy corresponds
to the time that a sensor can live in the active mode.
B. Leader election phase
This step includes choosing the Wireless Sensor Node
Leader (WSNL), which will be responsible for executing the
coverage algorithm. Each subregion in the area of interest will
select its own WSNL independently for each round. All the
sensor nodes cooperate to select WSNL. The nodes in the
same subregion will select the leader based on the received
information from all other nodes in the same subregion. The
selection criteria in order of priority are: larger number of
neighbours, larger remaining energy, and then in case of
equality, larger index.
C. Decision phase
The WSNL will solve an integer program (see section IV)
to select which sensors will be activated in the following
sensing phase to cover the subregion. WSNL will send Active-
Sleep packet to each sensor in the subregion based on the
algorithm’s results.
D. Sensing phase
Active sensors in the round will execute their sensing task
to preserve maximal coverage in the region of interest. We
will assume that the cost of keeping a node awake (or asleep)
for sensing task is the same for all wireless sensor nodes in
the network. Each sensor will receive an Active-Sleep packet
from WSNL informing it to stay awake or to go to sleep for a
time equal to the period of sensing until starting a new round.
We consider a boolean disk coverage model which is the
most widely used sensor coverage model in the literature. Each
sensor has a constant sensing range Rs. All space points within
a disk centered at the sensor with the radius of the sensing

range is said to be covered by this sensor. We also assume
that the communication range Rc ≥ 2Rs [13].
Instead of working with the coverage area, we consider
for each sensor a set of points called primary points. We also
assume that the sensing disk deﬁned by a sensor is covered if
all the primary points of this sensor are covered. By knowing
the position (point center: (px, py)) of a wireless sensor node
and its Rs, we calculate the primary points directly based on
the proposed model. We use these primary points (that can be
increased or decreased if necessary) as references to ensure
that the monitored region of interest is covered by the selected
set of sensors, instead of using all the points in the area.
We can calculate the positions of the selected primary
points in the circle disk of the sensing range of a wireless
sensor node (see ﬁgure 2) as follows:
(px, py) = point center of wireless sensor node
X1 = (px, py)
X2 = (px + Rs ∗ (1), py + Rs ∗ (0))
X3 = (px + Rs ∗ (−1), py + Rs ∗ (0))
X4 = (px + Rs ∗ (0), py + Rs ∗ (1))
X5 = (px + Rs ∗ (0), py + Rs ∗ (−1))
X6 = (px + Rs ∗ ( −

X7 = (px + Rs ∗ (

X9 = (px + Rs ∗ (

X12 = (px + Rs ∗ (0), py + Rs ∗ (

X13 = (px + Rs ∗ (0), py + Rs ∗ ( −

COVERAGE PROBLEM FORMULATION
Our model is based on the model proposed by Pedraza et
al. [14], where the objective is to ﬁnd a maximum number of
disjoint cover sets. To accomplish this goal, authors proposed
an integer program, which forces undercoverage and overcov-
erage of targets to become minimal at the same time. They use
binary variables xjl to indicate if sensor j belongs to cover
set l. In our model, we consider binary variables Xj, which
determine the activation of sensor j in the sensing phase of
the round. We also consider primary points as targets. The set
of primary points is denoted by P and the set of sensors by
J.
For a primary point p, let αjp denote the indicator function of
whether the point p is covered, that is:
αjp =
( 1
if the primary point p is covered
by sensor node j,
0
otherwise.

The number of active sensors that cover the primary point p
is equal to P
j∈J αjp ∗ Xj where:
Xj =

1
if sensor j is active,
0
otherwise.

We deﬁne the Overcoverage variable Θp as:
Θp =

if the primary point
p is not covered,
P

More precisely, Θp represents the number of active sensor
nodes minus one that cover the primary point p.
The Undercoverage variable Up of the primary point p is
deﬁned by:
Up =

if the primary point p is not covered,
0
otherwise.

Our coverage optimization problem can then be formulated

•
Θp : overcoverage, the number of sensors minus one
that are covering the primary point p;
•
Up : undercoverage, indicates whether or not the
primary point p is being covered (1 if not covered
and 0 if covered).
The ﬁrst group of constraints indicates that some primary
point p should be covered by at least one sensor and, if
it is not always the case, overcoverage and undercoverage
variables help balancing the restriction equations by taking
positive values. There are two main objectives. Firstly, we
limit the overcoverage of primary points in order to activate a
minimum number of sensors. Secondly, we prevent the absence
of monitoring on some parts of the subregion by minimizing
the undercoverage. The weights wθ and wU must be properly
chosen so as to guarantee that the maximum number of points
are covered during each round.

SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we conducted a series of simulations to
evaluate the efﬁciency and the relevance of our approach, using
the discrete event simulator OMNeT++ [5]. We performed
simulations for ﬁve different densities varying from 50 to
250 nodes. Experimental results were obtained from randomly
generated networks in which nodes are deployed over a
(50 × 25) m2 sensing ﬁeld. More precisely, the deployment
is controlled at a coarse scale in order to ensure that the
deployed nodes can fully cover the sensing ﬁeld with the given
sensing range. 10 simulation runs are performed with different
network topologies for each node density. The results presented
hereafter are the average of these 10 runs. A simulation ends
when all the nodes are dead or the sensor network becomes
disconnected (some nodes may not be able to send, to a base
station, an event they sense).
Our proposed coverage protocol uses the radio energy
dissipation model deﬁned by Heinzelman et al. [15] as en-
ergy consumption model for each wireless sensor node when
transmitting or receiving packets. The energy of each node
in a network is initialized randomly within the range 24-
60 joules, and each sensor node will consume 0.2 watts during
the sensing period, which will last 60 seconds. Thus, an active
node will consume 12 joules during the sensing phase, while
a sleeping node will use 0.002 joules. Each sensor node will
not participate in the next round if its remaining energy is less
than 12 joules. In all experiments, the parameters are set as
follows: Rs = 5 m, wΘ = 1, and wU = |P 2|.
We evaluate the efﬁciency of our approach by using some
performance metrics such as: coverage ratio, number of active
nodes ratio, energy saving ratio, energy consumption, network
lifetime, execution time, and number of stopped simulation
runs. Our approach called strategy 2 (with two leaders) works
with two subregions, each one having a size of (25 × 25) m2.
Our strategy will be compared with two other approaches.
The ﬁrst one, called strategy 1 (with one leader), works as
strategy 2, but considers only one region of (50×25) m2 with
only one leader. The other approach, called Simple Heuristic,
consists in uniformly dividing the region into squares of
(5×5) m2. During the decision phase, in each square, a sensor
is randomly chosen, it will remain turned on for the coming
sensing phase.
A. The impact of the number of rounds on the coverage ratio
In this experiment, the coverage ratio measures how much
the area of a sensor ﬁeld is covered. In our case, the coverage
ratio is regarded as the number of primary points covered
among the set of all primary points within the ﬁeld. Figure 3
shows the impact of the number of rounds on the average
coverage ratio for 150 deployed nodes for the three approaches.
It can be seen that the three approaches give similar coverage
ratios during the ﬁrst rounds. From the 9th round the coverage
ratio decreases continuously with the simple heuristic, while
the two other strategies provide superior coverage to 90%
for ﬁve more rounds. Coverage ratio decreases when the
number of rounds increases due to dead nodes. Although some
nodes are dead, thanks to strategy 1 or 2, other nodes are
preserved to ensure the coverage. Moreover, when we have a
dense sensor network, it leads to maintain the full coverage
for a larger number of rounds. Strategy 2 is slightly more
efﬁcient than strategy 1, because strategy 2 subdivides the
region into 2 subregions and if one of the two subregions
becomes disconnected, the coverage may be still ensured in
the remaining subregion.

B. The impact of the number of rounds on the active sensors
ratio
It is important to have as few active nodes as possible in
each round, in order to minimize the communication overhead
and maximize the network lifetime. This point is assessed
through the Active Sensors Ratio (ASR), which is deﬁned as
follows:
ASR(%) =
Number of active sensors during the current sensing phase
Total number of sensors in the network for the region
× 100.

The results presented in ﬁgure 4 show the superiority
of both proposed strategies, the strategy with two leaders
and the one with a single leader, in comparison with the
simple heuristic. The strategy with one leader uses less active
nodes than the strategy with two leaders until the last rounds,
because it uses central control on the whole sensing ﬁeld. The
advantage of the strategy 2 approach is that even if a network is
disconnected in one subregion, the other one usually continues
the optimization process, and this extends the lifetime of the
network.

C. Impact of the number of rounds on the energy saving ratio
In this experiment, we consider a performance metric
linked to energy. This metric, called Energy Saving Ratio
(ESR), is deﬁned by:
ESR(%) =
Number of alive sensors during this round
Total number of sensors in the network for the region × 100.
The longer the ratio is, the more redundant sensor nodes are
switched off, and consequently the longer the network may
live. Figure 5 shows the average Energy Saving Ratio versus
rounds for all three approaches and for 150 deployed nodes.

The simulation results show that our strategies allow to
efﬁciently save energy by turning off some sensors during the
sensing phase. As expected, the strategy with one leader is
usually slightly better than the second strategy, because the
global optimization permits to turn off more sensors. Indeed,
when there are two subregions more nodes remain awake near
the border shared by them. Note that again as the number of
rounds increases the two leaders’ strategy becomes the most
performing one, since it takes longer to have the two subregion
networks simultaneously disconnected.
D. The percentage of stopped simulation runs
We will now study the percentage of simulations, which
stopped due to network disconnections per round for each
of the three approaches. Figure 6 illustrates the percent-
age of stopped simulation runs per round for 150 deployed
nodes. It can be observed that the simple heuristic is the
approach, which stops ﬁrst because the nodes are randomly
chosen. Among the two proposed strategies, the centralized
one ﬁrst exhibits network disconnections. Thus, as previously
explained, in case of the strategy with several subregions the
optimization effectively continues as long as a network in
a subregion is still connected. This longer partial coverage
optimization participates in extending the network lifetime.
E. The energy consumption
In this experiment, we study the effect of the multi-hop
communication protocol on the performance of the strategy
with two leaders and compare it with the other two approaches.
The average energy consumption resulting from wireless com-
munications is calculated by taking into account the energy
spent by all the nodes when transmitting and receiving packets
during the network lifetime. This average value, which is
obtained for 10 simulation runs, is then divided by the average

between networks having different densities.
Figure 7 illustrates the energy consumption for the different
network sizes and the three approaches. The results show that
the strategy with two leaders is the most competitive from the
energy consumption point of view. A centralized method, like
the strategy with one leader, has a high energy consumption
due to many communications. In fact, a distributed method
greatly reduces the number of communications thanks to
the partitioning of the initial network in several independent
subnetworks. Let us notice that even if a centralized method
consumes far more energy than the simple heuristic, since the
energy cost of communications during a round is a small part
of the energy spent in the sensing phase, the communications
have a small impact on the network lifetime.

F. The impact of the number of sensors on execution time
A sensor node has limited energy resources and computing
power, therefore it is important that the proposed algorithm has
the shortest possible execution time. The energy of a sensor
node must be mainly used for the sensing phase, not for the
pre-sensing ones. Table I gives the average execution times
in seconds on a laptop of the decision phase (solving of the
optimization problem) during one round. They are given for
the different approaches and various numbers of sensors. The
lack of any optimization explains why the heuristic has very
low execution times. Conversely, the strategy with one leader,
which requires to solve an optimization problem considering
all the nodes presents redhibitory execution times. Moreover,
53

increasing the network size by 50 nodes multiplies the time
by almost a factor of 10. The strategy with two leaders has
more suitable times. We think that in distributed fashion the
solving of the optimization problem in a subregion can be
tackled by sensor nodes. Overall, to be able to deal with very
large networks, a distributed method is clearly required.

G. The network lifetime
Finally, we have deﬁned the network lifetime as the time
until all nodes have been drained of their energy or each
sensor network monitoring an area has become disconnected.
In Figure 8, the network lifetime for different network sizes
and for both strategy with two leaders and the simple heuristic
is illustrated. We do not consider anymore the centralized
strategy with one leader, because, as shown above, this strategy
results in execution times that quickly become unsuitable for
a sensor network.

The network lifetime.
As highlighted by Figure 8, the network lifetime obviously
increases when the size of the network increases, with our
approach that leads to the larger lifetime improvement. By
choosing the best suited nodes, for each round, to cover the
region of interest and by letting the other ones sleep in order to
be used later in next rounds, our strategy efﬁciently prolonges
the network lifetime. Comparison shows that the larger the
sensor number is, the more our strategies outperform the
simple heuristic. Strategy 2, which uses two leaders, is the
best one because it is robust to network disconnection in one
subregion. It also means that distributing the algorithm in each
node and subdividing the sensing ﬁeld into many subregions,
which are managed independently and simultaneously, is the
most relevant way to maximize the lifetime of a network.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have addressed the problem of the
coverage and the lifetime optimization in WSNs. To cope with
this problem, the ﬁeld of sensing is divided into smaller sub-
regions using the concept of divide-and-conquer method, and
then a multi-rounds coverage protocol will optimize coverage
and lifetime performances in each subregion. The proposed
protocol combines two efﬁcient techniques: network leader
election and sensor activity scheduling, where the challenges
include how to select the most efﬁcient leader in each sub-
region and the best representative active nodes. Results from
simulations show the relevance of the proposed protocol in
terms of lifetime, coverage ratio, active sensors ratio, energy
saving, energy consumption, execution time, and the number of
stopped simulation runs due to network disconnection. Indeed,
when dealing with large and dense wireless sensor networks,
a distributed approach like the one we propose allows to
reduce the difﬁculty of a single global optimization problem
by partitioning it in many smaller problems, one per subregion,
that can be solved more easily.
In future work, we plan to study a coverage protocol which
computes all active sensor schedules in only one step for
many rounds, using optimization methods such as swarms
optimization or evolutionary algorithms.
