Abstract—Service evaluation depends on various factors, such 
as assurance, responsiveness, and tangibles. Given that 
emotional satisfaction affects service satisfaction, analyzing 
both the evaluation and emotions is important in improving 
service. Previous studies have identified the evaluation factor 
and determined the degree of influence on the resulting 
evaluation. However, there is little effective analysis that reflects 
the influence of such a factor on emotion. In this study, we use 
hierarchal Latent Dirichlet Allocation and structural equation 
modeling (SEM) to express the causality relationships of service 
evaluation visually and quantitatively. Emotion obtained 
quantitatively by using sentiment analysis is newly applied to 
SEM to obtain knowledge reflecting the influence of emotion. As 
a result of the experiment, we can identify the causality of 
service and determine the influence of the evaluation factor and 
emotion quantitatively.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, the service industry has grown rapidly 
such that in developed countries, there are so many markets 
that account for 60% to 70% of a country's gross domestic 
product (GDP). In the United States where GDP is the highest, 
the service industry's GDP is $ 15.52 trillion, accounting for 
80% of the total GDP [1]. In addition, with the spread of 
smartphones, apps for various services (e.g., Twitter, 
navigation), the introduction of recommended hotels, and the 
rise of electronic services (e.g., Internet shopping) are rapidly 
increasing. With this background, the importance of services 
has grown in recent years. Service improvement is important 
as services are produced and consumed at the same time 
compared with products that are released and finished. Thus, 
analyzing the evaluation of the service in order to improve 
such service is important. 
Service evaluation depends on various factors, such as 
assurance, responsiveness, and tangibles. For example, 
SERVQUAL evaluates the quality of service [2] with five-
dimensional indicators, and Airport Service Quality (ASQ) 
[3] defines airport evaluation factors. As there are many 
factors in the evaluation of services, it is necessary to find out 
the evaluation factors to analyze the evaluation. 
Generally, analyzing services is difficult because these 
have special features like Intangible, Heterogeneous, 
Inseparable, and Perishable (IHIP). However, there are 
several clues to analyze the services from the data (e.g., 
questionnaire). Especially, user review is useful because the 
review describes user experience of and perceived from the 
services. Therefore, it is possible to analyze the quality of 
service and the evaluation of service. Meanwhile, emotional 
satisfaction is also regarded as an important and attractive 
factor in service satisfaction. That is, customers experience 
different positive and negative emotions related to service, 
and these emotions influence service satisfaction [4]. Of 
course, these factors influence service evaluation and the 
emotions related to the service are implied in the user review; 
however, there is no study to identify and analyze evaluation 
factors together with emotional information. 
This paper describes the method by which to perform 
causality analysis from text data, such as user review. In order 
to treat causal analysis, we use the topic-based approaches by 
applying a topic model to the review. In addition, the emotions 
for evaluation factors in the text are quantitatively determined 
using sentiment analysis technology. By applying topic and 
emotion information to structural equation modeling (SEM), 
we analyze the influence of each factor quantitatively. 
The first contribution of this paper is that it obtains the 
knowledge reflecting emotional information from the user 
review by using sentiment analysis. Second, it understands 
the influence on the emotion of the evaluation factor based 
on the idea that emotions are essential for service evaluation 
factor analysis. By using SEM with path diagram, we can also 
analyze and understand the causality relationships among 
topics and their emotions associated with topics that are 
visually and quantitatively express.

explains the core technology of the analysis process, and 
section 4 describes analysis experiments using actual data.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
In related research, SERVQUAL [2] measures the quality 
of service by measuring the gap between advance expectation 
and subsequent experience using five indicators prepared in 
advance. SURVPERF [5] measures the quality of service 
based on the subsequent experience alone. Related researches 
include a study that further increased the dimension from 
these five dimensions [6] and another that changed the 
dimension to measure the quality of electronic service [7].

Asesthere are many evaluation indicators, it is difficult to 
measure all services by one standard because there are many 
types of services and their characteristics largely differ. 
Meanwhile, related works on SEM include a study that has 
found relationships between customer loyalty and service 
quality [8] and another that has proposed a model to infer the 
purchase factor of the game by combining hierarchal Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) and SEM [9]. Another study 
made improvements to the SERVQUAL index and analyzed 
it with SEM [6]. These works, however, do not consider the 
emotion of the text. 
Meanwhile, emotional satisfaction is largely believed to 
affect service satisfaction [4]. In relation to this, sentimental 
analysis is useful in comprehending and handling the 
emotional information. A study utilizes sentiment analysis 
and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to evaluate the quality 
of airport services [10], while another determines the user’s 
evaluation for each attribute by combining Airport Council 
International (ACI)-defined airport service quality attributes 
and sentiment analysis [11]. In these studies, emotion is 
considered one of the important factors in sales of services; 
thus it is essential to consider emotion. However, no study has 
proposed structural equation modeling that considers the 
emotion contained in text.  
Therefore, the current paper proposes the model for SEM 
with emotion information. By using this model, we can 
acquire knowledge including emotion information visually. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this paper, the analysis is performed according to the 
process of Figure 1. First, topics are extracted by learning a 
topic model. Next, we find the emotion and topic distribution 
for that topic. Finally, a model is constructed based on these 
data and this is then analyzed by SEM so that can gain 
knowledge. 
A. Topic Model  
The topic model is a technology that tries to clarify the 
structure of a document group by inferring words contained in 
the topic based on the premise that the document group has a 
specific topic. In a topic model, a document is a collection of 
words probabilistically generated by the topic to which it 
belongs. 
Topic models include different methods, such as latent 
semantic analysis (LSA) [12], LDA [13] and hLDA [14]. The 
LDA assumes a multi-topic model in which the document is 
based on mixed topics. LDA has a 1:n relationship between 
documents and topics, not 1:1 like LSA. LDA is considered to 
be a more natural model in documents, such as review texts 
that are written in one document about various aspects [13]. 
HLDA is an extended method of LDA and is a hierarchal 
model as shown in Figure 2. It has the property of 
automatically constructing relationships among hierarchical 
topics. As a learning result, a hierarchical model constructed 
hierarchically and a keyword group constituting each topic are 
generated together with their generation probabilities. The 
specific content of the topic can be inferred from the keyword 
groups of a topic. In this study, hLDA is used because it is a 
natural document model and the relationships between topics 
are defined automatically. 
B. Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment analysis literally refers to the analysis of 
emotions. By using sentiment analysis, such as posted 
comments, one can determine whether consumers have 
negative or positive emotions and the strength of such 
emotions. Sentiment analysis can be performed on a per-
document or per-sentence basis. 
To embed emotion to SEM explained later, we have to 
recognize emotions on each topic for each review. In this 
study, we regard the average of emotion values ranging 
between -1(negative) and 1(positive) as document emotions 
by calculating Equation (1) as  
𝐸𝑖𝑚= 
1
|𝑇𝑖(𝑆𝑚)| ∑
𝑠∈𝑇𝑖(𝑆𝑚) 𝐸(𝑠),
                 (1) 
where Eim is the emotion about the topic 𝑇𝑖 of the review Rm; 
Sm is a set of sentences in Rm and | | is the element number of a 
set; Ti(Sm) represents the sentence set of Sm, including the topic 
I; and the function E recognizes the emotion of a sentence. If 
there is no sentence related to a topic, (1) calculates 0 and 
regards this sentiment about the topic as neutral. The longer 
the review, the more likely it is to include other topics. 
Therefore, it is possible to extract emotions related to topics 
more accurately by focusing only on sentences containing 
topics in reviews. 
Here, valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning 
(VADER) [15] is used as function E in the equation. This

method is particularly accurate for sentiment analysis in 
social media. There are several studies that used VADER. 
One study analyzed the correlation of positive and negative 
user reviews of mobile apps before and after app update, 
respectively, by using VADER because VADER has the high 
precision in the social media field [16]. In VADER, the value 
of emotion is represented by -1 to 1 (the closer to -1 the more 
negative and the closer to 1 the more positive the emotion). 
Therefore, the Eim outputs the value between -1 and 1.  
C. Strucuture Equation Modeling (SEM) 
SEM [17] is a technology characterized by the use of 
factor analysis and regression analysis. Factor analysis is the 
idea that observed variables are based on some hidden factor, 
and the influence of the factor is to be determined by 
“correlation” (variance / covariance). Regression analysis is 
a technique for finding the relationship between a variable to 
be predicted (target variable) and a variable (explanatory 
variable, independent variable) that describes the target 
variable. In other words, SEM can be considered as a factor 
regression analysis. 
The SEM can express causal relationships between 
variables visually and quantitatively by using a path model, 
as shown in Figure 3. A path model consists of three 
elements: latent variables, observed variables, and paths. 
Latent variables are factors that cannot be observed in actual. 
Observation variables can actually be observed and are 
essential for estimating a latent variable. In the path model. 
Latent variables are represented by ellipses and observation 
variables are represented by rectangles. The causal 
relationship between such items is represented by the path of 
the arrow, and the degree of influence is represented by the 
path coefficient. 
D. Construct Path Model and Find Knowledge 
Topics that cannot be observed directly are considered as 
latent variables serving as correspondence between SEM and 
topic model. The keywords that make up the topic, the 
emotion for the topics, and the rating values of each review 
are the observation variables. From the idea of the topic 
model that words are generated by topics, each topic is 
regarded as a factor and the paths from the topics are drawn 
to the keywords to which the topics are related. Moreover, the 
paths between topics are drawn from the upper topics to the 
lower ones based on the idea of the hierarchical structure of 
the hLDA topics.  
Next, we explain the process of incorporating emotional 
information into the path model. Emotional information 
influences the intention of a model. Thus, we have to 
carefully 
determine 
how 
to 
incorporate 
emotional 
information. Generally, emotions for service are generated as 
perceived experience (after the service) or the expectation 
(before using the service). Therefore, the model is expressed 
by drawing a path to emotional information from each topic. 
When we draw a path from the topic to emotional 
information, the causal relationship between the emotion and 
the topic becomes clear. Moreover, rating evaluation is 
considered to be generated from the top-level topic that 
includes all elements. Therefore, by drawing the path from 
the top-level topic to the rating evaluation, the model can 
represent the causal relationship with the rating.  
Furthermore, by comparing the values of path 
coefficients from the higher topics to the lower topics, it is 
possible to find an important factor for the rating. By paying 
attention to the path coefficient from the lowest topic to the 
keyword, we can find the degree of influence of more detailed 
factors. The path coefficients from each topic to emotion are 
large and the causal relationship with emotion could be 
expressed. By comparing the path coefficient from each topic 
to emotion, topics with a larger causal relationship with 
emotion can be found. 
However, the path model of SEM is usually prone to 
model identification failure, especially if there are too many 
latent variables. Conversely, if the number of latent variables 
is less, the amount of information in the model may be too 
small for interpretation. As the topic is a latent variable in the 
path model, the number of topics must also be adjusted. We 
also need to remove unreliable paths and observation 
variables with relatively small influence.

feasibility of proposed approaches described in Section III.

Furthermore, we consider the experimental results. 
A. Dataset, Parameters, and Processing 
In this analysis, the data must have text data and 
numerical evaluation data, and it is ideal to have as many 
review data as possible in order to apply the topic model. In 
addition, in order to characterize statistical data based on the 
concept of Bag of Words, the text of one review data must 
include many words. In this experiment, we employ user-
reviews of the datasets published online by Kaggle and 
Github: the airport, hotel, app for shops and electronic 
services for purchasing clothes. Airport, app and electronic 
services reviews are collected by web scraping. Hotel reviews 
are provided by Datafiniti’s Business Database. Each review 
has review text with a rating between 1 and 5 or 1 and 10. We 
also regard a review text as a document. In order to ensure 
that the topics and the appearance frequency of the feature 
words described are included in each document, only 
documents stated with more than 30 words are used. The app 
analyzes information from randomly extracted data. The 
number of reviews after these pre-processing is shown in 
Table 1. In this experiment, emotions on topics in the lowest 
level are determined for the construction of a path model. 
Moreover, 𝑇𝑖 in (1) indicates a topic of the lowest level (i.e., 
topic in third level). Whether a sentence includes or does not 
include a topic is determined based on whether or not a 
keyword constituting the topic is included.  
As criteria to evaluate the result, we use goodness of fit 
index (GFI), adjusted GFI (AGFI), root means square error 
of approximation (RMSEA), and Bayes information criterion 
(BIC) were used. As equations for GFI, AGFI, RMSEA, BIC,

𝑆 is value of the actual sample covariance matrix. 𝑡𝑟((𝐴)2)  
expresses 𝑡𝑟(𝐴𝐴′), 
𝐴𝐺𝐹𝐼 = 1 −  
𝑛(𝑛+1)
2𝑑𝑓  (1 − 𝐺𝐹𝐼),     (3) 
where 𝑛  is the number of observed variables and 𝑑𝑓  is 
degrees of freedom, 
𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸𝐴 =  √max [𝜒2−𝑑𝑓
𝑁−1 , 0]
𝑑𝑓
,                 (4) 
where 𝑁 is the number of samples, 
𝐵𝐼𝐶 =  𝜒2 − 𝑑𝑓 log(𝑁).                   (5) 
And as an equation to calculate degrees of freedom, 
𝑑𝑓 =  
1
2 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) − 𝑝,                       (6) 
where 𝑝 is the number of variables in equation. Equation (2) 
expresses how well the total variance in the saturation model 
can be explained by the estimation model. A value between 
0 and 1 is taken and the closer a value is to 1, the better the 
model becomes. A value of 0.9 or higher is desirable. GFI is 
unconditionally improved in fitness as model degrees of 
freedom decreases. Equation (3) corrects the shortcomings of 
GFI and penalizes models with many parameters and high 
complexity. The same value as GFI is taken, and the closer it 
is to 1 the better the resulting model. If the model is not 
complex, GFI and AGFI will be close values. Equation (4) is 
an index that expresses the difference between the model 
distribution and the true distribution. The fit is good with a 
value of 0.05 or less, and the fit is bad with 0.1 or more. 
Equation (5) estimates the posterior probability based on chi-
square value when the model is selected. This is used to 
evaluate the balance between model suitability and the 
amount of information and is used in carrying out relative 
evaluation. It is better for the value to be smaller. 
In this experiment, we used several packages and 
libraries: Mallet package [18] for hLDA, Python's nltk 
package with VADER technology [19] for sentiment 
analysis, and SEM package of R [20] for SEM analysis.  
B. Result 
Table 1 shows the calculation results of the evaluation 
indexes for each data and analyzed models. From Table 1, we 
could find that hotel, airport, and e-commerce models have a 
GFI of over 0.9 and AGFI maintains high levels. Moreover, 
none of the models have an RMSEA of less than 0.05 but the 
values are close to 0.05. It can be said that all of models fit 
well to the dataset and the constructed models are reliable 
from the viewpoint of these indices.  
As an example, let us show the result of the app dataset 
in Figure 4. The words at the bottom of the model are those 
that make up the identified topics from the text data of the 
review using the topic extraction with hLDA. Here, the topics 
(latent variables) are estimated by authors from the words that 
make up each topic. For example, “response” is estimated 
because it has a large causal relationship with “support” and 
is considered to be a topic related to responses to actions, 
such as “install,” “team,” and “issue.” We were able to create 
a path model based on the hierarchical structure of a text data 
document group revealed by hLDA. Further, causal 
relationships can be analyzed by paying attention to arrow 
and values calculated by SEM between topics or between 
topics and words at the bottom of the model. 
We focus on the “correspond” area with a large path 
coefficient from the top topic because this “correspond” can 
be considered as a topic having a large influence to the 
evaluation (rating). The “response” is also considered to be 
an important factor for evaluation because this path has a 
larger path coefficient after comparing between the two 
topics under “correspond.” Here, the path between the latent 
variable “response” and the value of the emotion has a large 
coefficient, implying that “response” influences the emotion 
strongly. Given that “correspond” has a strong path, 
therefore, it can be considered that the emotion of response 
also leads to evaluation.  
In the same way, when we check the other paths to 
emotions, we could find the relationships with and influences 
to evaluation. From the figure, “response,” “flow,” “price,” 
and “e-service” have an effect of emotions (the paths over 
0.5) and the “design” and “individual” did not. We are not 
certain whether the results agree or not, but this specific one 
indicates which topics lead to emotional satisfaction. In this 
way, it is possible to improve the service by quantitatively 
understanding the specific service factors that influence to the 
emotions and evaluation. 
We summarize the following findings from the 
experiments: 
⚫ 
We obtained knowledge by analyzing service 
while considering emotions. 
⚫ 
We determined the impact on the rating of each 
topic. 
⚫ 
We obtained the causal relationship between each 
topic and emotion quantitatively and provided 
clues for further analyses.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we analyzed the causal relationships in 
service by using SEM and emotional information. We 
constructed the path model by using hLDA and sentiment 
analysis between topics and emotions. The findings of the 
experiment using the user reviews of airports, hotels, 
shopping apps, and electronic services show the feasibility of 
our proposed model.  
We also performed service analysis considering emotion 
and obtained knowledge reflecting emotional information 
from the user reviews. The consideration of emotional 
information is essential for service analysis, and the creation 
of path models with emotional information is considered 
effective in extracting information that helps increase service 
satisfaction. It is suggested that the analysis process in this 
paper may provide useful knowledge for service analysis and 
service improvement. On the one hand, this can be used by 
service providers in improving services and creating new 
services. Service providers can quantitatively find factors that 
have major impacts on the evaluation of services and

customer emotions. On the other hand, it can be used by 
service users to efficiently grasp the outline of services that 
are not formed. Although we analyzed the indefinite service 
in the experiments, it can be applied to other things like 
tangible products. The potential applicability is high because 
analysis is performed from the text. 
As future works, we have to consider three points: 
emotion 
expression. 
Firstly, 
we 
extracted 
emotion 
information of topics based on (1), but this equation does not 
consider the length of the sentence. Nevertheless, it enables us 
to accurately determine the emotion on the topic by 
considering the weight based on the sentence length. For 
example, longer sentences are more likely to include other 
topics. Therefore, it may be possible to extract emotions 
related topics more accurately by reducing the impact of such 
sentences on emotions of specific topics. Secondly, when two 
or more topics are included in one sentence, even if it is used 
in a contrasting sentence, such as “(Text about TOPIC A) but 
(Text about TOPIC B),” the same emotion value is calculated 
for the topic. If there is a conjunction (e.g., “but”), a more 
accurate emotion analysis can be performed by further 
processing, such as dividing. Finally, in this paper, the 
accuracy improvement and knowledge are obtained by 
constructing path models under different assumptions during 
the construction of the path model.
