Abstract‚ÄîIn this contribution, a recently conducted measurement
campaign in a suburban scenario for the Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) Air-to-Ground (A2G) radio channel is introduced.
The downlink signals in an in-service Long Term Evolution
(LTE) network were collected and utilized to extract the Chan-
nel Impulse Responses (CIRs). A high-resolution parameter
estimation algorithm derived based on the Space-Alternating
Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) principle is ap-
plied to estimate the delays, Doppler frequencies and complex
amplitudes of MultiPath Components (MPCs) from the CIRs.
Based on the MPC estimation results, fast fading characteristics
of the A2G channels are investigated. It is found that the
Rician distribution models the fast fading the best compared
to Nakagami, Lognormal and Rayleigh distributions. Rician K-
factors are also calculated for the A2G channels.

I. INTRODUCTION
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted a
surge of research interest. They can be exploited as aerial Base
Stations (BS) [1] and/or aerial user equipments [2] to enable
various applications such as sensing, delivery, etc. [3]. There
has been a certain amount of works conducted to understand
the Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels, e.g., in [2], [4]‚Äì[10] and
references therein. Channel characteristics including path loss,
delay dispersions, Doppler spread, etc. were investigated. It is
worth noting that the Ô¨Årst comprehensive measurement-based
angular characterization of the A2G channels was carried out
in [4]. Although some previous works characterized the small-
scale fading, i.e., fast fading, using the Rician K factor, it is not
known whether the Rician distribution is really suitable for the
A2G channels. In this contribution, we conduct measurement-
based analysis, to see which distribution is the most suitable
for modeling the fast fading. The rest of this paper is structured
as follows. The measurement equipment, scenario and raw
data processing are described in Section II. Section III elab-
orates the investigation on the fast fading behavior. Finally,
conclusive remarks are drawn in Section IV.
II. MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT, SCENARIO, AND RAW
DATA PROCESSING
The measurement equipment, scenario, CIR extraction and
MPC parameter estimation are brieÔ¨Çy introduced in this sec-
tion. Detailed information can also be found in [6].
A. Transmitter and receiver
In the measurement campaign, a commercial Frequency
Division Duplexing Long Term Evolution (FDD-LTE) base
station was exploited as the transmitter with its real-time
downlink signals collected by the receiver. The receiver system
mainly consisted of the following components: a UAV, a
Universal-Software-deÔ¨Åned Radio-Peripheral (USRP) device
of type B210 [11], an Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator
(OCXO), a cube Lenovo computer, an omnidirectional antenna
and three lithium batteries. The OCXO provided a stable local
oscillator for the USRP. The cube computer controlled the
USRP via the GNU radio software and stored the received
data. These components were loaded on the UAV Ô¨Åxed tightly
as illustrated in in Figure 1(a).
B. Measurement scenario
The measurement was performed in the suburban scenario
as illustrated in Figure 1(c). There were several tall buildings
and many metal containers with lower heights. The LTE base
station was located in front of and almost in the Line-of-Sight
(LoS) of the UAV. The carrier frequency of the LTE downlink
signals was 1.8 GHz, and the bandwidth was 13.5 MHz. The
UAV Ô¨Çied vertically from the ground to the height of 50 m in
about 35 seconds as indicated in Figure 1(b). The signals were
acquired by using the USRP with a sample rate of 30.72 MHz.
Due to the hardware data steaming limitations, the data were
stored in fragments each lasting 15 seconds.
C. Raw data processing
The CIRs were extracted from the Cell SpeciÔ¨Åc Signals
(CRSs) as elaborated in [2], [12]. BrieÔ¨Çy, synchronization and
physical cell detection were Ô¨Årst done. With the transmitted
CRSs known according to [13], the channel transfer functions
can be calculated, and so the CIRs. The signal model of a CIR
in the SAGE algorithm [14] is formulated as
h(t, œÑ) =

where L, Œ±‚Ñì(t), œÑ‚Ñì(t), and ŒΩ‚Ñì(t) denote the number of paths,
complex amplitudes, delays and Doppler frequencies, respec-
tively, and Œ¥(¬∑) is the Dirac delta function. Four consecutive
CIRs were considered as one snapshot. The SAGE algorithm
was applied with L = 18 that was found proper to fully extract
the dominant MPCs in each snapshot.

III. SMALL-SCALE FADING
As illustrated in Figure 2, we Ô¨Årst show concatenated
power-delay-proÔ¨Åles (PDPs) lasting 15 s that correspond to the
UAV Ô¨Çying from the ground to the air. It can be observed that
the channels before and after 7.5 seconds are different. We
use Low Height (LH) and High Height (HH) to distinguish
them. Our conjecture [6] for the difference is that when the
height was low, the UAV could only receive the LoS signals
and the signals reÔ¨Çected from buildings with high heights or
side walls of containers. However, when the UAV Ô¨Çied high
above the containers and buildings, signals reÔ¨Çected from the
roofs started impinging into the UAV, and the signal power also
increased. The SAGE estimation results are also illustrated in
Figure 3 for the example channel shown in Figure 2.

To fully understand the small-scale fading behaviors, Akaike‚Äôs
Information Criteria (AIC) is applied to select the best Ô¨Åtting
model for the fading amplitudes in both cases, among all
the J (J = 4) candidate distributions: Rician, Nakagami,
Log-normal and Rayleigh. AIC is a measure of the relative
Ô¨Åtting goodness of a statistical model, and is widely used
in the wireless communications [15], [16]. Akaike weights
derived from AICs which satisfy
JP
i=1
œâj = 1 are applied to
select the best distribution with the largest Akaike weight. We
choose 80 SAGE snapshots to obtain reliable Akaike weights.
Note that N/U ‚â• 40 should be satisÔ¨Åed to obtain reliable
Akaike weights, where N is the sample number, U is the
number of free model parameter(s). Readers are referred to
[16] for elaborated discussions about AIC. The distance that
the UAV moves in 80 SAGE snapshots is about 4 times the
half wavelength, which is in the small-scale level. Figs. 4(a)
and 4(b) illustrate the AIC weights for the four candidate
distributions in the LH and HH cases respectively. It can be
observed that in both cases, the Rician distribution best Ô¨Åts the
small-scale fading, the goodness of Nakagami and Log-normal
distributions is similar, and the Rayleigh distribution is not
suitable for modelling the fading behaviors. Furthermore, the
best Ô¨Åtting rate of Rician distribution in the HH case (70.9%)
is lower than that of the LH case (74.3%). This is consistent
with the fact that the HH channel measured in this speciÔ¨Åc
scenario herein includes more non-negligible MPCs.
Since the Rician distribution has the best goodness of Ô¨Åt
in both cases and is commonly used to model the propagation
channel with a dominant path, the Rician K-factor is investi-
gated by using the moment-based method, speciÔ¨Åed in [17],

where Var(¬∑) and E(¬∑) represent the variance and the expec-
tation of the argument, respectively. Figure 5 illustrates the
CDFs for the K-factors in the LH and HH cases respectively.
It can be observed that the HH K-factor is smaller than the LH
K-factor under the 65% level. This is consistent with the fact
that the more MPCs with non-negligible powers in the HH
case can sometimes result in more severe fading compared to
the LH case. However, the maximum HH K-factor is larger
than that of the LH case. This is also understandable since the
blockage to the LoS path is lower.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The low altitude UAV radio channel in a suburban scenario
was investigated. Based on the downlink data received from
a commercial LTE base station, high resolution estimation
results of multipath components were obtained using the
SAGE algorithm. Based on the SAGE estimation results, fast
fading behaviors were analyzed. Among Rician, Nagakami,
Lognormal and Rayleigh distributions, it has been found that
the Rician distribution can best model the fast fading of
the UAV channel with a best-Ô¨Åtting rate of more than 70%.
Moreover, large Ricean K-factors, with average values of
10 dB and maximum ones of 20 dB, were found. In addition, it
is interesting to Ô¨Ånd that in this special suburban scenario, the
UAV channel became less Los-dominant (probably due to the
reÔ¨Çections at the roofs of buildings and metallic containers),
which is different from the common belief that the A2G
channel at a higher hight should be more LoS-dominant.
