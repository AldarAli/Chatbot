Abstract— The present work reports an application of near-wall 
(on the order of 100 nm) thermometry utilizing Brownian 
motion of nano-particle image velocimetry (nPIV) tracer 
particles within a solid-fluid interface. Initially, a Monte Carlo 
simulation of Brownian particle movement in the evanescent 
wave region in the fluid-wall interface was employed to optimize 
the relevant measurement parameters. The results of the 
numerical simulation showed that the ratio of peak-width to 
peak-height of the nPIV correlation function could be 
successfully used as a temperature measurement index in the 
flow. Furthermore, the percentages of the particles remaining in 
the visible depth of the evanescent wave region may be 
considered as another thermometric parameter. Experimental 
studies using an objective-based evanescent wave technique 
were conducted to verify the results of the numerical 
simulations and to establish the experimental uncertainty of the 
temperature measurement. The experimental results verify the 
feasibility of temperature measurement   within ±2.5°C 
accuracy bond and an out-of-plane resolution of O (100 nm) 
within the wall region. Variations of the evanescent wave 
thickness, i.e., out-of-plane resolution of thermometry, did not 
affect the sensitivity of the temperature measurement. However, 
the temperature range measured using the objective-based total 
internal reflection technique was limited due to changes in the 
optical characteristics of the imaging setup at higher 
temperatures.

INTRODUCTION 
 
This paper is an extension of our previous work reported 
in ICQNM 2012 [1]. Temperature measurement, or 
thermometry, is of paramount significance in many industrial 
applications as well as in scientific research [2]. Recently, 
advancements in micro fabrication techniques have made it 
possible to miniaturize fluidic devices to the micro scale [3]. 
In this fluid transport regime, or microfluidics, fluid flows 
through small channels with overall dimensions on the order 
of 10 to 100 μm. Micro-heat exchangers, micro-mixers, 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) microchips, microfluidic 
incubators, and Lab-on-a-chip devices are some examples of 
microfluidic applications. Microfluidic platforms are the main 
structure of the so-called Lab-on-a-chip systems that have 
helped to reduce not only the testing sample size but also the 
process time and component cost in biochemistry.  
 
Thermometry at the microscale is an important 
requirement in the design and operation of micro-thermal 
devices for a wide range of applications, such as biological 
reactions, chemical processing fuel cells, and heat exchangers. 
[4]. Temperature-induced control of gene expressions and 
tumor 
metabolism, 
for 
example, 
requires 
accurate 
thermometry inside living cells for implementation [5]. 
Kucsko et al. [6] developed a nanometer-scale thermometry 
method in living cells utilizing the coherent manipulation of 
the electronic spin associated nitrogen-vacancy color centers 
in diamond. Temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK were 
detected using this technique. Chaudhari et al. [7] 
demonstrated the use of transient liquid crystal thermometry 
of micro fabricated PCR vessels for DNA replication. The 
reflected wavelengths of light from these excited liquid 
crystals are strongly dependent on the sample temperature. 
PCR processes require an accurate cycling of sample 
temperature, and the measurement of temperature uniformity 
in a micro-fabricated vessel array using encapsulated liquid 
crystal was demonstrated. Temperatures were measured with 
a resolution of ±0.5°C. Thermo-chromic liquid crystal–based 
slurries and paints have been reported to measure surface 
temperatures with a maximum spatial resolution of 1 µm [8].  
 
Thermometry also plays a crucial role in electronic 
cooling inside miniaturized devices. In micro-electronic 
device systems, the exponential growth of component density 
has generated challenging thermal management issues for 
implementation. The present local chip heat fluxes are much 
higher for forced-air cooling techniques to effectively 
dissipate heat from the hotspots [9]. Single-phase forced-
liquid and two-phase evaporative cooling techniques are 
currently designed for the microprocessors for better 
efficiencies. These cooling devices consist of mini or micro 
channels for maintaining a coolant flow through the 
microprocessors. Accurate measurements of the wall surface 
and bulk fluid temperatures would help to better estimate the 
heat transfer coefficients. Measurements with micron-scale 
spatial resolution without disturbing the flow would further 
assist in the better design of these channels. 
 
With the available measurement methodologies, micro-
scale thermometry techniques that can measure wall surface 
and bulk fluid temperatures can be broadly classified as 
invasive or non-invasive thermometry [2]. The invasive 
technique, 
for 
example, 
includes 
micro- 
or 
nano-
thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors (RTD),

scanning thermal probes, and atomic force microscope (AFM) 
temperature probes. Non-invasive thermometry includes 
optical thermometry, liquid crystal thermometry, infrared 
thermometry, and Raman thermometry [10] .  
 
Invasive, or contact-based, methods use standard CMOS 
(complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technologies in 
the installation of conventional temperature sensors inside 
micro- or mini-channels. In small-scale applications, an array 
of diode sensors was used for surface temperature 
measurement at small scale [11]. However, the spatial 
resolution was relatively low because it depended on the 
dimensions of the diodes used. Additionally, this technique 
required intricate fabrication procedures for both the sensor 
array and the control unit. Han and Kim measured the surface 
temperature of a square area using a 32x32-diode array with a 
spatial resolution on the order of one hundred microns. 
Watanabe et al. [12] investigated the use of micro 
thermocouple probes for measuring cellular thermal 
responses. Williams and Wickramasinghe [13] introduced the 
concept of scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) by 
fabricating a 1000nm nm thermocouple at the end of a 
scanning tunneling microscope tip. The AFM-based thermal 
probe also works under similar principles [14]. Kim et al [15] 
used the SThM technique to measure temperature fields in a 
vacuum with a spatial resolution of 10 nm and a temperature 
resolution of 15 mK. The above measurement methods were 
not suitable for whole-field temperature measurement. In 
addition, these methods required electrical connections that 
could produce electromagnetic noise along with possible 
sparks. These effects could deter their use in corrosive 
environments. However, these sensors are intrusive, and their 
application can affect the micro-scale flow structure. Because 
of this limitation, non-invasive methods are generally 
preferred. 
 
For the past few decades, many attempts have been made 
to measure the temperature field at the microscale with non-
invasive or non-contact modes. Non-invasive thermometric 
methods such as molecular tagging thermometry (MTT), 
infrared thermometry (IRT), laser-induced fluorescence 
thermometry (LIFT) and particle image velocimetry (PIV)-
based thermometry are generally preferred for micro-scale 
flow investigations [16-18]. Infrared thermography has been 
used to measure the surface temperature of microchannel heat 
sinks [19]. However, the emissivity values of the tested 
medium need to be known to accurately predict the 
temperature in this technique. LIFT is based on the 
temperature dependence of fluorescent dye intensity dissolved 
in the fluid and has been widely used in micro-fluidics 
thermometry. Ross et al. [20] demonstrated an application of 
the LIF method using a single dye and measured temperatures 
with a maximum uncertainty of 3.5°C. A two-color LIF 
method was suggested to overcome the uncertainties caused 
by possibly non-uniform illumination [21]. Rayleigh-Bernard 
convection was investigated using two-color laser-induced 
fluorescence by Sakakibara and Adrian [22]. Kim and Yoda 
[23] used a dual-tracer fluorescence thermometry technique at 
the microscale and showed a measurement uncertainty of ± 
1.1°C at a spatial resolution of 3.7 µm in their work. 
Thompson and Maynes [24] utilized phosphorescence tracer 
dyes to simultaneously quantify fluid temperature and fluid 
velocity fields using MTT and molecular tagging velocimetry 
(MTV), respectively. Hu and Koochesfahani [25] conducted 
a simultaneous whole-field measurement of velocity and 
temperature using the MTT technique and were able to 
measure temperature with an uncertainty of 0.23°C. 
 
Fluorescent particle tracers seeded in the fluid for micro- 
or nano-PIV are small and undergo Brownian motion [26] 
This motion can introduce a bias in PIV fluid velocity 
measurements at low velocity when using a cross-correlation 
method by increasing the width and reducing the height of the 
correlation peak. This is an undesirable effect in velocimetry 
as it reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of the results and 
increases the uncertainty of determining the average particle 
displacement. Olsen and Adrian [27] proposed that such 
spreading of the correlation peak width could be utilized for 
thermometry because the Brownian motion of the seeded 
particles has a direct dependence on the fluid temperature.  
Hohreiter et al. [28] demonstrated the use of a cross-
correlation-based micro-PIV (µPIV) technique utilizing the 
Brownian motion of seeded particles to determine the 
temperature. Their results showed temperature measurement 
with an experimental accuracy of ± 3°C inside a 
microchannel. In a separate study, Chamarthy et al. [29] noted 
that a low image density PIV tracking method to process 
particle images performed better than the cross-correlation 
method for thermometry. The average difference between the 
predicted and measured fluid temperature was recorded to be 
± 2.6°C with an out-of-plane resolution of approximately 20 
µm.  
 
Park et al. [30] showed the potential application of optical 
serial sectioning microscopy method (OSSM) for temperature 
measurement utilizing Brownian motion of nanoparticles in a 
fluid away from the wall. OSSM uses diffraction patterns of 
particle images to track its full three-dimensional Brownian 
motion. They used a dry objective lens to detect the diffraction 
patterns of 500 nm polystyrene ﬂuorescent nanoparticles 
suspended in water at a low volume concentration of 4 × 10-6. 
Their experiments for a fluid temperature range of 5 to 70°C 
showed a correlation between the Brownian diffusivity and 
the mean square displacement (MSN) of nanoparticles that 
could potentially be used in a non-intrusive and micro-scale 
thermometry for nanoparticle suspension fluids. However, in 
the near-wall region, the Brownian motion of nanoparticles is 
non-isotropic and hindered, and the estimated diffusion will 
not be same as that in the bulk flow. Moreover, in the micro-
scale measurements discussed above, volume illumination is 
commonly used, which makes the measurements more 
complicated. 
 
nPIV is an extension of µPIV, where illumination is 
provided only in the region very close to the wall on the order 
of O (100 nm) [31-36]. nPIV is based on evanescent-wave 
illumination created by the total internal reflection (TIR) of a 
laser beam at the fluid-solid interface. At the sub-micron 
scale, Brownian displacement is of the same length scale as 
that of the fluid convection and can therefore greatly affect 
fluid velocimetry when using particle tracers. The effect of 
hindered Brownian motion in the near-wall region is 
prominently visible in nPIV measurements as particles move

in and out of visible depth during the nPIV imaging time 
interval [36-38]. This movement could cause the cross-
correlation peak-widths in nPIV measurements to behave in a 
different manner than that in µPIV measurements. We 
reported a simple numerical investigation of the effect of fluid 
temperature variation on the nPIV correlation function in the 
evanescent wave region in the near-wall region [1]. We 
showed that the PIV correlation function characteristics of the 
hindered Brownian motion of tracer particles in the near-wall 
region could be utilized for temperature measurements. 
However, the effect of the variation in fluorescence intensity 
of tracer particles and surface forces caused by the 
temperature change, which occurs in practical thermometry 
with fluorescence particles, were not considered.  
 
The present work aims to extend and apply our earlier 
study [1] for near-wall temperature measurements, or nano-
particle image thermometry (nPIT), to a wider temperature 
range and implement it in a real experimental setup. Prior to 
actual nPIV experimentation, the feasibility of the technique 
for non-intrusive near-wall temperature measurement is 
initially investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation to study 
the effect of temperature on the cross-correlation function 
peak-width and peak-height in the near-wall hindered 
Brownian motion. Artificial nPIV images are generated for 
fluids at stationary conditions and varying temperatures to 
include 
experimental 
effects 
such 
as 
non-uniform 
illumination, hindered Brownian motion, particle-wall surface 
forces, and temperature dependence of particle fluorescent 
intensity. Experiments are then performed under similar 
conditions to verify the results of the simulations and establish 
the applicability of nPIT and its experimental uncertainties 
and to demonstrate the practicability of using an objective-
based nPIT setup for near-wall temperature measurement.   
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II the methods used in our analysis are described. 
Theoretical background for the thermometric method is also 
presented, and we describe our experimental setup and 
methodology used in the experimental measurements. The 
results are presented in Section III. Finally, we present our 
conclusions and ideas for future work in Section IV. 
 
II. 
METHOD 
A. Theoretical 
As mentioned earlier, the nPIV method makes use of the 
evanescent wave generated at the glass-water interface to 
illuminate particles only in the near-wall region. Fig. 1 shows 
a schematic of the experimental setup for the present study. 
Here, the light beam passes through a microscope objective 
and microscope slide, with refractive index n1 into the 
transparent fluid (water) with a lower refractive index, n2, at 
an angle exceeding the critical angle, causing total internal 
reflection at the interface. 
𝜃𝑐 = sin−1(𝑛2 𝑛1
⁄
)                                  (1) 
The electromagnetic field enters into the lower refractive 
index region and propagates parallel to the interface, creating 
an evanescent wave close to the interface. This evanescent 
wave excites the fluorescent particles in this region, while the 
particles further away in the bulk liquid remain unexcited. 
Intensity of the evanescent wave decays exponentially with 
distance normal to the wall (z),

I0 is the maximum intensity at the wall and zp is the 
penetration depth, given as:

 .                    (3) 
Here λ0 is the wavelength of the light and  is the incident 
angle. For visible light at a glass-water interface, zp is on the 
order of O (100 nm). However, the effective depth of the 
visible region zv depends on the optical features of the 
imaging system: penetration depth, intensity of the incident 
laser beam, fluorescent particle properties, and characteristics 
of the imaging camera. In an actual experiment, zv typically 
ranges from 300 to 400 nm. In an nPIV setup, the objective 
lenses generally have a larger focal depth than the penetration 
depth of the evanescent wave, and all of the particles in the 
image are in focus [36].

setup used (not to scale) 
 
For a stationary fluid, Brownian motion and surface 
forces govern the particle movement in the wall region. 
Brownian motion is usually characterized in terms of its 
diffusion coefficient. In an unconfined flow, the Stokes-
Einstein equation represents the Brownian diffusion 
coefficient in the form given below [34]. 
𝐷 =
𝑘𝑇
6𝜋𝜇𝑎                                      (4) 
Here k is the Boltzmann constant and T, a and µ are the 
temperature, diameter of particle and viscosity of the fluid, 
respectively. In addition to the direct dependence of the 
diffusion coefficient on temperature, the absolute viscosity of 
liquids also decreases with temperature. In the region close to 
the wall where nPIT is performed, the diffusion coefficient is 
hindered due to the additional hydrodynamic effects at the 
wall. The diffusion coefficient in this region is different from 
the value in Equation (1) and is different in the directions 
parallel and normal to the wall [34]. In the near-wall region,

where nPIT is interrogating, the diffusion coefficient is 
hindered due to the additional hydrodynamic effects at the 
wall and the Brownian diffusion coefficient, , can be 
expressed in the tensor form as:

  and || are the wall correction factors for movement 
perpendicular and parallel to the wall, respectively [11]:

where a is the particle radius and h=(z-a). As the particles 
move away from the wall, the correction factors tend to unity 
and the diffusion coefficient tends to that of the Stokes-
Einstein value. In the present simulation, this anisotropic 
nature of Brownian diffusion coefficient is considered. 
Quantifying the relative changes in particle movement due to 
Brownian motion is the key principle used in nPIT. In the 
present simulation, this anisotropic nature of the Brownian 
diffusion coefficient is considered. Quantifying the relative 
changes in particle movement due to Brownian motion is the 
key principle used in nPIT. Details of the numerical 
simulation are presented next. 
 
In the numerical simulation, particle displacement 
over a time period Δt due to Brownian motion ∆𝑟⃗ = ∆𝑥. 𝑖̂ +
∆𝑦. 𝑗̂ + ∆𝑧. 𝑘̂  (where i, j, k are unit vectors in Car 
tesian co-ordinate system) is obtained from the Langevin 
equation [31, 35]. For a stationary fluid with no external 
forces acting on the particle, the Langevin equation in the 
direction parallel to the wall reduces to 
Δ𝑥 = Δ𝑦 = ∑
{𝜒𝛿𝑟}                            (8)
𝑡=∆𝑡
𝑡=0
 
where  is white noise and 𝛿𝑟 = √2𝐷𝛿𝑡. Here, diffusion (D 
represents diffusion coefficient) is considered in the direction 
parallel to the wall. In the z direction perpendicular to the wall, 
the Langevin equation reduces to 
Δ𝑧 = ∑
{𝐷𝑧
𝑘𝑇 𝐹𝑧𝛿𝑡 + 𝑑𝐷𝑧
𝑑𝑧 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜒𝛿𝑟}           (9)
𝑡=∆𝑡
𝑡=0
 
where Dz is the diffusion coefficient normal to the wall and t 
represents time. The presence of the wall has a significant 
effect on the distribution of particles in the near-wall region 
through surface-induced forces on the particles. The external 
forces (Fz) acting on the particles in the direction 
perpendicular to the wall include electrostatic (el) and van der 
Waals (vdw) forces caused by the presence of the wall as well 
as the buoyancy force (b). The sum of these forces results in a 
non-uniform particle distribution within the suspending 
medium in the wall region. The total force acting on a particle 
in the direction normal to the wall would be the summation of 
all of these forces, Fz= Fel + Fvdw + Fb, which generates a net 
repulsive force that pushes the tracers away from the wall.  
 
From DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, and 
Overbeek) theory, the electrostatic repulsive force, Fel, is 
expressed as [39] 
𝐹𝑒𝑙 = 4𝜋𝜀0𝜀𝑎 (𝑘𝑇

and ε0  is the vacuum electrostatic permeability. ε is the 
dielectric constant of the fluid, e is the elementary charge, λ is 
the wall’s Debye length, and ζ p and ζw are the zeta potentials 
of the particle and wall, respectively. 
The van der Waals forces, Fvdw, can be expressed as [39]: 
𝐹𝑣𝑑𝑤 = 𝐴

where Hamaker’s constant, A, is of order O(10-20) for a 
spherical particle near a flat wall [33].  
 
The buoyancy force acting on a particle suspended in 
a fluid is due to the difference in weight between the particle 
and the displaced fluid and is expressed as: 
𝐹𝑏 = 4𝜋
3 𝑎3𝑔(𝜌𝑝 − 𝜌𝑓)                     (12) 
where ρp and ρf are the particle and fluid densities, 
respectively, and g is the gravitational acceleration. This force 
is observed to be negligible when compared to the 
electrostatic and van der Waals forces. The effects of 
temperature on viscosity, Debye length, zeta potential [40], 
and the dielectric constant value of water [41] are also 
included in the simulation.  
 For Monte Carlo simulations, artificial images of tracer 
particles at time t = 0 and later at time t =∆t are generated. 
Particle Brownian displacements in the x, y, and z directions 
are calculated for different time steps of ∆t = ∑δt using 
Equations (2) and (3) by including all the above-mentioned 
forces. The time step used in this work, δt = 5 μs, is much 
smaller than ∆t and is orders of magnitude larger than the 
particle momentum relaxation time [36]. Particle–wall 
collisions are considered perfectly elastic, preventing any 
particles from going ‘through’ the wall.  
 Particles were assumed to be circular with intensity 
values following a Gaussian distribution profile. The peak 
intensity values were selected from the experimental 
observations. In the present work, an illumination with 
exponential decaying intensity was considered in artificial 
images. The level of decay intensity was similar to the 
evanescent wave illumination in the described experiments. 
For a given optical setup undergoing total internal reflection,

the brightness (or size) of a particle in the image is an inverse 
function of its distance from the wall, where particles near the 
wall look bigger and brighter than those farther away. This 
variation in particle sizes in the field is created by 
implementing the exponentially decaying intensity of 
illumination normal to the wall combined with a fixed image 
noise level. An effective particle image diameter of four pixels 
with an airy disk pattern was employed for the brightest 
particle in the simulation.  
 
Figure 2: Variation of mean intensity of particles with temperature in 
experimental images 
 
 The excitation intensity of most fluorescent dyes varies 
with temperature. Initial experimental observations revealed 
that the mean particle intensity of the tracer beads also 
decreased with increasing temperature. Such variations can 
affect the PIT processing results to obtain temperature 
information from the obtained experimental images. The 
seeded particles used in this experiment were 100 nm (±5%) 
diameter 
polystyrene 
fluorescent 
particles 
(F8803, 
Invitrogen). Experiments were performed to quantify this 
effect, and Fig. 2 shows the results of the mean intensity of 
particles averaged over 100 images and normalized by their 
intensity at 15°C. This figure shows that the tracer particle 
intensity drops approximately 1.2 percent/°C for the 
temperature range tested. This effect is considered in the 
simulation of the generated nPIT images. Electronic noise and 
shot noise were also added to images using a combination of 
white and Gaussian distribution noise, respectively, to mimic 
real image characteristics [31]. 
 
A total of 1,200 particles with a radius of 50 nm were 
initially distributed over a distance of 875 nm normal to the 
wall in the fluid for the simulation. This resulted in a particle 
density of ~2.83 particles/µm3 and an image size of (200x180 
pixels (corresponding to 50µmx45µm), in the (x, y) directions, 
similar to the actual experimental images. Particles are 
initially uniformly distributed in the flow and then surface 
forces move the particles to their final steady state 
distribution. The final Probability Distribution Function 
(PDF) of the particles location throughout the visible region, 
zv, at this stage is shown in Fig. 3 for two cases: a) with no 
surfaces forces, and b) with surface forces for ζ-potentials of  
ζ particle = 100mV and ζ wall = 80mV, respectively [35, 42]. The 
surface forces and zeta potential of the particles and surface 
contribute significantly to the distribution of particles near the 
wall. As the figure shows, when the surface force effects are 
considered, the particles are pushed away from the wall 
region, creating a sparse particle density near the walls. The 
probability distribution function of the particles, for a given 
surface force, can adequately be modeled by a Boltzmann 
profile for the steady state condition [35]

  The image pairs were then processed using a standard 
FFT-based cross-correlation program to determine the width 
and height of the correlation peaks [31]. This program used a 
3D Gaussian peak-finding algorithm based on a surface fit of 
13 points in the peak region,

where A is the peak height , σx and σy  are representative peak 
widths in x and y directions, respectively. For a stationary 
fluid, the widths in both the x and y directions were similar in 
magnitude [29], therefore, the average peak-width value of x 
and y is presented.

achieved by placing a small fluid cell made of aluminum, the 
measurement cell, on top of a temperature-controlled inverted 
microscope stage. The measurement cell was made of an 
aluminum substrate with a glass coverslip (0.13 mm thick) 
pasted below it to provide optical access for the total internal 
reflection and imaging of the surface of the coverslip in the 
confined fluid. The fluid cell and microscope stage was 
insulated on the top. The microscope stage temperature and 
that of the fluid cell on it were maintained at a constant value 
by circulating water through the microscope stage from a 
constant-temperature supply tank (F25-ED Julabo). Prior to 
each experiment, the fluid was preheated to the temperature of 
the microscope stage to achieve a faster steady state condition. 
The fluid temperature in the fluid cell and in contact with the 
glass cover slip was recorded using precision K-type 
thermocouples. Experiments were conducted at a steady state 
condition where the fluid temperature was measured with an 
accuracy of ±0.1°C during each experiment. 
 The near-wall region was illuminated using an Ar-Ion 
continuous wave laser beam to excite the fluorescent particles. 
An EMCCD camera (ProEM 512, Princeton) attached to the 
microscope (Leica DMI6000B) captured images via a 
63x1.47 NA oil immersion objective. The pixel resolution 
obtained from this imaging setup was 4,106 (pixels/meter). 
The seeded fluorescent particles had peak excitation and 
emission wavelengths of 505 nm and 515 nm, respectively. In 
all of experimental runs, the particle concentration was 
maintained at a constant volume fraction of 0.02%. 
Evanescent wave illumination was generated on the lower 
glass-water interface of the fluid cell with a laser beam 
incident angle of 63°. The depth of the visible region (zv) was 
estimated to be zv=350±25 nm based on the penetration depth 
(zp of approximately 150 nm) and the intensity value of 
background noise in the captured images. Fig. 4 shows a 
typical experiment and simulated nPIT images obtained at 
20°C. 
 For each experiment at varying fluid temperatures, 1,500 
image pairs of 200x170 pixels were acquired with an inter-
frame time delay of 1.6 ms. The interrogation window size 
was set to 180×150 pixels with a search radius of 20 pixels to 
ensure sufficient numbers of matched tracer particles in the 
interrogation windows. The images were then post-processed 
using the same cross-correlation program used in the 
simulation section to determine the correlation peak-widths 
and peak-heights.  
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
  Equation (3) shows that Brownian displacement for a 
given fluid and particle size depends on the temperature and 
the inter-frame time delay Δt. Monte Carlo simulation was 
used to establish the effect of inter-frame time delay on PIV 
cross-correlation peak characteristics for different fluid 
temperatures. Synthetic images at different inter-frame time 
delays matching those of a typical nPIT experiment (1, 2, and 
4 ms) were generated for the analysis. Image processing and 
analysis parameters were also kept equal to those used for 
experimental images.  
 
Figure 5: Peak-width variation with temperature (top) and peak-height 
variation (bottom) with temperature 
 
Fig. 5a shows the variation of the calculated cross-
correlation function peak-widths (W) for synthetic nPIT 
images for the three inter-frame time delays, with error bars 
representing 95% confidence intervals [44]. This figure shows 
a semi-linear increase in the width of the nPIT correlation 
function with temperature for all of the time delays 
considered. Fig. 5b shows the variation of the peak-height (H) 
with temperature for the same time delays given in Fig. 5a. 
The correlation peak value shows a decreasing trend with 
temperature due to the increase in Brownian motion of the 
particles. Fig. 5 shows that in addition to an increase in the 
magnitude of the error bars with temperature, the calculated 
uncertainty at a given temperature increases when the time 
delay increases from 1 ms to 4 ms. The increase in 
experimental uncertainty due to an increase in inter-frame 
time delay may be associated with levels of the tracer particle

mismatch caused by particle drop off due to Brownian motion 
[36]. 
Figure 6: Variation of peak-width-to-height ratio with temperature obtained 
from the numerical simulation 
 Because the peak-width and peak-height variations seem 
to have opposite trends, the ratio of peak-width to peak-height 
is proposed as a better parameter for thermometry that offers 
a higher level of sensitivity than temperature measurement. 
The peak-width to peak-height ratio variation for various 
temperatures is depicted in Fig. 6. The temperature 
measurement sensitivity increases with increasing time 
delays, which can be attributed to a stronger effect of 
temperature on Brownian displacement of particle-tracers for 
longer time delays. However, measurement uncertainty also 
increases as the inter-frame time delay increases due to the 
deterioration of cross-correlation estimates. Considering 
additional experimental uncertainties, a smaller inter-frame 
time delay is preferable for an experiment, even though it has 
a slightly lower sensitivity to temperature variations.  
 After verifying the feasibility of using the nPIT technique 
based on Monte Carlo simulations, experiments were 
conducted to validate the results of the simulation. The nPIT 
images of the stationary fluid sample at varying bulk 
temperatures were collected using the objective-based 
illumination technique discussed earlier. Due to the small 
thickness of illumination in the evanescence region, Brownian 
motion caused the tracer particles to drop in and out of the 
visible region during the PIV inter-frame time delay Δt [36]. 
Because Brownian motion is a function of temperature, the 
number of particles staying in the visible region is expected to 
decrease with increasing fluid temperature. 
 Experimental images were analyzed to quantify this 
effect by measuring the percentage of the particles remaining 
within the visible depth () of the image, or “matched” 
particle, after a specified time delay Δt=1.6 ms. Fig. 7 depicts 
the percentage of particles that stayed within the visible region 
of zv in an image pair, where error bars indicate a 95% 
confidence level of the presented data [44]. The experimental 
values are determined by searching for the particles in an 
image pair that stayed within a given observation window of 
five pixels. This figure shows that as the fluid temperature 
increased, the number of particles that stayed in the visible 
depth during the time interval decreased. This result is caused 
by an increase in Brownian motion at higher temperatures, 
pushing more particles out of the visible depth.  
Figure 7: Percentage of particles remaining in the visible depth during nPIT 
experimentation 
 The results of the numerical simulation for the calculated 
values of   are also presented in Fig. 7 for three different 
evanescent wave thicknesses. Num-zp in the figure represents 
the numerical prediction for the corresponding penetration 
depth. For these data, the number of the particles staying 
within the visible depth was determined based on the exact z 
position of the particles calculated from the numerical 
simulation. The numerical results also showed a systematic 
decreasing trend for the number of particles remaining in the 
visible region, confirming that this parameter could be used as 
an assessment tool in thermometry. This figure also shows 
that the percentage of particles remaining in the visible depth 
increases with increasing penetration depth of the evanescent 
wave, with similar decreasing trends with temperature 
increase. Fig. 7 shows that for a 30°C temperature increase,  
predicts a 23% and 8% reduction for experimental and 
numerically estimated values, respectively. This difference 
may be attributed to other experimental factors, such as 
variations of particle size, fluorescence, and image noise with 
temperature, which affect detection of particles in the image. 
Further detailed experimental data are required to quantify this 
parameter as a tool for direct temperature measurement. In the 
present work, focus is given only to characterizing the effects 
of this particle “mismatch” on the standard cross-correlation 
function obtained from nPIT images for fluid thermometry. In 
an additional note, the above method also serves as a

metrological self-check on the basis of functional redundancy 
[45].  
Figure 8: Correlation peak width-to-height ratio comparison for 
simulation and experiments at Δt=1.6 ms 
 
 Fig. 8 compares the peak-width to peak-height ratio 
obtained from the experiment for different temperatures at a 
Δt value of 1.6 ms and simulations performed at the same time 
delay on a semi-log plot. Numerical results are presented for 
three different penetration depths in the range of the estimated 
experimental depth. The temperature measurement sensitivity 
is not significantly influenced by the variation in penetration 
depth (or incident angle of TIR). The experimental data 
follows two trends: the initial slope of the data up to 35°C 
matches well with that of the simulations but deviates beyond 
35°C. One reason for this deviation could be the change in 
optical characteristics of the objective used in the 
measurement, which was factory-corrected for working up to 
a temperature limit of 35°C. In addition, the optical properties 
of the contact oil used with the objective may also have varied 
at higher temperatures. These parameters could adversely 
affect measurements at higher temperatures and be cited as 
major drawbacks to the measurement technique using an 
objective-based system. There is a good agreement the 
between experimental and numerical trends for the peak-
width to peak-height ratio for temperatures up to 35°C 
regardless of the assumed penetration depth. The ratio 
decreases with increasing penetration depth of the evanescent 
wave. At larger penetration depths, more particles remain in 
the visible region (imaged), resulting in higher correlation 
peak-height values. From the spread of uncertainty in the 
width-to-height ratio of the experimental data depicted in Fig. 
8, the maximum uncertainty in the temperature measurement 
was estimated to be ±2.5°C for the case with zv of 
approximately 350 nm.  
 
The peak-width and peak-height values depend on the 
experimental and image processing parameters such as 
interrogation window size, number of particles, surface 
forces, and image noise level. Therefore, a calibration test to 
estimate the peak-width to peak-height ratio needs to be 
conducted prior to a practical near-wall temperature 
measurement.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
 The feasibility of near-wall thermometry using 
evanescent wave illumination, or nano-particle image 
thermometry (nPIT), was investigated. Monte Carlo 
simulation was used to generate artificial nPIT images of the 
Brownian motion of fluorescent particle tracers in a stationary 
fluid with exponentially decaying illumination intensity from 
the wall. The results of simulations show that the cross-
correlation peak-width increases while the peak-height 
decreases with increasing fluid temperature. The peak width-
to-height ratio is determined to be the parameter of choice for 
quantifying temperature using the nPIT technique. Although 
higher temperature sensitivity was observed with larger inter-
frame time delays, smaller time delays are preferred due to 
lower uncertainty values. Experiments were conducted, and 
the results were compared to the simulation results. The 
reduction in fluorescent intensity values with increasing 
temperature was observed to be significant and cannot be 
neglected in the Brownian-based thermometry using 
fluorescence particle tracers. The experimental results show a 
maximum uncertainty of ± 2.5°C in the temperature 
measurement with an out-of-plane measurement depth of 
approximately 350 nm from the wall. In addition, the 
objective-based 
near-wall 
thermometric 
method 
was 
imperfect at higher temperatures due to the changes in the 
optical characteristics of the imaging setup. 
 This work presents the application of Brownian motion 
analysis for near-wall thermometry in a stationary fluid. 
However, real applications often have fluid flow in the 
system. Detailed analysis for near-wall thermometry in the 
evanescent wave region together with velocimetry has not yet 
been reported. When there is no flow, the cross-correlation 
function (of image pairs) has similar widths in both the x and 
y directions. However, with the flow, the width in one 
direction of the flow will be different from the width 
perpendicular to it. The effect caused by the variation in 
temperature needs to be detected by further analyzing 
additional effects of the particle convection due to the fluid 
flow on the cross-correlation function [29]. In the future, we 
intend to conduct experimental studies on this aspect. In 
addition, in the present work fluorescent particles with a mean 
diameter of 100nm was only considered, as it was optimal for 
the measurement system. The effect of particle size 
distribution on near-wall thermometry was not investigated 
and would be an important factor to be considered for further 
studies.
