Abstract—Thalamus is the relay station for most sensory 
information between peripheral receptors and the cortical areas. 
There is cumulative evidence showing that thalamus actively 
gates information flow. An important issue about this role is that 
thalamus adjusts its response mode according to the sensory 
information arrived. The corticothalamic feedback signal has 
been suggested to be essential for such adjustment. In this paper, 
we pieced together the experimental evidence in a realistic multi-
layer network model of the thalamocortical circuit and examined 
its behavior in response to sinusoidal inputs. The results 
reproduced the burst/tonic responsive modes and feedback 
signal’s role in mode transition.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
While sensory signals are detected in peripheral receptors, 
cortical processing of such signals is responsible for the 
perceptual experience. On the passage from periphery to 
cortex, there is the relay station of thalamus. Cumulating 
evidence has shown that the relay function of thalamus is not 
simply “passing by” but active processing. This processing is 
modulated by various inputs to thalamus other than those 
from the peripheral sensory organs. These inputs, including 
those from cerebral cortex and brainstem, modulate the 
thalamic nuclei’s state and control their gating properties in 
neuronal information processing. 
Since 1990s, the thalamic relay cells have been shown to 
exhibit two distinct modes, burst and tonic, in responding to 
the sensory inputs [3]. Neurons in burst mode are shown to 
be more efficient in signal detection and found mostly when 
the animal is in drowsy or sleeping state. In contrast, in tonic 
mode neurons have higher fidelity in signal transmission and 
tonic mode is related to alert and behaving states. The 
transition between burst and tonic modes is suggested to be 
dependent on the recent membrane potential history before 
the coming of sensory information. Based on such results 
and the reciprocal connection between thalamic relay nuclei 
and their related cortical areas, there emerges the “wake-up 
call” hypothesis that the feedback information from cerebral 
cortex can switch the relay cells from burst mode to tonic 
mode by depolarization. This hypothesis is attracting since it 
offers a versatile transfer function dealing with various 
stimuli and brain states like a self-adapting filter. The 
evidence supporting this hypothesis is still being gathered 
and in need of tidying up. Murray Sherman and his 
colleagues have illustrated the kinetics of low threshold 
calcium channel (IT) [4] and shown that it may contribute to 
the transition between burst and tonic modes of thalamic 
relay cells in an integrate-and-fire-or-burst model [5].  
Based on their work, we want to test the “wake-up call” 
hypothesis in a multi-layered network with integrate-and-
fire-or-burst neurons. The model is focused on the 
interaction between thalamus and cortex. Neocortex is 
composed of 6 layers in which layer IV and layer VI receive 
thalamic inputs. While the signal to layer IV are passed 
through layer II/III, layer V, and then to higher thalamic 
nuclei and brainstem, layer VI sends feedback afferent to the 
thalamic relay nuclei from which it receives input. Given this 
specific connection of layer VI and our simulation resource 
limit, we omitted the cortical layers other than layer VI and 
higher thalamic nuclei from our current model. Our results 
showed that feedback is essential in controlling the relay 
cells’ mode transition. We also explored the input 
frequency’s role in shaping the stimulation-response mode 
relationship and proposed that this supports that the mode 
transition is essential in controlling the animal states. 
In the contribution below, we first introduce the network 
structure of our model, then list parameters employed in the 
simulation, and finally show simulation results about the 
network 
under 
various 
stimulation 
paradigm. 
The 
significance of the results is discussed finally.  
II. 
METHODS 
A. Network structure 
The network comprises two layers, one thalamic and one 
cortical. There were five populations in thalamic layer, 
resembling cells in a barrel-like structure of relay nucleus, 
with various tuning on stimulation features, such as 
directions and velocity of whisker reflection. Each relay cell 
population (resting potential, Vrelay) was reciprocally and 
specifically connected with a neuron population in the 
cortical layer. The reciprocal connection was assigned 
according to the anatomical features of layer VI excitatory 
neurons (resting potential, Vpyr), which offer the corticofugal 
feedback signals [6]. The specific one-to-one connection was 
assigned since the stimulation features are preserved in the 
thalamocortical projections. There was a representative 
homogenous population of layer VI inhibitory interneuron, 
basket cell (resting potential, Vbask), in the cortical layer. 
According to Swadlow et al [7], the thalamocortical inputs to 
46

the layer IV interneurons are divergent and convergent, 
blurring the stimulation features. Similarly we assigned layer 
VI inhibitory interneuron with inputs from all thalamic relay 
cells and outputs to all cortical excitatory cells, sharing the 
same number with thalamic cells. The 1 from 6 ratio of 
inhibitory interneurons is near the general proportion, 
20~30 % in cerebral cortex [8].  
B. The integrate-and-fire-or-burst model  
The neurons in our network were described by the 
integrate-and-fire-or-burst (IFB) model taken from [5] and 
[9]. The IFB model was constructed by adding a slow 
variable to a classical integrate-and-fire neuron model. The 
neuronal model contains two equations, one for voltage and 
one for calcium current:  

C×dV/dt=－IL－IT－IS－ID 

dh/dt=－h/h
－, if V≥Vh ; 
 (1－h)/h
+, if VVh 

where IL =gL×(V－VL) is a constant conductance leakage 
current, IT is the low threshold Ca2+ current, and IS and ID are 
two synaptic currents. An action potential occurred 
whenever the membrane potential reaches the firing 
threshold (Vtheta). There was an absolute refractory period τrp 
(4 ms) during which the voltage of neurons remains at Vreset. 
The low-threshold Ca2+ current was described as IT= gT×m∞
× h × (V － VT), where m ∞ = (V － Vh) represents 
instantaneous voltage-dependent activation, and  is the 
Heaviside step function. 
The input to the network was as following: (1) simulation 
begins with a pre-cue time interval lasting for 500 ms, during 
which the network receives only noise and will exhibit 
spontaneous activity; (2) in the stimulus presentation period, 
the input of sinusoidal current I0+II*sin(f) lasted for 5000 ms 
was applied to the thalamic cells besides for noises from 
outside.  
C. Synaptic input 
The last two terms in (1), IS and ID, were synaptic 
currents attributable to excitatory spontaneous input and 
excitatory or inhibitory drive. Each synaptic potential 
received by the neuron in the network was modeled as an  
function [10] of conductance. An individual EPSP occurring 
at t =0 would be given by:   
             (s) = q/τs×exp(－s/τs)× (s)                    (3) 
where q is the total charge that is injected in a postsynaptic 
neuron via a synapse with efficacy wij = 1. More realistically, 
the postsynaptic current  should have a finite duration, e.g., 
as in the case of an exponential decay with time constant τs. 
As usual,  is the Heaviside step function with  (s) = 1 for 
s > 0 and  (s) = 0 else.  
All calculations were performed using the Matlab 
program and a time step of 0.1 ms.  
D. Cellular and synaptic parameters 
These parameters were collected from several sources 
and listed below, as table 1, 2, and 3.

RESULTS 
A. Burst and tonic modes in relay cells 
We thoroughly tested the model’s response to several 
sets of parameters including baseline current, amplitude of 
sinusoidal 
inputs 
and 
sinusoidal 
frequency. 
Two 
representative results are showed in Figure 1a and 1b. The 
baseline current strongly determines the response mode of 
relay cells, consistent with Sherman et al’s results that the 
low and high baseline current lead to burst and tonic mode, 
respectively. 
B. Frequency dependency of mode transition 
The whole sets of results are shown in Figure 2. For both 
low baseline situations with (Figure 2a) and without 
feedback (Figure 2b), the response mode transition is 
dependent on input frequency. At both situations, the 
emergence of burst mode response from originally silent 
cells are relatively transiently as the stimulus increases for 
the high frequency stimulation and smoothly for the low

a. The stimuli are I = I0 + I1cos(2πf) 
frequency stimulation. The transition from burst mode to 
tonic mode happens at stimuli higher than 1 μA*cm-2, but 
not for all stimulation frequencies. Figure 2c is the high 
baseline situation with or without feedback. 
C. Feedback connection shapes the mode Transition  
The burst-tonic transition was essential to the “wake-up call”, 
suggesting that the feedback signal was playing its role and 
the relay cells were switched into the high fidelity 
transferring mode from the high-efficacy detecting mode. 
For 5 Hz and 25 Hz stimuli with low baseline, the burst-tonic 
mode transition happens only if there is the feedback 
connection. For the 0.25 Hz stimuli with low baseline the

feedback connections while the high baseline situation is resistant to it. (a, 
b) the response modes of relay cells with or without feedback connections 
to low baseline stimuli. (c) the response modes of relay cells to high 
baseline stimuli.  
stimulation-response mode relationship was not strongly 
dependent on the existence of feedback connection. The high 
baseline stimuli raised the relay cells already to tonic mode, 
so the relay cells were mostly resistant to remove of 
feedback connections. The 1 Hz stimuli with high baseline 
showed unique feature that the burst-tonic mode transition 
was evoked when the stimuli was up to 0.9 μA*cm-2. 
D. IT current is underlying the transition 
To verify the essential role of low threshold calcium 
channel we compared the mode transition graph and the 
activation states of IT. Since the activation states of IT is 
governed by membrane potential and the slow variable h, 
and the time constant of h is invariable, we plotted the 
duration length in which h is positive. m∞= (V－Vh), and 
 (*) is the Heaviside step function. Consistent with the 
physiological result, the active periods were mostly about 
100 ms when the stimuli are capable of evoking burst-tonic 
transition. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION  
Although the model is really simple and incomplete, the 
essential role of feedback is significant. To incorporate more 
components, especially the reticular nucleus and cortical 
columnar constructions should make the model more 
concrete and more precise in temporal structure. The 
feedforward inhibition is proposed to be efficient in shaping 
the receptive field spatially and temporally. Since it is 
incorporated in the model, it is possible to study that in the 
multi-layered neuronal network instead of in pure 
feedforward triad. In fact there has been work on this idea 
[20].  
The stimuli frequencies are related to different brain 
states: 0.25 Hz are slow waves related with drowsiness and 
slow-wave sleep, 1 Hz are δ-wave related with slow-wave 
sleep, 5 Hz are θ-wave related with certain behavioral 
activities, and 25 Hz are α-wave related with restful 
attentiveness [21]. The slow-wave and δ-wave are related 
with similar brain states, and so are the δ-wave and θ-wave. 
Consistently, stimuli of the former two frequencies evoke 
similar response mode and show similar response to the 
existence of feedback connections. Similar comparison 
applies to the later two. This offers us a new point of view to 
consider the role of feedback connections. The burst-tonic 
transition in feedback-removed relay cells to low frequency 
stimuli may reflect the higher sensitivity to silent signals 
during the drowsy states. 
Because the neuronal model of this work is a single-
compartmental model, there is a limitation that some results may 
not expand to situations involving temporally or spatially patterned 
synaptic input distributed over dendritic arbors. Nevertheless, this 
kind of single-compartmental model is appropriate in some 
situations, and the statistics for the stochastic responses is satisfied. 
However, a model with multi-compartment may have more fruitful 
results.
