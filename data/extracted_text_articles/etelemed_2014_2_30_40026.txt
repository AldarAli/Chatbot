I.
INTRODUCTION
Depression and impaired quality of life (QoL) are major
problems in patients with heart failure, and exposure to
these factors is much higher compared with a community
dwelling or age-matched population [1][2][3]. Depression
due to a general medical condition is defined as a patient’s
clinical presentation, which is dominated by a persisting
mood disorder, characterized by either or both depressed
mood or considerably decreased interest or pleasure in
nearly all activities, or a mood that is elevated, expansive or
irritable [4]. Also, other cardiac conditions, such as atrial
fibrillation, are known to show elevated levels of depression
and anxiety [5]. QoL is multidimensional and integrates
objective and subjective indicators, a broad range of life
domains,
and
individual
values.
Dimensions
may
be
categorized in physical, material, social and emotional well
being, and activity [6]. Both, depression and poor emotional
QoL, can be predicted by Type-D [7][8][9]. Type-D
personality
is
defined
as
‘the
tendency
to
suppress
emotional distress’, and is a predictor of long-term mortality
in
Chronic
Heart
Disease
(CHD),
independently
of
established biomedical risk factors [10].
With the increased application of telemonitoring in heart
failure, knowledge about its effects on QoL, and depression
becomes highly important. Several telemonitoring studies
reported about the impact of telemonitoring on QoL
[11][12][13][14], yet limited studies reported about the
impact of telemonitoring on depression in patients with
heart failure [15][16]. Preliminary results, about the impact
on depression, during the first 3 months of the randomized
multicentre study discussed in this article (TEHAF-study),
showed a tendency to a decreased level of depression [17].
The TEHAF-study primarily focuses on the effects of
telemonitoring on heart failure (re)admissions and mortality
[18], and cost-effectiveness [19]. Secondary outcomes are:
disease
specific
knowledge,
self-care,
self-efficacy,
adherence, [20] depression, and QoL. It was hypothesized
that an intensive follow-up by means of telemonitoring (i.e.
the Health Buddy®) improves disease specific knowledge,
self-care
and
self-efficacy,
which
in
turn,
positively
influences QoL and reduces depression and anxiety.
Several generations of telemonitoring (TM) are known.
The Health Buddy® system, used in this study, is a first
generation telehealth device, meaning a non-reactive data
collection and analysis system. Measurements of interest are
collected,
and
transferred
to
the
care
provider
asynchronously. It is not a full telemedicine system, and the
provider cannot respond immediately to patient data.
Second generation systems have a non-immediate analytical
or decision-making structure. Data transfer is synchronous,
meaning there is some real time processing of patient data.
Care providers can recognise important changes in essential
measurements, but delays can occur if the systems are only
active during office hours. Third generation systems provide
constantly analytical and decision-making support. Such
systems are used by physician led centers, staffed by
specialist nurses, and have full therapeutic authority 24 h
per day, seven days per week [21].
The current article presents longitudinal one-year follow-
up
results
regarding
the
impact
of
first
generation
telemonitoring on depression and QoL scores, including the
presence of Type-D in patients with heart failure. In the
methods section the population, study design, measurement
instruments, sample size and data analysis are described.

effects on QoL, anxiety and depression, and the relation
between QoL, and anxiety and depression are presented in
the results part, followed by the discussion, including study
limitations, practical implications and conclusion.
II. METHODS
A. Population
To
compare
telemonitoring
with
usual
care,
870
consecutive patients with heart failure New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class II-IV were invited to participate
in the TEHAF-study, during their visit at the outpatient
clinic of either of three hospitals in the South of the
Netherlands, of whom 488 refused or were ineligible (figure
1) flowchart). Patients were asked to fill out several
questionnaires during study time [22], and were informed
that refusing participation had no consequences for their
further treatment. Heart failure was defined as at least, one
episode of fluid retention requiring diuretics, either with an
echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% or
a preserved ejection fraction with diastolic dysfunction.
Further inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, capable of
providing informed consent, and being treated by a heart-
failure nurse together with a cardiologist. Patients were
excluded if, operating the telemonitoring device i.e., the
Health-Buddy®, was physically or cognitively impracticable;
if suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD)
Gold-classification
3
or
4;
if
receiving
hemodialysis, or in case of a disease with an expectedly
shortened life span [22]. Approval was obtained from the
Medical Ethical Committee of the participating centers,
according to the declaration of Helsinki [23] and written
informed consent was obtained before randomization. The
TEHAF-study
is
registered
as
a
clinical
randomized
controlled trial [24].
B.
Study design
From October 2007 until December 2008, 382 patients
were enrolled and assigned to a study arm, usual care (UC
group) or usual care plus telemonitoring (TM group), using
a
computer-generated
randomization
procedure,
with
stratification per center. Patients of both groups received
treatment according to
the
European guidelines [25],
identical oral and written information, and had an easy
access to the heart failure nurse. Patients of the UC group
four, and patients of the TM group had two planned
outpatient clinic visits during follow-up.
Moreover, the
latter group received a telemonitoring device. The Health
Buddy® has a liquid crystal display and four keys and was
connected to a landline phone. Every day, a preset dialogue
was
communicated
about
symptoms,
knowledge
and
behavior, being answered by touching one of the keys.
Patients’ answers were sent via a protected server to the
nurses’ desktop. Incorrect answers to a knowledge or
behavior issue were automatically corrected by the device
and visualized in the display, aiming that patients’ disease
knowledge would increase. Responses were transferred into
risk profiles, (low, medium, high) [21] allowing the nurse to
quickly identify high-risk patients. A heart failure nurse and
a nurse assistant led the process. Positive answers for
symptoms triggered immediate responses by the heart
failure nurse. The nurse assistant was responsible for
educational and general high risks, such as symptoms of
depression [21]. To meet with personal specific needs on
treatment or education, patients could be allocated to one of
the four sets of dialogues with variable emphasis on
symptoms or knowledge and behavior [20]. All patients
started with the same initial set of dialogues, which was
evenly balanced for symptoms and education. After three
months the first evaluation of symptoms and education level
occurred, with the intention to continue with the best fitting
next set of dialogues. Evaluation was based on the number
of high-risk alerts during the last 30 days before the end of a
program. Beside this, re-allocation to maintain with the best
fitting dialogues set was possible at any moment [21].
Following an admission for heart failure, patients were
always re-allocated to an intensive symptom monitoring set
of dialogues. Monitoring of vital signs was not part of the
system.
C.
Measurement instruments
Demographic variables (age, gender, race, living situa-
tion) and clinical variables NYHA functional class, left
ventricular ejection fraction, ischemic heart disease, atrium
fibrillation (AF), type-D personality) were measured. This
article reports effects on QoL scores, measured by the
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)[26],
and depression scores, measured by the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS) [27]. The DS-14 consists of
14 questions, measuring negative affectivity and social
inhibition. Scores ranged on a Likert scale from 0-4 points.
Type D personality was indicated if both scores were equal
or more than 10 points [28]. QoL was measured by the
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). This
is
a
23-item
questionnaire
that
quantifies
physical
limitations (question 1), symptoms (frequency [questions 3,
5, 7 and 9], severity [questions 4, 6 and 8] and recent change
over
time
[question
2]),
self-efficacy and
knowledge
(questions 11, 12), social interference (question 16) and
QoL (questions 13–15). To facilitate interpretability, two
summary scores were developed, the overall summary score
(OVS) and clinical summary score (CSS), which are built
up from different (sub) scores [25]. The OVS exists of the
physical limitation score, total symptom score, quality of
life score and the social limitation score; the CSS exists of
physical limitation score and the total symptom score. The
HADS, measuring anxiety and depression, is a 14 items
questionnaire consisting of 7 questions for both, depression
and anxiety. Scores are ranged on a 4-points Likert scale,
with a total score range between 0-21 points [27]. Cut-off
point for anxiety or depression disorder is 10 points and
higher.

D.
Sample size
The sample size of the TEHAF-study was built on the
number of hospitalizations for heart failure. Expected was a
50% reduction in heart failure admissions [22].
E.
Data analysis
Demographic
interval
and
ratio
variables
were
investigated for normality of distribution with the Shapiro-
Wilk Normality Test. If normally distributed, means and
standard deviations are given. Student-t and Mann-Whitney
test is used to estimate differences of baseline variables.
Student-t test is also used to assess differences between AF
and anxiety and depression scores, and AF and QoL.
Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and
percentages.
Correlations between type-D, and anxiety and depression
scores or QoL, and between anxiety and depression scores
and quality of life, were tested by the Pearson correlation
test. Chi-square is used to assess differences for type-D
personality between the usual care and telemonitoring
groups. Student-t test is used to assess differences between
type-D personality and QoL and depression. The effects
between groups on QoL, and anxiety and depression scores
in time (baseline, T3, T6, T12) were assessed with
generalized estimating equations analysis (GEE).
GEE was used to correct for the dependency of the
observations in time and for the difference of the time
periods between the follow-up measurements. A structured
covariance matrix was used in the GEE analysis.

As independent variables three dummy variables for
time, group (usual care versus intervention), and interaction
effects between group and the dummy variables of time
were included. The method of GEE is often used to analyze
longitudinal and other correlated response data [29]. GEE
takes into account the correlational nature of repeated
measures data within subjects, and securing minimal loss of
patients due to incomplete data. Data imputation is not
executed because when using GEE to analyze a longitudinal
dataset, imputation of missing data has no value above non-
imputation [29]. Analyses were corrected for baseline
differences. To analyze within group effects between
baseline and after 12 months regarding QoL, anxiety and
depression scores, Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used.
SPSS version 18 was used for all data analyses. P-values <
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
III. RESULTS
A.
Baseline characterisctics
Three hundred eighty two patients met the criteria, and
were allocated to the TM group (197) or to the UC group
(185). Patients’ mean age was 72 (±11), and 46% were ≥75
years old; 59% were male, 65 % lived with a partner; 57%
were in functional class II, 40% in Class III 3% in class IV.
Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.38 and 61%
were ≤ 0.45; 50% had ischemic heart disease. Study arms
were well balanced regarding baseline characteristics (table
1), except for AF. No differences were found for anxiety
and depression, or QoL among patients with AF or other
heart rhythm. Follow up was incomplete in 81 (21%), 43 in
the usual-care and 38 in the intervention arm, due to death
(7.8%), increasing physical impairment (6.0%), stress or
losing motivation (5%), other (1%) or lost to follow-up
(1.2%).
B.
Prevalance of type-D personality
Respectively 184 and 176 patients answered the DS-14
questionnaire for the type-D personality. No difference in
prevalence of type-D personality was found between the
groups. In the TM group 67 (36.4%) and in the UC group 68
(39.8%) of the patients belongs to the category with type-D
personality. Overall, no correlation was found between type-
D-personality and anxiety (p=0.681, Pearson= -.022) or
depression (p=0.443, Pearson=0.041) scores, whereas all
dimensions of QoL (p<0.001) were negatively affected by
type-D without differences between study groups.
C.
Effects on anxiety and depression scores
No
difference
was
found
regarding
depression
prevalence at baseline, with a registration of 42% (79
on186) in the TM group and 41% (69 on 167) in the UC
group. A significant difference for anxiety in favour of the
TM group was found after 3 and 6 months, irrespective of
correction for baseline values (Table 2). However, this
effect disappeared after 12 months. For depression a
significant different effect was found only after six months
in favour of the TM group. After correction for the baseline
values, a favourable effect was found during whole follow-
up.
Also for anxiety and depression scores, within group
differences were calculated among patients completing
questionnaires at baseline and after 12 months. After 12
months anxiety was significantly lower in the TM group
(p=0.041, Z=2.043), whereas no difference was found for
and no difference for anxiety (p=0.229, Z= -1.203).
D.
Effects on quality of life
Uncorrected for baseline value, the OVS and the CSS
tend to differ between the TM group and the UC group after
one year, yet no difference remained after correction for
From
patients
completing
the
KCCQ-questionnaire
at
baseline and after 12 months (272) within group differences
were calculated. No within group difference was found for
the
CSS.
For
OVS
significantly
higher
score
was
demonstrated in the TM group (p=0.022, Z= -2. 290),
whereas no difference was found for the UC group
(p=0.790, Z=-.267). QoL, being a sub score of the OVS,
showed similar changes, with p= 0.002 (Z= -3.149)
compared to p=0.239 (Z= -1.178), respectively for the TM
group and the UC group. For the sub-score self-efficacy a
significant improvement was found for both groups with
p<0.001 and p=0.028, respectively for the TM group and the
UC group.
E.
Quality of life and depression
For both groups, a negative correlation was found
between the sub-score of QoL and depression (p=0.025,
Pearson - 115) and QoL and anxiety (p=0.036, Pearson -
.107), meaning that the presence of anxiety as well as
depression
is
related
to
lower
QoL.
No
significant
correlation between anxiety and depression scores and OVS
or CSS was found.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this study it was found that telemonitoring positively
influences depression and anxiety scores, meaning that
telemonitored patients were less depressed during whole
follow-up, and less anxious at 3 and 6 months after the start
of the study. The difference in depression indicates that
telemonitoring seems to slightly decrease patients’ moods.
Our finding of 42% depressed patients was comparable
with the prevalence range of 9% to 54% in a Caucasian
population as reported in a recent meta-analysis [3]. Mean
depression level of all patients at baseline was slightly
higher compared to the preliminary results in 101 patients
investigated at 3 months after start of the study. However,
the same course is demonstrated for the results after 3
months, being a slight decrease of depression scores in the
38

TM group and stable level of depression scores in the UC
group [17]. Initially, positive results were found for QoL,
yet after correction for baseline differences disappeared.
The effects on the self-efficacy were congruent with the
self-efficacy
findings
described
elsewhere
[20].
Telemonitoring
improves
the
communication
between
patient and health care professional; this may result in an
increased
self-efficacy.
The
TEHAF-study
primarily
focused on the effects of telemonitoring on heart failure
(re)admissions,
mortality,
and
cost-effectiveness.
No
significant differences were found for hospitalizations and
mortality, yet the number of contacts with the heart failure
nurse
was
significantly
lower
for
patients
using
telemonitoring. Sub-analysis showed differences for some
sub-groups, as living with partner and heart failure duration
less than 18 months [18]. No difference between groups was
found for costs, however sub-group analyses showed that
telemonitoring is more effective in patients with heart
failure duration less than 18 months [19]. Also, a significant
improvement was found for knowledge and self-care, and
for some domains of adherence [20].
Myers [12] performed a non-randomised study with a
follow-up time of 2 months and compared the results of 83
telemonitored patients with historical patients receiving
usual care. Reported results included pre- and post-test
results of the telemonitoring group, measured by the Short
Form 36 item health survey (SF-36). They found an
improved QoL in seven of the parameters, yet could not
determine whether the change was directly related to
telemonitoring. The results of the current study may
considered
to
be
due
to
telemonitoring
because
characteristics
of
patients
were
comparable,
type-D
personality included, and correction for baseline values was
performed. Noteworthy in the study of Myers [12] was the
relative high number of patients (n=19) not completing the
short study in 2 months. Seven patients (37%) withdrew
while they were anxious and upset, which is in contrast with
our study with a withdrawal rate of 18% during the follow-
up of one year. Benatar [11] followed patients for 3 months
and compared the outcomes of 216 patients receiving home
nurse
visits
versus
nurse
telemanagement.
QoL
was
measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and depression with the HADS.
They found improved QoL for both groups when compared
pre- en post-intervention, yet no differences between
groups. This finding implies that telemonitoring has the
same effect on QoL as face-to-face contacts between patient
and care professional.
Depression scores showed an improvement between
groups in favour of the telemonitoring group comparable
with our study results. Goldberg e.a. [30] provided 138
patients, with a mean age of 59 years (unpublished standard
deviation), for 6 months with a telemonitoring system of the
second generation, existing of an electronic scale and
individualised questions about symptoms; almost 75% of
the patients were in NYHA class III. No significant effects
in QoL were measured within groups, however in the
telemonitoring group QoL trended towards improvement.
No difference between groups was described. Within 48
hours post discharge, Woodend et al. [31] equipped 121
patients with heart failure with a telemonitoring system.
Mean age was 66 (±11) years and most patients were in
NYHA class III. The intervention consisted of 3 months
video conferencing with a nurse, daily transmission of
weight and blood pressure, and periodic transmission of 12-
lead electrocardiogram. Measurements were performed at
baseline, after 3 and 12 months. Conferences between nurse
and patient were more frequent in the first few weeks after
discharge. QoL was measured with the SF-36. For both
groups QoL improved significantly after one year. Between
groups
a
significant
difference
in
favor
of
the
videoconference
group
was
found
after
3
months,
disappearing after one year. This may be interpreted as
telemonitoring having effects during the monitoring time,
yet effects were disappearing on the longer term. This may
suggest that patients may continuously need the system to
retain the effects on QoL. Unfortunately, authors did not
report which care was delivered after the 3 months of
videoconference, which in this context is an important issue.
The most principal differences with our study were the
post discharge inclusion and the six-year younger mean age
which both independently may have influenced the results.
Another multi-centre randomised trial is studied [13] with a
follow-up of 6 months in 315 patients. Mean age was 76.5
(±7) years and 60% were female. QoL was measured by the
SF-36 and the KCCQ. No differences between groups were
found for SF-36 neither for the KCCQ. Koehler [32] et al.
provided 354 patients, mean age 67 (±10.7) years, with a
telemonitoring device of the third generation telehealth and
followed them for 24 months. They investigated QoL with
the SF-36 questionnaire and depression with the Patient
Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ9). No effects were found
for depression, and an overall benefit was found for one of
the QoL subscales, the first being in contrast with our
effects on depression. The Whole System Demonstrator
telehealth trial [33] included 1,650 patients with COPD,
diabetes or heart failure in 365 general practices, in four
primary care trusts in the United Kingdom. Patients were
followed
with
second-generation
telehealth
devices.
Measurements were performed at baseline, after 4 and 12
months. QoL was measured by the SF-12 and EQ-5D
questionnaires, anxiety by the brief state-trait anxiety
inventory
(STAI)
and
depression
by
the
center
for
epidemiological
studies-depression
scale
CESD-10.
Analysing the data, no disease specific distinctions were
made. No differences were found for QoL, neither for
anxiety or depression scores.
As mentioned earlier, the Health Buddy® system is a
telemonitoring system from the first generation. Several
devices belonging to the first, second and third generations
are discussed above. No structurally improved effects on
QoL or depression have been found in studies using higher
39

generation devices. Despite this is not the focus of our
study, one may remark that the increased possibilities due to
the evolution of telemonitoring systems has shown to lack
influence regarding the effects on QoL and depression. At
the other hand, underutilization of telemonitoring may occur
due to a lacking clarity about the best fitting program for
individual patients and equally so that the caregivers are
lacking experience in using telemonitoring [34].
V. LIMITATIONS
The power of this study was calculated on a reduction of
hospitalizations. Therefore, this study may be insufficiently
powered to detect differences in QoL. Besides, 21% of our
study population did not finish the study. The follow-up
time
of
12
months
may
be
insufficient
to
realize
improvements in QoL and depression scores. This study
was performed to detect differences between groups. If
within-group differences were found without significant
different
between
groups,
they
are
not
necessarily
attributable to the kind of care delivery. The use of standard
questions by researchers can lead to "structural bias" and
false representation, where the data actually reflect the view
of the researcher instead of the participating subject
[35][36][37]. Preset answers will not necessarily reflect how
people really feel about a subject and in some cases might
just be the closest match to preconceived hypotheses. As a
consequence, the results of a quantitative questionnaire
design may be statistically significant but at risk to be
practically insignificant and their clinical relevance may be
unclear, especially in aspects as quality of life and
depression [35][36][37].
VI. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY
The Health Buddy® system has shown to reduce anxiety
for a short term and to control depression. Therefore, it may
be useful to apply telemonitoring to anxious patients to
reduce
anxiety and
to
control
depression.
This
may
particularly be meaningful for patients waiting for a referral
to a professional or a mental health caregiver.
The finding that type-D personality influences QoL
resonates the need of defining personality in order to detect
it as a risk factor for diminished QoL [13][14][16].
Telemonitoring systems should be improved in their
ability to pay attention for anxiety and depression, and
integrate in depth dialogues or guidance how to deal with
depressive symptoms or anxiety. This may easily enhance
the positive effects of telemonitoring and alleviate the
burden on patients and their environment, on health care
resources and costs.
VII. CONCLUSION
The
Health
Buddy®
system
focusing
on
patients’
experiences has proven to be suitable to positively influence
some aspects of QoL, to reduce patients’ depression and to
reduce
patients’
anxiety
scores
in
the
short
run.
Furthermore, it was found that QoL is negatively affected
by the presence of Type-D personality, and that depression
and
anxiety
negatively
affect
the
sub
score
QoL.
