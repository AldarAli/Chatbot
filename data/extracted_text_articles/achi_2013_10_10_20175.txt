Abstract—The objective of this study is to evaluate the 
effectiveness, usability and satisfaction of conventional devices, 
Nintendo Wii and XaviX, on upper extremity rehabilitation 
patients in Taiwan, and to summarize a guideline for 
improvement design of such devices. Twelve stroke patients 
were divided in three groups: (1) Conventional, (2) Wii, (3) 
XaviX groups. Eight senior occupational therapists were 
interviewed about the usage problems and additional needs 
related to the use of these devices. The results show that Wii 
and XaviX could be equivalent to conventional rehabilitation 
devices for improving upper extremity motor functions. All 
patients in this clinical trial were satisfied with using the digital 
gaming devices for rehabilitation. The suggestions for 
improvement design in game devices are as follows. For the 
software interface devices: (a) To increase difficulty and the 
response time levels of the games need adjustment, (b) To 
record movement data and game scores each time, some device 
for recording is needed, and (c) The games need a Chinese 
version of the software interface. For the hardware design: (a) 
The hand controller must be interchangeable for the users, (b) 
The controller should be adjustable to fit different hand 
dimensions of the patients, (c) The game and controller 
movements need to be designed to correspond to real-life 
activities, and (d) The controller's operation needs to be 
simplified. These proposed guidelines would be necessary in 
order to embody design improvements of the devices.

INTRODUCTION 
The current clinical upper extremity rehabilitation 
devices are mostly static and provide no feedback to the 
patients [1]. Patients easily feel bored while repeating the 
same activity, hence generating a negative attitude toward 
the therapy process [2][3][4]. In order to increase mental 
satisfaction and physical vitality in rehabilitation therapy, 
some therapists have tried to use the existing commercial 
digital game devices (CDGD)in rehabilitation and have 
found effective treatment outcomes in addition to enhancing 
the patient’s treatment motivation [3][5][6]. 
There are already many studies focused on digital game 
devices in rehabilitation such as Wii [2][3][5][6][8], 
Playstation EyeToy [5][8] and Kinect [4]. For example, a 
study examined the feasibility and safety of the Wii gaming 
system and compared it with recreational therapy in 
facilitating motor function of the upper extremity [7]. The 
results showed that Wii gaming technology represents a safe, 
feasible, and potentially effective way to facilitate 
rehabilitation therapy and promote motor recovery after 
stroke. However, some of Wii’s disadvantages were that 
stroke patients found the control of the handset buttons 
difficult and frustrating to use; however, this obligatory hand 
use improved gross motor dexterity. Stroke patients did not 
simply play Wii sports, rather the device was used as a 
rehabilitation tool with targeted and movement goals aimed 
at reinforcing appropriate and coordinated motor patterns [6]. 
These existing devices are originally designed for 
entertainment with normal people with healthy physical and 
action conditions, not intended for rehabilitation therapy 
purposes or for people with physical disabilities [5]. Further 
confirmation and evaluation is necessary to see if a digital 
game device can really meet the user’s usability needs in 
addition to its rehabilitation effectiveness. Usability testing is 
a method used to determine how easy a device is to use and 
to identify issues that must be addressed in order to improve 
the design and functionality of the device [9]. However, the 
usability of such devices for rehabilitation remains relatively 
rare [5]. 
Nintendo Wii and XaviX have been tested in clinical 
rehabilitation in several hospitals in Taiwan. However, 
whether the superiority of Virtual Reality systems can 
facilitate conventional therapy currently in use remains to be 
determined [2][10][11]. Further development is required to 
ensure that these devices are easy for patients and therapists 
to set up in a clinic and/or home setting [5]. Therefore, this 
study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, usability and 
satisfaction of using Wii and XaviX in rehabilitation for 
stroke patients and for the occupational therapists, and to 
summarize a guideline for improvement design of such 
devices.  
In the following sections, the methods applied and results 
obtained will be described respectively, and then implication 
of the results will be discussed, followed by a brief section of 
conclusion and future work.  
II. METHODS 
A pilot and double-blind clinical trial was implemented 
to evaluate the effectiveness between conventional devices, 
Wii, and XaviX in rehabilitation. In addition, the usability 
and satisfaction of using Wii and XaviX in rehabilitation 
were also assessed by stroke patients and occupational 
therapists.

A. effectiveness evaluation 
1) 
Subjects. Stroke patients were recruited from the 
occupational therapy department of Chung Shan Medical 
University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were the following: (a) 
Hemiparetic with upper extremity dysfunction following a 
single unilateral stroke, (b) a history of first-time stroke (3-
48 months post stroke, (c) the required upper extremity 
rehabilitation convalescent levels were Brunnstrom stage III 
to IV, i.e., having basic upper extremity synergies to perform 
joint movement voluntarily, (d) ability to communicate, (e) 
able to understand and follow instructions. Exclusion criteria 
were the following: (a) engaged in any other rehabilitation 
program during the study and (b) serious aphasia or 
cognitive impairment. Each patient gave informed consent. 
This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics 
Board of Chung Shan Medical University Hospital. 
2) 
Settings. Conventional equipment, Wii, and XaviX 
were used in this trial (Table I). Each group was assigned to 
use two games or equipment in the additional treatment. The 
games and equipment for the groups were selected by three 
occupational therapists, and were considered as similar in 
training effect on upper extremity movements. For Nintendo 
Wii, two games (boxing and bowling) of Wii Sport were 
selected to use in this trial. As for XaviX, two games 
(bowling and ladder climbing) were selected to use in this 
trial. Ladder climbing contains three levels (easy, normal and 
difficult). While playing bowling, the user needed to hold a 
soft bowling ball, fixed to the hand with a safety belt. In 
ladder climbing, the user needed to wear glove sensors in the 
palms of both hands [13]. Corresponding to the Wii games 
(Bowling and Boxing) and the XaviX games (Bowling and 
Ladder climbing), two conventional equipment were selected 
in this trial. They are the Curamotion exerciser and the 
Climbing board and bar. 
3) 
Functional assessments. Four functional 
assessments were used as follow: 
a)  Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical Performance (FMA) 
[14]. It was used to evaluate the motor functions. The upper 
extremity motor test part with a possible highest score of 66 
was adopted in the evaluation. The reliability of Fugl-Meyer 
Assessment is generally considered reliable [15].  
b) Box and Block Test of Manual Dexterity (BBT). It was 
used to test gross manual dexterity of a patient’s affected 
side [16]. In the test, the patient was asked to move as many 
cubes (of side length of 2.5 cm) as possible using only the 
thumb and index fingers during a timed 60s trial. 
c) The Functional Independence Measure (FIM). This scale 
assesses physical and cognitive disability. The scale includes 
18 items, of which 13 items are physical domains based on 
the Barthel Index and 5 items are cognition items. Each item 
is scored from 1 to 7 based on level of independence, where 
1 represents total dependence and 7 indicates complete 
independence. This measurement was assessed and shown to 
have high reliability and validity [17][18][19]. 
d) Upper extremity range-of-motion (ROM). This is used to 
assess the passive and active range-of-motion on the affected 
side [20]. 
4) 
Duration of intervention. The training comprised 20 
sessions during 2 months, with each session lasting 30 
minutes (excluding set-up time). The effectiveness was 
evaluated before and after completing the 20 training 
sessions. In addition to these trainings (Wii, XaviX, and 
Conventional) in this study, all patients also received at least 
1 hour of occupational therapy and 1 hour of physical 
therapy. 
B. Usability and satisfaction evaluation.  
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was designed 
to evaluate usability and satisfaction of using Nintendo Wii, 
and XaviX. The questionnaire included two parts: 
1)    Usability. Three open-ended questions about device 
set-up, game-playing, and performance feedback were asked 
to the patients for them to answer orally. By these questions, 
we expected to understand the context of use problems 
encountered by the patients. 
2) 
Satisfaction. Three 5-point Likert type questions 
about satisfaction, motivation, and fun were then presented 
on a sheet of paper for the patients to answer. By this trial, 
we expected to understand the patients' satisfaction with 
using the digital gaming devices in clinics. 
C. Usability evaluation by occupational therapists  
Expert interview was conducted to survey the current 
situation of the use of digital game devices and evaluate the 
usability of such devices in upper extremity rehabilitation.  
1) 
Locations. Two hospitals were selected in a 
preliminary investigation: Taipei Veterans General Hospital 
(TVGH) and Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital 
(KVGH). Wii is used in KVGH and Xavix is used in TVGH. 
2) 
Subjects. As a professional, the occupational 
therapist possesses expertise about therapy theory and also 
has abundant experiences, and these are useful for the 
evaluation of rehabilitation devices or the commercial 
products applied in rehabilitation. Selection criteria for the 
interviewed therapists were as follows: at least 5 years work 
experience in occupational therapy, and at least one year 
experience in adopting the digital game device intervention 
in rehabilitation treatment. 
3) 
Contents of the interview. Semi-structured 
interviews were used, which mainly consisted of two parts: 
(a) Therapist personal profile - gender, age, hospital name, 
and work experience in years, and (b) Questions about the 
usability evaluation of the Wii and XaviX. 
D. Observation of the usage of the CDGD in clinics. 
During field observation, the researchers observed the  
process of devices being operated independently by the 
patients or with help of the therapist. From the point of view 
of ergonomic design, the researcher would also take notes of 
usability issues of the devices. 
E. Data analysis. 
The characteristics of the study groups were described as 
mean and SD. Differences in baseline characteristics 
between the three groups were analyzed by One-Way 
ANOVA. Each group was analyzed using paired-samples t-
251

tests for pre- and post-therapy values. For each group, the 
effectiveness index of each functional assessment was 
calculated, that is, the post-test score minus the pre-test score, 
then divided by the maximum possible progress (possible 
highest score of the assessment minus pre-test score) [21]. 
To analyze the interview data from occupational therapists 
and stroke patients, the recording was firstly transcribed 
verbatim. Similar opinions were combined and all unique 
responses were independently itemized for further discussion. 
III. RESULTS 
A. Effectiveness evaluation of stroke patients 
1) 
Characteristics of the stroke patients. Twelve 
consecutively screened stroke patients finally completed the 
trial, with a mean age of 50.42 years (SD=11.20). The 
characteristics of the patients in the three study groups are 
shown in Table II. There are no statistically significant 
differences between the three groups with regard to age, time 
from stroke onset, Brunnstrom stages of affected side, or 
FMA pre-treatment score. 
2) 
Pre and post-gaming for all stroke patients. All 
groups showed statistically significant improvements on the 
FMA, BBT, FIM and 4 items of ROM assessment scales 
from pre-treatment to post-treatment (Table III). 
3) 
Between-group differences in score changes for 
effectiveness index. The results show that effectiveness 
index of each group had improvements for arm functions in 
stroke patients on FMA, FIM and ROM, but there was no 
statistically significant improvement among the three groups 
(Table IV). For the FMA results, the Xavix group had a 
better effectiveness index score than the Conventional and 
Wii groups.

B. Usability and satisfaction evaluation.  
1) 
Characteristics of the interviewed occupational 
therapists. Eight therapists were selected and interviewed, 
three (one male [A] and two females [B, C]) were from 
KVGH and five (two males [D, E] and three females [F, G, 
H]) were from TVGH. They had an average age of 35.1 yrs 
(SD=6.3) and work experience of 10.8 years (SD=6.3). 
2) 
Usability assessment by occupational therapists. 
T1.Effectiveness. All eight therapists agreed that the Wii 
and 
XaviX 
are 
effective 
in 
upper 
extremity 
rehabilitation, and could enhance the patient’s treatment 
motivation and pleasure. Therapist D commented that 
some of the game projects with their controllers can 
effectively strengthen the training of reaching and 
grasping movements and achieve better therapy 
effectiveness as compared to the traditional equipment. 
In addition, therapists mentioned that the existing 
conventional 
equipment 
are 
still 
important 
in 
rehabilitation and not possible to be fully replaced by 
digital gaming devices. The traditional equipment do 
not require the patient to react in time and restrict 
his/her movement speed, hence the patient can repeat 
the movement as many times as he/she wishes and at a 
speed at his/her own control. Therefore, the digital 
game devices can play a supporting role in 
252

ACHI 2013 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

rehabilitation treatment by providing diversification and 
interesting game projects for improvement of patient 
motivation toward the treatment. 
T2. Ease of Use. Three therapists (A, B, C) considered that 
Wii is easy to set up, except some errors may occur 
when setting up the game software items. The usage 
problems are the following: (a) The current software 
interface is in Japanese and not easy to understand, 
hence it is prone to cause errors in the set-up process; (b) 
The required response time of the game is too fast and 
not easy to keep up with for the patients; (c) Some 
patients may have difficulty to hold the hand controller, 
hence the need for additional bandages to tie it on the 
hand; (d)  For some patients, the games are too difficult.  
For XaviX, five therapists agreed that the hardware 
is easy to set up, except the software interface operation 
may cause occasional mistakes. The usage problems are 
the following: (a) The current software interface is in 
Japanese and not easy to understand, hence it is prone 
to cause errors in the set-up process, especially for the 
games of visual perception and memory training, which 
are impossible to operate without literacy of the 
Japanese language; (b)  The sensor is not sensitive 
enough, e.g., the action may obstruct the reflective film 
and interrupt the detection by the sensor; (c)  The 
controller gloves have only one single size, thus, they 
do not necessarily fit to all patients; (d)  Although the 
games are available in three levels of difficulty, the 
differences between the difficulties are too abrupt and 
hard to meet the patient’s required degree of difficulty. 
T3. Comfort. The results show that, for both Wii and XaviX, 
none of the eight therapists had received any complaints 
from the patients concerning discomfort in operating 
the controllers. However, therapist A commented that 
the controller of Wii often fell off from some patients’ 
hands even with the safety ring held around the wrist. 
Therefore, he proposed that the controller be designed 
to be adjustable in size or to have a banding strap to 
help the patient to hold it with. Some patients cannot 
press the buttons on the controller to operate the menu 
due to incomplete recovery of the hand functions, hence 
they need to be assisted by the therapist for such 
operations before they can proceed with the game. 
Therefore, it is desirable to redesign the interaction 
mode between the controller and the game. For XaviX, 
therapist D suggested that this device provides a 
different set of controllers, which are suitable for 
different forms of motor training for the patients. For 
instance, the use of gloves, bowling balls, and other 
controllers can be useful for training the hand grip 
function. 
T4. Acceptability. All eight therapists agreed that most 
patients can accept the use of Wii or XaviX for 
treatment. Therapist B explained that people interested 
in the game have a very high degree of acceptance of 
such devices. However, some elderly patients tend to 
prefer using the traditional rehabilitation equipment, 
because they feel that the traditional equipment are 
some physical objects that can be held and manipulated, 
hence giving a feeling of the effect of treatment. On the 
contrary, digital game devices give an impression of 
laxness and frivolity, and hence are inefficient and 
ineffective for those patients. 
3) 
Usability assessment by stroke patients 
S1. Device set-up. Two patients of the Wii group mentioned 
that they could set up the device and then operate the 
Remote to choose a game from the main menu to play 
by themselves. However, the other two patients needed 
the therapist to assist them to set up the device, and to 
operate the Remote to choose a game from the main 
menu for them to play. One patient of the XaviX group 
mentioned that he could set up the device and then 
operate the controller to choose a level of the game 
from the main menu to play by himself. The other three 
patients mentioned that they could only do some of the 
steps, i.e. to choose a level of the game from the main 
menu to play. 
S2. Game-playing. Four patients that participated in the Wii 
group mentioned that they encountered only one usage 
problem: ‘during the bowling game, they felt that it was 
difficult to press the control pad and to hold down the B 
button while using the device. Therefore, they usually 
had to use the unaffected hand to help. This difficulty is 
understandable, because their fingers, still under 
restoration, were weak and clumsy, hence they would 
need  more time to operate the buttons. The four 
patients that participated in the XaviX group mentioned 
their respective usage problems as follows: (1) the 
safety belt of the bowling ball loosened easily, (2) the 
weight of the soft bowling ball was too light to feel: "I 
felt only the return swing of the hand. It didn't seem to 
be effective in training the strength of the upper 
extremity muscles." (3) Could not play well: "In the 
first two times I was not sure if my posture was correct, 
so I felt somewhat frustrated." (4) The bowling ball 
could not be gripped in the normal way: "My hand 
movement function still needs to be restored and the 
fingers curled, so the only way for me to play with the 
bowling ball was to hook the safety belt in my hand. In 
this way, the ball was unsteady when I swung my 
hand.＂ 
S3. Performance feedback. All eight patients agreed that 
they would pay attention to the scores of the games 
after playing. One of them mentioned that in order to 
upgrade the score, he would try to improve the strength 
of his upper extremity by practicing. The other two 
patients also mentioned that they would challenge the 
last score. 
S4. Satisfaction. All the eight patients agreed that they were 
satisfied with using these devices for treatment (Wii: 
mean=4.0, SD=0.0; XaviX: mean=4.3, SD=0.5). 
S5. Motivation. Eight patients agreed that these devices 
used in the treatment promoted their treatment 
motivation (Wii: mean=4.3, SD=0.5; XaviX: mean=4.0, 
SD=0.8). 
S6. Fun. Eight patients agreed that these devices were more 
interesting than traditional rehabilitation equipment 
(Wii: mean=4.3, SD=0.5; XaviX: mean=4.0, SD=0.8).

ACHI 2013 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

Five of them mentioned that these devices provided 
useful information, such as the scores, audio and video 
feedback, as well as interesting interactions, making 
them feel positively toward doing the treatment 
activities. 
IV. DISCUSSIONS.  
Many studies have reported that digital gaming is able to 
promote motor recovery after stroke, but most trials were 
small in scale and had some design limitations [2][10][11]. 
However, one clear advantage of the use of these games for 
rehabilitation is the psychological effects. It facilitates 
interest and motor learning, promoting motivation through 
the in-built commentary prizes, visual and verbal cues, 
tapping into patients’ innate competitive natures and into 
their desire for interaction [2][6]. These effects are 
unavailable from conventional rehabilitation equipment. 
These advantages may be a reason to affect the effectiveness 
of the patients’ rehabilitation therapy. It is worth preserving 
and incorporating them into digital rehabilitation device 
design or conventional rehabilitation equipment redesign. 
Effectiveness of Wii and XaviX could compare to 
conventional equipment. In order to be fairer when 
comparing the effectiveness between the three groups, we 
tried to reduce the differences according to the age range of 
the patients in each group. Although, no statistically 
significant differences in the effectiveness indexes between 
the three groups were found, patients in the Wii and XaviX 
groups had improved upper extremity motor functional 
ability. This result seems to demonstrate that Wii and XaviX 
could be equivalent to conventional rehabilitation equipment 
for improving upper extremity motor functions. 
Therapists and patients’ perspectives about satisfaction. 
Therapists considered that patients generally were willing to 
use the digital game for rehabilitation. Therapists mentioned 
that only some elderly patients tended to prefer using the 
traditional rehabilitation equipment, because they felt that the 
traditional equipment are tangible objects that can be held 
and manipulated, hence giving a feeling of their 
effectiveness in treatment. However, all patients in this 
clinical trial were satisfied with using the digital gaming 
devices for rehabilitation. They expressed the hope that the 
digital gaming devices could be included in conventional 
rehabilitation therapy programs, and they felt that they 
increased the diversity of the rehabilitation activities. In 
addition, they also suggested that it would be better if the 
controllers of such devices were adjustable in weight. 
The interface was difficult to use. In this study, the stroke 
patients’ upper extremity rehabilitation convalescent levels 
were in the Brunnstrom stages III to IV, their fingers were 
mostly not restored at all. Hence, they had difficulties in 
performing fine movements, such as pressing the buttons on 
the Remote. To resolve this usage problem, it seems that the 
existing XaviX-Eyehand operation could be applied for such 
patients. This software is operated by the Glove Sensors 
worn on the user's hands. The user can move a cursor with 
the movement of the gloved hand, and select a menu item by 
clenching his/her fist (to hide the reflective sheets on the 
Glove Sensors). Though such an operation is easier than 
operating a controller to press the button, it is not preferable 
for patients in these stages, who still have difficulty in 
clenching their fists. An improvement of the design can be 
achieved by having users only to move the cursor to a fixed-
point for some seconds, indicating a purposeful choice. In 
addition, some newly developed technologies can also be 
adopted. 
The problem about device set-up. Observation of the 
therapists and patients in setting-up the XaviX revealed that 
they spent much time in determining the sensing range 
between the host and the controller in order to optimize the 
operating area for the players. To improve this problem, it is 
recommended that the device be designed with a mechanism 
to sense the region in a graphic fashion. This mechanism 
would let users immediately know whether the controller is 
in the sensing region or not, hence enhancing the efficiency 
of device set-up. 
The difficulty levels of the games were too limited. People 
with stroke have different levels and complex impairments 
of varying severity. The impairments may include weakness 
of the arm, impaired vision, a variety of cognitive and 
executive problems or a combination of these impairments. 
These all can reduce their upper extremity function and 
response capacities. However, the difficulty levels provided 
by most of the commercial digital game devices are unable 
to meet the real needs of clinical rehabilitation therapy. For 
example, the XaviX- ladder climbing has only three 
difficulty levels, which is clearly not enough. Furthermore, 
Wii Sports even has no grade distinction at all. It was 
observed that two of the patients in the XaviX group were 
slow in response and had difficulties to timely respond to the 
game task. Therefore, in order to meet the treatment needs of 
different upper extremity function levels of the stroke 
patients, the device should be designed with more difficulty 
levels. How to define the scope of the game difficulty levels 
requires further trials in the future. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
From the results obtained from the interviews and 
observations, it was found that the digital game devices 
currently used in clinical rehabilitation have been evaluated 
by professional therapists as useful and effective in 
supporting the treatment, though some design improvements 
may be necessary. This report mainly presents the results of 
the interview with occupational therapists and patients and 
observations of the clinical use of existing digital game 
devices in rehabilitation. Conclusions can be summarized 
into the following points: 
1. All patients in this clinical trial were satisfied with 
using the digital gaming devices for rehabilitation. In 
addition, therapists also suggested that it would be better if 
the controllers of such devices were adjustable in weight. 
2. Design guidelines concerning the improvement of 
existing digital game devices can be synthesized as follows, 
where items a to d are about software design, and items e to i 
about hardware: a) To increase the response time and 
difficulty levels of the games in order to better suit the 
various patients with different abilities of upper extremity 
functions. b) To expand the sensor’s sensing scope. c) To be

able to record movement data. d) To provide a Chinese 
version of the software interface of the games. e) To improve 
the ways to fix the controller on the user’s hand. f) To fit the 
controllers size for different hand dimensions of the patients. 
g) To provide better correspondence between the game and 
real-life movements. h) To provide controllers for body 
control training, such as chest strap and belt. i) To simplify 
the controller's operation. 
In order to make these devices more suitable to use in 
rehabilitation, 
a 
comprehensive 
follow-up 
design 
development based on these proposed guidelines would be 
necessary. The newly designed devices would be more 
suitable for rehabilitation therapy, and enhance the use safety 
and effectiveness for people of all ages and abilities.
