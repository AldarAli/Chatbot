INTRODUCTION
Nowadays,
the
wide
implication
of
information
technologies in developed countries is affecting their social-
economic development. The number of citizens, centers,
organizations, institutes having access to and using internet
for satisfying their needs is being rapidly increased. In this
situation, there is an increasing need for more mobility and
interactivity in transparency principles of public services and
neutrality principles from political point of view. Note that
the opportunities of political and social technologies in
administration are being widened.
In some sources, “electronic government” term is used
during translation and different definition, especially in the
developing
countries.
As
“electronic
government”
is
currently under construction especially in the developing
countries, it has not been fully formed as a definition. As
shown in relevant documents, it does not only include the
central executive authority, it also includes the three
branches of government – the executive, the legislative and
the judicial [1]-[3].
The conducted research shows that the definition of
implication of the electronic government (e-government) is
expanded
not
only
as
application
of
information
technologies, but also as a tool of administration of public
services in the world. Sometimes, as a key of success of e-
government, Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
systems are indicated [4][5].
The forming of national e-governments in post-industrial
countries is carried out based on reform of all public
administration system. The main objective here is the
compliance
of
public
administration
with
Information
society. Modern public administration contains its substantial
clarity,
transparency,
competition
environment,
and
responsibility for the outcomes of its actions, increase of the
role of ethical requirements, and active mutual relationship
with civil society. It is essential that, during the use of
Information - Communication Technologies (ICT) in public
administration, also other factors affecting the character of
socio-political, economic, cultural, mental, and government-
society relationships are considered.
Wahid [6] provides a literature review on e-government
in the context of developing countries published between
2005 and 2010. Results of research may guide researchers in
their
continued
investigation
of
e-government
implementation, especially in the context of developing
countries. Some research direction were provided: paying
more attention to research paradigm and methodology,
preserving
multiculturalism
in
e-government
research,
improving the research quality, developing conceptual basis
of e-government, etc. [6].
Last research works provide an analytic review of the
literature on the diffusion of e-government. In research
works analyzed the related literature in the relevant journals
and from international conferences in the field of ICT and
public administration. Analytical results reveal the main
conceptual and architectural principles, research methods,
and research topics found in the relevant literature. Main
research topics are included: the factors that influence the
diffusion
of
e-government,
e-government
systems
and
applications,
the
impacts
of
e-government
to
public
authorities and citizens, the relationships between ICT
infrastructures and the influence of e-government, etc. [7].
Nowadays, the governments invest big amount of funds
to realisation of e-government projects for further upgrade of
services
supplied
by
the government
to
citizens
and
reduction of costs in whole world. The governments can
increase
the
efficiency
of
actions
and
carry
out
administrative operations more easily by using ICT. By
considering
this
important
fact,
the
specification
of
researches in direction of e-government establishment and
also the most successfulle applied models and their research
are
remarkably
necessary.
From
this
point
of
view,
development of scientific-theoretical principles of forming
29

ICDS 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Digital Society

the e-government is of great importance. By considering the
international practice in research, some up-to-date scientific-
theoretical problems of forming the e-government has been
researched.
II.
THE CONCEPTUAL AND ARCHITECTUAL PRINCIPLES OF
E-GOVERNMENT
It is known that e-government has started forming in the
cross of two centuries. It is known from history that, each
transition to new quality has been accompanied by several
complications, sometimes by serious crisis. Following this
experience, the government can prevent the possible social-
economic crisis by modernizing the public administrative
mechanisms. In this regard, the government was required to
conduct some reforms for the transformation to a new phase
in public administration. The transition to a new phase
necessitates the conduction of important scientific-research
works.
Literature review on e-government shows that potential
factors of e-government implementation and classified these
factors into four categories: institutional, resource-related,
access-related and legal aspects [8]. Chen et al. [9] propose a
set
of
elements
for
successful
implementation
of
e-
government. As for the benefits, such as efficiency and
effectiveness in public administration, more countries are
working towards adopting e-government [10]. Researchers
suggest
that
e-government
adoption
is
not
merely
a
technological issue; also it is influenced by other factors such
as human, social, cultural and economic aspects [11]. The
implementation of e-government in developing nations faces
many challenges [12].
Alshehri et al. [13] reviewed the updated the available
literature about e-government implementation stages, its
challenges and benefits. It reviews several relevant issues
regarding e-government, such as the definition of e-
government, implementation stages, the advantages of e-
government implementation and it focuses on the challenges
of e-government implementation [13].
According to “Electron government” law of USA dated
2002 [14], this term was accepted as an expansion of access
to government information of agencies and government
structures by means of information technologies and Internet,
also as an implication of information technologies and the
use for the increase of efficiency [14]. In official documents,
e-government is comprehended as a mutual relationship
system with information character of local government
authorities and the society by using ICT. “Gartner Group”
company reckons that e-government – is the concept of
administration by incessant optimisation of services process,
participation of citizens in political processes, also by
changing of internal and external relations with the help of
technical tools, Internet and modern mass media [15].
In some research works, “electronic government” term is
defined as Internet-Technologies providing the informative
mutual
relationship
of
government
authorities
with
population and civil society institutions. E-government is
specified as an integral, socially responsible enterprise
having regular counter-relation and open to information.
In general, e-government is specified as a mutual
relationship between specialised complex system of public
authorities and citizens, civil society and business structures
by means of Internet. The following steps of a mutual
relationship, Customer-to-Business (C2B) – between citizen
and business; Business-to-Business (B2B) – between private
companies;
Government-to-Citizen
(G2C)
–
between
government
services
(on
goverment,
departments
and
regions level) and citizens; Government-to-Business (G2B) –
between government and business sectors; Government-to-
Government (G2G) – between public authorities can be
shown.
Note that the conceptual model of e-government is based
on government structure existing in countries of democratic
society and market economy (Figure 1b). Conceptually, the
approach of this problem, the reforms conducted in public
administration in the beginning of 90-s showed the larger
share of government in forming of e-government (Figure 1a).
Alongside, it must be considered that the society not only
obtains the access to
information, but
also
gets the
opportunity
to
affect
the
decision-making
process
of
government and participate interactively in the process of
preparation of decisions; as a result, the transparency of
public sector performance increases.
Figure 1.
Evaluation model of E-government.
In general, e-government creates new opportunities for
development
of
democracy.
It
provides
the
mutual
information relationship between citizens and civil society
institution and public authorities by means of ICT. In other
words, e-government comprises the mutual relations system
of
citizens,
civil
society
and
business-structures,
and
executive government structures by means of Internet.
Implication of ICT in government performance, transparency
and
accessibility of government
information, feedback
principle
between
citizens
and
public
authorities,
government responsibility for the decisions made, etc.; issues
in different countries are the main characteristics specifying
e-government.
It is essential that the transformation to Information
society, e-government strategy based on democratice values
necessitates the gradual change of government model, the
increase
of
share
of
civil
and
business
structures,
minimization of government share (Figure 1c).
According to definition of European Committee, e-
government - is the use of ICT in public structures and
improvement of performance of government employees and
public authorities in the background of realization of
30

ICDS 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Digital Society

organizational reforms and forming of skills directed to the
increase of level of services provided by them [16].
According to the concept of e-government, the whole
system of public authorities performs as an integral service
organization for the provision of services to citizens. The
performance of e-government must be clear, transparent and
available in terms of information for citizens. The specific
attention is drawn to establishment of feedback mechanism,
efficiency of services provision and execution period by
using the centralized systems. These all enable to increase
either the quality of provision of services provided by the
government to citizens, or the performance efficiency of
government.
III.
THE ISSUES OF ASSESSMENT OF FORMING PROCESSES
AND MANAGEMENT OF E-GOVERNMENT
One of the up-to-date issues regarding e-government is
the assessment and monitoring its forming processes. It can
be justified that e-government is an online environment with
the quite complicated structure. On the other hand, e-
government is the sum of vertically and horizontally
interrelated corporative information spaces.
The issue of establishment of complex indicators system
for the monitoring of the efficiency of governance and the
use of ICT in different areas, the methodology of practical
implication has been started to forming at the end of 1990's
[3][17][18]. Nowadays, the existing practical experience and
methodical potential for the assessment of the electronic
readiness, the monitoring, potential analysis and comparative
analysis of governments are present. As such methodologies,
one can mention some well-known ones; (i) e-government
development index of United Nations regarding the forming
and the use of e-government [19], (ii) networked readiness
index of World Economic Forum [20], (iii) ICT development
index (IDI) of International Telecommunication Union
regarding the assessment of Information society [21], (iv)
digital opportunity index, an indicators system for the
assessment
of
development
level
of
e-government
of
European
Union
countries
(Capgemini
company)
is
presented in [22].
The
implication
of
international
indexes
for
the
development of methods of the assessment and monitoring
of e-government forming processes can be considered as an
important factor. Also, note that the position of the country
in international ratings has a great importance in terms of the
position of the country attained in the region. These
indicators exhibit the carrying out of development strategy of
Information society of the country.
Note that alongside with the assessment and monitoring
of digital differences either at national, corporative or at
enterprise level; these are the important information for
carrying out of expedient management of the forming
process of aimed electronic environment (e-environment).
Taking into consideration the necessity of realization of 5
sequential
phases
(communication,
computerization,
networking,
informatization,
and
virtualization)
of
e-
environment forming, the balanced relation must be provided
among the separate phases of it. Management centers are the
intellectual systems enabling the efficient decision-making
bases on the indicators characterizing the progress of the
process.
The
following
can
be
shown
as
the
indicators
characterizing the virtualization, socialization phase in e-
environment:

The indicators characterizing the social networks
created in considered e-environment;

The indicators characterizing the classification and
activeness (age, specialty, gender, space, time, etc.)
of users;

Classification and rating indicators of used contents;

The
indicators
characterizing
the
transparency,
accessibility and sequences of information in e-
environment;

The indicators characterizing the virtual relations
established
and
contents
turning
over
in
e-
environment, etc.
It is essential that the solution of several problems
(technological,
normative-legal base, cadres’ education,
scientific, etc.) is an important condition. By taking into
consideration
the
leading
practice,
e-government
establishment in country must be formed based on both
horizontal and vertical management principles. From this
point of view, each institution included in e-government
must have an action plan, the indicators characterizing its
plan must be specified the management of this process must
be executed and the continuing (or on specific cycles)
monitoring must be carried out.
Nowadays, the monitoring and assessment issues
have a timely importance for the realization of e-government
projects, programs specifically. From this point of view, it is
complicated to assess on which phase country is in
realization of e-government program. Different sources rely
on information that is not always based on honesty, reliance
by making specific results for themselves. From this point of
view, there is a need for establishment of complex system of
assessment and monitoring. The indicators accepted at
international level and parameters meeting the local needs
must be included in the system itself.
IV.
INTELLECTUAL ANALYSIS ISSUES OF WEB-RESOURCES
PERFORMING IN E-GOVERNMENT ENVIRONMENT
While considering the e-government programs carried
out in different countries of the world, it becomes clear that
e-government will be more accessible and efficient under the
“single window” principle in the near future. This is mainly
related to rapid development of content mining methods,
web technologies and social networks [23]-[26]. From this
point
of
view,
the
analysis
of
web-resources
and
development
of
management
mechanisms
is
of
great
importance in carrying out the e-government projects.
The implication of web content mining, web-analytics
and social networks are strong tools in improvement of e-
government management effectiveness and establishmet of
feedback mechanism. If ones consider that one of the main
31
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2015.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-381-0
ICDS 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Digital Society

issues in realisation of e-government programs are the
analysis of web-resources and establishment of the effective
management policy, then the implication of innovations, new
technologies
widens
the
communication
capacity
significantly.
This,
in
turn,
enables
to
achieve
new
integration forms between business sector and citizens.
Web-resources
creates
online
interactive
social
communication environment between public authorities and
citizens. More information is gathered in this environment
eventually. Thus, new opportunities are created for the
intellectual analysis of web-infrastructure and more efficient
management of the society.
The internal structure of the electronic community
existing inside each online environment in disguise can be
revealed by applying the social networks theory. The
analysis of e-government web-infrastructures, web mining
technology can be implied for obtaining the following
information [23]-[25]:

Which issues are mostly discussed by the citizens;

The monitoring whether the discussions are related
to government sector;

The
classification
based
on
different
criteria’s
(space, time, age, specialty, activeness, etc.) of
citizens applying mostly to which institutions;

The online monitoring of realisation status of
requirements claimed against web-resources;

The
classification
based
on
different
criterias
(countries, institutions, issues, time, etc) of inquiries
to web-resources from foreign countries performing
in e-government environment, etc.
An effective web analytics of sites, portals and also,
sites providing online services to citizens – is revealing
existing program, technical, content related errors and
adjustment to requests of citizens, and users. By using web-
analytics, the reasons for leaving the site by users, their
actions, and behaviors at web-site regarding a site or
particular service can be revealed. It is clear that web-
analytics is not limited with particular statistics and enables
to obtain more detailed information for analysis.
To analyze log-files gathered in servers, information
gathered in e-mails play a prominent role in effective
decision-making by e-government parties in the process of
establishment of online relations between citizens and public
authorities [23][24]. This, in turn, enables the development
of feedback mechanisms for e-government management.
V.
INFORMATION SECURITY PROVISION ISSUES OF E-
GOVERNMENT
People became more dependent on information as society
gets computerized. Non-provision the information security
can cause major consequences for the society. The priorities
of information security in a particular country are specified
based on the balanced ratio of government, society and
citizens interests. As one of the main components of the
safety of society, the duties of information security are the
confidentiality
of
information,
information
integrity,
information
accessability
and
the
fight
with
harmful
computers [27][28].
Information
security
is
critical
in
e-government
initiatives. Confidentiality of any information available on
the network is crucial point. All data and whole the
government document and other important material have to
be protected from unauthorized persons in case of realizing
e-government initiatives. Information security is critical for
successful realization of such initiatives [29].
E-government forming has created new options of
interactions between government organizations and citizens
in the delivery of government services. Of course, these
interactions have needs for maximum information security.
In general there are five broad requirements of information
security
in
e-government:
confidentiality,
integrity,
availability,
authenticity,
and
accountability
[30].
Developing effective information security practices requires
of both
the
technological perspective
and
the
socio-
organizational perspective [31][32].
Efforts have been made to develop frameworks for
ensuring information security in organizations. For example,
propose an information security culture framework to
heighten information security awareness in organizations
[33]. Martin [34] recommends a total quality management
based
framework
to
manage
information
security
in
organizations. These studies have shown the opportunities of
individual frameworks for maintaining information security
in organizations from different perspectives.
The several issues with technical and administrative-legal
characters must be solved for carrying out the e-government
program. The preparation of mutual relationship reglaments,
the creation of government services classification, also
integral
technical
architecture,
realization
of
program
platform and the provision the information security can be
indicated among them.
For
the
provision
of
normal
performance
of
e-
government, it is necessary to provide the security of each
level constituting e-government.
In general, the up-to-date issues in the framework of
provision the information security of e-government we can
classified as following:

Development of conceptual-architectual models for
provision
and
management
of
e-government
information security and sustainable performance;

Development
of
models
for
the
analysis
of
information security risks and management;

Development of cybercrime defences technologies;

Revealing the disguised criminal social networks
creating threats for e-government environment and
development of analysis methods;

Development of intellectual monitoring system of
corporative network environment;

Development
of
spam
busters
methods
and
algorithms by means of data mining technologies;

Protection of individual information in e-government
environment
and
development
of
user-oriented
security mechanisms;
32
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2015.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-381-0
ICDS 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Digital Society


The creation of Computer Emergency Responce
Team (CERT) in e-government environment;

Investigation of information war, information attack
and information attack defences technologies and
development of new methods and algorithms.
Note that a complex and systematic approach is required
to information security provision issues of e-government.
With the development of Information society, the necessity
of establishment of integral and multilevel nation-wide
information security system appears in the process of e-
government building. In general, building the Information
society perplexes the provision the information security of
countries and the sole fight against threats of different nature
and scale. Thus, building the global information security
environment must be of interest of all countries, civil
societies, companies and people.
VI.
E-GOVERNMENT AND ELECTRONIC DEMOCRACY
ISSUES
Different factors are considered as variables which
impact electronic democracy (e-democracy) based on e-
government literature. E-government is not only a term that
refers to the transformation of public services, so-called e-
governance, but also about the transformation of political
systems, so called e-democracy. E-democracy is considered
such organisation form of citizens’ social-political activity
that the wide use of ICT provides the establishmet of more
effective relations at new level either among citizens, or
between citizens and government bodies, civil society and
business sector [35][36]. In other words for the strengthening
of democratic institutions, the expansion of participation of
citizens in political activity and the use of ICT constitues the
essence of e-democracy. E-democracy term means the
consideration of citizen’s thoughts and the engagement of
citizens and organisations to political relations and processes.
In this phase, the issue of how close the citizens are engaged
in social-political processes is characterized with electronic
citizen problems.
Starting
from
initial
phases
of
awakening
of
e-
democracy, the provision of access opportunities to socially
important information of government bodies by the citizens
was
constrained
by
creating
of
voting
opportunities
regarding partiular decisions of the government [35]-[37].
The further development has widened the opportunities of
both sides, the citizen and the government and close
participation of citizens in social-political processes was
provided. This meant the establishment of the opportunity of
expressing the thoughts by citizens in any level of decision-
making and the notworthy increase of transparency.
The following are related to e-democracy mechanisms
[35][36]:

Electronic
voting
(voting
with
mobile
phone,
Internet-elections, etc);

The collective discussion mechanisms of subjects
with social-political content and socially important
issues in online regime;

The forming mechanisms of online communities,
groups, social networks;

The
mechanisms
of
realisation
of
citizens’
incentives;

Citizens’ control mechanisms on public authorities’
performance, etc.
Figuratively
speaking,
the
main
currency
of
the
democracy is information and communication. With these
two,
the
citizens
are
self-organised,
start
to
govern
themselves and e-citizen is shaped. Social networks, blogs
and others play a prominent role in forming of civil society.
For the civil society, this means that the horizontal relations
system is being shaped and self-governance opportunities
(municipalities, non-governmental organizations, etc.) are
created, i.e., it takes some functions of the government.
Other functions are carried out by the business sector.
Alongside with what was mentioned above, the transition
to Information process does not require only an automation
of existing processes in government management, but also
their re-building based on particular interests of citizens and
a group of interests of the society. Considering those
principles, nowadays, the direct e-democracy projects are not
sufficiently supported by the business sector. E-democracy
concept has several inconsistencies and
is reasonably
criticized.
Hence,
recently
e-government
concept
is
dominant in socio-political and scientific literature, which is
the basis for carrying out the reforms in government
management sphere by means of ICT.
VII.
CONCLUSION
During the review of practice of leading countries, it is
revealed that existing e-government projects have different
objectives and different models, conceptual approaches are
suggested by institutions, organizations for the development
of e-government. By considering this fact, the inspection of
research
conducted
in
direction
of
e-government
establishment
in
international
practice
is
remarkably
necessary. By considering the international practice in
research, some up-to-date scientific-theoretical problems of
forming the e-government has been researched. In research
work,
reviews
several
relevant
issues
regarding
e-
government
such
as
the
definition
of
e-government,
advantages of e-government implementation, the monitoring
of forming processes and management, the intellectual
analysis
of
web-resources,
information
security
and
electronic democracy problems and it focuses on the
challenges
of
e-government
implementation.
Some
conceptual and architectural principles of forming the e-
government are investigated and some recommendations are
given.
Important
research
directions
were
specified
by
considering the main principles of e-government concept.
Results
of research
may
specify
researchers
in
their
continued investigation of e-government implementation,
especially in the context of developing countries.
In future researches, the specific attention will be drawn
to establishment of feedback mechanism, efficiency of
services provision and execution period by using the
centralized systems. These all enable to increase either the
33

quality of provision of services provided by the government
to citizens, or the performance efficiency of government.
