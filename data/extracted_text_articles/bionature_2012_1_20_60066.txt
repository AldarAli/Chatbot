Abstract— Engineering a system solution of the biomass 
pyrolysis process requires thorough investigation of the 
possible end-use applications of the biomass pyrolysis products 
(bio-oils and bio-char) in order to determine the most feasible 
and greenhouse gas abating options for their use. This work 
investigates the biomass pyrolysis process of three potentially 
applicable energy crop species and provides characterization 
of the biooil and biochar products of pyrolysis.  The analysis 
suggests that the biochar contains the OH, aromatic C=C and 
inorganic Si-O-Si bonds. The biooil samples exhibited much 
more complex structure and were highly variable in 
composition 
suggesting 
requirement 
for 
their 
further 
upgrading.

 INTRODUCTION  
A renewed interest in biomass as an alternative energy 
source is apparent in both developing and industrialised 
countries, primarily because of its renewable character and 
potential for reducing net atmospheric CO2 emissions when 
substituted for fossil fuels. Biomass is the generic term for 
materials derived from plants or animal manure. According 
to McKendry [1], biomass materials can be classified in four 
categories: woody plants, herbaceous plants or grasses, 
aquatic plants and manures. On average, woody biomass 
contains about 50 wt% carbon, 43 wt% oxygen, 6 wt% 
hydrogen and the remaining 1 wt% is nitrogen [2] with the 
average mean formula expressed as CH1.44O0.66 [3]. 
When biomass is harvested and processed in a 
sustainable way, biomass to energy conversion has zero net 
atmospheric CO2 contribution because the carbon emission 
from 
biomass 
utilisation 
equals 
the 
photosynthetic 
atmospheric carbon fixed during the lifetime of the plant. 
The potential climate risk caused by excessive CO2 
emissions from fossil fuel utilisation is cited as the main 
driver for accelerated developments in renewable based 
energy generation, with biomass energy generation being 
one of the most prospective among all renewable energy 
sources. Biomass use as a fossil fuel replacement has a 
particular advantage as it can fractionally replace the fossil 
fuels in existing energy generation technologies without 
requirement for large and capital intensive engineering 
adjustments. 
The share of energy generation from various biomass 
sources is estimated as; 64% from wood, 24% from solid 
wastes, 5% from agricultural wastes and 5% from landfill 
gases [4]. The main industries producing biomass wastes are 
the timber, sugar, cotton, agricultural and food industries. 
According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratories, 
the world produces biomass equivalent to 2893 EJ annually. 
The International Energy Administration estimated that in 
1995 the world consumption of biomass was in the order of 
343.6 EJ, which is less than 12% of the total production 
capacity. The developed world still associates biomass with 
waste and most of the biomass in some countries is 
destroyed through field burning or disposed in landfills [5]. 
As an example, in the Sydney region alone 350 Kt/a of 
wood waste is disposed of to landfill, which is equivalent to 
one million cubic metres of landfill space [6]. The current 
disposal practices cause additional environmental concerns 
as not only do they require energy to maintain the disposal 
sites 
but 
also 
the 
biomass 
undergoes 
anaerobic 
decomposition in the landfills producing fugitive CH4 
emissions, which are far more potent than CO2. 
Alternatively, field burning produces CO2 emissions, while 
the potential energy recovery is wasted. It is therefore more 
than apparent that biomass disposal requires integration into 
the current energy technology systems to improve efficiency 
and sustainability.  
A significant advantage of the use of biomass materials 
is that they are renewable sources and can be purposely 
grown for energy use. They are generally low in sulphur and 
nitrogen, hence biomass energy conversion potentially 
results in lower SO2 and fuel-NOx emissions comparing to 
fossil fuel based energy generation [7]. These materials can 
be managed more effectively due to the generally lower 
composition of toxic trace metals when compared to coals 
[8]. A significant constraint to increased biomass utilisation 
is its low density which results in higher volume to mass 
ratios during transportation and storage. Also, most of the 
biomass materials have high moisture content. Given that 
the major agricultural and other biomass producing sites are 
located some distance from the energy utilisation plants, 
biomass transportation cost can be high because not only are 
they less dense but will also include transportation of the 
water. Prior processing and drying may provide a solution, 
however, biomass should also be handled and stored in a 
dried environment due to the hydroscopic ability to quickly 
absorb atmospheric moisture 
One of the potential for increasing the net energy 
capacity of the biomass materials is to thermally upgrade

biomass to higher calorific value fuels. Pyrolysis is one 
method 
where 
biomass 
materials 
are 
heated 
and 
decomposed under inert atmospheric conditions converting 
them to gaseous and liquid products and creating a carbon 
rich charcoal residue. All of the products of biomass 
pyrolysis have significant energy value and can be 
combusted directly to produce energy or they can find other 
uses. For instance, bio-oils can be further upgraded with 
catalytic hydrothermal processing [9] to produce bio-diesel, 
or they can be used as base materials to produce highly 
marketable chemicals [10]. Bio-char has traditionally been 
used as metallurgical fuel in ironmaking [11], but recently 
attracted significant attention as a fertiliser replacement to 
create highly fertile soils, while at the same time 
biologically sequestering atmospheric carbon  [12]. 
Pyrolytic processing has been identified in the literature 
as one of the feasible technologies available to thermally 
upgrade biomass materials to higher calorific value fuels 
[13]. Most of the studies to date have been focused on 
adjusting pyrolysis parameters to achieve maximised bio-oil 
or bio-char yields. There is significant lack of a systems 
approach to the biomass upgrading process, an approach 
which would integrate the pyrolysis conditions, with the 
upgrading potential of bio-oils to produce bio-diesel and 
petrochemicals, bio-gas utilisation and bio-char application 
either as fertilising material or metallurgical fuel, as well as 
bio-carbon sequestration. A systems approach to the 
pyrolysis of biomass will not only enhance competitiveness 
of the higher calorific value renewable fuels and 
petrochemicals, but will also promote sequestration of 
atmospheric greenhouse gases.  
Fig. 1 details the opportunities for energy and material 
recovery from biomass where biomass drying and pyrolysis 
are self driven and maintained through combustion of the 
produced bio-gas and/or bio-oils. The final pyrolysis 
products can have various end-of-stream applications, each 
one offering different advantages and disadvantages. The 
most feasible stream would be selected by a comprehensive 
life cycle analysis taking into account the energy balance, 
material flows and net greenhouse gas savings.

B. Experimental techniques 
The samples were first subjected to Computer Aided 
Thermal Analysis to quantify specific and latent heat of the 
samples during pyrolysis. The technique has been previously 
detailed by Strezov et al. [14]. 
A Mettler Toledo thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) 
instrument TGA/DSC 1 Stare System, operated with Stare 
software, was used to determine the weight loss of the 
samples 
with 
temperature. 
The 
sample 
weighing 
approximately 30 mg was placed in a circular Al crucible 
with an additional empty crucible employed as a reference. 
The experiment was carried out using N2 as a carrier gas, set 
at a flow rate of 20 ml/min, with a heating rate of 10°C/min. 
The buoyancy correction for the TGA data was conducted 
using a blank experiment with no sample placed in either of 
the crucibles prior to each sample run. 
Biooil and biochar samples were then produced in a fixed 
bed pyrolyser by heating approximately 2 grams of biomass 
to the temperature of 500oC. The biooils were condensed at 
room temperature at the outlet of the pyrolyser. 
The FT-IR spectra of the biomass, biooil and biochar 
samples were recorded in Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer 
applying Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) method with 
diamond crystal. The total number of scans was 32 with 
spectral resolution of 4 cm-1.  
The bio-oils condensed at room temperature were first 
dissolved in dichloromethane and then analysed using a 
Shimadzu GC-MS apparatus (Model QP2010), with a 30 
8

meter long SGE-BP1 column of 0.25µm diameter. Prior to 
commencement with GCMS experiments the instrument was 
auto-calibrated using perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA). 
III. 
RESULTS 
Fig. 2 shows the specific heat of the samples. The latent 
heats of pyrolysis were observed through the changes in 
specific heat with corresponding peaks and troughs. Fig. 2 
shows that all of the samples exhibited endothermic heat of 
reaction starting at 100oC to 180oC associated with 
decomposition and release of the hydrated compounds. At 
the temperature range between 200 and 400oC the samples 
went through a very large endothermic reaction due to the 
breakdown of the hemicellulose and cellulose and in this 
temperature region, the major weight loss of the samples is 
also observed, as determined by the thermogravimetric 
analysis shown in Fig. 3. At temperatures above 400oC the 
specific heat showed minor reactions with peaks at 420 and 
820oC in case of hemp and 750oC in case of wattle tree. 
These reactions are followed with only minor loss of weight 
in 
the 
samples 
(see 
Fig. 
3). 
According 
to 
the 
thermogravimetric data shown in Fig. 3, at the temperature 
of industrial pyrolysis, which is typically around 500oC, the 
samples weigh 28%, 29.5% and 37.2% in case of sugar cane, 
hemp and wattle tree, respectively. The majority of the 
weight is lost as non-condensable bio-gas and condensable 
bio-oil products of pyrolysis.

Figure 3.  Thermogravimetric analysis of the biomass samples. 
Fig. 4 shows FTIR spectra of the unprocessed biomass 
samples, the biochars produced at 500oC and bio-oils 
evolved at 500oC and condensed at room temperature. 
Interpretation of the FTIR spectra was conducted according 
to the guidelines outlined by Coates [15]. The raw samples 
all showed a very broad band with a peak at 3340 cm-1 due to 
OH stretch of the hydroxy group. The same band, although 
with smaller intensity was also evident in the bio-oil 
products of all three samples. A very minor presence of the 
OH groups was also monitored in the bio-chars produced 
from sugar cane and hemp, but not in the biochar produced 
from wattle tree. The double peak at 2920 and 2860 cm-1 
observed in all biomass samples was associated with the 
saturated aliphatic group, in particular the methylene C-H 
stretch. This group was also apparent in the produced biooils, 
particularly showing strongest appearance in case of the 
biooil produced from the wattle tree sample. The raw 
samples also exhibited very strong peak at 1035 cm-1 related 
to Si-O-Si bond and the intensity of the peak corresponded to 
the ash content of each sample presented in Table I. Sugar 
cane, with ash content of 6.9% showed the largest intensity 
of this peak, followed by hemp at 4.6% and wattle tree at 
2.8%. The biochars produced at 500oC also exhibited the 
same FTIR peak indicating that the silica from the raw 
biomass samples remains in the solid biochar product. The 
peak at 1620 cm-1, most apparent in the raw wattle tree 
sample, was due to the aromatic C=C stretch. The same peak 
appeared in the biochar and to some extent in the biooil 
samples. The biooils also showed strong peaks at 1265 cm-1 
associated with the phenol C-O stretch and at 734 cm-1 due 
to the aromatic C-H out of plane bend. The remaining small 
multiple peaks in the range between 1160 to 1520 cm-1 
observed in all raw biomass samples and the produced 
biooils are likely due to the aromatic ring group frequencies.

The FTIR spectroscopy for analysis of biooil samples is 
very useful experimental technique that can be used to show 
how various bonds from the raw samples are redistributed to 
the biooil products during pyrolysis. However, for the 
purpose of identification of the various chemical compounds, 
this technique needs to be supplemented with Gas 
Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS). In this work 
GC-MS technique was further applied to determine the 
major chemical compounds present in the biooil samples and 
the results are displayed in Table II.

pyrolysis oil sample. Various phenol groups were also 
detected as some of the major compounds in all three 
samples. The GC-MS result indicated that the bio-oils 
produced from pyrolysis of the selected biomass samples are 
highly variable in composition and are unlikely to be suitable 
for direct use, except for some cases of use of pyrolysis oils 
as industrial fuels. For the purpose of the use as commercial 
fuel product, their upgrading would be essential. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Biomass pyrolysis provides an opportunity for system 
solution to energy supply and biological sequestration of 
carbon through agricultural application of the produced 
biochar. The work presented here outlines some of the 
product characterization approaches that can be applied to 
perform energy, mass and life cycle assessment required to 
model the pyrolysis system. The results indicated that the 
pyrolysis process has an initial endothermic reaction 
followed by largely exothermic heat of reaction, which 
means that the overall heat requirement to complete the 
pyrolysis process can be partially supported by the internal 
exothermic reaction. The analysis of the biochar and biooil 
samples suggest that the biochar contains the OH, aromatic 
C=C and inorganic Si-O-Si bonds. The biooil samples 
exhibited much more complex structure and were highly 
variable in composition suggesting requirement for their 
further upgrading. Feasibility assessment should also be 
performed in order to maximize the opportunity of the 
pyrolysis as a technological solution to biomass processing.
