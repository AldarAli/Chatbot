INTRODUCTION 
 
Thin film lead sulfide detectors have been widely used 
over the past years for radiation sensing in 1 to 3µm spectral 
region. They are mainly very useful in academic, 
commercial 
and 
military 
applications. 
In 
military 
application, PbS detectors are used for both tactical and 
strategic systems, with a very strong emphasis towards an 
increasing requirement for large area multiple element 
arrays. 
 
Unlike most other semiconductors IR detectors, lead 
sulfide materials are used in the form of polycrystalline 
films approximately 1µm thick and with individual 
crystallites ranging in size from approximately 0.1µm to1 
µm. They are usually prepared by chemical bath deposition 
(CBD), which generally yields better uniformity of response 
and more stable results than the evaporate methods [1]-[5].  
 
As-deposited 
PbS 
films 
exhibit 
very 
low 
photoconductivity, however, a post deposition process are 
used to achieve final sensitization. To obtain high 
performance detectors, lead chalcogenide films need to be 
sensitized by oxidation. This oxidation may be carried out 
using additives in the deposition bath, post-deposition heat 
treatment in the presence of oxygen, or chemical oxidation 
of the films. 
 
Others impurities added to the chemical–deposition 
solution 
for 
PbS 
have 
a 
considerable 
effect 
on 
photosensitivity films characteristics [5]-[9]. They may 
increase the photosensitivity by some order of magnitude 
more than films prepared without these impurities [8] [9]. 
 
This work deals with characterization and simulation of 
PbS photoconductors infrared detectors prepared by CBD. 
The effect of oxidant agent and Bismuth Nitrate additives on 
the performances of PbS detectors is also examined. Finally, 
a simulation study with surface state model proposed in [10] 
[11] is also presented. This paper is organized as follows: 
Section I presents the particularities associated with PbS 
infrared photo- detectors development. Section II details the 
experimental procedure for devices fabrication and 
characterization. After analysis of surface morphology and 
film structure in subsection III.A, we performed optical 
measurements (III.B) in order to understand the effect of 
additives of oxidation and doping on structural and optical 
properties of deposited PbS films. Based on surface state 
model reviewed in subsection III.C, a comparison between 
photoelectrical 
measurements 
of 
developed 
PbS 
photoconductors and theoretical prediction is proposed in 
subsection III.D. The conclusions and perspectives are 
described in Section IV.  
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
 
The setup deposition of E. Pentia et all [9] was used for 
growing the PbS films over three bath solutions, 
summarized in Table I. The bath 1 contain the basic 
precursors which are Lead Nitrate Pb(NO3)2, Sodium 
Hydroxide (NaOH) and Thiourea SC(NH2)2, the bath 2 
contain in addition an oxidant agent, named Hydroxylamine 
Hydrochloride (NH2OH-HCl), and the bath 3 contain in 
addition to bath 2, the Bismuth Nitrate Bi(NO3)3 as doping 
agent. 
 
Aqueous solution of 0.069 M lead nitrate, 0.69 M NaOH 
and 0.24 M thiourea were used. In order to prepare PbS 
films, the following procedure was adopted: 20 ml of lead 
nitrate solution was mixed with 20 ml of NaOH with 
constant stirring. The initial color solution was milky, after 
it became transparent, 20 ml of thiourea solution was 
gradually added followed by addition of oxidant with 20 ml 
of 0.086 M Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride (NH2OH.HCL), 
again with constant stirring, the global solution was diluted 
with 20 ml of water. Finally, a small quantity of Bismuth 
nitrate with 1.5 ml of 2.0610-4 M was added to some 
reactions. The PbS films were deposited on microscope 
glass substrate cleaned, for about 48 h, in a mixture of 
(HNO3, (K2Cr2O7: H2SO4; 1:10), 1% EDTA followed by 
rinsing in distilled water.

After drying, one facet of this substrate was stuck with an 
inert paste on a support having T format introduced 
vertically in the reaction bath containing the chemical 
mixture. After some time, the transparent color solution 
started to change to become completely black after one (01) 
hour. 
 
The measured film thicknesses, using DEKTAK 
profilometer, were about 150 nm for both films elaborated 
with and without oxidant. Thicker films were obtained by 
repeated deposition. Gold electrodes were evaporated on the 
surface of PbS films for electric and photoelectric 
measurements in a coplanar configuration. The films 
characterizations were performed after annealing in air at 
80° C for approximately 70 h. 
  
Structural 
properties 
were 
evaluated 
by 
x-rays 
diffraction using a D5000 Siemens diffractometer. The 
scans were carried out at room temperature, in the 
conventional /2  mode using Cu-K radiation (0.1542 
nm). The morphology was observed by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL 6400F microscope. The 
optical properties were studied with a CARY 5000 UV-Vis-
NIR double beam spectrometer. The photoconductivity 
measurements were performed with a system constituted by 
a standard IR light source, an Oriel MS257 monochromator 
operated in the range 1-20 µm, a chopper fixed at 400 Hz 
and the acquisition equipment composed with spectrum 
analyzer, lock-in amplifier and oscilloscope.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. 
Surface morphology and films structures 
 
Figures 1 and 2 show SEM micrographs of PbS films 
deposited with and without oxidant.  It appears that the 
average grain size increases with the used oxidant. 
Concerning the films structural properties, Figures 3 and 4 
show the effect of annealing treatment (T=80°C,for 72h) 
and Bismuth doping on the XRD (X Rays Diffraction) 
patterns of deposited PbS films. As can be seen, films 
deposited with hydroxylamine hydrochloride additive are 
less textured when compared to films prepared without this 
additive, which are (200) preferentially oriented, the grains 
become oriented quasi-equally with (200) and (111) 
crystallographic direction. The effect of annealing at 80°C 
for 72h and doping with bismuth nitrate, affects in opposite 
manner the XRD patterns. As seen, the annealing increases, 
while the doping decreases the films texture.

Optical properties 
 
Figures 5 and 6 show the transmittances (Tcorr) and 
(h)2 plots of PbS films prepared with different baths and 
annealed at 80° C for 72 h respectively. The inset shows the 
absorption coefficient of these films. As shown, oxidant and 
doping affect the optical properties. The optical band gap 
was calculated from the spectral absorption near the 
fundamental absorption edge. The direct band gap of all 
synthesized PbS films was estimated using the Tauc relation 
given as follow 
     (     )
 
  
where „A‟ is the parameter which depends on the transition 
probability. For direct transition in the fundamental 
absorption, (  )2  have linear dependence on the photon 
energy (h). The intercept on energy axis gives the direct 
band gap energy. Based on the optical transmission 
measurements, we have obtained the direct band gap energy 
for PbS films grown by different baths, which is 0.42 eV for 
films prepared without additive (referred as 1), it becomes 
0.5 eV for films prepared with oxidant (referred as 2) and 
0.56 eV for films prepared with doping agent (referred as 3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C. 
Surface state model  
 
Photoconductivity in PbS films can be explained by two 
models depending upon whether the semiconductor is 
single-crystalline 
or 
polycrystalline, 
which 
are 
recombination and barrier models respectively. The 
recombination model assumes that change in conductivity 
on illumination results from the change in the number of 
conducting electrons or holes per unit volume. In the 
barriers model, it is assumed that illumination produces little 
or no change in the density of charge carriers but an increase 
in their effective mobility. A large number of surface 
defects are produced along the crystalline boundaries. These 
surface defects capture electrons from the interior of the 
single-crystalline and produce space charge barriers. 
Illumination reduces the number of electrons in the surface 
defects and thereby lowers the barrier height. In real 
polycrystalline material, the observed photoconductivity 
may be due to a combination of both recombination and 
barrier processes. One of these combination models is the 
surface state model proposed by [10] [11] (figure 7).  
 
This model treats the free surface with different manner 
of precedent model [12] [13]. It was characterized by 
surface state density (Nt), unique energy level (Et) 
associated with defect localized in the forbidden gap and 
effective cross section () rather than the surface 
recombination velocity. In this model, the barrier height at 
the semiconductor free surface is modified under photonic 
excitation. It was suggested that recombination influence 
directly the quantum efficiency of detector. All models 
accept that, the role of oxidant is assumed to introduce a 
trapping state that inhibits recombination; these traps 
capture the minority carriers and thereby extending the life 
time of material. As mentioned above, without the 
sensitization step, lead sulfide has very short life time and a 
low response.  
 
 
The concentration of excess carriers density; the key 
parameter of this model, allows us to explore all the 
theoretical equations of detectors figure of merit. This 
parameter is calculated with a self-consistent way, taking 
into account the resolution of continuity equation of 
majority and minority carriers in the depletion and neutral 
(Bulk) region of material, given by [10][11];

Where Bn is the concentration of excess carriers density 
at free surface (z=0), which is determined by the appropriate 
conditions of limits [14], Zd, Ln, Dn and G(z) are width of 
depletion region, diffusion length, diffusion coefficient and 
generation rate respectively. Detailed calculation of the 
surface analysis, optical generation and photoconductor 
performances (Signal, Spectral response or responsivity and 
specific detectivity) is presented respectively in the 
appendix. 
 
D. 
Photo-detection performances measurement and 
simulation   
 
In order to investigate the influence of oxidant and 
doping on detection and capabilities of PbS films, three 
photoconductive detectors prepared with and without 
additives (table I) have been analyzed. To avoid the Flicker 
noise, manifested at low frequency, the chopping frequency 
at 400 Hz and the total polarization voltage at 50 V have 
been fixed. The test set used provides radiant flux in a very 
narrow spectral band centered about any desired wavelength 
(). 
There 
are 
three 
functional 
controls 
on 
the 
monochromator:  
  The centered  of the exciting beam; 
  The width of the spectral interval centered at ; 
  The 
amount 
of 
flux 
passing 
through 
the 
monochromator. 
 
A constant flux per unit  interval should be maintained 
for any selected  center in the interval of [1-4 µm]. 
According to application data sheet of the infrared source, 
the power of infrared radiation is calculated manually by 
assuming the IR source as a blackbody at 1230° C (the IR 
source is a Silicon Carbide SiC emitted in the range of 0.7-
28µm, the irradiance of this source is nearly the same of 
blackbody heated at 1230°C, particularly in 0.7-3µm 
spectral range) [15].  
 
It is interesting to notice, here, that the noise is measured 
in the absence of light, with lock-in amplifier and spectrum 
analyzer under equivalent noise band width of f=50, the 
effective value of noise is done by Vn/ (f )1/2 [16]. The 
values of Vn (noise voltage in rms) for photoconductors 
prepared with three baths are 55.15, 86.3 and 63.6 µV 
respectively.  
 
This measurement of noise is crucial in the calculating 
of spectral specific detectivity, which depends of the ratio of 
spectral response and noise. 
 
Figures 8, 9 and 10 show the signal, spectral response 
and specific detectivity of these photoconductive detectors 
fitted with surface state model [10] [11]. The oxidant 
enhances the capabilities of detection comparatively to 
detectors prepared without oxidant. The doping increases 
again these capabilities and decreases the peak wavelength. 
 
The best adjustments are obtained with the data reported 
in Table II. It should be noted that, the confrontation 
between experimental and calculated data of signal is 
excellent, but a small discrepancy in spectral response and 
specific detectivity for the first point of measurement is 
observed. It is probably due to high fluctuation of signal at 
low wavelength. Also, the parameters issued with this 
simulation are in agreement with the published ones in the 
literature [17] [18].

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In the present work, detectors based on sensitized thin 
films, growth by chemical bath deposition are studied. The 
photoelectrical characterization allowed that, detectors 
developed without oxidant has approximately very low 
performances 
(Signal, 
Responsivity 
and 
Specific 
Detectivity) compared with those developed with oxidant. 
The use of doping agent increases again these performances 
along with decreasing the peak position wavelength of 
detector.  
A simulation study of proposed IR photoconductors, 
using surface state model, has been also presented. The plots 
show the ability of this model to adjust their performance 
behavior. 
 The extracted physical parameters are in agreement with 
those published in literature.
