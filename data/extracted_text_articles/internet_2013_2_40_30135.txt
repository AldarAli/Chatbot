Abstract—In this study, we compare answers in a Q&A site
with messages in a micro blog and discuss how we use unsounded
code strings at the end of online messages. We ﬁrst show that
unsounded code strings at the end of answers in a Q&A site
are used not only smooth communication but an other purpose,
minimum length limit avoidance. Next, we show that the length
of unsounded code strings at the end of answers in a Q&A
site, which are used for smooth communication, have a similar
distribution pattern to those of messages in a micro blog. On
the other hand, the length of unsounded code strings used for
minimum length limit avoidance have a different distribution
pattern. In this study, we used the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro, a
widely-used Japanese Q&A site, and twitter for observation and
examination.
Keywords—unsounded code string; micro blog; twitter; Q&A
site; Yahoo! chiebukuro.
I.
INTRODUCTION
We often ﬁnd consecutive unsounded marks and characters
are used at the end of online messages, such as mails, chattings,
and questions and answers in Q&A sites. As a result, it is
important to investigate how these expressions were used.
(exp 1)
sound recorder demo aru teido ha dekiru kedo,
yappari Sound Engine ga osusume kana... (You
may be able to do a lot by using sound recorders,
however, the one I would like to recommend is
Sound Engine...)
(exp 1) is an answer submitted to a Japanese Q&A site, Yahoo!
chiebukuro. In this case, periods are used consecutively at the
end of it. It is because the answerer of (exp 1) is thought to use
the three consecutive periods for expressing his/her opinion
gently, in other words, for smooth communication. In this
study, we deﬁne unsounded marks and characters as unsounded
codes. Furthermore, we deﬁne three or more consecutive
unsounded codes as unsounded code strings. For example, in
Yahoo! chiebukuro, 25 % of answers have unsounded code
strings, in other words, three or more consecutive unsounded
codes at the end of them. Although unsounded code strings
are popular, there are few studies on them. As a result, in this
study, we investigate how we use unsounded code strings at
the end of online messages. Especially, we compare answers
in a Q&A site with messages in a micro blog and discuss
how we use unsounded code strings at the end of online
messages. We used the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro [1], a
widely-used Japanese Q&A site, and twitter for observation
and examination. The results of this study will give us a
chance to understand the usage of unsounded code strings, and
the purposes and behaviors of users in online communities.
Especially, the results could be useful to predict and analyze
the impacts of communication constraints on users’ messages
and communications.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we surveys the related works. In Section III, we describes
how unsounded code strings used at the end of answers in a
Q&A site. On the other hand, in Section IV, we describes how
unsounded code strings used at the end of messages in a micro
blog. Finally, in Section V, we present our conclusions.

RELATED WORKS
Emoticons, sometimes called face marks, are a kind of
unsounded code strings. First emoticon, smiley face “;-)”, was
proposed by Scott Fahlman in September 1982 [2]. After his
proposal, many emoticons have been used widely in online
messages, such as email, chat, and newsgroup posts [3]. As a
result, a large number of studies have been made on emoticons.
Many researchers in computational linguistics proposed
methods of extracting and classifying emoticons in online
messages. Inoue et al. analyzed 1000 sentences in email
messages and developed a system which extracted emotional
expressions, especially emoticons, embedded in email mes-
sages [4]. Nakamura et al. proposed a method of learning
emoticons for a natural language dialogue system from chat
dialogue data in the Internet [5]. Tanaka et al. proposed
methods for extracting emoticons in text and classifying them
into some emotional categories [6]. Bedrick et al. proposed
robust emoticon detection method based on weighted context-
free grammars [7]. Hogenboom et al. showed that sentiment
classiﬁcation accuracy was improved by using manually cre-
ated emoticon sentiment lexicon [8].
On the other hand, many researchers in social science
analyzed how we use emoticons in online messages. Wit-
mer and Katzman reported that women use more graphic
accents (emoticons) than men do in their computer-mediated
communication (CMC) [9]. Walther and D’Addario showed
that emoticons’ contributions were outweighed by verbal
content [10]. Derks et al. reported emoticons are useful in
strengthening the intensity of a verbal message [11]. Byron
and Baldridge reported readers were likely to rate sender’s
emails more likeable if they used emoticons [12]. Harada
discussed how Japanese speakers use emoticons for promoting
communication smoothly from the viewpoint of politeness

[13]. Kato et al. analyzed positive and negative emoticons
and reported that negative emoticons are misinterpreted more
frequently than positive ones [14]. Furthermore, Kato et al.
reported that emoticons are used more frequently between
close friends than ordinary acquaintances [15].
We think emoticons are a kind of unsounded code strings,
however, there are few studies on other kinds of unsounded
code strings. As a result, we should investigate not only
emoticons but other kinds of unsounded code strings. The
results of this study will give us a chance to understand the
purposes and behaviors of users in online communities.
III.
UNSOUNDED CODE STRINGS AT THE END OF
ANSWERS IN A Q&A SITE
In this section, we discuss unsounded code strings at the
end of answers submitted to a Q&A site.
Before we deﬁne a unsounded code string, we explain the
data of Yahoo! chiebukuro, which we used for investigating
unsounded code strings in a Q&A site. Yahoo! chiebukuro is
a Japanese version of Yahoo! answers and one of the most
popular Q&A sites in Japan. In Yahoo! chiebukuro, each user
can submit his/her answer only one time to one question. (Each
questioner is requested to determine which answer to his/her
question is best. The selected answer is called best answer.)
The data of Yahoo! chiebukuro was published by Yahoo!
JAPAN via National Institute of Informatics in 2007 [16].
This data consists of about 3.11 million questions and 13.47
million answers which were posted on Yahoo! chiebukuro
from April/2004 to October/2005. In the data, each question
has at least one answer because questions with no answers
were removed. In order to avoid identifying individuals, user
accounts were replaced with unique ID numbers. By using
these ID numbers, we can trace any user’s questions and
answers in the data. Table I shows the numbers of users and
their questions and answers in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro.
Next, we deﬁne an unsounded code and unsounded code
strings. In this study, we deﬁne that an unsounded code
string is three or more consecutive unsounded codes. In this
study, unsounded codes are limited to the following marks and
characters:
•
punctuation marks,
•
Greek characters,
•
Cyrillic characters, and
•
ruled lines.
These marks and characters are generally unsounded when
they are used at the end of Japanese sentences. We observed
unsounded code strings at the end of answers submitted to
Yahoo! chiebukuro, and found they were used for
1)
smooth communications
(exp 2)
koko ni kaki shirushita bunmen wo sonomama
kanojyo ni misete ageru koto wo osusume shi-
masu. futari no aida ni shinrai kankei ga kizukete
iru nara kitto daijyobu!!! (You had better show
what you described here to your girl friend with
no change at all. If you have a trust relationship
with her, you don’t worry!!!)
2)
minimum length limit avoidance
(exp 3)
alumi foiru ni tsutsun de hi no naka ni
pon!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Wrap aluminum foil around and
pop it into a ﬁre!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
The minimum length limit was introduced into Yahoo!
chiebukuro in May/2004. Due to this limit, users in Yahoo!
chiebukuro are prohibited from submitting answers less than
25 multibyte characters long. In this rule, one single byte
character is counted as 0.5 multibyte character. In order to
avoid this limit, the answerer of (exp 3) used 13 “!” at the
end of his/her answer. We may note that, in case of Japanese
texts, the length of words and sentences are generally counted
by multibyte characters. In this study, single byte characters
are counted as 0.5 multibyte characters.
Table II shows the number of answerers, answers, and
best answers, in case of all the answers submitted to Yahoo!
chiebukuro, and answers which have unsounded code strings
at the end of them.
Figure 1 shows the cumulative relative frequency distribu-
tion of
•
the length of all the answers,
•
the length of answers which have unsounded code
strings at the end of them, and
•
the length of unsounded code strings.
As shown in Figure 1, the median of the length of unsounded
code strings at the end of answers is 10 multibyte characters.

The heatmap which shows the association between the length of
unsounded code string at the end of answers and the other part of the answers.
This value is more than twice the length of unsounded code
strings at the end of (exp 1) and (exp 2). We think that it is too
long for smooth communication. As a result, we investigate the
association between the length of unsounded code string at the
end of answers and the other part of them. The result is shown
in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the heatmap shows the association
between the length of unsounded code string at the end of
answers and the other part of the answers. In the heatmap,
darker color denotes more frequent data element. The heatmap
shows long unsounded code strings at the end of answers are
mainly used when the other part of the answers are less than
25 multibyte characters long. Furthermore, unsounded code
strings at the end of the answers come in a variety of lengths,
however, the sum of the length of unsounded code string at
the end and the other part of them, in other words, the length
of the answers are frequently 25–30 multibyte characters long.

than 25 multibyte characters long, unsounded code strings at
the end of the answers are mainly 3–4 multibyte characters
long, and the answers come in a variety of lengths. It may be
said that the usage of unsounded code strings at the end of
answers differs greatly depending on whether the other part of
the answers are less than 25 multibyte characters long. As a
result, we divided answers which have unsounded code strings
at the end of them into
•
answers the length of which are less than 25 multibyte
characters (excluding unsounded code strings at the
end of them)
•
answers the length of which are 25 multibyte char-

and investigated them in the following points:
•
the number of answerers, answers, and best answers
(Table III),
•
the length of answers and unsounded code strings at
the end (Figure 3 and Figure 4),
First, we discuss answers the length of which are less than
25 multibyte characters (excluding unsounded code strings
at the end of them). In case of these answers, unsounded
code strings at the end of them were used for avoiding the
minimum length limit. This limit is a special problem in
Yahoo! chiebukuro, not introduced into twitter. As a result,
we do not compare unsounded code strings for avoiding the
minimum length limit with those used in online messages of
twitter.
Next, we discuss answers the length of which are 25
multibyte characters or longer (excluding unsounded code
strings at the end of them). In case of these answers, unsounded
code strings at the end of them were used for smooth commu-
nication, not for minimum length limit avoidance. As shown
in Figure 4, the length of these answers (excluding unsounded
code strings at the end of them) have a distribution similar to
those of all the answers submitted to Yahoo! chiebukuro. As
a result, it may be said that, when the length of answers are
25 multibyte characters or longer (excluding unsounded code
strings at the end of them), the length of these answers are
less affected by whether unsounded code strings are used at
the end of them. We compare these unsounded code strings
with those used in online messages of twitter.

UNSOUNDED CODE STRINGS AT THE END OF
MESSAGES IN A MICRO BLOG
In order to compare with unsounded code strings at the end
of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro, we investigate unsounded
code strings at the end of messages in twitter. We obtained
messages submitted to twitter, in other words, tweets by using
the streaming API. However, the streaming API allows us to
obtain only 1% of all public streamed tweets because of API
restriction. We used the streaming API and obtained 7,084,183
Japanese tweets in three weeks in November and December
2012. These tweets can be classiﬁed into three types:
•
reply
A reply to a particular user. It contains “@username”
in the body of the tweet.
•
retweet
A retweet is a reply to a tweet that includes the original
message.
•
normal tweet

A normal tweet is neither reply, nor retweet.
Table IV shows the number of normal tweets, replies, and
retweets. From these tweets, we extracted 1,152,443 tweets
which have unsounded code strings at the end of them. These
1,152,443 tweets are 16.27% of all the tweets. Table V shows
the number of normal tweets, replies, and retweets which have
unsounded code strings at the end of them. As shown in Table
IV and Table V, 45.75% of tweets which have unsounded code
strings at the end of them are replies while 35.54% of all the
tweets are replies. As a result, replies have unsounded code
strings at the end of them more frequently than other kinds of
tweets. It is because each reply is sent to a particular person.
When we send a message to a particular person, we generally
try to avoid unnecessary frictions with him/her. As a result,
we use unsounded code strings at the end of our replies more
frequently than other kinds of tweets.
Before we discuss unsounded code strings at the end of
tweets, we remove retweets. It is because, messages in retweets
are created not by submitters, but by other users. As a result,
retweets are inadequate to investigate how we use unsounded
code strings at the end of online messages. Figure 5 shows the
cumulative relative frequency distribution of
•
the length of all the tweets (excluding retweets),
•
the length of tweets (excluding retweets) which have
unsounded code strings at the end of them, and
•
the length of unsounded code strings at the end of
tweets (excluding retweets).
In Figure 6, the heatmap shows the association between the
length of unsounded code string at the end of tweets and
the other part of the tweets. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show
unsounded code strings at the end of the tweets are mainly 3–4
multibyte characters long, and the tweets come in a variety of
lengths. The length of unsounded code strings at the end of
tweets have a similar distribution pattern to those of answers
in Yahoo! chiebukuro, which are 25 multibyte characters or
longer (excluding unsounded code strings at the end of them).
As a result, unsounded code strings at the end of online
messages are mainly 3–4 multibyte characters long when they
are used for smooth communications with particular persons.
Next, we discuss unsounded code strings at the end of
normal tweets and replies, individually. Figure 7 shows the
cumulative relative frequency distribution of the length of all
the normal tweets, the length of normal tweets which have un-
sounded code strings at the end of them (excluding unsounded
code strings at the end of them), and the length of unsounded
code strings at the end of normal tweets. Also, Figure 8 shows
the cumulative relative frequency distribution of the length of
all the replies, the length of replies which have unsounded code

strings at the end of them (excluding unsounded code strings
at the end of them), and the length of unsounded code strings
at the end of replies. As shown in Figure 8, there are few short
replies, especially less than 5 multibyte long. It is because each
reply includes “@username”. Also, as shown in Figure 8, the
length of replies which have unsounded code strings at the end
of them have a similar distribution pattern to the length of all
the replies. It may be said that the length of replies are less
affected by whether unsounded code strings are used at the
end of them. This result is similar to the result obtained when
we investigated answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro. The length
of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro, which are 25 multibyte
characters or longer (excluding unsounded code strings at the
end of them), are less affected by whether unsounded code
strings are used at the end of them. In both cases of Yahoo!
chiebukuro and twitter, unsounded code strings are used for
smooth communication with particular persons. As a result,
it may also be said that the length of online messages to
particular persons are less affected by whether unsounded code
strings for smooth communication are used at the end of them.
On the other hand, as shown in Figure 7, the length of normal
tweets which have unsounded code strings at the end of them
have a slightly different distribution pattern to the length of
all the normal tweets. It is because there are many normal
tweets each of which was sent to general public, not to a

a particular person, tend to be long because we intend to avoid
unnecessary misunderstanding. On the other hand, a message
to a particular person is sometimes short. As a result, the
distribution of the length of all the normal tweets shifts to
longer ranges than the length of normal tweets which have
unsounded code strings at the end of them.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated unsounded code strings at the
end of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro and tweets in twitter.
Although unsounded code strings are popular, there were few
studies on them.
In twitter, unsounded code strings at the end of tweets are
used for smooth communication. On the other hand, in Yahoo!
chiebukuro, unsounded code strings at the end of answers
are used for not only smooth communication but minimum
length limit avoidance. The minimum length limit is a special
problem in Yahoo! chiebukuro, not introduced into twitter. We
showed that the usage of unsounded code strings at the end
of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro differs greatly depending on

whether answers are longer than the minimum length limit.
When answers are longer than the minimum length limit,
unsounded code strings at the end of them are used for smooth
communication. In this case, the length of the unsounded code
strings at the end of answers have a similar distribution pattern
to the length of unsounded code strings at the end of tweets.
Unsounded code strings at the end of the tweets in twitter
and answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro, which are longer than the
minimum length limit, are mainly 3–4 multibyte characters
long. Furthermore, we showed the length of replies in twitter
and answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro, which are larger than the
minimum length limit, are less affected by whether unsounded
code strings are used at the end of them.
In this study, we analyzed and compared unsounded code
strings only in answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro and tweets in
twitter. However, it is not enough to obtain general knowledge
about unsounded code strings. It is because both of Yahoo!
chiebukuro and twitter have character length limits: Yahoo!
chiebukuro has a minimum character length limit, on the other
hand, twitter has a maximum character length limit. As a result,
we intend to analyze unsounded code strings in a computer
aided communication media which has no character length
limit.
