Abstract—Wireless networks have recently gained on signif-
icance. In environments where it is impossible to build tra-
ditional infrastructure wireless networks, ad hoc and wireless
mesh networks are used. The purpose of this paper is to eval-
uate certain multicast routing algorithms used in ad hoc and
wireless mesh networks. The ﬁrst part of the paper addresses
the subject of ad hoc and wireless mesh networks, as well
as the issue of multicasting in these networks. Furthermore,
the paper contains a review of routing algorithms. In the last
part of the paper the conducted research is presented and a
multicast algorithms with the best performance in WMNs is
chosen.

I. INTRODUCTION
The growing need for unlimited Internet access and the
constant progress in terms of developing new technologies
(e.g., smartphones, tablets) caused a considerable develop-
ment of wireless computer networks. Thanks to this method,
access to the Internet has become less expensive, which, in
turn, has been followed by a rapid growth in the number of
people using it.
Until recently, there have been two basic approaches to
creating wireless computer networks: infrastructure and ad
hoc. Infrastructure mode requires the use of wireless access
points that act as a go-between in conveying information
and provide control over the process of communication. In
contrast, wireless network operating in ad hoc mode does
not require any superior or control devices - every device
connected to this network may fulﬁll the same functions.
However, in ad hoc networks, all devices have limited
resources - not only energy, but also bandwidth.
The purpose of this research is to examine and compare
algorithms and protocols being used in Wireless Mesh
Networks in homogeneous conditions and the same param-
eters. The motivation for this study is the lack of such a
comparison in subject literature.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
wireless mesh networks (WMN). The next section presents
multicast algorithms and algorithms used in WMN. The
following section shows simulation parameters whereas the
results are discussed in Section V. Finally, Section VI
concludes the paper.
II. WIRELESS MESH NETWORKS
There are three main types of ad hoc networks (Fig. 1).
A. Mobile ad hoc Networks (MANETs)
One of the most popular applications of ad hoc networks
is using them as mobile networks. Mobile ad hoc network
is created dynamically by a group of mobile devices with-
out any assistance of the existing infrastructure. In such
a network, devices communicate between one another by
pursuing one or more hops (Fig. 2).
Figure 1.
Types of ad hoc networks
Main advantages of MANETs are their ﬂexibility deriving
from their dynamic structure and independence of any ﬁxed
infrastructure. Unfortunately, it comes with a price, because
mobility of devices connected to such a network inﬂuences
the way of designing routing algorithms and algorithms for
these networks - mainly because such networks are less
stable and prone to disconnect. In the case of proactive
algorithms, the status of the network has to be refreshed
quickly enough to keep up with changes in the structure of
the network. If this requirement is not met, the packet loss
may increase on the one hand, but on the other, refreshing
topology information too often may inﬂuence the links load
and reduce effectiveness of network resources usage. Thus,
on-demand (reactive) routing algorithms are much more
efﬁcient and give better results in such networks.

B. Wireless Sensor Networks - WSNs
A network that consists of spatially distributed au-
tonomous sensors that perform common tasks is called a
sensor network. Usually, these types of networks are used
to monitor environmental conditions, such as temperature,
humidity, pressure, etc. Every single sensor has the ability
62

to process data and send them wirelessly to other sensors in
range. The development of WSNs was motivated by military
applications - for intelligence, battleﬁeld monitoring, etc.
Nowadays they are also used in consumer applications, such
as security monitoring, monitoring weather conditions or
even trafﬁc.
C. Wireless Mesh Networks -WMNs
Wireless Mesh Network is a very speciﬁc ad hoc network,
which consists of two basic elements: mesh backbone and
customers (Fig. 3). WMNs are the most static ad hoc
networks when it comes to topology and structure. The
backbone is created between wireless, but static, mesh
routers (MRs), which have neither bandwidth nor energy
limits. Some of MRs, which have a cable connection to
the Internet, are called Internet gateways (IGWs) - which
resembles access points in a traditional infrastructure mode.
In addition, reliability of the network is improved by trans-
mitting data between nodes in a mesh way, which, when
combined with being independent from the local infrastruc-
ture, makes WMNs perfect to be applied in places where
building a traditional cable network infrastructure would be
too expensive or impossible (e.g., desert).
Due to the fact that nodes creating a backbone of the
network are mostly stationary, routing methods that establish
a permanent connection between multiple nodes, may be
applied. In the majority of cases, there is no direct con-
nection between each node in WMN, but they are able
to communicate using neighboring nodes. What is more,
WMNs have the ability of self-conﬁguration and repair in
case the position of a node changed or nodes were added or
removed.
As WMNs, similarly to ad hoc networks, do not depend
on the available telecommunications infrastructure, they are
a very good choice whenever a decentralization is required.
Moreover, they may be used wherever it is necessary to
quickly restore communication, e.g., in natural disaster
areas, where telecommunications infrastructure has been
damaged or destroyed.

III. MULTICAST ROUTING
A. Types of transmission in packet networks
In packet networks using Internet Protocol we can dis-
tinguish four main types of transmission as far as the way
of delivering information is concerned: unicast, broadcast,
anycast, and multicast.
Multicast transmission is based on sending the same data
stream to multiple receivers. Its main advantage is that even
though the information is sent to a group of receivers,
it is transmitted by each network link only once, which
saves considerable amount of bandwidth and energy and
eliminates the need for sending multiple copies of the data.
To be able to use multicast in WMNs it is necessary to
implement algorithms generating a structure of the network
as well as ones choosing optimal routes between devices.
In subject literature, ’algorithm’ and ’protocol’ deﬁnitions
are often used in an ambiguous way. In this article, authors
assume that only such a solution should be referred to as
’protocol’, for which a least state machine is deﬁned.
B. Multicast routing in MANETs
Multicast routing algorithms are divided into the three
following groups: mesh-based, tree-based and hybrid.
Mesh-based algorithms are recognized as the most reli-
able, because they create a structure in which more than
only one path can connect the sender with the receiver.
In tree-based algorithms only one path from sender to
receiver exists, but it makes the routing much more effective
and eliminates the possibility of loops occurring in the
network. Moreover, both - the sender (sender-initiated) and
the receiver (receiver-initiated) may initiate creation of the
multicast tree.
Typical tree-based algorithms are: MAODV [1] and
AMRIS [2], whereas typical mesh-based algorithms are:
ODMPR [3] and CAMP [4]. The existing research [5] shows
that in MANET environments, where changes in topology
are common, mesh-based algorithms show better results
than tree-based algorithms, which is due to the existence
of redundant links in the mesh structure.
As this paper presents only the initial stage of this
research, only mesh- and tree-based protocols are analyzed.
C. Multicast routing in WMNs
Wireless Mesh Networks are a relatively new wireless
technology and that is why the available literature does not
show any recent research studies that would compare the
existing multicast routing algorithms. One of the ﬁrst studies
on the topic is [8], in which Ruiz states that the shortest path
tree (SPT) algorithm does not work well for WMNs and
proposes minimum number of transitions (MNT) algorithm
that focuses on using properties of multicast transmission to
reduce the number of transmissions necessary to reach all
nodes in a tree.
In [6], Nguyen and Xu present their analysis on ef-
fectiveness of Minimal Coverability Tree (MCT) and SPT
algorithms. The research shows that SPT algorithms are
much more efﬁcient than MCT algorithms.
Moreover, two multicast algorithms for WMNs, i.e., Level
Channel Assignment (LCA) and Multi-Channel Multicast
(MCM) are introduced in [7]. These algorithms aim not only
to increase throughput in WMNs, but also to minimize the
number of hops in a tree. Multicast mesh tree is created by
dividing routers to different levels using Breadth First Search
(BFS) algorithm as well as heuristic channel allocation to
different radio interfaces.
Zhao, et al. [8] proposes Gateway Associated Multicast
Protocol (GAMP), which was created to improve Quality
of Service (QoS) in Wireless Mesh Networks. GAMP is
63

a hybrid algorithm, because the sender broadcasts Hello
messages to all active access nodes and when a receiver
wants to join a group, it sends a connection message to the
access node (on-demand).
D. Algorithms chosen for the simulation
Several factors were taken into consideration while choos-
ing speciﬁc multicast routing algorithms for the research:
clarity and granularity of the description of an algorithm,
comparability to other algorithms and complexity of the
implementation. Basing on the aforementioned criteria, the
following algorithms were chosen: MAODV (MANETs),
ODMPR (MANETs), MNT (WMNs), MCM (WMNs), LCA
(WMNs). However, the LCA algorithm was omitted because
its comparison with the MCM algorithm is available [7]
and shows that the MCM algorithm gives better results than
LCA.
E. Description of the algorithms and protocols
Multicast Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (MAODV)
MAODV [1] is a reactive (on-demand) tree-based algorithm.
It enables fully dynamic and multi-hop routing between
mobile nodes willing to join a multicast group in ad hoc net-
works. What makes this algorithm different from the other
ad hoc multicast routing algorithms is that each multicast
group has its own sequence number assigned by a group
leader (root of the tree). This number increases in time,
what guarantees choosing always the most up-to-date paths,
because nodes choose paths with the highest sequence. What
is more, the group leader sends Group Hello messages to all
members of the group to update its status.
Because MAODV is a reactive (on-demand) algorithm,
as long as the connection between members of a multicast
group is preserved, no actions are taken. Each node monitors
the state of next-hop links, which is why in the case any path
fails, it may be quickly restored.
On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP)
ODMRP [3] is an mesh-based algorithm which implements
forwarding group concept for multicast routing. It means
that only some nodes of the multicast group may forward
and transmit packets. The topology of the whole network is
never stored anywhere, which means that user management
is dynamic and on-demand. For managing routing activities,
it requires storing some data structures, such as: routing
table, forwarding group table, group members table and
message cache in different types of nodes.
To keep the mesh structure in the most up-to-date state,
soft state approach is used. This means that in the case
a source wants to leave the multicast group, it just stops
broadcasting Join Query messages and, if a receiver wants
to leave a group, it stops broadcasting Join Reply messages.
After some time, a timeout occurs.
Minimum number of transmissions (MNT)
MNT algorithm is described in [9]. According to Ruiz, the
general assumption that Steiners tree is a tree of minimal
cost, is not necessarily true in WMNs. Ruiz redeﬁnes the
issue of multicast tree minimization in ad hoc networks to
reduce the amount of data transmission. Existing calcula-
tions explicitly assume that, given node v, it is necessary to
send multicast data k-times to reach k-neighbors of the node
v. However, using multicast transmission, it is enough to
send multicast transmission only once to reach any number
of nodes v neighbors. Thus, the minimal cost tree is not
the one which stores the lowest cost of each edge, but the
one connecting senders and receivers in the least number of
transmissions needed. This type of structure has been deﬁned
by Ruiz as minimal data overhead tree.
Multi-Channel Multicast (MCM)
MCM ﬁrst builds a multicast structure by minimizing the
number of relay nodes and hop count distances between the
source and destinations, and then uses dedicated channel
assignment strategies to improve the network capacity by
reducing interference [7]. The authors of the algorithm have
made an observation that when all the nodes have multiple
radio interfaces, the multicast problem becomes, in fact, a
special case of broadcast.
The ﬁrst step of MCM is realized by breadth ﬁrst search
(BFS) algorithm. Then, all edges between any two nodes of
the same level are deleted and a tree mesh is built.
In the second step of the algorithm, the minimal number
of relay nodes forming a broadcast tree is identiﬁed. In the
tree mesh one node may have more than one parent. The
purpose of this step is to identify the only parent for each
node, so that the number of relay nodes stays minimal.
After creating a multicast structure thanks to which each
multi-receiver may connect with the gateway through min-
imal hop count distance, the algorithm assigns channels to
the interfaces of the tree nodes using two allocation algo-
rithms: ascending channel allocation and heuristic channel
allocation [7].
IV. SIMULATION PARAMETERS
The quality of the simulation is directly related to a
simulation model. In the case of WMNs, this model is
complicated and consists of ﬁve sub-models:
• node - deﬁning its hardware and software,
• arrangement and mobility (of the topology) - it
ensures proper arrangement of nodes,
• radio - describing characteristics of the radio interface
of a node,
• propagational - describing attenuation and radio chan-
nel characteristics,
• trafﬁc - deﬁning trafﬁc in the network.
Some of the sub-models are based on actual measurements,
e.g., propagational and trafﬁc. The rest is synthetic and
arbitrary, like the topology generator.
A. Network topology generator
In this study, as a topology generator, we use the algorithm
called Node Placement Algorithm for Realistic Topologies
(NPART) [10] to preserve reality of the generated topology.
The NPART algorithm was created on the basis of the
measurements conducted on actual active WMNs in Berlin
and Leipzig. The authors of NPART proposed this algorithm
because they made an observation that it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
an algorithm with output similar to real networks.
B. Network topology used in simulations
It is assumed that nodes are allocated on a plane 1000 x
1000 units and that the communication radius is 100. The
cost of each connection varies between 10 and 100 and the
delay metrics is the Euclidean distance between nodes. For
the simulation to be as realistic as possible, 1000 topologies
have been generated.

C. Parameters of the simulation
Node count. The total number of nodes in the network
is a very important parameter in the process of building
structures by multicast routing algorithms. In the study,
networks of 50, 100, 150 and 200 nodes were analyzed.
The number of multicast groups. In real WMNs, any
number of multicast groups may exist. However, to simplify
the analysis of the results, only one multicast group will
exist in a simulated network.
The size of a multicast group. As the multicast group
grows, ﬁnding the optimal structure becomes more time-
consuming and requires more hardware resources. Groups
of 5, 10, 15 and 20 nodes were examined in the research.
D. Parameters of multicast routing examined in the research
study
The mean path length between the sender and a mul-
ticast group. Multicast routing algorithms create a structure
that enables the most efﬁcient transmission between sending
and receiving nodes in WMNs. It is expected that the paths
will be as short as possible, which means as few relaying
nodes as possible. Each relaying node increases the risk of
path breakdown and introduces additional delay and cost. In
this research, the mean path length parameter is calculated
by adding up all path lengths between sender and each
separate node of a multicast group and dividing the result
by the number of nodes in the particular multicast group.
The path length is expressed in the number of edges (NE)
between the sender and the receiver.
The mean path cost between the sender and a multi-
cast group. The value of this attribute reﬂects the whole
set of parameters describing a cost of creating an edge
between two nodes. As such a parameter we could assume,
for example, bandwidth required for the transmission to be
successful. In simulations conducted in this research, the
cost of each connection varies between 10 and 100 and is
chosen in a random way. Thus, the mean path cost parameter
is calculated by adding up all path costs between sender
and each separate node of a multicast group and dividing
the result by the number of nodes in the particular multicast
group. The cost of the path is expressed in Cost Unit (CU).
The mean path delay between the sender and a
multicast group. It is desirable for delays in a transmission
between the sender and the receiver to be minimal in most
cases of modern multicast connections applications. Delay is
a time necessary to transmit data from one node to the other.
In this paper, delay metrics is assumed to be the Euclidean
distance between two nodes and is expressed in Delay Units
(DU). Thus, the mean path delay parameter is calculated by
adding up all path delays between sender and each separate
node of a multicast group and dividing the result by the
number of nodes in the particular multicast group.
V. RESULTS
A. The inﬂuence of network size on the performance of
multicast algorithms
The inﬂuence of the number of nodes on the performance
of multicast algorithms was examined ﬁrst. The results are
shown below – Figs. 4-6.
The results clearly show that MNT algorithm stands out
as compared to other algorithms. This is due to the speciﬁc
way the algorithm decides to create a path. MNT chooses
nodes which cover as many receivers as possible and takes
into consideration the rest of the parameters afterwards.

Concluding, although there are differences between the
algorithms, in some cases ODMRP, MAODV and MCM
performance is similar. Considering all of the parameters
examined, the MAODV algorithm performed slightly better
than the others, whereas MNT proved to be the least
effective.
B. The inﬂuence of the multicast group size on performance
of multicast algorithms
The study of the inﬂuence of the multicast group size on
the performance of multicast algorithms was performed for
50, 100, 150 and 200 nodes and for group sizes of: 5, 10,
15 and 20 (Figs. 7-14).
Network consisting of 50 nodes. Figs. 7 and 10 show that
the mean path cost is similar for each algorithm. Together
with the growth of the receiving group, the cost drops
slightly, which may be caused by the fact that shorter paths
to nodes closer to the source might have appeared. Only in
the case of the MNT algorithm, the path cost decrease is
less dynamic, but this is caused by the algorithm of path

construction. The increase in path delay, cost and length
for 15 receiving nodes is not surprising, because the values
should ﬂuctuate within certain range.
Network consisting of 100 nodes. In the network con-
sisting of 100 nodes the mean path cost and delay change
in a different way than in a smaller network. Figs. 8 and 11
show the values of these parameters that seem to stay within
a certain range for all of the algorithms except for MNT. As
suspected, MNT behaved in a different way - values of the
mean cost, delay and path length increase almost steadily.
Network consisting of 150 nodes. In the case of a
network consisting of 150 nodes, an improvement may be
observed as compared to a network consisting of 100 nodes.
MAODV, ODMRP and MCM algorithms show a signiﬁcant
drop in the mean path delay and cost (Figs. 9 and 12).
Even though it may indicate that these algorithms are very
effective in large networks with an increasing number of
receivers, it might also mean that members of multicast
groups were chosen in an unfavorable way.
Network consisting of 200 nodes. The results of the
evaluation for the network consisting of 200 nodes conﬁrm
the previous ﬁndings and are presented in Figs. 13 and 14.
C. Conclusions
Despite the differences between ODMRP (mesh-type),
MAODV (tree-type) and MCM (tree-type) algorithms their
performance is comparable. However, it should be pointed
out that as the best candidate to be used in multicast routing
the MAODV algorithm should be chosen. The analysis and
research conducted in this paper show that this algorithm,
from among all the tested algorithms, offers the lowest mean
path cost (Fig. 15) and the lowest mean path lengths (Fig.
16), only performing slightly weaker than ODMPR as when
comes to the lowest mean path delay (Fig. 17).
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
The paper presents performance evaluation of the selected
multicast routing algorithms for WMNs. The most interest-
ing results were obtained for MAODV and MNT algorithms.
MAODV uses a tree structure to operate, which makes
its efﬁciency in WMNs surprising, because the nature of
WMNs suggests that mesh-based algorithms should perform
better in these networks. Moreover, MAODV was not de-
signed for WMNs, but for ad hoc networks. This makes
MNT algorithms results even more peculiar, because it is
a mesh-based algorithm speciﬁcally designed for a multi-
hop environment. However, the analysis of the mechanisms
used by this algorithm suggests that it is not possible for
this algorithm to achieve results even remotely comparable
to other tested algorithms.
It is worth mentioning that the MAODV algorithm is used
as an example of a multicast routing algorithm by the IEEE
802.11s workgroup responsible for standardizing Wireless
Mesh Networks. This paper presents the initial stage of the
research during which the authors evaluated and compared
discussed in literature protocols and algorithms for WMNs.
Considering the fact that this paper analyzes only mesh- and
tree-based protocols, further papers on the topic of hybrid
protocols in WMNs shall follow. In the next stage of this
research, the most efﬁcient algorithms will be compared to
the solutions proposed by the authors.
