Abstract—People suffering from neurodegenerative disorders, 
such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), can eventually 
present great disabilities. In some cases, these patients lose all 
possibility to communicate with the external world via 
common muscular channels, being the only alternative the use 
of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system, which transforms 
brain activity into external commands. A P300-speller is a 
typical Brain-Computer Interface system for communication 
purpose. In order to facilitate the communication, it is very 
important to adapt the speller to each patient. The most 
popular platforms to develop P300 speller are BCI2000, 
OpenVibe and UMA-BCI Speller. The goal of this study was to 
evaluate the usability of the three proposed platforms in terms 
of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. To this end, three 
participants had to configure a specific speller layout using the 
3 platforms. The obtained results indicated that the UMA-BCI 
Speller platform presented the highest level of usability, 
following by the BCI2000 and finally, the OpenVibe platform. 
In this sense, the UMA-BCI Speller seems to be an easy 
application to use, providing many options and allowing to 
configure any speller layout in an easy way.

INTRODUCTION 
People suffering from neurodegenerative disorders, such 
as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), can eventually 
present great disabilities, particularly those involving the 
motor system. In some cases, such deficiencies can be really 
severe, to the point of causing total loss of control of the 
muscles that are responsible of voluntary body movements, 
including eye movement and breathing itself. People 
suffering from such disabilities lose all possibility to 
communicate with the external world via common muscular 
channels. Their only alternative is to use a Brain-Computer 
Interface (BCI) system [1], which transforms brain activity 
into commands that are interpreted by a machine. Such a 
system offers a non-muscular channel for these users to 
interact with their environment, thus providing them with 
greater autonomy in their daily lives. 
The most widely used BCI systems are those based on 
electroencephalographic (EEG) signal recording, due to its 
non-invasiveness, but also to its good temporal resolution 
and ease of use. Three types of EEG-based BCI systems 
have been used for communication purposes, namely those 
based on: (a) slow cortical potentials (SCPs), (b) P300 
event-related potentials (ERP), and (c) sensorimotor 
rhythms (SMR) [2]. BCIs based on SCP and SMR demand 
that users are extensively trained before they show sufficient 
control of their brain activity. In contrast, BCIs based on 
P300 rely on a common, expected human response to 
infrequent target stimuli—usually visual—and thus require 
minimal training. The P300 signal, recorded over the central 
and parietal regions, is a positive deflection of brain wave at 
a latency of about 300 ms after stimulus presentation. 
The main applications of P300-based BCI systems are 
aimed at communication purposes. They are based on the 
P300 speller first developed by Farwell and Donchin [3], 
which is still referenced and intensely studied. In this BCI, a 
6 x 6 matrix of letters, arranged in rows and columns, is 
shown to the subject. The user focuses his/her attention on 
the matrix element he/she wishes to select as each row and 
column is flashed (i.e., intensified) randomly, one after the 
other. After a number of flashes, the symbol that the user 
was supposedly attending at is presented on screen. 
In order to study variations and alternative paradigms, it 
is very important to be able to configure the different 
elements of the speller, such as the size, color, characters, 
images, etc. Besides, a configurable speller would be adapt 
to each patient to facilitate the communication. 
The most popular platforms to develop P300 speller are 
BCI2000 [4] and OpenViBE [5]. Both are widely used, with 
up-to-date software releases, documentation and support. 
These two platforms are intended to build end user BCI 
applications, however, they still require technical skills in 
order to implement a P300 speller. As both are general-
purpose platforms, with a high degree of configurability, it 
may be complex to parameterize them in order to obtain the 
desired speller. Recently, the BCI research group of the 
University of Malaga (UMA-BCI) decided to implement a 
BCI system platform based on a P300 speller, which is easy 
to use and flexible enough to configure any spellers. This 
platform is called UMA-BCI Speller [6]. 
The official ISO 9241-11 definition of usability is: “the 
extent to which a product can be used by specified users to 
achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and

satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition 
involves three measures: i) effectiveness (i.e., accuracy and 
completeness of the system with which users achieve set 
goals), ii) efficiency (i.e., resources expended to complete 
goals), and iii) satisfaction (i.e., users’ attitude to complete a 
given task) [7] [8]. 
The goal of this study was to evaluate the usability of the 
three proposed platforms in terms of effectiveness, 
efficiency and satisfaction. The study was focused on the 
feasibility of the three platforms to change the speller 
layout, and not to configure the signal acquisition and 
processing. In fact, signal acquisition and processing 
changes are less frequent that changes in layout interface, 
which are necessary to adapt the communication systems to 
the patients. The obtained results will allow researchers to 
select 
the 
most 
appropriate 
platform 
to 
develop 
communication systems based on P300 spellers for people 
with serious motor function problem, such as, patients 
suffering from ALS. The rest of the paper is structured as 
follows. Section 2 presents the methodologie and the 
material used. Section 3 presents the obtained results abd 
the discussion and, finally, section 4 presents the conclusion 
of the study. 
 
II. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
In this section, a description of the experiment carried out 
to evaluate the usability of the three platforms will be 
described.  
A.  Experimental design 
The objective was to evaluate the feasibility to change 
the configuration of the P300 speller interface, then, it was 
necessary to check the different options available on each 
platform in order to set the configuration of the final speller. 
Once established the final speller layout, the participants 
had to transform the speller of reference (the same than the 
one first developed by Farwell and Donchin, see Figure 1) 
into the final proposed speller. Some days before the test, a 
manual of each platform was provided to the subjects. These 
manuals were specially made for this experiment and 
included only instruction regarding how to make the 
different changes concerning the speller layout.  
 
Figure 1.  Common P300 speller matrix proposed by Farwell and Donchin. 
It consists of a 6 x 6 matrix of grey letters and numbers and black 
background. 
 
Three subjects participated in this study. None of them 
had previous experience with any of the systems and were  
novices to BCI. The three platforms were tested by each 
participant in three different sessions carried out on the 
same day. The time interval between sessions was, at least, 
one hour. The order in which the platforms were tested was 
different for each participant. 
 
B. Advantages and restriction of each platform  
As it was mentioned, in order to propose a final speller 
layout to carry out with each platform, it was necessary to 
test the different options provided by each platform. The 
study of each platform allowed, not only to establish the 
advantages and the restriction of each platform, but also to 
make the manuals for each platform.  
Table 1 summarizes the viability to perform different 
changes in the speller layout for each platform. Each option 
was classified between difficult (D), moderate (M) and easy 
(E).  
 
C. Task and procedure  
Taking into account the different options provided by 
each platform to modify the speller layout, the final layout 
proposed in the experiments is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2.  P300 speller proposed. For each platform, the users were asked 
to change the element´s layout to modify the P300 speller of reference into 
this one. 
 
After reading the manual, the user had to transform the 
speller of reference into the proposed speller. This 
transformation meant to carry out some changes: i) the 
matrix size (to 4x4), ii) the color of the background (to 
purple), iii) the inclusion of some images, iv) the 
configuration of some characters (“A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “1”, 
“2”, “3”, “4”) and v) the color of some cells. 
During the experiments, the users could consult the 
manual provided and did not receive any instruction 
regarding which steps to follow regarding the different 
changes. For each platform, the time available to perform 
the task was 60 minutes. Once finishing the task, the users 
were asked to complete different questionnaires to evaluate 
the usability. 
 
D. Objectives and subjective measures 
As mentioned in the introduction section, the main 
objective of this study was to evaluate the usability of the 
different platform.

The employed usability approach includes three 
dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. 
Effectiveness is related to the accuracy with which a user 
can complete tasks. In order to study the effectiveness, the 
percentage of correct steps or changes were evaluated. 
Efficiency is related to the resources expended to complete a 
task, i.e., user´s effort and time required. In order to study 
the efficiency, the following metrics were provided: i) the 
subjective workload assessed using NASA-TLX [9]; ii) the 
time required to complete the task. Finally, satisfaction is 
related to the users’ attitude, i.e., the perceived comfort and 
acceptability while using the system. This dimension was 
evaluated through a subjective questionnaire regarding the 
use of each platform. The questionnaire consisted on 5 
statements ranging from 1 to 5: statement S1: the platform is 
unnecessarily complex, statement S2: I would need external 
help to use the platform, statement S3: the platform seemed 
to me tedious to use, statement S4: It was necessary to have 
many knowledge before to use the platform, statement S5: 
the platform was easy to use. Statements S1 to S4 
correspond to negative questions and the range was 
identified by: 1= completely disagree and 5 = completely 
agree. However, statement S5 correspond to a positive 
question and the range was identified in an opposite way, 
i.e.: 1= completely agree and 5 = completely disagree. In 
this sense, for all statements, a low value is always 
favourable.

Regarding the efficiency dimension, Table 3 shows the 
contribution of the total workload (NASA-TLX global score 
ranged from 0 to 100) provoked by the use of the platform 
and the time required to complete the task. 
Finally, regarding the satisfaction dimension, the 
answers given by the participants at the end of each session 
in the usability questionnaire related to the use of the 
platforms are shown in Table 4. 
All users achieved to carry out all the changes in the 
speller layout with the three platforms, except user 1 with 
the OpenVibe platform. This user was able to make only 
80% of the correct changes being, the lack of time, the main 
reason to make all the changes. Effectively, as it can be 
observed in Table 3, user 1 used up, for the OpenVibe 
platform, the maximum time available for the test (60 min). 
The time and total workload required to complete the 
task are metrics to measure the efficiency dimension. Users 
required, on average, only 5 min to complete the task with 
the UMA-BCI Speller platform, being 20 min and 47,6 min 
for BCI2000 and OpenVibe platforms, respectively. These 
times are in concordance with the total workload required 
for users, being low the subjective workload with the UMA-
BCI Speller platform (average: 21,9), high with the 
OpenVibe platform (average: 77,5) and moderate with the 
BCI2000 platform (average: 57,4). According to these 
results, the UMA-BCI Speller platform could be denoted as 
the most efficient. 
Satisfaction has been studied according to six 
dimensions (or statements): complex, help required, tedious, 
knowledge necessary and easy. Each statement was ranging 
from 1 to 5, being the score “1” the most favourable. 
According to Table 3, the UMA-BCI Speller was, once 
again, the platform with the best scores. Except for 
statement S4 for user 2 and 3 with a score of “2”, all the 
statements were scored with “1”, being the average score 
1,13. The average scores between users and statements was 
4,13 and 3 for OpenVibe and BCI2000 platform 
respectively. These results showed that the UMA-BCI 
Speller platform was the most satisfactory and the 
OpenVibe platform, the less. 
This conclusion could be obtained according to statement 
S5: the platform was easy to use. All users considered the 
OpenVibe platform very difficult to use (score 5), however 
they considered the UMA-BCI Speller platform very easy to 
use (score 1), being the difficulty of the BCI2000 platform, 
moderate. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
A P300 speller is a communication system controlled by 
brain activity, being, for some patients, the only option to 
communicate with the external world. To this end, it is very 
important to adapt the speller layout to each patient. In this 
sense, the available platform to configure a P300 speller 
should be easy to use. Despite there are several platforms to 
developed P300 spellers, frequently, users do not have 
information about which platform is more appropriate and 
easy to use. The present work has studied the usability of 
the three most popular platforms to develop P300 speller: 
BCI2000, OpenViBE and UMA-BCI Speller. Despite the 
low number of users, the obtained results allow to order the 
three platforms according to their degree of usability, 
considering the effectiveness, efficacy and satisfaction 
dimensions. The UMA-BCI Speller, recently developed by 
our team at the University of Málaga, offered the best scores 
in all dimensions, being the platform with the highest level 
of usability. The OpenVibe platform was difficult to use for 
naïve users, and then with a low level of usability. These 
results will allow, not only to the community researchers, 
but also to the final users, to select the most appropriate 
platform for developing BCI spellers as adapted as possible 
to the needs of each patient. In the future, we plan to 
increase the number of subjects in order to validate the 
obtained results. Besides, it should be interesting to compare 
the usability of each platform, not only for novices, but also 
for experienced users.
