Abstract—This paper develops a novel approach for selecting a 
strategic supplier that best meets both long-term strategic 
goals and short-term requirements of an auto parts 
manufacturing company in a supply chain. The relative 
importance value of the supplier selection criteria to the 
strategic goals is first assessed by identifying how the criteria 
contribute to the goals. Based on the relative importance value 
of the criteria to the goals, the criteria weights are obtained. 
This strategic goal oriented weighting method is incorporated 
into a Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model. The 
potential contribution of the suppliers to the strategic goals is 
evaluated by the MCDM model. An empirical study on the 
supplier selection problem of the auto parts company is 
conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of 
the approach. The approach has general application in 
selecting a strategic supplier for a supply chain with various 
strategic goals and supplier selection criteria.

 INTRODUCTION 
Supplier selection has become a crucial issue for the 
success of a company in a supply chain, since good suppliers 
can considerably help the company improve its price 
competitiveness [1] and enhance the quality of its products 
[2]. A conventional approach to supplier selection is that a 
company contacts many available suppliers, sends requests 
for quotations for a specific order, evaluates them in terms of 
their quote and performance, and selects the best-performing 
one for the given order [3]. 
Selecting the most suitable supplier among a large 
number of potential suppliers with different levels of 
performance is inherently a Multi-criteria Decision Making 
(MCDM) problem [4]. The supplier selection problem thus 
requires making trade-offs between conflicting quantitative 
and qualitative criteria in order to evaluate the performance 
of the suppliers. Various supplier selection approaches have 
been proposed to meet the short-term requirements of 
customer orders. To select top-performing suppliers that best 
meet the short-term customer orders, the selection criteria 
such as price, quality, delivery, service, and technical 
capability have long been used [5][6] [7][8]. 
To ensure long-term survival and growth, companies 
increasingly want to develop long-term relationships with 
competitive suppliers rather than dealing with many 
suppliers on an order-by-order basis. It is difficult and 
inefficient for the companies to maintain partnerships with 
all available suppliers, as it causes the excessive transaction 
and management costs, and difficulties for key supplier 
development. To develop the long-term relationships with 
suppliers, it is of strategic importance for a company to select 
the strategic supplier that can best meet long-term 
expectations of the company in addition to satisfying the 
short-term requirements of individual orders. No existing 
approaches, however, are available to choose a strategic 
supplier for meeting both long-term strategic goals and short-
term requirements of companies. To fill this important gap, 
this paper presents a new approach for selecting the long-
term strategic supplier that best contributes to both long-term 
strategic goals and short-term requirements of a company. 
To illustrate this approach, an MCDM model with a new 
weighting method is developed to evaluate the potential 
contribution of suppliers to the strategic goals by examining 
the relative importance value of the supplier selection criteria 
to the goals. 
In Section 2, we first present the strategic supplier 
selection problem of an auto parts manufacturing company in 
South Korea (referred to as the KAP company). We then 
develop a new strategic supplier selection approach in the 
context of KAP in Section 3. In Section 4, we conduct an 
empirical study to illustrate the approach. Finally, we discuss 
key findings and practical implications of the study in 
Section 5. 
II. 
THE SUPPLIER SELECTION PROBLEM IN AN AUTO 
PARTS MANUFACTURING COMPANY 
The KAP company is a first-tier auto parts manufacturer 
in South Korea. KAP produces auto parts such as sun roof, 
rail roof, pedal, fuel tank, suspension, axle housing, wheel 
housing, frame parts, lamp parts, and FRT cowl parts. KAP 
receives materials and components from about 160 suppliers 
for manufacturing auto parts, and supplies the auto parts to 
four major Korean auto companies including Hyundai, Kia, 
Renault Samsung, and GM Daewoo as a first vendor. KAP 
has eight domestic factories located all over the country and 
the purchasing division of each KAP factory selects its 
suppliers close to the factory for transportation cost reduction. 
Thus, most of the 160 suppliers of KAP are small and spread 
allover the country. This creates many low quality suppliers 
and causes the excessive transaction expenses for KAP to 
deal with many minor suppliers. Very often a customer order 
is met by many suppliers with small quantities. This makes

the qualified suppliers have less opportunity to develop as a 
major supplier by constantly receiving many orders with 
large quantities. In this regard, KAP wants to develop a small 
number of long-term suppliers. In addition, developing long-
term relationships with competitive suppliers gives KAP 
substantial benefits such as product cost reduction, quality 
insurance, product commonality and risk reduction of 
product liability. To address this issue, there is an urgent 
need for KAP to have a strategic plan for developing long-
term strategic suppliers. 
Table 1 shows the strategic goals Gk (k=1, 2, …, 10) and 
their weights wk given by KAP in relation to its strategic plan 
for supplier selection. KAP considers achieving profitability 
(G1), coercive power for supplier management (G4) and 
long-term relationship between KAP and its suppliers (G5) as 
the most important goals with regard to supplier selection. 
Development of large suppliers (G2) and minimisation of 
product costs (G3) are also important strategic goals, as they 
affect long-term profit and growth of KAP. KAP prefers to 
work with major suppliers for ease of communication (G8), 
since they have advanced transaction systems and well-
trained employees to make transaction processes easier for 
KAP. 
The strategic goals are not directly used as criteria for 
evaluating the performance of suppliers, as it is difficult to 
assess and measure the performance of suppliers with respect 
to these goals. Thus, the supplier selection criteria Cj (j=1, 
2,…, 14), which are measurable quantitatively or assessable 
qualitatively and are independent of each other, are used to 
achieve the strategic goals, as shown in Table 2. Each 
supplier selection criterion is linked to the different strategic 
goals in terms of its relative importance value to the goals, as 
shown in Fig. 1. The total turnover and profits criteria (C1 
and C2) significantly affect the achievement of profitability 
(G1), development of large suppliers (G2), and minimisation 
of product cost (G3). The types of equipment and number of 
equipment (C3, and C4) are used to achieve part commonality 
(G7). C1, C2, C3, and C4 are quantitative criteria and their 
values are obtained from KAP. 
TABLE I.  
STRATEGIC GOALS AND THEIR WEIGHTS 
To meet the strategic goals involving minimisation of 
product cost (G3), long-term relationship (G5), quality 
improvement (G6), part commonality (G7) and maximisation 
of return on investment (G10), qualitative criteria C5, C6, C7, 
and C8 are used. These four qualitative criteria are assessed 
by KAP, based on its own assessment sheet with a score 
range of 0-100. For C5, the lower the item price, the higher 
the score. Six selection criteria C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, and C14 
are related to the strategic goals including coercive power 
(G4), long-term relationship (G5), ease of communication 
(G8), and mitigation of patent disputes (G9). C9 and C10 are 
measured in percentage and qualitative criteria C12, C13, and 
C14 are measured based on a 1-10 rating scale by KAP.

Based on the strategic goals and the supplier selection 
criteria, KAP wants to find which supplier can best perform 
for meeting its long-term strategic goals and short-term 
requirements. To address this important issue of KAP, we 
develop a strategic supplier selection approach. 
III. 
THE STRATEGIC SUPPLIER SELECTION APPROACH 
To evaluate the potential contribution of suppliers to the 
strategic goals, we develop an MCDM model with a strategic 
goals oriented weighting method. Evaluating suppliers can 
be formulated as an MCDM problem. The MCDM problem 
involves a finite set of I suppliers Si (i=1, 2, …, I) with 
respect to a set of J supplier selection criteria Cj (j=1, 2, …, 
J). Assessments are conducted by decision makers to 
determine the weight vector W=(w1, w2, …, wj) and the 
decision matrix X={xij, i=1, 2, …, I; j= 1, 2, …, J}. The 
weight vector W represents the weights of criteria Cj and the 
decision matrix X represents the performance ratings (xij) of 
suppliers Si with respect to criteria Cj. The supplier selection 
problem has been solved by various MCDM methods 
[9][10][11][12][13]. Especially, the SAW method, also 
known as the weighted sum method, is the widely-used and 
well-known MCDM method [14]. The basic logic of SAW is 
to obtain a weighted sum of the performance ratings of each 
alternative with respect to criteria. This method is well 
justified theoretically and easily understood by a decision 
maker [14]. We use the SAW method to aggregate the 
performance ratings and criteria weights for evaluating 
suppliers. 
In MCDM, different criteria weighting methods have 
been widely used to determine the importance of criteria 
[15][16][17]. We develop a new strategic goal oriented 
weighting method to determine the criteria weights by 
considering the strategic goals of KAP. To calculate the 
weights of the supplier selection criteria Cj (j=1, 2, …, J) 
(given in Table 2), the relative importance value rjk (k=1, 2, 
…, K) of the supplier selection criteria Cj to the strategic 
goals Gk (k=1, 2, …, K) (given in Table 1) is assessed by 
investigating how the criteria contribute to the goals of KAP, 
as shown in Fig. 1. A point estimate measurement, such as a 
five-point Likert type scale [17] has been widely used for 
making subjective assessments, as it is intuitively easy for a 
decision maker to use in expressing the subjectiveness and 
imprecision of the decision maker’s evaluation [18]. The 
relative importance value of the supplier selection criteria 
with respect to the strategic goals is assessed by using a set 
of five linguistic terms {Not Important (NI), Somewhat 
Important (SI), Moderate (M), Important (I), Very Important 
(VI)}, which is associated with a corresponding set of 
numerical values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The assessment is made by 
KAP, based on its current strategic needs and operational 
settings. 
With the linguistic terms, the relative importance value of 
the supplier selection criteria with respect to the strategic 
goals is given from the knowledge of experts in KAP. Table 
3 shows the relative importance value for determining 
criteria weights under various strategic goals. For example, 
the total turnover of the supplier (C1) is considered to be 
important (I) to achieve profitability (G1) and reduction of 
product cost (G3). KAP considers that suppliers making high 
revenues can contribute more to profitability and cost 
reduction of KAP. Partnership year (C11) is considered to be 
very important (VI) to achieve long-term relationship 
between KAP and its suppliers (G5) and ease of transaction 
(G8). Partnership year (C11) that KAP has built with its 
suppliers can be a good indicator of buyer-supplier 
relationships. If KAP builds long-term relationships with its 
suppliers, transaction between KAP and its suppliers will 
become easier and more cost-effective to each other. The 
turnover and profits made from KAP criteria (C9 and C10) are 
the most important supplier selection criteria to achieve 
coercive power (G4) and long-term relationship (G5) of KAP. 
This coincides with KAP’s opinions that they want to be 
suppliers’ major customer taking most of their orders in 
order to hold a dominant position over a long-period of time. 
The types of equipment and number of equipment criteria 
(C3 and C4) are considered to be not important (NI) to 
achieve profitability (G1), product cost reduction (G3), 
quality improvement (G6), ease of transaction (G8), and 
mitigation of patent disputes (G9), while it significantly 
contributes to expansion of the size of the supplier (G2). 
Based on the relative importance value of the supplier 
selection criteria with respect to the strategic goals, criteria 
weights wj are calculated. The decision matrix X representing 
the performance ratings (xij) of each supplier Si (i=1, 2, …, I) 
with respect to the supplier selection criteria Cj is assessed by 
KAP. These performance ratings are given based on both 
quantitative and qualitative assessments. The quantitative 
assessments are conducted based on objective data, while the 
qualitative assessments need the decision makers’ subjective 
judgments to rate the performance of suppliers with respect 
to the supplier selection criteria.

Given the relative importance value rjk of the supplier 
selection criteria Cj and the decision matrix X, an MCDM 
model with a strategic goal oriented weighting and SAW 
method is developed to evaluate the potential contribution of 
suppliers to the strategic goals as follows: 
 
Step 1:  Calculate the strategic goal oriented criteria weights 
wj (j=1, 2, …, J) of the supplier selection criteria Cj 
(j=1, 2, …, J) by aggregating the weight wk of each 
strategic goal Gk (k=1, 2, …, K) and relative 
importance value rjk of each selection criterion Cj to 
each goal Gk by

IV. 
THE EMPIRICAL STUDY 
An empirical study is conducted to demonstrate how the 
strategic supplier selection approach works for KAP in order 
to meet its both long-term strategic goals and short-term 
requirements. To evaluate the potential contribution of 
suppliers to the strategic goals, an MCDM model with the 
strategic goal oriented weighting method is used. Ten 
suppliers are used as samples for the empirical study. 
Based on the relative importance value criteria (given in 
Table 3) of the supplier selection criteria (given in Table 2) 
with respect to the strategic goals (given in Table 1), criteria 
weights wj are calculated by Eq. (1). Table 4 shows the 
weights of the supplier selection criteria. The highest weight 
0.094 is given for the proportion of turnover and profit of the 
supplier made from KAP (C9 and C10). KAP has assigned the 
highest weight 0.2 to coercive power for supplier 
management (G4) and long-term relationship between KAP 
and its suppliers (G5), and the proportion of turnover and 
profit of the supplier made from KAP (C9 and C10) are the 
most important selection criteria of suppliers to achieve 
coercive power for supplier management (G4) and long-term 
relationship between KAP and its suppliers (G5) of KAP. 
The number of types and total number of equipment of the 
supplier to produce KAP item (C3 and C4), on the other hand, 
gains the lowest weight 0.053.

In the supplier selection problem, the performance ratings 
of ten suppliers with respect to the quantitative and 
qualitative selection criteria (given in Table 2) are assessed 
by KAP as shown in Table 5. The basic units of C1 and C2 
are one million dollars. Average item price (C5) and quality 
(C6) criteria are adjusted by taking the reversal of the original 
data to make a consistent comparison across all criteria. The 
performance ratings of ten suppliers are then normalised by 
Eq. (2). 
Given the criteria weights and normalised performance 
ratings of suppliers, the contribution scores of ten suppliers 
are calculated by Eq. (3). The highest and lowest 
contribution scores of the suppliers are 0.3164 and 0.2860 
respectively. Table 6 shows the normalised performance 
ratings with respect to 14 selection criteria, and contribution 
scores (given in the last row) of the ten suppliers. Supplier S2 
is a highest rated supplier that best contributes to both long-
term strategic goals and short-term requirements of KAP. 
To help better illustrate how the strategic goals affect the 
strategic supplier selection, sensitivity analysis has been 
conducted by adjusting the strategic goal weights. Sensitivity 
analysis for strategic goals G1, G4, and G5 has been used as 
an example. Figs. 2, 3, and 4 show how priorities of ten 
suppliers can change, based on the different weight of the 
strategic goals G1, G4, and G5 by sensitivity analysis. The x-
axis shows the weight of each strategic goal and y-axis 
displays the contribution score of ten suppliers.

TABLE VI.  
THE NORMALISED PERFORMANCE RATINGS, 
CONTRIBUTION SCORES AND RANKINGS OF SUPPLIERS 
 
Fig. 2 shows that S6 is superior to suppliers S2, S1 and S3 
in terms of the contribution score when the weight of 
profitability (G1) is higher than about 0.45, while suppliers S2, 
S1, and S3 are preferable to S6 when the weight of 
profitability (G1) is less than about 0.16. Assigning the 
higher weight on profitability (G1) increases the probabilities 
of S6 to be selected. The contribution scores of suppliers S6, 
S2, S1, and S3 are always more dominant than suppliers S10, S5, 
S8, S9, S4, and S7, regardless of the weight of profitability (G1) 
due to the fact that the performance ratings of suppliers S6, S2, 
S1, and S3 with respect to profitability (G1) are much superior 
to suppliers S10, S5, S8, S9, S4. This indicates that suppliers S6, 
S2, S1, and S3 contribute more to the profitability (G1) 
strategic goal than suppliers S10, S5, S8, S9 and S4. Fig. 3 
shows that two suppliers S2 and S1 are always superior to 
others. This indicates that suppliers S2 and S1 contribute more 
to the coercive power (G4) strategic goal than suppliers S3, S6, 
S10, S5, S8, S9, S4 and S7. Fig. 4 shows that S1 is superior to 
supplier S2 when the weight of G5 is higher than about 0.25, 
while supplier S2 or S6 can be chosen when the weight of G5 
is less than about 0.25. Suppliers S1, S2, S3, and S6 are always 
more dominant than others. This indicates that they 
contribute more to the long-term relationship (G5) strategic 
goal than others. It is noteworthy that depending on the 
different weights of the strategic goals, priorities of suppliers 
change. Thus, KAP will be able to use these different 
weighting combination results for its various strategic plans. 
The result of the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that 
determining the different weights of strategic goals changes 
criteria weights, thus affecting strategic supplier selection of 
KAP.

CONCLUSION 
Selecting the supplier that best meets both specific long-
term expectations and short-term requirements of a company 
requires a comprehensive approach. To address this decision 
problem, we have developed a new strategic supplier 
selection approach for meeting both long-term strategic goals 
and short-term requirements of customer orders of a 
company. A new weighting method has been developed to 
evaluate the potential contribution of the suppliers to the 
strategic goals of a company by examining how the selection 
criteria contribute to the goals. The strategic supplier 
selection approach developed in this paper provides a 
structured approach for a company to choose the long-term 
strategic supplier most contributing to its long-term survival 
and growth, and short-term requirements. Although the 
approach is exemplified with the strategic supplier selection 
problem in the auto parts manufacturing company, it has 
general application in selecting a strategic supplier in 
different supply chains with various strategic goals and 
short-term requirements.
