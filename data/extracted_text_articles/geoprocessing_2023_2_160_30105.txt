Abstract—Currently, there is a shortage of studies focusing on
analyzing existing authoritative geographic ontologies to promote
their reuse. This work attempts to ﬁll this gap by reviewing
and evaluating four authoritative geographic ontologies on the
web. Evaluation is carried out using a set of quantitative quality
metrics. Results provide insight into the accuracy, complexity,
and completeness of the ontologies and highlight the need for
further studies in the heterogeneity of their underlying models.
Index Terms—Geographic Ontology; Linked Data; Metrics.
I. INTRODUCTION
Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies have been
considered for the representation and sharing of authoritative
geographic data sets. For example, the Ordnance Survey,
the mapping agency of Great Britain [1], has ﬁve deﬁned
ontologies, and provide open data sets of approximately
64,342,201 triples. Similarly, several spatial linked data sets
for the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Ireland, and Spain
are published, and presented at the Knowledge Graph in
Action conference (KGiA) [2]. The different providers propose
different ontologies for the representation of their data. The
heterogeneity of the ontologies is a limitation of their reuse.
Evaluation of an ontology refers to measuring its quality
to determine its ﬁtness for purpose. The evaluation process
involves two perspectives: the provider’s perspective, that
focus on the accuracy of presentation, error, and quality of
naming, and the consumer’s perspective, which focuses on
the data level and ease of understanding the model. Several
studies have been conducted to assess authoritative geographi-
cal linked data from the developer’s perspective. For example,
Debattista et al. [3] evaluated Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI)
using the Luzzu and OOPS platforms [4]. There is a need to
assess the authoritative geographic ontologies from the user’s
perspective to better facilitate their understanding and reuse,
as recommended in KGiA [2]. This work analyses a sample
of established authoritative geographic ontologies available on
the web to examine the complexity of their representation and
their completeness of representation. Results show how spatial
completeness is limited in most of the studied ontologies and
thus further work needs to examine this factor in the future.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section
II explains the methodology used in the study. The evaluation
results are discussed in section III, and the paper is concluded
in section IV.
II. METHOD
Four ontologies were downloaded. These are the adminis-
trative units for the UK (O1), Ireland (O2), Greece (O3), and
France (O4), as shown in Table I. A metric-based evaluation
method was used as it provides a quantitative and objective
way of comparison. Figure 1 shows the metrics used in the
evaluation process. The schema metrics, graph metrics, and
knowledge base metrics are derived from OntoMetrics [5].
Fig. 1: The metrics used in the evaluation process.
Four criteria are considered: accuracy, conciseness, com-
plexity, and completeness. The accuracy criterion measures
the extent to which an ontology models its real-world domain.
The schema metrics include Attribute Richness (AR), Inher-
itance Richness (IR), and Relationship Richness (RR), and
graph metrics include Average Depth (AD), Average Breadth
(AB), Maximal Depth (MD), and Maximal Breadth (MB). RR
indicates the diversity of ontology relationships.
AR indicates the number of attributes (slots) deﬁned for
each class, which can be used to infer the quality of the

ontology design. IR shows the distribution of information
across different levels of ontology. The conciseness criterion
measures the degree of usefulness of the ontology knowledge.
This quality criterion correlates with Average Population (AP)
and Class Richness (CR). AP represents the average distribu-
tion of instances across all classes. CR is a measure of how
instances are distributed among classes. Therefore, it indicates
how many instances are related to the classes deﬁned in the
schema.
By understanding the complexity of the ontology, devel-
opers can better understand, reuse, and reduce maintenance
requirements. The coupling and readability of the ontology
determined the degree of complexity. Coupling reveals the
number of external classes from imported ontologies ref-
erenced in the local ontology. It measures the relatedness
between the local ontology and other existing ontologies or
vocabularies used to construct the ontology [7]. It is deﬁned
as:
Coupling(O) = REC/NEC
(1)
Where NEC is the distinct number of external classes, and
REC is the number of references to external classes. The
stronger the coupling, the more difﬁcult it is to understand
and manipulate. By parsing the OWL ﬁle, we calculated the
number of distinct external classes deﬁned in the ontology
and the number of references to external classes. The code is
available online [8].
A measure of readability is the average number of names
(labels) and descriptions (comments) per ontology entity, such
as classes and properties. We utilize six annotation metrics
to evaluate readability. As shown in Figure 2, c.comment,
op.comment, and dp.comment represent the average number
of rdfs:comment statements per class, object property, and data
property in the ontology, respectively. The average number
of rdf:label statements per class, object property, and data
property in the ontology is represented by c.label, op.label,
and dp.label. GraphDB [6] was used to upload the data sets
and to run the SPARQL queries to compute the annotation
metrics.
Assessment of completeness considered the schema level
and not the instance level of representation. Spatial complete-
ness of the ontologies was done by considering the standard
set of possible spatial relationships between data types. For
example, there are ﬁve possible relationships between two
regions, namely, inside, contain, overlap, touch and equal. A
completeness score for the ontology is computed in terms of
the completeness score of its spatial classes as presented in
equation (2), where Comp is the sum of the completeness
score of all the spatial classes and C is the total number of
spatial classes in the ontology.
Completeness = Comp/C
(2)
III. RESULT
Inheritance Richness (IR) shows the distribution of infor-
mation across different levels of ontology. This metric can
distinguish horizontal ontology (where classes have a large
number of direct subclasses) from vertical ontology (where
classes have a small number of direct subclasses). In Table
I, O2, O3, and O4 cover more speciﬁc details (depth), while
O1 deﬁnes the domain broadly. Relationship Richness (RR)
is a measure of diversity of the type of relationships in the
ontology. Ontologies O1, O2 and O3 have a low RR score,
as they represent mostly one type of relationship; namely the
subclass relationship. Result shows that the low value of RR
corresponds to higher Maximal Depth (MD) and Maximal
Breadth (MB) values. In addition, Attribute Richness (AR)
values indicate that the ontologies O1, O3 and O4 contain
more attribute information about the classes than O2.
Average Population (AP) indicates how well the data extrac-
tion process was conducted to populate the knowledge base.
Results show that O1, O2 have a large number of instance per
class, indicating a good ﬁt for the class representation in the
ontology. CR is related to how instances are distributed across
classes. As a result, it displays a percentage indicating the
number of instances in each class in the Knowledge Base. The
results indicate that O1, O2, and O4 have more instances than
O3. As shown in Table II, O2 and O3 have high complexity
due to the coupling and readability values. The result indicates

that O2 has a strong coupling, which makes it more difﬁcult
to understand and maintain than O1.
Each class in ontology is checked for completeness, and
then equation (1) is used to compute the result.
As an example of incompleteness in the OS is shown
in Figure 3, all possible relationships that can be de-
ﬁned between the two polygons, County and District, are
disjoint, contains, within as shown in 3b, graph 3a shows
the deﬁned relationship between the same two polygons is
within; thus, the incomplete relationship is disjoint, contains.
Results show that O1 is 56% complete, O2, O3, and O4 are
30%, making O1 more capable of reasoning and retrieving the
geographic information.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we evaluated authoritative geographic on-
tologies using metrics-based methods. Analysis of metrics
result indicates that geographic ontologies contain enough
data to facilitate knowledge usage. Results conﬁrm that UK
ontology covers a wide range of information and show that
the ontologies have a good hierarchy. A high score for incom-
plete spatial relationships leads to fewer inferred geographical
details in France, Greece, and Ireland. The UK ontology has
very low complexity, which indicates that the model is easy to
understand by the user. The future research direction would be
to develop a uniﬁed data model to integrate the authoritative
ontologies.
