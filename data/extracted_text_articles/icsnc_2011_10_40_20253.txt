Abstract—Today’s public charge points for Electric Vehicles
(EV) are equipped with numerous ICT components for commu-
nication with vehicle and back-end systems for authentication,
billing and invoicing. The rollout of EVs will inevitably lead to
a higher demand for charging infrastructure and will increase
the operational and management costs for operators. In order to
minimize costs, this paper evaluates applicable local networking
technologies for large scale charge point scenarios and takes into
account IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.3 and Homeplug GreenPHY,
which is currently discussed in the ISO/IEC Joint Working
Group for deﬁning the Vehicle 2 Grid Communication Interface
where TU Dortmund is an active member. A Web-Service based
Charging Process Protocol for data exchange between all involved
entities is presented to determine the data rates for XML and EXI
encoded packet transmission. The V2G communication between
EV and charge point is analyzed as well as the goodput for back-
end communication. For this, hubs including data concentration
are proposed to minimize billing data amount for the clearing
center. For examination of the possible charge point network
size, an overview of current predictions for EVs is given and
the proposed system is evaluated within a parking area at TU
Dortmund, where we expect the installation of 61 charge points
by 2030. With optimization of the presented load coordination
service, the data rate in the charge point network could be
reduced by 99.8 %.

I. INTRODUCTION
The market penetration of electric vehicles will raise to
approximately 1 million in 2020 and 2 million in 2030 in
Germany [1]. Based on this prediction that is aimed by the
German government for the next years, a charging at work
application scenario is examined in this paper. This scenario
is described in detail in Section II. To include important
services like load coordination to prevent local substation
blackouts and the possibiliy to feed back energy into the smart
grid communication between EV and Electric Vehicle Supply
Equipment (EVSE) is inevitable. For coordinated charging
processes in parking areas a network beetween EVSEs and a
Load Coordinator (LC) needs to be considered. The connection
needs to be cost-effective, integrable in existing infrastructures
and reliable. Hence, we propose the IEEE 802.11 standard
due to high market penetration. If new parking areas are
planed IEEE 802.3 is an alternative due to low costs and
high data rates, which is sufﬁcient for the next years regarding
possible value added services. Section III introduces prEVail,
a simulation environment for evaluation of the ICT for EV
connectivity. The charging process communication protocol is
presented and packet sizes for an XML based communication
and an EXI encoded message exchange are determined using
the MORE middleware [10]. With these measured packet
sizes, Section III-A analyses the V2G communication based
on the charging process protocol regarding the Powerline
Communications standard Homeplug GreenPHY. After this the
inter charge point communication is analyzed including back-
end communication with data concentration for an effective
transfer of clearing data. Afterwards a worst-case scenario
including a fair load coordination is introduced, and the
realization of the charging at work scenario can be veriﬁed
regarding the predictions in Section I and Section II.
II. CHARGING AT WORK SCENARIO
The central scenario for charging an electric vehicle will
be charging at home. 90 % of the people in Germany drive
less than 50 km per day. These distances can be covered by
most of todays EVs with a night charge. Hence, charging
at public charge points is not inevitable. For commuters
with a long travel to work, charging at work is the second
major charging scenario. This scenario is discussed in the
following chapters. The Federal Motor Transport Authority
(KBA) of Germany published a study for January 2011 [3]
where Germany currently has 42,3 million registered private
vehicles. In [4], a slow increase of prices for transportation
and hence a slow behaviour modiﬁcation of the population is
predicted, which results in an increasing number of vehicles
in Germany.

of 4.13%). Figure 1 shows the calculation for EVs at TU
Dortmund depending on the predictions before. With 4000
available parking spaces and an EV percentage of 4.13% a
maximum of 173 EVs are available at TU Dortmund. Although
the range of today’s EVs is sufﬁcient for 90 % of the german
inhabitans, in future it will be important to plug in the EV to
provide an operating reserve. In peak times pluged in EVs can
help to stabilize the grid because renewable energy sources like
wind parks and solar collectors are not reliable energy sources
at all times. Indeed, not all of the cars need to be recharged
at work and also not everybody wants to provide an operating
reserve because of the anxiety that the battery gets damaged.
Hence, we assume that in the year 2030 35% of the 173 EVs
need the opportunity to plug in considering enhancements in
the battery technology and EV owners who want to provide
an operating reserve. Hence, we propose the installation of 61
charge points at TU Dortmund until 2030.
III. ICT SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT PREVAIL
prEVail is an ICT validation environment for different
communication technologies and is based on the simulation
environment presented in [2] using OMNeT++ 4.0 [5] and the
INET Framework [6]. For electric vehicle charging processes,
the four main entities EV, EVSE, Emobility Hub (EMHub)
and the optional LC are integrated (see Figure 2).

infrastrucutres
The modules UDP, network layer, ethernet nic and wiﬁ
nic are integrated within the INET framework and all other
modules have been implemented by the authors. The Electric
Vehicle (EV) consists of a full adjustable battery model,
which is conﬁgured to act as a lithium ion battery, a charge
controller and the Electric Vehicle Communication Controller
(EVCC), the central communication module of the EV. It
mediates between the internal modules of the EV and the
charging infrastructure. The other modules of the EV (battery
and charger) are implemented as trafﬁc generators for the
communication processes. Current EVs typically use high
performance lithium ion batteries with charging characteristics
shown in Figure 3. Before a deep discharge threshold is
reached, the battery will be charged with a minimal current
(a preconditioning charge). From this point the battery can be
charged with a constant current until it reaches its maximum
cell voltage. In the third stage the battery will be charged
with a constant voltage leading to a decreasing charge current.
The gradients of the voltage graphs in stage 1 and 2 are
constant, although a saturation curve will be expected. In stage
3 the charging current is modeled as discrete saturation curve.
These assumptions are made because it has no major effect
on the characteristics of the modules with respect to trafﬁc
generation.

Simulated charging characteristics of a lithium ion battery
The EVSE and the EV are connected via Powerline Com-
munications (PLC). Due to current discussions in the ISO/IEC
Joint Working Group for deﬁning the V2G Communication
Interface [8] Homeplug GreenPHY [7] was choosen for eval-
uation with prEVail. Results are shown in Section III-A. The
Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment Communication Controller
(EVSECC) is modeled as a gateway and only forwards mes-
sages from EV to LC and back. The smart meter generates
meter readings for the charging process regarding parameters
of the EV’s battery, which will be needed for the clearing. The
clearing data are send to the Emobility Hub (EMHub), which
is responsible for authentication and clearing.
The Load Coordinator (LC) is parametrized by only one
parameter, the total capacity, which is available for the whole
parking area. This capacity is fairly assigned to all charging
vehicles. To arrange multiple EVSEs in a local network, the
EVSEs and the LC can be connected with different com-
munication technologies. In this work Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
and Wiﬁ (IEEE 802.11g) will be evaluated. For higher layer
communication a web-service based protocol is discussed
including XML and the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI)
encoding format [9]. The charging process protocol including
authentication, start of the ChargingPprocess (CP), clearing
and optional capacity updates for the load coordination is

Charging Process Protocol
For authentication the EV sends an authentication message
with a contractID and the EVSEID via the LC with integrated
Data Concentrator (DC) to the EMHub. The EMHub replies
with an authentication response containing a sessionID for
the new charging process, which is needed for the clearing
later on. After successful authentication the EV initializes the
CP by sending an initializeCP message containing Imax and
Imin. With these information, the LC calculates new capacity
assignements and sends updates to all charging EVs. After
receiving the assigned capacity from the LC the EVSE sends a
ﬁrst clearing message including the initial meter reading to the
EMHub. Afterwards the clearing will be done by the EVSE ev-
ery 900s (15 min.) using the sessionID from the authentication
process and the meter reading. When CP is ﬁnished the EV
notiﬁes the LC, which calculates new capacities for the other
charging EVs and the EVSE initiates the last clearing message.
The same recalculation of capacities is done during the load
coordination. Every time the EV does not need the whole
assigned capacity anymore it sends updateCP messages with
the currently used power to the LC, in order to deallocate the
excess power for use in other charging processes. Subsequently
the LC recalculates the power allocation and replies with an
update to all other active EVs.
For an estimation of packet sizes for authentication and
clearing on the one hand and load coordination on the other
hand, a web-service was developed using the MORE Mid-
dleware [10]. Table I shows the measured packet sizes for
messages within the charge point network.

A. Vehicle 2 Grid Communication
In this section, the V2G communication between EV and
EVSE is analyzed based on the charging process protocol
presented before. Due to the fact that EV and EVSE are
generally connected with the charging cable (except inductive
charge), this communication medium can be used with a PLC
communication technology.

Vehicle to Grid Communication Overview
Homeplug GreenPhy standard [7] is currently discussed in
[8]. The advantage is the compatibility with Homplug AV
and the reduction of cost and power consumption to 25% of
Homeplug AV. Hence, the complexity is decreased, and e.g.,
TDMA mode was removed and the dynamic channel adaption
was limited. The result is that only one subcarrier modulation
format is supported (QPSK) as well as only one Turbo Code
with rate 1/2 for Forward Error Correction and a limited PHY
rate of 10 Mbps maximum. The number of 1155 subcarriers
244

and subcarrier spacing of 24.414 kHz is unmodiﬁed to support
the compatibility to Homeplug AV and hence the compatibility
with in-house PLC networks. For further analyses the MINI-
ROBO AV mode with a PHY Rate of 3.7716 Mbps and a
Physical Block (PB) size of 136 bytes and the STD-ROBO AV
with PB size of 520 Byte and a PHY Rate of 4.9226 Mbps are
evaluated. An overview of the GreenPHY PB format is given
in Figure 6.

Homeplug GreenPhy Physical Block format [7]
Each PB consists of a 4 octets PB Header containing e.g.,
a Segment Sequence Number (SSN). Depending on the PB
size, data have to be padded to either 512 or 128 octets to ﬁt
exactly into the PB Body. The PHY Block Check Sequence
(PBCS) contains a 32-bit CRC and is computed over the PB
Header and the encrypted PB Body.
Based on this standard, the V2G communication is ana-
lyzed. Figure 7 depicts the occurence of messages during a
whole fast charging process without getting inﬂuenced by the
LC due to other charging vehicles and recalculation of the
capacity assignment. The measurement was made with EXI
encoding right before the encapsulation into the PB Body to
see, if the messages ﬁt into one PB Body. It can be determined
that all sent messages and the authentication response do not
ﬁt into the PB520 Body of 512 octets (see dottet line in Figure
7). Hence, the messages are fragmented into 2 PBs with size
of 520 octets each due to the needed padding.

Message occurence of charging process protocol in V2G communi-
cation using EXI encoding in a fast charging scenario
The CP begins at approximately 400s simulation time with
the authentication and the response. After that, the charging
process is initialized by the initializeCP message and the
corresponding response. The next updateCP message at 1200s
is the change over to charging stage 2 of the battery where
the EV requests more capacity from LC. The third charging
stage starts after approximately 4100s. In this stage the EV
deallocates the excess capacity NCPupdates times.
NCPupdates = (Imax − Imin + 2)
(1)
With Imax = 32 and Imin = 3, 31 CP updates are initiated
by the EV before the CP ﬁnishes with a ﬁnishCP and cor-
responding response message. Figure 8 shows the XML and
EXI data rate for HP GreenPHY PB sizes of 136 and 520
octets as a function of simulation time.

Average data rate for V2G communication with XML and EXI
encoded XML as a function of simulation time
It can be seen that the average data rate correlates with the
message occurence in Figure 7. Because of the padding, in EXI
transmision 2 PBs need to be transmitted and the data rate for
PB520 is much higher, although PB136 has more fragments.
With ongoing time when the CP goes over to stage 3, PB136
data rate is still a bit lower and PB520 data rate increases until
the end of the CP. The last result is also the average data rate
for a full CP. Using PB136 for the presented charging process
protocol will save 23% of the needed data rate when using
EXI encoding.
As stated in Table I, all XML messages including protocol
overhead ﬁt into 2 PB520 Bodys and the utilization of the PB
Body gets more effective in comparison to EXI and the data
rates for both modes are more or less equal. Nevertheless the
data rate can be reduced from 87 Bit/s to only 51 Bit/s by using
EXI and PB136 mode. This corresponds to an enhancement
of 41 %.
B. Inter Charge Point Communication
For communication with EV and back-end, today’s charge
points are equipped with numerous ICT components, which
increases the prices for the infrastructure. Especially the con-
tracts for mobile radio for the back-end communication are
very expensive and can be saved when organizing multiple
EVSEs into a local network. Figure 9 gives an example for
connecting EVSEs in a network using IPv4. This network
includes one EVSE acting as a data hub for back-end commu-
nication, which concentrates the clearing data in one message
and transfers it to the EMHub. Hence, protocol overhead can
be reduced. In future work IPv6 will be integrated into prEVail
to support analyses of larger networks.

Design of large-scale charge point networks using multiple IPv4
subnetworks
Considering the packet sizes of Table I, the goodput in
the charge point network without load coordination dCSN/BE
can be calculated with (2) for x charging process. In this
context the goodput is deﬁned as the data rate within the
presentation layer. Thus protocol overhead is excluded. The
goodput includes the authentication Pauth and the correspond-
ing authentication response PauthRes, the clearing messages
at the beginning and at the end of the charging process and
periodic clearing messages every 15 minutes. For a charging
process with t = 3h the needed data rate is 6.42 Bit/s
for EXI communication. This goodput is also valid for the
communication link to the back-end. In order to reduce the
needed data rate for this link, the clearing messages can be
concentrated at the data hub, so that only one message is
periodicaly sent to the back-end including the clearing data
of all ongoing charging processes.

Data Concentration (DC) with EXI encoded XML for back-end
communication
When XML is used for sending clearing information to
the back-end it can be seen that the data concentration is
very effective and 73% of the transmitted data can be saved.
If this XML stream is encoded with EXI the data can be
reduced by a factor of one third. Because of the efﬁcient
encoding of information repeatedly used in the same message
[9], only 8.6% of the clearing data need to be transfered to
the EMHub in comparison to XML without data concentration.
Formula (3) calculates the goodput for the concentrated back-
end communication link dCBE depending on the number of
parallel charging processes and the clearingSize shown in
Figure 10 for XML and in Figure 11 for EXI.

Comparison of the goodput for data concentration mechanisms
If the clearing data of 20 charging processes are merged into
only one message, the goodput for XML concentration can be
reduced to 24% and for EXI Schema concentration to 14%.
The concentration will be even more effective by increasing
the parallel charging processes.
For estimation of a worst-case data rate for a charge point
network, the LC is integrated into the parking area [2]. The
LC coordinates all charging processes on the parking area to
reduce the risk of local substation blackouts. The maximum
power for the parking area can be deﬁned depending on the
scenario and is allocated equitably to each charge point.

worst case data rate, all EVs charge in the third stage to get
a maximum of data trafﬁc in the simulation. Figure 13 shows
ﬁrst results for an unoptimized load coordination message
exchange where the updateCP messages in the third charging
state were sent in periodic time intervals takt = 5s instead
of a ﬁxed number shown in formula (1). This time interval
guaranteed an optimal power allocation for all EVs.
IEEE 802.3 and 802.11g are analyzed regarding communi-
cation with pure XML and EXI encoded XML. The data rate
of IEEE 802.11g is marginal higher for XML and for EXI
communication than the one of IEEE 802.3 due to protocol
overhead. Hence, a maximum data rate of 5.5 MBit/s for XML
and 3.1 MBit/s for EXI encoded data trafﬁc is needed. Figure
14 depicts the data rate for inter charge point communication
after optimization of LC service without losing functionality.

Overview of the data rate for inter charge point communication
using IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11g with optimized LC
It can be seen that 99.8 % of inter charge point data trafﬁc
can be saved using the optimized load coordination. Only 5.7
kBit/s are needed for EXI encoding. Because of the low data
rates, no packet errors occur in this scenario. In future work
higher scale networks are analyzed e.g., for the year 2050
where we expect a maximum of 502 charge points regarding
predictions of [11].
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper analyzed an application scenario for charging
electric vehicles at work. At the beginning predictions of
the German Government on the market penetration of EVs
are presented. Based on these predictions a parking area at
TU Dortmund was determined for installing a charge point
network with a sufﬁcient number of charge points supporting
fast charging. For evaluating the ability of IEEE 802.11g,
IEEE 802.3 and Homeplug GreenPhy for this scenario, the
simulation environment prEVail based on OMNeT++ was
presented. After that an optimized Charging Process Protocol
was introduced, which supports communication between EV,
EVSE, LC and EMHub. After that the V2G communication
between EV and EVSE using Homeplug GreenPHY and the
charging process protocol was analyzed and enhancements are
presented for XML and EXI transmission. 41 % of data could
be save using EXI and the small PB Size of 136 octets. For
the communication link to the back-end a data concentration
mechanism was presented showing an optimized data volume
of factor 7 with 20 parallel charging processes. The data
trafﬁc within the charge point network was determined for
authentication, billing and a worst case scenario enabling load
coordination was introduced. With 61 charging EVs a data rate
of only 5.7 kBit/s is needed for optimized load coordination
and clearing, where the data trafﬁc can be reduced by 99.8 %.
Hence, no packet errors could be detected in this large scale
application scenario for the year 2030.
In future work wide area communication technologies can be
integrated into the simulation environment in order to calculate
the data rates for the back-end communication depending
on the physical layer. Also an integration of IPv6 is useful
for higher scale charge point networks to simulate charging
infrastructures for the year 2050. Furthermore the optimal
position of a data-hub at the parking area at TU Dortmund
will be determined using a raytracing environment for an esti-
mation of the radiowave propagation of mobile communication
networks. An analysis of a charging at home scenario would
also lead to interesting results.
