Abstract— Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is currently 
one of the most suitable gaze-independent paradigms to control 
a visual brain-computer interface based on event related 
potentials (ERP-BCI) by patients with a lack of ocular motility. 
However, gaze-independent paradigms have not been studied as 
closely as gaze-dependent ones in reference to the type of stimuli 
presented. Under gaze-dependent paradigms, faces have been 
shown to be the most appropriate stimuli, especially when they 
are red. Therefore, the aim of the present work is to evaluate 
whether these results of the color of faces as visual stimuli also 
has an impact on ERP-BCI performance under the RSVP 
paradigm. In this preliminary study, six participants tested the 
ERP-BCI under RSVP using four different conditions for a 
speller application: letters, blue faces, red faces, and green faces. 
These preliminary results showed non-significant differences in 
accuracy or information transfer rate. The present work 
therefore shows that, unlike under gaze-dependent paradigms, 
the stimulus type has no impact on the performance of an ERP-
BCI under RSVP. This finding should be considered in future 
ERP-BCI proposals aimed at users who need gaze-independent 
systems.

 INTRODUCTION 
An Event Related Potential (ERP)-based Brain-Computer 
Interface (BCI) is a type of Assistive Technology (AT) that 
allows a user to communicate with his/her environment using 
only brain signals [1]. In addition to ERP-BCIs, there are 
several types of ATs, such as eye-trackers, head-pointing 
devices, or low-pressure sensors. However, some injuries or 
diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), can 
lead to situations in which the muscular channel and even eye 
movements can be affected [2]. Therefore, in severe motor 
limitations, most of these examples of AT may no longer be 
useful because they depend on some type of muscular channel 
that may be affected in the patient. This makes ERP-BCIs a 
promising option in severe cases of lack of muscular control. 
ERPs are changes in the voltage of the electrical activity 
of the brain caused by the presentation of a specific event. 
These events can be external stimuli presented in various 
forms, like visual, auditory or tactile events [3]. The form used 
in the present work is the visual one. Based on the review 
presented in [3], this form generally provides the best results 
for the control of an ERP-BCI. Furthermore, under certain 
presentation paradigms, the visual modality can be used even 
if the user has no ocular control. A paradigm that does not 
require eye movement is Rapid Serial Visual Presentation 
(RSVP) [4]. In the following, we explain how RSVP is used 
for control of a visual ERP-BCI. 
The main feature of RSVP is that the visual stimuli are 
presented serially—one after the other—in the same spatial 
location. For the control of a visual ERP-BCI, different visual 
stimuli are presented to the user, who must attend to one of 
them. Paying attention to the desired stimulus (for example, a 
letter in the case of a speller) should elicit a different electrical 
signal in the brain than the signal associated with undesired 
stimuli. Hence, the objective of an ERP-BCI is to discriminate 
between the desired or attended stimulus (target) and 
undesired or non-attended stimuli (non-target) based on the 
user's brain signals. The main component used by these 
systems is the P3 signal (also called P300). This P300 
corresponds to a positive deflection in the amplitude of the 
brain's electrical signal that begins approximately 300–600 ms 
after the presentation of a stimulus that the user is expecting. 
However, an ERP-BCI generally uses all possible ERPs 
involved in the observed time interval (e.g., P2, N2, or a late 
positive potential). That is, any signal that helps to 
discriminate the attended stimulus (target) from unattended 
ones (non-target) will be used in the selected interval time 
(e.g., 0–800 ms after stimulus onset). 
As mentioned above, the target population for a visual 
ERP-BCI may be patients who have lost even the ability to 
control their eyes. It is therefore important that the interfaces 
offered to this type of user are adapted to their abilities. For 
example, performance worsens considerably if the user cannot 
directly attend to stimuli with the gaze [5] [6]. This makes it

convenient to employ paradigms that do not require eye 
control to yield adequate performance, such as RSVP. Other 
works have shown that parameters, such as (i) the spatial 
distribution of the stimuli [7], (ii) the stimulus duration [8] and 
(iii) the type of stimulus employed [9] have an impact on 
performance. 
The type of stimulus used in an ERP-BCI has been a 
widely studied factor in gaze-dependent paradigms, such as 
matrix-based ones, in which stimuli are presented in subsets 
on a matrix of letters and the subject can gaze at any symbol. 
For example, the most used matrix-based paradigm is the 
Row-Column Paradigm (RCP). In this paradigm, rows and 
columns are flashed (i.e., highlighted from grey to white) one 
by one. To select a character, the user pays attention to the 
flashing of a specific target character, as this acts as the task-
relevant stimulus that elicits the ERP component (e.g., the 
P300 potential). Once the ERP has been linked to a specific 
row and column, the BCI is able to determine the user's target 
character. In these matrix-based paradigms, faces have been 
one of the best performing stimuli [10], and continuing this 
trend, further work has shown how even the color of the face 
can influence performance. Specifically, in [11], it was shown 
that semitransparent green faces performed better than normal 
color semitransparent faces. Afterwards, in [12] the effect of 
using semitransparent faces of different colors—blue, green 
and red—superimposed on the letters was studied (Figure 1). 
In that study, it was shown that red faces performed better than 
green and blue faces. However, it should be considered that 
what was obtained, in terms of performance and the type of 
stimulus used, under paradigms other than RSVP need not be 
similar to what was obtained under RSVP [13]. It may be 
interesting to ask whether this effect on face color 
performance could also be obtained under RSVP. Therefore, 
the aim of this study is to replicate the experiment proposed in 
[12] but under the RSVP modality. 
In summary, RSVP is a suitable gaze-independent control 
paradigm used in the field of BCIs in case users do not have 
oculomotor control. However, the effect previously found 
under gaze-dependent paradigms on the color of faces used as 
visual stimuli has not been studied under RSVP. Therefore, to 
study the effect of stimulus type on performance in an ERP-
BCI under RSVP could be a significant contribution. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the 
experimental setup, and presents details about the spelling 
paradigms. The results and discussion are presented in Section 
3, followed by the conclusion and future works in Section 4. 
 
II. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. 
Participants 
Six healthy French university students participated in this 
study. None of them had previous experience using a BCI 
system. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
the University of Malaga and met the ethical standards of the 
Helsinki 
Declaration. 
According 
to 
self-reports, 
all 
participants had no history of neurological or psychiatric 
illness, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and gave 
informed consent trough a protocol reviewed by the ENSC-
IMS (École Nationale Supérieur de Cognitique – Intégration 
du Matériau su Système) Cognitive and the UMA-BCI teams 
from the University of Malaga. 
B. 
Data acquisition and Signal Processing 
The EEG was recorded using the electrode positions: Fz, 
Cz, Pz, Oz, P3, P4, PO7 and PO8, according to the 10/10 
international system. All channels were referenced to the right 
earlobe, using FPz as ground. Signals were amplified by a 16 
channel gUSBamp amplifier (Guger Technologies). The 
amplifier settings were from 0.5 Hz to 100 Hz for the band 
pass filter, the notch (50 Hz) was on, and the sensitivity was 
500 μV. The EEG was then digitized at a rate of 256 Hz. EEG 
data collection and processing were controlled by the UMA 
BCI Speller software [14], a BCI speller application 
developed by the UMA-BCI group which provides end users 
with an easy to use open-source BCI speller. This software is 
based on the widely used platform BCI2000 [15] so, it takes 
advantage of the reliability that such a platform offers. The 
UMA-BCI Speller wraps BCI2000 in such a way that its 
configuration and use are much more visual and, therefore, 
easier. As with any BCI speller developed with BCI2000, a 
Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SWLDA) of the data 
was performed to obtain the weights for the P300 classifier 
and to calculate the accuracy (using the BCI2000 tool called 
P300classifier). A detailed explanation of the SWLDA 
algorithm can be found in the P300Classifier user reference 
[16]. 
C. 
The spelling paradigms 
Four different RSVP paradigms were evaluated in the 
present work. The only difference between paradigms was the 
type of stimulus used: (i) Gray Letters (GL), (ii) 
semitransparent gray letters with a Blue Famous Face (BFF), 
(iii) semitransparent gray letters with Green Famous Face 
 
Figure 1. Stimulation pattern used in the study conducted by S. Li et 
al. [12] in which red, green and blue semitransparent faces were used 
as stimulation.

(GFF), and (iv) semitransparent gray letters with Red Famous 
Face (RFF) (Figure 2). Each paradigm presented six different 
letters that would be used during the experiment for writing 
words (A, E, I, N, R, and S, arial font). The number of letters 
was selected to avoid a target selection time that was too long, 
as the aim of this study was to validate the different sets of 
stimuli under RSVP for communication purposes. In previous 
studies with this kind of paradigm, the same number of 
elements has been used to validate hypotheses [9] [17]. The 
famous face of David Beckham was used as stimulus, as other 
authors did on [11]. The dimensions regarding the type of 
stimuli were as follows: letters, around 6 × 6 cm (the letter N 
was used as a reference); and faces, around 6 × 8 cm. The 
background used for the interface was black, and the stimuli 
were presented in the center of the screen. Also, at the top of 
the screen, both the letters to be selected and those previously 
selected were indicated. 
The duration of each stimulus presentation was equal to 
187.5ms and the Inter Stimuli Interval (ISI) was equal to 
93.75ms. Therefore, the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) 
had a duration equal to 281.25ms. The time for completing a 
sequence (i.e., single presentation or flashing of every 
stimulus) was 1687.5 ms. The pause time between one 
selection and the start of the next (i.e., between completed sets 
of sequences) was equal to 5 s. The flashing stimuli were 
presented in the center of the screen. 
D. 
Procedure 
A within-subject design was used, so that all users went 
through all experimental conditions. The experiment was 
carried out in one session. The order of the paradigms was 
counterbalanced across participants to prevent any undesired 
effects, such as learning or fatigue. Each condition consisted 
of two parts: (i) an initial calibration phase to obtain the 
specific signal patterns associated with each user and (ii) an 
online phase in which the user actually controlled the 
interface. Therefore, the main difference between both phases 
was that in the first phase the user did not receive any 
feedback. 
For both phases, the task was to write different French 
four-letter words. In the case of the calibration phase, the 
participant had to write four words (“ASIE”, “REIN”, 
“NIER”, and “SAIN”), so the total number of selections for 
this task was 16 letters. On the other hand, for the online 
phase, the user had to write three words (“ANIS”, “REIN” and 
“SERA”), so the number of selections would be 12 letters. In 
case the user made a mistake when selecting a letter in the 
online phase, he/she had to continue with the next letter. For 
both phases, a short break between words (variable at the 
request of the user) was employed. The number of sequences 
(i.e., the number of times that each stimulus—target and non-
target—was presented) was fixed to 10 in the calibration 
phase. Otherwise, for the online phase, the number of 
sequences selected was two more sequences than the 
minimum number of sequences required to obtain 100% 
accuracy in the calibration phase. 
E. 
Evaluation 
Two parameters were used to evaluate the effect of the 
RSVP paradigm and stimulus type on performance: i) the 
accuracy in the calibration and online phases, and ii) the 
Information Transfer Rate (ITR) in the online phase. The 
accuracy (%) was defined as the percentage of correctly 
predicted selections. While for the online task this last 
definition was applied, for the calibration phase, the accuracy 
was computed by the signal classifier after the classification 
of the word using the data from each sequence. The ITR 
(bit/min) is an objective measure to determine the 
communication speed of the system [18]. This parameter 
considers accuracy, the number of elements available in the 
interface and time to select one element: 
ITR = 
log2 𝑁 + 𝑃 log2 𝑃 + (1 − 𝑃) log2 1 − 𝑃
𝑁 − 1
𝑇
 
where P is the accuracy of the system, N is the number of 
elements available at the interface and T is the time needed to 
complete a trial (i.e., select an element). It should be noted 
that the pause between selections was not considered when 
calculating the ITR. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Calibration phase 
The P300classifier tool provides the performance 
obtained in the calibration phase according to the number 
sequences (Figure 3). In reference to accuracy in the 
calibration phase, the performance shown has been 
satisfactory, exceeding 90% average accuracy for all 
conditions from the third sequence. A three-way repeated 
measures ANOVA (4 × 10) including the conditions (GL, 
BFF, GFF and RFF), and sequence (from sequence 1 to 10) 
factors was carried out. The analysis only showed significant 
differences for the sequence factor (F (9, 45) = 37.322; p < 
0.001), but not for the condition factor (F (3, 15) = 1.427; p = 
0.274) or the interaction between them (F (27, 135) = 0.999; 
p = 0.475). Therefore, as can be observed in Figure 3, it seems 
that the accuracy obtained depends on the number of 
sequences carried out, but not on the type of stimulus used.

B. Online phase 
In reference to the online phase, it can also be affirmed that 
the results obtained were adequate, with an accuracy and ITR 
higher than 85% and 15 bits/min for all conditions (table 1). 
Two three-way repeated measures ANOVA (4) including the 
condition factor (GL, BFF, GFF and RFF) were performed 
using each one accuracy and ITR as dependent variable. These 
analyses showed no significant results for either the accuracy 
(F (3, 15) = 0.718; p = 0.557) or the ITR (F (3, 15) = 0.459; p 
= 0.715). Therefore, these results show that stimulus type has 
no significant effect on ERP-BCI performance under RSVP. 
C. Related literature 
The results obtained in the present work differs with those 
previously obtained by other proposals under gaze-dependent 
paradigms. In those proposals, it was shown that the use of 
faces as stimuli produced an improvement in performance 
compared to letters [10], and even differences depending on 
the color of the face [11], [12]. In the present work, under 
RSVP, no significant differences were even obtained between 
letters and red faces, which were supposed to be the best 
stimuli under a matrix-based paradigm. However, these 
results are in line with those obtained in previous works that 
showed that the enhancements produced by the type of 
stimulus depend on the presentation paradigm used. 
Specifically, other studies under RSVP have demonstrated 
that the type of stimulus used does not produce an 
improvement in performance compared to those obtained 
under other matrix-based paradigms [13], [20]. Therefore, it 
is necessary to consider the peculiarities of each paradigm to 
find out which variables are the ones that can allow an 
improvement in performance. Based on the results obtained in 
the present study, in the design of a RSVP-based speller, since 
no significant differences were found, the option of 
stimulating only with letters should be considered, that is, 
without adding other elements (e.g., images superimposed on 
the letters) that could even make it more difficult to detect the 
desired stimulus. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The present preliminary study has shown that the color of 
the faces used as visual stimuli does not seem to affect ERP-
BCI performance under RSVP. Therefore, it is possible that, 
at least to improve performance, the use of faces or colored 
faces is not necessary. In this line, in order to choose the type 
of stimuli used, it could be more convenient to be guided by 
other variables, such as the user's preferences or the type of 
application to be controlled. However, it is admitted that the 
present work shows its limitations since the sample size 
employed has been small and more metrics could have been 
added, such as an analysis of the ERP signal or questionnaires 
focused on evaluating the user experience. Thus, future work 
could go deeper into this type of assessment more extensively. 
It would also be interesting if further work aims to explain 
which variables affect the user experience using an ERP-BCI 
under RSVP and how they can be manipulated to improve 
performance.
