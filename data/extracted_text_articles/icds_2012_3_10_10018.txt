Abstract - Advanced by some as the next great emerging 
technology to enjoy overwhelming market penetration, three 
dimensional (3D) printing could have significant information 
implications, 
notwithstanding 
limited 
coverage 
in 
the 
information science literature.   This review of complementary 
material from other sources provides the introductory 
definitions, technical descriptions and indications of future 
developments relevant to information professionals. 
Keywords - 3D printing; three dimensional printing; additive 
fabrication; digital fabrication; rapid prototyping. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Three dimensional (3D) printing has the potential to 
impact the transmission of information in ways similar to the 
influence of such earlier technologies as photocopying and 
telefacsimile. This review identifies sources of information 
on 3D printing, its technology, required software and 
applications. Although the subject initially may seem to be of 
particular interest to engineers, efforts have been made to 
identify resources relevant to exploring the implications of 
3D printing technologies for those working in the 
information 
sciences: 
librarians, 
archivists, 
museum 
collection specialists, and managers of documentation 
centers and information services in the public and private 
sectors. Accordingly, the following presentation provides 
definitions, reports the results of a literature review, explains 
the technology, and outlines directions for future work. 
    
II.    3D PRINTING DEFINED 
 
     All sources identified through a literature search on the 
subject of 3D printing shared the common characteristic of 
providing a definition. The fundamental idea varies little 
from one source to another. Most agree that 3D printing 
consists of downloading a blueprint or a special computer 
file to a printer capable of 'printing' sophisticated three-
dimensional objects through an additive process that 'prints' 
layers of material [1]-[10]. 
     Bradshaw et al. [3] distinguish three fundamental 
methods for fabricating objects: 1. cutting the object out of a 
block of material; 2. creating a mold and then filling it to 
create the object; or 3. adding shapes together in order to 
make an object. The technology of 3D printing falls into the 
latter category, in which objects with moving parts can be 
created, impossible using the two other methods alone [3] 
[9] [11]. There is however, considerable diversity in actual 
3D printing production.  
     The different techniques have led to certain semantic 
disputes. Wiegler [10] quotes a few researchers who feel 
that the term should be reserved for the particular 3D 
printing technique created by Zcorp, the company credited 
with creating a cheaper 3D printing technique in which a 
nozzle similar to a 'glue gun' is used to print out objects. 
Others believe that the term '3D printing' should be used 
generically, to include all types of additive manufacturing, 
because it is easily understandable by the general public 
[10]. It is this latter connotation which will be adopted in 
this review, employing the term '3D printing'  to encompass 
all techniques that lead to a three dimensional object being 
printed, including such variations as 'selective laser 
sintering' and 'fused deposition modeling', which will be 
explained later.  
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
     As summarized by Weinberg, “the line between a 
physical object and a digital description of a physical object 
may (...) begin to blur. With a 3D printer, having the bits is 
almost as good as having the atoms” [9]. Librarians and 
information professionals, well aware of the important 
contributions of other electronic technologies to the 
disintermediation of information, should be predisposed to 
understand the implications of 3D printing. To assess the 
prevalence of articles on 3D printing in the information 
science literature, a three phase search for relevant articles 
was conducted. The first phase consulted three information 
science databases: Library and Information Science 
Abstracts; Library, Information Science and Technology 
Abstracts; and Library Literature & Information Science 
Full Text. The search terms employed were '3D print*', 
'three-dimens* 
print*', 
'three 
dimens* 
print*' 
and 
'tridimens*print*'. 
When 
search 
results 
proved 
disappointing, a more general literature search was 
conducted in a second phase of the literature review. This 
involved a greater variety of sources, including reports and 
conference proceedings, newspapers, industry publications, 
54

ICDS 2012 : The Sixth International Conference on Digital Society

electronic media and online information, and articles in 
engineering databases. When identified, relevant references 
were subsequently accessed to obtain a more comprehensive 
picture of the subject. Supplementary synonyms for the term 
‘3D printing' found in this broader literature were carefully 
noted so that the initial three information science databases 
could be interrogated again in a third phase of the literature 
review. 
     Results of the three literature searches reveal that most of 
the relevant material on 3D printing has been published 
within the last six years, including many sources less than 
two years old. As a technology, however, 3D printing has 
been around for some time, and commercial printers “have 
existed for years” [10] [12] [13]. Bradshaw et al. [3] 
confirm that the first patent was deposited in 1977. One 
reason for the recent nature of most of the literature is that 
prices for 3D printers have dropped sufficiently that 
individuals can now afford to purchase their own equipment 
[1] [4] [6] [13]. This has encouraged greater interest in the 
possibilities of the technology. 
     The various sources of information frequently approach 
3D printing as a subject quite differently. Newspaper 
articles provide general overviews of the subject, the 'meta 
subjects' and related topics. While they describe printing 
techniques, they rarely employ scientific terms such as 
'fused deposition modeling', for example. This can lead to 
confusion when the full range of 3D printing possibilities is 
not described. Reports provide more in-depth and accurate 
descriptions. Blogs generally post the most recent 
developments, but commercial blogs unsurprisingly tend to 
concentrate on what specific 3D printing companies have to 
offer. Manufacturing company websites tend to provide a 
considerable amount of information about 3D printing as a 
process, including detailed technical information. Those that 
print from files created by customers even provide links to 
web pages for non-commercial software. Unfortunately, 
meta subjects and related topics are rarely covered. 
Engineering articles range from a tight focus on elements of 
3D printing as a process, such as improving the viscosity of 
material to be printed, to more general considerations of 
meta subjects. The Rapid Prototyping Journal is a 
particularly valuable source of engineering articles in this 
regard.  
     Given the information implications of the resources 
identified through the more general literature search, the 
initial search of information science databases was repeated 
to take into account the terms identified in the more general 
literature search. This search yielded only four additional 
results. Two of these articles [14] [15] were by the same 
author, giving a brief assessment of one commercial 3D 
printer and of a particular piece of modeling software. 
Another [16] discussed combining two databases to obtain a 
3D printable file of the outline of buildings in Norway. The 
three articles were very focused on their specific topics, and 
none discussed the information implications of 3D printing.  
     Although also narrowly focused, the fourth article [17] 
does describe an application of 3D printing with information 
implications. It discusses the use of 3D scanners and a 3D 
printer to create replicas of wooden stamps. The article 
concludes by explaining that the stamps are now easier to 
share with other libraries and museums, an illustration of a 
potential contribution 3D printing might make to extending 
access while preserving original archival and museum 
materials. 
     Articles relevant to the information implications of 3D 
printing were also discovered in the more general search 
conducted in the second phase of the literature review. A 
kinematic library was identified which has made 3D 
printable files of kinetic models available online [18]. The 
metadata scheme developed for this library might have 
served as a good starting point for reflecting on the 
classification and cataloguing of 3D printable files, but 
unfortunately, it does not appear to be systematically 
maintained, and many of the supplied links are broken [19]. 
     Two engineering articles also found in the same general 
literature search outlined attempts to create classification 
schemes for 3D printing. Ingole et al. [20] make relevant 
observations about the need for more formalized standards 
for 3D printing and discuss some of the difficulties 
associated with the proprietary standards associated with 
commercial machines. Certain components of the proposed 
classification scheme, such as the use of single digits to 
code subjects, would have benefited from input by 
information professionals. The second engineering article, 
by Mortara et al. [21] demonstrates an awareness of such 
important classification concepts as faceted classification, 
but the proposed classification scheme is clearly aimed at 
engineers, and would not be easy to use for publicly 
accessible repositories. 
III. 
TECHNICAL OVERVIEW 
     This section explains technical aspects of 3D printing 
found in reviewed sources. The utility of 3D printing rests 
in its capacity to cheaply print complex objects, such as 
already linked up chain-mail, using a variety of materials 
[2]. Certain accounts concentrate exclusively on a single 3D 
printing application. Seulin's article [17] on wooden stamps 
is an example. While these resources explain the process 
involved in creating a 3D object, they often focus on a 
specific printing technique and on a specific 3D printer.  
     Areas of interest which have used 3D printing to create 
objects 
include 
aeronautics, 
architecture, 
automotive 
industries, art, dentistry, fashion, food, jewelry, medicine, 
pharmaceuticals, robotics and toys [2] [12] [22]. 3D 
printable files of physical models of educational concepts 
would also interest academic and school libraries. Knapp et 
al. [23] explain that commercial models “are expensive”, 
and give the example of “an anatomical model of the heart” 
which can “cost up to $600.” A 3D printer can be purchased 
for under $1,000 and materials for “even the largest model 
(...) would likely cost under $50” [23]. As noted previously, 
55

ICDS 2012 : The Sixth International Conference on Digital Society

the preservation of artifacts is another potential use of 3D 
printing that would be of interest to information 
professionals [7] [23]. 
     Both open-source and proprietary software may be used 
to acquire digital files of 3D objects during the data 
acquisition phase of production. Lipson and Kurman [6] 
credit “the emergence of cheaper, and increasingly 
accessible computer aided design software (CAD)” for the 
increasing interest in 3D printing. A number of authors 
mention the use of 3D scanning, which uses basic cameras 
and freely provided software, rather than commercial 
systems, to obtain digital data of existing objects [2] [9] [17] 
[22]. 
     Authors also confirm that there is no agreement on file 
formats for 3D printing [6] [20]. The range in the types of 
files that currently exist include PLY files, ObjDF files, RP 
files, STL files VRML files and ZPR files [4] [14] [23]. 
Inacu et al. [23] believe that STL “is, and for the foreseeable 
future, will be the standard mode of data exchange in the 
Rapid Prototyping industry.” Software used to create 
printable 3D files includes modeling software, file 
converters, model 'repair' software to clean-up files, and 
path generating software. 
     Help is also available online for anyone interested in 
creating printable 3D files. Google Sketchup [24], for 
example, does not require a user fee to access a basic level 
of service. Turning a model into a printable 3D file involves 
following instructions from a free tutorial provided by a for 
profit company called Shapeways [25]. 
     Both Cornell University and the University of Bath have 
designed open-source 3D printers which are widely 
recognized for making all 3D printers more affordable: 
Fab@home and RepRap [7] [13]. To acquire one of these 
open-source 3D printers, interested parties obtain the basic 
building materials, follow construction instructions shared 
on Wikis, and then purchase printing supplies [7]. Bath even 
allows the commercial resale of its printers. Lipson and 
Kurman [6] note that Creative Commons initiatives have 
been inspired to work on open-source hardware licenses. 
Fab@home's ultimate objective is to build a machine 
capable of producing “complete, integrated, functional 
electromechanical devices” [7]. The goal for RepRap is to 
enable it to replicate itself by printing out all parts for a new 
RepRap [6].  
     The cost of a RepRap printer in 2010 was about $525, 
and it could replicate 50% of itself [13]. The operating cost 
of 3D printing materials can be less than $1 per cubic inch 
[23]. Caution must be exercised when quoting published 
costing information, however, since prices have been 
dropping so fast that they are quickly outdated. Wiegler [10] 
cites the example of a professor who bought a commercial 
3D printer in 2005 for $31,000, noticed that the price had 
dropped to $19,000 in 2008, and speculated that it would 
drop to $10,000 by 2013. 
     Commercial Printers that use more advanced techniques 
to print objects are usually equipped with proprietary 
software [14]. Companies that sell 3D printers include 3D 
Systems, Objet Geometries, Solido LTD, Stratasys and Z 
Corp [2] [18]. Lipson and Kurman (2010) report that both 
Hewlett Packard and Xerox “are investing in 3D printing 
research and technology development” [6]. 
     Several types of material can be used to print objects. 
Various printers handle a variety of materials, and some can 
even produce objects using more than one type of material. 
While  the most commonly used materials are plastic, 
metals and ceramics,  more exotic materials, such as 
chocolate, may also be used [6] [7]. 
     There are two major variations in printing techniques. In 
one instance, material is deposited on a surface, and the 
depositing implement of the printer pulls up after a layer has 
been deposited in order to deposit the next layer [2]. 
Support material might be put in place to protect the 
structural integrity of the object, but must be removed later 
[15]. In another instance, a layer of powder or liquid is 
present on the printing surface. A binding technique is used 
to change parts of the powder or liquid in the first layer of 
the object. The printing surface is lowered, more powder or 
liquid is added, and the process is repeated to form the next 
layer [26]. The remaining material supports the weight of 
the object as it is built. Binding techniques include adding 
glue to material, adding an 'ink' that solidifies when exposed 
to ultra-violet light, or using a laser to bind material [2] [6]. 
     Although different techniques have specific names, a 
semantic shift in the terms used to describe generic 3D 
printing has resulted in a number of variations. Selective 
laser 
sintering, 
fused 
deposition 
modeling 
and 
stereolithography are among the most often mentioned 
techniques [4] [20] [26] 27]. Stereolithography uses a liquid 
polymer bonded by a laser; laser sintering uses a powder 
which is also bound by a laser; while fused deposition 
modeling simply deposits material on a printing surface 
[28]-[30]. Certain techniques also require post-processing of 
the printed objects in order to solidify them or to improve 
their appearance [26] [31]. Post-processing steps can 
include 'bed manipulation', which entails forcing a change to 
all the material that will only have an effect on bonded 
parts, removing powder or support materials, heating the 
object, or dipping it into something else (infiltration) [26]. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
     Not all technical information about 3D printing could be 
shared in this introduction of the subject. Documenting the 
technology, very much a work-in-progress, must also 
recognize that not all authors agree on the likelihood of 3D 
printing gaining wider dissemination into the homes of 
individuals [10]. Also, as a still emerging technology, 3D 
printing is not without its problems, such as slow printing 
speeds [6]. Nevertheless, as prices are decreasing, the 
number of 3D printers sold worldwide has been growing 
steadily. And as market penetration increases, the 
information implications of 3D printing technologies will 
56

expand as well. These include legal considerations and 
parallels associated with the spread of desktop computers 
[6] [7] [9]. Published works related to the information 
economy [32] [33], the democratization of manufacturing 
[34], and on the concept of the 'long tail' [2] will also 
assume greater significance [6]. 
   The lesson learned from this initial effort to introduce 3D 
printing to information professionals is that explanations of 
the technology will not, as yet, be found in their 
professional literature. Hopefully, however, as they begin to 
appreciate the potential of desktop 3D printing technology, 
information professionals will have more to contribute to a 
greater understanding of its implications.
