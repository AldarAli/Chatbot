Abstract—Since ad hoc networks are infrastructureless and
self-organized, their nodes have to cooperate in order to provide
a particular service such as privacy or node incentives. In this
paper, we elaborate on the cooperation role and management
within the cooperation-based security services available in the
literature. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive classiﬁca-
tion of such services and discuss what type of cooperation is
realized inside of them.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Need for Node Cooperation
Ad hoc networks consist of a set of hosts, more frequently
called nodes, whose main and more frequent characteristics
are [1]:
• Self-organization: nodes coordinate themselves in order
to achieve a common set of goals, which means that there
is no specialised authority in charge of organizing and
orchestrating the network.
• Mobility: nodes can join and leave the network at will and
they can change their position over time. Consequently,
ad hoc networks become highly dynamic, lacking of a
ﬁxed topology.
• Wireless: nodes can communicate with other nodes
through wireless links. If a node wants to communicate
with a node out of its transmission range (i.e., a non-
neighbouring node), packet routing becomes essential.
• Resource constraints: nodes have limited power, CPU,
memory, bandwidth, etc. These limitations incite nodes
to be selﬁsh, trying to share their own resources as little
as possible and trying to use other nodes’ resources as
much as they can.
Due to the dynamic nature of ad hoc networks, relying
on a ﬁxed infrastructure (i.e., servers, routers, public key
infrastructure, etc.) turns out impractical [2]; hence, node
cooperation becomes necessary. For example, if a node wants
to send a message to some distant (i.e., not directly connected)
node, since no router participates in the network, the only
way for the message to be delivered is by having a network’s
subset of nodes cooperating to forward the message towards
the destination.
As shown in the previous example, node cooperation is
essential in ad hoc networks. But not only routing requires
cooperation. Indeed, this paper focuses on the node cooper-
ation realized inside of security services such as privacy or
node incentives.
B. Our Contributions
The main contributions of our work are:
• Service-based classiﬁcation: we propose a comprehensive
service-based classiﬁcation of the most important ad hoc
network security services which have been addressed (at
least once) by a cooperation-based approach.
• Cooperation analysis: for each classiﬁed service, we
analyse a vast number of existing protocols from a
cooperation point of view and describe the type of node
cooperation found, if any.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section
II, we have identiﬁed and classiﬁed the most important ad
hoc network security services whilst analysing the type of
cooperation realized in each of them. Finally, Section III
summarizes the main points presented throughout the paper
and establishes some future research directions.
II. A COMPREHENSIVE CLASSIFICATION
A. Overview
Due to the special characteristics that ad hoc networks
have, the services deployed on top of them should not be
exactly the same as the ones currently used in traditional net-
works. Instead, conventional approaches are being adapted by
cooperation-based models. In this work, we study and classify
the main security schemes applied to ad hoc networks from a
service perspective. Moreover, a cooperation-based analysis is
performed for each classiﬁed service. The different types of
cooperative behaviours are detailed at the end of each category
and references to existing protocols using such behaviours are
provided. Furthermore, in Fig. 1, the classiﬁcation proposed
is depicted.

B. Traditional Security
Many protocols designed for ad hoc networks leave security
issues aside in order to prevent wasting the limited power and
CPU that nodes in ad hoc networks usually have.
The different security services provided in ad hoc networks
can be classiﬁed according to the type of security offered.
This section surveys the cooperation-based schemes proposed
for the security services deployed on top of ad hoc networks.
1) Intrusion Detection: Several works have addressed the
intrusion detection by forcing nodes to cooperate in monitoring
the network, gathering audit data and analysing it by applying
certain behaviour patterns and statistical formulas. This type
of service is usually implemented on a cluster-based ad hoc
architecture.
The main characteristics that this type of service has regard-
ing node cooperation are:
• Collecting audit data: audit data is collected by monitor-
ing the network, a process which can be simultaneously
performed by every node in the network [3], [4], [5] or
by random sets of nodes changing every certain period
of time [6], [7], [8].
• Analysing audit data: audit data can be analysed locally
by each node [4] or can be sent to some special node in
charge of analysing it [3], [5], [6], [7], [8].
• Deciding about an intrusion: based on the analysis results,
deciding whether some abnormal behaviour corresponds
to an intrusion or not can be decided locally by each
analyser node [6], [7], [8] or in consensus by different
analyser nodes [3], [4], [5].
2) Privacy: Privacy protection is usually applied to the
routing process, protecting the sensitive information of
senders, receivers and/or forwarders. But it can also be layered
on top of any other process like the authentication one.
Cooperation-based privacy models are generally character-
ized by:
• Privacy in the routing process: in order to ensure the
privacy the routing process, all the nodes in a particular
route (except usually the destination) forward routing
requests and replies in an anonymous fashion. In order
to do that, different cryptographic algorithms can be
used, being hash chains [9], asymmetric encryption [10],
[11], [12] and symmetric encryption [13] ones of the
most commonly utilized. Note that the onion encryption
scheme is sometimes used together with asymmetric or
symmetric encryption algorithms [11], [12].
• Privacy in the authentication process: a node may need to
sign a message so as to authenticate itself against another
node. In order to protect the privacy of the authenticating
node, protocols can apply blind signatures [14], ring
signatures [15] and group signatures [16].
3) Conﬁdentiality: Conﬁdentiality services prevent nodes
from disclosing messages not intended for them.
A great many conﬁdentiality services provided in ad hoc
networks are based on traditional cryptography (symmetric or
asymmetric), which is non-cooperative. However, there exists
a cooperative scheme used to provide conﬁdentiality in ad hoc
networks: threshold encryption [17], [18], [19].
4) Integrity and Non-repudiation: Most of the services
providing integrity and non-repudiation in ad hoc networks
are based on traditional digital signatures, which are non-
cooperative. However, there exists a cooperative scheme used
to provide integrity and non-repudiation in ad hoc networks:
threshold signatures [20], [21], [22]. Apart from this scheme,
there are others providing integrity in a cooperative fashion:
• In [23], when a node sends a packet to some other node,
the packet is coupled with a report generated by one
of the nodes in the route towards the destination. The
contents of the report are not speciﬁed in the paper. The
reporting node is randomly and secretly (using symmetric
encryption) selected by the sender.
• In [24], each node is monitored by a set of neighbouring
nodes which are in charge of preventing the forwarding
of illegally modiﬁed packets.
5) Authentication: Authentication services allow nodes to
prove to other nodes that they are who they claim to be. Notice
that this type of service can be applied to admission control
but it is not an admission control service itself.
Most of the authentication services provided in ad hoc
networks are based on the traditional two-node certiﬁcate
exchange. Although the exchange itself is not cooperative,
many protocols generate their certiﬁcates in a cooperative
manner using schemes like threshold cryptography [25], [26],
[27]. Apart from the use of threshold cryptography in the
certiﬁcation process, other cooperative schemes exist so as to
provide authentication in ad hoc networks:
• In byzantine fault tolerant authentication schemes [28],
[29], when a node A needs to authenticate a node B, it
requests its trusted group to verify B’s public key KB.
Each trusted group node challenges B with a random
nonce encrypted with KB and B replies to each of them
with a signed message containing the received nonce.
• In [30], each sensor in a WSN requests a set of randomly
chosen peers to authenticate its data.
6) Availability: This type of service depends basically on
two types of availability: data availability and node availability.
The former can be guaranteed by means of data replication
[31]. The latter can be achieved by using powerful devices
(which is out of the scope of this paper) and by preventing
nodes from getting away from their routing responsibilities
(issue that will be discussed later on in Section II-C).
Several cooperation-based data replication schemes share
the following characteristics:
• Electing data managers: some replication protocols relies
on one or more nodes in charge of determining what must
be replicated and where such replicas must be allocated
[31], [32], [33]. The process of electing such nodes can
be achieved by consensus [31], [32] or by some other
approach [33].
• Distributing replicas: most replication protocols distribute
replicas directly from one node (usually the data man-

Classiﬁcation of cooperation-based ad hoc network security services. The height of the boxes representing services (e.g., IDS, privacy, etc.) roughly
indicates the number of cooperation-based schemes which currently provide such service. The symbols (e.g., square, triangle, etc.) placed in the boxes are
associated to types of cooperation (e.g., threshold cryptography, consensus, etc.) and the distance to the baseline roughly indicates the number of cooperation-
based schemes which currently make use of such type of cooperation.
ager) to another (the replica holder) [31], [33], [34];
however, there exist protocols where the data to be
replicated is broadcast in an N-hop area and the receivers
replicate it if some particular conditions are fulﬁlled [32].
7) Key Management: Many of the security services de-
scribed in the previous subsections rely on the use of crypto-
graphic keys (symmetric or asymmetric). Now, we focus on the
process of key generation, distribution, update and revocation.
Key distribution, update and revocation are not usually per-
formed in a cooperative manner [26], [27], even though they
can be fully decentralized. However, there exist cooperative
schemes used to generate keys (symmetric and asymmetric):
• In [35], the private key of a network is cooperatively
constructed: each node in a special set of nodes creates
a partial key and shares it with the other nodes in the
set. With all the partial keys, each node can construct the
private key of the network.
• In [36], a symmetric key is cooperatively constructed us-
ing the multi-party version of the Difﬁe-Hellman protocol
[37].
C. Incentives for Node Cooperation
Although the delivery of messages in an ad hoc network
relies on the cooperation of its nodes, such cooperation does
not always exist. Nodes may refuse to cooperate for many
different reasons [38], [1]: reducing battery consumption,
reducing memory usage, partitioning the network, performing
a DoS attack, etc. Therefore, in order for ad hoc networks to
properly function, nodes must be motivated to cooperate in
forwarding messages.
In the literature, three main techniques are used to promote
node cooperation [39], [40], namely trust models, reputation-
based schemes and credit-based schemes. However, in this
survey we are going to consider trust models as part of
reputation-based schemes since both techniques end up using
a numerical value to determine whether a node can be trusted
or not.
1) Reputation-based Schemes: Reputation-based schemes
determine if a node is trustworthy by considering its rep-
utation. Generally, the reputation of a node is a numerical
value deﬁned as the perception that other nodes have, based
on past observations, about its behaviour [41]. Reputation-
based schemes can be further classiﬁed depending on whether
they use indirect recommendations or not [39]. Schemes using
direct recommendations rely only on local observations and
therefore, nodes do not need to cooperate with other nodes in
order to decide whether another node is trustworthy or not.
Schemes using direct and indirect recommendations, however,
rely not only on local observations but also on other nodes’
observations; consequently, node cooperation is necessary.
Focusing on schemes using direct and indirect recommen-
dations, we proceed to describe their main characteristics
regarding node cooperation:
• Sharing reputation values: reputation values can be shared
as indirect recommendations in a reactive and proactive
manner. When a node asks other nodes for their reputa-
tion values (i.e., the reputation values they have regarding
other nodes) [42], [43] in order to determine or update its
own reputation values, the network is said to be sharing
in a reactive fashion. When a node shares its reputation
values periodically [44], [41], [45] or when a reputation
value reaches a particular threshold [42], [46], [47], the
network is said to be sharing in a proactive fashion.
• Selecting the sharing area: when a node shares its rep-
utation values proactively, it can share them exclusively
with neighbours [41], [44] or with any node in a N-hop
177

area [43], [47], [48] (note that the parameter N may be
ﬁxed for the whole network or variable depending on each
node needs). On the other hand, when a node needs to
communicate with its neighbours to share its reputation
values, ask other nodes for their reputation values or
forward the indirect recommendations received from a
neighbour, it can communicate only with the neighbours
it trusts [41], [48] or with all of them [42], [43], [44],
[45], [46], [47].
• Selecting the range of values to share: nodes can be
restricted to share only positive reputation values [49],
only negative values [47], or both positive and negative
values [41], [42], [44], [45], [46], [48]. So far, the most
common choice is to allow nodes to share any reputation
value.
• Assigning reputation values to new nodes: when a new
node joins a network, its new neighbours must assign it a
reputation value. Such value can be either a default one
[41], [46], [47] or the result of asking other nodes for
their reputation values [42], [45]. Using a default value
forces the system to treat all new nodes in the same
way. Asking other nodes for their reputation values allows
the system to assign past-aware reputation values to new
nodes. Obviously, for this latter technique to be useful, it
is necessary that a new node can be identiﬁed as having
participated in the network in the past.
2) Credit-based Schemes: Credit-based schemes try to pre-
vent nodes from dropping packets by considering the for-
warding process as a chargeable service: nodes forwarding
packets receive micro-payments, and in return, they can use
such micro-payments to send their own packets [50]. Credit-
based schemes can be further classiﬁed as using tamper-proof
hardware or using virtual bankers [39], [51]. Schemes using
tamper-proof hardware ensure that each node will apply the
payment scheme properly by executing all the logic inside a
tamper-proof module. This means that a node does not need to
cooperate with other nodes in order to know if another node
has enough credit to pay its services. Schemes using virtual
bankers rely on one or several nodes in charge of keeping
track of each node’s credit and ensuring that only nodes with
enough credit can send packets. Most of these schemes use
trusted third parties as virtual bankers and thus, nodes do not
need to cooperate with other nodes in order to determine if
a particular node can afford sending a packet. Nevertheless,
there exist a few schemes using virtual bankers where nodes
do cooperate in the payment process:
• In [52], the network is divided in cliques (i.e., groups) and
each clique has a set of delegation nodes (one per wireless
link) and a master. Periodically, the delegation nodes
collect, compute and send to the master node information
about ﬂow rates. The master uses this information to
calculate a list of prices and then, sends it to all the
delegation nodes in its clique.
• In [53], each node broadcasts the set of price coefﬁcients
that it will use to charge other nodes. Although the paper
does not specify how the payment is actually performed,
it is obvious that some virtual banker must exist to ensure
that the broadcast prices are correct.
III. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
This paper focused on cooperative ad hoc network security
services. We proposed a comprehensive service-based classiﬁ-
cation of the most important ad hoc network security services
which have been addressed (at least once) by a cooperation-
based approach.
Our analysis shows that node cooperation is not widely
deployed in all types of ad hoc network services, in spite of
the fact that node cooperation can provide services with a high
level of robustness, fault-tolerance and completeness. For this
reason, we are currently studying the possibility of including
node cooperation inside ad hoc anonymous authentication
services.
