Abstract— In this paper, it is intended to describe the design 
process, planning, and development of a new Data Logger System 
(DLS) that can be potentially used in acquiring sensor signals in 
the landing gear of aircraft. This paper is presenting the new 
concept and development process of the DLS that employs a 
novel low-power pulse mode circuit structure. It outlines the 
overview of the sensor acquisition system and manufacturing of 
the DLS housing to fit the partner's requirements. The conducted 
work is broken down into several phases, these include 
conceptual design, development, production, and testing. 
 
Keywords—data acquisition; low power; multi-channel 
sensing; landing gear. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Timely and accurate detection of aircraft status signals such 
as the landing gear is a basic guarantee of its normal operation 
and also improves aircraft reliability and reduces potential risks 
through taking timely and effective measures [1]-[6]. 
The proposed DLS in this paper is adopting a novel data 
acquisition system to reduce overall system power consumption 
and provide an effective 32 multi-channel sensing capability that 
outputs signals with varying ranges. To accommodate the 
different parts of the DLS including power management and 
data processing, a modular housing design is being used to meet 
the requirements of a rigid system that can withstand the harsh 
environment in aircraft landing gear and provide flexible testing 
accessibility. The new design is addressing a major sensing 
data challenge in the aviation industry which required a 
reliable and sustainable system that runs effectively under 
severe environmental flying conditions. A new low-power 
strategy was adopted in our design based on power sampling 
for sensor array which allows the integration of additional 
sensors without complicating overall system development. 
Section II is outlining the system design overview. The 
description of the new development will be presented in 
section IV. The structure design is given in section V, whereas 
the design verification and testing results are presented in 
section VI. 
 
II. DESIGN OVERVIEW 
The system design requirements obtained from the industry 
partner are summarized in Table I. The desired low average 
current could only be achieved by implementing a high-speed 
configuration that would complete all the action in a small 
fraction of the sampling period, remaining in sleep mode the 
rest of the time. This ratio (active/sleep) determines how much 
is comparatively high active mode consumption reduced to an 
acceptable low average.  
 
 
 
That means, all the procedures (sampling, A/D conversion, 
and memory update) should be as short, as only possible 
compared to the sampling period. The description of the system, 
designed to meet these requirements follows. 
To provide the shortest available sampling time, along with 
minimum power loss, no voltage regulator has been used to 
power the sensor circuitry (due to long power on/off time). The 
sensors are powered dynamically (with exponentially rising 
voltage); A high-speed comparator disconnects the sampling 
keys from the set of sampling capacitors when the sensor driving 
voltage achieves the threshold. It is assumed, that the response 
of the sensor is linear related to driving voltage. To avoid errors 
related to sensor output impedance, the signals from sensors are 
applied via buffer amplifiers as seen in the system diagram 
presented in Figure 1. 
The maximum slew rate of sensor driving voltage is 
limited by the slew rate of buffering amps that could be as 
high as  2V/us. To avoid errors, related to the response time of 
the comparator, the driving voltage is also sampled, providing 
the possibility for further software correction.

III. FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION APPROACH 
Since the system is battery-powered and should provide long 
battery life, its power consumption becomes the determining 
factor for setting the system structure. The size and weight of the 
battery are limited as well, so the available battery of acceptable 
size is a pack of 4 cells (3.6 V, 2600 mAh, series-parallel), that 
is, 5200 mAh. 
Typically, the capacity of the battery is limited by its 
discharge to approx. 5.5V is around 60-65% of the total and is 
actually 3120-3380 mAh. That yields, that the average current 
consumption should be within 1.73 -1.88 mA (for 1800 hours 
of operation). The desired low average current could only be 
achieved if the system is operated in pulse mode, completing all 
the necessary actions (A/D conversion, memory interfacing, 
etc.) in a small fraction of the sampling period, remaining in 
sleep the rest of the time. 
The ratio of active/sleep mode of each element of the system 
will determine this element’s average current, the sum of these, 
being the whole system average current, should be within the 
required limit. The second important point is, that the sensors 
used have a significantly different range of output signals 
(from volts to millivolts) on one hand and that the physical 
length of cables might be up to 1-1.5m. This makes the use of 
buffer amplifiers on sensors compulsory, to bring the signal 
levels to an acceptable range and avoid pickup on signal lines by 
providing low output impedance. More to the point, some types 
of sensors have differential output, while the common-mode 
voltage is high enough – that means, two types of buffering 
amplifiers are to be designed. 
At the first stage of this work, however, to speed up the 
development, it was planned to test the system with 
comparatively simple non-inverting amplifiers and imitation of 
sensor signals from resistor dividers. After completing the 
conversion, the ADC is brought to the full-sleep mode by the 
microcontroller, bringing its consumption from 3.3mA in active 
mode down to 1uA. 
 
IV. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
This section will be presenting the design methodology and 
data processing control adopted in this work as illustrated by the 
following subsections. 
A. Measurement Method 
In order to provide the shortest possible sampling time, the 
sensors are powered dynamically (with exponentially rising 
voltage). During this time the keys remain closed, and sensor 
voltages are transferred to sample holding capacitors as shown 
in Figure 1. 
It is assumed, that due to the passive and purely resistive 
nature of the sensors, their response is directly proportional to 
powering voltage. As soon as the powering voltage is applied to 
the inverting input of the high-speed comparator via the divider 
to achieve the threshold, the output of the comparator goes low, 
opening the keys, thus disconnecting sample holding capacitors 
from the signal lines, and at the same time switching off the 
sensor power by resetting the flip-flop. 
Signal end of conversion (EOFC) is provided to MCU to indicate 
that the A/D conversion of the voltages present on sample holding 
capacitors may begin. To avoid any errors related to comparator 
delay time and threshold variation, the sensor power voltage is 
sampled in addition to sensor signals to provide the possibility to 
recalculate the obtained readings.

B. Considerations for A/D conversion 
Since the time for the conversion should be minimized, 
usage of ADC built-in to the microcontroller is inapplicable in 
principle, due to the very long conversion time. The (EOFC) 
signal is provided to MCU to indicate that the A/D conversion 
of the voltages present on sample holding capacitors may begin. 
To achieve acceptable time from the structure depicted in 
Figure 1, The voltages, obtained on sampling capacitors, are 
applied via 32-to-1 multiplexor to a fast (800ns) ADC. The 
output code is a 12-bit parallel, which allows the controller to 
get one conversion result in one read instruction. That means, 
32 words of data could be obtained in 32us. Additionally, the 
ADC used has its in-built clock source and stable reference 
voltage (used to provide threshold for comparator) as given in 
the system timing chart in Figure 2. 
 
C. Considerations for microcontroller choice 
The microcontroller should be able to accept the data from 
the ADC without delay and accept and generate all the necessary 
control signals without slowing down A/D conversion (that 
determines its minimum parallel bus speed). However, stricter 
requirement arises out of necessity to transfer the data to external 
memory. The data amount for a single transfer is 33 words of 
16-bit (32 data and timestamp from RTC). This also requires 
choosing the fastest available interfacing to external memory. 
 
V. STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
The DLS is designed to be as compact as possible. The 
original concept, shown below in Figure 3, incorporates two 
separate modules, the Main module, and the Battery-Memory 
module. 
 
Figure. 3. DLS structural design 
 
Now that the preliminary battery selection and media storage 
selection was performed and know the approximate volume 
requirements, a new concept design was proposed. The idea of 
the concept is that the battery cell can be removed for charging 
and the media storage also can be removed for data download as 
shown in Figure 4. 
 
VI. DATA ACQUISITION VERIFICATION AND TESTING RESULTS 
To verify the performance of both data logger systems  
a number of resistive potentiometers of various ranges were 
used as dummy sensors. From a design perspective, the main 
focus is to get the dynamic sensors' power circuitry working as 
desired and then extract the necessary ADC waveforms and 
match them with the device datasheet. Such practice was useful 
in debugging and testing to overcome many issues before 
getting the system prototype functioning as expected. Figure 5 
shows some of the sensors' power and conversion signals, 
where obviously they are very comparable with the ones in 
Figure 2.

A. Integration with Industrial Sensor and Test Results 
The next phase of the testing process was to use a real 
industrial sensor interfaced to the Design system and use the 
developed Graphical Unser Interface (GUI) to monitor and 
record the multi-channel sensors' data acquisition via serial 
interface, these sensors are: 
▪ 
Thermocouple temperature sensor 
▪ 
Linear Displacement Potentiometer sensor (0- 
300mm) 
▪ 
Pressure sensor (5 Ins max) 
▪ 
Load cell strain gauge sensor 
An interface board was manufactured with sensors mounted 
and all signals and power necessary connections are provided as 
shown in Figure 6. 
 
Figure. 6. Industrial sensor system setup using DLS 
 
The DLS system performance was tested and verified using 
the sensors interface board and sensors readings were displayed 
by the developed GUI. Special single-ended input and 
differential amplifiers were designed for low-level sensor 
signals, like thermocouples and strain gauge sensors. 
The enclosure of the DLS was designed using rapid 
prototyping. Figure 7 shows the side and top views of the 
designed enclosure where it can be seen the two main units are 
attached to fit both the system PCBs and battery. 
The main functionality of the developed GUI is to show the 
incoming data from the DLS unit. The programming language 
used for programming this GUI was Visual Basic.NET from 
the 
Microsoft 
Visual 
Studio.NET 
package. 
The 
communication is done through COM ports and the data is sent 
in HEX format in a specific format (frame) which then is read in 
GUI and interpreted (parsed). The data is shown in a master 
graph for each channel as given in Figure 8 where each 
individual graph can be added and associated with specific 
given user options that can be set to modify the visual display 
of the GUI.

B. Measuring DLS power consumption 
The average current, consumption by the system is the sum 
of all quiescent currents of constantly powered elements ( CPU 
in sleep mode ( max.25uA), comparator (90uA max ), flip-flop 
(2uA max) and two voltage regulators ( 2x35=70uA max)), and 
the average current of the components powered for a short time. 
Using the time chart, the following equation can be obtained : 
 
𝐼𝑎𝑣𝑔 = 187uA + 𝐼𝑎𝑑𝑐𝑇𝑎𝑑𝑐 + 𝐼𝑎𝑚𝑝1𝑇𝑎𝑚𝑝1+𝐼𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 + (𝑇𝑎𝑑𝑐 + 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓) ∗ 𝐼𝐶𝑃𝑈
𝑇𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒
 
 
The equivalent time for sensor activity ( under the condition 
of powering by constant 5V voltage ) is less than 2us. ( at 400mA 
current ) 
Then, at Tsample = 7812.5us, 
 
𝐼𝑎𝑣𝑔
= 187uA
+ 3.3𝑚𝐴 ∗ 40𝑢𝑠 + 31𝑚𝐴 ∗ 4𝑢𝑠 + 400𝑚𝐴 ∗ 2𝑢𝑠 + (40𝑢𝑠 ∗ 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓) ∗ 60𝑚𝐴
7812.5us

= 622uA + 60mA 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓
7812.5us 
 
That guarantees, that for interface time that is less than 143us, 
the average system current will remain within the limit. At the 
same time, if interfacing is fast enough, it is possible to reduce 
the speed of the system ( for better accuracy and reliability ). 
The DLS current consumption was measured using in-circuit 
metering for two options, with and without pulse-mode 
operation concept as shown in Table II.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 
In this work, a novel sensor data logging system has been 
introduced. The system design is utilizing the pulse-mode 
dynamic power concept where output sensors are sampled 
through switched capacitors and then sensor power is turned off 
to start the ADC process. It was found the system power has 
been significantly reduced by more than (3:1) as can be seen in 
Table I to meet the requirements of low power consumption 
and extended battery lifetime. 
The overall DLS design has been placed in a developed 
modular housing that incorporated the power source and storage 
components. A GUI has been developed to test the system 
output signals using industrial-rated sensors. 
Planning for future work will be involving future testing 
on the sensing side and improving the power consumption 
performance. Also, the GUI is to be further developed to 
 include more features on system-measured parameters.
