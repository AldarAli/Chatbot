Abstract - In this research, sensor devices were developed for 
application to seismic observation to understand damage 
conditions after earthquakes and to structural health 
monitoring for the maintenance of buildings and civil 
infrastructures. To apply the sensor devices, they must be 
densely installed in a broad area and measurement data with 
synchronized time must be obtained. It is desirable that the 
sensor devices themselves keep accurate time information even 
in environments with no available network or Global 
Positioning System (GPS) signals. Therefore, a sensor device 
was 
developed 
that 
keeps 
accurate 
time 
information 
autonomously using a Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC), which 
consumes ultra-low power, can be mounted on a small board, 
and is an ultra-high precision clock. This paper explains the 
CSAC and a mechanism to add highly accurate time 
information to the measured data using the CSAC. Next, the 
paper discusses the process of development from prototype to 
practical device as well as improvement results to solve 
challenges identified in the actual use at a bridge. Finally, the 
paper demonstrates the usability of the developed sensor device 
using a case study where seismic observation was implemented 
by installing the improved devices in an actual building.

 INTRODUCTION 
Due to degradation of buildings and civil infrastructures, 
such as bridges, and highways over time, automation of 
inspection for their maintenance and management is an urgent 
social issue. Also, since there are many earthquakes in Japan, 
it is required to detect the damage of the structure immediately 
after the earthquake and to grasp the situation of the urban 
damage. In order to detect those abnormal situations, data 
collection and analyses by a group of sensors are necessary. 
Sensors were developed for seismic observation and structural 
health monitoring applying wireless sensor network 
technology, and their performance in a skyscraper was 
demonstrated [1]-[3]. One important challenge in this research 
was time synchronization among sensors. To analyze a group 
of data measured by multiple sensors and assess structural 
safety, time synchronization among the sensors must be kept. 
In the wireless sensor network system, the time 
synchronization was materialized through transmission of 
wireless packets among the sensors [3]. However, the wireless 
sensor network technology is not practically applied to 
multiple buildings, long-span structures, such as bridges, or 
broad urban spaces. If sensors installed in various locations 
are 
capable 
of 
keeping 
accurate 
time 
information 
autonomously, this problem can be solved. Using Global 
Positioning System (GPS) signals is effective for outdoor 
situations, but it is not available inside buildings, underground, 
under bridges, or in tunnels. Therefore, a prototype sensor 
device capable of maintaining accurate time information 
autonomously was developed using a Chip Scale Atomic 
Clock (CSAC) [4]-[6], which is a high-precision clock and 
very accurate compared with crystal resonators [7][8]. Then, 
the prototype device was upgraded for higher functionality 
and practical application to develop a practical device [9]. 
In addition, in order to apply the developed sensor device 
to earthquake observation, logic to detect the occurrence of an 
earthquake and store data of only earthquake events was 
implemented and confirmed its function in shaking table 
experiment [10][11]. These tests confirmed the performance 
of the sensor device that can maintain accurate time 
information autonomously and showed that the device is 
applicable to seismic observation and structural health 
monitoring of buildings and civil infrastructures. 
In this article, Section 2 shows the existing time 
synchronization methods and describes their problems and 
achievement of the development of sensor device proposed in 
this study. Section 3 describes CSAC and explains the 
mechanism for providing ultra-high accurate time information 
to sensor data by the CSAC. Section 4 describes the 
development of a practical module from its prototype. Section 
5 lists problems that were extracted when the practical 
modules were installed on an actual bridge, and describes 
details of improvements made to cope with these problems. 
Further, Section 6 shows actual examples where a developed 
sensor device is applied to a building structure. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
A time synchronizing function is indispensable for sensor 
devices that are used for seismic observation and structural 
health monitoring. Unless a data group where time 
synchronization is ensured is obtained, a time history analysis 
employing phase information cannot be made. For example, it 
is difficult to clarify a phenomenon where seismic waves 
propagate through the ground. Moreover, it is not possible to 
make a modal analysis or an analysis for damage evaluation

of a structure. Many studies have been carried out so far in 
relation to the time synchronized sensing, including the GPS 
that makes use of a radio clock or a satellite, and the Network 
Time Protocol (NTP) [12] designed for time synchronization 
on the internet. There are also studies where time 
synchronization is realized by making use of the 
characteristics of a radio sensor network where a propagation 
delay is small. For example, time-synchronizing protocols 
have been studied, which include Reference Broadcast 
Synchronization (RBS), Timing-sync Protocol for Sensor 
Networks (TPSN), and Flooding Time synchronization 
Protocol (FTSP) [13]-[17]. However, although these time 
synchronizing technologies are widely used even now, they 
cannot constitute an optimum means for sensor devices for use 
in seismic observation and structural health monitoring. 
Specifically, the GPS cannot be used inside a building, and the 
time synchronizing accuracy of the NTP is not sufficient. The 
time synchronizing method employing the radio technology is 
highly useful, but it is not ensured that the radio 
communication is always available. In particular, if the 
wireless communication is interrupted at the time of an 
earthquake, time synchronization cannot be performed. 
In this study, a prototype of a sensor module for 
autonomously keeping accurate time information is developed 
by making use of a CSAC that is an ultra-high accurate clock, 
and an improvement is carried out on the prototype for a 
practical application. Even though a tremendous number of 
sensors are installed in the buildings and civil infrastructures, 
in case accurate time information can autonomously be given 
to the data measured by those sensors, time synchronization 
can be ensured between the sensors only by collecting the data 
using an arbitrary means and by realigning the data utilizing 
the time information. The data group where the time 
synchronization is ensured by using the sensor device 
proposed in this paper is available for an analysis intended to 
grasp a seismic phenomenon or evaluate the damage of a 
structure. 
III. 
TIME STAMPING MECHANISM USING CHIP SCALE 
ATOMIC CLOCK 
A CSAC has time accuracy equivalent to that of a 
rubidium atomic clock and is very accurate compared with 
crystal resonators [4][6]. The CSAC can achieve ultra-
precision time measurement at a level of some ten 
picoseconds, consumes low power and is small enough to be 
mounted on a circuit board (Table Ⅰ).

The development of the CSAC started with the support of 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the 
commercial product was released by an American company in 
2011 and is still available for purchase. Recently, ultra-small 
atomic clock systems, which can be mounted on general 
communication terminals, such as smart phones, have been 
proposed, and further downsizing and price reduction are 
expected. If the sensor device is equipped with a CSAC and a 
mechanism that adds time stamping for every sample of 
measured data, the sensor device can create data having high-
accuracy time information. Each sensor device autonomously 
keeps highly accurate time information even if the GPS 
signals and network communication are unavailable. 
Therefore, by collecting the measured data by means, such as 
3G, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc., a data group ensuring time 
synchronization can be obtained. 
To configure a sensing system composed of multiple 
sensor devices equipped with a CSAC, one device is set as a 
master device and other devices as slave devices must be 
synchronized by defining absolute time information. The 
main controller of each sensor device is equipped with an 
input/output connector for 1 Pulse Per Second (PPS) of the 
CSAC. Using this connector, the master device outputs 1 PPS 
signal, and each slave device inputs it to synchronize and 
match the phase of the CSAC in each slave device. The CSAC 
keeps accurate time, but it does not have absolute time 
information. Therefore, it must be defined separately. At 
initial settings, the GPS module installed in the main 
controller is used. Absolute time information is transmitted 
from the master device to the slave device by the IEEE 1588 
standard. Once all the sensor devices are synchronized at the 
beginning, they continue keeping highly accurate time 
information autonomously. It is only necessary to install the 
sensor device in an arbitrary place and collect data. As 
mentioned above, any means of data collection, such as 
Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or 3G, are available as the measured data 
records accurate time stamping. The sensors are also suitable 
for use as mobile measurement and a mobile sensing system 
because the sensors can measure and collect data even if GPS 
signals are not available, and a wireless or wired network 
cannot be used. 
IV. 
DEVELOPMENT OF SENSOR DEVICE EQUIPPED WITH 
CSAC 
The general sensor device is composed of a sensor chip, 
CPU, filter, A/D converter, memory, and network interface, 
and a crystal oscillator is used as the clock of the CPU. If 
CSAC is installed in the sensor device and measurement is 
performed while correcting the clock of the CPU, a delay 
occurs because CSAC's clocking accuracy is too high. 
Therefore, a mechanism having a special Field Programmable 
Gate Array (FPGA) was developed to add time information 
from the CSAC to the data measured by the sensor directly. 
The FPGA not only adds the time information of the CSAC to 
the measured data but can also incorporate logic, such as 
seismic detection. A prototype device was developed first to 
identify challenges, and then a practical device that has solved 
the challenges was developed.

A. Prototype Device 
Fig. 1 shows the developed prototype device. The 
prototype device is composed of a mainboard, sensor board, 
and wireless communication board. The mainboard 
incorporates a CSAC, FPGA, CPU, memory, network 
interface, etc. The sensor board is detachable. Two types of 
sensor board were developed, one of which is an 
acceleration 
sensor 
board 
equipped 
with 
a 
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer, 
temperature sensor, anti-aliasing filter, A/D converter, etc., 
and the other is an external sensor board that can connect an 
analog sensor externally via the Bayonet Neill-Concelman 
(BNC) connector (Fig. 2). The communication board is also 
detachable and can collect data using wireless network once 
mounted on the mainboard. Two types of dedicated board 
equipped with Wi-Fi or 3G were developed. 
B. Practical Device 
The following improvements were made for high 
functionality and practical use of the prototype device. 
  
1) 3-channeled external analog sensor input interface 
2) 24-bit A/D converter

Figure 2.  External Sensor Board. 
3) Enhanced FPGA 
4) Separate wireless communication to use commercially 
available Raspberry Pi  
5) Time synchronization by IEEE 1588 
 
The practical device is composed of a board and Raspberry 
Pi having a wireless communication function (Fig. 3) and is 
enclosed in a dedicated case (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 3, the 
board of the practical device is composed of a main control 
unit and a sensor unit. The main control unit is equipped with 
a CSAC, FPGA, GPS, CPU, memory, and network interface. 
The main control unit controls measurement of the sensor 
while producing time stamping, based on highly accurate time 
information from the CSAC. The device sends the 
measurement data via Ethernet or wireless communication to 
the network after saving data in an SD card. The device saves 
two types of data, one of which is regularly measured data and 
the other is extracted seismic event data. The device sends 
data containing seismic events solely to the network 
immediately after an earthquake using the FPGA to detect 
start and end of the earthquake. A GPS is installed in the 
device to initialize and adjust the time information. The sensor 
takes measurements following a command from the main 
control unit. The sensor is equipped with a 3-axis MEMS 
accelerometer, 3-channel external analog sensor input 
interface, temperature sensor, anti-aliasing filter, and A/D 
converter. The wireless communication uses commercially 
available Raspberry Pi to enable data collection with wireless 
communication. Either Wi-Fi or 3G is selectively used for the 
wireless communication. 
Compared with the prototype device, the practical device 
incorporates a 3-channel external analog sensor input 
interface and 24-bit A/D converter, so it can connect with a 
sensor requiring a wide dynamic range, such as a servo 
accelerometer. In addition, the sensor device can be used as a 
data logger by connecting with three strain sensors, 
displacement centers, etc. Using Raspberry Pi for the wireless 
communication, the device can quickly respond to new 
wireless communication formats. Furthermore, an interface of 
IEEE 1588 standard for time synchronization of network was 
incorporated to initialize measurement timing among sensor 
devices and synchronize them. 
V. 
IMPROVEMENT OF PRACTICAL DEVICE 
The developed practical device was installed onto an 
actual bridge, and measurement was performed for three 
months to identify challenges in practical use. Based on those 
challenges, the practical device was improved for higher 
stability and operability, and the specified performance was 
confirmed. Improvement items and contents are as follows. 
A. Reduction in Built-in SD Card Access 
To avoid failures caused by total service life consumed by 
the number of rewrite cycles resulting from the quality of the 
SD card (micro SD card) or compatibility issues, the timing 
to write in the file system was reviewed. By setting the 
interval of the write timing to the file system from 5 seconds 
to 240 seconds, access is suppressed to a maximum of 1/48,  
as shown in Table Ⅱ.

However, risk of data loss during emergency black out 
increases, which means it is a trade-off. Table Ⅱ shows the 
effects of reduction in access to the built-in SD card. 
B. File Compression of Measured Data 
In the actual work installed onto the bridge, transmission 
time for the measured data must be reduced. To reduce the 
data transmission time and achieve storing long-term 
measurement data, a file compression function was added. 
From the viewpoint of durability, it is desirable to use a 
relatively small capacity SD card, which is considered to be 
manufactured in a stable production line rather than a large 
capacity one which might be manufactured in a premature 
production line. The file compression function is important 
as a means to materialize long-term data recording in a small 
capacity SD. The software was improved to compress the 
measured data to be recorded in the SD card after 75 minutes. 
C. Change of Local PC Collecting Display 
A tool was developed to collect the measured data saved in 
the built-in SD card of the practical device placed in the LAN, 
which was temporarily installed on the site into a local PC 
using a browser. However, there was a possibility that time 
information not related to measurement data might be 
displayed depending on the startup environment in the 
measurement data download screen (Fig. 5). Specifically, by 
adjusting the time of Raspberry Pi with the FPGA on the 
baseboard, improvements were made so that the correct time 
information of the measurement data is displayed regardless 
of the activation environment. However, even without this 
improvement, there is no effect on the high precision time 
information recorded in the measurement data. 
D. Correction of PTP Control Software 
The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) defined in the IEEE-
1588 standard is a means to synchronize time of computers 
on a LAN highly accurately. The CSAC is a high precision 
clock, but it does not keep absolute time information. 
Therefore, clock adjustment was made with the CSAC and 
then the absolute time was set to the timer counter of the 
FPGA by the PTP in the practical device. In the actual work 
at the bridge, there was a risk that the absolute time set by the 
PTP may be initialized due to plugging and unplugging of the 
LAN cable. Such phenomenon is not desirable for the 
practical 
device 
although 
it 
follows 
the 
standard 
implementation and specifications of Linux as the PTP must 
be operated with a LAN cable connected. Therefore, the 
settings were corrected so that the absolute time would not be 
initialized and would be kept between two practical devices 
(master device and slave device) whose absolute time had 
been set by the PTP even if the Ethernet cable was plugged 
and unplugged.

E. Minimization of Wiring Delay in the FPGA 
Depending on the circuit design of the FPGA, the time 
stamping may not be correctly recorded due to fluctuation of 
timing to read and write the memory from the FPGA. The 
wiring delay of the SDRAM control signal in the FPGA was 
minimized so that the timing to read and write the memory 
from the FPGA would not fluctuate. The FPGA circuit was 
redesigned and implemented in the new practical sensor 
device. It was confirmed that the continuous operation test 
for 2 months was conducted for the four devices and the time 
information was correctly displayed. 
VI. 
APPLICATION TO ACTUAL BUILDING 
The developed new practical devices were installed in an 
actual building and seismic observation started in October 
2017. The building is a three-story reinforced concrete 
building built in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan (Fig. 6). In each floor, 
one practical device was installed. Fig. 7 shows the plan of 2nd 
floor of the building and locations of the practical devices 
installed. Fig. 8 shows how the devices have been installed. 
As shown in both figures, dedicated installation space was 
made next to the staircase from 1st to 3rd floors. At each 
installation location, the device was screwed to the acrylic 
plate and it was fixed to the floor with an anchor. The device 
for the rooftop is fixed on the ceiling of the 3rd floor because 
the rooftop floor is outside.

Figure 7.  Plan view of 2nd floor of the building and locations of practical 
device installed. 
The sensor device is able to use the built-in MEMS 
accelerometer and any analog sensor connected to the external 
input terminal solely. This time, the device is set to use the 
built-in MEMS accelerometer to measure shaking of small-
scale to large-scale earthquakes. Table Ⅲ shows the 
specifications of the MEMS accelerometer. This new practical 
device can detect earthquake occurrence and save seismic 
event data. The least square calculation for values measured 
by the accelerometer in each direction is derived by the 
following equation.

The device was set to judge that an earthquake has occurred 
when the least square value 𝑙௥ for 2 seconds exceeds 1 cm/sec2 
and to save the measurement data until the earthquake ends 
under the condition of a sampling frequency of 100 Hz and a 
number of correction values of zero point N = 200 in the above 
equation. The device also saves data 10 seconds before the 
point that the device judged that the earthquake has occurred 
and 10 seconds after the earthquake has ended. As shown in 
Section 3, each practical device is equipped with Ethernet, 
Wi-Fi, and 3G as communication means and can use any of 
them. For this time, it was decided to use 3G for data transfer 
to the data server in order to store only the measurement data 
at the event of the earthquake. 
Table Ⅳ shows a list of seismic records observed from 
October 2017 when the system was installed to November 
2017. When an earthquake with Japanese seismic intensity 
scale of 1 or more occurred, measurements were made reliably. 
Fig. 9 shows measured acceleration of an earthquake in the 
building, which occurred on November 3, 2017 (No.8 in Table

Fig. 9 shows measured results of the 1st floor and the 3rd 
ceiling (floor of the rooftop) in a horizontal direction, 
respectively. For the 1st floor, an acceleration of 10.2 cm/sec2 
at the maximum is observed. For the rooftop, the vibration of 
the earthquake is amplified and the maximum value of the 
acceleration is greater. Function and usability of the improved 
practical device, which was installed onto an actual building, 
were verified by the case study of seismic observation. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
This paper describes research and development on the 
sensor devices that can keep highly accurate time information 
autonomously using the built-in Chip Scale Atomic Clock 
(CSAC) for the purpose of application to seismic observation 
and structural health monitoring of buildings and civil 
infrastructure. First, a process of development was explained 
from the prototype, which uses the mechanism that adds 
highly accurate time information to the measured data with the 
CSAC to the practical device. Then, challenges in practical 
use were identified by the long-term measurement 
implemented by installing the developed practical device onto 
a bridge. Based on the challenges, further improvements were 
made for stability and operability of the practical device, and 
its performance was confirmed. In addition, the improved 
practical device was installed onto an actual building, and its 
usability was verified by the case study of seismic observation. 
As one of challenges, the operating method of the sensing 
system must be considered depending on the objective of 
measurement because the CSAC is aged over time although it 
is a highly accurate clock. Another challenge is the high cost 
of manufacture. The CSAC is expected to be mounted on all 
computers and smart phones in the near future, but only one 
American company manufactures and sells it at this time. It is 
expected that many companies will also participate in the
