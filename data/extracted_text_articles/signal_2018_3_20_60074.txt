Abstract—High speed targets (e.g., aircraft, satellite) imaging is 
crucial for air traffic safety and space surveillance. Based on 
the target motion model, the characteristics of the multi-
component linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal caused 
by the high speed motion are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, 
a novel method based on the chirp Fourier transform and 
Shannon minimum entropy principle for high speed targets 
Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging is proposed. 
Firstly, according to the velocity scope, the chirp rate interval 
is established. Secondly, the corresponding phase term is 
constructed to compensate the quadratic phase term caused by 
the high speed motion. After the range compression, the range 
profile with minimum entropy is regarded as the optimal 
compensated profile, and finally the required ISAR image is 
formed by the cross-range compression. The simulation 
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain 
better ISAR images than the classic range doppler algorithm 
and fractional Fourier transform algorithm.

(ISAR); chirp-Fourier transform; minimum entropy. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Radar can actively transmit electromagnetic waves, and 
then extract the target information from the received echoes. 
In this sense, radar can explore targets in any time and under 
any circumstance. Due to the limitation of resolution, the 
targets observed by the traditional radars are generally 
considered as point targets with position and motion 
parameters. With the development of modern wideband 
radar, the capability of radar has been expanded from target 
detection, location, and tracking to target imaging, which 
greatly improves the ability of radar targets recognition. 
Therefore, radar imaging has become a research frontier in 
the field of radar signal processing. Inverse Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (ISAR), as a representative application in the 
radar imaging domain, has the ability of acquiring target 
image with electromagnetic information. In detail, based on 
the scattering point model, ISAR obtains high range 
resolution by transmitting wideband signal, and derives high 
cross-range resolution from the Doppler effect produced by 
relative rotation between radar and target [1].  
As a classical imaging method in the domain of ISAR 
imaging, the Range-Doppler (RD) algorithm forms a two-
dimensional high resolution ISAR image by using a two-
dimensional Fourier transform along the range and the cross-
range directions respectively [2][3]. However, the RD 
algorithm is only valid for the low speed moving targets and 
is not suitable for the high speed targets. The reason lies in 
the fact that, within a pulse duration time, the moving 
distance of a high speed target with approximately a few 
kilometers per second (e.g., satellite, space station) will 
exceed one range cell, which is in contradiction with the 
“stop and go” preconditions required by the RD algorithm 
and may cause the problem of range profile distortion 
[4][5][6].  
Many methods have been proposed to solve the problem 
of range profile distortion of the high speed targets. Zhang et 
at. [6] proposed a velocity compensation method， where 
Wigner Distribution and Radon transform were utilized to 
estimate the velocity of high speed targets in advance. But 
the cross terms generated by Wigner Distribution made the 
velocity difficult to estimate. Fractional Fourier transform 
(FRFT) and Shannon minimum entropy principle were 
combined for velocity estimation in [7]. However, the 
multiple scattering points model has a great impact on the 
peak search in FRFT, and may lead to pseudo-peak location. 
A novel high speed motion compensation method based on 
Keystone transform and FRFT was proposed by Li et al. [8] 
in 2017. 
It 
should be 
noted 
that 
the 
numerous 
approximations in the method may lead to a series of biases 
in the results. In conclusion, most of the existing ISAR 
imaging methods follow the strategy of ‘velocity estimation, 
velocity compensation, range compression and cross-range 
compression’, which complicates the imaging process and 
magnifies the error propagation of the velocity estimation.  
Since the velocity estimation is only an intermediate step 
of ISAR imaging, this paper proposes a method to 
accomplish velocity estimation and range compression 
simultaneously by using chirp Fourier transform and 
Shannon minimum entropy principle. After that, the Fourier 
transform along cross-range direction is implemented to 
obtain the ISAR image. This method can avoid the peak 
search biases in FRFT and reduce the complexity of the 
imaging algorithm, while maintaining the quality of ISAR 
imaging results. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
deals with the high speed target echo model and the origin of 
range distortion. Section III is devoted to the definition of 
chirp Fourier transform, the concrete process of velocity 
compensation, and the range compression based on chirp 
Fourier transform. The simulation results are demonstrated 
and discussed in Section IV. Section V draws conclusion on 
the proposed imaging method.

HIGH SPEED TARGETS ECHO MODEL AND RANGE 
DISTORTION 
The geometry configuration of a monostatic two-
dimension ISAR imaging system is shown in Fig. 1. 
According to the electromagnetic scattering theory, when 
radar works in the high frequency domain, the total echo 
received from the target can be modeled as the sum of 
echoes from different isolate scattering points within the 
target.

As for the low speed targets like airplanes, the moving 
distance along range direction within the pulse duration time 
does not exceed one range cell (
2
m
p
c
v T
 B
). Hence, the 
velocity item 
vm /
c  can be neglected. Consequently, (4) is 
simplified to single-frequency signal, which means that 
implementing Fourier transform along range direction can  
 
Figure 1.  Geometry of imaging system 
achieve the high range resolution. Nonetheless, as for the 
high speed targets like satellites, their velocities no longer 
meet the above condition, sometimes even 
2
m
p
c
v T
 B
 will 
occur. In such cases, the velocity term 
vm /
c  cannot be 
ignored anymore. 
According to (4) - (7), due to the velocity 
m
v , the echo of 
the high speed target after dechirp process is a multi-
component LFM signal. However, since 
Rim0
 changes with 
different scattering point, the carrier 
if  of multi-component 
LFM signal also varies consequently. Furthermore, since the 
pulse duration time is very short (a fraction of a millisecond), 
m
v  can be regarded as invariant within the pulse duration 
time. Therefore, the chirp rate K in (4) and (7) can also be 
considered constant. In view of the wide bandwidth of the 
LFM signal, the direct Fourier transform makes the 
spectrums of multiple LFM signals overlap, which is so-
called range distortion. Consequently, the range resolution 
will be degraded and the ISAR image will be defocused. For 
high resolution range profile, multi-component LFM signals 
should be changed to multiple single-frequency signals in 
advance. After that, the Fourier transform along cross-range 
can be taken to form the desired high resolution ISAR image. 
III. 
VELOCITY COMPENSATION BASED ON CHIRP FOURIER 
TRANSFORM 
Chirp Fourier transform is an effective method to 
eliminate the quadratic phase term caused by the high speed 
motion. This section will introduce the definition of chirp 
Fourier transform and the velocity compensation method 
based on it. 
A. Chirp Fourier transform 
Chirp Fourier transform is a kind of parameter estimation 
method in signal processing field. Chirp Fourier transform of 
signal s(t) is as follows:

after accumulation will be much lower. Therefore, after chirp 
Fourier transform, a peak in the amplitude map will be 
formed at 

1

, which are the parameters to be estimated. 
B. Velocity compensation based on chirp Fourier transform 
As discussed in (4), the received echo from the high 
speed target is a multi-component binomial signal. The 
spectrum will be shifted as an entirety, although the carrier 
frequency 
if  varies within the slow-time domain. Range 
alignment and phase correction can eliminate the effect. It is 
known that the primary reason for range distortion is the 
quadratic phase term of the echo. As a result, compensation 
for the quadratic phase term can avoid range distortion 
effectively. The quadratic phase term for velocity 
compensation is constructed as follows:

As the quadratic phase term is compensated by chirp 
Fourier transform over the entire range of the digital chirp 
rate k, many range profiles are obtained. The entropy of each  
range profile is then calculated, and the specified range 
profile with the smallest entropy is considered as the optimal 
one. The exact definition of entropy can be written as (15). 
Through the above process, the high resolution range profile 
with the optimal velocity compensation is obtained. The 
concrete flowchart of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 2.  
After chirp Fourier transform, the cross-range Fourier 
transform and the Keystone transform are combined to form 
the ISAR image of the target. The image entropy and the 
image contrast are introduced to evaluate the quality of the 
ISAR image. Larger contrast and smaller entropy indicate 
that an ISAR image has better quality. Denoting ISAR image

IV. 
EXPERIMENT RESULT 
To demonstrate the compensation performance of the 
quadratic phase term with chirp Fourier transform, a simple 
satellite scattering model with 64 scattering points is 
established, as is shown in Fig. 3. Simulation experiments 
are taken under Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) of 5dB, and the 
parameter configurations for the radar and the target are 
shown in Table I. 
The concrete target scattering point model is presented in 
Fig. 3. Fig. 4 illustrates the range profiles of the 50th pulse 
obtained by the proposed method and Fast Fourier transform 
(FFT), wherein the result of FFT is shown in red dotted line, 
and the result of the proposed method is shown in the blue 
full line. Owing to the wide bandwidth of LFM signal, direct 
Fourier transform without velocity compensation will lead to 
the spectrum overlap between multi-component LFM signals. 
As a result, the range profile distortion will occur, as shown 
 
Figure 4.  Range profile of 50th echo  
 
 
 
 
in red dotted line in Fig. 4. Since chirp Fourier transform can 
convert LFM signal to single-frequency signal, the range 
distortion can be avoided efficiently, as is shown in 
blue full line in Fig. 4. In conclusion, the range profile of the 
proposed method focuses better than that of FFT. 
Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 are the ISAR imaging results 
obtained by RD, FRFT and the proposed algorithm 
respectively. In addition, the image entropy and image 
contrast of these three methods are shown in Table II. The 
image entropy and image contrast of Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 
are (9.7180,5.4974), (9.5759,6.9348), and (9.0735,7.7437) 
respectively.  
Furthermore, as is shown in Fig. 5, the imaging result 
obtained by the RD algorithm is severely defocused and the 
scattering points cannot be resolved from each other. 
Although the ISAR image of the FRFT algorithm shown in 
Fig. 6 is better focused than that of the RD algorithm, there 
are still many scattering points difficult to resolve in the 
target model. Comparing to the above methods, the imaging 
result obtained by the proposed method is better focused, as 
is shown in Fig. 7. According to the energy convergence 
level, the image resolution of the proposed method is higher 
than that of the RD and FRFT algorithms. Therefore, through 
qualitative analysis, the ISAR image obtained by the 
proposed method is much clearer than that of the RD and 
FRFT algorithms. It can also be noticed that the entropy of 
the ISAR image obtained by the proposed method is smaller 
than that of the other two methods, while its contrast is 
greater than the other two methods. The quantitative 
comparison on the image entropy and the image contrast 
demonstrates that the image quality of the proposed method 
is better than that of RD and FRFT algorithms. In summary, 
the ISAR image of the proposed method has a higher level of 
energy convergence.

In conclusion, the simulation experiment results 
demonstrate that the proposed method can compensate the 
quadratic phase terms better than the RD algorithm and the 
FRFT algorithm. Consequently, the proposed method can 
obtain better ISAR imaging results for the high speed targets 
Fig. 8 shows the imaging results of the three methods 
under different SNR levels (0~20dB). According to the 
curves in Fig. 8, the image entropy and the image contrast of 
the proposed method are much smoother than that of the RD 
algorithm and the FRFT algorithm, which means that the 
proposed method is more robust to the SNR level. Especially 
compared with RD and FRFT algorithms, the ISAR image 
obtained by the proposed method has less entropy and 
greater contrast at low SNR level, as is shown in Fig. 8. Thus, 
the proposed method is more suitable to low SNR level 
situation.  
In conclusion, the imaging results presented in this paper 
are superior to the classic RD and FRFT algorithms. 
Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm is more robust to the 
SNR level. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The echo of the high speed target is a multi-component 
LFM signal, therefore, the direct Fourier transform will bring 
about range distortion, which leads to a blurred ISAR image. 
This paper proposes a novel imaging method based on chirp 
Fourier transform and Shannon minimum entropy principle, 
which can eliminate quadratic phase term caused by high 
speed motion and achieve range compression simultaneously. 
The proposed method can simplify the complexity of the 
algorithm, while maintain the quality of the ISAR imaging 
result. Additionally, the proposed method is more robust to 
the SNR level. The simulation experiments show that the 
imaging results obtained by the proposed method are better 
than that of RD and FRFT algorithms.
