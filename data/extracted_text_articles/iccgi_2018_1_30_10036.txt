Abstract—Counterfeit bills are easy to forge due to the 
advances in scanning and printing technologies. Individuals 
are less likely to find counterfeit bills. This paper proposes a 
deep learning-based algorithm to detect counterfeit bills and 
their forgery devices. The proposed algorithm has adopted a 
convolutional 
neural 
network 
model 
composed 
of 
2 
convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. In the 
convolutional layers, rectified linear unit and max-pooling are 
applied. In the fully connected layers, drop out is applied. To 
show the performance of the algorithm, experiments are 
performed using original bills and counterfeit bills forged with 
different manufacturers' printers. Nearly 100% detection 
accuracy has been achieved.  
Keywords-counterfeit bill detection; forgery device detection; 
deep learning; convolutional neural network. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
High performance scanning and printing devices can be 
accessed at low cost with the advances of IT (Information 
Technology). In addition, high quality image processing 
software has been developed. As a result, the general public 
can easily process complex tasks. However, novices can use 
these advanced technologies to create illegal products. 
Credibility of currency is important in an economic 
society. Loss of currency credibility damages not only 
personal property but it also harms national creditworthiness. 
Recently, crimes forging counterfeit bills with high 
performance devices and high quality software are rapidly 
increasing. 
Although various anti-counterfeiting technologies are 
applied to prevent counterfeiting such as magnetic stripe line, 
ultra violet watermark, and hologram pattern, counterfeit bill 
detectors require too high a cost and individuals are less 
likely to find counterfeit bills because too many bills are 
circulating. 
To solve this problem, many counterfeit bill detection 
researches have been performed using tools such as ultra 
violet features, electro-magnetic features, and printing noise 
features. This paper focuses on research that uses printing 
noise features, where human beings have defined the features 
to discriminate between original bills and counterfeit bills. 
Then, these features were applied to the classifier. However, 
human beings have a limitation to define sophisticated 
features to discriminate between original bills and counterfeit 
bills. 
This paper proposes a deep learning-based algorithm to 
detect counterfeit bills and their forgery devices. Since deep 
learning algorithms are not limited to human cognitive 
abilities, differently from human beings, the proposed 
algorithm can extract the sophisticated features by itself and 
hence robustly discriminate between original bills and 
counterfeit bills. The proposed algorithm has adopted a 
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model, which is mainly 
used in image processing fields [1]. The model is composed 
of 2 convolutional layers having Rectified Linear Unit 
(ReLU) as an activation function and max-pooling and 2 
fully connected layers having a drop-out function to prevent 
overfitting. Finally, a SoftMax function is used to rectify the 
results. Using original bills and counterfeit bills that are 
forged with 3 different color laser printers, experiments are 
performed. Nearly 100% accuracy in detecting counterfeit 
bills and their forgery devices has been achieved.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews 
related works. The proposed algorithm is explained in 
Section III. Section IV shows experimental results and 
Section V concludes. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
To detect counterfeit bills, a lot of research is underway 
and its performance depends on how to extract accurately the 
unique characteristics of counterfeit bills that are different 
from 
the 
original 
bills. 
Among 
anti-counterfeiting 
technologies, the features used in previous studied 
algorithms are Ultra Violet (UV) features, electro-magnetic 
features, and printing noise features. 
A. UV Features 
UV features are easier to detect than other features. Chae 
et al. used the fact that UV information was only part of the 
bill [2]. Their algorithm improved accuracy and computation 
speed over conventional UV-based discrimination methods. 
After dividing the UV information extracted from the bill 
into 3x4 blocks, the difference from original bills was 
calculated to detect counterfeit bills. The detection rate of 
counterfeit bills was 100% and the accuracy of original bills 
was 99.3%.  
Lee et al. proposed a speed optimized method to 
automatically detect UV information without using a 
conventional passive UV detection method [3]. The images 
obtained by UV illumination were separated by a Gaussian 
mixture model and Split-and-Merge EM (SMEM) algorithm.

Then, the size and weight of the covariance vector were 
considered to judge whether it was forged or not.  
B. Electrical Features 
Researches using electro-magnetic features of a printing 
material are also progressing steadily. Kang et al. proposed a 
counterfeit bill detection system by contacting a fiber optic 
sensor with a specific part of the bills [4]. In the bill, the area 
representing the amount of the bill was scanned through the 
optical fiber and the voltage measurement was used to make 
judgement. As a result, 100% accuracy was achieved in the 
test with Korean $50 bills. 
C. Printing Noise Features 
The noise features of printing devices can be used to 
detect counterfeit bills, and the algorithm proposed in this 
paper falls into this category. Ji et al. extracted non-local 
feature values and applied a support vector machine 
classifier to discriminate counterfeit bills [5]. Also, they 
identified printing devices to forge them. After extracting the 
noise factors of printing devices using a non-local averaging 
algorithm, feature values were extracted by calculating the 
Gray level co-occurrence matrix. Counterfeit bill detection 
accuracy was about 94% and their forged device detection 
accuracy was about 93%.  
Baek et al. proposed an algorithm using low resolution 
multispectral images, where human readable features such as 
optically variable ink and machine readable features by 
multi-channel IR (Infra Red) hardware sensors are combined 
to discriminate counterfeit bills from original bills [6]. They 
achieved 100% detection accuracy for counterfeit bills with 
99.8% classification accuracy. 
There are other studies to detect printing devices. Lee et 
al. used a Wiener filter to extract the noise feature of printing 
devices, which was useful for removing abnormal noise [7]. 
Since printers converted the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) 
channels of images to the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, 
Black) channels for printing, the scanned image having the 
RGB channels was transformed into the CMYK channels. 
Then, the printing noise was extracted by calculating the 
difference between the image and its Wiener-filtered image 
and was used as the feature.  
Choi et al. and Baek et al. used high-frequency 
components that were extracted by discrete wavelet 
transform as the printing noise feature [8] [9].  
Ryu et al. studied a printing device detection algorithm 
considering that color laser printers had a unique pattern for 
CMYK printing [10]. The directional information of the 
linear characteristics existing in the printing pattern was 
extracted using Hough transform and was used as the feature.  
Against mistreated Mexican bills, not counterfeit bills, 
Garcia-Lamont et al. proposed a classification method, 
where their color and local binary patterns from texture 
features are used [11].  
However, in these algorithms, there are disadvantages 
that human beings must design a method to extract features 
and there are limitations in designing the sophisticated way 
to extract features for distinguishing between original bills 
and counterfeit bills. 
III. PROPOSED CNN-BASED DETECTION ALGORITHM 
In order to detect counterfeit bills and their forgery 
devices, a deep learning-based algorithm based on CNN has 
been proposed, which consists of two steps: training and 
testing. Figure 1 shows the overall process of the algorithm. 
Using training data, the proposed model is trained and the 
accuracy is evaluated by comparing with the label of the 
training data. Then, the weights and biases of the model are 
updated via error back propagation with reference to the 
accuracy. After learning a certain number of times, testing 
data are applied to the model and detection results are 
analyzed to calculate the accuracy. 
Deep learning is a neural network that has deeper layer 
than existing artificial neural networks. According to recent 
studies, the CNN model among various deep learning models 
is suitable for image processing applications and can extract 
sophisticated features to achieve high performance without 
human intervention [1]. 
Therefore, the proposed algorithm to detect counterfeit 
bills and their forgery device is designed using this CNN 
model. In general, the CNN model consists of an input layer, 
a convolutional layer, a fully connected layer, and an output 
layer. 
 
 
Figure 1. Counterfeit bills and their forgery device detection process 
Generally, the convolutional layer includes a convolution 
operation, a pooling operation, and an activation function. 
The convolution operation can extract features considering 
the values of local pixels by a matrix operation of image and 
filter. The pooling operation leaves only pixel values that 
satisfy certain rules among the pixels in a specific area. This 
can reduce the size of the input data and improve the 
processing speed. However, it can lose important pixel

values that can contribute to identify counterfeit bills. When 
linear results are used, normal learning is difficult due to the 
problem of vanishing gradients in the back propagation 
process. Therefore, an activation function is used to 
nonlinearly change the results of the previous layer. 
The fully connected layer is the most basic component of 
an artificial neural network. The data from the previous layer 
are used as input nodes one by one and fully connected to the 
output nodes. Overfitting is a situation in which too much 
data are learned for a particular dataset and hence fails to 
provide adequate results for additional data. To prevent 
overfitting, drop-out is a normalization technique, which 
drops random nodes of fully connected layer nodes during 
the learning process [12]. Differently from our previous 
research, which just focused on differentiating between 
original bills and counterfeit bills [13], the output layer is 
composed of 4 nodes to identify forgery devices and 
parameters are tuned to improve the performance. 
The output values of the fully connected layer can be 
varied in range. To rectify the values, a SoftMax function is 
applied in the output layer.  
The detail of the proposed CNN-based model is depicted 
in Figure 2, which consists of 4 layers: an input layer, a 
convolutional layer, a fully connected layer, and an output 
layer.  
 
 
Figure 2. Details of the proposed CNN-based model 
The input layer and the output layer are matched to an 
input image and discrimination result, respectively. The 
initial values of weights and biases were adjusted. 
The 1st convolutional layer receives 256x256 color 
images having RGB channels and outputs 64 feature maps 
by convolving a 5x5 kernel. ReLU is used as an activation 
function and the 256x256 size of feature maps is reduced to 
the 128x128 size of feature maps through max-pooling with 
stride 2. The 2nd convolutional layer receives 64 feature 
maps as an input and outputs 48 feature maps. The same 
activation function is used as the first layer and max-pooling 
with stride 2 reduces the 128x128 size of feature maps to the 
64x64 size of feature maps. 
256x256 color images having RGB channels become 48 
feature maps having a 64x64 size through 2 convolutional 
layers. Then, these feature maps are rearranged into a one-
dimensional array with 64x64x48 values.  
Through the 1st fully connected layer, these values are 
output to 1024 nodes, where a drop-out processing of 0.5 rate 
is applied to prevent overfitting. Also, through the 2nd fully 
connected layer, the discrimination result is acquired after 
rectifying the value with the SoftMax function. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
For the experiment, original bills are scanned to make 
original bill images. Then, counterfeit bills are created by 
printing these original bill images and scanned again to get 
the counterfeit bill images. As printers for counterfeiting, we 
used Konica C250, Canon iRc3200N, and Canon iRC2620 
color laser printers. 
Due to the memory limitation of deep learning hardware, 
it is impossible to use the scanned bill images directly. 
Therefore, scanned bill images are randomly cropped with 
100 images of 256x256 size. Since the data ratio of the 
original bill images and the counterfeit bill images is 1:3, up-
sampling is performed to 300 original bill images. 
The entire data consists of 10,800 (36x300) original bills 
and 10,800 (36x100x3 printers) counterfeit bills. The ratio of 
the training data to the testing data is 8:2, i.e., 8,640 and 
2,160, respectively. Figure 3 shows original bill images and 
counterfeit bill images generated by each printing device.

Detection Accuracy 
The detection accuracy of original bills, counterfeit bills 
and their forgery device is analyzed to show the performance 
of the proposed algorithm. The results are depicted in Figure 
4 and summarized in Table I. In Figure 4, a horizontal axis 
represents the number of epochs and a vertical axis indicates 
the detection accuracy. In Table I, the last column (All) is the 
average of detection accuracy for 3 printers.  
As shown in the results, the detection accuracy increases 
with the increase of epochs. After 25 epochs, the detection 
rate of original bills and counterfeit bills is 100%. Also, the 
detection of their forgery device is 100%. It means that the 
proposed algorithm using CNN-based deep learning can

V. CONCLUSION 
As scanning and printing devices are improved and costs 
are reduced, counterfeit bills are made easier than ever. As a 
result, counterfeit bills have been circulated in various ways, 
and anti-counterfeiting technologies have been studied to 
prevent counterfeiting crimes. 
In this paper, we proposed a CNN-based deep learning 
algorithm that could detect counterfeit bills and their forgery 
devices. Also, we performed intensive experiments to show 
the outstanding performance. The proposed algorithm could 
achieve 100% accuracy in discriminating between original 
bills and counterfeit bills. Also, it could identify their forgery 
devices with 100% accuracy.  
In the experiments, contaminated bills commonly found 
in practice are not considered. Therefore, it is necessary to 
perform additional studies for commonly used damaged and 
contaminated bills. Also, we consider increasing the depth of 
the model or including pre-processing filters. Therefore, 
there are many opportunities to research.
