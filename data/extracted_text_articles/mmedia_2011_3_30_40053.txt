Abstract—Indexing and retrieving are two important tasks for 
color image databases. These tasks are possible when using the 
histogram as an efficient technique for content-based image 
retrieval domain. In this paper, a content-based image 
retrieval system that can be used in the medical domain is 
presented. The system is using an original combination of two 
types of histograms: a spatial color histogram and a texture 
histogram based on the Local Binary Pattern descriptor. Both 
histograms are computed in the HVC color space. The 
computation of the binary code associated to a Local Binary 
Pattern descriptor is made in an original manner using the 
NBS distance instead of using a simple difference between 
colors’ components. 
Keywords- spatial color histogram; annular color histogram; 
content based image retrieval. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Color histograms have two main advantages: easy 
computation and a broad applicability for a wide range of 
images. The main drawback is that histograms capture only 
global color distributions of the images and there is a lack of 
information about the spatial relationship among image’s 
colors. It is highly possible that two images with similar 
color histograms to have a very different spatial appearance 
causing false positives. Because the content of images is 
indexed in a limited way using only color histograms it was 
decided that it would be an advantage to take into account 
the spatial information [10]. This combination has led to 
effective techniques for content-based image retrieval tasks 
based on the new spatial color histogram. It was used for our 
system an efficient spatial color histogram called the annular 
histogram [10] which is based on a density map. The 
experimental results have proven that this histogram 
outperforms the traditional color histogram and the color 
coherent vector [11].  
Because color measurements are sensitive to varying 
illumination conditions texture measures can be used in 
many real-world applications, including for example, 
outdoor scene image analysis. Texture characteristics gives 
additional information compared to color or shape 
measurements of the objects. It is considered to be important 
in many image analysis and computer vision tasks. We have 
used the local binary pattern (LBP) [13] to obtain a texture 
histogram of patterns. LBP is one of the most used texture 
descriptors in medical image analysis and it has recently 
proven useful in describing medical images [17][18][19]. It 
has a low computational complexity and a low sensitivity to 
changes in illumination.  
This descriptor is used for texture classification [13][21], 
face recognition [20][22][24], fingerprint identification [23], 
etc.     
The HVC (Hue-Value-Chroma) color space [5] has been 
used because it represents colors along human perceptual 
dimensions [6]. HVC is a representation of the IE 1976 
(L*a*b*) under the cylinder coordinate system. The 
components of a color in the HVC space are defined as:  
𝐻 = arctan  
𝑏∗
𝑎∗  , 𝑉 = 𝐿∗ ,  𝐶 =  𝑎∗2 + 𝑏∗2  .  
(1) 
The distance between two pixels in this space is 
computed using the NBS distance [4]. Colors with the NBS 
color distance below 3.0 are perceived to be almost the same 
color by human beings. Given a pair of colors A = (H1; V1; 
C1) and B = (H2; V2; C2), the NBS color distance is defined 
as follows [4]: 
𝐸𝑁𝐵𝑆 𝐴, 𝐵 =  1,2 ∗  2𝐶1𝐶2  1 − cos 
2𝜋
100 ∆𝐻  +  ∆𝐶 2 +  4∆𝑉 2  .  (2) 
where:  
∆𝐻 =  𝐻1 − 𝐻2 , ∆𝑉 =  𝑉1 − 𝑉2 , ∆𝐶 =  𝐶1 − 𝐶2 .    
(3) 
The correspondence between the human color perception 
and the NBS color distance is shown in the following table:

RELATED WORK 
Many research efforts have been made in the last decades 
to overcome the problems associated with color histograms. 
For content-based image retrieval systems it is more 
important the result of an approximate matching of two 
histograms than exact matching of images. Approximate 
matching is more useful since the interest is to retrieve 
similar images, rather than images identical with the sample 
image. 
The solution proposed by Stricker and Dimai [2] divided 
an image into five fixed overlapping blocks. From each 
block the first three color moments were extracted and these 
were used to form a features vector of the image. Huang, et 
al. [3] proposed the correlogram to take into account the 
local color spatial correlation as well as the global 
distribution of this spatial correlation.  In [10][12], the spatial 
color histograms are described for the content based image 
retrieval task. 
A typical example of histogram-based image retrieval 
system is the FINDIT system developed by M.J. Swain and 
his colleagues [1]. The HVC color space was adopted for this 
system and for each image it was created a two-dimensional 
H-C histogram. It was used the histogram intersection to 
measure the similarity between a pair of images. In [4], a 
histogram-based image retrieval method was implemented. 
This method is similar to the one used in FINDIT system. 
The H and C-axes of the HVC color space were used, and 
the two axes were equally subdivided into 8 intervals, 
resulting in histograms of 64 bins.  
Another example of a texture-based image retrieval system 
is the UCSB system developed by Manjunath et al. [16]. The 
system adopted the Gabor wavelet model to compute feature 
vectors of texture patterns and used the weighted L1 distance 
between a pair of feature vectors to measure the image 
similarity.  
Ojala et al. [13] proposed an effective local binary pattern 
(LBP) method for texture analysis. They have developed 
powerful extensions to their approach including rotation 
invariance and multi resolution analysis [14]. The approach 
is theoretically very simple and binds together the properties 
of statistical and structural texture analysis. LBP and its 
extensions have performed very well in various comparative 
studies and have been applied successfully in several real-
world texture analysis problems [15]. In [25], the HVC color 
space is used for pixels classification. The described method 
is based on statistical characteristics and it is used for the 
recognition of the airline coupons. In [27], the LBP are used 
to describe images of brain magnetic resonance (MR) 
volumes. When a query image is given the system retrieves 
relevant slices. LBP are used in [28] for representing salient 
micro-patterns in mammographic mass detection and to train 
a support vector machine (SVM) with the aim of 
distinguishing between the true recognized masses and the 
ones which actually are normal parenchyma.  
In [30], an indexing and retrieval scheme is presented that 
uses the spatial color distribution. The indexing technique is 
based on the Gaussian Mixture modeling of the histogram of 
weights provided by the bilateral filtering scheme. In this 
way the proposed technique considers not only the global 
distribution of the color pixels comprising the image but also 
takes into account their spatial arrangement. In [8], the 
spatial histograms are used for region based tracking. In this 
context, these histograms are named spatiograms, which are 
histograms augmented with spatial means and covariances 
to capture a richer description of the target. In [9], it is used 
a medical image retrieval system that is very similar with our 
approach. This system is based on multiple features: color 
features - exploited by cumulative histograms, texture 
features - extracted by using gray level co-occurrence matrix 
(GLCM) and shape features - represented by a histogram of 
edge’s directions. This system extract the primitive feature of 
a query image and then compares it with existing features of 
the images from the database using a similarity measure. 
This similarity measure is evaluated using Euclidean 
distance. The experiments are made on a set containing 1000 
images, covering MRI images, X-Ray images, Patology 
images. Retrieval Accuracy and Precision are used as 
performance measures. For evaluating the retrieval operation 
this system is using four retrieval modes: a retrieval mode 
based on a color histogram, a retrieval mode based on 
GLCM, a retrieval mode based on shape and a retrieval 
mode based on a combination of a color histogram and 
GLCM. The experimental results have shown the following 
results for the four retrieval modes (in the same order as 
before): (% Recall Accuracy : 66.1 ; % Precision: 55.3),  (% 
Recall Accuracy : 68.4 ; % Precision: 62.6), (% Recall 
Accuracy : 65.12 ; % Precision: 58.3), (% Recall Accuracy : 
72.3 ; % Precision: 65.4). It can be seen that using a 
combination of color and texture it was obtained the best 
retrieval result.

SPATIAL COLOR HISTOGRAM AND LOCAL BINARY 
PATTERN 
A spatial color histogram is based on two main concepts: 
the distribution density and the density map. The distribution 
density can have three types: annular, angular and hybrid. 
The density map is obtained after performing the following 
algorithm:  
 
Calculate the centroid and the radius of each subset 
of pixels having the same color - considered as a 
geometric subset of the 2-D plan. 
 
Partition the enveloping disk either in annular, 
angular or sector (combination of annular and 
angular) regions. 
 
Count the number of pixels in each region and form 
a vector called the density map of a color.  
 
Arrange the density maps of all colors in a matrix 
where the density map of a color represents a matrix 
row; the matrix obtained is called either annular, 
69

angular or hybrid depending on which partition was 
adopted.  
Figure 1 presents an example of annular distribution 
density vector (4, 11, 9, 5) computed by counting the number 
of points (starting with the center region) in each region: 
 
Figure  1. Annular distribution density. 
In [10], five techniques for computing color histograms in 
the HVC color space were evaluated: the traditional 
histogram, color coherent vector (CCV) [11], the three types 
of histograms mentioned above: annular, angular, and 
hybrid. Features vectors were generated for each of the 
histograms mentioned above having the dimension equal to 
2048. The color space was then quantized by making a 
uniform partition in each color dimension. Histogram types 
and the parameters used for quantification are listed in 
Figure 2. The experimental results have shown the following 
performance (in this order): annular, angular, hybrid, color 
coherent vector, and traditional histogram. The improvement 
of the spatial color histograms over the traditional one are: 
36.49 % (annular), 30.41 % (angular), 26.71 % (hybrid). The 
improvement of the spatial color histograms over CCV are: 
22.39 % (annular), 16.93 % (angular) and 13.61 % (hybrid).

where r, θ are polar coordinates. 
LBP is one of the most used texture descriptors in medical 
image analysis being very useful in describing medical 
images. In Figure 3 it is shown how to calculate the LBP and 
the contrast for a pixel having 8 neighbor pixels. 
 
Figure 3. Computation of LBP and local contrast features. 
A binary code is produced for each pixel in an image, by 
thresholding its neighborhood (8 pixels) with the value of the 
center pixel. The average of the gray levels below the value 
of the center pixel is subtracted from that of the gray levels 
above (or equal to) the center pixel. A histogram is 
constructed to collect up the occurrences of different binary 
patterns representing different types of curved edges, spots, 
flat areas, etc. 
The original 8-bit version of the LBP operator considers 
only the eight nearest neighbors of each pixel. For this 
version there are 256 local patterns, 36 of them being 
rotation invariant.  
The definition of the LBP has been extended to arbitrary 
circular neighborhoods of the pixel to achieve multi-scale 
analysis and rotation invariance. In Figure 4 it is presented 
the circularity idea behind the multi resolution approach.  
The circular neighborhood definition allows obtaining a 
rotation invariant descriptor, but in some problems the 
anisotropic 
structural 
information 
is 
an 
important 
information source. To exploit this anisotropic structural 
information, an elliptical neighborhood definition has been 
used [28] for a face recognition system. This variant to the 
standard LBP has been named elliptical binary pattern 
(EBP). 
 
Figure  4. Circular neighborhood of pixel in multi resolution LBP. 
Another variant has been proposed by [29] to solve the 
problem of the sensitivity to noise in near-uniform image 
regions. This method, called local ternary patterns (LTP), 
proposed a 3-valued coding that includes a threshold around 
zero for the evaluation of the local gray-scale difference. 
The distance between two LBP histograms (histograms 
of patterns) can be evaluated using:  
Chi square distance:  
 𝜒2 𝑆, 𝑀 =  
(𝑆𝑏−𝑀𝑏)2
𝑆𝑏+𝑀𝑏

𝑏=1
.

Histograms intersection: 
𝐻 𝑆, 𝑀 =  
min 𝑆𝑏, 𝑀𝑏 .

𝑏=1

with a significantly smaller computational overhead. 
Another extension to the original operator is the 
definition of so called uniform patterns. This extension was 
inspired by the fact that some binary patterns occur more 
commonly in texture images than others. A local binary 
pattern is called uniform if the binary pattern contains at 
most two bitwise transitions from 0 to 1 or vice versa when 
the bit pattern is traversed circularly. For example, the 
patterns 00000000 (0 transitions), 01110000 (2 transitions)

and 11001111 (2 transitions) are uniform whereas the 
patterns 11001001 (4 transitions) and 01010010 (6 
transitions) are not. For (8, R) neighborhood there are 58 
uniform patters from the total of 256 patterns. 
IV. 
THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
The system architecture is presented in Figure 5 and 
contains four main modules:  
 
Annular histogram Module: is used to compute the 
annular histogram and the distribution density 
vector. As described above for this type of 
histogram the HSV space dimensions were split: H- 
8 bins, V- 4 bins and C - 4 bins obtaining in this 
way a histogram of 8x4x4 = 128 bins.   In the first 
step this module computes the histogram using the 
information extracted from the specified image. 
After this process completes for each histogram bin, 
it is computed the distribution density vector having 
a dimension of 16. These vectors are concatenated 
obtaining a single density vector having a 
dimension of 128×16 = 2048 that is stored in the 
database.   
 
Figure  5. System architecture. 
 
LBP histogram Module – this module computes a 
histogram of rotational invariant local binary 
patterns. For our system we have used a histogram 
of patterns having 37 bins (36 bins for the rotation 
invariants and one bin for the rest of the patterns) 
and an original method for computing the pattern 
code: the NBS distance is calculated between the 
color components of the center pixel and the color 
components of a neighbor pixel; if the distance is 
greater that 3 (remarkably different colors) then we 
have 1, otherwise we have 0. In this way it is 
obtained the binary representation of the pattern and 
later the number associated with the pattern using a 
transformation from base 2 in base 10. The 
histogram of patterns is normalized and after that its 
content is stored in the database. 
 
 Content based image retrieval Module: this module 
computes a distance D having two components :  
o D1 – the Euclidian distance between the density 
vector of the analyzed image and a density vector 
corresponding to an image already processed 
o D2 - a distance equal with 1 – HI, where HI is the 
histogram intersection between the histogram of 
patterns of the analyzed image and the histogram 
of patterns corresponding to an image already 
processed. The value of D is obtained as: 
𝐷 =  𝐷1
2 + 𝐷2
2   (6)   where  𝐷2 = 1 − 𝐻𝐼  
(6) 
 
Graphical User Interface Module: is used by the user 
to retrieve the images that are similar with the 
specified input image, to specify a repository path, to 
retrieve the images from the database that have a 
diagnostic similar with the specified one – the 
diagnostic is specified as a text and after pressing a 
button a select statement is made on the database in 
tables Images and Diagnostics and all images having 
that diagnostic are returned; this option can be used 
to detect the total number of relevant images from 
the database when knowing the diagnostic of an 
input image.  
For each input image it is returned a list of similar images 
having the value of the distance D smaller than a threshold 
value which is configurable. 
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The system has been tested using a set of 2000 images 
belonging to the digestive tract and they were obtained 
during the patients’ diagnosis process. The training set 
contained 1800 images and the testing set 200 images. Each 
image from the training set has in the database information 
about the associated diagnostic. This information is used to 
detect the number of relevant images from the database 
having the same diagnostic. The performance and the 
efficiency of the information retrieval operation are 
measured with two parameters: recall and precision. The 
recall parameter measures the ability of the system to find 
relevant information in the database and it is defined as: the 
number of retrieved images that are also relevant / the total 
number of relevant images from the database. The precision 
parameter measures the accuracy of the retrieval operation 
and it is defined as: the number of retrieved images that are 
also relevant / the total number of retrieved images. For each 
image from the testing set it is calculated a (precision, recall) 
pair of values. The precision is computed easily by 
identifying the relevant images from the returned list and 
computing the value as described above. For recall we need 
also to detect the total number of relevant images existing in 
the database. This number is calculated by making the 
following assumption: the diagnostic associated with the 
input image is known. As the diagnostic is known, the option 
“querying the database by diagnostic” can be used. This 
option is in the Graphical User Interface module. In this way 
it is obtained the list of all images having the specified 
diagnostic. After this value is obtained the precision value is 
computed. At the end of this process 200 pairs (precision,

recall) of values were obtained and used to calculate a mean 
precision and a mean recall. Similar with the approach 
described in [9] we have made an evaluation of three 
retrieval modes: one retrieval mode based on an annular 
histogram, one retrieval mode based on a LBP histogram and 
a retrieval mode based on a combination between an annular 
histogram and an LBP histogram. Using the approach 
described above we have obtained 3 pairs of mean values for 
precision and recall corresponding to the three retrieval 
modes (in the same order as above): (% Recall: 61.3; % 
Precision: 54.7),  (% Recall : 64.5 ; % Precision: 59.6),  (% 
Recall  : 76.1 ; % Precision: 70.1). It can be seen that using a 
combination of an annular histogram and a LBP histogram it 
was obtained the best retrieval result. 
Below, the results obtained using the following query 
image having the ulcer diagnostic are presented.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a system for content based image retrieval 
that can be used in the medical domain was described.  
An element of originality of this system is the usage of 
the combination of two histograms: annular histogram and 
LBP histogram for content based image retrieval.  
The binary code associated to each LBP descriptor is 
computed using an original method based on NBS distance. 
This method is much better than computing simple 
difference between colors' components. 
The limitations of the color histogram were improved by 
taking into account the spatial relationship between pixels.  
The system was tested only on a limited dataset 
containing 2000 medical images, but in the future a larger 
dataset will be used and more experiments will be made. The 
experiments refer both for retrieval quality and speed.   
Further extensions of the system will include shape 
information and the extraction of other texture-related 
features (Gabor and Tamura based). It should be also made 
comparative performance studies between this system and 
other existing systems (like the system described in [9]) and 
to include relevance feedback which is commonly used in 
image retrieval.
