Abstract—We propose and experimentally demonstrate a 
hybrid fiber optic sensor (FOS) using fiber Bragg gratings 
(FBGs) and intensity based FOS for measuring the temperature 
and the strain simultaneously. Experimental results showed the 
simultaneous measurement performance of the strain and the 
temperature for the proposed FOS, which are in good 
agreement with those measured using commercial sensors. The 
proposed hybrid FOS has the advantages of low cost, simple 
structure, and remote multipoint sensing characteristics. 
Keywords- Hybrid FOS; simultaneous measurement; intensity 
based FOS; strain free FBGs

INTRODUCTION
Techniques for simultaneously measuring the strain and 
the temperature using fiber optic sensor (FOS) have been 
developed and considerable interested in the concomitant use 
of different forms [1]. Various discrimination methods to 
measure the strain and the temperature separately using fiber 
Bragg grating (FBG) have been reported [2]. FOSs for 
measuring the strain and the temperature simultaneously can 
be classified into hybrid FOS and integrated FOS. The hybrid 
FOSs are the combined FBG and long period grating (LPG) 
method [3] and the FBG/Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity method [4]. 
The integrated FOSs are the combination of three sensors 
which consists of a polarimetric sensor, photonic crystal fiber, 
and FBG [5] and the combination of Mach-Zehnder 
interferometers and temperature insensitive photonic crystal 
fiber [6].  
Recently, we had reported an intensity based FOS, which 
consists of general FBGs and intensity based FOS head for 
measuring the only strain [7]. In this paper, we propose and 
experimentally demonstrate a hybrid FOS using strain free 
FBGs instead of the general FBGs for measuring the strain 
and the temperature simultaneously, based on our previous 
work [7].  
II.
THE PROPOSED HYBRID FOS STRUCTURE
The proposed hybrid FOS for measuring the strain and the 
temperature simultaneously is shown in Figure 1, which 
consists of strain free FBGs and an intensity based FOS. The 
light from broadband light source (BLS) enters through hybrid 
FOS via ports ① and ② of an optical circulator (OC). The 
reflected spectra by strain free FBGs return to PD via an OC 
and a tunable F-P filter. The tunable F-P filter transmission 
spectrum is changed by the applied sawtooth wave. The 
overlapping power of 𝐼𝐹𝐵𝐺(𝜆)  and 𝐼𝐹𝑃(𝜆) , 𝑃(𝜆) , can be
expressed as follows:  
𝑃(𝜆) = ∫
𝐼𝐹𝐵𝐺(𝜆) × 𝐼𝐹𝑃(𝜆 + 𝜆′) 𝑑𝜆′
+∞
−∞
(1) 
where 𝐼𝐹𝐵𝐺(𝜆) is the FBG reflection spectrum and 𝐼𝐹𝑃(𝜆) is
the F-P filter transmission spectrum. To measure the 
temperature using FBG Bragg wavelength shift, we propose 
an adequate signal processing algorithm, which is shown in 
LabVIEW program of figure 1. The separated signals are 
detected as sharp peaks corresponding to FBGs Bragg 
wavelengths. They determine the corresponding tunable F-P 
filter driving voltages, which use to determine the Bragg 
wavelengths.  
To measure the strain using the intensity based FOS, we 
used our previous FOS structure [7]. When the optical power 
of reflection spectrum from FBG1 and FBG2 are 𝑃1(𝜆) and
𝑃2(𝜆), respectively, the measurement parameter 𝑋  can be
expressed as follows [7]:  
where 𝐻 is the transfer function and 𝛽 is the calibration factor. 
The calibration factor, 𝛽, is determined when an intensity 
based FOS head has no loss. The transfer function, 𝐻, in (2) 
can be obtained from 𝛽 and 𝑋. When the strain is applied to 
intensity based FOS head, the optical fiber bending loss 
corresponding to the applied strain occurs. The occurred 
optical power loss makes to change 𝑋 and 𝐻. The applied 
strain can be obtained by using the 𝐻. Based on the above 
FBG Bragg wavelength detection algorithm and the intensity 
𝑋 = ∫ 𝑃2(𝜆) 𝑑𝜆
∫ 𝑃1(𝜆) 𝑑𝜆 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝐻2

based FOS operating principle, the proposed hybrid FOS 
structure could have the ability of measuring the temperature 
and the strain simultaneously.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
To show the performance of the proposed hybrid FOS, we 
implemented a proposed hybrid FOS in Figure 1 using an 
intensity based FOS and two strain free FBGs. Two strain 
FBGs, FBG1 and FBG2, have a full width at half maximum 
(FWHM) of 0.1 nm, a gauge factor of 9.7 pm/℃, and Bragg 
wavelengths of 1553.1 nm and 1553.8 nm, respectively. 
Firstly, 
to 
show 
the 
temperature 
measurement 
performance for the proposed FOS, we measured the 
temperature with the signal processing unit in Figure 1 and 
compared with the commercial FOS (I-MON 512E, Ibsen 
Photonics). Figure 2 shows the measured wavelength 
according to the temperature with the proposed FOS and the 
commercial FOS. As shown in Figure 2, the measured results 
of the proposed FOS have a good agreement with those of the 
commercial FOS. The FBG1 and  FBG2 average errors for the 
proposed FOS from the reference curve based on the 
specification of strain free FBGs were 0.013 nm and 0.011 nm 
comparing with the commercial FOS errors 0.032 nm and 
0.001 nm, which showed the same error range.  
Secondly, to show the strain measurement performance 
for the proposed FOS, we measured the strain with the 
intensity based FOS in Figure 1 using a universal testing 
machine (5982 INSTRON). Figure 3 shows the measured 
strain by using the intensity based FOS comparing with those 
of the extensometer. The %strain determined by using 𝐻2 has 
a good agreement with the measured %strain using an 
extensometer. To get the relationship between the two 
measured results, linear curve fitting was used, which showed 
the RMSE value of 0.002 and R-square value of 0.9956. The 
average difference of between %strain of the extensometer 
and one of the intensity based FOS were 0.003 %strain and 
standard deviation were 0.002 %strain. Also, we measured the 
𝐻2 in Figure 1 according to the varying temperature from -10 
to 50 ℃ with step of 10 ℃ five times to confirm the 
temperature influence of the intensity based FOS. The 
standard deviations of the measured temperature at each 
temperature are less than 0.789E-04, which means little 
temperature influence of the proposed intensity based FOS. 
From the above experimental results in Figures 2 and 3, 
we may consider that the proposed hybrid FOS has the ability 
measuring the strain and the temperature simultaneously.

CONCLUSIONS 
We have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a 
hybrid FOS structure using the intensity based FOS and the 
strain free FBGs. To demonstrate performance, we measured 
the temperature and the strain, which are compared with the 
commercial sensors. The average errors for the measured 
temperature and strain showed acceptable range of errors 
comparing with those of the commercial sensors. Also, we 
confirmed that the proposed intensity based FOS has little 
temperature influence. Further work under development is 
focusing on applying our proposed hybrid FOS with the 
measuring the strain and the temperature simultaneously for 
structure health monitoring.
