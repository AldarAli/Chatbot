Abstract – We report on a novel optical biosensor design for 
near-field sensing based on a fiber-coupled microcavity. The 
device operates on the bases of sensing in the evanescent near-
field zone via the amplitude and phase modulation of the 
reflected interference patterns. The integrated probe design 
offers a low-cost, robust and easy-to-fabricate alternative for 
label-free real-time biosensing. The first generation, pre-
optimization device has already demonstrated sensitivity in the 
range of 10-4 and 10-5 refractive index units and 40 nm per 
refractive index unit. We have also demonstrated the potential 
use of this device in specific binding assays or concentration 
analyses by monitoring in real-time the solution-phase self-
assembly of 5 Å aminosilane monolayer from varying bulk 
concentration. The application of this device as a new platform 
for point-of-care calibration-free concentration analysis is 
promising.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Despite the prospects that optical biosensors could make 
sensitive and accurate point-of-care diagnostics a reality, 
bringing the technologies out of the lab setting (optical 
table) and into scalable devices for field use remains a 
tremendous challenge to many existing state-of-the-art 
optical biosensor platforms. We previously contributed a 
work-in-progress report on a novel label-free optical 
biosensor with a probe structure that is low-cost, robust, 
easy-to-fabricate, and has the potential for in-vivo or in-situ 
sensing and probing of bio-environments in the field 
settings [1] [2]. 
Electromagnetic waves interact with biological matter in 
various ways ranging from transmission, reflection, 
absorption, scattering and tunneling [3]. Utilizing different 
modes of light interactions with biological matter, a wide 
variety of optical biosensor platforms have been developed 
that probe the bio-environment via its localized refractive 
indices without the need for fluorescent markers or dyes. 
Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) sensors 
rely on the plasmonic enhancement of light absorption and 
scattering to detect minute differences in the morphology of 
the sensing surface [4]. The modulation of wave 
characteristics of light upon reflections at interfaces allow 
interferometric biosensors to monitor the refractive index of 
the samples [5]. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sensors, 
one of the sensing platforms that have seen the most 
commercial success, rely on the absence of reflection during 
the phenomenon of light coupling into a surface mode at a 
specific incident angle [6]. State-of-the-art SPR sensor 
modules have been able to resolve refractive index in the 
orders of 10-7 to 10-9 refractive index unit (RIU). Garnering 
increasing research interests recently, the Whispering 
Gallery Mode (WGM) sensors are able to detect a single 
molecule or nanoparticle by coupling light into optical 
microcavity resonators [7][8]. These optical biosensor 
platforms are label-free, allowing for a more elegant 
detection protocol. Many of them are also capable of real-
time sensing, an ability crucial to cellular studies and drug 
discoveries [9][10]. 
Though many breakthroughs have been made in regard 
to detection sensitivity, translating these from the laboratory 
into a portable and robust micro-device has yet seen 
significant success [2]. Existing high sensitivity biosensor 
platforms often required precise controls of moving parts on 
the nano-scale. Furthermore, the extensive and involved 
micro and nanofabrication required during the fabrication 
processes of some of these platforms make them much too 
expensive for most practical uses. Fiber-optic based 
platforms with sub-micron sized dimensions prove to be one 
of the more promising technologies in regard to the 
practicality of the device due to their needle-like geometries 
[11]. Despite the functional advantages and published 
sensitivities around 10-4 to 10-7 RIU, optical fiber based 
platforms still remain several orders of magnitude less 
sensitive than other bio-sensing technologies such as 
Surface Plasmon Resonance sensors, Whispering Gallery 
Mode sensors, and interferometric sensors [12].   However, 
novel fiber-based platforms could increase the capacity for 
sensitivity and serve as a more robust and low-cost 
biosensor solution. A portable and highly sensitive in-vivo 
device could have immense impact in driving down the cost

of healthcare and guiding vaccine and medicinal distribution 
networks [13].  
In this work, we present a novel optical biosensor with a 
probe structure that has the potential for in-vivo or in-situ 
sensing and probing of bio-environments in real-time. This 
simple, portable, micro-scale device can detect, via phase-
shift and amplitude change of the device response, minute 
changes 
in 
its 
microcavity’s 
immediate 
vicinity 
(evanescence near-field zone).  It could be used in 
diagnostics by detecting the presence of bio-targets such as 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and many disease biomarkers. 
In addition, it could be a possible low-cost tool to aid in the 
understanding of specificity and affinity of specific binding 
pairs by extracting kinetic information from real-time 
analysis. The ability to derive kinetic data from real-time 
measurements also opens the possibility of using this device 
as an alternative low-cost platform for calibration-free 
concentration analysis (CFCA) in point-of-care diagnostics 
[14][15]. The device integrates several characteristic 
features of existing more complex platforms such as 
multiple non-normal reflections and optical coupling from 
waveguide to microcavities into a single probe structure. 
The micro-probe consists of a micro-cavity formed at, and 
optically coupled to the tip of an optical fiber, resulting in a 
compact, easy-to-fabricate, and bio-compatible design for 
refractive index sensing. Experiments for the first 
generation device, with non-optimized probe geometries, 
have yielded a limit of detection of 10-4 to 10-5 RIU with the 
phase shift of 40 nm/RIU. 
This article will first describe the fabrication and 
structure of the fiber-coupled micro-cavity probe. Then, 
propose the working principles of the device and present the 
experimental validations of the proposed principles. Finally, 
the article will demonstrate experimentally the capability of 
the device in bulk refractive index sensing and real-time 
monitoring 
of 
biomolecular 
interactions 
within 
the 
evanescence near-field zone.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The micro-probe is made by tapering hollow borosillicate 
tubes (1mm OD, .75 mm ID) down to tip diameters of 25-50 
μm. The tapering was achieved using a Sutter Instrument P-
2000 Micropipette Puller. A 20W Class IV CO2 laser was 
used as the heating source while the borosilicate tube was 
pulled from both sides, as shown in Fig. 1. Custom programs 
were written for the pipette puller to achieve long and 
gradual tapers. The tapered tips were then melted with a 
gentle flame from standard butane lighter, whereupon the 
molten glass forms a solid glass spherical tip due to its 
surface tension. The symmetry of the spherical tips was 
maintained by constant spinning of the tips during the 
melting process. The total resulting structure consists of a 
finely tapered air cavity that extends into a solid glass 
spherical tip, as seen in Fig. 2. Then, standard SMF-28 
telecom fibers were stripped, cleaved and inserted into this 
tapered cavity, eventually becoming wedged. The optical 
fiber remains stationary due to the cylindrical geometry of 
the tapered air cavity and fiber, and can be affixed upon its 
insertion point with simple epoxy. The range of spherical tip 
diameters tested so far were, but not limited to, 300-500 
microns.

WORKING PRINCIPLES 
This section describes the working principles pf the 
fiber-coupled microcavity probe as a self-reference 
interferometer. Fizeau interferometry physics of the device 
is elaborated, followed by the discussion of its use as a 
sensor. Lastly, the experimental validations of the proposed 
working principles are presented. 
A.  Fizeau  Interferometry 
The resulting spherical probe structure contains two 
effective reflection surfaces for incident light through the 
optical fiber [16]. The first interface is between the end of 
the cleaved fiber and the air cavity, and the second interface 
is between the edge of the solid glass spherical tip and the 
outside environment, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, when 
incoming light through the fiber enters the device, the 
reflection from the second interface recombines with the 
reflection from the first interface as described by the 
reflection from an effective Fabry-Perot cavity. 
The second interface is an effective one that is subjected 
to change by the material in the evanescence zone of the 
probe tip.  The spherical tip forms a secondary (weak Q) 
cavity for the entering light scattered from the sharp air-tip.

Surrounding the outer surface of this microcavity is the 
aforementioned evanescence-zone. A change of material, 
temperature, humidity, or pH, even a minute one, in this 
zone would effectively change the size of this secondary 
cavity, which translates into the amplitude and phase 
modulation of the reflected light that can be measured from 
the overall interference pattern. 
B. Use as a Sensor 
Based on the Fizeau interferometer model, increasing 
the refractive index of the environment outside of the 
spherical tip naturally decreases the reflection coefficient for 
reflections below the critical angle and thus decreases the 
amplitude of the interference signal. However, this is not the 
only effect. Experiments show a clear phase change with 
changing refractive index in the exterior en vironments. 
Due to the unique geometry of the sharply tapered air 
cavity between the two reflection interfaces, this device is 
able to bend the wave fronts of the fiber-outputted light. Fig. 
4 illustrates the simulation of electric field and magnetic 
field intensity within the air cavity and the glass tip, 
showing the bent wave fronts as the electromagnetic wave 
escapes the tapered cavity. This bending of wave fronts 
allows for multiple reflections at multiple non-normal 
angles in the glass spherical tip and probe neck, eventually 
coupling the light back into the optical fiber. This light 
propagates in the spherical tip with a refractive index n1 
through a series of reflections with non-normal incident 
angle θi, where the reflections that meet the total internal 
reflection criteria are greatly affected by the Goos-Hänchen 
effect [17]. Changing the refractive index n2 at the interface 
along the spherical tip will modulate the Goos-Hänchen 
shift, thus, shifting the interference pattern by a phase δ 
described by,

where n = n2/n1. 
Treating the device as an effective Fabry-Perot cavity 
[16], the total reflected intensity could be derived using the 
Airy Summation Method, 
  
 
where r1 and r2 represent the reflection coefficient of the two 
interfaces of an asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity. Substituting 
r1 = – r2 into (2) would recover the standard equation for the 
reflection of a symmetric Fabry-Perot cavity.

To examine the effects of reflection angles on the output 
of the effective Fabry-Perot cavity model, (2) is used to 
simulate the interference patterns of the reflected signal in 
three cases: 1) reflection occurs at an angle smaller than the 
critical angles, 2) reflection occurs at an angle larger than

the critical angles, and 3) reflection occurs at multiple 
angles both smaller than and larger than the critical angles. 
Fig. 5 shows the simulated interference patterns of the three 
cases for n2 values ranging from 1.00 to 1.30, corresponding 
to the critical angles from 42 degrees to 60 degrees. When 
the incident angle θi is set to 20°, the only effect of 
increasing the refractive index n2 is the decrease in peak-to-
peak amplitude due to the lessening of reflection 
coefficients for reflection below the critical angles. 
Changing the incident angle to 70°, however, causes the 
increasing refractive index to lose its effect on the reflection 
coefficients because of the reflection above the critical 
angle. Instead, the phase shift towards larger wavelength is 
observed as a result of increasing optical tunneling into the 
outside environment. If multiple reflections occur at 
multiple angles below and above the critical angle, both 
effects are observed and the reflected light experiences 
amplitude and phase modulation simultaneously as a result 
of varying refractive index in the evanescence zone. 
 
Figure 5.  Simulation of interference patterns of reflected light: (a) 
reflection below critical angles only (θi = 20°), (b) reflection above critical 
angles only (θi = 70°) and (c) reflection both below and above critical 
angles (θi = 20° and θi = 70°). 
C. Experimental Validation of Working Principle 
To validate the model with the actual device output, Fig. 
6 shows the model interference patterns produced from (2) 
for n2 of air, water, and ethanol in comparison with the 
experimentally obtained results for the same environment in 
Fig. 7. The significant phase shift and amplitude decrease 
observed in the experimental results clearly indicate that 
multiple reflections at the incident angles both above and 
below the critical angles took place. This effective Fabry-
Perot cavity model was able to describe the probe output 
remarkably well despite the complex structure and geometry 
of the device.

environments of air, water, and ethanol. 
Figure 7.  Reflected power (μW) measured for probe during 3 nm sweep 
in air, water, and ethanol. 
The tapered air cavity, which gives rise to multiple 
reflections at multiple non-normal angles within the glass 
cavity, sets this fiber-coupled probe apart from conventional 
self-reference interferometers. The reflection above the 
critical angle provides an additional refractive index-
sensitive effect, the Goos-Hänchen shift, unseen in devices 
with reflection only at normal angles.

BULK REFRACTIVE INDEX SENSING 
This section experimentally demonstrates the use of the 
fiber-coupled microcavity probe in bulk refractive index 
sensing. First, the experimental set-up for bulk refractive 
index measurements is described. Then, the bulk refractive 
index sensing performance is demonstrated with different 
volume fractions of ethanol and water mixtures. 
A. Experimental Set-Up 
The experimental set-up to demonstrate the interference 
properties of the fiber-coupled micro-sphere tip is illustrated 
in Fig. 8. An Ando AQ4320D Tunable Laser Source was 
wired to a 2×1 fiber optic coupler. The output of the coupler 
was sent to the SMF-28 fiber wedged in the micro-sphere 
tip. The reflected signal from the tip was measured by an 
Ando AQ6317 Optical Spectrum Analyzer wired to the 
second output of the coupler. Both the Tunable Laser 
Source and the Optical Spectrum Analyzer were connected 
to a PC and controlled by a LabVIEW VI. Spectra collection 
was also accomplished by the same program. 
B. Refractive Index Sensing with Ethanol-Water Mixture 
For a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of this 
device, the probe was exposed to deionized water and then 
subsequently to incremental concentrations of ethanol-water 
mixtures ranging from 0 to 40% volume fraction of ethanol. 
The experiment was performed in a flow system so as to 
allow the injection of different mixtures without disturbing 
the probe or exposing it to contaminants that could be 
present in the air. In each mixture, a 3 nm spectral sweep 
was performed centered around 1550 nm with 1 mW laser 
power. The reflected power was measured and found to 
demonstrate a red spectral shift and a decrease in peak-to-
peak amplitude with increasing ethanol concentration, as 
shown in Fig. 9. This result is in agreement with the model 
prediction when the refractive index of the immediate 
vicinity of the spherical tip, n2, is increased. 
 
Figure 8.  Experimental set-up for fiber-coupled micro-sphere tip 
interference measurements. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.  Red spectral shift and amplitude decrease of interference pattern 
as a result of exposure to 10-3 incremental changes in refractive index. 
As a control, the second set of measurements was 
performed in the reverse order from higher to lower 
concentration of ethanol. The reflected signals were found 
to match those of the first set of measurements. The 
refractive index of each ethanol-water mixture was also 
measured using a Fisher Scientific Abbe Benchtop 
Refractometer. Fig. 10 plots the change in peak-to-peak 
amplitude of the spectrums and the shift in peak wavelength 
as a function of mixture refractive index. Both the amplitude 
and the phase of the spectrum exhibited a linear change with 
increasing refractive index. The device demonstrated the 
sensitivity in spectral shift of 40 nm/RIU.  
The Limit of Detection (LOD) of the device was 
determined by performing the same measurements with 
smaller refractive index increments ranging from 0 to 2% 
ethanol volume fraction, as shown in Fig. 11. Although both 
the amplitude decrease and the red spectral shift were 
observed in the interference patterns, only the change in the 
peak-to-peak amplitude was resolvable by the Optical 
Spectrum Analyzer. Alternatively, when the amplitude 
change is small, the effect of the spectral shift can be 
magnified by measuring the reflected power at a single 
wavelength corresponding to the inflection point of the 
interference pattern. Fig. 12 plots the change in reflected 
power at the rising edge of the interference patterns, 
indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 11, and the change in 
peak-to-peak amplitude as a function of mixture refractive 
index. The device demonstrated the ability to detected 
minute changes in refractive index of the surrounding 
environment with the LOD in the range of 10-4 and 10-5 
RIU. The optimization of the probe geometry such as the 
profile of the tapered air cavity could further enhance the 
LOD of the device.

SURFACE BIOMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS SENSING 
This section experimentally describes the use of the 
fiber-coupled microcavity probe in real-time monitoring of 
biomolecular interactions on the glass spherical tip. The 
experimental set-up described in Section IV applies. The 
reagents for the surface reactions and the experimental 
procedures are described, followed by the interpretation of 
the experimental results. Lastly, the proof-of-concept for the 
device application in concentration analysis is demonstrated. 
A. Real-Time Monitoring of Silanization on Probe Tip 
One of the advantages of optical biosensors such as the 
SPR sensors over other types of biosensors is the relative 
ease of performing real-time monitoring of cellular 
environments or specific binding events [18][19]. To 
demonstrate the biosensing capability of the microcavity 
probe, the formation of self-assembled monolayer of an 
aminosilane coupling agent was monitored in real-time. The 
probe surfaces were cleaned in Piranha solution (3:1 v/v of 
H2SO4:H2O2) and then placed in a solution of 2% v/v of 3-
aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in acetone [20]. The 
solution was sealed with a molded polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS) stopper and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thread 
seal tape to avoid evaporation. The silanization of APTES 
refers to the deposition of APTES molecules onto an oxide 
substrate surface via hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding or 
electrostatic interactions. It is often used to functionalize 
inorganic silica substrates for selective binding of organic 
bio-targets [21]. The probe was incubated in the solution for 
12 hours as continuous 3 nm spectral sweeps, centered 
around 1550 nm with 1 mW laser power, were taken. The 
interference patterns obtained during the 12-hour APTES 
silanization exhibit blue spectral shift, as shown in Fig. 13. 
The change in reflected power at a single wavelength 
corresponding to the dotted line is also plotted as a function 
of incubation time.  
 
 
Figure 11.  Red spectral shift and amplitude decrease of interference pattern 
as a result of exposure to 10-5 incremental changes in refractive index. 
Figure 12.   (a) Change in reflected power at 1549.7 nm, and (b) change in 
peak-to-peak amplitude of each interference pattern relative to 0% ethanol  
as a function of refractive index. 
The change in reflected power at the rising edge 
illustrates the self-assembly of the APTES monolayer in the 
first 25-30 
minutes, and subsequent 
intermolecular 
interactions of APTES molecules on top of this monolayer 
in the 12-hour period after the monolayer formation. The 
total spectral shift of approximately 0.2 nm was observed as 
a result. This observed monolayer binding time-scale (20-30 
minutes) agrees with the standard protocol time-scale for a 5 
Å monolayer deposition of APTES on a silica substrate 
from organic solvents [21]. 
B. Interpreting Blue Spectral Shift 
It may be noted that the blue spectral shift as a result of 
molecular binding on the sensing surface is counter to the

red spectral shifts observed in typical resonance sensors, 
caused by an effective lengthening of the optical path due to 
the presence of the monolayer [22][23][24]. This counter-
intuitive effect can be explained by the fundamentally 
different working principle of the fiber-coupled probe, 
which behaves 
like a self-reference interferometer, 
compared to those of the typical resonance sensors. 
During the self-assembly of APTES molecules onto the 
spherical tip, the layer of surface-bounded molecules could 
be modeled as the third effective cavity, in addition to the 
air and the glass cavities discussed in Section III. The 
presence of this effective layer results in an additional 
effective reflection interface R3 between the APTES layer 
and the bulk solution, as shown in Fig. 14. Thus, the total 
reflected signal is the product of the interference of three 
electromagnetic waves: E1, E2 and E3. The blue spectral 
shift could be caused by a lessening of optical tunneling into 
the bulk solution due to the higher refractive index 
difference Δn = n2 – n3 between the APTES layer and the 
bulk solution as more APTES molecules deposited onto the 
glass spherical tip.

reflected power at 1549.55 nm (dotted line in (a)) as a result of 12 hours 
incubation in APTES silanization solution.  
Fig. 15 shows the predicted interference patterns during 
the self-assemble of APTES monolayer generated from (2), 
modified to include the third reflection surface. The 
refractive index and the thickness of the APTES monolayer 
were taken to be 1.46 and 5 Å, respectively [21]. The 
refractive index n3 of the APTES in acetone solution was 
measured by the refractometer and assumed to remain 
constant during the 30 minutes incubation period. The 
refractive index n2 was scaled from n3, when the surface was 
free of APTES molecules, to 1.46, when the monolayer 
formation was completed, over the course of 30 minutes. 
The experimentally obtained interference patterns during the 
first 30 minutes of incubation in 2% v/v solution of APTES 
in acetone is also shown for comparison.

The model successfully predicts the blue spectral shift of 
approximately the same magnitude as observed in the 
experimental results. Any discrepancies between the 
experimental results and the model prediction could be 
largely due to the distribution of model parameter n2 over 
time, which could not perfectly replicate the actually 
refractive index modulations during the silanization process. 
C. Concentration Analysis with Kinetic Data 
The ability to perform real-time detection allows the 
biosensor to monitor the interactions of bio-targets with 
immobilized binding sites as they occur. Real-time 
biosensors such as the Biacore SPR modules are able to 
extract the kinetic constants of the given binding pair and 
subsequently determine the affinity and concentration of the 
target molecules [25][26]. To investigate the use of the 
fiber-coupled probe in concentration determination with 
kinetic data, the silanization of APTES performed at 
different bulk concentration ranging from 0.2 to 4% volume 
fraction of APTES in acetone were monitored. The probe 
was cleaned in Piranha solution prior to incubation in each 
silanization solution. The probe was incubated for 30 
minutes in each solution, during which continuous 3 nm 
spectral sweeps, centered on 1550 nm with 1 mW laser 
power, were taken. The change in reflected power at a 
single wavelength corresponding to the rising edge of the 
interference patterns as a function of time is shown in Fig. 
16. The change in reflected power was normalized to the 
value previously obtained from the 2% solution at the 30-
minute mark, where the monolayer was assumed to have 
reached saturation. 
The time profile of the normalized change in reflected 
power is fitted to the adsorption model based on the 
Langmuir-type physico-chemical reversible process [27]. 
The model consists of three Langmuir parameters: the 
adsorption capacity, Γmax, defined as the ratio of the number 
of bounded molecules to the total number of binding sites at 
saturation, the association rate constant, ka, and the 
dissociation rate constant, kd; together they define both the 
reaction kinetics and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm of 
the process. Equation (3) describes the differential rate of 
adsorption based on the Langmuir adsorption model, where 
Γ(t) is the time dependent ratio of number of bounded 
molecules to the total number of binding sites and C0 
describe the bulk concentration of the target molecules. The 
three Langmuir parameters were determined from the 
experimental data graphically as described in [27]. Solving 
(3) for Γ(t), the model was fitted to the experimental data 
with C0 as the only changing variable for different APTES 
concentrations. 
 
      
      
Figure 16.  Experimentally obtained spectral shift of interference patterns as 
a result of 30 minutes APTES monolayer formation (blue circles) and 
model generated data-fitting of the same process (red lines).  
It should be noted that although these parameters are 
unique for a given chemical reaction, solution chemistry, 
and temperature, the comparison with previously reported 
values for the silanization of APTES is difficult. It is well 
established that the silanization of APTES on silicon oxide 
(SiO2) substrate is highly sensitive to the deposition 
conditions and outside environment, thus, the specific 
physico-chemical processes that occur during silanization 
vary significantly from experiments to experiment [28][29]. 
As shown in Fig. 16, the rate of deposition of APTES 
molecules onto the glass spherical tip based on the 
Langmuir kinetics was able to model the time profile of the 
spectral shift of the interference patterns during APTES 
monolayer formation from different bulk concentration. 
The results thus far demonstrate that the fiber-coupled 
probe could be used in real-time binding assays to extract 
kinetic information of the given interactions. While the total 
spectral shift at equilibrium might have a relatively low 
sensitivity to the change in bulk concentration at higher 
concentration range due to the system approaching 
saturation, the initial slope of the spectral shift as a function 
of time could be used to resolve minute concentration 
differences. Furthermore, a more rapid assay could be 
achieved by utilizing only the initial rate from the real-time 
monitoring as oppose to employing the more conventional 
equilibrium level value in the point sample detection. 
Moreover, the spectral shift as a function of incubation time 
was taken from the reflected power at a single wavelength. 
The detection could theoretically be done with a single-
wavelength light source without any needs for frequency 
sweeping, thus, lowering the total cost of the analysis 
procedure dramatically. 
For the sample of known concentration, the kinetic 
constants Γmax, ka and kd of the interactions can be 
determined. This process is an essential step in the 
development of new therapeutic agents as the specificity

and affinity of drugs to targeted species will greatly affect 
the efficacy of the treatment [10]. On the other hand, for the 
analysis of a certain interaction such as specific binding of 
antigen to its antibody pair, the concentration of the target 
molecules can be derived from the real-time binding data by 
fitting the results to known adsorption kinetics. In the case 
where both the transport phenomena and the reaction 
kinetics are well-established, such as the binding of a 
specific antigen to its antibody pair under a controlled flow 
in a microfluidic cell, the kinetic data obtained in real-time 
may offer a new platform of rapid CFCA [14][15]. Such 
analysis could make the fiber-coupled probe, given its low-
cost, robust, and easy-to-fabricate nature, a promising 
alternatives to point-of-care diagnostics. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Demonstrating the mode coupling between an optical 
fiber and a microcavity sphere works to bring the high 
sensitivity of optical microcavity sensors off of the optical 
table and into a robust integrated microprobe [30]. The 
integrated microprobe design has the distinct advantage of 
use in vivo without the need of microfluidics or precise 
optical alignment of evanescent coupling, and can be 
implemented for sample volumes on the order of several 
hundred pico-liters to nano-liters, essentially a wavelength 
thick layer of sample surrounding the spherical tip. 
The fiber-coupled microcavity probe operates on the 
bases of a self-reference interferometer with multiple 
reflections at multiple non-normal incident angles. The light 
source enters the probe tip via the optical fiber wedged into 
the finely tapered cavity inside glass spherical tip. The wave 
fronts scattered from the fiber tip are bent by the unique 
geometry of the tapered cavity, allowing the light to 
propagate within the spherical tip in a similar manner as a 
weak Q coupling of light into a spherical microcavity 
resonator. The multiple reflection angles allow the reflected 
interference signals from the probe to undergo both 
amplitude and phase modulation. This feature differentiates 
the microprobe from other optical fiber-based biosensors 
with similar needle-like device architecture, which only 
derive information from normal reflection at the flat fiber tip 
[31]. After multiple reflections within the glass cavity, the 
light eventually reenters the air cavity and couples back into 
the optical fiber, where it interferes with the back reflection 
from the flat end of the fiber. The probe model based on this 
principle of the effective Fabry-Perot cavity was able to 
describe the interference patterns of the reflected signal 
remarkably well. Even in the more complex cases of 
molecular interactions on the probe surface, modeling the 
layer of surface-bounded molecules as the third effective 
cavity with high refractive index could reproduce the 
seemingly counter-intuitive blue spectral shift observed 
during binding experiments. 
The first generation pre-optimization microprobes 
demonstrated sensitivity in the range of 10-4 to 10-5 RIU and 
the 40 nm/RIU under bulk refractive index measurements. 
In addition, monitoring of the spectral shift during the 
salinization process confirms a high degree of near-field 
(evanescent) sensitivity to the deposition of molecules onto 
the probe surface as the formation of the 5 Å self-assembled 
APTES monolayer was detected in real-time. Performing 
the silanization procedure at different concentration of 
APTES in the solution demonstrated that kinetics of the 
interactions may be extracted from the real-time data. The 
time profile of the spectral shift was shown to reflect the 
binding rate of APTES molecules as the data fitted the 
Langmuir physico-chemical adsorption kinetics over the 
range of concentrations tested. In addition, utilizing the 
initial rate of spectral shift from the real-time monitoring 
could resolve much smaller concentration differences than 
the more conventional equilibrium data from point sample 
detection. Thus, the experimental results demonstrate the 
proof-of-concept that this fiber-coupled microcavity probe 
can be used for detection of specific bio-targets in the 
evanescence near-field zone of the glass cavity, and even 
has potential use in studying real-time surface interaction 
kinetics and perform CFCA for point-of-care diagnostics. 
Although the specific wave characteristics of reflected 
light from the first generation prototypes varies from device 
to device due to the non-uniform probe geometry, the 
implementation of an automated fabrication platform with 
mechanical stages could control the size and curvature of 
the tapered air cavity and the glass spherical tip. 
Furthermore, though exhibiting sensitivity in bulk solution 
less than that achieved in other optical biosensors such as 
Surface Plasmon Resonance sensors, ring resonator sensors 
and interferometric sensors, which are able to detect down 
to 10-7 RIU, the data recorded thus far is from proof-of-
concept hand-made microprobes that are yet to undergo 
optimization as far as their cavity size and geometric effects 
on mode coupling [12]. For example, by fabricating smaller 
diameter spherical tips, we will be able to increase the 
nm/RIU limit of detection due to a shorter effective cavity 
length. Similarly, implementing the controlled automated 
fabrication platform, we hope to optimize the geometry of 
the tapered air cavity and probe curvatures. This 
optimization could lead to enhanced mode coupling between 
the fiber and the spherical tip by bending the incoming wave 
fronts such that the reflections in the spherical tip occur at 
the optimal angles for maximum coupling Q-factor. In 
addition, the geometric variations of the tapered air cavity 
and probe curvature could allow for tunability between the 
competing effects of the reflection coefficient modulation 
and Goos-Hänchen phase shift for the creation of far field 
and near field sensors, respectively.
