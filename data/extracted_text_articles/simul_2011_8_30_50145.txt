Abstract— This paper describes how methods and techniques 
from different fields of research can be combined to evaluate 
cost-intensive and business-critical decisions regarding future 
market development. In their concrete application a leading 
company from the construction supply industry has to make a 
decision on setting up of a spare part logistic. Three future 
alternatives (negative, constant, positive market growth) on 
market trends are simulated with a Monte Carlo simulation by 
considering a given demand history and possible locations for 
storage facilities were isolated by applying the Steiner-Weber 
method. Finally solving a mixed-integer formulation of the 
Uncapacitated-Facility-Location-Problem gives information on 
opening/closing new/existing storage facilities by minimizing all 
relevant costs. The results of this approach, containing 
information about a cost-based evaluation of all business 
related decision criteria, were examined with a sensitivity 
analysis.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
With the help of simulation, this case study analyzes the 
options for a German construction supplier to set up a spare 
part logistic. The company had an enormous growth during 
the last years - especially regarding the distribution of solar 
systems. Since these systems support the heating circuit of 
the ultimate customers, the company is in duty for 
delivering spare parts within a short time. Up to this date the 
company was able to serve these requests with the help of 
the general stocks but due to the enormous growth new 
options need to be developed. The first idea was to delegate 
this task to a service provider and some offers were invited. 
A comparison showed that the best offer was 460€ for 
delivering a single spare part to the customer. These high 
costs are the main reason for developing an own strategy 
with own storage facilities.  
A possible scenario was developed to cover all 
requirements. The first step was done by analyzing the 
demand history of the last year. Due to the fact that these 
won’t reflect the future development correctly, new market 
demands were created by using simulation. The second 
requirement within this scenario is the concrete location 
decision, based on geographic features. The last part of the 
basic consideration is the facility location problem, which 
solves the problem on making a cost-optimal decision 
regarding facility opening. The first assumptions were 
solved with the help of mathematical programming.  
In order to include the unpredictable requirements of the 
market, a sensitivity analysis was applied. The scenario has 
been modified towards a positive and negative price trend of 
the element of costs for different market growth options. 
II. 
SCENARIO ANALYSIS 
The present business case contains a lot of requirements 
which need to be considered. This section will define the 
restrictions which cause the analytic procedure.  
A. The Market 
The solar market experienced a strong growth during the 
last years. One reason is that the German government 
subsidized the setting up of solar systems until 2011. This 
discontinuation makes the market unpredictable for a broad 
consideration. Another aspect is that the demand is fluctuant 
during the year. There are peaks with 20% of the yearly 
demand and troughs with 2% of the yearly demand. To 
cover all of these deficits the demand has been forecasted 
for three different cases. The first case assumes a negative 
market growth with 70% of the former demand. This is 
named as the worst case. The next assumption covers up a 
faltering market growth by using 100% of the former 
demand. This approach comprises the average (avg) case. A 
positive market growth is coped by calculating with 130% 
of the former demand and is called the best case. These 
three scenarios should meet the requirements of the market. 
B. Conditions of supply 
Due to the fact that the spare parts need to be delivered 
within 12 hours, there are challenging requirements towards 
154

the transportation. This accomplishment could be ensured 
by using a courier service during the workday (69%) and a 
cap during the weekend and national German holidays 
(31%). Therefore the transportation costs are higher than 
using a shipping company. The used price for a kilometer is 
1.00€. As a vendor of systems for using renewal energy the 
company focuses on reducing the CO2 emission for the 
transportation. This is one of the reasons why this work 
considers spread storage.  
C. Range of spare parts 
For using new storage capacities the space requirements 
need to be analyzed. The former sales are used for a 
forecasting. There are 24 articles within the assortment. The 
smallest one measures 17cm x 17cm x 1cm (length x width 
x height). The biggest one measures 40cm x 43cm x 7cm. 
All articles have the size of standardizes parcels. There are 
no special needs for the transportation. Due to the fact that 
even articles with a low sales figure need to be stored in 
each location, the spacial amount will be higher than with 
the use of one location. The needed storage area of the last 
year sales would be 358,2m². Regarding to this fact, 
442,8m² would be needed for the spread storage.  
In order to classify the articles, an ABC-Analysis has 
been done. One of those spare parts could be classified with 
A and two of them as B. The other 21 parts are within the 
range of C parts.  
D. Existing depots 
The company owns three storage facilities. One of them 
is located in the northwest of Germany at the postal-zip-
code area beginning with the number three. The other two 
are located in the southwest very close to each other. Their 
postal-zip-code starts with the number six.  
Those warehouses should be involved within this work 
as potential spare part storage locations. Due to the fact, that 
they have to be considered as privileged, the costs are 
termed as zero, because they exist even though they are not 
in use as a spare part storage facility. 
III. 
APPROACH 
This section will introduce the used approach to solve 
each of the tasks. At first the simulation of future demands 
has to b done. After that, the location decision is explained. 
In the end the uncapacitated facility location problem will 
be introduced which is formulated with a mixed-integer 
program (MIP). 
A. Simulation of the demand 
As described in section two, the forecast of demands is 
not easy. Simulation became a favored and important method 
for solving problems within the field of production and 
logistics [1]. That is the reason for using a simulative method 
for this fraught decision with risk. This approach sets up the 
different scenarios for the market growth and the possible 
consequences could be deduced. 
Our decision went to the Monte-Carlo simulation as an 
approved method of choice for the task to generate 
randomized demands within a given planning horizon. This 
approach uses the aspects that all results have the same 
chance and are independent from each other [2].  
Because of the named characteristics this method is used 
for risk analysis very often. It is in use for complex 
processes which could not be solved directly. The unsteady 
demand could be simulated through this method, which is 
presented by a normal curve of distribution with the range 
of 70% till 130% of the former demand. To cover up a 
negative market growth the simulated demands were 
multiplied by 70%. The same was done for the positive 
market growth of 130% 
The five-figure postal-zip-code system is used to 
separate different areas of Germany. The first number of the 
code goes from 0 to 9. Therefore 10 markets could be 
pointed out. Fig. 1 shows the demand of the year 2010 
separated for the postal-zip-code areas.  
Figure 1. 
Separated demands (70%, 100% and 130%) by 
postal-zip-code 
 
It is obvious that the demand of the market 3 is much 
higher than the demand at the area number 1. The different 
density of population is one of the reasons. The area one has 
71-87 inhabitants per km² and the area 3 has 524 inhabitants 
per km². However the customers within Germany need to be 
delivered with taking into account the transportation 
restriction.  
These demands are the basic approach for the normally 
distributed randomized demand within the given range. The 
numbers were computed with Minitab for each area.

Table 1 gives a short overview about the results of the 
Monte-Carlo Simulation of the demand within a min./max.-
interval out of the result series. These results are used for 
the third step where mathematical programming has to be 
applied but at first the decision on facility location has to be 
made. Its result will be used within the mixed-integer 
program as well.  
B. Location decision 
After determining the demand, it is necessary to consider 
the location decision problem. The separation of 10 areas 
leads to the idea to set up a single storage facility per market. 
A traditional method for solving this task is the Steiner-
Weber location approach [3]. This technique is based on 
three assumptions: 
 
 
n customer with j= 1, …, n are supplied with a 
homogenous area. The position of the customer j is 
located at coordinates (uj, vj) with a demand of bj. 
 
each position is a potential location and 
 
the transportation costs ci,j between two positions 
are proportional towards the transported amount 
and distance. The costs are consistent for each unit. 
For the distance measurement the Euclidean meter 
will be used.  
 
The goal of this method is to discover the position which 
ensures an inexpensive supply to all customers. This 
problem could be formulated as minimizing problem: 
 
 (     )     ∑
     
 
   
   
 
 
      (1) 
 (     )       ∑
   √(     )
  (     )
 
 
   
  (2) 
 
One way to solve this equation is to split up the process 
into two steps. The first step is to calculate the weighted 
focus of all customer positions and their demands. This 
result will be improved with an approximate procedure until 
the result is almost optimal. This process is called the 
scheme of Miehle [6].  
In order to use this method, the markets have been 
separated by the second number of their postal-zip-code. 
The focuses of these areas are used as the demand spots. 
Each location sums up all demands within this area  
This method results in having 10 potential locations for 
setting up spare part storage locations as shown in Fig. 2. 
These locations are the basic approach for the next step 
during the whole analysis.

Weber method 
 
C. Facility Location Problem 
After nominating locations for new facilities, these have 
to be analyzed regarding the costs. Each of them causes 
costs for being operated and on the other hand reduces 
transportation costs to the customer due to shorter delivery 
routes. This class of problems is called facility location 
problem and covers all problems were a selection of 
different locations has to be made. The proceeding is based 
on graphs where the nodes are representing the locations 
and the edges are representing the distance between them. 
All nodes have a certain demand. These models are named 
as finitely discrete. Furthermore, a differentiation regarding 
the overall goal could be done. The minmax locations 
problem tries to minimize the largest distances between the 
locations. The other type is the minsum location problem 
and tries to minimize the sum of all distances [7]. A special 
model of this class is the Uncapacitated-Facility-Location-
Problem (UFLP). This problem is also called Simple-Plant-
Location- or Uncapacitated-Warehouse-Location-Problem. 
As given in the name there are no restrictions regarding the 
capacities since all location are new as in this present 
business case. The model contains the following parameters: 
 
n locations denoted as Si with i=1, …, n, 
 
m customer denoted as Kj with j=1, …, m with 
a demand of Dj, 
 
fix costs Fi for opening up a location 
 
the transportation costs are between two 
locations with cij.

   *   +                            
 
      (7) 
 
This model contains two decision variables within the 
constraints. One of them is yi. It is a binary variable to 
decide either if a location is opened (yi=1) or not (yi=0). 
This is necessary because of the fixed cost for the facilities. 
The other variable is zij which stands for the available parts 
within this location for fulfilling the customer demands. The 
objective function minimizes the costs consisting of the sum 
of transportations cost in the first part and the cost for 
setting up the facility in the second part. These constrains 
make sure that all demands are covered (4) and that the 
demand is delivered by a location which exists (5). 
The model was implemented with the tool IBM ILOG 
OPL Optimization studio in version 12. Due to the fact that 
this model does not consider variable costs the fixed costs 
include all fees like the rental fee for the storage space 
(different for each area), the picking fees (15€ per pick), the 
fix salary of the employee (3600€ per year) and costs for the 
material and equipment (1200€ per year). Those costs were 
calculated for the three scenarios with 70%, 100% and 
130% of the former demand. The costs are shown in table 2.

up and compared with the service provider. 
IV. 
RESULTS OF THE BASIC APPROACH 
After implementing the model and the data to the tool a 
clear result occurs. The results of the first assumption are 
explicit 
A. Average case results 
This case studied a continuous demand in referring to 
the former demand. For this case 30 different demands were 
proofed. The facilities of the markets 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 
9 were opened. In addition to this both existing facilities at 
the market 6 were used to deliver the spare parts. The 
facility of the market 3 was not in use. This result occurs for 
each demand. Summing these up costs 403.339,80€ per year 
could be expected.  
B. Worst case results 
An equal result as in the average case showed up in this 
case. The new facilities of all markets besides the market 6 
are in use and in addition to this both existing facilities of 
the market 6. The location of the market 3 is not in use 
again. This effect was shown by all demands. The average 
cost of all iteration is 300.149,47€.  
C. Best case results 
For two demands out of this 30 series, another results 
showed up and new facility of the market 6 were opened up. 
The other new locations were opened too and the existing 
storage facilities were use too, besides of the market 3. The 
average cost are 502.542,73€ per year. 
D. Comparison to a service provider 
The most interesting investigation for the company 
within is the comparison of the costs referring to the fees of a 
service provider. This assumption has been done for the three 
market growth scenarios. 
a) Average Case 
The costs for delivering the spare parts to the facility 
differ about 69%. The company has to pay more because 
they have to deliver more facilities for storage. On the other 
hand the company does have less cost for delivering the 
parts to the customer. The company just would need pay 
10,72% of the charged fees if they would do it by their self. 
This could be shown summed up with the unit costs. 
One unit would cost 460,24€ with the service provider and 
82,33€ with the introduced scenario.

b)  Worst Case 
The first compared component is the delivery for the 
storage facilities. As shown before in this case the costs for 
the company are even higher too. They would pay 65% 
more. Even for this case the cost are higher if they would 
choose the service provider. The delivering could be 
realized for 15,31% of the offered price.

The unit cost are 460,74 € for the service provider and 
87,52€ for the own concept. The reduction of costs per unit 
is 0,093% for the offered service and 6,45% for own 
facilities for considering the worst and the avg case.

c) Best Case 
If the company would deliver the parts to the stocks by 
themselves they have to pay 64% more towards the offered 
service. But on the other hand they would save 89,28% by 
delivering the parts to the customers from the spread 
locations.  
For the offered service a fee per unit would be 459,77€ 
and for the alternative 78,91€. Comparing this result to the 
average case it shows that the reduction of costs per unit 
would be 3,82% for the company option and 0,048% for the 
service provider.

Summarizing up the scenario is even more important if 
the company decides to enlarge the article range or if there 
would be a positive market growth.  
V. 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
In order to verify these results a sensitivity analysis was 
done for each scenario of market growth. In order to find 
out about the impact of the components within the fixed 
costs, they have been changed. As shown in table 6 the fees 
are studied with three different characteristics.  
 
TABLE VI. 
Changed fees for the fixed costs  
 
The new combinations of fixed costs have been 
implemented to the OPL model. For each case 10 different 
demand series were studied to show up the relationship 
between the elements. Another aspect which was observed 
is the rate of opening for each new facility. 
The further proceeding is separated into two parts. The 
first one will consider the opening rate in correlation with 
costs. The results are represented in cubes for each scenario. 
The x-axis represents the costs per km, the y-axis shows the 
fix salary and the z-axis displays the picking fee. The 
average costs of the 10 series are presented by the number at 
each node.  
A surprising aspect of the basic approach was that the 
new location of the market 3 was in use. The sensitivity 
analysis shows that this fact changes. The red line at the Fig. 
3, 4 and 5 indicates that the normal stock location of 3 is in 
use, instead of the new one for more than 50% of the results. 
By comparing the three scenarios, it shows up that the 
surface at the dices is getting smaller with an increased 
market growth as shown up in Fig. 5. This led to the 
realization that if the market achieves a positive growth, the 
costs, especially the transportation costs, need to grow much 
more for using the basic stock location of the market 3 than 
it would be for the negative case.  
Another aspect could be pointed out for the new facility 
at the market 5. The results for all market growth scenarios 
show a recommendation of 100% for most of the 
combinations. An exception occurs for all combinations 
with the transportation costs of 1,50€ per km. This new 
facility should be considered if the transportation costs are 
lower than this.

Figure 5. Cube illustrating the best case results 
 
The new stock for the market 7 shows variations in 
recommendations too. Within the study of the lowest 
demand it shows up that this location was not in use for 
each combination of the transportation rate 1,50€ and for a 
fix salary 800€ and most of 500€. As for the market 3 with 
an increased demand this changes and more often this 
location is recommended. The average scenario shows that 
it would not be profitable to open up the stock for all 
combinations with a transportation rate of 1,50€, besides 
with a fix salary of 300€. The best case recommends this 
new facility not for all cases with a transportation rate of 
1,50€. The costs per km are the most influential factor for 
this location. An equal observation could be made for the 
new facility of the market 8. 
Moreover, the statistical analysis of the designed 
experiments allows the derivation of a mathematical meta-
model for the resulting cost with a forecast quality of more 
than 98%. It’s just based on the above mentioned input 
factors. Fig. 6 shows the relevance of each of the three input 
factors. It can be seen, that the fixed salary has the most 
significant influence on the resulting cost.

Figure 7. Response surface for resulting costs 
 
Fig. 7 shows a derived response surface for the resulting 
costs of this model based on the derived meta-model. For 
each combination of fixed salary and picking fees, the 
resulting cost structure can be directly derived. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This present business study shows how scientific 
methods can be applied to the real world and how they can 
support the decision making regarding real business 
problems. With this approach, using basic methods and 
implying real costs, we developed a framework which 
makes 
considering 
various 
alternatives 
possible. 
Furthermore the responsible management now has a basis 
for argumentation in cold print, since all parameters are 
given by the company and based on the company-wide 
costs. 
For completeness of the results, the sensitivity analysis 
showed that the transportation cost and the fix salary have 
an enormous influence on the outcome calculated with the 
facility location problem. A possible recommendation for 
the company, based on the pure results could be to use new

facilities within the markets 0, 1, 2, 4 and 9, as well as all 
basic stocks too, until the market growth could be estimated 
concretely. But the realistic orientation of these results 
needs to be considered too, since decisions within 
companies are made often in more difficult and elusive 
ways. Realistic options would probably be opening a single 
stock facility because of the unsafe market growth or maybe 
supply contracts with authorized premium dealer, which 
have available storage capacity and which are already 
familiar with the products. 
Based on the more complex simulation and optimization 
models, a statistical meta-model could be derived via an 
experimental design study on the three input factors. It 
allows a forecast quality of the resulting cost structure of 
more than 98%, and thereby, can be used for further cost 
analysis, if some input factors change to a level, that has not 
been regarded during the here described study yet. 
Furthermore and referring to current discussions on 
sustainability and environmentally-conscious behavior, it 
could be of interest to investigate on the impact and 
influence of decision making towards reducing the emission 
of CO² in transport options.
