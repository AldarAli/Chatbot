Abstract—This paper presents a method for achieving 
functional safety for an automated vehicle system with respect 
to safe transitions between a manual and an automated driver, 
where any single mistake of the human driver is tolerated. 
Safety analysis and assessment of an implementation example 
show how to allocate safety requirements on Human-Machine 
Interface (HMI) components to handle the risks of unfair 
transitions and mode confusion. Results from this example 
show that it is sufficient to allocate safety requirements on the 
sensor of, and the lock of, a single lever to ensure safe 
transitions. No safety requirements are needed on visual 
feedback to the driver, e.g., displays. 
Keywords-functional safety; highly automated driving; safety 
assessment. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Presently, the most critical factor for road vehicle safety 
is the behavior of the driver. There are different estimates, 
but a common understanding is that humans directly cause 
significantly more than 90% of serious accidents. More 
advanced functionality and intelligence implemented in the 
vehicle means that more of the responsibility to drive safely 
may be shifted from the skill of the driver to the capability of 
the functionality implemented in the vehicle.  
The potential safety benefit of increased vehicle 
automation is undoubtedly huge but it is important that the 
extra risks coming from potential failures of automation are 
limited to a minimum. In the discipline of functional safety, 
there are methods to assess risks of malfunctioning E/E 
implemented functionality, and to reduce these sufficiently. 
For road vehicles, ISO 26262, [1], is the functional safety 
standard.  
This paper focuses on systems where the vehicle in some 
specific situations takes full responsibility for the driving 
task, i.e., level 3 (L3) automation according to the scale 
defined 
by 
the 
National 
Highway 
Traffic 
Safety 
Administration (NHTSA). Regarding the responsibility of 
the manual driver (MD), the precise L3 definition says: “The 
driver is expected to be available for occasional control, but 
with 
sufficiently 
comfortable 
transition 
time”, 
and 
furthermore: “the driver is not expected to constantly 
monitor the roadway”, [2].  
In order to prove that a L3 vehicle is functionally safe, 
there are two general strategies how to consider the 
interaction between the manual driver and the vehicle, what 
in the ISO 26262 terminology is denoted controllability.  
In the less conservative strategy, controllability is 
investigated in detail for all possible scenarios where the 
manual driver is “expected to be available for occasional 
control”. In the traditional research field of human factors, 
this is a research question that is currently very much 
investigated [3], [4], [5]. A rather recent overview of what 
controllability assumptions that are reasonable on NHTSA 
L2 and L3 is found in [6]. 
In the more conservative strategy, there are no 
assumptions that the manual driver can take back control 
within a bounded time. One could say that we do not require 
the driver to be comfortable with any short transition time. 
This strategy is the one chosen by Volvo Cars in the 
DriveMe project [7], where the vehicle takes full 
responsibility to safely handle any critical situation during 
automated driving. We can call this an autopilot with full 
responsibility for safety, as it does not need to rely on any 
responsiveness from the manual driver to stay safe. 
An unsolved question so far, is if the more conservative 
assumption about the human capability still can enable the 
design of a functionally safe car. The introduction of an 
autopilot with full responsibility leads to two new challenges 
within functional safety. We need to ensure safety when the 
autopilot is in charge, but also ensure safe transitions 
between the manual driver and the automated driver (AD). 
This paper investigates the latter. 
The contribution of this paper is a method for achieving 
functional safety for an automated vehicle system with 
respect to safe transitions between a manual driver and an 
autopilot with full responsibility for safety. We assume that 
both the human driver and the autopilot are capable of safe 
driving, as well as judging its own ability to drive safely. 
Thus, neither the driver nor the autopilot are required to take 
control and thus the vehicle will be in a safe state if either the 
driver or the autopilot accept to take control of the vehicle.  
There are simulator studies suggesting that human drivers 
may change their driving behaviour when taking back 
control from an autopilot, [8].  This is not considered in this 
paper as we focus on functional safety rather than design of 
the HMI or autopilot driving behaviour.  
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
the new hazards related to the driving mode transitions 
introduced by NHTSA L3. In Section III, we discuss how to

define a safe transition and the acceptable level of fault 
tolerance. Section IV elaborates on possible implementations 
using a system example and corresponding functional safety 
analysis and assessment. Finally, Section V presents 
concluding remarks. 
II. 
WHAT CAN CAUSE THE ROAD VEHICLE TO BE UNSAFE 
One interpretation of a hazard analysis & risk assessment 
(HA&RA) today according to ISO26262 is that the vehicle 
itself is considered safe, if it only puts the driver in situations 
that are possible to manage safely. The driver is ultimately 
responsible for safe driving, and the malfunctions of the 
vehicle should be restricted in such a way that the driver can 
keep the vehicle in a safe state. The explicit method for 
determining the requested Automotive Safety Integrity Level 
(ASIL), restricting a certain hypothetical vehicle failure, is to 
measure three factors: exposure, severity and controllability. 
The two first factors are the traditional ones that are part of 
the definition of risk, i.e., a combination of probability and 
severity. The third factor is the one that takes into account 
that the driver may sometimes have a possibility to keep the 
vehicle safe, even though the ordinary (safety-related) 
functionality is failing.  
When we shift from a situation where a manual driver 
has the ultimate responsibility, to highly automated driving 
where the manual driver and an autopilot are alternating, this 
will have an impact on the HA&RA. So, what will become 
different when going from NHTSA L2 to L3? This new 
challenge has partly been addressed in [9]. 
We require the same from an autopilot as from a manual 
driver. This means focusing on a safe style of driving, 
making the driver capable to handle also unexpected events. 
When programming an autopilot, this is what we cover on 
the tactical level [10], [11]. The autopilot should always 
choose to perform the maneuvers in such a way that 
reasonable, but still unexpected, situations could be handled 
safely. For example, the decision whether or not to initiate an 
overtaking maneuver is on the tactical level. An optimistic 
decision to overtake may cause the vehicle in a situation 
where avoiding one accident may cause another. The 
solution to this dilemma is of course to initiate an overtaking 
maneuver only when the entire operation is foreseen to be 
possible to fulfil in a safe manner.  
Note the contrast to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems 
(ADAS), where the vehicle takes over only on the 
operational time scale, and then assumes the manual driver to 
continue according to the (maybe revised) tactical plan. The 
ADAS functionality today, does not take the ultimate 
responsibility to drive the vehicle safely. Firstly, it only 
operates on the operational time scale. Secondly, it only 
assists the manual driver. When the responsibility is 
transferred from the manual driver to the autopilot, there is 
no longer an assistance relation. The transfer means that 
from then on, the automated driver is fully responsible for 
driving the vehicle safely. 
Given that the autopilot can drive safely once in 
command, the HA&RA must also cover the transitions 
between the driver and the autopilot. In NHTSA L3, these 
transitions introduce two new types of hazards, namely 
unfair transitions and mode confusion. These are described 
in detail in the following sections.  
A. Unfair transitions 
As we noted in the above section, it may be complicated 
for the driver to make a proper override of a failing tactical 
decision of the automated driver. This is because drivers may 
find different tactical solutions to a certain driving situation, 
and each of these may be correct. It may be hard for a driver 
to distinguish a faulty tactical decision from a one that is just 
different from his or her own favorite pattern. Even more, it 
may be very hard to continue to fulfill a tactical plan of 
another driver if the responsibility is transferred in the 
middle of the intended sequence. This difficulty is both for a 
manual driver to continue a plan of the automated driver, and 
for the automated driver to continue what has been initiated 
by the manual driver.  
If the manual driver realizes that the automated driver has 
handed over responsibility, without the manual driver 
agreeing to this, this is a new risk to consider when entering 
NHTSA L3. We can say that the manual driver is put in a 
situation of unfair transition. For a driver with the same 
understanding of the planned tactics, the situation may be 
easy to handle, but an unfair transition may put the driver in 
a situation where driving safely will be very difficult. 
The problem of unfair transitions may appear in both 
directions. It is reasonable to assume that the automated 
driver can drive safely as long as it can choose its own 
tactics. This is a far easier task than being able to understand 
and solve arbitrary situations.  
To summarize, if the responsibility is transferred from 
one driver to the other, this must include a confirmation from 
the receiving driver. Otherwise, the transition may be 
regarded as unfair, and it is a non-negligible risk that the 
second driver is incapable of handling the situation, on both 
operational and tactical time scales.  
B. Mode confusion 
In order to make the entire trip from start to stop safe, it 
is critical that the two drivers always agree on which of them 
that currently is in charge. If they misunderstand each other, 
there is a risk that either there are two drivers trying to 
control the vehicle, or there is no one taking care of the ride. 
Both these potential mode confusions need to be addressed.  
If we allow both the manual driver and the automated 
driver to override each other, there is an obvious risk that the 
resulting non-harmonized commanding of the vehicle may 
result in dangerous situations. This is especially probable 
because the two drivers most likely make different tactical 
decisions now and then, and as consequence regard the 
operative command of the other as faulty. For safe driving in 
NHTSA L3, it is important to reduce the risk of this 
reciprocal override. 
It is perhaps even more obvious that it will become 
dangerous if neither the manual driver nor the automated 
driver regard herself as the ultimately responsible. Such 
reciprocal underride is therefore obviously important to 
reduce properly when performing the risk assessment for 
driving on NHTSA L3.

C. State-of-the-art comparison with other industries 
This section describes technology, systems and concepts 
from other industries where similar problems arise caused by 
mode confusion and unsafe transitions. The focus has been 
on nuclear, rail, avionics and space since these industries 
deal with complex systems, is in a regulated environment 
and all demand active users for proper operations. 
Experiences from other industries give valuable insight into 
how to design interfaces and processes that ensure safe 
transitions in the context of autonomous driving. However, 
these inspiration sources material and solutions need to be 
adapted to fit into the automotive context in order to be a 
viable tool. 
As the existing autonomous systems within the 
automotive industry are still in their infant stages and the 
majority of them still are semi-autonomous (i.e. NHTSA L1-
L2) at time of writing, these systems are excluded. The 
interested reader may study results from several research 
efforts on this topic; PReVENT, HAVE IT, ADAPTIVE and 
INTERACTIVE to mention a few. 
When reviewing earlier experiences from nuclear, 
avionics, rail and space industries we make one important 
observation. Within these industries, the technical solutions 
are operated by educated users, certified to use the specific 
equipment, often in controlled environments and in 
cooperation with colleagues supporting them. 
In avionics, there is a system called Auto Ground 
Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS) that monitors the 
pilot’s response in certain situations and if the pilot does not 
respond to an alarm, the system takes over and performs the 
necessary manoeuvre. After avoiding the threat, control is 
returned to the pilot. Inagaki describes this as situation-
adaptive autonomy where authority over a system is 
transferred between human and machine agents, [12]. 
However, the main point of reference within avionics is that 
an educated pilot is responsible for operation of the airplane 
at all times, differing from the automotive situation. 
Two major players in the avionics industry, Boeing and 
Airbus, apply different philosophies regarding automation. 
Boeing implements a strict assisting role for technology and 
automation, where the pilot always acts as the final authority. 
Airbus rather sees automation as a way of enhancing flight 
performance by assisting the responsible pilot. This subtle 
difference in philosophy causes different problems, where 
the Boeing strategy allows the pilot to perform errors that 
may cause accidents and the Airbus strategy may interfere 
and 
prevent 
the 
pilot 
from 
performing 
necessary 
maneuverers needed for safety in extreme situations [13] 
[14]. 
Within nuclear there are numerous processes to monitor. 
This is handled with different interfaces displaying process 
information. In Sweden there are different systems ensuring 
correct decisions regarding the operation of the nuclear plant. 
There are regulations stating that the plants are to be 
designed in such a way that operators always have a 30 
minute window to perform an action. In other words, the 
plant is fully autonomous for 30 minutes at a time. There are 
also mechanisms that require several users to acknowledge 
an action independently in order to perform it, which can be 
compared to the needed protocol in automotive. However, 
the time constants at play are significantly different when 
compared to the automotive setting. 
In the nuclear industry, one main control board always 
represents the true state of the processes. It is assured to a 
higher safety integrity and acts as the primary source of 
information should different sources provide inconsistent 
information. The inconsistent information does pose less of a 
problem since nuclear operators are well educated with the 
system and knows what information to depend on. However, 
translating this into the automotive setting is problematic, 
where most of the information sources primary purpose is to 
enhance and ease the experience rather than to provide 
safety-assured information on the system state. 
Within the space industry, interfaces and systems are 
often complex and users need to understand how to use 
many different systems at the same time for proper 
operation. Because of this, a lot of effort is put into mental 
models of the systems; the users do not need to understand 
how and why the systems work only have a basic 
understanding of what situations the system can be used in 
and what the outcome would be. This could be translated 
into the automotive setting where the situation is similar, 
although on a smaller scale and users need to quickly gain a 
basic 
understanding 
about 
the 
autonomous 
systems 
capabilities and limitations. 
Studies from the rail industry have analysed operator 
workload and the possibilities of it causing human errors. 
Two main ways of managing human performance have been 
formulated, through either technology or human resource 
management. Assessment of individual possibilities to 
manage the required workload has been performed through 
psychometric testing, as well as limiting workdays and 
issuing regular breaks [15].  
As the automotive setting makes it difficult to limit usage 
periods, the technology and interfaces must be designed to 
ensure safe usage under these circumstances. Adaptive 
interface features linked to specific task requirements with 
consistency in interface design across different modes of 
system operation is recommended in order for the users to 
effectively apply mental models [16].  
III. 
WHAT MAKES A TRANSITION SAFE 
In the previous section, we have listed new categories of 
risks to handle related to the dual driving modes when going 
up in automation degree to NHTSA L3. In the following 
sections we summarize our current understanding on how to 
handle these. 
A.  General Strategy 
A main strategy to eliminate unfair transitions is to 
introduce a fair procedure for handover. This means that the 
current responsible driver (manual or automated) stays 
responsible until there is an agreement for a handover. If we 
can find out how to design safe handover of responsibility, 
this will then solve the problem of unfair transitions. For a 
handover to be regarded as safe, we need to address both 
what is reasonable to assume of a driver, and what safety 
23

DEPEND 2016 : The Ninth International Conference on Dependability

requirements we need to allocate on the elements 
implementing the vehicle part of the handover protocol. 
The problem of Mode confusion can be solved by 
combining safe handover mechanisms with requirements on 
each of the two candidate drivers to remember who is 
currently in charge. When the automated driver is 
responsible, the manual driver should then try to avoid 
interfering with the AD. This can be solved by not allowing 
the MD to have any impact on the vehicle, if not first going 
through a handover procedure. If we want, we can transfer 
part of that manual responsibility to the vehicle by putting 
safety requirements on ignoring any try from the manual 
driver to control the motion of the vehicle. Furthermore, we 
require of the manual driver to stay responsible once 
becoming in charge. In a similar way, we put safety 
requirements on the vehicle to remember who the agreed 
responsible driver is.  
B. 
 Fault Tolerance 
As stated in the previous section, we require from a safe 
transition that the two candidate responsible drivers (MD and 
AD) regard the transitions fair and have a common 
understanding who has received the responsibility. This 
implies that both drivers need to explicitly confirm that a 
transition is possible and fair to perform. Furthermore, it 
implies that both drivers really are aware of what has been 
agreed. 
Already today, we have a substantial amount of serious 
traffic accidents caused by driver lapses. There is no reason 
why not to regard the manual driver of a highly automated 
vehicle as prone to mistakes in any HMI, including the one 
for transition of responsibility. Because of this, we need to 
have a procedure where the manual driver has to perform 
several and coordinated actions, in order to allow a 
transition. Every single action can be assumed as performed 
by mistake, but the more of coordinated multiple actions that 
are required the less probable it is that the driver is not aware 
of what she or he is doing.  
For the vehicle, we assume that safety requirements are 
allocated to all elements critical for achieving a transition in 
such a way that it can be considered as fair and consistently 
understood by both drivers. We make a conservative 
assumption that the ASIL attribute to use is the one that is 
representing the highest ASIL among the possible induced 
hazards. In practice, this means that we need ASIL D on 
guaranteeing freedom from mode confusion and from unfair 
transitions. Of course, redundancy patterns may be applied 
allowing the ASIL D to be decomposed onto different 
elements of the implementation. 
A way to argue that a transition is safe is to check what 
happens if there is either a manual mistake or an E/E failure, 
or combination of these. This must be checked for any state 
in the transition protocol. For any hazardous consequence, it 
must be shown that the corresponding E/E failure is 
prevented with an appropriate safety requirement. If a 
manual failure may lead to a hazardous consequence even in 
a fault free case, the protocol implementation is obviously 
not robust enough.  
IV. 
GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTION 
In order to make a transition tolerant to any single 
manual mistake, there are a few different general ways to 
design the protocol. The redundant action from the manual 
driver can in general be either in time or in space, or a 
combination of these. By time redundancy, we mean here to 
request a sequence of actions where the second must follow 
in a certain time interval after the first one. Space 
redundancy is on the other hand when the manual driver is 
requested to apply several actions simultaneously. In both 
cases, the idea is that it can be argued that the set of actions 
is extremely unlikely to be performed by mistake. 
A. Example HMI Protocol and Implementatios 
As an example in this paper, we chose to describe a 
protocol based on manual time redundancy. This means that 
we always require two actions from the driver for any 
transition from MD to AD or from AD to MD. Furthermore, 
we say that the second action of the manual driver defines 
the transition, which means that there is no requirement on 
the manual driver to observe the resulting outcome correctly, 
more than knowing what she is doing herself. As long as the 
second action is fulfilled, the transition is deemed to have 
occurred.  
In Figure 1, a general protocol is illustrated, where two 
coordinated actions are required from the manual driver. 
When implementing this it is important not to allow the 
driver to perform the second action, without having 
acknowledged the first one.  
In this example, we chose the first action to be a press of 
a button and the second to be a change of lever position. This 
lever has exactly two possible positions: AD and MD. The 
vehicle is always started in MD, and the driver may change 
the mode after reaching the proper state in the transition 
protocol. We consider the lever to be locked at any other 
time. Furthermore, if the lever is not moved fast enough after 
getting acknowledge by the autopilot, it will be locked again 
requiring the protocol to start over again in order to perform 
a transition.

This protocol is based on the assumption that it is always 
safe to keep the mode if nothing else is agreed. The current 
driver should always be able to continue to take care of the 
vehicle in a safe manner. 
We can extend the protocol to cover the cases where the 
AD can suggest a transition, either by declaring that the AD 
is ready to take over from the MD, or by telling the MD that 
the AD performance is limited. Such a protocol is depicted in 
Figure 2. 
To implement this protocol we suggest the following 
HMI components: 
 
Telltale light showing the AD view of preferred 
mode 
 
 Pushbutton to for the MD to ask for mode change 
(first action) 
 
Telltale light showing whether the AD is prepared 
for a change as requested by the MD 
 
Lever for the MD to select mode (second action) 
 
Any failure mode of these four HMI components then 
needs to be included in the safety analysis, and this in 
combination by any single mistake by the manual driver. 
To summarize, a fault-free uninterrupted transition from 
the MD to the AD in this example follow the steps: 
 
The MD drives the vehicle (MD mode) 
 
The AD declares it is ready to take over by changing 
the preference telltale to AD available 
 
The MD asks to take over by pressing the 
pushbutton 
 
The AD acknowledges that it is prepared by 
indicating the readiness telltale and unlocking the 
lever 
 
The MD changes the lever to AD position 
 
The AD locks the lever, and continues to drive in 
AD mode 
The transition from AD to MD is performed in a similar 
way, i.e., the MD may either independently, or suggested by 
the AD, start by asking for a mode change. The AD then 
acknowledges by indicating on the readiness telltale and 
unlocking the lever. Finally, the MD changes the lever to the 
MD position and starts to drive manually.

B. Safety Analysis 
In the following section, the above protocol and 
implementation is analyzed with respect to its sensitivity to 
any human mistake, vehicle component failure, or a 
combination of these. Hence, we walk through the detailed 
state 
diagram 
and 
investigate 
the 
possible 
failure 
consequences at any state.  
When doing the safety analysis, we document the result 
in Table 1. The columns are: 
 
Protocol state 
 
HMI failure to investigate 
 
Possible driver mistake 
 
Consequence in words 
 
Consequence in terms of safe/unsafe 
 
Each row in this table marked as unsafe in the last 
column needs to be protected by a corresponding safety 
requirement allocated to restrict this HMI failure. If all 
occurrences of an unsafe consequence are protected by 
appropriate safety requirements, the protocol implementation 
is deemed safe. In order for the safety argumentation to be 
valid, it is important that the table is shown to be complete. 
This includes an argumentation that all possible human 
mistakes are considered. 
C. Safety Assessments 
As concluded from the safety analysis in Table 1, there 
are three ways for the example protocol to fail in an unsafe 
way, caused by either of a manual mistake, a vehicle 
component failure, or a combination of these. The three 
failures that we need to avoid to maintain safety are: 
 
The AD cannot correctly sense the mode lever 
position, which may cause mode confusion. 
 
The AD cannot guarantee lock of the mode lever 
according to the protocol. This in combination with 
the MD moving the mode lever to AD mode, 
without noticing it, may cause mode confusion (or 
unfair transition if discovered by the MD). 
 
The AD cannot guarantee locking of the mode lever 
according to the protocol. This in combination with 
the MD changing lever position from MD to AD, 
without getting acknowledgment of a prepared AD, 
may cause unfair transition.  
As we assume that the MD may make any single failure 
at any time, the way to argue for avoiding the above failures 
is to put the entire responsibility on the vehicle. This implies 
that we put two safety requirements on the HMI. 
 
ASIL D on restricting faulty lever sensor, i.e., the 
lever sensor needs to be always correct. 
 
ASIL D on restricting lever lock faulty unlocked 
(faulty locked consider as safe). 
If we can guarantee that the HMI is implemented 
according to these two safety requirements we can claim that 
we make a safe transition even in the presence of an arbitrary 
single manual mistake. This handles both the mode 
confusion and the unfair transition aspects of a safe 
transition.

If ASIL D sensors and/or ASIL D locks are considered 
either unavailable or very expensive, we may consider 
redundancy implementation techniques. Instead of one 
sensor always telling the correct lever position with ASIL D 
attribute, we may consider three (sic!) sensors each with 
ASIL B. If at least two of the three are correct, we can stay 
safe. This means that we need to restrict that two of the three 
are failing. This shall be guaranteed with a total ASIL D, 
which we distribute as ASIL B on each sensor. Similarly, 
using ASIL A sensors would require seven times 
redundancy. If four out of seven are working we consider it 
as safe. This means that we need to restrict that four of the 
sensors are failing. This shall be guaranteed with a total 
ASIL D, which we distribute as ASIL A on each sensor. 
Instead of one lever lock always guaranteeing that the 
lever is never faulty unlocked, we may consider two locks 
each with ASIL B. We consider faulty locked as a safe state. 
If at least one of two locks can guarantee freedom from 
faulty unlocked, we can stay safe. This means that we need 
to restrict that both of the two locks are faulty unlocked. This 
shall be guaranteed with a total ASIL D, which we distribute 
as ASIL B on each lock. Similarly, using locks guaranteeing 
absence of faulty unlocked with ASIL A would require 
quadruple redundancy. If only one of the locks is avoiding 
faulty unlocked, we consider it as safe. This means that we 
need to restrict that all the four locks are faulty unlocked. 
This shall be guaranteed with a total ASIL D, which we 
distribute as ASIL A on each lock.

CONCLUSION 
When introducing an autopilot which in some driving 
situations takes full responsibility to drive the vehicle, it 
becomes crucial to ensure safe transitions between the 
manual and the automated driver. The existence of dual 
driving modes brings two new sources of risk, namely unfair 
transitions and mode confusion. 
We propose to define a safe transition as a transition 
where either a manual mistake or an E/E failure, or 
combination of these, leads to an unfair transition or mode 
confusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate on a system 
example how to allocate safety requirements on system 
elements to ensure safe transitions. 
Results from this example show that it is sufficient to 
allocate safety requirements on the sensor and lock of a 
single lever to ensure safe transitions. No safety 
requirements are needed on visual feedback to the driver, 
e.g., displays. We remark that the example implementation 
by no means is a unique solution to the safe transitions 
problem.
