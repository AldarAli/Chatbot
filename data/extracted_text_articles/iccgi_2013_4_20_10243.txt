Abstract—Immune memory can be regarded as an equilibrium 
state of immune network system with nonlinear dynamical 
behavior. The rapid response of immune systems to the 
secondary antigen is owing to the stable structure of memory 
state forming by a closed idiotypic immune network. Internal 
image of an antigen is defined while memory state is formed 
via such network.  Antibody chain based on tree structure is 
proposed which explains how the memory state is formed in 
the immune network. We also propose a network dynamics 
model of idiotypic immune network based on cross-reactive 
correlation matrix to explain the artificial immune memory.

 INTRODUCTION  
It is well known that the injection of a given amount of 
some antigen into a mammal’s body will stimulate the 
production of antibodies directed against that antigen, if the 
antibody is with a high affinity for that antigen [1]. The 
immune system of the animal has thus learned to produce 
high quantities of the antibody directed against that very 
antigen, which is called vaccinated. Therefore, the biological 
immune system can learn itself and memorize the 
characteristics of invading antigens.  
Memory in a physical system refers to the ability of the 
system to preserve information of its environment at some 
previous time. Memory mechanism of biological immune 
systems is still a mystery. From computational biology 
viewpoints, memory mechanisms in immune systems can be 
regarded some physical systems. There are basically two 
theories to explain the immune memory [1]. The first one is 
the theory of memory cells, which are generated after the B-
cell proliferations. These cells will remain for an immune 
memory in the human body until the death of the individual. 
On the other hand, immune memory mechanisms can be 
explained through Jerne’s immune network theory [2] by 
investigation them as complex adaptive systems. Immune 
memory belongs to a class of sparse and distributed 
associative memory [3]. The concept of artificial immune 
memory is the following. Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) 
have to deal with constant change of environment. Based on 
memory mechanisms, CASs can respond immediately to the 
same or similar environment. Here, we are adopting immune 
memory mechanisms in CASs. According to Fernandez et al. 
[4], it is an ongoing research topic to exploit relationship 
between immune memory and internal image. The internal 
image can be regarded as a portion of immune memory of 
antigen [5]. 
 Immune memory mechanisms can also be modeled from 
immune network theory [2][6]. Jerne also proposed that once 
the foreign antigen is removed, the immune system would 
restore some information of such antigen by some memory 
mechanism. Debates of whether memory cell theory or 
associative property is true have been discussed. The 
immune memory can be explained by the following network 
viewpoint. Assuming that an antibody 
1
Ab  is produced by 
the stimulating antigen. Then the production of 
1
Ab  is 
increased in the presence of another type of antibody 
2
Ab . 
The population of T-helper cell 
1
TH  specified by 
1
Ab  is also 
increased. In this way, 
2
Ab can be considered as some 
"internal image" of this antigen. This image will be remained 
after the antigen is removed. The interactions can be a long 
chain with length greater than 2.  
Many idiotypic network models focus on the interactions 
between antibodies and antigens. The network interactions 
provide dynamical memory mechanism, by keeping the 
concentrations of antibodies, in particular those internal 
images [7]. However, how immune systems recalls similar 
antigen is still unknown. From computations viewpoints, it is 
worthwhile considering state transition, which represents the 
network dynamics of such unfamiliar pathogen. If this 
antigenic state converges, then immune systems gain some 
control and activate some (associative) recall process. 
 The major goal of this paper is to study the associative 
memory based on statistical immunodynamics inspired by 
[8]. This network structure will proved to be major 
contributions to the immune memory mechanism. The 
related research can be referred to Abbattista et al. [9]. The 
arrangement of this paper is as follows. In Section II, some 
preliminary knowledge of immune memory is introduced. In 
Section III, dynamical behavior of idiotypic immune 
network is described. Simulation analysis of immune 
network memory is also given.

BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE 
A. Immune Responses 
 While a specific antigen invades human body, the 
immune system will respond by producing some antibodies, 
which can eliminate this invaded antigen. It has three phases, 
namely, first immune response, second immune response and 
76

cross-reactive response. For the first invaded antigen, the 
immune systems will massively produce the antibody, which 
binds to Ag . Therefore the amount of antigen will be reduced 
tremendously after the peaking and tended to some constant 
value. We can say that immune systems are turned to the 
memory state. For the second phase, the same antigen 
invades and the antibody will take much less time than that 
of first immune response to reach the population peak. 
Therefore this antigen cannot proliferate tremendously. This 
is the reason why we don’t get sick at this stage. On the other 
hand, if a similar antigen invades, then the same antibody   
will also proliferate soon and eliminate population. We will 
analyze the network transitions between each phase. Once 
the first immune response has activated, we are particularly 
interested in the third stage, namely the associate memory 
mechanism for the immune response to similar antigens. 
B. Idiotypic Immune Network 
 Idiotypic network theory implies that immune systems 
will mimic the presence of the antigen even after it is 
destroyed [3]. This way, the antibody and receptor of the 
lymphocytes can recognize each other. The epitope of 
antibody molecule is called an "idiotope". An epitope of 
antigen Ag  is recognized by the antibody molecule 
1
Ab  and 
by the receptor molecule on the lymphocyte of 
1
LU . The 
antibody 
1
Ab  and the receptor of 
1
LU have the idiotope, 
which is recognized by antibody 
2
Ab  and the receptor on 
the lymphocyte of 
2
LU . Continuously, we reach an 
antibody
N
Ab , while the antibody 
1
Ab  and the receptor on 
the lymphocyte of 
LU1
also recognize idiotopes on 
antibody
N
Ab .
AbN
 constitutes an internal image of the 
antigen Ag  (see Figure 1). The idiotypic network theory has 
been proposed as a central aspect of the associative 
properties 
of 
immune 
memory 
[3][10]. 
However, 
computational aspect of this paradigm needs to be further 
explored. 
For simplicity, it is reasonable that we consider 
antibodies rather than LUs of IINs from both network 
dynamics and population dynamics perspectives. Some 
immune network models can be contributed to this antibody 
dynamics such as [11]. Such antigen-antibody interactions 
can be a long sequence structure, namely, an antibody chain, 
which is formerly defined as follows.

It can stimulate the antibody 
1
Ab  even Ag  is eliminated. In 
this way, population of 
1
Ab  will be stable in small amount. 
In particular, its role in immune memory can be analyzed by 
network dynamics. 
C. Immune Memory 
An immune system will react rapidly to the same or 
similar antigens which had invaded the same human body 
before. This phenomenon implies that immune system can 
"memorize" associatively the formations of previously 
invaded antigens. An evidence for immune memory is that it 
is strongly affected by the populations of soluble antibodies 
in the blood. Therefore, some variable quantified the 
immune memory can be correlated to the amount of 
antibodies. In fact, this is a major inspiration for this research, 
but different angle from computational biology. 
The immune memory mechanism is not fully understood 
so far; according to Smith et al. [3], at the end of an immune 
response, when the antigen is cleared, the B cell population 
decreases, leaving a persistent sub-population of memory 
cells. The newer view of memory cells is that they are not 
intrinsically longer-lived than virgin cells, but that memory 
depends instead on the persistence of antigen [12]. However, 
some researches, especially those related to immune network 
theory, imply the immune memory is formed by a cyclic 
idiotypic network rather than specific memory cell [11]. 
Immunologists have discovered the vaccination mechanism 
for human immune systems for a long time. This takes 
advantages of so-called the associative memory of immune 
systems. The associative memory mechanism can be 
explained as follows [13]. If the secondary antigen is 
"similar" to the primary one, the set of antibodies activated 
by this antigen will overlap with the one activated by the 
primary antigen. The similarity between antigens can be 
defined by affinity of molecules. This memory is able to be 
store and recall patterns when immune systems need. 
Associative recall is a general phenomenon of immune 
memory [3].

MAIN RESULTS 
A. Tree Structure of Idiotypic Immune Network 
 Perelson [14] suggested a tree structure with varied 
levels for idiotypic immune networks. Ag  is the root note. 
Level 1 is the collection of all antibodies which are 
complementarily matching with Ag . Level 2 is the 
collection of all antibodies which are complementarily with 
those at level 1. This way, we may construct a tree structure 
for antibody chain (see Figure 2). We also define the directed 
edge → from antibody at higher level to the one at lower 
level. Based on this structure 
}
,
,
={
AC →
A
T
g
, all possible 
internal images for a given antigen can be searched within 
some antibody populations. We also observe the existence of 
internal image can be guaranteed if and only if second level 
is inward and outward according to some affinity relation 
→. The following algorithm is the detailed description for 
the tree constructions for antibody chains.

 satisfies the following properties: 
(1) Each antibody in AC  can be located at most one level; (2) 
The edge can only exist between adjacent level; (3) If AC  is 
closed, then its length is even; (4) If AC  is closed, then 
number of level of T  is equal to N 2 +1 . (5) Internal image 
must locate at the level 2. (6) The internal image exists if and 
only if 
1

(

Level AC
.  
 This is obvious by definition of tree structure. If 
Abi ∈ AC
 is located to Level i of T  and 
Ab → Abi
1
. Then 
i
Ab  has to be located to Level 2. If 
j
i
Ab → Ab
, then 
j
Ab  
must be located at level 
i +1
. If the length of the left AC  is 
equal to m , then the number of level is also m  by the 
closeness of AC . The right AC  is 
N − m
, which is also 
even. However, m  and 
N − m
 must have difference equal 
to 2 by the closeness of AC  and the fact that 
N
Ab  must be 
located at level 2. Therefore the length of AC  is equal to 
m+(m-2)=2m-2 , which must be even. According to (3), N  
must be even. 
N
Ab  and 
2
Ab  are at the level 2; 
AbN −1
 and 
3
Ab  are at the level 3; continuing in this way, 
AbN/2+1
 is the 
unique 
antibody 
located 
the 
level

Therefore Level(AC) = N 2 . 
If an internal image is highly complementary match with 
1
Ab , then it can be regarded as an reasonable stimulus for 
1
Ab  even Ag  is eliminated. 
1
Ab  plays a pivotal role for 
internal image. If the ε  of the ε -complementary match 
between 
1
Ab  and Ag  is higher, then the internal image and 
Ag  are more similar. From mathematical viewpoint, it is 
still a question that Ag  and its internal image may be of low 
similarity.  
The network-layered structure for CIINs provide some 
evidences that the population dynamics cannot provide, such 
as recall process of immune memory. Every closed antibody 
chain 
T(AC)
 can be represented as a k -level tree structure, 
where  k = N 2 +1. Furthermore, internal image 
N
Ab  must 
locate at level 2.

B. Network Dynamics based on Autocorrelation Matrix 
 From immunology viewpoints, a better antibody chain 
has the following two aspects: the first is that it will respond 
fast to the second-time antigenic invasion; the second one is 
that it will act adaptively to the similar antigenic invasion. 
The question is how to build some mathematical model to 
connect the concepts of tree structure with the dynamics of 
immune responses such as immune memory and recall. Most 
importantly, response to a similar antigen rather than second. 
This is related to the associative memory mechanism [15] 
[16]. 
The attractor networks proposed by Morita [17] and 
defined by tree structures can generate a dynamics. It is a 
transition of states represented by nodes of antigens. A 
network dynamics F  can be defined on states of network 
S
 
as follows. An antigen will induce an antibody chain, which 
will generate a network dynamics for interpreting immune 
78

memory formation and recall process. Moreover, this 
attractor network dynamics can interpret the associative 
property of immune memory while population dynamics 
cannot. Let F  be a function defined on state space S . For a 
given state 
S(t)
 at time t , the network dynamics can be 
defined as a transition of state S  from time t  to time 
t +1
, 
namely, S(t+1)=F(S(t)) . According to the basic concept of 
dynamical systems, we may define an attractor µ  of the 
network dynamics F , if there exists a state S  such that 
F n → u
, as 
n → ∞
, where t  is a temporal variable and S  
is the state variable. Now we define the associative memory 
based on stability analysis of equilibrium points (states) of 
such network dynamics.

 which are attractors of the network dynamics 
F , then we say the immune network can memorize p  
patterns of antigens associatively.  
The stable states of immune networks can guarantee that 
if an antigenic format fallen into the basin of attraction of 
k
µ , then by memory recalling process, this antigen can 
invoke the same antibody proliferation immediately. The 
following question arises: what is the mathematical model of 
network dynamics F , if an antigen-antibody chain

(

 is given. We will first concentrate on some 
binary-valued function F  to illustrate the dynamics of 
immune memory, rather than on discussing some complex 
and high-dimensional dynamical systems. 
This mechanism is named autocorrelation matrix 
memory (ACMM) inspired by [17]. For an antigen Ag , 
there exists an antibody chain AC  such that it is a CIIN. 
This AC  will induce a autocorrelation matrix W  as

an antigen activates an antibody chain whose network 
dynamics can generate antigenic memory format. 
C. Associative Memory formed by the Immune Systems 
 How immune memory pertains associativity is still a 
mystery for scientists even for the advances and success of 
vaccinations for more than 300 years. However, we propose 
a network dynamics model to describe this mechanism from 
computational immunology viewpoints. An immune network

 is equipped with with associative memory, if 
for any 
ε > 0
, there exists 
α > 0
, such that whenever a new 
antigen g
A ʹ′ with 
) < α
,
(
d Ag Ag
ʹ′
 implies that 
Ab1
Ag
ʹ′ →ε
. 
If a new antigen 
g
A ʹ′ , which is very similar to the 
previous invaded antigen Ag , invades human body, then the 
antibody 
1
Ab  which binds Ag  can also bind 
g
A ʹ′  and 
invokes another immune response. 
For an antigen Ag  activating the antibody chain AC , the 
network dynamics defined on pattern space for memory 
formation and recall with 
( )
1) =
(
W s t
s t
⋅
+
 must induce 
attractors, where W  is some state transition matrix. This 
means, starting from an initial configuration s  which is 
sufficiently closed to (or overlapped with) one 
i
Ab , the 
system will flow to a fixed point of the dynamics, which is 
either the pattern itself or the configuration with high overlap 
with that pattern. 
Memory Recall Process based on Network Dynamics 
 Once the same or "similar" antigen to Ag  invades 
immune systems again, the memory recall process of the 
immune systems will be activated by comparing the memory 
format generated and stored in the previous antigenic 
invasion of Ag . From system dynamics, we can define such 
similar antigens by basin of attraction. Suppose the same 
antigen Ag  invades the immune systems again, then 
network dynamics F , namely, 
F n (Ag)
 will immediately 
converges to memory format of Ag , say 
M (Ag)
. On the 
other hand, if some similar antigen 
g
A ʹ′  invades, the 
network dynamics 
( g )
F k A
ʹ′  converges to the same 
M (Ag)
 
if 
BA(Ag)
Ag
ʹ′∈
. Therefore, basin of attraction of Ag  is 
the major criterion that 
g
A ʹ′ will activate the 
1
Ab  and the 
same antibody chain.  
The third question we are interested here is the following. 
For a similar antigen 
g
A ʹ′, whether the original antibody 
chain AC  activated by Ag  can also produce immune 
response effectively to this mutated 
g
A ʹ′ ? In this way, the 
immune network reflects a decent associative memory. If the 
internal image 
N
Ab  is similar to Ag , then it is also similar 
to 
g
A ʹ′. If for initial condition 
X (0)
, we have the following 
network dynamics of recall process inspired by [16] and [18].

Figure 3.  Stable Network Dynamics for Immune Memory Recall. 
Figure 3 is a simulation that a particular network 
dynamics activated by a specific antibody chain could recall 
a mutated antigen completely. The parameters are set as 
follows. N=100, the antibody population is 20,000. The 
length of  (randomly generated) antibody chain is N=4.  
IV. 
DISCUSSIONS 
Overlapping difference function shown in Figure 3 is 
stable. However, it is very often that such function is 
unstable for varied parameter values, for example, ε < 0.6 . 
In fact, simulations have shown different unstable behaviors, 
from simple to complex ones. Anyway, Figure 3 shows that 
the mutated antigen Ag'  can invoke the exact memory for 
the original antigen Ag ; and antibody Ab1  can eliminate this 
Ag' . Another issue is the existence of CIINs for invaded 
antigen Ag . If the affinity thresholdε ≥ 0.6 , the simulations 
have also shown that it is generally difficult to form CIINs.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
We proposed an immune memory mechanism, based on 
the closed idiotypic immune network. The latter is analyzed 
by some tree structure. The formation of immune memory 
can be deduced by close loop of the cell’s interactions, in 
particular, by antibody dynamics such as internal image 
recognition. Network dynamics which describes the immune 
memory formation and recall process is modeled based on 
cross-reactive correlation matrix of antibody chains. This 
mechanism is associative by analyzing the state transitions of 
mutated antigens.  
There are some issues for future research. As mentioned 
in Section VI, observation leads to the research of adopting 
weak connection principle to CIINs forming. This is inspired 
by the small-world network structure; it is reasonable that 
antibody-antigen biding should be based on high affinity 
threshold while lower affinity threshold for the antibody-
antibody biding.
