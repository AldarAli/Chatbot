Abstract— In this paper, we use a procedural generation 
system to design urban layouts that passively reduce water 
depth during urban floods. The tool enables designing cities 
that passively lower flood depth everywhere or in chosen key 
areas. Our approach integrates a porosity-based hydraulic 
model and a parameterized urban generation system with an 
optimization engine so as to find the least cost modification to 
an initial urban layout. In order to investigate the relationship 
between urban layout design parameters and flood inundation 
depth, correlation coefficient method is used. This paper 
concludes that the most influential urban layout parameters 
are average road length and the mean parcel area.

design; porosity-based hydraulic model; Pearson correlation;

 INTRODUCTION 
Structural flood controls such as levees, dams, and dikes 
have been widely used to reduce flood impacts. However, 
these structural measures have been criticized because they 
interrupt flooding processes by reducing natural water 
storage capacity and disrupting water flow paths [1] [2]. 
Currently, there is a shift from hard flood controls towards a 
more strategic approach characterized by mitigating flood 
risk and increasing resilience during the urban design process 
[1] [3]. This study uses a procedural generation system, 
proposed by [4], that automatically generates 3D urban 
layouts that consider the influence of geometric urban 
characteristics (e.g., road width, orientation, curvature, etc.) 
on water flow properties during urban flooding. Using this 
system, we explored urban geometric grammars that help 
reduce flooding, i.e., what urban design rules produce a 
passive barrier against natural floods? 
The procedural generation system [4] consists of three 
components. First, it represents an urban area by dividing it 
into cells of 1×1 kilometers. For each cell, the system defines 
a parameterized procedural model that can generate a wide 
range of possible urban layout configurations. Second, a 
porosity-based hydraulic model computes the water flow 
characteristics of a proposed urban layout cell. Third, the 
system approximates the relationship between urban layout 
and flood flow characteristics with a trained neural network. 
The main contribution of this paper is the measurement of a 
statistical 
relationship 
between 
urban 
layout 
design 
parameters and water depth during a flood, which, to our 
knowledge, has not been done before.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
presents our methodology. Section III presents and discusses 
our findings. Section IV gives conclusions and as well as 
suggestions for future study. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY  
Altogether, our procedural model is controlled by a 10-
dimensional parameter vector. These parameters are selected 
according to a literature survey of common parameters 
involved in previous studies [5] [6] [7]. In the following, we 
describe each parameter: 
 average road length (P1) -- the distance between two 
adjacent intersections, 
 road orientation (P2) -- orientation of the initial radially-
outward road relative to lower-left corner, 
 road curvature (P3) -- rotation of a road segment when it 
passes through an intersection, 
 major road width (P4), and  
 minor roads width (P5). 
Parcels are defined based on a recursive subdivision of 
oriented bounding boxes (OBB) fit around each city block as 
in [6]. Parcels are controlled by the following parameters: 
 percentage of parcels selected as parks (P6), and  
 average parcel area (P7). 
Buildings are generated with the following parameters: 
 front (P8),  
 rear (P9), and  
 side (P10) building setbacks. 
Our flooding depth simulations are performed by WOLF 
2D model [8] [9]. Our hydraulic model focuses on river-
based flooding scenarios. 
By means of Pearson correlation, we explore the 
relationship between urban layout design parameters (P1-
P10) and inundation depth. The system randomly generated 
2000 urban layouts with built-up coverage of 20%, 30%, 
40%, and 50% (500 layouts for each built-up coverage).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Although some urban layouts might not be represented 
accurately, the proposed urban generation system supports a

wide variety of typical urban layouts, which enables us to 
effectively find the desired layouts from an otherwise huge 
search space (Figure 1). 
Based on several case studies, our findings highlighted 
that the impact of geometric characteristics of urban patterns 
(e.g., street width, park ratio, etc.) on flow properties during 
urban floods is significant. This is especially important for 
accurate flood/water simulations and for city planners 
concerned with flooding. Our approach can reduce water 
depth by proposing layout changes during the design phase 
of an urban space. Figure 2 (top) demonstrates that our 
system reduced flood inundation depth by about 6% keeping 
the same build-up coverage. Moreover, we can increase 
built-up coverage and keep the same inundation depth 
(Figure 2-bottom). This is done by only reconfiguring urban 
layout design without any additional flood controls. The 
computed water depths are minimum at the downstream 
faces and maximum at the upstream faces, because of the 
overall flow resistance induced by the buildings.  
Figure 3 shows the Pearson correlation analysis for the 
relationship between urban layout parameters and flood 
inundation depth. The Pearson correlation value ranges from 
-1 for a perfect negative linear relationship to +1 for a perfect 
positive linear relationship. The value 0 indicates no linear 
relationship. The results reveal that P1 (average road length) 
shows the strongest relationship with inundation depth.

This relation is positive implying that the inundation 
depth increases by increasing the average road length.

P7, P8, P9, and P10 (average parcel area, front, rear, and 
side building setbacks respectively) have a strong negative 
relation with inundation depth. The rest of the variables (P2, 
P3, P4, P5, and P6) show a weak relation with inundation 
depth. More importantly, the relation between each variable 
and inundation depth varies based on the built-up coverage. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper used an automatic design approach for urban 
procedural modeling coupled with a hydraulic model to 
investigate the relation between urban layout design and 
flood inundation depth. We systematically explored the 
inundation flow in quasi-realistic urbanized areas, which 
links hydraulic modeling results with parameters of direct 
significance for urban planning. Based on porosity-based 
hydraulic computations of inundation flow for a set of 2000 
different urban layouts, the relative influence of ten urban 
layout parameters (average street length, street orientation 
and curvature, major and minor street widths, mean parcel 
area, rear and side building setbacks and building coverage) 
on flood inundation depths were assessed. We found that the 
most influential urban layout parameters were average road 
length, the mean parcel area, and the building side-setbacks. 
This work helps with providing guidelines for urban planners 
to design flood-resilient cities.  
An important next step in the research is the analysis of 
real-world case studies, which would showcase the 
operationality of our system and therefore increase the 
impact of this assessment tool for urban planning practice.
