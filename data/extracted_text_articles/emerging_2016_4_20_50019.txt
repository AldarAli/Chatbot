Abstract— This paper describes energy conservation measures 
(ECMs) for building energy efficiency improvement and 
presents a method and process of economic impact analysis of 
ECMs in terms of energy and cost savings. ECMs have various 
measures including operation and maintenance improvements, 
retrofit activities or renewable energy sources. Most of these 
measures need investment expense
for installation or 
replacement of facilities. Thus, it is not easy for building 
owners and energy managers to figure out the detailed cost 
saving and the payback period. To analyze economic impacts, 
this paper simulates the energy and cost savings, greenhouse 
gas emission reduction and payback period and examines the 
simulation results to verify the effects of ECMs. 
Keywords- energy conservation measure; energy saving; 
energy efficiency improvement.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Buildings consume almost 35% of total energy in the 
world and building owners spend around 30% of their budget 
on energy [4][5]. Buildings take up a major share of world 
energy consumptions, hence energy savings in buildings can 
lead to both great cost savings and enormous greenhouse gas 
emission reductions. Much of this energy use can be safely 
reduced with proper energy conservation measures (ECMs).
ECMs are to improve the energy efficiency of buildings
including roof and windows, heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning (HVAC), utility systems, and renewable energy 
systems. The aims of ECM are to reduce building energy 
consumptions to
save energy cost, and mitigate the 
greenhouse gas emissions.
To reduce building energy consumptions in a cost-
effective manner, ECMs have three main approaches : 
energy efficiency improvement, operating time reduction and 
renewable 
energy 
adoption. 
The 
energy 
efficiency 
improvement approach is to improve energy efficiency by 
installing new facilities, replacing or upgrading existing ones. 
The operating time reduction approach is to control the 
facilities by using monitoring and control including accurate 
set points and occupancy monitoring. The other approach 
introduces renewable energy sources like solar, natural gas
and wind energy, which substitute for conventional energy 
resulting in energy cost saving and greenhouse gas emissions
reduction.  
However, it is not easy for building owners and energy 
managers to estimate the economic benefits of ECM before 
implementation and to evaluate actual energy savings after 
implementation. Recent researches in the field of energy 
efficiency focus on simulation tools based on database [1-4]
and standards [6]-[8]. This paper presents a method and 
process to analyze the economic impacts of ECM such as 
energy and cost savings, CO2 emission reduction and 
payback period. In this paper, we first present how to analyze
the economic impacts of ECM in Section II. Afterwards, we 
describe an economic analysis tool to calculate the economic 
impacts and discuss how to use the analysis results in Section
III. Finally we conclude this paper in Section IV.
II.
ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
Economic impact analysis is necessary for building 
owners and energy managers to evaluate the benefits of 
ECM, which is one of the most important issues before and 
after ECMs implementations. The benefits of ECMs need to 
be analyzed in terms of energy saving and non-energy 
savings including CO2 reduction. Thus, the energy and cost 
savings, CO2 reduction and payback period need to be 
analyzed in ECM planning phase and evaluation phase after 
implementation. 
A. Energy Saving
Energy saving is determined by comparing energy uses
before and after ECM implementation. To estimate energy 
saving, baseline energy 
Ebase
is defined as the amount of 
the energy that would be consumed without ECM 
implementation and post installation energy
E post
as the 
estimated or measured energy use after the implementation
[5-7]. Then, the energy saving 
Esave
is given by summation 
of monthly energy savings as follow.

On the other hand, the energy saving of each ECM can also 
be estimated. We describe three kinds of ECMs as 
examples: outer wall, variable air volume (VAV), and solar 
energy. Table I presents symbols and units of variables 
related to the ECMs.

SIMULATION
A. Enoomic Analysis Tool
To examine the economic impacts of ECM, we set up an
economic analysis tool as shown in Fig. 1. The tool consists 
of input block, output block, database and ECM impact 
analysis block. The input block is to enter information on the 
building to be analyzed including building attributes, energy 
use and monitoring-based commissioning (MBCx). The 
baseline energy is determined from the energy use, which is 
usually performed on an annual basis. The database consists 
of the information on ECMs, weather, energy price, 
measurement and verification (M&V) results, etc.

The analysis block calculates the economic impacts 
including energy and cost savings, CO2 reduction and 
payback period. The output block then displays, saves, or 
prints out the analysis results.
Figure 2. Combo box for detailed measure selection 
Fig. 2 shows an example of detailed measure selection of 
ECM. The tool prepares a lot of typical measures in the 
ECM database for building owners and energy managers to 
simply select detailed measures and analyze their economic 
impacts. 
B.
Simulation Results 
We carried out some simulations to examine the 
economic impacts of ECM. Simulation results can be 
represented in various forms. Fig. 3 shows the energy saving 
by comparing post installation energy and adjusted baseline 
energy. We assumed the baseline energy as the monthly
energy use in the last year and the adjusted baseline energy is 
increased by almost 2.5 % every year after implementation. 
The post installation energy is obtained by subtracting the 
estimated energy saving from the adjusted baseline energy in 
planning phase or obtained by measurement after 
implementation. 
Table II summarizes the annual economic impact 
analysis results of ECM, which represents energy and cost 
savings, CO2 reduction, and payback period. It can help the 
building owners and energy managers determine appropriate 
ECMs and implementation schedule.

Table III shows the monthly energy savings in the first 
year. Much of energy is used in winter and summer. From 
the table, we can estimate the effect of user habitat, weather, 
building use and occupancy and need to examine the 
efficiency of HVAC and thermal transmittance of the outer 
wall and roof. Fig. 4 shows the monthly energy consumption 
categories in the first year after implementation. From the 
figure, we can see which categories consume how much 
energy and which categories should be improved. 
The economic impacts can be examined through M&V 
activities that are to verify operation of the installed 
equipment and systems.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, a method and process to analyze economic 
impacts of ECM have been presented, which can help build 
owners, energy managers and facility managers plan ECM 
strategy. ECMs can save building energy so that building 
owners can reduce building energy cost and mitigate 
greenhouse gas emission. For building owners, the economic 
impact analysis is one of the most important issues since they 
spend around 30% of their budget on energy. However, it is 
difficult for a non-expert to select proper ECMs for one’s 
buildings and to estimate economic benefits of ECMs. By 
proper ECMs much of building energy can be reduced, 
which leads to not only great cost saving but also enormous
greenhouse gas reduction. 
To analyze economic impacts, this paper set up an
economic analysis tool and carried out simulations on energy 
and cost savings, CO2 emission reduction and payback 
period. The analysis results can be used for planning and 
evaluating ECM implementation. The energy saving is 
determined by comparing baseline energy and post
installation energy. In ECM planning phase, it needs to 
estimate post installment energy by using an appropriate
algorithm to calculate energy saving of each ECM. After 
implementation, baseline energy is adjusted to compensate 
for the condition changes including weather, occupancy and 
activities and the impacts of ECM can be examined through 
M&V activities. 
Further studies are needed to establish a reliable database 
for ECMs and verify the economic impact analysis results of
various buildings.
