Abstract—
Scheduling
shifts
is
a
tiresome
and
time
consuming task in any business, and particularly in hospitals
where errors are costly, rules are plentiful and changes are
rapid. The person performing this function (Rota Organizer)
will have to keep track of all the employees concerned,
distributing hours fairly and avoiding collisions. Rules
regulating working hours and breaks have to be followed
and the qualifications of individual employees need to be
considered. Hours are spent every day on this task in every
ward. The goal of this paper is to solve Doctors Scheduling
Problem (DSP) and initialize a fair roster for two wards of
Pediatric
Department
(PD)
in
Prince
Sultan
Military
Medical City (PSMMC) in Saudi Arabia. So, to find a
solution to DSP, we used Graph Coloring which is one of the
methods mostly used to solve this problem.
Keywords- graph coloring; doctors roster; greedy algorithm.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In the study of graphs, which are mathematical
structures used to model pair wise relations between
objects, a “graph” is made up of vertices (or nodes) and
lines, called edges, that connect them.
Graphs can be used to model many types of relations
and
processes
in
physical,
biological,
social
and
information systems. Graph coloring has been studied
extensively for the past decades. The surge for studying
graph coloring in recent times has resulted in countless
real-life problem applications, which include scheduling
problems. The research presented in this paper aims to
provide
an
effective
procedure
for
solving
Doctors
Scheduling Problem (DSP) related to their shifts. DSP is a
major problem faced by many hospitals all over the world.
We tried in two wards of PSMMC to establish a roster for
one month as a beginning to achieve a general procedure
for every month. After exploring relevant references, the
problem will be described in detail, followed by the
formulation of the relevant coloring problem and its
solution with recent results.

RELATED WORK
Nurses' rostering problem has been studied in the
literature by many researchers, for example [1] [4] [6].
Kumara et al. [6] used graph coloring for scheduling with
a
specific
different
algorithm
(other
than
greedy
algorithm). [1] [4] used graph coloring to make the
schedule by greedy algorithm, but for a few number of
nurses. In this paper graph coloring is used to solve
doctors' scheduling problem (DSP) related to their shifts
for one month in two wards of PSMMC. Realizing that
establishing a general procedure to create a roster for every
month has not been done yet for any hospitals in Saudi
Arabia, this work might lead to a follow up by more
research. For the advantages of this procedure to be clear,
a needed comparison will be done.
III.
STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
In this paper, we consider a scheduling problem for
Pediatric Department of Prince Sultan Military Medical
City (PSMMC) in Riyadh/ Saudi Arabia. It is considered
one of the top governmental hospitals with almost twenty
seven departments. There are more than five thousand
doctors in the hospital. We communicated with Dr. Nawaf
Al khayat (Dr.N.A.,) in PD of PSMMIC; he is a consultant
and supervisor of resident doctors training in PSMMIC.
Usually, monthly doctors roster are made manually
before the end of each month. Rota organizer has the
responsibility to publish next month's roster. Even though
making monthly rosters manually requires great effort, it
does not resolve all conflicts. Instead, it has created more
tedious adjustments to accomplish needed tasks. There are
consultants, senior and junior doctors working in this
department. This paper is concerned with scheduling shifts
for junior and senior doctors in two of the department
wards for one month only.
There are three types of doctors: Consultants, Seniors
(R3 & R4) and Juniors (R1 & R2), where the number
indicates trainee year. In PSMMC pediatric department,
which has thirteen wards, there are thirty eight resident
doctors; R1, R2, R3 and R4. It has been specified for us to
work on scheduling shifts for only two wards: PG
(Pediatrics General) and PGICU (Pediatrics General
Intensive Care Unit) wards. In addition, we were given the
following information:
1.
Each working day consists of eight to eight and
half hours.
2. Each shift consists of twenty four hours.
3. Every doctor who has participated in a shift will not
be given anther shift for the next three days.
4. There are twenty two junior and sixteen senior
doctors.
5. In each working month, there are doctors who are

excluded from participating in shifts due to other
responsibilities or personal circumstances.
We chose September 2016 to be the month we
consider for scheduling. In September, only eighteen
doctors are excluded which is the least number of doctors,
compared with the remaining months. From the list of
names given to us by Dr.N.A., we have listed doctors who
will participate in September shifts (S.S.). There are
twelve juniors and eight seniors available. In the proposed
solution for DSP (Doctors Scheduling Problem), we need
to assign doctors to shifts.
IV.
FORMULATION OF A GRAPH COLORING
PROBLEM
First, we divided the doctors into four shift groups.
Each group has two seniors and four juniors, based on
department daily requirement, and the fact that we only
have twelve juniors and eight seniors in this month. Since
both PG and PGICU involved doctors cannot accomplish
needed shifts while meeting restrictions of the department,
we had several options.
We chose to involve one doctor outside PG and
PGICU, each day of September to complement needed
shifts. So we had A, B, C and D groups to cover first four
consecutive days which will represent the same groups for
the following four days, and so on. This implies a need for
additional four juniors {SUB.1, SUB.2, SUB.3, SUB.4},
(SUB.1 refer to first substitute for a junior), to complement
the required number of doctors (8 seniors and 16 juniors in
condition 3 above).

By using above data, an incident matrix is initiated
for S.S.D. It is a 24 × 24 matrix. If any two doctors are in
same group then ij-th entry is 1 otherwise it is 0. Now,
since the incident matrix is a big matrix, we had to divide
it into 4 submatrices (blocks) which include all nonzero
entries (for the sake of presenting results in appropriate
template).

green. We needed six colors, so the last color is going to
be blue.
Now we will start with vertices representing seniors;
first senior of each day will be colored in red. The second
senior adjacent to the first one will be colored yellow.
Since every day there are four juniors adjacent to each
other and to the red and yellow seniors, the first one of
these juniors every day will be colored gray, the second
one is orange, third one is green, and last one is blue. See
Figure 1. Above, we have included substitutes in the
coloring scheme to organize needed shifts. This means the
first day group will be repeated in fifth day, second group
will be repeated in sixth day, third group will be repeated
in seventh day and fourth group will be repeated in eighth
day. So, to finish up the process the cycle will be repeated
every four days.

Accordingly, we formulated a table where S.S.D.
doctors in G1,G2,…, G6 should be in the same ward if
they are in the same group. Based on restrictions specified
in Section 4 concerning the problem of making doctors
roster for September 2016 in PD of PSMMC, we have
divided doctors into shift groups.
Then, we applied the graph theory to these groups so
that each vertex represents a doctor and there is an edge
between any two doctors in one shift group, see section 3.1
for details.
After graphing, we used Greedy Algorithm to color. We
used six colors for twenty four vertices, where each four
vertices have one color.
In the graph, doctors represented by vertices of the same
color are grouped as one since they will be working in the
same ward. The shift groups (Table I) are then used to form
a
matrix. The elements of first columns represent
numbering of doctors and element of second column
represent colors of these doctors which are numbering like
that (1 is red, 2 is yellow, 3 is gray, 4 is orange, 5 is green
and 6 is blue). We used this matrix to create code by
Matlab. The output of this code is distribution in the wards.
V.
RESULTS
Table III shows the first phase of result: distribution of
doctors in wards. We note that each element represents the
participation of a specific doctor in a shift, i.e.,

In this paper, we have finalized a roster for September
2016 shifts of two wards PG and PGICU in PD of PSMMC.
This roster has taken into consideration departmental
restrictions. In doing so, we are hoping to have saved PG
and PGICU from getting into misunderstandings, as well as
any other relevant troubles. Instead of wasting time and
effort to generate doctors roster, the staff can concentrate on
other important medical duties.
At the end, we can confirm that steps leading to a roster
of September 2016, as detailed in Section 4, can be used and
applied for other months, and for nurses, as well as doctors.

FUTURE WORK
Many hospitals take a long time to prepare a doctors
roster which is fair to everybody. Instead of wasting time
in generating it, we hope to generalize in future work a
software, where minimum data is required to have a roster
for any month.
