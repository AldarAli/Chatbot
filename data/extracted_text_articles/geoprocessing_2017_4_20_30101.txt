Abstract—Understanding the needs of tourists is important for
many areas of tourism. Travel diaries, which include geotagged
photos, are becoming popular tools to collect and analyze tourist
behavior. We developed a travel diary generating/printing system
called KaDiary, which can generate a digital travel diary from
geotagged photos taken by tourists, and print the digital travel
diary using a printer. This paper describes the development of
the KaDiary, the effectiveness of the system and the experiments,
which extract tourist behavior from travel diaries on Shodo
Island. Results of the experiments identiﬁed attractive tourist
spots, travel times, including the start times and end times of
travel, as well as identiﬁed popular travel routes on the island.
Keywords–Travel diary; Extract tourists’ behavior; Geotagged
photo.

INTRODUCTION
Recalling and sharing travel experiences is an important
factor for tourism and can inspire tourists to revisit previous
locations or invite new tourists to visit travel spots. Collecting
and analyzing tourist behavior using geotagged photos has
recently attracted a lot of attention and is important to un-
derstanding the needs of tourists. By counting the number of
photos taken in tourist spots and plotting them to a map using
geographical information, we can identify tourist behaviors and
easily distinguish which tourist spots are attractive. Of course
we can discover the interests of tourists by simply looking
at the photos, however, a travel diary using geotagged photos
has more advantages because it focuses on the information of
tourists as well as the photos. To utilize this information, we
developed a travel diary generating/printing system called the
KaDiary. The KaDiary generates digital travel diaries (Web-
formatted or PDF-formatted) using photos taken by tourists
and comments that are given to photos, and prints the digital
travel diary using a printer. The travel diary consists of photos,
comments, travel behaviors including when and where the
tourists visited, the order of tourism spots visited by tourists
and the time spent on tourism. Photos and comments are
selected using mobile devices by tourists. Travel behaviors
are extracted from Exchangeable Image File Formats (EXIF),
which are applied to photos. There are many beneﬁts from
using our system: (1) Tourists can look back on their ex-
perience using a printed travel diary. (2) Tourists can share
the digital travel diary with other tourists via the Internet and
social media. (3) We can obtain valuable information regarding
travel behaviors. This paper describes the development of
the KaDiary and conﬁrms the system’s effectiveness through
experiments conducted to extract tourist behavior on Shodo
Island. From the travel diaries we were able to identify the
most attractive tourist spots, tourists’ travel time, start time of
travel, end time of travel and the most popular travel routes
on Shodo Island.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
related work. Section III describes the development of the
KaDiary. Section IV describes the experiment design. Section
V describes the result of the analysis. Section VI describes our
conclusion and future works.

RELATED WORK
Travel behaviors have been recorded for centuries. How-
ever, with the popularization of mobile apps and the Internet,
travel diaries have become valuable sources of information.
Greaves et al.[1] developed and deployed an online seven
day travel/activity diary and companion smartphone app to
investigate changes in travel behavior and health indicators
of residents before and after the construction of a major piece
of cycling infrastructure. The smartphone app, which records
travel routes on a map can improve both the recall of trips
and the accuracy of trip reporting. Saﬁ et al.[2] designed and
implemented a smartphone-based travel survey system. Their
system provides users with more convenient procedure for
recalling and reporting their travel behavior. Our system not
only provides a digital travel diary, but can also print travel
diaries using a printer. Tourists can access the system using a
general camera application and web browser available on most
mobile devices without installing a special application.
With the increasing of Global Positioning System (GPS)
equipped devices, such as smartphones and tablets, most of
photos are having geographical information, which has led
to many research projects. Vu et al.[3] explored the activities

of park visitors in Hong Kong using geotagged photos. They
extracted photo locations and photo textual information such as
user proﬁles, photo titles, user-deﬁned photo tags, and content
descriptions using text processing, to analyze visitor activity.
Kurashima et al.[4] recommended travel route using geotagged
photos. They assumed that the collection of each photogra-
pher’s geotagged photos was a sequence of visited locations,
and generated travel routes based on that information. Given
that travel information is important for understanding tourist
behavior, we tried to extract tourist activities and travel routes
from geotagged photos as well.
However, contrary to existing approaches, our system does
not require the installation of a special application. Tourists can
make travel diaries by taking photos using a general camera
application and upload them through a web browser. The
system not only creates a digital travel diary, but can also print
the travel diary for future recollection and generate a database
for tourist behaviors.
III.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE KADIARY
This section describes the development of the KaDiary.
Section A describes an overview of the system. Section B
describes the workﬂow of the system.
A. System Overview
We developed the KaDiary as a Web application giving
tourists the ability to run it on a PC or a mobile device without
having to install a special application. Also, we developed the
KaDiary using Microsoft Azure[5], which is Cloud Computing
Platform that it can be used from any tourist spots. Figure. 1
shows an overview of the KaDiary. The KaDiary includes a
transmitting application, a travel diary making application, a
print cloud and a printer.

The transmitting application has an input function and a
transmitting function. The input function allows the user to
input a title for the travel diary and add photos and comments
for each photo. In order to reduce user anxiety, titles and
comments are not necessary to print a diary, however, if
no title is detected, the system generates a generic title, for
example, “ Shodo Island Travel Diary ”. The transmitting
function transmits the title, photos and comments to the travel
diary making application.
The travel diary making application creates a digital travel
diary as a Web ﬁle or a PDF ﬁle from the title, photos and
comments. The application consists of an extract function, a
generating function (Web and PDF) and a registration function.
The extract function analyzes the exchangeable image ﬁle
format (EXIF) and extracts the latitude and longitude as well
as the date and time, of each photo. Table I shows an example
of EXIF information. The latitude, longitude, date and time
in the table can be used for extracting travel behaviors and
valuable information about tourism such what are the most
popular tourist spots and when’s best season to visit. The
Web generating function creates a Web formatted travel diary.

However, before generating a Web travel diary, the function
edits photos to ensure same size printing on paper. After
photo editing, the function generates a Web travel diary using
latitude, longitude, date, time and Google Maps APIs[6]. Using
Google Maps APIs, the function can extract the order of tourist
spots visited as a travel route, and display them on a map,
which is also included in the Web travel diary as long as each
photo contains geographical information, otherwise the travel
route will not appear. The Web travel diary can also be shared
with other tourists through the Internet.
The PDF generating function creates a PDF formatted
travel diary from the Web travel diary. By generating a PDF
travel diary, the application can upload it to a print cloud,
which is mentioned below. The registration function registers
the EXIF information, comments, title, Web travel diary and
the PDF travel diary to a database, which can be used analyze
tourist behavior.
The PDF travel diary is registered and saved as a print
job in print cloud, and tourists can print it using any printer
with print cloud capabilities. Moreover, tourists can print their
travel diary without installing speciﬁc printer drivers, making
it possible to use their own devices.
Figure. 2, 3 and 4 show example pages of a travel diary.
Figure. 2 shows an example of a cover page, which includes
a map, title, travel date, travel time and travel distance. On
the map, there are pins and lines. The pins, ordered in
chronological order from A to G, represent locations where
the photos were taken using latitude and longitude. The lines
represent the travel route from pin to pin. The title is taken
from the transmitting application. The travel date is extracted
from the date of ﬁrst photo taken at the beginning of travel. The
travel time is the difference between the time of the ﬁrst photo
and last photo taken at the end of travel. The travel distance
is automatically calculated from the travel route on the map
using Google Maps APIs. Figure. 3 shows an example of a
main page. It includes the travel title, travel date, travel time,
photos and comments. Photos and comments are uploaded by
tourists using the transmitting application. Figure. 4 shows an
example of an outline page. It includes a small map, title,
travel date, travel time, travel distance and photos. This page
is generated based on the idea that some tourists want to see
the map and photos on a sheet of paper.
B. Workﬂow of the KaDiary
The following shows the workﬂow of the KaDiary.
1)
Input the title, photos and comments by using the
input function of the transmitting application and
transmit them to the travel diary making application
from tourist’s device.
2)
Extract latitude, longitude, date and time from photos
using the extract function of travel diary making
application.
3)
Generate a Web travel diary with a title, photos,
comments, latitude, longitude, date, time and Google
Maps APIs using the Web generating function.
4)
Generate a PDF travel diary from the Web travel diary
using the PDF generating function.
5)
Register the EXIF information of photos, comments,
title, Web travel diary and the travel diary to a
database using the registration function.

EXPERIMENT DESIGN
We conducted experiments to conﬁrm the effectiveness of
the system on Shodo Island. Shodo Island is one of the many
islands located in the Seto Inland sea of Japan. The number of
tourists who visited Shodo Island were 1,044 in 2003[7]. We
added some limitations to the KaDiary system to ensure easy
and quick use of the system during peak travel times: First, we
limited the number of photos to 9 as tourists often take many
photos in tourist spots, and may upload plenty of photos to the
system reducing the time to print a diary. Second, we limited
the paper size of the diary to A4 only, in order to provide a
handy travel diary for tourists. Third, we limited the number
of pages to 3, in order to further reduce the time to print a
diary.
Finally, we put the Printer, with print cloud capabilities,
in a leisure facility. Tourists could upload the photos from
anywhere using KaDiary, but could print the diary at the leisure
facility only. These experiments were conducted on Oct 21,
22, 23, 29, 30, Nov 5 and 6, 2016 on Shodo Island and
tourists could obtain a printed travel diary and digital travel

RESULT ANALYSIS
The experiments yielded many photos and diaries. Table II
shows the number of diaries and photos, which were extracted
by KaDiary. There were a total of 71 diaries of which 18 were
route available and a total of 492 photos of which 207 were
geotagged.
Figure. 6 shows the location of photos taken on Shodo
Island. Many photos were taken in the same places and were
focused in the southern part of Shodo Island, making it very
useful for identifying attractive tourist spots. Figure. 7 shows
the number of travels per travel time. The highest number
of tourists was found between 2:00 to 5:00 hours. These
results mean that tourists can travel to popular spots in one
day without the need to use accommodations on the island.
Figure. 8 shows the number of photos per time zone. The
highest numbers of photos were taken around noon, leading
us to believe that most tourists came to the island around 8:00
am and left the island around 5:00 pm. Figure. 9 shows the
travel routes for Shodo Island. This map is includes all the
travel routes, which appeared on the diaries. The darker lines
are routes more traveled by tourists while the lighter lines are
routes less traveled. This map allows us to identify popular

This system uses the cloud environment and thus can be used
in other tourist spots. There are many beneﬁts to using our
system: (1) Tourists can look back on their experience. (2)
Tourists can share their digital travel diary with other tourists.
(3) We can obtain valuable information about tourism in order
to learn about travel behaviors. The KaDiary has a transmitting
application, a travel diary making application, a print cloud and
a printer. The transmitting application runs on devices used by
a tourist and can upload selected photos and input titles as well

as comments. The travel diary making application can generate
digital travel diaries (Web-formatted and PDF formatted) using
EXIF data and Google Maps APIs. Tourists can print their own
travel diary without installing speciﬁc printer drivers using a
printer with print cloud capabilities. The results of experiments
conducted on Shodo Island show that we can identify attractive
tourist spots, travel times, including the start times and end
times of travel, as well as identify popular travel routes on the
island. Comments from tourists who used the KaDiary, were
very positive, for example“I am surprised about the accuracy
of the travel route. ”and“ It is nice to have a paper to look
back on my travel. ”
In the future we are planning to implement more functions
to enhance tourist satisfaction and extract more information:
1)
On Shodo Island there are some indoor tourist spots
where GPS signals are unavailable. Therefore, it is
necessary to include a function that automatically
adds geographical information to photos using image
processing.
2)
Tourists could not change the layout of the travel
diary. Therefore it is necessary to include a function
to allow tourists to change the layout of their travel
diary.
3)
Some tourists took a long time selecting photos.
Therefore, it is necessary to include a function that
can identify photos tourists want to select, and gener-
ate travel diaries automatically from identiﬁed photos.
