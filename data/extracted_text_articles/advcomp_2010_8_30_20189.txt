Abstract
 
Residue number system is a carry free and non-
weighted number system. This system is appropriate for 
applications that require fast arithmetic computation. Residue 
Number System is defined by a moduli set. Selecting the 
moduli set is an important issue in this number system. Each 
number in this system is represented by its remainders in 
moduli set, so it introduces smaller numbers than conventional 
systems, which results in fast calculation and low power 
consumption. Multi Valued Logic increases the dynamic range 
by using same positions rather than binary logic. One Hot 
Residue Number System is a method, which reduces the delay 
of arithmetic computations such as addition and multiplication 
to just one transistor delay. In this paper, a new adder circuit 
is introduced for modulo (rn-1) by combining One Hot Residue 
Number system and Multi Valued Logic, which has significant 
improvement in terms of number of applied transistors and 
power consumption in comparison to the ordinary One Hot 
Residue Number System with Multi Valued Logic.

INTRODUCTION  
Some applications such as digital signal processing 
require fast computation with low power consumption.  
Residue Number System (RNS) satisfies these requirements 
by presenting a weighted number into smaller numbers with 
carry-free property, which results in parallel arithmetic 
operation [1][3]. One of the most efficient methods to 
achieve parallelism in arithmetic computation in VLSI 
digital systems is applying RNS. VLSI digital systems can 
be designed with smaller chip area, lower power 
consumption and more speed using RNS rather than 
conventional numeric systems. 
Each RNS is based on moduli set, which consists of a set 
of relatively prime integers. 
One of the most applied modulo in moduli sets is 
(
1)
ba
. Some well-known moduli sets which use this 
modulo are                                    , 
 
                                            , etc. 
In this paper, an adder circuit for modulo (
1)
n
r
 
is 
proposed, which has high speed and low power 
consumption. One Hot RNS (OHRNS) is a method that has 
lowest delay for addition and multiplication operations in 
RNS moduli. Since applying OHRNS is normally associated 
with using of Multi Valued Logic (MVL) and large number 
of transistors, so the VLSI circuit design based on OHRNS 
requires high power consumption and large area. The 
designed circuit in this paper decreases the number of 
transistors, which decreases power consumption, area and 
delay-power product (DP-product) significantly in OHRNS 
for (

nr
modulo adder. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follow: Section II 
describes the necessary background. The proposed circuit is 
discussed in Section III. Sections IV and V contain the 
performance evaluation and conclusion respectively.

B. Multi Valued Logic 
Another important feature of RNS is an alternative 
named multiple valued logic (MVL) that despite of binary 
system which is limited to just two possible logic states, the 
number of discrete signal values or logic states extends 
beyond two. Using MVL can result in more effective usage 
of silicon resource and circuit interconnections [2]. 
Therefore, by defining r levels for MVL each position has 
one of the (0,1,....,
1)
r
 
levels. The value of each position 
in r-level MVL is
ir , where i indicates each position. For a 
given number 
1
0
(
......
)
A an
a
 
the values of its digits are as 
shown in Fig. 1.  
Since by using high radix in MVL much more 
information can be stored in each location in compare with 
binary logic, so  
speed of arithmetic computations is 
increased in this logic that has advantages of  reduction of  
chip area, interconnections and increasing of chip 
performance.  
C. One Hot RNS(OHRNS) 
Power consumption is one of the most important factors, 
which is considered in designing the VLSI circuit. Many 
techniques have been proposed to decrease the power 
consumption. In many cases decreasing the power 
consumption results in reduced circuit performance, 
Therefore designers have focused on circuit design 
considering a more important factor is called Delay-Power 
product (DP product). 
In one-hot, remainders of each modulo 
i
m
 
(0,1,...,
1)
i
m
 
are represented by a separated line as shown in Fig. 2, where 
in each moment just one line that is equal to
ix , a remainder 
of 
i
m modulo, is active and others are inactive. By changing 
the input value, the amount of two lines changes at 
maximum level. Therefore the wasting of power is at 
minimum level. 
OHRNS makes this ability to do arithmetic computations 
such as addition, subtraction and multiplication rapidly and 
based on barrel shifters. OHRNS structure can be 
represented by a state machine.

Figure 3. Representation of OHRNS as a state machine   
For example for addition in OHRNS there are two 
operands, which one of them can be considered as the 
current state of machine and second operand is a shifter that 
shifts the first operand to the correct output as the final 
result. As an example, OHRNS state machine for addition in 
modulo 3 is illustrated in Fig. 3.  
Structure of a computational OHRNS for each operation 
in modulo 
i
m
 
has been shown in Fig. 4. It has two series of 
inputs, which are actually two required operands for addition 
operation. One of them is applied as a shifter and another as 
a data that must be shifted. In this architecture, transistors 
play the role of a shifter. More details about this structure 
have been introduced in [9]. Since modulo (rn-1) is widely 
used in moduli sets in RNS, an adder for this modulo based 
on OHRNS has been designed.  
According to above expressions and considering the 
details of this structure in [9], for adding two numbers in 
modulo (rn-1), the required transistors are equal to (rn-1)2. 
However, the delay of this circuit is equal to just one 
transistor delay. In next section, a method is proposed, 
which decreases the number of applied transistors 
considerably. Furthermore, our proposed circuit handles the 
problem of previous work about OHRNS in which the 
circuit may encounter the fault and incorrect output due to 
the using of same unit for producing the addition result and 
carry-out digit.

are defined as well as

definition A and B have two low and high significant parts. 
Therefore, to add numbers in modulo (rn-1) the adding 
method in conventional systems is used in which for adding 
two n-digits  numbers all digits with same position are 
added together from least significant position to most 
significant position and the carry is added with the digits in 
next position. But the carry digit, which is obtained from 
adding most significant digits, must be added to the resulted 
number. So, to add A and B numbers the operation is 
performed as shown in fig. 5, where C is the result of adding 
A and B in modulo (rn-1). The proposed circuit for (rn-1) 
modulo adder is implemented by an OHRNS structure as 
shown in Fig. 6.

According to Fig. 6, addition operation once requires 
carry propagation from low significant part to high 
significant part and in next step from high significant part to 
low significant part. The carry in each step is obtained by 
one Hot for carry unit, which has a structure same to the 
One Hot adder unit. In spite of previous papers about 
OHRNS that each One Hot transistor is connected to two 
outputs, one for carry and another for the result of addition, 
we do not apply such method because coupling all output 
results together makes this problem that when value of an 
output is equal to one, the value of carry digit will be one 
even if its previous value is zero and it means an incorrect 
result. Therefore, to avoid such problem a separated One 
Hot unit is used to produce carry digits. 
In this implementation for adding each part of two numbers 
as well as Fig. 5 a One Hot adder and a One Hot for carry 
units are used. Since the carry digit is equal to one or zero so, 
two lines of transistors are used to add it to the next part as 
shown in fig. 6.a. But as it can be observed in fig. 6.b for 
obtaining 
1
C
 
no One-Hot for carry unit is used because in 
modulo (rn-1) the carry digit is just added once to the 
resulted number. So, it is ignored in the last part of the 
circuit.

To make a comparison between conventional OHRNS 
and proposed method, the number of applied transistors is 
calculated for r=3 and different values for n. The results have 
been illustrated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. According to the results 
a significant reduction in applied transistors can be observed 
by using this method for modulo (rn-1). The delay of this 
circuit is just equal to the delay of four transistors.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, the proposed OHRNS adder is compared 
with conventional OHRNS adder in terms of propagation 
delay and number of used transistors. In ordinary OHRNS 
for adding two numbers in a given modulo m, the required 
transistors are equal to m2. In proposed method the numbers 
are divided into two parts that each one is calculated 
separately by using the One Hot adder unit. In previous work 
this unit was responsible for producing carry digits too. It 
should be taken into account that coupling these outputs 
together may result in incorrect output. To handle the 
problem another unit is called One Hot for carry has been 
added to the circuit. As it can be observed in Fig. 6 One hot 
adder1 and One-hot for carry1 have R0× R0 transistors for 
each unit and One-hot adder2 has R1× R1 transistors. One-hot 
adder4 and One-hot for carry3 have 2× R0 transistors and the 
remained three units have 2× R1 transistors. According to the 
values of R0, R1 and r obtained from (7), all required 
transistors have been calculated for odd and even n. The 
results of comparison have been shown in Table I. 
According to them a significant reduction in number of 
applied transistors is considered; however, the total delay of 
circuit is increased to four transistors delay, which is 
negligible versus the huge amount of reduced transistors. By 
using conventional OHRNS method for modulo (rn-1), (rn-1)2 
transistors are required. But as it can be observed in Table I, 
the proposed OHRNS adder decreases the number of applied 
transistors considerably. This reduction in number of applied 
transistors has a remarkable effect on decreasing the DP 
product.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
     RNS is used widely for high speed arithmetic circuits 
according to its carry free property. OHRNS is a method 
which reduces the delay of addition and multiplication 
operation circuits to the delay of just one transistor; 
however, it has large power consumption according to the 
huge number of applied transistors.  
    In this paper, a novel method for One-Hot adder 
circuit has been proposed for modulo (rn-1) which has 
significant improvements in terms of number of applied
