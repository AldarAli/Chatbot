Abstract—Device-to-Device 
(D2D) 
communications 
in 
cellular networks allow devices to communicate directly 
without going through the base station. The D2D underlaying 
cellular networks method is aimed to increase network energy 
efficiency, as specified for Long-Term Evolution Advanced 
(LTE-A) and 5G systems. In this paper, we examine the 
performance of both cooperative and non-cooperative 
communications modes based on the energy models we 
establish, within a mobile network where both user 
equipment (UE) to base station and D2D transmission links 
co-exist. We show that the source-destination distance is an 
important factor to decide whether to use the cooperative or 
non-cooperative transmission scheme in order to achieve 
better energy efficiency. We have also investigated the effects 
of choosing different numbers of relaying branches and relays 
in each branch on the performance of the network. This 
investigation leads to identifying optimal transmission 
schemes for maximizing energy efficiency under varying 
environmental conditions.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, which 
enable direct data transmission between devices such as 
user equipment (UE) without help from existing 
infrastructures such as base stations (BSs) or access points 
(APs), has been investigated as a promising technique for 
future cellular networks [1]. It can reduce signaling 
overhead and save the limited resources of local cells and 
the network as a whole. The existing research in this area 
has been mainly focused on how D2D communications can 
run efficiently as an underlay to cellular networks to save 
energy consumption of UEs and BS and improve network 
performance such as spectral efficiency and throughput [2] 
[3].  
D2D communications normally take place through a 
direct and reliable link between D2D devices to satisfy the 
quality-of-service (QoS) requirement for both D2D links 
and the cellular system simultaneously. However, meeting 
these requirements faces challenges from physical and 
resource limitations, including high loss rates due to 
changes in terrain, multipath fading, Doppler spread, 
interference and noise. This will not only reduce network 
performance but also waste the limited power of the 
devices involved.  
Cooperative 
communications 
through 
applying 
relaying techniques including decode-and-forward (DF) 
and amplify-and-forward (AF) are commonly used to 
overcome these problems, to enhance the transmission 
reliability by creating diversity [4][5]. These techniques 
can enable cellular user equipment (UE) to help each other 
through relaying other device's data and sharing their 
limited resources. However, involving more relay nodes 
will consume more energy, although this can be mitigated 
to some degree through proper power allocation schemes 
[6].  
In this work, we examine the energy efficiency 
performance 
of 
a 
mobile 
cellular 
network 
that 
accommodates both D2D and UE assisted relaying 
communications. We also investigate the strengths and 
limitations of cooperative transmission schemes in this 
scenario, in comparison with non-cooperative schemes, 
under different conditions, such as transmission distance, 
relaying method, channel condition (path loss exponent) 
and interference. Through this investigation we can 
identify proper transmission schemes for optimizing the 
energy performance of the network in varied conditions. In 
addition, we derive the closed form outage probability that 
contributes to establishing the models of energy efficiency.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II discusses the relevance of this research with 
other work. Energy efficiency models for both cooperative 
and non-cooperative transmission schemes in a cellular 
network are presented in Section III. Simulation results and 
discussions are provided in Section IV. Finally, the paper 
is concluded in Section V. 
II. RELATED WORK 
 
Most literature has been focused on the interference 
coordination 
issue 
between 
D2D 
and 
cellular 
communication links. The problem of maximizing cellular 
offloading with D2D communication was studied in [7], 
which is mainly focused on the communication aspects, 
including interference avoidance and energy efficiency. 
Multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) 
systems are also considered to obtain the maximal possible 
energy efficiency for cellular networks [8]. Currently, the 
cooperative D2D idea was exploited for enhancing social 
ties in human social networks [9] to promote efficient 
cooperation among devices.  
In the energy efficiency aspect, work in [10] showed 
that the best position of devices can be found to minimize 
the total power used for the network, while in [11], 
multihop D2D communications where one UE may help 
other two UEs to exchange information has been

investigated in order to enhance energy efficiency. Most of 
the works reported have investigated energy efficiency and 
spectral efficiency over non-cooperative or cooperative 
communication links using only one relay branch. There is 
a lack of information regarding how to choose a specific 
transmission scheme and determine the number of relaying 
branches and the number of relays in each branch under 
different conditions such as the changing transmission 
distance between source and destination nodes, in order to 
find a solution for ensuring the best QoS within a network. 
In this paper, based on the initial work for wireless 
sensor networks [12], our investigation will identify the 
conditions for establishing appropriate transmission 
strategies among different commonly used transmission 
schemes in the context of a cellular network that includes 
both D2D and UE-to-BS links with cooperative as well as 
non-cooperative communications. This investigation is 
based on the development of analytical energy efficiency 
models for these transmission schemes, and involves 
performance analysis on, in particular, the trade-offs 
between cooperative and non-cooperative transmission 
schemes.  
III. ENERGY EFFICIENCY MODEL 
 
In this section, the analytical models of the required 
transmitting power, outage probability and energy 
efficiency in the context of a cellular network and D2D 
communication links are established for both cooperative 
and non-cooperative transmission schemes. Based on these 
models, an adaptive transmission strategy can be developed 
to optimize the energy performance. 
 
Given a cellular network with a number of D2D pairs 
and cellular user equipment (CUE) and BS, the 
optimization of the system performance is achieved by 
maximizing the overall energy efficiency with an outage 
probability target: 
          
  ∑     s.t.{poutS-D}                        (1) 
where EEbi is the energy efficiency of the i-th transmission 
link either between CUE and BS or between D2D devices, 
and poutS-D is the fixed outage probability target. 
Different transmission schemes involving D2D and 
CUE-to-BS links are shown in Fig. 1, including both non-
cooperative and cooperative communications in CUE-BS 
links. In the cooperative communications scenario (Fig. 1 
(b)), relaying with a varied numbers of branches and relays 
in each branch are illustrated and will be considered in 
analytical modeling in connection with D2D transmission 
in Subsections III.A & III.B. 
We consider a cellular cell in which the transmission 
links are subject to narrowband Rayleigh fading with 
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and propagation 
path-loss. The channel fades for different links are assumed 
to be statistically mutually independent. 
A. Non-Cooperative Transmission Scheme  
Consider the scenario shown in Fig. 1(a) where in 
addition to communication between cellular users through 
the base station, which forms CUE-BS links, cellular users  
can also communicate with each other directly in the D2D 
mode. It is assumed that the distance between any D2D pair 
is shorter than that of the CUE-BS link in a cellular cell. 
When a D2D pair communicate by reusing the uplink (UL) 
resource of an active CUE that is transmitting data to the 
BS, the active CUE will interfere with to the D2D receiver 
(DRx) and at the same time the D2D transmitter (DTx) 
causes interference to the BS.

Energy consumption is largely proportional to the 
requirement of maintaining a certain level of transmission 
reliability or the successful transmission rate. In order to 
maintain a required level of the reliability of a transmission 
link, denoted by U(0 ≤ U ≤ 1), the maximum outage 
probability is bounded by: 
 
                                pout  ≤ 1-U                               (12) 
Replacing pout by poutCB in (10) and poutD2D in (11), 
respectively, and taking the nature logarithm on the both 
sides of the expression in (12) when replacing pout by poutCB, 
we then have:

The main objective for performance optimization is to 
maximize the overall energy efficiency under different 
environmental conditions. Thus, the transmit power 
required to satisfy the reliability requirement or be 
constrained by the outage probability for the direct 
transmission must be:

B. Cooperative Transmission Scheme 
In cooperative transmission, CUEs communicate with 
the BS through relay devices in addition to the direct CUE-
BS link. D2D communications involve direct transmission 
between any two UE devices including CUE-Relay and 
Relay-Relay links, as shown in Fig.1(b). Relays receive the 
noisy version of the transmitted symbol and transmit the 
received symbol after some processing to the next relay or 
the BS. In this case, the active CUE and the transmitting 
relays will interfere with the D2D receiver (DRx) and at 
the same time the D2D transmitter (DTx) causes 
interference to the receiving relays and BS.

where EECoop, RCoop and PCoop are the energy efficiency,

where PCC is the transmitting power of cooperative relays, 
hrjB is the channel coefficient of the cooperative R-BS link. 
In this paper, we present two types of cooperative 
transmission schemes: 1) using multiple (K) relaying 
branches with one relay in each branch, and 2) using 
multiple relaying branches and with multiple (n) relays in 
each branch. The selective decode and forward (SDF) 
relaying protocol is used in these two schemes and relays 
perform cooperation when the information from the CUE 
is correctly received by them. We assume that the selection 
combining technique is used at the destination on the 
received packets. For the transmission scheme shown in

where PC and PCC are the transmit power at the CUE and 
relays, respectively. We set the transmit power to be 
proportional to the distance between two communicating 
nodes. For broadcast transmission, e.g., when the CUE 
transmits, the longest distance, i.e., the distance between 
the CUE and the BS, dCB, is considered. So, the power 
between the two communicating nodes is given by: 
                                 / = D/

where Λij denotes the power coefficient between node i 
and node j. In our model, we assume that the value of Λij 
depends on the distance of the CUE-BS, relay-relay or 
relay-destination link. For example, the transmit power 
for the relay-destination link is:

We can formulate the power minimization problem by 
specifying a required reliability level, in a similar way to 
the method used in Subsection III. A. The optimization 
problem can be stated as follows: Optimize PC or PCC so 
that 
             ∑ s.t.{<=>? ≤  1 − J}                  (26) 
Both PC and PCC(contained in poutcoop) are involved in the 
optimization process for the cooperative transmission 
mode. And the transmitted power used in the selective 
decode–and-forward scheme with multiple relays, PT, is 
bounded by:

Therefore, the overall consumed power can be expressed 
as: 
? =  (<=>.)( + K) + (1 − <=>.) F)(L ∗ N) ∗

E + 13 + (L ∗ N + 1)KH                                        (28) 
The first term on the right-hand side corresponds to the 
consumed energy when the relay is not able to correctly 
decode the message from the CUE, which means that this 
link is in outage. In this case, only the CUE consumes 
transmit power and the destination node and K relays 
consume receive power. The second term counts for the 
event that the CUE-Relay link is not in outage, hence 
transmit and processing power at relays and receive power 
at the destination are consumed.  
The optimization problem with one constraint variable 
and its Lagrangian is given by:

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we examine the energy efficiency of 
different transmission schemes under various channel and 
transmission conditions in a cellular network shown in Fig. 
1 using computer simulation. We then show how the 
transmission scheme can be chosen in an adaptive way to 
optimize the energy performance. The network settings 
used for simulation are listed in TABLE 1. Given a certain 
network topology, we randomly choose a CUE-BS pair and 
apply different transmission schemes for comparison 
purposes. Assume the achievable rate R in this scenario to 
be 1 Mbit/s, and the required system reliability level (U) to 
be 0.999. 
Fig. 2 shows the energy efficiency performance of both 
cooperative and non-cooperative schemes. As we can 
observe, cooperative transmission outperforms the non-
cooperative transmission when the transmission range is 
beyond 17 meters for the CUE-BS link (Fig. 2(a)) and 2 
meters for the D2D link (Fig. 2(b)), respectively. We can 
see from Fig. 2(a) that the non-cooperative direct 
transmission has considerably higher energy efficiency 
than cooperative schemes for short-range transmission, i.e., 
dCB<17m in the case of cooperative transmission using K=2 
branches with n=1 relay per branch, and dCB<44m in the

case of cooperative transmission using K=3 branches with 
n=3 relays per branch. 
When the distance of the CUE-BS link is short the 
transmit power of CUE is proportionally low according to 
(23), so the interference of CUE to the D2D receiver DRx 
is low as well. This reduces the overall required transmit 
power from DTx and then increases energy efficiency for 
short distance transmission, as shown in Fig. 2(b). 
Fig. 3depicts energy efficiency against the numbers of 
CUEs and D2D pairs which uniformly distributed in a 
cellular cell. Substantial performance gaps in energy 
efficiency can be observed from Fig.3(a) and Fig. 3(b) 
between the direct transmission scheme in CUE-BS or 
D2D links and the optimal transmission schemes using 
cooperative relaying. 
Results in Fig. 4 show how energy efficiency varies 
with the threshold of SINR (β) for both cooperative and 
non-cooperative schemes with different distances in CUE-
BS links (dCB). When distance is 10m (Fig. 4(a)) using 
direct transmission is most energy efficient and 
significantly better than cooperative transmission for 
β<9dB. This is because within a short distance direct 
transmission is good enough to meet the reliability 
requirement while having a less number of transmitters 
than the cooperative transmission scheme. When the SINR 
threshold becomes higher, the scheme with one relay and 
one branch (n=1, K=1) performs better than others, but 
schemes with more branches and relays for this short 
distance leads to the increase of the transmit power and 
then the decrease of energy efficiency. 
When the transmission range increases (dCB=35m), the 
energy efficiency of direct transmission decreases as 
shown in Fig. 4(b). It can be seen that transmission with 
two relaying branches(with one relay each) in addition to 
the direct link is most energy efficient for the relatively 
good channel conditions (β<5dB). When the SINR 
threshold becomes higher, other schemes with more relays 
and branches (n>1, K>1) perform better than others. For 
β>5dB, transmission with three branches and three relays 
per branch are the best in terms of energy efficiency, with 
a trend that more relays are needed to maintain the highest 
possible efficiency when the channel condition gets worse. 
This is because using more than one relay in each branch 
will lead to the transmit power of relays being significantly 
reduced due to shortened distance between devices.  
In Fig.4(c), the energy performance of the same set of 
transmission schemes is displayed but the distance is 
100m. In this scenario, transmission with multiple 
branches (K= 3) and three relays (n=3) per branch is more 
efficient than direct transmission, and schemes with two 
branches (K=2) with one relay (n=1) each in all channel 
conditions. This indicates that the diversity created through 
cooperation has an impact on the increment of energy 
efficiency. In addition, it reveals that when channel 
conditions get worse, having additional relays in a branch 
is a simple and effective way to prevent transmission 
failure events while keeping energy consumption as low as 
possible.  
There are a number of factors that can affect energy 
consumption 
in 
a 
cellular 
networks. 
Cooperative 
transmission involves additional paths and devices (relays) 
compared to direct transmission, which costs more energy.

But the diversity it creates can save energy by reducing the 
number of retransmissions due to the reduced packet loss 
rate. In addition, increasing the number of relays in each 
branch reduces the distance of each transmission hop, 
resulting in lower transmit power needed for relays. But 
when the number of relays increases, the total circuitry 
power will accumulate as it depends on the number of 
transmitting devices and is independent from the 
transmission distance. As a result, the total energy 
consumption will increase if too many branches and relays 
are used. 
Therefore, to achieve the best energy performance 
proper transmission schemes including in both CUE-BS 
and D2D links should be selected given the transmission 
conditions, such as the source-destination distance and 
channel quality. The results of this work provide an 
effective guidance for deciding when and how the 
cooperative or direct transmission scheme should be 
employed. Based on our investigation, an energy-efficient 
transmission strategy can be formed in cellular networks by 
adaptively choosing cooperative or non-cooperative trans-
mission schemes for varied network and transmission 
conditions. 
V. CONCLUSION 
We have investigated the energy performance of a 
cellular network supporting both D2Dcommunications and 
CUE-BS links in either cooperative or non-cooperative 
transmission modes. Based on the outage probability and 
energy efficiency models derived, we have shown that 
cooperative and non-cooperative transmission schemes can 
be used collectively alongside D2D communications to 
achieve the highest possible energy efficiency depending on 
environmental conditions such as the channel quality and 
transmission range. Adaptive transmission strategies based 
on the results presented in this paper can therefore be 
derived to optimize the energy performance in such a 
network.
