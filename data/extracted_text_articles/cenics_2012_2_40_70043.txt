Abstract—The work focuses a new design approach to a 
hardware implementation of a Bio-Inspired Medical Hearing 
Aid which has the specificity to be portable and hence needs 
reduced resources and low power. This paper describes how 
we appropriately applied hardware optimization in the aim to 
reach on computationally intensive DSP algorithms for use to 
improve performance and efficiency of a hearing aid device on 
FPGA. Deaf people suffer from their social disease, so a device 
which could correct their hearing loss is needed. Even the 
technology advances these embedded devices can still be 
optimized for low cost. Contributions, mainly focus area 
reduction and hence low power consumption and dissipation. 
We propose a new design approach to meet the specifications 
of this embedded system.

 INTRODUCTION  
Voice conversation is one of the most important tools 
for communication whereas some people don’t have profit 
from this opportunity because of their hearing loss. Speech 
is badly detected by these impaired persons yielding to poor 
intelligibility. This happens mostly in noisy and reverberant 
environment [1][2]. 
Since many years, prosthesis and cochlear implants 
have been used but deaf persons are still feeling 
uncomfortable and suffer from this social handicap. 
A Lot of researchers were held for speech enhancement 
leading to many contributions for algorithms development 
and circuits’ design with less complexity and fast processing 
[3][4][5].  
Knowing that it is difficult, say impossible, to 
reproduce the natural hearing for impaired persons, our 
contribution is to make the filtered signal more closely to 
the original one for better intelligibility and hearing comfort. 
The DSP algorithms [6] were implemented using 
traditional DSP or general purpose microprocessors. It was 
released that they have limited capabilities for processing 
high volume data efficiently at real time. The trends were 
shifted to specific processors such as Asics in order to meet 
the increased complexity and performance requirements of 
these algorithms but with high cost function. 
The rapid growth in the industrial technologies has 
participated in the development of several and performed 
hardware digital signal processing application systems. The 
implementations of intensive computational DSP algorithms 
become for researchers a day to day application area for 
digital hardware platforms [7][8]. 
FPGA [9] has taken a large area of use because of some 
advantages over Asic technologies.  
Several hardware platforms [10][11][12] were designed 
with different combinations and optimizations of filters 
structures. They were simulated and synthesized using 
Xilinx or Altera FPGA development kits.  
The impact of these hardware optimization techniques 
on the overall DWT hardware system are analyzed and the 
tradeoffs between the pertinent hardware performance 
metrics particularly power consumption, latency, resource 
utilization and operating frequency are considered and 
investigated [13]. 
Today, FPGAs are highly preferred to the relatively 
high capacity and low cost, short design cycle and short 
time to market. They afford the capability of constant 
reconfiguration to meet application performances which are 
highly preferred. 
Recent FPGA includes enhanced signal processing 
capabilities of high performance logic and inherent 
parallelism enabling FPGAs to have special Multiply-
Accumulate (MAC) blocks within its hardware. 
By using FPGA, the design can be simulated and then 
synthesized with low cost. The hardware design is then 
ready for fabrication and use. 
Our work is focused in the implementation of an 
efficient multi level one dimension Discrete Wavelet 
Transform (DWT) on FPGA for medical hearing aid 
application.

The 
proposed 
architecture 
combines 
hardware 
optimization techniques to develop a flexible DWT 
architecture that has a high performance and is suitable for 
portability, high processing speed and power efficiency 
[9][10] in order to optimize the hardware, we have reduced 
FPGA resources by using some techniques and orientated 
the VHDL [14] program in order to have a synthesized IP-
based on customized DSP slice resources of the FPGA.  
The paper is divided into four main sections. An 
overview of deafness is presented in the next section. 
Section three illustrates how the DWT algorithm is 
modelled to the cochlea structure. In Section four, we 
present the implementation of the FIR filters and show the 
simulations, 
the 
synthesis 
and 
the 
appropriate 
approximations. Performance analysis of the whole system 
and the perspectives for future work are presented in the 
conclusion. 
II. 
 OVERVIEW OF DEAFNESS  
Impaired persons are affected by some perturbation 
phenomena, namely noise and echo, which reduces the 
intelligibility and hence their capability for understanding 
and communicating. Some studies were conducted to assess 
the status of noise and echo stripping.   
A.  Noise Reduction 
Noise overlaps speech signal and can be suppressed or 
reduced by a low pass filtering as shown by Figure 1. 
However, when applying such action on a signal, we 
sometimes rescue to the elimination of some singularities of 
the signal which can contain significant information. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Speech signal versus noise separation . 
In order to improve intelligibility, noise should be 
reduced but cannot be fully eliminated from speech because 
nothing is known about this latter and how far is it modeled 
with speech [15]. 
Care should be taken when applying denoising 
algorithms to avoid making any severe degradation of the 
resulting signal. The time-scale analysis is the perfect 
solution for speech processing as we will in Section III. 
Noise overlaps the speech signal in both time and 
frequency; so, it is difficult to remove it completely. Hence, 
greatest attention was made in the development of noise 
reductions techniques.   
B. Echo Cancellation  
The Acoustic feedback refers to the acoustical 
coupling between the loudspeaker and the microphone of 
the hearing aid. The amplified sound sent through the 
loudspeaker is sometimes fad back into the microphone as 
shown in Figure 2. 
As a result, the original signal gets distorted and then 
poor intelligibility occurs. One direct solution is to reduce 
the gain, but this limitation generates low energy making 
signals falling below the hearing threshold and no 
compensation is made to the impaired persons.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Acoustical feedback in hearing aids . 
Acoustic feedback suppression techniques are suitable to 
increase the maximum gain of the system without making it 
unstable, as shown in Figure 3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Adaptive filtering diagram . 
Wiener adaptive filtering techniques [16] consider 
stationary signals and use, LMS [17], NLMS [18] or RLS 
[19] algorithms. For non-stationary signals, generalized 
techniques are used based on Kalman filtering [20].  
The estimated error is given in [16] by:

The objective is to find the optimal coefficients which 
make the error as small as possible. In order to do that, we 
should minimize the energy of the total error given by the 
equation: 
 
 
                                                                                    (2) 
 
 
By making ∂E/∂
ja  = 0, we can obtain the coefficients 
ja  from the m generated equations. 
III. 
THE BIO INSPIRED ALGORITHMIC MODEL  
Before making the algorithm model, we first make an 
overview on how the basilar membrane acts as a group of 
mimicked filters. 
A. Basilar Membrane Modeling  (BMM) 
The cochlea is an opened spiral tube lying in the middle 
ear. The opening in its base makes possible the penetration 
of the sound signals. The closed end is called the apex. The 
sound is detected and coded according to its frequency but it 
is place coding on the basilar membrane. The sounds of high 
frequencies are detected at the base, whereas those of low 
frequencies are detected at the apex. The frequencies are 
distributed along the basilar membrane in a very precise 
manner as represented by Figure 4.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Longitudinal view of the cochlea . 
The filters within the cochlea are distributed in bands 
along the basilar membrane and are responsible of the 
selectivity of the sound frequency in the ear. These filters 
can be modelled in a pseudo-logarithmic way. They are 
either triangular (Mels) or rectangular (ERB). The bands are 
linear up to 500 Hz and logarithmic beyond. Each 
bandwidth can be determined using the formula [16]:

where f is the central frequency of the band. 
B. Survey of the DWT 
The Discrete Wavelet Transform [22] is an important 
approach for the analysis of a transient signal. The 
connection was made between the wavelet transform and 
multi-rate filter bank trees by Mallat since 1989 [13]. From 
signal processing point of view, the wavelet transform of a 
sequential signal is to recursively decompose a sampled 
sequence of a signal into two components in octave bands. 
A recursively asymmetric decomposition levels, leads to a 
similar bands distribution as the basilar membrane which 
make the DWT the adequate algorithm [23]. Three level 
wavelet decomposition is shown in Figure 5. 
 
     
 
Figure 5.  The level decomposition of Wavelet analysis . 
The input signal is spread into two signals by the Low 
Pass Filter giving what we call the approximation of the 
signal and, by the High pass filter giving a detail of the 
signal at the first level. The process can be repeated on for 
other 
levels 
using 
a 
symmetric 
or 
asymmetric 
decomposition. The wavelet coefficients can be used to 
reconstruct the original signal without any distortions. The 
LPF and HPF are Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters.  
FIR filters are the basis of the DWT. For a dyadic 
representation, the basic analysis / synthesis structure of the 
DWT is represented by the Quadratic Mirror Filters (QMF) 
shown in Figure 6. 
 
 
 
Figure 6.  Quadratic Mirror filter structure . 
where the Hx filters state for Decomposition (D) and Gx 
for Reconstruction (R). HPF means High Pass Filter and 
LPF is the Low Pass Filter. These filters are related by the 
following equations: 
H0(z) . G0(z) + H1(z) . G1(z) = z-T 
H0(-z) . G0(z) + H1(-z) . G1(z) = 0

By setting: G0(z) = H1(-z)   and     G1(z) = -H0(-z), we satisfy: 
•  Perfect reconstruction with latency (T) 
•  No aliasing   
The coefficients are obtained by Matlab using Wfilters for 
different wavelet. They are stored as real and then converted 
to fix point numbers so as they can be treated in the 
hardware design circuit.  
The selection of the FIR filters is due to coefficient 
sensitivity, round off noise, stability and are suitable for 
high speed applications [24]. 
The FIR filters use a convolution principle of the input 
signal X(n) by the impulse response h(n). The output Y(n) is 
given by the following mathematical expression: 
                                                                    
 
The FIR filter is composed of multipliers, adders and 
delay units. Recent FPGA includes DSP48A1 elements 
making ideal to implement DSP functions.  
The n input samples from the data set are presented at 
the input of each DSP48A1 slice.  
Each slice can be used to multiply these samples with 
the corresponding coefficients within the DSP48A1. The 
outputs of the multipliers are combined in the cascaded 
adders. A basic DSP48 slice is shown in Figure 7. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  DSP Slice 48 A1 with Pre-Adder . 
The sample delay logic is denoted by Z-1, the (-1) 
represents a single clock delay. The delayed input samples 
are supplied to the one input of the multiplier. The 
coefficients represented by (h(0) to h(N-1)) are supplied to 
the other input of the multiplier through individual ROMs, 
RAMs, registers or constants. The output Y(n) is merely the 
summation of a set of input samples, and in time, multiplied 
by their respective coefficients. The DSP48A1 lying inside 
the FPGA is suitable for low power dissipation and high 
throughput based pipelining and parallel processing [25]. 
IV. 
ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION  
The filter structure of FIR of length L (called order of 
the filter) is represented in Figure 8. This structure describes 
the relationship between the input and output sequences. 
The input samples are delayed and multiplied by the suitable 
coefficients and then added to give the output at time n.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.  Convolution principle in FIR . 
The architecture of each FIR block includes a FIFO 
register for data input, a register for the coefficients and the 
operators. The data output is stored in memory. The FIR 
block is presented in Figure 10. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.  Basic FIR filters architecture Design . 
The FIFO at the input is filled by the input data 
samples. An input register of length N is used to store the 
input sequence X(n) taken from the FIFO. These samples 
are convolved with the coefficients which have been already 
stored in a coefficients register. The output sequence is also 
stored in a FIFO register (memory).

speech signal “the Discrete Fourier Transform of a real 
value signal is conjugate-symmetric”. The wave signal is 
sampled at a frequency Fs = 22050 Hz. We take blocs of 
10000 samples by Hamming windowing. For our 
experiments, Daubechies 4 was chosen. The filters

The input data samples and the coefficients were 
quantified and approximation tests were done for 8, 10, 12, 
14, 16 bits. The better approximation was obtained for 12 
bits and over.     
The 12 bits quantization has been chosen for the rest of 
the experiment. The input samples and the coefficients have 
been converted to signed fix point data using a Q1.11 
format. The output results after multiplications and 
additions are of format Q5.22. So, a truncation is done 
giving an output data of Q1.11 format with negligible 
errors. The samples are converted from floating to fixed 
point numbers, so they can be treated by the VHDL 
programs and then compared to those obtained by Matlab. A 
flow chart is given by Figure 11. 
A. Simulations 
In the VHDL simulations process, we generated the 
outputs of the design which are compared to the outputs 
generated at the algorithmic level using Matlab. We used for 
accuracy in metric estimation, the peak error and the Mean 
Square Error (MSE). A maximum performance is achieved 
with an error of less than 0.3 %.   
In Figure 10, we make a comparison between the data 
obtained from the resulting output samples stored in the 
output files, using Matlab textread and plot functions.

B. Synthesis 
For post-synthesis, we used the EP2C70F896C6 device 
of Cyclone II family at 100 Mhz clock. A VHDL Netlist 
containing Altera simulation primitives was generated and 
has been used again for correct compilation and simulation.  
The design was synthesized using QuartusII giving the 
circuit at the Register Transfer Level (RTL) shown by 
Figure 11. The architecture needs registers of N bits if the 
data input is N bits but, our suggested architecture only 
needs L bits FIFO register and therefore we get an 
optimized structure for implementation.

As shown by Figure 11, the basic FIR bloc is divided 
into two processing units. The first calculates the 
convolution coefficients with the L first bits and then with 
the L next bits with a save f the overlap data. Only a few 
bits are saved dealing to a gain of space memory.

The technological schematic is given by Figure 12. We 
can see that the circuit use combinatory components such as 
adders and multipliers. The system is controlled by a state 
machine which synchronizes the data acquisition and data 
treatment processes.

The performance metrics show the efficient contribution 
of FPGA resources in the implementation of the FIR filters 
which are the basic elements for the global system design 
(DWT). This hardware design has permitted the reduction of 
the used area; the used resources are less than 4% and the 
optimization of the latency and the power consumption.

RELATED WORKS 
The direct form (DF) FIR filters architecture was first 
implemented by Baganne et al. [26]. This architecture was 
modular and had low design complexity, low hardware 
latency and could be easily expanded to further levels of 
decomposition. However, this architecture had a large 
critical path delay, needs more resources and high power 
dissipation. 
 We have first implemented this architecture in order to 
compare it with our new design approach [27]. For 
optimization, we apply the appropriate hardware pipeline 
and parallel techniques within the DF and use polyphase 
filters instead of decimation process. In this new 
architecture, we used the transpose form (TF) filters to 
reduce critical path delay. We also use an Over Lapp Add 
(OLA) computation method in order to overcome the 
memory space and the waiting time for filling the data in the 
input FIFO register.   
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
We have developed and tested a DSP system for hearing 
impaired persons. It incorporates wide bandwidth and a 
great deal of flexibility in adjusting the overall speech 
processing algorithm. 
The DSP48A1 slices have been integrated into FPGA 
for Digital Signal Processing purpose. They are assembled 
in columns using less wiring which reduces internal 
connections and avoid critical paths and hence time latency.  
The use of DSP48A1 has allowed a high performance of the 
system and about 20 % of the power dissipation is gained.   
The principle objective of this paper was to present the 
new design approach of a low cost and reconfigurable 
FPGA platform. It can be used to test the DWT algorithms 
with different parameters as to meet the specifications for 
different hearing pathologies.  
We are currently pursuing research to improve our 
current algorithms and architecture design for further noise 
reduction and echo cancellation. Knowing that the 
perception of speech is highly subjective in nature, the 
system is subjected to be tested on human subjects in the 
real world environment. The patient’s response will 
determine the success or failure of this DSP system.
