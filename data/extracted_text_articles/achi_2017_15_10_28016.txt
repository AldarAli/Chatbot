Abstract—The design and evaluation of mobile interfaces for 
older adults are becoming more important as the population 
ages and their use of technology increases. Current design 
strategies, which are used to guide the design of mobile 
interfaces, are either not primarily developed for mobile 
platforms or are not focused on the aging population with 
diverse limitations. Adaptation and integration of the 
existing strategies were necessary to create an inclusive and 
comprehensive set of guidelines for interactive mobile 
interfaces for older adults. The paper presents an overview 
of the Universal Design Mobile Interface Guidelines 
(UDMIG) and the related evaluation checklist. UDMIG v.2.1 
and the evaluation checklist were developed to ensure 
usability of future mobile technologies by older adults 
through a universal design strategy that accommodates all 
users to the greatest extent possible. This paper contributes 
to human-computer interaction research by including this 
population of users and advancing the technology uses for 
the mobile touchscreen interfaces for aging population.  
Keywords-aging; design; evaluation; mobile interfaces. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Older adults encounter many barriers associated with 
aging while interacting with mobile applications [1]-[4]. 
Lack of physical space (e.g., small touch and physical 
buttons), confusion with their location within the context, 
use of menus that require precise movements, use of small 
fonts, content placement, and use of large contents that 
require memory recall, are some of the barriers that lead to 
longer and less successful task completion [5][6].  
The design and evaluation of mobile interfaces for 
older adults is becoming more important as the population 
ages and their use of technology increases. Current design 
strategies that guide the design of user interfaces are either 
not primarily developed for mobile platforms or are not 
focused on the aging population with diverse limitations. 
Moreover, there is a lack of evaluation tools for mobile 
applications designed for older adults. Four established 
design strategies for desktop and mobile user interfaces for 
the general and aging population were analyzed: Universal 
Design (UD), Design for Aging (DfA), Universal 
Usability (UU), and Guidelines for Handheld Mobile 
Device 
Interface 
Design 
(MID). 
Adaptation 
and 
integration of the existing strategies were necessary to 
create an inclusive and comprehensive set of guidelines for 
interactive mobile interfaces for older adults. In addition, 
the evaluation checklist was created to support the user 
testing of mobile applications designed for an aging 
population. 
The research paper presents an overview of the 
Universal Design Mobile Interface Guidelines, UDMIG 
v.2.1, and the related evaluation checklist. UDMIG v.2.1 
and the evaluation checklist were developed to ensure 
usability of future mobile technologies by older adults 
through a universal design strategy that accommodates all 
users to the greatest extent possible. 
This paper is organized into five sections. Section II 
describes the related work that covers four sets of design 
guidelines used to develop the resulting UDMIG. Section 
III describes the final version of the design guidelines. 
Section IV addresses the related evaluation checklist. 
Section V summarizes the paper and proposes future work.  
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The purpose of UD is to design for everyone and by 
doing so, to overcome the barriers to usability that come 
with aging [7][8]. It consists of seven principles of 
universal design and twenty-nine guidelines. In contrast to 
UD, DfA [9] focuses on specific limitations of older 
adults. DfA is a strategy that explores the factors that 
constrain the use of products and user interfaces by older 
adults, as well as aspects of human-computer interface 
design that accommodate older users with age-associated 
disabilities and limitations [10]. It has fifty-two design 
guidelines grouped into six categories that cover design of 
visual, auditory, and haptic presentation of information, 
input and output devices, and effective interface design.  
Based on UD, which initially covered the design of 
physical environments (e.g., buildings, spaces, products, 
graphics), UU was developed to support usability, 
inclusivity, and utility of information and communication 
technology [11]. It contains eight guidelines, called the 
Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design. Guidelines for 
Handheld Mobile Device Interface Design [12] were based 
on UU, modifying its eight design guidelines and adding 
the guidelines applicable to mobile and touchscreen 
platforms.  
While UD, DfA, UU, and MID represent design 
strategies that are currently used to guide the design of 
mobile interfaces, none are sufficiently comprehensive to 
ensure that mobile user interfaces will be usable by older 
adults. UU, DfA, and UD guidelines were not originally 
developed for mobile interfaces, although UD has recently 
included this platform to a certain extent. MID fails to

acknowledge diversity and the ranges of limitations that 
the aging population faces. 
Moreover, 
there 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
relevant 
and 
comprehensive evaluation tools that support usability and 
equitability assessment of mobile touchscreen interfaces 
for an aging population. The existing assessment tools are 
either designed for other environments (e.g., products, 
services, spaces, buildings) or developed to support the 
design of mobile interfaces for general population, thus 
failing to acknowledge the diversity of limitations of older 
adults.  
UD checklist [13][14] is an evaluation tool, which 
assesses the design based on both UD principles and 
ranges of users’ abilities (i.e., vision, hearing, speech, 
cognition, dexterity, communication, balance, stature, 
upper and lower body strength and mobility, life span) to 
indicate the degree to which the outcome met the criteria 
for each design principle and each type of ability, 
respectively. This tool only considers the architectural 
spaces, does not assess the specific design features and 
evaluates the proposed and not the actual designs. The 
Universal Design Performance Measures for Products [8] 
uses twenty-nine UD guidelines as performance measures, 
and the five-point rating scale from strongly disagree to 
strongly agree, with a choice of not applicable to identify 
strengths and weaknesses of a product. This assessment 
tool is intended to be used by experts on aging and 
disability to evaluate the usability of the products 
throughout the life cycle, develop usability testing and 
focus groups, and identify and promote UD features of 
products. It is limiting in the application to complex and 
integrated products. The second version of this tool called 
the Product Evaluation Countdown [15], was developed 
for use by end-users with their ranges and levels of 
abilities to test the actual demands of products. Universal 
Design Assessment Protocol (UDAP) [8][16] assesses UD 
principles by ability as well as across the range of abilities, 
evaluating design at the level of each UD guideline, thus 
providing a more precise analysis. However, the tool 
proved to be very complex and impractical to actually 
quantify UD with its six hundred and twelve-cell matrix. 
The Global Universal Design Commission, Inc. (GUDC) 
created GUDC Rating System that covers design process, 
site and building elements, customer service, and facilities 
management, which is building-type specific [8]. WCAG 
2.0 checklist [17] was developed to design accessible web 
pages to users with disabilities. It is also used to primarily 
evaluate the accessibility of HTML content. However, 
neither one of these evaluation tools was developed for the 
usability evaluation of the mobile user interfaces. 
Heuristic evaluation [18] is widely used for web and 
mobile interface usability assessment. This usability 
engineering method was made to be an easy, fast, and 
cheap way of evaluating user interface design during the 
project lifecycle. An evaluation framework for mobile 
interfaces [19] is developed to allow designers and users to 
quickly test the prototypes on the actual devices. A 
number of other evaluation checklists and frameworks for 
testing the usability of mobile applications for the general 
population have been proposed [20]-[22]. However, these 
usability assessment tools do not recognize a variety and 
ranges of limitations an aging population faces. 
III. 
UNIVERSAL DESIGN MOBILE INTERFACE 
GUIDELINES, UDMIG 
The first version of the guidelines, UDMIG v.1.0, 
which has been previously reported [23][24], was created 
by applying DfA, UU, and MIG to seven UD principles 
and related guidelines. This version relied too much on 
principles and guidelines of universal design, failed to 
incorporate person-environment interaction approach that 
was a unique contribution of DfA, contained inconsistent 
language and level of specificity, and needed further 
refinement. As a result, UDMIG v.2.0 [25] was developed 
within a framework based on the two organizing 
principles: the Person-Environment (P-E) Fit Model [26], 
and 
Guideline 
Approach 
(i.e., 
prescriptive- 
vs. 
performance-based).  
The P-E Model [26] assessed the match or fit between 
a person’s ability and the demands of the environment to 
promote healthy aging. Usability of mobile applications is 
achieved when there is a match between a person’s ability 
and the design of the interface. In UDMIG v.2.0, the 
person component is a part of all the guidelines as it 
describes how to accommodate people with different 
abilities. The fit component includes those guidelines that 
describe the design of the touchscreen mobile interface as 
a whole (i.e., interface context), as well as those that guide 
the design of the specific design elements of the mobile 
interface with which users interact. The environment 
component recognizes the requirements of the overall 
space and context of use (e.g., lighting and glare). Only the 
fit component is addressed in this paper. 
Guidelines were also categorized into prescriptive- vs. 
performance-based. Prescriptive guidelines focus on 
means and methods of achieving usability by dictating 
what must be done to achieve a usable outcome. This is 
largely achieved without specifying the design of the 
outcome. In contrast, performance guidelines focus on the 
product or results of the design process. Performance-
based guidelines suggest what the usable outcome should 
be without regard to how that outcome is achieved. As a 
result, performance guidelines provide greater flexibility in 
design outcomes by providing opportunities for designers 
to rely on their own interpretation and creativity to achieve 
a usable outcome.  
A. UDMIG v.2.1 
UDMIG v.2.0 was refined and regrouped to better fit 
its organization into the interface context and design 
elements guidelines (See Table 1). Features guidelines 
were renamed into the design elements guidelines so that 
the resulting UDMIG v.2.1 precisely distinguish between 
the design characteristics and elements of the mobile 
interfaces. Design characteristics are specified based on 
the design elements guidelines and indicate clearly what 
exactly needs to be developed and designed for a usable 
outcome.

Interface context guidelines guide the design of the 
mobile touchscreen interface as a whole. For example, the 
mobile user interface needs to be designed in a way that 
the complexity is eliminated, and information arranged 
consistent with its importance to allow for natural use.

Design elements guidelines cover the design of the 
specific elements within the mobile touchscreen interface 
that users interact with. For instance, a user interface is 
designed to provide the user with the option to change the 
color contrast (e.g., white on black vs. black on white). 
IV. 
UDMIG V.2.1 EVALUATION 
Prescriptive design guidelines and standards are easy 
to interpret and to objectively test in the wild. Assessment 
of performance guidelines is multidimensional since it 
incorporates both activity and participation [8]. All 
performance-based guidelines are subject to interpretation 
by experts as well as end-users to a certain extent, which 
makes objective measurement slightly difficult. UDMIG 
v.2.1 Checklist rates all the design guidelines using the 5-
point Likert scale. It is intended to be used by users as well 
as by the experts in the field to objectively assess usability 
and equitability of the mobile interfaces.

UDMIG v.2.1 checklist is developed to be used by 
both experts in the field (e.g., designers, researchers, 
disability and gerontology experts) and older adults. The 
checklist is a usability and equitability evaluation 
instrument that can be used to identify usability problems 
during the design process as well as to test the final 
product. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
UDMIG v.2.1 and related evaluation checklist were 
developed to ensure usability of future mobile applications 
by older adults. A universal design approach was used to 
accommodate all users to the greatest extent possible. 
Based on each UDMIG v.2.1 guideline, a representative 
statement with the 5-point Likert scale was created. The 
purpose of the checklist is to rate the agreement with each 
of the guideline. It was developed for end-users and 
usability experts to evaluate the usability and equitability 
of the mobile interfaces for an aging population. 
The future work will require validation of the 
guidelines and the checklist through the application of 
UDMIG v.2.1 and evaluation of both the guidelines and 
the checklist with older adults and other users who 
represent variety and ranges of abilities. The planned work 
includes development and testing of an eHealth mobile 
application for individuals aging with Multiple Sclerosis 
(MS). People with MS represent an ideal user group for 
application and evaluation of UDMIG v.2.1 and the 
checklist. They are a diverse user group with symptoms

that vary widely from individual to individual and within 
an individual over time. UDMIG v.2.1 checklist will be 
evaluated with both experts in the field and individuals 
with MS.
