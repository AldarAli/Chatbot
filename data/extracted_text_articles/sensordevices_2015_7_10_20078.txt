Abstract—This paper proposes a method to estimate the state
of user to provide proactive hospitality from features of their
gait pattern acquired with an Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID)
system. This method uses RFID readers on each shoe, as well as
RFID tags installed on the ﬂoor. The ID of each tag is organized
as a map, to show the precise position of the user. The reader
and tags communicate while the user is walking. We classify tag
IDs detected by readers into each step with Ward Method. We
calculate stride, walking speed, and so on, as feature components
of a gait vector in each step. We recognize the state of the
user from these components with the Random Forest. In an
experiment, we have imposed subjects on walking under several
kinds of conditions. We have evaluated the classiﬁcation result
through F-measure calculated from 10-fold cross-validation. It
implies we can classify each state of users. We discuss why we
can classify each state of users from gait vector components with
the variable importance and their correlation. In addition, we
have veriﬁed whether we can detect discomfort caused by the
way to carry luggage. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of our
proposed method.

INTRODUCTION
The number of tourists visiting Japan has reached to more
than 10 million in 2013.The government aims that every tourist
can feel “ Omotenashi ” in Japan [1]. “ Omotenashi ” is a
Japanese word, which means proactive hospitality. First, an
Omotenashi provider grasps the state of customers in advance
to provide some services before it is required. There are many
tourists who are looking forward to going shopping in Japan
[2]. We focus on Omotenashi services in a shopping mall. It
is impossible for the shopping mall to provide Omotenashi
services for each customer, because it costs too much to
train and arrange Omotenashi providers. We need a system
that can provide Omotenashi services at a low cost. In this
paper, we consider Omotenashi services using the Information
and Communication Technology. We propose the two kinds
of Omotenashi services in the shopping mall. The ﬁrst one
is to care customers who are suffering from discomfort for
luggage, or are fatigued for some reason. The second is to keep
safety for distracted customers. For customers who have heavy
luggage like electrical appliances as a souvenir, it proposes
to use luggage storages and lockers, as well as to inform
the location of the elevator. For customers who have fatigue
after long shopping, it recommends a resting place like a cafe.
It warns distracted customers watching the advertisements or
smartphones while walking. We also consider that customers
feel uncomfortable when they hold luggage in a different way
than usual. For example, they sometimes have to carry luggage
with one hand to hold their baby. In these cases, services
should also be changed. It is necessary to identify when they
are forced to have luggage with an uncomfortable way by
external factors to provide more comfortable services.
Omotenashi services found on grasping the state of a
customer in advance. This paper refers to the information
as a user status. In this paper, we deﬁne the following user
status; They are carrying luggage, tired, texting (i.e., using
smartphones) while walking, and focusing on advertisements.
We assume our services are provided in major streets or in
front of display windows. We estimate user status in the areas
from their gait patterns. We discuss the variables which play an
important role in the estimation. Section 2 introduces existing
works. Section 3 explains our method to calculate the feature
of customers’ gait. In Section 4 and Section 5, we indicate the
experiment and evaluation. In Section 6, the paper discusses
the practical possibilities. Section 7 summarizes our work.

RELATED WORK
Several methods are proposed to detect user status. Ikeda
et al. identify some kinds of luggage like carts and backpacks,
using more than one Laser Range (LR) sensors installed around
the user [3]. Qi et al. identify whether the user has a suitcase
and a backpack from the ratio of left and right contours against
the center of the body detected by a camera [4]. Yonekawa
et al. detect user fatigue from changes of pressure values
measured with sensors installed in shoe insoles [5]. Arif et
al. show the fatigue is related to the stability of walking,
using 3D accelerometer sensors [6]. Music et al. detect texting
while walking from the standard deviation of meter readings
from accelerometer sensors [7]. Thepvilojanapong et al. cal-
culate the degree of attention from the staying judgement,
the movement of people, discrimination of people, and so on,
using LR sensor placed beside walls [8]. Clippingdale et al.
detect attention state and estimate interest from direction and
expression of the face, direction of the upper body, and so on,
using cameras installed in TVs [9]. However, these sensors
can only identify one or few kinds of user status. Moreover,
positional information is necessary to provide Omotenashi
services on the spot. Some of these sensors, pressure sensor
and accelerometer sensor, cannot grasp positional information
by themselves. Since cameras are poor at shielding privacy, it
is difﬁcult to install them in public places like shopping malls.
LR sensors are expensive. We need a system to accurately

Figure 1. Omotenashi services in actual environment
grasp multiplex status of a user, causing no problem in the
issues above.
Gaits vary with user states [10]. We focus on gaits which
have positional information as well as are good at shielding.
To detect gaits, it is required to grasp accurate positions
where the user foots ground. Cho et al. get precise positional
information for mobile robot localization with RFID [11].
Wang et al. use hybrid RFID systems to position pedestrians
[12]. According to these studies, an RFID can detect accurate
positional information. However, it is not studied to detect gaits
and to estimate the user status using RFID.

GAIT MEASUREMENT WITH RFID
A. Gait Vector
We aim at realizing a system to provide Omotenashi
services using RFID. Figure 1 shows how the system works in
an actual environament. The system provides services suitable
for the current status estimated for every user. An RFID reader
and an RFID tag costs about 20 US dollars and several US
cents for each, respectively. Our system has high scalability,
because the range of our positioning system depends on only
the density of RFID tags installed on ﬂoors. We assume a
shopping mall lends customers readers they wear like anklets,
as well as installs tags on areas such as a part of the main
street and spaces in front of show windows. Services suitable
for each user status make users comfortable, when they are
provided before the users request. It realizes Omotenashi
services. It leads to acquisition of repeaters and new customers.
If every shop installs tags in front of their show windows, it can
calculate the degree of attention of users to their merchandise.
Understanding constituency, they can improve their services.
In this paper, we estimate user status from a gait, using
RFID. Figure 2 shows our method. RFID readers get chrono-
logical foot prints based on the foot landing position. 19-
dimensional features compose a gait vector for each foot print.
Suppose a learner on a computer, which takes gait vectors
measured with the RFID system. We train the learner so that
it identiﬁes user status. Since there are individual differences
in gaits, a learner is trained for each user.
B. Detection of landing position
RFID is a short-range wireless communication technology
consisting of a tag with a unique ID and a reader to detect
Figure 2. User Status Estimating System
Figure 3. Localization system using RFID
the ID [13]. We use the HF-band RFID technology whose
communication distance is several centimeters.
The proposed method uses 45 mm×45 mm square-type
RFID tags. It prepares a tag sheet paved with the RFID tags
every 50 mm vertically and horizontally. It assumes the tag
sheets cover the ﬂoor of a speciﬁc area. A user wearing an
RFID reader on the point 5.0 cm away from the toe walks
on the tag sheets as depicted in Figure 3. A unique ID
detected by the RFID reader is transformed into the coordinates
representing the user position in the area. When the user walks,
the coordinates are obtained chronologically.
C. Clustering
The sample rate of the reader is 0.20-0.25 seconds per
detection. Generally, the walking speed and a stride is approx-
imately 4.0 km per hour and 1.2-1.8 m [14], respectively. It
takes one stride about 1.1-1.6 seconds. The sample rate is high
enough to detect it, even if the walking speed has changed
up to 5 times faster than the normal one. Depending on the
direction in which the reader approaches the tag, more than
one tag may be detected in the one step. To understand this
reason, let us consider the movement of a foot. Its landing to
or rising from the ground at a moderate angle makes some
tags meet the communication range. Plural coordinates should
be treated as one record, if they correspond to one step. We
cluster more than one coordinates corresponding to one step
with the Ward method [15], which is a hierarchical cluster
analysis method using the ratio of the variance within and
between groups. Here, to ﬁnd one step, we cut out a cluster
whose centroid is away by a speciﬁc distance from that of
the cluster corresponding to the previous step. It allows us
to cluster coordinates even if a user takes various steps at a
constant interval. We refer to clusters generated by the Ward
method as step clusters.

D. Feature Components of the Gait
It is assumed that the user status causes changes in gaits
as follows.
Because of heavy luggage,
•
Position of the center of gravity is not stable.
•
Walking Direction is deviated.
•
Walking speed gets slower.
Because of fatigue,
•
Stride gets smaller.
•
Walking speed gets slower.
•
Landing time of the foot gets extended.
Because of low attention,
•
Walking speed gets slower.
•
Walking Direction is deviated.
•
Landing time of the foot gets extended.
This paper deﬁnes a gait vector, which presents features
of gaits, to identify the user status. We calculate the walking
time, the number of detection, the deviation, the direction, the
landing period, the stride, and the velocity from recent N step
clusters in a ﬁxed interval. The walking time, wt, is difference
between the start point, tb, and the end point, te, of detected
time.
wt = te − tb
(1)
We consider cw(i) as the j-th detected tag in the i-th detected
step cluster. We regard ng(i) as the number of detection of tags
in cw(i). The total number of detection, wnd, is calculated as
follows.
wnd =
N
∑
i=1
ng(i)
(2)
We assume the proceeding direction of the user is the positive
direction of the y-axis, and the direction turning clockwise it
90 degrees is the positive direction of the x-axis. We refer to
(gx(i, j), gy(i, j)) as a detected coordinate. When a user walks
stably, gx(i, j) = 0. Deviation, gdev, is the standard deviation
of the x-coordinate.
gdev =
√∑
x
∑
y
gx(i, j)2
(3)
Let us consider slope a of the regression line, regarding the
x-coordinate as the explanatory variables and the y-coordinate
as the objective variables. In cw(i), let the ﬁrst tag is detected
at time gt(i, b) and the last one at gt(i, e). The landing period,
gt(i), is calculated as follows;
gt(i) = gt(i, e) − gt(i, b)
(4)
Here, we consider the following distance values to calculate a
stride and the walking speed.
ww1: Cluster center-to-center distance between the current step
and the next step.
ww2: Distance of the landing position between the current step
and the next step.
ww3: Distance of the rising position between the current step
and the next step.
ww4: Distance between the current landing position and the
rising position of the next step.
Figure 4. Detail of Step Cluster
ww5: Distance between the current landing position and the
rising position of the next step.
Figure 4 shows details of a step cluster.
We calculate distances between the n-th step cluster and
(n+1)-th one. ww1(i) is an Euclidean distance between coor-
dinates which has central time. ww2(i) is an Euclidean distance
between coordinates which has minimum time. ww3(i) is an
Euclidean distance between coordinates which has maximum
time. ww4(i) is an Euclidean distance between a coordinate
which has minimum time of the n-th step cluster and a coor-
dinate which has maximum time of the (n+1)-th one. ww5(i)
is an Euclidean distance between a coordinate which has
maximum time of the n-th step cluster and a coordinate which
has minimum time of the (n + 1)-th one. We also consider
the following velocity values using distance values. wv1 is a
velocity between coordinates which has central time. wv2 is a
velocity between coordinates which has minimum time. wv3
is a velocity between coordinates which has maximum time.
n is related from 1 to 3.
wvn =
∑N−1
1
wwn(i)
wt
(5)
After we calculate both of the right foot gait vector and the
left foot one, we combine them to a single gait vector.
E. Learning and Identiﬁcation
We examine relationships of the gait vector to the user
status. We distinguish features of a gait to identify the user
status with the machine learning method, Random Forest (RF)
[16]. RF is a group learning method using a tree model,
and it is suitable for analysis of the case containing many
explanatory variables. RF has two steps, the learning step
and the identiﬁcation step. In the learning step, it creates tree
models from pairs of a gait vector and a user status presented
as an instruction signal. In the identiﬁcation step, it identiﬁes
the user status corresponding to a new gait vector through the
tree model generated in the learning step.

POSSIBILITY OF DETECTION OF USE STATUS
A. Experimental Purpose and Overview
We experiment to identify 4 kinds of user status discussed
in chapter 2 from the disturbance of a gait while walking.
In the experiment, we use ASI4000USB which is an HF band
(13.56 MHz) RFID reader. Its communication distance is about
3.0 cm. We use Tag-It HF-I as an RFID tag. The threshold of
clustering shown in session 3.C is 100. Subjects are 11 males
and 3 females whose age ranges from 21 to 24. Each of them
wears an RFID reader on the point 5.0 cm away from the
toe. We install tag sheets on the ﬂoor as shown in Section
3.B. The RFID reader attached to each shoe is connected to a
laptop PC with USB cables. The walking range is 10.0 m×0.6
m. Among it, the range where tags are installed is 6.0 m×0.6
m, excluding 2.0 m in the both sides as Figure 5 shows. We

Figure 5. Experimental Environment
record gaits during the following 5 kinds of behavior before
and after the physical fatigue uniformly brought by an exercise
presented in Section 4.B. We repeat this trial 50 times.
SN
Walking with no stress.
SLB
Walking with two packages of luggage of 5.0 kg
held in both hands.
SLO
Walking with luggage of 5.0 kg held in the right
hand.
ST
Texting while walking, watching a Web site on a
smartphone.
SA
Walking with paying attention to a signage in the
middle of the walking range.
Each subject takes a rest for about 30 minutes after each trial.
The number of data acquisition per day is less than 100 times
to prevent fatigue from affecting on a speciﬁc person. After
the experiment, we ask the subjects what action is the most
uncomfortable.
B. Uniform Fatigue
To artiﬁcially make subjects run into a physical fatigue
state (SF ), uniformly in each trial, we impose the following
exercise on them. We use the exercise intensity calculated
from Karvonen method using the heart rate as a measure
of SF [6]. For a subject at age a, the maximum heart rate
(M) is calculated with (220 − a). The stable heart rate (R) is
measured after a rest for 30 minutes. The real-time heart rate
(C) is measured while walking. The exercise intensity (H) is
calculated every second with
H = C − R
M − R × 100
(6)
Subjects go up and down the stairs at a pace of two steps per
second, calculating H every second. They repeat this exercise
until the value of H exceeds 60 in total 600 times.
C. Result
We divide input data into 10 groups to take 10-fold cross-
validation. We train RF with 9 groups, while measure its
performance with 1 group. We evaluate the performance with
the F-measure (f) calculated from the precision (p) and the
recall (r). The following equation shows how to calculate f.
f = 2 · p · r
p + r
(7)
The trained RF classiﬁer distinguishes 5 kinds of behavior:
SN, SLB, SLO, ST , and SA . It also discriminates SF and
other user status corresponding to SNF . We show the result
in Table I and Table II.
In the upper part of Table I, the table head shows an
actual behavior, while each row shows the number of correct

classiﬁcation. The result reveals the user status is classiﬁed
fairly correctly.
After experiment, 11 of 14 subjects have told SLO is
the most uncomfortable behavior. In spite of the opinion, the
uncomfortable behavior does not have the highest classiﬁcation
rate. It implies there are not obvious features in the gait even if
the user feels strong discomfort. In Table I, many misclassiﬁed
cases are found within the group of (SN, SLB, SLO) and the
group of (ST , SA). It leads features of SN, SLB, and SLO
are similar, as well as features of ST and SA are similar.
Through the comparison of the classiﬁcation result in Table
II, the classiﬁcation is more successful in women. It implies
women is likely to show more fatigue features in their gaits
than men.
Let us consider the importance of each component of
a gait vector in Table III. We simpliﬁed the mean and the
standard deviation as M and SD for each. wv1, wv2, wv3, and
wt are higher than the mean in the classiﬁcation among the
5 kinds of behavior. The standard deviation of the variable
importance is also large for the 5 kinds of behavior. It
implies these are important components for classiﬁcation. In
the discrimination between SNF and SF , wv1, gdev, and some
of other importance are higher than average. However, standard

Figure 7. Average and standard deviation of each component
deviation is not large. It indicates each component shows the
physical fatigue. Let us discuss each component through the
correlation analysis. It is obvious that each stride has strong
correlation with the walking time. Excluding these ones, Figure
6 compares combinations of 2 gait vector elements, which has
correlation higher than 0.8 or lower than -0.8. In the ﬁgure,
the symbols from A to J stand for the combinations shown
in Table 4. In addition, Figure 7 shows the average and the
standard deviation of each component value for all subjects.
Let us discuss every behavior compared with behavior SN
where no load is imposed on subjects. SLB shows negative cor-
relation between wt and wv1, and positive correlation among
wv1, M of ww1(i), SD of ww1(i), and a. Compared with
SN, SLB has no difference in average and standard deviation
except M of ww1(i), which means each step gets shorter.
These imply subjects slow down with shorter walking cycle.
SLO shows negative correlation between wt and wv1. It has no
difference in average and standard deviation from SN. These
imply SLO is similar to SN. However, Table I indicates SLO
is distinguished from SN fairly well. It seems each subject
feels load in an individual way. ST has positive correlation
among wv1, M of ww1(i), SD of ww1(i), and a as well as
positive correlation among wt, wnd, M of gt(i), and SD of
gt(i). In cases of ST where subjects are texting while walking,
the standard deviation of some components is much larger
than others. It means the walking way varies with persons.
The correlation means subjects take smaller strides and longer
landing duration when they slow down. SA shows negative
correlation between wt and wv1, while positive correlation
between wt and wnd. The average and the standard deviation
of strides are smaller than others in SA. These imply subjects
slow down with smaller and ﬁxed strides which increase their
stepping. SF has positive correlation among wv1, wnd and M
of gt(i), and positive correlation among wv1, Mofww1(i),
SD of ww1(i), and a. The observation implies subjects slow
down with smaller strides. We can identify each behavior of
the user status, if we check the characteristics discussed above.
V.
GAIT DIFFERENCE BY WAY OF CARRYING LUGGAGE
A. Experimental Purpose and Overview
Let us see whether some features appear on gaits when
people are forced to have luggage with uncomfortable way by
some external factors. We examine features of gait vectors
under various way of carrying luggage or various feelings
of subjects while carrying luggage. Subjects are 1 male and
11 females, whose age ranges from 19 to 22 years old.
Experimental conditions are same as session 4.A. We record
gaits under the following 3 kinds of behavior.
SLH
Walking with luggage of 4.0 kg holding in the
right hand.
SLE
Walking with luggage of 4.0 kg slinging over the
right arm.
SLS
Walking with luggage of 4.0 kg slinging on the
right shoulder.
Every subject takes each kind of behavior 10 times, interleav-
ing 5 minute break. We have inquired of the subjects what
action makes them most comfortable and most uncomfortable.
B. Classiﬁcation
We have classiﬁed 3 kinds of behavior in the same way as
section 4.C. The result reveals we can identify each behavior
roughly.The F-measure values of SLH, SLE, and SLS are
0.599, 0.516, and 0.562, respectively. The standard deviation
of the F-measure among subjects is 0.17804. It implies there
is big difference in each individual. As for the importance of
components, 2 groups are found; gdev and wv1 are high in one
group, while gdev and M of ww1(i) is high in the other. The
3 variables, gdev, wv1, and M of ww1(i), are important for
identiﬁcation. According to the interview after the experiment,
all subjects feel SLH and SLE uncomfortable (5 subjects and
7 subjects), while SLS comfortable (12 subjects) for each.

SENSORDEVICES 2015 : The Sixth International Conference on Sensor Device Technologies and Applications

We divide SLH and SLE from SLS to make the two groups,
uncomfortable one and comfortable one, respectively. Let us
classify the two groups with gait features. Because of the
difference of the number of cases in each group, we randomly
sample 100 cases. The F-measure values of uncomfortable one
and comfortable one are 0.679 and 0.657 for each.
The result implies we can classify each behavior. The
importance of components are high at gdev, wv1, and M
of ww1(i). The way to carry luggage affects gaits, which
enables us to guess how subjects feel when walking. In
addition, behavior a in this experiment corresponds to SLO
in the former experiment. We can distinguish uncomfortable
behavior from other kinds of behavior. The interview indicates
subjects feel the least load on the body, if they carry luggage
slinging on shoulder. The number of sample data might be the
reason of variance in the classiﬁcation. It might be caused by
subjects carrying luggage in an unusual way. The importance
of components suggests the center of gravity of the body is
not stable by the luggage. It seems they slow down or change
their steps to ease their uncomfortable feelings.
VI.
DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have mentioned the problems of cost,
classiﬁcation ability, and so on in section 2. An RFID reader
is about 20 US dollars and a RFID tag is several US cents
for each. Our system has high scalability, because the range
of our positioning system depends on only RFID tags. The ex-
periment has revealed we can identify all kinds of user status,
and whether the user is carrying luggage with uncomfortable
way at a certain range, using only the RFID system. If our
system is installed in the shopping mall, we can grasp the
customer status to provide Omotenashi services suitable for
each of them. We assume the shopping mall lends customers
a pair of readers, and install tags at some areas like a part of
major streets or spaces in front of show windows. Stores in the
shopping mall can also easily install the RFID tags, because
it is relatively at low cost, and we only have to install them in
a speciﬁc area of each store.
Since we can know the status of customers from their
gaits, we can provide suitable services for each status. We
propose the following services for each status. In case of
behavior SLB, carrying luggage with both hands, subjects tune
various components of the gait vector. It means customers
accommodate themselves to the load of luggage. To make
the enduring time short, the system should recommend the
shortest way to their destination. On the other hand, subjects
tune few components of the gait vector in SLO, carrying
luggage with one hand. It is too high load for them to carry
luggage. The system should recommend to take rests at cafes
near them, or to ride on vehicles. The system should call
their attention to avoid accidents in advance when they are
in ST , texting, and SA, low attention. The system provides
details of the advertisement customers look at when they are
in SA. Recommendation like SLO is preferable when they
are is in SF , fatigue. Customers experience the high level
of satisfaction, which lead to increase of customers. In the
experiments, subjects are only their age of 20s. However,
features of gaits are not different between 20s and 60s [17].
In addition, the rate of foreign visitors to Japan consists of
17.7% men of 30s, 13.5% women of 20s, 13.0% men of 40s,
and 12.8% men of 20s [2]. Our method based on gaits covers
many visitors to Japan.
VII.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed the method to provide
customers high quality Omotenashi services using their gait
pattern acquired with the RFID technology. In experiment,
we have proved the method identiﬁes the state of users from
features of their gait. In addition, we have shown we can
ﬁnd out users carrying luggage in unusual ways. However,
to classify the state of carrying luggage accurately, we need
to train the system individually. We must consider accuracy
improvement and generalization from individual as future
works. In addition, we consider the RFID readers shape and
more speciﬁc services.
