over a Rayleigh fading channel and analyze end-to-end outage 
probabilities.

 INTRODUCTION 
Cooperative diversity has received considerable attention in 
recent years to increase the reliability of wireless networks. 
This technique uses one or more relay nodes to forward signals 
transmitted from the source node to the destination node [1]. 
Various schemes have been proposed to achieve cooperative 
diversity, such as amplify-and-forward (AF) and/or decode-
and-forward (DF) schemes [2]-[8]. In this paper, we focus on 
the DF relaying, in which each relay node fully decodes, re-
encodes, and then retransmits the source signals.  
Approximations of the outage probabilities for a single-
relay case were provided in [2] for a high signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) and in [3] for a low SNR. For a multiple-relay case, 
approximate and exact expressions of the outage probabilities 
based on distributed space-time coding cooperative schemes 
[2] were presented in [4], [5] and [6]. A best-relay selection 
scheme (BRSS), which has a simple cooperative diversity 
scheme in a multiple-relay scenario, was proposed in [7], 
where the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the BRSS was 
identical to that of the more complex distributed space-time 
coding cooperative schemes presented in [2]. For the BRSS, 
exact expression of the outage probability was provided in [8]. 
In this paper, we propose a cooperative diversity scheme to 
improve the end-to-end outage performance via Alamouti 
space-time block coding (STBC) with two transmit antennas at 
a source node in the backward link and the BRSS in a forward 
link from the relay nodes to the destination node. We derive an 
exact closed-form expression of the outage probability for the 
proposed scheme over a Rayleigh fading channel and analyze 
the end-to-end outage probability compared to the BRSS.  
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we present 
the outage probability for the proposed scheme. Numerical 
results are presented in Section III, and the final section gives 
the conclusions. 
II. 
OUTAGE PROBABILITY 
We consider a half-duplex dual-hop communication 
scenario, where direct path is assumed to be blocked or to 
have poor connection due to an intermediate wall. In this case, 
the communication between a source node S and a destination 
node D is only possible via M relay nodes. We also assume 
that the channel is a Rayleigh fading channel with coherence 
time long enough for the system to complete transmitting a 
block of data. 
The BRSS transmission between the source node S and 
destination node D is established during two time slots. In the 
first time slot, the source node S transmits the data to the M 
relay nodes. After the M relay nodes decode the data from the 
source node S, the selected relay node k among all the M relay 
nodes forwards the re-encoded data to the destination node D 
in the second time slot.  
The mutual information of the BRSS between the source 
node S and the relay node k,

In order to improve the end-to-end outage performance, we 
propose a cooperative diversity scheme via Alamouti STBC 
with two transmit antennas at the source node S in the 
backward link and the BRSS in the forward link. The 
proposed scheme can obtain an additional transmit diversity 
gain in the backward link from two transmit antennas at the 
source node S. The proposed communication between the 
source node S and the destination node D is performed during 
four time slots without loss of rate.  
In the first two time slots, the source node S transmits the 
two space-time block coded symbols to the M relay nodes. 
After the M relay nodes decode the two space-time block 
coded symbols from the source node S, the selected relay node 
k among all the M relay nodes forwards the two re-encoded 
symbols to the destination node D in the remaining two time 
slots. Then, the maximum instantaneous end-to-end mutual 
information of the proposed scheme is

In Figure 1, we illustrate the outage probabilities of the 
proposed scheme and the BRSS, when M = 2, 4, and 10, 
respectively. This figure shows that the proposed scheme 
outperforms the BRSS on the outage probabilities. When M = 
2, 4, and 10 relays are employed under the assumed channel 
condition, the proposed scheme outperforms the BRSS at the 
outage probability of 10-4 by 2.95 dB, 2.38 dB, 1.13 dB, 
respectively. This is because the proposed scheme can obtain 
the additional transmit diversity gain in the backward link 
from two transmit antennas at the source node S.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we proposed a cooperative diversity scheme 
with DF relaying to improve the end-to-end outage 
performance via Alamouti STBC with two transmit antennas 
at the source node. We derived an exact closed-form 
expression of the outage probability for the proposed scheme 
over a Rayleigh fading channel and analyzed the end-to-end 
probability compared to the BRSS. From the results, it was 
confirmed that end-to-end outage probability of the proposed 
scheme outperformed the BRSS in wireless cooperative 
networks.
