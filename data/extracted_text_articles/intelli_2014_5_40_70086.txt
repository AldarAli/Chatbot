Abstract—The paper presents a technology of crowdsourc-
ing organization that is considered to provide optimal solutions 
of complicated intelligent problems from large group of experts. 
This approach is developed as an extension of the Evolutionary 
Solutions Coordination method; it supposes dividing entire ex-
pert group into small ones and automatically defining best ex-
perts on each iteration to form the most competent groups on 
further iterations. Finally, the group of the most competent ex-
perts gives full and the most rational solution. The paper also 
presents an experiment on the Eysenck’s tests solving. It demon-
strates significant superiority of self-managed crowdsourcing 
over individual solution approach. 
Keywords—crowdsourcing; 
collective 
intelligence; 
coordination; generation; estimation; election; social. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Growth of the Internet and evolution of web technologies 
gave birth to a new kind of collective interaction of the web 
users – crowdsourcing, which means creating needed solu-
tions, ideas and other intellectual products with contribution 
of large number of people, usually Internet users. This term 
was first used by the journalist Jeff Howe [1]. In Russia, this 
technology is developed by a young company Witology per-
formed a set of considerable projects for Russian economy 
[2]. Unfortunately, according to experience of crowdsourcing 
practice, the technology is rather spendy, it requires usage of 
expensive software, large calculation resources and numerous 
project coordinators, so called facilitators [3], it makes the 
technology almost unreachable for small companies and cer-
tain Internet users, who also may represent interesting social 
projects. 
The technology of Self-managed Crowdsourcing present-
ed in this paper does not have these disadvantages. It utilizes a 
special algorithm that is able to coordinate collective solution 
search automatically, without human intervention [4]. 
The first section of the paper deals with theoretical basics 
of the presented algorithm. It explains the logic of three-cycle 
scheme step by step.  In the next section the theory of self-
managed crowdsourcing is presented. After that some exper-
imental results will be provided. The experiment considers a 
group of students that solve IQ tests using the provided theo-
ry. The last section gives a conclusion upon the described 
experiment. 
II. THREE-CYCLE SCHEME OF CROWDSOURCING 
Papers on crowdsourcing state that group solution can sig-
nificantly overcome individual results if there is good algo-
rithmic platform of collective work organization [5]. Method 
of Evolutionary Solutions Coordination described by Protasov 
et al. in [6] can be used as a kind of crowdsourcing approach 
on large experts number. Therefore, there is a need to develop 
such a collaboration technology that leads the number of co-
ordination steps to minimum. 
According to the procedure of Evolutionary Solutions Co-
ordination, in order to minimize coordination steps number, 
the following organization of self-managed crowdsourcing 
can be considered. On the first cycle, each expert fills slots of 
the projects with his own proposals. On the second cycle, bas-
ing on predefined regular graph [7] of connections experts 
receive others’ solutions and fill up empty slots of their own 
solutions with received variants that seem correct in their 
view [8]. On the third cycle, for each slot of the project, the 
value chosen by greater than a half of experts is considered as 
the group’s choice. The group’s solution is formed of such 
slots’ values. 
Of course, on the first cycle, it is desirable to provide 
equiprobable slots filling. Regular graph is applicable for this 
task because there is only iteration of solutions coordination 
and random genetic-like expert pairs selection is not neces-
sary. It is also noticeable that each cycle is performed by all 
experts concurrently and the operation time does not depend 
on their quantity. 
The obtained results are also significant for the artificial 
intelligence construction of large number of uniform modules, 
e. g., neurons cluster or primitive computers forming homo-
geneous environment. 
The scheme of three-cycle coordination is illustrated on 
Fig. 1. 
III. THE TECHNOLOGY OF SELF-MANAGED CROWDSOURCING 
Let us consider the Evolutional Coordination Method ap-
plication based on social web-platform – an Internet site con-
structed specially for organizing crowdsourcing technology. 
The number of experts is not defined previously. Collective 
work can be described as follows. The experts registered on 
the site form small groups, e. g., 10 people each group. Each 
expert is provided with a predefined project task and an in-
struction which contains his groupmate list for sending initial 
ideas and time interval allotted for ideas generation. After 
finishing the first stage and receiving other users’ solutions for 
expertise, the experts perform an estimation of the received 
solutions. All slots’ values which seem correct for them are 
copied to their own solutions. After the received variants es-
timation and slots filling, all solutions are saved on the site. 
Then, the special program, Project Moderator, picks out best

experts (ones with greatest estimation ability in a group) from 
all groups and allocates them into new groups. These groups 
are given the best variants of previous expert generation and 
estimation cycle is repeated. Further, the best experts are se-
lected again from these groups; the process proceeds until the 
best final group is selected among experts, and they obtain the 
last and the most fully defined solution.  
Such scheme of crowdsourcing organization induces self-
managed processes of the best experts distinguishing and ob-
taining the best solution with small number of iterations. Ex-
isting crowdsourcing schemes widely utilize such technology 
with inviting large groups of human moderators. This makes 
projects very expensive. But, the technology described in this 
paper supposes to entrust the coordination work to a program. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF SELF-MANAGED 
CROWDSOURCING TECHNOLOGY  
In order to test the self-manged crowdsourcing technolo-
gy, some experiments in Internet were carried out. 7 groups of 
students consisting of 3 to 7 people participated in the exper-
iments. Eysenck intellect testing with predefined test exam-
ples was selected as a test task [9]. It included 50 questions 
where the answers were single keywords. The experiment was 
hold according to the crowdsourcing technology described 
above. Students registered beforehand on the site of the pro-
ject and were united into groups of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5 and 7 people 
(see the Table 2). According to the Eysenck methodology 
each group was given 30 minutes to complete the test, the 
time intervals allocated for the first and second cycles were 
defined depending on a group size: 18 minutes for 7 and 24 
minutes for 3 people for the first cycle – the time varies be-
cause more experts need more time for coordination stage. 
The table contains competence data of all experts: slots 
number filled on first and second cycles, competence in gen-
eration and estimation, forecast of correct answers number 
(N), IQ level calculated by the Eysenck’s formula       
     and the Intellectual Potential (IP), where IP is defined 
by the formula 
 
       
  
(1) 
where M, for certain expert, is the number of experts with 
the same competence (both generative and estimative) that 
provides full solution with probability 0.999. 
Analyzing the table, it’s easy to descry that IP distribution 
has considerably greater dispersion then that of IQ level. In 
this example it vary from 1.5 to 144.7 while IQs of corre-
sponding experts equal 104 and 165. Since IP shows more 
correctly the certain expert’s contribution to overall work, it 
can be deduced that estimation of experts only by IQ gives 
undeserved advantage to less smart ones. Table 1 illustrates 
full results of expert groups work. It contains a number of 
slots filled on the second cycle, portion of filled slots after 
first and second cycles and IQ level for each group.

According 
to 
the 
technology 
of 
Self-managed 
Crowdsourcing, on final cycle the group of experts with the 
best competence in solutions estimation was selected from the 
whole set of experts. They interchanged their solutions and 
complemented each other. After the coordination cycle, for 
the final solution, the slots presented in most experts’ solu-
tions were distinguished to form the final solution. The results 
are presented in the last row of the Table 1. On the last cycle 
of the experiment selected group of the best experts obtained 
full solution – all questions of the test were answered. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Finally, the first cycle of the Self-managed Crowdsourc-
ing includes the creation of population of correctly filled 
slots. After second cycle, many experts experience consider-
able growth of correctly filled slots, but most experts correct 
answers portion is still low and the group has not yet filled all 
the slots of the projects. Only small group of leaders has es-
timative ability greater than 0.5, they actually have overcome 
the Condorcet’s border [10]. These very leaders formed the 
final group that obtained full solution on the last cycle. Tak-
ing into account that Eysenck’s tests are constructed with 
consideration of impossibility to solve them fully in given 
time it can be concluded that expert groups under Self-
managed Crowdsourcing technology have done an impossi-
ble.
