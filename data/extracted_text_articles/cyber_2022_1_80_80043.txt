Abstract—The rapid development in Internet Services led 
to a significant increase in cyber-attacks. The need to secure 
systems 
and 
operations 
has 
become 
apparent 
as 
cybersecurity has become a global concern. Cybersecurity 
involves techniques that protect and control systems, 
networks, hardware, software, and electronic data from 
unauthorized access. Developing an effective and innovative 
defensive 
mechanism 
is 
an 
urgent 
requirement as 
conventional 
cybersecurity 
solutions 
are 
becoming 
inadequate in safeguarding information against cyber 
threats. There is a need for cybersecurity methods that are 
capable of making real-time decisions and respond to cyber-
attacks. To support this, researchers are focusing on 
approaches like Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve cyber 
defense. This study provides an overview   of existing 
research on cybersecurity, using AI technologies. AI 
technologies made a remarkable contribution in combating 
cybercrimes with significant improvement in anomaly 
intrusion detection.

 INTRODUCTION  
The 
rapid 
development 
in 
Information 
and 
Communication 
Technology 
(ICT) 
created 
positive 
implication to the global economy. The internet has 
improved the quality of life by providing a platform that 
facilitates 
knowledge 
sharing, 
communication 
and 
interaction, which is important for development and daily 
life [1]. In view of the benefits, the dark side abound. Cyber 
criminals exploit the vulnerability of individuals and 
organizations [2]. Providing security for systems have 
become difficult. Hackers are becoming smarter and more 
innovative in exploiting individuals and organizations. With 
cyber-attacks and data breaches coming to light daily, cyber- 
attacks have been ranked among the top 5 most likely 
sources of severe global risk [3]. Cyber fraud has become 
complex to track as cyber theft can originate from any part of 
the world. Organizations have become challenged with the 
complexity of cyber-attacks which calls for the adoption of 
intelligent methods like AI to mitigate them. AI is a thriving 
field that has been deployed in application areas such as 
manufacturing [4], healthcare [5], education [6], agriculture 
[7] and Cybersecurity. According to Abraham et al. [8], AI 
algorithms can predict previously seen and unseen attacks, it 
is effective in detecting cyber-attacks with low false alarm 
rate.  Advancement in AI have produced technologies that 
can learn from past patterns to improve future experiences. 
Researchers 
and 
developed 
countries 
have 
adopted 
cybersecurity solutions like AI to improve cyber defense [9]. 
Some existing studies have discussed and summarized 
cybersecurity issues. To the best of my knowledge, none 
focused on AI in cybersecurity management systematically. 
Figure 1 summarized the key trends of events related to 
cybercrime over 2 decades as identified by Alqurashi [39]. 
Ransomware attacks have increased drastically over the last 
decade as illustrated. This article summarized progress in 
applying AI to tackle cybersecurity. The effectiveness of 
these solutions in detecting and preventing cyber-attacks is 
demonstrated. The remainder of this paper is structured as 
follows: Section II presents the background of study and 
related work. Section III presents the review methodology 
used to conduct the study. Section IV presents findings on AI 
in cybersecurity. Section V discusses future direction of AI 
in cybersecurity management. Section VI presents the 
research validation, limitation and concludes the paper.

BACKGROUND LITERATURE 
A. 
Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity 
      With persistent cyber threats and advanced cyber-attacks 
emerging, cybersecurity researchers agree that information 
security is important. Consequently, a number of studies 
attempted addressing information security by adopting 
improved techniques such as anomaly intrusion detection 
and prevention systems, firewall setups and data encryption 
algorithms. Although some studies have argued that 
cybersecurity can be effectively tackled by focusing on 
human behavior. However, others argued that human 
behavior alone is insufficient.

For instance, the volume of information handled by 
organizations calls for automation. Hence the need for 
balance between humans and technology in organizational 
security activities. Conventional cybersecurity approaches 
depend on tedious and manual processes, they rely on 
detect and respond measures that can’t keep pace with the 
volume and velocity of current threats. Furthermore, the 
first generation of antivirus were designed to identify virus 
by scanning its bit signature, the assumption of this concept 
is that virus has the same structure and bit pattern in all 
instances. These signatures are fixed. Although the catalog 
of signatures are updated when devices are connected to 
internet network, the regular release of sophisticated 
malwares make this approach ineffective. The introduction 
of signature-less approaches that are capable of detecting 
and mitigating cyber-threats using newer methods such as 
AI and behavioral detections have been argued to be 
effective. 
Advancements in AI applications made it possible to 
design an effective and efficient system that automatically 
detect and prevent malicious activities in cyberspace. 
These advancements have been adopted to support existing 
technologies as they provide mechanisms that better 
prevent and control cyber-attacks. ˙In view of all the 
benefits AI provides, emerging cyber threats make it 
extremely difficult for researchers to identify the most 
efficient technique and its impact in cyberspace. The 
general perception among researchers suggest that AI has 
improved information security. To the best of our 
knowledge, these claims has not been substantiated. 
Existing studies have either demonstrated how their 
innovation outperformed a selection of existing methods or 
a sample of systems that compare algorithms to access 
their performance. Accordingly, a literature review is 
required to provide summary on issues, challenges and 
future research direction.

B. Related Work 
        Several existing studies have reviewed literatures on 
AI in cybersecurity management. For instance, Chan et al. 
[47] described the intrusion detection ability of AI while 
identifying false positives and using predictive analysis for 
storing data. Although their study provides meaningful 
insights to help people understand AI better, it is not 
systematic in presenting discussions. Li [48] summarized the 
intersection of AI and cybersecurity by reviewing the use of 
AI related algorithms. Their study classified AI applications 
and contributions as promising for integrated cybersecurity. 
However, the method used for the survey was not defined, it 
is open to bias, and therefore their survey cannot claim to be 
systematic when compared with guidelines proposed by 
Kitchenham et al. [50]. 
Waife et al. [51] conducted a systematic mapping 
review of AI for cybersecurity using quantitative and 
qualitative methods to analyze several articles. AI made a 
significant contribution in combating cybercrimes with 
improvement in false alarm rate for Intrusion Detection 
Systems (IDS). Al- though the study provides meaningful 
insights to researchers, the articles selection process was 
limited to the IEEE and ACM digital libraries. Therefore, 
their findings cannot be generalized. Sarker et al. [52] 
surveyed popular AI-driven cybersecurity concepts for 
protecting inter-connected systems from cyber-threat. The 
survey revealed that expert systems are used to tackle 
cybersecurity issues like unauthorized access intelligently, 
they explained the importance of intelligent cybersecurity 
management but failed to present an overview of trends in

REVIEW METHODOLOGY 
PRISMA, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) 
protocol, is used in this paper to obtain insight on the 
application of AI in cybersecurity management as proposed 
by Kitchenham et al. [50]. PRISMA is a SLR that uses a 
well-defined methodology to identify, evaluate, and 
interprete relevant research by using unbiased, trustworthy, 
rigorous and repeatable methodology. By using PRISMA, 
the research method can be replicated. A set of keywords 
were used to identify studies related to AI in cybersecurity 
management through several database search engines. 
Keywords used in the search are Artificial Intelligence, 
Cybersecurity, cyber threats and Information Security. 
The words were combined to form a search phrase, they 
are Artificial Intelligence and/or cybersecurity, cyber 
threats 
and/or 
cybersecurity, 
cyber 
threats and/or 
Information security. The viewpoint for the search was 
limited to studies published from 2018 to 2022. This 
allowed for consideration of the most recent articles. IEEE 
xplore digital library, science direct, Google Scholar and 
other sources were used to select several literatures as 
mentioned by Kitchenham et al. [50] as they make up the 
majority of   databases used for literature reviews. This was 
done to avoid bias and ensure that a wide database is 
covered in the selection process. 
250 articles were initially identified. All articles were 
sub- jected to inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify 
the state- of-the-art literature before analysis. Conference 
papers, jour- nals, and short papers etc. were all included. 
The wide search was to ensure that no relevant article 
was left out to avoid bias. Titles of articles that did not 
suggest the application of AI in cybersecurity management 
were excluded. Articles that are less than 4 pages and are 
written in languages other than English were also 
excluded. Abstracts that did not strongly discuss AI in 
cybersecurity were discarded to reduce bias in the selection 
process. In total, 67 articles were selected and included in 
the study. 
The process employed is illustrated in Figure 2, it is a 
diagrammatic representation of the review process. In 
addition to the rationale of the study, research questions 
were identified. The search strategy and data extraction are 
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. This is grouped 
into phases as suggested by Kitchenham et al. [50]. Review 
questions were formulated during the planning stage 
which forms the foundation for the study. The Goal 
Question Metric Approach (See Table 2) was adopted by 
Basili [35]. This approach has also been demonstrated by 
Yahya et al. [36] to be effective for eliciting the objectives 
of systematic reviews. This section gave a review of the 
methodology used to obtain insight into the application 
of AI in cybersecurity management.

IV. REVIEW OF FINDINGS ON AI IN CYBERSECURITY 
Information regarding the publication year, publication out 
lets with more than two articles on AI in cybersecurity and 
al- gorithms used was recorded. This study analyzed, 
summarized, and discussed the impact of existing methods. 
Below is the discussion of findings from the study. 
A. Publication Trends on AI in Cybersecurity 
 
The results in Figure 3 show that research publications on 
AI in cybersecurity have increased considerably. AI 
techniques started gaining rapid attention years before the 
viewpoint of this review (2018 to 2022), however from the 
year 2018, the margin of articles increased. The articles 
reviewed for the year 2018 accounted for 33% of the total 
selected articles for the primary study. The publications 
increased from 2019 to 2022. This indicates that studies on 
AI in cybersecurity management are increasing. The 
findings in Figure 4 indicate that publications are 
represented in different publishing outlets. Out of 67 articles 
on AI, 33 were published in IEEE Access journals and 
9 were published at IEEE transactions on Informatics 
Forensics and Security Journal. These publication outlets 
listed above accounted for 40% out of the total number. 
See Figure 4 for the chart on publication distribution 
according to publication outlets.

The chart presents outlets with more than two 
publications. The next publication outlet that recorded most 
articles is Science Direct which recorded 4 papers, Wiley 
and IEEE transaction on neural network & learning recorded 
3 articles each. The remaining publication outlets recorded 
two or less studies. Some were published in Transaction 
Signal Information Process over networks while other 
publications were recorded in books, conference papers and 
journals such as Engineering application for artificial 
Intelligence to mention a few. Similarly, it was observed 
that the research was skewed geographically. The address of 
the authors revealed that majority of the studies originated 
from countries in Asia. It can be deduced from Figure 
5 that 58% of the articles originated from Asia. China 
recorded the highest number of publications, followed by 
India. Sudan and Norway recorded one publication each. 
B. AI in Cybersecurity 
 
AI was proposed in 1956 by John McCarthy as a science 
concerned with making computers behave intelligently like 
humans [8]. AI application has evolved significantly, it has 
a plethora of benefits in education, biometric systems, 
Internet of Things and cybersecurity among others. AI 
algorithms contribute to solving security issues. The cost 
and average time of detection and response to cyber threats 
is greatly reduced with the intervention of AI [34]. Neural 
networks have been used to detect classifying data as 
normal and abnormal [30]. Swarm intelligence methods 
handles feature selection to identify new intrusions.

With AI, complexity and model training time is reduced 
[32]. AI is quickly becoming a tool for automating threat 
detection and responding effectively than conventional 
human driven methods which are unable to keep up with 
volumes of viruses generated daily [30]. AI is relevant in 
threat detection, intrusion detection, fraud detection and 
cybersecurity, it has increased the accuracy and speed of 
cyber response. The major disciplines in AI are fuzzy 
logic, natural language processing, deep learning, machine 
learning, computer vision and robotics.

C. AI as a Tool in Combating Cyber-attacks 
With the pace and increase in cyber-attacks, human in- 
tervention alone is insufficient for timely and appropriate 
response. AI technology is becoming very essential to 
information security. It is capable of analyzing millions of 
data to detect and prevent cyber threats. It can deduce patterns 
and identify abnormalities in a computer network 
expeditiously. AI technologies use behavioral analysis to 
identify and detect anomalies that are indicative of an attack 
[32]. This technology gathers large amount of data to 
identify suspicious behavior that might lead to cyber threat. 
Processing and analyzing massive amount of data in 
seconds, using AI algorithms makes prediction of cyber 
threats possible before they occur, it also predicts future data 
breaches. With AI breaches can be responded to immediately 
an attack is detected by responding anonymously without 
human intervention and also by sending alerts and creating 
defensive patches [33]. According to a report by Capgemini, 
the effort and cost of detecting and responding to cyber 
threats is lowered by 15% in some organizations with AI, 
as more data is analyzed. This technology learns from

E. Impact of AI in Cybersecurity Management 
AI presents advantages in several areas, cybersecurity 
being one of them. AI is considered as one of the promising 
technologies for tackling cyber threats. It is capable of 
analyzing millions of datasets to identify and prevent cyber-
attacks. The most significant contribution of AI is anomaly 
intrusion detection. To overcome cybersecurity issues, 
Vinayakumar et al. [10] proposed a highly scalable and 
hybrid deep neural network, to monitor network traffic and 
host level events that raise alert for unforeseen 
They employed distributed and parallel machine learning 
algorithms with optimization techniques, making them 
capable of handling volumes of network and computing 
resources. Their framework stood out due to scalability and 
real-time detection of malicious activities from early warning 
signals. To increase training speed and avert over fitting, 
batch normalization and dropout approach was used. Deep 
neural network performed well by detecting and classifying 
unforeseen and unpredictable cyber- attacks in real-time. 
Sokolov et al. [11] analyzed cybersecurity threats in 
cloud applications using deep learning techniques   to 
monitor data. Suricata engine and module based on Google 
tensor flow framework was used. They proposed a system 
that used neural classifiers for network traffic, spam 
comments, spam email and images. The suricata engine 
monitored network security and prevented intrusion in 
real-time. 
Fernandez et al. [12] explored a self-adaptive system for 
anomaly detection that identified cyber-threats in 5G mobile 
networks. Deep learning techniques was used to analyze 
network traffic by extracting features from network flows. 
The authors proposed a high-level cyber defense architecture 
consisting of virtualized infrastructure (VI), virtualized 
network function (VNF), management and orchestration 
(MANO), operations and business support systems. 
Anomaly symptom detection (ASD) and network anomaly 
detection (NAD) were proposed to achieve effective network 
anomaly detection. Once an anomaly is produced from 
traffic generated, it is communicated to the monitoring and 
diagnosis module. The experimental result showed that the 
architecture can self-adapt to anomaly detection based on the 
volume of network flow gathered from users in real-time. 
A botnet is one of the significant threats infecting 
devices today. Abraham et 
al. [8] compared the 
performance of five (5) Machine learning approaches and 
identified useful features to classify malicious traffic.

Random forest proved to be more robust, it could generalize 
unseen bots’ types. 
Intrusion detection technology is a mechanism that 
monitors and prevents system intrusion. Zhang et al. [13] 
introduced a multiple-layer representation learning model for 
accurate detection of network-based attack and proposed a 
new data encoding scheme based on P-Zigzag to encode 
network traffic into two-dimensional gray-scale images for 
representation. Comparing the combination of gcForest and 
CNN allowed detection of imbalanced data with fewer hyper 
parameters, which increased computational efficiency. The 
experimental results showed that the combined algorithms 
outperformed single deep learning methods in terms of 
accurate detection and false alarm rate, thereby demonstrating 
its effectiveness in attack detection. The authors proposed a 
new intrusion detection method by combining random 
forest and LSTM to address the above challenges. 
In view of the vast amount of data generated daily, and the 
increased interconnection of the internet infrastructure, 
Zhong et al. [14] proposed big data based on a hierarchical 
deep learning system that utilizes behavioral features. 
Companies can adapt it as a solution for the detection of 
intrusive attacks. The authors defined the hierarchical 
structure in five (5) phases. In the first phase, behavioral and 
content features are extracted using big data techniques. In 
the second phase, the dataset is separated into clusters, in the 
third phase, the root clusters of each sub tree is combined 
until the quality of the merged clusters dropped below the 
given threshold. In the fourth phase the deep learning model 
for each cluster was trained, while in the fifth phase, deep 
learning model was merged to select the most confident 
model. They concluded that it increased the detection rate of 
intrusive attacks when compared to a single model learning 
approach. Their strategy is effective in capturing data 
patterns for intrusive attacks. 
A. Dey [15] utilized a 2018 dataset and proposed the 
effectiveness 
of 
attention 
mechanism 
for 
intrusion 
detection based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
and LSTM model. The authors observed increased 
performance based on LSTM.  
    Dawoud et al.’s [16] concept is based on unsupervised 
deep learning for revealing network threats and detecting 
anomalies by evaluating the use of restricted Boltzmann 
machines. This intrusion detection system is used to expose 
network threat and protect network assets. Their simulation 
study showed 99% detection accuracy with significant 
improvement. 
Ishaque et al. [17] explored deep learning research by 
manipulating large amount of data using the functionality 
of computational intelligence. An important feature which 
the authors applied for dimensionality and attribute 
reduction is feature extraction. They concluded that the 
proposed system can detect attacks that are not 
hybridized. 
Distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack has been 
a real threat to cyber infrastructure that can bring down 
ICT infrastructure. Isa et al. [18] adopted deep learning to 
analyze traffic, focusing on mitigating cyber-attacks with 
machine 
learning. 
Assembly 
module 
for 
statistics 
collection and adaptive machine learning module for 
analyzing traffic and enforcing policies are the two main 
functionalities that was proposed. Auto encoder and 
random forest algorithm possessed an accuracy of 98.4% 
with a decreased amount of training and execution time. 
The result proved that the model is optimally efficient 
for real-time intrusion detection. 
Detecting cyber-attacks requires analyzing cyber-
threats to match potential attack profiles. Malicious 
connections were filtered to improve the accuracy of threat 
detection and reduce false-positive rates. Lin et al. [19] 
focused their study on network intrusion detection, using 
enhanced CNN based on Lenets 5 to classify network 
threats. The authors developed an improved behavior-
based model for anomaly detection by training a CNN to 
extract enhanced behavior features and identify threats. 
Their experiment showed overall prediction accuracy with 
97.53% intrusion detection rate. The proposed model 
improves the accuracy of intrusion detection for threat 
classification. 
Zeng et al. [20] proposed a Deep Full Range (DFR) 
framework comprising a network of encrypted traffic 
classification and intrusion detection. Three deep learning 
algorithms (CNN, LSTM and stack auto encoder SAE) were 
employed for traffic classification and intrusion detection. 
CNN was used to learn features of the raw traffic; LSTM 
was used to learn features from time-related aspects and SAE 
was used to extract   features from coding characteristics. The 
full range consists of three algorithms capable of classifying 
encrypted and malware traffic within one framework without 
human intervention. The authors proved that the DFR could 
attain a robust and accurate performance on both encrypted 
traffic classification and intrusion detection. 
Dey et al. [21] proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) - 
LSTM using Google’s tensor flow that provided options to 
visualize network design. Their analysis showed that GRU - 
LSTM provided high accuracy with low false alarm rate. 
When compared, GRU-LSTM showed a strong potential in 
terms of accuracy for anomaly detection. 
Hsu et al. [22] proposed a Deep Reinforcement 
Learning- based (DRL) for anomaly network intrusion 
detection. Their design revealed incoming network traffic 
by data sniffing and a pre-processing data module that 
checks the quality of data before it is fed for intrusion 
detection. This method can be adopted for self-updating 
and detecting abnormal incoming network traffic on real-
time basis in company websites. SVM and Random Forest

algorithms was utilized. They showed high anomaly 
detection accuracy and improved processing speed. 
Privacy protection and national security in the cyber 
world depends on safe cyberspace. Network intrusion is 
one of the sophisticated actors stemming from cyber-
threats. Sezari et al. [23] applied a deep feed forward 
network by modifying the parameters of the anomaly-
based 
network. 
Their 
result 
demonstrated 
better 
performance with less complexity and a low false alarm 
rate. Therefore, their model is trustworthy and can be used 
to prevent intruders. It can detect unknown attacks based on 
its network features. 
Naseer et al. [24] investigated the suitability of deep 
learning approaches for anomaly-based intrusion detection. 
They developed a model based on ANN, Auto encoder and 
RNN. The models were trained on NSL KDD training 
dataset and evaluated on the test dataset provided by NSL 
KDD. A Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) powered test bed 
using keras with theano backend was employed. A 
comparison between Deep Neural Network (DNN) and 
conventional machine learning models was carried out 
where both Deep Conventional Neural Network (DCNN) 
and LSTM models showed exceptional accuracy on the test 
dataset, this demonstrates the fact that Deep learning is a 
promising technology for intrusion detection. 
Anomaly detection has received considerable attention 
in cybersecurity. The clandestine nature of cyber-attacks 
increased considerably where malware is installed through 
a supply chain. Malware eavesdrops and disrupts 
information exchange. 
Huma et al. [27] proposed a detection approach 
deployed to secure incoming and outgoing traffic, they 
utilized the application of deep random neural network with 
multilayer perceptron and evaluated the scheme using two 
datasets DS205 and UNSW-NB15. They proposed a deep 
learning based cyber-attack detection system that detects 
cyber-attack 25 minutes after the attack was initiated to 
improve cybersecurity at its embryonic stage. It provided 
performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 
score which can be compared with several state-of-the-art 
attack detection algorithms. Classification of 16 different 
attacks was proposed, and accuracy of 98% and 99% was 
achieved. 
Several industries have adopted the Industrial Internet of 
Things (IIoT) in smart homes, smart cities, connected 
cars and supply chain management which introduced new 
trends in business development. However, these edge devices 
have become exploitation points for intruders, it raised 
security and privacy challenge to the trustworthiness of 
edge devices by compromised devices that transmit false 
information to cloud servers. An IDS is widely accepted as a 
technique to monitor malicious activities [26]. 
The growth of modern cyber infrastructure made 
cybersecurity more important. It is estimated that a 
trillion devices will be connected to the Internet by 
2022 [28]. IDS is an essential tool with objective to 
detect unauthorized use and abuse in the host network 
[29]. Sezari et al. [23] demonstrated the performance of a 
system while comparing the false alarm rate of models 
on KDD 1999 Cup dataset, they applied a highly 
optimized deep feedforward network  by the modification 
of the model parameters. Their model achieved a highly 
accurate low false alarm and detection rate which can be 
used to detect and prevent intruders. Utilizing deep 
learning provided a system behavior model that selects 
abnormal behavior and is reliable with less complexity.  
Khaw et al. [25] monitored network traffic to detect 
abnormal activities and ensured security of communication 
and information, using network intrusion simulation datasets 
(NSL-KDD and UNSW- NB15) on a real campus network. 
They proposed a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based (DRL) 
system with self-updating ability to detect abnormal incoming 
traffic. Dawoud et al. [16] explored the applicability of 
deep learning to detect anomaly in Internet of Things (IoT) 
architecture. 
They 
proposed 
an 
anomaly 
detection 
framework by evaluating the use of Restricted Boltzmann 
machines as generative energy-based model against auto 
encoders. The study showed approximately 99% detection 
accuracy. Deep learning algorithms showed positive results 
and achieved highest detection accuracy with high-
performance speed that is effective in detecting false alarm 
rate (FAR), they can detect previously seen and un- seen 
threats, however deep neural network could perform better 
when given more data. Securing a large network in real-time 
is a challenge that was identified. Several studies focused on 
intrusion detection to analyze network traffic by extracting 
features from network flows and traffic fluctuation. 
Deep learning algorithm can self-adapt to anomaly 
intrusion detection and predict network attacks, this was 
demonstrated in a study conducted by Fernandez et al. [12]. 
Abraham et al. [8] compared several machine learning 
algorithms, Random Forest had a superior model, it 
performed optimally for anomaly detection using cross-
validation, and their overall result revealed that previously 
seen and unseen anomaly-based intrusion can be detected. 
An improvement in the reduction of false-positive   alerts that 
enabled rapid response to cyber-threat was observed while 
using ANN [40]. CNN can detect anomalies in industrial 
control systems by detecting majority of attacks with low 
false positive rate [41]. A study conducted by Hashim et al. 
[42] showed that LSTM has high detection accuracy in 
securing websites from external breaches. Vinayakumar et 
al. [10] analyzed ransomware attacks and focused on Twitter 
as a case study, they concluded that deep learning can be 
used to monitor online posts and provide early warning 
about ransomware spread.

V. FUTURE DIRECTION OF AI METHODS IN 
CYBERSECURTY MANAGEMENT 
Research directions in AI applications for cybersecurity 
records broad areas of application. Challenges in 
cybersecurity continue to emerge which makes it difficult for 
further research to focus on a specific area. Studies within 
similar areas are experimenting with different AI 
algorithms. From table IV, algorithms classified as other 
were identified to have been used in less than two 
applications. Researchers are adopting newer techniques. In 
particular, anomaly intrusion detection needs improvement 
by reducing model training time in complex systems. 
Accordingly, future studies may opt for novel techniques. 
There is a need for applications to be efficient and have 
performance 
that 
reduce 
computational 
complexity. 
However, it was emphasized that for neural networks to 
present best accuracy with low error, it must be given large 
dataset. Researchers should advocate a scalable framework 
that can learn from traffic without manual intervention and 
can be used in real time to raise alert of possible cyber-
attacks. 
Future studies may opt for LSTM that have shown 
improved performance with high accuracy and low 
computation time. 
In recent years, AI applications for cybersecurity have 
gained interest from researchers. Remarkable contributions 
have been made in combating cybercrime linking to issues 
like anomaly intrusion detection and malware detection. 
Several applications demonstrated 
improvement 
with 
impact in various areas. These areas include prediction of 
network attacks, presenting best accuracy with the lowest 
error rate, detecting previously seen and unseen threats and 
monitoring online post to provide early warning about cyber-
threats. The nature of recent research suggests promising 
result. However, there are some challenges. A significant 
number of studies did not state the algorithm used or the 
domain applied. Also, the variety of algorithms identified 
suggests that researchers are not accepting newer methods, 
but they are comparing the available algorithms to determine 
which algorithm is best for an identified situation. 
Therefore, it is necessary for researchers to investigate 
further as the latest trends are tending towards IoT. 
Gradually new modern world activities have moved to the 
cloud. It is now possible   for systems to be connected to the 
internet and controlled from anywhere in the world. Internet 
of Things connects these devices to the internet. If companies 
and organizations can secure their devices with intelligent 
solutions, consumer confidence will increase. 
VI. RESEARCH VALIDATION, LIMITATION AND 
CONCLUSION 
 
This paper presented a survey of existing research on 
the application of AI in cybersecurity management. We 
reviewed the use of AI technologies (Algorithms) in 
detecting and preventing attacks in cyberspace. The 
importance 
and 
impact 
of 
AI 
in 
cybersecurity 
management was discussed. This study covered research 
centered on viewpoint from 2018 to 2022. Several scholarly 
databases with related studies were considered. The use of 
journals, conference papers short papers and more were used 
to avoid bias in the selection process. 
 This study confirms that deep learning is not only 
viable for intrusion detection but is also a promising 
technology for detecting known and unknown threats. The 
complexity of cyber-attacks requires techniques that are 
effective. AI has proven to be effective while maintaining 
low computation time with a focus on LSTM that have 
shown low training and computation time. 
Over the years, information and communication 
technology has advanced and cyber-attack surface continued 
to grow rapidly. Increased frequency of cyber-attacks has 
reinforced 
the 
need 
for 
cybersecurity 
initiatives. 
Conventional techniques have become inadequate in 
mitigating complex cyber-attacks, therefore solutions that are 
capable of tackling cyber threats in real-time is required. AI 
has shown effectiveness in terms of computational 
complexity while maintaining low training time 
AI is a technology with a range of computational models 
and algorithms. It deals with the design of intelligent 
systems that mimic human intelligence. Although AI can be 
used to fight cybercrime, it could also be exploited hackers. 
These intelligent security solutions can be considered and 
integrated into a comprehensive system in countries with 
low record of publications. AI can be considered as a 
holistic approach. The advantage of utilizing the above 
intelligent security solutions is greatly publicized, the 
integration remains open for further investigations.
