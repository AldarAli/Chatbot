Abstract—Retail shoplifting is one of the most prevalent forms 
of theft, estimated to cost UK retailers over £1 billion in 2018.  One 
security measure used to discourage shoplifting is surveillance 
cameras. However, evidence shows that unless these cameras are 
constantly monitored, they are ineffective. Automated approaches 
for detecting suspicious behaviour have proven effective but lack 
the transparency to enable them to be used ethically in real life 
scenarios. One way to overcome these problems is through the use 
of social signals. These are observable behaviours which can be 
used to predict an individual’s future behaviour. To this end we 
have developed a set of 15 visual attributes which can be used for 
shoplifting prediction. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of 
these attributes by deriving a new dataset of visual social signals 
attributes by manually annotating videos from the University of 
central Florida Crimes dataset.

recognition; Behaviour recognition; Data analytics.  
I. INTRODUCTION  
In 2018, retail shoplifting accounted for over £1 billion in 
losses for retailers in the United Kingdom [1]. In order to reduce 
these losses, many retailers are applying increased security 
measures, such as hiring security staff and using security tags 
on their more expensive items. The use of surveillance cameras 
is one method which has proven effective at deterring potential 
thieves. However, in order to be fully effective, these cameras 
need to be carefully monitored at all times [2]. Furthermore, 
evidence has shown that serial shoplifters have developed 
methods to evade security cameras, such as concealing the 
goods while in surveillance blind spots. This can make it very 
difficult for a human observer to catch all incidences of 
shoplifting [3].  
Recently there have been attempts to automate the detection 
of individuals who are likely to shoplift through the use of 
computer vision techniques [4]. While these approaches have 
shown great accuracy, they are often based on black box 
learning techniques. This makes it impossible to justify why an 
individual has been classified as a potential shoplifter and raises 
ethical questions about how these methods come to their 
decision [5]. The Committee of Experts on Internet 
Intermediaries (MSI-NET) at the council of Europe has already 
outlined concerns around the admissibility of black box 
algorithms in criminal justice, and there are ongoing questions  
about the potential human rights violations of using evidence 
from these systems in a court of law [6].  
Psychological and criminology literature has shown that 
individuals who are likely to shoplift exhibit a number of 
observable behaviours beforehand. These behaviours can be 
categorised as social signals and include looking around for 
staff, pacing back and forth, and avoiding other customers [7]. 
By detecting one’s social signals, it is possible to make 
predictions about one’s future behaviour [8]. Thus, an 
automated approach to doing so could provide transparency, 
enabling us to determine how an algorithm makes a decision.  
In this paper we have derived a set of 15 social signal 
attributes which can be used for detecting shoplifting, based on 
previous findings [7], [9]–[11] and our own observations. 
Furthermore, we have evaluated the effectiveness of these 
attributes for shoplifting detection by developing a novel 
dataset using real surveillance footage of shoplifters and 
genuine shoppers. The remainder of the paper is outlined as 
follows: in Section II we discuss the literature and the current 
methods; in Section III we will outline the set of attributes and 
the justifications for selection. Section IV outlines our 
experimental setup and our dataset and in Section V we will 
discuss these results. Finally, Section VI will conclude the 
paper.   
II. BACKGROUND 
According to official police statistics, shoplifting remains 
one of the most common forms of theft [12].  To combat this, 
retailers are spending increasing amounts on time and money 
on security. According to the British Retail Consortium, 
retailers in the United Kingdom spent over £1 billion on crime 
prevention in 2018; almost four times as much as was spent in 
2014. Despite this, customer theft is on the rise, accounting for 
£663 million in losses over the same period [1].  
The installation of closed-circuit television cameras 
(CCTV) is one commonly used security method which is often 
employed by retailers to deter criminals. However, research has 
shown that unless footage is actively monitored, surveillance 
cameras will prove ineffective at preventing crime [2]. 
Furthermore, the research conducted in [13] showed that 
thieves use several techniques in order to avoid detection. These 
included using their body to conceal theft, becoming immersed 
within a crowd, and wearing a disguise such as a cap or a 
hoodie. Without the proper training it can be difficult for those 
monitoring the footage to detect these behaviours and prevent 
theft. This is compounded by the fact that those monitoring the 
footage will quickly become fatigued and may miss important

indicators if they have to monitor several video cameras for 
prolonged periods [14].  
The work in [4] aimed to detect suspicious behaviour by 
training a 3D-Convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) model. 
To do this, they proposed a new model for processing 
surveillance footage by segmenting each video into three 
distinct sections: 
• 
Strict crime movement - The segment of the video where 
the individual commits the crime.  
• 
Comprehensive crime movement - The precise moment 
when an ordinary person can detect the suspects intentions.  
• 
Pre-crime behaviour - The individual’s behaviour from 
the time they enter the store until the comprehensive crime 
movement begins.  
They then trained their computer vision model using video 
footage of pre-crime behaviour in order to detect potential 
shoplifters.  Building on this work, [15] expanded the definition 
of suspicious behaviour to include actions preceding other 
crimes, such as arson or abuse, and managed to improve the 
accuracy of the approach. They found that trying to find 
suspicious behaviour of a particular type was difficult due to 
the high visual similarity between suspicious and non-
suspicious behaviours. Their key finding was that a binary 
classification approach for a generalised suspicious behaviour 
achieved higher accuracy than using a multi-class approach.  
     Both [4] and [11] use deep neural networks, trained using 
raw video footage taken of individuals before they shoplift. 
Previous research has shown that the use of these types of black 
box machine learning methods for this type of application can 
be problematic. The most obvious issue is the fact that it is very 
difficult to determine whether the algorithm is learning to 
classify potential shoplifters based on their pre-crime 
behaviours, or if it is learning to classify shoplifters based on 
some other aspect such as potential biases within the dataset 
[16]. The work of [17] outlines the need for transparent, 
interpretable machine learning approaches for high stakes 
learning problems such as this.  
     Human action recognition tasks such as shoplifting 
prediction can be achieved through the detection of social 
signals. First identified by [18], social signals are defined as 
“the observable behaviours displayed by an individual”. Social 
signals can be used to infer an individual’s intentions and to 
make predictions about their future behaviour. For example, the 
work of [19] used a number of vocal based social signals to 
determine the level of conflict within political radio debates. 
Social signals are generally defined in terms of five key 
modalities: physical appearance, vocal features, posture and 
gestures, 
facial 
features 
and 
interpersonal 
distance 
(Proximetrics) [8]. The automatic extraction of social signals 
from each of these modalities encompass a wide range of open 
problems within the field of pattern recognition.  
     In order to implement a social signal processing approach 
for shoplifting prediction, it is necessary to first determine a set 
of social signals which can accurately predict the behaviour. To 
this end we present a set of fifteen social signal attributes for 
the task of shoplifting prediction, based on the current 
literature, and verified through the use of a manually annotated 
dataset of social signal attribute taken from real shoplifting 
videos. This will facilitate the development of automated 
computer vision approaches that are interpretable (i. e. , where 
we can see why the model came to its decision), as well as 
helping to provide some clarity around the effectiveness of 
these attributes for the task of social signal processing.  These 
are outlined in Section III.  
III. ATTRIBUTE SELECTION 
To develop a set of social signal visual attributes for 
shoplifting prediction, we first examined the psychology and 
criminology literature in order to create an initial set of 
approximately 60 potential attributes. We then reduced that 
number by combining similar attributes and removing those 
which would be impossible to detect using computer vision 
techniques. This process results in a compact set of 15 social 
signal attributes as outlined below.  
A. How many individuals are with them? 
According to [20], most organised retail crime is committed 
by a group of two or more individuals. Therefore, observing 
whether an individual is alone or with a group can help 
determine if they are a potential shoplifter.  
B. Are their staff members visible within the video? 
According to [7], shoplifters are less likely to attempt to take 
items when there is a member of staff nearby, as they perceive 
that there is a higher risk of getting caught. Further, it has been 
shown that placing desirable items closer to the registers or 
security guards reduces the incidences of theft of those items 
[9].  
C. What gender is the individual? 
This attribute was important to determine as certain 
behaviours may or may not be suspicious depending on the 
individual’s gender [21].  
D. What gender is their accomplice? 
Similar to C, this attribute was important to determine as 
certain behaviours may or may not be suspicious depending on 
the individual’s gender.  
E. Duration of time spent in the video 
According to [7], individuals who are shoplifting are 
constantly on the lookout for security and customers or staff 
watching them. As a result, they may take longer to perform 
certain actions than a normal customer. This attribute was 
measured in seconds and is calculated based on the amount of 
time the individual is observed in the video. However, this does 
not necessarily correlate to the total time spent in the store; only 
when the individual entered and left the cameras view.  
F.   Are they watching staff or other customers? 
The work in [7] found that individuals who are planning on 
shoplifting are often on the lookout for staff or other customers. 
Due to the difficulty in determining where an individual is 
looking, we defined this attribute to be true if they exhibited 
two or more of the following observing behaviours:

PATTERNS 2021 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

I. 
Do they clearly look around for other customers or 
staff before picking up an item? 
II. 
Do they pick up an item while looking towards a 
member of staff?  
III. 
Does their accomplice look out for staff or other 
customers while they are picking up an item? 
IV. 
Do they frequently look towards shop staff?  
V. 
Do they appear to be interested in the shopkeeper’s 
interactions with other customers? 
G. Do they exhibit avoidance behaviours? 
In order to prevent being detected, shoplifters will often try 
to avoid security staff or other customers and to prevent them 
from seeing what they are doing. Therefore, if an individual 
appears to be exhibiting avoidance behaviours, such as waiting 
for individuals to move away from them and pacing back and 
forth to the same area of the shop, this may be because they are 
waiting for an opportunity to steal a targeted item [7]. To 
determine whether or not the individual was exhibiting 
avoidance behaviours, we used a weighted metric where one 
point was added for each of the following four behaviours 
which indicate avoidance: 
I. 
Do they deliberately go to an area of the shop where 
they are not visible to the shopkeeper or security staff 
and stop and stay there for more than 5 seconds? 
II. 
Do they pick up an item while the shopkeeper’s back 
is turned to them? 
III. 
Do they wait until other customers move away from 
them before picking up an item? 
IV. 
Do they pace back and forth to a specific location 
before picking up an item? 
Additionally, a point was subtracted if any of the following 
behaviours which indicate non-avoidance were observed: 
I. 
Do they pick up an item while visible to the 
shopkeeper? 
II. 
Do they pick up an item while visible to other 
shoppers? 
If the final score for the metric was found to be one or 
higher, the individual was deemed to have exhibited avoidance 
behaviours.  
H. Is the shopkeeper distracted while they pick up an item? 
If an individual is contemplating shoplifting, they will wait 
for the shopkeeper to be distracted before attempting to hide the 
item. This is particularly problematic with professional thieves, 
where often one individual will be charged with distracting the 
shopkeeper while the other steal the items [20]. We defined this 
attribute as true if the shopkeeper was distracted while an 
individual picked up an item, or if either they or one of their 
accomplices distracted the shopkeeper (e. g. , by asking for 
something on a shelf behind the shopkeeper), and then picked 
up an item.  
I. Do they appear to hide what they are doing? 
If individuals are planning to steal, they may attempt to hide 
what they are doing from the store staff or security cameras by  
using either their body or an object, such as a blanket or an 
umbrella [9]. Therefore, it is worth noting if an individual 
appears to be attempting to hide themselves in this way as it 
may indicate that they are attempting to shoplift.    
J. Do they place an item out of view either into their bag or 
into their pocket or else give an item to their accomplice? 
Individuals who are shoplifting will all often conceal a 
stolen item either in a bag or in a coat before leaving. Therefore, 
it is important to detect if they have placed an item out of view 
in this way [7], [13].   
K. Potential difficulty to steal the item 
According to [7], one method which can be used to reduce 
shoplifting incidences is to place high value items closer to tills 
or behind the counter in order to make them more difficult to 
steal. Therefore, items in these locations may be more likely to 
be targeted by organised criminals as opposed to impulsive 
actors. We classified the difficulty to steal a given item on a 
scale of 1 to 3, where a score of 1 means the item has very little 
security and 3 means that the item was well guarded.  This score 
was determined depending on whether the item was kept behind 
the counter, how far the item was from the entrance/exit to the 
store, and how likely the item was to have a security tag.  
L.  Are they wearing a hood baseball cap or some other 
clothing items that hide their appearance? 
Individuals who are planning to shoplift may attempt to 
disguise their appearance by wearing clothing that makes it 
difficult to identify them from surveillance videos [13]. This 
may include hoodies, baseball caps, etc.  
M. Are they wearing baggy clothing or carrying a bag that 
could potentially conceal an item? 
As well as wearing clothing that may conceal their 
appearance, individuals may wear baggy clothing that would 
make it easier to conceal a stolen item, such as large coats, 
baggy trousers, etc. [13]. Therefore, it is worth detecting if an 
individual appears to be wearing this type of clothing as it may 
indicate that they are a potential risk.  
N. Do they pick up an item and appear to be interested in it? 
If an individual picks up an item and appears to examine it, 
this may be a sign that they are waiting for staff or other 
customers to move away from them before they conceal the 
item. Additionally, they may be examining an item for security 
tags [10].  
O. Does the video show them interacting with staff before 
leaving?  
According to [7], individuals who have shoplifted are likely 
to exit the shop quickly and try to avoid interacting with staff 
in case they are caught. Therefore, if individuals interact with 
staff before leaving this may indicate that they are not trying to 
avoid staff.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these social signal 
attributes for the problem of shoplifting prediction, it was

 necessary to develop a novel dataset. This was done by using 
videos from the University of Central Florida Crimes dataset 
(UCF-Crimes). This dataset contains video clips for a large 
number of different criminal behaviours, such as arson and 
assault, as well as control videos. However, for these 
experiments we were only interested on the videos relating to 
shoplifting. For each video, a human observer manually 
annotated whether or not they observed a particular attribute as 
listed above. For the control group, we used the videos from the 
UCF-crimes dataset which were based in a retail setting and 
where the individual being observed made a legitimate 
purchase.  
Attribute A was recorded as an integer denoting the number 
of other people with the shopper or shoplifter. Attributes C and 
D were encoded using one hot encoding in order to prevent the 
model from inferring some ordered relationship. Therefore, for 
attribute C there was two values “Gender is Male” and “Gender 
is Female,” and for attribute D there was two attributes 
“Accomplice is Male,” and “Accomplice is Female.” If there 
was more than one accomplice, the gender was encoded as the 
majority of the group.  Attribute E was recorded as an integer 
denoting the amount of time the individual was observed in 
seconds.  Attribute K was recorded as an integer value between 
1 and 3 as detailed in section III. The remaining attributes were 
all recorded as either true or false. This resulting dataset 
contained a total of 93 records, with 48 shoplifting records and 
45 control records.  
B. Experimental design 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these attributes, we 
used them to train a diverse set of supervised learning models 
and evaluated them in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. 
These models were as follows: Support vector classifier (SVM) 
[22], K-Nearest neighbours (KNN) [23], Classification and 
regression decision tree (CART) [24], Random Forest [25] and 
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) [26]. Each model was evaluated 
using five-fold cross validation and the hyper parameters were 
optimised using a grid search.  
For the support vector classifier, we used a grid search to 
find the optimal kernel, and the optimal values for C and 
Gamma.  The kernels used in the grid search were linear, radial 
basis function, polynomial and sigmoid. The values for the 
regularization parameter C used in the grid search were: 
1,10,100 and 1000. Finally, the values used for gamma in the 
grid search were: 102, 103 104.  
For the KNN classifier, we used a grid search to find the 
optimal distance function, optimal number of neighbours, and 
if the weights of the neighbours were uniform or weighted 
based on distance. The distance metrics used in the grid search 
were Euclidian distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev 
distance, and Minkowski distance. For K we tested the range of 
values between 1 and 16.  
For the decision tree classifier, we used a grid search to 
determine: the optimal criterion used to measure the quality of 
the split, either using gini impurity or entropy; the optimal 
strategy used to split each node, either using the feature with 
the highest importance or using a random feature, with the 
random distribution weighted by importance; the max tree 
depth, between None up to 8;  the minimum samples needed to 
split a node again from None up to 8, and finally, the number 
of features to consider when looking for the best split, either the 
square root of the number of features, log2 of the number of 
features, or just using the entire set of features.  
For the random forest classifier, we used a grid search to 
determine the optimal values for the criterion, max depth, 
minimum number of samples needed to split a node, and the 
number of features to consider when looking for the best split. 
We also optimised for the number of trees used in the forest in 
multiples of 5 from 25 up to 100.  
Finally, for the MLP model, we used a grid search to find: 
the optimal activation function, either using an identity function 
(where 𝐹(𝑥) = 𝑥), a logistic activation function, a hyperbolic 
tan activation function or a rectified linear activation function; 
the optimiser, either stochastic gradient decent, an Adam 
optimiser or the LM-BFGS optimiser; and the optimal number 
of neurons for each of the two hidden layers, in increments of 
50 from 50 up to 400. The optimised parameters for each of 
these models are presented in Table I.

negative predictions and FN is the number of false negative 
predictions. The results for each approach are presented above.  
As can be seen in Table II, the Random Forest approach was 
found to be the most accurate on our dataset, with an accuracy 
of 94. 5%. This was followed by the SVM approach, the MLP 
approach the decision tree approach and the KNN approach. 
This was the same for the precision metric. However, for the 
recall metric, both the SVM and MLP approach slightly 
outperformed the random forest approach. This is important as 
the recall metric determines how many of the individuals who 
were genuinely shoplifters were detected as such. However, if 
the system fails to highlight a suspicious individual who does 
go on to shoplift, then that individual may evade detection.  
These results indicate that there are clear and measurable 
differences between the social signals exhibited by shoplifters 
and those exhibited by regular shoppers.   
Figure 1 shows the feature importance generated by the 
random forest model [27]. The results here indicate that the 
most significant attribute was: “Do they exhibit avoidance 
behaviours.” This was followed by: “Do they interact with staff 
before leaving,” “potential difficulty to steal the item,” “Do 
they place the item out of view,” and “Do they appear to hide 
what they are doing.” These attributes almost all relate to the 
individual performing (or not performing) a given action, which 
may indicate that an individual’s behaviour gives a more 
reliable indicator of their intention than environmental factors, 
such as their clothing.  Conversely, the least important features 
were “Gender,” “Gender of accomplice,” “Are they wearing 
clothing items that could hide their appearance,” and “Are their 
staff members visible withing the shot.” Again, this makes 
sense, as these are all environmental attributes which don’t give 
an indication about how an individual is behaving.  
As well as generating the feature importance, we also 
performed sensitivity analysis on each of the attributes. This 
was done by removing each attribute individually and then 
evaluating the change in performance. As can be seen from the 
results in Table III, the most important attributes are: F “are 
they watching staff or other customers,” G “Are they exhibiting 
avoidance behaviours,” I “Do they appear to hide what they 
are doing,” and O “Do they interact with staff before leaving.”  
This is consistent with the results found by calculating the 
feature importance. As discussed above, these attributes all 
relate to the individual performing a specific action, which may 
be why they are stronger features for predicting shoplifting. It 
is interesting to note that removing attribute N “Do they pick up 
an item and appear interested in it” caused the model to 
improve in accuracy. This may indicate that this attribute is a 
poor indicator of potential shoplifting or that it may appear too 
frequently in both groups to be useful. All of the other attributes 
showed some decrease in classification accuracy when 
removed.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper we have outlined the need for a transparent 
interpretable model for the problem of suspicious behaviour 
detection. To this end we developed a set of 15 social signal 
visual attributes which have been used to predict if an 
individual is likely to shoplift. We demonstrated the 
effectiveness of these attributes for the problem of shoplifting 
detection by manually annotating a subset of videos from the 
UCF-crimes dataset. We evaluated the effectiveness of each 
attribute by calculating the feature importance and through the 
use of sensitivity analysis. These results showed that detection 
of attributes which show individuals performing actions, such 
as interacting with staff and exhibiting avoidance behaviours, 
were the strongest indicators of whether or not an individual 
was a potential shoplifter.  
For future work, these results will be validated using a larger 
dataset of shoplifting videos. Currently, the UCF-Crimes 
dataset [28] is the largest open-source dataset for this problem.

However, this dataset only contains 50 videos of shoplifting; a 
number of which are cut short and don’t provide enough 
footage to definitively determine the social signals exhibited 
before a shoplifting attempt. Furthermore, the videos in this 
dataset come from a number of different retail environments. A 
single dataset of retail shoplifting from a single store with 
multiple cameras and which contains both genuine customers 
and thieves, and where each customers entire history, from the 
moment they enter the store to the moment they leave, would 
enable us to determine more definitively which social signals 
are suspicious, and the frequency at which they occur.  
Secondly, we suggest that there may be other social signals 
that indicate that an individual is likely to shoplift which we 
may have missed, or which may not be present in the current 
literature. Further to this, it has already been noted that 
individuals who are shoplifting have developed techniques to 
attempt to evade security measured. It is inevitable then that 
once these methods are implemented individuals will develop 
new techniques in order to evade them.
