Abstract—User interfaces of mobile maps on mobile and tablet 
devices with a touch screen interfaces is evaluated in this study. 
A four-way factorial experiment compares the user interface 
satisfaction for two mobile touch devices (iPad/iPhone), two 
map types (Electronic Map/Mixed Map), two keyword 
searches (Landmark/District), and Chinese input methods 
(Hand-written/Phonetic notation). The experiment used forty-
eight participants, each of whom was assigned three types of 
environmental spatial tasks: find targets, identify cardinal 
directions, and identify approximate distances. The individual 
differences between gender, the possession of a sense of 
direction and route knowledge on user’s satisfaction were also 
examined. The results of the study verify that both the 
reliability and confirmative factor analysis model of the 
questionnaire for user interface satisfaction are good enough. 
In addition, the two-factor interactions and the main effects: 
Type, Keyword, and Input significantly affect the degree of 
user satisfaction. 
Keywords-User Interface Satisfaction; Mobile Map; Mobile 
Spatial Interaction; Touch Screen; Sense of Direction. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The functionality of mobile maps has been greatly 
increased by the use of new interactivity technology. Maps 
can be zoomed in and out and rotated without affecting the 
ratio of the display and can be easily combined with satellite 
images, aerial photographs and other sources of information 
to improve the user's understanding of the geographic 
database. The use of mobile maps is becoming popular with 
most mobile users; especially with the availability of free 
Google Maps for mobile phones. Google Maps for Mobile 
(GMM) claim that paper maps are obsolete. It offers street 
maps, a route planner for traveling by foot, car, or public 
transport and an urban business locator, for numerous 
countries around the world. Mobile phones can be used to 
search for local businesses, and then to obtain direction [3]. 
Touch screen tablet PC’s have become increasingly 
popular, since Apple launched the iPad device. They enable 
direct interaction with what is displayed on the screen, rather 
than indirectly with a mouse or touchpad. “It looks like a 
giant iPhone,” is the first thing users say when asked to test 
an iPad. However, from the perspective of interactive design, 
an iPad User Interface (UI) is more than a scaled-up iPhone 
UI [1]. The recent boom of popularity of mobile and tablet 
devices such as the iPhone and iPad open up a new world of 
opportunity for mobile global positioning system (GIS) 
applications [13]. 
Literature concerning map-reading has shown that using 
a map is not an easy task for children, or even for adults [10]. 
Route-finding aids are important for finding routes in 
unfamiliar territory, in order to learn, about the surrounding 
environment. In particular, due to the advent of advanced 
information technologies, devices equipped with GPS 
receivers are becoming valuable tools for providing 
positional information [15]. With respect to navigational aids, 
studies such as in [7] have examined the effectiveness of 
GPS-based mobile navigation systems in comparison to 
paper maps and direct experience of routes. Their results 
show that GPS users travel longer distances and make more 
stops during the walk than map users and participants with 
direct experience of a route. 
Various presentation formats for spatial information have 
been developed, including verbal navigational directions, 
static maps, interactive maps, 3-D visualizations, animations 
and virtual environments [12]. Dillemuth [2] showed that a 
faster speed of travel and fewer navigation errors occur with 
a generalized map than with an aerial photograph. Some 
people can readily find their way back to a starting point 
along a route they have only experienced once, whilst others 
can only do this with considerable difficulty. There are large 
differences in individuals’ environmental spatial abilities [4, 
8]. This individual difference between people is referred to 
as the sense of direction (SOD). Self-reported assessments of 
SOD have been found to provide quite accurate and 
objective measures of these abilities [5]. Participants with a 
good SOD (GSD) showed much better performance on route 
learning than those with a poor SOD (PSD). In addition, 
concerning gender differences in spatial cognition, it was 
suggested that males were superior to females in spatial 
information processing. Males preferred and used much 
better Euclidean spatial cues such as direction and distance, 
while females were likely to memorize landmark cues [9]. 
 Usability is the extent to which a computer system 
enables users, in a given context of use, to achieve specified 
goals effectively and efficiently while promoting a feeling of 
satisfaction. Understanding what users expect to find and 
want to find, as well as what they typically use GMM for, 
can help the mapping service designers to provide a user-
centered design. Moreover, understanding the needs of 
GMM will help improve the user experience and increase the 
service's usability. The effects of four designing factors

including Size, Type, Direction Key, and Zoom function has 
been examined in [11]. The results indicate that participants 
with a better SOD would have the faster response time and 
would lower overall workload for target task. However, 
mobile maps differ from paper maps in that it provides a 
facilitation of spatial search. Keyword search using landmark 
or district and Chinese input methods using traditional 
Chinese hand-written input or traditional Chinese phonetic 
notation keyboard input for GMM spatial queries are 
concentrated on this research.  
In this paper we discuss user interface satisfaction (UIS) 
that arose in using GMM on mobile devices with a touch 
screen interface such as the iPhone and iPad. This study 
differs from previous studies [7,10,11,12,15] in that it 
concentrates on the effects of keyword search and Chinese 
input methods that affect UIS. We first present our 
experimental design, including a description of the interfaces 
evaluated. Four design factors (Interface, Type, Keyword, 
Input) and two background factors (SOD and route 
knowledge) on UIS were examined. It helps Apps designers 
to provide an optimal user-centered interface for GMM. We 
follow with a description of our research methodology, 
define a classification scheme of SOD used in our analysis, 
and then present the results. The paper concludes with a 
discussion of design implications followed by future work. 
II. 
METHOD  
A. 
Participants  
Forty-eight undergraduate, graduate students, teaching 
assistants and staff (24 females and 24 males) voluntarily 
participated in the experiment. Their ages ranged from 20.7 
to 39.7 years old, with a mean of 23.7 years and standard 
deviation of 3.5 years. Nine out of Forty-eight participants 
had experience in using mobile E-maps other than GMM, 
before the experiment. They all had normal vision or 
corrected vision of at least 0.8 and no color-blindness. 
Participants were required to abstain from PC use for one 
hour before the formal experiment. 
B. Materials and Apparatus 
The experiment used an iPad with a 9.7-inches multi-
touch LCD display (1024× 768 pixels) as a representative 
tablet PC and an iPhone with a 3.5-inch multi-touch retina 
display (960×640 pixels). An Optical Vision Tester was used 
to measure vision acuity and to test for color blindness. A 
digital video camera recorder (SONY DCR-PC330) was 
used to record the experiments and the post-experiment 
questionnaire. The luminance of experimental lab was 
487~611 lux, as measured by a Lutron LX-101 Lux meter. 
C. Sense of Direction 
Using the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale 
(SBSOD) [5], 10 questions concerning spatial awareness and 
navigation allowed self-rating, using Likert’s seven-point 
scale, before the formal experiment. Participants responded 
to each question by circling a number ranging from 1 
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Four out of ten 
statements were positive, e.g., “My sense of direction is very 
good,” “I am very good at reading maps.” The other six 
statements were negative, e.g., “I have a poor memory for 
where I left things,” “I very easily get lost in a new city.” 
These responses were reversed so that a higher score 
indicated a better SOD. The rating for SOD is calculated by 
summation of the scores for the ten SOD questions, as a 
SOD score and then these scores were categorized into two 
groups as SODG, using the median SOD as the divider for 
good SOD (GSD) and poor SOD (PSD). In addition, 
participants sat paper-and-pencil tests for route knowledge 
(RK), before the experiment. Their RK scores were recorded 
and categorized into two groups as RKG: good RK (GRK) 
and poor RK (PRK), based on the test result for route 
knowledge. 
D. Design of Experiment 
This study seeks to provide an analytical model of 
usability of a GMM interface was evaluated using touch 
screen panels. The usability of the GMM interface was 
evaluated using a questionnaire for user interface satisfaction 
(QUIS), upon completion of three route-finding tasks. A 
four-way factorial design was used to assign each participant 
all three types of route-finding tasks to each participant and 
then a post-experiment questionnaire was used to determine 
user interface satisfaction. The four design factors consisted 
of: (1) Interface: tablet PC (iPad) vs. smart phone (iPhone), 
(2) Type: Electronic map (E-Map) vs. mixed map (M-Map, 
that is, E-map plus satellite), (3) Keyword: use landmark as 
keyword (Landmark) vs. use district (District), and (4) Input: 
traditional Chinese hand-written input (hand-written) vs. 
traditional Chinese phonetic notation keyboard input 
(phonetic notation). The illustration of the factors Type and 
Input is shown in Fig. 1. Demographical variables consisted 
of: (1) gender, (2) route knowledge (GRK/PRK), and (3) 
sense of direction (GSD/PSD). Forty-eight participants (24 
female and 24 male) participated in this experiment. Three 
route-finding tasks were assigned to each participant; (1) find 
targets, (2) identify cardinal directions and (3) identify the 
approximate distances. Cardinal directions were based on 8-
sectors model (North, East, South, West, North-East, South-
East, South-West and North-West), while approximate 
distances corresponded to a set of ordered intervals, where 
the order of symbolic distance values describes distances 
from the nearest to the furthest [6]. The time to correctly 
complete the target task, the time to correctly complete the 
direction task and the time to correctly complete the distance 
task using a GMM interface were measured (omitted due to 
limitation of paper length). 
The study areas were northern, central and southern 
metropolitan district of Taiwan, in Taipei, Taichung, and 
Kaohsiung Cities, respectively. The participants all started 
from the same point. The mapped area was dynamically 
updated as the user moved in space. 
E. Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) 
The questionnaire for user interface satisfaction (QUIS) 
is a structured assessment of usability. It is useful in the early 
stages of the development of a user-centered design. The 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines 
23

ACHI 2012 : The Fifth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

the usability of a product as “the extent to which the product 
can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals 
with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified 
context of use.” The usability of interactive products is 
generally defined by the ease with which they can be learned, 
their effectiveness in use, and the extent to which the user 
finds them enjoyable to use [14]. In this study, usability is 
defined by the following parameters: pleasure, interactivity, 
efficiency, ease of use, ease of recovery from error, 
memorability, satisfaction, and recommendation. 
F. Procedure  
At the beginning of the experiment, naive participants 
were asked to familiarize themselves with the GMM 
interface. They practiced using the device until they were 
proficient. Prior to the formal experiment, they were asked to 
complete an individual background questionnaire, including 
self-rating of sense-of-direction and route knowledge. One of 
sixteen combinations of treatment was randomly assigned to 
one of the participants and the participants were subjected to 
the route-finding tasks. After the completion of all three 
route-finding tasks, each participant completed the QUIS 
using a 10-point Likert’s scale. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Descriptive Statistics and correlation matrix 
The overall user interface satisfaction (UIS) score is 
calculated by summation of the scores for the eight UIS 
questions as the UIS score. The descriptive statistics are 
shown in Table 1. The mean UIS for females (54.0) is higher 
than that for males (50.6). The participants with GRK have a 
higher mean UIS (59.4) than those with PRK (46.8). The 
mean UIS for GSD participants (54.1) is higher than for 
those with PSD (50.5). The mean UIS for using iPad (56.8) 
is higher than that for using iPhone (47.8). The mean UIS for 
using E-Map (55.1) is higher than that for using M-Map 
(49.5). The mean UIS for using landmark search directly 
(54.0) is higher than that for not using landmark search, but 
using district search (50.7). The mean UIS for using hand-
written keyword input (55.4) is higher than that for using 
phonetic notation input (49.2). Based on the eight ordinal-
scale items of QUIS, the results of Spearman’s rank 
correlation between pairwise items are shown in Table 2. It 
can be seen that there is a statistically significant and a 
moderately positive correlation between pairwise items. 
B. Reliability and Validity 
Cronbach's alpha is a coefficient of reliability (or 
consistency). It is a measure of internal consistency, that is, 
how closely related a set of items are as a group. A "high" 
value for alpha is often used (along with substantive 
arguments and possibly other statistical measures) as 
evidence that the items measure an underlying (or latent) 
construct. The results of QUIS in this study indicate a value 
of Cronbach’s alpha is 0.925 and there is good internal 
consistency. However, a high alpha does not imply that the 
measure is one-dimensional. If, in addition to measuring 
internal consistency, evidence is required that the scale in 
question is one-dimensional, additional analyses can be 
performed. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is one method 
of checking dimensionality. The results of EFA for the QUIS 
indicate that 66.8% of the total variation is explained by only 
one common factor, which is named as the degree of user 
interface satisfaction (DUIS). Examination of the goodness-
of-fit indices confirms that the confirmative factor analysis 
(CFA) model has been well designed.  
C. Individual differences in UIS 
The relationship between SODG, RKG, Gender and UIS 
were investigated for the three tasks. The two-factor 
interaction plot is shown in Figure 2. It indicates that females 
with PSD tended toward a higher UIS than males with PSD; 
however, no significant difference is evident between 
females and males in the GSD groups (Fig. 2(a)). Similarly, 
females with PRK have a higher UIS than males with PRK; 
both females and males with GRK have nearly the same UIS, 
on average (Fig. 2(b)). In addition, GRK groups with PSD 
and GSD have a higher UIS than PRK groups (Fig. 2(c)). 
There is insufficient evidence of statistical significance (all 
p>0.05) for the two-factor interactions.  
D. Analysis of variance and Interaction plots 
Based on the results of ANOVA in Table 3 indicate that 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
two-factor 
interaction 
of 
Interface*SODG and Interface*RKG (F=7.151, p=0.011 and 
F=4.323, p=0.045, respectively) are all supported. The main 
effects: Type, Keyword, Input, and RKG are statistically 
significant 
(p<0.05). 
To 
interpret 
the 
interaction, 
comparisons between GSD and PSD groups depend upon 
whether they use iPad or iPhone. In Fig. 3(a), the PSD group 
using iPad tended toward a higher UIS than the GSD group, 
but the PSD group using iPhone tended toward a lower UIS 
than the GSD group, on average, for GMM. PSD participants 
prefer using iPad to iPhone, but for iPhone users, GSD 
participants have a higher UIS than those with PSD. It is 
interesting to note how sense of direction affects the 
satisfaction users of the different interfaces. In Fig. 3(b), the 
GRK group using either iPad or iPhone tended toward a 
higher UIS than the PRK group, but the PRK group using 
iPad for GMM tended toward a higher UIS on average, than 
those using iPhone. Similarly, PRK participants prefer using 
iPad to iPhone. However, for iPhone users, GRK participants 
have a higher UIS than the PRK group. 
E. Discussion 
Kato and Takeuchi [9] argue that individual differences 
in wayfinding strategies between GSD and PSD female 
undergraduate participants. GSD participants showed much 
better performance on route learning than PSD participants 
[9]. Similarly, our results show that GSD participants have 
higher UIS than PSD participants on using GMM. While 
little work has explicitly considered how GRK/PRK groups 
interact with GMM on iPhone/iPad for UIS. A significant 
amount of research has explored how route knowledge is 
best conveyed by both interfaces used in our study. 
Moreover, a significant effect also has explored how SOD is 
best communicated with both interfaces. Effective route 
24

maps must provide information that is necessary and 
sufficient to make the right choice at each decision point [16]. 
Agrawala and Stolte [17] argue that for maps on mobile 
devices it is particularly important that the routes are 
simplified and extra information is removed. It is consistent 
with our study that E-map has superior UIS than M-map. 
Reliability of the questionnaire was tested on 532 
undergraduates as participants using internal consistency and 
split-half methods in Kato and Takeuchi’s study [9]. A 
moderately high reliability was obtained. Similarly, both the 
reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) and confirmative factor 
analysis model of the questionnaire for user interface 
satisfaction are good enough in this study. However, only 
forty-eight participates used in the experiment.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The results of this study have implications for mobile 
spatial interaction in general. Most GMM users prefer using 
E-map to M-Map. They also prefer using landmark as 
keyword to district and prefer using traditional Chinese 
hand-written input method to traditional phonetic notation 
input. The poor SOD (PSD) group prefers using iPad to 
iPhone. The poor RK (PRK) group prefers using iPad to 
iPhone and the good RK (GRK) group has a higher UIS than 
the PRK group. It is also important to integrate the impact of 
the design factors and individual differences on the user 
performance of mobile spatial interaction. The results of 
quantitative measurements and subjective assessments will 
be used as the guidelines to provide a better solution and to 
meet the demands of usability for mobile spatial interaction 
applications.
