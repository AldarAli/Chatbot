INTRODUCTION 
 
     The need for an antenna with characteristics like wide 
bandwidth and high directivity has grown due to the 
enormous surge in broadcast and wireless communication 
technologies. Broadband antennas find use in various 
applications such as SATCOM, RADAR, remote sensing, 
microwave imaging, etc. A Vivaldi antenna is a type of 
Tapered Slot Antenna (TSA) that was first discovered and 
studied by Gibson in 1979 [1].  The conventional design of 
a TSA antenna is a tapered slot engraved on the metal over 
the dielectric substrate which is also an end-fire radiator. 
TSA has some models depending on the variations of the 
tapered-shaped slot. The most used are: Linear TSA (LTSA) 
[2], Constant TSA (CTSA) [3] and Exponentially TSA. 
Exponentially TSA design is also known as Vivaldi 
antenna. The Antipodal Vivaldi antenna, also known as the 
dual exponentially tapered slot antenna (DETSA) forms part 
of the end-fire tapered slot family of antennas Figure 1 is an 
illustrative representation of the generalized form of a 
Vivaldi antenna. By tapering the microstrip line, the feeding 
structure transition is accomplished [4].

antenna are given in Section I. Section II discusses various 
optimized Vivaldi antenna designs for various applications, 
e.g., (a) SATCOM/Radar/5G  (b) UWB application   (c) 
Wireless 
and 
Vehicular 
communication

Other 
miscellaneous applications. Finally, conclusions are given in 
Section III, followed by references.  
 
II. VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF VIVALDI 
ANTENNA 
 
     Vivaldi antennas are finding applications in all the major 
areas of communication systems. Some of them are listed as 
follows, along with their design methodology:  
 
A. SATCOM/Radar/5G 
 
     Ullah et al. [6] proposed the design of an Antipodal 
Vivaldi Antenna (AVA) for 5G communication and Ku-
band usages, as shown in Figure 2. The top layer of the 
design contains an array of eight elements having split-
shaped leaf design fed by a power divider and the bottom 
layer contains truncated ground. Puskely et al. [7] proposed 
a dielectric loaded antipodal SIW Vivaldi antenna with high 
gain operating in the Ka band (25 - 40 GHz), as shown in 
Figure 2. An improved impedance matching with better 
directional radiation pattern is attained by the combination 
of dielectric loading, printed transition and corrugated 
ripples fabricated on the arms of antenna. 
 
              
         
 
 
Figure 2. Fabricated prototypes [6][7]. 
 
     Emre et al. [8] proposed a high gain UWB Vivaldi 
antenna array for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) 
applications as shown in Figure 3. First, the Vivaldi 
antenna's single element is designed for ultra-wide band 
operation in the X-band and Ku-band frequency range. 
Subsequently, edge grooves are created on the sides of 
exponential etched patch surface in order to shield the 
proposed antenna from surface currents. Furthermore, the

parasitized element is complemented to increase the antenna 
gain.  Kähkönen et al. [9] proposed an 18–30 GHz dual–
polarized Vivaldi antenna array design for satellite 
communication as shown in Figure 3. The array consists of 
4×4 dual-polarized antenna elements and RF module. The 
RF module comprises amplifiers and phase shifters to 
control the antenna elements. Zhang et al. [10] suggested a 
miniaturized, wide band dual-polarized Vivaldi antenna 
with reduced Radar Cross Section (RCS), as shown in 
Figure 3. Two single-polarized Vivaldi elements are 
arranged in a cross-shape to create the dual-polarized 
antenna with S11<-10 dB covering the spectrum from 1.8 to 
6 GHz. The RCS of the antenna can be reduced over a wide 
frequency band by creating symmetric rectangular slots and 
curving metallic portion from the radiating surfaces.  
     
     
     
 
 
Figure 3. Fabricated prototypes [8][9][10]. 
 
     Dixit et al. [11] proposed a 1 × 4 AVA array for various 
5G services as shown in Figure 4. The proposed antenna 
operates over 24 – 29 GHz and 30 – 40 GHz frequency 
ranges and possesses high gain.  The size of antenna is 
miniaturized with help of corrugations which also improve 
front-to-back ratio augmenting the gain. To increase the 
bandwidth, 
optimized 
corporate 
feeding 
is 
used. 
Moosazadeh et al. [12] proposed an AVA antenna 
Surrounded by Dielectric (AVA-SD) with operating 
frequency, ranging from 5 to 40 GHz for mmWave imaging, 
radio astronomy, etc., as shown in Figure 4. The 
conventional AVA is enclosed by dielectric material 
(Teflon) to suppress higher-order modes and also to enhance 
antenna gain at higher frequency. The surrounding dielectric 
area is slightly expanded beyond the antenna to contain 
most of the energy. Kuriakose et al., [13] proposed a high 
gain UWB Vivaldi antenna for Through-Wall Radar (TWR) 
applications with operating frequency ranging from 1.8 GHz 
to 12 GHz, as shown in Figure 4. First, a broadband Vivaldi 
antenna is designed using exponentially tapered slot. Then, 
corrugations and periodic grating elements are introduced 
along the length of the antenna arm to enhance the gain. 
    
   
    
 
 
Figure 4. Fabricated prototypes [11][12][13]. 
 
     Cheng et al. [14] proposed a small sized Vivaldi Antenna 
for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system as shown in 
Figure 5. In the proposed design, a Side Lobe Suppressor 
(SSR) and Artificial Materials Lens (AML) are inserted to 
increase the gain and radiation capabilities of the GPR 
antenna. SSR mostly affects low-frequency EM waves, 
while AML primarily affects high-frequency EM waves. 
Ramanujam et al. [15] proposed the design of upgraded and 
compact AVA array for 28 GHz 5G millimeter wave (mm-
wave) application with reduced coupling. The design as 
shown in Figure 5 consists of eight radiating elements with 
slots on the ground plane and the radiating arm to increase 
gain and reduce mutual coupling. 
 
             
     
 
 
Figure 5. Fabricated prototypes [14][15]. 
 
     Elabd et al. [16] proposed a broadband MIMO Vivaldi 
5G base station antenna for frequency bands (28 GHz and 
38 GHz) as shown in Figure 6. The proposed antenna 
consists of two orthogonally polarized antennas with better 
isolation using a novel EBG structure. Hence, the final 
design consists of a two-element beam switch MIMO 
Vivaldi antenna with electromagnetic band gap structure.  
Paul et al. [17] proposed a wide band (2 - 28 GHz) Vivaldi 
antenna, as shown in Figure 6, for satellite and 5G bands in 
Sub-6 GHz applications using optimization technique. To 
upgrade the performance, particularly the bandwidth and 
gain of the antenna, it includes ten corrugated side slots on 
radiating arm, two circular slots, and one via near feed 
point. 
 
        
         
 
 
Figure 6. Fabricated prototypes [16][17]. 
 
     Kumar et al. [18] proposed a wideband (15 - 40 GHz) 
AVA by integrating a V shaped Negative Index 
Metamaterial (NIM). The ‘V’-shaped MTM unit cells are 
positioned at the upper surface amidst two radiators in order 
to radiate a strong electric field in the end-fire direction. 
 
B. Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) Applications 
 
      Yin et al. [19] projected a compact, wideband Vivaldi 
antenna comprising a half leaf-shape radiating arm with row 
of metallized vias making a HM-Vivaldi design, as shown 
in Figure 7. Further, when it is combined with truncated 
16

ground plane, it improves the impedance matching of HM-
Vivaldi and hence the bandwidth. An UWB ranging from 
5.3 - 40 GHz with S11< -10 dB is accomplished. Wang et 
al. [20] proposed removal of the redundant substrate from 
the metallic flares of the proposed antenna and applying 
dual slotted edges, as shown in Figure 7, to enhance the 
radiation characteristics. Also, a microstrip-to-stripline 
transition is incorporated for better impedance matching. 
The design functions well over 10–40 GHz with S11 < -
10dB providing good bandwidth and can be used for a wide 
range of applications for wireless communication. Li et al. 
[21] proposed an UWB metamaterial slab (meta-slab) 
loaded AVA with high gain and stable radiation pattern, as 
shown in Figure 7. The energy is transmitted to the end fire 
direction with help of the high permittivity meta-slab, which 
absorbs it from the tapered slot. Antenna S11 has a 
measured value of less than -10 dB between 3.6 and 40 
GHz.  
 
  
  
 
 
Figure 7. Fabricated prototypes [19][20][21]. 
 
     Nassar et al. [22] proposed a unique method for 
enhancing the bandwidth and directivity of a wide band (2- 
32 GHz) antipodal Vivaldi antenna structure as shown in 
Figure 8. The technique is based on inserting a parasitic 
elliptical patch on the aperture to augment the field coupling 
amid the arms and create more radiation towards the end 
fire direction. Mazhar et al. [23] proposed a compact and 
wideband (5-40 GHz) circular Vivaldi antenna, as shown in 
Figure 8. The circular Vivaldi antenna is embedded with 
configuration of log periodic slots and achieves advantages 
of high gain and low side lobe levels at higher frequencies. 
Chen et al. [24] proposed a dual-band and dual-polarized 
nested Vivaldi antenna in frequency range 2 - 40 GHz. The 
proposed Vivaldi antenna comprises of a 2–8 GHz section 
along with a 8–40 GHz section nested together. These two 
nested Vivaldi antennas are arranged in a cross-shape to 
achieve the antenna's dual-polarized radiation. 
 
     
  
  
 
 
Figure 8. Fabricated prototypes [22][23][24]. 
 
      Wan et al. [25] proposed design of ultra-wideband 
Vivaldi antenna with frequency band 3.3–40 GHz, as shown 
in Figure 9. A trapezoidal dielectric substrate is embedded 
in the direction of the major axis centred around 
conventional antipodal Vivaldi antenna, which enhances the 
directional radiation performance, e.g., high efficiency, low 
cross polarization ratio and high Front to Back Ratio (FBR). 
For UWB communications, Natrajan et al. [26] proposed an 
improved AVA with compact size and large bandwidth by 
adding another petal to conventional AVA as shown in 
Figure 9. Through this development, it increases the 
electrical length of the radiator and thereby reduces the 
lower operating frequency. Hence, adding another petal 
results in small size and increased bandwidth (2.4 - 20 
GHz). Alhawari et al. [27] proposed a Multiple Input 
Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna on denim substrate 
exhibiting dual polarization and low mutual coupling with 
UWB bandwidth of 5–40 GHz. The antenna, as shown in 
Figure 9, is integrated with staircase meander line; 
thereafter, it is embedded with the metamaterial structure 
that reduces mutual coupling, increasing the gain and 
efficiency. 
 
  
   
   
 
 
Figure 9. Fabricated prototypes [25][26][27]. 
 
     Natarajan et al. [28] proposed a low cross-polarized and 
small sized antipodal Vivaldi antenna operating in the 
frequency range from 3.7 GHz to over 18 GHz as shown in 
Figure 10. The miniaturization in size is achieved by 
structurally modifying the radiating fins without changing 
the dimensions of antenna. Altering the fin’s structure 
results in the diminution of lower operating frequency and 
hence the size is reduced. Zhang et al. [29] proposed a 
compact and wide-band Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (AVA) 
for UWB applications, as shown in Figure 10. The radiator's 
conventional exponential tapering edge is substituted with 
an arc curve in the design to make the AVA more compact. 
In order to enhance its gain at high-frequency, the AVA is 
additionally equipped with a "director" and a "convex lens." 
The proposed antenna is compact with an operating 
frequency range from 3.01 to 10.6 GHz.

     For vehicular communications, a three-port diversity 
antenna generating three-directional radiation pattern was

proposed by Natarajan et al. [30]. It comprises of three 
Vivaldi antennas interconnected on a single PCB as shown 
in Figure 11. The second radiating wing is supplemented 
with the primary with twin line transition. It provides ultra-
wideband features with end-fire radiation pattern and 
bandwidth ranging from 5 to 11 GHz. Jeon et al. [31] 
proposed a dual-polarized Vivaldi antenna for the Over-
The-Air (OTA) testing and measurement of communication 
devices which are used in the frequency band of 3 – 7 GHz. 
By vertically interconnecting two planar Vivaldi antennas, 
the dual-polarization capability is achieved. For the 
broadband impedance matching of the antenna, a λ/4 long 
balun is used. Shan et al. [32] proposed a developed Vivaldi 
antenna with planar directors near the tapering slot's 
aperture and transverse slots are etched on the edges for 
vehicular wireless communication Systems. An antenna 
with planar directors and transverse slots is designed for 
IEEE 802.11a (4.9 – 5.93 GHz) vehicular communication, 
as shown in Figure 11. 
 
         
        
       
                
                             Figure 11. Fabricated prototypes [30][32]. 
             
     For 
Vehicle-to-Vehicle 
(V2V) 
communication, 
a 
switching beam antenna system using four Vivaldi antennas 
is proposed by Ameen et al. [33], as shown in Figure 12. 
Vivaldi’s operation is decided by switches which make 
particular antenna active. Tiwari et al. [34] proposed a 
slotted Vivaldi antenna for the wireless communication 
applications in the range of 3.5-8.4 GHz for WLAN, 
WiMAX and HiperLAN applications. 
Circular and 
triangular slots are etched on radiating arm of antenna for 
miniaturization and creating various frequency bands. 
Güneş et al. [35] proposed a tri-band AVA for WLAN and 
IoT applications. The antipodal Vivaldi antenna is made up 
of a Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) inspired director 
made up of an array of sub-wavelength rectangular patches 
and meander slotted lines etched on the edges of tapered 
metallic parts. FSS is used to reduce side lobe level. 
Bulgaroni et al. [36] proposed a novel design made by an 
array of two AVAs placed opposite to each other and fed via 
a microstrip to Coplanar Strip (CPS) transition, as shown in 
Figure 12. The feed in both antennas is out of phase. The 
proposed antenna shows four bands in frequency range of 
1.85 - 6.9 GHz covering all important frequency bands for 
wireless technologies e.g, WLAN, Bluetooth, WiMAX, 
ISM band.

     Saleh et al. [37] proposed a non-uniform transmission 
line (NTL) based Vivaldi non-uniform slot profile antenna, 
as shown in Figure 13. Reduction in the taper slot length by 
33% was achieved by this. The proposed antenna provides 
S11 < −10 dB through 2.4 –13.55 GHz and finds use in 
various wireless communication applications. Kapoor et al. 
[38] proposed a vehicular antenna, as shown in Figure 13, to 
cover the frequency bands for LTE and the mid-band fifth-
generation (5G) systems by modifying the Vivaldi antenna 
which is in form of tapered slot structure. The antenna 
effectively connects mobile cellular networks and Internet 
on Vehicle (IoV) systems by virtue of its excellent 
directional radiation capability.

D. Miscellaneous 
 
      Biswas et al. [39] proposed a compact and wide band 
fractal Vivaldi antenna by implementing the nature fern 
inspired fractal leaf structure, as shown in Figure 14. The 
impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is around 
18.7 GHz ranging from 1.3 - 20 GHz. Zhang et al. [40] 
proposed the design of a novel Double-Slot Vivaldi Antenna 
(DSVA) with impedance bandwidth from 4.7 to 20 GHz, as 
shown in Figure 14. In comparison with former DSVAs, 
proposed antenna’s radiation characteristics and gain finds 
great improvement by inserting the double-antipodal 
structure, director (lens) and corrugated edges in antenna 
aperture. Moosazadeh et al. [41] proposed an UWB AVA 
for civil engineering purposes.  The inner edges of the upper 
and bottom radiators of the Conventional AVA (CAVA) 
have been suitably bent to enhance impedance bandwidth. 
Further, comb-shape slits have been applied to the edges of 
the radiators to improve F-to-B ratio and its gain. The result 
shows an impedance bandwidth between 1.65 - 18 GHz.

Figure 14. Fabricated prototypes [39][40][41]. 
 
     Wang et al. [42] proposed a compact coplanar waveguide 
fed AVA embedded with two pairs of elliptically shaped 
loads and tapered slots for improving the radiation 
performance, as shown in Figure 15. The wide measured 
impedance band width achieved is from 1.3 GHz to 17 GHz. 
Moosazadeh et al. [43] proposed a modified UWB AVA for 
frequency range (3.4–40 GHz), as shown in Figure 15. The 
slit edge method is used to enhance the gain at lower 
frequencies, forming a Periodic Slit Edge AVA (PSEAVA). 
Thereafter, to further improve the directivity, a Trapezoid-
shaped Dielectric Lens (TDL) is added as an addendum to 
the substrate. Moosazadeh et al. [44] proposed a compact 
AVA operating from 1 to 30 GHz for assessment of 
construction material. The conventional AVA's inner edges 
have been bent to extend the lower frequency range. 
Further, slit edge method is utilized to enhance the gain and 
lastly an elliptical-shaped dielectric lens is added to the 
substrate to attain high front-to-back ratio and gain. 
 
              
  
  
 
 
   Figure 15. Fabricated prototypes [42][43][44]. 
 
     Deng et al. [45] proposed an AVA integrated with 
Double-Ridged Substrate Integrated Waveguide (DRSIW), 
as shown in Figure 16. DRSIW can attain a lower cut-off 
frequency as compared to usual SIW due to the inserted 
ridge. Therefore, DRSIW-fed AVA achieves a decrease in 
cut-off frequency with improved bandwidth as compared to 
Vivaldi 
antennas 
fed 
by 
SIW. 
The 
bandwidth 
with |S11|≤−10 dB lies in the range of 11.0 GHz to 40 GHz. 
Recently, [46] has proposed Vivaldi antenna array using 
Ceramic LTCC substrate materials for low loss, high 
frequency circuit carriers for 6G wireless communication 
technology and millimeter wave radar. 
 
     
     
 
 
Figure 16. Fabricated prototypes [45] [46]. 
 
     Vivaldi antenna has several advantages e.g., broadband 
characteristics, easy impedance matching to the feeding line, 
compact size, etc. In spite of many advantages of the 
Vivaldi antenna, it still suffers from a few drawbacks, such 
as tilted beam, moderate gain and mostly being costlier due 
to the complex fabrication process. 
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
    In this paper, various techniques for improving the 
performance of Vivaldi antenna along with their application 
areas are presented. The basic ideas behind the working 
principle of Vivaldi and various optimizing techniques are 
discussed. Further, several recent works using Vivaldi 
antenna for various areas of communication e.g., Satellite 
communication, 
Vehicular 
communication, 
Wireless 
application, RADAR, UWB, MIMO etc. are briefly 
reviewed.
