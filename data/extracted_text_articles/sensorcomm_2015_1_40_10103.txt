Abstract—Indoor Position Estimation System (IPES) via RSSI 
and Trilateration using three fixed nodes is method to identify 
the location of the moving node in the building. The location of 
the moving node can be estimated within a range of relatively 
small error by using the three fixed nodes. This paper suggests 
that replacing one of the three fixed nodes with the drone 
located outside can be used to estimate the location of the 
moving node in the building. And finally, it is proved that the 
person could be scanned by a drone that is outside the building.

INTRODUCTION  
Current Location-Based Services (LBSs), about Outside 
Position Estimation, are available because of GPS technology. 
It came with a lot of development in the present, and now that 
is applied to the majority of the smart phones or mobile 
devices. On the contrary, Indoor Position Estimation cannot 
use GPS technology because of interference from buildings. 
Therefore, Indoor Position Estimation uses the Wireless LAN 
(WLAN), WiBro, RFID, Zigbee, and etc. Among them, the 
utilization of indoor position estimation using the WLAN is 
better than the others. One of the best thing among the WLAN 
infrastructure components is WiFi, because WiFi is 
continuously developing new versions, so WiFi`s data transfer 
rate was gradually improved. It can be used valuably for inside 
position estimation.  
 
In this paper, two indoor fixed nodes and the third indoor 
fixed nodes are replaced by a drone from outside, and these 
fixed nodes are possible to estimate the location of the moving 
nodes in a building. To do this, three fixed nodes and one 
moving node are connected to the WiFi, and Signal loss 
calculated by the Friis formula using the signal intensity got 
via RSSI. After then, the mobile device estimates the distance 
from each fixed nodes to moving node. Finally, drone 
estimates the location of the moving node based on the 
position of the three fixed nodes using the trilateration.  
This paper is organized as follow. In Section 2, it presents 
a method for estimating the location using the moving node in 
three fixed nodes and one moving node through the existing 
RSSI method. In Section 3, we introduce the test bed to 
experiment with one fixed node replaced with a drone and test 
procedures. In Section 4, we present the experimental values 
obtained from our experiments on the test bed in tables and 
graphs. Finally, in Section 5, using the drone of the outside 
would conclude it possible to scan for devices inside the 
building by analyzing the values obtained in the experiment.

INDOOR POSITION ESTIMATION SYSTEM 
A. RSSI measurement 
RSSI denotes the received signal strength, and the units of 
RSSI using ‘dB’. This is the same in WiFi. And, the high value 
of RSSI expressed as a negative number is clear signal 
intensity. As the moving distance of the signal is long, the 
strength of signal is weakened. With this feature, the signal 
strength received from the AP is used to estimate the distance 
from AP. The accuracy of position estimation using the RSSI 
is dependent on the high accuracy RSSI value and the 
environment of the measurement. Therefore, Position 
estimation method using the RSSI is showing relatively low 
reliability in an accuracy and a stability. Nevertheless the 
position estimating method using the RSSI uses widely, 
because the number of places WiFi Access zone has increased 
than before.  
An important feature of wireless signal transmission is that 
the signal strength decreases as the distance increases. The 
value of the distance measurement of the RSSI is determined 
by changing of the signal intensity corresponding to the 
moving distance of the signal. It will obtain a moving distance 
between the respective nodes from the change of the RSSI 
value according to the moving distance of the signal. 
Researchers have done some effective researches about 
signals in different transmission environment [1], and 
conclude some good empirical formula.

𝐺𝑡 is Transmitting antenna gain, 𝐺𝑟is Receiver antenna gain, 
c is thr velocity of light, f is carrier frequency, ρ is Channel 
attenuation coefficient (value 2~6), v is the Gaussian random 
variable which considered the shadow effect, then v ~ 
N(0, 𝛿2), d is the distance, 𝐿𝑑 is the channel loss after the 
distance d. In practice, we get the relation between RSSI and 
the distance through the measurement showing the relation for 
transmission power and receiving power by the following 
formula [2]. 
 
                                          𝑃𝑅 = 𝑃𝑇
𝑟𝑛                                             (3) 
 
After conversion was 
 
                            𝑃𝑅(𝑑𝑏) = 𝐴 − 10 × 𝑛 log 𝑟                       (4) 
 
𝑃𝑅  is the receiving power of the wireless signal, 𝑃𝑇  is 
transmission power, n is the Propagation factor, r is the 
distance between Transceiver Unit. A is the receiving signal 
power when the signal transmit 1 meter. The numerical value 
of constant A and n determined the relation between receiving 
signal strength and signal transmission distance. 
B. Trilateration. 
 
The Trilateration is a method to obtain the relative position 
of the object using the triangular geometry as with 
triangulation. Unlike Triangulation, using one of the sides and 
two included angles of a triangle, Trilateration need two or 
more reference points, the distance between the target and the 
respective reference point to find the location of the target [3]. 
Only using Trilateration requires at least three reference points 
in order to accurately determine the relative position of the 
two-dimensional surface. In Fig. 2. The plane z = 0, shows the 
three sphere centers, P1, P2, and P3; their x, y-coordinates; 
and the three sphere radii, r1, r2, and r3 [4]. The two 
intersections of the three sphere surfaces are directly in front 
and directly behind the point designated intersections in the z 
= 0 plane. 
The intersections of the surfaces of three spheres is found 
by formulating the equations for the three sphere surfaces and 
then solving the three equations for the three unknowns, x, y, 
and z. To simplify the calculations, the equations are 
formulated so that the centers of the spheres are on the z = 0 
plane. Also, the formulation is such that one center is at the 
origin, and one other is on the x-axis. It is possible to 
formulate the equations in this manner since any three non-
collinear points lie on a unique plane. After finding the 
solution, it can be transformed back to the original three 
dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Next three 
equations for the three spheres

2 = (𝑥 − 𝑖)2 + (𝑦 − 𝑗)2 + 𝑧2 
     (7) 
C. Position estimation using the RSSI and Trilateration 
After measuring the intensity of a signal through the RSSI, 
the distance is calculated by using the Friis formula between 
the mobile node and the fixed node. Friis formula is as follows. 
 
                              d =

Distance measurement method by the signal intensity is used 
to Friis formula above.

c is the Transmitting velocity, f is the frequency of the radio, 
L is the loss of the received signal. L is obtained by subtracting 
Intensity of the received signal at the reference point from 
Received signal intensity Fig. 3. The equations to obtain the 
distance from each AP as follows. [5]

                           𝑑3
2 = (𝑥 − 𝑥3)2 + (𝑦 − 𝑦3)2  
     (11) 
 
The using of RSSI values measured at the location with no 
obstructions is calculated as the actual value. The error 
between the actual distance and the calculated distance 
becomes large if the RSSI value is measured from the wrong 
environment. [6]

EXPERIMENTAL DATA ANALYSIS 
A. Analysis results 
 
Figure 7. AP`s RSSI values measured at (3,4) 
 
Figure 8. AP`s RSSI values measured at starting point (0,0) 
 
Fig. 7 is AP`s RSSI values measured at (3,4). Each value 
is measured that AP1 RSSI value = -54 dB, AP2 RSSI 
value = -56 dB, AP3 RSSI value = -62 dB. Fig. 8 is AP`s 
RSSI values measured at starting point (0,0). Each value 
is measured that AP1 RSSI value = -59 dB, AP2 RSSI 
value = -57 dB, AP3 RSSI value = -63 dB. 
 
Before calculating the distance between the AP and 
the moving node by the RSSI values using the (8), c is 
propagation speed, and this value is set to ‘3 × 108’, and 
the frequency of AP1 is 2.4Ghz, the frequency of AP2 is 
5Ghz, the frequency of AP3 is 2.4Ghz. Calculating the (8) 
have this values, it is as follows.

The actual distance between AP and the moving node in Fig. 
6. As follows, 
 
𝑑1 = 225cm, 𝑑2 = 135cm, 𝑑3 = 250cm 
Analysis of the error between the calculated distance with the 
RSSI 
value 
and 
actual 
distance 
is 
as 
follows. 
 
 
Distance difference (AP1 and Moving node between 
the actual distance) and (distance calculated as the 
RSSI value) is (225cm – 176cm = 49cm), and the 
error rate is 27.8%. 
 
Distance difference (AP2 and Moving node between 
the actual distance) and (distance calculated as the 
RSSI value) is (135cm – 42.5cm = 92.5cm), and the 
error rate is 217%. 
 
Distance difference (AP3 and Moving node between 
the actual distance) and (distance calculated as the 
RSSI value) is (250cm – 88cm = 162cm), and the 
error rate is 184%. 
B. Error Anlaysis 
The most significant error was calculated between 𝑑2 and 
𝑑2
` , the error between 𝑑1  and 𝑑1
`  was the least. First, an 
analysis of the largest error that occurred in AP2. The 
difference between the RSSI value of the Fig. 7 and RSSI 
value of Fig. 8 hardly occurs because the moving node and 
AP2 are close. Errors in AP1 showed a relatively appropriate 
amount to 27.8%. Lastly, an analysis of the error that 
occurred in AP3. Error has occurred since AP3 is located in 
the outdoor, so signal is interfered by the wall when the signal 
transmitted. 
The way to reduce the above error is as follows. In order 
to reduce the error arising from the AP2, the distance between 
the AP and the moving node has to be ensured over a certain 
distance. In order to reduce the error that occurred in AP1, 
RSSI values measured several times, it is possible to reduce 
the error by using the average value of these values. 
Lastly, in order to reduce the error that occurred in AP3, the 
position of the drone moves to less radio interference place 
[7].

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, we confirmed that it is possible to scan a 
person by a drone that is located outside the building and 
connected with AP inside of the building. If a mobile device 
has the appropriate distance between the mobile device and 
the AP and the little signal interference, we can efficiently 
estimate the indoor position of the mobile device. If this 
tracking function is developed, we will quickly find people 
who need help a help in a disaster area.
