Abstract — Having in mind picture of future all-IP network, as 
well as fixed-mobile convergence, interworking between 
Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and 
external networks is crucial for providing end-to-end Quality 
of Service (QoS). For the purpose of achieving QoS in all-IP 
mobile networks, particularly for broadband multimedia 
services, Differentiated Services (DiffServ) mechanism should 
be applied to UMTS technology. This paper proposes using of 
Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) scheduler, with the main idea of 
mapping voice and video telephony in two different QoS 
classes and virtual queues, but at the same time using Priority 
Queuing (PQ) within LLQ for both voice and video telephony 
over all other QoS classes. To proof the concept, a simulation 
study was performed using Network Simulator version 2 (ns-
2). Evaluation results of simulation study are presented for 
UMTS traffic that passes through UMTS core network and 
overloaded external IP backbone network. Performances of 
LLQ scheduler are compared with other most widely used 
scheduling algorithms such as Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), 
Weighted Round Robin (WRR) and Priority Queuing (PQ). 
The main objective of simulation was to provide QoS 
parameters such as IP Transfer Delay (IPTD), IP Delay 
Variation (IPDV) and IP Loss Rate (IPLR) for conversational 
and streaming traffic classes below standard defined values 
but not to completely exhaust bandwidth for interactive and 
background traffic classes. The obtained results were 
statistically processed using Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0.

 INTRODUCTION  
Within 
core 
network 
of 
Universal 
Mobile 
Telecommunication 
System 
(UMTS), 
IP 
Multimedia 
Subsystem (IMS) [1] presents foundation of network which 
is completely based on Internet Protocol (IP) and provides 
support for multimedia services like Voice over IP (VoIP) 
and Video Streaming. As new multimedia services require 
higher restrictions in network parameters and have different 
requirements, the support for Quality of Service (QoS) is 
necessary. Prominent advantage of UMTS is its ability to 
provide diverse services with QoS guarantees. This paper 
will focus on the analysis of ensuring QoS for UMTS real-
time traffic (Conversational and Streaming traffic class) in a 
mixed network environment, composed of the UMTS core 
network and IP external domain. For providing QoS in IP 
networks, IETF has developed different QoS mechanisms, 
like Differentiated Services (DiffServ) [2] and Integrated 
Services (IntServ) [3]. IntServ have scalability and 
complexity problems, while DiffServ can be implemented in 
UMTS network with little or no management complexity. 
DiffServ architecture is based on a simple model where 
traffic entering a network is classified and conditioned at the 
boundaries of the network according to the Differentatied 
Services Code Point (DSCP) field in IP header, and assigned 
to different behavior aggregates. Within the core of the 
network, packets are forwarded according to the Per-Hop 
Behaviours (PHB) associated with the DSCP. PHB 
definitions do not specify any particular implementation 
mechanism 
and 
therefore 
the 
problem 
of 
PHB 
implementation has recently gained significant attention.  
According to 3GPP specifications, mapping of UMTS traffic 
classes into PHB can be done in gateway GPRS Support 
Node (GGSN), in order to get efficient PHB configurations 
[4]. Standard QoS mapping authorizes both voice and video 
telephony to be mapped to the same QoS class. Video traffic 
has larger packet sizes than voice traffic and can cause 
significant delay of voice packets when aggregating both 
together to the same QoS class. Authors in paper [5] have 
analyzed refined mapping between voice and video 
telephony but do not take other UMTS traffic classes into 
account. On the other side, in paper [6] are discussed QoS 
aspects both for real-time and non real-time traffic in UMTS 
simulation environment, but only in case of Priority Queuing 
(PQ) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR) schedulers. 
Dekeris, et al., [7] combine WFQ and LLQ, but the main 
drawback of this idea is the property that delay of high 
priority class (Video conferencing) could be reduced, but at 
the same time Voice traffic got the highest delay time. In our 
paper is presented concept of mapping voice and video 
telephony to different QoS classes and idea of implementing 
Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) traffic scheduler on network 
elements. Within LLQ, Priority Queuing (PQ) is used for 
scheduling of both voice and video telephony with respect to 
other traffic classes. Performances of LLQ scheduler are 
compared with other most available traffic scheduling 
algorithms such as Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), 
Weighted Round Robin (WRR) and Priority Queuing (PQ). 
In this paper, network congestion effect on QoS parameters 
for real-time traffic is investigated, that is conversational and 
streaming traffic classes. The aim of our proposed model 
was to provide IP Transfer Delay (IPTD), IP Delay Variation

This paper is organized as follows. Section II makes a

and DiffServ domain. Section III provides overview of 
scheduling algorithms which will be used in simulation

work. 
II. 
UMTS TO DIFFSERV QOS MAPPING 
3GPP standard proposes a layered architecture for the 
support of end-to-end QoS. To realize a certain network 
QoS, a Bearer Service (BS) with clearly defined 
functionalities has to be set up from the source to the 
destination of a service and includes all aspects to enable the 
provision of a contracted QoS. 
UMTS BS attributes form a QoS profile and define the 
grade of service provided by the UMTS network to the user 
of the UMTS bearer service. UMTS specification [8] defines 
four traffic classes and they are: conversational, streaming, 
interactive and background. The main difference between 
these classes is how delay sensitive the traffic is. 
Applications of conversational and streaming classes are the 
most delay sensitive and intended for real-time traffic, while 
applications of interactive and background classes require 
higher reliability. Examples of applications are voice and 
video telephony for Conversational class and Video 
Streaming for the Streaming class. Interactive class is used 
by interactive applications like interactive web browsing, 
while Background class can be used for background 
download of e-mails. 
Since the UMTS packet switched core network is based 
on an IP, DiffServ can be used for QoS provisioning. Figure 
1 shows the example of how end-to-end QoS may be 
accomplished for a significant number of scenarios. In this 
paper, first scenario from 3GPP specification has been 
chosen, where the GGSN supports DiffServ Edge function 
and the IP network is DiffServ enabled. The application layer 
identifies QoS requirements, which are mapped into Packet 
Data Protocol (PDP) context parameters in UE. Local 
mechanism in the UE uses the PDP context for QoS over the 
UMTS access network, and the IP backbone network uses 
DiffServ to provide QoS guarantees.  According to [5] IP BS 
manager is located in GGSN and uses standard IP 
mechanisms to manage IP bearer service. Provision of IP BS 
manager is optional in User Equipment (UE) and mandatory 
in the GGSN. Translation/Mapping function in GGSN 
provides interworking between the mechanisms and 
parameters used within the UMTS bearer service and those 
used within the IP bearer service. It is operator’s choice to 
define the mechanisms for the provisioning of resources 
among the different DiffServ PHB classes, as well as the 
mapping from the UMTS QoS classes, to the DSCP. The 
DiffServ working group of IETF has defined different PHB 
groups for different applications.  
 
Figure 1.  Network architecture for QoS conceptual model [5] 
The EF-PHB [9] is intended to support low-loss, low-
delay and low-jitter services. The EF guarantees that traffic 
is serviced at a rate that is at least equal to a configurable 
minimum service rate (regardless of the offered load and 
non-EF traffic) at both long and short intervals. IETF 
defines AF-PHB group in [10]. AF allows the operator to 
provide assurance of delivery as long as the traffic does not 
exceed some subscribed rate. Traffic that exceeds the 
subscription rate faces a higher probability of being dropped 
if congestion occurs. AF PHB defines four independent 
PHB classes, each with three dropping precedence level. 
Each corresponding PHB is known as AFij, where i 
represents AF class, while j is the drop precedence. Within 
an AF class, packets of drop precedence p experience a level 
of loss lower (or equal to) than the level of loss experienced 
by packets of drop precedence q if p<q.  Each AF class is 
configured with separate buffer and bandwidth. Default 
PHB has best effort forwarding characteristics.  
Service provider should consider all the UMTS QoS 
classes that are defined in network, aggregate these classes 
into a manageable set of new groups, based on their QoS 
requirements. Correspondingly, a set of available PHB that 
have similar characteristics should be chosen, and a one-to-
one mapping assigned. Traditionally, all traffic in 
Conversational class, i.e. voice and video telephony, should 
be mapped to the same EF class which is intended for 
critical voice traffic. In fact, voice packets have short and 
constant packet size while video packets have large and 
variable packet size. When injecting voice telephony traffic 
together with bursty video telephony traffic, video traffic 
can cause degradation as well as delay of voice service. 
Therefore we suggest the mapping of voice and video 
telephony to two different DiffServ virtual queues and 
DiffServ classes. Voice telephony is mapped to EF class and 
video telephony to AF11 class. Aggregate of Streaming 
class is mapped into AF21, as it requires low variation of 
delay and has higher delay constraint than the Interactive 
class but less constraint than the Conversational class 
Aggregate of Interactive class is mapped to AF31, and do 
not have special requirements, except reliability. Aggregate 
of Background class is mapped to default PHB.

TRAFFIC SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS 
PHB simply characterizes the externally observable 
forwarding 
behavior 
of 
a 
DiffServ 
router 
to 
the 
corresponding traffic stream. PHB definitions do not specify 
any particular implementation mechanism. To instantiate a 
particular PHB, network administrator activates and tunes an 
appropriate combination of specific packet-scheduling 
algorithms 
and 
Active 
Queue 
Management 
(AQM) 
mechanisms supported by the DiffServ router. The choice of 
a traffic scheduling algorithm is important for the 
implementation of behavior aggregates in a DiffServ 
network. When multiple queues are sharing common 
transmission media, there must be a scheduler to decide how 
to pick up packets from each queue to send out and is 
responsible for enforcing resource allocation to individual 
flows. If there is no congestion on the interface, packets are 
transmitted as they arrive. If the interface is experiencing 
congestion, scheduling algorithms are engaged. Scheduler 
performances have the highest impact on the level of service 
a packet receives [11]. The most popular and available 
scheduling algorithms in IP routers, and used in our 
simulation are: WFQ, WFF, PQ and LLQ. 
A. Priority queuing (PQ) 
In classic PQ, packets are first classified by the system 
and then placed into different priority queues. Packets are 
scheduled from the head of the given queue only if all 
queues of higher priority are empty. Within each of the 
priority queues, packets are scheduled in FIFO order. Benefit 
of PQ is relatively low computational load on the system. 
The biggest problem of using PQ is if the volume of higher-
priority traffic becomes excessive, lower priority traffic can 
be dropped as the buffer space allocated to low-priority 
queues starts to overflow. 
B. Weighted Round Robin (WRR) 
In WRR, packets are first classified into various service 
classes and then assigned to a queue that is specifically 
dedicated to that service class. Each of the queues is then 
serviced in a round robin (RR) order. The weight indicates 
how many packets have to be sent in each cycle from each 
queue. The WRR scheduler doesn’t take the size of the 
transmitted packets into account. As a result, it is difficult to 
predict the actual bandwidth that each queue obtains, but it 
ensures that all service classes have access to at least some 
configured amount of network bandwidth. 
C. Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) 
WFQ 
supports 
flows 
with 
different 
bandwidth 
requirements by giving each queue a weight that assigns it a 
different percentage of output port bandwidth. WFQ 
supports the fair distribution of bandwidth for variable-
length packets by approximating a generalized processor 
sharing (GPS) system. GPS [12] assumes that the input 
traffic is infinitely divisible and that all sessions can be 
served at the same time. GPS is a theoretical model and in 
reality it cannot be implemented. WFQ schedules packets 
according to their arrival time, size, and the associated 
weight. Upon the arrival of a new packet, a “virtual finish 
time” is calculated which represents time at which the same 
packet would finish to be served in the GPS system. WFQ 
outputs packets in the ascending order of the virtual finish 
time. 
D. Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) 
LLQ is a combination of PQ and Class-Based Weighted-
Fair Queuing (CBWFQ). CBWFQ extends the standard 
WFQ functionality to provide support for user-defined traffic 
classes. The LLQ, like PQ checks the low-latency queue first 
and takes a packet from that queue. If there are no packets in 
the low-latency queue, the normal scheduler logic applies to 
the other non-low-latency queues, giving them their 
guaranteed 
bandwidth. 
LLQ 
allows 
delay-sensitive 
applications such as voice to be given preferential treatment 
over all other traffic classes [13]. 
IV. 
SIMULATION MODEL 
Simulation is performed using network simulator ns2, 
which is an event-driven simulator targeted at networking 
research [14] and independent developed module for 
scheduling algorithms used in this paper [15]. Default 
implementation of LLQ within ns2 simulator, which 
supports scheduling of only one queue with PQ is changed 
in order to support scheduling of two queues with PQ (for 
voice and video telephony). The aim of simulation is to 
evaluate performances of our proposed idea in terms of QoS 
parameters and perform comparison with other schedulers 
such as WFQ, WRR and PQ where voice and video 
telephony are mapped to the same virtual queue and traffic 
class. According to ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541 [16], 
QoS parameters for conversational traffic class should be:  
• IP Transfer Delay, IPTD ≤ 100 ms, 
• IP Delay Variation, IPDV ≤ 50 ms, 
• IP Loss Rate, IPLR ≤ 10-3,  
while for streaming traffic class these parameters should be: 
• IP Transfer Delay, IPTD ≤ 400 ms, 
• IP Delay Variation, IPDV ≤ 50 ms, 
• IP Loss Rate, IPLR ≤ 10-3. 
Simulation model is presented in Figure 2. UMTS 
infrastructure is not fully simulated (radio interface), only the 
core network between SGSN and GGSN which is not 
congested. This is not inconsistent with the concept of 
UMTS architecture which specifies that access and core 
networks are independent [17].

Figure 2.  Simulation model 
The capacities of links in external IP backbone are 
dimensioned in a way to implement network configuration 
whose load equals 20%. Starting from this configuration, we 
decrease the capacity of appropriate links gradually to 200% 
according to the amount of traffic passing through external 
IP backbone, which is 6Mb/s and is constant during all 
simulation. Voice telephony traffic sources are represented 
with Exponential (EXP) traffic generator, which generates 4 
flows with packet size of 80 bytes and 100 kb/s rate, while 
video telephony sources generate 5 flows with 1000 bytes 
and 100kb/s rate. Constant Bit Rate (CBR) generator is used 
in order to generate 16 video traffic flows with packet size of 
1000 bytes and 300 kb/s rate. Interactive traffic sources are 
simulated with Telnet application, and generate 12 flows 
with 500 bytes packets size with 100 kb/s rate. Background 
data sources are configured with File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP) traffic generator with 1000 bytes packet length and 10 
kb/s rate from 18 flows. CBR and EXP traffic generators are 
attached to UDP agents, while FTP and Telnet traffic 
generators are attached to TCP agents. Conversational traffic 
(voice and video telephony together) produces 15%, 
streaming traffic produces 80%, while interactive and 
background traffic produce 2% and 3% of overall generated 
traffic. Time Sliding Window 2 Color Marker (TSW2CM) is 
used as a policer to determine how to mark and prioritize the 
packet according to user requirements. Weighted Random 
Early Detection (WRED) is used as Active Queue 
Management mechanism for Streaming and Interactive 
traffic, while for Conversational and Background traffic is 
used Drop Tail. In case that PQ scheduler is used, 
Conversational traffic has the highest priority, while 
Background traffic has the lowest priority. Weights of other 
schedulers are configured in such a way, that weight 
represents percentage of output port bandwidth: 15 for 
Conversational, 80 for Streaming, 2 for Interactive and 3 for 
Background traffic class. The queue lengths are constant and 
are defined with 30 packets for Conversational class and 50 
packets for all other traffic classes. Simulation results in this 
paper are depicted only for second flow generated from all 
traffic sources, which is chosen randomly, but could be for 
any of the generated flows. 
As we can see from Figures 3a and 3b, average end-to-
end delay for Conversational traffic class (for both voice and 
video telephony) stays within 100 ms only when PQ and 
LLQ are implemented on network nodes. Considering the 
effect of different schedulers on average end-to-end delay for 
Streaming traffic, which is depicted in Figure 3c, we can 
notice that all schedulers have almost the same performances 
and provide satisfactory level of QoS according to reference 
[16]. Results from Figures 3d and 3e show that jitter stays 
below 30 ms for voice telephony and below 35 ms for video 
telephony in all experiments. The same behavior is also 
observed in Figure 3f, for Streaming traffic, where jitter is 
lower than 12ms for all schedulers. Results for jitter show 
non-monotonic behavior: increasing with the network load, 
reaching some maximum and the decreasing. More network 
latency is necessary in order to deliver a stream due to 
network congestion. In Figures 3g and 3h packet loss rate for 
voice and video telephony is presented. Network congestion 
has the greatest influence on WRR scheduler, which does not 
perform satisfactory when network is overloaded more than 
100%. On the other side, there is no packet loss for PQ and 
LLQ schedulers. Similarly, in Figure 3i, packet loss rate for 
Streaming traffic is presented; we see that it remains below 
0.2% for all schedulers except WRR, even under heavy 
network congestion of 200%.   
Table II depicts the average values of the link throughput 
between nodes CORE2 and EDGE for Interactive and 
Background traffic classes. As expected, when PQ 
scheduling algorithm is used, lower priority classes are 
starving and throughput is equal zero for both Interactive and 
Background traffic classes when network congestion in 
higher than 120%. LLQ on the other side provides fair level 
of bandwidth for lower priority classes, and at the same time 
fulfills QoS requirements for Conversational and Streaming 
traffic classes. From all these experiments, it can be 
concluded that our approach of using LLQ scheduler and 
mapping of voice and video into two different classes

provides critical performance parameters for voice and

are consequence of handling Conversational traffic with 
strict priority over all other traffic classes. 
The obtained results are statistically processed using 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 
17.0.  The null hypothesis states that QoS parameters can be 
guaranteed when using LLQ. Against the null hypothesis is 
setup the alternative hypothesis. The 95% confidence 
interval is chosen, which relates to level of statistical 
significance of p<0.05. The regression analysis is conducted 
to find the relationship that explains how the variation in 
IPTD/IPDV/IPLR values for Conversational and Streaming 
traffic classes, depends on the variation in network overload.  
Coefficient of correlation (r) is measured to give the true 
direction 
the 
correlation, 
while 
the 
coefficient 
of 
determination (r2) is measured to give the strength of 
correlation. Using comparative analysis of different 
regression models in SPSS, we have decided to use cubic 
polynomial regression model since it has the highest value of 
determination coefficient r2. The results of regression 
analysis have been summarized in Table III only for our 
approach of using LLQ scheduler as it provides the best 
performances among all other simulated schedulers.

From Table III, we can see that regression dependency 
between packet loss and link load percentage for 
conversational traffic is not possible to determine. Value of 
packet loss rate is constant and is always zero for 
conversational traffic class no matter how high is traffic 
overload in external IP backbone network. For all other 
results depicted in Table III, p value (significance) is greater 
than 0.05, which means that there is almost no statistical 
relationship between QoS parameters and link load 
percentage when LLQ scheduler is used.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
QoS as an end-to-end concept has to be satisfied through 
the interworking of all the entities the UMTS traffic is 
passing through. In order to achieve desired end-to-end 
performances, it is crucial to define efficient QoS mapping 
scheme between UMTS services and IP QoS classes in case 
of DiffServ based network. This paper presented one 
example of mapping which was implemented on GGSN and 
EDGE nodes, as they perform DiffServ edge function in our 
simulation model. That approach suggested mapping of 
voice and video telephony into two different QoS classes and 
virtual queues. Other important problem which was pointed 
out in our work concerns the implementation of PHB and the 
choice of traffic scheduling algorithm. We proposed the idea 
of using LLQ scheduler, with PQ scheduling for both voice 
and video telephony over all other traffic classes. Default 
implementation of LLQ scheduler in ns2 has been changed 
in order to support scheduling of two virtual queues with 
Priority Queuing. The results from our simulation study 
indicate that using LLQ provides better performances than 
using WFQ, PQ and WRR schedulers in terms of QoS 
parameters such as IPTD, IPDV and IPLR for real-time 
UMTS traffic. Results obtained from statistical analysis 
indicate that there is almost no statistical relationship 
between the performance metrics of Real-time services and 
the network load when novel approach is used. Future work 
will focus on hierarchical traffic scheduling in order to 
perform refined scheduling between voice and video 
telephony.
