Abstract—This paper considers a new Data and Energy Inte-
grated Network (DEIN), which conceives an Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) and numerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices on
the ground. The UAV is capable of transmitting data and energy
to the IoT devices. The UAV in the air wirelessly charges the IoT
devices with Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology, and the
IoT devices start Wireless Information Transfer (WIT) after the
charging process. In this paper, the channel model and data and
energy transmission model between the UAV and IoT devices are
established. In order to minimize the total energy consumption
of the UAV, this paper proposes an energy-efficient resource
allocation algorithm by jointly optimizing of the trajectory of
the UAV, the communication scheduling and charging fraction of
the IoT devices on the ground. Successive convex approximation
and block coordinate descent algorithm are introduced in this
paper to address the optimization problem. Both the effectiveness
and the efficiency of the proposed joint optimization algorithm
have been validated with the simulation.
Keywords—Data and Energy Integrated Network (DEIN); Un-
manned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); Internet of Things (IoT); Wireless

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of science and technology, the
Internet of Things has been everywhere and has effectively
improved people’s production and life in many areas like
industrial and agricultural production, oil and gas field ex-
ploration and acquisition and so on [1]. With the widespread
deployment and use of IoT devices, these IoT devices are
always working. For example, the IoT sensors continue col-
lecting and uploading data [2], and the energy consumption
keeps increasing [3]. Therefore, the energy consumption of the
Internet of Things has become a big challenge for its future
development.
This paper considers a new type of IoT network, which
consists of a mobile base station and multiple fixed battery-
free IoT devices. The mobile base station in this paper mainly
refers to UAV. Due to the advantages of high flexibility
and low cost, UAVs have been widely used in agriculture,
industry, military and other fields [4] [5]. As a mobile base
station, the UAV can act as a flexible communication platform
in the air to collect and process data from ground devices
[6]. Many researchers have deployed UAVs appropriately to
achieve seamless coverage of the target environment. The
throughput of the wireless networks can be improved a lot [7]–
[9]. The performance of the network can be further improved
by optimizing the trajectory of the UAV [10] [11]. However,
most of the literatures mainly consider the improvement of the
communication performance of the system by UAV, and few of
them consider the system energy supply by UAV. In addition
to WIT, the UAV considered in this paper also supports WPT
technology [12], which can be used to wirelessly charge
IoT devices and provide energy for IoT devices in remote
or complex environments [13]. Under such background, this
paper considers the UAV supporting both WIT and WPT. The
UAV can charge the ground IoT devices with WPT technology
[14] and collect data from them. Although this paper assumes
that the energy of the UAV is sufficient for its working task,
the energy consumption of the UAV will have a great impact
on the overall performance of the system, which cannot be
ignored. Therefore, this paper aims to minimize the overall
energy consumption of the UAV by jointly optimizing the
UAV’s flight trajectory and the IoT devices’ communication
scheduling and charging fractions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, the system model is established in detail and the
energy consumption minimization problem is formulated. The
optimization problem is solved in Section III. On top of that,
the proposed energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm
aiming to minimize the energy consumption of the UAV is
designed and clarified in detail. The performance evaluation
based on simulation experiments is presented in Section IV.
Finally, this paper concludes in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
The wireless data and energy transmission system based on
mobile base station is shown in the Figure 1. This system is
mainly composed of one UAV flying in the air and several IoT
devices with fixed positions on the ground. The UAV flies over
these IoT devices according to a certain trajectory. The radio
front of the UAV is a directional antenna fixed on a 2-DOF
Pan-tilt. The horizontal and vertical direction of the antenna
can be freely adjusted according to the position of the target
charging device. Thus, the UAV can aim at the target charging
device for directional wireless energy transmission with high
charging efficiency. The radio front of all the IoT devices on
the ground is a fixed omnidirectional antenna. By default, all

IoT devices on the ground are always in a dormant state. In
each time slot, only one device is served by the UAV. The
corresponding device only wakes up when the UAV transmits
radio frequency (RF) energy to it in a certain time slot. After
the wireless charging is completed, the IoT device will upload
its data to the UAV.
Figure 1. UAV-enabled data and energy integrated network.
In this section, the total number of all the IoT devices
is denoted as K, so the number set of all the IoT devices
is denoted as K = {1, 2, · · · , K}. Thus, the set of all the
IoT devices can be donated as UE = {UEk|∀k ∈ K}. This
paper assumes that during a complete UAV flight cycle, the
UAV takes off from its starting position and returns to its
starting position when the flight is over. Consequently, a
closed-loop flight trajectory is formed. For the convenience
of problem-formulation and problem-solving, the continuous
flight trajectory of UAV is discretely processed in this paper.
The flight cycle of UAV is set as a constant, which is denoted
as T. The trajectory of the UAV during the whole flight cycle
is divided into M points, which all have same duration of
time. Thus, the M time slots have same duration of time
∆τ =
T
M . When the length of each time slot ∆τ is set
sufficiently small, it can be approximately considered that the
position of the UAV will not change within this time slot.
In this paper, all time slots in a flight cycle of UAV are
numbered, so the set of all time slot numbers can be denoted
as M = {1, 2, · · · , M} and the set of all timeslots can be
denoted as Slot = {Slott|∀t ∈ M}. To sum up, the UAV flight
trajectory is discretized into M positions, and the path of the
entire flight cycle can be obtained by solving the problem of
the UAV position within M time slots.
A. Wireless Communication Model
The position of the UAV is represented by 3D Cartesian
coordinate system, as shown below.
[q (t) , H]T , q (t) = [x (t) , y (t)] , ∀t ∈ M
(1)
where q (t) ∈ R1×2 denotes the coordinate of the UAV in
Slott. H denotes the flight altitude of the UAV in Slott and it’s
set as a constant in this paper. [•]T represents the transposition
of the matrix. Similarly, the IoT devices on the ground can be
represented as follows.
[wk, 0]T , wk = [xk, yk] , ∀k ∈ K
(2)
where wk ∈ R1×2 denotes the horizontal coordinate of UEk.
The altitude of all the IoT devices on the ground is set to
0. The free space path loss model is adopted in this paper
since the UAV is at a certain altitude during each working
cycle, which mainly considers the Line of Sight (LoS) com-
munication and transmission link between the UAV and the
ground IoT devices. The channel gain mainly depends on the
distance between the UAV and the IoT devices on the ground.
According to the UAV and the IoT devices’ coordinates, the
distance between the UAV and the corresponding UEk in
Slott can be represented as follows.
dk (t) =
q
∥q (t) − wk∥2 + H2, ∀k ∈ K, t ∈ M
(3)
The channel gain between the UAV and the corresponding
UEk in Slott can be represented as:
hk (t) =
β0
d2k (t) =
β0
∥q (t) − wk∥2 + H2 , ∀k ∈ K, t ∈ M
(4)
where β0 denotes the channel power gain when the reference
distance is set to 1 meter. Consequently, it can be seen that the
channel gain varies in different time slots, and it is assumed
that the channel gain remains unchanged in the same time slot.
A binary variable is defined to represent the scheduling of
the IoT devices on the ground, which is denoted as ak (t).
Thus, it meets the following condition:
ak (t) = {0, 1} , ∀k ∈ K, t ∈ M
(5)
ak (t) represents the scheduling variable of UEk in Slott,
where ak (t) = 1 represents the UEk is first wirelessly charged
by the UAV and uploads data to the UAV in Slott. On the
contrary, it means the UEk is not served by the UAV in Slott
when ak (t) = 0. This paper assumes that in each time slot,
only one UE can be served by UAV. Therefore ak (t) should
be subject to (6):
K
X
k=1
ak (t) ≤ 1, ∀t ∈ M
(6)
Besides, the variable of charging proportion is defined to
represent the charging time allocation of the IoT device when
it is scheduled. It is denoted as ξk (t) and meets the following
condition:
0 ≤ ξk (t) ≤ 1, ∀k ∈ K, t ∈ M
(7)
Equation (7) represents the charging proportion of UEk in
Slott. Thus, the proportion of data uploading can be obtained
as 1 − ξk (t). ξk (t) = 0 means UEk only uploads data to the
UAV but without being charged by the UAV in Slott. On the
other hand, ξk (t) = 1 means UEk spends all the time of Slott
on harvesting wireless energy transmitted from the UAV but
without uploading data to the UAV. According to the classic

Shannon’s channel capacity equation, the achievable data rate
of UEk in Slott can be formulated as (8):
rk (t) = Blog2

1 +
Pkβ0
(∥q(t)−wk∥2+H2)σ2

,
∀k ∈ K, t ∈ M
(8)
where B represents the bandwidth of wireless channel, Pk
represents the transmission power of data uploading of UEk in
Slott, and σ2 represents the noise power at the signal receiver
of the UAV. Dk is defined as the total data transmission
requirements of UEk during the whole flight cycle of the
UAV. These data is cached in the buffer area of the device. It is
assumed that the UEk needs to complete the data transmission
task before the end of a flight cycle of the UAV, and the
constraint of data transmission can be obtained as (9):
M
X
t=1
ak (t) rk (t) (1 − ξk (t)) ∆τ ≥ Dk, ∀k ∈ K
(9)
B. Energy Consumption Model of IoT devices
The power of wireless charging from the UAV to the IoT
devices on the ground is assumed as constant, which is denoted
as PU. Within any time slot, when the designated IoT device is
scheduled and the corresponding wireless charging proportion
variable is non-zero, the UAV will wirelessly transmit RF
energy to this device in this time slot. In Slotm, the total
energy received by UEk can be formulated as (10):
Ek (m) =
m
X
t=1
ηβ0ak (t) PUξk (t) ∆τ
∥q (t) − wk∥2 + H2 , ∀k ∈ K, m ∈ M
(10)
where η represents the conversion efficiency of the UE to
convert the received RF signal into DC electric energy that
can be directly utilized by the load. It is set to a constant in
this paper. In order to ensure UEk has enough energy for data
uploading, its energy reception and consumption should meet
the energy constraint (11) in Slotm.
Ek (m)−
m
X
t=1
ak (t) (1 − ξk (t)) Pk∆τ ≥ εk, ∀k ∈ K, m ∈ M
(11)
where εk is a constant to ensure UEk has sufficient residual
energy.
C. Energy Consumption Model of the UAV
The energy consumption of UAV mainly includes two
parts: the energy consumed by its own flight and the energy
consumed by wireless charging for the ground energy IoT
device. The energy consumed by UAV within a complete flight
cycle [15] can be expressed as (12):
Ef =

2 + P2νv (t))
(12)
where d0, ρ, s and G respectively represent the fuselage
resistance ratio of the UAV, the air density, the rotor stiffness of
the UAV and the rotor disk area of the UAV. νh (t) and νv (t)
respectively represent the horizontal flight speed and vertical
flight speed of the UAV in Slott. P0, P1 and P2 respectively
represent the blade profile power, induction power of the UAV
and constants related to the vertical flight of the UAV. Utip
represents the tip speed of the UAV’s rotor blade. ν0 represents
the rotor induced velocity while the UAV is hovering.
In the scenario of data and energy transmission between
the UAV and the ground IoT device considered in this paper,
since the altitude of the UAV is assumed to be constant, the
vertical flight speed of UAV in Slott obeys νv (t) = 0. As a
consequence, the energy consumed by UAV within a complete
flight cycle can be re-expressed as (13).
Ef =

(13)
where the horizontal flight speed of the UAV in Slott is
defined as νh (t) = ∥q(t)−q(t−1)∥

of the UAV, the energy Ec consumed by wireless charging for
the ground IoT device can be expressed as (14):
Ec =

Therefore, the total energy consumed by the UAV in a com-
plete flight cycle can be obtained by combining (13) and (14),
It is re-expressed in (15):
Econs = Ef + Ec
(15)
D. Problem formulation
It is assumed in this paper that the initial energy of UAV
at the beginning of each flight cycle is sufficient to meet all
the energy consumption requirements in a whole flight cycle.
According to the description of the above system model, the
optimization problem of minimizing the energy consumption
of the mobile data and energy base station (UAV) studied in
this paper can be formulated as follows:

The optimization objective of the above problem is to
minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV in a single
flight cycle by jointly optimizing the flight trajectory of the
UAV, the scheduling variables and the wireless charging ratio
of the ground IoT device. The three optimization variables
Q = {q (t) , t ∈ M}, A = {ak (t) , k ∈ K, t ∈ M}, Ξ =
{ξk (t) , k ∈ K, t ∈ M} respectively represent the flight trajec-
tory of the UAV in the horizontal direction, the scheduling set
and the charging proportion set of all ground data and energy
IoT device. K = {1, 2, · · · , K} is a set of numbers of all
ground devices, and M = {1, 2, · · · , M} is a set of numbers
of all time slots during a UAV flight cycle. Equation (16a) and
(16b) are constraints on communication scheduling variables
of the ground IoT device. Equation (16c) is the numerical
range of wireless charging ratio of all the IoT device. Equation
(16d) is the data requirement constraint for uplink transmission
of each IoT device. Equation (16e) is the energy constraint
of each IoT device. Equation (16f) is the limit of the UAV’s
horizontal flight speed (νh,max represents the maximum flight
speed of UAV in the horizontal direction).
III. PROPOSED SOLUTION
It can be seen that the optimization problem (16) is a
mixed-integer non-convex problem. Next, the problem (16) is
decomposed into three subproblems to solve.
A. Optimization of the UAV’s Trajectory
For any given and feasible communication scheduling
A = {ak (t) , k ∈ K, t ∈ M} and charging fractions Ξ =
{ξk (t) , k ∈ K, t ∈ M}, energy consumption of the UAV in
a whole flight period for wireless charging Ec is a constant.
Thus, the subproblem of optimizing the UAV’s trajectory is
formulated as (17).

(17c)
Problem (17) is a non-convex problem due to the non-
convex objective function and constraints. To deal with the
non-convex item in Ef, we introduce a slack variable s (t) ≥ 0
as (18).

(27d)
Note that now both the optimization objective and constraints
are convex with Q and s(t). Then, problem (27) is a convex
optimization problem that can be solved by standard convex
optimization solvers.

the UAV for flight Ef is a constant. Meanwhile, the integer
optimization variable ak (t) needs to be converted to a

(28).

(28d)
Note that now both the optimization objective and con-
straints are convex with A = {ak (t) , k ∈ K, t ∈ M}. Then,
problem (28) is a LP (Linear Programming) problem that can
be solved by standard convex optimization solvers. Due to the
slackness of ak (t), the ak (t) obtained by solving problem
(28) is constant, which has to be reconstructed. Each time slot
needs to be divided into n sub-slots so that the total number
of sub-slots is N = nM, n ≥ 1. Then, the number of sub-
slots allotted to UEk in Slott is Nk (t) = ⌊nak (t)⌋ where
⌊x⌋ denotes the nearest integer of x [16].
C. Optimization of IoT Devices’ Charging Fraction

{q (t) , t ∈ M}

(29c)
It can be seen that both the optimization objective and
constraints are linear. Thus, problem (29) is a LP problem
that can be solved by standard convex optimization solvers.
D. Overall Algorithm
The formulated problem can be addressed with the proposed
algorithm described in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Iterative optimization algorithm for solving problem (16).
First of all, feasible initial values

A0, Ξ0	
are given along
with iteration precision ε and maximum iterations number
rmax. Problem (27) is a convex problem, which can be solved
by standard convex optimization solvers to obtain Qr+1.
With the obtained trajectory and current charging fractions
{Qr+1, Ξr}, the LP problem (28) can also be solved by
standard convex optimization solvers to get the optimized
scheduling variable. At last, the optimized charging fraction
Ξr+1 is obtained by solving problem (29) with {Qr+1, Ar+1}.
The r-th optimization results {Qr+1, Ar+1, Ξr+1} are ob-
tained when the iteration is finished. Then, update the iteration
number and check if it meets the ending conditions. If not, it
should enter the next iteration until the iteration is over. Then,
the optimal UAV’s trajectory Q∗, communication scheduling
A∗ and charging fraction Ξ∗ can be obtained. The compu-
tational complexity of the proposed algorithm is composed
of three parts, i.e., solving problem (27), problem (28) and
problem (29) using convex optimization solver based on the
interior-point method. Given the solution accuracy of ε > 0
and the block coordinate descent complexity of log( 1
ε), the
computational complexity of the proposed algorithm can be
obtained as O((KM)3.5log2( 1
ε)).

Figure 3. UAV’s original trajectory and optimized trajectory.
Figure 3 shows the comparison of the initial trajectory (rect-
angle in the figure) and the optimized trajectory of the UAV
when the flight period of the UAV is set to 40 seconds. From
Figure 3, we can see that six IoT devices are evenly distributed
in the map area as shown in the figure, and each device is
represented by different colors. From Figure 3, it can be seen
that the flight trajectory of the UAV is composed of all dots.
In the flight trajectory of the UAV, the trajectory of the same
color as the device indicates that the corresponding device is
scheduled in currently, while the black part indicates that no
device is scheduled. The following simulation diagrams also
use the same representation. In Figure 3, the rectangular vertex
sandwiched between device 1 and device 2 is the starting
position of the UAV, so this position is also the most obvious
point in the complete optimization trajectory. In general, from
either the initial trajectory or the optimized trajectory, the UAV
begins to provide services for the corresponding device when
getting close and stop when it is far away.

Figure 4. IoT devices’ scheduling.
Figure 4 shows the communication scheduling of all IoT
devices. It can be seen from Figure 4 that at the beginning of
the flight period of the UAV, the first device to be scheduled is
IoT device 1, which is scheduled again at the end of the flight
period. This is because the flight starting position of the UAV
is close to the IoT device 1 and when the UAV flight ends,
it returns to the initial starting position. Therefore, it can be
seen from the figure that except for IoT device 1 is scheduled
twice, other devices have only one chance. It can also be seen
from Figure 4 that at most one IoT device is scheduled at each
time, which is consistent with the requirements in the system
model.

charging fraction varies from 0 to 0.5. When the device is
not scheduled, its charging fraction is actually invalid, and
the simulation results show that the values at this time are
basically fixed at 0.5. It can also be seen from Figure 5 that
IoT device 1 has two valid data of charging fraction, while
other devices have only one. This is the same to the device’s
twice scheduling.

Figure 6. UAV’s energy consumption: (a) energy consumption of flight, (b)
energy consumption of charging.
Figure 6 shows the energy consumption of UAV, which
mainly consists of energy consumption of the flight and the
wireless charging. The two sub-diagrams in Figure 6 show the
energy consumption changes relative to different flight periods.
It can be seen from Figure 6(b) that with the increase of the
flight period of UAV, the flight energy consumption of UAV
also increases a lot. But compared with the fixed charging
fraction, fixed communication scheduling variables and fixed
trajectory, the optimization algorithm proposed in this paper
can reduce the flight energy consumption of UAV effectively. It
can be seen from Figure 6(a) that with the increase of the flight
period, the energy consumption of the wireless charging of the
UAV is increasing, but the optimization algorithm proposed
in this paper can minimize the charging energy consumption
subject to the constraints of data and energy.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper selects the data and energy integrated network
based on UAV for in-depth research. The communication
model of the system and the energy consumption model of
ground IoT devices and the UAV are given. An energy-
efficient resource allocation algorithm based on this scenario
is proposed. The optimization objective is achieved by jointly
optimizing of UAV trajectory, communication scheduling and
wireless charging fractions of the ground IoT devices. At the
end of this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
in minimizing the energy consumption of UAV is verified by
multi-perspective simulation. As for future work, the multi-
UAV scenario will be further studied in order to obtain better
performance.
