Abstract—Satellite and surface observations show that half of 
the extent of perennial sea ice in the Arctic Ocean has been lost 
in the decade of 2000s.  Perennial sea ice is the class of old and 
thick ice important for the stability of the Arctic environment.  
Perennial ice extent set the record low in 2008 and has 
remained low as seen in updated satellite scatterometer data 
and surface drifting buoy measurements in 2011.  The drastic 
decline of Arctic sea ice is far exceeding the worst-case 
projections from climate models of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. The 
important role of the Polar Express phenomenon has been 
identified, indicating dynamic and thermodynamic effects are 
combined to expedite the loss of perennial sea ice. 
Consequently, major impacts include decreases in Arctic 
surface albedo, increases in absorbed insolation, facilitation of 
sea-route opening, and changes in tropospheric chemical 
processes such as bromine explosion, ozone depletion, and 
mercury deposition that impact the biosphere. 
Keywords—Perennial sea ice loss, Polar Express, albedo, 
insolation, Arctic passages, tropospheric chemical changes. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The Arctic sea ice cover consists of two major synoptic 
ice classes: seasonal or first-year sea ice that grows and melts 
in a seasonal cycle, and perennial or multi-year sea ice that 
survives at least a summer melt season and can last for 
multiple years.  At their boundary, these sea ice classes can 
be mixed together to form an area of mixed ice.  Perennial 
sea ice is older, thicker, and more massive than seasonal sea 
ice, and its presence is critical to the stability of the Arctic 
environment.  The total sea ice extent (ST), encompassing 
both perennial and seasonal ice, typically reaches a minimum 
in late summer or early fall.  Setting a record low in 2007, ST 
has been reduced far beyond the worst-case projections from 
climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change Forth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR4) [1-2], which 
are in dire need for improvements in the next IPCC 
assessment.  While the 2007 record minimum of ST in 
summer has been widely reported [3-5], the partition 
between perennial and seasonal ice within the total ice extent 
in springtime is crucial to assess the overall change in sea ice 
and its resulting impacts. Much attention has been on 
increased heating as a thermodynamic cause of sea ice loss 
by melting within the Arctic Ocean [3-5].  In this paper, we 
review the extreme loss of Arctic perennial ice in the decade 
of 2000s with respect to a half-century record, present the 
latest update on the state of Arctic sea ice in 2011, highlight 
the role of the Polar Express phenomenon as an important 
dynamic mechanism for perennial ice loss by ice transport 
out of the Arctic Ocean, and discuss impacts of the 
precipitous loss of Arctic perennial ice.  Observations of 
perennial sea ice are presented in Section II, impacts of 
perennial ice loss are discussed in Section III, and finally the 
conclusions and future perspectives are noted in Section IV. 
II. 
OBSERVATIONS OF ARCTIC PERENNIAL SEA ICE 
A decadal record of backscatter data has been obtained 
globally throughout the lifetime of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) SeaWinds scatterometer, 
a stable and accurate radar aboard the QuikSCAT satellite 
from 1999 to 2009.  QuikSCAT Ku-band backscatter (QS) is 
sensitive to different sea ice classes with a large dynamic 
range of signatures, providing an excellent capability to 
accurately delineate and map Arctic perennial and seasonal 
ice [6-8].  We review the recent state of Arctic sea ice 
including observations from QS data in the 2000s in a multi-
decadal context.    
Perennial sea ice extent (SP) during the transition period 
between winter and spring (March) is an important 
parameter since it represents the amount of older and thicker 
ice that preconditions the summer melt of the Arctic sea ice 
cover and thus the minimum ST.  Furthermore, this transition 
period is the time of polar sunrise that affects chemical 
photolysis processes in the Arctic troposphere depending on 
the relative composition of perennial and seasonal sea ice.  A 
new record has been set in the reduction of March SP in 
2008, while the total sea ice extent has been stable compared 
to the average over the previous nine years as observed in 
QS data.  In March 2008, QS-measured SP was reduced by 
one million km2 compared to that in March 2007.

Beyond the QS satellite data time-series, the perennial 
sea ice pattern change has been deduced by using surface 
observations from buoys and manned ice camps to track sea 
ice movement around the Arctic Ocean beginning in 1955.  
The surface-based SP is obtained from the Drift-Age Model 
(DM) [9]. The combination of the satellite and surface data 
records confirms that the reduction of winter perennial ice 
extent broke the record in 2008 compared to data over the 
last half century.  Another historical fact is that the boundary 
of perennial sea ice already crossed the North Pole (NP) in 
February 2008, leaving the area around the NP occupied by 
seasonal sea ice.  This is the first time, not only from the 
satellite data record but also in the history of sea ice charting 
at the National Ice Center since the 1970’s, that observations 
indicate the seasonal ice migration into the NP area so early 
in winter. 
In the context of a half century change, perennial sea ice 
has been declining precipitously in this decade.  Perennial ice 
extent declines at rate of 0.5 million km2 per decade in the 
1970s-1990s while there is no discernable trend in the 1950s-
1960s.  Abruptly, the rate of decrease has tripled to 1.5 
million km2 per decade in the 2000s.  This crashing rate of SP 
is cross-validated by both satellite sensor and surface buoy 
measurements [10-11].   
In November 2009, QS antenna was stuck in one azimuth 
direction due to a malfunction in the antenna rotary joint 
after more than 10 years in orbit. Nevertheless, the 
scatterometer is still working to collect good global 
backscatter data albeit a much reduced swath and a longer 
time for a full Arctic coverage. New results from QS show 
that SP remained low in March 2010. Thus, the climatic data 
record of Arctic perennial ice extent in the 2000s (2000-
2009) can be continued if QS is kept in continuous operation. 
While QS can still map perennial sea ice well, the rotary 
problem reduces the capability of QS to delineate seasonal 
sea ice.  To supplement this deficiency, we utilized a new 
daily sea ice analysis product called the Multisensor 
Analyzed Sea Ice Extent – Northern Hemisphere (MASIE-
NH) [12], which is an Arctic-wide sea ice extent analysis 
produced by the National Ice Center (NIC) using a multitude 
of data sources.  Different formats of MASIE-NH are 
derived and distributed by the National Snow and Ice Data 
Center.  Since QS can detect perennial sea ice, the remainder 
of the total sea ice extent identified by MASIE-NH consists 
of seasonal as well as a mixed ice class.  Thus, the 
QS/MASIE-NH composite product can map both perennial 
and non-perennial sea ice (seasonal and mixed ice) [13].  
Moreover, DM results are used in conjunction with 
QS/MASIE-NH observations of ice to explain ice dynamics. 
To illustrate the drastic reduction of SP, Figure 1 compares 
the extensive extent of perennial sea ice in 2001 with the 
much smaller perennial ice cover in 2011. 
Although considerable efforts were made to investigate 
thermodynamics effects on sea ice melt in the last several 
decades, the importance of dynamic effects as a significant 
sea ice reduction mechanism was noted in recent years [9, 
10, 14].   In the 2000s, a record low of ST first occurred in 
summer 2005, which was broken again in 2007.  While the 
ice extent had been decreasing throughout the summer 2005 
significantly by melting, an important contribution to this 
minimum extent was from dynamic effects due to wind 
forcing.  Data from the National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research 
(NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis in July-September 2005 reveal a 
dipole anomaly pattern (DAP) of the surface level pressure 
(SLP) with a coexistence of a pronounced atmospheric low 
pressure over the Barents Sea together with a strong high 
pressure over the Canadian Basin.  Clockwise winds around 
the high SLP merged together with counterclockwise winds 
around the low SLP to set up the strong wind anomaly along 
the Transpolar Drift Stream (TDS) that enhanced the ice 
transport out of the Arctic via the Fram Strait [15].   
This phenomenon, called the Polar Express (PE) [10], 
forces the ice extent loss by these processes: (1) compressing 
sea ice from both sides of the TDS, (2) pushing sea ice from 
the Russian Arctic toward Greenland while accelerating the 
TDS, (3) transporting of sea ice by the TDS out of the Arctic, 
and (4) melting of the exported sea ice in the Greenland Sea 
by warm Atlantic waters originated from the south [10, 15].  
It was not until 2007 that the PE occurred again. The 2007 
PE was strong, and together with feedback effects on the 
lighter sea ice cover due to the loss of massive perennial ice 
in 2005, leading to another record low of ST after the 2007 
summer melt, and subsequently contributing to the record 
low of SP in 2008. 
III. 
IMPACTS OF PERENNIAL ICE LOSS 
The crash of perennial sea ice extent in the 2000s has 
profound impacts on the Arctic environment.  Here, we 
review several results including changes in surface albedo, 
absorbed radiation, Arctic sea routes, and troposheric 
chemical processes. 
The different classes of sea ice partition solar energy 
differently, with the perennial ice having a larger albedo and 
thereby transmitting less solar radiation to the ocean [16]. 
The shift in the Arctic Ocean from perennial to thinner 
seasonal ice thus suggests a coincident decrease in surface 
albedo and more solar energy absorbed in the ice ocean 
system during summer melt [16-17].  To investigate changes 
in albedo and insolation, a synthetic approach was used to 
combine 
satellite-derived ice concentrations, incident 
irradiances determined from reanalysis products, and field 
observations of ocean albedo over the Arctic Ocean and the 
adjacent seas.  Results show an increase in the solar energy 
deposited in the upper ocean over the past few decades in 
89% of the studied region spanning across Chukchi Sea, 
Beaufort Sea, and East Siberian Sea, and the largest anomaly 
of solar heat input occurred in the 2000s [18].  As the Arctic 
becomes more dominated by seasonal sea ice with a lower 
overall albedo and lower ice mass, melting will become 
much more effective in causing sea ice loss. 
Less perennial sea ice and more seasonal ice, which is 
thinner and requires less energy to melt, may facilitate the 
summer opening of Arctic sea routes such as the Northwest 
Passage (NWP) along the North American side or the 
Northern Sea Route (NSR) along the Siberian side.  In winter 
2007 and 2008, SP loss was driven by winds that compressed 
the ice and transported it out of Fram Strait (east of

Greenland) and Nares Strait (west of Greenland) as observed 
by QS [19]. By March 2008, QS sea ice maps revealed that 
seasonal ice occupied the NSR, a vast region from Kara Sea 
and Laptev Sea to the North Pole, and most of two branches 
of the NWP north and south of Victoria Island [19].  In a 
news release in October 2008 [20], the International Ice 
Charting Working Group (IICWG) issued the statement “For 
the first time in recorded history, national ice charts showed 
that both the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route 
were simultaneously open water for a brief period in 
September 2008” and also warned that “At lower 
concentrations, hazardous ice floes and icebergs are more 
mobile and less easily detected by mariners. Sustained 
monitoring with high resolution satellite sensors combined 
with surface and aerial reports is essential for safe 
navigation.”  In 2009, perennial ice remained low [21], and 
the IICWG reported a record number of pleasure craft 
transited the NWP although ice conditions were more 
difficult for shipping than in the three previous years [22].  In 
January 2011, little perennial ice was seen in the NWP and 
seasonal ice dominated the NSR (right panel in Figure 1). 
As perennial sea ice diminished, the Arctic Ocean 
becomes dominated by seasonal ice, consisting of salty ice 
together with more leads, polynyas, and frost flowers.  The 
high salinity in these ice conditions affects the release of 
bromine monoxide (BrO), a catalyst for depletions of ozone 
(O3) [23] and gaseous element mercury (GEM) [24].  These 
changes may have significant implications on chemical 
fluxes in the Arctic biosphere [25-26], where ozone and 
mercury are toxic to people and wildlife.  During polar 
sunrise, oxidation from bromide activates photochemically 
reactive forms, which are photo-disassociated into Br atoms 
that destroy O3 and oxidize GEM.  The Br atoms are 
regenerated to repeat this autocatalytic process. Subsequent 
reactions further multiply available bromine, which is called 
“bromine explosion” [27].  In 2007, the acceleration of the 
Transpolar Drift (TD), due to the Polar Express phenomenon 
excessively transported sea ice toward the Atlantic sector and 
finally out of the Arctic across Fram Strait. The 2007 TD 
acceleration was actually verified by a vessel drift during the 
TARA 
expedition 
[28]. 
Consequently, 
from 
QS 
observations, a polynya as large as the country of Austria 
was created with an extensive frost flower cover near the 
Taymyr Peninsula, and ozone depletion events were 
observed far down wind [29].  While SP was low during the 
2008 spring transition, bromine enhancement was observed 
across the Beaufort Sea to the Amundsen Gulf [30].  In 
March-May of 2009 and 2010 with low SP, strong bromine 
explosion events were detected by satellite sensors [31]. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 
As observed from decadal satellite and surface data 
across the Arctic, half of the perennial sea ice extent was lost 
in the decade of 2000s when the ice-loss rate was the most 
precipitous in the last half century.  The role of dynamic 
mechanisms, such as the PE, has been identified as an 
important factor in causing the drastic sea ice loss, which is 
accelerated 
by 
the 
combination 
of 
dynamic 
and 
thermodynamic effects. Without appropriately accounting 
for these effects, many projections from IPCC-AR4 climate 
models underestimated the Arctic sea ice loss by far.  
Recently, Zhang et al. [32] conducted a model study to show 
that preconditioning, anomalous wind forcing, and ice-
albedo feedback are the main contributors responsible for sea 
ice loss in 2007, and that the Arctic has become vulnerable to 
the anomalous atmospheric forcing.  Later, Wang et al. [33]

examined the DAP and used a coupled ice-ocean model to 
explain the low extents of sea ice including the records in 
2005 and in 2007.  What causes the change between the 
typical Arctic Oscillation pattern and the anomalous DAP, 
how such change can be related to global temperature 
change, and whether the impacts can be amplified or 
suppressed by positive or negative feedbacks remain to be 
investigated in future research. 
Given the 2000s crash of perennial sea ice, it is critical to 
closely monitor the sea ice change with both surface and 
satellite measurements. For surface measurements, the 
International Arctic Buoy Programme has been enhanced 
with a larger number of buoys during the International Polar 
Years 2007-2008.  The need for the buoy program to sustain 
ocean observations has been articulated [34].  Regarding 
satellite scatterometer observations, QS unfortunately 
suffered from the rotary malfunction that has reduced its 
capability for sea ice mapping.  Sea ice maps derived from 
the limited QS data after the rotary incident still need to be 
improved with better calibration and geolocation efforts.  
Launched in September 2009, the Indian Oceansat-2 satellite 
[35], carrying a sensor similar to QS, is currently operating 
and collecting global Ku-band backscatter data. Access to 
fully calibrated and validated data will be useful.  Planned 
for a launch later in 2011, the Chinese Haiyan-2 satellite [36] 
will also have a Ku-band scatterometer.  The U.S. National 
Research 
Council Decadal 
Survey recommends 
the 
development of another advanced satellite scatterometer 
[37]. All of these international satellite missions will 
potentially contribute to sea ice monitoring in the long term.  
While important advances have been made for 
understanding sea ice changes and environmental impacts, 
many science questions as well as practically issues still need 
to be addressed.  Sea ice-albedo feedback processes are 
complex, 
which 
demands 
interdisciplinary 
research 
involving all components including air, ice, ocean, and land 
to determine various inter-related positive and negative 
mechanisms in the overall feedback process of the Earth 
system.  Either from satellite and surface observations or 
from model estimates, diverse and extensive temporal and 
spatial scales should be considered since results for a given 
area or a time period will likely lead to inconclusive or even 
erroneous projections from a series of non-physical 
numerical correlations, interpolations, and extrapolations.  In 
any case, reducing potential causes, which would further 
decrease the albedo such as dust or black carbon deposition 
in the Arctic, may help to mitigate albedo feedback effects. 
With the prospect of a more navigable Arctic, new issues 
have emerged and necessitated the need for high-resolution 
operational satellite sensors to monitor ice in polar sea 
routes, 
more 
accurate 
and 
complete 
bathymetry 
measurements, and consensus on international agreements 
such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
Sea or the Arctic Council Memorandum on Search and 
Rescue.   New bathymetry data are critical to avoid or reduce 
the threat of navigation hazards that may lead to 
environmental disasters such as oil spills.  Although much 
attention has been paid to Arctic sea-route shortcuts and 
resource exploitation, it is important to consider the impact 
to the Arctic biosphere by changes in chemical processes, 
transport, and distribution that may adversely affect the well 
being of people and wildlife.  There is a general 
understanding that a saltier snow and ice cover may 
exacerbate bromine explosions, ozone depletions, and 
mercury depositions.  Reducing mercury emission into the 
atmosphere, under the auspices of the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) [38], may diminish the 
mercury source and thus decrease the mercury deposition in 
the Arctic environment. Nevertheless, exact contributions 
from different components such as seasonal ice, snow on sea 
ice, frost flowers in leads and polynyas, high salinity 
expulsion on ice surface, aerosols in the atmosphere, and 
chemical composition and exchange in the troposphere and 
stratosphere are not well understood.  In this respect, more 
intensive interdisciplinary research is underway [31].
