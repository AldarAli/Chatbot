Abstract—Spectrum resource sharing strategies for uncoor-
dinated networks are investigated. The average capacity of 2-
pair device-to-device (D2D) communication systems is derived,
assuming a ﬂat response of the frequency spectrum. Three
different frequency allocation strategies are considered: (i) sep-
arate spectral allocation; (ii) full spectral allocation; and (iii)
overlapped spectral allocation, considering deterministic and
random locations of the communication devices. The analytical
results, supported by simulations, show that at low to moderate
received SNR the throughput assigned to each communication
device can be enhanced by overlapping the frequency spectrum
allocations.
Index Terms—Uncoordinated networks, frequency allocation
strategies, D2D communication.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, device-to-device (D2D) communication has at-
tracted more attention for its promising results in enhanc-
ing the system capacity [1]. With the increasing demand
in establishing home networks, which connect a variety of
communication devices including mobile phones, laptops, or
other electronic appliances, D2D communication becomes
a common paradigm for establishing these connections [2].
D2D communication schemes require low power consumption,
cost, and human intervention [3]. Many studies have been
performed to investigate the capacity of speciﬁc uncoordinated
networks, i.e., cellular networks [4]. However, the results of
these investigations cannot be generalized to other types of
communication systems. Therefore, in this paper, we study the
capacity of uncoordinated networks using physical parameters
independent of the system speciﬁcations, such as the locations
of communication devices, the number of devices which can
co-exist in a certain region, and the environment.
We focus our study on 2-pair D2D communication systems
considering three different spectral allocation strategies: sepa-
rated, whole and overlapped spectral allocations. For tractabil-
ity, we consider channels with a ﬂat frequency response.
First, in Section II, we present the sum capacity of 2-pair
D2D systems with deterministic locations. Then, in Section
III, we derive the average sum capacity considering random
locations of the communication devices. The results are intro-
duced in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.
II. SUM CAPACITY OF 2-PAIR D2D SYSTEMS WITH
DETERMINISTIC LOCATIONS
In this section, we present the sum capacity of a circular
cell in which two pairs of transmitters, (i.e., Tx1 and Tx2) and
receivers (i.e., Rx1 and Rx2) are located in ﬁxed positions
inside the cell as shown in Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure, the solid
lines represent the desired signals from the transmitters to
the desired destinations (i.e., Tx1-Rx1 and Tx2-Rx2), while
interfering signals (i.e., Tx1-Rx2 and Tx2-Rx1) are denoted
by dotted lines.

For simplicity, the channels of the desired and interfering
communication links are modeled using the single-slope path
loss, where the received power at a distance r from the
transmitter is given by
Pr(r) ∝ Ptr−α
(1)
where Pt is the transmit power spectral density, and α is the
path loss exponent. We assume that Pt is the same for all links,
and α = 4. To simplify our analysis, we neglect the coefﬁcient
of proportionality and consider the effective transmit power
density Pt such that (1) contains an equality.
Assuming that the frequency spectrum under investigation
has a ﬂat response over different frequencies, we use an

overlapped spectral allocation strategy, where the bandwidth
assigned to each transmitter is extended with a speciﬁc ratio
over the neighboring frequency bands as shown in Fig. 2. The
parameters x1 and x2 represent the spectral overlapping ratios
of Tx1 on Tx2 and Tx2 on Tx1, respectively.
In this case, the average capacity of the 2-pair D2D com-
munication systems can be deﬁned by
CT = CF 1 + CF 2 + CO1 + CO2
(2)
where CF 1 and CF 2 are the capacity of Tx1 and Tx2 in
the region of the spectrum which is free of interference,
respectively. The components CO1 and CO2 are the capacity
of Tx1 and Tx2 in the overlapped spectral region between the
two transmitters, respectively. The expressions corresponding
to these capacities are

where B is the total frequency bandwidth, and N is the
noise power spectral density. The distance {rij}, i, j ∈ {1, 2},
represents the length of the communication link between Txi
and Rxj. Also, {rij} takes values between rm and 2R, where
rm is the minimum distance between two communication
devices inside the cell, and R is the cell radius.
III. SUM CAPACITY OF 2-PAIR D2D SYSTEMS WITH
RANDOM LOCATIONS
Here, we assume that Tx1, Tx2, Rx1 and Rx2 are located
in random positions inside the cell. In this case, r11, r21, r12,
and r22 become variable parameters, which have independent
identical distributions deﬁned as follows. Let r represent the
Euclidian distance between two points randomly located in a
circle of radius R. Then, the probability distribution function
of r is given by [5]

distribution is investigated by Moltchanov in [5].
Using the closed-form expression of f(r) in (7), we can
estimate the average sum capacity of 2-pair D2D communica-
tions over a ﬂat frequency response as follows
¯CT = ¯CF 1 + ¯CO1 + ¯CO2 + ¯CF 2

where
¯CF 1 =

(12)
In (9) and (10), the closed-form expression of ¯CF 1 and ¯CF 2
can be obtained by deriving the average capacity of 1-pair
D2D communication systems over bandwidths (1−x2) B
2 and
(1 − x1) B
2 , respectively. The closed-form expressions of ¯CO1
and ¯CO2 can be obtained by deriving the average capacity of
1-pair D2D communication systems with one interferer over a
bandwidth (x1 + x2) B
2 . In the following subsections, we will
show how the average capacity of the aforementioned cases
can be estimated.
A. Average capacity of 1-pair D2D communications with no
interference
This case is represented by (9) or (10), where CF 1 is a
function only of r11, or CF 2 is a function only of r22. First,
consider the derivation of ¯CF 1. Using (7), the average capacity
of 1-pair D2D communication systems over a frequency
bandwidth, ˜B = (1 − x2) B
2 , is given by
¯CF 1 = ˜B

the integrations in (14) and (15) are not tractable; therefore,
we use the series expansions of the following mathematical
functions to reduce the complexity of these integrations [6].
For |γr| ≤ 1, the logarithmic function log2 (1 + γr) can be
expressed as
log2 (1 + γr) =

For |γr| ≤ 1, we substitute for log2 (1 + γr) using the
ﬁrst three terms of the series expansion in (16a) since the
values of the remaining terms are small and can be neglected.
Accordingly, ¯c1 can be approximated using
¯c1 ≈

ln(2)
(
¯ca1 − ¯ca2

When |γr| > 1, we also include up to the third-order term,
i.e., the ﬁrst four terms of the series expansion in (16b), and
consequently ¯c1 can be given by
¯c1 ≈

ln(2)
(
¯cb1 + ¯cb2 − ¯cb3

The closed-form expression of the integrations in (19)-(21),
(23)-(26) and (28)-(30) can be obtained from handbooks
of integrations; however, due to the space limitation of the
paper, we refer the reader to [6]. Similarly, we use the same
mathematical derivations to get ¯CF 2 over bandwidth (1−x1) B
2
from (10).
B. Average capacity of one-pair D2D communications with
one interferer
Now, we assume that there is an interfering signal to
the desired communication link from a randomly located
communication device. The average capacity of this case is
presented in (11) and (12). In the following, we ﬁrst solve the
double integration in (11), and then we use the same procedure
to evaluate the integrations in (12). Assuming that the locations
of Tx1 and Tx2 inside the cell are statistically independent,
i.e., f(r11, r21) = f(r11)f(r22), (11) is reduced to
¯CO1 = ˜B1
∫ 2R

¯Φ(r11)f(r11)dr11

The integration in (40) is obtained using [6]. Substituting
(36) and (39) in (32), we derive the closed-form expression
of ¯Φ(r11), and subsequently, we can perform the second
integration in (31) with respect to r11. However, due to the
high complexity of the resultant integrations, we obtain the
ﬁnal estimate of ¯CO1 using numerical integration techniques,
speciﬁcally, we used the adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature
method [7].
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we examine the accuracy of the derived
expression of the average sum capacity in (8) of 2-pair D2D
systems considering different spectral allocation strategies. For
illustrative purposes, we perform our simulations using design
parameters similar to those of GSM systems: carrier frequency
fc = 2GHz, bandwidth B = 200kHz and cell with radius
R = 5km. The value of rm, which is the minimum distance
between two devices inside the cell to initiate transmission, is
taken as 1% of the cell diameter, i.e., rm = 0.02R. In other
words, the two devises are not allowed to communicate with
each other when r < rm. As noted previously, the channel
between different communication devices is modeled using the
single-slope path loss with α = 4. In our results, we present
the average capacity versus the received SNR at the median
distance re between Txi and Rxi, which is denoted as γm.
The value of re can be estimated from (7) or can be detected
from Fig. 3. With this value of γm, the transmit power density,

In the following results, the average sum capacity ¯CT is es-
timated by averaging (2) over 105 realizations of {rij}, i, j ∈

The average capacity of 1-pair D2D systems is shown in
Fig. 4 for two cases: (i) no interferer (0-Interferer); and (ii) 1-
Interferer. The analytical results, supported by the simulations,
show that the average capacity of 1-pair systems can be en-
hanced by increasing Pt; however, this enhancement becomes
limited when an interferer is present. The ﬁgure also shows
the accuracy of the analytical derivation of the scenario of
0-Interferer. Even for the 1-Interferer case, the error in the
derivations at high values of γm is less than 23%, which can
be reduced by adding more terms from the series expansions
in (17) and (35), but this requires additional mathematical
computations.

The average sum capacity, i.e., ¯CT , of different frequency
allocation strategies are shown in Fig. 5. The values of the
overlapping ratios, i.e., x1 and x2, vary from 0 to 1. The
case of x1 = x2 = 0 represents the separated spectral
allocation, while the values x1 = x2 = 1 refer to the
fully overlapped spectral allocation. The results show that
at low to moderate values of γm, ¯CT can be enhanced by
overlapping the frequency bands assigned to each pair of
communication devices, which means that a fully-overlapped
spectral allocation can be the preferred strategy at low received
SNR values. At high values of γm, the interference power
increases and thus limits the capacity enhancement provided
by the overlapped spectral allocation.
V. CONCLUSION
We derived the average capacity of 1-pair and 2-pair D2D
communication systems assuming deterministic and random
locations of the transmitting and receiving devices. We found
