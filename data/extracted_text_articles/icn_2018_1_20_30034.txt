Abstract‚ÄîThe Internet of Things (IoT) and emerging wireless 
sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely adopted in various 
fields and are attracting attention. In addition, low power wide 
area (LPWA) technologies have shown great advances and are 
applicable to IoT and WSN solutions. LPWA-based WSNs are 
effective when wireless data transmissions are sent at long 
periodic time intervals. However, vast amounts of forwarding 
data cannot be handled due to collision and congestion. To 
overcome this technical issue, in this paper, we propose a novel 
cooperative (hybrid) reception scheme using mobile aerial base 
stations (MBSs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). 
Moreover, we fundamentally demonstrate that the proposed 
mechanism can improve frame-reception probability based on 
exhaustive computer simulation. As a result, the proposed 
scheme achieves up to 8.32-times better performance than a 
comparable scheme without using MBSs.

 INTRODUCTION 
As one of the fastest growing technologies, the Internet of 
Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize the way we live and 
work, and advanced wireless sensor network (WSN) systems 
have become technically easy to build in the past several years. 
With this background, there is great potential to meet the huge 
demands for IoT systems. However, major challenges remain, 
such as the tradeoff between low energy consumption and 
extensive wireless area coverage. Notably, typical sensor node 
(SN) devices have become tiny and cheap, including 
resource-constrained processing modules and small batteries 
with a limited energy budget [1]. 
To construct a long-lived WSN system, most studies adopt 
such measures as cooperative communication techniques, 
network coding schemes, clustering mechanisms, and so on. 
On the other hand, other solutions require the emergence of a 
new-type of architecture. Low power wide area (LPWA) 
network [2][3] techniques represent a novel wireless network 
paradigm that complements traditional cellular and short-
range wireless communications in addressing the diverse 
requirements of IoT applications. These techniques include, 
for example, long-range wide area network (LoRa WAN) [4], 
Sigfox [5], and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) [6]. 
A variety of LPWA technologies can provide the means to 
sense and collect environmental data anywhere and anytime: 
several kilometers-order coverage areas, narrowband channel 
occupancy, periodical transmission, and the unsophisticated 
physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) protocols. 
In fact, at the PHY layer, a low-bit-rate and noise-robust 
modulation scheme, such as the binary phase shift keying 
(BPSK) method and the (Gaussian) frequency shift keying 
((G)FSK) method, is typically used. In addition, LPWA 
systems commonly use the radio frequency of sub-GHz bands, 
such as 915 MHz for the USA, 868 MHz for the EU, and 
920 MHz for Japan. Furthermore, at the MAC layer, a pure-
ALOHA procedure is commonly adopted, where data are sent 
if a node has data to send, collisions occur when any new data 
are released while any node is transmitting, and both of these 
data are lost. To investigate the effectiveness of LPWA 
systems, Adelantado et al. [7] surveyed the capabilities and 
limitations of LoRa WAN systems. Bor et al. [8] 
experimentally demonstrated that the current LPWA scheme 
could not provide sufficient performance for typical smart city 
deployment, that is, 120 nodes per 0.038 km2. At the same 
time, conventional LPWA-based WSN systems can operate 
effectively even if the PHY and MAC protocols are 
constructed by a simple procedure that only requires data 
transmitted at a sufficiently long-interval for uploading 
requests. However, in the near-future, we cannot expect vast 
amounts of forwarding data to be handled based on a 
traditional scheme due to collision and congestion. 
In this paper, as a way to overcome this technical issue, we 
propose a novel cooperative (hybrid) reception scheme by 
using mobile aerial base stations (MBSs) mounted on 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as drones and small 
planes [9][10]. The goal of this paper is to present a 
fundamental analysis technique for improving the probability 
of frame reception. Its performance for UAV-mounted MBSs 
in LPWA-based WSNs is still unknown. Nevertheless, our 
study shows significant results from our preliminary analysis. 
Regarding related studies, Li and Cai [11] proposed an 
MBS-based offloading mechanism for solving the problem of 
increased traffic volume in heterogeneous cellular networks. 
Sharma et al. [12] investigated the same concept, but they 
proposed a user-driven MBS deployment scheme. For the 
MBS placement‚Äôs and UAV trajectory‚Äôs decision formula, 
Lyu et al. [13] proposed a placement algorithm to minimize 
the number of MBSs needed to provide wireless coverage. 
Furthermore, Mozaffari et al. [14] and Alzenad [15] expanded 
the technique of Lyu et al. [13] for the 3D location scenario. 
On the other hand, another study of Mozaffari et al. [16] 
investigated a topic similar to that taken up in this paper. In 
that work, they did not take into account the MAC protocol 
design, and their simulation was conducted under a traditional

WSN usage, with the radio frequency set to the 2-GHz 
industry science medical (ISM) band and 500 SNs distributed 
over a 1 km2 area. ‚Äî In the proposed scheme, the radio 
frequency is set to 920 MHz (i.e., a sub-GHz band) and up to 
500,000 SNs are distributed. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II describes the proposed scheme. Section III provides 
computer simulation result. Finally, in Section IV, we 
summarize our findings and conclude the paper. 
II. 
PROPOSED SCHEME 
In the proposed scheme (Figure 1), the SNs periodically 
transmit the sensing data, which their neighbor base stations 
(BSs) receive and forward to the cloud servers. In addition, 
the UAV flies at the edge of the cell coverage area, which 
offers a poor radio-propagation environment, as well as the 
gap area outside the BSs‚Äô coverage range and the hotspot area 
where the sensing data are generated at a greater rate than in 
the surrounding area. We assume that BSs, MBSs, and cloud 
servers are ideally connected with each other through mobile 
cellular networks, and we focus on the wireless links between 
SNs and BSs and between SNs and MBSs. Moreover, the BSs 
and MBSs are provided with sufficient power supply, while 
the SNs have a strictly limited battery capacity, since the 
battery exchange cost is non-remunerative and relatively 
expensive due to use of cheap hardware devices. Therefore, 
ensuring sophisticated and intelligent transmission control in 
the SN device is not realistic. In other words, the proposed 
concept using UAV-mounted MBSs that cooperatively 
operate with legacy BSs at the receiver side might be a 
reasonable idea. 
In the rest of this section, we explain how to improve the 
frame-reception probability by using the proposed mechanism. 
As shown in Figure 2 (a), we assume that three SN devices (ùî∏, 
ùîπ, and ‚ÑÇ) are deployed within the BS‚Äôs coverage cell, where 
ùî∏ and ùîπ are located at the same distance from the BS while ‚ÑÇ 
is located in the cell-edge area at a farther distance, and that 
the UAV aviates in the border region between adjacent cells. 
In this case, as shown in Figure 2 (b), we assume three MAC 
procedure scenarios: typical transmission, collision occurring 
in the hotspot, and long-distance data transmission in the cell-
edge region. We found that the proposed scheme can work 
effectively in the latter two scenarios. 
For the typical transmission and collision occurring in the 
hotspot scenario, the conventional LPWA-based WSN system 
works without causing collisions due to its sparse channel 
allocation requests. According to the increased SN, in 
Figure 2 (b), ùîπ tries to send its frame while ùî∏ transmits its 
own frame; consequently, both ùî∏‚Äôs frame and ùîπ‚Äôs frame are 
lost due to the pure-ALOHA feature. In this situation, their 
frames should be retransmitted after random back-off time, 
which might contribute to additional frame collisions. In the 
proposed scheme, if the MBS‚Äôs channel were by chance not 
busy and ùîπ‚Äôs frame could be moved from the BS to the MBS, 
both frames might be successfully transferred. Here, among ùî∏, 
ùîπ, BSs, and MBSs, the wireless links are selected in the shared 
radio frequency band. On the other hand, ùîπ sends its frame 
via an exclusive radio channel different from that for ùî∏‚Äôs 
frame. Hence, we can assume that ùî∏  and ùîπ  can be 
communicated with BSs and MBSs without interference. 
For long-distance data transmission in the cell-edge 
scenario, ‚ÑÇ‚Äôs frame request does not fatally affect ùî∏‚Äôs frame 
transmission. In other words, ‚ÑÇ‚Äôs frame is inevitably lost 
regardless of the scenario. In the proposed scheme, since 
MBSs can collect the cell-edge node‚Äôs frame, such as ‚ÑÇ‚Äôs 
frame, the overall frame-reception probability can be 
improved. 
The proposed scheme does not check the availability of 
the MBS channel in order to avoid system complexity for the 
SN device; instead, we consider compatibility with the 
traditional LPWA‚Äôs MAC protocol like the pure-ALOHA 
procedure. On the other hand, to further improve throughput, 
we should introduce an intelligent frequency-sharing 
mechanism for use among SNs, BSs, and MBSs: This remains 
our important future work. 
III. 
COMPUTER SIMULATION 
In this section, we demonstrate the fundamental 
performance of our proposed mechanism, i.e., the ability to 
improve frame-reception probability, using an exhaustively 
prepared computer simulator implemented in C++ language.

A. Simulation model 
In the computer simulation model (Figure 3), BSs are 
deployed in the lattice (grid) pattern, MBSs (on UAVs) aviate 
between BSs, and SNs are randomly scattered over the surface 
of the observation area. We assume that the UAVs can aviate 
at all times by changing to alternate aircraft along the given 
fixed trajectory (red line in Figure 3). The detailed simulation 
parameters are summarized in Table I. Individual SNs 
generate the sensing data with equal frequency, and the 
parameter settings of the MAC layer are set based on the 
Japanese LoRa WAN specifications [17]. For frame 
reachability, we calculate the received signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) based on the manner described in Section III.B, and we 
compare the obtained SNR with the required SNR based on 
the manner given in Section III.C. 
B. Radio propagation model 
In our computer simulation, we calculated the receiver 
side‚Äôs signal strength based on the distance between the 
transmitter side and the receiver side. According to the typical 
link budget formula [18], the received signal strength in 
decibel can be calculated as 
 
ùëÉRX = ùëÉTX ‚àí ùêøTX + ùê∫TX ‚àí ùêøP(ùëë) + ùê∫RX ‚àí ùêøRX , 
(1) 
 
where, at the transmitter and receiver sides, respectively, ùëÉTX 
and ùëÉRX denote electrical radio powers, ùêøTX and ùêøRX denote 
electrical power loss in the physical circuit and impedance 
mismatching, and ùê∫TX and ùê∫RX denote antenna gains. 
In (1), ùêøP(ùëë) denotes radio propagation loss, and it can 
generally be represented as 
 
ùêøùëÉ(ùëë) = ùõº + 10 ‚ãÖ ùõΩ ‚ãÖ log10(ùëë) + ùíÆ , 
(2) 
 
where ùëë denotes the distance between terminals, ùíÆ denotes 
shadowing variation, and both ùõº  and ùõΩ  are given by 
individual radio propagation models. In this paper, we select 
the model of Erceg et al. [19] for the link between SNs and 
BSs and the model of Amorim et al. [20] for the link between 
SNs and MBSs. These models were formulated based on 
experimental measurements, and we separately used them by 
considering the difference between line-of-sight (LOS) 
propagation (for SNs-MBSs) and non-LOS (NLOS) 
propagation (for SNs-BSs). 
Consequently, the parameters of ùõº, ùõΩ, and ùíÆ in (2) can be 
characterized as follows: 
Erceg et al.‚Äôs model: ùíÆ is a random variable with normal 
distribution of ùí©(ùúáùíÆ, ùúéùíÆ
2), and both ùõº and ùõΩ can be calculated 
as 
 
{ 
ùõº = 20 log10(4ùúãùëë0/ùúÜ) , 
(3) 
ùõΩ = (ùëé ‚àí ùëè‚ÑéBS + ùëê/‚ÑéBS) + ùúÄ ‚ãÖ ùëß , 
 
where ‚ÑéBS denotes the antenna height of BS, ùúÜ denotes the 
carrier radio wavelength, and ùëé, ùëè, ùëê, ùëë, and ùúÄ denote the 
constant 
values 
depending 
on 
the 
surrounding 
environment [19]. In addition, ùëß is a random variable with a 
normal distribution of ùí©(0, 1). 
Amorim‚Äôs model: ùíÆ is a random variable with normal 
distribution of ùí©(0, ùúéùë†
2), and both ùõº and ùõΩ are given by ùõº = 
35.3 and ùõΩ = 2.0, depending on the UAV altitude [20].

C. Required SNR calculation 
In this paper, we consider the BPSK method and Binary 
FSK method as the modulation scheme. In general, the bit 
error probability, ùëùb, under the Rayleigh fading environment 
can be theoretically calculated [18] as follows: 
 
{ 
ùëùb = [ 1 ‚àí ‚àöùõæ/(1 + ùõæ)  ] 2
‚ÅÑ  
(BPSK) , 
(4) 
ùëùb = [1 ‚àí ‚àöùõæ/(2 + ùõæ ) ] 2
‚ÅÑ  
(Binary FSK) , 
 
where ùõæ denotes SNR, and the relationship between ùõæ and 
ùëÉRX is given by 
 
ùõæ = ùëÉRX/ùúÖùúèo , 
(5) 
 
where ùúÖ (= 4.0 √ó 10-21 W/Hz) denotes Boltzmann‚Äôs constant 
value and ùúèo  (K) denotes the system device‚Äôs absolute 
temperature. Therefore, by letting ‚Ñì (bit) denote frame length, 
we can calculate the frame error probability, ùëùe, using (4) as 
 
ùëùe = 1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí ùëùb)‚Ñì . 
(6) 
 
Figures 4 and 5 show the calculation results for the frame 
length, ‚Ñì, versus the required SNR when the ùëùe values are 
0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 5% for the BPSK and Binary FSK 
methods, respectively, based on the above procedure. 
D. Numerical result 
When the frame error probability is 0.5% and ‚Ñì = 50 bytes 
(i.e., the maximum LoRa frame length transmitted in the 
airtime allowed by Japanese regulations [17]), based on 
Figures 4 and 5, we can obtain the required received power as 
-126 dBm and -129 dBm for the BPSK and Binary FSK 
methods, respectively. In (5), the required ùëÉRX  can be 
obtained as 43 dBm and 46 dBm based on Figures 4 and 5, 
and in the general condition, ùúÖùúèo is given as -172 dBm. 
Figure 6 shows the number of SNs (and number of SNs 
per hectare) versus frame-reception probability, ùëùr, which is 
calculated as 
 
ùëùr = ùëÅr / ùëÅall , 
(7) 
 
where ùëÅr and ùëÅall denote the number of successfully received 
frames and the number of all generated frames, respectively. 
Consequently, in the comparable scheme without using MBSs, 
the frame-reception probability was dramatically degraded. 
This is because frame collisions and retransmissions 
significantly increased as they exceeded the multiple access 
capability of the pure-ALOHA method. We believe this 
phenomenon led to the same conclusion reached in 
Adelantado et al. [7] and C. Bor et al. [8].  
On the other hand, the proposed scheme could reduce the 
worse degradation in the frame-reception probability curve, 
even if the SNs increased. When the required frame-reception 
probabilities were 0.9, 0.8, and 0.5, the proposed scheme with 
MBSs could increase the number of SNs (and per hecare) by 
5.77, 7.00, and 15.8 times, respectively, compared to the 
scheme without MBSs, while still keeping the same farme 
reception rate in the end. Finally, the proposed scheme 
achieved up to 8.32 times better performance in frame-
reception probability than the comparable scheme.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed a novel cooperative (hybrid) 
reception scheme using UAV-mounted mobile aerial base 
stations for LPWA-based WSNs. Computer simulation 
demonstrated that the proposed scheme achieved up to 8.32 
times better performance than a comparable scheme without 
using MBSs in terms of the frame-reception probability. In 
future work, we should consider such issues as an extended 
receiver-side cooperation mechanism, MBS placement and 
algorithms for detetmining the UAV‚Äôs flight path and aircraft 
selection.
