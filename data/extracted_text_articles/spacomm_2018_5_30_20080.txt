Abstract—This paper presents a cylindrical waveguide slot
omnidirectional antenna. The antenna has a certain number of
vertical slots cut in the surface of the cylindrical waveguide to
form a slot array. The vertical slots are cut at equal length. The
antenna has omnidirectional radiation characteristics in the E-
plane, and “8” radiation characteristics approximately in H-
plane. The test results show that the antenna has broadband
characteristics and the amplitude changes in the E-plane under
ripple ±1 dB in S-band. The antenna has been successfully
applied to products and can be used as a communication and
radar antenna, among other uses.
Keywords- cylindrical waveguide slot array; omnidirec-
tional; broadband; antenna.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The forms of the slot antenna are varied [1]. Due to the
characteristics of the waveguide field distribution, the
position of a single slot antenna is more flexible than the
dipole antenna. Using a simple excitation method, then the
slot can generate radiation [2].
Usually, in order to enhance the direction of the slot
antenna, a number of slots of equal size are cut in the
cylindrical waveguide sidewall by following a certain rule
[3]. This becomes a cylindrical waveguide slot array antenna.
The cylindrical waveguide slot array antenna has a good
mechanical
strength,
compact
structure,
high
radiation
efficiency, corrosion resistance, is easy to produce and has a
series of other advantages, as indicated in [4]. It is widely
used in the radar, microwave communications and television
broadcasting
systems.
The
cylindrical
waveguide
slot
antenna can be widely implemented in the L, S, C, X, and
other bands of horizontal polarized antenna.
In this paper, the cylindrical waveguide slot antenna is
made into S band omnidirectional antenna. The test results
show the antenna has an omnidirectional radiation charac-
teristic, its amplitude changes under ripple ±1 dB in the E-
plane, and has “8” radiation characteristic approximately in
H-plane. It also had broadband characteristics. The design
has been successfully applied to the radar and communi-
cation antennas.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,
we describe how to design and simulate the antenna. In
Section 3, we present the test results. We conclude the paper
in Section 4.
II.
DESIGN AND SIMULATION
The slot array antenna can be divided into resonant array
(standing wave array) and non-resonant array (traveling
wave array) [2]. In the case of the standing wave of the
cylindrical waveguide slot array antenna, six to seven
longitudinal slots are cut around the cylindrical waveguide.
The diameter φ value of the cylindrical waveguide is chosen 
so that the distance between the adjacent slots is about λg/2 
(λg is the waveguide wavelength).The length of each slot is 
about λ/2 (λ is the vacuum wavelength), and the width of 
each slot is 2~3mm.The terminal of cylindrical waveguide is
placed with metallic board for short circuit; the board is
about λg/2 from the center of the terminal slots [3]. An 
excitation probe is provided on one side of the center of each
slot. The slots of the antenna array are then excited in equal
phase [4]. The harmonic waves are stimulated in cylindrical
waveguide, then radiate to the outside [5]. The maximum
radiation
direction
is
perpendicular
to
the
cylindrical
waveguide surface [6]. In this paper, each slot array had six
longitudinal slots in a circumference of the cylindrical
waveguide. In order to obtain a higher gain, two rows of slot
arrays were cut in the cylindrical waveguide. The cylindrical
waveguide slot antenna structure is shown in Figure 1 and
the top view of the cylindrical waveguide slot antenna is
shown in Figure 2.

After
the
basic
parameters
of
the
antenna
were
calculated, the antenna was simulated and optimized by radio
frequency simulation software, then given the cylindrical
waveguide diameter φ= 100mm, L1 = 47mm, L2 = 143mm, 
L3 = 57mm, L4 = 51mm. The diameters of the probes were
not obvious to the electrical performance of the antenna. The
diameter of the probes was chosen to be 3mm in this paper.
The experiments show that the length of the probes into the
cylindrical waveguide were sensitive to the performance of
the antenna. The lengths may be determined by debugging
[7].
III.
TEST RESULTS
The array antenna was manufactured using the above
optimization calculation results. The test results showed that
the lengths of the probes extending into the cylindrical
waveguide had obvious influence on the performance of the
antenna. The performance of the antenna was mainly
changed in the standing wave and the azimuth amplitude.
The changes are shown in Table I. After debugging, when
the probes extended into the cylindrical waveguide with the
length of 23 mm, the better electrical performance can be
given. The curve of Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)
is shown in Figure 3. The far field radiation patterns of
antenna in the high, medium and low frequency in E-plane,
H-plane are shown in Figure 4. The antenna has omni-
directional characteristic in the 360° range, its amplitude
fluctuation of far field radiation pattern in E-plane does not
exceed 1.9dB, and “8” radiation characteristic approximately
in H-plane.

As seen in Figure 3, when the lengths of the probes in
the cylinder waveguide were 23 mm, the values of VSWR
were smaller. The value of VSWR can be less than 1.6 in 2.6
~ 3.0 GHz frequency range.
