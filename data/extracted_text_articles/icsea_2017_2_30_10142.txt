Abstract—The term Internet of Things (IoT) is used to 
describe many objects connected and communicating with 
each other. In this scenario, where different things share 
information in distinct environments, some security problems 
become evident. Among those issues, authentication is an 
important technique for ensuring a reliable and secure 
communication between objects in an IoT environment. This 
paper has mapped the current state of the authentication use in 
an IoT environment, highlighting the challenges and the main 
techniques used in authentication solutions. 
Keywords- internet of things; authentication; authorization; 
systematic mapping;  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays it is natural to face a scenario in which smart 
objects are connected to the Internet, exchanging data and 
information, interacting with users and other devices. It is 
possible to notice these objects in several different areas, 
such 
as, 
healthcare 
monitoring, 
telecommunication, 
vehicular automation, traffic, elderly and children care, etc. 
[1]. This group of connected objects is denominated IoT. 
According to Gartner institute, it is expected that 8.4 
billion smart devices will be connected and in use by the 
end of 2017. It is also estimated that a number close to 20.4 
billion devices will be connected by the end of 2020. This 
demonstrates a growing investment in the new business 
niche involving IoT solutions. Still, in the same article, it is 
presented that companies are expected to invest around US$ 
1.7 trillion in IoT applications by the end of 2017  and reach 
US$ 3 trillion by 2020 [2]. 
IoT is not just a machine-to-machine network or a 
network, with smart and physical objects, that contains 
embedded technology to sense/interact with their internal 
state or external environment. IoT defines an ecosystem that 
includes things, communication, applications, data analysis, 
business opportunity and innovation [3]. In this context, IoT 
will enable a broad variety of new ways to interact in 
citizens cotidianum, connecting smart objects, interacting in 
different environments, using different protocols and 
combining a natural heterogeneous environment through a 
set of different approaches [4]. This way, many companies 
develop platforms to explore and facilitate internet solutions 
of things like the KNoT, a meta platform that focuses on 
implementing the integration between existing hardware and 
software IoT platform [5]. 
In this complex heterogeneous structure of IoT 
environments, in which connected solutions are already part 
of people and companies practices, manipulating and storing 
information, many security issues can be highlighted. Data 
privacy, device identification, authentication, authorization 
and software vulnerability are some of these concerns, that 
must be addressed while IoT are still in its early stages of 
development [4][6][7]. 
In order to provide trust of the information, that the 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information 
are not violated, security mechanisms must be considered. 
In terms of information security, authentication is a property 
of a system that is related to an actor being able to provide a 
set of information to prove that he is indeed who it claims to 
be. 
In the context of IoT, authentication is related to any 
claim of an object, from a system, another object or user, 
and it validates if the claimer is who it affirms it is. 
Authentication is important not only to authenticate a 
user, but also to manage credentials as a whole, ensuring 
that those who do not have permissions are blocked from 
accessing. Since IoT is a new and challenging area, this 
work will focus in a research about what has been studied 
and built in terms of authentication in IoT. 
In order to provide a broad overview about 
authentication in an IoT environment and also identify 
opportunities, challenges and other matters on this topic, 
this paper conducts a systematic mapping. A systematic 
mapping aims to identify the quantity, type of research and 
results available within a specific area. It also aims to verify 
the evolution and state of the art in that area [8]. This work

is divided, as follows: in Section 2, the methodology used to 
perform this research will be described, along with the 
protocol, methods, and the processes used in this mapping 
review. Section 3 presents the results and summarizes the 
main points about the subject addressed. Finally, in the last 
section, conclusions and future works will be presented. 
 
II. 
APPLIED PROTOCOL 
Based upon the guidelines for the development of 
systematic reviews in software engineering described by 
Kitchenham et al. [8] and the analysis of the review model 
by Dybå and Dingsøyr [9], a new methodology for revision 
was created. Our review methodology is composed of six 
steps: (1) development of the protocol, (2) identification of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, (3) search for relevant 
studies, (4) critical assessment, (5) extraction of data, and 
(6) synthesis. The steps applied to the study contained 
herein are presented below: 
The objective of this review is to identify primary 
studies that focus on the use of authentication techniques 
that aims to solve IoT security problems. The following 
question helps identifying primary studies. 
 
● 
How important are authentication techniques on IoT 
environments and what are the challenges, concerns, 
and expectations about these techniques? 
 
From this central question and after an internal debate 
between the authors, other secondary questions were 
developed to help comprehending the problem: 
 
1. What are the main challenges about authentication 
in an IoT environment? 
2. What are the main authentication methods or 
techniques used in an internet environment of 
things? 
3. What are the advantages, benefits and challenges in 
the use of techniques that use RFID as an 
authentication artifact? 
A. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
For this review, studies that aim to analyze the use of 
authentication techniques to improve security in IoT 
environments were considered. Since this field of research is 
recent, this review limited the examined studies to the ones 
published starting from the year of 2015, due to the great 
emergence of relevant studies as of this year. 
The following works were also excluded: 
● 
Studies not published in the English language;  
● 
Studies that were unavailable online; 
● 
Studies not based on research or that are 
incomplete; 
● 
Call for works, prefaces, conference annals, 
handouts, summaries, panels, interviews and news 
reports. 
B. Search Strategies 
The databases considered in the study were: 
● 
ACM Digital Library; 
● 
IEEE Xplore; 
● 
SpringerLink;  
Some terms were defined and combined based on the 
proposed questions. As a result, a set of five strings were 
defined and used to conduct the search in the databases.  
((IOT or internet of things) and security) and 
authentication); 
(((IOT or internet of things) and authentication) and 
challenges); 
(((IOT or internet of things) and authentication) and 
techniques); 
(((IOT or internet of things) and authentication) and 
methods); 
(((IOT or internet of things) and authentication) and 
RFID); 
In the process of extracting information from the 
databases, the search strings were used separately on each 
database. The searches were performed between March 
2017 and April 2017. The results of each search were 
grouped together according to the database and were, later, 
examined closer in order to identify duplicity. Table 1 
shows the amount of studies found on each database.

C. Studies Selection Process 
This section describes the selection process from the 
beginning: from the initial search using the Search 
Strategies previously described to the identification of 
primary studies.  
At the first step, an analysis was realized to remove all 
duplicated articles from the set of studies obtained. After 
removal, 1208 non-duplicated works remained, they were 
added to Mendeley’s citation management tool. 
In a second phase, the titles of all works selected in the 
previous step were analyzed to determine its relevance in 
this systematic mapping. At this stage, many works that did 
not mention using authentication into IoT, authentication 
techniques or methods were eliminated. 
Due to the use of terms related to authentication in IoT 
environment, 
many 
works 
depicting 
about 
cloud 
authentication, biometric authentication and biological 
identification were found. In those cases, all works whose 
titles did not conform to the scope of the review were 
eliminated. In other cases, when the works titles were vague 
or unclear, they were put aside to be analyzed in the next 
step. At the end of this stage, 553 citations were excluded, 
thus remaining 205 items for further analysis.

In the third step, all abstracts of the filtered works were 
closely examined, showing an enormous quality variation. 
Once again, many studies were eliminated due to their non 
conformity to the scope of authentication being used to 
solve privacy and security issues in IoT environments. 
Others had no abstracts or had abstracts that did not clearly 
presented what the article was about. In the end, a total of 
99 papers were selected.  
Table 2 presents the amount of studies filtered in each 
step of selection process.

D. Quality Assessment 
In this assessment stage, the works were submitted to a 
critical analysis. In this stage, the complete studies were 
analyzed, instead of only the titles or abstracts. After this, 
the last studies that were considered uninteresting for the 
review were eliminated resulting in the final set of works. 
After the quality assessment, relevance grades were 
attributed to the remaining works. The relevance grades are 
going to be useful in the next stage. Six questions, based on 
Kitchenham et al. [8], were used to guide quality 
assessment. Those questions determine the credibility, rigor 
and relevance of the article to be analyzed. Out of the six, 
the first is the most important due to its capability to 
determine if the work is addressed to the review subject. 
The five remaining questions are useful in determining the 
quality of the work, so they were used to classify the works 
according to the quality. The questions were: 
 
1. Does the study analyze the benefits of using 
authentication in an IoT environment? 
 
2. Is the study based on research - not merely on 
specialists’ opinions? 
 
3. Are the objectives of the study clearly stated? 
 
4. Is the context of the study adequately described? 
 
5. Was the research project adequate to reach the 
research objectives? 
 
6. Were the research results adequately validated? 
 
After a deep analysis at the quality assessment stage, 49 
of the remaining 57 studies were selected to the stage of 
data extraction and synthesis and were, thus, considered as 
the primary studies. The quality assessment process will be 
presented in detail in the result section along with the 
assessment of the 49 remaining studies. 
III. 
RESULTS 
In total, 49 primary studies were identified, each one 
dealing with a wide array of research topics and using a 
wide set of exploration models for different scenarios. 
After evaluating the primary studies, the works revealed 
patterns related with authentication and identification in IoT 
environment. Several studies had a theoretical essence 
centered on the proposal of an authentication mechanism, 
using it in two or more steps. Many of the solutions 
analyzed use the authentication scheme applying elliptic 
curve cryptosystem (ECC), which is a public key 
cryptography method, that uses points on an elliptic curve to 
derive a 163-bit public key, equivalent in strength to a 1024-
bit RSA key and XOR operations. In further studies, 
authentication occurs through devices that use Radio-
Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is one of the most 
important technologies used in IoT area, as it can store 
sensitive data, communicate with other objects wirelessly 
and 
identify/track 
objects 
automatically 
in 
user 
identification. 
A. Quantitative Analysis 
The developed research process resulted in 49 primary 
studies. They were written by 193 authors linked to 
institutions based on different countries, distributed on four 
continents, and were published between 2015 and 2017. In 
total, the authors identified 225 different keywords in their 
work. In many works, the authors approach different ways 
to make authentication, with two or three steps or using 
RFID. To emphasize this affirmation, Figure 1 presents a 
word cloud generated with all works titles.

The most common keywords used in the remaining 
works with their respective frequency were: authentication 
(10), Internet of things (8), security (3), privacy (3), wireless 
sensor networks (3), techniques (1), methods (1), RFID (1). 
The first three keywords - authentication, internet of things 
and security - reflect precisely the theme of the research

contained herein. 
B. Qualitative Analysis 
As described in the quality assessment, each one of the 
primary studies was assessed according to six quality 
criteria related to rigor and credibility, as well as to 
relevance. If considered as a whole, these six criteria 
provide a good measure to the conclusions that a particular 
study can bring to the mapping. The classification for each 
criteria used a scale of positives and negatives. 
In Table 3, columns ‘q1’ to ‘q6’ represent the 6 criteria 
defined by the questions used on the quality assessment: 
Focus in Authentication, Research, Clearly, Context, 
Project, and Validation. 
For each criteria, '1' represents the positive answer and 
'0' the negative one.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
After analysis and data extraction, steps performed on 
the primary studies, it was possible to identify some aspects 
related with authentication in IoT application environments. 
First, it is possible to conclude that security in IoT 
environment is a very recent field of research since the 
majority studies used in this article have been published 
after 2015. Secondly, it was possible to conclude that in 
many applications, different ways are used to make 
authentication. In some cases, when using two or more 
authentication steps, it is possible to work with digital and 
iris recognition or RFID for identification. 
In these works, it was possible to identify the importance 
of creating an efficient mechanism against the most 
common internet attacks such as MitM, replay, forward 
secrecy and DoS. Therefore, in order to get this efficiency, 
many works used elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) 
scheme. 
 
A. What 
are 
the 
main 
challenges 
regarding 
authentication in an IoT environments? 
There are challenges that need to be addressed in IoT 
authentication. The first challenge is to reduce the energy 
cost on the authentication process; for example, elliptic 
curve cryptography (ECC) is an authentication protocol, 
which uses implicit certificate aiming to reduce energy 
consumption and computation overhead [11] in wireless 
sensor networks for distributed IoT Applications. 
The second challenge [12] introduced is to deploy 
authentication protocols adapted to the IoT environment. 
Different network architectures are based on different IoT 
notions and need to deploy authentication schemes to secure 
communications [13].  
Another challenge is to design an authentication scheme 
identifying the users in their respective devices without 
maintaining permanent contact between those parts [14]. 
The last challenge is to achieve cross network security in 
machine to machine communications issues like diverse 
channels, 
interfaces, 
and 
context 
environments 
of 
heterogeneous networks [15] need to be addressed. 
 
B. What are the main authentication methods or 
techniques used in the internet of things? 
Similar to the current internet applications, there are 
many mechanisms to provide authentication in an IoT 
platform. In this way, one possible solution is to use three 
factors for authentication which includes, ID, password and 
fingerprint [2]. In other words, Mbarek et al. [16] explains 
three methods used in authentication. The first method 
consists in a signature-based mechanism, this signature 
could be an ID or an elliptic curve signature, for example. 
The advantage of this authentication method is that it 
provides fast messaging authentication, with sender 
repudiation [16]. The second method ensures immediate 
messaging authentication and inherits security of different 
signatures, such as Winternitz, which is a one-time signature 
that are proven to be existentially unforgeable under 
adaptive chosen message attacks. The third method 
implements a lightweight symmetric primitives, like the 
ones used in µTESLA context, where the authentication key 
is secret for a time interval and will be disclosed after a 
certain period of time [16]. 
Other technique that can be used in IoT architecture is 
identification of neighbor nodes and a data aggregation to 
authenticate group members that uses an authentication 
scheme in wireless sensor network (WSN) using elliptic 
curve cryptosystem (ECC) and XOR operation [17]. 
Another paper cites RFID authentication due to its strong 
requirements 
and 
the 
ability 
to 
ensure 
secure 
communication between RFID tags and the server [18]. In 
the next question this subject will be more discussed. 
Other uncommon mechanism used to improve security is 
presented in the second step of the authentication process. 
First, the user enters with his/hers username and password. 
If the verification is completed successfully, the second step 
of authentication is started by allowing the user to enter a 
registered and predefined sequence of events, such as menu 
or mouse activity, on a fake server screen [1]. 
One of the most secure mechanism of authentication is 
cited in [19]. It is the One Time Password (OTP) technique 
developed with elliptic curves cryptography (ECC). It is the 
most efficient and secure compared to the existing methods 
like the Key Distribution Center (KDC). This method does 
not store the device's private and public keys, it only stores 
their IDs. 
Finally, the most popular method used to secure 
authentication is the two step verification. It sends a 
verification code to a mobile phone or uses a smart card for 
generating keys on the devices directly [19].  
 
C. What are the advantage, benefits and challenges in 
the use of techniques that use RFID as an 
authentication artifact? 
Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) is one of the 
most important technologies used in the IoT, as it can store 
sensitive data, communicate and identify objects [18]. The 
RFID system is composed of three components: RFID tag, 
reader and a trusted back-end server [19]. 
Zeadally et al. [18] show that the RFID has advantages if 
compared to the traditional barcode reader. It can be applied 
to objects with rough surfaces, provide both read/write 
capabilities, it requires no line-of-sight contact with RFID 
readers, 
it is 
able 
to read 
multiple 
RFID 
tags 
simultaneously, and provides strong authentication to the 
user data [21]. 
To reduce communication and computation overheads, 
the RFID reader uses a scheme that enables to resist various 
common attacks such as the MitM, replay, forward secrecy, 
and DoS [22]. ECC-based RFID authentication schemes 
38

ICSEA 2017 : The Twelfth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

have attracted a lot of attention, Zeadally et al. [18] argue 
that the PKC-based RFID authentication schemes are 
necessary for secure communication in RFID systems 
because many security attributes cannot be implemented. 
However, elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) is more 
suitable because it can provide similar security level but 
with a shorter key size and has low computational

CONCLUSION 
The purpose of this review was to identify primary 
studies that focus on the use of authentication, with its 
challenges and opportunities. In the searching phase, 1208 
studies were found, out of which 49 were classified as 
primary studies after the selection and the quality criteria 
were applied. Many of the studies found in the first steps did 
not focus on IoT authentication solutions. Such works 
focused only in cloud computing and techniques that deal 
just with data privacy were not selected to compose the 
search. 
In the analysis performed on the group of selected 
articles, theoretical and practical solutions that described 
techniques and methods of authentication were found. The 
vast majority of the studies were validated in a more 
superficial and theoretical way, highlighting their strengths 
and their advantages. 
This systematic review has found different ways to 
perform authentication in IoT environments and, among 
them, the use of ECC was present in majority of articles 
aiming to ensure security with low power consumption. 
This work also showed the main challenges of applying 
authentication in an IoT environment. The low energy 
storage capacity of connected devices can be highlighted as 
one of the main concerns. In the process of solving this 
major challenge, a large number of authentication solutions 
use elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that provides security 
with low processing power, adding more efficiency in 
authentication algorithms. 
Regarding the future work, a comparison between light 
authentication 
solutions 
based 
on 
elliptic 
curve 
cryptography is proposed. A more detailed analysis about 
elliptic curve cryptography can be performed in order to 
validate if the use of the technique satisfies the challenges of 
security and low power consumption in an IoT environment.
