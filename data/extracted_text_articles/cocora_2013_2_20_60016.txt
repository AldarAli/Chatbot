Abstract—In the paper, we study optimal transmission strate-
gies in multi-channel opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) net-
works where one secondary user (SU) opportunistically accesses
multiple orthogonal channels of primary users (PUs) under a
continuous time Markov chain modeling of the channel occu-
pancy by the PUs. Referred to as tunable threshold strategy, at
a given time the SU chooses one channel of a given PU, decides
if it should transmits or not and if so it protects the PU of
this channel. To be operational, such a structure depends on the
capability of the SU radio front-end to perform channel sensing.
We consider one scenario where the SU node can simultaneously
sense multiple channels and another scenario where the SU node
can sense only one channel at a time. For each scenario, we
develop the structure of the optimal transmission strategy and
analyse the performance. We show that the optimal transmission
strategy can be implemented using a simple tunable threshold
algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION
The concept of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) has been
envisaged in the context of secondary sharing of the spectrum,
with the objective that sharing is transparent to the spectrum
licensee, also called the primary user (PU). The spectrum is
shared with secondary users (SU)s but absolute protection is
demanded for PUs on all channels. As part of the DSA, the
opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) approach encompasses
operating regime in which the spectrum is shared on the
interference tolerance basis: a SU has open access to the
multiple channels of PUs when the PUs are not transmitting,
provided that the level of interference caused by the SU is
kept below a prescribed tolerance level [1]. We refer to such
a regime the OSA medium access control (OSA MAC).
Following the OSA model, the OSA MAC protocol is
the main element that determines the efﬁciency of secondary
sharing of the spectrum with the PUs. The fraction of channel
bandwidth used by successfully transmitted messages of a SU,
also called throughout, gives a good indication of the efﬁciency
of an operational OSA MAC, and the maximum value it can
attain is known as the capacity of the protocol. However,
the diverse behavior of different PUs on various channels
creates spectrum opportunities having different characteristics
that affects the design of the OSA MAC protocol and therefore
inherently puts limitations on the capacity it can achieve
[1],[2].
For an optimal design of OSA MAC, it is of interest to
characterize the maximum throughput as an objective func-
tion, with optimal sensing and transmission strategies being
the set of optimization variables. Here, the sensing strategy
suggests which channel to sense and the transmission strategy
determines whether to transmit or not.
In the paper, we study optimal transmission strategies in
multi-channel OSA networks where one SU opportunistically
accesses multiple orthogonal channels of PUs under a contin-
uous time Markov chain modeling of the channel occupancy
by the PUs. Referred to as tunable threshold strategy, at a
given time the SU chooses one channel of a given PU, decides
if it should transmit or not and if so it protects the PU of
this channel. To be operational, such a structure depends on
the capability of the SU radio front-end to perform channel
sensing. We consider one scenario where the SU node can
simultaneously sense multiple channels and another scenario
where the SU node can sense only one channel at a time. For
each scenario, we develop the structure of the optimal trans-
mission strategy and analyse its performance. We show that
the optimal transmission strategy can be implemented using a
simple tunable threshold algorithm. The performance of this
class of threshold strategies is analyzed and it characterizes the
maximum throughput of a multi-channel OSA network as a
function of the collision tolerance and the number of channels.
A ﬁrst cognitive MAC protocol supporting secondary shar-
ing over multiple primary channels was presented in [3]. The
optimal sensing problem that governs the channel selection
for opportunistic communications over multiple channels was
addressed in [4]. Assuming that both PU and SU follow the
same transmission structure, it was shown that the sensing
policy has a simple structure that reduces the channel selection
to a counting procedure and it avoids the need for knowing
the channel transition probabilities. A separation principle
that decouples the design of sensing and access policies was
advanced in [5].
A more realistic model that characterizes the spectrum
occupancy of PUs as on-off continuous time Markov processes
was presented in [6]. The problem of designing cognitive MAC
protocol was extended to multiple continuous time Markovian
channel in [7], where the sensing policy is restricted to a
periodic sensing scheme yielding to a simple and practical
access strategy that satisﬁes interference constraints.

Interesting results were reported in [8], where it was shown
that when the collision constraints are tight, a periodic sensing
scheme with memoryless access is optimal compared to the
case when all channels are simultaneously sensed. Different
from that, we introduce an alternative way to represent the
SU’s limitations, which allows us the application of maximum
entropy principle to construct the hopping sensing sequence,
and thereby derive optimal dynamic access strategies.
The rest of the paper is organized as follow. Section II
describes the system model that characterizes PU and SU
activities. Section III describes operational properties of the
multichannel cognitive access. Section IV presents the struc-
tural solutions of the multichannel cognitive access policies.
Section V reports numerical results. Section VI concludes the
paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we describe the basic elements of a typical
OSA system for which we derive the system protocol types
and their operating procedures. Two protocols are described
and analyzed, which we call multi-channel sensing capability
(MCSC) and single-channel sensing capability (SCSC). These
in turn serve as a mean to evaluate the OSA network perfor-
mance with respect to technical and regulatory aspects.
We consider the scenario where a single SU is trying to
access N independent channels by using a time slotted trans-
mission structure. Three elements compose such a scenario:
the primary networks with spectrum, a secondary network with
usage and the OSA MAC responsible to carry out the sharing
of spectrum among PUs and SUs.
A. PU Model
We consider a heterogeneous network with N orthogonal
channels indexed by i, i = 1, 2, ..., N. The index i designates
a PU channel and the PU activities on different channels
are independent. A channel is required to have the following
attributes to be a candidate for secondary sharing.
1) Channel occupancy: we assume that the occupancy
of each channel by PU transmissions follows a two state
homogeneous continuous time Markov chain. The two states
of channel i denotes the idle state(0) and the busy state(1).
This is motivated by the packet-based trafﬁc pattern for PUs
activity [9]. The Markovian assumption means that the sojourn
time attached to each state is exponentially distributed with
parameter λ−1
i
for the idle state and µ−1
i
for the busy state,
respectively. The transition rate matrix Qi of the occupancy
of PU channel i is given by
Qi =
 −λi
µi
µi
−λi

(1)
Let the probability vector {ηi(0), ηi(1)} be the stationary
distribution of the ith channel occupancy model associated
with Qi. This is given by
ηi(0) =
µi
λi + µi
,
ηi(1) =
λi
λi + µi
(2)
2) Interference tolerance: although the networks of the
PUs were not designed to tolerate interference from secondary
transmissions, we assume that the collision in these networks
caused by a SU transmission is under control. This enables
us to evaluate the effect of interference caused by the SU to
a channel in terms of the capacity loss considered acceptable
by the PU rather than as a reliability consideration [10]. We
assume that for each candidate PU channel there is a packet
collision probability denoted by ζi. This is deﬁned as the
maximum probability of collision for a packet on channel i
that the PU can tolerate.
B. SU Model
We consider a single SU trying to opportunistically access
the N channels so as to maximize its throughput, but it can
transmit using only one channel at a time. The SU is cognitive
radio equipped. Time is slotted into discrete time steps indexed
by t, t = 1, 2, ..., T, but the PUs are not synchronized to it.
For an effective usage of the spectrum by the SU com-
munications, a spectrum opportunity is associated with two
characteristics. One includes the estimate of the probability
of a channel being free from PU’s activity whereas the other
includes the estimate of the collision rate of the service being
provided on the channel. Thus, we associate the following
attributes to the notion of spectrum opportunity.
1) Opportunity identiﬁcation: the notion of spectrum op-
portunity is local to a pair of SU nodes. Speciﬁcally, a SU is
capable of channel sensing, then a channel in the spectrum is
an opportunity for secondary sharing if no primary signal is
heard, and thereafter the channel is deemed idle at both the
sender and receiver of the SU pair. We assume that the SU
accurately executes the channel sensing operation. In this way,
the performance of channel sensing over a long run provides
the actual estimate of the probability that a channel is free
from PU’s activity at any given time.
2) Interference constraint: a spectrum opportunity depends
on the type of collision constraint imposed by PUs, which
in turn is determined by the communication activities of
the PUs. Let the collision probability for PU on channel i
denoted by ξi be the fraction of collided packets in packets
fully transmitted by the particular PU. Therefore the collision
constraint imposed on channel i is given by
0 ≤ ξi ≤ ζi,
i = 1, 2, ..., N
(3)
We talk of equal collision constraints if ζi = ζ for all i. Also,
this can be considered as the PU protection requirement in the
sense that PU communications experiencing collision below
ζi do not affect the reliability of the overall PU service being
provided on channel i.
Throughout the paper, for a particular PU channel i, we refer
to ξi as capacity cost, and ζi as capacity limit. We assume
that the SU has the estimate of the PUs trafﬁc parameters
(λi, µi) whose values are integer multiples of the SU slot
length. Also the stationary probabilities {ηi(0), ηi(1)} and the
capacity constrains are known a priori.

and Ni are random variables representing the
number of collided and transmitted PU packets, respectively.
Also E[·] denotes the expectation of a random variable.
B. Multi-Channel Sensing Capability (MCSC)
We assume that the SU has the capability to simultaneously
sense all channels, but it can use at most one channel at a time
to execute its transmission. However, over time its transceiver
device can switch among different channels.
Let si(t) ∈ {0, 1} be the state of channel i such that a SU
executes sensing at time t and then it observes the channel
being idle(0) or busy(1). For clarity purposes, we denote
the outcome of channel sensing as the true state because we
assume the channel sensing to be error free.
The process {si(t), t ∈ T} characterizes the occupancy of
channel i and it is assumed to have a discrete-time Markovian
structure. Let S(t) = [s1(t), s2(t), ..., sN(t)] be the actual
system state under MCSC such that the process {S(t), t ∈ T}
characterizes the actual occupancy of the N channels. We
assume that all {si(t)} are independent Markov chains, so
that {S(t)} has also a Markovian structure. This is completely
speciﬁed by the state space S = {s}, s ∈ {0, 1}N. Let F(s)
be the probability of state s. It can be evaluated by using
{ηi(0), ηi(1)}, ∀i. As such, the SU maintains the actual state
of the system at the beginning of each time slot t, S(t) = s.
Consider an arbitrary time slot t, then a status vector
s = [s1, s2, ..., sN] indicates which channels have been already
sensed and also the state of each channel. In this time slot,
when channel i is idle, we use Xi(t) to denote a state that
indicates the number of channels currently idle including the
channel i. Xi(t) takes its values in the set {1, 2, ..., N}. Let
[Xi = x] = {s|X(s) = x, si = 0} be the set of idle channels
at state x, x ∈ {1, 2, ..., N}. The probability of Xi gives,
respectively, the PMF(pXi(x)) and CDF(FXi(x)) denoted by
pXi(x)
=

[Xi=x]
F(s)

FXi(x)
=
x
X
j=1
pXi(j),
1 ≤ x ≤ N
(9)
where FXi(x) denotes the probability of state x given that
channel i is idle.
Let Π denote the set of all MCSC policies. We characterize
an access mode πMC ∈ Π as follows. In each time slot, a SU
maintains its transmission probability ωi(x, s) with which it
decides to transmit on channel i at state x given s or not.
The maximazation of the system throughput for the MCSC
protocol can be done by specifying:
• The normalization, which is given by
N
X
i=1
ωi(x, s) ≤ 1,
ωi(x, s) ≥ 0
(10)
• The capacity cost ξi,N(πMCX) of using channel i, which
is given by:
ξi,N(πMC) =
N

x=1

1 − ηi(0)exp(−λit)
∀i
(11)
• The capacity constraints, which is given by
ξi,N(πMC) ≤ ζi,
i = 1, ..., N
(12)
C. Single Channel Sensing Capability (SCSC)
We assume that the SU can sense at most one channel at
a time. Let {Di}, i = 1, ..., N, be the set of system states
under SCSC such that the system is at state Di(t) when the
SU senses the i-th channel in slot t and it observes the channel
i being idle. The state probabilities {pi}, i = 1, ..., N, with
the entropy function H given by
H(p1, ..., pN) = −
X
i
piln(pi)
(13)
denotes how likely it is that the channel i is idle(0) before
sensing starts at any time slot t. We assume pi are independent
and without loss of generality we also assume that p1 ≥ p2 ≥
... ≥ pN.
Let ˆΠ denote the set of all SCSC. We characterize an access
mode πSC ∈ ˆΠ as follows. In each time slot, a SU maintains
its transmission probability ωi(si) with which it decides to
transmit on channel i at state Di given si or not.
The maximazation of the system throughput for the SCSC
protocol is done as follows.
1) Prior Information: we assume that we know about the
state probabilities {pi}, i = 1, 2, ..., N:
• The normalization

pi = 1

2) Maximum Entropy: The maximization of the system’s

IV. MULTICHANNEL COGNITIVE ACCESS POLICIES
Simple structural solutions are presented as optimal al-
gorithms for the MCSC protocol and the SCSC protocol,
respectively.
A. MCSC Structure
The setting of the optimal MCSC algorithm is as follows.
Let K, 1 ≤ K ≤ N, be the threshold of the MCSC algorithm
such that for each channel i the following conditions are met.
• Given {ξi,K}, 1 ≤ K ≤ N, for each channel i, we ﬁnd
the threshold K by using ζi ∈ [ξi,K−1, ξi,K]
• For the channel i currently observed busy,
ωi(x, s) = 0
• For the channel i currently idle at state x, threre are tree
subcases.
– For the states x such that x = K and K ≥ 1
ωi(x, s) =
ζi − ξi,K−1

ξi,0 = 0
– For the states x such that x < K and K > 1
ωi(x, s) = 1

– For the states x such that x > K
ωi(x, s) = 0
Therefore, the throughput of the MCSC is given by

B. SCSC Structure
The setting of the optimal MCSC algorithm is as follows.
Let G, 1 ≤ G ≤ N, be the threshold of the SCSC algorithm
such that for all channels N the following conditions are met.
• Given {ξG}, 1 ≤ G ≤ N, for the N channels, we ﬁnd
G by using ¯ζ ∈ [ξG−1, ξG], ξ0 = 0.
• For the case that either G = 1 or G > N, then β, {pi}

Therefore, the throughput of the SCSC is given by

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section we report two numerical results: one on
the performance of the MCSC approach and the other on
the performance of the SCSC approach. In particular, the
throughout performance for both MCSC and SCSC deﬁnes,
for a given set of PUs channels characteristics, the capacity
of a multi-channel opportunistic system with multi-channel
sensing and single-channel sensing, respectively.
For the purpose of performance comparison, we use the
periodic sensing with memoryless access (PSMA) approach
optimized for strict collision constraints regime [7],[8]. This
means that the collision probability on individual channels
must be small.
In calculations, the slot duration t is chosen to be t =
0.25ms. The selection of the channel parameters are motivated
from the experiments conducted in [6]. For the operating
environments, we use examples of network conﬁgurations
with N = 2, 3 parallel primary channels, and the channels
parameters being:
• For N
= 2, λ = [1/4.20, 1/3.23] ms−1 and µ =
[1/2.32, 1/1.11] ms−1.
• For N = 3, λ = [1/6.23, 1/4.20, 1/3.23] ms−1 and µ =
[1/3.12, 1/2.32, 1/1.11] ms−1.
A. Performance of the MCSC Structure
We study the throughput of the MCSC approach in compar-
ison to the throughput of PSMA approach. In Figure 3 we plot
the throughputs of MCSC approach and the PSMA approach
for the two network conﬁgurations and the capacity limit on
each channel ζi ranging in [0.01, 0.15].
It is observed that, for each network conﬁguration, MCSC
gives poor performance similar to PSMA when the constraints
are strict. This happens when ζ ∈ [0, 0.0475] in the ﬁgure
marked MCSC(N = 2) with K1 = 2, K2 = 1 obtained
through computation, and also when ζ ∈ [0, 0.025] in the
ﬁgure marked MCSC(N = 3) with K1 = 3, K2 = K3 = 2
obtained through computation. However, the throughout of
MCSC substantially improves compared to the throughout of
PSMA until the constrains relax on each channel. This happens
when ζ ∈ [0.1225, 0.15] in the ﬁgure marked MCSC(N = 2)
with K1 = K2 = 2 obtained through computation, and also
when ζ ∈ [0.0875, 0.15] in the ﬁgure marked MCSC(N = 3)
with K1 = K2 = K3 = 3 obtained through computation. This
reﬂects the threshold nature of MCSC. In particular, when N is
ﬁxed, a strict capacity constraint is achieved with the reduction
in the number of channels, requiring the SU to use a small
set of channels. In case the capacity constraints relax, only
the SU with advanced cognitive radio capabilities can use all
spectrum, resulting in substantial throughput improvement.
B. Performance of the SCSC Structure
Similarly, we study the throughput of the SCSC approach
in comparison to the throughput of the PSMA approach. In
Figure 4 we plot the throughputs of the SCSC approach and

Comparison of the throughputs of the MCSC and PSMA

the average capacity limit ¯ζ over all channels ranging in
[0.01, 0.2].
It is observed that, for each network conﬁguration, SCSC
gives poor performance similar to PSMA approach when the
constrains are strict. This happens when ¯ζ ∈ [0, 0.09] in
the ﬁgure marked SCSC(N
= 2) with β = 0 obtained
through computation. The throughput of SCSC saturates when
the constraint on each channel relaxes. This happens when
¯ζ ∈ [0, 0.14] in the ﬁgure marked SCSC(N
= 2) with
β = 0 obtained through computation. Similarly, this reﬂects
the threshold nature of SCSC. In particular, β = 0 features the
case where the channels exhibit equal opportunities, therefore
it is likely that the SU can use the spectrum without sophisti-
cated learning techniques.
However, the spectrum opportunities depart from being
uniform when ¯ζ = 0.0.095 in the ﬁgure marked SCSC(N = 2)
with β = 64.229 obtained through computation, and also
when ¯ζ = 0.075 in the ﬁgure marked SCSC(N = 3) with
β = 99.05 obtained through computation. In this case, the
SCSC makes it possible to resort to more structured sensing
patterns, consequently it improves its throughout substantially
compared to the PSMA approach.
We also note that the protocol threshold decreases with
the increase in the number of channels, thus adding more
channels provides for additional opportunities for secondary
exploitation.
VI. CONCLUSION
Optimal transmission strategies in multi-channel oppor-
tunistic spectrum access (OSA) networks have been studied
where one secondary (SU) opportunistically accesses multiple
orthogonal channels of primary users (PUs) under a continuous
time Markov chain modeling of the channel occupancy by
the PUs. Optimal access strategies for a single user under the
assumption that the SU has perfect knowledge on all channels

have been analysed. A special case has been considered with
limited sensing capability in which we ﬁrst constructed a
hopping sequence using the principle of maximum entropy.
This hopping sequence is then used to devise the access
strategy for the SU. We have shown that the channel selection
strategy that maximizes the system entropy function subject to
capacity constrains induces a hopping sequence with optimal
access. Future work is about access policies with mutliple
users.
