Abstract—In this paper, the simple LC tunnel diode is proved to 
oscillate at bias voltage in the range of the negative resistance 
region of tunnel diode. The Hopf bifurcation theorem is 
employed to prove the theoretical proof. The achieved analysis 
has been verified by circuit simulations and confirmed by 
experimental measurements. The results illustrates that for 
1N3716 tunnel diode, oscillations occur at a bias voltage starts 
from 65 mV to 500 mV.  
Keywords—Hopf Bifurcation; Tunnel Diode; Oscillations.

 INTRODUCTION  
One of the most powerful methods for studying periodic 
solutions in autonomous nonlinear systems is the Hopf 
bifurcation theorem. It shows that oscillations near an 
equilibrium point can be understood by looking at the 
eigenvalues of the linearized equations for perturbations from 
equilibrium and at certain crucial derivatives of the equation 
[1]. The problem discussed in this paper is applying Hopf 
analysis to an electronic circuit and verifying this using both 
simulation and hardware implementation and measurement. 
 Tunnel diodes are heavily doped p-n junctions only some 
10 nm (100 Å) wide. The heavy doping results in a broken 
bandgap, where conduction band electron states on the n-side 
are more or less aligned with valence band hole states on the 
p-side. Under normal forward bias operation, as voltage 
begins to increase, electrons at first tunnel through the p-n 
junction barrier because electron states in the conduction band 
on the n-side become aligned with valence band hole states on 
the p-side of the pn junction. As voltage increases further, 
these states become more misaligned and the current drops — 
this is called negative resistance, because current decreases 
with increasing voltage. As voltage increases yet further, the 
diode begins to operate as a normal diode, where electrons 
travel by conduction across the pn junction, and no longer by 
tunneling through the pn junction barrier. Thus, the most 
important operating region for a tunnel diode is the negative 
resistance region.  
This paper will be organized as follows: in Section-II Hopf 
bifurcation analysis is applied to the oscillator circuit [2].In 
Section-III, a SPICE model for the tunnel diode is built [3][4] 
and used in ORCAD software. The model is measured and 
compared with actual I-V characteristics measured with an I-
V characterization device. The circuit is simulated using 
PSPICE. The circuit is implemented and the simulated results 
are compared with the measured ones.

The derivative of the eigenvalues is always positive for all 
values of µ. The index is calculated and proved to be negative. 
The bifurcation occurs at the negative resistance region of the 
tunnel diode.

CIRCUIT SIMULATION AND 
IMPLEMENTATION  
In this section, circuit simulation is performed using 
OrCAD to verify the range of oscillation of the circuit. Then 
the circuit is implemented and measured to compare 
simulation results with experimental measurements. 
A.  Tunnel Diode Spice Model  
The tunnel diode has no PSPICE model, so ABM is used 
to be able to simulate the tunnel diode as shown in Figure 2 
using model equations in [3].

The diode current (Idiode) is a regular p-n junction 
forward current due to injection of free electrons and 
holes from conduction band (CB) in n-type to CB in 
p-type, and from valence band (VB) in p-type to VB 
in type, respectively. This current is given by:

Where: Is denotes the saturation current, η represents 
the ideality factor, and Vth=KT/q. 
 
Tunneling current (Itunnel) is the current due to 
tunneling of free electrons from CB in the n-type to 
free holes of the same energy in VB of the p-type. 
This current increases in the positive resistance region 
(ohmic region) due to the increase of the aligned 
energy states below Fermi-level in CB with that 
above Fermi-level in VB. At the same time, in the 
negative resistance region, the number of aligned 
energy states begin to decrease decreasing this 
current. This current is given by:

I-V characteristics were measured using Agilent I-V 
characterization system. Figure 3 shows the measured and 
simulated I-V characteristics.

B. Simulation 
The circuit was simulated using PSPICE a. A time domain 
analysis is done to the circuit. It was found that if the bias 
exceeds 0, the voltage across the inductor and capacitor 
oscillates with a frequency 𝜔𝑜 =
1
√𝐿𝐶  as mentioned before. 
This is shown in Figure 4. And when the bias exceeds VV, the 
oscillation begins to die. 
 
 
Figure 4.  output voltage versus time in PSPICE shows that it performs 
oscillations at frequency 𝜔0 
 
C. Circuit Implementation 
The circuit is implemented using a simple breadboard, and 
measured using an oscilloscope.

and applying its internal digital filter. 
 It was found that the output voltage was very close to the 
simulated one except for some noise that appeared on the 
signal, so an internal digital filter built in the oscilloscope is 
used and the filtered output voltage is shown in Figure 5. We 
see that it is almost the same as the simulated circuit. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Simple tunnel diode LC circuit oscillation was proved 
mathematically using the Hopf bifurcation theorem. The 
results showed that oscillation occurred at a bias voltage in the 
negative resistance region of the tunnel diode, an ABM of the 
tunnel diode was made to be able to simulate the circuit in 
PSPICE, and finally, the real circuit was implemented and its 
measured output was very close to the simulated one.
