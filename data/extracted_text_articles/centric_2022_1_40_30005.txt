Abstract—Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology 
that ranks among the top innovations in interactive media. With 
the emergence of new technologies, the question about the fac-
tors influencing user acceptance arises. Many research models 
on the user acceptance of technologies were developed and ex-
tended to answer this question in the last decades. This research 
paper provides an overview of the current state in the scientific 
literature on user acceptance factors of AR in training and edu-
cation. We conducted a systematic literature review, identifying 
45 scientific papers on technology acceptance of augmented re-
ality. Twenty-two papers refer more specifically to the field of 
training and education. Overall, 33 different technology ac-
ceptance models and 34 acceptance variables were identified. 
Based on the results, there is a great potential for further re-
search.  
Keywords—Technology acceptance; TAM; UTAUT; Augmented 
reality; Literature review; Training and education. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
AR is one of the top emerging technology innovations in 
interactive media. Over the past years, AR has found its way 
into different new application fields. One application area is 
education and training. AR can connect the digital and phys-
ical domains. Based on the technology, scenarios can be built 
to allow users to interact simultaneously in the real and vir-
tual worlds. When applied to training and education, users 
can learn more effectively through new ways and methods 
using AR. Hence, education and training are one of the appli-
cation fields where AR is applied most [1].  
This research paper is about the status quo of the technol-
ogy acceptance research on augmented reality as technology 
innovation in training and education. The main objective is to 
determine the state of research in the field mentioned above. 
The paper is structured as follows: Firstly, the theoretical 
background is described in Section II. For this, the terms AR 
and the theoretical foundation of technology acceptance, as 
well as is most common research models, are briefly de-
scribed. Secondly, a systematic literature review was con-
ducted. The scope and approach of this analysis are subject to 
Section III. The results of the literature review, including a 
more detailed discussion of the revealed models and variables, 
are presented in Section IV. The paper concludes with a sum-
mary of the findings and an outlook on further research in Sec-
tion V. 
 
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION 
A. Augmented Reality 
In the following, the theoretical background of aug-
mented reality is explained. The beginnings of the develop-
ment of AR solutions go back to the 1960s [2]. In scientific 
literature, Azuma [3] established a definition of AR: “Aug-
mented Reality (AR) is a variation of Virtual Environments 
(VE), or Virtual Reality [...], AR allows the user to see the 
real world, with virtual objects superimposed upon or 
composited with the real world.” So AR is an extension of 
reality, not a replacement for it. Furthermore, three key char-
acteristics of AR are defined: Firstly, AR combines reality 
and virtuality. Secondly, AR is an interactive application in 
real-time. Thirdly, the content is shown in 3D.  
AR is related to Virtual Reality (VR). Milgram et al. [4] 
imply a representation of this relation. This so-called Reality-
Virtuality (RV) Continuum shown in Figure 1 combines 
AR/VR and introduces Mixed Reality (MR) in between. AR 
is next to the real environment, Augmented Virtuality (AV) 
to the virtual environment. 
 
 
Figure 1. Reality-Virtuality-Continuum [4]. 
According to Milgram et al. [4], the RV Continuum can 
be defined as “… a generic Mixed Reality (MR) environment 
as one in which real-world and virtual world objects are pre-
sented together within a single display, that is, anywhere be-
tween the extrema of the RV continuum.” 
In summary, AR can be understood as a way to enhance 
the users’ perception and interaction with the real-world [3]. 
Although AR was firstly realized over 50 years ago, the use 
of this technology is still rudimental in both society and the 
economy. Identifying factors that influence the acceptance 
and further dissemination of AR is an important research 
question.

B. Technology Acceptance 
With emerging innovations, user acceptance refers to the 
decision whether to use a new technology or not. Acceptance 
is a latent construct with different factors influencing the con-
struct. To explain these factors, different research models 
were developed for a wide variety of systems and applica-
tions in various domains [5][6]. The two most influential 
models of technology acceptance are the Technology Ac-
ceptance Model (TAM) by Davis [7] and the Unified Theory 
of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by Ven-
katesh et al. [8]. Both models are described in the following. 
 
1) 
Technology Acceptance Model 
The TAM is the best known and most widely empirically 
validated model for explaining user acceptance towards tech-
nology [9]. The research model was developed by Davis as 
part of his doctoral dissertation [7] and can be traced back to 
the Theories of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Planned Behav-
ior (TPB). TRA and TPB are seen as important theoretical 
foundations of the TAM [7][9][10]. The TAM, including its 
variables and relationships, is shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [10]. 
Davis assumed that the actual use of a system depends on 
the Behavioral Intention (BI) of the user. BI depends on the 
User's Attitude towards Using (A) and Perceived Usefulness 
(PU). Together with Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), the two 
variables PU and PEOU build the core of the TAM: PU de-
scribes “… the degree to which a person believes that using a 
particular system would enhance his or her job perfor-
mance”[7]. PEOU is defined as “… the degree to which a per-
son believes that using a particular system would be free of 
effort”[7]. PU and PEOU have both a positive effect on the 
Attitude towards Using. In addition, PU and PEOU are influ-
enced by External Variables. Furthermore, PU directly im-
pacts BI [11]. 
Over the years, the TAM was frequently empirically vali-
dated and extended in different ways. Venkatesh et al. pub-
lished two extended models in the form of the TAM 2 [12] 
and TAM 3 [13]. Since its introduction 35 years ago, the TAM 
has become a powerful and robust model for technology ac-
ceptance in the field of information systems research [6][9]. 
 
2) Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
Another frequently used model in technology acceptance 
research [6] is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
Technology (UTAUT) by Venkatesh et al. [8]. The UTAUT 
was developed by integrating the eight most common ac-
ceptance-related theories and their variables into a unified 
model. In the UTAUT, as presented in Figure 3, the three var-
iables Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and So-
cial Influence, directly influence the Behavioral Intention. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
(UTAUT) [8].  
Performance Expectancy is defined as “… the degree to 
which an individual believes that using the system will help 
him or her to attain gains in job performance” [8]. This con-
struct is the strongest predictor of usage intention. Further-
more, Effort Expectancy is the second construct defined as“… 
the degree of ease associated with the use of the system.” [8] 
The third construct is Social Influence which is introduced as 
“… the degree to which an individual perceives that important 
others believe he or she should use the new system". The 
fourth construct, Facilitating Conditions represents “… the 
degree to which an individual believes that an organizational 
and technical infrastructure exists to support use of the sys-
tem” [8]. Facilitating Conditions is the fourth main construct 
of the UTAUT and has a direct impact on use behavior. Addi-
tionally, the UTAUT model contains the variables Gender, 
Age, Experience and Voluntariness of Use as moderators, i.e., 
with moderating effects on the main variables [8]. 
 
METHODOLOGY AND STUDY APPROACH 
A. Scope of the Study 
Since their release, TAM and UTAUT have become the 
subject of many research papers. The models have been em-
pirically validated in many different areas. In addition, other 
variables have been incorporated into the models to reflect 
the specifics of application environments or systems. The 
state of research and developments in technology acceptance 
research has already been the subject of many literature sur-
veys [6][14]-[18]. The goal of all these studies was to provide 
a general overview of the models and the specific factors in-
fluencing technology acceptance. To the authors' knowledge, 
however, there is no work to date that more comprehensively 
examines the applied research models for technology ac-
ceptance in the field of AR and specifically its application in 
training and education. Our research aims to fill this research 
gap and provide a grounding for further analysis. The main

contribution of this work is to gain an overview of the differ-
ent models and TAM/UTAUT extensions, as well as varia-
bles applied in this field. 
In our the literature review, we examined relevant re-
search on AR technology acceptance according to the follow-
ing criteria: 
• 
Research Objectives: This refers to the aim of the re-
search as well as to the AR systems, applications, and de-
vices that have been investigated in the papers. 
• 
Sample Data: Information about the geographic origin of 
the research and the user groups surveyed in the empirical 
part of the study. 
• 
Research Methods: In addition, the evaluation method 
used for the models were analyzed. 
• 
Technology Acceptance Model: The specific acceptance 
research model underlying the research. 
• 
Model Extension and Variables: Extensions of the origi-
nal models and corresponding acceptance variables.  
B. Systematic Literature Review Approach 
The literature review was based on a three-step approach, 
as shown in Figure 4. The objective was to gradually narrow 
down the articles to the point where research on technology 
acceptance of AR applications in training and education could 
be identified. The following seven scientific literature data-
bases have been researched for relevant articles: 
• 
Google Scholar  
• 
Science Direct  
• 
Springer 
• 
Emerald 
• 
ACM Digital Library 
• 
EconBiz  
• 
IEEE Explore Digital Library 
In the first step, the terms acceptance and augmented re-
ality were combined to form a search phrase. Only articles 
containing the search terms in their title were considered. This 
assumes that the title reflects the focus of the work. In sum-
mary, 204 articles were found. 
 
 
Figure 4. Approach to Literature Selection. 
 
In the second step, all remaining articles were analyzed for 
referring to a specific technology acceptance model, i.e., the 
TAM or UTAUT and its variants, resulting in 45 articles. 
In the third step, the specific application area of AR in 
training and application was applied as a filter criterion. As a 
result, 22 articles matching all criteria and focusing on tech-
nology acceptance of AR in training and education could be 
derived. The 22 articles are listed in Table III (Appendix). 
 
RESULT OF THE LITERATURE REVIEW 
In the following, the results of the literature review are pre-
sented structured on the criteria as discussed in Section III. 
A. Research Objectives 
Ten research articles of the 22 identified have conducted a 
quantitative study, whereas only two used a qualitative ap-
proach. Ten research papers comprise mixed-method studies 
with quantitative as well as qualitative procedures. This result 
indicates that technology acceptance research is predomi-
nantly quantitative in nature.  
Furthermore, the kind of AR device was examined. A dis-
tinction was made between mobile devices such as smart-
phones and tablets as well as AR glasses. Eight articles refer 
to mobile devices. No article investigated the use of AR 
glasses. Fourteen research papers did not specify a AR device 
as a subject of investigation at all.  
B. Sample Data 
Regarding the sample data, the countries of origin were 
first broken down by continent in which the surveys were con-
ducted. Most contributions (ten papers) come from Asia, fol-
lowed by seven articles from Europe. Three publications can 
be allocated to North America, whereas only one paper comes 
from South America. Two articles are cross-country studies 
that have conducted surveys in Australia and North America. 
This shows that most research activities are carried out in Asia 
and Europe. 
C. Research Methods 
The most popular research method for analyzing the sam-
ple data and validate the proposed research models are Struc-
ture Equation Modelling (SEM), regression analysis, and cor-
relation analysis. These methods were used seven times in the 
22 papers. Other evaluation methods, such as factor analysis, 
were applied only three times or less. The remaining papers 
did not provide any information on the evaluation methods. 
D. Technology Acceptance Model 
In this part, the different acceptance models were exam-
ined. Furthermore, the original acceptance model on which 
the articles are based was analyzed. In detail, 18 articles were 
based on the TAM. UTAUT and its variants built the basis for 
two articles. Furthermore, four papers did not propose an ex-
tension but applied the original models. The original TAM 
was used three times. The TAM2 was the referenced model in 
one research article. Another last article did not refer to any 
existing research model. The research activities show that the 
TAM is the most frequently used acceptance model, followed 
by the UTAUT and its successors. 
These findings reflect the previous research activities in 
the field of technology acceptance research. As already men-
22

tioned, especially the TAM is extended with different varia-
bles. The core components of the original TAM – Perceived 
Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) have 
been integrated most. It must be declared that only the main 
constructs Attitude Toward Using (A), Behavioral Intention 
to Use (BI) and Actual System Use weren’t considered. The 
third most used variable is Perceived Enjoyment. Perceived 
Enjoyment as introduced in TAM3 was defined as “… the ex-
tent to which the activity of using the computer is perceived to 
be enjoyable in its own right, apart from any performance 
consequences that may be anticipated” [13]. This variable 
was used in four of the AR acceptance research articles and 
thus most frequently for an extension of the TAM in all the 
papers investigated. Thus, the researchers seem to attach par-
ticular importance to this factor in the acceptance of AR. The 
other variables identified were used only very rarely. Against 
this background, the entire 45 identified AR acceptance re-
search papers will be examined on the variables for a model 
extension in the following. 
E. Model Extensions and Variables 
In reference to the scope of this study, the different model 
extensions and variables are of importance. Thus, the last in-
vestigation criteria was applied to all 45 articles, which refer 
to the acceptance of AR and contain a specific technology ac-
ceptance model in all application fields. Of these 45 articles, 
33 research articles have made an extension of a technology 
acceptance model by introducing own acceptance variables. 
Nineteen of these articles refer to training and education, 14 
to other application fields. Figure 5 shows the composition of 
the article selection. 
 
 
Figure 5. Composition of the article selection. 
 
The following section examines the 14 articles that relate to 
AR applications in other fields before the model extension on 
training and education are discussed thereafter. 
 
1) AR Exensions Outside Training and Education 
Nine of the 14 articles outside training and education in-
troduced variables on AR acceptance. The other five model 
extensions used already existing variables. In summary, 18 
variables referring to the specific application area of AR were 
identified. The eight variables Perceived Interactivity [19], 
Media Novelty [19], Previous Media Experience [19], Users’ 
Innovativeness [19], Recommendation [20], Risk [20], Play-
fulness Expectancy [21], and Content Relevance Expectancy 
[21] are introduced by the authors without providing a more 
comprehensive definition in the paper. The ten other variables 
are shown in Table I.

tions. The research model of Jung et al. [23] is shown here as

variables. This proposed research model refers to the appli-
cation field tourism and urban heritage and represents one 
model extension as example. The example was chosen be-
cause of the mixture of three existing models as well as new 
variables. Furthermore, the base of the model can be allocated 
to the TAM as most of the model extensions investigated in 
this literature survey. 
 
2) AR Extensions in Training and Education 
As mentioned before, 19 papers with model extensions 
were identified for AR acceptance research in training and ed-
ucation. Twelve of these papers proposed research models 
with extended variables. In summary, 16 AR acceptance var-
iables have been identified in the papers. Again, some papers 
introduced variables without a more comprehensive defini-
tion: Teaching Experience [32], Technology Experiences [32], 
Characteristics of the system [33], Information Experience 
[34], and Information Literacy [34]. One paper [35] proposed 
an acceptance model introducing Duration of Use, Perceived 
Exertion, Emotion, Attachment, Harm, Perceived Change, 
Movement, and Anxiety as moderating factors of AR ac-
ceptance. These six variables have not been further defined. 
In comparison, the other ten of the sixteen variables with their 
definition can be found in table II.

Furthermore, technology

[44] 
    The analysis shows that researchers in the field of training 
and education are also trying to adapt TAM and UTAUT to 
AR and the specific application conditions in the field 
through models with extended sets of variables. However, the 
low frequency of variable use also indicates that generally ac-
cepted extended models have not yet emerged. Rather, the 
models can be seen as individual attempts to adapt the tradi-
tional acceptance models to the scope of the particular study. 
Koutromanos and Mikropoulos [42] developed a Mobile 
Augmented Reality Acceptance Model (MARAM) based on 
factors to explain teachers’ intention to use educational AR 
applications.  
 
 
 
Figure 7. Mobile AR Acceptance Model (MARAM) [42]. 
 
In this proposed model, as shown in Figure 7, the ac-
ceptance variables introduced for model extension are Per-
ceived Relative Advantage (PRA) and Mobile Self-Efficacy. 
PRA refers to the perception of the user whether the MAR 
Application is seen as better than conventional methods in 
education. Mobile Self-Efficacy regards the ability to use a 
mobile device. In addition, existing variables from the TAM 
variants, such as Perceived Enjoyment and Facilitating con-
ditions, are applied next to the core variables of the TAM. 
 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
As a result of this literature review, it should first be noted 
that technology adaptation research in the field of AR is still 
a very young research field, with relatively few research pa-
pers published. Only 45 research articles with specified re-
search models on technology acceptance of AR could be 
identified. Training and education was the most frequent area 
of application with 22 articles. With a close look at this field 
of application, it becomes clear that the papers primarily fo-
cus on the field of academic teaching. In comparison, educa-
tional applications outside schools and academics, e.g., using 
AR for training in companies or in industrial environments, 
show a lack of research. 
Concerning the research method, it can be stated that in 
most cases, quantitative research (parts) were found. Regard-
ing the regions of research, most research activities can be 
located in Asia as well as Europe. Looking at the research 
methods, it shows that Structure Equation Modelling (SEM), 
regression and correlation Analysis are the most commonly 
24

used methods for statistical analysis in acceptance research 
examined. 
The research models and their extensions have been the 
focus of this study. The results show that the TAM and its 
core variables are the most frequently used models and theo-
retical foundation. Almost all research articles are based on 
the TAM or its extensions. In addition, the UTAUT and its 
extension can be stated ad well. Three-quarters of all investi-
gated 45 papers on AR acceptance research with a specified 
model have made a model extension integrating own varia-
bles. In total, 34 AR variables not included in any existing 
acceptance model and its model variants have been identified. 
Despite the large number of variables, only a few relate spe-
cifically to the technology AR or the application field of 
training and education. 
This study initially focused on the identification of the rel-
evant papers on AR acceptance research and the variables for 
a model extension. The empirical significance of these varia-
bles as influencing factors and their importance in explaining 
AR acceptance need to be addressed in further research. 
However, an analysis is only possible for those studies that 
disclose relevant information on the corresponding statistical 
analysis. 
It can be seen as problematic that researchers seem to focus 
on producing new models with their own and unique ex-
tended acceptance variables instead of contributing to the em-
pirical validation of existing ones. Many of the specific vari-
ables found in our analysis are only applied by individual re-
searchers. Thus, there is no generalizable AR technology ac-
ceptance model that has yet been sufficiently empirically val-
idated in different application areas. Existing specialized AR 
research models, such as MARAM, should be validated more 
comprehensively for application in other contexts. Moreover, 
there is a particular lack of models that reflect application 
conditions in the field of corporate training outside schools 
and academic institutions.
