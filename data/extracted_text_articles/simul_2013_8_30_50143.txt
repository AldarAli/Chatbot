Abstract—This article presents the results from a simulation 
work regarding the analysis of energy balance of an positive 
energy building. To meet the criteria for an energy-positive 
house, a high priority was given to the performance of the 
thermal envelope, such as high insulation of walls, roofs, floors 
and windows, thermal bridge-free construction and air 
tightness. Due to the required air tightness, special attention 
was also paid to indoor air quality through proper ventilation. 
We have simulated the building and the heating/cooling system 
which in our case is a water source heat pump connected with 
U-pipes vertical boreholes. With the geothermal system, along 
with solar thermal system used to produce the domestic hot 
water demand and along with the photovoltaic-PV system we 
managed to obtain a positive energy construction. The multi-
source system is simulated with multiple specialized software. 
The installed PV system produces 5379 kWh/year while the 
energy consumption of the house is 4856 kWh/year. During 
summer, in order to avoid overheating a set point of 27oC was 
considered. For the entire simulation year, the interior 
temperature in all the zones was between 19oC and 27oC. This 
article presents the modeling and simulation of the multi-
source systems and illustrates interesting insights about the 
right measures to obtain a high energy efficient house with 
optimum indoor comfort.  
Keywords-positive energy house; dynamic simulations; multi-
source system. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
European Union (EU) has agreed a forward-looking 
political agenda to achieve its core energy objectives of 
sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply, by 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, by increasing 
the share of renewable in the energy consumption to 20% 
and improving energy efficiency; all these, by 2020 [1]. 
The energy spent to heat the occupied spaces in the 
residential sector represents more than 40% from the total 
energy demand [2], which includes electricity, hot-water and 
air-conditioning. In this area, a major energy reduction can 
be achieved if a building is correctly designed by engineers 
and architects, and even more if, renewable energy systems 
are integrated to the construction. Installing multiple 
renewable sources on the same site is even more appealing 
when substantial energy savings could be made if the 
advantages of each source are associated. In the near future, 
more and more the renewable energy sources will cohabit 
with fossil energy source systems and research has to be 
pointed towards solutions that are energy efficiently, 
economical viable and environmental friendly. The goal of a 
multi-source system is to decrease at maximum the primary 
energy consumption by generating the needed demand by 
renewable sources like solar, wind or wood energy. The use 
of several sources on the same construction site will be 
applied for new, but also for buildings which, are on the way 
to be renovated. Coupling a heating system with a renewable 
energy system along with a multi-criteria decision analysis 
was realized by Catalina et al. [2]. The benefits of such a use 
is that the constructions can be closer to Zero Energy 
Buildings (ZEB) or even positive energy buildings since 
only by means of a multi-energy system we can arrive to 
such ambitious purpose. The renewable energy systems will 
produce locally the energy needed for the building and the 
extra energy, which is not necessary, will be sent to the 
overall urban energy infrastructure (i.e., the case of 
photovoltaic power energy or wind energy).  A comparison 
of different ZEB in terms of thermal behavior was studied by 
Nazif and Altan [3]. The use of a ground to air heat 
exchanger for energy efficient houses in South of Europe 
was found to be an attracting solution in order to achieve a 
ZEB [4]. Compared to the other studies, in this article, a new 
multi-source system along with the design parameters to be 
taken into consideration for the envelope is presented. 
Moreover, if most of the studies are focused only on how to 
reduce the energy consumption, we found that first of all a 
building should provide a healthy and comfortable 
environment for the occupants. With this project it is showed 
that is possible to achieve a ZEB with a good comfort for the 
occupants. This is also the main advantage of the proposed 
system and approach. The structure of the article is divided 
several sections that are meant to present the study case 
building, 
the 
HVAC 
(Heating, 
Ventilation, 
Air-
Conditioning) system, the results of the simulations and 
finally, the conclusions. During the next chapter we will 
present the building design of the study case, along with 
thermal modeling. Afterwards, it is shown the modeling of 
the HVAC system. At the end of the article are illustrated the 
results and the corresponding conclusions.

BUILDING DESIGN 
The house selected for the study is located in Chambery, 
France. It is a detached two storey building and it is occupied 
all year long, with a difference between weekdays and 
weekends. The architectural plan of the building is illustrated

in Fig. 1. By its shape and space configuration, the house has 
to achieve, besides comfort and regular architectural image, 
the premises of an energy-positive house. Based on 
efficiency concept, the house is wrapped with a „thick skin”, 
to allow an efficient thermal insulation and to have 
neglectable heat losses from thermal bridges. The envelope 
of the house will be plastered with the same material, in 
order to ensure air tightness.  
A key factor in this house is the relation with the solar 
radiation, captured both directly (windows) and indirectly 
(solar collectors). Large windows are mainly oriented south, 
increasing the useful solar gains during winter and using 
efficiently the natural light during the year. Furthermore, the 
main areas are oriented south, east and west, while the small 
areas are oriented north side. 
The house presents highly insulated facades and roof; in 
addition, the triple-glazed windows, with specially insulated 
frames, are based on a 6 chamber system, that keeps out 
draughts, dust and water. The total window U-value is 0,73 
W/m2K.  The other elements of the house are presented in 
Table I.

The building has been introduced and modulated in 
TRNBuild, a component of TRNSYS 16 program [2]. The 
TRNBuild module allows users to define a number of 
building parameters including the orientation, envelope 
construction, glazing and infiltration rate. Once the building 
has been fully defined, it can be imported into the Simulation 
Studio to be linked with the weather file and HVAC system. 
We have used for the building the Type 56 component, a 
detailed multi-zone building model. This component models 
the thermal behavior of a building divided into different 
thermal zones. 
 
Figure 1.  First floor plan of the energy positive house 
The thermal zones are very important if we want to 
simulate the energy consumption of the building. These 
zones can include a room or several rooms that may have 
similar heat gains, similar profiles (temperature, occupancy, 
etc.) or they are provided by the same HVAC system. In our 
case, the house was divided in 10 different zones, presented 
in Table II.

The heat gains for people are very important and must be 
considered in the energy balance. They have a great 
influence on the energy consumption and the overheating of 
the rooms during the summer season. Occupancy profiles 
were created specific to each area and divided into periods of 
the week (weekdays and weekends). The power dissipation 
of a person is estimated to 100 W (60 W sensible heat and 40 
W latent heat) for casual activities and the percentage of heat 
gains by convection and radiation to 33% radiation and 67% 
convection [3]. The artificial lighting is not constant and 
doesn’t depend necessarily on the occupied area. The 
following control strategy was used: the lighting is on if 
horizontal solar radiation <120 W/m2 and off if >200 W/m2, 
taking into account the occupied area.  
There is no need to heat the entire building day and night 
at 19oC, while the rooms are empty during the day and some 
areas are empty during the night. If the house is not

occupied, the temperature is set to 16oC. During the 
weekend, the temperature profile is linked to the occupancy 
profile in order to provide thermal comfort for every person. 
III. 
HVAC SYSTEM MODELING 
In recent years, the design requirements for the primary 
energy consumption of dwellings has been radically reduced, 
making it difficult, if not impossible, to meet the required 
levels using only a combination of construction measures 
and fossil fuel-based heating systems. This has set in motion 
a transition to alternative energy systems within domestic 
construction. Ventilation systems, heat pump systems and 
solar collector systems form an often-used alternative to 
provide heating and hot water in dwellings as they reduce the 
use of fossil energy sources. 
The house has a ventilation system with built-in heat 
exchanger to recover heat, which can be operated by the 
occupants. There is no room which is not clearly integrated 
into the ventilation concept. The supply air is shared and 
areas with stagnant air do not exist. All living and sleeping 
rooms are planned as supply air zones, while the exhaust air 
rooms are the kitchen, storeroom and bathroom. The hallway 
and staircase act as overflow zones. The system is located in 
the building services room under the roof; supply and 
exhaust air are extracted or blown out directly above the 
roof. 
A compact solution that combines the ventilation system 
and the space heating provides better efficiency and 
opportunities for different system solutions that can be 
adapted to different conditions and applications. The solution 
consists in linking a GSHP (Ground Source Heat Pump) to 
the heat recovery unit (see Fig. 2). A piping loop is buried in 
the ground, which is considerably warmer than the outdoor 
air in the winter. Water is circulated through the loops and 
into the building where the heat pump removes the heat from 
the water and delivers it to the air. The heat pump covers the 
whole heating demand with forced air heating, due to its 
distribution system, which transfers heat to the building. The 
process is reversed in cooling. Heat is removed from the 
inside air and delivered it to the water loop which rejects this 
heat to the ground. The GSHP also provides high cooling 
efficiency since the ground is much cooler than the air during 
the summer [4-8].  
 
 
Figure 2.  Ground source heat pump for heating/cooling 
The production of domestic hot water is ensured by a 
thermal solar system, which provides heat through a solar 
collector. The collector transfers the heat to a storage tank, 
which is connected with an internal heat exchanger and a 
thermostatic valve for DHW (Domestic Hot Water) 
temperature control (see Fig 3). The STC (Solar Thermal 
Collector) is operating in series with the storage tank, which 
allows for an improvement in collector efficiencies due to 
the lower temperature fluid entering the collector. An 
efficient control strategy is implemented to regulate the 
system. The indoor temperature of the house is regulated by 
a thermostat, which controls the fan speed in the space 
heating circuit. Based on the temperature difference, the 
thermostat switches on/off or remains in its current state. The 
humidity control in the house is ensured by the GSHP’s 
controller, which dehumidifies the space at reduced cooling 
capacity. The circulation pump in the solar circuit is 
controlled based on the temperature difference between the 
upper side of the STC and the bottom of the hot water tank. 
If the temperature difference is greater than (5-8)⁰C, the 
pump is switched on, but when the difference is (1-3)⁰C, the 
pump is switched off, due to the lack of heat that can be 
transferred to the tank. This difference can not drop below 
1⁰C, because the risk of cooling the tank will appear. The 
thermostat located in the upper area of the tank protects the 
equipment from temperatures higher than 90⁰C. Otherwise, 
the pump is switched off and, for example, the pressure relief 
valve will be on. The production of on-site energy is ensured 
by a photovoltaic system. An analysis by numerical 
simulations of a system of photovoltaic modules is intended, 
in order to assess its potential to cover the electricity 
consumption of the house. The photovoltaic system was 
designed and analyzed with the PVSyst V6.0 program [12].

For the modeling and simulation of the entire system it 
was necessary the introduction of multiple parameters.  The 
heat recovery has a sensible effectiveness of 0.95 and a 
power consumption of 500W. The heat pump is a water 
source based and provides a maximum air flow of 1250 m3/h

RESULTS 
For an appropriate analysis of the system, a dynamic 
simulation is necessary. The numerical simulation is made 
throughout the year, for 8760 hours. The thermal comfort is 
acquired for the entire occupational period as the air 
temperature, during winter time, is not passing below 19oC 
and during summer period is always lower than 27oC. Fig. 4 
illustrates the air temperature for the thermal zones 1 to  8. 
Zone 1 has higher temperatures, up to 22oC because in that 
zone we have the highest internal heat gains (kitchen, 
occupants, and other appliances).  Zone 2 and Zone 3 with 
the lowest temperatures, close to 19oC represent the Entrance 
hall and the storage room.  It can be concluded that the 
HVAC system is well designed and the indoor environment 
is comfortable.  
 
Figure 4.  Air temperature during the coldest day of the year 
The heat pump transfers to the introduced air a certain 
amount of energy, when it is needed. Figure 4 shows the 
total heat transfer to air and the heating controller during the 
coldest week of the year. The maximum value is around 
5500 W and the lowest air temperatures are -12oC. As it can 
be noticed from Fig. 5, the functioning hours are low 
because of the high level of insulation of the house and of 
the internal heat gains that covers most of the heating 
demand.

Figure 5.  GSHP functioning during the coldest week of the year 
As concerns the cooling energy demand, during the warmest 
week of the year the heat pump transfers to the introduced 
air around 7000 W (see Fig. 6). This energy is required to 
avoid the overheating of the zones. Compared to the winter 
situation, it can be clearly noticed that the functioning hours 
of the GSHP are more. The reason for that is because the 
solar radiation heat gains and internal heat gains have high 
values.  Moreover, the outdoor air temperatures during the 
summer period are around 35oC.

Figure 7.  GSHP power consumption during the coldest/warmest week 
The power consumption of the heat pump is important for 
an energy efficient building. From Fig. 7, it can be noticed 
that during the winter/summer period the maximum needed 
energy is 1200 W. This energy consumption comprises the 
compressor, the controller and the blower. For the entire 
year period we have a consumption of 1853 kWh.  
 
 
Figure 8.  Energy balance of the DHW solar production 
     The DHW energetic demand is 3932 kWh/year. As it can 
be observed in Fig. 8, the largest amount of energy from 
solar contribution is provided during May, when the value 
of 250 kWh/month is exceeded. The lowest amounts of 
solar contribution are during the months when outdoor 
temperatures and solar radiation intensity have lower values. 
The solar energy is not enough to cover the DHW energetic 
demand; therefore an auxiliary heating device is necessary. 
The auxiliary contribution covers entirely the demand and 
the value is 1833 kWh.  
     As concerns the photovoltaic system this one is oriented 
south and is located on the roof of the house. The panels are 
polycrystalline silicon cells, for the best performance. The 
input data are: tilting angle: 30o; Azimuth: 0o; Number of 
PV modules: 17; The module power: 0.255 kWp, The total 
PV system power: 6 kWp; Module type: Polycrystalline; 
Modules efficiency: 15.7%. The energy produced by the PV 
system is 5266 kWh. The necessary energy for the 
appliances is estimated at 2.66 kWh/day = 971 kWh/year 
and the electrical lighting at 200 kWh/year. The energy 
balance of the house is positive because we have 1853 kWh 
(Heat pump) + 1833 kWh (Auxiliary heating DHW) + 970 
kWh (Appliances) + 200 kWh (Electrical lighting) = 4856 
kWh (Total consumption) and the produced energy is 
5372.9 kWh. 
 
 
Figure 9.  Energy production of the PV system and energy consumption 
The maximum energy consumption is found in June with 
580 kWh, while the maximum production is July with 685 
kWh (see Fig. 9).

CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, we analyzed a single family house and the 
possibility to obtain an energy positive balance. Using a 
ground source heat pump the indoor comfort conditions 
were reached while the energy consumption had low values. 
A solar thermal system coupled with an auxiliary heating 
system produced the domestic hot water demand of the four 
occupants. An energy positive house would not have been 
possible without the use of photovoltaic panels that is why 
17 modules of 0.255 kWhp/module were installed. With this 
amount of PV panels the energy production was of 5372.9 
kWh over passing the energy consumption by 516.9 kWh. It 
is concluded that the proposed multi-source system was 
correctly designed and that the simulations were the perfect 
way to analyze the house and the HVAC system.
