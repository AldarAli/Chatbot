Abstract—In the last years, the risk to become a victim of a gun 
fight or to be involved into an amok situation increased. This 
leads to a higher demand for ballistic protection of civilians. 
Therefore, another capability profile for ballistic armor is 
necessary, compared to the military or police sector. The focal 
point of civil ballistic armor is wearing comfort, weight and 
invisibility. This paper provides information about the 
development of flexible and lightweight ballistic body armor. 
The manufacturing process is showed, heat- and sag test are 
presented, and first ballistic trials will be discussed below. The 
aim of the project is to create a ballistic body armor, which is 
flexible, and body fit enough to be worn under a sweater or 
suit. Furthermore, the body armor should meet the fourth level 
of ballistic protection of the "Association of test laboratories 
for bullet resistant materials and constructions" (VPAM 4). 
The idea can be realized by using an ultra-high molecular 
weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) composite. A material with 
well-balanced properties to fulfill the ballistic and mechanical 
requirements.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Personal integrity is a basic need. Nowadays, this need is 
endangered by increased incidents relating to gun violence. 
Especially in the USA, the number of incidents rises from 
about 50,000 to over 60,000 between 2014 and 2017 [1]. 
This leads to a higher need for personal ballistic protection 
at the civilian markets. Included are products like soft-
ballistic sweater inlays or discrete ballistic vest, which are 
suitable for everyday life. In this area of use weight, 
wearing comfort and invisibility are focal points. The 
ballistic protection up to the fourth level of ballistic 
protection of the "Association of test laboratories for bullet 
resistant materials and constructions" (VPAM 4) has to be 
ensured. These requirements make it necessary to use a 
material, which combines high tensile strength for a high 
ballistic performance and low density for a suitable weight 
balance. These attributes are combined in many fiber 
reinforced 
composite 
materials, 
especially 
ultra-high 
molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is well suited 
for the mentioned application. Already existing analyses of 
the ballistic behavior of UHMWPE, like in [2] or [3] 
described, are often on a theoretical level. This paper aims 
for an analysis on an applied level, with a concrete 
connection to a product development. Existing theoretical 
results are applied to the development of an actual ballistic 
vest. This leads to the overall aim of the project to create a 
flexible and lightweight ballistic vest, which meet the 
VPAM 4 regulations and can be worn under everyday 
clothes. Therefore, the project is divided into five sections: 
1. Material processing  
(Section IV); 
2. Material pre-testing  
(Section V); 
3. Pre-ballistic testing  
(Section VI); 
4. Ballistic testing   
(future work); 
5. Finalization 
  
(future work). 
This paper aims to provide data to derive a decision about 
the material composition, which is used for the future work. 
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, 
preliminary 
considerations 
are 
introduced 
regarding 
material, processing and shape of the test objects. Section III 
gives a brief information about the used UHMWPE prepreg 
material and the second matrix material. Section IV is about 
the processing of ballistic plates namely cutting and 
lamination process. In Section V, heat resistance test and 
sag test are presented and discussed. In Section VI, the pre-
ballistic test, which includes VPAM 3 (third level of 
ballistic protection of the "Association of test laboratories 
for bullet resistant materials and constructions") and VPAM 
4 testing, is described and evaluated. The final section, 
Section VII, merge all results and, these results are 
discussed, leading to the constructive design of the plates. 
II. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS 
In the beginning of the project two questions occur: 
• 
Which material is suitable for the project (ballistic 
performance and weight)? 
• 
How can it be processed to become a flexible 
ballistic plate?  
First thoughts about the material leads to the UHMWPE in 
detail Dyneema® HB26. This material, in shape of hard-
ballistic-plates, was successfully tested in previous ballistic 
trails. The plates were made out of multiple layer of pre-
impregnated fiber (prepreg) material, which are fused under 
a certain pressure and temperature to become a solid 
ballistic plate. These ballistic trails have already been 
reported in [3].

This type of Dyneema® HB26 plates have an inflexible 
structure, making them unsuitable for this project of soft-
ballistic-plates. On the other hand, the material shows a 
good ratio between weight and ballistic performance. In 
detail, areal density of the material is between 257 – 271 
g/m² [3] and has an energy absorption per areal density of 
~35 J∙m2/kg [3]. In Section IIIA the mechanical properties 
of the material are explained in detail to enhance the 
awareness for the material.  
Relating to the second initial question, Dyneema® 
HB26 provides a promising starting point, because this basic 
prepreg already offers a flexible structure. Therefore, the 
prepreg material only needs a second flexible matrix 
material to hold the prepreg layers together. Due to this, a 
lamination process by hand is selected, which makes it 
possible to use a flexible cast resin. This leads to the 
question, which kind of cast resin has to be used as a second 
matrix material. It has to be considered, that, firstly, the cast 
resin does not destroy the chemical basic structure of the 
prepreg material and secondly, the cast resin remains 
flexible. To ensure this chemical compatibility of the second 
matrix material the same matrix material, like it is used for 
the prepreg, is chosen. For that reason, a polyurethane 
(PUR) determines the second matrix material. This is 
selected out of the group of thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) 
[4]. Under the aspect of flexibility, a cast resin out of PUR 
with special flexible properties is chosen. A further 
description of the second matrix material is given in Section 
IIIB. 
Beside the material, also the shape of the plates is 
important for the ballistic performance. This is, because of 
the anisotropic properties, which are described in Section 
IIIA. In this case, the shape was predetermined, because the 
plates have to fit into already existing structures.

Relating to the standard size of a plate carrier inlay, plates 
were produced in a size of 300 mm x 250 mm. Furthermore, 
patterns for a sweatshirt inlay were used to evaluate the 
behavior of the different shapes in a ballistic trail. The main 
body pattern has a width of 435 mm and a total height of 
415 mm (Figure 1). The side body pattern is narrower and 
has a width of 150 mm and a height of 205 mm (Figure 2). 
III. USED MATERIALS 
The basic material for the development of the flexible 
plates is Dyneema® HB26. It is shipped in a shape of a tape 
and as such, the matrix and fiber have already combined to a 
prepreg. The fiber is out of UHMWPE and the matrix out of 
PUR. As mentioned in Section II, the second matrix 
material is a flexible PUR. 
A. Dyneema® HB26 
The prepreg material consists of four sublayers of 
UHMWPE fibers, which are bidirectional orientated. The 
fiber direction per sublayer is turned by 90°, compared with 
the previous layer. This achieves an equal force dissipation 
in the prepreg material. Resulting from this structure, 
different geometric shapes of the material have anisotropic 
tensile properties, because of unequal fiber length.  
The prepreg material has a density of 0.97 g/cm3. 
UHMWPE fibers have a high molecular weight. Commonly 
they have an Intrinsic Viscosity (IV) from 8 IV up to 30 IV. 
The fiber achieves high tensile strength (between 3.21 GPa 
and 5.99 GPa) and initial modulus (between 113GPa and 
171 GPa) through long molecular chains out of methylene 
groups (CH2). A characteristic of UHMWPE is, that the 
intra molecular bounds are relative weak Van der Waals 
bounds. Though, the extreme long molecule chains leading 
to a significant overlap between the molecule chains. This 
results in many inter molecular Van der Waals bounds, 
which strengthen the overall intermolecular stability. 
Further developments have to consider, that the fiber length 
is one of the most important constructional attributes, 
because of the link to the tensile strength of the material [5]. 
The matrix material of the prepreg has multiple tasks. 
Firstly, to protect the fiber against environmental conditions, 
47

pressure and kinks. Secondly, to hold the fibers in their 
position and direction. Finally, the matrix leads the forces 
into the fibers. Matrix material is often chosen from the 
group of thermoplastic elastomers, because of moldability 
and high elongation at break. These are good properties to 
support the fibers and the construction.  
B. Cast Resin System - Second Matrix Material 
The most important requirement for second matrix 
material is to preserve the flexibility of the prepreg. 
Therefore, the second matrix material has also to be flexible. 
As mentioned in Section II, the flexible PUR called R15GB-
flex was selected. This material is a two-components cast 
resin system, consisting out of resin and hardener. With a 
mixing ratio of 100 parts resin and 25 parts hardener a Shore 
hardness (A) of ~40 is achievable. Compared with normal 
PUR cast resin systems, which have a Shore hardness (D) of 
~65 (comparable to a Shore hardness (A) of ~105), the used 
PUR has a softer texture [6]. Another important property is 
the density of the second matrix material to keep a low 
overall weight. The material R15GB-flex has a density of 
1.1 g/cm3, comparable with the density of the prepreg 
material. The material has in mixed condition a medium 
viscosity and a processing time of approximately 15 min 
(100 g at 20 °C). These properties make the material 
suitable for the lamination process by hand. The maximum 
usage temperature is around 50 °C [5]. This fact will further 
be discussed in Section V. 
IV. PROCESSING 
The processing of the ballistic plates is divided into two 
stages: 
• 
Cutting process for semi-finished parts;  
• 
Lamination process for the finished composite 
material. 
A. Cutting Process 
This project stage needs two patterns. First of all, the 
standard plate carrier inlay with rectangular, plane shape 
and dimensions of 300 mm x 250 mm. For the testing 
procedures one 5-layer, two 10-layer, one 15-layer and two 
20-layer plates are produced (Table 1). Overall, 80 layers of 
prepreg material in this shape are necessary. 
Furthermore, patterns for a sweatshirt inlay, with a main 
body part (Figure 1) and side part (Figure 2) are used. On 
the whole, 30 main body part layers and 15 side part layers 
are produced (Table I). 
The lamination process by hand makes it necessary to 
laminate every single layer. In this particular case, a fast-
laser-cutting-process is unsuitable, because the individual 
layers would melt together. A single layer cut with the laser 
cutter is as well inefficient, due to the rectangular shape. For 
that reason, every layer has to be cut out by a special scissor 
for reinforced fibers. 
To achieve a high precision, the more complex shapes of 
the sweatshirt patterns are cut by the laser. The patterns are 
replicated in a computer-aided design (CAD) program and 
saved as drawing exchange format (DXF) file. Lastly, the 
file is exported into the laser cutter program and executed 
(parameters: Power 120 W, frequency 1000 Hz, velocity 
0.036 m/s). Due to the four-sublayer structure of the prepreg 
material, a homogeneous sublayer structure is achievable 
even without rotation between the prepreg layers. 
B. Lamination Process 
The hand lamination process requires following stages:  
• 
Mixing; 
• 
Coating; 
• 
Hardening process. 
In the mixing process, the mixing ratio is adjusted by the 
proportion of weight. For a low Shore hardness (A) the 
manufacturer recommends a mixing ratio of 100 parts resin 
and 25 parts hardener. Proportion of weight of the two 
components, which is necessary for the different plate sizes, 
are shown in Table II. The two components are mixed with 
a wooden stick to a homogenous mixture. 
This mixture is equal spread over the prepreg layer with 
a lamination brush. For the coating, a slight film is 
sufficient. Pressure from the inside to the outside is applied 
to get a compact compound. 
Finally, surplus material is removed, and the plates are 
laid into a warm place for 24 h for hardening. After the 
hardening process, the plates are inherently stable. 
V. HEAT AND SAG TEST 
Besides the ballistic performance, further two primary 
material attributes of the new composite material have to be 
tested. Firstly, the heat stability in a heat test, because of 
possible high surface temperatures in area of use. Secondly, 
the flexibility of the material, as key functionality in a sag 
test. 
A. Heat Test 
Heat is a weak point of the second matrix material, due 
to its thermoplastic properties. Maximum temperature of 
usage is around 50 °C according to the manufacturer. 
Analyses of the possible area of use show, that the average 
temperatures are moderate temperatures between 10 °C and 
30 °C, which are unproblematic for the composite material. 
Nevertheless, in desert areas, which are possible areas of 
use, surface temperatures can reach a maximum around 70 
°C and daily surface temperatures around 60 °C [7]. To test 
the heat resistance of the composite material, one plate is 
faced a heat test.

The heat test proceeds as follows: an oven is preheated 
to a temperature of 30 °C. This 30 °C stage is used as a 
reference result. Every 30 min the temperature is set to a 
new value, first 50 °C, then 60 °C and finally 70 °C. The 
plate is left in the oven for 30 min. After 15 min and 30 min 
the plate is taken out and checked regarding: degeneration, 
flexibility, slip of layers and defects. A 5-layer plate (Plate 
No. 6) is chosen to ensure an even temperature distribution 
in material. Results are displayed in Table III. 
The results show that the composite material, and 
especially 
the 
second 
matrix 
material 
withstand 
temperatures up to 50 °C without any property changes. At 
higher temperatures above 50 °C an increased flexibility is 
recognizable. After 30 min at 70 °C the layers of prepreg are 
movable 3 mm against each other. After this movement, the 
layers go back to their initial state. At all temperature stages 
the plate shows no degeneration and defects. Following a 
cooling phase, the second matrix material solidified again. 
Summing up, the higher temperatures are uncritical to the 
composite material.

B. Sag Test  
Flexibility is a key attribute of the used type of ballistic 
protection. Comparative values of the plate flexibility can be 
generated through a sag test. The aim of this test is to 
measure the sag of the plate under a certain load. 
Therefore, a test procedure is created. The test setup is 
shown in Figure 3. The plates are laid onto two bars with a 
contact area of 10 mm x 250 mm on both sides. Moreover, 
the basic test setup consists of two rulers and a wooden 
baseplate (35 mm x 145mm), which are arranged as in 
Figure 3 shown. The sag test was conducted at 22 °C. 
As a result of this arrangement, a basic load of 72.8 g lays 
up on the plate. Additionally, a 500 g block is used as a test 
weight. The center of the wooden baseplate is positioned in 
the middle of the plate at 150 mm x 125 mm. One ruler is 
placed for measurements and the other as an indicator for it. 
The zero height is 120 mm. 
First, the initial height of the plate is measured. In this 
phase the plate has an additional load of 72.8 g. After 30 sec 
under these conditions, the height is measured.

Subsequently, the plate is loaded with test weight. After 
10 sec under these conditions, the height is measured again. 
Results are displayed in Table IV. The results show that 20-
layer plates have deficits in their sag values and thus in the 
overall flexibility. They may be too inflexible for this 
particular application area. The 15-layer plate has a good 
ratio between number of layers and flexibility, compared 
with the 10-layer plate.  
VI. BALLISTIC TEST 
The ballistic test is performed on the basis of the VPAM 
("Association of test laboratories for bullet resistant 
materials 
and 
constructions") 
regulations. 
Especially 
following regulations are regarded: general basis for 
ballistic material, construction and product testing (APR) 
[8], ballistic protective vests (BSW) [9] and bullet resistant 
plate materials (PM) [10]. 
The aim of this project is to meet the regulations of 
VPAM 4. This level requires, that the plate withstand a 
penetration of a .357 Mag. fired with a projectile velocity of 
430 ± 10 m/s from 5 m distance [8]. A ballistic placement 
test provides an overview of the ballistic performance of the 
composite material. Therefore, a modified VPAM 3 (9 mm, 
415 ± 10 m/s, 5m) and VPAM 4 level is tested. The 
shooting distance is increased to 10 m. Penetration and back 
face deformation are evaluated. Based on VPAM BSW No. 
4.2 a maximal transmitted energy of 70 J is acceptable. 
A. Preparation and Test Setup 
Two components are necessary for the test setup: 
shooting-box and plasticine (Figure 4). The shooting box is 
built in consideration of the VPAM BSW [9]. The inner 
dimensions of the shooting-box are 300 mm width, 250 mm 
height and 150 mm depth. Especially the characteristic 
depth is important, because of compression effects with the 
rear panel. Based on the VPAM PM contact areas of 30 mm 
on three sides are built in [9]. The used plasticine is 
recommended by VPAM (VPAM BSW No. 5.2) [9]. The 
ballistic test is conducted at an ambient temperature of 21 
°C. 
A measurement of the plasticity is conducted as 
described in VPAM BSW No. 5.2.1. The mean imprint 
depth (dm) of the plasticine is 19.8 mm. With this value and 
the maximal transmitted energy (Emax) of 70 J, the maximal 
volume (Vmax) of the back-face deformation is calculated as 
follows [8]: 
 
Vmax = (0.134 ∙  dm −  1.13) ∙  Emax 
() 
 
Vmax = (0.134 ∙ 19.8 − 1.13) ∙ 70 = 106.624  
() 
 
Figure 4. Shooting-box filled with plasticine. Inner dimensions: 250 mm x 
300 mm x 15 mm. 
 
Figure 5. Left side: .357 Mag 158 Gr. Right side: 9 mm Luger 124 Gr. 
This leads to a maximal back face deformation volume 
of 106.624 cm3. 
The gun, which is used for VPAM 3 testing is a SIG 
Sauer X-Five® with a 9 mm Luger 124 Gr. projectile. For 
the VPAM 4 testing an S&W 686 European Match® with a 
.357 Mag 158 Gr. projectile is used (Figure 5). 
All shots are fired into the middle of the plates. The only 
exception is test number 5R, which get shot into the edge 
area. This edge shot has to hit the material in a distance of 
30 ± 5 mm from an edge [9]. Test number 8 and 9 were shot 
without the shooting-box to check the penetration level of 
the loose layers. 
B. Evaluation 
After every shot the diameter and the depth of the 
imprint of the back-face deformation is measured (Table V). 
With these values, and the volume equation of a circular 
cone the volume of the back-face deformation (V) is 
calculated. Additionally, the transmitted energy (E) is 
calculated backwards with following equation [8]: 
 
E = V (0.134 ∙  dm  −  1.13).

Figure 6. Test number 3 after the shot. Seeable is the back-face deformation 
and material behavior.  
The results show, that test number 1, 3, 4, 5M, and 7 
meet the requirement, that the transmitted energy is lower 
than 70 J. Especially test number three (15 layers) (Figure 6) 
shows a good average transmitted energy, comparing to test 
number 1 (10-layers) and 5M (20 layers). 
Test number 5R failed, because the projectile left the 
plate before it gets stuck in the plate. As expected, test 
number 2 got penetrated by the .357 Mag projectile. This 
test was conducted to see the penetration behavior of the 
material and projectile, like layer and projectile movement, 
deformation of the projectile and damage to the plate. At 
test number 8 and nine the projectile got stuck in the fourth 
layer of the loose layers. The back-face deformation of these 
test numbers is negligible. 
VII. 
DISCUSSION 
The heat-resistance-test shows, that the composite plates 
are durable up to 70 °C. At higher temperatures a slip of 
layers is highly possible. Up to 60 °C no degeneration or 
melting is detectable (Table III). Thus, the second matrix 
material and main material are suitable for the estimated 
conditions. 
To examine the flexibility, a sag test is conducted. It 
shows, that 20-layer plates are too stiff for this area of use. 
10- and 15-layers plates show good values of flexibility and 
weight compared to other soft ballistic plates (Table IV).  
The ballistic plate has to meet the requirements of 
VPAM 3 and VPAM 4. This requirement allows a maximal 
transmitted energy of 70 J. In a first placement test all 
expected plates meets this requirement by far (Table V). 
Also, the sweatshirt inlays were tested successfully. It 
seems, that the extensive shape, which leads to longer 
fibers, increases the ballistic performance.  
To summarize, the 15-layer plate is the best performing 
plate, because of the ratio between flexibility, weight and 
ballistic performance. 10-layer plates will not meet the 
VPAM 4 regulations, and 20-layer plates are too stiff and 
heavy for the area of use. These results will put the 15-layer 
plate into the focus of the studies. It has to be considered, 
that these ballistic results are from a pre-testing series. They 
are just indicators for a relative rating between our ballistic 
plats. In further ballistic tests they have to be verified for the 
VPAM 4 level.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
All in all, the aim of this project is to create lightweight 
and flexible ballistic body armor for the civilian market.  
Therefore, a UHMWPE prepreg as main material and a two- 
component flexible resin as second matrix material is used. 
Through a lamination by hand procedure, ballistic 
composite plates are produced. Because of this method, the 
flexible properties of the main material are sustained. 
Moreover, a temperature resistance of the composite 
material up to 60 °C is identified. All conducted 
experiments show, that the 15-layer plate full fill our 
expectations best. Especially, the ballistic results of this 
plate are promising. Furthermore, compared to other 
available products on the market, the new plate has a 
reduced weight of ~100 g, is 1.2 mm slimmer and full 
flexible.  
In further scientific work, the 15-layer plate will be 
extensive ballistic tested. Especially, VPAM 4 testing will

be focused. Greater effort will be spent into ballistic testing 
of the sweatshirt patterns and analyses of size-effects. 
Therefore, these special shaped plates will be also produced 
with the lamination process by hand and ballistic tested. 
Furthermore, new available prepreg material out of 
UHMWPE, special made for flexible ballistic plates, will be 
tested within following projects.
