Abstract—The implementation of multi-channels at the MAC 
layer has created a new interference problem, the Missing 
Receiver Problem (MRP). The MRP is a multi-channel 
problem which relates to the 
use 
of 
multi-channels 
concurrently. As nodes communicate on different channels, 
they become unreachable and deaf. Bandwidth will be wasted 
when communication is initiated with deaf nodes. The paper 
evaluates the effects of MRP on network performance. The 
bandwidth of one control and two data channels is considered 
in relation to the size of control and data packets. Channel 
switching delay is also factored in the analysis. An analysis of 
channel bandwidth given the size of packets is presented. The 
proposed MRP solution is based on the cyclical scheduling 
algorithm, a proposed framework for solving multi-channel 
interference challenges. The framework is described at length 
and thereafter the analyses and the analytical results are 
discussed. The results show that the effects of the MRP can be 
reduced.

 INTRODUCTION 
Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) can be deployed 
effectively as a community wireless access network. 
However, the capacity of WMN falls short in meeting the 
requirements of time bounded data, largely due to 
interferences, such as the Hidden Terminals, the Exposed 
Terminals and the Terminal Deafness Problem. In general, 
the implementation of multi-channel systems has availed 
more capacity for wireless systems and improved their 
performance. Nevertheless, the above mentioned problems 
still require to be addressed for the increased network 
capacity to be realized. 
WMN are widely touted as the possible future 
community access network offering high speed broadband 
connectivity offer last mile broadband wireless access. They 
overcome the shortcomings of ad hoc networks by 
overlaying or integrating mobile terminals with static nodes. 
The static nodes have high processing power, are more 
energy efficient and do act as a semblance of an 
infrastructure based network. However, more has to be done 
to position WMN as high speed last mile broadband wireless 
network solution. 
One of the proposed directions of research aimed at 
increasing network capacity exploits the availability of the 
multi-channels at the physical layer prompting the need to 
redesign the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols to 
handle multiple channels. In general, the results of the multi-
channel schemes are encouraging [1] [2]. However, multi-
channel interferences, such as the MRP still require attention. 
This paper first presents in detail a proposed Cyclical 
Scheduling Algorithm (CSA), through which the multi-
channel interferences such as the MRP can be addressed. 
The CSA is the multi-channel coordination, scheduling and 
channel selection scheme which transmit data in phases. The 
MAC schedules data transmissions in cycles. It then presents 
the assumptions underpinning the MRP solution. The MRP 
solution is premised on wasted bandwidth, given the ratio of 
control channel dwell on time to the data channel dwell on 
time, when an instance of the MRP is encountered. 
The Missing Receiver Problem is caused by a would-be 
receiver, which is currently busy on a different channel either 
receiving or transmitting or just listening on it, while a 
sender is trying to send packets to it on a different channel. 
The sent packets fail to reach a receiver because the intended 
receiver would be tuned on a different channel. The MRP is 
caused by lack of synchronization between the sender and 
the receiver in multi-channel systems. The lack of 
synchronization of the sender and the receiver wastes 
bandwidth and network resources. 
The need to reduce multi-channel interferences and for 
multi-channel approaches at the MAC layer is discussed in 
Section 2. Section 3 discusses related work. The proposed 
CSA model is presented in Section 4. The impact of the 
MRP on network performance and the analytical results are 
presented in Section 5. Section 6 and Section 7 summarize 
the future work and the proposed model, respectively.

MOTIVATION 
Mesh networks combine the advantages of ad hoc 
networks and infrastructure based networks into one 
community based network. Different access networks can be 
deployed in a community forming an auto configuring, self 
healing and self organizing mesh network. The need and the 
requirements of quality of service and the time bounded data 
can be met by well designed multi-channel mesh networks.

Multi-channel techniques are robust, flexible and do increase 
network capacity. However, the coordination, selection and 
scheduling of multi-channels needs to be explored further. 
The increase in network capacity in multi-channel 
systems comes at the expense of channel switching delay. 
The net effect of trading off channel switching cost with 
network capacity may improve the overall network 
performance.  
The multiple channels are available at the physical layer; 
unfortunately the MAC layer is not designed for multi-
channel systems; while the network layer is optimized for 
multi-channels and is designed to address the shortcomings 
of the MAC layer. The reconfiguration of the MAC will 
therefore, result in the realization of more capacity and 
flexibility. The channel selection, coordination and the 
terminal deafness challenges may be solved at the MAC 
layer for improved network performance.  
We propose a multi-channel cyclical scheduling 
algorithm and present it as a framework for solving multi-
channel interference problems.  The MRP solution which is 
based on the proposed multi-channel framework is then 
presented and evaluated analytically.

RELATED WORK 
Maheshwari et al. [1] reduces the effects of MRP by 
employing a receiver initiated solution. Unfortunately, it 
only alerts transmitters which are in their back off intervals. 
A new collision technique may be required to resolve 
contention of two or more invited transmitters which respond 
to the same invitation simultaneously. Furthermore, the user 
based quiescent channels may lead to network portioning. 
Shi et al. [2] solve the multi-channel interference 
challenge through the synchronization of nodes on the 
control channel. However, synchronization is a challenge for 
mobile nodes.  
Toham and Jan [3] employ a multi-interfaces approach 
and it solves MRP at high overhead cost of hello messages 
which degrade the network performance. It is also expensive 
in terms of hardware requirements. Mo et al. [4] proposed a 
similar multi-interfaces scheme. It also solves the deafness 
problem at high hardware cost. 
Toham and Jan [3] argue that the use of a common 
control channel causes bottleneck. The implementation of a 
common control channel facilitates network connectivity and 
ensures that the network is not partitioned.  
Seo and Ma [5] proposed a synchronous scheme using 
one transceiver. The system broadcast channel releases 
messages, and keeps both a neighbor status list and a channel 
status list.  A significant percentage of bandwidth is lost in 
signaling and synchronization is a challenge. The proposed 
contention window may be too small in backlogged 
environments. 
A CTS packet reserves a channel in [6] and fails to notify 
nodes in the neighborhood of the transmitter. However, the 
use of two transceivers minimizes the effects of missing 
receivers albeit at high cost of hardware.  
Incidents of the missing receiver problem increase due to 
lack of coordination in multi-channel systems. The pair of 
nodes may be on two different channels or one node may 
switch to a different channel thereby becoming unreachable. 
When one node is busy on one channel while a number of 
nodes (at least one) are trying to communicate with it on 
different channels, an unreachable terminal is said to be deaf 
[7]. 
IV. 
THE SYSTEM MODEL  
The proposed CSA framework has four distinct 
components. The framework has the following techniques: 
the channel switching penalty, the Request To Send (RTS) 
based data channel reservation and access scheme, the inter-
cycle, and the phasing of data transmission in cycles. We 
describe each of these four aspects separately and then show 
how they are integrated. The framework employs one 
dedicated control channel and N number of data channels. 
We then show how the envisaged framework reduces the 
effects of MRP.  
The channel switching technique associates all the 
switching costs with the data channels. It considers two 
channel switching penalties. When a transceiver switches to 
and from a given data channel from the control channel it 
incurs two channel switching delays. When the transceiver 
switches to the data channel, it incurs a switching delay of 
224µs (the maximum cost specified by the IEEE 802.11 
standard) and the same duration is also incurred when it 
switches back onto the control channel. The effective 
channel switching delay is therefore set to 448µs to capture 
its double effect on data channels. The value of the switching 
delay is added to the data packet transmission duration.  
Ideally, this will keep a data channel busy for a longer 
duration. However, it improves the performance of the 
control channel and it increases its capacity to drive more 
data channels before it saturates. In general, this approach is 
capable of improving the overall system performance.

In Fig. 1a, we model the conventional approach where 
the next transmitter waits for the channel switching process 
to be performed first before contending for the control 
channel. All the terminals should be on the control channel 
before the next transmission is initiated. This approach 
wastes the capacity of the control channel and increases its 
saturation rate. The capacity of the control channel may be

increased to improve the performance of the network. As 
shown in Fig. 1b, the capacity of the control channel has 
been improved. The control channel can now drive more 
data channels. In the proposed scheme, the data channel is 
reserved when it is about to finish the current transmission. 
As the current communicating pair switch back onto the 
control channel, the next pair switch onto the data channel. 
The terminals will cross each other as they switch to opposite 
directions. This equips the control channel with more 
capacity to support more data channels, which, in essence, 
increases its scheduling capacity and reduces its idleness. It 
should also be noted that there is no need in this case for 
nodes to perform a channel switching prior to control 
channel contention. 
The RTS-based data channel reservation and access 
scheme limit channel contention to the control channel. Two 
terminals intending to exchange data will contend for and 
reserve the control channel. Thereafter, there will not 
exchange packets to negotiate which data channel to reserve. 
The reservation of the data channels will be linked to the 
reservation of the control channel. This is possible in the 
CSA framework given the fact that data transmission is 
scheduled in phases. The control channel is reserved during 
timeslots in which a given data channel is known to be idle. 
The main goal of this scheme is to reduce the contention and 
channel reservation duration and to avail more bandwidth for 
network performance improvement.  
 
 
Figure 2.  The RTS based channel reservation scheme. 
In Fig. 2, the transmitter has to first identify idle data 
channels between time T and T1 and then sends the list to the 
receiver including its preferred data channel at T1. The 
receiver will also upon receiving the RTS packet at time T2, 
check whether the sender’s preferred data channel is also 
free at its end. It may check other data channels in the list if 
the preferred data channel is not available. Thereafter, it will 
send either the confirming or the rejecting CTS back to the 
transmitter [2]. These processes are shown in the top block.  
The bottom block shows the proposed approach where a 
sender does not have to first check whether the preferred data 
channel is indeed idle. The sender only includes one data 
channel in its RTS packet which is known to be idle and the 
receiver would be expected to accept it. The receiver will 
agree with the sender on the preferred data channel without 
having to first sense the medium. The sender chooses a 
preferred data channel without sensing the medium using 
virtual carrier sensing and network support scheme. The 
nodes are, therefore, able to determine when channels would 
be idle without relying on both the physical and the virtual 
carrier sensing mechanisms.  
The implementation of the RTS-based data channel 
reservation assumes that the data channels would be 
available when the sender reserves the control channel. The 
receiver will therefore be expected to agree with the sender 
on the preferred data channel. 
The inter-cycle scheme marks the beginning and the end 
of a given cycle. It defines the shortest duration a data 
channel will be busy before it is available for the next data 
transmission in the next cycle. It is the hold off duration 
which forces all terminals intending to use a given data 
channel to hold off their next transmissions long enough to 
allow data packets to be delivered successfully. In essence 
the inter-cycle is the time when the last control packet was 
received in the previous cycle to the time the next control 
packet is sent in the next cycle. 
The inter-cycle duration is not fixed it varies with the 
number of data channels implemented. It is inversely related 
to the number of data channels. It has the longest duration 
when there are only two data channels and its length 
decreases as more data channels are added.  
 
Figure 3. The Inter-Cycle Scheme. 
Fig. 3 shows the behavior of the inter-cycle duration as 
the number of data channels is increased. The inter-cycle 
duration decreases with the number of data channels. As it 
shrinks, the control channel becomes busier and its capacity 
improves. The control channel can schedule and drive more 
data channels.   
The top row depicts a situation where there are two data 
channels. The control channel will lie idle after performing 
the first handshake of the two data channels until the current 
data transmissions are about to complete. Then the next 
handshake will be performed in the next cycle. The duration 
of the inter-cycle will reduce in the next row when two more 
data channels are added. This behavior will be exhibited by 
the inter-cycle for every additional data channels to been 
added. For the purposes of the analytical work, we assume 
that all the channels are orthogonal to each other. 
Lastly, we describe briefly the cyclical nature of the 
algorithm. This attribute of the algorithm is related to the 
inter-cycle technique.  All the available data channels will be 
accessed in phases through the control channel. When the 
last data channel in the current cycle finishes its 
transmission, the first channel, will be reserved for the first 
transmission in the next cycle. This attribute of the CSA is 
detailed in [8] [9] with accompanying diagrams. 
The following pseudo-code gives an overall picture of 
the entire algorithm with its four components. The pseudo 
code gives the bird’s view of the CSA. It explains the CSA

We now discuss how the framework reduces the effects 
of the MRP. We assume that there are three channels, one 
control and two data channels. In each cycle, two data flows 
are scheduled. Given this assumption, we consider the 
number of terminals which are likely to be deaf and how 
terminals can be quickly synchronized to reduce the MRP. 
In any given cycle there are two possible nodes which 
may be deaf. If other terminals try to send packets to them, 
bandwidth will be wasted. Furthermore, returning nodes will 
not have a complete picture of the network upon their return 
to the control channel. The status of some nodes is likely to 
change during their absence. Technically, two nodes may be 
unknown to any returning node when two data channels are 
implemented. This is possible because data channels are 
reserved whilst some nodes are still busy transmitting on 
data channels. As terminals in the current cycle are switching 
back to the control channel, the next set of terminals for the 
next cycle will be switching onto the data channels.  
To reduce the effects of terminal deafness, returning 
terminals may be starved of their next transmission until they 
have knowledge of the network. 
Deaf 
terminals 
are 
within 
the 
transmitter’s 
communication range but are not able to overhear or receive 
packets from a transmitter because they are busy receiving or 
transmitting on a different channel. We therefore do not 
consider transmission ranges of terminals. We assume that 
all terminals are within the communication range of each 
other and can decode all received or overheard packets. The 
impact of MRP is modeled and analytically explored in the 
following section. 
V. 
ANALYTICAL RESULTS  
This section analyzes the effects of the missing receivers 
on network performance and analytical results are presented.  
Throughput y, which is available to each node in the 
network, is given by dividing the capacity of the network by 
the number of nodes in the network [10]. Given this formula, 
the allotment of throughput to the nodes can be ascertained 
and predicted. The equation is given below: c is the capacity, 
while N the number of nodes.  
𝑦 = 𝑐 𝑁
   
 
 
(1) 
In the multi-channel environment, the capacity of the 
network increases with the number of channels implemented. 
It increases approximately at N times the channel capacity. 
Nc is therefore the total capacity of all the channels. 
So and Vaidya [11] argues that a dedicated control 
channel in a three channel system constitutes a third of the 
total capacity. Generalizing the capacity of the control 
channel Cc, with M, the number of channels, the following 
formula is obtained: 
𝐶𝑐 = 
𝑁𝑐
𝑀 , 
            (2) 
The instance of the MRP is equivalent to the control 
channel overhead as it wastes the same amount of 
bandwidth. Factoring the effects of the MRP in the allotment 
of bandwidth in (3) is obtained. 
The network throughput in the presence of MRP, denoted 
by YMRP is expressed as follows: 
𝑌𝑀𝑅𝑃 = 
𝑁𝑐 (1−𝑛
𝑀)
𝑁
                          (3) 
Network capacity is denoted by Nc, the instance of the 
MRP by n and N denotes the number of nodes. 
Given (3), the effects of the MRP can be modeled. If 
there are three channels, then one encounter of the missing 
receiver will result in one third degradation of the network 
throughput.  
Two encounters of deafness in the proposed CSA will 
result in two-thirds throughput degradation. Fig. 4 depicts 
network throughput degradation under these assumptions, 
when the capacity is set to 12 Mbs and M to 3. YMRP 
denotes throughput in the presence of MRP.

When the transmission durations of the control and the 
data channels are considered, it becomes apparent that the 
effects of MRP would be less severe. The transmission ratio 
of the control channel to the data channel is approximately 
11 to 1 in terms of transmission durations taking into 
consideration the channel switching delay. The results of an 
11 to 1 ratio are expected to differ significantly from the 
results in Fig. 4 which are based on a 2 to 1 ratio. The 
instance of a MRP will therefore cause a twelfth of network 
degradation. 
Control channel overhead is represented by (1), when M 
is 12. 
 
 
To calculate the network throughput after factoring the 
effects of the node deafness problem, equation (3) is 
employed. When an RTS is sent to a deaf node, a complete 
RTS/CTS handshake is recorded as a complete transmission 
amounting to a control channel overhead. 
The amount of bandwidth utilized is therefore equal to 
the control channel overhead. The assumption that an 
instance of a MRP amounts to the control overhead is valid 
as the control channel would be unavailable for the entire 
duration of the RTS/CTS handshake.  
The overhead caused by the instance of the MRP now 
translates to, 𝑛
12. Taking this fraction and factoring it into (3), 
we get the following equation. 
 
𝑌𝑀𝑅𝑃 = 
𝑁𝑐 (1−𝑛
𝑀)
𝑁
 
 
 
(4) 
 
Given equation (4) and that Nc is 12 Mbs and M is 12; the 
results in Fig. 5 are obtained. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Effects of MRP on throughput in our proposed solution 
Fig. 5 shows that the proposed approach is likely to 
perform better in the face of Missing Receivers and its 
performance would improve as more instances of MRP are 
encountered. For example, in Fig. 5 where two instances of 
node deafness are encountered, the proposed approach 
performed better that when only one instance was 
encountered. However, in any given cycle, at most two 
terminals may be deaf and unreachable, according to the 
CSA assumptions for a network with three channels.  
The solution to MRP will improve the network 
throughput and reduce significantly the control channel 
overhead cost. Fig. 5 shows that the instances of missing 
receivers do increase the overhead of the control channel. It 
can also be seen in the same figure that the effects of node 
deafness in the proposed architecture will be less severe as 
compared to Fig. 4. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION  
Given the proposed underlying protocol the CSA, the 
MRP will be limited to the returning terminals. The returning 
nodes should be forced to delay their next transmissions until 
they have adequate information about the status of the 
network. This will reduce the effects of MRP. The waiting 
delay may be reconsidered where network support is 
implemented. 
 When the instance of the MRP is considered to be equal 
to the overhead of the control channel, and taking into 
consideration the actual packet lengths of both data and 
control packets, the effects of MRP will be reduced further. 
The phasing of data transmission enables terminals to have 
the correct information about the channels and to know when 
to contend for data channels when they become free. 
The CSA also facilitates the implementation of the RTS-
based data channel reservation and access scheme. 
Contention will be limited to control channel and there will 
be no need for the signaling packets to be employed in 
reserving and in agreeing on data channels to be used. The 
reservation of the data channels will be scheduled through 
the control channel when a given data channel is idle and 
available for the next data transmission. 
The implementation of the CSA will make use of the 
virtual carrier sensing technique for data channel reservation.  
The physical carrier sensing, and the virtual carrier sensing, 
will be employed only for the control channel reservation.  
The control channel facilitates network connectivity. 
Furthermore, there can be at most four channels available 
when non overlapping channels are considered [12]. We are 
experimenting on how network improves, assuming that all 
the channels are available and are orthogonal. Future work 
will look at how many possible channels can be utilized if 
the additional data channels do improve the performance of 
the network.
