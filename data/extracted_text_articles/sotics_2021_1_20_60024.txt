Abstract—Access to large amounts of information has resulted
in users experiencing the effects of information overload, which
is the state where users are presented with a much higher amount
of information than they can process at a given time. Information
overload is also observed in Social Media Platforms (SMP),
which has resulted in the invention of mitigation techniques
for information overload. Currently, there are many different
approaches to deal with information overload. One popular
method to deal with information overload and minimize the
time spent by users analyzing large amounts of information
is using notification systems. Notifications aim to display the
most relevant information at a certain point in time to the user
without disturbing the daily workflow of an individual. This
work focuses on determining aspects of social media that can
be integrated into a notification system. These aspects have the
purpose to enhance and aid information retrieval, visualization,
and distribution capabilities in a notification system and reduce
the effects of information overload. As part of this work, we
executed a study with 35 participants and presented different
use­cases of Social Media Elements (SME) to evaluate their
usability. The preliminary results of the study showed that adding
social media elements to notifications increased the credibility
and clarity of notifications. The participants reacted positively
to notifications that were formatted as social media posts, rating
them more trustworthy as compared to traditional notifications.
SME had the effect of aiding the participants to better determine
the difference between fake and real information.

I. INTRODUCTION
Adoption of modern Information and Communication Tech­
nologies (ICT) have increased the amount of generated infor­
mation and made information easily accessible. However, this
also has resulted in users experiencing information overload
[1], which can be defined as the state when users are presented
with large amounts of information, that exceed the processing
capability of the users [2].
One source of information overload is notifications, since
users receive a large amount of notifications from multiple
applications on multiple devices (e.g., desktop notifications or
mobile notifications). Notifications allow applications such as
email clients, messaging applications, calendars, and others
to inform users of incoming messages from other users,
upcoming events, reminders, new emails, and more without
explicitly requiring user interaction with the application. Since
each application has a specific notification format, the user is
presented with a large amount of different information, making
it hard to process [3].
Based on a study of 40191 randomly selected partici­
pants from different areas of work, users receive on average
44.9 notifications per day from multiple sources. Participants
received notifications from 173 applications. Some of the
applications were email applications (e.g., Gmail or Outlook),
text messaging applications (e.g., Whatsapp or SMS apps),
and voice messaging applications (e.g., Google Hangout and
Skype) [4]. Findings also shown that high number of notifi­
cations, in particular from email clients and social networking
applications, correlate with increased stress and the feeling
of being overwhelmed. They distract users from executing
current tasks and induce negative emotions [5]. Another study
based on a sample of high­performing management individuals
has revealed that the increase of information overload leads
to more stress and negative emotions in individuals [2].
Users acknowledge notifications as potentially disruptive and
distracting since they do disrupt the current engagement of the
user [4].
Despite the disruptive nature of notifications, users decide to
use them because of their benefit in providing relevant infor­
mation. In this context, notification systems can be beneficial
and attempt to aggregate the previously mentioned information
from different sources (email clients, news portals, messaging
platforms, and others), and deliver it to the user in the form
of notifications [6]. Besides providing information aggregation
and notification delivery, notification systems enable the man­
agement of notifications (e.g., selecting which applications are
allowed to send notifications), which reduces the user need to
constantly interact with different applications [7]. The success
of a notification system hinges on accurately supporting the
user with information between tasks, while simultaneously
enabling utility by providing access to additional information
[8]. Notification systems attempt to keep the users informed
by balancing the amount of valuable information provided
and the disruption the information causes. It is necessary to
find means to coordinate the delivery of notifications from
multiple applications across multiple devices or/and display
only relevant information at a glance. By bringing multiple
sources of notifications together, the user can determine the
importance of a notification and reduce the level of distraction
[9].
According to [8], there are three critical parameters for the
7

creation of a successful notification system:
1) Interruption ­ is defined as an event, where the user
has to shift their attention from the main task and switch
focus to the notification. Examples of these events are
receiving notifications while operating heavy machinery,
where the notification should not distract the user from
the main task. However, other situations like medical
emergency alerts, require that the notification explicitly
interrupts the user [10].
2) Reaction ­ is defined as the response to the stimulus
provided by the notification. Some examples of user
reactions are ignoring notifications, removing them from
the notification list, and clicking on the notification.
3) Comprehension ­ is defined as the use of notification
systems with the goal of remembering and making sense
of information at a later point in time. Based on past
reactions, a notification system can show notifications
to the users when they are more likely to read them.
While quick and correct reaction to information is important
in many situations, it is also important to present the informa­
tion in a comprehensible way. Notifications should display a
balance between the interruption, reaction, and comprehension
parameters [8].
One of the main challenges with designing a notification
system is learning when and how to display understandable
and valuable messages at a glance without explicitly disturbing
or distracting the user. This problem has been tackled in
different disciplines. Potential practical concepts can be found
in social media, especially Social Media Marketing (SMM).
The goal in SMM is to present information to the user at a
specific time based on previous user behavior and experiences
with other similar users. The information contains social
media elements and should not irritate the user but stimulate
engagement with the content. This SMM information usually
has the goal to guide the user to a social media site [11].
Social media sites have become one of the most popular
social behaviors among humans, and recent statistics suggest
that more than two­thirds of internet users use social media
sites [12]. One of the main reasons for its popularity is the
user engagement and personalized information it provides
to the users. There are also drawbacks such as the lack of
security, internet addiction, frequent interruptions from other
tasks, information overload, creation of information bubbles,
and loss of social contacts [13].
Social Media and SMM concepts related to user engagement
and information presentation can potentially be adopted in
notification systems to improve message flow to users and
enhance user engagement.
Kietzmann et al. [14] identified seven main functional build­
ing blocks of social media: identity, conversations, sharing,
presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. These building
blocks can be identified in various social media applications,
like networking sites, photo­sharing platforms, blogging plat­
forms, video­sharing platforms, collaboration platforms, and
micro­blogging platforms.
In this paper, we want to identify social media elements
based on previously mentioned functional building blocks
of social media and explore which of these social media
elements can be adopted in a notification system. The goal is
to improve user interaction and navigation, information value,
information dissemination of notifications, and comprehension
of notifications in notification systems. In addition, attention
is also given to mitigate possible side effects of social media
elements and notification systems, such as wasting time ana­
lyzing and reviewing the information provided to the user via
the notification system.
Based on the observations stated above, more specifically,
the main research questions are: RQ1: Which elements of
social media can be integrated into notification systems to
display understandable and valuable notifications at a glance
without explicitly disturbing the user?, RQ2: Would users
prefer to receive notifications with integrated social media
elements like hashtags, topic keywords, source information,
rating by other users, and groups information?, RQ3: How do
users react to notifications with this additional information?,
and RQ4: Which emotions do users experience when receiving
notifications with and without this additional information?
To this end, the remainder of this paper is organized as
follows: Section II covers the literature overview and discusses
current topics in social media, notification systems, and their
relation and use­cases. In Section III, the methodologies used
in the study and the study are explained. Results are presented
in Section IV, together with the discussion of the study
outcome. Finally, we conclude the work in Section V.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Inspired by SMM, where the integration of social media
elements into marketing information has led to increased user
engagement and satisfaction, we propose adopting social me­
dia elements into notification systems and notifications [11].
In analogy to gamification applying game design elements
in non­game contexts [15], it is proposed to integrate social
media elements in non­social media contexts. The application
in notification systems aims to improve the readability of
notification and increase its informational value.
The remainder of this section assesses the drawbacks and
advantages of notification systems, outlines social media el­
ements, and investigates possible integration in notification
systems.
A. Notification Systems
There are many different implementation versions of noti­
fication systems. The most commonly used are push notifi­
cation systems for mobile phones, desktop status notification
systems, browser­based notification systems, in­vehicle infor­
mation systems, and others [16]. As mentioned in the previous
chapter, notification systems attempt to convey important
information to users effectively without creating an unwanted
intrusion into current user tasks [6]. Selecting important in­
formation for the user is a difficult task. A study of 400+
participants has shown that users are not satisfied with the
8

notifications they receive from notification systems because
they do not express the user’s current interest. This leads
to users ignoring most notifications from these systems [17].
Besides determining what is relevant information for the user,
an essential concern in notification systems is the display of
notifications without a significant interruption of users’ main
tasks. Visual implementations of notifications that typically
are not a user’s main attention priority are called secondary
displays. Users willingly sacrifice brief interruptions from their
primary task to view information of interest in these secondary
displays [18].
B. Social Media Elements
The above­mentioned functional building blocks of social
media are umbrella terms used to cover many social media
elements observed on different social media platforms. Based
on the analysis of social media sites and research on social
media aspects [14][11][19] we identified and summarized
some of the most common elements. Table I displays these
elements.
TABLE I
SUMMARY OF MAIN SOCIAL MEDIA ELEMENTS
Social Media
Element
Description
Hashtags
A hashtag is a metadata tag type used on social
networks to help users find resources with a specific
theme or content [19][20]
Microblogs
Microblog services allow users to post and share
short textual messages that are then propagated to an
audience, which can then quickly interact with the
posts and between each other [21]
Content
approval/
disapproval
Social cues that send signals of social appropriateness
or social acceptance of content to the content creator.
Examples of these social elements are Likes, Retweets,
Reactions, and more [22]
User Groups
User groups represent the extent to which users can
form communities and sub­communities. The more
‘social’ a network becomes, the bigger the group of
friends, followers, and contacts.
User­to­User
Relationship
User­to­user relationships express the extent to which
users can relate to each other (e.g., friendships on
Facebook or Followers on Twitter) [14]
User Identity
It represents the degree to which users expose their
identities on social media sites. It includes exposing
information such as name, age, gender, profession,
location, and other users’ identifiable information [14].
Considering the definition of social media elements from
Table I and the description of notification systems above, we
have decided to exclude user identity from our research and for
the review in this section. The main reason for the exclusion
of this element is that it is too focused on the individual.
Including user identity information in notifications displayed
to the user does not improve the information on notifications.
Showing this information would be redundant for the user and
could not be integrated into the context of notifications without
privacy concerns.
1) Hashtags: The content of hashtags can be dynamically
generated or user­generated and can only consist of letters,
digits, and underscores. Thus, hashtags are iconic features that
enable easy retrieval of connected resources [19][20]. They
are used to construct a personal word/hashtag vector space
of a user by examining the users’ linguistic expression [23].
Besides identifying and representing user features, hashtags
connect similar resources by assigning tags to provide contex­
tual information [24]. According to [25], linking information
on Twitter with information from other sources like Wikipedia
led to increased understanding of the information and pro­
ductivity when consuming the information. For example, in
the context of notifications, hashtags could represent the topic
of the notification or connect the notification to information
related to the topic, making it easy for the user to determine
if the notification is related to the current task.
2) Microblogs: Similar to microblog posts, notifications
are messages displayed to the users with the intent to share
information. These messages contain information from dif­
ferent applications (e.g., email subject and part of email
text, new message alert). Based on the above description,
it can be concluded that notifications share similarities to
microblog post entries. However, unlike notifications which
do not contain much additional information in their visual
representation, microblog posts contain aspects of social me­
dia, which allow the users to determine the importance and
validity of a post.Aspects like the number of individuals that
have shared, liked, or approved the post, topics related to the
shared post, and the type of individuals that have interacted
with the post are of crucial importance to assess the value of
the post and the information within [26][27].
Hashtags in Microblogging services contain information
about temporal trends of the information stream and the topol­
ogy of the spread of information. This makes hashtags a tool
suitable for archiving, tracking, and disseminating information
[28][29].
3) Content approval/disapproval: Providing and receiving
feedback is a fundamental component of participation in social
media. In addition, the popularity of social media has enabled
the use of rich user information from Facebook and other so­
cial networks to predict users’ latent traits for recommendation
[30]. Based on the previously mentioned study, users have
expressed a need for more personalization in notifications;
integrating likes into a notification system as a means to gather
feedback from the user related to the notifications could be
beneficial for improving the satisfaction rate of users [17].
4) User Groups: A widely discussed relationship group
metric is Dunbar’s Number, proposed by Robin Dunbar in
1992. He theorized that people have a cognitive limit that
restricts the number of stable social relationships with other
people to about 150. Social media platforms have recognized
that many communities grow well beyond this number and
offer tools that enable users management of memberships [31].
The assumption that the vocabulary used to discuss a topic
stays similar between different user communities and does not
vary significantly over time directly suggests that it is possible
to compute the overlap of topics of two or more communities.
This community similarity can connect communities from dif­
ferent social networks (e.g., Facebook), facilitate information
sharing between communities, and extract community interest
[32]. Furthermore, user groups and group behavior information
9

infer social cues, including group information (e.g., number of
people with the same interests who approved a notification or
executed a specific action) in notifications could increase the
credibility and information dissemination of notifications.
5) User­to­User Relationship: The type of relationships
users form between each other determines what information
exchanges between them. For example, when users form
professional relationships online, the information exchanged
between them will be of professional content and high value,
compared to friendly relationships where the information is
of a different nature [14]. User relationship information could
be used in notification systems to determine the character of
information presented to the user.
C. Discussion
Towards our goal to determine how social media elements
can enrich notifications with additional information, the sec­
tion above outlined vital social media elements and investi­
gated their application for this purpose. Table II summarizes
how social media elements could be beneficial for notification
systems.

User­to­User

Hashtags and user group elements provide additional infor­
mation, potentially enhancing the information in notifications.
Integrating these elements could increase the trustworthiness
of notification systems and reduce the time needed for a user
to evaluate the importance of notifications. Since notification
systems lack a direct user feedback mechanism, integrating
content approval/disapproval elements could provide it.
For Microblogs, our research focused on two features
Social Media Posts and Content Sharing. Due to the lack
of applicability in notification systems, content sharing was
excluded. However, considering that social media posts share
similarities with notifications, we determined that formatting
information in notifications similar to social media posts by
including hashtags, more personalized text, and information
sources, could benefit notification systems.
Even though user­to­user relationships offer great insights
into users’ interests, knowing the user and connections are
mandatory to integrate this element into a notification system.
Due to the setting of our initial study, we excluded this
element from the evaluation since it was necessary to track
user relationships over a more extended period.
To this end, we have selected four social media ele­
ments for evaluation based on their applicability in noti­
fication systems: hashtags, user group information, content
approval/disapproval, and social media posts (formatting the
content of the notification as a social media post).
III.
USER STUDY
To determine the effects of certain social media elements
on individuals, we designed an online study. The user study
addresses the above­defined research questions: RQ1 to RQ4.
The study was designed as an AB study including the
following parts:
1) General Questionnaire: contains questions listed in Ta­
ble III that aim to identify the value and effects of additional
information in notifications on the user. This questionnaire
aims to provide insights to RQ1 and RQ2, by explicitly
asking the participants about how they perceive SMEs in the
notifications they received.
TABLE III
GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE QUESTIONS
Question
Q1: Did you find the additional information in the notification valuable?
Q2: When I received notifications with additional information I was more
confident in the notification?
Q3: Rank the additional information by importance
Q4: It was easier to understand the notification when I had additional
information in the notification?
Q5: Did the notification break your concentration while executing the
task?
2) Article Feedback: contains questions listed in Table IV
that ask participants to evaluate if the articles are fake or
not. The responses determine if notifications with additional
information help determine the truthfulness of articles and how
users react to notifications with additional information.
TABLE IV

Question
Q1: Do you think that the article ”Friends Reunion” is Fake or Real?
Q2: Do you think that the article ”Instagram for Children” is Fake or

Q3: Do you think that the article ”People live in a 3D­Printed House” is
Fake or Real?
Q4: Do you think that the article ”3 Reasons Why You Should Stop Eating
Peanut Butter Cups!” is Fake or Real?
Q5: Do you think that the article ”Us Bacon Reserves Hit 50 Year Low”
is Fake or Real?
3) Computer Emotion Scale (CES): used to answer RQ4
by determining the emotional influence of notifications on the
participants since it provides one of the most scientific ways
for emotion evaluation [33].
4) System Usability Scale (SUS): used to determine if
the participants would prefer to receive notifications with
additional information, which directly correlates with RQ2 and
RQ3. It provides a trustworthy evaluation tool for usability
testing [34].
The study was created using the CoDiS Survey Tool [35],
which tracked and analyzed participants’ behavior and pre­

sented specific assignments. The CoDiS Survey Tool is a web
based evaluation tool. The participants were asked to read
articles, mentioned in Table V and execute predefined tasks
(share articles, comment on the article, and more). As the
participants were doing these tasks, notifications related to the
articles were displayed. Notifications were displayed as part of
the CoDiS Survey Tool as web elements that appear when the
user starts reading an article. Depending on the user group,
these notifications were either with additional information
or without additional information. The additional information
included hashtags, user group information, and social media
post formatting. This additional information integrates all
selected social media elements from the previous chapter.

The participant target groups for the study were high school
and university students. In total, 215 individuals were asked
to participate, and only 35 completed the study. The age of
the participants varied from 15 to 34 years old, with 57.14%
of the participants being in the range from 15 to 20 years,
25.72 % being in the range 20­25, 14.289 % in the range
25­30, and 2.85% in the range above 30 years old. Female
participants made 28.57% of the total amount of participants,
while male participants made 71.43%. As stated previously the
study was designed as an AB study, this is why the participants
were divided into two groups (Group A and Group B). The
purpose of this division is to reduce bias between users. Both
groups received the first article with additional information
notifications. The purpose of this was to create a control article
and familiarize the users with this type of notifications. Group
A received simple notifications on even­numbered articles,
while group B received them on odd­numbered articles. After
the participants finished reading the articles and the article­
related tasks, they had to complete an evaluation.
IV.
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Analyzing the answers to questions presented in Table III,
we have concluded that the participants find notifications
easier to understand and share the thought that they have more
credibility when presented with additional information. The
additional information in notifications has increased the value
of notifications to the user based on answers to Q1 from Table
III, where 85.71% confirmed the premise. The participants had
more confidence in notifications with additional information
in comparison to formal notifications, based on answers to
Q2 from Table III. Based on Q3 from Table III 77.14% of the
participants stated that they find it easier to understand notifi­
cations with additional information. With 60% of participants
answering with ”Yes” to Q5 from Table III, we can confirm
that notifications break user concentration, which validates
results of previous research [4][2].
According to [8], the success of notification systems is
dependent on the information they convey to the user. The
survey participants agree with this as shown in Table VI.
It reveals that users care predominantly about the content
and source of notifications. It implies that adding additional
information to validate the content and source increases their
value to users. The results in Table VI also validate our
proposal that formatting notifications as social media posts
could improve the information presented to the user since the
content was formatted to be similar to a social media post.
Contrary to our research, group information (e.g., ”22 readers
validated text”) was not ranked as highly important by the
participants.

The distribution of SUS answers reveals that most of the
users agree or strongly agree with questions Q1, Q3, Q4,
Q5, and Q7 of the SUS [34] while disagreeing or strongly
disagreeing with the rest of the questions. Due to a large
number of neutral answers, the average rating of the scale
is 69.78. This is slightly above the limit of 68 set by [34] as
the value that is the minimum for a usable system. Based on
the results of the SUS, we can infer that the users would prefer
to use a notification system with social media elements.

The result of the CES is shown in VII, the table contains a
list of feelings a participant has experienced. The CES shows
that the users were happy most of the time executing tasks and
receiving notifications, while none of the time experiencing
sadness, anxiety, and anger. Based on VII the emotion anxiety
has the lowest score because most of the users rated it with
”none of the time” followed by Sadness and Anger. The best­
rated emotion was Happiness where the majority of the users
answered with either ”Some of the Time”, ”Most of the Time”
or ”All of the Time”. These results do not correlate with
previous studies, where users experienced negative emotions
and stress while receiving notifications [5].
The participants were asked to determine if the articles

they read were fake or not. They rated correctly in 57.93%
of the cases. The participants that were shown notifications
with additional information, selected fake and real news with
a 6.61% greater accuracy.
Due to the inability to track the usage of notifications over a
more extended period, we could not evaluate all social media
elements.
V.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this research study displays the potential of
social media elements in different disciplines, focusing on uses
in notification systems. The initial research study shows how
the selected social media elements can potentially increase
user satisfaction and the value of information in notification
systems. Since time constraints were an issue and restricted
the number of SMEs that could be evaluated, future work
might include an analysis of user reactions to notifications
with additional information over a prolonged period. This
would enable a better evaluation of the analyzed SME and
additional SMEs that could not be part of this study. Prolonged
tracking of user reactions to different combinations of SMEs
in notifications might lead to a novel approach in the use
of SMEs and notification systems. The survey results could
provide the initial steps towards new use cases of social media
applications in notification systems and other disciplines.
