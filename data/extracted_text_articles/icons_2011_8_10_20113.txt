Abstract - The research investigates one of the most complex 
parts of the business system – innovation process. The 
relationship between the company’s innovation inputs and its 
innovation performance was studied on a sample of 2503 
companies from manufacturing and selected service sectors. 
The research was based on official Eurostat statistical data. As 
these data were essentially not adapted for analysis of 
companies’ innovation performance, the methodology for 
companies’ innovation-business performance was developed. 
The groups of non-innovators, innovation followers and 
innovation leaders were formed. In the group of leaders, ROE 
is 40% higher as regards the group of innovation followers.  
Each euro invested into innovations yields 13.9 Euros in the 
same group. But an increase in investments is related with the 
growth of productivity of invested assets only in the group of 
followers. 
Interestingly, 
increasing 
a 
portion 
of 
»breakthrough« innovations reduces the productivity of these 
assets in the group of leaders. On the basis of these findings 
recommendations are provided as to which policies of 
innovation investments should different types of innovation 
followers adopt so as to catch up with the group of innovation 
leaders.  
Keywords – innovation; R&D; technology; economic 
performance; productivity; complex systems

 INTRODUCTION  
The research investigates one of the most complex parts 
of the business system – the innovation process and its 
performance. Community Innovation Survey [1] represents 
the basic statistical instrument for innovation performance 
measurement in the EU countries. Its methodology is 
standardized and it is relatively well known among 
respondents/companies and a number of respondents is very 
high (as filling out the questionnaire is compulsory). 
However, the methodology was prepared for benchmarking 
primarily at the country level. Therefore, the data are not 
very constructive for studies focused on input-output 
innovation relations. One of the basic aims of our research 
was to develop a methodology which would enable the use 
of EU statistical data connected with innovation-business 
performance. Besides, our research is oriented towards 
identifying differences of influential factors as to the 
innovation/business performance. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces 
the theoretical principles of innovation measurement and its 
limitations. Section III is the methodology. In section IV the 
results of the analysis are presented and findings are 
discussed. Section V is the conclusions, where findings are 
summarized and the innovation policy recommendations are 
given. 
II. 
LITERATURE SURVEY AND LIMITATIONS 
The survey providing the core data for our research is the 
most recent Community Innovation Survey [2] for Slovenia. 
Literature addresses several approaches to the monitoring of 
innovation. One of the fundamental methodological 
approaches is the analysis of input (investments), process 
and output (results) groups of indicators. The selection of 
indicators proves extremely diversified. Expenditure for 
research and development activities [3] or a number of days 
dedicated to education/training of employees [4] are used as 
input indicators representing “investments” in organizational 
system. Process indicators help us establishing the state of 
innovation process management (organization, planning, 
management, and supervision). Output indicators reflect the 
results of innovation processes, for example the number of 
patents and new market products, market share, revenues 
from sales of innovations/innovative products and suchlike 
[5]. 
Various 
researches discuss 
the 
relation 
between 
innovation strategy and economic successfulness of an 
organization. Many of them show that the connection is 
positive yet weak [6]. The researches highlight also the 
importance of strategic decision to innovate in achieving 
economic results [7, 8]. Besides, the proportion of intramural 
expenditure on R&D is supposed to have an extremely 
valuable influence, which is manifested in an improvement 
of product quality [9]. 
In the mentioned studies, we face the problem of defining 
process and output indicators. The role of the innovation 
process is often not clearly defined – it is a result of inputs 
(e.g., financial inputs) or it could be treated like the 
innovation input. Besides, outputs often represent an indirect 
output (e.g., number of patents, new products etc.) which do 
not obviously lead to improved business performance. 
Therefore, we took into consideration the inputs, which 
represent the basic step towards mastering the innovation 
process and those outputs which clearly present the financial 
situation.

METHODOLOGY 
The research is focused on 2503 Slovenian companies 
from manufacturing and selected service sectors. The 
Slovenian contribution to the CIS 2006 survey includes data 
for the period from 2004 to 2006 on the enterprises’ product 
(goods or service), organizational and process innovations, 
innovation activities and expenditures, co-operation in 
innovation and the effects of innovation. In addition, 
company’s financial data (balance sheet, profit and loss 
account and some key financial ratios) was collected from 
the official statistical database on companies (the Agency of 
the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and 
Related Services), while the third statistical database 
(Statistical Register of Employment - SRDAP) provided data 
on the educational structure of employees. The first 
challenge was developing a methodology which could enable 
measuring the relation between company’s innovation inputs 
and innovation performance.  
The two key variables that represent a measurable output 
from the innovation process were defined as: RII (“Index of 
revenues from innovation”), i.e., a proportion of total 
turnover resulting from innovations (either new to the market 
or new to the company only), and RMI (“Index of revenues 
from market innovation”), i.e., a ratio of turnover from 
innovations new to the market to total innovation turnover. 
In the following phase of the research, the companies 
were divided into 5 groups. The first one is a group of 
companies (group 0) having no revenues from innovations 
(RII=0). The groups recording any revenues arising from 
innovations (RII>0) were divided into four groups pursuant 
to the value of indices RII and RMI. As a limit of division 
the medians were set, thus ensuring equal representativeness 
of companies across all four groups. Dividing the RII/RMI 
matrix in points predefined with both medians, 4 quadrants 
are obtained.  
After the development of the innovation performance 
matrix, the relationship between the innovation and business 
performance was explored. The 5 innovation groups were in 
pairs compared using nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney 
and Kruskal Wallis Tests) so as to establish in which 
variables the groups significantly differ. The variables in 
comparison are the ones included in the CIS 2006 survey 
(innovation 
related 
variables), 
supplemented by 
the 
companies’ business performance variables. 
The same statistical method (Mann-Whitney nonparametric 
test) was applied to the innovation investments variables to 
compare the proportions of financial assets that the 
companies appertaining to a particular group invest into 
innovation and how efficiently do these companies turn 
such investments into revenues arising from innovations, 
i.e., to test the extent and productivity of innovation 
investments.  
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. The innovation performance matrix development 
As demonstrated the values of the two primary output 
indices of the invention-innovation process (RII and RMI) 
served as criteria for grouping the companies. These values 
are indicated in Table I separately for non-innovative (0) and 
innovative (1 & 2) companies (these are further divided into 
4 subgroups 1a, 1b, 1c and 2); see Figure 1. Accordingly, the 
innovation leaders are companies having a high portion of 
turnover from innovations and a high portion of turnover 
from “radical” innovation in total innovation turnover (high 
RII and high RMI). Non-innovators is a group (0) of 
companies having RII/RMI=0 – no turnover based on 
innovation.  
  
 
Figure 1.  RII/RMI matrix  
B. Relationship between the innovation and business 
performance  
So far the method of dividing the companies active in the 
field of innovation into 5 groups on the basis of RII and RMI 
indicators has been demonstrated. Companies classified in 
different groups differ at least pursuant to the volume and 
structure of their revenues from innovation, i.e., direct results 
of innovation recorded on the market. However, differences 
in the revenues from innovation do not necessarily indicate 
also differences in the companies’ business performance. 
Furthermore, revenues arising from innovation do not 
provide any conclusions as regards the organisation of 
innovation systems in the companies.  
Let us therefore have a look as to whether there are any 
differences among the groups regarding their business 
performance. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test is applied to 
compare the financial ratios for the groups 0, 1 (a, b, c) and 
2. As it compares medians, which are insensitive to outliers 
compared to means, the Mann–Whitney test is less likely to 
spuriously indicate significance than the t-test because of the 
presence of outliers – i.e., Mann–Whitney is more robust. 
We would like to focus on most important performance 
indicators – on those, where the Mann-Whitney test showed 
significant differences (Table I); these were observed 
between groups 0-1 and simultaneously between 0-2. It is 
very interesting, that the Group 1 (even though with better 
innovation results concerning RII/RMI compared to Group0) 
is performing in total (as to ROE and average growth of net 
revenues) worse than the non-innovators (Group 0). On the 
other hand the company’s financial performance of Group 2 
is much better; ROE proves to be 40% higher in the group of 
innovation leaders that among followers and non-innovators, 
the average growth of net revenues is 33% higher compared

to group 0 and even 41% better than the innovation followers 
(Group 1).

At the same time the revenues appertaining to the group 
2 recorded between 2006 and 2007 increased by 7%, while 
the average revenues from 2003 to 2007 increased by 41%.  
Similar relations may be observed between the groups 0 
and 2; additionally, statistically significant differences in 
return on sales (ROS) and return on assets (ROA) may be 
observed. Companies appertaining to the group 2 pay out 6% 
higher salaries than the companies in the group 0. 
On the basis of the aforementioned findings it may be 
concluded that the companies appertaining to the group 2, 
which in comparison with the groups 0 and 1 innovate more 
successfully (achieve higher values of RII and/or RMI), 
record also better company's performance assessed with the 
financial ratios.  
C. Extent and productivity of innovation investments 
What portions of financial assets do companies 
appertaining to a particular group invest into innovation and 
how efficiently do these companies turn such investments 
into revenues arising from innovations? To answer these two 
questions the group of followers (1) shall again be examined 
by dividing it into three subgroups as indicated in Figure 1, 
i.e., 1a, 1b and 1c. A company of type 1a may enter into the 
category of innovation leaders (2) by increasing its RMI; a 
company of type 1b by increasing its RII, and a company of 
type 1c by increasing both RII and RMI. In order to make the 
examination simpler let us suppose that simultaneously only 
one of both coefficients may be increased, i.e., a path from 
the subgroup 1c into the group 2 leads either through 1b or 
through 1a.  
Using Mann-Whitney’s test it shall be established in 
which variables the groups 1b and 1a significantly differ 
from the group 2 and between each other. A comparison with 
the group of non-innovators (0) is not possible since this 
group fails to record any costs of innovation. The efficiency 
of turning the invested assets into revenues arising from 
innovations – productivity of investments – shall be 
expressed with a CRIT variable (share of innovation 
expenditure to total revenues arising from innovations – see 
also Figure 2), representing a reciprocal value of the 
productivity of investments which enables its calculation 
also for the companies which recorded revenues arising from 
innovation in the period in question (as in the case of groups 
1 and 2), yet did not record any innovation costs.

Regarding the groups 1b and 2, companies appertaining 
to the group 2 invest more than the group 1b (innovation 
expenditures in the group 2 are higher by 1.9). Productivity 
of innovation investments is significantly higher in the group 
2 than in the group 1b. The companies in the group 2 
succeed in making an average of 13.9 Euros from every Euro 
invested into innovation (or almost 2.5 times more than the 
companies in the group 1b), see Table III.  
The groups 1a and 1b do not differ regarding the costs 
yet only as regards the productivity of innovation 
investments. Productivity of innovation investment is 3.5 
times higher in the group 1a than in the group 1b. Each euro 
invested into innovations yields 19.6 Euros in the group 1a 
and 5.5 Euro in 1b. This result may be explained by the fact 
than investing similar amount of financial assets the group 1a 
on average generates higher revenues from innovation (RII).  
Which type of innovation investment policies do 
companies appertaining to the groups of innovation 
followers (1a or 1b) need to adopt in order to reach the group 
of innovation leaders (2)? The company in the group 1a 
needs to increase investments into innovation in order to 
increase RMI and thus enter into the group 2 (by factor 1.4 
on average at unchanged exploitation of these assets). 
So as to increase RII and enter into the group 2 the 
company in group 1b needs to ensure simultaneous increase 
in investments and increase in the efficiency of their 
exploitation. Therefore, a transition through the intermediate 
level (1a) is in this case reasonable.  
Transition from the group 1b into 1a shall not demand an 
increase in the invested financial assets yet it shall require a 
substantial increase in the efficiency of exploiting the 
existing assets (by factor 3.5 on average). The next step, 
transition from the group 1a into the group 2 shall – on the 
other hand – demand company’s more intensive investments 
into innovation, at unchanged efficiency of their exploitation.

CONCLUSION  
The main findings are summarised hereunder. 
A. The innovation performance matrix 
As the statistical indicators (Eurostat) were basically not 
adapted for analysis of companies’ innovation performance, 
the indicators cannot directly serve as a reference for the 
companies’ performance improvement. However, based on 
the research we defined the innovation performance matrix 
consisting of five innovation groups (non-innovators, 3 
groups of innovation followers and a group of innovation 
leaders). The matrix is based on two parameters – RII 
(“Index of revenues from innovation”) and RMI (“Index of 
revenues from market innovation”). 
B. Crucial financial performance indicators 
The return on equity (ROE - net income divided by the 
shareholder’s equity) as a fundamental indicator from the 
investor's point of view was also proved as an important 
indicator regarding the research’s aims.  
Besides, the return on sales (ROS) and the return on 
assets (ROA) are the output financial indicators which were 
considered important.  
Another important indicator is the average growth of net 
revenues, measured during the period of four years. 
C. Financial results –innovation leaders and followers 
The group of innovation leaders innovate more 
successfully (record higher values of RII and/or RMI) and 
achieve also better business performance, assessed with the 
financial ratios. Company’s performance in terms of ROE is 
40% higher in the group of innovation leaders than in the 
groups of followers and non-innovators.  
Beside ROE, significant differences between the groups 
0 and 2 as well as between 1 and 2 were observed regarding 
the growth of revenues from sales. Average growth of net 
revenues is 33% higher compared to group 0 and even 41% 
better than the innovation followers (Group 1).

If the profit is an economic category on which it is 
possible to influence by way of accountancy, e.g., with an 
objective to lower taxes, then the “growth of revenues from 
sales” (indicates entering new markets, increase in market 
shares on the existing markets or, last but not least, achieving 
higher selling prices) proves to be a more »factual« category.  
Surprisingly, the group of followers (1) – even though 
with better innovation results concerning RII/RMI compared 
to non-innovators – is performing worse than the non-
innovators (0) as to ROE and average growth of net 
revenues. 
D.  Productivity of innovation investment 
The relationship between the financial investments into 
innovation and the revenues arising from innovation 
(productivity of investments) is confirmed only partially. 
Significant difference may be observed between the groups 
1b and 2, yet not between the groups 1a and 2. While the 
groups 1a and 2 transform their innovation investments into 
revenues with a similar efficiency (measured as the CRIT 
variable), the efficiency of both are approx. 3 times higher 
than the one in the group 1b. 
Each euro invested into innovations yields 19.6 Euros in 
the group 1a and 5.5 Euros in 1b while in group 2 
(innovation leaders) this value counts 19.6 Euros. 
We can conclude, the impact of innovation investments is 
quite high, but seems not to be linear; increased investments 
do not (necessarily) result in an improved innovation 
performance.  
E. Innovation policy recomendations 
Which policies of innovation investments are thus to be 
selected by the companies appertaining to the group of 
innovation followers (1a or 1b) so as to enter the group of 
innovation leaders (2)? A company appertaining to the group 
1a needs to increase investments into innovation in order to 
increase RMI and thus enter the group 2 (at unchanged 
efficiency of exploiting these assets). So as to increase RII 
and enter the group 2 the company 1b needs to ensure 
simultaneous increase in investments and increase in the 
efficiency of their exploitation. Therefore, a transition 
through the intermediate level (1a) is in this case reasonable. 
Transition from the group 1b into 1a shall not demand an 
increase in the invested financial assets yet it shall require a 
substantial increase in the efficiency of exploiting the 
existing assets (by factor 3.5 on average). The next step, 
transition from the group 1a into the group 2 shall – on the 
other hand – demand company’s more intensive investments 
into innovation, at unchanged efficiency of their exploitation.
