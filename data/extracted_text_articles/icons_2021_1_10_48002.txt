Abstract - The world is on the footsteps of a time when the
advances of technology supported by Artificial Intelligence
(AI) will force all stakeholders to re-examine their traditional
methods for designing and engineering of all future intelligent
and autonomous systems. These systems would have the
advantages of: Self-awareness, Self-control, Self-improvement
through learning and could be Self-sufficient. We believe that
AI and Autonomy shall go hand in hand in all future
engineering applications. Modelling of applications, whether
for Earth or Space, are lacking the capacity to model AI and
autonomous systems lifecycle management. In this paper, we
are defining the main guidelines that are needed to extend
system modelling languages to cope with the future. This is
while questioning, what a future engineering and planning
lifecycles that support the migration from traditional systems
to intelligent and autonomous ones, should look alike.

INTRODUCTION
We live in an era when the increasing demand for more
intelligent
and
autonomous
technologies
that
can
accommodate growing Terrestrial and Space applications
from self-driven cars to space robotics, should influence the
traditionally used engineering methodologies.
The state of the art in System Engineering is based on the
capacity to model and define the system under design, that
means, the capacity to accurately define the different
systems’ states using a well-structured modelling language
and interfaces. Consequently, it has the capability to define
system behaviour and influence actors. Albeit how a system
model is qualified as of high fidelity, it cannot guarantee the
designed system representation in a real world or cover its
whole solution domain. There is a wide range of definitions
for such intelligent autonomous applications. Some of them
are more restrictive than others. However, the simplest one
would have the capacity to emulate and simulate human
intelligence operating a machine using learning, reasoning
and interacting with a dynamic world environment.
That is why, system modelling languages and other
techniques start adding more extensions to the languages to
define space applications or provide more accuracy to
problem resolution. Nevertheless, they are still lagging in
their capacity to model accurately a dynamic system and
better identify its behaviour and the dynamic world around it.
This is the current state of our applications which we
describe as intelligent, advanced and characterize them as
autonomous.
In fact, such lagging is a result of the human trust and
capability to validate and verify the presence of such
requirements in our engineering documentation. We are not
able to model, define, audit and verify requirements that
should be in an intelligent autonomous system.
This paper discusses the principles to extend or add a
new toolbox to model base system engineering principles.
These principles are: self-awareness and discovery, self-
control, self-improvement through learning and Machine to
Machine connectivity and cyber security.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we
present the modelling guidelines that any AI or Autonomous
(self-control) system design must comply with. Section III
addresses a plan to handle and build on an organization
knowledge and resources to address AI and Autonomy
applications. Section IV presents our implementation. We
conclude the paper with Section V where we present the
conclusion and the future work to complete such research.
II.
PRINCIPLES
Hereby, we are proposing the modelling guidelines that
any AI or Autonomous (self-control) system design must
comply with. Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) is
the methodology of choice for most of the engineering
designs. The Systems Modelling Language (SysML) was
proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG) to
address the challenges and needs in model-based system
engineering [8]. SysML is a modelling language used to add
powerful capacity to model a wide range of system
engineering problems.
This section describes the extension proposal for SysML
[5]. It presents the domain model of the extension and a
proposal for the profile extending SysML for different AI &
Autonomous systems modelling.
In this phase of our research, we based the extension
definition to the following principles used in SysML: a
domain model, a profile and a syntax [5].
A.
Self-awareness
Living in a future engineering world application based on
AI, there is a need to make sure that these applications have
the capacity to understand and be aware of their environment
[5].
In SysML, to be able to model self-awareness [7] for
intelligent autonomous systems, we need a definition of
awareness. Consequently, awareness would be the capacity

to recognize and understand the dynamic world model
interactions with the system.
B.
Dynamic world modelling
In order to benefit from the self-awareness principle, the
world model should also have the capacity to dynamically
model the world where the engineering system would
function. Dynamically modelling would provide the capacity
of the first principle to be able and implement awareness.
In this paragraph we will not discuss the fidelity of the
world model currently used or if it is dynamic or not. A
world model, in our study, must be able to discover and
introduce new elements when necessary to the world it
represents.
C.
System of Systems Modelling
To fulfil the dynamic world modelling in which a system
would operate or function, this requires the capacity to model
it from a System of Systems (SoS) view [2]. In fact, if we are
modelling the design of a health system that allows
vaccination in the current pandemic, among others, we must
be able to model the socioeconomic reality of its world. In
fact, such principle would allow the model growth. It also
supports
the
understanding
of
the
dynamic
behavior,
especially in complex systems. In this phase of research, we
would start by the following inputs as an approach to define
a dynamic System of Systems (SoS) world model [1]
(paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3) [6]:

Casual Loops;

Stock and flow diagram;

Equations;

Equations in continuous time;

Equations in discrete time; and

Dynamic simulation results.
D.
Machine-to-Machine Communication
Communication is an important aspect of our model. This
principle, in addition to others mentioned, will support the
understanding of the system model input and output. It will
support the definition of required input to the model, how
much the input is trustworthy and whether it comes from a
machine or not (discovery).
E.
Self-improvement Through Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is the main new science of AI.
The need to train the AI is becoming a major element in the
success of any AI application design. Also, the fact that there
is a Big Data repository that supports such ML approach.
However, future designs, especially in the space industry,
know a limit in space and time (RAM and CPU power).
Consequently, training and retraining of the engineering
systems is important. The state-of-the-art references multiple
techniques, among which, the nearest neighbor algorithms
that do not have a training phase and Naïve Bayes methods.
F.
Autonomy (Self-control, and could be Self-sufficient)
Autonomy
is
another
important
principle
whose
modelling would be required. It would support the definition
and the capacity of the system to trust its output, control its
inputs and outputs, request of support. Support could come
from another machine or from a human actor. A system
might need maintenance training with new data down the
road, and training is likely a continuous need.
G.
Trust and Data Sets
In traditional systems design, especially in software
(SW), configuration management is used to define a data
and system baseline. However, we will need to handle data
and metadata configuration management. This is new to the
engineering methodology. Also, data need to be clean:
complete and representative of the operation environment.
Human-on-the-Loop actors might be required at early stages
of the design to verify that data are relevant and behaviours
are appropriate in response to the training [6].
H.
Verification and Validation
There is no well agreed upon approach to test and this is
Verify and Validate (V&V). Some researchers consider AI
and ML systems have a black box approach to validate and
verify the different systems requirements. There must be a
capacity to model V&V of the system.
Consequently, this would contribute to increase the trust
and confidence in the system. Also, it would allow the
capability for test engineers to demonstrate the system
compliance to requirements statements and requirements
traceability.
III.
PLANNING FOR AI AND AUTONOMY
As stated, AI and autonomy are part of engineering
applications future. Currently, most countries are building
towards such future. The domain of AI and autonomy will
experience strong world competition in the coming decades
after the knowledge era. Governments started by establishing
strategic plans in order to be ready and enter such augmented
knowledge era. We believe that organizations should do the
same. In fact, the burden in that age would fall on academia,
industry, public and organizations addressing advanced
technology more than any level of government.
Consequently, the state of the art including this paper
proposed a plan to handle and build on an organization
knowledge and resources to address AI and Autonomy
applications. The section below presents a summary of the
state of art as well as our own implementation plan.
The plan has to address the organization’s needs, goals
and objectives. It aims at identifying the objectives and
priorities of adopting artificial intelligence and promoting
autonomous operations in their respective industry, science
or research. This is in addition to identifying opportunities
and gaps that should be addressed, as well as outlining
desired outcomes for this organization. Finally, this plan will
describe the needed management and technical approaches
and expected economic gains.
A.
Autonomy and AI Strategy for the program
Define what are the AI and autonomy needs, objectives
and goals and how they are linked to the organization’s
overall strategy.

B.
Application Area Identification
This
section defines the potential ways
in
which
autonomy
and
AI
capabilities
can
be
added
to
the
organization’s activities. This section will also assess the
extent to which Autonomy and AI can be feasibly applied to
meet a minimum set of goals. The section will conclude with
the results of why Autonomy and AI can be used, rationale
behind
that conclusion and, if needed, a priority of
implementation.
C.
Planning Section
The plan has to outline when AI and autonomy shall be
integrated at the different levels of products, operations,
economic activities, etc.
It will consider the different
alternatives of building and buying Autonomy and AI
solution to a specific problem as identified on Application
Area Identification.
D.
Implementation Section
In this section, the plan will explain how the Autonomy
and AI will be best integrated within the program, including
the possibility of the hardware being in space prior to the
software being completed. It will also address how the
ground segment can be designed to support data science and
ongoing analysis results.
E.
Technology Aspects
In this section, we will identify, what technology is
required to achieve our Autonomy and AI priorities. Does
the program have the right technology in place already? If
not, what technology development do we need to put in
place?
F.
What Is Next
This section will detail the change management process
and the key next steps. This section will be as a result of
identifying a subsystem, a function or a technology that is
targeted to be automated or a candidate to introduce AI.
IV.
IMPLEMENTATION
Inspired by [4] we developed the following extension to
adapt
to
our
principles
and
extend
the
SYSML
to
accommodate AI and Autonomy applications.
Figure 1 shows the proposed domain model defined as a
meta-model. This represents the syntax that can be used to
describe the above mentioned principles.
Figure 2 offers a high-level view of the organization of
the SysML profile. This SysML is proposed in order to
extend SysML with constructs for AI and Autonomy
principles’ modeling. Similar to [4], the profile is organized
into two top-level packages: the Ai-Autonomy Library and
SysML. The first is an UML Model Library which defines
datatypes and reusable concepts, while the other will contain
the concepts of AI-autonomy data.

of
introducing
AI-based
systems.

We have also identified multiple challenges that we are
working on as part of this research:

•
Lack of human role to review and assume
responsibility;
•
Human factors (HMI, etc.); and
•
User’s acceptance.

in
fact,
Self-
improvement might require continuous
source of huge amount of data.
•
Self-awareness
•
Sensory input and lack of;
•
Knowledge base and the ability to reason
about abstract concepts; and
•
Decision-making
capability
and
legal
social context.
•
Computing power and the public trust in AI
•
Would there be an AI standard or international
global use rules?
This paper described an important aspect of our modeling
of future AI and Autonomous applications. The traditional
MBSE
and
systems
engineering
approaches
and
methodologies
are
well
adapted
to
accommodate
the
advanced
nature
of
those
advanced
technologies
as
represented by AI. The paper discussed multiple principles
that MBSE tools based on SysML has to adopt in order to
cope with the rapid AI based applications development. The
paper presented in Section II a set of principles that would
allow the current System Engineering approaches based on
MBSE to model AI and autonomous systems. In fact, we
extended the modelling of AI and autonomous systems to
include SoS aspects. We provided a possible SysML
extension based on the OMG work [8]. We are also
investigating
future
work
to
improve
our
modelling
approach.
