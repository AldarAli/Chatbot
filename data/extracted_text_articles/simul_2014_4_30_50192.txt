Abstract—Grasping and manipulation by multiﬁngered robot
hand is challenging due to the dynamic uncertainties of the hand
and the object. The purpose of the grasping and manipulation
research is to improve the control performance based on the
hand, object and contact model. In this paper, a multiﬁngered
hand called The Barrett Hand is chosen for investigation. A
mathematical model of the hand is developed using Lagrangian
method. Contact model between the hand and object is developed
as compliance system assuming that the object stiffness properties
are known. Grasping and manipulation control problem is stated
as: 1. Object motion and 2. Contact force tracking. Higher Order
Sliding Mode (HOSM) control is proposed for motion tracking of
the hand joints and object. 2nd order sliding mode law is used to
minimise the tracking error considering nonlinear dynamics and
uncertainties. Adaptive Force-based Impedance Mode (AFIM)
control is proposed to regulate the contact force which drives the
desired impedance of the hand-object compliance system. This
impedance also generates online reference trajectory for motion
tracking according to the contact force. Both control methods
are simulated in Simulink/SimMechanics environment. The joint,
object and force tracking results are presented and discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Conventional robot manipulators used in industries are
combined form of single arm attached to a gripper. The gripper
is effective in performing tasks where the large motion of
the payload required with fewer Degrees of Freedom (DOF).
Traditional grippers are unable to show the efﬁciency where
precise movement is needed for the object manipulation [2].
Grippers are being replaced now by the human hand alike
multiﬁngered hand to ease the grasping and manipulation
activities by industrial manipulators.
Human hand grasps and manipulates an object by several steps:
1. The human eye works as sensor to locate the object location.
2. Hand moves to the object location with previous grasp
planning knowledge. 3. When grasp is planned, ﬁngers make
contact with assumed forces, but change the force depending
on the object’s mass, stiffness and material properties. These
properties are sensed by the brain to send the signals to the
arm and hand to apply the optimized forces for grasping
and manipulation of the object. The above procedures are
not simple in robot hand grasping and manipulation. In an
attempt to attain the identical abilities of the human hand,
research has been going on for last two decades. In the early
stage of the grasping research, Okada discussed the computer
control method of multijoint ﬁnger system for precise object
handling [11]. Mason and Salisbury formulated the grasp
problem and introduced the grasp jacobian [10]. Kerr and
Roth worked on grasp kinematics [8]. Bicchi and Okamura
focused on grasping and manipulation of unknown objects
[2][12]. Currently, several multiﬁngered hands are available
in the industries and also for the research. The robot hand
is a complex system due to the presence of additional DOF
for dexterity. In addition, this is not similar to the custom
gripper which is efﬁcient in generating a speciﬁc rigid grasp
of an object. The same grasp with multiﬁngered hand requires
intelligent control and results in a decrease in grasp rigidity.
In this paper, two advanced robust control methods are applied
for grasping and manipulation of an object by a robot hand.
Higher Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) is implemented for
position accuracy of the robot containing uncertainties and
Adaptive Force based Impedance Method (AFIM) is applied
to minimize the contact forces during manipulation. Both
methods are advanced and powerful in achieving position and
force control respectively in individual robotic tasks. There-
fore, those are applied together in grasping and manipulation
of the hand which is related to combined position and force
problem. To implement and see the performances, a three
ﬁngered robot hand is modeled, contact model between the
hand and the object is derived, control problem of grasping
and manipulation is deﬁned and robust adaptive controllers
are designed according to the problem requirements. Contact
locations and types are assumed to be known for simplifying
grasp planning. The other assumptions made in studying the
kinematics are that the ﬁngers do not slip on the object, the
object and ﬁnger links are rigid body, accurate models of the
hand and object are known.
In next four subsections, grasp properties, robot and object
kinematics and dynamics are derived. Section 2 explains the
control theories behind HOSM and AFIM. The control laws
implemented for the robot hand are also included here. Simu-
lation of the proposed control and the results are presented in
Section 3. The last section provided the summary of the work
and future aspects.
A. Grasp and manipulation properties
A grasp is deﬁned as a combination of hand posture
and position that generates a contact force set between the
hand and the grasped object. The grasp jacobian maps the
relation between the object and the hand through this contact
force. It is ﬁrst proposed by Mason and Salisbury [10]. The
popular Barrett hand is considered for analysing grasping and
manipulation properties in this paper. It is used in industries for
different tasks and available for research activities. Consider
this three ﬁngered hand grasping an object in Figure 1 [15].
Each ﬁnger has two DOF available for the grasping and
manipulation tasks. Lets deﬁne the object coordinate frame

origin of Cf,i with respect to Cb. The term rc is the position
vector from the origin of Co to contact coordinate Cf,i with
respect to Cb . All contacts between the object and hand are
considered as point contact without slip. If each ﬁnger applies

relation ˙ro,i = ˙rf,i is valid where, ˙ro,i is the object and ˙rf,i
is the ﬁngertip velocity at i-th contact point and both are
equal, assuming there is no slip during contact. Considering the

can be expressed as,

is related to the object motion and fe occurs due to external
forces. Recall (5) and rewrite as follows:

1) Robot hand Kinematics and Dynamics: The robot hand
dynamics is derived from the hand kinematics. According to
the Figure 1, the Barrett hand has 3 ﬁngers, each ﬁnger has 2
links. All ﬁngers are identical in shape and dimension, but
ﬁnger F1 and F2 have extra DOF. Let (x, y, z)F,i be the
coordinates of the ﬁngers and the forward kinematics of the
ﬁngers Fi (i = 1, 2) are,
xF,i = (l1 cos(q1 + qi1) + l2 cos(q1 + q2 + qi1 + qi2)) sin(φ)
yF,i = l1 sin(q1 + qi1) + l2 sin(q1 + q2 + qi1 + qi2)
zF,i = (l1 cos(q1 + qi1) + l2 cos(q1 + q2 + qi1 + qi2)) cos(φ)
(14)
and the forward kinematics of the ﬁnger F3 are,
yF,3 = l1 sin(q1 + qi1) + l2 sin(q1 + q2 + qi1 + qi2)
zF,3 = (l1 cos(q1 + qi1) + l2 cos(q1 + q2 + qi1 + qi2))
(15)
where, qi1 = 2.46◦ and qi2 = 40◦. For Cartesian coordinate
position (xc, yc, zc), the joint angles of the ﬁngers can be
calculated with inverse kinematics using simple algebra and
trigonometry [10].
Robot dynamics is determined by the Lagrangian method.
The Lagrangian L is determined as the difference of kinetic
(T) and potential (V) energy of the system [10][16]. Now,
differentiate the Lagrangian L to derive the equations of motion
of the system from the following term,
Ti = ∂
∂t
 ∂L
∂ ˙qi

− ∂L
∂qi
(16)
where, i=1,2,3.....n is considered as DOF of the system. Robot
ﬁnger dynamics are derived using (16) as,
Mfi ¨q + Cfi(q, ˙q) ˙q + Nfi(q) = τfi
(17)
where, Mfi ∈ ℜ3×3 is the hand mass matrix, Cfi(q, ˙q) ∈ ℜ3×3
is the vector of the coriolis and centrifugal terms and Nfi ∈
ℜ3×1 are the gravity terms for the ﬁngers F1 and F2. For the
ﬁnger F 3, Mf3 ∈ ℜ2×2, Cf3(q, ˙q) ∈ ℜ2×2 and Nf3 ∈ ℜ2×1.
The ﬁnger joint acceleration ¨q is calculated from (17) as,
¨q = Mf
−1 (τf − Cf(q, ˙q) − Nf(q))
(18)
Substitute, (18) into (13), the robot-object dynamics at
object frame is written in the following form,
Mof ¨q + Cof(q, ˙q) + Gof(q) = τOF
(19)
where, Mof, Cof and Gof are combined robot-object terms
and have the following expression after rearranging,
Mof = Mo + GJ−T

Cof = Co + GJ−T

by choosing the control input such that the sliding surface
fulﬁlls the following condition:
1
2
d
dts2 ≤ η |s|
(24)
where, η is a positive constant. The above condition states
that the system energy decays until the system state reaches
the sliding surface. In HOSM, the discontinuous control input
is applied to a higher time derivative of the sliding surface.
The applications of HOSM in non-linear systems are found
in [4][5]. Levant proposed a method of arbitrary order sliding
mode controller design is discussed [9]. Defoort developed
a robust HOSM controller for ﬁnite time stability [4]. For
specifying HOSM, consider the non-linear system as,
˙x = f(x, t) + g(x, t)
y = s(x, t)
(25)
The relative degree r of system (24) is assumed to be known
with respect to the sliding variable s. The control goal is to
reach s=0 in ﬁnite time and hold by discontinuous function
of s and its derivatives s, ˙s, ¨s · · · · · · · · · sr−1. The r-th order
sliding mode is expressed as,
Sr = {u ∥ s, ˙s, ¨s · · · · · · · · · sr−1 = 0}
(26)
The mode s = 0 is achieved after ﬁnite time transient. The
control input appears at the r-th order sliding set as,
Sr = h(x, t) + g(x, t)
(27)
where h(x, t) = sr|u=0, g(x, t) =
∂
∂usr ̸= 0. From HOSM
structure of (26) and (27), the controller uh is chosen as,
uh = αsign
 
˙sh +
p
| sh |sign(sh)
˙sh +
p
| sh |
!
(28)
where, h = f/o, (f for ﬁnger and o for object). Equation (28)
is the HOSM law proposed for ﬁnger and object tracking. The
sliding variable sh is expressed from tracking error eq and eo
as,
sh = ˙eh + λheh
(29)
The control input torque for trajectory tracking is expressed
as a combination of SMC and HOSM below,
uhosm = uc + uh
(30)
where, input uc is expressed as,
uc = u − Ksc = M ¨qr + C ˙qr + G − Ksc
(31)
The term K is the sliding gain and the sliding function sc is
considered from (23).
B. Adaptive Force based Impedance Control
For grasping and manipulation, the important task is to
maintain the contact force when the object is grasped. Position
and force cannot be maintained at the same time, but the
contact force can be regulated by controlling the impedance of
the hand. Impedance methods have high impact over position
and contact force control.The impedance problem is deﬁned
as proposing a single controller with estimated contact force
exerted by the object on the robot hand that regulates motion
trajectory and contact force with or without knowledge of
object stiffness. It was ﬁrst introduced by Hogan [3]. The
general impedance law is deﬁned as,
Fd−Fc = MI( ¨Xd− ¨Xr)+BI( ˙Xd− ˙Xr)+KI(Xd−Xr) (32)
In (32), force error ef = Fd − Fc drives the mechanical
impedance properties of the object where,Xr is the regulated
object position trajectory driven by ef = Fd−Fc. To calculate
the resultant force exerted by object, substitute (32) into object
dynamics of (10) yields,
Fo = (Mo − MI)¨e + BI ˙e + KIe + Co(Xo, ˙Xo)
(33)
The impedance error should tend to zero and can be expressed
mathematically,
lim
t→∞ Xd − Xr ≈ 0
(34)
The resultant force found from (33) is to realize the desired
coupled compliance of (32). The contact force F c can be
calculated from (11) as,
Fc = G+Fo + FI
(35)
where, FI is the internal force. Reference trajectory is then
regulated from (33) for tracking control by HOSM. The
integration of adaptation mainly focuses on generating desired
trajectory online as a function of force tracking error ef. When
contact force is generated, the online based desired object
trajectory is deﬁned as,
Xd(t) = f(t) + kp(t)eF (t) + kd(t) ˙eF (t)
(36)
where,f(t) is the auxiliary input, generated by the adaptation
scheme. kp(t) and kv(t) are adaptive proportional gains driving
force error and error rate. These are determined by the P-I
adaptation laws below:
a(t) = a(0) + α1
R t
0 q(t)dt + α2q(t)
kp(t) = kp(0) + β1
R t
0 q(t)eF (t)dt + β2q(t)eF (t)
kd(t) = kd(0) + γ1
R t
0 q(t) ˙eF (t)dt + γ2q(t)˙eF (t)
q(t) = wpeF (t) + wd ˙eF (t)
(37)
where, wp and wd are weighting factors object position and
velocity. The terms (α1, β1, γ1) are integral adaptation gains,
and (α2, β2, γ2) are proportional adaptation gains. The online
based trajectory Xd is calculated from (36) and (37) where
Xd(0) = a(0). This online based Xd is fed by the impedance
ﬁlter (32) to extract regulated trajectory Xr. The regulated
Xr is then tracked by HOSM control method. Two control
methods applied to the multiﬁngered hand is shown in Figure
2.

KI = 450 . The adaptive parameters are: kp, kd, wp and wd
are selected as 1.4, 0.041, 0.02 and 0.001 respectively.
At ﬁrst, ﬁngers are simulated in joint space to see
the tracking performance with HOSM. Desired trajectories
of the ﬁngers are given for both mode as [sp, q2, q3] =
[0.7854, 0.6109, 0.4363] rad. In Figure 3 and 4, joint motion of
ﬁngers are compared between HOSM and general computed
torque method (CTC). It appears that the overshoots are less
and settling down is quick with HOSM considering uncertain-
ties. Trajectories are well tracked with disturbances given as
additional input into the system. In Figure 5, control torques
of ﬁnger F3 are shown with SMC (Top) and HOSM (Bottom).
The input signal chattering is visible with SMC, common
in ﬁrst order sliding mode. The chatterings are completely
eliminated with HOSM which indicates that HOSM is not only
able to achieve precise tracking performance but also provides
smooth torque to drive the joints. Then, the system is simulated
to assess the performance of object manipulation after grasp.
The object position and orientation errors are shown in Figure
6 and 7 respectively. The HOSM based manipulation errors
are compared with CTC. The error are large with CTC method
and not converging to zero for few motion vectors. The motion
errors are improved and converged to zero with HOSM. Figure
8 shows the tracked normal contact forces of all ﬁngers for
desired force input of 10 N. The results are compared with
natural impedance ﬁlter. The steady state errors are found with
impedance law. Overshoots are reduced and steady state errors
are minimized with AFIM mode.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Two adaptive and robust control methods are proposed for
grasping and manipulation of an object by multiﬁngered robot
hand. Sliding mode based HOSM control is proposed due
to the high precision tracking requirements for performing
manipulation tasks. Joint and object motion tracking results
indicate the authenticity of the HOSM control algorithm. The
AFIM process is efﬁcient in generating a grasp of an object
with a desired force estimated by object stiffness properties.
Addition of adaptation helped to achieve the desired force.
This method ensures not to cause any damage to the object as
the ﬁngers only exert the desired force to grasp and manipulate
the object. Control objectives are successfully achieved by the
proposed methods and the simulated results.
