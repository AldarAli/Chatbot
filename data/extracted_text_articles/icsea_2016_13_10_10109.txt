Abstract—Users encounter privacy threats when they use cloud
services through mobile devices. A user leaves a large amount of
usage data on the server sides. Leaving a single piece of usage
data on the server side may seem harmless to user’s privacy, but
if usage data is all taken together, the sensitive information can be
leaked. To detect privacy leakages, various privacy measurements
have been proposed. However, it’s not easy for the user to ﬁnd
suitable privacy measurements because he does not have the
background knowledge. Moreover, the user also does not know
what is available to be used for protecting his privacy when he
ﬁnds privacy leakages. In this work, iGuard, a personalized guard
system for cloud service usage on mobile devices, is provided.
iGuard provides a customized privacy measurement plan which
ﬁts in the user’s personal situation. The plan is executed to detect
possible privacy leakages when the user is using cloud services.
To resolve the leakages, iGuard also provides workable privacy
protection strategies. The user can apply one of the strategies
and see its effect on the privacy measurement results. According
to the results, the user can tune his strategy continuously until
he is satisﬁed with the results. By continuously tuning, the user
can manage the privacy-utility trade-offs of using cloud services.
Keywords–privacy measurement; privacy protection.

INTRODUCTION
Users enjoy all kinds of conveniences provided by cloud
services through mobile devices anytime and anywhere. Cloud
services enable users to access all kinds of data and use
various software on the Internet. In 2014, twelve percent of the
EU population used cloud services for document editing. The
proportion was even higher (23%) among the population aged
16-24 [1]. But the truth is that cloud service providers are also
interested in tracking user information, e.g., user preferences,
personality traits, and relationship statuses. Privacy threats
increase when users access cloud services through mobile
devices. Mobile devices are equipped with various sensors
to collect users’ contextual information, such as geolocation
information. When a user performs an operation on a cloud
service, not only data that the user enters into the cloud
service but also contextual information is sent to the cloud
service. The cloud service gets more data than the user inputted
manually, but the user does not know what the cloud service
gets additionally. Besides, leaking a single piece of usage data
to the cloud service may be harmless to user’s privacy. But
a user’s proﬁle, such as his routines and preferences, will be
revealed if all the usage data on the server side is aggregated
and further analyzed.
The revealed user information is collected further and
reused without the user’s awareness and permission [2]. The
management of user data on cloud services might not be
trustworthy [3]. Cloud service providers might use user data
for various purposes, or sell the data to others who need
to perform data aggregation. More user information might
eventually be mined for all kinds of purposes, and the user
will not have any control over those purposes. In fact, the user
has the right to know what can be revealed from his usage
data, but cloud service providers do not respect this right, still
collecting user information without notifying the user. If the
user wants to be aware of data leakages from his usage data,
he must apply appropriate privacy measurements on the usage
data by himself. A privacy measurement focuses on a kind of
usage data and detects a speciﬁc user privacy leakage from
the data. There are various privacy measurements available
currently. For example, the privacy measurement proposed by
Liao et. al [4] can be used to detect leakages of the user’s
transportation routines from Global Positioning System (GPS)
data. Even though the user does not expose any GPS data
to the cloud service, another privacy measurement proposed
by Valkanas and Gunopulos [5] can be used to detect user’s
location information leakages from general textual information
on social network services. A user has his own combination of
cloud services in use and personal privacy preferences. Among
all these different privacy measurements, the user has to select
privacy measurements that ﬁt in his situation and performs
the privacy measurements on suitable timing. However, the
user may not have the background knowledge to select and
perform the privacy measurements. A general user knows how
to operate a cloud service, but he may not know the usage
data that will be sent to the cloud service, let alone the privacy
measurements that are available for detecting privacy leakages.
Even though the user discovers a privacy leakage, he may not
have the knowledge to avoid the privacy leakage while keeping
using the cloud service.
In this work, iGuard, a personalized guard system for cloud
service usage on mobile devices, is proposed. According to the
user’s personal situation, his combination of cloud services
in use and privacy preferences, iGuard selects appropriate
privacy measurements for the user. iGuard collects usage data

sent to the cloud services and triggers corresponding privacy
measurements on suitable timing for detecting possible privacy
leakages. If privacy leakage is detected, the user will receive
a warning from iGuard. iGuard provides privacy protection
strategies for the user. The effect of the applied protection
strategies is reﬂected in the results of the privacy measurements
so that the user can improve his strategies continuously based
on the results. Contributions of this work are outlined as
follows.
1)
In this work, user-centric privacy protection is pro-
vided. The user-centric privacy protection focuses
on personal privacy measurements and customized
privacy protection strategies. The personal privacy
measurements detect critical privacy threats, and the
customized privacy protection strategies help mitigate
the threats.
2)
iGuard, a system that implements the user-centric
privacy protection, is provided. As types and amount
of user data collected by cloud services increase,
demands of new privacy measurements also increase
to provide comprehensive user privacy protection.
iGuard takes the extension of privacy measurements
into consideration, and is ﬂexible for adding new
privacy measurements.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In
Section II, an overview of related work is provided. The user-
centric privacy protection is illustrated in Section III. Details
of the iGuard system is described in Section IV. In Section V,
two case studies of using iGuard are provided. Finally, this
work is concluded in Section VI.

RELATED WORK
Privacy leakages caused by using cloud services have been
identiﬁed in previous work. Chairunnanda et. al [6] indi-
cated that users’ identities were constructed from their typing
patterns. Liao et. al [7] showed that users’ daily activities
and movements were identiﬁed from raw GPS data collected
by mobile devices. Ferrari et. al [8] observed that users’
mobility patterns in an urban environment were extracted
from their participation in social networks. Valkanas and
Gunopulos [5] demonstrated that user’s location information
was exposed from general textual information about their
surroundings in social networks without using a GPS-enabled
device. Murukannaiah and Singh [9] indicated that users social
circles could be identiﬁed by bringing together contextual
information and users’ online social interactions. These work
provides various privacy measurements on different privacy
leakages. iGuard utilizes suitable privacy measurements and
makes privacy measurement plans for users according to their
personal settings.
Protection strategies that alleviate the identiﬁed privacy
leakages are also proposed. Stenneth and Yu [10] used a
trusted thirdparty server as the mediator between user devices
and cloud services, and applied the k-anonymity technique
to hide identiﬁcations of the user devices. Zhang et. al [11]
used noise data to obfuscate cloud services. The authors
generated noise service requests and injected these requests
into real customer service requests. The noise service requests’
occurrence probabilities were identical to customer service
requests so that cloud service providers could not distinguish
them from customer service requests. Customers’ privacy was
consequently protected. Ren et. al [12] partitioned data into
data fragments and stored them to different cloud services.
Beresford et. al [13] created a modiﬁed version of the Android
operating system that allowed users to ‘mock’ access to the
resources of user devices for cloud services. Guha et. al [14]
proposed the Koi platform which avoided leaking privacy-
sensitive information by masking low-level lat-long informa-
tion from applications. Kasai et. al [15] proposed a service
provision system that selected the best-working services for
users according to the minimal personal information provided
by the users. Among all these privacy protection strategies,
iGuard provides users the ones that solve their identiﬁed
privacy leakages. Users can select the preferred one and apply
it for protecting their privacy.
III.
USER-CENTRIC PRIVACY PROTECTION
A user uses cloud services through the mobile device to
solve daily problems, and the combination of cloud services
in use varies from person to person. Furthermore, information
exposure that causes “privacy leakage” to a user also varies
from person to person, since the deﬁnition of “sensitive in-
formation” is different for every user. Some users take their
political views as sensitive information but others do not. Some
users mind revealing their home addresses, but others do not.
Every user has his own sensitive information list describing
personal information that should not be exposed to others. As
a result, iGuard applies user-centric privacy protection to take
the user’s personal situation into consideration. The process
of the user-centric privacy protection is shown in Figure 1.
Details of each step of the process are described as follows.

Step 1. Make a plan.
Privacy monitoring is per-
formed according to a customized privacy measure-
ment plan, which is made based on the user’s personal
situation. The privacy measurement plan is the base
to ensure the user’s privacy when he is using cloud
services. The privacy measurement plan deﬁnes the
privacy measurements which should be applied and
the timing of triggering these privacy measurements.
Selection of the privacy measurements is based on
1)
the type of cloud services in use,
2)
the type of usage data that is sent to the cloud
services, and
3)
the user’s sensitive information list.
A privacy measurement does not need to be triggered
in real time when the user is using a cloud service. It
can be a summary of user operations in a period of
time, e.g., a day or several hours. The frequency of
applying a privacy measurement is decided according
to the user’s preference and characteristics of the
privacy measurement.

•
Step 2. Monitor privacy. When the user is using a
cloud service through the mobile device, usage data
sent to the cloud service should be evaluated for
privacy concern. In this step, corresponding privacy
measurements are triggered. The privacy measure-
ments take the usage data as input and indicate poten-
tial privacy disclosure threats. The user will receive
warnings if privacy leakage is detected. He reviews
details of the warning and takes further actions for
protecting his privacy (step 3).
•
Step 3. Protect privacy. The user can apply privacy
protection strategies to alleviate the privacy leakages.
Privacy protection strategies are divided into two cat-
egories.
1)
Changing user behavior. Changing the way
that a user uses the cloud service will also
change the usage data received by the cloud
service. The user can thus hide his sensi-
tive information by changing his behavior.
For example, a user checks his e-mails most
frequently when he is at work. If the user’s
working hours are detected from his usage
frequency, he can confuse the cloud service by
using the cloud service as evenly as possible
in different time periods of a day.
2)
Applying third-party privacy protection ser-
vices. There are a variety of privacy protection
services available to protect the user’s privacy.
These services can insert noises to normal
usage data [11], use fake data to replace real
data [13], or suggest the best-working cloud
services that ﬁt the user’s privacy require-
ments to replace the cloud service in use [15].
By applying these privacy protection services,
the user can keep his privacy safe while using
the cloud service as normally as possible.
The user can apply more than one privacy protection
strategies, and observe their effects on the results
of the privacy measurements (step 2). The user can
change or adjust the strategies to ﬁnd one that best
ﬁts his personal situation, and balances the trade-offs
between cloud service utilities and privacy protection.
IV.
IGUARD SYSTEM
The system overview of iGuard is depicted in Figure 2.
Components of iGuard are divided into three parts.
1)
Packet collector. To detect possible privacy leakages,
iGuard has to collect usage data which is sent to cloud
services. Packet collector is responsible for collecting
mobile device packets to further extract usage data
from them.
2)
iGuard client. iGuard client is the interface between
the user and iGuard server. It is implemented as an
application installed on the mobile device to interact
with the user. iGuard client allows the user to review
results of the privacy measurements, and send his
personal preferences to iGuard server. Once privacy
leakage is detected, iGuard client generates instant
notiﬁcation to the user.
3)
iGuard server. iGuard server consists of four compo-
nents: plan maker, privacy measurement coordinator,

service agent, and strategy suggester. The four com-
ponents collaborate to complete the whole process of
user-centric privacy protection.
In the following, the ways that the components of iGuard
server achieve user-centric privacy protection are illustrated.
A. Make a Plan
Making a personalized privacy measurement plan includes
the following three steps.
1)
Acquire types of usage data that will be sent to
cloud services. Applications are client-side interfaces
for cloud services. Permissions of an application
reveal the types of data that will be acquired by
its corresponding cloud service. At the beginning,
iGuard client collects all the applications installed
on the mobile device and their permissions. iGuard
client sends the information to plan maker (1). Plan
maker analyzes permissions of the applications and
gets the types of usage data collected by the cloud
services behind the applications. If a new application
is installed on the mobile device, plan maker will
be notiﬁed about the new-installed application and
update the privacy measurement plan.
2)
Conﬁrm the user’s sensitive information list. In
this step, plan maker checks the user’s sensitive
information list. A sensitive information list describes
a user’s personal information that should not be
exposed to others. Initially, iGuard client provides
a generalized sensitive information list to the user.
Once the user tunes the list to get a personalized
sensitive information list, plan maker will receive the
updated list from iGuard client (2).
3)
Check available privacy measurements. Plan maker
gets the list of available privacy measurements from
service agent (3), which is responsible for commu-
nicating with third-party privacy measurement ser-
vices. In the available measurement list, privacy
measurements provided by the third-party privacy
measurement services are described. For each of the
privacy measurements in the list, its type of input
291

ICSEA 2016 : The Eleventh International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

data, focused privacy leakage, and suggested detec-
tion frequency are provided. Plan maker selects the
privacy measurements, which not only ﬁt in the types
of usage data but also can detect leakages of sensi-
tive information. Plan maker then creates a privacy
measurement plan, which deﬁnes the corresponding
privacy measurements and their triggering frequency
when the cloud services are used.
After a privacy measurement plan is created or updated,
plan maker sends it to privacy measurement coordinator for
performing privacy monitoring (4).
B. Monitor Privacy
When the user is using the cloud service, mobile phone
packets sent to the cloud service are acquired by packet collec-
tor. Packet collector can be a component which embeds either
in a modiﬁed version of the Andriod operating system or in
software-deﬁned networking [16]. Packet collector then copies
the packets to privacy measurement coordinator (5). Privacy
measurement coordinator identiﬁes the cloud service in use
and extracts the usage data sent to the cloud service. Privacy
measurement coordinator accumulates the usage data until the
triggering time of the corresponding privacy measurements
speciﬁed in the privacy measurement plan comes. To trigger a
privacy measurement, privacy measurement coordinator acti-
vates the corresponding privacy measurement service through
service agent (6). Service agent is responsible for communi-
cating with privacy measurement services. Once it receives
measurement results from the privacy measurement service,
service agent passes the measurement results back to privacy
measurement coordinator. Privacy measurement coordinator
keeps the measurement results for user review in the future.
If privacy leakages are identiﬁed in the measurement results,
privacy measurement coordinator will generate warnings to
iGuard client and activate strategy suggester (7).
As all sorts of portable devices are invented and widely
used, new types of usage data are exposed to cloud services,
such as the user’s daily amount of exercise and heart rate.
Demands for new privacy measurements increase to detect
new privacy risks caused by the usage data. To ﬂexibly add
new privacy measurements, service agent applies the service-
oriented architecture (SOA). Third-party privacy measurement
services are assumed trustworthy. They are self-contained
units which provide privacy measurement functionality. The
mechanism for communication between service agent and
privacy measurement services is described in authors’ another
work [17]. A privacy measurement service can join iGuard
by registering to service agent. If a new privacy measurement
service successfully registers to service agent, service agent
will update the available measurement list. Service agent
also updates the available measurement list when a privacy
measurement service becomes unavailable. Once the available
measurement list is updated, service agent will notify plan
maker to update the privacy measurement plan.
C. Protect Privacy
The goal of privacy protection strategies is to confuse
cloud services so that sensitive user information will not
be inferred from the usage data. Strategy suggester collects
privacy protection strategies that can work on a speciﬁc type
of usage data. Taking GPS data as an example, the user can
turn off the GPS sensor, change his route, or use a privacy
protection service to insert fake GPS data into his usage data.
Strategy suggester provides possible protection strategies (8)
according to the type of usage data that causes the privacy
leakage. Regarding more than one privacy leakages, the user
can apply several protection strategies at the same time. The
effect of the applied strategies will be reﬂected in the results
of future privacy measurements. The user can tune and change
the privacy protection strategies until he is satisﬁed with the
results.
V.
CASE STUDIES
GPS data is common in the usage data exposed to cloud
services. The case studies demonstrate not only that extra user
sensitive information will be leaked from the GPS data, but
also the ways that iGuard assists user in detecting the leakages
and ﬁxing them. To make the case studies as real as possible,
real telecommunications service usage data with user’s GPS
locations is used to simulate the user’s usage data exposed
to a location-based cloud service. The telecommunications
service usage data is provided by Mr. Malte Spitz, a German
Green Party politician and Executive Committee member. He
acquired the usage data from his telecommunications service
provider. The usage data can be downloaded on ZEIT On-
line [18]. This data set was collected from August 2009 to
February 2010, and contained 30,374 location-based usage
data. It is assumed that the location-based service collects the
user’s GPS locations to provides contextual information for
him, such as the weather, trafﬁc conditions, nearby restau-
rants which are open, etc. It is assumed that this location-
based service always runs in the background and collects the
user’s locations regularly to update the contextual information.
The user can also actively query the location-based service
for further information. When the user is actively using the
location-based service, his locations will be collected more
frequently than normal. So, the behavior of the location-based
service in collecting the user’s GPS locations is close to the
telecommunications service. The location-based usage data of
the telecommunications service is used to simulate the usage
data collected by the location-based service. In the case studies,
iGuard is applied to eliminate the privacy issues which result
from exposing the user’s personal schedules and home address
to the location-based service.
At the beginning, iGuard makes the privacy measure-
ment plan, as shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3, two privacy
measurements which aim at GPS data are selected. One is
for detecting personal schedule leakage, and the other is
for detecting user’s home address leakage from the exposed
GPS data. For each privacy measurement, the type of the
target usage data, the cloud service which the usage data is
exposed to, the frequency to perform the privacy measurement,
and the privacy measurement service which is in charge to
perform the privacy measurement are displayed. Currently,
those two privacy measurement services are implemented by
authors as third-party privacy measurement services. If the user
unchecks the box before a privacy measurement, the privacy
measurement will not be performed. Results of these two
privacy measurements are shown in the following.
A. Case 1: Personal Schedule Leakages
Since the location-based service is frequently used in the
user’s daily life, user’s usage frequency reﬂects his personal

schedule, especially the sleep time. The user will not use the
location-based service when he is sleeping. A time duration
that the usage frequency is steady but relatively low can be the
user’s sleep time. This privacy measurement checks the number
of usage data transmissions to the location-based service in
each hour of a day to ﬁnd possible sleep time leakages. The
privacy measurement is performed once a day and takes usage
data of the whole day as the input. In fact, the measurement
results of the usage data for each day from August 2009 to
February 2010 are similar. The sleep time is leaked almost
every day from the usage frequency of the service. In this case
study, the usage data on 09-03-2009 is selected as the example
to demonstrate the privacy leakage, as shown in Figure 4. In
the measurement results, there is a relatively low and steady
curve in the time duration 1:00-8:59, which is a hint for the
sleep time leakage. Below the measurement results, privacy
protection strategies for GPS data are suggested. If the user
selects to insert noises to his future usage data to change his
service usage frequency, iGuard will suggest corresponding
privacy protection services that are available to assist the
user in completing the work. In this work, a noise inserting
service is implemented to assist user in inserting noises to his
usage data. The service inserts noises that are similar to the
normal usage data [11]. The new measurement results are show
in Figure 5. The measurement results show that the privacy
leakage is eliminated by the strategy.

Most people stay at home to sleep at night. If the user’s
locations in sleep time are exposed to cloud services, his home
address is likely to be exposed, too. This privacy measurement
checks the user’s locations exposed to the cloud service in
sleep time for possible home address leakages. The privacy
measurement is performed every three days according to the
privacy measurement plan. The user is assumed to be sleeping

culates the percentage which the user stays at a location in the
period of time. In this case study, the usage data from 09-10-
2009 to 09-12-2009 is used as an example to demonstrate the
home address leakage, as shown in Figure 6. The measurement
results show that the user only stays at one location during the
sleep time of these three days. The location can indicate the
user’s home address. The user can select to insert noises with
fake GPS data when he is at home. The fake GPS data is
mixed with real ones and the percentage of fake data can even
be higher than real data. As a result, the user can mislead the
location-based service to wrong home address information so
that the home address leakage can be prevented.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
iGuard plays the role of a mediator, which links available
privacy measurements and privacy protection strategies to
the user. According to the user’s personal situation, iGuard
performs customized privacy measurements for the user and
suggests workable strategies to protect his privacy. In the user’s
view, the user will enjoy comprehensive privacy detection and
protection as available privacy measurements and protection
strategies linked to iGuard extend. In the view of providers for
services of privacy measurement and privacy protection, they
beneﬁt from increasing users of their services. iGuard creates
a win-win situation for both of users and service providers
handling privacy issues.
In the future, iGuard will be extended for various user
devices, such as smart home systems in Internet of Things
(IoT), and assist users in managing their privacy for all devices
in use. iGuard will provide users a comprehensive protection
strategy that considers users’ personal preferences and handles
all privacy issues caused by using the devices. Thus users can
enjoy simple and effective way to keep their privacy while
utilizing all services through various devices.
