Abstract— The Internet is now heavily relied upon by the Critical
Infrastructures (CI). This has led to different security threats
facing interconnected security systems. By understanding the
complexity of critical infrastructure interdependency, and how to
take advantage of it in order to minimize the cascading problem,
enables the prediction of potential problems before they happen.
Our proposed system, detailed in this paper, is able to detect
cyber-attacks and share the knowledge with interconnected
partners to create an immune system network. In order to
demonstrate our approach, a realistic simulation is used to
construct data and evaluate the system put forward. This paper
provides a summary of the work to-date, on the development of a
system titled Critical Infrastructure Auto-Immune Response
System (CIAIRS). It provides a view of the main CIAIRS
segments, which comprise the framework and illustrates the
functioning of the system.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The role of one infrastructure influences the functioning of
others.
This
can
be
referred
to
as
interdependency.
Interdependency is considered the main challenges for Critical
Infrastructures (CI). Operating as a mutually interdependent
network, treated as a system of systems, failures and successful
cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a cascading effect.
Understanding the interconnectivity behaviour between the
critical infrastructures, and how it changes depending on the
complexity, can reduce the effect before cascading occurs.
Moreover, this would control the damage and limit the impact
[1].
The risk of cascading failure among distributed systems is
the main influential factor behind this research. To date, our
previous work has involved creating a support system against
cyber-attacks, using the human immune system mechanism as
inspiration for the design [2]. The system is titled Critical
Infrastructure Auto-Immune Response System (CIAIRS); in
this paper, the framework for CIAIRS is presented. The
operation process and design for CIAIRS is discussed, along
with the evaluation of CIAIRS using a simulation testbed. The
simulation is established using a professional plant simulator,
where realistic data is constructed through its operation. The
data is subsequently used to further our investigation into a
support framework for distributed and interconnected systems
[2] [3].
Simulation
is
considered
to
be
a
key role
in
the
advancement of critical infrastructure protection. Currently,
there are some simulation programs, which contain smart built-
in models for many common real systems. These programs can
be used to test new security techniques within a safe
environment. Specifically, simulation test beds can be used to
analyse the inputs and outputs and do all the required
challenging work and give realistic and comprehensive results.
In addition, simulations are not held back by the use of real-
time data construction and can carry out complex models of
operation in a relatively short period of time. As such,
it is
becoming a common technique for the testing of cyber-attack
prevention measures and for improving the level of the security
techniques
[4].
A
large
critical
infrastructure
can
be
represented by creating a simple system and allow for realistic
testing to take place [5].
Within this paper, realistic data constructed from a
simulation of 8 critical infrastructures is presented in order to
test the CIAIRS system. Furthermore, the big data analysis
techniques used to identify patterns of abnormal behaviour and
share threats between infrastructures are detailed. As such, the
remainder of the paper is divided as follows: Section 2,
presents a background on Critical Infrastructures (CI), CI
modelling and highlights the important of the simulation.
Section 3 introduces the CIAIRS framework components and
an overview of the system route. Subsequently, Section 4
contains the evaluation of the system. Finally, Section 5 will
conclude the paper.

BACKGROUND

and its interdependency characteristics is put forward. The
focus
is
on
the
interdependency
between
the
critical
infrastructures and a number of modeling examples are
discussed.

A. Critical Infrastructures Interdependency
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
defines critical infrastructures as any physical or virtual
systems
that
would affect
the
national
security,
public
economy and health service by their failure or if damage
occurred to them [6]. Critical infrastructure assets, as explained
by Command et al., and can be divided into three categories
[7]. Firstly, the physical assets, which could be tangible or
intangible.
Secondly,
human
assets,
that
can
represent
vulnerabilities by having privileged access to important
information or systems. Thirdly, cyber assets, which include
hardware, software, data, and which all, serve the network
functionality.
Infrastructure is the main source of development and
economic construction process of any country [8]. Different
types of urban developments depend on the size and the
provision of infrastructure elements, which help guide the
development
of
new
areas.
Critical
infrastructures
are
considered to be the head of the development process and the
driving
force
behind
economic
construction.
Urban
development depends on the size and the provision of
infrastructure elements of style, which contributes to guiding
the development of new areas. However, many infrastructures,
such as power plants, are considerably outdated and are
therefore difficult to repair [6]. This means that disruptions in
service provision and weaknesses in security are apparent.
Yusufovna et al., discuss energy resources, finance, food,
health,
government
services,
manufacturing,
law
and
legislation, transportation [9]. As Yusufovna et al. discussed,
there is a risk of these security weaknesses causing failures,
which can cascade across borders. For example, they present a
survey on different groups of critical infrastructure and detail
how many are international and national as well as local and
individual. This means that any successful attack may have a
political and economic impact, which spams across borders.
As previously discussed, in the result of the global
expansion, and with the Internet revolution, infrastructures
have
become
highly
complex
and
have
increased
the
interdependency at the physical and network layers. Therefore,
the interdependency is considered to be one characteristic that
can raise several concerns; in particular
the analysis and
modelling
of
interdependencies
due
to
the
complicated
interactions
[10][11].
For
that
reason,
accurate
critical
infrastructure modelling techniques are imperative for the
testing of new security metrics.
B. CI Modelling
Depending on the infrastructure type, the task of an
accurate modelling is a challenge. This has led to develop
simulation programs that can help diagnose infrastructure
weaknesses and simulate their behaviours and interactions.
This includes software, such as Tecnomatix [12], and the
adaptation of existing software-based simulators, such as
OMNET++, Simulink and Matlab [13], just to name a few.
These simulators allow for affordable representations of
critical infrastructure systems, by modelling their behaviour,
interactions and the integration of their specific protocol types
such as Modbus and DNP3.
The interest in simulation has increased as an appropriate
and effective education process in recent years. Simulation has
become a process to test concepts, activities, and experiments
done through the computer. It has an increasingly important
and
prominent
role
in
the
cyber-security
and
critical
infrastructure educational process [14]. Al-essa et al., defines
simulation as
a method for teaching students that
bring
elements from the real world, overriding difficulties such as
material cost or human resources [15]. For that reason, the
system proposed in this paper is evaluated through a simulation
testbed rather than through a real-world application.
C. A Cyber Framework for CI
Simulations helped in enhancing the security level by using
new framework concepts. For example, the NIST developed a
framework to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks to critical
infrastructure [16]. The NIST framework includes sets of
procedures and methodologies that help to understand the
cyber
risks.
Moreover,
the
approach
involves
flexible,
classified, performance-based, and cost-effective method with
more security measures. Finally, the framework helps the
possessor and specialist of the critical infrastructure to
recognize, classify, assess and control the cyber risk
[16].
Specifically, the NIST cybersecurity framework has been set
up to strengthen security through the following:
•
Diagnose the security status of a system.
•
Mend and form a cyber-security program.
•
Detect new chances for new or known standard.
•
Support the critical infrastructure organisation, to use
the
cyber-security
framework
with
tools
and
technologies.
Critical infrastructures have benefited from the NIST
cybersecurity framework. This has been recognised by some
notable improvements, such as reducing the time of starting the
security program, reduce the risk by recognize the improving
areas in the program and improving the efficient relationship
between law and critical infrastructure [16].
Depending on the previous different frameworks and more
which were used in order to improve the critical infrastructure
level of security the next section will present our framework.
III.
APPROACH FOR CIAIRS
In our research to date, a system framework titled Critical
Infrastructure
Auto-Immune
Response
System
(CIAIRS),
which is able to identify threats to a network and communicate
the potential impact, has been put forward [2]. The quality of
the framework depends on four main features: Simplicity,
Clarity, Boundaries, Expandability [17]. Therefore, these
features were taken in mind while forming the research
approach.
CIAIRS functionality relies on identifying attacks, then the
system assists and guides critical infrastructures on how to
behave when abnormal behavior is detected. Furthermore,
inspired by the human immune system characteristic the
information is then shared to other infrastructures to create an
immune system network [2]. In the following sub-sections, the
CIAIRS structure is presented along with a detailed account of
the various components, which work together to predict the
abnormal behaviours and share them with other infrastructures.
Then, high level of the CIARIS process is presented. Finally, a
simulation of 8 critical infrastructures is presented to construct
data for the evaluation of CIARIS.

A.
CIAIRS Design Overview
Fig. 1 indicates the CIAIRS framework design and the
interaction between the various modules, which function
together to perform the security and communication services.
The module linked together comprises the system as a whole
and works together in order to detect abnormal behaviours in
one infrastructure and share them with others. In doing so the
aim is to prevent cyber-attacks from having a cascading impact
and spreading to other infrastructures. Threat information can
be communicated to allow operators in other infrastructures to
take appropriate measures to prevent an attack having an
impact.

Figure 1.
CIAIRS Design
CIAIRS
is
composed
of
several
mechanisms,
interconnected processes and a data collection modules. The
different components that form the system, and the flow
between the components, are displayed in Fig. 1. By extracting
the data from the network, which, for the purposes of this
research, is provided by the simulation, the data manager is
responsible
for
controlling
the
intake
of
information.
Extracting the data in blocks prevents overload of the system.
Subsequently, the data passes through a cleaning process to
make sure there is no missing information; this stage called the
Data Preparation stage. At this point, the data needs to have
features extracted and be analysed. The features correspond to
the system behaviour and present the behaviour in a simplified
view of the overall network.
By using the features, a data classification process is
involved in order to indicate the normal and the abnormal
behaviour. In order to compare the attack type, the data is sent
to a temporary database until needed. Each block of data is
stored as a block of column data, which would help in
comparing the CI data collection to the CI database.
Depending
on
the
decision,
the
network
uses
the
connectivity between infrastructures to share the new abnormal
behaviour with interconnected partners. This would assist other
infrastructure in planning for an emerging attack or cascading
impact. At all times an administrator overviews the system
functionality. This whole process is clarified further in the next
subsection, which presents two key module components from
the
CIAIRS
design.
The
Data
Manager
and
the
Communication Manager are explained in detail.

CIAIRS Data Manager
Fig. 2 presents a Data Flow Diagram for the CIAIRS

CIAIRS Communication
Fig. 3 presents the communication process for sharing
attacks information between the different partners. This is one
of the novelties of the design. After identifying abnormal
behavior in one of the critical infrastructures, the attack
information and characteristics are shared with interconnected
partners in order to prevent cascading failures. After indicating

starts by checking the connectivity list in order to send an
inherited script to the connected infrastructure.

information from features, ID and source are compared to the
data source of each interconnectivity CI. By comparing the

indicator

information cell and adds to the database. Base on the result an
action of recommendation is distributed order to suggest the
right reaction for any future attacks.

B. CIAIRS Simulation
In order to evaluate the discussed system design, as
simulation testbed is constructed. Fig. 4 presents an emulation
of
8 critical
infrastructures,
which include
key service
providers, such as an Electricity Grid and Water Distribution
service. The full simulation is outlined in our past work [2][3].
Each of the critical infrastructure systems is given a graphical
icon to represent its function more clearly. They can be
expanded within the simulation, to show the different objects,
which comprise the system as a whole.
Fig. 5 displays one of the presented critical infrastructures:
The Water Distribution System. The Water Distributed System
consists of a main water resource, the sea, a main electricity
cable from the power plant and a transport system to send the
water through pipes and feed both the houses in the compound
and a factory. The Water Distribution System is controlled by a
FlowControl to pump the water for both the Houses and the
Factory, divided equally.
Figure 4.
Simulation Overview
Figure 5.
Water Distribution System
The experiments detailed in Section 3 are used to evaluate
the proposed system, form the process layout and construct the
product lifecycle management. As such, the evaluation is
presented in the following section.
IV.
EVALUATION
This section presents the evaluation process for CIAIRS.
The evaluation can be either formative or summative [18]. A
formative evaluation takes place during the project itself. On
the other hand, a summative evaluation takes place after the
project is done in order to assess if the outcomes met the aim
of the project [18]. Therefore, a summative evaluation is used
to improve the service within the CI’s. The system is evaluated
using data constructed through a simulation of a network of
critical infrastructures. Data analysis is conducted using data
visualisation to identify system anomalies and demonstrate that
models of behaviour can be constructed and shared with other
infrastructures.
In order to reach the aim of the research, two critical
infrastructures
are
chosen
as
a
case
study,
the
Water
Distribution System and the Electricity Grid. The impact on
service provision to a housing compound is illustrated. The
trends in data patterns for both normal and abnormal behaviour
can be identified and communicated to prevent future impacts.
The first phase is data collection that conducts with a
sampling rate of 4 Hertz (which is every 0.25 of a second).
Blocks of data are extracted to prevent data overload and to
support building the features from both normal and abnormal
datasets [3]. In the next subsection, a data sample is presented,
26

data trends and a statistical production report for one of the
CIAIRS infrastructures is also provided as an example.
A. Data Sample
In order to understand the behaviour of the system, two
data
sets are
constructed from
The
Water Distribution
Infrastructure System. A normal system set constructed from a
two days simulation. Then faults were introduced to the system
as abnormal behaviours in order to construct a dataset of the
system under attack. For this paper, a fault is introduced into
the water pipe 1 and the water pipe connected to the houses
compound inside the water distributed critical infrastructure.
Tables I and II display data samples from normal behaviour
mode and the abnormal mode in the Water Distribution
Infrastructure, consecutively.

The simulation consists of 147 components in total. The
numbers in the tables represent the units, which flow in the
water pipe. It is clear that the between the time 1:10:59:14:50
to 1:10:59:15:50 the level of the water was fluctuated.
B. Data Trends
Based on the data collected, a number of features were
extracted
from
both
normal
and
abnormal
behaviours.
However, for the purpose of this paper, The Water Distribution
Infrastructure system relative standard deviation (RSD) was
chosen to indicate the change in behavioural patterns between
normal and abnormal, which is displayed in Fig. 6. RSD is a
statistical trend that helps in indicating how far the data from
the mean and measure the distance for every value from the
mean in order to employ the quality assurance. Fig. 6 displays
the relative standard deviation for data trend for the Water
Distribution Infrastructure with normal and one signal and two
failures: water pipe 1 and the water pipe connected to the
houses
compound
inside
the
water
distributed
critical
infrastructure.
Figure 6.
The normal and abnormal RSD Water Distribution
Fig. 6 clarifies the difference between the water rate in a
normal system and a failure system with two failures in water
pipe 1 and the water pipe connected to the houses compound
inside the water distributed infrastructure. The red line, with
squares, presents the abnormal behaviour trend while the blue,
with diamonds, presents the normal behaviour trend. It is clear
that the data does not follow a normal distribution. Moreover,
that the failures had a significant impact on the water pipe from
the
Water
Distribution
Infrastructure
system
to
Houses
component in the Water Distribution Infrastructure system
more than any other component.
V.
STATISTICAL PRODUCTION REPORT
As the previous subsection presents, the data trends
between the normal and abnormal behaviour can be seen. It is
this information which can be commutated using CIARIS to
interconnected infrastructures. In this case, the faults in the
system have affected the percentage of the production for some
components in different CI.
TABLE III
THE NORMAL PRODUCTION STATISTICAL REPORT FOR THE
WATER DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE
By comparing Tables III and IV, which show the statistical
service production report, it is clear that the production of the
electricity in the houses hains dropped from 71.75% to 61.19%
and the production of the electricity in the factory also
decreased by 10%. The result indicates that the attacks, which
accrued in the Water Distribution Infrastructure faults, have

CONCLUSION
The development and evaluation of CIAIRS are presented
in this paper. The simulation put forward can be used to create
substantial datasets. Critical infrastructure interconnectivity is
one of the main challenges. Systems such as CIAIRS can assist
to countering the growing cyber-threats and the risk of
cascading
failures.
This
paper
presented
the
CIAIRS’s
framework. The various components and mechanisms were
highlighted in order to present the role of the CIAIRS, which
shares information with other infrastructures, using the human
immune system as a reference model, to create a distributed
support network for enhanced cyber-security.
