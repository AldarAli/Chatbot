Abstract—Applications in security and electronic surveillance 
require a combination of excellent magnetic softness with good 
mechanical 
and 
anti-corrosive 
properties 
and 
low 
dimensionality. We overviewed the feasibility of using glass-
coated microwires for electronic article surveillance and 
security applications, as well as different routes of tuning the 
magnetic properties of individual microwires or microwires 
arrays making them quite attractive for electronic article 
surveillance and security applications. We provide the routes 
for tuning the hysteresis loops non-linearity by the magne-
tostatic interaction between the microwires in the arrays of 
different types of amorphous microwires. The presence of 
neighboring microwire (either Fe or Co-based) significantly 
affects the hysteresis loop of the whole microwires array. In a 
microwires array containing magnetically bistable microwires, 
we observed splitting of the initially rectangular hysteresis loop 
with a number of Barkhausen jumps correlated with the 
number of magnetically bistable microwires. Essentially, non-
linear and irregular hysteresis loops have been observed in 
mixed arrays containing Fe and Co-rich microwires. The 
obtained non-linearity in hysteresis loops allowed to increase 
the harmonics and tune their magnetic field dependencies. On 
the other hand, several routes allowing to tune the switching 
field by either post-processing or modifying the magnetoelastic 
anisotropy have been reviewed. The observed unique 
combination of magnetic properties together with thin 
dimensions and excellent mechanical and anti-corrosive 
properties provide excellent perspectives for the use of glass-
coated microwires for security and electronic surveillance 
applications. 
 Keywords- magnetic microwires; magnetic softness; magnetic 
bistability, magnetic tags. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
 
Soft magnetic materials are highly demanded by several 
industries, including (but not limited to) microelectronics, 
electrical engineering, car, aerospace and aircraft industries, 
medicine, magnetic refrigerators, home entertainment, 
energy harvesting and conversion, informatics, magnetic 
recording or security and electronic surveillance [1]-[2]. In 
most cases, like the case of security and electronic 
surveillance, in addition to excellent magnetic softness, a 
combination of mechanical and anti-corrosive properties 
and low dimensionality is required [3].  
Almost all department stores, supermarkets, airports, 
libraries, museums, etc. are provided with different types of 
security and anti-theft systems. The principle of Electronic 
Article Surveillance (EAS) systems operation is well 
established: articles are provided with tags that respond to 
electromagnetic fields generated by the gates at the 
store/supermarket/library exits [3]. The response is picked 
up by the antenna installed on the gate, switching on the 
alarm. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of such 
EAS systems have been installed and millions of tags are 
produced daily. Considering the great number of tags, they 
must be small, robust enough and inexpensive. Additionally, 
the magnetic materials employed in tags must be 
magnetically soft enough. The magnetic softness of 
crystalline soft magnetic materials (Permalloy, Fe-Si) is 
affected by processing. Therefore, amorphous soft magnetic 
materials, prepared by rapid melt quenching are considered 
as among the most suitable materials for tags containing soft 
magnetic materials [3][4].   
Indeed, as a rule, amorphous materials present excellent 
magnetic softness together with superior mechanical 
properties [3]-[6]. Abrupt deterioration of the mechanical 
properties (such as tensile yield) upon the devitrification of 
amorphous precursor is reported [6]. Additionally, the 
fabrication process of amorphous materials involving rapid 
melt quenching is fast and inexpensive [1]-[7]. Accordingly, 
amorphous soft magnetic materials are useful for the design 
of robust magnetic devices and magnetoelastic sensors [8]-
[12].  
As discussed elsewhere, soft magnetic materials with 
squared hysteresis loops and relatively low coercivities are 
the preferred candidates for the EAS systems using 
magnetic tags [3]. The rectangular hysteresis loops can be 
easily implemented in different families of amorphous 
magnetic wires [4]. Therefore, considerable attention has

been paid to applications of amorphous wires for magnetic 
tags for different kinds of EAS systems [4]. 
The aforementioned squared hysteresis loops of 
magnetic wires are linked to the peculiar remagnetization 
process of magnetic wires running through a single and 
large Barkhausen jump [4] [14].  
Glass-coated magnetic microwires prepared by the so-
called Taylor-Ulitovsky technique present the widest 
metallic nucleus diameters range (from 200 nm up to 100 
μm) [4][15][16]. In this way, the Taylor-Ulitovsky method 
is the unique technique allowing fabrication of nanowires by 
rapid melt quenching [15]. On the other hand, the 
preparation of amorphous magnetic wires with diameter of 
about 100 μm coated by glass has recently been reported 
[16]. The presence of a flexible, thin, bio-compatible and 
insulating glass coating allows to enhance the corrosive 
resistance and, therefore, makes these microwires suitable 
for novel applications including biomedicine, electronic 
article surveillance, non-destructive monitoring external 
stimuli (stresses, temperature) in smart composites or 
construction health monitoring through the microwire 
inclusions [17][18].  
Accordingly, 
considering 
dimensionality 
and 
combination of physical properties (magnetic, mechanical, 
corrosive), amorphous soft magnetic microwires are 
potentially 
suitable 
materials 
for 
electronic 
article 
surveillance and security applications [4][19][20]. There are 
several original papers dealing with rather different (multi-
bit or single-bit) security and EAS applications of magnetic 
microwires [19][20]. In this paper, we will provide an 
overview of the trends related to EAS and security 
applications of glass-coated magnetic microwires. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the 
experimental 
methods 
as 
well 
as 
the 
microwires 
characteristics analyzed in this paper are provided. Section 3 
deals with results on the feasibility of using magnetic 
microwires for magnetic tags followed by an overview of 
tuning of hysteresis loop non-linearity by the magnetostatic 
interaction between microwires. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM DETAILS 
Generally, we analyzed two different types of magnetic 
amorphous microwires: i) amorphous microwires with high 
positive magnetostriction coefficients, λs, (Fe-Si-B-C, Fe-
Ni-Si-B-C or Fe-Ni-Si-B) and ii) amorphous microwires 
with vanishing λs (Co-Fe-Ni-B-Si-Mo, Co-Fe-Ni-B-Si-Mo, 
Co-Fe-B-Si-Cr-Ni 
or 
Co-Fe-B-Si-C). 
We 
studied 
microwires with metallic nucleus diameters, d, ranging from 
10 up to 100 m prepared using the Taylor-Ulitovsky 
method described elsewhere [4][21]. The Taylor-Ulitovsky 
method allows preparation of thinnest metallic wires (with 
typical diameters of the order of 0.1 to 100 μm) covered by 
an insulating glass coating [5][21].  
The amorphous structure of all the microwires has been 
proved by the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) method. Typically, 
the crystallization of amorphous microwires was observed at 
Tann ≥ 500 °C [4]. 
The induction method has previously been used for the 
hysteresis loops measurements. The details of the 
experimental set-up are described elsewhere [22]. The 
hysteresis loops were represented as the magnetic field, H, 
dependence of the normalized magnetization, M/M0, being 
M - the magnetic moment at a given magnetic field, and M0 
the magnetic moment at the maximum magnetic field 
amplitude Hm. Such hysteresis loops are useful for 
comparison of the samples with different chemical 
compositions 
(and, 
hence, 
different 
saturation 
magnetization). 
In several cases, the hysteresis loops were measured with 
a conventional Super-conducting Quantum Interference 
Device (SQUID).  
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Magnetic 
tags 
applications 
require 
a 
non-linear 
hysteresis loop that contains the characteristic distribution of 
harmonic frequencies. It is believed that the steeper the 
magnetization reversal, the higher the harmonic content of 
the signal. Accordingly, perfectly rectangular hysteresis 
loops with low coercivity observed in Fe-rich microwires 
(Figure 1) are attractive for use as magnetic tags. 
On the other hand, the non-linearity of the hysteresis 
loop of the magnetic microwires can be further improved 
using the magnetostatic interaction of microwires. Below, 
we will present several experimental results on magnetic 
response 
of 
two 
kinds 
of 
individual 
microwires 
(Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5M0.6 and Fe74B13Si11C2) as well as 
the arrays containing either microwires of the same type or 
arrays containing two different kinds of microwires. 
The hysteresis loops of such microwires are rather 
different: Fe74B13Si11C2 microwire with high and positive 
magnetostriction coefficient, λ s, exhibits perfectly 
rectangular hysteresis loops with Hc ≈ 100 A/m (Figure 
1a), while and inclined hysteresis loop with quite low Hc 
(Hc ≈ 5 A/m) is observed in Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5M0.6  
microwire (see Figure 2b).  
The hysteresis loop of an array containing two 
Fe74B13Si11C2 microwires is rather different from that of a 
single Fe74B13Si11C2 microwire. Two Barkhausen jumps can 
be observed at magnetic field amplitude, H0>80 A/m (see 
Figure 3a). Such peculiar hysteresis loop shape has been 
explained considering the magnetostatic interaction in the 
two-microwire array [4]. Such magnetostatic interaction is a 
consequence of stray fields created by magnetically bistable 
microwires: the superposition of external and stray fields 
causes magnetization reversal in one of the samples, when 
the external field is below the switching field of a single 
microwire. A single rectangular hysteresis loop (similar to 
the case of single microwire shown in Figure 1) is observed 
for 60 A/m <H0 < 80 A/m (see Figure 3b).

Increasing the magnetic field amplitude (approximately 
at H0 > 250 A/m), this splitting of the hysteresis loop 
disappears (Figure 3b). Such dependence of the hysteresis 
loop of two microwires array can be understood from the 
counterbalance between the dH/dt and the switching time 
determined by the velocity of the DW propagation along the 
whole wire [4].  
As discussed elsewhere [4], coercivity, Hc, is also 
affected by the frequency, f. Accordingly, Hc, as well as 
overall hysteresis loops of two microwires array, are 
affected by f in a similar way as by H0 (see Figure 3b). For a 
two microwires array, two-steps hysteresis loops are 
observed for f< 150 Hz. At f > 150 Hz, the hysteresis loop 
splitting disappears, and at 150 < f <1000 Hz, a single 
smooth magnetization jump is observed.

Accordingly, the odd and even harmonics of the signal 
of two Fe-rich microwires array are affected by H0 and f 
(see Figure 3c,d). 
A sharp increase in the harmonics amplitudes is 
observed when H0 exceeds Hc (see Figures 3c,d). The even 
harmonics amplitudes are significantly inferior to the odd 
harmonics amplitudes. The field dependences of odd 
harmonics have a "plateau" between 60 and 90 A/m, which 
reflects the hysteresis loops splitting (see Figure 3a).  
Another example of tuning the non-linearity of 
hysteresis loops and harmonics is the magnetostatic 
interaction of microwires with different character of 
hysteresis loops. Rather non-linear hysteresis loops can be 
obtained 
in 
an 
array 
consisting 
of 
one 
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5M0.6 
and 
one 
Fe74B13Si11C2 
microwires (see Figure 4a). In such array, at H0 <90 A/m 
(which corresponds to Hc of Fe74B13Si11C2 microwire) the 
hysteresis loops character is typical of those for a single 
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5M0.6 microwire. Essentially, non-
linear hysteresis loops have been observed at H0 >110 A/m 
(Figure 4a). Such peculiar hysteresis loops can be 
interpreted as the superposition of two hysteresis loops: one 
from magnetically bistable Fe74B13Si11C2 microwire (shown 
in 
Figure 
2a) 
and 
the 
other 
one 
from 
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5M0.6 microwire with linear hysteresis 
loop (shown in Figure 2b).  
The peculiar hysteresis loop character at H0 ≤ 120 A/m 
can be explained by the partial magnetization reversal of the 
magnetically bistable wire under the influence of the stray 
field from the Co-based wire. The stray field is affected by 
the 
sample 
demagnetizing 
factor 
and 
the 
sample 
magnetization [23] [24]. In the case of Co-rich microwire 
the magnetization and hence, the stray field are affected by 
the applied magnetic field (as can be appreciated from the 
hysteresis loops shown in Figure 2b). In contrast, the 
magnetization of Fe-rich sample change by abrupt jump and 
below and above Hc is almost independent of the magnetic 
field (see Figure 2a).  
Accordingly, such microwire array consisting of two 
microwires (Fe-rich and Co-rich) with different hysteresis 
loops presents odd and even harmonics quite different from 
the case of the array with two Fe-rich microwires (see 
Figures 4 b,c). A single sharp jump of odd and even 
harmonics is observed at H0≈Hc. There is also a change in 
the odd and even harmonics in the weak (H0<Hc) field 
region (see Figures 4 b, c). 
Thus, the use of arrays consisting of magnetic 
microwires allows us to create a complex and unique 
spectrum of magnetic harmonics in magnetic microwires. 
Essentially, non-linear and irregular hysteresis loops 
have been observed in mixed arrays containing Fe and Co-
rich microwires. The observed non-linear hysteresis loops 
allowed to increase the harmonics and to tune their magnetic 
field dependencies. 
The aforementioned examples provide the routes for 
optimization of the response of magnetic microwires by 
tuning the non-linearity of the hysteresis loops through the 
magnetostatic interaction. Such magnetic microwires can 
easily be incorporated into magnetic tags capable to respond 
to magnetic fields generated by the gates at the 
store/supermarket/library exits.  
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this paper, we showed that the presence of a 
neighbouring 
microwire 
(either 
Fe- 
or 
Co-based) 
significantly affects the hysteresis loop of the whole 
microwires array. In a microwires array containing 
magnetically bistable microwires, we observed splitting of 
the initially rectangular hysteresis loop with a number of 
Barkhausen jumps correlated with the number of 
magnetically bistable microwires. Essentially, non-linear 
and irregular hysteresis loops have been observed in mixed

non-linear hysteresis loops allowed to increase the 
harmonics and to tune their magnetic field dependencies.  
 
The observed unique combination of magnetic 
properties, together with thin dimensions and excellent 
mechanical and anti-corrosive properties, provide excellent 
perspectives for the use of glass-coated microwires for 
security and electronic surveillance applications.
