Abstract: Sensing of cow functional state of fertility is 
important for the cattle and diary industries. Usual medical 
techniques, like the hormone test in urine or milk and the 
liquid based cytology, are not ideal when farm environment is 
considered and there is a need to develop improved methods. 
The method presented in this paper is based on fiber optic 
capillaries techniques using neural network analysis. We have 
investigated the vaginal fluids of healthy cows and of those 
suffering from vaginits and have proved that the method 
allows establishing the estrous state and distinguishing between 
healthy and sick animals. We present the experimental setup 
and analyze various aspects of the sensor design and operation 
principle with special consideration to the ANN part. The 
results of the measured signals analysis of ANN training 
showed a correlation of 0.987 for estrus and 0.986 for the 
classification of functional state of fertile phase. The proposed 
sensor introduced automatically precise information of 
possible vaginitis obtained by establishing the presence of 
antibodies in the vaginal fluid.  
Keywords: cow estrous detection; cow vaginitis detection; 
leukocytes detection; fiber optic sensors, fiber optic capillary 
sensors.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The estrous cycle of cows has been investigated with 
increasing intensity in the recent years [1-8]. Nowadays, the 
estrous cycles of cows are often resynchronized [9]. Methods 
of fertile phase of estrus detection are under continuous 
investigation and improvement [10-18]. Mathematical, 
methods and methods using fuzzy logic have also been in 
development [19-20]. Of interest are methods using 
radiotelemetry [21] and the future may well see mobile radio 
networks being used for monitoring [22], in which case the 
energy consumption is an issue [23].  
The state of the art of estrus cycle determination was 
presented in a comparison of four methods for detection of 
estrus in dairy cows with resynchronized by artificial 
insemination estrus cycles by Cavalieri et al. [24]. In that 
study the sensitivity and predictive values of pedometers, 
radiotelemetric transmitters (HeatWatch) tail-paint and heat-
mount detectors were compared. The semi-laboratory 
method based on measuring the milk progesterone 
concentration was used as the reference standard for cows 
being in estrus. Sensitivity was defined as the percentage of 
estrus cows detected to the number of cows in estrus and the 
positive predictive value as the number of correct detections 
divided by the sum of correct and false positive detections. 
The conclusion was that all four methods gave over 80% of 
the sensitivity, with the pedometer method scoring lowest at 
81.4% and the tail-paint method scoring highest at 91.3%. In 
terms of positive predictive value, the results were closer and 
ranged from 87.5% for the pedometer method to 100% for 
the radiotelemetry method, with the other two methods 
showing about 92% predictive value [24]. 
An important problem of cow reproduction is keeping the 
health of the vaginal duct. These are known methods of 
veterinary medicine used for that purpose, but they are not 
automated and when the vaginal changes are visible the 
illness is usually seriously advanced. Moreover, the bacterial 
vaginitis can be in its initial and hidden state invisible [25]. 
Therefore, we set ourselves the following objectives: 
• 
To investigate and develop a sensor which would 
provide the information of functional state of fertility 
useable to make decisions on insemination of the 
cows with a significantly higher sensitivity than the 
existing field methods, 
• 
To develop a sensor which also could be operated in 
the farm environment, not only in laboratory 
environment, 
• 
A developing a method that would yield itself easily 
to automation, miniaturization and be of low cost, 
• 
To evaluate and further optimize the technology of 
fiber optic capillary sensors with artificial neural 
network analysis of data from the point of view of 
the above main objectives.

SENSOR SET-UP 
A. Principle of sensor work 
In this work we present new developments and advances 
on intelligent photonic sensors and their applications 
working on the principle of monitoring optical intensity 
changes that take place in dynamically forced measurement 
cycles that were first postulated in [26]. The sensors use fiber 
optic capillaries in which the phase of the filling liquid 
changes locally to gas when forced by local heating, while 
the propagation of light across the capillary is monitored, 
Fig. 1. Therefore, the sensors examine simultaneously many 
liquid parameters which are then processed in artificial 
neural networks [27]. When analyzing biological fluids, in 
order to achieve good reproducibility and to avoid cross-
contamination from sample to sample, it is advantageous to 
use disposable optrodes. The low cost of capillaries make 
their disposability practically possible [28].  
Before the test the capillary optrode is partially filed with 
liquid, after which both its ends are closed. Care must be 
taken that there are no bubbles of gas present after filling the 
optrode; otherwise the optrode has to be eliminated from the 
tests [29]. When the capillaries are filled uniformly by the 
liquid, the initial levels of reflected and scattered signals are 
measured. As the cow’s vaginal fluid in functional state is 
semitransparent, we expect initially high reflection signal 
levels and low scatter signal levels. When the bubble 
appears, the reflected and scatter signal decrease.

When the reflected signal decreases rapidly it gives the 
impulse to switch off the microheater. Depending on the 
thermo-dynamical conditions, the gas phase is absorbed in 
the liquid or remains in the form of a series of small bubbles. 
Due to structural changes in vaginal fluid induced by 
heating, the scattered signal can increase. 
B. Sensor construction 
The capillaries used in our experiments were cut into 10 
cm long sections from Polymicro Inc. TSP 700 850 fiber. 
They had both ends closed. In the measuring head we also 
installed large core optical fibers BFH 37-600 from 
Thorlabs, the outer diameter of cladding of which is almost 
the same as the outer diameter of the capillary. In the 
previous sensor construction for fertility phase examination 
we used separate bases and replaceable capillary optrodes 
[30]. In the present work we implemented improvements of 
the fiber positioning method in the head base, which were 
key factors for improvement of the repeatability of signal 
measured from head to head. We also introduced the 
detection of the scattered signal, Fig 1. As the light source 
we used the fiber coupled laser source S1FC675 from 
Thorlabs at a level from 0.01 to 0.2mW. The light source 
was modulated with a function generator DG2021 from 
Rigol. The signal was transmitted to the BFH 37-600 fiber 
by graded-index multimode patch cables with a FC/SMA 
adapter. The optoelectronic detection unit of our own 
construction had an SMA fiber input and consisted of an 
integrated photo-amplifier and a band-pass filter with 
amplification and RMS detection. The optoelectronic unit 
was connected to a personal computer by analog input of 
IOtech personal Daq 3000 16bit/1MHz USB data acquisition 
system. We fed the heater from the laboratory power supply 
through an electric switch. The hybrid micro heater was 
powered with 5W in periods shorter than 30s during which 
time it showed resistance changes of 0.5% that can be 
considered as being stable. We also used two LM35DT [31] 
circuits connected, with the Daq 3000 system, by low pass 
filters to monitor the temperatures of the measuring head 
base and of the surrounding ambient. To operate the system 
we designed a script in DasyLab 10 with 0.1s sampling rate.  
The sensor was calibrated by filling the capillary with 
deionized water and performing a measurement procedure as 
on Fig. 2. The deionized water started boiling in a time range 
from 17.1 to 18.5 seconds of the measurement cycle for 
different disposable optrodes, but the characteristic shape of 
the signal was considered repeatable. The formation of the 
gas bubble caused a decrease of the reflected and the 
scattered signals. The scattered signal in this experiment 
came from two layers of capillary coating. However, when 
the bubble was present the scattered signal came mainly 
from one only layer of capillary coating and that was the 
reason of the decrease of the signal. After the heater was 
switched off, the bubble in the water changed from the gas to 
the liquid phase. There were no changes in the scattered 
signal after gas phase resorption. We performed experiments 
when the ambient temperature was in range from 22°C to 
24°C and when the head base temperature was not greater 
than 0.5°C over the surrounding ambient.

During the calibration cycle we also registered the 
temperature distribution in the capillary optrode with a R300

The map of temperature just before local boiling of water is 
presented in Fig. 3. The temperature map at the moment just 
after the start of boiling is presented in Fig. 4. The positions 
of the capillary on Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 are rotated by 90 degrees 
compared with Fig. 1. 
The points a, b, c in Figs. 3 and 4 are on the axis of the 
capillary. The temperature of the capillary was measured in 
points over the outer edges of the micro-heater. The 
temperature in point b was determined by the power 
dissipated in the micro-heater, and exceeded the boiling 
point of water, putting the steam in the bubble in a 
superheated condition. Due to good heat conductivity of 
water the temperature inside the capillary could be 
considered as almost uniform on the line a-c.

EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
Our experiments were divided in two parts. In the first 
part we analyzed the optical signals from different 
components of the vaginal fluids. In the second part we 
examined the vaginal fluid of cows in the most fertile phase 
for healthy cows and for cows suffering from vaginitis. 
A. Examination of components of vaginal fluid 
We used Permeabilization and Blocking Solutions (PBS) 
from Sigma Aldrich Inc to fabricate the mixture containing 
antibodies. The purified PBS measurement procedure gave 
signals very close to those for deionized water. The 
measurement procedure with PBS antibodies solution is 
presented in Fig. 6. The gas phase was created in 5.1 second 
of the measuring procedure, which was three times earlier 
than for case of deionized water. This phenomenon was 
repeatable but we found it not easy to interpret. The scattered 
signal increased significantly from 0.18 a.u. at the initial 
point of procedure to 0.3 a.u. just before turning the heating 
off and to average level 1.2 a.u. at the end of procedure. The 
liquid just above the heater after heating off resorbs the gas 
phase, the color of this liquid becomes foggy white. This can 
be explained as antibody protein denaturation. Glycerol is 
sometimes used as lubricant of cow’s vaginal duct. 
Therefore, we examined next the mixture of e-coli bacteria 
with glycerol (see Fig. 7). Glycerol and water showed 
different characteristics of signal reflection, but when the 
bubble was resorbed, a small increase of the scattered signal 
from initial 0.76 a.u. to 1.1 a.u. was observed. 
The mixtures of antibody and bacteria that we analyzed 
had similar concentrations of biological components, which 
combined with the similarity of the amount of energy 
transferred to the capillary, led us to the conclusion that the 
analyzed antibody was easier denaturated by temperature 
than e-coli, and that the scattered signal changes that could 
be connected with their presence may enable the detection of 
vaginitis.

B. Examination of cow’s vaginal fluid 
We analyzed vaginal fluids of Holstein-Friesian and 
Jersey cow breeds that are typical cattle in Poland. The cows 
were selected randomly from herds counting from 10 to 100 
animals. We examined samples of 15 cows classified as 
healthy. The vaginal fluid was collected in estrus and the 
post-estrus state. The vaginal fluid was also collected from 2 
cows which were in estrus and had vaginitis diagnosed by a 
veterinary doctor on the farm and confirmed by 
microbiological analysis, Fig. 8. The difference between 
healthy and ill state was not great by the count of the bacteria 
colony forming units. The vaginal fluid arborization test of 
cow in functional state of fertility is presented on Fig. 9. The 
observations of filling of the capillaries with various kinds of 
vaginal fluids are presented in Table 1. 
The vaginal fluid of not fertile phase did not enter the 
capillary without pumping. This was the simplest test for 
most fertile period of estrus. When the cow had serious 
problems of its vaginal duct, the vaginal fluid changes were 
visible and further diagnostic methods were not required, but 
there were no visual differences between vaginal fluids of 
cow with vaginitis or functional state, which called for 
additional diagnostic tests.

Measurements of healthy cow’s vaginal fluid using our 
method showed conformity with the results of examinations 
just discussed, Fig. 10. We observed that the vapor phase 
creation time was short and was about 5 seconds. The vapor 
phase existed for 2 seconds. The scatter signal did not exceed 
after heating the level of 1.5 a.u. but would increase 
correspondingly with the count of present bacteria. The 
limits of the increase of the signal are marked as red lines on 
the part B in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. The result of the 
examination of the vaginal fluid of cows with vaginitis is 
presented in Fig. 11.

We observed that the gas phase was either not present or 
was masked by the denaturation of proteins that would give a 
significant increase of the scattered signal from the stable 
level after turning the heating off. 
The cow in late estrus state approaches the limits of its 
readiness for insemination. In our observations on Fig. 12, 
the signals of vaginal fluid changed compared to Fig. 10. The 
time of gas phase creation increased significantly to over 10 
seconds of the measurement procedure. The generated gas 
phase accumulated the energy that did not allow the bubble 
to be resorbed.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR FUNCTIONAL 
STATE OF FERTILITY CLASSIFICATION 
The Qnet artificial neural network ANN used for 
classification of the vaginal fluid samples showed its 
advantages in sensor data processing. We examined the 
multilayer perceptron for classification of measured signals. 
We 
assumed 
two 
output 
information 
levels: 
a) 
healthy/unhealthy, b) ready for reproduction/ not ready for 
reproduction. While the cow is in the unhealthy state we 
assumed that it was not ready for reproduction, but is ready 
for veterinary treatment. The input information was the 
levels of signals and timing of the gas phase creation and the 
duration of the gas phase. The gas phase creation was 
evidenced by a rapid drop of the reflected signal. The gas 
phase duration was defined by the difference of time of the 
maximum level of the scatter signal and the mentioned drop 
of the reflected signal when the drop of the reflected signal 
undershot the level of 0.8 a.u. As the levels of the reflected 
signal we included into the ANN input: the initial level, the 
minimal level and the level at the measurement end. For the 
scattered signal we analyzed the: initial level, the maximum 
level and the last measured level. Therefore our ANN had 8 
inputs, 2 outputs and 4 hidden layers in which the perception 
used the sigmoid activation function and one hidden input 
with constant -1 value.  
Such ANN training gave a 0.986 correlation coefficient 
in the training set and a 5% RMS error of outputs when cases 
from monitored cows but not contained in the training set 
were analyzed. The output responsible for healthy state with 
a correlation coefficient of 0.999 was more precise than the 
estrus output where it was 0.987.  
We made test of network output for cow that is not 
included in training set and has first estrus after miscarry. 
The RMS error of most fertile state was 21%. It is a large 
figure, but the third estrus state after miscarry is standard 
consider as fertile and a question arise of mentioned cow 
healthy state. Therefore, the 5% of output tolerance of fertile 
state classification seems reasonable. 
The QNet software enabled us to analyze the input node 
contribution of output signals, Tab. 2. The data analysis 
showed that in our method the functional state of the cow

examined on base of vaginal fluid was directly and firmly 
connected with gas phase creation. Taking into account the 
time of gas phase creation and the time of its lasting, we 
have a level of 84% of contribution for cow functional state 
classification. We also could see that the gas creation was 
also the main information for cow readiness for reproduction 
at a level of 65% of contribution.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We have proved that the fiber optic capillary sensors with 
artificial network analysis can provide information on cow 
estrus state with a sensitivity superior to other existing 
methods and in addition provide information as to the 
presence of cow vaginitis. 
The results of the measured signals analysis of ANN 
training showed a correlation of 0.987 for estrus and 0.986 
for the classification of functional state of fertile phase. The 
proposed 
sensor 
introduced 
automatically 
precise 
information of possible vaginitis which can be of practical 
usefulness. We showed that the information on vaginitis was 
obtained mainly by establishing the presence of antibodies in 
the vaginal fluid. These antibodies are normally transparent 
in visible light in standard situations. Moreover, the capillary 
filling capability can act as an indicator of the most fertile 
state of cow estrus.  
Therefore, we conclude that the proposed construction 
may be in future the base of commercially marketable 
instruments. For this purpose the sensor construction has to 
be integrated into a complete instrument and therefore more 
resistant to use in harsh environment. The examination of 
greater number of cases could lead to artificial multilayer 
perceptron network optimization, mainly by precise the 
range of output tolerances for cows contained and not 
contained in training set.
