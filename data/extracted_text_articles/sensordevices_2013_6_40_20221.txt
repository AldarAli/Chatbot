Abstract— Last years have been characterized by an incredible 
growth in mobile computing capabilities and sensing 
technologies, which can leverage the deployment of many 
location-based applications, ranging from pedometers to 
navigation system. This work deals with an Inertial Navigation 
System (INS) able to support users in the navigation in an 
unknown indoor environment by continuously calculating 
their motions and their position. The proposed solution is 
based on integrated use of movement and position sensors. 
Unfortunately, applications that rely on the use of measures 
coming from orientation sensors, such accelerometers and 
digital 
compasses, 
are 
affected 
by 
external 
magnetic 
interferences 
thus 
resulting 
in 
inaccurate 
directional 
information. This paper focuses on this problem by 
investigating the use of the gyroscope as the primary 
determinant of orientation. Several tests have been carried out 
showing how the proposed method is able to correct the error 
introduced by the gyroscope both in static position and 
undergoing rotation, and thus, it is able to provide better 
orientation information than the compass.

 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, modern mobile devices, such as smartphones 
and PDAs in general, come to the market already equipped 
with sensors able to track them as they move, both in 
outdoor 
and 
in 
indoor 
environment. 
The 
sensing 
technologies embedded in such devices make it ideal for a 
wide range of location-based services, such as navigation 
applications.  
An Inertial Navigation System (INS) uses motion and 
rotation sensors in order to determine the position, 
orientation, and velocity of a moving object/user without the 
need of external infrastructures [1]. This is essential in an 
indoor environment where common localization systems, 
such as Global Positioning System (GPS), fail due to severe 
attenuation or obscuration of the satellite’s signal. In inertial 
navigation systems, localization/orientation estimation is 
source-independent. The user’s position is calculated in 
relation to a known starting position using a dead reckoning 
algorithm and the orientation is usually provided by a digital 
compass embedded in the smartphone. A digital compass 
sensor provides the orientation of the device relative to the 
magnetic north of the earth. However, when used in indoor 
environments, like any magnetic device, it is affected by 
significant error caused by nearby ferrous materials, as well 
as local electromagnetic fields. Such errors seriously affect 
the performance and the accuracy of the system, thus the 
need to investigate any alternative orientation technique. 
The present paper focuses on this problem by 
investigating the use of a gyroscope for navigation in indoor 
environment. A gyroscope is a device for measuring or 
maintaining orientation, based on the principles of angular 
momentum. The paper is organized as follows: in the next 
section, we describe the background and related works in the 
field of indoor navigation systems. Section III provides an 
overview of the developed application and presents the 
system architecture. Then, in Section IV, the gyroscope's 
functionalities are presented and in the next section the 
gyroscope calibration procedure is described. In Section VI, 
a comparison between gyroscope and compass behavior is 
analyzed, and finally, we draw the conclusion in the last 
section. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Most mobile navigation systems rely on the use of the 
digital compass embedded in the smartphone. It is proved 
that the measurements provided by this sensor are affected 
by large error, due to the existence of metallic objects and 
magnetic fields that often compromise the reliability and 
accuracy of the system. To compensate compass errors, 
many 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
exploiting 
different 
approaches. As experienced by King et al. [2], the 
measurement errors can vary a lot through the test 
environment, even if they calibrated the compass in the 
middle of the operation area. A variation of 1° is measured 
near the point of calibration, but variations up to 23° are 
detected a few times in certain points, always close to 
electromagnetic objects and electronic devices. 
 Sun et al. [3] proposed a novel approach to provide 
reliable orientation information for mobile devices in indoor 
environments that is not affected by magnetic interferences. 
Pictures of the ceiling of indoor environment are aggregated 
and computer vision based pattern matching techniques are 
applied in order to utilize them as orientation references for 
correcting digital compass readings. Ladetto et al. [4] 
develop a wearable dead reckoning unit consisting of 
gyroscope, compass and accelerometer, but they only use the 
gyroscope for correcting the compass heading errors due to 
magnetic interferences. In a later work, a pedestrian 
navigation system was proposed by Ladetto and Merminod 
[5]. They show that coupling a magnetic compass with a 
low-cost gyroscope in a decentralized Kalman filter [6]

configuration can limit the errors in the determination of the 
azimuth of walk. In non-magnetically disturbed areas, the 
results are close to each other and errors in position are 
limited. The addition of a gyroscope helps bridging the gap 
when the compass is strongly disturbed and improves the 
reliability of the system. Hoshino et al. proposed an extended 
Kalman filter to combine a magnetic compass and a rate 
gyroscope 
for 
sensor 
errors 
compensation 
[7]. 
A 
mathematical model for magnetic compass errors caused by 
body magnetization is proposed as well as an error model of 
the rate gyroscope. Barthold et al. [8], exploit the built-in 
gyroscope in the Nexus S smartphone to address the 
interference problems associated with the orientation sensor. 
Many tests were carried out and they proved that integrating 
the angular velocity output of the gyroscope allows 
predicting angular orientations to within 6% for test 
rotations, as well as detecting turns while the phone’s 
orientation was constantly changing. A study to investigate if 
and how magnetic sensors can be used to replace gyroscopes 
is conducted by Kunze et al. [9], showing a method to 
compute angular velocity from 3D magnetic sensor data and 
discussing its fundamental limitations. 
III. 
APPLICATION FOR INDOOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
In the context of Indoor Navigation System, we have 
developed an early prototype of a pedestrian navigation 
system for indoor environments based on dead reckoning, 
2D 
barcodes 
and 
data 
from 
accelerometers 
and 
magnetometers. All the sensing and computing technologies 
of our solution are available in common smartphones [10]. 
The prototype has been further improved by a new 
algorithm described afterwards (Section V) and now it is 
able to estimate the correct current position of the user, track 
him inside the building and provide the best path to achieve a 
specific destination [11].  
The application does not need to connect to any external 
or pre-installed positioning system such as GPS or Radio 
Frequency IDentification (RFID), or to use Wireless Fidelity 
(Wi-Fi) trilateration. The prototype of the proposed system 
uses just the data from the motion sensors embedded in the 
smartphone to compute the correct position of the user based 
on a known initial location, combined with a reference map 
of the building. 
A. Functionality 
The initial position of the user, the only certain 
information on which the system relies on for further 
calculation, is retrieved by scanning and decoding a geo-
referenced datamatrix (2D barcode), placed inside the 
building, using the built-in camera of the smartphone. Based 
on the URL encoded in the datamatrix, the application 
downloads from a dedicated server the indoor vector map for 
the specific floor, the initial position of the user on the map 
(corresponding to the point where the user stands when 
scanning the datamatrix) and a database that stores 
information about the setup of the building. When the user 
starts walking, the application draws step by step his position 
over the downloaded map of the building floor.  
The user’s position is calculated in relation to a known 
starting position using a dead reckoning algorithm. In the 
specific, the application tracks the number of steps taken by 
the user based on the linear numerical values returned by the 
smartphone’s accelerometers. The acceleration value is the 
modulus of the accelerations registered in the x, y and z-
axes. One step is detected when this module is above a high 
threshold (Th_high) and successively is below a Th_low 
value. To determinate the orientation, only the gyroscope is 
used thanks to an algorithm of calibration widely described 
next. 
IV. 
GYROSCOPE 
A gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining 
orientation, based on the principles of conservation of 
angular momentum. It’s used primarily for navigation and 
measurement of angular velocity up to 3 directions: 3-axis 
gyroscopes 
are 
often 
implemented 
with 
a 
3-axis 
accelerometer to provide a full 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) 
motion tracking system. There are three basic types of 
gyroscope: 
• 
Rotary gyroscopes are typically composed by a 
spinning disk or mass on an axle, which is mounted 
on a series of gimbals; the gyroscope follows the 
law of conservation of angular momentum, which 
says that the total angular momentum of a system is 
constant in both magnitude and direction if the 
resultant external torque acting upon the system is 
zero [12]; 
• 
Vibrating Structure Gyroscope or Micro Electro-
Mechanical System (MEMS) contains vibrating 
elements to measure the Coriolis effect, which 
states that an object with mass m moving with 
velocity v , in a frame of reference rotating at 
angular velocity ω , act a force Fc [13] in a 
direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to 
the velocity of the body in the rotating frame:  
 
Fc = −2m(ω *v)   
 (1)    
• 
Optical Gyroscopes: they operate on the principle 
of the Sagnac effect, but, due to the extensive 
amount of fibre-optic cable needed, optical 
gyroscopes are mainly used in naval and aviation 
applications. 
Some basic specifications of a gyroscope sensor are: 
• 
Measurement range: specifies the maximum 
angular speed that can be measured by the sensor, is 
typically 
expressed 
in 
degrees 
per 
second 
[deg/ sec] ; 
• 
Number of sensing axes: to measure angular 
rotation, the gyroscope can uses one, two, or three 
axes. The spatial orientation of a rigid body is thus 
based on three parameters: azimuth, rotation around 
the z axis; pitch, rotation around the x axis; roll, 
rotation around the y axis, as shown in Figure 1;

• 
Working temperature range: from -40˚C to between 
70 and 200˚C; 
• 
Shock survivability: specifies how much force the 
gyroscope can withstand before failing. Fortunately, 
gyroscopes are very robust, and can withstand a 
very large shock (over a very short duration) 
without breaking. Generally, this is measured in [g] 
(1g is the earth’s acceleration due to gravity), 
occasionally is also given the time with which the 
maximum g-force can be applied before the unit 
fails; 
 
Figure 1.  Axes and rotation angles of a smartphone: azimuth (z axis), 
pitch (x axis) and roll (y axis) parameter. 
• 
Bandwidth: the bandwidth of a gyroscope typically 
indicates how many measurements can be made per 
second, thus the gyroscope bandwidth is usually 
intended in 
]
[Hz ; 
• 
Angular Random Walk (ARW): this is a measure of 
gyroscope noise 
[deg/sec]
; 
• 
Bias: the Bias of a gyroscope sensor is the signal 
output when it is not experiencing any rotation. The 
Bias error can be expressed in [deg/sec]. A constant 
Bias error of ε , when integrated, causes an angular 
error which grows linearly with time: 
 
θ t( ) =ε *t  
(2)     
The aim of this project is to examine the level of 
accuracy that can be achieved in positioning by using built-in 
sensors in an Android smartphone. The focus has been put 
on estimating the position of the mobile phone inside a 
building only using the gyroscope sensor to determinate the 
orientation through a specific algorithm of calibration 
described in the following paragraph. 
V. 
GYROSCOPE CALIBRATION ALGHORITHM 
To improve the gyroscope's accuracy we created an 
algorithm for both still and rotating devices: 
• 
The first part is related to the Bias error when the 
device is not undergoing rotation. In this case, the 
constant Bias error of a gyroscope can be estimated 
by taking a long-term average of the gyroscope’s 
output, which it would be null. Once the Bias is 
known, it will be subtracted from each value of the 
gyroscope’s output. For this kind of test we have not 
used any particular equipment, but only the 
smartphone (Figure 2b) on the level. 
• 
The second part is related to the Bias error when the 
device is moving.  
The equipment used to calculate the real Bias error, when 
the device is undergoing rotation, is a Stepper Motor (Figure 
2a), which converts electrical pulses into discrete mechanical 
movements. The tests were carried out with a smartphone 
Samsung Nexus S (Figure 2b). Table I shows the embedded 
sensors in the smartphone and the angular velocity set in the 
Stepper Motor.

A. Drift Tests 
The goal is to find a calibration method for the 
gyroscope, when the device is not undergoing rotations. In 
this case, the angular velocity along the three axis should be 
zero. We calculate the average error of the gyroscope’s 
output along z axis. We have made 4 tests on 1,000, 5,000, 
10,000 and 100,000 readings, each composed by 5 sessions 
(S). This way, we can evaluate how the gyroscope’s output 
changes over time with a constant number of readings.  
Table II shows that the average error of the angular 
velocity is similar for each test and it is independent from the 
number of readings.

The gyroscope’s error is completely random and it does 
not follow a specific error model. For this reason we assume 
that the Bias is equal to the average error on 1,000 readings. 
Figure 3 and Figure 4 show how the calibration algorithm 
improves the accuracy of the output of the gyroscope by 
subtracting the Bias from each reading.

B. Rotation Tests 
To evaluate the error of the gyroscope when the device is 
undergoing a rotation, a stepper motor is used. It has a 
constant angular velocity of 0.307876080 [rad/s]. We fixed 
the device on the stepper motor thus the gyroscope starts 
reading the angular velocity when the stepper starts moving. 
We have made three tests with different number of readings 
(1,000, 10,000, and 20,000). Each test has been done for 10 
times as shown in the following Table III.

As shown in Figure 5, the trend of the blue line, which 
refers to the 1,000 readings, shows how the average angular 
velocity acquired by the sensor is significantly different from 
the trend representing the reference angular velocity. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Gyroscope's average angular velocity for 1,000, 10,000 and

Increasing the number of readings, the red and green line 
show a more regular trend compared to the blue line, even if 
they are more shifted upwards than the last one. 
The calibration is based on subtracting the Bias error 
from the average of the number of readings. The following 
Table IV shows how the averages have changed. Figure 6 
highlights how the lines are closer to the reference angular 
velocity, and this one illustrates and demonstrates the correct 
algorithm functioning.

The calibration algorithm has been applied for improving 
the prototype's functionality of a pedestrian navigation 
system described in Section III; in this case, is enough to 
activate the calibration just once at the application's start. 
VI. 
GYROSCOPE VS. COMPASS 
Some other tests have been carried out in order to 
understand if the compass and the gyroscope’s error are 
affected by larger errors in relation to longer paths and if it is 
possible to find a breakpoint, at which the two errors are 
comparable. Figure 7 shows the paths inside the building 
along six different blocks not subjected to electromagnetic 
pollution, otherwise the compass's output would be been 
negatively affected. 
 
 
 
Figure 7.   Paths inside a real indoor environment along six different 
blocks. Each yellow triangle represents a CheckPoint with a predefined 
orientation 
In each checkpoint (described by a numerated triangle), 
we read the angle rotation of the compass and the gyroscope. 
We made 5 paths of different length, starting with the 
shortest path made of 5 points, and finishing with the longest 
one made of 19 points, as shown in Table V. The objective is 
to analyze the absolute error of each sensor as subtracting 
between the acquired and attempted value. About the 
gyroscope, the attempted value is a rotation angle composed 
by a multiple of 90 degrees, while the angle provided by the 
compass is acquired compared to the real reference system 
(magnetic north).

The experimental results have shown how, compared to 
the gyroscope's absolute error, the compass's absolute error is 
random and independent from the length of the path, as 
shown in Figure 8, for a path of 19 checkpoints.  
 
Figure 8.  Comparison between the absolute error of Gyroscope and 
Compass for an indoor path made of 19 CheckPoints 
The gyroscope accumulates some errors for rotations in 
the same verse, while the error decreases for rotation in the 
opposite verse, resulting in a very small error lying between 
-4 and 10 degree. The compass’s absolute error instead lies 
between -58 and 132 degrees.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
The main objective of this paper was to examine the 
accuracy level that can be achieved in indoor navigation, 
specifically for the developed prototype [10][11], using 
exclusively the gyroscope sensor for the orientation. In order 
to reach the objective, the output from the gyroscope sensor 
has been analyzed with the device in static position and 
throughout a rotation. In both cases, the calibration algorithm 
satisfies the requirement and ensures a better orientation of 
the used device in indoor environment. Besides, we have

compared the behavior of compass and gyroscope over time 
and for different paths. 
In conclusion, we have established how the gyroscope 
sensor is better than the compass for indoor navigation, 
specifically for our mobile application, and how is possible 
to correct the error introduced from the gyroscope in static 
position and undergoing rotation.
