Abstract— Recently, Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) have 
become popular, making it easier to experience Mixed Reality 
(MR) environments that fuse real and virtual space. With the 
ability of MR to locate virtual Three-Dimensional (3D) objects 
in the real space, our 3D perception may also change as this type 
of 3D experience increases. While there have been studies that 
measure 3D gaze in either virtual or real space, no studies have 
discussed how the MR affects 3D gaze. In this study, we 
developed a See-Through Head-Mounted Display (ST-HMD) to 
analyze the effect of MR environment on 3D gaze measurement. 
We 
conducted 
experiments 
in 
two 
different 
physical 
environments: a room with and without depth cues. Our results 
showed that there was no significant difference in the measured 
3D gaze between rooms with and without depth cues. 
Experiments of tracking the gaze of a visual target moving from 
back to front showed that the scanpath of the 3D gaze followed 
the trajectory of the target's movement. 
Keywords-3D gaze estimation; See-Through Head-Mounted 
Display; depth perception. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The depth cue of binocular disparity was introduced by 
Wheatstone (1838) for the first time [1]. Since then, the first 
Three-Dimensional (3D) movie was released in 1922 where 
anaglyph glasses were used [2]. Later, 3D Televisions were 
introduced around 2010, but due to low demand, they were 
discontinued around 2016. 2016 is a symbolic year in which 
many Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays (VR-HMDs) 
were launched. The HoloLens, a See-Through Head-Mounted 
Display (ST-HMD), enables users to experience Mixed 
Reality (MR), new environment and visual representation 
generated by the fusion of real and virtual world. 
Depth perception is classified into binocular cues, which 
receive three-dimensional sensory information from both eyes, 
and monocular cues, which are represented in only two 
dimensions and observed with one eye. Binocular cues 
include retinal disparity, which exploits parallax and vergence.  
In contrast, monocular cues include relative size, texture 
gradient, occlusion, linear perspective, contrast differences, 
and motion parallax. Displays with head-tracking capability 
can generate motion parallax to improve the sense of depth.  
ST-HMDs are expected to be effectively used in the 
medical field to allow multiple observers to view 3D medical 
images in MR [3][4]. These devices are prone to discomfort 
and fatigue as the viewing time increases [5]. This is due to 
maintaining the focus of the eye while continuing to gaze at a 
moving object with vergence eye movements [6]. Analyzing 
the 3D gaze characteristics of viewers in MR is the key to 
solve these problems. 
3D gaze can be measured using a binocular eye tracker. 
The representation of 3D gaze can be roughly divided into two 
categories: the direction of gaze from the eye and the 3D 
position of the eye-gaze point [7][8]. Recent advances in deep 
learning technology have made it possible to estimate the gaze 
direction directly from face images [9], but to estimate the 3D 
position of the eye-gaze point, a binocular eye tracker with 3D 
gaze calibration is still needed [10]-[12].  
Analyzing 3D gaze in MR environments requires 
evaluating the relationship between the perceived position of 
a 3D object and the 3D eye-gaze point of that object. Using 
the Microsoft HoloLens with a binocular eye tracking, Öney 
et al. (2020) measured 3D gaze depth during a visual search 
task of 3D objects in MR environment placed within 1.25m to 
5m of the subject. However, their experiment suffered from a 
significantly large measurement error of more than a meter 
when the focused object was only 3.5m away from the viewer 
[13]. To achieve high accuracies in 3D gaze measurements, 
Kapp et al. (2021) filtered the resulting fixations manually, 
yielding an approximately 5cm of errors in average within 
4.0m measurement distance [14].  
In this study, we measure 3D gaze in MR and analyze the 
influence of the surrounding physical environment on 3D 
perception cues. Unlike previous studies, we will analyze the 
characteristics of 3D gaze scan paths of moving targets as well 
as stationary targets. In addition, we do not perform manual 
filtering of gaze data to reveal the 3D gaze characteristics in 
MR environment. The 3D eye tracker with ST-HMD for MR 
is developed in this study. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the 3D eye tracker based on ST-HMD developed for 
this study. Section III explains our experiments in 
environments with and without depth cues. Section IV 
describes the results. Finally, Section V presents our 
conclusion. 
II. 3D EYE TRACKER BASED ON ST-HMD 
We adopted Moverio (BT-30E, EPSON) as an ST-HMD 
and a three simultaneous USB camera module (KYT-U030-
3NF, KAYETON) to capture images of both eyes and the 
viewer’ scene at the same time. These cameras run at 60Hz. 
Figure 1 shows our 3D eye tracker. We used Pupil Capture 
(Pupil Labs), an open-source eye tracking platform, to 
localize the pupils of both eyes [15]. The software

automatically calculates 3D eye vector running from the 
estimated eyeball center.  
A. Virtual Environments 
The virtual targets used for measurement were created by 
generating binocular disparity to induce vergence. To 
determine the disparity, the angle between 3D eye vectors is 
calculated when gazing at a target placed at a certain distance. 
The ST-HMD used in this study was designed to allow the 
user to perceive a virtual screen equivalent to 40-Inch 
displayed at 250cm. The interpupillary distance was fixed at 
6.3cm, which is the average interpupillary distance for 
Japanese [16]. Figure 2 shows the relationship between both 
eyes and the virtual target placed 100cm in front of the viewer. 
We defined the radius of the adult eye to be 1.2cm, as there 
were no significant differences by gender, race, or age group 
[17]. 
B. 3D Gaze Estimation 
To calculate the 3D gaze, a polynomial equation is used 
to determine the relationship between the gaze direction of 
both eyes and the 3D position of the gazing target when 
gazing with vergence eye movement. Let (𝜃𝑙, 𝜃𝑟) represent 
pitch angles and (𝜑𝑙, 𝜑𝑟) represent yaw angles of eye-sight 
lines coming from the eye-ball center to the pupil center of 
the left and right eyes, respectively, the coordinate value of 
the 3D gaze (𝐺𝑥,𝐺𝑦,𝐺𝑧) is calculated by,  
𝐺𝑥 = 𝑎1𝜃𝑟

the gazing target obtained by 3D eye calibration.

III. EXPERIMENT 
In this study, we conducted gazing experiments using the 
following procedure in viewing environments with and 
without depth cues. 
Step 1. The subject is equipped with the ST-HMD and is 
seated at 250cm from the front wall. 
Step 2. 3D eye calibration is performed using 36 visual 
targets placed in the virtual space. Each target is 
displayed sequentially in 3s. 
Step 3. Another 12 visual targets are displayed to validate 
the accuracy of the 3D Gaze calibration. 
Step 4. The subject is asked to track a visual target that is 
approaching from 200cm to 50cm in the virtual space. 
It takes 5 seconds for the target to travel. This 
tracking is repeated 11 times with targets coming 
from different directions. 
The above procedure is conducted in two different 
physical environments: a room with and without depth cues. 
Figure 3 shows the physical environment for the experiments 
in this study. Here, to place visual targets for 3D gaze 
calibration, we set up four planes at 50cm intervals in the 
virtual space ranging from 50 to 200cm from the subject. In 
each plane, nine targets were placed. For the validation, three 
surfaces were set up at 50cm intervals at 75 to 175cm from the 
subject, and four targets were placed on each surface. The 
eleven back-to-front moving visual targets are used to 
examine the change in depth of the 3D gaze.  
IV. RESULTS 
Four subjects (male, mean age 23.3) participated in the 
experiment. They were tested for visual acuity using a Landolt 
ring to confirm that their vision achieved 1.0 or better. They 
were also asked to fill out a questionnaire to confirm that they 
had no health concerns.

Here, 𝑛 is the number of targets used for the measurement, 
𝑇𝑥𝑖, 𝑇𝑦𝑖, 𝑇𝑧𝑖  and 𝐺𝑥𝑖, 𝐺𝑦𝑖, 𝐺𝑧𝑖  are the coordinates of the 𝑖-th 
target and the associated eye-gaze points. 
Tables I and II show the 𝐴𝑐𝑐2𝐷 and 𝐴𝑐𝑐3𝐷 of the resulted 
calibrations and validations conducted in two physical 
environments. The accuracy of the 2D gaze calibration is less 
than 3 degrees, regardless of the experimental environment. 
This value corresponds to an error of less than 5cm at an area 
1m away from the eye. For validations, we observed that the 
accuracy decreased in the environment with depth cues. On 
the other hand, there was no significant difference in accuracy 
for both calibration and validation of the 3D gaze. These 
accuracies were analyzed with a 2 × 2, depth cues × visual 
targets, two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Effects 
were not found in either the depth cues (F (1, 12) = 0.192, p 
= .669) or the visual targets (F (1, 12) = 0.192, p = .669; F (1, 
12) = 3.497, p = .086). We conducted post-experimental

interviews to find out how the users perceived the 3D visual 
targets. The post-experimental interview revealed that the 
fourth subject was unable to converge on some of the 
validation targets. However, since the accuracy of the 
calibration was sufficiently high that the data from the 
subsequent experiments could be used for analysis. 
B. Difference between perceived distance and measured 
distance 
After the gaze calibration and validation completed, we 
performed experiments to track the back-to-front moving 
visual targets with the gaze. Figure 5 shows a typical of 
subject's scanpath of 3D gaze while tracking the back-to-front 
targets. The black line indicates the line connecting the initial 
position of the target in the front-back direction and the 
position of the subject's eyes. As can be seen, the scan path 
of the 3D gaze follows the trajectory of the target motion. 
Figure 6 shows the profile of typical 3D scanpaths of #7  
back-to-front moving visual target. The orange line shows a 
downward trend, indicating that the distance measured by the 
3D gaze gets shorter as the back-to-front visual target gets 
closer. This is an ideal result, but not all subjects were able to 
produce these characteristics of eye movements. Subjects 
observed that their 3D gaze became unstable when the targets 
started to move, as shown by the blue and green lines. In the 
post-experimental interviews, we found that this was due to 
difficulties in tracking the visual target with proper vergence 
when it started moving. 
V. 
CONCLUSSION 
In this study, we measured and analyzed 3D gaze in MR 
environments. Our experiments showed that there was no 
significant difference in the measured 3D gaze between rooms 
with and without depth cues. This result is consistent with that 
indicated by Öney et al. (2020), but our setup achieves an 
average accuracy of less than 25cm, which is about four times 
better than their measurements [13].  
Experiments with tracking the gaze of a visual target 
moving from back to front showed that the 3D gaze scanpath 
followed the trajectory of the target's movement. However, in 
some situations, some users found it difficult to track the 
visual target with proper vergence when it started moving. In 
MR environments, it is common for viewers to view 3D 
contents in motion, thus further analysis of the relationship 
among viewer movements and 3D gaze characteristics is 
important. 
With the increasing use of VR devices, MR will become 
more accessible, and there will be more research on the 
characteristics of vergence eye movements in 3D experiences. 
In our next experiments, we plan to measure 3D gaze while
