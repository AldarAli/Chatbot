Abstract—We present an analysis of how the spreading phe-
nomena, which includes the spread of information, innovations,
ideas, trends, etc. is inﬂuenced by the structure of the underlying
(social) network. We conducted spreading simulations using the
SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model on a large number
of real-world and artiﬁcially generated network datasets. The
results show that the network characteristics have a signiﬁcant
effect on the SIR diffusion. The results reveal that the network
structure affects the diffusion in terms of the achieved diffusion,
the course of the diffusion and the predictability of the diffusion.
We could also show that the effect of other parameters, such
as the impact of seeding (network targeting), signiﬁcantly differs
in relationship to the underlying network structure. With these
ﬁndings, we are able to provide a more differentiated picture on
previous contradictory ﬁndings, especially in the ﬁeld of seeding
strategies. We further provide useful recommendations for future
research to make results more generalizable and comparable.

INTRODUCTION
The diffusion phenomena in social networks, such as the
Internet or the World Wide Web, has attracted much attention
in recent years, both in the research and the industrial sector.
Developments like the Web 2.0 and subsequent technologies
facilitated a peer-to-peer spread of information besides the
traditional one-to-many broadcasters like TV or radio stations.
The emergence of virtual social networks on the Internet offers
new data and insights into this phenomenon, since it has
been challenging to access detailed and large-scale data in
the past. New forms of marketing emerged, such as ”viral
marketing” as ﬁrst coined by Steve Jurvetson in 1996 [1].
The metaphorical term viral directly leads the origin of the
phenomenon in the research on the spread of epidemic diseases
[2]. Although research helped to understand the spreading
behavior of diseases like H1N1 [3], Severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) [4] and inﬂuenza A [5], the diffusion of
violent topics in social media [6], or the success of product
innovations [7], there are still unresolved issues regarding the
inﬂuencing factors of a diffusion.
In an information diffusion or viral marketing scenario,
three main components determine the (viral) process: (1) the
behavioral characteristics of the members of the network, (2)
the seeding strategy, and (3) the structure of the social network
[8]. Since the seeding strategy, in other words the selection of
the ﬁrst network nodes, is largely under the control of the
marketer, this issue received a lot of attention. In particular,
the computer science and marketing community addressed this
issue [9][10][11][12][13]. Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos, for
instance, formulated the theoretical approach of the diffusion
maximization problem [9]. Still, questions about the impact of
seeding and the best seeding strategy exist [10][14]. Due to the
previous focus on this issue the third aspect, the structure of the
underlying network, only recently received consideration. One
reason could be the progress made in social network analysis in
the last years. Nevertheless, although efforts have been made,
many questions remain open.
The majority of the research is based on investigations on
only very few network datasets [9][12][15] and it is unclear
if the ﬁndings are applicable to any other network. Watts and
Strogatz further showed that some types of networks facilitate
an epidemic spread [16]. Hence, a deeper understanding is
needed, what characteristics of a network inﬂuence a diffusion.
In this paper, we examine an information diffusion process
based on diffusion simulations using the SIR diffusion model
on a large number of both real-world and artiﬁcially gener-
ated networks. We will introduce several metrics to describe
network characteristics and evaluate the relation between the
metrics and the diffusion results. This also includes the relation
between several possible seeding methods to answer the ques-
tion whether and how seeding methods interact with different
types of networks. The paper is organized as follows. The next
sections describes the latest state of research and highlights
important research gaps. Section III explains the simulation
analysis including the datasets and network characteristics used
in this paper. Section IV presents the analysis and the results.
Finally, the paper is closed with our conclusion in Section V.

DIFFUSION IN ONLINE NETWORKS
The research on the diffusion of information in online
networks has mainly derived from the studies of infectious dis-
eases and epidemics [2][17]. Although there has been research
on product growth models prior to the groundbreaking work
made in the ﬁeld of epidemics [18], the knowledge gained in
the ﬁeld of information diffusion has enriched research in other
contexts, such as the diffusion of (product) innovations [19][7].
Especially the boost of computer networks, the progress made

in social network analysis and the success of the Internet have
caused a large spread of research on diffusion in networks in
various contexts. Of particular interest is the research on elec-
tronic word-of-mouth marketing or viral marketing [20][21]
and the the research on the effect and the optimization of
seeding strategies [22][9][10][23]. The seeding strategy deter-
mines an initial set of (network) nodes, usually to maximize the
spread of information or to boost the effect of word-of-mouth.
However, in the past, contradictory ﬁndings have been made in
terms of the effectiveness of seeding [10][9][12][14][24]. Aral,
Muchnik, and Sundararajan recently argued that conventional
wisdom about seeding strategies should be questioned as the
effectiveness of seeding might be overestimated if other factors
like network characteristics or node similarities (homophily)
are not taken into account [24].
In the past, different models have been introduced to
theoretically describe the spreading of diseases or information.
Beside approaches like threshold models [25] based on the
idea of adoption or cascade models [21], the SIR model, and
in particular, the network SIR model can be considered as a
reference model in terms of information diffusion due to its
numerous successful applications [26][27]. The SIR acronym
is derived from the three states or conditions a network node
can occupy: susceptible, infected or recovered. In the context
of information diffusion the susceptible state would reﬂect
nodes that have not received a circulating information artifact.
The infected nodes are nodes which have already received the
artifact and are able to spread it further to neighbor nodes, and
recovered nodes (sometimes also referred to as removed or
inactive) may unsuccessfully receive the circulating informa-
tion without any consequences. Due to the dichotomous nature
of the possession of an information artifact, the peer-to-peer
transmission, in other words an infection, can be modeled as
a Bernoulli game. The outcome is 1 if the transmission was
successful an 0 if not. Hence, there is an expected infection
probability p of a single node reﬂecting the likelihood to infect
other nodes.
Past research showed that the characteristics of many
(social) networks facilitate an epidemic spread, which also
accounts for information diffusion and viral marketing [16].
Bampo, Ewing, Mather, Stewart, and Wallace compared a
real-world spreading in a large peer-to-peer network with
a simulated SIR modeled spreading on generated random
networks [8]. They created random graphs comprising the
same topological properties like density and degree distribution
as the real observed network. Their ﬁndings showed that the
social network had a signiﬁcant impact on the performance of
a viral marketing campaign. They further stated that clustered
networks are not very efﬁcient and that small-world networks
generally temper the spread of messages. Shakarian and Paulo
investigated on viral marketing diffusion simulations in numer-
ous networks and observed three different types of networks,
each type showing a very distinct diffusion pattern [13]. They
grouped the networks based on the diffusion results into the
groups highly susceptible, susceptible, and diffusion hamper.
The results did, however, not provide an explanation what
characteristics relate to a higher diffusion susceptibility. A
more detailed examination was conducted by Opuszko and
Ruhland [28], who investigated independent cascade and linear
threshold diffusion simulation and showed that the diffusion
strongly depends on the underlying network. They found that
the seeding impact is not present in every network, especially
not for cascade-like diffusions.

METHOD
To address the questions mentioned in the introduction, a
simulation analysis was conducted using a set of 35 different
network datasets (see next subsection for details). For every
network dataset 200 runs of simulations with randomly chosen
start parameters were conducted. For every run the following
parameters were set randomly: the number of start nodes was
set at random in the interval [1,50], the seeding criterion for
choosing the start nodes (based on several network centralities,
see below) was selected randomly and the nodes have been
selected accordingly by calculating the metrics for all network
nodes, the infection probability for all nodes was set randomly
in the interval [0,1]. Every simulation run comprised 50 single
simulations with the prior set parameters. This was done in
order to assess the variation of a spreading under identical
preconditions. We measured three simulation outcomes, the
average number of infected nodes, in other words the achieved
network diffusion, the average number of circulations and the
standard deviation of the diffusion of one simulation run. The
number of circulations reﬂects the discrete time steps a virus or
a diffusion was present and circulating before it died out. The
results of one simulation run were stored including all used
parameters and the network metrics as one single case. All in
all, 350,000 simulations were conducted. The resulting dataset
comprised 7,000 cases for each simulation run including the
network characteristics (see next subsections), the simulation
parameters and the results.

Both real-world and artiﬁcially generated networks have
been used as a source for the simulations. Table I shows the
network datasets used for the SIR simulations. The real-world
networks include some of the most common datasets used in
social network analysis. One exception is the dataset Student
Network. This network has been extracted in a former analysis.
It comprises a Facebook friendship network of university
freshmen after their ﬁrst semester of study. It should be noted
that prior to the analysis, all isolated nodes have been deleted
from the graphs.
Three state-of-the-art algorithms have been used to gen-
erate the artiﬁcial networks: Erd¨os-Renyi game [41], Watts-
Strogatz game [16] and Barab´asi-Albert game [40]. The arti-
ﬁcial networks have been generated in order to represent the
characteristics of the real-world datasets in terms of node and
edge count. All calculations have been done using the igraph
[42] package in the R software [43].
B. Network Characteristics
To describe a network’s structure and characteristics and
to later evaluate diffusion predictors, we calculated several
metrics to describe a network.
•
Number of network nodes, usually the number of
users.
•
Number of network edges, the number of connections
between the nodes.
•
Network density, the relation between existing and
possible edges.
•
Connected graph (yes, no), a graph is connected if
all nodes belong to one (giant) component and no
individual clusters exist.
•
Average path length, the average of all shortest paths
between any two nodes of the network.
•
Number of components/clusters, number of isolated
components comprising at least two nodes.
•
Network/Graph diameter, the diameter of a network
is the length of the longest shortest path between two
arbitrary nodes in the network.
•
Average node degree, a normalized ([0,1]) metric of
the degree centrality of all nodes.
•
Average node betweenness, a normalized ([0,1]) metric
of the betweenness centrality of all nodes.
•
Average node closeness, a normalized ([0,1]) metric
of the closeness centrality of all nodes.
•
Average node eigenvector, a normalized ([0,1]) metric
of the eigenvector centrality of all nodes.
•
Average clustering coefﬁcient, a normalized ([0,1])
coefﬁcient of the clustering coefﬁcient of all nodes.
•
Number of network communities, communities are sub
graphs or dense groups of nodes within a network that
are sparsely connected to other groups. In contrast to
components, these groups are not isolated from each
other. We used the leading eigenvector community
detection algorithm according to Newman [36].
•
Degree distribution power law ﬁt, since the degree
distributions of network nodes often show a power
law distribution, we ﬁtted a power-law distribution
with maximum likelihood methods as recommended
by Newman [44] against the degree distribution of
each network.
C. Seeding Criteria for the Selection the Seeding Nodes
There are several criteria for selecting the initial infected
nodes. The most simple is by randomly activating a set of
nodes. A common method is to evaluate the centrality of every
node in the network based on different centrality measures
and to choose the most central nodes as those are supposed
to be most inﬂuential [45]. Kempe et al. initially formalized
this problem as the inﬂuence maximization problem [9]. We
will evaluate the following centrality measures as a criterion
for the selection of the seeding nodes. All centrality metrics
have been calculated according to Wasserman and Faust [46]
as well as Newman [47]. We refer to those publications for
further details on the calculations. It should be mentioned that
the presented list of seeding criteria is far from complete. The
methods used are based on network centralities and cannot
reﬂect node behavioral aspects like adoption propensities or
node homophily.
•
Degree Centrality, one of the most common centrality
measures. Degree centrality reﬂects the number of ties
(also known as neighbors or friends in the context of
online social networks) of a node.
•
Betweenness Centrality, this centrality reﬂects the
probability of a node to lie on a shortest path between
two randomly chosen nodes.
•
Closeness Centrality, this reﬂects the inverse farness
of a node to any other node in the network.
•
Eigenvector Centrality, a natural extension of the de-
gree centrality. The difference is that nodes also award
”points” for the degree centrality of their neighbors.
A node is central if it is connected to other important
nodes.
•
Node Clustering Coefﬁcient, sometimes also referred
to as transitivity. The clustering coefﬁcient of a node
is the relation of the number of pairs of neighbors that
are connected to the number of pairs of neighbors. In
online social networks this reﬂects to the connection
among a users’ friends.
•
PageRank Coefﬁcient, extension of the eigenvector
centrality used by Google to rank the centrality of
web pages [40]. The difference is that the centrality
of a node is further divided by the out-degree of a
node.
•
Random, the initial start nodes are chosen randomly.

a high variance in the diffusion depending on the underlying
network. Interestingly, the standard deviation of the network
diffusion for all simulation runs (comprising 50 individual
simulations using a ﬁxed parameter setting) is only 0.022,
showing that within a similar parameter setting, the diffusion
is quite foreseeable.
Aside from very high values of the infection probability,
we can observe that the diffusion percentage spreads over
the whole range from almost no diffusion to nearly total
diffusion, especially in the middle and lower area of the
infection probability. The boxplots in Fig. 1 depict the high
variation and uncertainty in the diffusion. In the node infection
probability interval of [0.2, 0.4) the standard deviation is 0.306
having a mean of 0.543. When the networks are examined
separately, the picture becomes more clear as seen in Fig.
2. Here we plotted the diffusion results and the number
of circulations versus the node infection probability of four
exemplary networks. As we can see, the curves signiﬁcantly
differ. As some diffusion curves seem to follow the typical S-
shape (power network), some networks show an almost linear
relation to the node infection probability (Erd¨os Coauthorship
Network). We can further state a dramatic difference between
some networks, especially in the node infection probability
interval from 0.4 to 0.5. Comparing the power and the jazz
network at a node infection probability of 0.4, we can observe
a difference in the diffusion of almost 80%, having network
diffusions around the mean of 0.08 for the power network and
diffusions around the mean of 0.95 for the jazz network. This
means that for identical SIR model settings, one network will
usually reach diffusions of not even 10% of its network nodes,
having other networks where almost the whole population
(95%) is reached.
Similar results are highlighted by the graph showing the
distribution of the number of circulations taken by a simula-
tion. We can see characteristic differences for different net-
works, showing that some networks never reach the maximum
number of circulations of 14 (Erd¨os Coauthorship Network),
whereas other networks show a more than nine times higher
maximum diffusion circulations of 127 (Watt-Strogatz Network
7). Moreover the plot shows that the maximum number of
circulations is reached for totally different values of the node
infection probability. The Watt-Strogatz Network 7 reaches the
maximum at avlues around 0.2 and the power network reaches
the highest values at a node infection probability at around

A ﬁrst conclusion to draw from the ﬁgures is that the
networks show tremendous variation in their diffusion behav-
ior, both in terms of achieved diffusion (infected nodes) and
the circulation time. To evaluate the inﬂuence of the network
parameters on the diffusions we calculated the correlation
between those parameters and the mean diffusion. The results
revealed several signiﬁcant correlations. It should be noted
that all correlations reported hereinafter showed a p-Value of
< 0.001, if not stated otherwise. Obviously, the infection prob-
ability plays an important role (r = 0.644). Furthermore, the
average closeness (r = 0.323) had a moderate signiﬁcant ef-
fect. The network density (r = 0.264), the average eigenvector
(r = 0.263) and the average degree (r = 0.230) of a network
correlated signiﬁcantly with the network diffusion showing
weak relationships. On the other hand, the network diameter
(r = −0.342) and the average path length (r = −0.302) of
the network showed moderate negative relationships.
The picture is similar regarding the number of circula-
tions of a diffusion. We can identify various strong positive
relationships. The average path length (r = 0.588) and the
diameter (r = 0.561) of a network correlated with the number
of circulations. The average closeness (r = −0.421) showed
a strong, the density (r = −0.317) a moderate, the average
eigenvector (r
=
−0.260) and the average betweenness
(r = −0.226) showed weak negative relationships with the
number of circulations.
When evaluating how strong the diffusion varies within
one simulation run, represented by a diffusion run’s standard
deviation, we can observe moderate relationships with the
average betweenness (r = 0.343) and the density (r = 0.315)
of a network. This indicates that networks with high values
for these metrics are usually less predictable in terms of the
network diffusion for a given ﬁxed parameter setting.
Interestingly, the network size and the number of edges
did not have a great effect on the diffusion. Highly connected
and dense networks seem to lead to higher diffusion rates
at comparable diffusion parameters. Another important factor
appears to be the spatial dimension, represented by the average
path length between two arbitrary nodes of the network and the
network diameter. This directly relates to the small world prop-
erty of networks, ﬁrst discovered by Watts and Strogatz [16].
Small world networks are characterized by highly clustered
nodes having small average path lengths. Many contemporary

online social networks like Facebook show very small average
path lengths and a small diameter. This is interesting as
these networks may contain hundreds of millions of nodes.
Since Milgram’s ﬁrst estimate of 6 degrees (edges) between
any two people in the world [48], this number is estimated
to be 3.74 in the Facebook online social network in 2011,
comprising, at that time, over 721 million users [49]. We can
expect shorter path lengths and shorter spatial dimensions of
networks in the future. According to the results presented, we
can expect higher diffusions under the same preconditions for
future networks.
B. Effect of generated random networks
When conducting experiments, researchers or marketing
campaigners sometimes make use of generated random net-
works to examine different spreading scenarios. We were
interested whether these networks might show a signiﬁcant
difference in the diffusion compared to real-world networks.
An ANOVA on the effect of the mean diffusion regarding
an underlying real-world or generated network was con-
ducted. The ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant mean difference:
F(1, 6998) = 28.28, p < .001, ω2 = .003, d = 0.12) for
the groups real-world (µ = 0.62, σ = 0.32) and random
generated (µ = 0.67, sd = 0.35) networks. Another ANOVA
of the effect on the circulation length in real-world and gener-
ated networks showed a signiﬁcant difference: F(1, 6998) =
10.712, p < .001, ω2 = .001, d = 0.07) for the groups
real-world (µ = 9.28, σ = 6.38) and random generated
(µ = 10.19, sd = 14.14) networks. Although the difference
is signiﬁcant, the effect according to ω2 [50] or Cohen’s d
[51] effect size is rather minor. We can conclude that random
networks tend to a slight overestimation in the diffusion and
a small overestimation in the circulation length.
C. Inﬂuence of the Number of Seeding Nodes
To show whether the number of seeding nodes has a sig-
niﬁcant inﬂuence on the resulting diffusion we calculated the
overall correlation between the mean diffusion of a simulation
run and the number of seeding nodes used. We can state that,
although signiﬁcant (p < .001), there is no overall effect
(r = 0.07) of the number of seeding nodes on the diffusion.
When calculating the correlation for every network sep-
arately, the picture changes dramatically. We can observe
networks that show a strong effect regarding the number of
start nodes: dolphins network (r = 0.45, p < .001), Watts-
Strogatz network 1 (r = 0.34, p < .001). A ﬁrst interpretation
would be that small networks, in terms of the number of nodes,
show a high correlation, as would be expected. Interestingly,
there are other networks with only a few number of nodes that
do not show this effect, e.g. the jazz network (r = −0.03). On
the other hand, there are also quite big networks that show an
effect like the netscience network (r = 0.29, p < .001).
Since the effect differs so strongly from network to net-
work, we were interested if there might be a metric that
could explain this behavior. Therefore we calculated several
regressions of the effect with the network metrics. We could
identify two signiﬁcant relationships. The average betweenness
(p < 0.001, β = 0.78, R2 = 0.59) and the network density
(p < 0.01, β = 0.52, R2 = 0.25) of a network showed a strong

Estimated densities of the mean diffusion and the number of
circulations grouped by the seeding criterion
relationship with the effect of the number of seeding nodes.
Hence, if the network is characterized by bridging nodes with
a high betweenness and a high density, this parameter is of
higher importance.
D. Inﬂuence of Seeding Criterion
Fig. 3 shows the estimated density from a kernel density
estimator for the achieved diffusion and the number of cir-
culations grouped by the seeding criterion. Interestingly, the
ﬁgure highlights a rather minor effect of this parameter on
the diffusion and the number of circulations. Surprisingly, an
ANOVA showed that there was no signiﬁcant overall effect
of the seeding criterion. We should recall at this point that
the seeding methods used in this paper are not a complete
list of possible metrics. The results, however, conﬁrm some
previous ﬁndings, for instance Opuszko and Ruhland [28]
who found that diffusions based on cascades show a rather
minor sensitivity to the seeding method. Nevertheless, we were
interested if the effect is network speciﬁc so we conducted an
ANOVA for each network separately. The results showed that
there are in fact some differences among the networks. The
netscience network (p < 0.001, ω2 = 0.103), the Barabasi-
Albert network 3 (p < 0.01, ω2 = 0.066), the hep-th network
(p < 0.01, ω2 = 0.062) showed a medium effect. Six other
networks showed a weak effect. Still the number is quite low.
We further conducted regressions to investigate if the effect is
related to a network metric. Only the number of components
showed a weak signiﬁcant relationship (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.107)
with the effect.
When evaluating the effect of seeding on the number of
circulations the overall results are similar as there was no
signiﬁcant relationship. The picture changes, however, if the
relationship is calculated for each network separately. ANOVA
calculations for every network showed a diverse picture. 19
networks showed at least a weak relationship. Some networks
showed a very strong relationship with the effect: Barab´asi-
Albert 2 network (p
<
0.001, ω2
=
0.303), Barab´asi-
Albert 1 network (p < 0.001, ω2 = 0.201), jazz network
(p < 0.001, ω2 = 0.184). We can state that seeding has a
much higher effect on the number of circulations than it had
on the diffusion. Again we conducted several regressions to
evaluate possible relationships of the effect to network metrics.
The results reveal positive signiﬁcant weak relationships with
the network density (p < 0.01, R2 = 0.206), the average
clustering coefﬁcient (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.152) and the average
closeness (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.106). We can conclude that dense

clustered and fragmented networks show a higher sensitivity
to seeding in terms of the circulation time.
V.
CONCLUSION
The results presented in this paper lead to two main
outcomes: First, we have shown that the underlying network
has a tremendous effect on the simulated SIR spreading. We
have seen that networks show signiﬁcantly different behavior
under comparable parameters. This also includes the variation
of the diffusion. Some networks show signiﬁcantly more
variation and uncertainty in the diffusion than others. As a
consequence, we question if results based on one speciﬁc
network are transferable to any other network. Therefore
we recommend for future investigations that authors either
present further network characteristics other than the network
size, since we have seen that the size is not a profound
network metric, or they make the dataset publicly available.
In this way other researchers are able to assess the network
characteristics. If that is not possible, perhaps due to copyright
or secrecy issues, the researchers might present parameters
to generate a random network reﬂecting the examined real-
world network’s characteristics. As we have shown, the use of
random generated networks is suitable for analyses.
The second main insight is that seeding must be seen on a
differentiated basis. Besides the fact that the overall effect in
the SIR diffusion was rather minor, we could identify signiﬁ-
cant differences among the networks. This could possibly ex-
plain some of the previous contradictory ﬁndings [24][10][20].
We can further state that seeding might not affect cascade-
like diffusions as much as it effects adoption-like diffusions.
Opuszko and Ruhland [28] found in their experiments with
linear-threshold models that the effect of seeding is higher in
adoption models. However, we have to emphasize the fact that
the seeding methods used in this paper are based on network
centralities and might omit other node speciﬁc factors not
related to a centrality metric. Aral and colleagues [24] argued
that the omission of these characteristics is a factor in the on-
going disagreement about the effect of seeding. Based on our
results we can state that even with a state-of-the-art simulation
analysis, the picture is diverse and the results are related to the
underlying network characteristics.
The results presented are not tied to the research in
information diffusion. They relate to numerous research ﬁelds
like viral marketing, the research on epidemics, the ﬂow of
innovations and ideas in collaboration networks etc.
