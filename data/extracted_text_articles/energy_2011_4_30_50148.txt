Abstract—Microgrid is taken as the future Smart Grid, and 
can work as a local energy provider to domestic buildings and 
reduce energy expenses. To further lower the cost, a Smart 
Homes idea is suggested. Smart Homes of the future will 
include automation systems and could provide lower energy 
consumption costs and comfortable and secure living 
environment to end users. If the energy consumption tasks 
across multiple homes can be scheduled based on the users’ 
requirement, the energy cost and peak demand could be 
reduced. In this paper the optimal scheduling of smart homes’ 
energy consumption is presented using mixed-integer linear 
programming. In order to minimize a one-day forecasted 
energy 
consumption 
cost, 
operation 
and 
electricity 
consumption tasks are scheduled based on different electricity 
tariffs, electricity task time window and forecasted renewable 
energy output. A case study of thirty homes with their own 
microgrid indicates the possibility of cost saving and asset 
utilization increase.  
Keywords: planning/scheduling; smart homes; microgrid;

INTRODUCTION 
The future electricity distribution system will be meshed 
and intelligent and better known as Smart Grid, which 
includes advanced digital meters, distribution automation, 
communication systems and distributed energy resources. 
The desired Smart Grid functionalities include self-healing, 
optimizing asset utilization and minimizing operations and 
maintenance expenses [1]. As Smart Grid of the future, 
microgrid is considered to enable widespread inclusion of 
renewable resources, distributed storage and demand 
response programs in distribution [2].  
Several studies have considered how to design the 
capacity of a microgrid system to minimize the annual cost 
[3]–[5]. A computer program that optimizes the equipment 
arrangement of each building linked to a fuel cell network 
and the path of the hot-water piping network under the cost 
minimization objective has also been developed [6]. Energy 
management systems and optimal scheduling of microgrid 
have been produced to generate an optimum operation plan 
for a microgrid [7]–[9]. Hawkes and Leach [10] presented a 
linear programming cost minimization model for the high 
level system design and corresponding unit commitment of 
generators and storages within a microgrid. Compared with 
centralized generation, the sensitivity analysis of results to 
variations in energy prices indicates a microgrid can offer an 
economic proposition. This model can provide both the 
optimized capacities of candidate technologies as well as the 
operating schedule.  
This paper considers a residential building with its own 
microgrid, distributed energy resources and automation 
system. The idea of the smart home originated from the 
concept of home automation, which provides some common 
benefits to the end users, which include lower energy costs, 
provision of comfort and security and provision of home-
based health care and assistance to elderly or disabled users 
[11]. Several works have been proposed to achieve the 
energy conservation and management perspectives [12]–[16] 
but these scheduling optimization models only consider 
operation scheduling based on the given energy profile. 
Derin and Ferrante [17] described a model that concerns both 
operation scheduling and electricity consumption tasks order 
scheduling.  However, their results indicate relatively a high 
computation time to schedule only three electricity 
consumption tasks.  
Scheduling tasks subject to limited resources is a well 
known problem in many areas of the process industry and of 
other fields [18]–[22] but there are differences for the 
scheduling of electrical appliances. In this work, the 
objective is to minimize the total one-day-ahead expense of 
the Smart Homes’ energy consumption, including the 
operation and energy cost. Both operation of the distributed 
energy generation technologies and domestic electrical 
appliances are scheduled based on the electricity price at 
each time interval, the renewable energy output forecast, 
subject to constraints on the starting and ending time for each 
appliance. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the 
mathematical model is shown in Section II, the case study is 
presented in Section III, the optimal results are given in 
Section IV, and the discussion and conclusions are given in 
Section V. 
II. 
MATHEMATICAL MODEL 
The smart homes power consumption scheduling 
problem is formed as a mixed integer linear programming 
model. The daily power consumption tasks are scheduled 
based on their given operation time window (earliest starting 
time and latest ending time), and the objective is to minimize 
the daily power cost and shave the power consumption peak. 
It assumes the smart building system has its own microgrid 
and some decentralized resources (such as wind generator,

CHP generator, boiler, thermal storage and electrical storage) 
to provide the basic electricity and also it has a grid 
connection to obtain electricity during peak hours or sell 
electricity to the grid when there is surplus electricity 
generation. Since this model only provides the optimal 
scheduling for one day, equipment capacity selection is not 
considered and all the equipment capacities are given. The 
electricity price profile from the grid is given and may vary 
according to time of day. The model also assumes the 
weather forecast can provide 24 hour wind speed data.

F. Objective function 
The objective function is to minimize the total daily 
electricity cost, which includes: the operation and 
maintenance cost of the CHP generator, wind generator, 
electrical storage and thermal storage; the cost of electricity 
purchased from the grid; the revenue from electricity sold to 
the grid. Since the equipment capacities are fixed, their 
capital costs are independent of the schedule and are 
therefore not considered.

CASE STUDY  
The case study building system has 30 homes with the 
following energy suppliers: 
• 
one CHP generator with a capacity of 40kWe its 
electrical efficiency is 35%, heat to power ratio is 
1.3, and natural gas cost is 2.7p/kWh; 
• 
one wind farm with a capacity of 10kWe and a 
maintenance cost of 0.5p/kWhe;  
• 
one boiler with capacity of 85kWth and natural gas 
cost is 2.7p/kWh; 
• 
one electrical storage unit with a capacity of 
10kWeh; the charge/discharge efficiency is 95%, 
discharge limit and charge limit are both 10kWe, 
and the maintenance cost is 0.5p/kWhe; 
• 
one thermal storage unit with a capacity of 
20kWthh; the charge/discharge efficiency is 98%, 
discharge limit and charge limit are both 20kWth, 
and the maintenance cost is 0.1p/kWhth; 
• 
a grid connection (allowing import and export of 
electricity when operating parallel to the grid); the 
electricity price at different times is collected from  
Balancing Mechanism Reporting System [23] and 
shown in Fig.1 and when electricity is sold to the 
grid, it is 1p/kWhe; 
Each time interval is half an hour, so in total there are 48 
time intervals. The total heat demand profile is generated for 
a building with floor area of 2500m2 on a sample winter day 
using CHP Sizer Version 2 Software [24]. For the electricity 
demand, each home has 12 basic tasks that consume 
electricity as shown in Table I. These tasks are available to

be scheduled according to the given earliest starting time, 
latest finishing time, their respective processing times and 
power requirements [25]. 
In this case study, there are 10 identical wind generators, 
with an efficiency of 47%. The blade diameter is 1.6m and 
the wind speed is generated from a Weibull distribution 
using MATLAB with a mean velocity of 7m/s. The cut-in 
and cut-out wind speeds are respectively 5m/s and 25m/s, 
and the nominal wind speed is 12m/s. The wind generators 
do not produce any power when the wind speed is under the 
cut-in speed or above the cut-out speed. When the wind 
speed is above the nominal wind speed, the power output is 
at the maximum output, which is equal to the output 
produced at the nominal wind speed. Between cut-in and 
nominal wind speed, the wind generator power output varies 
according to equation 13. 
IV. 
RESULTS  
A. Results with earliest starting time 
The starting time of the case study is from 8am and the 
ending time is 8am the next morning. The earliest starting 
case (a scheduling heuristic) means all the domestic 
electricity appliances are turned on at their given earliest 
starting time. It is similar to common living habits: for 
example, the washing machine would be turned on as soon 
as people want to do some washing, most probably when 
people leave home for work in the morning. The optimal 
heat balance resulting from this case is shown in Fig. 2 and 
the optimal electricity balance is shown in Fig. 3. Equipment 
operation time from each technique is scheduled accordingly 
to minimize the total operation cost. The electrical storage is 
used to store electricity when there is excess electricity; it is 
mainly for utilizing the wind generator output more 
efficiently. There is no excess electricity sold to the utility 
grid. With the earliest starting time schedule, the peak hours 
are mainly during the evening when occupants are back from 
work. During this time, about 51% of the total electricity is 
imported from the utility grid. The total cost is £144.6.  
B. Results with time window 
When a time window is allowed, the domestic tasks as 
well as the equipment operation time are scheduled in order 
to minimize the total electricity cost (equation 20). Tasks, 
such as interior lighting and fridge, have fixed electricity 
consumption time period and have no other alternatives. But 
tasks with flexible operation time can be scattered as much 
as possible to avoid electricity consumption peak and utilize 
electricity generated from local generators as much as 
possible. But when electricity is cheaper from grid, it will be 
imported instead of generating from generators. The optimal 
heat balance is shown in Fig. 4 and the optimal electricity 
balance is shown in Fig. 5. There are only two peak periods: 
early in the morning and in the evening. The other time 
periods have a flat electricity consumption. Only 30% of the 
total electricity is bought from the utility grid, electricity 
being mainly provided by the local distributed resources, and 
there is no electricity sold back to the utility grid. The total 
cost is £117.5, which is 18.7% lower than the earliest starting 
time case. The solution was obtained using CPLEX 11.0.1 in 
GAMS 22.7 on a PC with an Intel Core 2 Duo, 2.99 GHz 
CPU and 3.25GB of RAM. The model involved 36,770 
equations with 53,510 continuous and 52,920 discrete 
variables. This case required 7.5 CPU s to solve.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
In the case study, twelve domestic tasks from thirty 
homes are scheduled. Compared with the case where the 
tasks all start at their earliest possible starting time, the 
electricity consumption peak was decreased from 290kW to 
165kW and the electricity consumption pattern became 
flatter. This peak shaving has the benefit of releasing the 
burden on the central grid and reducing the expense of up-
grading the current grid infrastructure to fulfill increasing 
energy demand. The peak shaving also depends on the 
family living habits: for instance, they may prefer doing the 
washing during night time and would specify their own time 
window for the task. On the other hand, when the domestic 
task scheduling is implemented in real life, it could also 
affect people’s behaviour. 
Given the fixed heat demand profile used in these case 
studies, scheduling the tasks results in a more balanced heat 
supply than the earliest starting time case. This can be seen 
in Fig. 4, which shows that the CHP is providing more heat 
more steadily than in the earliest starting time case 
The tasks shown are assumed to have constant power 
consumption over the processing time but this is not always 
realistic: e.g., washing machines have different power 
consumption during different stages of each program. Future 
scheduling models will need to account for tasks with time-
varying power consumption. 
The smart homes energy consumption scheduling 
problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear 
programming model. According to the case study for a 
winter day, it could provide 18.7% savings compared with 
the earliest starting time case (our current living habit). With 
the objective function, the tasks can be scheduled to 
coincide with the cheapest electricity price while keeping 
their operation within the desired time window. There are 
further benefits more when power is supplied by the wind 
generator. The power output from the wind generator is not 
constant and varies from hour to hour according to the 
weather conditions and other constraints. But when a 
weather forecast can be used to predict the power output 
during the next 24 hours, or even longer, the domestic tasks

can be scheduled to use the output of the wind generators 
when it is available, providing further savings for the 
customers. The scheduling formulation also increases the 
asset utilization, e.g., in the case study, the CHP generator 
was be used more efficiently and became the main supplier 
of electricity and heat.  
In the area of Smart Grids, it is considered that there is 
two-way communication between the power supplier and the 
customers. The power will be distributed according to the 
demand and supply. Traditional methods provide the 
customers only peak price hours while the Smart Grid could 
provide real-time electricity pricing. The process of price 
recalculating is similar to real-time traffic monitoring, 
aiming for a balance between supply and demand. This 
model considers the problem from the point of view of the 
customers, with a fixed electricity price profile. In the future, 
it might be possible to include this model as part of a full 
Smart Grid model where the electricity price is determined 
as part of the optimization, along with the scheduling of 
tasks.
