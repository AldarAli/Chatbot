Abstract—Although the wireless technology nowadays provides
satisfying bandwidth and higher speeds, it still lacks improve-
ments with regard to handoff performance. Existing solutions
for reducing handoff delays are speciﬁc to a particular network
technology or require expensive upgrades of the whole infras-
tructure. In this paper, we investigate performance beneﬁts of
leveraging the Kerberos ticket cashing mechanism for achieving
faster re-authentications in IEEE 802.11 wireless access networks.
For this purpose, we designed a new EAP authentication method,
EAP-Kerberos, and evaluated re-authentication performance in
different scenarios.

I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile wireless stations perform handoffs in order to
change their point of attachment to the network. A handoff
from an old access point to a new access point involves several
steps that each may introduce delays.
A. What causes handoff delays
Handoff latency has long been an acknowledged issue
in wireless networks. Some of the experimental studies [1]
[2] have attributed the handoff delay in wireless local area
networks (IEEE 802.11) to the scanning phase during which
a wireless station discovers neighboring access points. These
studies however, did not take authentication delays into
consideration. In a previous work [3], we have shown that
authentication using the Extensible Authentication Protocol
[4] can take substantial delays especially when authentication
servers are located in remote locations far from the access
point.
B. How security impacts handoff delays
The Extensible Authentication protocol (EAP), is a core
component in standard AAA (Authentication Authorization
and Accounting) frameworks for access control in various
network technologies such as 802.3, 802.11 and 802.16. In
these frameworks, EAP authentication delays may become
an issue especially in roaming situations; AAA frameworks
support cross-domain authentication that enables an access
network to authenticate a roaming client that belongs to a
remote domain. The cross-domain authentication requires
message exchange between the AAA server of the visited
network and the AAA server of the roaming station’s home
network. Because these inter-domain exchanges occur over the
Internet, they are subject to degradations such as packet loss
and network delays which increases the overall authentication
time. When a roaming station changes of access point, the
same authentication procedure takes place again, disrupting
the user trafﬁc at each handoff.
C. Contributions
In this paper, we investigate performance beneﬁts from
using the Kerberos authentication protocol within wireless
authentication frameworks that rely on the Extensible Authen-
tication Protocol (EAP).
By relying on the legacy Kerberos authentication protocol
as deﬁned in [5], our scheme provides the same security prop-
erties as Kerberos and inherits its highly prized performance
and simplicity. There are several aspects in the design of the
Kerberos protocol that makes it suitable for use as the under-
lying authentication mechanism in wireless networks where
handoff performance is a desired property. First, the Kerberos
protocol uses symmetric key cryptography which consumes
much less computing resources and hence introduces less
delays compared to common methods based on public key
cryptography. Second, the use of Tickets in Kerberos allows the
client to perform fast re-authentication through a two round-
trips exchange with the local authentication server, without the
need for contacting any remote entity even if the client is in a
roaming situation (i.e. The client belongs to a domain different
from the domain that owns the local access network).
II. IEEE 802.1X EAP AUTHENTICATION
In order to gain access to the infrastructure, a wireless
station (STA) needs to authenticate and share a key with the

Access Point (AP) using the Extensible Authentication Proto-
col (EAP) [6] and IEEE 802.1X. During EAP authentication,
the AP acts as a pass-through between the STA and a back-
end authentication server. As shown in Figure 1, EAP packets
are transported over IEEE 802.1X between the AP and the
STA in the front-end side, and using a AAA (Authentication
Authorization and Accounting) protocol such as RADIUS [7]
[8] or Diameter [9] [10] between the AP and the authentication
server in the back-end side. After a successful authentication,
the STA and the authentication server derive a shared key
called Master Session Key (MSK). Finally, the the back-end
authentication server sends the MSK to the AP along with a
notiﬁcation of successful authentication.

III. THE KERBEROS
AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL
Kerberos [5] is a widely deployed authentication system.
The authentication process in Kerberos involves principals and
a Key Distribution Center (KDC). Principals represent users
and services registered in the Kerberos domain or realm. The
KDC maintains a database of principals and shares a secret key
with each one of them. In order to access an actual service, the
client must submit valid Kerberos credentials to the service.

(2) AS-REP

Fig. 2: The Kerberos authentication exchange
The Kerberos protocol speciﬁes three exchanges, the Au-
thentication Server (AS) exchange, the Ticket Granting Service
(TGS) exchange and the Client Server (AP) exchange. The
three exchanges are depicted in Figure 2. The AS exchange
allows the client to obtain credentials that it can use to prove
its identity to the KDC. These credentials consist of a Ticket
referred to as Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), and a session key
referred to as TGS session key. A Ticket is a message created
by the Kerberos key distribution center and encrypted using
the secret key of the target service.
The TGS exchange, on the other hand, allows the client to
authenticate to the KDC using the TGT and to obtain a Ticket
for a certain service. After validating the client request (TGS-
REQ), the KDC issues a Ticket for the client and sends it
along with the associated session key in a TGS Reply message
(TGS-REP).
The AP exchange is performed between the client and the
service to authenticate the client before granting it access
to the resources. The client initiates the authentication by
issuing an AP Request message (AP-REQ) that contains a
Ticket for the service. After validating client’s credentials the
service authorizes the client and optionally sends an AP Reply
message (AP-REP) to achieve mutual authentication.
IV. THE EAP KERBEROS
AUTHENTICATION METHOD
The EAP-Kerberos authentication method allows network
clients to use Kerberos credentials to achieve mutual authenti-
cation with back-end authentication servers in wireless access
networks.
The EAP-Kerberos method requires that each network ac-
cess providers deploys a Kerberos realm with one or more
Key distribution centers and that network clients are registered
in the Kerberos principals database. In order to gain network
access, a wireless station must possess a Kerberos login and
password pair that can be used to authenticate the station to
the network access provider’s Kerberos KDC.
In the following sections, we present the design and opera-
tions of the EAP-Kerberos authentication method.
A. Overview
Our approach for using Kerberos in network access control
is based on the notion of Network Access Zones that we
deﬁne as a collection of lightweight access points managed
by a single back-end authentication server. A set of network
access zones that belong to the same provider constitutes an
Access Network. Although an average sized access network
may consist of a single network access zone, the partitioning
of the access network into different zones is important for
larger access networks such as those of wireless Internet
providers. Generally, the use of multiple zones in large access
networks makes management easier and ensures a scalable
infrastructure.
To each network access zone corresponds a Kerberos service
registered in a Kerberos key distribution center managed by
an access network provider. Furthermore, the authentication
server managing a certain zone has the secret Kerberos key of
the corresponding zone. This secret key shared with the KDC

allows the authentication server to validate Kerberos AP-REQ
messages it receives over EAP from wireless clients that are
requesting access in the zone.
In order to gain network access within a zone, a wireless sta-
tion must obtain a service Ticket for the local network access
zone and present the Ticket to the zone’s authentication server.
The EAP-Kerberos method described hereafter speciﬁes how
the station obtains Kerberos credentials and how it uses them
to authenticate and gain network access.
B. Station behavior
The STA and the authentication server negotiate the use of
the EAP-Kerberos method as they would do for legacy EAP
methods [6]. After a station have initiated the EAP-Kerberos
method, the ﬁrst message issued by the authentication server
includes the Kerberos realm name as well as information
identifying the local network access zone (see Section IV-A
for the deﬁnition of network access zones). This information
represented by REALM and ZONE in Figure 3 constitutes the
local zone’s Kerberos principal name that uniquely identiﬁes
it within the global Kerberos name space.
Upon reception of this ﬁrst message, the STA checks its
Kerberos credential cache for service Tickets and Kerberos
Ticket Granting Tickets. Depending on what credentials are
available, the station’s behavior varies as follows.
1) Service Ticket for the local zone available:
If the
station has a Kerberos service Ticket for the local zone in
its credential cache, then the STA initiates a Kerberos AP
exchange over EAP with the authentication server managing
the local zone.
2) Ticket Granting Ticket for local realm available: If the
STA does not have a Ticket for the zone, but has a Ticket
Granting Ticket for the local zone’s Kerberos realm, then
the STA must acquire a Ticket by performing a Kerberos
TGS exchange with the Key Distribution Center where the
zone is registered. The TGS exchange is tunneled in EAP
between the STA and the local zone’s authentication server.
From there, the local zone’s authentication server proxies the
TGS exchange between the STA and the Kerberos KDC. For
this purpose, the authentication server extracts the TGS-REQ
message from the EAP-Kerberos message issued by the
STA and sends it to the Kerberos KDC. The reply message
from the KDC is sent back to the STA in an EAP-Kerberos
message. After obtaining the service Ticket, the STA can
perform an AP exchange with the authentication server.
3) No tickets available: If the STA does not have a service
Ticket for the zone nor a TGT for the local realm, then it
ﬁrst needs to obtain a TGT for the local realm. The process
of obtaining a TGT for the local realm depends on whether
the Kerberos realm where the zone is registered is the same
as the STA’s home Kerberos realm or not. In the former case,
the STA uses an AS exchange with the Kerberos KDC of the
local realm. In the latter case, the STA ﬁrst gets a TGT for its

KDC, then, the STA performs Kerberos cross-realm TGS
exchanges as speciﬁed in [5]. After the STA has obtained a
TGT for the local realm, it performs a TGS exchange with
the local realm’s KDC to obtain a service Ticket for the local
zone, then, it initiates an AP exchange with the local zone’s
authentication server to achieve mutual authentication and
gain network access.
C. Use cases
When a STA is booted or is performing a handoff from
an access point to another, it follows the same behavior
described in Section IV-B. In the following, we provide more
details and illustrate how the EAP-Kerberos method works in
different use cases.
1) Initial authentication in the home network: The ﬁrst
use case we consider is the case where the STA needs to
gain network connectivity through a network access zone that
belongs to the station’s home domain (e.g, when a subscriber
is using her ISP’s infrastructure). If the STA does not possess
any cached Kerberos credentials for network access, then it
needs to carry out three Kerberos exchanges; AS and TGS
exchanges with the Kerberos KDC and an AP exchange with
the authentication server managing the local network access
zone.
As shown in Figure 3, the STA receives the Kerberos realm
name (REALM) as well as the current zone’s principal name
(ZONE) in the initial EAP-Kerberos message issued by the
zone’s RADIUS authentication server. Since the STA does not
possess any credentials yet, it ﬁrst obtains a TGT using an
AS exchange relayed by the access network infrastructure to
283

the STA’s home Kerberos KDC. The EAP-Kerberos message
carrying the AS-REQ message also contains the Kerberos
realm name of the STA’s home KDC. This information, will
be used by the RADIUS server to locate the IP address
of the Kerberos KDC to which the Kerberos message must
be forwarded. In practice, IP addresses of Kerberos KDCs
are resolved from Kerberos realm names using DNS SRV
records[11] or mappings using static conﬁguration ﬁles.
After obtaining the TGT, the STA requests a service ticket
for the service
“knas/zone1.domain.com@DOMAIN.COM”.
For
this,
the
STA performs a TGS exchange with the Kerberos KDC of the
current zone. As with the AS exchange, the TGS exchange is
relayed by the RADIUS authentication server. The STA then
initiates an AP exchange to authenticate with the RADIUS
server managing the network access zone. After the AP
exchange is completed, the STA issues a FINISH message
to indicate to the RADIUS server that mutual authentication
has been established. The authentication server then sends
the EAP Master Session Key (MSK) to the AP. Finally, the
STA and the AP use the shared MSK to establish a security
association. In the case of IEEE 802.11, they perform the
four-way handshake to derive Transient Session Keys from
the MSK.
2) Intra-zone Handoff: The ﬁrst handoff scenario we con-
sider consists of the mobile STA’s handoff within the same
network access zone. In this case, the STA does not need
to acquire new credentials since it already has a Ticket for
the local zone (unless when the Ticket has expired). The
authentication with the access network only requires an AP
exchange with the local authentication server.

within the zone and no entities in remote locations are
involved in the intra-zone handoff process.
3) Inter-zone Handoff: When the STA moves to a new
access network zone, it may need to acquire a new Ticket for
the new zone. If the new zone belongs to the same access
network as the previous zone, the STA can re-use the TGT
for the local realm to obtain a service Ticket for the new
zone then authenticate with the new zone’s authentication
server. The inter-zone handoff scenario, as shown in Figure
5, requires an additional round-trip (for a total of 4.5) in
comparison to the intra-zone handoff scenario.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
We implemented the EAP-Kerberos method by extend-
ing the open-source hostapd [12] RADIUS server and the
wpa supplicant [13] EAP supplicant. For comparison, we
performed performance evaluation of the EAP-PEAPv0 au-
thentication method using Microsoft Windows 2003 server’s
Internet Authentication Server (IAS) on the same test-bed.
The test-bed consisted of two access networks, each com-
posed of one network access zone. The two network access
zones belong to different Kerberos realms and each has its own
RADIUS authentication server and Kerberos Key Distribution
Center. In order to emulate network delays, we used the Linux
netem [14] utility. The resulting test-bed was equivalent to the
reference architecture depicted in Figure 6.
Figure 7 shows authentication delays using the EAP-
Kerberos method in different scenarios. The re-authentication
delay with EAP-Kerberos (30ms) is the same whether the
wireless station is in its home network or in a visited network.
When comparing intra-zone re-authentication delays in the
home access network for the EAP-PEAPv0 method (Figure 8a)

and the EAP-Kerberos method (Figure 7a), we can notice that
both methods offer similar performance. However, in roaming
scenarios when the station is performing handoffs in a visited
access network, the EAP-Kerberos method shows superior
performance.
As shown in Figure 7b, intra-zone re-authentication delays
remained acceptable in the roaming case for EAP-Kerberos
(30ms) while re-authentication latency increased about four
folds from 30ms to around 120ms for EAP-PEAPv0 (Figure
8b). This is due to the fact that EAP-PEAPv0 (as it is the case
for all legacy EAP authentication methods) require message
exchange with the roaming station’s home RADIUS server
for performing re-authentications in foreign access networks
while the EAP-Kerberos method involves only entities in the
the visited access network.
VI. CONCLUSION
In order to achieve true ubiquitous applications, the handoff
delays in wireless networks must be kept to the minimum.
Several steps in the handoff process may be subject to en-
hancements. In this paper, we consider authentication delays
during handoffs. The problem with handoff latency arises
when a roaming wireless station performs handoffs in a foreign
access network. The inter-domain exchanges necessary for

authenticating the roaming station may introduce large delays
that would affect quality of service in real-time applications.
We have designed, implemented and evaluated a Kerberos-
based EAP authentication method that achieves strong au-
thentication with reduced latency during handoffs. Experi-
mental results from our test-bed show that EAP-Kerberos re-
authentications in roaming scenarios took around 30 millisec-
onds, more than 3 times faster than EAP-PEAPv0 that took
around 120 milliseconds.
When compared to existing solutions for reducing EAP
re-authentication delays such as IEEE 802.11r [15] and
ERP [16], the approach presented in this paper has three
main advantages; (1) The proposed method extends the EAP
layer by specifying a new EAP method which ensures that
the proposed approach is link layer independent. (2) The
proposed approach does not require changes in the access
point, and therefore it has an advantage from deployment
cost point of view, and (3) The EAP method proposed
in this paper supports fast inter access point and inter
access network handoffs by relying on Kerberos cross-realm
authentication capabilities. Other existing approaches enable
fast re-authentication only within the same access network.
