Abstract - Essential amino acids exist normally in solid state, 
but in the environment they are often in contact with water or 
other liquids. The stability of solid state amino acids has been 
investigated under controlled atmosphere and pressure 
conditions. The amino acids stability in liquid water 
environment is important, especially for protein permanency 
and for human and animal food usage. In this work, the full set 
of essential amino acids are investigated in water environment 
at normal atmospheric pressure and under thermal shocks 
with slew rate as high as 4ºC/sec applied in a fiber optic 
capillary sensor set up. Reactions in some essential amino acids 
happen at temperatures lower than 80C. The conclusion is 
that the stability of amino acids in water environment is 
different from their stability in solid state form.

 INTRODUCTION 
A. Essential amino acids characteristics 
Amino acids contain amine (NH2) and carboxylic acid 
(COOH) functional groups, along with a side-chain specific 
to each amino acid, as shown in Figure 1. Amino acids are 
the basic bioelements of proteins, important macromolecules 
for the functions of humans and animals.  
Amino acids are built of structural units called monomers 
that can join together to form short polymer chains called 
peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or 
proteins. Amino acids that are precursors to proteins are 
called proteinogenic amino acids. There are 23 of 
proteinogenic amino acids, while 20 of them are directly 
encoded by the universal genetic code. Humans can 
synthesize 11 of these 20. The other 9 are called essential 
amino acids and must be consumed in the diet. The essential 
amino acids are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, 
methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. 
The essential amino acids in pure form exist in solid state. In 
the gas environment, the interactions of amino acids are 
enabled by Van der Waals forces, by electrostatic charge 
forces and, in some cases, by the single sigma bond that 
exists between the hydrogens. In the water environment, 
amino acids interactions are influenced by the electrostatic 
charge of the water particles and by the hydrogen bonds. The 
general properties of amino acids are presented in Table I.

Amino acids are usually classified into groups according 
to the properties of their side-chains. Depending on the side-
chain, an amino acid dissolved in liquid water environment 
could form a weakly acidic or a weakly basic solution. An 
amino acid is a hydrophilic substance when its side-chain is 
polar or carries a charge in liquid water environment. It 
would be a hydrophobic substance if the side-chain was 
nonpolar or neutral [1]. The effect of liquid water on the 
structure of amino acids is important because liquid water 
takes part in a wide range of reactions within a biological 
cell, and is an integral part of all proteins.  
The amino acids side chains have a strong influence on 
how the protein behaves in liquid. For example, the structure 
of the lysine molecule in liquid differs for different charge 
states [2]. Below pH 9 both amino groups are protonated. 
Around pH 9, the α-amino group is protonated and the amino 
group of the side chain is not. Above pH 10.5 both amino 
groups are deprotonated. Therefore, lysine in drinking water 
is characterized by both amino groups protonated.  
The requirements of essential amino acids of humans and 
the efficiency of amino acids in protein utilization at 
maintenance and sub-maintenance levels have been 
investigated [3]. Amino acids in the form of proteins are the 
second-largest component (water being the largest) of human 
muscles, cells and other tissues. Along with proteins, amino 
acids 
perform 
critical 
roles 
in 
the 
processes 
of 
neurotransmitter transport and of biosynthesis. The essential 
amino acids requirements in people’s diet change 
significantly with their age [4].  
The indicative values of amino acids diet requirement 
and amino acids composition of body protein are presented 
in Table II. Because it has to be present in food, lysine is one 
of the most interesting of essential amino acids. In many 
cases, lysine is supplemented into the animal and vegetarian 
feedstuffs [5]. 
Purified lysine is safe for human. Conventional dosages 
of lysine supplementation are of 3 to 6 grams daily [6]. One 
common use for lysine is the treatment of cold sores caused 
by herpes virus [7].

B. Essential amino acids examination in water enviroment 
The thermal decomposition of amino acids depends on 
the environment [8]. The study of the thermal decomposition 
of amino acids in water environment is important, because it 
would allow refining the protein degradation model [9]. So 
far, the decomposition behavior of amino acids has been 
selectively investigated in water at high-temperature and 
high-pressure in a continuous-flow tubular reactor. The 
reactions were carried out in the temperature range of 200-
340C at a pressure of 20 MPa [10]. The mechanisms of heat 
damage in proteins when amino acids were in contact with 
water have been also examined. It was shown that lysine’s 
disintegration may start when the temperature exceeded 
37°C [11]. 
In this work, the possibilities of thermal decomposition 
of essential amino acids in water environment in conditions 
simulating those typical for some methods of thermal 
preparation of food were examined.  
The paper consists of 5 sections. First section was the 
introduction where the amino acids properties were 
discussed and the aim of work is presented. Second section 
describes the proposed for this purpose experiment set-up.  
The examination results of essential amino acids are 
presented in section three. In the section four, the discussion 
of obtained results and their classification is proposed. The 
short conclusion of proposed examination is gathered in 
section five. 
II. 
EXPERIMENT SET-UP 
To perform our experiments we used a photonic capillary 
sensor capable of producing a temperature ramp of over 
4°C/sec in a liquid water environment. The sensor head 
schematic side cross-section is shown schematically in 
Figure 2. The light traces, from source to receiving fibers, for 
bubble presence, are shown schematically in Figure 3. In this 
situation, the received signals are minimal. When capillary is 
uniformly filled with liquid for the light travelling from 
source fiber the light refraction in liquid occurs, and reflected 
ray reaches received fiber.

Therefore, the sensor works on the principle of optical 
intensity changes taking place in dynamically forced 
measurement cycles. The sensor monitored simultaneously 
the thermodynamic and optical parameters of liquids [12]. It 
used an optical capillary in which the phase change from 
liquid to gas (a creation of a gas bubble in the liquid) was 
forced by local heating while the propagation of light across 
the capillary was monitored. After the bubble of gas was 
created, the local heating was switched off, but the bubble 
expansion still forced the flow of the liquid. The forced 
liquid flow in the capillary depended strongly on the vapor 
pressure and could be classified by a cavitating or non-
cavitating type [13]. After the local heating, the gas phase 
could be absorbed in the liquid, or remain in the form of a 
small bubble. As a result of the decomposition of the 
components of the liquid, or alternatively, when the forced 
flown was turbulent or of the cavitating type, a series of air 
bubbles might exist in the liquid.  
The capillary head used in this work was a modified 
version of one presented by Borecki et al [14]. The detection 
of the reflected signal was supplemented with the detection 
of scattered signal. The optical fibers were moved to the 
position in which their axes crossed in the central 
intersection point of the hybrid micro heater and the 
capillary. That enabled the monitoring of precipitation of the 
solution’s components. Instead of the 2.5mm wide element 
using for the micro-heater [14], a new 1.5mm wide SiC 
heating element was developed. This way, the local heating 
area dimensions get closer to the dimensions of the optical 
beams than in our previous investigations. The TSP 700-850 
from Polymicro Inc. capillaries were cut into 10 cm sections. 
In experiments capillaries with both ends closed were used. 
On the measuring head large core optical fibers BFH 37-600 
from Thorlabs were installed.  
As light source, a fiber coupled laser device S1FC675 
from Thorlabs was applied. The diode wavelength was 
675nm. The source was electrically modulated with 1kHz 
frequency from a Rigol function generator DG2021. The 
optical power at the end of light source fiber was set to 
0.1mW, by using the modulation signal amplitude, offset and 
knob of laser device.  
The optoelectronic detection unit coupled to large core 
optical fibers was of our own developed construction. It is 
modified version presented in [14]. It is characterized by 
switchable from 10nW to 1mW detection optical range. 
Lower detection threshold, for output refresh rate less than 
100Hz, is 50pW. The response time, for full scale signal 
change, is lower than 10ms. The optoelectronic unit was 
connected to a PC by an analog input of IOtech Personal daq 
3000 data acquisition system. That system was also used to 
control the laboratory power supply HM8143 of the micro 
heater. The micro heater was powered with 5W in periods 
shorter than 30s. To operate the system, at a 0.1s sampling 
rate, script in DasyLab 10 was designed. 
The initial experiments were made using capillaries filed 
with deionized water, as presented in Figures 4 and 5. As can 
be seen in Figure 4, the scattered signal was constant during 
the sample’s local heating, meaning that precipitated 
components were not present in the water. The presence of a 
moving boundary between the gas and the liquid phases can 
be correlated with the peak in scattered signal. The deionized 
water boiled in the measurement cycle in the time range 
from 17.1 to 25 seconds, corresponding to a boiling 
temperature that could be explained by the superheating of 
water, when at atmospheric pressure it could reach 120°C. 
The conditions for superheating of water are fast heating of a 
not vibrating sample of clear water in a vessel with smooth 
walls. Those conditions were maintained in the analyzed 
measurement cycle.

and the scattered signal during heating.

During the calibration of the sensor the temperature 
distribution in the capillary optrode was registered with the 
use of R300 NEC thermo-vision camera and the InfReC 
software. The measured and calculated water temperatures 
during the measurement cycles are presented in Figure 6. 
The obtained results confirm boiling at 100°C in 17.1 
seconds of local heating. The extrapolation of the results 
showed that the temperature of superheating of water in the 
analyzed conditions did not exceed 120°C. 
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Deionized water was used for making solutions at 
100mM/dm3 concentrations containing amino acids of 99% 
Reagent Plus purity obtained from Sigma Inc [15]. Ten 
experiments series for each examined amino acid were 
performed. Scattered signals during local heating in all 
experiments were stable so solid state precipitates did not 
form. Therefore, these signals are not presented in following 
records. The random selected two characteristics of 
experiment series refracted and reflected signal, for each 
examined amino acid, are presented in subsequent figures.  
The amino acid simplest in structure is glycine. It is not 
an essential amino acid. Its solubility in water is 24.99g/100 
mL at 25°C and the decomposition temperature of glycine 
was about 230°C.  
 
Figure 7.   The measurement cycle of glycine 
A solution of 100 mM/dm3 of glycine in water was used 
for the measurement cycles presented in Figure 7. The 
glicine measurement cycle was similar to that of water, as 
was expected, because the solution of glycine in water was 
uniform, its concentration did not approach the solubility 
limits. 
A. Examination of essential amino acids 
The measurement cycle of histidine is presented in 
Figure 8. The histidine solution starts boiling in 15.8-17.1 
seconds of the measurement cycle, slightly before sample 
reached 100°C. In our opinion, the gas product of 
decomposition had a relatively higher pressure than that of 
water steam. This gas phase caused turbulent flow of liquid, 
as could be concluded from the highly non monotonic 
measurement cycle characteristic observed after the micro 
heater switch off.  
 
 
Figure 8.   The measurement cycle of histidine  
Isoleucine (C6H13NO2) in water solution generated the 
gas phase in the range of 6.3-11.3 seconds of the 
measurement cycle, which was faster than water and 
histidine. The gas phase was next absorbed, as depicted in 
Figure 9. Leucine (C6H13NO2) measurement cycle is shown 
in Figure 10.

Figure 9.   The measurement cycle of isoleucine  
 
Figure 10.   The measurement cycle of leucine  
The measurement cycles of leucine had the same course 
as isoleucine, with the gas phase appearance in 6 seconds. 
The measurement cycles of isoleucine and leucine were 
similar, probably due to the small difference of their 
structures as their molecular formula is the same. 
The measurement cycle of lysine is presented in 
Figure 11.  
 
 
Figure 11.  The measurement cycle of lysine  
Lysine (C6H14N2O2) has the same carbon number as 
isoleucine and leucine, but measured characteristics differs 
significantly. The generation of the gas phase in the lysine 
solution was the most violent of the examined essential 
amino acids. It caused the cork of the capillary to shoot out 
in each measurement cycle. Therefore, the stable low level 
signal after the shut off of micro heater can be observed. The 
gas phase generation occurred in the range from 8.1 to 9.0 
seconds of the cycle. 
The methionine measurement cycle of Figure 12 shows 
similarity with the water cycle of Figure 5.  
 
 
Figure 12.  The measurement cycle of methionine  
Phenylalanine was characterized in the measurement 
cycle by a rapid gas phase creation in 9.4-9.8 seconds, as 
shown in Figure 13. 
 
 
Figure 13.  The measurement cycle of phenylalanine 
Threonine decomposition occurred in 15.5-16.3 seconds 
of the measurement cycle, with a turbid flow of liquid, as 
presented in Figure 14.  
The measurement cycle of tryptophan of Figure 15 is 
similar to the cycle of water.  
Valine has the measurement cycle similar to water and 
tryptophan, as depicted in Figure 16.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 
Sensing of essential amino acids under fast thermal 
shocks in water environment shows that the amino acids 
solutions behavior can be described according to the form of 
gas phase creation as 1) similar to water (H2O-like); 2) early; 
and 3) impetuous and early, as listed in Table III. The water-
like behavior can be described as one with the bubble 
appearance later than 16 seconds of the measurement cycle. 
The early gas phase creation can be described as when the 
gas phase creation happens before 16 seconds of local 
heating - below 80ºC. Impetuous and early gas phase 
creation occurs when, additionally, the gas phase forces rapid 
or turbid solution flow.

Four distinct cases are of interest. The early gas phase 
creation of leucine and isoleucine happens because they have 
similar structures and parameters. The impetuous and early 
gas phase creation happens for lysine and phenylalanine. 
On the other hand, the degradation of amino acids in 
water environment for situations involving enzymatic 
oxidation or hydrolytic deamination is well-known [16].

CONCLUSION 
Developed capillary sensor set-up enables sensing of 
essential amino acids behavior under fast thermal shocks in 
liquid water environment. Experiment show that, a fast 
temperature increase may act as a reaction catalyst for the 
disintegration of some amino acids, particularly lysine. This 
can be used for explaining, efficiency of herpes virus curing 
with lysine supplementation in some group of peoples. This 
can also clarify traditional medicine recommendations of raw 
parsley and chives consumption, which can be compiled with 
highest in vegetables lysine concentration [17]. Therefore, 
food preparation processes with fast ramp ups of 
temperature, are not ideal when the food is to be a source of 
amino acids. Consequently, we intend to examine amino 
acids stability in oil environment as some oriental kitchen 
methods base on putting shredded food into boiling oil or 
heated clarified butter which may lead to proven lysine 
deficit of India people [18]. 
The phenomena of lysine disintegration may be used in 
new nanotechnology medical or diagnostic particles carriers 
using graphene oxide [19]. That effect will be the subject of

our further studies. We will concentrate on examining the 
presence of products while heating graphene oxide - amino 
acids solutions in liquid water environment.
