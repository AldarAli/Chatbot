I. INTRODUCTION 
Resilience against natural disasters is a field of growing 
importance, especially given the current changes in climate 
and environment. A crisis, whose cause can be accidental or 
intentionally induced, is a sudden situation, unexpected with 
severe adverse consequences for humans and organizations. 
According to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
Business Advisory Council, the Asia-Pacific region 
e[periences oYer 70% of the Zorld¶s natural disasters [1]. 
With the heavy floods, earthquakes and storm damaging parts 
of Asia-Pacific over the past years, it has become clear that 
disaster preparedness is an absolute must for this area. 
Nevertheless, this issue is not specific to Asia-Pacific 
countries only and European Environment Agency reported in 
2017 [2] that ³efforts to reduce disaster risk and at the same 
time adapt to a changing climate have become a global and 
European priorit\´. As a consequence, research in this field is 
of joint interest being a challenge for both, European and 
Asian partners. As IT infrastructures are playing an increasing 
role in our economy, their resilience against natural disasters 
is of utmost importance. Promoting disaster resilient 
Information 
and 
Communication 
Technology 
(ICT) 
frameworks was one of the main recommendations of APEC 
Business Advisory Council to APEC Leaders in its 2014 
report [3]. Network service providers also share this objective 
in the 2015 reports of the NGMN Alliance [4] that requires 
resilience of 5G networks during natural disasters.  
Crisis management requires efficient collaboration between a 
certain number of public, as well as private actors, acting in a 
coordinated way in order to solve the crisis and reduce its 
impacts. Mobilizing institutional stakeholders, launching 
assessed processes, deploying emergency communications for 
disaster relief are among the response facilities. 
The increasing adoption of wireless communication 
technologies ± LTE/4G/5G, wifi, satellite ± and the 
commercial infrastructures widely available or deployed on 
demand in case of a disaster, are at the heart of the information 
systems to consider [5]. Because of their nature, and the 
services they render, these information systems allow for 
incredible and amazing new usages and/or new sources of 
information. Actors may exchange and share all types of 
multimedia information (voice, photos, live videos, 
georeferenced information, etc) and content-rich services 
(social media) providing a better appreciation and awareness 
of the current situation allowing a more efficient and reliable 
coordination for decision making and strengthening 
emergency response. 
These new communication channels allow crisis cells to 
involve citizens in a participative approach to extend and 
leverage both the information dissemination and collection 
perimeters [6]. The\ can be seen as a ³place for harYesting´ 
information during a crisis event to determine what is 
happening on the ground and providing relevant direct real-
time feedbacks.  
Given the huge amount of raw data from a large diversity 
of sources mostly unstructured, it becomes impossible for a 
human to process the whole and take the right decisions 
related to the identified crisis situations. Information sources 
analytics should help not only in defining and identifying 
situations, but also in building a decision support system. Such 
cross-fertilization analysis should be gathered within a 
dedicated environment integrating support functions such as 
storage, filter, aggregation, inference and fusion of data and 
their associated meta-data.

Figure 1. Open research questions 
 
Crisis 
management 
processes 
involve 
complex 
management decisions to automatically adapt the deployed IT 
systems. As a consequence, crisis IT management systems 
require a better understanding of the dynamics of the 
environment which raises important research challenges on: 
x 
Eliciting/expressing/validating adaptive systems 
requirements. 
x 
Expressing/managing/validating adaptive security 
and/or management policies. 
x 
Dynamically enforcing adaptive security and/or 
management policies. 
Situational Awareness (SA), describes the idealized state 
of understanding what is happening in an event involving 
many actors and other moving entities, especially with respect 
to the needs of command and control operations. SA theory 
provides an interesting construct to structure the dynamics of 
the environment in a consistent way [7]. Endsley and Garland 
[8] define SA as ³the perception of the elements in the 
environment within a volume of time and space (level 1), the 
comprehension of their meaning (level 2), and the projection 
of their status in the near future (leYel 3)´. Since ³knowing 
Zhat¶s going on so \ou can figure Zhat to do´ [9] is a good 
principle, situation awareness can facilitate the decision 
making process. Although this construct was initially 
developed in the military domain, researchers are now trying 
to apply it to other areas such IT risk management [10] or 
incidence management in 5G networks [11]. 
In this article, we intend to consider open issues related to 
a holistic approach to improve crisis management efficiency 
during disaster by applying situation awareness principles to 
dynamic IT crisis management. 
A situational awareness perspective is sound for 
anticipating how individuals, groups and communities can use 
information contributed by others especially in a social media 
context. We will discuss what social media may contribute to 
situational awareness. We expect to launch situation 
characteristics extraction as well as situational updates 
labeling from, for instance tweets in the Thai language. 
Natural Language Processing techniques will be assessed 
contributing 
in 
detecting 
and 
extracting 
emergency 
knowledge from the social media streams. These situational 
ACTUATOR
information will be hence transformed into structured 
information relevant for the definition of operational policies. 
Besides, we have developed dynSMAUG, a dynamic 
security management framework driven by situations [12] that 
combines a dynamic policy based management system with 
situation awareness. On the basis of our dynSMAUG system 
(Figure 1), we investigate how to integrate unstructured 
information coming from social media to dynamic IT 
management and adapt our management system to crisis 
management. This analysis highlights broader open research 
questions 
related 
to 
governing 
the 
operational 
IT 
infrastructure resilience as well as aligning crisis information 
system during natural disaster crises. 
The rest of the article is structured as follows. Sections 2 
to 5 describe the open research questions and related works. 
Section 6 complements this analysis by listing recent and 
current related research projects. Finally, Section 7 concludes 
the article. 
II. EXPRESSING EMERGENCY/CRISIS PROCEDURES INTO THE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
Our dynamic management system has to operate within a 
global crisis management plan. The security and management 
decisions taken by our command centre must comply with the 
existing emergency procedures. The main goal should be to 
investigate the expression of emergency procedures using a 
situation driven policy language. The idea consists in finding 
official crisis procedures and express them into our language. 
However, how to write policies to dynamically manage IT 
systems during natural disaster crisis? 
McHugh and Sheth [13] describe how to construct an 
emergenc\ procedure floZchart Zhere ³The objectiYe of the 
emergency procedures is to be able to protect lives and 
minimi]e damage to assets and to tr\ to µnip the incident in the 
bud¶ before it escalates into a disaster.´ The\ highlight the 
process to develop flow charts for emergency procedures, 
which in themselves are only able to summarize what needs 
to be done and should be used during top-level designs, 
trainings and awareness campaigns.  
Hanachi et al. [14] adYocate to go further ³transforming a 
plan into a process providing  an accurate and machine-
readable specification of actions to be done in the field, a 
better 
common 
understanding 
between 
stakeholders 
responsible for these actions and a means to analyse, simulate 
and eYaluate the crisis response before launching it«´ 
The ideal crisis policy language should address the 
expression of the policies governing crisis resolution at the 
business level. This language should also allow decision crisis 
cells to base their policies on relevant facts observed by the 
sensors in the impacted field and on the available business 
knowledge extracted from the plans, the stakeholders and their 
capacities. 
We think that our situational awareness policy language is 
a good candidate to meet the crisis resolution processes 
requirements. In dynSMAUG, security policiesare expressed 
in a generic way: ³when situation and conditions then 
authorization decision and/or obligation(s)´.  
On the one hand, situations allow capturing the dynamic 
constraints (time, location, etc.) and organize them into a 
stable and logical concept. Situation oriented policies are 
simpler and more readable. Also, managing high level 
policies, close to the decision crisis cell needs, reduces the gap 
between policies requirements and the effective policy 
enforced by stakeholders, and then limits the policy translation 
errors. On the other hand, making policies more independent 
from technical constraints minimizes the impact of changing 
mechanisms and simplifies the policy life cycle management.  
This approach has proven to be generic being applied to 
different use cases such as dynamic security management  
[12], service-oriented architectures [15], virtual organizations 
[16], healthcare urgency management by enforcing break-the-
glass [17] or permissions-based workflow management [18].  
III. HOW TO ADAPT THE DYNSMAUG ARCHITECTURE TO 
NATURAL DISASTER CRISIS ENVIRONMENT? 
Resilience of networks is also under active consideration 
by network service providers being one of the main goals of 
future 5G networks. The NGMN Alliance [4] requires that 
³5G should be able to proYide robust communications in case 
of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, 
hurricanes, etc.´ From a more technical point of YieZ, 5G 
networks are expected, by the 5GPP (https://5g-ppp.eu/), to be 
a multi-access network in order to deserve 7 trillion wireless 
devices serving over 7 billion people creating a secure, 
reliable and dependable Internet Zith a ³]ero perceiYed´ 
downtime for services provision. To reach such one-network-
fits-all concept, 5G adopts a new paradigm for computing and 
infrastructure including Software Defined Networks (SDN), 
Network 
Function 
Virtualization 
(NFV) 
and 
Cloud 
Computing  [4], [19]. The objective is enabling the automation 
of network service provisioning and management as software 
functions running on commodity hardware to support efficient 
network resource utilization, quicker operational changes, and 
faster service provisioning cycles. The benefits expected are 
the shared infrastructure, the services deployment cost and the 
promising disruptive technologies [13], [20], [21]. 
We envision building a self-organized Public Protection 
and Disaster Relief (PPDR) network using a two-tier 
architecture that introduces two classes of spectrum users: a) 
primary users -- the users owning a license to operate on a 
particular frequency, and b) secondary users ± unlicensed 
users who access a particular frequency only if the respective 
primary users do not need it. The PPDR will act as primary 
user in the frequencies allocated to it (698 ± 703/753 ± 758 
MHz and 733 ± 736/788 ± 791 MHz) and use it for mission-
critical application such as voice. On the other hand, to enable 
new application, such as the exchange of high-definition 
videos and images, PPDR will access other spectrum in the 
role of secondary user. 
This 
architecture 
can 
significantly 
improve 
the 
performance of the PPDR network, however, it requires the 
PPDR radios, especially when acting as secondary user, to be 
cognitive. This means radios capable of intelligently adapting 
parameters, such as transmission frequency, power, etc.  
The vision we would like to share can get materialized 
thanks to the 3 following actions: 
- 
Technologies such as mmwave, drones, MIMO and 
C-RAN can be combined and utilized in the design of 
the new network architecture. The idea is to adapt the 
network to priorities and users/network conditions so 
as to deliver ultra-high bit rates over targeted 
geographical areas. In case of emergency, mobile 
access network elements (mainly BS elements carried 
by drones and ground mobile BSs) can be utilized for 
92

better spectrum management and throughput delivery. 
In this context, we plan to conceive algorithms able to 
dynamically and quickly make decisions on optimal 
number and locations of resources to be allocated. 
- 
The design of a mechanism that, depending on the 
traffic¶s qualit\ of serYice requirements and possibl\ 
on external events (e.g. an emergency situation), can 
decide dynamically whether to transmit the traffic 
over the PPDR dedicated frequencies, thus setting the 
radio to act as primary user, or over spectrum accessed 
opportunistically, thus setting the radio to act as 
secondary user. This mechanism can also participate 
in 
the 
dynamic 
reconfiguration 
of 
network 
components (such as edge gateways) and can be 
implemented as part of a Network Functions 
Virtualization (NFV) architecture deployed at the 
PPDR level [20], [22]. 
- 
The current design of dynSMAUG includes single 
points of failure (the command center and the 
situation manager) which does not meet crisis IT 
requirements. We intend to distribute this entity to 
dynamically adapt dynSMAUG to 5G network 
requirements during natural disaster crisis. 
IV. HOW TO CAPTURE NON STRUCTURED CONTEXT EVENTS? 
FOR INSTANCE, TWEETS IN THAI 
This section targets situation characteristics extraction as 
well as situational updates labelling from social media in 
general and for instance tweets in the Thai language. Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) techniques are contributing in 
detecting and extracting emergency knowledge from the 
social media streams. These situational information are hence 
transformed into structured information relevant for the 
characterization 
of 
the 
situations 
under 
operational 
deployment. 
NLP is a kind of machine learning and artificial 
intelligence that can be used to interact with human and 
computers in natural languages. The objective of NLP is to 
achieve human-like comprehension of texts/languages. 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a part of NLP 
information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named 
entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names 
of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times etc. 
NER solutions can be divided into rule-based, machine 
learning based and hybrid methods [23]. 
Many related works have analysed twitter streams for 
crisis detection. Thusly in [24], the authors analysed the 
contribution of twitter to situational awareness during two 
natural hazards events. Corvey et al. [25] pointed out that 
using twitter in mass emergency requires NLP techniques. 
Neubig et al. [26] quickly created a NLP system to aid the 
relief efforts during the 2011 East Japan Earthquake and were 
able to effectively deliver new information about the safety of 
over 100 people in the disaster stricken area to a central 
repository for safety information. Ifrim et al. [27] proved that 
aggressive lettering of tweets based on length and structure, 
combined with hierarchical clustering of tweets and ranking 
of the resulting clusters, achieves encouraging results in 
detecting events from twitter. Klein et al. [28] proposed a 
combined structural and content based analysis approach to 
detect and extract emergency knowledge from twitter streams. 
Finally, Imran et al. [29] presented human-annotated Twitter 
corpora collected during 19 different crises that took place 
between 2013 and 2015. They used these corpora to train 
machine-learning classifiers to demonstrate the utility of the 
annotations. 
However, these related works do not deal with Thai 
language that has specific features such as not marking word 
boundaries. As a consequence, an NLP model dedicated to 
twitter messages in Thai is required. We can reuse some 
existing tools like LexTo [30] or pyThaiNLP [31]. They will 
let us focus on how to turning text-based social media stream 
into structured events augmenting the knowledge on the 
disaster relief and the crisis resolution. 
All these cited related works show how to turn social 
media streams into structured events augmenting the 
knowledge one may have in the disaster relief and in the crisis 
resolution. However, social media being not trusted 
information may convey fake news. This issue is still an open 
question but more and more researchers are focussing on it 
[32]. 
V. HOW TO CALCULATE A NATURAL DISASTER CRISIS 
SITUATION? 
As pointed out by Castillo [33], ³Social media is an 
invaluable source of time-critical information during a crisis. 
However, emergency response and humanitarian relief 
organizations that would like to use this information struggle 
with an avalanche of social media messages that exceeds 
human capacit\ to process.´ Situation awareness theory 
provides a relevant support to deal with such issues. 
A situation is a particular time frame of interest that has a 
beginning, a life span and an end [34]. The beginning and the 
end of a situation are determined by combining multiple 
events coming from multiple sensors and occurring at 
different moments. Indeed, a situation involves multiple 
entities and multiple conditions. The beginning and the end of 
a situation cannot be simple events captured by a unique 
sensor. In addition, events being instantaneous, combining 
multiple events requires complex temporal operators (event 
ordering, event existence/absence, time windows, etc.) to 
specify the beginning and end of situations. 
Currently, situations in dynSMAUG are described using 
Complex Event Processing techniques [35]. CEP solutions 
allow to specify complex events through complex event 
patterns that match incoming event notifications on the basis 
of their content as well as some ordering relationships on 
them. We choose the open source event processing 
implementation called Esper, which is maintained by 
Espertech. For specifying complex event patterns, Esper 
offers a stream-oriented language called Event Processing 
Language (EPL) that is an extension of SQL for processing 
events (e.g., windows definition and interaction, timed-data 
arithmetic definition, etc.). We previously showed it is 
possible to combine real time events with log events to 
calculate situations [36].  
This specification-based identification approach does not 
scale because situations identification rules become too hard 
for a human in such a Big data context that includes plenty of 
sensors and very complex situations [14].Therefore, we have 
to investigate Machine Learning for crisis situations 
identification. We can benefit from initiatives like The 
Humanitarian Data Exchange that provides open crisis data 
related to previous disasters such as Typhoon Yolanda [37].

VI. RELATED RESEARCH PROJECTS 
Many research projects have investigated these issues and 
we can list the following ones.  
The H2020 TransCrisis project [38] - Enhancing the EU¶s 
transboundary crisis management capacity (2015 - 2018) has 
studied the crisis management capacities the EU and how 
political leaders have made use of these crisis management 
capacities. This framework deals with transboundary crisis 
management at the EU level. 
The H2020 DARWIN project [39] - Expecting the 
unexpected and know how to respond (2015 - 2018) has 
focused on improving responses to expected and unexpected 
crises affecting critical societal structures during natural 
disasters (e.g. flooding, earthquakes) and man-made disasters 
(e.g cyber-attacks). To achieve this, DARWIN developed 
European resilience management guidelines aimed at critical 
infrastructure managers, crisis and emergency response 
managers, service providers, first responders and policy 
makers. 
The H2020 5G-MoNArch project [40] - 5G Mobile 
Network Architecture for diverse services, use cases, and 
applications in 5G and beyond (2017-2020) proposes a 
flexible, adaptable, and programmable 5G architecture by 
combining virtualisation, slicing and orchestration of access 
with inter-slice control and cross-domain management, 
experiment-driven optimization, cloud-enabled protocol 
stack. 
The H2020 MATILDA [41] - A Holistic, Innovative 
Framework For The Design, Development And Orchestration 
Of 5g-Ready Applications And Network Services Over Sliced 
Programmable Infrastructure (2017-2020) designed and 
implemented a holistic 5G end-to-end services operational 
framework tackling the lifecycle of design, development and 
orchestration of 5G-ready applications and 5G network 
services over programmable infrastructure, following a 
unified programmability model and a set of control 
abstractions. 
The H2020 SLICENET [42] - End-to-End Cognitive 
Network Slicing and Slice Management Framework in 
Virtualised Multi-Domain, Multi-Tenant 5G Networks (2017-
2020) aimed at creating and demonstrating the tools and 
mechanisms to achieYe ³netZorks as a serYice´ Zhere logical 
network slices are created and allocated to flexibly and 
efficiently in a multi-operator environment. 
The H2020 5G ENSURE [43] ± 5G Enablers for Network 
and System Security and Resilience (2015 ± 2018) proposed 
the design of an overall security architecture including 
authentication, authorization and accounting, privacy, trust, 
security 
monitoring, 
and 
network 
management 
and 
virtualization isolation. 
The H2020 SELFNET [44] ± A Framework for Self-
Organized Network Management in Virtualized and Software 
Defined Networks (2015 ± 2018) designed an autonomic 
network management framework targeting the integration of 
SDN, NFV, Self-Optimizing Network, Cloud Computing, 
Artificial Intelligence and Quality-of-Experience, to address 
self-protection (to prevent distributed cyber-attacks), self-
healing (to deal with network failures) and self-optimization 
(to enhance the QoE and network performance), and virtual 
infrastructure management. 
The H2020 COHERENT [45] ± Coordinated control and 
spectrum management for 5G heterogeneous radio access 
networks (2015 ± 2018) defined a programmable unified 
management framework for heterogeneous 5G Radio Access 
Networks (flexible spectrum management, radio resources 
coordination and modelling, and RAN sharing). 
The H2020 5G NORMA [46] ± 5G Novel Radio 
Multiservice Adaptive Network Architecture (2015 ± 2018) 
developed an adaptive networking architecture with flexible 
and context-aware network functions deployment in a multi-
tenant scenario involving software defined network control, 
joint optimization of access and core network functions, and 
adaptive decomposition and allocation of network functions. 
The ANR GéNéPi project (2014-2017) proposed a 
Mediation Information System dedicated to support the 
collaborative management of crisis situation. Especially, it 
aimed at exploiting very large quantities of and flows of data 
generated from crisis sites. 
None of the previous works integrate social media crisis 
information and the crisis IT architecture deployment. The 
originality of our approach is thus twofold. First, we consider 
natural disaster crisis management as a big data issue and we 
would like to exploit social media especially in Thai language 
using machine learning techniques. Secondly, we advocate for 
a crisis IT management framework that integrates information 
coming from social media to dynamically adapt the network 
architecture and support the crisis management services. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
Crisis management is definitely a big data issue given the 
incredible diversity, heterogeneity and number of channels 
that can contribute to a crisis resolution. To allow more 
efficient and reliable coordination for decision making and 
strengthening emergency response, crisis cells have to govern 
the operational IT infrastructure resilience as well as align its 
information system for a better appreciation and awareness of 
the situation being managed. 
As it becomes impossible for a human to ³harYest´ and 
process the whole information, machine-learning techniques 
can help in identifying the right situations in which the right 
decision might be taken. Situation awareness theory provides 
the tools for expressing and deploying the right policies. 
Using the dynSMAUG system as a concrete example, we 
highlighted open questions in building an effective decision 
support system to help crisis cells identifying early warnings 
and situation-specific awareness figuring out the right 
actions/partnerships to coordinate. Our future work will tackle 
these open questions to propose a situation-based IT 
management  system during natural disaster crisis.
