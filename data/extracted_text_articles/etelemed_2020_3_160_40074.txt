Abstract—Impedance
Cardiography
(ICG)
is
a
non-
invasive method to estimate the cardiac output, which is very
helpful for the prognosis of cardiovascular disease and the
diagnosis of disease. By applying a stable high-frequency and
low-intensity current to the human, we can measure the
impedance variation of the human body, and, therefore, get the
ICG signal to judge the possible characteristic points and
estimate the cardiac output. The measurement of ICG in long-
term care is limited due to the cost involved and the need for
professional evaluation. For this reason, in this paper, we
develop an impedance signal measurement system suitable for
long-term care.
We use a
modified circuit system and
LabVIEW software to detect the impedance variation of the
human body and the characteristic points of ICG. At present,
our preliminary results have been able to detect possible points
B and C, for the detection of point X. We need to compare and
confirm these results using Electrocardiography (ECG). In the
future, we will use the feature points detected by this system to
estimate the cardiac output and develop it into a portable
instrument for long-term care.
Keywords-Impedance Cardiography (ICG); Cardiac Output
(CO); Stroke Volume (SV).

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, cardiovascular diseases have seriously
affected people's health and have led to an increase in
mortality [1]. Therefore, the prediction and management of
cardiovascular diseases become very important. In the past,
it has been proposed that cardiac output can be estimated by
thermal dilution [2], however, this is not an option for long-
term monitoring because it is an invasive method.
Impedance
Cardiography
(ICG)
is
a
non-invasive,
continuous, easy and accurate method to evaluate left
ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output [3], and it is
also suitable for long-term monitoring of cardiac activity. In
the past, other non-invasive evaluation methods have been
proposed to measure cardiac output, such as Doppler
ultrasound [4]. Although the measurement results are
accurate, Doppler ultrasound is not suitable for long-term
care because of the high cost and the need for professional
analysis.
The principle of ICG instrument is to apply a constant
low current (1mA-5mA) and high frequency (50kHz-
100kHz) signal to the outer electrode by means of four
electrodes placed, then Ohm's law is used to measure the
voltage signal of the external electrode to estimate the chest
impedance of human body [5]-[7]. The cardiac output can be
evaluated by the characteristic points and the method
proposed by Kubicek [3][8].
Cardiac output is the volume of blood entering the aorta
from the left ventricle every minute, and stroke volume is the
volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle in each
systole. Cardiac output is the product of cardiac stroke and
heart rate [9], as (1).
CO = SV ⅹ HR

Cardiac output is important information to evaluate
cardiac health, and ICG is a simple way to evaluate cardiac
output.
The typical waveforms of impedance variation (delta Z),
ICG and Electrocardiography (ECG) are shown in Figure 1
[10].

A typical ICG can distinguish the following characteristic
points [11]:

A
This point is related to atrial contraction.
B
Corresponding to the opening of the
aorta, this point occurs at the zero
crossing
point
before
((dZ/dt)max),
which is an important information to
judge the pre-ejection period (PEP) and
Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET).
C
((dZ/dt)max):
This
point
is
the
maximum
amplitude
of
this
signal,
which can reflect the maximum speed of
impedance change, which is related to
the maximum ejection speed of the
heart.
X
Corresponding to aortic closure, it is the
most negative point of ((dZ/dt)max)
signal, occurring after point C.
Y
Corresponding
to
pulmonary
artery
closure.
O
It is related to mitral valve opening and
volume change in diastolic period.
Z
This point is related to the third heart
sound after the O point.
The time relationship between the characteristic points of
ICG and ECG signal is as follows [11]:
TABLE II.
CHARACTERISTIC PERIOD
Characteristic

Description
Q-B
Q point in the ECG and B point in the
ICG (the opening of the aortic), which is
the pre-ejection period (PEP).
Q-C
Time interval between Q point in ECG
and ((dZ/dt)max)in ICG, which can be
used to calculate the heather index for
cardiac contract.
B-X
The time interval between the opening
of the aorta and aortic closure. This
segment is the Left Ventricular Ejection
Time (LVET), which is the ICG signal
feature.
After obtaining these characteristic points and time
interval relations, we can estimate SV by Kubicek's method
[3][8][12] and then evaluate the Systolic Interval and activity
of the heart.

MATERIAL AND METHOD
A.
System Description
ICG circuit system is mainly divided into three blocks (1)
transmitter (2) receiver (3) software Layer. Figure 2 is the
framework diagram of the ICG circuit system; Figure 3 is
the ECG framework and position of electrode corresponding
to the body.
(1) Transmitter
First of all, we use a 12V lead-acid battery as the DC
power supply of the oscillator which can produce stable
frequency, and then connect the Voltage Controlled Current
Source (VCCS) circuit to make the sinusoidal signal output
stable current [7]. In order to ensure safety, we design an
additional voltage limiting circuit as the protection circuit,
and then apply the stable current signal to the outer
electrode of the four electrodes.
(2) Receiver
Then, we receive the voltage signal of the human body
from the inner electrode, using ad633 as an instrument
amplifier, and use 60kHZ and 90khz band pass filter of 8
orders as filtering signal. Finally, we use NI USB-6210 to
do ADC and input the signal into the computer.

(3) Software Layer
We use LabVIEW as software layer and analysis, the
received signal is demodulated by mixer. Then we use 8
order's 40 Hz low pass filter to get the modulation signal
(delta Z). Then, we use the obtained modulation signal
(delta Z) do differential and multiplied by a negative sign to
obtain the ICG signal [13].

Subject data collection and experiment process
This research’s data was extracted from one subject; no
history of cardiovascular disease was in this subject.
Before the experiment, the electrodes should be placed
first as shown in Figure 3. Four electrode positions required
for ICG: Lead 1 is placed on the left upper neck. Lead 2 is
placed 3 cm below lead 1. Lead 3 is placed at the point
where the xiphoid is cut to the left of the chest. Lead 4 is
placed 3 cm below lead 3 [6]. The positions of the ECG
electrode (Lead 5-7) are as shown in Figure 3.
The experimental procedure is: first, let the subject rest
for 3 minutes to measure the baseline, and then do 30
seconds of rhythmic breathing to acquire ECG and ICG
signal.
III.
RESULT
Figures 4 and 5 show the signals when we measure only
the ICG of the subjects. Figures 6 and 7 show the signals
when we measured the ECG and ICG of the subjects at the
same time.
Figure 4. Impedance variation (delta Z)
Figure 5. Impedance Cardiography (ICG)
Figure 6. ECG signal (Simultaneous measurement with ICG)
Figure 7. ICG signal (Simultaneous measurement with ECG)
The change of human body impedance was shown in
Figure 4. The maximum impedance can be observed in each
cardiac cycle. From the three cardiac cycles in Figure 5, we
can observe the ICG that obtained by letting delta Z do
differential and multiplied by a negative sign.
Figure 6 is the ECG signal measured with ICG at the
same time. Figure 7 is the ICG signal measured with ECG at
the same time. We may determine the possible point B and
point C, and the interval between point C of ICG is similar
to the RR interval of ECG. But point x cannot be accurately
determined. We need to find out the possible x point by
comparing ICG with ECG.
IV.
DISCUSSION
By comparing the signal characteristics of Figure 4 and
Figure 5 with those of previous papers, we can detect
117

possible B and C points, but we cannot accurately determine
x points. Therefore, we hope to get possible x points by
comparing with ECG signals.
According to [5] [11], we can confirm point B of ICG
from point R of ECG. By comparing Figures 6 and 7, we can
see that point B (when the aorta is opened) does occur after
point R of ECG, and point C occurs at the highest point after
point B, so point B and point C may be correct. Then, we can
compare the x-point of ICG by the end of the T-wave of
ECG [11] [14]. From Figures 6 and 7, we may find that at
the end of the T-wave of ECG, the X point corresponding to
this time is almost the most negative value after zero
crossing, so this is the possible x point.
Although it is possible to detect the possible feature
points of ICG through the simultaneous measurement of
ECG and ICG, there are still several deficiencies in this
study. First of all, there is the problem of signal coupling in
the measurement. It can be seen from the ICG signal that the
influence of ECG signal-coupling may affect the judgment
of feature points. Second, the number of subjects is too
small, there is only one subject at present, it is necessary to
measure the data of multiple subjects for comparison, which
can increase the reliability of signal and feature point
detection
Finally, the problem of signal distortion will affect the
judgment of feature points; the circuit design can be
modified to increase the stability of the instrument.
V.
CONCLUSION
This study shows that the impedance variation and ICG
may be detected by the modified circuit, despite the fact that
the possible characteristic points of ICG can be detected at
present. However, there are still several deficiencies that
have not been resolved, so it is impossible to accurately
estimate cardiac output. In the future, we will solve these
deficiencies, so as to estimate the accurate cardiac output,
and then develop into portable instruments, which will help
long-term care for the tracking and diagnosis of diseases.
