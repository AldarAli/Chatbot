Abstract—Virtual Reality (VR) is widely used in different areas
of research in psychology. Its use seems irreplaceable since it
allows
the
simulation
of
many
previously
unreachable
interactions in laboratory
settings.
In our research,
we
designed an environment to facilitate meditational training.
We tried to prove that VR can support mindfulness through
immersion. We also hypothesized that mindfulness meditation
would show significantly higher results than relaxation on
mindfulness-related
constructs
such
as
decentration
and
curiosity. The same effect would also be visible on positive
mood or social skills questionnaires. A total of 80 participants
took part in the research. However, the results did not support
our hypotheses. Whether meditation or relaxation took place,
with or without VR, none of these conditions seemed to differ
significantly from one another. The psychometric issues related
to the research are discussed as well as the qualities of VR that
could have inhibited the effects of immersion, such as real
world
similarity,
level
of
abstractness
of
the
virtual
environment,
landscape,
and
virtual
enhancement
of
transcendence.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The potential of Virtual Reality (VR) in science has been
explored in various fields, e.g., in understanding clinical
aspects of fear and anxieties [3] by provoking certain desired
states in a safe laboratory environment. It is a widely used
tool in therapy – for example, in short-term pain distraction
[18], or in anxiety treatments, where VR is used as Virtual
Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) [34], as well as in Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) therapy [10] or in the
treatment of arachnophobia [5]. In the current research, we
would like to examine whether VR has the potential to be
successfully used to enhance a meditative experience. In this
article,
“mindfulness”,
“meditative
experience”
and
“meditation” will be used synonymously for ease of reading.
However, we are aware of the complexity of what meditation
actually is and that “mindfulness” represents only one type
of a meditation-related state.
II.
VR IN CONTEMPLATIVE STUDIES
VR can create a stressful environment that is not
accessible in real-world ethical studies, e.g., an immersive
VR environment can be used to imitate a train station hit by
several explosions [7]. By doing this, it can elicit fear,
anxiety or, in general, a difficult emotional state under stress.
In this way, the influence of meditation on emotions and
processing stress can be checked in ethically approved, albeit
stressful conditions. The aforementioned study confirmed a
less anxious response to stressful stimuli in a group of
meditators who underwent an 8-week-long meditation course
prior to the experiment. However, it does not prove the
utility of VR in enhancing an alternative state of mind.
VR has been checked as a tool supporting relaxation
while meditating. For example, VR can be used in
connection to neurofeedback to check the impact of
meditation on a group of chronic pain patients [15]. As the
patients became more relaxed, the view of a forest in VR
changed to a less foggy, clearer, sunny and green image.
This was not immersive VR though, as a stereoscopic VR
viewer was used. Later in this article, we will describe the
difference between relaxation and meditation in more depth,
and the relation to relaxation in meditation.
Another example of a VR-meditation connection is a
study
using
neurofeedback
(specifically,
electroencephalography, EEG) for focused attention and
body-scan [24]. The study proves, amongst other things, that
immersive VR, with or without neurofeedback, can give
significantly better results in questionnaires related to
meditation (self-reflection and relaxation) than the control
conditions, in which the participants could observe the same
view as the experimental group, albeit on a computer screen.
As the VR design is crucial to this kind of research, it seems
important to mention that the authors decided to keep the
environment as simple as possible (the leaves on the trees
were represented as triangles; the sky was left cloudless).
The study proved immersive VR to be of some use as a
meditation-enhancement tool even though the participants
had to sit still.
Why would VR be effective in enhancing meditation?
One of the most common types of meditation, mindfulness,
has been researched for almost 30 years and started with an
8-week
long
meditation
training
program
known
as
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program designed by
Jon
Kabat-Zinn
[22].
Mindfulness
meditation
was
conceptualized and later proved to work as an emotion
processing strategy, along with suppression and positive
reappraisal [6]. It has been commonly used as a relaxation
method as well as part of therapeutic treatments [13][14]; it
has also been shown to influence compassionate and
empathetic
thinking
[4],
stereotypical
thinking
[36],
prejudices [27][28] and conflict studies [1]. Since VR has
already been successfully shown to enhance meditative

experiences, we decided to replicate this result using a brief
meditation training session. We were interested in examining
whether such a complex state as mindfulness meditation [16]
can be influenced by a simple mindfulness training session
and enhanced by a basic immersive VR environment. We
wanted to explore in more depth the possibilities that VR
gives to facilitate meditation, as well as try to identify any
obstacles that modern technology meets when facing an
alternative state of mind. It was interesting for us to see
whether a brief training session gives any results as it did in
several previous studies (see: [27] and [28], as examples).
III.
RESEARCH HYPOTHESES
In our study, we decided to combine Virtual Reality with
mindfulness meditation and compare the effects of both
mindfulness and relaxation with or without VR. The goals
were: 1) to investigate the possibilities of using Virtual
Reality in meditative states (mindfulness meditation only)
with the hypothesis that VR would enhance relaxation and
detachment from the surrounding environment which may
facilitate the experience for the meditators. This would be
mirrored by higher scores on the subjective well-being
scales, as well as on the meditation-related scale, especially
in the experimental (mindfulness) group with VR; 2) to
compare the influence of a short meditation vs. relaxation
training session on subjective well-being and mindfulness-
related states (such as decentration and curiosity of one’s
emotions and thoughts) with our hypothesis being, the
experimental mindfulness groups would feel happier and
more open to their thoughts and emotions after the training
session than the relaxation groups; 3) to our knowledge,
there is yet no study relating mindful meditation and VR
with social processes, hence we decided to compare the
influence of short meditation or relaxation sessions in social
processing (such as empathic thinking, or seeing humanity as
one in general). Our hypothesis was that the experimental
mindfulness group would present more empathic thinking
and would identify with all humanity more than the
relaxation group.

METHOD
A)
VR Environment
The immersive VR environment used for the study was
prepared
by
the
authors
in
Unity
2018.3.8f1.
The
environment was created to imitate the natural surroundings
as reliably as possible using the accessible assets. Figures 1
and 2 present the final form of the environment prepared for
the study. The concept of the ‘meditation island’ was to
facilitate achievement of meditative states, hence it was
supposed to be calming, imitating a mountain lake view,
enhancing
the
self-reflective
nature
of
meditation.
Participants could also hear sounds of a forest (including
various bird species singing) regardless of their experimental
group: those who did not meditate in VR had headphones
with the background music on. The hardware that was used
in
the
study
was
VR
HTC
Vive
Pro
with
Stereo
AudioTechnica mx 20 headphones, connected to an Intel
Xeon based PC with the Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card.

B)
Experimental conditions
The experiment was conducted using the between-
subjects design. Participants were divided into four groups
(2x2 design) with or without VR (VR, No VR); with
mindfulness meditation instructions or simple relaxation
instructions (meditation vs. relaxation group). The design is
illustrated in Table I. Participants were randomly assigned to
a certain group at the beginning of each study. Subsequently,
they sat on a chair in an empty room, facing the same
direction both in real and in VR, with VR hardware on, or
with
headphones
only.
Before
starting
the
software,
participants in
all
groups listened
to
the instructions
delivered
by
professional
mindfulness
trainers.
Under
mindfulness conditions, participants were asked to observe
their thoughts and emotions in a non-judgmental manner and
let them go, as they would not be related to them, observing
their
bodies
and
breath.
Under
relaxation
conditions,
participants were taught to tense and relax certain body
muscle groups step by step. After these instructions,
participants were asked to continue these tasks during a VR
experience or listening to the sounds of forest, which took
exactly 15 minutes. Participants could freely observe the
environment if they wished to. Afterwards, they were asked
to fill in the questionnaires (listed below) and had time to ask
questions. Figure 3 briefly outlines the study design.

Measures
In order to check our hypotheses, we decided to use
several questionnaires translated into Polish: the Toronto
Mindfulness Scale to measure the state of mindfulness
meditation, the Positive Orientation Scale, the Depression
Anxiety Stress Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale to
check the influence of meditation on mood, and the
Interpersonal Reactivity Index as well as the Identification
With All Humanity scale to check the social processes.
Toronto
Mindfulness
Scale
(TMS;
meditation-VR
group, mean = 3.60, SD = 0.48, relaxation-VR group, mean
= 3.60, SD = 0.60, meditation-no VR group, mean = 3.59,
SD = 0.50 and relaxation-no VR group, mean = 3.36, SD =
0.48). Since we did not use any objective measure of
mindfulness as a state, we decided to use the Polish
translation of the commonly used Toronto Mindfulness
Scale prepared by one of the authors. The scale has been
developed as a questionnaire measuring mindfulness as a
state and consists of 13 questions with two subscales:
Decentering and Curiosity [25]. The original scale had
satisfactory results: high internal consistency as well as
positive correlations with scales measuring life satisfaction
and
happiness,
and
negative
correlations
with
scales
measuring ruminations and anxieties. We used a Polish
translation of the test with 13 questions grouped into two
subscales with responses formed in a Likert scale from 1 („I
definitely disagree with this statement”) to 5 („I definitely
agree with this statement”), as in the original version. We
decided to use the TMS as we needed a measure to
understand the potential differences between relaxation and
mindfulness. The TMS is a commonly used questionnaire
[35] that has been used in a pilot study and translated into
Polish by one of the authors in collaboration with the
Department for Social Sciences at the Pontifical University
of John Paul II, , and trialed on a sample of 300 participants
via an online research questionnaire using confirmatory
factor analysis consisting of two subscales. In the current
research,
the
internal
reliability
was
checked
using
Cronbach’s Alpha (α = 0.75) which is a satisfactory level. 
Positive Orientation Scale (POS; meditation-VR group,
mean = 3.59, SD = 0.64, relaxation-VR group, mean = 3.63,
SD = 0.54, meditation-no VR group, mean = 3.59, SD =
0.81, and relaxation-no VR group, mean = 3.59, SD = 0.66).
The scale has been translated into Polish and proved to have
significant internal validity and was well correlated with
similar measures within the Polish population [29]. We used
it to compare the results of the effects of meditation and
relaxation on the TMS with the general tendency to stay
positive-oriented. POS in a shorter 8-item version is a
construct
measuring
self-esteem,
life
satisfaction
and
optimism within one factor. Our hypothesis was that those
who score higher on the TMS would have a general
tendency to see the world in a more positive manner as
mindfulness
meditation
is
shown
to
support
positive
reappraisal
[1]
[12].
The
current
research
showed
satisfactory internal reliability of the scale (Cronbach’s α = 
0.91).
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS; meditation-VR
group, mean = 1.62, SD = 0.34, relaxation-VR group, mean
= 1.81, SD = 0.35, meditation-no VR group, mean = 1.83,
SD = 0.56, and relaxation-no VR group, mean = 1.70, SD =
0.31). The scale was prepared to detect the level of
depression as a state and anxiety in a patient [32]. Polish
translation has been commonly used for example to assess
the emotional states of women with pregnancy pathologies
[26]. Our hypothesis is that participants scoring higher in
mindfulness meditation as a state should have a general
tendency towards lower results in the DASS. The scale
consists of 21 questions with three subscales: anxiety,
depression
and
stress;
answers
indicating
how
often
participants feel in a certain way from „never” to „almost
always”; it has been shown to have a high level of internal
reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) 
Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; meditation-VR
group, mean = 4.28, SD = 1.60, relaxation-VR group, mean
= 4.03, SD = 1.28, meditation-no VR group, mean = 3.69,
SD = 1.31, and relaxation-no VR group, mean = 4.13, SD =
1.07).The scale has been developed to measure self-
evaluation of general life satisfaction and to continue the
wide research on subjective well-being [33], translated to
Polish in 2015 by Jankowski [20]. It is a 5-item scale using
a 7-point response, from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
In our research, the hypothesis was that the scale should
correlate positively with TMS. The level of internal
reliability is high (Cronbach’s α = 0.9). 
Identity With All Humanity Scale (IWAH; meditation-
VR group, mean = 3.10, SD = 0.69, relaxation-VR group,
mean = 2.99, SD = 0.82, meditation-no VR group, mean =
3.23, SD = 0.83, and relaxation-no VR group, mean = 3.03,
SD = 0.79). This scale was developed by McFarland, Webb,
and Brown [40] to measure humanitarian concerns. It
consists
of
9-items
asking
participants
about
their
identification with all humanity as a whole (e.g. „How close
do you feel to people all over the world?”). The measure is
linked to people’s interest in international humanitarian
actions. It was translated into Polish for the purpose of the
study, with satisfactory internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 
.87). As the case study presents, long-term meditation
practices can lead to body boundary dissolution and
298

subsequently loss of the egocentric perspective [2], hence
we assumed even a short meditation may lead to the loss of
social identity while enforcing the sense of identity with all
humanity. The hypothesis is that meditators should have
higher results in the IWAH scale than the relaxation group.
Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; meditation-VR
group, mean = 3.23, SD = 0.40, relaxation-VR group, mean
= 3.25, SD = 0.55, meditation-no VR group, mean = 3.32,
SD = 0.42, and relaxation-no VR group, mean = 3.40, SD =
0.40). The commonly used questionnaire of 28 items
(responses on a scale from 1 „[this sentence] does not
describe me at all” to 5 „[this sentence] describes me very
well”)
was
developed
to
measure
empathy
on
four
subscales: FS – Fantasy Scale; EC – Empathic Concern; PT
– Perspective Taking; PD – Personal Distress (Davies,
1980) [8][9]. A Polish translation has been used for the
research on empathy with satisfactory results of internal
reliability [21]. We decided to use the same test as it is a
well-studied tool that takes into consideration emotional
(PD and EC) and cognitive aspects of empathy (FS, PT).
The mutual influence of empathy and mindful meditation is
also widely studied in neuroscience [23] proving that there
are some significant outcomes of intense contemplative
training of compassion or empathy on subjective rating of
the negative effects while watching a number of highly
stressful movies. Hence, the hypothesis is that those who
meditated would score higher on IRI, especially in PD and
EC as these two are mostly related to meditation training,
than the participants who relaxed their muscles only. The
measure had a satisfactory level of internal reliability
(Cronbach’s α = 0.82, with the 21st item excluded as it had 
a negative correlation with the total scale; with 95%
confidence intervals).

An even number of 80 participants enrolled in the
study. The average age was 36.2, ranging from 25 to 61,
with 33 males and 47 females. Participants were employees
of the National Information Processing Institute and all of
them
were
Polish.
The
study
was
advertised
as
an
opportunity to explore virtual technology in the workplace.
Participants were questioned about their experience of VR
as well as their experience of meditation, including different
kinds of meditation, and their age. 27 of them had no
experience of any kind of meditation. The frequency of
those who meditated also differed: 6 of them meditated
daily while 15 meditated at least once a week with one
person meditating 120 minutes daily. The rest of them rarely
meditated or meditated only a few times a month. The VR
experience divided the participants into four subgroups:
those with no experience (55%), those who had used VR
once (25%), those who had used it but rarely (16.25%) and
those who used it often (3.75%).
In order to validate adequate randomization of our
participants, we used Chi Square tests. We found that there
were no significant interactions for either mindfulness vs.
relaxation conditions, or VR vs. no VR conditions. The
details can be found in Table II and Table III.

RESULTS
Our study was conducted to examine the three main
hypotheses. The first one was that VR would enhance the
effects
of
both
(mindfulness
and
relaxation)
training
sessions, and this would be expressed through the feelings of
general happiness and openness to personal experiences
under
VR
vs.
no
VR
conditions,
especially
under
mindfulness conditions. Using two-way ANOVA analysis,
we found no proof for the hypothesis. There was no
significant effect of VR conditions on the dependent
variables: for the TMS (F(1,76) = 1.09, p = 0.30), the POS

0.59) and the SWLS (F(1,76) = 0.68, p = 0.41). The
interaction effect of independent variables is not significantly

DISCUSSION
A)
Main hypotheses
The goal of the study was to check the potential
influence and utility of Virtual Reality in contemplative
training and to compare the effects of mindfulness training
and relaxation training.
We hypothesized that VR conditions would enforce the
results of mindfulness through immersion since Virtual
Reality has been shown to support immersion in the digital
world. This might help to create a safe but reliable
experimental environment [7]. We found no proof for the
hypothesis, undermining the potential of VR to achieve
alternative states of mind. The results of ANOVA under VR
conditions were not significant either as a main effect or as
an interaction effect between both mindfulness and VR
conditions. MANOVA analyses revealed a similar lack of
significant
results
taking
into
consideration
several
dependent variables: TMS, POS, SWLS and DASS.
It was hypothesized that both meditation training
sessions (with or without VR) would enhance the subjective
well-being of participants more than the relaxation training.
We
assumed
that
mindfulness
training
would
boost
subjective well-being as well as decentration and curiosity
of one’s emotions more than relaxation. This would be
observable via higher scores on the Mindfulness Toronto
Scale (measuring curiosity and decentering), the Positive
Orientation Scale (measuring general positive attitude to
life), the Satisfaction With Life Scale and lower the results
of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. The assumption is
based on the research on mindfulness training: decentering
is known to be a central characteristic of mindfulness but
not of relaxation [11]. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is
related to positive reappraisal and stress-coping processes
along
with
other
mindfulness-typical
processes,
e.g.,
attentional
broadening
[13].
However,
there
were
no
conclusive
results
to
indicate
that
the
mindfulness
meditation group scored significantly higher than the
relaxation group: the two-way ANOVA analysis revealed no
significant
main
effects
of
mindfulness
training
vs.
relaxation training. Also, MANOVA analyses, taking into
consideration more than one dependent variable, showed no
more
statistically
significant
effects
under
mindfulness/relaxation conditions.
We also hypothesized that this mindfulness-related
increase in general happiness and curiosity along with
decentration would have an impact on social skills, such as
300

empathy or group identity. This would be expressed in
higher results of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index as well
as of the Identity With All Humanity scale, as mindfulness
has been proved to enhance social processing on various
levels, e.g.. implicit bias [28]. However, we failed to prove
this hypothesis. Our results showed no influence of either
mindfulness meditation conditions, or of the interaction of
both conditions on the two dependent variables related to
social processing. In all of our calculations, we rejected a
possible interference of demographic data proving well-
randomized groups.
B)
Possible explanations – mindfulness training
Since the results of experimental manipulation were not
significant on any of the dependent variables, we may think
of methodological errors that appeared in the study and
should be taken into consideration in following studies. One
of the possible objections against the study design was the
briefness of the mindfulness training. Some researchers in
contemplative studies argue that mindfulness is a complex
and yet mostly unknown state [16]. We could conclude that
a short intervention may not be sufficient to tackle such a
complex alternative state of mind. On the other hand, one
can argue that even shorter training sessions have already
been successfully applied to meditation training with some
significant outcomes [27], especially since TMS as a tool
has been designed in such a way that it would capture the
instant mental processes related to mindfulness (e.g., “I was
curious to see what my mind was up to from moment to
moment”). Moreover, the length of the training was exactly
the same as the length of the training used in the TMS
validation [25].
C)
Possible explanations - self-reported measures
There is a growing body of evidence which suggests
behavioral measurements give a better evaluation of the
effects of mindfulness training than self-reported measures
[16][17]. This strong objection is based on several issues,
e.g., not having a clear definition of what mindfulness really
is; self-reported measures not being able to tackle the
profound correlations of mindfulness as well as not being
able to capture the exact meaning of certain understandings
of Buddhist teachings. However, in our research we have
not only failed to prove TMS to be influenced by the
experimental conditions but also other dependent variables
seemed to be inexplicable by the experiment itself. In order
to ensure that the lack of main effects or interactions is not
related to gender, experience with VR or experience with
meditation, we ran Chi-Square analysis that proved the
factors were equally distributed over the groups. We
decided to compare the dependent variables using Pearson’s
correlations in order to explore the lack of significant
results. Surprisingly, there was a significant positive relation
of TMS to the positive mood scale (POS) and the depression
and anxiety-related scale (DASS). There was also a
significant, positive correlation with the IRI but not with the
IWAH scale, even though there was a significant, positive
correlation between the last two variables. It is important to
note, however, that there was only one average significant
correlation (POS and SWLS; measures related to positive
mood and life-satisfaction), with the rest of the correlations
being weak or insignificant. These results may support our
conclusion that maybe the self-related measures are not
strong enough to efficiently measure the effects of such a
complex process as mindfulness.
D)
Possible explanations – VR design
An interesting aspect of the measurement that has not
been reported is the spontaneous reaction of participants
when exploring the VR meditation island. While conducting
the study, we observed that participants paid particular
attention to those details of VR that did not exactly match
reality. Looking at the general research where VR is
proposed to be a meditation-friendly environment, some of
the virtual worlds had some similar features, e.g., a lake,
trees, forest sounds (e.g., [31]) and they seemed to imitate a
natural background. However, there were exceptions, e.g.,
[24], where the same objects (a tree, a lake, a piece of land,
sunny weather) were constructed in the simplest way
possible, instead of trying to imitate nature. We hypothesize
that in such a way, participants acknowledge the differences
between VR and the real world, yet they do not focus on the
detailed differences between these two worlds, since they
are trivial. Hence, for the next study, we suggest an
environment that would symbolically resemble the natural
environment rather than try to imitate it. We suggest this
way
may
facilitate
immersion
through
familiarizing
participants to an imperfect world and letting them focus on
the purpose of the study, rather than encouraging them to
seek the hidden imperfections of a virtual world. On the
other hand, we conceptualize that maybe even a predictable
but very abstract environment could cause the same
immersion without absorption by the imperfections of the
world. In such a way, the virtual world would be obviously
unrelated to the natural landscapes, but would still remain
predictable, hence it could be a secure place to meditate in.
Analyzing
the
effects
of
mindfulness,
self-
transcendence is an often-omitted construct. Following the
potential
importance
of
transcendence
in
mindful
meditation, it is crucial for future research using VR to take
it into consideration. The authors of the Mindfulness-To-
Meaning Theory [12] argue that self-transcendence is a
natural effect of mindfulness meditation as it brings
pleasurable emotions such as gratitude or compassion. It
also lifts meditators to the next steps of meditation, the
feeling of oneness, selflessness, and finally to the non-dual
sense of subject-object relations. We hypothesize that
maybe certain landscapes can facilitate the feeling of self-
transcendence through a wide clear view, and hence the role
of VR in self-transcendence should be carefully taken into
consideration in future studies.

Finally, it should also be mentioned that maybe VR is
not an effective or sufficient tool to enhance mindfulness
experiences. We hypothesize that it could be a beneficial
tool in promoting relaxation (i.e., through immersion) but
not sufficient to enhance more complex mental states related
to mindfulness such as decentration or non-judgmental
observation of one’s thoughts and emotions. Even the
feeling of transcendence can be blurred by the virtual
experience bringing a state of excitement or curiosity of the
outside world rather than helping to understand the internal
states leading to alternative states of awareness.
E)
Generalization and study limitations
The study is not free from some limitations typical to
the field of mindfulness, e.g., the effectiveness of a brief
mindfulness training session remains questionable. On the
other hand, we managed to develop a study of interest to VR
enthusiasts and not only meditation enthusiasts – which is a
common sampling problem since meditation may seem
attractive to a very distinct group of people. Yet, another
challenge stems from the fact that all the participants were
Polish and the cultural upbringing might have influenced the
results. Taking into consideration that mindfulness is
relatively new in Poland (Polish Mindfulness Society was
inspired by Jon-Kabat Zinn and developed in 2008; [19]), it
is certainly important to compare the results controlling for
cultural influences. Last but not least, individual differences
could have affected the results of the study. We suggest
adding
some
questionnaires
related
to
openness
to
experience and neuroticism to the study in the future. Due to
limited external validity as well as to a specific sample
quality, we cannot generalize the results for a wider
population.
VII.
CONCLUSIONS
To sum up, our study failed to prove the main
hypothesis - that even short mindfulness meditation can
enhance subjective well-being along with decentration and
curiosity to one’s internal states, and in effect, it can also
influence social skills such as empathy. Another hypothesis,
that Virtual Reality would boost the effect of mindfulness,
also failed. We found a few possible methodological
explanations, i.e., that the mindfulness/relaxation training
period could have been too short and brief. However, as
some previous studies proved, even a short mindfulness
intervention can be effective in the aforementioned states.
We hypothesized that the virtual environment should be
distinctively
different
from
the
real
environment
so
participants can focus on their tasks, instead of directing
attention
to
the
imperfections
of
the
virtual
world.
Following the comments of contemplative science, we also
discussed the drawbacks of self-reported measures in
studying such a profound state as mindfulness. Certainly,
before we finally establish the role of mindfulness in human
life, and the effect of Virtual Reality on it, some further
evidence needs to be collected.
