Distributed GIS Approach for Flood Risk Assessment
Abstract – Web-based Geographic Information Systems
(WbGIS) provides key decision support capabilities for the
disaster
and
emergency
management
community.
Perspective
visualization
and
simultaneous
access
to
emergency management data are important capabilities
that WebGIS can provide in support of informed decision-
making process. By using a case study on a section of the
Don Valley in Toronto, Canada, this paper will present a
WebGIS based interdisciplinary approach for flood risk
assessment and will demonstrate the utility of WebGIS in
simulating different what-if scenarios under different
water surface elevations. A visual model of the extent and
the impact was published in the web using GeoServNet
(GSN),
a
proprietary
WebGIS
package.
The
article
highlights the capabilities of WebGIS and addresses some
of the key issues that prevent a proper emergency
response. Issues like time of geospatial data acquisition,
maintenance, processing and update can be a challenge
during emergencies.
This article is of importance to
decision makers in public safety and national security
domains, as well as to military personnel working at the
operational level.

INTRODUCTION
Numerous fields including environmental planning and
management, agriculture, hydraulics engineering, and
earth science contribute to flood simulation research and
prediction studies. This supports the process of reaching
to quantitative understanding and accurate simulation of
flooding scenarios based on GIS. The availability of
accurate data and efficient modeling tools are bounding
factors
for
effective
flood
risk
assessment
[1,2].
Modeling environmental and physical processes for the
purpose of disaster and emergency management is a
complex process because real-world phenomenon are
typically 3D, time dependent and complex [3]. These
factors make it difficult to obtain a complete qualitative
and quantitative understanding of these processes. Is not
a challenge
to represent 3D features on a desktop
system and publish the output on a webservice [2].
Spatial data collection is further developed by new
technologies, such as Light Detection and Ranging
(LIDAR), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and high-
resolution satellite imagery by GeoEye and Quickbird
has further enhanced 3D spatial information processing,
and
contributes
to
making
geospatial
information
acquisition and processing much faster and cheaper [4,
5].
All
these
developments
in
computing
power,
software, internet bandwidth, and data acquisition have
enhanced the power of 3D WebGIS and its ability to
show change and communicate complex geospatial
phenomena. The added dimensionality of 3D WebGIS
allows geospatial modelers to move themselves from
primitive representation of fence diagrams, isometric
surfaces, multiple surfaces, stereo, and block diagrams
[6]. The continuous improvements in hardware and
software technology will ensure that Web-based 3D GIS
become easier to implement, with a wide range of
applications.
This study aims at presenting an interdisciplinary
approach
for
publishing
and
visualizing
flood
information using GSN and examining the utility and
efficiency of 3D WebGIS decision-support capabilities
in support of disaster and emergency management
operations. What-if simulated scenarios are used in
delineating different water surface elevations for the
assessment of possible impact on critical infrastructure
and land use classes.
An
integrated
WebGIS
approach
for
flood
risk
assessment is introduced in the first and the second
section of this paper. The third section will introduces
an overview of the fundamentals of disaster risk
management. A case study will be presented in the
fourth section to show the procedures to be used for
integrating different data sources and modeling tools to
provide hydraulics simulation driven visual models. The
fifth section will present the results and discusses the
advantages and challenges for using distributed GIS in
flood risk assessment. The last section will present
findings and conclusions of this work.

GEOSPTATIAL INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY
The distribution of geospatial information over a
network of connected computing nodes has facilitated
effective
disaster
management
operations,
through
timely access to data and through the ability to
effectively interpret and visualize disaster management
scenarios. Estimating disaster damage and predicting its
impact are among the contributions of the progressive
development
in
Geospatial
Information
and
Communications Technology (GeoICT). WebGIS as a
GeoICT element is a centrally managed and distributed
computing architecture. Distributed computing is a
generic term that includes other terms like Internet,
Intranet, the web, network-centric, and more. The
growing trend is to distribute computing services across
a physical infrastructure of networked data storage

devices and computer processors. This environment
includes both a two and three tier model where the
physical locations of the data storage and application
processing are not on the same machine.

DISASTER MANAGEMENT
Many researchers including [18, 23, 24] have struggled
to define disaster. Although disasters have the common
result of leaving behind devastation and loss, there is no
precise definition for the term "disaster". The bottom
line in disaster management is that loss of life and
property should be eliminated or minimized, basic
needs should be ensured, and business continuity should
be
secured.
The
basic
requirements
for
disaster
management
can
be
achieved
only
through
interdisciplinary efforts and there are no research
methods that are unique to this field [14]. According to
[21, 22] modern disasters are complex and diverse
phenomena with a greater potential for adverse impact.
For
many years
the effects,
impacts,
and
issues
pertaining to protection from disasters have been the
focus of many researchers including [15- 20]
Flood disasters impact the economy, natural resources,
lives,
property
and
physical
infrastructure.
The
magnitude of the impact depends on the emergency
measures
and
the
steps
taken
by
the
concerned
authorities during the preparedness and the response
phases. Providing accurate and quick information over
the internet could help reduce the loss. A standardized
community-based
risk
assessment
protocol
was
developed by Emergency Management Australia [24].
This framework is based on six major elements as
shown in Figure 1 and discussed below:
1- Risk Context: The first phase is related to the
establishment of risk context. Issues related to the
problem at hand and the approaches of solving it are
discussed in this phase.
2- Hazard Vulnerability: The second phase involves
identifying risks in terms of hazard and vulnerability.
The scope and nature of a hazard must be identified, as
well as the setting of the community at risk.
3-Risk Analysis: The third phase in this process is risk
analysis. In this phase, tools of problem analysis, for
instance modeling software, are used to analyze risks
associated with the problem identified in the risk
context phase.
4-Risk Evaluation: The fourth phase is risk evaluation,
which involves prioritizing the risk and comparing it
against risk evaluation criteria. Risk thresholds are also
established in this phase.
5-Communication: The last phase in this process deals
with treating risks according to the result of the
evaluation. Results obtained from the risk evaluation
phase
will
be
communicated
to
the
concerned
stakeholders to allow them to implement disaster
management measures.

assessment process (after EMA, 2002)

WEBGIS FOR DISASTER AND EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT
Disasters are dynamic processes [8] and are spatially
oriented [9]. According to [10] most current tools that
are used for disaster management focus on the temporal
component of the four phases of disaster management,
leaving an obvious gap in dealing with the spatial
element. Emphasis on the spatial dimension makes GIS
technologies ideal for simulating the complex spatial
relationships during extreme situations, while still being
able to integrate other modeling tools.
The importance of WebGIS stems from its accessibility
to many users. There are many authorities involved in
planning, decision-making, and communications during
disaster management operations. Desktop GIS does not
provide instant and effective multi-user platforms for
the
same
project,
which
require
distributed
GIS
capability. .WebGIS provide ease of use in terms of the
technical background required from user perspective..
Many
decision-makers
with
limited
or
no
GIS
background
can
access
geospatial
information
simultaneously. Decision-makers are generally divided
into two general groups: response teams working in the
field
and
decision-makers
working
in
emergency
operation centers (EOC). The EOC group works in
different subgroups; communications, planning, and
prediction, various sources of information can be
gathered and used for disaster response and WebGIS is
mostly used by the planning group as well as by field
personnel and relief workers who need to access
information about the current situation.

interoperability
can
be
used
for
emergency
management. In particular, issues related to data and
systems heterogeneity.
The Don River is a unique river system, as it flows
through the core of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
The origin of the Don River is located at the Oak
Ridges Moraine where the headwaters are fed by
numerous
aquifers.
The
river
then
flows
for
38
kilometers to Lake Ontario and provides drainage for
360 square kilometer of land [11]. The section used for
this study is part of the huge watershed in the province
of Ontario. This section is located within the extent of
North York municipal boundaries. The location of the
study area is shown in figure 2.
Figure 2. Map of Greater Toronto Area showing the study area.
Topographic digital maps in the form of shapefiles and
a 10 meter spacing Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
were collected. Topographic sheets of the area were
used as reference for conducting the study. Hypothetical
flow data were simulated using Canadian Hydrographic
Service (CHS) data as a reference. The land use classes
of the study area were used in flood analysis especially
to know the extent of flood damage with respect to
different classes in study area. The detailed land use
map of the study area is show in figure 3.

METHODOLOGY
ArcView GIS, Hydrologic Engineering Centre-River
Analysis System (HEC-RAS) produced by the US
Corps of Engineers used in the present study. HEC-RAS
is a one dimensional, steady state modeling software for
hydraulics
intended
for
calculating
water
surface
profiles at cross-sections along a stream, for both steady
and unsteady flow. HEC-GeoRAS is an ArcView GIS
extension specifically designed to process geospatial
data for use with HEC-RAS[5]. GeoServNet (GSN) is a
distributed web-based 3D GIS developed by GeoICT
Lab from York University. GSN is of three main
modules: GSN Builder, GSN Administrator, and GSN
Publisher. The Builder is used to build and index the
raw data prior to its visualization. The Administrator is
used to register the layers built under builder and to
complete the server and security setting before their
publishing.
The
Publisher
is
used
for
setting
visualization parameters, layer display and rendering
functions in addition to the 3D perspective visualization
capability. The system architecture of GSN makes it an
ideal WebGIS Java technology, which provides reliable,
fast,
secure,
and
cutting-edge
interoperable
GIS
capabilities. The system architecture of GSN is shown
in figure 4[12].

The preparation of an accurate database is imperative
for successful WebGIS-based disaster and emergency
management
decision-making.
This
helps
with
providing accurate and timely flood information. In this
phase, different data layers of the Don Valley in the
form of shapefiles, grids or Digital Elevation Model
(DEM) were inputted into the GIS database. The DEM
was processed to produce a Triangulated Irregular
Network (TIN) and a complete dataset was visualized
using a standard web browser.
The analysis that was performed to simulate the Don
Valley
Watershed
involved
two
major
processing
stages, preprocessing and postprocessing. Preprocessing
is the first stage in the delineation of flooding scenarios.
It involves a number of tools that are used for the
creation of files used in developing the geometry of the
Don Valley model. Five themes were created in this

185

4
step; the stream centerline, banks, flow path, cross-
sectional cutline, and land use themes. The stream
centerline theme is used to establish the river reach
network. It was necessary to create upstream endpoints
before creating the reach in the downstream. River
reach was labeled as an identifier and a reach name was
assigned. Then it was possible to write the River
Analysis System (RAS) GIS import file. The RAS GIS
import file was created, and a complete file with a
header, stream network, and cross section information
was
generated.
After
completing
the
process
of
developing stream network, five direct major steps were
completed for conducting hydraulic simulation. The
first step involved creating a new project for river
simulation; the second step involved utilizing the GIS
data. The GIS imported information is in the form of
detailed geometry data that displays geometry derived.
The third step was modeling the flow data; this was
achieved in two different stages, the first was by
entering flow profiles for the cross sections generated
for the section of the study area, hypothetical flow rates
were used in this research in order to support the
concept of the approach, the second was entering water
surface profiles.
Postprocessing is the final phase in conceptualizing the
Don Valley watershed flood model. It is performed in
three separate steps. The first step is the generation of a
bounding polygon and cross section alignments. These
are read directly from the GIS export file. Then, a water
surface theme was created with the extent defined by the
bounding polygon. The water surface elevations at each
cross section were applied along the cross section
alignments and the cross sections were treated as break-
lines in the elevations, creating the TIN. The final step
is to mesh the water surface TIN with the terrain TIN to
produce the floodplain. Different flooding scenarios
were predicted using different water surface profiles in
the postprocessing step. Different water surface profiles
were created from different water surface elevations
using water flow rate parameters. Thus, it was possible
to identify the affected settlements, affected population,
and
affected
infrastructure,
which
is
of
special
importance in emergency management. Immediately
after a flood, the responsible authorities or organizations
need the information about the affected area, affected
people,
affected
infrastructure
i.e.
roads
and
rail
networks,
for
evacuating or
transportation of the
required relief material.

When the flood scenarios under different flood water
surface elevation levels were predicted and damages
assessed, the results were published and visualized in
3D web environment using the GSN.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As discussed in the first section, WebGIS has become
increasingly popular in disaster management. However,
the integration of GIS data with remotely sensed
information has posed a challenge in many occasions
[13]. Determination of which type of data required for
GIS modeling is a crucial issue. In this case, the first
question considered was what is the data required for
building this model? Is it a simple vector data for
drawing maps or a complete set of data for this type of
analysis? Is it specific data for specific software or data
to be digitized directly?
At the preprocessing stage, RAS themes were generated.
The attribution of these shapefiles according to "from -
to" vector topology parameters were very important in
keeping the flow direction and the DEM elevation
details prior to the step of extracting the details of the
model.
The
information gathered
from the DEM
integration with the digitized cross section allowed for
the represention of the channel geometry. This was
achieved
for
twelve
different
cross
sections
and
provided the 3D stream channel parameters. HEC-RAS
is used to represent the stream channel in 3D. Figure 6
is showing the geometric data of the Don Valley
Watershed. These geometric data can be also edited in
HEC-RAS.

Figure 7 summarizes the parameter used and a cross
section output at a station of Don River, which contain
i.e. elevation, slope, steady flow data, velocity, and
channel depth. Different steady flow data at different
stations of Don River are shown in respect of different
profiles. These steady flow data can be edited and
updated in HEC-RAS.

At
the
Postprocessing
stage,
the
floodplain
was
delineated using the RAS GIS export file generated by
HEC-RAS. In this stage, Water Surface TIN was
created from the cross sectional cutline themes and the
bounding polygon theme for the respective water
surface profile names. Then from the Water Surface
TIN, the respective floodplain was delineated. As
shown in Figure 8, three different flooding situations
under different water surface profiles are shown. The
flood Scenario 1, 2 and 3 were calculated using water
surface profiles PF 1, PF 3 and PF 5 respectively.
Figure 8. Different Flood Scenario at different flood situations.
Figure 8 describes the different flooding scenarios under
different water surface profiles which contain different
parameter e.g. water surface elevation, water discharge,
and velocity. It shows the nearby infrastructure that is at
risk.
Figure9. Affected Roads under different flood situations
Once a flood hits an area, different organizations and
authorities are engaged in emergency response and
immediate measures are taken to manage the flood
efficiently. Important information such as which areas
are affected severely, affected population, affected
infrastructure, and affected land use classes affected and
detailed information about the affected area In this case
study. The roads and rail networks are of special
importance because it is used to evacuate people to
shelters or safer places and to transport relief materials
to relief centers in the shortest amount of time. Roads
and different land use classes affected by different flood
levels were calculated, which will provide the relevant
organizations to know the locations of roads and other
land use classes affected for emergency relief operation
and efficient flood management. The 3D visualization
capability of GSN is useful for better visualizing the
flood-affected area in 3D web environment especially in
the
response
phase
emergency
management.
The
published flood data was visualized over the Web, as
shown in figure 9 and figure 10 respectively.

The difference between 2D shown in Figure 8 and 3D is very
obvious.
WebGIS provide important interoperability capabilities
for emergency management departments, in form of
data exchange between local, provincial and federal
decision making authorities, in particular for data
sharing specifications and standards. The City of
Toronto
demonstrated
the
need
for
using
GIS
Interoperability
in
handling
many
emergency
management situations including the modeling of West
Nile Virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) and in planning for two major mass festivals on
World Youth Day in 2001 and the rolling stones concert
in 2003. [17]
Ontario Emergency Management Doctrine [25] is the
two major resources used when dealing with a disaster
and or emergency. According to the Ontario Emergency
Management Act 2005, there are many stakeholders
responsible for deploying resources for emergency
management. The Toronto and Region Conservation
Authority (TRCA) is responsible for flood simulation,
floodplain mapping, and water surface measurement.
All hydraulics and hydrology data are under the custody
of
the
TRCA.
During
emergency
management
situations, the TRCA will provide flood models and
data through interoperable access to all decision-makers
involved. Semi-real time situational awareness models
can be generated and accessed on-demand based on
stakeholder needs.
The City of Toronto emergency services is responsible
for providing services in a variety of situations, ranging
from simple road maintenance closure to extreme
disastrous situations, e.g. civil infrastructure collapse.
In emergency situations the city police department
utilizes GIS interoperability in a very efficient way. This
includes accessing data provided by the emergency
mapping department of the city and the data provided
by the TRCA.
Toronto Emergency Medical Services (EMS) utilizes
GIS data and information for predicting areas at high
risk of experiencing an emergency and for planning how
they can dispatch their services to these areas. Another
important utility of GIS interoperability for EMS is that,
in emergency situations, it is not easy to prioritize your
response to calls from different parts of the city.
A key role for the provincial authorities represented by
Emergency Management Ontario (EMO) is to monitor
emergency situations and provide support on an as
needed bases. GIS interoperability could provide EMO
with
improved
situational
awareness
models
by
assembling data from all different departments and
make
the
data
available
for
basic
analysis
and
visualization.
GIS interoperability provides key benefits in support of
effective
disaster
and
emergency
management
operations. It also allows different decision-making
authorities to access information at the same time and
provide transparent open access to different data
sources. This benefit helps decision-makers to access
multiple servers, thereby obtaining data and services
that are not within organizational boundaries. Through
GIS interoperability, it is possible for the sharing of a
standardized data format that can be used for data
transfer and information sharing in a simple manner
GIS interoperability helps to provide a simple and
accessible means of integration. This is crucial since
emergency management operations stand to benefit
considerably from a process that allows for timely
gathering, modeling and analysis of information. GIS
interoperability, through its standardized protocols has
allowed GIS users to utilize a simple and standard
service.
Through
the
transparency
of
GIS
interoperability, emergency management stakeholders
can readily access external GIS data and systems.
Transparency here refers to the process of accessing and
sharing data between systems without complicated
protocols. Scalability is another advantage for GIS
interoperability, as it allows for data expansion. This
flexibility in scalability in systems and services is useful
in emergency management operations, which, due to
their dynamic, fast-paced nature require that previously
unexpected situations be accommodated.
The weaknesses with GIS interoperability are related to
policy and procedures. From an operational perspective,
there are particular issues related to the degree to which
data conversion hinders efficient data interoperability.
This may arise if, for example, a particular department
is using engineering data in a Computer Aided Design
(CAD) form and another department is using data in
GIS shapefiles formats. These two formats can be made
to be compatible by
converting CAD data into shapefiles format. However,
the time required for this process depends on data size
and system capabilities. Data maintenance and data
update is another issue that represents an obstacle for
implementing GIS interoperability. Where there is no

188
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 2 no 2&3, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
7
clear policy that identifies roles and responsibilities for
each node in an interoperable system, data update,
maintenance and management can be a challenge. On
the management side, issues related to implementing
GIS interoperability are related to corporate technology
procurement policies, which can contribute to delayed
implementation. Access rights to sensitive information,
such as infrastructure and emergency management,
represent another issue.

CONCLUSIONS
The discussed approach was dedicated to describing an
integrated approach for using GIS as a tool for spatial
analysis and visualization in flood simulation. This
integrated approach utilizes GIS as a core technology
for spatial analysis and visualization, and also integrates
with other tools such as HEC-RAS for hydraulics
modeling software. The dedicated approach is of special
importance because it provides an interdisciplinary
solution
for solving real world
problem.
Linking
WebGIS with environmental hydraulics and disaster
management results in an integrated, collective, and
interdisciplinary solution for addressing the reason for
disaster and emergency management, which is the
protection of life and property.
Despite the hypothetical nature of the scenario, it has
shown the benefits that disaster management decision-
makers can gain by adopting advanced and integrated
WebGIS solutions in their day-to-day operations. An
additional factor is the utility of 3D aspects to the
simulation
scenario.
The
contribution
of
the
3D
visualization perspective demonstrates that WebGIS is
efficient and useful for showing the impact of flooding,
with particular emphasis on spatial extent of flood
impact, and making it accessible for multiple users,
simultaneously.
This
can aid
decision-makers and
planners to have efficient counter disaster measures and
effective response plans.
