Abstract‚ÄîIt is an urgent task for the education institutes to use
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices effec-
tively. The education institutes not only introduce ICT devices,
but also it is necessary to evaluate the effect of the introduced
ICT devices. This paper proposes ICT Operational Model and
ICT Operational Pattern which express teacher‚Äôs operation in
a lecture. This paper describes the outline of ICT Operational
Model and ICT Operational Pattern. ICT Operational Model and
ICT Operational Pattern can be used as the valuable information
to evaluate the effect of the introduced ICT devices.

tern; ICT device
I. INTRODUCTION
Kagawa University developed the Kagawa University type
IT desk system (TDS) to support the effective enforcement
of the class using ICT devices installed in the classroom
in Kagawa University[1]. TDS can operate the ICT devices
which were installed in the classroom by using the ICT device
control system on the same interface. Figure 1 shows the TDS.
Various kinds of ICT devices are stored in the TDS. Figure
2 shows the interface of the ICT device control system. The
system is operated by iPad. All the ICT device operations are
conducted through ICT device control system from iPad, and
all operation logs are stored in the ICT device control system.
Table 1 shows ICT devices installed in the TDS. TDS has been
used in ten classrooms of Kagawa University. ICT devices play
an important role in institutes, and therefore the effect of the
introduced systems needs to be evaluated to keep or improve
the performance of the institutes within the limited budgets
and time. For example, many educational institutes including
universities have introduced ICT devices to support effective
on-site/remote teaching using multimedia contents, and some
of them were evaluated by using limited methods such as
questionnaire survey. TDSs which consist of various kinds of
ICT devices have been developed and installed in classrooms,
„ÄÄ

but their effect has not been evaluated so far, and also there
are no valid methods to evaluate the effect systematically.
In this paper, we created ICT Operational Model from the
operation logs of the TDS using Operational ProÔ¨Åle[1], [2]
and ICT Operational Pattern from ICT Operational Model.
The Operational ProÔ¨Åle that we used is the Extended
Operational ProÔ¨Åle[3]. Extended Operational ProÔ¨Åle gave the
sojourn times and the sojourn counts to the Operational ProÔ¨Åle
that is one of the modeling techniques of software and the in-
formation system. Sojourn times is using total times(minutes).
Sojourn counts is total nunber of using.

This paper describes the outline of ICT Operational Model
and ICT Operational Pattern. ICT Operational Model and
ICT Operational Pattern suggest not only the certain effect to
measure ICT-based teaching and plan for construction of ICT
devices but also construction of learning program and learning
environment using ICT devices. Besides, this result contributes
to the curriculum design which utilized the ICT devices in the
class and the development of the learning environment design.
II. ICT OPERATIONAL MODEL AND ICT OPERATIONAL
PATTERN
In this section, we describes ICT Operational Model and
ICT Operational Pattern. Operational proÔ¨Åle is the model
which added users ‚Äôoperate probability to Ô¨Ånite state machine
[1], [2]. For that reason, operational proÔ¨Åle express functions
that are used for a long time at once as ‚Äùthe function which is
not often used‚Äù. It is It was the problem so far. Fukutake [4]
proposed new Operational ProÔ¨Åles (Extended Operational Pro-
Ô¨Åles) which include users‚Äôsojourn times and sojourn counts in
addition to users‚Äôoperate probability. ICT Operational Model
is expressed based on Extended Operational ProÔ¨Åles proposed
by Fukutake. ICT device installed in TDS is controlled by

of the ICT device control system. Table 2 shows the kinds of
operation order. Figure 4 shows a example of ICT Operational
Model. It transits from Initial State to„ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äçwith
a probability of 100%. It transits from „ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äç
to „ÄåVisualizer„Äç with a probability of 30%. It transits from
„ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äç to „ÄåBlu-ray„Äç with a probability of 30%.
It transits from „ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äç to „ÄåOwn PC (HDMI) „Äç
with a probability of 40%. „ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äç was visited
seven times, and was stayed for the total of 50 minutes. ICT
Operational Pattern is created from ICT Operational Model.
ICT Operational Pattern indicates operational sequence, and
ICT Operational Model and Pattern are created by hand.
III. CREATION OF ICT OPERATIONAL MODEL AND ICT
OPERATIONAL PATTERN
In this section, we describes creation of ICT Operational
Model and ICT Operational Pattern. ICT Operational Model
was constructed from April 8, 2015 to April 30, 2015 in
school of nursing 303 classroom in the faculty of Medicine.

Figure 5 shows constructed ICT Operational Model. ICT
Operational Model was generated from the operational logs of
TDS. Twenty-eight classes used TDS in the school of nursing
303 classroom in the faculty of Medicine, and the time of all
classes were 2516 minutes. It transits from „ÄåInitial State„Äç to
State „ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äç with a probability of 82%, State
„ÄåOwn PC (HDMI)„Äç with a probability of 7% and, State
„ÄåVideo Conference„Äç with a probability of 7%, State „ÄåBlu-
ray„Äç with a probability of 4%. It remains at State „ÄåOwn PC
(RGB)„Äç Ô¨Åfty times for 1946 minutes. Own PC is used in the
class of the 89% together with„ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äçand„ÄåOwn
PC (HDMI)„Äçfrom „ÄåInitial State„Äç. Most of the classes did
not use other ICT devices and Ô¨Ånished the class using only
„ÄåOwn PC„Äç.
ICT Operational Patterns are created from ICT Operational
Model by hand. We extracted a data of ICT device operations
per lecture from ICT Operational Model. Table 3 shows the
created ICT Operational Patterns. Ten patterns were generated
from ICT Operational Model nursing 303 classroom. Using
Only „ÄåOwn PC (RGB)„Äç is the most frequent pattern. It
was used seventeen times. ICT Operational Model shows the
tendency and sequence of teachers‚Äô ICT device operation. It
indicates the certain effect to measure ICT based teaching.
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes ICT Operational Model and ICT Oper-
ational Pattern which express teacher‚Äôs operation in a lecture.
This paper describes the outline of ICT Operational Model and
ICT Operational Pattern. ICT Operational Model is the model
which shows teachers‚Äô ICT device operation during lectures.
ICT Operational Model uses Extended Operational ProÔ¨Åles
which include users‚Äô sojourn times and sojourn counts in
addition to operational proÔ¨Åles. Also, this paper showed the
construction of ICT Operational Model from the operational
logs of TDS. ICT Operational Model and ICT Operational
Pattern suggest not only the certain effect to measure ICT-
based teaching and plan for construction of ICT devices but
also construction of learning program and learning environ-
ment using ICT devices. ICT Operational Model and ICT
Operational Pattern show the evaluation methods of software

and information system. This research also can be applied to
other software and information systems, as well as information
systems for education. Now, we are developing the function
which automatically creates ICT operational model and pattern
from operational logs by using the result of this study.
