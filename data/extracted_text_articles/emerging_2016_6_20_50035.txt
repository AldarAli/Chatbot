Abstract—Generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) 
is a promising technique to implement all-optical core 
networks. In this paper, we propose a new optical code labeling 
(OCL) based on optical code- division multiple access 
(OCDMA) techniques for packet switching. To improve the 
efficiency of label-recognition and network throughput, 
bipolar label coding is employed in the proposed scheme. Label 
switching capabilities in packet loss probability (PLP) is 
greatly enhanced since our proposal enlarges the Hamming 
distance of the star diagram of the decoded label signals. The 
proposed label mapping mechanism is achieved through 
spectral amplitude coding (SAC) in the physical layer. In 
performance analysis, we present a numerical simulation of 
PLP to quantify the switching efficiency. Results show the 
proposed bipolar coding technique reduces PLP in switching 
process, resulting in an extension of label switching path (LSP) 
in GMPLS core network.

 INTRODUCTION 
From its combination with the existing Internet Protocol 
(IP) layer and the control paradigm over multiple routing 
domains, one can realize the maturity in Generalized Multi- 
Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) in practical application 
and deployment [1].  After being standardized by Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF), great effort in investigating 
the inter-operable GMPLS network has been taken by 
numerous researchers. Much attention to GMPLS protocols 
comes from the integration across network layers [2]. This 
advantage is a fundamental principle of designing a reliable 
system and reduces the complexity in network control for 
operators. 
Optical Code Labeling (OCL), mapping the packet 
address onto the label through optically encoding, is 
proposed as a labeling procedure in GMPLS networks [3]. 
This labeling scheme is modified from a multiplexing 
technique known as Optical Code-Division Multiple Access 
(OCDMA). Optical code is used as a label to switch different 
data flows to the desired path without Optical-to-Electrical 
(O/E) conversion [4]. Spectral Amplitude Coding (SAC) 
system has a cost-effective de/encoder due to the rapid 
development of filter components [5], such as Array 
Waveguide Grating (AWG) and Fiber Bragged Grating 
(FBG). Furthermore, the code chips are encoded on the 
spectrum slices, without compressing the time waveform. 
The electronic devices in the codec could operate at a low 
speed of bit-rate instead of high chip-rate. Meanwhile, coded 
signals from different users can be transmitted over the same 
wavelength band without the impact of Multiple Access 
Interference (MAI). From above reasons, we adapt the SAC 
codec for the label generating and processing units in 
GMPLS network. 
In this paper, we modify the node structure in GMPLS so 
that it could fit for the proposed bipolar OCL. With the 
moderate complexity of node architecture, label space is 
enlarged while keeping the short processing time. Compared 
to On-Off Keying (OOK), the packet is switched in a more 
secure environment since label of each packet is represented 
by one of two distinct codes, according to the payload bit [6]. 
Another advantage of bipolar OCL is a higher measured 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the decoder end, due to the 
larger Hamming distance between levels of bit “0” and “1”. 
Therefore, the system performance has a huge advance in 
Packet Loss Probability (PLP), achieving a longer 
transmission distance in Label Switching Path (LSP). 
This paper is divided into five main sections. Section I 
provides some background information about GMPLS 
network and the label generating and processing schemes for 
packet switching. Section II outline the design of the 
proposed bipolar OCL scheme in GMPLS network. Section 
III describes the architecture of Edge Node (EN) and Core 
Node (CN) with the function of bipolar OCL. Sections IV 
presents the system performance analysis and shows the 
improving results of PLP. Finally, section V draws the 
conclusion.

BIPOLAR OCL SCHEME IN GMPLS NETWORKS 
We present an edge-core-edge transmission in GMPLS 
network with the proposed labeling scheme. Hadamard codes 
are used as optical labels for the network, to achieve all 
optical switching by constructing the code switching layer 
among network nodes. Hadamard codes, obtained by 
selecting the rows of Hadamard matrix as code vectors, were

originally used for Two-Code Keying (TCK) in SAC-
OCDMA systems to enhance system performance [7]. In that 
scheme, user sends Hadamard code vector Cm for data bit “1” 
and its complement 
C m
for bit “0”. The correlation

Adapting bipolar OCL for packet switching increases the 
efficiency of packet processing, with a moderate degree of 
complexity at CN. To append optical labels on a packet, edge 
node (EN) performs label mapping and generating. Each path 
connected between nodes is assigned two code labels, a 
Hadamard code, and its complement, as shown in Fig. 1. For 
instance, the path between CN1 and CN2 corresponds to code 
C1 and 
1
C . The reason for this assignment is to support 
bipolar OCL, as well as to expand the label space. Figure 1 
also shows the demonstration of label stacking. The data 
flow along LSP of (CN1-CN2-CN3) is switched by CNs 
according to the two-level label, C1 and C2. Edge node EN1 
performs the integration of distinct code labels before the 
packet traffics the node-to-node path. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Node-to-node transmission in GMPLS with bipolar OCL. 
The LSP in Fig. 1 includes two path segments of codes 
C1/
1
C and C2/
C2
. Table I illustrates the bipolar OCL 
scheme with Hadamard coded label of length 4. For payload 
bit “1”, C1 and C2, matching wavelength bins of (1, 0,3, 0) 
and (1,2, 0, 0) are selected. On the other hand, for the case 
of bit “0”, the edge node transmits 
1
C  = (0, 2, 0, 4) and 
C2
= (0, 0, 3, 4) to the network. Since all labels are 
spectrally coded on the same wavelength band 1~4, the 
combined signal is the summation of the coded spectrum, S1 = 
(21, 2, 3, 0) for bit “1” and S0 = (0, 2, 3, 24) for bit “0”. 
Table II shows the packet switching process at CN1 and CN2. 
The label summation of S is correlated with C1 and 
1
C , 
indicating the path between CN1 and CN2. The result of 
correlation subtraction for bit “1” is 2-unit power, and CN1 
establishes a link to CN2 as a part of LSP. At CN2, the 
correlated results for bit “1” with C2 and C3 are 2 and 0-unit 
power, respectively. Thus, CN2 switches the packet to CN3 
along the path matching C2. Note that for bit “0,” the CN 
does not set up any connection due to the negative 
correlation value, and the packet is blocked for a bit interval.

DESCRIPTION OF NODE STRUCTURE WITH BCL 
FUNCTION 
To make fully switching, there are N pieces of encoders 
for bipolar OCL in an EN, where N is the total path number 
in the network, as shown in Fig. 2. Broadband Light Source 
(BLS), which connects to an optical switch, is used as the 
encoder’s input. The header processor sets up the connection 
between BLS and OCL encoder by firstly analyzing packet 
destination and deriving a specific LSP. Then, a control 
signal closes the switches linking to the corresponding label 
generators. Each OCL unit has two outputs: spectrally 
Hadamard coded signal Cm and its complement. The outputs 
of optical codes and their complementary codes from 
different encoders are combined respectively by power 
combiners. An optical switch selects the one of the two 
summed signals based on data bit “0” or “1”. The chosen 
one is further sent into a fiber. 
CN executes the opposite decoding operation and 
switches packet to the proper path. In a CN, there are M 
pieces of OCL decoders similar to the encoders in edge node, 
where M is the number of output paths, as shown in Fig. 3. 
At first, a part of the incoming signal is split for label 
recognizing using a 1 by 2 power splitter. The tapped signal 
is distributed into different OCL decoders using a 1 by M 
power splitter. The outputs of decoders control the switching 
state of the M by M optical cross bar, which establishes a 
connection to the output path corresponding to the incoming 
label.

Figure 4.  (a) FBG encoder for label generating; (b) FBG decoder for label 
recognizing. 
Spectrally Hadamard-coded signal with length N and 
code weight N/2 is formed by a series of wavelength bins 
that match code chip “1” at the output of OCL encoder, as 
shown in Fig. 4(a). The coded label is generated from a 
group of N/2 copies of FBGs in the encoder. To transfer 
payload bit “1” or “0” into wavelength bins, the FBG-based 
encoder performs optical    encoding    by    reflecting   and 
transmitting wavelength bins. The FBG-based decoder, as 
shown in Fig. 4(b), rejects other uncorrelated labels or MAI 
and makes sure that the correlated one can be successfully 
recovered to the original data bit. Following the decoder is a 
balanced detector (BD), which outputs zero power if the 
summed signals do not include the matching label. To 
determine the initial payload bit, a quantizer restores the 
signals by threshold decision. 
IV. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION RESULT 
In order to express the switching benefit of the proposed 
OCL, SNR shown at the label decoder is analyzed to 
quantify the system performance. We use the assumption for 
BLS characteristics and the mathematical deduction [8] to 
firstly derive the photocurrent, which is expressed as 
sr / 2
I
 RP
                                  (5)

where Psr is the received power at decoder and R is the 
responsivity of the photo-diode in the BD. Phase intensity 
noise and thermal noise are main degrading factor of SAC 
systems [9]. This paper only considers Phase Intensity 
Induced Noise (PIIN) since it is the dominant noise when 
optical signal is converted to electrical domain. The variance 
of PIIN is denoted as

where B is the electrical noise bandwidth, v is the spectral 
width of BLS and K is the number of stacked labels. By 
using Gaussian approximation, the PLPs of bipolar and

The spectral width of BLS is 4.5THz and the electrical noise 
bandwidth is 10GHz. We use the Hadamard coded labels of 
N = 16 for simulation. In Fig. 5, packet with the proposed 
label performs better PLP than the one with the unipolar 
label. Under small number of the stacked labels, both types 
have relatively good results keeping the PLP under 10-9. 
However, PIIN increasing with the label number degrades 
the system performance, when the number of stacked labels 
is large. For the bipolar label code, despite a larger PIIN 
variance, it still has a higher SNR value due to the doubled 
signal power. The stacked label number for bipolar OCL is 2 
times of the other under PLP = 10-9. This implies more labels 
can be attached to a single packet, resulting in an extension 
of LSP. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we propose a bipolar OCL scheme in 
GMPLS network that enhances the switching efficiency by 
enlarging Hamming distance on the star diagram of the 
decoded labels. Reducing the PLP during label-recognizing 
procedure is a critical issue in GMPLS since it increases the 
distance of LSP in all-optical switching. The bipolar labeling 
is implemented based on the correlation and orthogonal 
properties of Hadamard codes. We adapt the FBG-based 
codec of OCDMA technique for modifying the node 
structure. A numerical simulation is conducted for the 
proposed scheming, proving the stacked label number is 
increased by utilizing the proposed bipolar label.
