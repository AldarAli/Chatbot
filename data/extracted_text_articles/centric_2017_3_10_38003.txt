Abstract—An increasing customer usage of Internet services 
with various devices demands a greater effort on data security 
credibility and trust issues because the extensive connections 
personal data are spread more widely. However, customers 
often prefer better services rather than higher data security. 
Here, the aim of this paper is to examine the positive influence 
of the perceived data security on the usage frequency of Internet 
services. The main target will be to measure how the user 
perceived data security and perceived trust influences the usage 
frequency of Internet services. This will be analyzed with an 
adjusted conceptual model based on elements of the Unified 
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2. Generally, a 
significant positive influence of a perceived data security on the 
usage frequency for specific services can be found. Yet, the 
perceived trust in the service providers does not significantly 
relate to a stronger usage frequency of Internet services. 
Consequently, customers have data security concerns and these 
might hinder them to use several Internet services.   
Keywords-data security; trust; usage frequency; Internet 
services.  
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The growth of the number of Internet services and of the 
number of users lead to an increased amount of gained data. 
Especially services like (a) instant messaging, (b) social 
media, (c) video on demand (broadcasting/streaming), (d) 
gaming, and (e) cloud computing are used by more and more 
people with more different devices [1][2][3]. Due to this 
application of services, the degree of connection of the people 
and devices increases quite heavily [1]. Based on the growth 
of the number of connections and Internet services usages, 
the users produce more personal data and the data is spread 
to a larger degree [2]. 
From the customer point of view, it is difficult to 
comprehend to which extent personal data is collected, where 
the personal data is stored and which persons get access to 
handle the raised personal data for legal or illegal motives 
[3][4]. Due to the increased connectivity between the devices, 
unhindered individual communications and marketing 
measures, a wide range of information and personal data is 
disclosed. The data disclosure touches the security and 
privacy concerns of the customers because the personal 
information 
could 
include 
critical 
information 
and 
intellectual properties of the users themselves. Furthermore, 
personal information are countable assets from which 
enterprises and criminals can benefit [1][5]. Nonetheless, 
each user is responsible which data he or she releases for the 
usage of the specific Internet services and the different 
devices. Obviously, a lot of people are willing to distribute 
their personal information to get a good performance of the 
used services. Here, they often do not care about risks of data 
leakages and data misuse.  
The rising number of security incidents shows that 
criminals more frequently attack enterprises, administrations 
and private customers to get the personal data because they 
have detected the values of these personal information and 
intellectual properties [6]. As a result, customers should care 
more about possible data privacy and security concerns, 
while using Internet services. 
As a consequence, we want to examine if the private 
customers have data privacy and data security concerns when 
they use different Internet services with various devices. 
Together with the different conditions of wired and wireless 
networks and connections, different types of data security 
problems could arise. In this respect, we want to measure the 
status and the perception of data security while customers 
using the following services: (a) email, (b) social media, (c) 
online telephony, (d) online shopping, (e) cloud computing, 
(f) e-learning, (g) instant messaging, (h) online banking, (i) 
navigation, (j) online administration, (j) video on demand, 
and (k) internet television. Additionally, we add the customer 
evaluation of the trust of the providers of the named Internet 
services. Here, it will be measured how the customers 
perceive that the providers of the Internet services in general 
further distribute their personal data. Due to customers use 
the named Internet service differently in the wired and 
wireless networks, we separate the results in the two named 
considerations. On the hand, we consider the perceptions in 
the fixed/wired infrastructure environment and on the other 
hand, the results in the mobile/wireless infrastructure 
environment. Therefore, we implement a variable how the 
customers perceive the credibility of the network security 
(operator).  
This implementation should just show how the customers 
estimate the network, but it would not be used for the analysis 
of the relation to the usage frequency of Internet services. 
For this reason, the perception of the credibility of the 
operator and the importance of data security are falling 
behind the major considerations of the customer perception

of data security by using Internet services and the trust 
provider of these services.   
In Section II, the term data security, the known literature 
and used research models will be described. Following this 
section, the methodology, as well as the theoretical approach 
for carrying out the analysis, will be briefly explained. In 
Section IV the results of the hypothesis tests are briefly 
presented. Finally, in Section V, a critical discussion of the 
results takes place.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Data Security 
In general, the term "data security" describes the secure 
management of personal data, secure data transmission and 
the transparency of which institutions or persons have access 
to the personal customer data [5][7]. The correct 
implementation of data security usually involves that the 
customers themselves decide who is entitled to access their 
data. As mentioned in the introduction, customers often 
ignore possible risks of sharing information and they are not 
aware of the amount of data, which they produce and which 
are the consequences if the personal data would be leaked 
[8][9][10]. The ignorance shows critical issues in three 
dimensions. Firstly, customers spread personal data which 
could be linked to confidential information like bank 
accounts and credit card numbers [8][9]. Secondly, a lot of 
companies use and transmit – without permission and 
knowledge of the customers – private customer information, 
which the customers disclose during the usage of Internet 
services [11]. Thirdly, as already mentioned, the number of 
Internet security incidents – like criminal acts of password 
capturing, eavesdropping and blackmails – have increased 
quite heavily during the last couple of years [3][6].  
Yet, the perceptions of (a) data security, (b) trust, (c) 
credibility, (d) sharing of information and (e) risks differs 
between the individual customers and depend beside others 
on factors like demography and culture [8]. It is also known 
that most of the customers prefer a good Internet service 
performance instead of strong security or data protection 
measures. Here, customers frequently do not care about the 
consequences of misuse and data leakage. Especially these 
behaviors motivate us to investigate which factors directly 
influence the usage frequency of Internet services and the 
individual perception of data security and trust.  
 
B. Research Model – Adjusted Model with Elements of the 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2  
The main target of this study will be to get an increased 
comprehension of private customer behaviors, especially in 
the focus on data security and trust concerns and the 
acceptance and actual usage of services.  
The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
2 (UTAUT2) is the direct expansion of the known UTAUT 
concepts with the factors hedonic motivation, price, and 
habit/experience, which allows a broader consideration of 
critical influence factors on user behavior [12]-[15].  
Nevertheless, perceived data security and perceived trust 
could not be covered by the existing variables of UTAUT2. 
Nonetheless, an implementation of external variables as 
influence factors of the user behavior could be performed. By 
the approach of Escorbar-Rodriguez and Carvajal-Trujillo, 
the UTAUT2 model could be expanded by external variables 
trust as well as the further components perceived security and 
perceived privacy [12][16]. This expansion makes clear that 
the influence of security measures and perceptions on the 
behavioral intention to use of an innovation can be 
investigated [12][16]. Furthermore, this approach motivates 
us to use the factors perceived data security and perceived 
trust as external variables in the own adapted model (see 
Figure 1) [16]. Therefore, the adapted model keeps only the 
basic idea of the UTAUT2. In this context, Lin et al. have 
figured out that data security and privacy are the most 
affecting factors for an acceptance and adoption of a new 
technology [13].  
Consequently, we want to directly measure the impact of 
the perceived data security measures on the actual usage of 
Internet services (instead of testing the relationship with the 
behavioral intention to use, as Zhong et al. already did [17]). 
In other words: The target of investigation is to analyze 
whether perceived data security and trust issues lead to a 
utilization of an Internet service. 
Generally, we estimate that an increased perception for 
data security measures and trust concerns would lead to an 
increased usage of services. For the further combined 
regression analyses, the external variables perceived 
credibility (operator credibility) and importance of data 
security are also implemented. Perceived credibility 
describes the users’ belief that the used systems would be free 
of threats for privacy and security and how the customers 
estimate and perceive the reliability of the service providers 
[15]. Customers recognize the behavior of providers if they 
take care (or if they don´t do so) about the personal 
information and secure transmissions [17]-[27].  
Due to the fact that using Internet services (especially 
mobile services) include security and privacy threats [18], we 
implement the factor trust. The perception of trust describes 
how credible the customers perceive the provider 
[1][16][28][29][30]. Based on the assumption that risks and 
perceived trust directly influence the usage processes [31], 
the customers would reduce their usage if they expect a loss 
of privacy and a higher risk in usage [1][32][33][34]. The 
particular importance of the key factors of risk and trust lies 
in the fact that these two factors have a major influence on 
the customer acceptance of innovations (especially mobile 
payments, 
mobile 
banking 
and 
mobile 
shopping) 
[17][18][35]-[38]. In addition, trust in a service or in a service 
provider plays an important role for the customer, since this 
increases the customer's sense of satisfaction in the service 
and thus leads to a higher usage frequency [31][39].

Finally, non-existent trust or the perception of missing 
security negatively impact customer behavior. An increase in 
security by using a service would give the customers a more 
confident, secured and satisfied emotion and could possibly 
imply a stronger usage of this service. For this reason, the 
used survey also includes questions about how the customers 
perceive the security of the infrastructure and how the 
network operators use the gained data from the customer.  
Based on these explanations, the hypotheses for this 
research paper are: 
 
H1: The customer perception of data security has a 
directly positive effect on the usage of Internet services. 
H2: An increased perceived provider trust has a directly 
positive effect on the usage of Internet services.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The hypotheses are validated on the basis of a current 
survey. The answers were taken by interviewers in personal 
interviews, thus ensuring completeness and accuracy of the 
answers. The respondents were randomly chosen and asked 
if they wanted to answer the questionnaire. The interviewers 
were instructed to choose the interviewees as far as possible 
randomly to make sure to get a sample which represent the 
demographic characteristics of gender and age of the local 
population [40][41]. Generally, test persons are asked in 
December 2016 at public libraries in Wiesbaden (which is a 
city with approx. 275,000 inhabitants in the middle of 
Germany) to reach a diversified and representative selection 
of test persons. In total, the survey includes 290 completed 
questionnaires. The collected data has been examined based 
on quantitative research methods with the statistical program 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). To 
evaluate the reliability and validity of the obtained data, 
Cronbach Alpha was determined and an Exploratory Factor 
Analysis was performed.  
The perceived data security was queried with the question, 
how the customers perceive their personal data for each 
specific Internet service in the usage of a fixed and/or mobile 
Internet access (5-Point-Likert-scale: very secure to very 
unsecure). For the measurement of the usage frequency of 
(mobile) Internet services, a 5-Point-Likert-scale (very often 
to very few) has been used [42]. Finally, the trust is measured 
by the question of whether or what users perceive the Internet 
service 
providers 
to 
spread 
their 
personal 
data 
(unauthorized). 
 
 
 
 
 
As mentioned above, the used approach only keeps 
elements of the UTAUT2. Therefore, we do not follow the 
analysis with a Structural Equation Modeling. Instead, we use 
the ordinary least square regressions to test the significance 
of each of the named hypotheses [12][13]. In the afterwards 
following combined approach under recognizing and 
controlling of further variables like importance of data 
security, perceived credibility and password changing 
behavior, we use a combined regression analysis.    
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  
A. Result Conditions   
The following discussion assumes far predominantly that 
the participants of the survey answer as private customers, 
even if it cannot be completely excluded that some of the 
respondents may also answer from their perspective of 
personal small enterprises.  
We will describe the results of the reliability and validity 
tests of the overall used hypotheses briefly. After this testing, 
the regression results of hypotheses will be prioritized to 
figure out the relationships between (a) perceived data 
security as well as perceived trust in the service providers and 
(b) the usage of specific Internet services.  
 
B. Descriptive Results 
It could be achieved 290 completed questionnaires. 
However, the expanded second survey covers 7 sets of 
questions. 55.0% of the respondents are male and the average

age of a respondent is between 30 and 39 years. With 48.1%, 
the group of the 20 and 29-year-olds has the largest share of 
respondents. Thus, this age group (which is 12.2% of the total 
population in Germany) is overrepresented in the survey by a 
factor of four [43]. Based on a study of ARD/ZDF from 2015 
the 20 to 29-year-old nearly 100% Internet users [44]. 
The over-representation in younger age groups naturally 
leads to an under-representation of the elder age groups. 
Consequently, the collected data are not representative.  
26.5% of respondents feel confident about their data, but 
on the contrary, 32.9% of respondents feel more or less 
insecure about their data. Interestingly, the one third of 
respondents, who feel insecure in their data security, does not 
fit at all with the results of the password changing behavior 
of the customers, since more than 80% of the customers 
change their passwords much less frequently than once a 
year: For email accounts 84.3% and for social media accounts 
89.2%. Normally it would be expected that more people 
change their passwords more regularly if they will a data 
insecurity. In this respect, it can be stated as the first 
conclusion that the perception of the data security does not 
affect the frequency of the password changes. This could be 
the reason because a higher password security increases the 
overall security, but it does not affect the data privacy if the 
customers distribute their data on their own.  
89.0% of respondents use an anti-virus program which fit 
with the quotas of 85.5%, which are also confirmed by 
studies by the software company McAfee, which reported 
85.5% [45].  
In average, the customers believe that fixed Internet 
providers have a little bit safer infrastructure than mobile 
Internet providers. Email services are the mostly used 
services overall (round about 80%). In the fixed 
infrastructures, about 3/4 of the customers use online 
shopping, video on demand and online banking (independent 
from the usage frequency). In the consideration of mobile 
devices and mobile infrastructures, about 4/5 of the 
customers use instant messaging.

The tables show the different services: (I) the importance 
of data security, (II) the usage frequency of Internet services, 
and (III) confidence in service providers. Interestingly, 
customers in the services they use very frequently (social 
media and instant messaging) feel a relatively low data 
security. Customers also recognize that the providers of these 
services do not particularly secure the customer data and use 
it for their own purposes. In opposite, the usage of online 
banking is relatively rare, but data security is very important 
to customers in this area, which is, of course, mainly due to 
the nature of the service and is presumably independent of the 
channel through which this financial service is provided.  
 
C. Reliability and Validity 
The results of the reliability and validity analyses are 
illustrated in the Tables IV and V. In general, this study 
includes the following 7 aspects: (1) usage of Internet 
services (fixed networks), (2) usage of Internet services 
(mobile networks), (3) usage frequency of Internet services, 
(4) perceived importance of data security, (5) perceived data 
security (fixed networks), (6) perceived data security (mobile 
networks), and (7) perceived trust.  
 Generally, all named concepts are examined in the terms 
of reliability and validity. Following Cronbach, Alpha values 
must be higher than 0.7 to for a good reliability [46][47][48]. 
Based on the results in Table IV, the collected data for the 7 
named aspects are reliable. 
After the testing of the reliability, the exploratory factor 
analysis includes the assessment of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin 
criterion (KMO), the significance test from Bartlett, and the 
examination of the cumulative variance to evaluate the 
validity of the collected data [49]-[53]. To reach a good 
validity, the concepts should reach significant p values 
(p<0.05) in the Bartlett-Test and KMO values above 0.7 [49]-
[53].  
Table V shows good validity scores of the collected 
data/aspects can be comprehended. The good validity scores 
are also supported by the results of the cumulative variances 
higher than 50%, which indicate high explanation rates of the 
collected data [50][51][52]. Consequently, the reliability and 
validity of the collected data are proved.

D. Regression Analyses 
As mentioned above, the scope of the study does not allow 
the testing of all hypotheses.  
In the following, at least, the relationship between the 
factors perceived data security, perceived trust and the usage 
frequency of Internet services will be analyzed by means of 
ordinary least square regressions. The perceived data security 
is analyzed differently for the use of fixed and mobile Internet 
services. This differentiation takes account of the fact that the 
various network / service types have different advantages and 
disadvantages, and therefore also different uses can be 
expected.  
Following the named regression analyses, we combined all 
possible influence factors of security issues which they have 
collected in the survey to analyze their impact on the usage 
of Internet services. 
For this purpose, the perceived data security (= 
independent variable) is analyzed separately for mobile and 
fixed broadband infrastructures / services) in relation to the 
usage frequency of the individual Internet services (= 
independent variables); see Table VI. 
The r-square values of the individual regressions are quite 
low, which is mainly due to two causes. On the one hand, 
only the effects of perceived data security are analyzed for 
the usage frequency of each service. In each individual case, 
an r-square for the regression between only an independent 
variable and a dependent variable is determined. In so far as 
it is assumed, the individual r-squares are not quite as high. 
On the other hand, the usage frequency of an Internet service 
does not depend solely on the perceived data security. Based 
on the estimation of many different influencing factors (some 
are mentioned in the presented research model), the r-squares 
cannot be quite so high and we assume weak regressions.  
For the usage of the following services in the fixed and 
mobile infrastructures, (a) Internet protocol television 
(IPTV), (b) instant messaging, and (c) online gaming, the 
customer data security perception does not impact the usage 
of these services; therefore, the hypothesis H1 cannot be 
accepted. For the services e-learning and cloud computing, 
significant positive regression relations could be found for 
both infrastructures (fixed and mobile). This means if a 
customer perceives a higher data security in his learning 
application, he will use the service more frequently. The 
coefficients of 0.286 (fixed) and 0.370 (mobile) show a quite 
moderate explanatory rate. As mentioned above, the r-
squares of 3.3% (fixed) and 5.7% (mobile) are quite low and 
describe only a low coefficient of determination. Also, if 
customers perceive a higher data security when they use 
cloud services then they will use them more frequently. 
Coefficients of 0.330 (fixed) and 0.232 (mobile) and r-
squares of 5.8% (fixed) and 2.8% (mobile) shows a moderate 
explanatory rate and low degree of determination 
[52][53][54]. For these both services, we do not assume 
differences in the usage of the services in the both 
infrastructures and the hypothesis H1 could be accepted.   
The analysis of other services (online shopping, online 
banking, e-mail, social media, online telephony) shows 
differences in the results of the regression analyses between 
mobile or fixed infrastructures. The main reason for 
differences is the general use of services. Navigation and 
social media services are used by mobile devices in mobile 
infrastructures almost twice as frequently as fixed-line 
connections. In contrast, online banking services are used 
much more frequently via fixed broadband infrastructures 
than mobile connections. 
The perceived data security has only a relatively small (but 
measurable) influence on the use of navigation services with 
mobile devices / networks only weak: regression of 0.161 and 
r-square of 2.1%. This may be due to the fact that the primary 
goal of most users of a navigation service is to locate a 
destination and it is self-evident to them that they may have 
to make concessions for data security (for example, by 
authorizing the location). 
For fixed networks, positively significant regressions 
between the perceived data security for emails respectively 
perceived online banking data security and the usage of these 
services could be identified. Despite low r-squares of 5.8% 
(email) and 5.5% (online banking) and weak regressions, the 
single coefficients of 0.357 (email) and 0.295 (online 
banking) represent moderate explanatory rates [52][53][54].  
Since e-mails and, in particular, bank accounts generally 
contain highly sensitive data from customers, the loss of 
which can cause considerable damage, customers' need for 
high data security for these services is, of course, particularly 
high. If the users perceive a better data security for these 
services, or if the service providers can guarantee their

(mostly below 3) and therefore, multicollinearities not exist 
[49][55][56]. Nonetheless, in some cases, the constants are 
also significant (p<0.05), which could be an indicator for 
other influence factors or an existing endogeneity. In the 
further research and examination of the data, we will consider 
the influence factors and try to figure out which are the 
indicators for the significant constants. 
The relationship of the perceived trust in the service 
providers (independent variable) and the usage frequency of 
Internet services (dependent variable) generally show no 
significant relationship for the specific services. The only 
exception is the service online shopping. The positive 
significant relationship (coefficient = 0.117) shows that 
customers, who perceive that the shopping providers do not 
further distribute their personal information, will more 
frequently use these online shopping platforms. However, the 
r-square of 1.7% and the coefficient below 0.200 do not 
imply a good explanatory rate and it must be assumed that 
regressive connection is weak [52][53][54]. Generally, the 
hypothesis H2 about the influence of the customer perception 
of trust in the service providers of the single specific Internet 
services on the usage frequency of the specific services 
cannot be accepted. It must be assumed that trust as single 
factor does not have an influence on the customer decision of 
service usage.  
Finally, as already mentioned, a combined regression 
analysis approach is carried out with the implementation of 
all of the above concepts in order to analyze the influence on 
the frequency of the user behavior of the specific Internet 
services. The following variables are controlled: (a) overall 
perceived data security (in general without any consideration 
of a single service), (b) perceived importance of data security, 
(c) perceived credibility of the network operators and (d) 
perceived trust in the service providers. The regression 
analyses for each individual service are carried out separately 
and shown according to the use of mobile or fixed network 
services. 
The control of the variables which cover security issues 
(except perceived data security) reveals significant regressive

influences of perceived data security on the usage frequency 
of the specific Internet services (email, cloud computing, 
online banking and e-learning); see Table VII.

* Other independent variables overall perceived data security, perceived importance of data security, perceived credibility of the network operators and 
perceived trust in the service providers are controlled and implemented.  
** The regression presents a significant constant, which could be an indicator for further unconsidered variables or an existing endogeneity, which needs 
further investigation.  
*** The regression presents a significant constant, which could be an indicator for further unconsidered variables or an existing endogeneity, which needs 
further investigation. Furthermore, the Durban-Watson-Test recognizes a value which could be an indicator for an existing autocorrelation. To cover the 
spurious correlations, further investigations must be performed. 
 
The control of the variables confirms the results obtained 
in the first point. When customers use e-mail services over 
the fixed networks and they feel confident about their data, 
they will use the data more frequently. Although nearly 80% 
of the customers use email services over the mobile networks, 
no significant connection could be found. Despite the non-
significance for mobile networks, the regression coefficient 
of 0.363 for fixed networks shows a moderate explanatory 
rate [52][53][54]. However, the r-square of 9.7% describes 
only weak regression with a low coefficient of determination 
[52][53][54]. The VIF is below 3, so multicollinearities can 
be excluded [49][55][56]. It can be assumed that customers 
who experience more data security when using e-mail 
services will use these services more frequently. This is 
mainly because customers have stored many confidential 
information in their e-mail accounts and do not want third 
parties to have access to these data. 
A similar relationship exists for cloud computing: when 
customers perceive higher data security for cloud computing 
services, they will use these services more frequently 
(significantly positive). Despite a moderate regression 
coefficient of 0.261, the r-square of 8.2% shows a weak 
regression. The VIF under 3 allows the exclusion of 
multicollinearities [49][55][56]. 
The third line of Table VII represents the influence of the 
perceived data security on the usage of online banking. 
Independently if the customers use online banking in the 
mobile or fixed networks, it can be identified that users, who 
have security issues with online banking, do not use online 
banking. The regression coefficients of 0.218 (fixed) and 
0.352 (mobile) describe also moderate explanatory rates.  
 
 
 
The r-squares of 12.0% (fixed) and 17.7% (mobile) do not 
imply strong regressions, however, the values are two to three 
times higher than the r-squares, mentioned above (see Table 
VI). These both percentages describe how much the 
perceived data security declare the decision how often online 
banking will be used. When people use online banking 
services, they care about data security issues. 
The service e-learning is not used by many customers. But, 
when customers use the service in the mobile environment, 
the decision to use is influenced by data security issues. The 
coefficient of 0.328 describes a moderate explanatory rate. 
The r-square of 14.5% is similar to the results of online 
banking. Despite a normally classified weak regression, this 
value is better than the results presented above.  
To support the previous findings and to expand the results, 
we have executed a combined regression analysis with the 
controls of most of the used variables. For the named 
services, the hypothesis H1 can be accepted because data 
security concerns impact the decision to use a service 
(frequently). However, for the other services (social media, 
IPTV, online gaming, instant messaging), the hypothesis H1 
has to be rejected because an impact of data security issues 
on the usage of these services could not be significantly 
proved. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have analyzed indicators which influence 
the decision and usage frequency of Internet services. The 
focus of the publication is on the effects of perceived data 
security and perceived trust in the use decision and the usage 
frequency of Internet services. 
In the first step, the influence of perceived data security or 
perceived trust on the usage frequency of certain internet

services was examined. To support the results so far and to 
expand the results, we have conducted a combined regression 
analysis, focusing on the impact of the data security 
perceived by customers on the use of the services.  
It could not be proved in general that security concerns and 
especially concerns in data security and trust in service 
providers lead to a reduced or an increased usage of the 
services. Nonetheless, some evidences and implications for 
specific services like email, online banking and e-learning 
exist. Customers who perceive that their data will be safe, use 
the service more frequently than customers, who feel 
uncertain. The main question is, why only some of the used 
services are influenced. We are in the opinion that these 
developments directly depend on the nature of the service. 
For example, Bank accounts and e-mails usually contain 
confidential information, the losses of which can have serious 
consequences for customers. In contrast, the use of services, 
such as IPTV merely reveals some information to individual 
preferences or behaviors. However, most people do not 
appreciate this information as so critical. 
The second investigation focuses on the perceived trust in 
service providers. It examines how the transfer of customer 
data to third parties is evaluated. Interestingly, no evidences 
for the influence of the perceived trust on the usage of 
Internet services could be found. It must be predicted that 
data distributions by the service providers do not impact the 
user’s decision to use a service. This non-existing relation 
could be explained by the fact that the most people focus on 
the performance and usability of the Internet services instead 
of the security, which is mentioned in the second section of 
this study. Furthermore, it must be assumed that the most 
people are not aware about these data distributions. 
Therefore, the rejection of this hypothesis is not surprisingly. 
To get a better overview, the other relations between the 
security concerns of data security importance, perceived 
operator credibility and password changing behavior must be 
also considered. Consequently, further data analysis and 
research would be necessary to deepen the current findings.
