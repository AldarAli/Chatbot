II. REQUIREMENTS OF END-USER MOBILE APPLICATION 
AUTHORING 
A. User-centricity  – Task-driven abstraction and 
visualization 
In a mobile computing environment, it is especially crucial 
for end-users to access mobile computing resources based on 
their task goals without considering any technical details. End-
users need to be able to focus on describing what they need to 
achieve their task goals rather than expressing the detail 
structure and functions to be implemented in their applications. 
In addition, there must be a visual aid to allow users to 
intuitively represent their task requirements and to understand 
the core activities to be supported by a mobile application. 
B. Efficiency – Automated and non-error-prone authoring 
and instantiation processes 
Most end-users are non-programmers who do not have 
enough technical skills to create, recognize and compose 
services and to monitor applications [5]. Therefore, it is 
essential to minimize such technical burdens of users by 
automating the process of selecting and combining component 
services that are necessary to accomplish a task goal. In 
addition, there must be a mechanism of bridging the gap 
between a high-level task representation and a set of services 
available in a mobile computing environment, and making 
automated bindings between those two different abstractions.  
End-users’ authoring activities are normally error prone. 
Therefore, the authoring process should support the ways of 
resolving mismatches between required capabilities and 
available service functions, and validating an application 
against a user’s task goal. 
C. Reusability and Evolovability  – Reuse of common 
application patterns and support of application evolution 
In mobile computing environments, there is a wide 
spectrum of applications to be supported for diverse types of 
users. In these environments, reuse of common application 
patterns and evolution of applications based on users’ feedback 
are critical to reduce development efforts of applications and to 
improve the quality of applications [11][12]. Therefore, it is 
necessary to provide a mechanism to identify a common 
structure and functionalities to support a similar set of user 
tasks and to enable these common application patterns to be 
refined and extended based on users’ feedback. The application 
instantiation process also needs to meet these requirements by 
providing a mechanism of reusing successful task-service 
bindings for similar situations, and by making these binding 
patterns evolvable. 
D. Mobile Usability – Usability support in user-interface-
constrained mobile computing environments 
Mobile usability is about allowing mobile users to 
effectively interact with an application by using User Interface 
(UI)-constrained computing environments such as smart 
phones and tabular PCs. The end-user mobile application 
authoring environment should support mobile usability such 
that users can effectively represent and recognize the core 
structure of task activities by using their mobile devices. The 
granularity of UI elements that comprise a task-driven 
abstraction of an application needs to be coarse-grained enough 
to be efficiently visualized on a small screen, and to be 
controlled by using constrained input methods. Especially, it is 
essential to make the high-level UI abstraction of an 
application consistent with the detail application integration 
structure [6].  
III. RELATED WORK 
End-user software engineering is a paradigm to allow end-
users to create and manage software applications without 
having deep programming knowledge and skills [4]. Many 
approaches have been developed to help end-users conduct 
various development activities throughout the software 
development lifecycle. 
A. Flowchart-based Approach 
In this approach, end-users can draw a flow of component 
services and conditions by using a common format or template 
provided by developers [13][14]. Although this allows users to 
structure an application based on the main flow of activities 
and events that are important in a specific domain, it is often 
difficult for end-users to learn and understand detail notations 
(branches, loops, etc.) and options (e.g., sequential structure vs. 
parallel structure) to represent a flow. 
The activities in a flow are normally represented at the 
same abstraction level as component services. Therefore, users 
need to associate each activity to a specific component service 
to be used. It is usually a difficult job for end-users to 
recognize, select and compose component services with 
understanding their functionality and other technical factors 
such as interfaces, preconditions and post-conditions. In 
addition, the detail flow structure cannot be shown effectively 
on a small screen of a mobile device. 
B. Wizard-based Approach 
In this approach, end-users can create and customize 
applications by creating forms and representing dialogues that 
are needed to be used in user interactions [15][16]. The step-
by-step dialogue sequence and appropriate forms to provide at 
each step can be specified in the application definition. The 
wizard-based approach relatively does not need users to 
understand complex notations and technical factors. However, 
this approach requires careful modeling of the forms and 
dialogues. The forms need to be modeled such that the users 
can easily understand the desired inputs to be provided at a step. 
In addition, detail conditions and branches of the steps cannot 
be easily programed by end-users. In this approach, some error-
toleration features can be incorporated to ensure the quality of 
data filled in a form. 
C. Spreadsheet-based Approach 
This approach allows end-users to create applications by 
putting values and assigning computations to designated cells 
in a spreadsheet [19]. Since spreadsheets are widely used by 
people, end-users can easily learn how to make applications by 
editing cells in a spreadsheet. In addition, some features to 
improve the dependability of application can be supported by 
adding interactive and dynamic testing capabilities described in 
[19]. However, the types of applications that can be developed 
by using this approach are limited to the ones that require 
management and computation of data in a tabular form. In 
addition, computational rules are normally hidden behind the

Finding appropriate storyboards to reuse is crucial to 
improve the reusability of service compositions. The survey 
result shown in Fig. 5(c) proves that our approach helped the 
users to find and access useful storyboards to reuse. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed the storyboard-based end-user 
mobile application authoring method. The main goal of our 
approach is to allow end-users, who do not have sophisticated 
technical knowledge about developing mobile applications, to 
easily create and customize those applications. We identified 
three essential requirements (usability, efficiency, and 
reusability) of mobile application authoring for end-users to 
successfully represent their task goals and required contexts in 
an application description. 
Our task-oriented storyboard approach provides an 
environment in which end-users can develop mobile 
applications without having technical knowledge. Users can 
visually browse through existing storyboard templates by 
controlling multi-dimensional aspects, and easily extend and 
customize them to generate mobile applications to achieve their 
computational goals. By using our tool, users can represent 
compound scenes and essential control structures that are 
effective to manage and dynamically instantiate storyboards 
according to the changes of environmental conditions and user 
requirements. 
We are currently in progress on testing our application 
authoring tool by applying it to the public application domains 
in our campus and conducting a research to make the 
application authoring more evolvable by accepting and 
reflecting feedbacks from end-users. The accumulated 
feedbacks are analyzed in spatial, temporal, personal, and 
social perspectives. These can be automatically reflected in 
selecting or composing unit tasks and services for application 
authoring.
