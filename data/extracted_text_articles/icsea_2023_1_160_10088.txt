Abstract—Business leaders and scholars struggle to separate 
Business Ecosystem (BE), Digital Ecosystem (DE), Digital 
Platform Ecosystem (DPE), and Innovation Ecosystem (IE). 
Uncertain ecosystem definitions affect business performance, 
innovation, and decisions. The objective of this paper is to conduct 
a systematic literature review of ecosystem and its dimensions in 
order to achieve clarity and precision about the definition of the 
concept.  Snowball technique was used to identify relevant articles 
and mining techniques to examine how ecosystems have been 
defined. The results of the review revealed different meanings of 
digital ecosystems, but key similarities were identified.    
Keywords-ecosystems; digital ecosystems; business ecosystems; 
innovation platforms; business innovation; systematic literature 
review. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The term ecosystem is a set of actors that includes a focal 
firm and other participants who share the same vision of value 
creation and are willing to work together through multi-lateral 
co-specializations 
under 
mutually 
agreed 
governance 
mechanisms [9]. The use of the term ‘ecosystem’ has increased 
in frequency as it entered the lexicon of technological and 
commercial companies; the concept of which can include 
different forms of associations of organizations like platforms, 
clusters, networks, and incubators [4]. Within the specific 
context of innovation, ecosystems refer to a complex and 
interconnected network that collaborate and interact with each 
other to drive innovation through the creation of new products, 
services, or solutions.  
The terms Business Ecosystem (BE), Digital Ecosystem 
(DE), Digital Platform Ecosystem (DPE), and Innovation 
Ecosystem (IE) are often used interchangeably. These terms 
generally refer to the system that is in place for innovation in a 
business company to be created or developed [21]. However, 
these terms pertain to different aspects of ecosystem.   
Unclear ecosystem definitions can affect the performance, 
innovation, and decisions of businesses. Having multiple 
definitions of a concept within a business company can lead to 
confusion and misalignment among employees, hindering 
effective communication and decision-making. It can also 
result in inconsistent implementation of strategies or objectives, 
impacting the company's overall efficiency and performance. 
To address this problem, this research will attempt to 
examine how the concept ecosystem and its dimensions have 
been defined using previous research studies. Specific focus 
will be given to the business setting, where the concept of 
digital ecosystem is necessary for competitive advantage and 
sustainability [14].      
The research questions of the study are the following: 1. 
How has ecosystem been defined in business? and 2. What are 
the core similarities of the different terms that have been used 
to define ecosystem in business? These two research questions 
served as the basis that grounds this study.     
The purpose of this research is to conduct a Systematic 
Literature Review (SLR) of ecosystem and its dimensions in 
order to achieve clarity and precision about the definition of the 
concept. Through this SLR, core similarities about the different 
definitions of ecosystem in the business setting can be 
identified.    
This research is limited by the approach of SLR. The quality 
of SLR is dependent on the quality of the studies included. If 
the studies included have flaws and biases in their 
methodology, these issues may carry over to the SLR itself. 
Moreover, because of the heterogeneity of studies included in 
SLR, the methods, populations, and outcomes can vary, making 
the process of synthesizing and drawing clear conclusions 
challenging.  
The structure of the paper will include several sections that 
will cover the entire study. Section II will cover the 
methodology of the SLR. Section III will present the different 
definitions and dimensions of ecosystem based on the SLR. 
Section IV will present the conclusions and future work 
recommendations.   
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
The methodology of the study will be informed by SLR. 
Systematic literature reviews aim to provide a comprehensive 
summary of existing research on a specific topic [20]. This 
comprehensive summary can be instrumental in helping other 
researchers and decision-makers acquire a deeper 
understanding of the current state of knowledge in a particular 
area of topic. The selection of SLR as a methodology was 
appropriate because the current study aims to examine how 
ecosystem and its related terms have been defined by previous 
researchers. Through this information, the researcher will be 
able to have a more precise definition of the core 
characteristics of this term. 
The objective of this SLR is to examine the different 
definitions that have been made to define ecosystem and its 
other related terms. This SLR can be instrumental in the 
determination of themes or patterns from previous research that 
101

can lead to a deeper and more precise understanding of the 
concept of ecosystem. This review can identify primary studies 
that focus on different definitions of the ecosystem, how it can 
be clarified and how it can be applied inside organizations. The 
review will also focus on key differentiations that can help in 
the understanding of the multi-dimensional nature of the 
concept of ecosystems.   
A. Search Strategies 
The databases considered in the study are listed below:  
● 
ACM Digital Library (see Table 1) 
● 
IEEE Xplore (see Table 1) 
● 
ScienceDirect – Elsevier (see Table 1) 
Many different terms were created to guarantee that 
important information would not be excluded when querying 
different search engines and databases. As a result, four search 
strings were created: 
1. 
“Innovation” 
2. 
“Decentralized Innovation” or “Regional Innovation” 
3. 
“Regional Innovation Systems” and “Regional 
Innovations” 
4. 
“Digital Business Strategy” 
Within the search, the criteria below were applied in each 
database:  
● 
Articles published after 2015 for qualitative analysis  
● 
Studies that are published in the English language 
● 
Studies that are available online 
● 
Studies not based on research that express only the 
official opinions of governments and field experts 
●

B. Studies Selection Process 
In the process of selecting information from the databases, 
the search strings were used separately on each database, all 
grouped later using Zotero software to adjust duplication and 
mine references, using a snowball approach. The searches were 
performed for articles not older than 2015. Table 1 shows the 
number of studies found on each database. 
A total of 83 primary studies were selected, supplemented 
by adopting backward snowballing [19]. In snowballing, 
additional papers are identified either from the paper’s 
reference list (backward snowballing), or from the citations to 
that paper (forward snowballing). As a result, an additional two 
primary studies were identified from backward snowballing, 
increasing the final tally to 85.

C. Quality Assessment 
For quality and quantitative assessment, six questions were 
used to help in the quality assessment of the SLR. The questions 
are: 
1. 
Does the study provide a definition of ecosystem or its 
related terms?  
2.

DEFINITIONS & DIMENSIONS OF 
ECOSYSTEMS  
In the context of ecosystem research, our systematic 
literature review has not only provided valuable insights into 
the various definitions and dimensions of ecosystems in the 
business setting but has also laid the foundation for future 
investigations, which may explore barriers to ecosystem 
adoption, the potential for establishing a culture of innovation 
collaboration, and a deeper understanding of the components 
essential for the functionality of ecosystems in diverse 
organizational contexts. 
A. Definitions 
Ecosystems, derived from the field of biology, pertain to 
collections of mutually reliant entities. Complementarities are a 
necessary condition for their functioning, as they must be 
present in both the consuming and production domains. 
Ecosystems inside organizations undergo changes as partners 
engage, disengage, allocate investments, or redirect their 
efforts. The promotion of a diversified environment has the 
potential to provide useful knowledge and facilitate accelerated 
learning [18]. 
Business ecosystems refer to “a distinctive organizational 
form consisting of members co-evolving their capabilities and 
aligning themselves with a common interest” [13]. In another 
research, business ecosystem has been defined as a group of 
actors who are economically connected to each other in order 
to produce valuable goods and services to customers [22].  
The term digital ecosystem has been defined in terms of 
being a virtual environment that consists of various digital 
entities such as software applications, hardware, and related 
processes [12]. Another definition of digital ecosystem focuses 
102

on the interconnectedness of different businesses with shared 
interest in order to utilize digital technology in order to generate 
products or services [3].  
Digital platform ecosystem refers to the context that 
facilitates the configuration of a new model based on the ability 
to combine different processes, technology, actors, and interests 
in order to create new services or products [6]. Another study 
operationalizes the concept in terms of its five key 
characteristics, which include “generativity, convergence, 
share-ability, modularity, multiplicity and sustainable business 
model innovation” [11]. 
Innovation ecosystem pertains to the processes that allow 
the adaptation needed for sustainable transition and 
transformation of a particular context [5]. The term has also 
been defined as the loose connection among different business 
entities that evolve each other’s capabilities based on shared 
technology, knowledge, or skills [8]. 
B. Dimensions 
The scope of ecosystem research is contingent upon the 
chosen unit of analysis. There are three broad categories that 
can be identified: the "business ecosystem," which emphasizes 
the relationship between enterprises and their surrounding 
environment; the "innovation ecosystem," which revolves on 
the concept of innovation and the actors that support it; and the 
"platform ecosystem," which investigates how players organize 
themselves in relation to a platform. Our primary focus will be 
on the examination of innovation ecosystems. 
The concept of an ecosystem may be described as a 
framework that comprises several stakeholders who are crucial 
for the realization of a value proposition [1]. The 
aforementioned interconnections exhibit a state of multilateral 
interdependence, which distinguishes them from conventional 
economic frameworks. 
Ecosystems can be characterized as assemblies of agents 
that possess multilateral, non-generic complementarities, rather 
than being governed in a hierarchical manner [10]. The primary 
area of interest lies in the temporal and causal factors 
contributing to the emergence of ecosystems. 
The concept of business ecosystems centers on the interplay 
between a company and various external entities, such as other 
businesses, institutions, and individuals. These interactions 
have a significant influence on the enterprise itself, as well as 
its consumers and suppliers [15]. 
The concept of innovation ecosystems centers around the 
examination of innovations and its various components and 
complements. It places particular emphasis on the collaborative 
efforts of interdependent actors in the creation of customer-
facing solutions [2]. 
Platform ecosystems consist of both organizational and 
market 
intermediary 
platforms. 
These 
platforms 
are 
characterized by a core platform that is surrounded by 
peripheral companies. These companies are connected through 
shared technologies, which facilitate the process of value co-
creation [16]. 
Platform ecosystems exhibit distinct features in the form of 
intricate 
inter-organizational 
connections, 
resembling 
commercial 
networks. 
These 
connections 
facilitate 
entrepreneurial endeavors and facilitate transactions across 
diverse user groups [7]. In essence, ecosystems encompass 
intricate interdependencies and diverse complementarities, 
presenting different viewpoints on their functioning, be it in the 
realms of business, innovation, or platforms. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The purpose of this research is to conduct a Systematic 
Literature Review (SLR) of ecosystem and its dimensions in 
order to achieve clarity and precision about the definition of the 
concept. Through this SLR, core similarities about the different 
definitions of ecosystem in the business setting can be 
identified. The results of the SLR suggest that the different 
terms highlight themes of interconnectedness of different 
entities and the creation of a new product or services. The 
results also reaffirmed the existence of different dimensions of 
ecosystems.  
Based on the results that were presented, future research 
could further examine the barriers in the adoption or success of 
ecosystems in business setting. Future researchers could also 
explore the question of whether companies can establish a 
culture of innovation collaboration that is independent of their 
core. More detailed information of the components of a well-
functioning ecosystem can also be pursued by future 
researchers.
