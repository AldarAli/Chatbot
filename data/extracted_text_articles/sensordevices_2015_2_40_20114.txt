Abstract— In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the 
use of near-ultraviolet steady state illumination to increase the 
spectral sensitivity of a double a-SiC/Si pi’n/pin photodiode 
beyond the visible spectrum (400 nm-880 nm). The concept is 
extended to implement a 1 by 4 wavelength division 
multiplexer with channel separation in the visible/near 
infrared ranges. The device consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-
Si:H)-n heterostructure, sandwiched between two transparent 
contacts. Optoelectronic characterization of the device is 
presented and shows the feasibility of tailoring the wavelength 
and bandwidth of a polychromatic mixture of different 
wavelengths. Results show that the spectral current under 
steady state ultraviolet irradiation depends strongly on the 
wavelength of the impinging light, and on the background 
intensity and irradiation side allowing controlled high-pass 
filtering properties. If several monochromatic pulsed lights, in 
the visible/ Near infrared (VIS/NIR) range, separately or in a 
polychromatic mixture illuminate the device, data shows that, 
front background enhances the light-to-dark sensitivity of the 
medium, long and infrared wavelength channels, and quench 
strongly the low wavelengths channels. Back background has 
the opposite behavior; it enhances only channel magnitude in 
short wavelength range and strongly reduces it in the long 
ones. This nonlinearity provides the possibility for selective 
tuning of a specific wavelength. A capacitive optoelectronic 
model supports the experimental results. A numerical 
simulation is presented.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The LED is a very effective lighting technology due to its 
high brightness, long life, energy efficiency, durability, 
affordable cost, optical spectrum and its colour range for 
creative purposes. Their application as communication 
device with a photodiode as receptor, has been used for 
many years in hand held devices, to control televisions and 
other media equipment, and with higher rates between 
computational devices [1]. This communication path has 
been employed in the near infra-red (NIR) range, but due to 
the increasing LED lighting in homes and offices, the idea to 
use them for visible light communications (VLC) has come 
up recently. Newly developed technologies, for infrared 
telecommunication systems, allow increase of capacity, 
distance, and functionality, leading to the design of new 
reconfigurable active filter [2], [3], [4]. To enhance the 
transmission capacity and the application flexibility of 
optical communication, efforts have to be considered, 
namely 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
Wavelength 
Division 
Multiplexer (WDM) based on a-SiC:H light controlled 
filters, when different visible signals are encoded in the same 
optical transmission path [5]. They can be used to achieve 
different filtering processes, such 
as: amplification, 
switching, and wavelength conversion.  
In this paper, it is demonstrated that the same a-SiC:H 
device under front and back controlled near ultraviolet 
optical bias acts as a reconfigurable active filter in the visible 
and near infrared ranges, making the bridge between the 
infrared and the red spectral ranges. In consequence, 
bridging the visible spectrum to the telecom gap offers the 
opportunity to provide alternative and additional low cost 
services to improve operative production processes in office, 
home and automotive networks.  
In Section I, an introduction is given and in Section II, 
some experimental results are presented. In Section III, the 
bias controlled selector is analyzed and in Section IV, the 
Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) based on SiC 
technology is described. In Section V, the optoelectronic 
model gives insight the physics of the device and finally in 
Section VI, the conclusions are presented.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
A. Device configuration  
The light tunable filter is realized by using a double 
pi’n/pin a-SiC:H photodetector produced by Plasma 
Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD).

front and back biased optical gating elements as depicted in 
Figure 1.  
The active device consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-
Si:H)-n heterostructure with low conductivity doped layers.

The combined optical signal (multiplexed signal; MUX) 
is analyzed by reading out the generated photocurrent under 
negative applied voltage (-8V), without and with near 
ultraviolet background (Background=390 nm) and different 
intensities, applied either from the front (F) or the back (B) 
sides. The device operates within the visible range using as 
input color channels the square wave modulated low power 
light supplied by near-infrared/visible (VIS/NIR) LEDs.In 
Figure 2a, the 524 nm input channel is displayed under front, 
back and without UV irradiation. The arrows indicate the 
enhancement (solid line) or quenching (dot line) of the dark 
signal, respectively under front and back irradiation. In 
Figure 2b, the polychromatic mixture of four different input 
channels (400 nm, 524 nm, 697nm and 850 nm) under front 
and back 2800 µWcm-2 irradiation, is displayed. At the top, 
the input channels wavelengths and their bit sequences guide 
the eyes.

The spectral sensitivity was tested through spectral 
response measurements [8] without and under 390 nm front 
and back backgrounds of variable intensities. The spectral

In Figure 3, the spectral gain (α) is displayed under 
steady state irradiations. In Figure 3a, the light was applied 
from the front (F) and in Figure 3b, the irradiation occurs 
from the back side (B). The background intensity () was 
changed between 5µWcm-2 and 3800 µWcm-2.   
Results show that, the optical gains have opposite 
behaviors. Under front irradiation (Figure 3a) and low flux, 
the gain is high in the infrared region, presents a well-
defined peak at 725 nm and strongly quenches in the visible 
range. As the power intensity increases, the peak shifts to the 
visible range and can be deconvoluted into two peaks, one in 
the red range that slightly increases with the power intensity 
of the background and another in the green range that 
strongly increases with the intensity of the ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation. In the blue range, the gain is much lower. This 
shows the controlled high-pass filtering properties of the 
device under different background intensities. Under back 
bias (Figure 3b) the gain in the blue/violet range has a 
maximum near 420 nm that quickly increases with the 
intensity. Moreover, it strongly lowers for wavelengths 
higher than 450 nm, acting as a short-pass filter. Thus, back 
irradiation, tunes the violet/blue region of the visible 
spectrum whatever the flux intensity, while front irradiation, 
depending on the background intensity, selects the infrared 
or the visible spectral ranges. Here, low fluxes select the near 
infrared region and cuts the visible one, the reddish part of 
the spectrum is selected at medium fluxes, and high fluxes 
tune the red/green ranges with different gains.  
 
B. Nonlinear spectral gain 
 
To analyze the effect of the background intensity in the 
input channels, several monochromatic pulsed lights 
separately (850 nm, 697 nm, 626 nm, 524 nm, 470 nm, 400 
nm; input channels) or combined (MUX signal) illuminated 
the device at 12000 bps [9]. 
Steady state optical bias with different intensities was 
superimposed separately from the front and back sides and 
the photocurrent measured. For each individual channel the 
photocurrent gain under irradiation was determined. In 
Figure 4, these gains are displayed as a function of the 
background lighting under front (Figure 4a) and back (Figure 
4b) irradiation. 
Results show that, even under transient conditions and 
using commercial visible and NIR LEDs, the background 
side and intensity alters the signal magnitude of the input 
channels.

The gain depends mainly on the channel wavelength and 
to some extent on the lighting intensity. Even across narrow 
bandwidths, the photocurrent gains are quite different. This 
nonlinearity allows identification of the different input 
channels in the visible/infrared ranges.

Back irradiation enhances, differently, the input signals 
in the short wavelength range (Figure 5a) while front 
irradiation increases them otherwise in the long wavelength 
range (Figure 5b). This side dependent effect is used to 
enhance or to quench the input signals allowing their 
recognition and providing the possibility for selective tuning 
of the visible and IR input channels.

irradiation and different bit sequences. b) Front and back irradiation and 
two channels (400 nm and 697 nm) with the same bit sequence. 
Results show that, the background side alters the form of 
the MUX signal, enhancing or quenching different spectral 
ranges. In Figure 6a all the on/off states are possible so, 
without optical bias, 24 ordered levels are detected and 
correspond to all the possible combinations of the on/off 
states. Under, either front or back irradiation, each of those 
four channels, by turn, are enhanced or quenched differently 
(Figure 6, Table I) resulting in an increase magnitude of 
red/green under front irradiation or of the blue/violet one, 
under back lighting. Since the gain of the four input channels 
is different (αF,B; Table I) this nonlinearity allows identifying 
the different input channels in a large visible/infrared range. 
In Figure 6b, both 400 nm and 697 nm channels have the 
same bit sequence which corresponds to only 23 ordered 
levels, however once the optical gains of both channels are 
quite different under front and back irradiation (Table I) it is 
possible to identify them. Under back irradiation the MUX

signal receive its main contribution from the 400 nm channel 
while under front irradiation it is mainly weighed buy the 
long wavelength channels. By comparing front and back 
irradiation is possible to decode the transmitted information. 
Under front irradiation, near-UV radiation is absorbed at 
the beginning of the front diode and, due to the self-bias 
effect, increases the electric field at the back diode where the 
red/infrared incoming photons (see Figure 1) are absorbed 
accordingly to their wavelengths (see Figure 3) resulting in 
an increased collection.  Under back irradiation the electric 
field decreases mainly at the back i-n interface enhancing the 
electric field at the front diode quenching it at the back one. 
This leads to an increased collection of the violet/blue input 
signals. 
So, by switching between front to back irradiation the 
photonic function is modified from a long- to a short-pass 
filter allowing, alternately selecting the red/infrared channels 
or the blue and violet ones, thus, making the bridge between 
the visible and the infrared regions.

OPTOELECTRONIC MODEL  
Based 
on 
the 
experimental 
results 
and 
device 
configuration a two connected phototransistors model 
(Figure 7a), made out of a short- and a long-pass filter was 
developed [5] and upgraded to include several input 
channels. The ac circuit representation is displayed in Figure 
7b and is supported by the complete dynamical large signal 
Ebers-Moll model with series resistances and capacities. The 
charge stored in the space-charge layers is modelled by the 
capacitor C1 and C2. R1 and R2 model the dynamical 
resistances of the internal and back junctions under different 
dc bias conditions. The operation is based upon the 
following strategic principle: the flow of current through the 
resistor connecting the two transistor bases is proportional to 
the difference in the voltages across both capacitors (charge 
storage buckets). The modified electrical model developed is 
the key of this strategic operation principle. Two optical gate 
connections ascribed to the different light penetration depths 
across the front (Q1) and back (Q2) phototransistors were 
considered to allow independent blue (I1), red/infrared (I2) 
and green (I3, I4) channels transmission. Four square-wave 
current sources with different intensities are used; two of 
them, I1 and I2, with different frequencies to simulate the 
input blue and red channels and the other two, I3 and I4, with 
the same frequency but different intensities, to simulate the 
green channel due to its asymmetrical absorption across both 
front and back phototransistors. 
In Figure 7c, the block diagram of the optoelectronic 
state model is displayed. The resistors (R1, R2) and 
capacitors 
(C1, 
C2) 
synthesize 
the 
desired 
filter 
characteristics. The input signals, IR,R,G,B,V model the input 
channels and i(t) the output signal. The amplifying elements, 
1 and 2 are linear combinations of the optical gains of each 
impinging channel, respectively into the front and back 
phototransistors and account for the enhancement or 
quenching of the channels (Figure 3) due to the steady state 
irradiation. Under front irradiation we have: 2>>1 and 
under back irradiation 1>>2. This affects the reverse photo 
capacitances, (α1,2/C1,2) that determine the influence of the 
system input on the state change.

A good fitting between experimental and simulated 
results was achieved. The plots show the ability of the 
presented model to simulate the sensitivity behavior of the 
proposed system in the visible/infrared spectral ranges. The 
optoelectronic model with light biasing control has proven to 
be a good tool to design optical filters. Furthermore, this 
model allows for extracting theoretical parameters by fitting 
the model to the measured data (internal resistors and 
capacitors). Under back irradiation higher values of C2 were 
obtained confirming the capacitive effect of the near-UV 
radiation on the device that increases the charge stored in the 
space charge layers of the back optical gate of Q2 modelled 
by C2.

CONCLUSIONS  
We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the use 
of near-ultraviolet steady state illumination to increase the 
spectral sensitivity of a double a-SiC/Si pi’n/pin photodiode 
beyond the visible spectrum (400 nm-880 nm). The concept 
is extended to implement a 1 by 4 wavelength division 
multiplexer with channel separation in the visible/near 
infrared ranges.  
Results show that, the pi´n/pin multilayered structure 
becomes reconfigurable under front and back irradiation, 
acting as data selector in the VIS/NIR ranges. The device 
performs WDM optoelectronic logic functions providing 
photonic functions such as signal amplification, filtering and 
switching. The opto-electrical model with light biasing 
control has proven to be a good tool to design optical filters 
in the VIS/NIR. An optoelectronic model was presented and 
proven to be a good tool to design optical filters in the 
VIS/NIR range.
