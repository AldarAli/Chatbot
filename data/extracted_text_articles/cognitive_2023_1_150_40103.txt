Abstract— The aim of this study was to investigate the innate 
vs. acquired (cultural) aspects of affective empathy and 
emotional regulation. Volunteers watched videos with a virtual 
reality (VR) headset, triggering negative emotions, while their 
emotional response were measured by electroencephalographic 
evoked potentials (EEG). The effect of empathic touch (placing 
the hand on the back) on emotion regulation was measured. 
This international study allowed us to compare the regulation 
of emotions between people living in Japan and those living in 
France.  
Keywords-Touching care; Electroencephalography (EEG); 
Fear; Nursing. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Touch plays a key role in interpersonal emotional 
regulation. For instance, touch conveys a sense of 
strengthened bonds between intimate partners that enhances 
affect and well-being [1]. Similarly, it plays a crucial role in 
maternal-child bonds, and promotes the child’s ability to 
self-regulate [2]. 
Comforting touch involves contact distress-alleviating 
behaviors of an observer towards the suffering of a target 
[3]. Indeed, across different cultures, social touch is used to 
alleviate distress: the interaction between the observation-
execution network and emotion regulation network may 
contribute to pain reduction during social touch [4]. 
However, is this effect innate, or the outcome of 
education and cultural biases? The aim of this study is to 
measure the effect of empathy on the regulation of emotions. 
Volunteers watched videos with a virtual reality headset, 
triggering negative emotions, while their emotional response 
were 
measured 
by 
electroencephalographic 
evoked 
potentials (EEG). In order to answer this question, we 
compared the regulation of emotions between people living 
in Japan and those living in France (to identify the common 
points and the differences). 
Section II introduces experimental conditions, data 
collection, and analysis method. Section III shows 
experimental results. In Section IV, we discuss the results 
and conclude the paper. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHOD 
The experiment was approved by the ethics committee 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Electro-Communications, 
and 
conducted in accordance with the approval research 
procedure, the relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed 
consent was obtained from all subjects. 
We used three VR videos, and two touching conditions 
(touching/no touching). The three VR videos were: 
1) a horror video [5] 
2) a roller coaster perspective movie [6] 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=injtBhJCNdA 
3) a natural water fall movie for the control condition (240 
sec. from the beginning) [7] 
We used main part of the movie and removed the title and 
opening and so forth. The horror movie lasts 324 seconds, 
and the roller coaster movie lasts 204 seconds. The order of 
the VR movie was randomly selected. 
The touching carer was standing behind the subject. We 
asked the subjects not to control evoked emotions during 
watching the movie. We used two PCs, one to present the 
VR video, and another one to record EEG and present 
instructions.

After watching each VR movie, the subject scored how 
scared during touching condition comparing to no touching 
condition on a scale of 1 to 5 (1: strongly scared, 3: no 
difference, 5: no scared). Then the subject took a rest for 
more than 30 seconds and continued the experiment. 
A. Data collection: Japanese subjects 
We recruited seven healthy males (20s-40s) for this 
experiment.  
The touching condition was changed randomly every 
five seconds and displayed to the monitor. The carer 
watched the monitor and conducted touching. 
The experimental room was air conditioned and 
ventilated to prevent COVID-19. VR headset (Dell Visor 
VRP100) was connected to the display PC. 
The subject put on EEG cap, then wore the VR headset. 
The EEG is Polymate Pro MP6100 manufactured by Miyuki 
Giken Co., Ltd. 
We used 17 electrodes placed on F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, 
O1, O2, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, Fz, Cz, and Pz. Each 
electrode was put so that the impedance was smaller than 
80kΩ. The sampling rate was 1,000Hz. We recorded 30 
seconds EEG in relaxed and eyes closed condition before 
the experiment. We recorded the synchronous signal of the 
touching condition and audio signal of the VR movie, as 
well as EEG signal to synchronize EEG and movie. 
B. Data collection: French subjects 
We recruited seven healthy subjects (20s-50s / 2 women 
and 5 males) for this experiment.  
The touching condition was changed randomly every 
120 seconds. Our experiments in Japan showed startle 
responses in some subjects when the carer touched. 
Although the responses are removed by segmentation, we 
used a different touch time for the experiment in France to 
relax the startle responses. The experiment instructed the 
carer about when to touch or stop touching.  
VR headset (Occulus Rift S) was connected to the 
display PC. 
The subject put on EEG cap, then wore the VR headset. 
The EEG is Enobio 8 manufactured by Neuroelectrics. 
We used 8 electrodes placed on F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, 
Oz, Fpz and 3 accelerometer channels (X Y, Z). Each 
electrode was put so that the EEG Quality Index was 
smaller than 0.5. The sampling rate was 500Hz (and 100Hz 
for accelerometer). We recorded 60 seconds EEG in eyes 
closed condition before the experiment. We recorded the 
synchronous signal of the touching condition as well as 
EEG signal to synchronize EEG and touching conditions. 
C. EEG Analysis 
We define the parts of scalp area as follows: 
• 
Frontal: (F3, F4, F7, F8, Fz); 
• 
Central: (C3, C4, Cz); and 
• 
Parietal(/occipital) : (P3, P4, O1, O2, P7, P8, 
Pz).  
The frequency bands are defined as δ: 2-4Hz, θ: 4-6Hz, 
α: 6-12Hz, β: 12-30Hz, and γ: 30-40Hz.  
For prepossessing, we removed artifacts from EEG. If the 
instantaneous amplitude is greater than 200μV, we removed 
0.25 seconds of signal before and after the point. We 
analyzed signal after 0.5 seconds from the onset of the 
recording or condition.  
D. PSD 
We segmented EEG signals by conditions, then 
performed the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and obtained 
the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) values for each area, 
condition, and frequency band.  
For each frequency band, channel, and condition, we 
obtained the difference of PSD logarithm from the baseline 
state. We used EEG during watching the water fall movie 
and no touching condition as the baseline state. 
 
PSDdiff = log(target PSD ) - log(baseline PSD) 
E. PSD correlations 
For each frequency band, and area, we estimated the 
correlation coefficient between the logarithm of PSD value 
and the subjectivity scared score. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
The section shows our experimental results. 
A. Correlation between PSD and subjective fear scores 
The tables below report the correlation of PSD and 
subjective fear reports from Japanese (Table 1) and French 
(Table 2) subjects. Only the French subjects showed a 
significant anticorrelation between subjective fear report 
and parietal alpha activity.

B. Correlation between PSD and subjective fear scores, 
Japanese subjects 
Tables III-VII show the PSD differences between the 
three conditions (horror movie, roller coaster, and relaxing 
waterfall), with or without touch. The water fall condition 
without touch was used as a reference baseline (hence its 
difference is null). The horror condition is correlated with a 
significant broadband increase of EEG activity in frontal 
and parietal areas. Similarly, there is a general (non-
significant) broadband increase of EEG activity in the touch 
vs. no touch condition. The result of a T-test comparing 
touch vs. no-touch condition is reported in the last column.

C. Correlation between PSD and subjective fear scores, 
French subjects 
Tables VII-XII show the PSD differences between the 
three conditions (horror movie, roller coaster, and relaxing 
waterfall), with or without touch. The water fall condition 
without touch was used as a reference baseline (hence its 
difference is null). As in the Japanese database, the horror 
condition is correlated with a broadband increase of EEG 
activity in frontal and parietal areas, however this increase is 
non-significant, and not present in the delta range. Similarly, 
there is a general and broadband increase of EEG activity in 
the touch vs. no touch condition, significant in the parietal 
area for the roller coaster condition. The result of a T-test 
comparing touch vs. no-touch condition is reported in the 
last column.

CONCLUSION 
In both populations, we can observe similarities in the 
neural correlates of fear emotional regulation: 
• 
In both populations of subject, a broadband 
increase of EEG activity is observed in the 
touch vs. non touch condition.  
• 
More specifically, both Japanese and French 
subjects had a significant δ range activity 
increase in the frontal and central areas in touch 
condition, during the horror video (which was 
the most fearful stimulus). 
Increased EEG activity in the touch condition could be a 
correlated of improved emotional regulation. For instance, 
emotional regulation in expert Zen meditators was 
associated with a similar phenomenon [8]. Furthermore, and 
more specifically, the observed in δ range increase frontal 
and central area is a known correlate of emotional 
regulation: it could reflect the inhibition exerted by the 
prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex over 
emotionally related areas [9]. This tends to confirm a cross-
cultural positive effect of touching care on emotional 
regulation, 
despite 
potential 
differences 
in 
cultural 
representations about body contact and intimacy. 
Between the two populations, we can observe 
differences in the neural correlates of fear emotional 
regulation: 
• 
In the Japanese population, no significant 
difference is found in specific areas and 
frequency ranges when comparing touch vs. 
non touch cognition. In the French population, 
several areas presented significant changes 
between those conditions. 
• 
In the French population only, parietal α 
activity was anti-correlated with subjective 
reports of fear. Note that parietal α is associated 
with the activity of the default mode network, 
which increases in relaxed state [10]. 
These differences could be attributed to cultural 
specificities in emotional regulation strategies. Indeed, 
previous studies have shown that Japanese subjects 
experience less intense fear reactions than French subjects 
[11]. Note that there is also a slight difference in the way the 
touching care stimulus was applied, which may bias these 
results. The French subjects had 2 female participants, not 
the Japanese subjects, and the age span was slightly larger; 
which could also have introduced some bias.
