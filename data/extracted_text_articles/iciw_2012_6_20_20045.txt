Abstract—We design an efﬁcient and transaction cost reduc-
ing Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction as part of a web service
for the work allocation problem in temporary employment
agencies. In this auction bids are work contracts with multi-
dimensional salaries. To compute the allocation we assume that
every temporary employment worker conveys a utility function
specifying the utility gained from working a given job for a
salary consisting of multiple components. We then embed the
designed mechanism in an updated transaction phase model
describing the repeated allocation of temporary agency workers
to work assignments. We prove that the designed auction
mechanism at the heart of the web service satisﬁes Incentive
Compatibility and Pareto Efﬁciency.

I. INTRODUCTION
The last decades saw a swift and fundamental change
of work and working environments. The number of blue-
collar workers has dramatically fallen while the number
of white-collar workers has simultaneously increased. This
change was driven by the so-called “3-sector-hypothesis” or
“Petty’s law” [1]. As a result, many aspects of the working
environment became less rigid and numerous employment
models have evolved. One of the most successful novel
models is that of temporal employment with about 9.5
million employees and a market of more than US$ 340
billion worldwide [2, pp. 11].
Competition pressure creates a sustained impetus for
businesses to lower labor costs, which can be achieved in
two ways. These costs can be lowered by paying lower
wages and salaries or by reducing superﬂuous transaction
costs [3]–[5]. Taking the ﬁrst route leads to disappointed and
unmotivated employees [6]–[8]; thus, we will here focus on
the second way instead. Electronic markets are an adequate
and a well-established option to reduce transaction costs [9].
During the last two decades electronic markets for com-
modities were thoroughly investigated and practical business
applications (e.g., eBay and Amazon) ﬂourished. Today such
electronic markets often incorporate web services [10]–[13],
which have also attracted scientiﬁc interest on a fundamental
level [14].
Figure 1.
Transaction phases according to [18]
By contrast, widespread highly automated electronic la-
bor markets failed so far to materialize. First, unlike well
standardized commodities, labor can only imperfectly be
described [15, pp. 365]. This imperfect description refers to
the description of job demands, to employee characteristics
and to job performance. The difﬁculty in describing job
performance due to the complexity of the person-situation
interaction has been thoroughly investigated; cf. [16], [17].
Electronic markets for only imperfectly describable goods
and services are scarce in the real world; possibly partly
due to the little scientiﬁc interest they received [18]. Thus
e-business applications and web services for such markets
have received little attention in the literature.
Second, the utility (function) of work is very complex
[19, p. 85] and varies individually. An automated labor
market would require market players to specify a priori
utility functions (or a similar encoding of personal prefer-
ences) specifying preferences for an overwhelming number
of possibilities enabling agents to act (search and negotiate)
on their behalf.
As a result, today we either ﬁnd well described theo-
retical formal models, which are not quite applicable to
real world situations, see further Section II, or we ﬁnd
matching algorithms aiding the search for a new job or a
new employee [20]. These matching algorithms all address
the information phase of a transaction, further transaction
phases cannot be supported by such algorithms, see Figure 1.
A further automation of electronic labor markets should
also address other transaction phases. One such important
step would be the development of an efﬁcient allocation
algorithm that also computes salaries based on individual
and private preferences of market players.

The main contribution of this paper is a web service based
application running a novel algorithm (based on a Vickrey
Clarke Groves auction [21]–[23]) that matches workers and
employers efﬁciently and that computes salaries consisting
of multiple components. In more detail, we consider a
Temporary Employment Agency (TEA) that employs Tem-
porary Agency Workers (TAWs) and in turn lends them to
businesses for a period of time. We develop a Vickrey Clarke
and Groves (VCG) mechanism that allows every TAW and
every business representative to specify multi-dimensional
utility functions. So, in this auction bids and payments are
multi-dimensional. To the best of the authors knowledge
such a mechanism has never been described in the literature
before.
A. Extended Goal Statement
Summing up we want to develop a web service based ap-
plication, which uses a novel allocation mechanism, thereby
covering at least the ﬁrst two transaction phases. The aim is
that this system satisﬁes several objectives:
1) Reduce transaction costs.
2) Allocate TAWs to businesses in a Pareto Efﬁcient way,
i.e., there is no other way to make no bidder worse
off and one better off.
3) Ensure bidders bid their true valuations, i.e., the auc-
tion is Incentive Compatible.
4) Enable TAWs to inﬂuence their work environment,
thereby increasing job engagement and job satisfaction
and as a result create added value for businesses [24].
5) Create a work environment that is perceived to be
fairer by stakeholders and the general public. Thus
improving the social standing of temporary agency
workers and temporary work as a whole.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Next,
we consider related work and the real-world economic
background. Then, we present the auction model, followed
by an evaluation via mathematical proofs for Incentive Com-
patibility and Pareto Efﬁciency of the auction and we give a
simple example. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of
the model, its limitations and an outlook concerning future
work.
II. REAL-WORLD ECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND
RELATED WORK
We now turn to discussing related work.
A. State of the Art in Electronic Negotiations and E-HRM
Being forecast about three decades ago in [25], electronic
negotiations have been a hot topic in computer science,
so much so that now many well researched overviews
exist [26]–[30]. However, the maximal level of automation
attainable is controversial. We here exhibit the classiﬁcation
of approaches given in [31].
Figure 2.
Classiﬁcation of electronic negotiations [31]
The landscape of scientiﬁc research on electronic negoti-
ations is mainly populated by studies of the process and the
structure of negotiations whereas issues located in the lower
left in Figure 2 have received considerably less attention
[31].
The models of electronic negotiations can be classiﬁed as
game-theoretic, heuristic or argumentation-based [32]. The
game-theoretic approach investigates optimal strategies via
the analysis of the equilibrium conditions dating back to the
seminal work of Nash [33]. Game-theoretic models are well
studied, often allowing mathematically elegant investiga-
tions, but their potential in practical applications suffers from
the assumptions of perfect rationality, unlimited resources
and perfect information [32], [34]. Heuristic approaches
reject the assumption of unlimited (computing) resources
and/or perfect rationality and rather employ thumb rules,
see for example [35]. Automated negotiation models based
on heuristic approaches have to be intensively evaluated,
normally via simulations and/or empirical analysis [32, p.
210]. In argumentation-based negotiations (ABN), agents
have the ability to reason their positions. When the negoti-
ation partner is persuaded, who will change her negotiation
position, exemplary we mention the system PERSUADER
[36].
Related, but not directly relevant, are ongoing develop-
ments in e-recruiting and e-HRM, which have been recently
surveyed respectively in [37, pp. 231-232] and [38]–[41].

B. Imperfect Information about the Negotiation Item
In [18], 96 electronic negotiation models were studied.
Almost all negotiation models (94 percent) assumed imper-
fect information about the negotiation partner(s). Research
on imperfectly described environments and/or negotiation
items is considerably less frequent. Only 8 percent of models
studied considered the problem of imperfect information
concerning the negotiation item, e.g., [42], [43]. Interest-
ingly, one of these models was developed for eHRM [44]
and later extended to FuzzyMAN in [45]. In FuzzyMAN
and the model implemented therein [43] agents’ preferences
regarding the negotiation item are expressed in fuzzy [46]
terms.
Further work dealing with imperfect information about
the negotiation item exists. Different approaches have based
their models on different formalisms: probability [47], [48],
conjoint scheme [48], genetic algorithms [47] and band-
widths [49].
Overall, we want to develop a game-theoretic model
allowing a well-founded evaluation via mathematical proofs.
Any successful real-world implementation of such a model
has to be comprehensible to all stakeholders [50]. Due to
the complex challenges posed by negotiation items that can
only imperfectly be described, we use a well-established
negotiation model of low complexity, i.e., an auction.
C. Auctions
Auctions are one of the oldest (according to ancient Greek
Herodotus, auctions date back to the Babylonians around
500 B.C.) and on the surface simplest form of negotiation.
Today, auctions are the main mean to sell expensive antiques,
U.S. treasury bonds and rights to use the electromagnetic
spectrum for telecommunication purposes. Furthermore, nu-
merous commodity markets rely on auctions [Tsukiji ﬁsh
market (Tokyo, Japan), the Bloemenveiling ﬂower auction
(Aalsmeer, The Netherlands)].
Over the centuries, many auction formats have evolved
(ﬁrst price, second price, open, sealed-bid, with deadline,
without ﬁxed deadline, etc.). Different formats were de-
signed to satisfy a variety of properties such as revenue
maximization, incentive compatibility and efﬁciency max-
imization. Further auction formats were developed, which
allow the sale of multiple items at the same time, while
other formats discourage collusion and snapping.
More generally, an auction can be understood as a mech-
anism, which takes as input a set of preferences and outputs
an allocation of resources. The art of ensuring that the
outcome has desirable properties is known as Mechanism
Design (MD) [34]. One branch of MD investigates the
design of auctions [51]–[53] to allocate resources to bidders
in exchange for a payment.
A Vickrey auction is a sealed-bid second price auction.
That is, the auction item is allocated to the highest bidder,
who pays the second highest bid submitted. Such an auction
satisﬁes Individual Rationality, Pareto Efﬁciency and Incen-
tive Compatibility. A Vickrey Clarke Groves (VCG) auction
[21]–[23] extends a Vickrey auction allowing multiple items
to be auctioned off simultaneously by a single bid taker.
Crucially, a VCG auction also satisﬁes these three properties.
Even so, VCG auctions are not always an appropriate
mechanism, see for instance [54], [55] and for an overview
[56].
Multi-dimensional extensions of classical auctions have
been studied. This multi-dimensionality either refers to pri-
vate valuations (or signals thereof) [57] or to the auction
item [58]–[62]. It is well known that in case a public multi-
attribute function is used by all participants of an English
auction, then such a multi-dimensional auction is equivalent
to a one-dimensional auction.
A VCG auction with multi-dimensional bids was devel-
oped in [63] by the authors of this paper. In [63] we assumed
that all bids were evaluated with respect to the multi-
dimensional utility function of the center (TEA). We here
build on this work by designing a VCG auction with multiple
bidders and multiple bid takers, which all have their own
multi-dimensional utility function. The allocation and the
payment rule only depend on these functions, in particular
they are independent of the TEA’s utility function. Results
reported in [27] suggest that multi-dimensional auctions
yield more utility for the bid taker.
How far, or even if, game theoretic results regarding multi-
dimensional prices, respectively multi-dimensional auctions,
are transferable to the real world has been investigated in
[64], [65].
D. The Business Model of Temporary Employment Agencies
Temporary employment agencies have become a large-
scale form of labor market intermediary, acquiring the status
of a broker of ﬂexibility at both the micro- and the macro-
level [66]. They meet the needs of enterprises to ﬂexibly
increase or decrease the size of their workforce, while
ensuring for their workers considerable security in terms
of job opportunities and employment standards, including
pay, working time and training [2, pp. 7, pp. 26]. The
business model can be characterized by a triangle. In one
corner is the TEA, which has a labor contract with a TAW.
Crucially this contract contains a clause granting the TEA
the managerial authority to order a TAW to work at (and
under the supervision) of one of its clients.
Furthermore, the TEA has business to business (b2b) con-
tracts with customers specifying commercial details of the
temporal assignment of TAWs. In general, a TAW working
at (and under the supervision of) a client of a TEA and
this client do not enter a contract. For the above auction we
can hence assume that every participating TAW has a valid
work contract with the TEA. Applying the transaction phase
model displayed in Figure 1 to the model we developed here,
we now adapt the realization phase, see Figure 3. Overall,
170

ICIW 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

this yields an adapted model of transaction phases depicted
in Figure 4.
Figure 3.
The adapted realization phase
Figure 4.
The new model of transaction phases
One important reason for businesses to use a TEA as an
intermediary is that the assignment of TAWs may be of
limited or unspeciﬁed duration with no guarantee of con-
tinuation allowing a ﬂexible management of the workforce
to adapt to quickly changing market conditions.
Providing a service the TEA charges a fee, ultimately
paid by its customers and/or the TAWs. This fee (normally
a ﬁxed percentage of the salary) can amount up to 80%
of the net salary (depending on circumstances and national
laws, e.g., taxes and social security contributions) of a
TAW. A considerable part of the operating costs of a TEA
are generated by the labor intensive (and hence costly)
process of matching TAWs to requests for labor. A further
disadvantage shared by TAWs and customers of a TEA is
that the matching of TAWs and requests for labor is done
to best suit the TEAs’ needs. Having no inﬂuence over their
work environment (including salary) TAWs have in general
a lower job engagement, which correlates strongly with
productivity [24], [67]. Furthermore TAWs are typically paid
less than permanent workers doing the same job violating
the principle of same pay for same work causing tensions
in the workforce of the client of the TEA [68].
III. THE AUCTION
We now introduce the auction mechanism.
A. Participants
There are two types of participants. First, any business
that seeks to hire temporary staff from the TEA can take
part. Second, all currently idle TAWs that have a work
contract with the TEA may take part. Unless otherwise
stated, we mean from now by TAW a participating TAW. A
representative of a participating business is from now simply
called employer. Do note that the TAWs are employed by
the TEA. The term employer is chosen here to ease the
understanding and the write-up; see further Section II-D.
To ease the notation, we make the convention that every
employer is looking to ﬁll exactly one full time vacancy
(multiple vacancies at a company are modeled by multiple
employers).
B. Information Phase
During the information phase participants search for po-
tential matches, read background information stored at the
TEA or on the Internet on potential employers (policies,
corporate philosophy and identity) or on TAWs (CV, refer-
ences and possibly a sample of previous work). To predict
future potential job performance of job candidates (TAWs),
employers may carry out e-assessments [69], [70] enhanced
by exchanged emails, interviews conducted via text-based
chat applications and/or (video) calls. Similarly, TAWs may
pick up information crucial for their valuation of future job
assignments. From a formal perspective, the sending and
exchanging of signals, indices and arguments can be seen to
take place to combat the infamous adverse selection problem
[15], [71].
To enhance quality and speed of the search in large
databases, a recommender system [72], [73] and/or a repu-
tation system [74], [75] may be used.
C. Bidding
Let E := {E1, . . . , Ee} be the set of employers seeking
to secure the services of a TAW and let W := {w1, . . . , wt}
be the set of TAWs looking for work. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n let
Mi be a salary component, such as wage per hour, beneﬁts,
sick pay or overtime premiums. Let M = M1 × . . . × Mn
be the set of all contracts consisting of these components.
We deﬁne an additive structure on M by ⊕M × M → M
via addition by component (m1, . . . , mn) ⊕ (k1, . . . , kn) :=
(m1 + k1, . . . , mn + kn).
For 1 ≤ i ≤ t let {Ei1, . . . , Eik(i)} be the set of employers
interested in acquiring the services of TAW wi. Now every
wi ∈ W sends a utility function ui
ir : M → R to employer
Eir detailing how much s/he (dis-)likes to work for Eir,
171
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2012.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-200-4
ICIW 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

if the TAW is sufﬁciently qualiﬁed to perform these jobs.
These utility functions are also communicated to the TEA
and to all other employers. In case TAW wi does not send a
utility function to an employer Eir, the utility function ui
ir
is set to be the zero function. We can hence assume that the
TAWs’ utility functions are functions mapping M ×E → R.
A signiﬁcant proportion of TAWs is low-skilled [2, ta-
ble 3.6 page 19] and might hence require training and/or
decision support tools to construct these utility functions;
see further [76] for one such tool designed for an electronic
labor market. These tools normally use preference elicitation
techniques [77]. Such techniques can go a long way to
aid the understanding and thus acceptance of designed
applications and computer systems [50], [78].
We assume that every employer Ed is risk neutral, fully
rational and the valuation of TAWs and contracts is indepen-
dent of the valuation of other employers. We hence assume
that Ed has a utility function UUd : M ×W → R specifying
how much value a TAW working a certain job for a given
contract brings to employer Ed. We assume furthermore that
these functions are additive, that is UUd is given as a sum
of utility functions, i.e., UUd(m, w) = Ud(m) + Vd(w).
This notion of an additive utility function generalizes the
notion of a quasi-linear utility function to multi-dimensional
prices. Furthermore, we assume that Ud commutes with the
additional structure ⊕.
At this point, every employer has a choice to make based
on the utility functions ui
ir communicated, either to take part
in the following auction and accept the binding outcome or
to drop out and not take part in the auction. For the time
being, we assume, for the sake of a simpler notation, that
no employer drops out. Why an employer might drop out
will be investigated in the section Incentives.
Every employer now makes one sealed bid for each TAW,
from which a not vanishing utility function was received.
That is for 1 ≤ d ≤ e a, in general partial, function bidd :
W → M is communicated to the TEA. These functions are
in general partial because not every w ∈ W communicates
a utility function to all employers.
To ease the notation we make the following convention.
Every partial function bidd is extended to a total function by
setting bidd to zero wherever it was not deﬁned. Furthermore
ui
∅ and bid∅ are set to vanish everywhere.
D. The Allocation
Deﬁnition 1 A function f : {1, . . . , t} → {1, . . . , e}∪{∅}
is called an allocation if and only if f(i) = f(k) implies
that f(i) = f(k) = {∅}. Thus an allocation allocates every
employer (representing a single vacancy) at most one TAW.
The TEA then calculates the allocation f that maximizes
X
1≤l≤t
ul
f(l)(bidf(l)(l))
(1)
under the constraint that for f(l) ̸= ∅ employer Ef(l) has put
in a non-zero bid for TAW wl. The constraint implies that
an employer will never be allocated a TAW wl, for which
this employer has not put in a bid.
For 1 ≤ d ≤ e let fd be the allocation, which maximizes
the sum in Equation 1 and which satisﬁes the constraint in
case that Ed does not enter a single bid (or equivalently Ed
does not take part in the auction).
All participants are then informed of the outcome of the
allocation concerning themselves. So every employer Ed
learns, which TAW (if any) has been allocated to work for
Ed, vice versa for the TAWs. To calculate the salary (in
auction terminology: payment rule) we need to introduce
some notation.
E. Salaries
Deﬁnition 2 For t ∈ N let [t] := {1, . . . , t} and for 1 ≤
l ≤ t put [t − l] := {1, . . . , t} \ {l} and [t − ∅] := [t]. Let
g : X → Y be a function, then the level set of g at level y
is deﬁned as {x ∈ X|g(x) = y}.
For l ∈ [t], xl ∈ R and a utility function Ud : M →
R let ⟨P
l∈[t] xl⟩d be an element in M that minimizes
Ud(⊕l∈[t]ml) = P
l∈[t] Ud(ml) under the condition that for
every l ∈ [t] ml is an element of the level set of ul
fd(l) at
level xl. That is employer Ed gets to pick an element in
all those level sets. Since this expression will later be part
of a salary paid, the employer makes choices suiting best
his/her needs. For x ∈ R, m ∈ M and a utility function
Ud : M → R let x − Ud(m) be an element of the level set
of Ud at level x − Ud(m).
Employer Ed then pays TAW wf −1(d)
Salary(Ed) := −
X
l∈[t−f −1(d)]
uf(l)l(bidf(l)(l))
+ ⟨
X
l∈[t]
ul
fd(l)(bidfd(l)(l))⟩d.
(2)
Do note that the second term in Equation 2 cannot be
inﬂuenced by any bids made by employer Ed, since it only
contains terms that are calculated for an auction, in which
she did not participate. To ease the reading we set Ud(Cd)
to be the utility received from this term.
Note that employer Ed wants to maximize the overall
utility received, which equals
Vd(f −1(d)) +
X
l∈[w−f −1(d)]
ul
f(l)(bidf(l)(l)) − Ud(Cd).
(3)
Any fully rational bidding strategy an employer pursues
will hence only depend on the ﬁrst term in 2 and the TAW
allocated due to our assumptions about UUd (additive and
commuting with addition).
F. Incentives
Theorem 1 The above auction satisﬁes Incentive Com-
patibility and Pareto Efﬁciency.
172

Proof: The main idea in the following proof is to show
the fact that it is in every employers best own interest to
maximize the utility to be distributed. That is, a rational
selﬁsh employer seeks to pursue the common good.
Firstly, we have to prove, that bidding their true valuation
is an ex-post Nash equilibrium for all bidders. That is, even
knowing all other bids, it is for every bidder an optimal
strategy to bid true values. We here mean by true valuation
that bidd satisﬁes Vd(l) = ul
d(bidd(l)) for all l ∈ [t]. So the
employer obtains as much utility from being allocated wl as
the bid for wl by this employer is worth to wl.
Recall that f maximizes the sum in Equation 1. Now if
Vd(l) = ul
d(bidd(l)) for all l ∈ [t], then Equation 1 and
Equation 3 only differ by a constant. So f also maximizes
3 in this case. There is hence no better strategy for employer
Ed than to bid the private true valuations for all TAWs.
Let us now assume for the second part of the proof that
all bidders bid their true valuations (i.e., they all follow
an optimal strategy). Then f maximizes the overall utility
distributed. Hence, allocating more utility to one bidder will
at least make one other bidder lose utility.
In case there is less than full conﬁdence in the TEA
to properly execute the auction and/or to keep information
entered into the system private, an auction issuer [79] can be
used to ensure the proper handling of sensitive information
and to ensure the correct computation of the allocation and
payments.
Example 1 Consider an auction with three employers
{E1, E2, E3}, which have decided to bid for a TAW w1.
Assume furthermore that for the three utility functions
communicated to the employers it holds that ui = u. If
u1(bid1(1)) > u2(bid2(1)) > u3(bid3(1)), then w1 will
work for employer E1 for a salary in the level set of u at
level u(bid2(1)) to be speciﬁed by E1.
From this example, the following observation can be
inferred. If there is only one auction item (i.e., one TAW)
and the TAW is only interested in the salary (i.e., not in the
jobs to do), then the winning bidders bid is of lower utility
(to the bidder and the TAW) than the salary paid.
Do note that the above calculations were all done without
the explicit knowledge of Ud, that is the private valuation
of Ed of multi-dimensional salaries. To actually calculate
the ﬁgure in Equation 2 one needs to know Ud. In one-
dimensional price VCG-auctions all Ud are simply assumed
to be the identity function id : R → R and furthermore
it is assumed that this is public knowledge. It is hence not
surprising, alas not ideal, that the here presented mechanism
cannot do without any knowledge of the Ud. Assuming
that the Ud are known to the TEA or assuming a certain
knowledge of the level sets of the Ud are two ways of solving
this problem (it sufﬁces to know one element in every level
set of the Ud and the level sets containing the Cd).
Observe that in the one-dimensional case the level sets
completely determine the function. Counterintuitively, this
multi-dimensional price auction requires less information
about utility functions on prices than the one-dimensional
counterpart.
By contrast, note that the bidder’s utility from obtaining
an auction item (i.e., a TAW) is revealed through the design
of the mechanism, if the bidder acts rationally.
Finally we have to consider the case of an employer
Ed that is not allocated a TAW. To keep the attractive
properties of Incentive Compatibility and Pareto Efﬁciency,
the payment rule also has to be applied to such an employer.
A payment goes to or comes from the center (i.e., the TEA),
as there was no worker allocated to this employer. The
payment can be calculated and subsequently paid in case
one of the above two conditions on the knowledge of the
Ud is satisﬁed. Note that in case every employer is allocated
a TAW, this issue concerning the payment rule does not
surface.
As we have seen above it makes sense for bidders to
be honest but what about the TAWs? Recall that they also
submitted utility functions; can they obtain an advantage by
not reporting their true valuations? We have already seen in
the above example that misreporting the shape of the utility
functions ui
ir is in general not advantageous.
Recall that for bidders it is rational to bid such that
Vd(l) = ul
d(bidd(l)). So a TAW stands to gain by making
extraordinary high demands. To discourage such behavior
the ui
ir are communicated to all bidders, which have subse-
quently the option to abstain from the auction in case salary
demands are perceived to be too high. An employer not
participating in the auction will look elsewhere for workers.
G. The Algorithmic Complexity of Calculating the Alloca-
tion
The number of complete matchings in a connected com-
plete bipartite graph with independent sets of sizes x ≥ y
is
x!
(x−y)!. So the number of possible allocations with e ≥ t
is
e!
(e−t)!. Hence calculating the allocation f that maximizes
the utility is of high algorithmic complexity [80].
Observe that the problem of calculating this allocation
simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly in case the bipartite graph consists
of several disconnected components. Connected components
of a bipartite graph can be found in linear time. From a
practical point of view, reducing the problem to connected
components of the graph is hence highly desirable. If the
computational complexity of calculating the allocation after
the decomposition into connected components is still too
high for practical purposes, then approximation algorithms
[81], [82] can be used to calculate an allocation that is close
to the efﬁcient allocation.
H. The Aftermath
Consider a TAW allocated to a given employer and recall
that the VCG-mechanism outputs work contracts consisting
of multiple salary components. Possibly there is a contract,
173
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2012.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-200-4
ICIW 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

which both the TAW and the employer prefer to the one
generated by the mechanism. This is in stark contrast to
the one-dimensional case with only one salary component.
There an employer prefers a lower and a TAW a higher
salary. Allowing renegotiations of multi-dimensional salaries
may yield gains for the TAW and the employer (and pos-
sibly the TEA); however, it renders the above mechanism
Incentive Incompatible.
IV. POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS AND FURTHER
APPLICATIONS
Do note that we assumed above that every TAW can only
have one job at the same time. This is surely a sensible
assumption if all jobs are full time jobs. Extending the above
auction to also include part time jobs is possible; one then
has to use multivalued allocations f (instead of functions)
that assign TAWs to (possibly) multiple employers. Again,
this new mechanism does satisfy Incentive Compatibility and
Pareto Efﬁciency. Due to space constraints and our wish not
to overload this paper with notation we will refrain here
from doing so.
Furthermore, it is possible to include externalities in
the mechanism by allowing for the possibility that the
utility functions ud
l depend not only on the job wl will be
working but on the whole allocation f. For example this
enables a TAW to express that s/he prefers to work at the
same place as her/his husband/wife, yielding monetary gains
(lower transportation costs by using the same car) and non-
monetary gains (joint lunch). From a formal point of view,
extending the framework in this way does not yield; in our
opinion; valuable insights and we will hence not present it
here.
Conversely the framework can be extended to allow
bidders to bid for multiple TAWs simultaneously instead of
single TAWs. So the operator of a restaurant can put in a
combined bid for a cook and a waiter, which have previously
successfully worked together, which may be higher than the
sum of bids for the cook and waiter individually.
The here presented mechanism can of course be also used
to allocate tasks in other circumstances, for instance in grid
and cloud computing similar allocation problems need to be
solved. The tasks to be allocated are computing tasks. One
further area of application is the wide ﬁeld of social choice
dealing with the multi-faceted problem of how to increase
social welfare [83].
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have presented a web service based application run-
ning an algorithm matching TAWs and business, which uses
a multi-dimensional price VCG auction. In this auction, the
TAWs can individually express salary demands, depending
on the job to be done and the employer. We showed
that the best a bidder can do is to bid true valuations.
Furthermore, we have seen that there are also incentives
for the TAWs to honestly report preferences. We have hence
designed a mechanism encouraging proper behavior creating
an environment that hopefully contributes to a rise in the
social standing of temporary workers and temporary work
in general.
Formally, we have applied a model of transaction phases
to our approach and subsequently extended this model,
see Figure 4. This new model allows us to state that our
approach addresses the online information and negotiation
transaction phase inside the realization phase thus allowing
a further automation of a particular labor market. We are
optimistic that electronic auctions are a suitable mean to
reduce transaction costs for trading goods and services that
cannot perfectly be described, in particular labor. Enabling
market players (here TAWs and employers) to specify their
own multi-dimensional utility functions is in our view a key
ingredient for a successful implementation.
Overall, we have reached the goal we set out [see
Section I-A] and alleviated in the last section highlighted
drawbacks of the business model of a TEA.
A. Limitations
The here presented approach is limited by the assumption
that all salary components can be added in a natural way,
furthermore we assumed that the employers utility functions
are additive and commute with addition. A restriction to the
numbers of participants taking part in the auction arises from
the complexity of calculating the allocation f. Furthermore,
the assumptions of full rationality and risk neutrality are in
general not always satisﬁed in the real world.
One limiting factor in electronic labor markets is the
human aversion to new technologies. However, an easy-
to-use, understandable and beneﬁting system stands good
chances to mostly overcome such aversions [78].
B. Future Research
In our view, it is desirable to design a mechanism similar
to the above that can handle salary components, which
cannot be added canonically (such as: job title, job location,
work task). We consider the long-term goal of a development
and an implementation of a multi agent system (with agents
acting for and on behalf of market players) for electronic
labor markets worthy of future attention from the scientiﬁc
community as well as from business communities.
