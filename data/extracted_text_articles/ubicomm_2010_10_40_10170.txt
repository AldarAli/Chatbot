Abstract— This paper presents a general framework to enable 
the implementation of receive collaboration in wireless sensor 
networks (WSN). The framework also allows the evaluation of 
collaborative channel equalization (CCE) performance as one 
aspect of receive collaboration. Our analysis shows that the use 
of receive collaboration to receive signals from remote sources 
is energy efficient with reasonable computational load and 
memory consumption. However, the increased time delay is a 
restricting parameter, which limits the application of receive 
collaboration to a small number of cooperating nodes and to 
rather short data streams.

 INTRODUCTION  
Due to the limited and nonrenewable batteries of the 
sensor nodes in WSNs, energy efficiency is one of the most 
important issues of the network and protocol design in 
WSNs.  
The application of array processing schemes [1-4] in 
wireless communication applications is beneficial in terms 
of energy efficiency and reliability. In WSNs, array 
processing schemes are applicable during a cooperation of a 
group of neighbouring nodes. Obviously, synchronization, 
sharing the signals via local communications and processing 
capabilities to process the transmitted/received signals are 
some necessities of the sensor nodes.  
Due to the limitations of WSNs, array processing 
schemes are applicable by cooperation of the sensor nodes 
which increases the amount of inter-node communications. 
In [5] and [6], a general framework for implementation of 
array processing schemes is developed. According to this 
idea, a group of sensors cooperate to improve signal 
reception. Collaborative channel equalization is also 
suggested as an aspect of receive collaboration. The use of 
array processing schemes in transmit mode is considered as 
distributed beamforming in [7-9]. It is shown that both 
receive and transmit collaboration are effective methods to 
decrease and distribute the energy consumption.  
Despite of its energy efficiency, the increased 
computational load and memory consumption of receive 
collaboration limit the applications. However, increase in its 
applications is expected due to future advances in hardware 
design.   
In [5], receive collaboration is introduced as a way to 
increase the energy efficiency of WSNs in receive mode. 
According to this new idea, a group of neighboring nodes 
cooperate to improve the reception of a signal by applying 
array processing schemes like channel equalization. Based 
on this idea, it is applicable to improve the quality of the 
received signal at a fixed value of transmitted SNR or to 
reduce the transmitted power without any decrease in the 
quality of received signal. The implementation of receive 
collaboration and CCE in CDMA based WSNs are 
introduced in [6]. It is shown that due to the large amount of 
spreading and despreading during CDMA based local 
communications, the computational load and memory 
requirements of receive collaboration increase more than 
linearly. Therefore, the processing capability and available 
memory of the nodes are the two restricting parameters to 
develop receive collaboration in CDMA based networks.  
In TDMA-based protocols, a TDMA frame is divided 
into time slots and each node is assigned one. The 
transmission schedule allows nodes to send and receive 
without collision. In TDMA based MAC protocols the 
interference between adjacent wireless links is guaranteed to 
be avoided. Thus, the energy waste coming from packet 
collisions is diminished. In [10-12] some TDMA based 
MAC protocols for sensor networks are studied. Although 
the use of TDMA in local communications requires exact 
synchronization of cooperating nodes, it is an efficient way 
of mitigating the limitations of CDMA based networks.  
The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate 
receive collaboration in TDMA based WSNs. To do so, in 
the next section, we propose a general framework for 
implementation of receive collaboration in TDMA based 
WSNs. This framework is a primary step to implement the 
array processing schemes. To evaluate the performance, 
advantages and disadvantages of receive collaboration, CCE 
is considered in Section III as an aspect of receive 
collaboration. According to CCE, after aggregation of the 
received signals at the processing node, a channel 
equalization scheme is applied on the signals to decrease 
undesired effects of the transmission channel. In this 
section, energy efficiency, computational load, time delay 
and memory requirements of the proposed framework are 
evaluated. It also includes some simulations. Finally, 
Section IV concludes this paper.

II. 
RECEIVE COLLABORATION FOR TDMA BASED WSNS 
In the following subsections, a general framework for 
implementation of receive collaboration in TDMA based 
WSNs is developed.  
A. Data Reception 
The first step of receive collaboration is the reception of 
an impinging signal from the remote node. In TDMA based 
networks, various methods may be considered to manage 
the reception and transmission timing of the nodes. 
In the following steps, it is assumed that the cooperating 
nodes transmit their signals only in their corresponding time 
slot whereas they are ready to receive the impinging signals 
both in their time slots and in the common time slot.  
B. Announcement 
After reception of the impinging signal, one of the 
cooperating nodes is selected as the processing mode to 
handle the receive collaboration. New processing node is 
selected by a reference node which can be the previous 
processing node or cluster-head in the cluster based 
networks. An announcement message containing the ID of 
the new processing node is broadcasted through the other 
cooperating nodes in the common time slot.  
C. Synchronization 
Random distribution of the cooperating nodes causes 
random time delays in local communications. Therefore, in 
advance of the aggregation of the received signals, 
cooperating nodes should be synchronized. Similar to the 
CDMA based networks [5], during the synchronization step, 
the processing node estimates the time delays of local 
communications and assigns new time slots to the 
cooperating nodes to increase the efficiency of the receive 
collaboration. Proper time delays should be applied to the 
new time scheduling to avoid overlapping.  
To do so, processing node broadcasts a synchronization 
message via the common time slot. It can both detect the 
time slots of the cooperating nodes and estimate the time 
delays of local communications based on the feedbacks 
from cooperating nodes. To properly estimate the time 
delays, the synchronization message should be short enough 
to avoid overlapping due to different time delays. Finally, 
the processing node computes a new scheduling for the 
cooperating nodes and informs them via their previous time 
slots. Reception of the acknowledgements from the 
cooperating nodes confirms proper time slots allocation.  
Various time slot scheduling methods can be suggested 
to avoid overlapping due to different time delays of local 
communications. As the simplest method, some guard bands 
are considered among the time slots. Assuming the length of 
the guard bands to be equal to the maximum time delay of 
local communications overlap-free local communication is 
guaranteed. Despite of its simplicity, this method is not 
time-efficient. In another method, non-processing nodes are 
sorted according to their time delays and the node with 
smaller time delay would belong to the first time slot and so 
on. Although this method increases the efficiency of time 
scheduling, it is not completely efficient due to gaps among 
the received time slots. As an efficient method, it is possible 
to designate the time slots such that they have no overlap at 
the processing node, meanwhile there is no gap among the 
received time slots by the processing node. The length of the 
time slots depends on the method used in the aggregation 
step. It is discussed in more detail in the next subsection.  
D. Aggregation 
In this step, received signals by the cooperating nodes 
are aggregated at the processing node. Proper array 
processing scheme is applied mostly by combination of 
these signals after applying weighting coefficients which are 
generated recursively based on the aggregated signals. In 
this paper, the least squares constant modulus algorithm 
(LS-CMA) [13-14] is considered as the channel equalization 
scheme. LS-CMA estimates optimum weighting coefficients 
by minimizing the following cost function with respect to 
wk, the 1×M vector of weighting coefficients, which 
corresponds to k-th sample of the aggregated signal



where xk is the 1×M vector containing the k-th sample of 
received signals. The operator H is the conjugate transpose 
operator.  
According to the stochastic gradient methods [15], the 
weight vector in each time instant is updated based on its 
previous value and the gradient of the cost function. In 
practice, wk is updated recursively as follows

In this equation, μ is the step size of the algorithm, a 
constant parameter to control the convergence rate of the 
algorithm. After convergence of the algorithm to its 
optimum weighting coefficient, wopt, it has small variations 
due to the variation of the effective parameters on the 
aggregated signals. It enables the processing node to apply 
wopt for some parts of the aggregated signals.  
To start the aggregation step, processing node broadcasts 
a request for aggregation. After receiving the aggregation 
request, each non-processing node sends its signal to the 
processing node via its corresponding time slot. Assuming 
to be enough samples at the first part of aggregated signals 
for convergence, wopt is achieved and used to generate the 
output of the channel equalizer.  
Depending on the criticality of the power supply and 
computational capability of the processing node and also 
energy consumption of the local communications, it is 
possible to distribute the computational load. To do so, 
processing node sends the coefficients to the corresponding 
nodes. Each node sends its signal to the processing node 
after applying the weighting coefficient.  
Due to the simple and low cost construction of sensor 
nodes, it is not applicable to implement exact synchroniza-

tion modules for the cooperating nodes. Therefore, especially 
for higher data rates, there are some synchronization errors 
during local communications.   
The question is that how much is the ability of CCE in 
the case of imperfect synchronization. Despite the 
performance degradation of CMA based channel equalizer 
due to random distribution of the cooperating nodes, it is 
shown that CMA is still helpful for such applications [5]. 
Since channel equalization is not based the nodes’ positions, 
it is possible to model the synchronization errors as some 
changes in the nodes’ position. However the synchronization 
error should be small enough to have correlated signals at the 
processing node in data aggregation step.   
III. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
CCE is an aspect of receive collaboration in which the 
processing node applies a channel equalization method to 
decrease undesired transmission channel effects. In this 
section, the effect of CCE on some critical parameters of 
WSN such as energy efficiency, computational load, time 
delay and memory consumption are considered.  
To better visualization of the analysis of this section, 
some simulations are also presented. The assumptions of 
this section are listed below: 
 
Duration of the transmitted signal: 1 ms 
 
Number of the cooperating nodes: 50 
 
The distance between remote and cooperating 
nodes: 2 km 
 
Primary time slot duration in local communications: 
100 μs 
 
The number of primary time slots in the primary 
scheduling: 100 
 
New time slot duration: 50 μs 
 
Number of the time slots in the new scheduling: 50 
 
Radius of the disk containing the nodes: 50 m 
 
Node density: 6.4 · 10-6 nodes/m2 
 
Carrier frequency of the remote node: 20 MHz 
 
BER of interest at the processing node: 0.01 
These parameters are constant unless it is mentioned. To 
focus on CCE, we avoid using any coding technique in our 
simulations.

During the synchronization step, the processing node 
broadcasts a synchronization message and receives some 
feedbacks from the cooperating nodes. It contains M local 
transmissions. After estimation of the time delays of the 
local communications, the processing node generates new 
more time-efficient scheduling and informs the other 
cooperating nodes during M-1 local transactions. Reception 
of some acknowledgements from the cooperating nodes 
needs also M-1 local communications. Therefore, the 
synchronization step is performed during 3M-2 local 
communications and its energy consumption is

At the aggregation step, all of the non-processing nodes 
send their data to the processing node. Depending on the

performed in several time slots. The energy consumption of

By substitution of (14) in (4) and some simplifications, 
energy efficiency is achieved as (15).  
Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of increasing the number of 
cooperating nodes on energy efficiency. In all situations, the 
area in which the cooperating nodes are distributed is the 
same. Therefore, increasing the number of nodes is the same 
as increasing the node density. In this figure, energy 
efficiency is calculated for different values of L (the 
distance between remote and cooperating nodes). As seen in 
this figure, when L = R, increasing of M has negative effect 
on the energy efficiency such that CCE is inefficient for  
M ≥ 30. Although CCE decreases the transmitted power by 
the remote node, the energy consumption of local 
communications grows up by increasing the number of 
cooperating nodes. In CCE, energy consumption can be 
divided into two parts; energy consumption by the remote 
node (ERN) and that of local communications (ELC). For 
small values of L, due to the small values of transmission 
loss, both ERN and EnoCCE are rather small. Therefore ELC 
plays key role in energy efficiency.  
Moreover, Fig. 1 shows that by increasing of L (in the 
case of proper transmission range) the energy efficiency 
improves. It is because of the higher increment rate of ERN 
rather than ELC. Finally ELC can be neglected for higher 
values of L and therefore the curves are saturated.  
Increasing of L has no effect on the computational load 
and memory consumption and its effect on the time delay is 
neglectable. Therefore, it can be said that the application of 
CCE in long range communications is more beneficial than 
that of in short distances.  
Fig. 2 shows the effect of increasing the distance of the 
remote node on the energy efficiency for different values of 
the number of cooperating nodes. All of the curves saturate 
by increasing of L, but increasing of M increased both the 
distance in which saturation happens and the final value of 
the energy efficiency. As mentioned before, by increasing of 
L, ERN increases whereas ELC remain constant such that after 
some increase in L, ELC become neglectable and the curves 
approach to their final value. Increasing of M increases ELC. 
Therefore, saturation happens in larger values of L. On the 
other hand, for small values of L, ELC > ERN. Therefore 
energy efficiency descends significantly. Since increases by 
M, using less cooperating nodes yields better results. 
B. Time Delay 
In the case of using no CCE, one of the cooperating 
nodes receives the impinging signal from the remote node. 
Therefore, the needed time for no CCE based reception 
method is

In equation (16), the time delays of local communications 
are neglected.  
Fig. 4 illustrates the time delay of CCE. It is shown that 
the time delay increases linearly by increasing the duration 
of the received signal from the remote node. This increase is 
mostly because of the serial aggregation of the signals in the 
aggregation step due to the use of TDMA in local 
communications. It is why the increment rate of the time 
delay curves increase by increasing of the number of 
cooperating nodes.  
C. Memory Consumption 
Fig. 5 shows the memory consumption of receive 
collaboration. As expected from the Table 1, the curves are 
linear. It shows that increasing of M has approximately 
linear effect on the memory consumption. Generally, it can 
be said that memory consumption is not a critical issue in 
TDMA based WSNs.  
According to receive collaboration steps, memory 
consumption of the non-processing nodes is low. The 
memory consumption of the processing node depends on the 
length of the signal transmitted by the remote node. 
D. Computational Load 
In TDMA based networks computational load is not a 
critical issue. Assuming no encoding at the cooperating 
nodes, the computational load is limited to the generation of 
proper scheduling for the cooperating nodes (computational 
load of the selection of new processing node and estimation 
of the time delay of local communications are neglected).

Figure 6.  Effects of increasing L on the computational load for 
different values of M 
Our simulations show that increasing the length of received 
signal (Td) has no considerable effect on the energy 
efficiency. But it increases the computational load. Fig. 6 
shows that the number of additions and multiplications are 
approximately the same. These parameters increase linearly 
by increasing the duration of the received signal. The highest 
value of this parameter corresponds to the longest signal 
duration and largest number of cooperating nodes which is 
less than 3·105 addition and multiplication. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The 
performance 
of 
receive 
collaboration 
and 
collaborative channel equalization in TDMA based WSNs 
are investigated. It is shown that when the transmitter node 
is at the short distance (smaller than the virtual array radius) 
from the virtual array, the energy efficiency of CCE is 
negative, but it grows up by increasing the distance until 10 
times of the virtual array radius. Although the computational 
load and memory consumption of CCE is very low, 
increasing of the time delay by increasing the number of 
cooperating nodes or by increasing the length of received 
signal is a limiting parameter of CCE.  
In TDMA based WSNs, receive collaboration is 
completely 
useful 
to 
receive 
short 
data 
streams. 
Reasonability of receive collaboration to receive rather long 
data streams is due to the acceptable time delay at the 
cooperating nodes. Moreover, the efficiency of receive 
collaboration improves by increasing the distance between 
cooperating nodes and the remote node.
