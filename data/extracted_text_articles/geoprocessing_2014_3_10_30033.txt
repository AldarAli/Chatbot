Abstract—This paper presents a Geographical Information 
Systems (GIS)-based toolkit, developed for site comparison 
and ranking that can be used to facilitate the decision making 
process in second stage of the site selection process. The toolkit 
has been developed as an analytical component of a multi-
criteria spatial decision support system for geoenvironmental 
and geoenergy applications. The methodology adopted to 
develop this analytical module is based on a systematic 
comparison of the surrounding areas of each site in accordance 
with key environmental, socio-economic and public-health 
indicators. The sites are ranked based on the most favorable 
key indicators using a Criterion Sorting Mechanism (CSM) or 
Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal 
Solution (TOPSIS). An application of the site selection toolkit 
is presented in relation to an unconventional geoenergy 
development. The application exercise deals with the ranking 
of a number of potential sites for coalbed methane recovery in 
Wales, UK. The locations of potential sites are first selected 
with respect to the gas resource (techno-economic viability). 
The toolkit is then used to select and rank the potential sites 
based on key environmental indicators, in the site’s 
neighbourhood. The results of the site ranking using CSM and 
TOPSIS methods are compared and a number of scenarios are 
discussed. This approach of using a combination of site 
ranking methods along with the neighbourhood analysis 
reduces the risk of personal judgment and choice. The 
decisions on site selection can thus be evidenced on a 
quantified logic.   
Keywords-neighbourhood analysis; spatial decision support 
system; site selection; site ranking; coalbed methane.

 INTRODUCTION 
This paper describes the development of a Geographical 
Information Systems (GIS)-based toolkit for site ranking, 
based on an analysis of the surrounding areas. The toolkit 
can be used in the “second phase” of a site selection process, 
where the decision maker may need to choose from a 
number of potential sites or from a large suitable area.   
The problem considered is one where after applying the 
“first phase” of a GIS-based site selection process, the 
decision maker is left with multiple choices either in the 
form of more than one equal potential sites (in vector format) 
or very large areas (in raster format).  
Different GIS modelling techniques have been suggested 
in the literature for site selection process. These techniques 
are collectively known as Spatial Multi Criteria Decision 
Analysis (S-MCDA). For example, a combination of 
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS method 
has been suggested for municipal solid waste landfill site 
selection with a case study of Thrace region in Greece [1]. 
Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) in combination with 
fuzzy set theory has been applied for decisions on wind farm 
sites selection in Northwest Ohio [2]. AHP, fuzzy 
membership functions and Simple Additive Weighting 
(SAW) has been used together in a study to find the most 
suitable site for a tourist building a in the rural landscape of 
Hervás in Spain [3]. Similarly, a spatial decision tool for 
managed aquifer recharge has been presented in [4] that 
combine AHP, WLC and Ordered Weighted Averaging 
(OWA). A case study of this tool has been presented for the 
site selection of managed aquifer recharge in the Algarve 
Region of Portugal [4].   
As described previously, at this stage, multiple sites may 
be obtained with equal potential. The suitable areas obtained 
in these studies are in the form of a raster map with relatively 
large areas, suitable for siting. For example, the area 
highlighted as a suitable area for aquifer recharge in [4], 
constitutes about 11.2% of the entire study area. Then, the 
suitable area was ranked on the basis of suitability score and 
the most highly suitable class reduced the area under 
consideration to 1% of the entire study area. At this stage the 
sitting decision is mainly based on the choice and expert 
knowledge of the decision maker(s). 
To facilitate the decision making in the second phase, 
under the conditions described above, site ranking using 
neighbourhood analysis is presented in this paper. This 
approach can provide a quantified logic to select and rank the 
best site(s) from several candidate sites identified in the first 
level of the site selection process. Using the approach 
presented, inputs required from the decision maker and the 
risks associated with personal judgement and choice can be 
minimized. 
An overview of neighbourhood analysis for site 
comparison and methods for site ranking is presented in 
Section II. In Section III, a description of the toolkit 
development and analytical components is presented. Tools 
and technologies used for the development of the toolkit are 
also highlighted. In Section IV, an application of the toolkit 
is presented which deals with the ranking of a number of 
hypothetical Coal Bed Methane (CBM) sites in Wales (UK). 
The toolkit has been used to rank the suitable sites in terms 
of key environmental indicators using both CSM and 
TOPSIS ranking methods. In Section V, the results of the 
application of the toolkit are discussed. Ranks generated 
from both the techniques are also compared. Conclusions 
drawn from this work are presented in Section VI.

II. 
OVERVIEW: SITE NEIGHBOURHOOD ANALYSIS AND 
SITE RANKING 
As discussed in Section I, the GIS-based site selection 
process can result in a number of potential sites or a 
relatively large potential area that meets the basic criteria, 
set in the first stage of selection process. In the second stage 
of site selection, it is important to reduce and prioritise the 
equal potential sites identified for further investigation and 
final selection. Some of the spatial multi criteria decision 
analysis techniques described earlier, may also involve the 
user’s judgments and preferences over the relative 
importance 
of 
key 
indicators. 
Site 
neighbourhood 
comparison and ranking can be useful in a logical ordering 
of the available options based on only the analysis of the 
key indicators in the site neighbourhood. Once key 
indicators are defined and the effective neighbouring region 
is selected around the sites identified in the first stage of 
selection process, an appropriate ranking method can then 
be used to prioritise the alternatives. 
Site neighbourhood analysis has been adopted in 
identifying potentially suitable sites for storm water 
harvesting in an urban area [5] in which a similar two-stage 
approach for site selection and ranking was adopted. The 
application of the site neighbourhood analysis has also been 
reported in selection of temporary municipal storage waste 
sites in Sweden using buffer analysis [6]. In the mentioned 
application, key demographic metrological indicators were 
analysed in these buffers around the sites [6]. 
For ranking the alternates or equal potential sites, 
different ranking techniques can be applied. Some 
commonly used ranking techniques are: Technique for 
Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution 
(TOPSIS) [7], Superiority and Inferiority Ranking (SIR) [8] 
and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) [9]. TOPSIS is 
among widely adopted methods for ranking. In the toolkit 
presented in this paper, TOPSIS method has been adopted 
along with a new approach which is based on a criterion 
sorting mechanism.  
III. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOOLKIT 
As 
described 
previously, 
a 
site 
neighbourhood 
comparison approach has been adopted after a first phase site 
selection process has been completed. Using the appropriate 
logic in the toolkit, suitable areas are narrowed down into the 
most suitable site, considering additional criteria. The 
following steps are adopted in the toolkit to analyse the 
information and generate the results: 
 First, the user provides two GIS layers to the toolkit and 
related data are loaded in the memory. One layer holds 
all potential sites whereas the other layer presents 
information of the neighbourhood of each site for the 
analysis. It is noted that this information could vary from 
problem to problem, e.g., socio-economic indicators or 
environmental indicators in the surrounding regions. 
 The toolkit then scales all the indicators between 0-
1(where 0 is the minimum value and 1 is the maximum 
value of each indicator in the layer). During the scaling 
process, i.e., commensuration, the user defines whether a 
particular indicator is Benefit (the more, the better) or 
Cost (the less, the better) in nature. The user can use 
either original values or scaled values. For scaling, the 
toolkit provides Maximum Score Procedure and Score 
Range Procedure, as in [10] and [11]: 
a. Maximum Score Procedure: 
(Benefit)     
   
   
       
(1) 
(Cost)         
      
   
       
(2) 
b. Score Range Procedure: 
(Benefit)     
   
           
               
(3) 
(Cost)         
   
            
               
(4) 
where     is the value of the ith location (potential 
site) for the jth criterion.    
 
 is the scaled 
(standardized) value of    .        and        are the 
minimum and maximum values of the jth variable in 
the entire dataset [11]. 
c. Using original values: This is the case when all 
indicators have same unit of measurement and they 
are either cost or benefit in nature. In such scenarios, 
decision maker can keep them in original units. 
 The toolkit then selects the neighbouring areas of each 
potential site based on criteria specified by the user. This 
is done by applying buffers around the candidate sites 
and selecting the intersecting regions in indicator layer. 
 The toolkit calculates the minimum, maximum and 
average values of each indicator in the selected 
neighbourhood of each site. Either of these average, 
maximum or minimum values can be selected to rank the 
sites. 
 The final step is to assign ranks to the sites. User can 
choose the ranking either based on CSM or the TOPSIS 
method. The toolkit generates the results and visualises 
them in decision assistive graphs and tables. 
The toolkit has been developed using Microsoft .Net C# 
programming language and an open source .Net spatial 
library, i.e., DotSpatial [12]. The toolkit uses Shapefiles, 
which is a “de facto” data type standard for vector data in 
GIS. The toolkit can also work on layers from an open 
source spatial database, namely SpatiaLite [13]. The problem 
is presented to the toolkit through two information layers 
(Shapefiles or SpatiaLite layers). 
Figure1 presents the Geographical User Interface (GUI) 
of the toolkit. User can provide the necessary information 
using this interface. The user can also assign the buffer 
radius in map units to define the surrounding areas of each 
site to be included in the analysis. The toolkit first generates 
the buffer polygons around each site according to the user 
defined buffer size. Then the second layer containing 
indicators is intersected with these buffer polygons. If the 
buffer option is unused, only those areas are selected from 
the indicator layer that directly intersects with the sites 
without using any buffer. The toolkit can rank the sites based 
on the average, maximum or minimum value of each 
indicator in the given surrounding regions of each site.

Each site may obtain different ranks for different 
indicators. A cumulative rank is then constructed by the 
toolkit using a Criterion Sorting Mechanism (CSM). If CSM 
is used, this cumulative rank is based on the individual ranks 
for each indicator. For this purpose, a rank sum is 
constructed for each site by summing up individual ranks of 
all the indicators. Sites are sorted in ascending order in terms 
of this rank sum. The site with lowest rank sum gets the 
overall Rank 1. 
In order to compare the results of CSM technique, 
TOPSIS method is also incorporated within the toolkit. 
TOPSIS is selected because it is a commonly used ranking 
method in MCDA problems [14] [15]. It ranks the sites 
based on their distances from the most ideal and the least 
ideal solution [7].  
If TOPSIS method is used, the cumulative site ranks are 
constructed using the empirical formulation of TOPSIS 
method. The procedure adopted in TOPSIS approach follows 
the steps provided in [7]. The detail of the calculation and 
procedure is therefore not provided here. The closer the rank 
is to 1, the priority of the alternate is higher as it is closer to 
the ideal solution and far from the worst solution [7]. It is a 
matter of sorting all the alternatives on the basis of these 
values and then assigning ordered ranks between 1-m, where 
1 is the highest rank and m is the lowest rank.  
The results are generated in the form of a report 
containing charts and a table, which provide the ranks of 
each site with respect to the indicators and also present the 
cumulative rank produced by CSM and TOPSIS. For 
charting, Microsoft chart control is used under the Microsoft 
Public Licence (Ms-PL) [16]. Polar chart scheme is also used 
to show the area covered by each potential site over different 
axis (indicators). 
IV. 
APPLICATION CASE STUDY 
An application of the toolkit for the site neighbourhood 
analysis of six potential sites for CBM recovery in Wales, 
UK is presented.  Using CBM technology, the gas contained 
in deep and un-minable coal seams can be exploited [17]. 
The gas recovery can also be enhanced by injecting carbon 
dioxide into coal seams (ECBM) [17].  
A number of potential areas for CBM have been 
identified and reported in the North and South Wales 
coalfields [18]. Estimations have been carried out based on 
parameters, such as coal seam thickness, clean coal thickness 
(total thickness minus 15% ash and dirt allowance), density 
and gas content [18].  
Two areas in Wales have been selected, one in the South 
coalfield (CBM area 4) and one in the North coalfield (CBM 
area 3). The areas have been selected among the potential 
CBM areas identified and reported in [18] based on 
“resource” capacity consideration. It is noted that the 
selected regions are not necessarily the most suitable areas 
for CBM in Wales. However, according to the CBM 
resource assessment figures given in [18], these areas may 
also contain a considerable CBM resource potential. The 
major characteristics of these two CBM areas are shown in 
Table 1. 
Six 500m×500m squared areas have randomly been 
selected within the two regions mentioned (3 in each region). 
Figure 2 presents the coal resources in Wales and the 
potential CBM sites selected for this study. Since the area 
and properties of all the six sites are similar, it was assumed 
that the sites are equal potential candidates for CBM.

sites with 3 km buffers. 
In the example provided, multiple sites exist with similar 
suitability, which is the same as the site suitability problem 
discussed in section two. The site neighbourhood analysis 
tool has therefore been applied, using some key 
environmental indicators. Some of these indicators were 
taken from the Department for Environment Food and Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA). The indicators are the background air 
pollution maps used for the ambient air quality assessment 
[19], which have also been adopted in the construction of 
the environmental deprivation within the Welsh Index of 
Multiple 
Deprivation 
2011 
(WIMD) 
[20]. 
Other 
environmental indicators used are the distance of each 
potential site from the protected areas in Wales, which was 
taken from datasets managed by the Countryside Council 
for Wales (CCW) [21]. 
The Intrinsic Evaluation Matrix of LandMap (Visual 
Sensory) dataset developed by CCW was also used for 
aesthetic coverage across Wales. This data set contains 
records of the ordinary and spectacular landscapes and 
information about the physical, ecological, visual, historical 
and cultural landscape of Wales [21]. The Intrinsic 
Evaluation Matrix covers scenic quality, integrity, character 
and rarity of the area and an “overall” index, which divides 
the Welsh landscape into Outstanding, High, Moderate and 
Low values [21]. These qualitative values were converted to 
numerical values of 1.0, 0.75, 0.50 and 0.25 respectively, to 
be used in the analysis. Table 2 shows the datasets used in 
neighbourhood assessment of the six potential sites for 
CBM exploitation.  
All these environmental indicators were combined 
together into one GIS layer. For this a grid of 500m×500m 
area was generated across Wales using ArcGIS software. 
Using “near” and “spatial join” tools of the ArcGIS, these 
cells were then populated with the indicators data. The six 
potential sites were then saved in another vector layer. The 
site neighbourhood tool was applied with a buffer of 3 km 
around the sites (as shown in Figure 2) and ranking of the 
sites was carried out using both CSM and TOPSIS methods. 
In the TOPSIS method used in this study, a relative 
weight of the criterion is also provided by the user to 
emphasize the importance of one over the other [7]. In 
simple cases, the weights can be directly applied and in 
cases, where uncertainty exists about the individual weights, 
pairwise comparison method is implied to find the relative 
weights [22]. In both cases the sum of all the individual 
weights should be equal to 1. To simplify the procedure in 
the example provided, it is assumed that the selected 
environmental indicators are equally important in the CBM 
site ranking process therefore an equal weight is assigned to 
every indicator for the construction of the TOPSIS ranks. 
V. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The results of the analysis are presented in Table 2. The 
ranking analysis has been carried out on the basis of the 
average values of each indicator in the given neighbourhood 
(3km in this case). The overall rank for the six potential 
sites was constructed using both CSM and the TOPSIS 
methods. In CSM, final ranks are constructed by summing 
up the individual ranks for each site and then sorting in 
ascending order. The site with the lowest rank sum was 
assigned the overall rank 1 whereas the site with highest 
sum was assigned rank 6 accordingly. 
The TOPSIS method calculates a distance of each 
potential site (alternate) from the most ideal and least ideal 
solution and the final ranks are constructed using (5).  
Figure 3 shows the neighbourhood analysis results for 
each site considering key environmental indicators. The area 
covered under each polar graph is reflected in the ranks 
produced by the tool. The scale on the polar graphs is shown

between 0-1 as the score range procedure, defined by (3) 
and (4), was used to scale the indicators.  
As described previously, some of the indicators are 
“cost” in nature, such as the air pollution or the aesthetic 
maps whereas others are “benefit” in nature, such as the 
distance from protected areas. By using the appropriate 
equations for scaling the data, it was ensured that all “cost” 
and “benefit” indicators were scaled between 0-1, where 0 
is the least favourable and 1 is the most favourable value. 
The results indicate that by using the CSM in ranking 
procedure, the site SW3 is overall the most suitable site in 
terms of the indicators used in the analysis (TABLE 2). 
However, using TOPSIS method, the site SW3 has been 
ranked as the third most favourable site. The site SW3 is 
ranked as the best site based on only two individual 
indicators, i.e., Distance from Ramsar Sites (DistRamsar) 
and PM10 (AmbPM10). It has been ranked as the least 
suitable site based on only one indicator, i.e., DistLNR. The 
TOPSIS takes into account the distance of the site from the 
most and least ideal solutions. Therefore the SW3 has not 
been ranked as the most suitable site using TOPSIS.  
The site NW1 has been ranked as the most suitable site 
by TOPSIS and second most suitable site by the CSM 
technique. Exploring the individual ranks assigned by the 
CSM, it can be observed that the site NW1 has been ranked 
as the most suitable site based on eight different individual 
indicators and as the least suitable site based on seven 
individual indicators. As a result, this makes the NW1 less 
suitable site compared to the SW3 using the CSM. From the 
results obtained, it can be deduced that the outcomes from 
CSM technique are less affected by the extreme values of 
criterion, compared to the results obtained from TOPSIS. 
The TOPSIS method assigns an overall Rank 2 to the 
site NW2 without it having top ranks for any of the 
individual indicators. Exploring the individual ranks further, 
it can be observed that almost all of the indicators ranks are 
in the middle of ranking scheme (1-6), i.e., taking the mean 
values. Considering the less deviated conditions of all 
indicators from the average values, the TOPSIS has ranked 
the site as the second most suitable alternative.  
Both SW3 and NW1 are in the top three most suitable 
sites by using any of the two ranking methods described.  
The NW1 can overall be considered as the most suitable site 
with more confidence as it was rated as the top two sites by 
both ranking methods. Further confidence has been 
achieved by using the two methods of ranking together for 
the identification of the most suitable site, described in this 
application. It is noted that, once ranks are assigned to the 
sites, top ranked sites can be further investigated for 
environmental, health and socio-economic risks.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
A GIS toolkit to analyse the neighbouring areas 
surrounding a potential site has been developed, which can 
be used to facilitate the process of decision making. The tool 
developed, provides a simple yet effective approach to deal 
with the ranking of sites based on some key indicators in 
their surrounding areas. Toolkit provides two different 
methods of site ranking, i.e., a simple Criterion Sorting 
Mechanism and the TOPSIS ranking method. This is useful 
where a number of equal potential sites or a large suitable 
area is acquired as the result of a GIS based site selection 
process in first phase of evaluation.  
An application of the toolkit for CBM resource 
exploitation was presented. Six sites were randomly selected in 
the South and North Wales coalfields with similar resource 
potential. Based on selected environmental indicators, the 
potential sites were ranked, considering neighbourhood 
conditions. The results show the ranks for each site with 
respect to individual environmental indicators using both 
the methods. 
The toolkit presented is part of a Spatial Decision 
Support System, developed to support a wide spectrum of 
geoenvironmental and geoenergy applications, where 
multiple criteria, such as the environment, public health, 
socio-economic and technical indicators are of importance 
in the decision process.
