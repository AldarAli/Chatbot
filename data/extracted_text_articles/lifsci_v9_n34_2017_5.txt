Abstract—There are many tasks for which people need domain-
speciﬁc skills learned through long-term practice. Many skill
acquisition models have been proposed that include the mental
states of the learners, but only few studies have tried to estimate
mental states using objectively measured data. The purpose
of this study was to experimentally investigate whether the
status of the skill acquisition process could be estimated by
physiological indices that indicate the learner’s mental states.
For this purpose, we conducted an experiment to obtain data
on physiological indices and a subjective report of the feeling
of difﬁculty during the skill acquisition task. As a result, we
conﬁrmed the relationship between the participant’s statuses and
the physiological indices. In addition, we classiﬁed the trials with
the feeling of difﬁculty in the experiment using Support Vector
Machine. As a result, the values of accuracy were over 0.65 when
the data not used to calculate the SVM model were classiﬁed.
We could show that the physiological indices are helpful clues to
estimate the status of the skill acquisition process.

INTRODUCTION
This article is a substantially extended version of the au-
thors’ paper “Experimentally Analyzing the Skill Acquisition
Model using Task Performance and Physiological Indices”
[1], presented at COGNITIVE 2017, the Ninth International
Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Appli-
cations, IARIA in Greece.
A skill is the ability to perform a task with pre-determined
results, often involving a given amount of time, energy, or
both. There are many tasks for which people need domain-
speciﬁc skills learned through long-term practice. We call this
kind of undertaking a “skill task.” To acquire the abilities for
a skill task, people usually train by carrying it out repeatedly.
However, it is difﬁcult to learn the aptitude in question alone
because, in many cases, people cannot objectively monitor
their skill level and task performance. Experts and instructors
can support learners, but the methods to support learning
a skill task have been established for few endeavors. Some
systems have been proposed to support learning based on task
performance.
Generally, when a person has acquired a skill, i.e., proﬁ-
ciency or expertise, this means that person can efﬁciently carry
out a speciﬁc task. Previous studies, e.g., [2], are founded on
the principle that learners pass through ﬁve stages: Novice,
competence, proﬁciency, expertise, and mastery. The phases
are characterized by how rules interplay with real-world con-
text. A novice will simply follow the rules that they are given
and not consider context. Intermediate stages contain a mix of
rule following, combined with more and more sophisticated
consideration of context [3]. To assess skill level, the skill
task is divided into a number of sub-tasks, the performance
on which is rated. However, to competently perform a job,
many skill tasks require various sub-skills corresponding to
the sub-tasks. In this case, even when the learner has acquired
some sub-skills, a situation may arise where he/she cannot
synthetically use them. In addition, it is often difﬁcult to rate
skill task performance itself. Tranquillo and Stecker [3] pointed
out that a master may, in fact, not be able to state the rules
or the heuristics that they are using. For example, we cannot
rate presentation skills independent of the contents of the
presentation. To support the skill acquisition of the skill task,
identifying the statuses in the skill acquisition process, e.g., the
steep acceleration section or the plateau section in a learning
curve, is more useful than rating the skill level. To identify
this status, human instructors focus on the learner’s responses
to unknown situations (such as questions and answers), giving
a new challenge, and deliberately making mistakes. In other
words, they evaluate the skill task model that the learner has.
Of course, the skill task model cannot be observed directly.
The important point is that we can use the learner’s own
recognition of his/her skill task model. The Dreyfus model
of skill acquisition [2] shows how students acquire abilities
through formal instruction in addition to practicing. This
model identiﬁes skill level based on four binary qualities:
(1) recollection (non-situational or situational); (2) recognition
(decomposed or holistic); (3) decisions (analytical or intuitive);
and (4) awareness (monitoring or being absorbed). The model
is intuitive, but no one knows how to evaluate the four factors
concretely. We considered an approach to estimate the learner’s
recognition, i.e., the learner’s mental state, from objectively
measured data during the skill acquisition process. For this
assessment, we used physiological indices that could gauge the
responses of the learner’s autonomic nervous system related
to his/her mental states. The physiological indices are usually

employed to ascertain mental stress.
Kraiger et al. [4] attempted to move toward a training
evaluation model by developing a classiﬁcation scheme for
evaluating learning outcomes. They integrated theory and
research from a number of diverse disciplines and provided
a multidimensional perspective on learning outcomes. They
provided a classiﬁcation scheme for learning outcomes for
training evaluation but were unable to propose a method to
identify the outcomes objectively. Mitchell et al. [5] assessed
participants’ self-efﬁcacy goals, expected performance, and
the degree to which certain judgments required cognitive
processing. The results showed that self-efﬁcacy was a better
predictor of performance than were expected score or goals on
early trials, whereas the reverse was true for later trials. This
result showed that the mental state is useful for estimating
the skill level because the responses changed with the skill
acquisition. From these results, we think that we needed a
method to objectively estimate the learner’s mental state that
changed with the skill acquisition process.
The ﬁnal goal of this study was to develop a method
to determine the status of the skill acquisition process in
detail for the skill task, using task performance and the
learner’s mental states. For this purpose, we experimentally
investigated whether the status of the skill acquisition process
could be estimated by the physiological indices that can be
used to estimate the learner’s mental states. We conducted an
experiment to obtain the data of the physiological indices and
a subjective report of the learner’s mental states.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy
introduces previous works on the skill acquisition model and
assessing human stress. Section III explains the outline of the
technique for appraising human stress and the skill acquisition
model via two dimensions: (1) task performance and (2) the
learner’s mental states. Section IV describes the experiment
and the analysis of the data. Section V discusses the analysis,
and Section VI lays out our conclusions and future works.

RELATED WORK
The Dreyfus Model of skill acquisition [2] seems to be
one of the most famous models of how students acquire skills
through formal instruction and practicing. This model is used
in a broad range of tasks, such as deﬁning an appropriate level
of competence, supporting judgements of when a learner is
ready to teach others, and so on. However, there are some
criticisms of this model [6]. According to these authors, there
is no empirical evidence for the presence of stages in the
development of expertise.
Day et al. [7] examined the viability of knowledge struc-
tures as an operationalization of learning in the context of
a task that required a high degree of skill using a complex
video game. At the end of acquisition, participants’ knowl-
edge structures were assessed and the similarity of trainees’
knowledge structures to an expert structure was correlated
with skill acquisition and was predictive of skill retention and
skill transfer. In addition, knowledge structures mediated the
relationship between general cognitive ability and skill-based
performance. However, they did not mention the process of
change of the cognitive ability during the skill acquisition.
Langan-Fox et al. [8] summarized traditional models
([9][10][11]). They pointed out that models of skill acqui-
sition largely ignore the experiences and dynamic internal
processes of a person while learning a skill. They attempted
to highlight the importance of a dynamic description of skill
acquisition in their research. Process-oriented factors such as
motivation, memory, interruptions, emotion, and metacognition
are investigated in relation to skilled performance. However,
their discussions were conceptual and they did not investigate
the matter experimentally.
There are also some studies focusing on the learning
process, e.g., [12][13][14]. This is called the learning curve,
and it is well known that skills are acquired gradually, followed
by a period of steep acceleration and then a plateau phase.
However, there is no deﬁnite answer as to why such stepwise
learning occurs. In general, it is thought that in the learning
status where changes in cognition for tasks are required,
learning is in the plateau section until the change occurs.
However, it is difﬁcult to objectively observe how the change
occurs. Observing changes in mental state during the skill
acquisition is also important in clarifying such processes.
There are some studies in which the physiological indices
were used for identifying the mental states. Patterson et al. [15]
used heart rate variability (low frequency:high frequency ratio)
to differentiate invested cognitive effort during the acquisition
and retention of a novel task. They found the usefulness of
heart rate variability in discriminating the cognitive effort
invested for a recently acquired skill. Walker et al. [16] sought
to identify a physiological measure that could help predict team
performance during a complex and dynamic task. Regression
analyses showed that team autonomic activity accounted for
10% of the variance in team performance scores. They showed
that the task performance can be predicted from physiological
indices. Parsinejad [17] tried to infer the mental workload
changes of human operator using physiological measurements
and performance metrics, while keeping participants’ inexpe-
rience as the key parameter. This research showed that physi-
ological indices and the participant’s ﬁnger-stroke patterns on
the touch screen could help ﬂag unfamiliarity of participants in
the difﬁcult game. These studies showed that the physiological
indices were useful to identifying the learner’s mental states
and they could predict the task performance based on the
physiological indices and the learner’s behavior. However, they
did not focused the relationships between the mental states and
the learning process.
III.
THE SKILL ACQUISITION MODEL, INCLUDING
MENTAL STATES
Some previous studies have proposed the skill acquisition
model, which considers learners’ mental states [2][8]. How-
ever, the mental states were evaluated by human observation.
In other words, previous studies have not focused on how
to measure, evaluate, and use mental states via objective
approaches to the skill acquisition model. In addition, they
have centered on mental states through the lens of a speciﬁc
skill level, but have not concentrated on the dynamics of people
going through a learning process. This study aimed to develop
a technique for assessing a learner’s skill level based on his/her
performance and mental states. To do so, we ﬁrst conﬁrmed the
relationship between subjective reports on mental states and the
measured physiological indices. We then interpreted the data
and performance for estimating skill levels and the process of
learning. In this section, we explain the physiological indices
that were used to appraise mental states, and propose a skill
acquisition model that has two dimensions that deﬁne skill
level.

A. Physiological indices for assessing mental states
In this study, we propose the skill acquisition model using
task performance and mental states. We especially focus on
how to gauge and use mental states in the skill acquisition
model. It is hard to use a learner’s behavior to evaluate mental
states because the learner’s behavior depends on the task and
skill level. However, when a learner feels that an activity
is difﬁcult, he/she feels mental stress due to his/her line of
thinking and stimuli from the endeavor. Therefore, we consider
stress useful for appraising a typical mental state in the learning
process.
Many previous investigations have reported on physiologi-
cal indices for estimating mental stress. However, in ongoing
daily interactions, we can often ﬁnd concurrent physiological
responses that are not related to the event. One reason is
that people involved in continuous interactions often plan their
actions, such as what to tell and how to move. Therefore, to
assess human mental states, we had to consider the context of
an interaction and the response characteristics of the physio-
logical indices.
Physiological indices are biological reactions caused by the
autonomic nervous system, for example: brain waves, potential
differences in cardiographs, variations in blood pressure, pulse
waves, respiration, body temperature, muscle potential, and
skin conductance. In continuous interactions, some of these
are susceptible to noise from body motions. We used skin
conductance responses (SCR) and electrocardiograms (Low
Frequency (LF)/High Frequency (HF) values) because these
are relatively resistant to noise.
Since the underlying mechanisms of SCR and electrocar-
diograms are different, we expected that they could be used to
distinguish between different responses from various sources
of stress. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous
system [18] and can be elicited by emotional stimuli, intellec-
tual strain, or painful cutaneous stimulation. The underlying
mechanisms of SCRs are more related to anticipation, expec-
tation, and attention concentration [19]. We thus anticipated
that SCRs could be used to tell when someone is dealing with
an unexpected situation.
For electrocardiograms, the LF/HF value is calculated using
instantaneous heart rate. It shows heart rate variability (HRV),
which is controlled by the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems and humoral factors. The underlying mecha-
nisms of HRV are complex. Lacey and Lacey [20] suggested
that it is caused by sensory intake and sensory rejection. In
addition, the parasympathetic nervous system responds quickly
(< 1 s) to stimuli. We thus thought that the LF/HF (HRV)
would show reactive responses based on external stimuli.
B. Relationship between a mental state and skill acquisition
The performance on a skill task is often difﬁcult to rate. We
consider skill acquisition to mean that a learner has constructed
an efﬁcient task model. If we could directly evaluate the
learner’s skill task model, we could identify the statuses of
the skill acquisition process. Human instructors focus on the
learner’s responses to unknown situations to estimate the skill
task model. The learner’s responses are expressions that the
learner feels difﬁculty and senses the patterns of mistakes.
Since learners might recognize the feeling of difﬁculty and
the mistakes consciously or unconsciously, we might estimate
them based on the learner’s mental states.

We focused on mental state changes to estimate whether
the learners thought their constructed task models were efﬁ-
cient. In general skill acquisition processes, we can draw a
learning curve whose shape resembles a series of steps, e.g.,
[12][13][14]. In the steep acceleration section of the curve,
the learners receive feedback from subjective and objective
evaluations and improve their behavior. In the plateau section,
the learners optimize their behavior and sometimes execute
trial and error for the next step to improve the task per-
formance. When the learners are constructing the skill task
model, they experience intrinsic stresses. When the learners
are improving their model, they mainly experience extrinsic
stresses. As mentioned above, we expect that the intrinsic and
extrinsic stress can be estimated with physiological indices. By
using these estimates, we may estimate whether the learners
thought their constructed task models were efﬁcient.
C. The skill acquisition model in two dimensions
We propose a skill acquisition model with two dimensions-
task performance and mental state-when a person feels that
a task is challenging (we call this a “feeling of difﬁculty”).
Figure 1 shows the model and the two dimensions. In the
traditional three phase model, Phase 1 corresponds to the lower
left part, Phase 2 corresponds to the upper part, and Phase 3
corresponds to the lower right part. The “task performance”
of the horizontal axis is the task result, objectively quantiﬁed.
The “feeling of difﬁculty” of the vertical axis is a mental state,
assessed based on the measured physiological indices. The tra-
ditional skill acquisition model assumes that task performance
(weakly) rises with an increase in skill levels. When a skill can
be segmented into small mutually independent sub-skills, this
assumption may be true of the process of acquiring sub-skills.
However, attaining sub-skills does not contribute to gaining
more than a certain level of overall aptitude for many skill
tasks, such as ballroom dancing. In this case, the synthetic use
of sub-skills is often important, and indeed itself is a target
of skill acquisition. When the learner practices synthetic use
through trial and error, task performance often decreases. In
our model, the trial and error process is included in the lower
part. When the task performance decreases but the difﬁculty
feeling is low, the model interprets the process as trial and
error. We expected that the learner would cycle through this
model throughout the skill acquisition process.
We assume that the skill acquisition process unfolds in
the following manner. The initial state of the learner is in the
upper or lower left part, i.e., performance is low. The learner
usually needs trial and error to learn the skill task, so the state
of the learner is maintained or transitions to the upper part.
Through the learning process, task performance increases and

the learner’s state moves to the upper right part. In this state,
the learner can perform the task at hand more efﬁciently than
before, but he/she is not accustomed to or does not understand
how to carry out the activity. Through practice at this stage,
the learner can synthetically and automatically perform the
task, and his/her state moves to the lower right part. In a
common case, the learner continuously performs trial and error
to ﬁnd better ways, so task performance sometimes falls. In
this case, the learner’s state is ready for the next stage of the
skill acquisition process. If the learner can ﬁnd clues for better
ways to perform the task, the skill acquisition process advances
to the next phase. If the learner cannot ﬁnd better ways, the
skill acquisition process terminates in the lower right part of
the stage. Figure 2 shows a series that demonstrates the ﬂow of
the skill acquisition process in our model. Through the cyclic
skill acquisition process, learners deepen their understanding of
the skills and the tasks. After that, they can ﬁnd a breakthrough
for better ways to perform the task, and advance to the next
phase of the skill acquisition.
IV.
EXPERIMENT
The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether
the physiological indices were related to the subjective reports
about the feeling of difﬁculty toward the task, and whether
we could evaluate the state of transition in the proposed skill
acquisition model based on task performance and physiological
indices. We adopted a shooter game as a skill task. Some
previous studies, e.g., [7], have adopted various shooter games.
The shooter game that we developed has features of the skill
task. The advantages of using a shooter game as the skill task
include the following: (1) The learner needs to obtain game
playing skills, which is hard to verbalize; (2) We can control
the difﬁculty of a task; and (3) We can easily analyze the
skill acquisition process because we can independently divide
the time series of the game events, which is the target of the
skill acquisition. In addition, learners can repeatedly play the
game with high motivation. We conducted an experiment in
which the participants played the shooter game repeatedly, and
we obtained the game scores and physiological indices during
game play. After the experiment, we analyzed the data to con-
ﬁrm the relationship between the physiological indices and the
subjective reports about the feeling of difﬁculty. Furthermore,
we examined the relationship in the skill acquisition process.

A. Task
To achieve the best performance in the shooter game, the
player must cultivate certain skills and gain certain knowledge,
such as operation procedures, scoring rules, the way to defeat
one’s enemies, the features of game stages, basic survival
patterns, and speciﬁc techniques to obtain a high score. Some
of these cannot be verbalized and the best method varies
among the players. To obtain game playing skills, the players
must practice repeatedly.
Figure 3 shows the screen shots in the shooter game, which
we developed. In this game, player uses two different methods
of attack, Gatling gun (Figure 3 (c)) and Lock-on laser (Figure
3 (a)(b)). The Gatling gun is a quick and out-range attack
method. When the player uses the Gatling gun to destroy the
enemies, the game score is a minimum. The lock-on laser
is powerful but needs a lock-on procedure near the enemies.
When the player uses a lock-on laser to destroy enemies, the
game score increases exponentially with the number of lock-on
targets destroyed at the same time. The player tries to obtain
as high a game score as possible by selectively using the
two different attack methods. Of course, as the enemies are
attacking the player, the lock-on laser cannot always be used
to survive in the game.
In this experiment, the participants were only trained for the
ﬁrst stage of the shooter game. The stage was segmented into
eight parts. The patterns of combinations and the movements
of enemies were different in each part. The eighth part was
the battle with the ﬁnal boss enemy. There was a relaxation
period after each part. The average clear time was designed
to be about 150 seconds. The patterns are shown in Figure 4.
The ﬁrst part and the fourth part are relatively easy because
the density of enemies is sparse and the moving patterns are
simple. Since the densities of enemies in the second and third
parts are thick and the moving patterns are complex, they
are relatively difﬁcult. From the ﬁfth to the seventh parts,
the densities of enemies are relatively sparse and the moving
patterns are relatively simple, but special techniques are needed
to get high scores. When the player used a suitable approach
in any part, his/her score was several times higher than that
obtained using an inappropriate procedure. When the enemies
hit the player three times, the game was over. When the boss
enemy was destroyed, the game was cleared. After the game

was over or cleared, the participants could conﬁrm their score.
They were instructed what behavior produced a high score,
but it was difﬁcult to carry out such behavior during the game.
The participants acquired game playing skills through repeated
practice. The game playing skill levels that we assumed are as
follows.
Basic:
A player can clear the game stage.
Senior: A player can get high scores in easy parts of the
game stage.
Expert: A player can ﬁnd the way to get high scores in
difﬁcult parts, but he/she sometimes fail.
Master: A player can get high scores in all parts of the
game stage.
The easy parts are the ﬁrst, fourth and seventh parts because
a player can easily ﬁnd the way to get high score. When a
player can get high score in these parts, his/her skill is a senior
level. The difﬁcult parts are the second, third, ﬁfth and sixth
parts. The types of difﬁculties are different between the second
and third parts and the ﬁfth and sixth parts. In the second
and third parts, a player has to deal with enemies of different
behaviors in parallel. In the ﬁfth and sixth parts, a player has to
deal with enemies according to a difﬁcult speciﬁc procedure.
When a player can get high score in either type of parts, his/her
skill is an expert level. When a player can get high score in
all parts, his/her skill is a master level.
B. Experimental set-up
The experimental set-up is shown in Figure 5. Each par-
ticipant sat in front of a 70-inch monitor that displayed the
game. The participants used a joystick with two buttons for
controlling the player character. A video camera was placed
behind the participant to record his/her behavior and the game
playing screen. The participant’s voice was recorded using
microphones of the video camera. Polymate was used to
measure SCR and the electrocardiogram. SCR was measured
with electrodes attached to the ﬁrst and third ﬁngers of the
participant’s non-dominant hand. The electrocardiogram was
measured by connecting electrodes with paste to the partic-
ipant’s left side, the center of the chest, and both ears for
ground and reference. The experimenter sat out of view of the
participant and made notes about the participant’s behavior
and his/her subjective feeling of difﬁculty during each part.
The experimenter was an expert at the game with experience
teaching novice players how to get a high score and thus knew
the points where to get a higher score and where is difﬁcult
for novice players.

C. Participants
The participants in the experiment were 21 male under-
graduate students between the ages of 18 and 25 (with a mean
age of 21.7). We eliminated the data of four participants, two
of whom did not acquire the skills because their game scores
did not increase throughout the experiment, and for two of
whom we failed to measure the physiological indices because
the electrodes detached. Therefore, the data of 17 participants
were used for analysis. The participants repeatedly played the
game in the experiment a total of 50 times; the total duration
of the experiment was about 240 minutes. Therefore, we could
obtain 850 game playing samples in all for analyses.
D. Procedure of the experiment
The experiment was divided into two sessions in the mid-
dle, and the participants took a long rest (15 minutes or more)
between sessions because playing the game and acquiring
the skills required heavy concentration. Each participant was
brieﬂy instructed on the experimental procedure. Electrodes
for measuring SCR and the LF/HF electrocardiogram values
were then attached to the participant’s left hand and chest.
The participant then played practice games twice. After a
two-minute relaxation period, the experimenter started the
video cameras and began recording the physiological indices,
whereupon the participant began an experimental session. The
participant played the game until it was over or cleared, then
relaxed for 30 seconds. Moreover, the participants rested for 3
minutes every 10 games, during which time the experimenter
scored the participant’s feeling of difﬁculty subjectively and
interviewed him/her about this sentiment at each part of the
stage. In the ﬁrst session of the experiment, the participants
played 30 games because many games ended in the middle of
the stage in the ﬁrst session.
E. Analysis
We analyzed the data obtained from the experiment. We
mainly focused on the data of physiological indices.

The physiological indices during the game play
We used 2 as the task performance and 3 as the feeling of
difﬁculty in our model. In this analysis, we used the simple
moving average (calculated from data for the previous ﬁve
games and shifted by two games) for the data from 2 and
4 . The data from 3 served as categorical data to identify
the feeling of difﬁculty. For example, the ﬁrst data point was
calculated from the data for games 1–5, the second data point
from the data for games 3–7, and so on. Figure 6 shows an
example of the analyzed data. A horizontal axis shows the
data number of the simple moving average, and a vertical
axis shows the ratio of the each value in each part. The task
performance was assigned the value of the score for each part,
divided by the maximum score for that part. The feeling of
difﬁculty took on the values +1, i.e., felt difﬁculty at that part
of the stage, and 0, i.e., did not feel difﬁculty at that part of
the stage. The physiological responses were measured as the
total time over the threshold (LF/HF: 3.0, SCR: 15.5) divided
by the total time of that part.
We did not analyze the eighth part because we could not
objectively segment the battle with the boss enemy. Thus, for
this section we analyzed the ﬁrst seven parts.
2) The relationship between the feeling of difﬁculty and the
physiological indices: We calculated Spearman’s rank corre-
lation coefﬁcients between the values of the task performance
(TP) and the values of physiological responses (LF/HF and
SCR), and those between the values of the feeling of difﬁculty
(FD) and the values of physiological responses. The results are
shown in Table I. In the second part, there is a weak negative
correlation between the values of the task performance and the
SCR responses, meaning that the scores themselves were not
so strongly related to the participants’ mental states. On the
other hand, there are weak positive correlations between the
values of the feeling of difﬁculty and the SCR responses in
three out of the seven parts, and moderate correlations in three
other parts. This conﬁrms that there is a relationship between
the feeling of difﬁculty and SCR.
We also performed Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the
physiological responses when participants felt difﬁculty with
the task and those when they did not. The numbers of samples
are as follows (part number - number of data points where
participants felt difﬁculty : number of other data points); the
ﬁrst part - 250 : 597, the second part - 370 : 472, the third part
- 127 : 704, the fourth part - 575 : 275, the ﬁfth part - 449 :

The results are shown in Table II. In this, only the p-values
under 0.1 are shown easy to see. The hyphen (“-”) means that
the p-value is over 0.1. There is a signiﬁcant difference in the
LF/HF responses only in the second part. On the other hand,
there are signiﬁcant differences in SCR responses in all the
parts. These results indicate that SCR is related to the feeling
of difﬁculty.
In our previous study, we reported that SCR relatively
reﬂected intrinsic stress (concentrating on the task, considering
it, and so on) and that LF/HF relatively reﬂected the effects by
extrinsic stimuli [21]. We expected that SCR would respond
when the participant considered how to destroy enemies and
what a bad point was in prior game plays, and therefore that
we would ﬁnd a relationship between the feeling of difﬁculty
and SCR. However, we expected that the LF/HF would respond
when the participant encountered impressive game events such
as getting a high score or making a mistake. Impressive game
events occurred independently of task performance and the
feeling of difﬁculty. Therefore, we could not ﬁnd a relationship
with LF/HF.
3) The differences of the physiological indices between
sections where task performance rapidly increased and others:
If SCR reﬂects intrinsic stress, there is a link between SCR
responses and changes of task performance, especially in the
parts of the task where it is important to plan how to destroy
enemies and get high scores. On the other hand, if LF/HF
reﬂects the effects of external stimuli, LF/HF responses change
whether the participants’ technique is optimized or not. We
thus expect that the values of the LF/HF responses and the SCR
responses in sections where task performance rapidly increased
are important for assessing the skill acquisition process in some
parts of the stage. We refer to a section where task performance
rapidly rose as a “Rapidly Increasing Section” (RIS), which is
deﬁned as a section in which task performance increases by
more than 0.1 for a continuous two or more sections.
We compared the LF/HF responses and the SCR responses
between the values in RISs and the other sections. We expected

that the meaning of the physiological responses was different
between the ﬁrst and second halves of the part of the stage.
The physiological responses in the ﬁrst half show whether the
participant had a concrete plan for scoring in advance. The
physiological responses in the second half show whether the
participant was used to performing the task in the part. We
thus calculated the values of the LF/HF responses and the
SCR responses in the whole game part and in both halves. We
performed Mann-Whitney U tests for each set of values of the
physiological indices. The numbers of samples are as follows
(part number - number of data points in the rapid increasing
section : number of other data points); the ﬁrst part - 139 :
275, the second part - 128 : 263, the third part - 145 : 246,
the fourth part - 94 : 297, the ﬁfth part - 93 : 292, the sixth
part - 134 : 250, and the seventh part - 101 : 271. The results
are shown in Table III and Table IV. In the tables, only the
p-values under 0.1 are shown easy to see. The hyphen (“-”)
means that the p-value is over 0.1. In the LF/HF responses
for the whole game part, there is a signiﬁcant difference in
the second part and a marginally signiﬁcant difference in the
ﬁfth part. In the SCR responses for the whole game part, there
are signiﬁcant differences in the ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, and seventh
parts.
Meanwhile, for the physiological responses in the ﬁrst and
second halves of the game part, the patterns of signiﬁcant
differences are different. For example, in the ﬁfth part, there is
no signiﬁcant difference in the ﬁrst half of the SCR responses.
The task of the ﬁfth part is to destroy a mid-boss enemy, and
since the behavior of the mid boss becomes complex over time,
it is reasonable that the player executes trial and error in the
second half. In the case of the second part, there is a signiﬁcant
difference only in the LF/HF responses. In the second part, the
patterns of the enemies change in the middle. Since the player
has to respond the changes reactively, it is reasonable that the
player takes care about extrinsic stimuli.
To sum up, the results suggest that we may distinguish
the task features in the skill acquisition process using the
transitions of task performance and the different patterns of
the physiological responses.

4) The differences of the physiological indices between sec-
tions where task performance decreased and others: The RIS
is a good example in the skill acquisition process. However,
task performance sometimes decreases because the learner tries
to optimize his/her behavior to the task. During optimization,
the learner mainly pays attention to how to respond to the
external stimuli. We thus expect that the values of the LF/HF
responses and the SCR responses in such a section will fall.
We refer to the section where the task performance falls into
a “Plateau Section” (PS), deﬁned as a section in which task
performance stays constant or decreases continuously for two
or more sections.
We compared the values of the LF/HF responses and the
SCR responses between the plateau sections and the other
sections. In the same way as with the RISs, we calculated
the values of the LF/HF responses and the SCR responses in
the whole game part and the two halves of the game part.
We performed Mann-Whitney U tests on each set of values of
physiological indices. The numbers of samples are as follows
(part number - number of data points in the plateau section
: number of other data points); the ﬁrst part - 242 : 172, the
second part - 218 : 173, the third part - 228 : 163, the fourth
part - 256 : 135, the ﬁfth part - 262 : 129, the sixth part - 243
: 141, and the seventh part - 249 : 123. The results are shown
in the Table V and Table VI. In the tables, only the p-values
under 0.1 are shown easy to see. The hyphen (“-”) means that
the p-value is over 0.1. Unlike the previous analysis, there is
a major difference in the patterns of the signiﬁcant differences
in the whole and the two halves of the plateau section. In the
fourth and sixth parts, there are signiﬁcant differences for the
whole plateau sections. On the other hand, in the ﬁrst and
seventh parts, there are signiﬁcant differences in the ﬁrst or
second half of the plateau sections. In addition, we can ﬁnd
more differences in the LF/HF responses than in the SCR
responses, suggesting that the learners may try to optimize
their behavior in the short subtasks in the ﬁrst and seventh
parts in the plateau section. This is supporting evidence that a
situation may arise where task performance does not increase
even when the learner acquires sub-skills.

In this study, we know the maximum game scores in each
part of the stage. Therefore, we can determine that learners
try to optimize their behavior or that they are performing
tasks through inertia. The plateau section is important because
it is the preparation phase for the skill acquisition process.
However, in terms of general skill tasks, we cannot know the
maximum performance of the endeavor. Hence, we propose
a method to identify plateau sections using task performance
and the learner’s mental state.
F. The estimation of participant’s statuses using the physio-
logical indices
As mentioned above, we can ﬁnd some signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in the sections with the feeling of difﬁculty, the
rapid increasing sections, and the plateau sections, which
suggests that the physiological indices are clues to estimate the
participant’s status in skill acquisition. Of course, other clues
are needed for accurate estimation, such as task structures,
the basic abilities of the learners, and the details of the
mental states of the learners. However, as a ﬁrst step, we try
to estimate the three states in the skill acquisition: whether
the learner feels difﬁculty in a particular part of the task,
whether a particular part of the task is a rapid increasing
section or not, and whether a particular part of the task
is a plateau section or not. To classify the states, we used
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Modeling with radial basis
function kernels. SVMs are supervised learning models. SVMs
have been introduced for solving pattern recognition problems
[22][23]. The SVM learning algorithm builds a model that
assigns new cases to a certain category or another category.
SVM is a non-probabilistic binary linear classiﬁer. SVM uses
a kernel function which maps the given data into a different
space; the separations can be made even with very complex
boundaries. The hyperplane algorithm is a way to create non-
linear classiﬁer by applying the kernel trick to maximum
margin hyperplanes.
We calculated the values of the LF/HF responses and the
SCR responses in the whole game part and the two halves. In
addition, we also calculated the values of the mean and the
standard deviation of LF/HF and SCR. To estimate the feeling
of difﬁculty, the values were calculated for each trial of the
experiment. When estimating the rapid increasing section and
the plateau section, the values of the simple moving average
(calculated from data for the previous ﬁve games and shifted
by two games) were calculated. The 18 variables were used
for SVM with radial basis function kernels. The variables
were selected by the stepwise method. In this analysis, we
performed leave-one-game-part-data-out cross validation for
SVM classiﬁcation using data from which the data of one
game part were removed. The SVM model was applied to
the data for each game part and the F-measure and accuracy
were calculated. In the following tables, each row shows the
F-measure and accuracy resulting from SVM classiﬁcation
using data from which the data for the game part for the row
were removed. For example, the data in the second row and
the fourth column of the table shows the result of applying
SVM model to the data of the fourth part, calculated using the
data from which the data for the second part were removed.
Therefore, the diagonal values are the results of the cross
validations. In the following table, the diagonal values are
displayed in a bold typeface.

1) The estimation of the feeling of difﬁculty: Table VII
and Table VIII show the results of SVM classiﬁcations. The
numbers of samples are same as in the section of “The rela-
tionship between the feeling of difﬁculty and the physiological
indices”. The diagonal values show results when the data not
used to calculate the SVM model. As a result, the values of
F-measure were over 0.6 in most cases and over 0.7 in 25/49
cases. The values of the accuracy were over 0.7 when the
data used to calculate the SVM model were classiﬁed and
over 0.65 when the data not used to calculate the SVM model
(except the data in the seventh part) were classiﬁed. The results
suggest the possibility of estimating the feeling of difﬁculty
using physiological indices.
From the results, we can ﬁnd that the F-measures are
relatively low in the data of the third part, but the accuracies
are not so low. This means that it is hard to classify the
data points in the rapid increasing section. The enemy pattern
in the third part was a little different from other part; two
enemies that has high score parallelly appeared with another
type of enemies in the part. Since, in this part, there are
some strategies to get score, the stress of the participant
was changed depending on the adopted strategy. In addition,
depending on the adopted strategy, the feeling of difﬁculty of
the participant was changed, but it was difﬁcult to identify
the adopted strategy. Therefore, we expect that the data of the
feeling of difﬁculty as scored by the experimenter included
some errors.
2) The estimation of the RIS: Table IX and Table X
show the results of SVM classiﬁcations. The numbers of
samples are same as in the section of “The differences of the

when the data not used to calculate the SVM model. As a
result, the values of the F-measure and accuracy were low
when the data not used to calculate the SVM model were
classiﬁed. The values of the F-measure and the accuracy were
over 0.5 and over 0.65, respectively, when the data used to
calculate the SVM model were classiﬁed. The results suggest
that the generalization capability was low, but that there is a

possibility of estimating the rapid increasing section using the
data used to calculate the SVM model. Of course, the values
of accuracy when the data used to calculate the SVM model
were classiﬁed were not sufﬁcient in some parts. We have to
consider more details in the participant’s mental states and the
conditions of the task.
3) The estimation of the PS: Table XI and Table XII show
the results of SVM classiﬁcations. The numbers of samples are
same as in the section of “The differences of the physiological
indices between sections where task performance decreased
and others”. The diagonal values show results when the data
not used to calculate the SVM model. As a result, the values of
the F-measure and accuracy were not so high when the data not
used to calculate the SVM model were classiﬁed. The values
of F-measure and accuracy in the plateau section were lower
than those in the rapid increasing section. One reason is that
situations in which learners try to optimize their behavior and
situations in which they are performing tasks through inertia
are mixed. More detailed teacher data are needed to improve
the classiﬁcation.
V.
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to develop a method to estimate the
learner’s skill level based on task performance and his/her
mental states. To achieve this, we conducted an experiment
to obtain data from the subjective reports of a feeling of
difﬁculty and the physiological indices during the skill acqui-
sition process. We then conﬁrmed the relationship between
the subjective reports of the feeling of difﬁculty and the
physiological indices. In addition, we suggested an approach
to identify the statuses of the skill acquisition process, e.g.,
the learner feels difﬁculty and the task performance is rapidly
increasing, via the measured physiological indices. Concretely,
we classiﬁed the trials with a feeling of difﬁculty in the
experiment using SVM. As a result, the values of accuracy
were over 0.7 when the data used to calculate the SVM model
were classiﬁed and over 0.65 when the rest of the data not
used to calculate the SVM model were classiﬁed. When we
classiﬁed the trials in the rapid increasing section, the values

of accuracy were over 0.65 when the data used to calculate
the SVM model were classiﬁed. However, when we classiﬁed
the trials in the plateau section, the values of accuracy were
low. Although we have to refer to the teacher data for more
accurate classiﬁcation, we suggest that there is a possibility of
estimating the statuses of the skill acquisition process.
In the results of the Mann-Whitney U tests, there is a differ-
ent tendency between the results for the feeling of difﬁculty
and the results of the rapid increasing and plateau sections.
In the results of the feeling of difﬁculty, the SCR response is
signiﬁcantly different in all parts of the game but the LF/HF
response is not. On the other hand, in the results of the rapid
increasing section and the plateau section, the SCR response
is not signiﬁcantly different in certain parts of the game,
while the LF/HF response is signiﬁcantly different in such
parts. During the skill acquisition process, learners execute
actions by trial and error, receive feedback, and improve their
behavior based on subjective and objective evaluations. The
learners feel difﬁculty when they evaluate their behavior after
ﬁnishing the task or sub-task and thus are not inﬂuenced by
the extrinsic stimuli in the task, i.e., their LF/HF values are
not changed. When the learners improve their behavior in real
time, they have to pay attention to the extrinsic stimuli in the
task depending on the statuses of the task, e.g., the patterns of
the enemies and whether they already have a plan to score. The
patterns of the signiﬁcant differences in the SCR and LF/HF
responses reﬂect the statuses of the task.
A comparison of the results of the Mann-Whitney U
tests and those of the SVM classiﬁcation shows that the
physiological responses showing signiﬁcant differences in the
Mann-Whitney U tests do not directly contribute to the SVM
classiﬁcation. One reason is that the distributions of the physi-
ological responses overlap between the statuses. For example,
the results for the third part in the feeling of difﬁculty show
no difference from the others, but it is difﬁcult to classify the
data for the third part using the SVM. Conversely, it is not
so difﬁcult to classify the data for the sixth part in the rapid
increasing section using the SVM, but there is no signiﬁcant
difference in the physiological responses. These suggest that

the skill acquisition of the skill task has complex processes
related to different factors and only one particular parameter
does not sufﬁce to show the status of the skill acquisition.
Meanwhile, we suggest that the multiple physiological indices
are important clues to the status of the skill acquisition process.
The most important contribution of this study is that we
experimentally analyzed the effects of the learner’s mental
states based on the physiological indices. In a traditional skill
acquisition model, the impacts of the learner’s mental states
are conceptually proposed but not conﬁrmed objectively. Of
course, our study has some limitations. The most serious
limitation was that we could not achieve sufﬁcient F-measure
and accuracy in the SVM classiﬁcation when the data not used
to calculate the SVM model were classiﬁed. One reason is that
the important points for acquiring the skill are different for
each part of the game. For example, in the third part, partic-
ipants need to pay attention to the different types of enemies
in parallel. For accurate classiﬁcation, it is an important piece
of information, which enemy was paid attention to, but such a
clue could not be included in the SVM classiﬁcation. Another
limitation was the segmentation of the task. In this research,
we segmented the game into eight parts (including the ﬁnal
boss part). However, the segmentations were not sufﬁcient for
accurate classiﬁcation, which is a task awaiting future work
on realizing a skill acquisition support system.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate
whether the statuses of the skill acquisition process could be
estimated by the physiological indices used to estimate the
learner’s mental states. For this purpose, we conducted an
experiment to obtain the data of the physiological indices and
a subjective report of the feeling of difﬁculty during the skill
acquisition task. As a result of the analysis, we conﬁrmed
the relationship between the participant’s statuses (feeling of
difﬁculty, the rapid increasing section, and the plateau section)
and the physiological indices. In addition, we classiﬁed the
trials having a feeling of difﬁculty in the experiment using
SVM. Overall, we could show that the physiological indices
are helpful clues to estimate the status of the skill acquisition
process. In future research, we will obtain more teacher data
for machine learning techniques and analyze the different
features of the skill acquisition task. In addition, we will extend
the framework of experiments to different tasks that include
the different features of the skill acquisition task.
