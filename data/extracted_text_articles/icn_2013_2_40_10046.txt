Abstract—A recently introduced impulse postﬁx OFDM (IP-
OFDM) system achieves the enhanced bit error rate (BER)
performance compared to that of conventional OFDM systems,
but there is an important peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
issue of using impulse postﬁx (IP) that needs to be resolved. This
paper proposes a combined IP-OFDM scheme with the selected
mapping technique and the optimum power boosting factor (PBF)
determination method to resolve the PAPR issue while achieving
the enhanced BER performance. In this paper, the effectiveness of
proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of the BER performance
as well as the input back-off (IBO) to high power ampliﬁer.
The analytic results show that the proposed scheme provides the
remarkable BER performance enhancement with relatively low
IBO (or PBF) rather than with high IBO (or PBF).

I. INTRODUCTION
A novel channel estimation technique for OFDM systems,
which is called as impulse postﬁx OFDM (IP-OFDM), has
recently been introduced [1], [2]. The IP-OFDM system ex-
ploits the IP, which consists of a high power impulse sample
and several zero samples at the end of a zero padded-OFDM
symbol block, to estimate channel impulse responses in time-
domain. As shown in [1], [2], the IP-OFDM system achieves
the enhanced bit error rate (BER) performance compared to
that of conventional OFDM systems. However, there is an
important peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issue, which
can degrade the BER performance of IP-OFDM systems due to
the nonlinear distortion of the IP. For this reason, an optimum
power boosting factor (PBF) determination method for IP was
proposed to avoid nonlinear distortion of IP [3]. The PBF of
IP should be decided using the CCDF and the IBO, which
are determined by HPA characteristics. It is also shown that
boosting the IP without considering these factors may degrade
the BER performance signiﬁcantly.
In this paper, we propose a combined IP-OFDM scheme
with a selected mapping (SLM) technique and the optimum
PBF determination method to resolve the PAPR issue, while
achieving the enhanced BER performance. In the scheme, the
signal with minimum PAPR is selected from the generated
multiple signals with different PAPRs and then, the optimum
PBF of IP is determined to enhance the BER performance
of the system. According to the analytic results, the proposed

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The time-domain representation of OFDM symbol with N
subcarriers can be represented as follows:
x(t) =
1
√
N
N−1
X
k=0
X[k]ej2πfkt, 0 ≤ t ≤ Ts,
(1)
where Ts is the duration of the OFDM symbol and fk =
k
Ts .
The IP-OFDM proposed in [1] is a modiﬁed OFDM system,
which adds an impulse sample and several zero samples at
the end of a zero padded-OFDM symbol [4] for time-domain
channel estimation. If we assume the length of the guard
interval is L, we can represent the time-domain IP-OFDM
symbol vector u as follows:
u = [u(0), u(1), · · · , u(N + 2L)]T
= [x, g, p]T ,
(2)
where x is the 1 × N OFDM data vector, g is the 1 × L zero
vector, p is the 1 × (L + 1) IP for channel estimation, and
T represents transpose operation. The IP, p, is composed of
an impulse sample, s, and L zeros, and can be expressed as
follows:
p = [s, 0(1×L)],
(3)
where 0(1×L) is the (1 × L) zero vector.

III. PROPOSED SCHEME
A. System Framework
The simpliﬁed block diagram for a transmitter part of the
proposed scheme is shown in Fig. 1. A SLM block and a
soft envelope limiter (SEL) are employed to obtain the signal
with the reduced PAPR and to represent the nonlinearity of
high power ampliﬁer (HPA), respectively. In the ﬁgure, X, the
input symbol of SLM, represents a QPSK/QAM modulated
baseband signal and bi , i = 1, 2, · · · , V , represents V
different phase sequences to be multiplied with X. Each phase
sequence consists of N phases, which are selected from {±1}
for simplicity. Note that the length of both X and bi are
same with the number of subcarriers N. If a signal block
X is multiplied with V different phase sequences and the
inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is applied to each
block, then V different OFDM signal blocks are generated
from one original signal block. Since the PAPR of OFDM
signal is very sensitive to phase variation, the V different
signal blocks have different PAPRs. Therefore, we can select
the signal with minimum PAPR from the generated multiple
signals with different PAPRs [5]. After that, zero samples and
IP are added to constitute IP-OFDM signal [1].
Generally, the PAPR in the digital domain is not necessarily
the same as the PAPR in the analog domain, where nonlinear
distortion due to high PAPR occurs. However, it is shown that
the PAPR in the analog domain can be closely approximated
by oversampling the signal in the digital domain [6]. Usually,
an oversampling factor D = 4 is sufﬁcient to approximate the
PAPR in the analog domain. Therefore, we can express the
PAPR of the OFDM signal as follows:
PAPR = max0≤n≤DN−1 |x(n)|2
E(|x(n)|2)
,
(4)
where E(·) denotes the expectation operator.
B. Analysis of CCDF
It is known that the CCDF(Complementary Cumulative
Distribution Function) of the SLM-OFDM signal can be
represented as follows [7]:
CCDF = P(PAPR ≥ PAPR0)
≈ (1 − (1 − e−P AP R0)αN)V ,
(5)
where α is an adjustment factor for the close approximation
of the CCDF of OFDM signal, N and V are the numbers of
subcarriers and different phase sets, respectively. As we can
see from (5), if the number of subcarriers, N, is increased, the
PAPR of OFDM signals is increased. On the other hand, if
the number of phase set, V , is increased, the PAPR of OFDM
signals is reduced as shown in Fig. 2
Fig. 3 shows the CCDF simulation results of the signal of
proposed scheme, when the randomly generated four different
phase sets V = 4 and various PBFs, p = 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 dB,
are assumed. In the simulations, we use QPSK modulation
with N = 64 subcarriers and D = 4 oversampling factor. As
shown in the ﬁgure, the PAPR of the signal of the proposed
scheme is remarkably reduced compared to that of the original
signal and a HPA that is linear up to around 8 ∼ 9dB is good
enough if allowable nonlinear distortion probability is 10−4.

Note that the actual PBF, p, needs not to be reduced because
the maximum allowable amplitude is given with the HPA in
real systems, when the PAPR of OFDM signals is reduced.
To represent the nonlinearity of HPA, the SEL, which is
equivalent to Rapp’s SSPA model with an inﬁnity smoothness
factor [8], is employed. With the input signal x(n), the output
signal ˆx(n) of the SEL can be represented as follows [6]:
ˆx(n) =
 x(n),
|x(n)| ≤ Amax
Amaxejφ(n),
|x(n)| > Amax
(6)
where Amax is the maximum allowable amplitude without
distortion and φ(n) is the phase of the input signal.
In [3], it is shown that the PBF of IP should be carefully
determined with two criteria, the CCDF of signal and the value
of IBO deﬁned as follows [9]:
IBO(dB) = 10 log10
 A2
0
Pin

,
(7)
where A0 is the maximum allowable input amplitude and Pin
is the average input power of the OFDM signal before going
through the HPA. In the SEL, Amax is equivalent to A0, which
is the maximum allowable amplitude in the HPA, and is ﬁxed
regardless of the PAPR of the input signals. As shown in
[3], therefore, the optimum PBF of IP can be determined as
the same value of IBO, where the amplitude of the impulse
sample is the same with Amax(= A0). That is, even though
the PAPR of OFDM signals is reduced by the SLM technique,
the optimum PBF is same with IBO, as is without the SLM
technique.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Fig. 4 shows the BER performance of the proposed scheme
over the frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel with 8-
taps exponential power delay proﬁle, where the parameters are
set as N=64 subcarriers, L = 16 guard interval, 16QAM, four
different values of IBO=2, 3, 4, 5dB with the optimum PBF,
p(= IBO), and V =1(w/o SLM), 4, 8. We assume perfect SLM
side information at the receiver. As shown in the ﬁgure, we
can enhance the BER performance of IP-OFDM by increasing
V in the SLM technique at the low IBO. Note that the BER
performance is remarkably enhanced by increasing V 1 to
8 at IBO=2, 3. However, the effect of SLM is signiﬁcantly
reduced at the high IBO=4, 5.
This is because the effect of OFDM PAPR reduction for
HPA is reduced as increasing IBO. Note that the power
efﬁciency of HPA, which is another system constraint, is
degraded as increasing the IBO to the HPA.

V. CONCLUSION
A combined IP-OFDM scheme with the SLM technique
and the optimum PBF determination method is proposed to
resolve the PAPR issue, while achieving the enhanced BER
performance. The analytic results show that the proposed
scheme can provides the remarkable BER performance en-
hancement with relatively low IBO. On the other hand, the
BER performance can be enhanced by increasing the IBO at
the cost of degradation of the power efﬁciency of HPA. As a
future work, a practical IP-OFDM system with a nonlinear
HPA will be considered and the impact of nonlinear HPA
on the determination of the PBF of IP as well as the BER
performance will be analyzed.
