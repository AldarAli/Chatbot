Abstract—Over the past years, implementation of and research 
on cloud computing in the eGovernment context have increased 
substantially. A wide range of benefits and challenges is 
suggested in the literature. However, these suggestions appear 
fragmented and disconnected and do not offer a clear overview 
of the main challenges and benefits. Therefore, there is a need 
for clarification about both benefits and challenges of cloud 
computing, especially in the eGovernment context. To address 
this need, the literature on cloud computing and eGovernment 
is reviewed in this paper. The findings show that despite the 
extensive number of benefits and challenges, some stand out 
from the rest. This paper presents an overview of these, explains 
them in detail, and suggests avenues for further research.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Governments and public organizations in both developed 
and 
developing 
countries 
are 
increasingly 
adopting 
eGovernment solutions throughout their service portfolios 
[1][2]. Most often, eGovernment services are provided 
through the Internet [3][4]. While eGovernment services show 
substantial potential related to increased efficiency and 
effectiveness, there are also considerable challenges in 
transitioning to digital services. The challenges discussed in 
the eGovernment context are often related to investment and 
development costs [1], insufficient Information Technology 
(IT) skills [5], the lack of compatibility and shared standards 
[3], and the lack of compatible infrastructure [3]. These 
obstacles are especially challenging for developing countries 
[6][7]. A proposed solution to several of these challenges is to 
adopt cloud computing to support eGovernment [4][8]-[10]. 
Today, the existing literature outlines a plethora of 
possible benefits and challenges in relation to cloud 
computing and eGovernment. However, the literature does not 
present an accessible overview of what the main benefits are 
and how challenging the adoption of cloud solutions can be. 
This paper's objectives are to identify 1) the benefits and 
2) the challenges, both associated with cloud computing in the 
eGovernment context. 
To address the objectives, the following research 
questions are formulated: 
1. What are the main benefits of cloud computing in 
eGovernment? 
2. What are the main challenges of cloud computing in 
eGovernment? 
These questions are addressed by performing a systematic 
review of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the use of 
cloud computing in eGovernment.  
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section II 
describes the use of cloud computing in the eGovernment 
domain and explores possible implications for its use in public 
service provision. Section III presents the methodology for the 
literature analysis. Section IV explains the results of the 
analysis. Section V discusses the findings, providing answers 
to the two research questions. Finally, Section VI presents the 
conclusion and several suggestions for further research. 
II. 
CLOUD AND EGOVERNMENT 
As a theme in conjunction with the government, cloud 
computing emerged in 2009 [11], where the exploration of 
implementation [12][13] and associated key issues [14] were 
studied. The potential use of cloud computing technologies in 
eGovernment was supported by Cellary and Strykowski [15], 
who recommended cloud infrastructure as the default solution 
for digital public services generally. Cloud adoption by the 
government has been studied repeatedly [9][16]. On this basis, 
Mohammed et al. [17] suggested an eGovernment cloud 
adoption model that would list the factors contributing to the 
adoption of the technology in public service. 
Cloud computing is perceived as a possible solution to the 
challenges that governments face regarding the dramatic 
increase in computational data [13]. The Internet of Things 
(IoT) devices collect significant amounts of data, especially in 
the smart city context. Sensors collect environmental data, 
with the potential to be used for evidence-based decisions,

increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and responsiveness of 
public 
services 
[18]. 
E-participation 
platforms, 
crowdsourcing, and social media mining also contribute to the 
increase in the data collected by governments. However, due 
to its properties (complexity, heterogeneity, and volume), Big 
Data cannot be efficiently analyzed using traditional methods 
[19]. Cloud computing can provide the necessary storage and 
computational capacities [18][20] to store and analyze very 
large volumes of data. In this regard, cloud computing is 
considered one of the crucial components of the realization of 
smart cities, usually viewed in combination with IoT [21]-
[23], providing the necessary capacities and aiding in 
automated decision making [24]. 
In Gartner's latest overview of the top trend hype cycle for 
digital government [25], cloud computing is identified as a 
growing hype. The European Union (EU) explicitly mentions 
cloud computing in Agenda 2020, underlining its importance 
and estimating that the European cloud market would reach 
€44.8 bn by 2020 [26]. Following the recommendations of the 
European Commission's Cloud Strategy 2012 [27], many EU 
countries have developed their own national cloud strategies 
[28]. However, only a few countries have backed up these 
strategies with the development of their government cloud 
infrastructure to support public administration, with several 
notable exceptions, such as the UK, Spain, and Denmark 
[29][30].

METHODOLOGY 
Any literature review relies on systematic, rigorous, and 
well-established methods to help avoid cherry picking, biases, 
and a poor selection of relevant literature. Otherwise, the 
sample would likely not contain an accurate overview of 
existing knowledge and would therefore be of limited 
scientific value [31]. This review is based on Okoli [32] and 
 
Figure 1. Literature review process. 
 
Figure 2. Literature per year. 
 
Webster and Watson [33] methods, whose goal is to identify 
and analyze relevant literature to answer this present study's 
research questions. 
To explore the research questions and identify existing 
knowledge in the literature, the following search queries were 
used: ("cloud computing") AND ("e-government" OR 
"eGovernment" OR "electronic government").  
Three databases were searched for relevant articles: 
Scopus, Web of Science, and Digital Government Reference 
Library (DGRL). The DGRL is a highly regarded EndNote 
library consisting of over 10,299 references of peer-reviewed 
publications in the domains of digital government/governance 
and digital democracy. 
Additionally, we applied the following inclusion criteria: 
1) contain the search phrases based on the research questions 
and 2) be peer reviewed and published in journals or 
conference proceedings. The exclusion criteria required 
discarding the articles that were 1) irrelevant to the research 
objectives, 2) not in English, and 3) not offered for download 
or otherwise inaccessible. This process yielded a literature 
sample of 51 articles (Figure 1). The articles were published 
between 2011 and 2018 (Figure 2).

RESULTS 
A. Benefits of Cloud Computing 
The studies discussing cloud computing in eGovernment 
settings report a number of benefits. Some benefits are studied 
in depth, while others are superficially mentioned. Out of the 
51  papers,  46  mention  benefits  to  some  extent. In total, 49

benefits are identified in the first round of analysis. In the 
second iteration, some of the benefits found in the first round 
are grouped together, resulting in 32 distinct benefits.  
A pie chart (Figure 3) illustrates the relative proportions of 
the papers that focus on each benefit and how focused they 
are. Table I (Appendix) lists the benefits and the associated 
literature, where three benefits stand out: cost reduction, 
security, and flexibility and scalability. 
B. Challenges of Cloud Computing 
Our analysis indicates differences in the extent to which 
the various challenges are studied. In total, 38 papers include 
discussions on cloud computing challenges. A total of 54 
challenges were identified in the first iteration. A second 
iteration of the analysis resulted in 34 distinct challenges. 
Similar to the benefits, a pie chart (Figure 4) illustrates the 
relative proportions of the papers that focus on each challenge 
and how focused they are. Table II (Appendix) lists the 
challenges and the associated literature. The challenges that 
stand out are security issues, costs, and complexity. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
In this section, the findings from our analytical efforts are 
summarized and discussed, focusing on benefits and 
challenges. 
Of the 51 papers reviewed, only seven use theories in their 
research. This indicates a lack of theoretical development in 
the eGovernment field in relation to cloud computing. 
A. Benefits of Cloud Computing 
Of the 32 identified benefits, cost reduction, security, and 
flexibility and scalability are mentioned much more 
frequently in the literature than the rest. Therefore, these three 
benefits are further explored. 
1) Cost reduction 
Cost reduction is a key driver for public organizations 
considering migrating to cloud solutions [1][8][34]. Of the 51 
papers, 38 suggest cost reduction as an advantage for public 
agency use of cloud computing. Costs relating to the purchase 
and the installation of information and communication 
technology equipment, software, and infrastructure can be 
greatly reduced [1][7][11][28][35]. Public organizations can  
also upgrade or downgrade their capacities as needed and pay 
only 
for 
the 
resources 
used 
(economy 
of 
scale) 
[10][11][36][37]. Several researchers believe that human 
resource costs can be reduced as well [10][11]. Savings on 
software licenses can also occur, especially when using open 
source programs [10][38]. By purchasing large quantities of 
hardware and software, cloud service providers can offer more 
economical solutions. Opportunities, such as the creation of 
server parks near power stations, affordable sites, and so on, 
can also contribute to lower costs [10]. A study estimates that 
government agencies would save between 50% and 67% of 
eGovernment operation costs by moving governmental 
applications into private or public clouds [28]. For example, 
the governments of the UK and Spain use cloud computing to 
reduce costs [28][29].  
2) Security 
Security is regarded as the largest obstacle to public 
organizations' deployment of cloud computing, but several 
researchers suggest substantial security benefits. Security can 
be 
improved 
with 
centralized 
security 
management 
[10][39][40]. Public organizations with one centralized 
system instead of silo structures can provide security 
enhancements [10]. Cloud computing can also offer backup 
solutions (e.g., use cloud storage to upload the backup or the 
supplier's own backup and disaster recovery solutions), which 
will likewise satisfy the requirements of off-site storage in 
different locations [39]. Restoration and recovery can be 
performed swiftly [39]. Private cloud solutions with stricter 
security are more appropriate for governments than public 
cloud solutions [6]. Cloud-based solutions for security have 
been developed, for instance, "identity in the cloud," which is 
an authentication service based on cloud technology [41]. 
3) Flexibility and scalability 
Flexibility and scalability are benefits of cloud computing 
in the eGovernment context [1][28][29][35][38]-[40][42]-
[44]. The pay-as-you-go pricing model allows an instrument 
of scaling, depending on user demand [5][28][42], thereby 
achieving flexibility in the form of rapid elasticity 
[6][37][43]. This especially allows an increased number of 
users, user loads, and applications [1][11]. This is possible 
due to virtualization technologies [45], where nodes can be 
seamlessly added to the public organizations' resource pools 
[10]. Public organizations can control these scaling options 
without interfering with suppliers or humans [2][40]. These 
options can even be fully automated [10]. Cloud computing 
also offers access to applications and stored data, anytime and 
anywhere [39]. Cloud computing has massive storage 
capabilities [11]. Denmark benefited from cloud computing 
scalability during the World Climate Conference in 2009, 
where the expectation of high load peaks made the use of 
traditional solutions unsustainable [28]. Cloud computing 
suppliers typically offer flexible contract terms to ensure 
scalability [39]. 
4) Other benefits 
Interestingly, several authors argue that cloud computing 
offers environmental benefits because of enhanced efficiency 
of resources and less consumption of power [1][6][11][42].

Payment models (e.g., pay-as-you-go) may offer 
considerable benefits as the current climate of economic 
difficulties 
affects 
government 
budgets 
worldwide 
[5][7][28][39]. 
B. Challenges of Cloud Computing 
Security issues, costs, and complexity are the most 
frequently mentioned challenges, especially security issues 
(Figure 4). These three challenges are further explored in the 
following subsections. 
1) Security issues 
Many studies highlight security as the main issue or one of 
the most critical challenges for adopting cloud computing in 
eGovernment [2][11][28][29][35][38][45]. Security risks 
associated with cloud computing are prominent in 
eGovernment systems [28][46]. This situation can create trust 
issues [38][46] that in turn can lead to adoption barriers 
[9][43]. This matter is crucial for national security [11]. 
Public organizations transfer much of the security control to 
cloud computing suppliers, which leads to the government’s 
reduced ability to control data [4][6][37] and therefore 
requires complete trust [34]. By using cloud computing, 
public organizations store their data in the cloud, resulting in 
the challenge of protecting the data [28]. Data that are not 
kept in the government's premises and are therefore under 
less control might lead to concerns about unauthorized access 
and misuse [2].  
Moreover, data privacy law enforcement is not globally 
uniform [6]. Most governments have data protection 
regulations that do not allow storage of sensitive data in other 
countries, where cloud computing suppliers offer international 
mirrored sites for data storage [1]. It is difficult to check 
whether the cloud computing suppliers fulfill their promises 
of protection and storage of sensitive data [2]. High data 
encryption is therefore recommended [2]. It is also important 
to implement proper access control, authentication, and 
authorization [47][48]. There is the need for auditing as well, 
which is another challenge in cloud computing systems. In 
countries where cloud computing systems are based on public 
clouds, shifting to private clouds might help overcome this 
challenge [28]. Other mentioned challenges are users' use of 
e-payment systems [38] and cloud-based e-voting [6]. All of 
the above issues require physical security (data and 
information stored in a secure location) and logical security 
(protection from threats, such as hacking, intrusion, and 
viruses) [2]. Cloud computing suppliers are starting to support 
governments' security requirements. One example is Fabasoft, 
a supplier that offers secure authentication, supporting the 
national eID systems of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland 
[28]. 
2) Cost 
Several studies highlight cost as a crucial challenge 
[2][4][9][29][49]. This is somewhat confusing, given that cost 
reduction is viewed as the main benefit of adopting cloud 
computing solutions. Alkhwaldi, Kamala and Qahwaji [46] 
highlights high maintenance and operational costs. High costs 
may also be related to security solutions. Some studies also 
cite the higher costs associated with activities aimed at 
preventing lock-in (being dependent on one cloud supplier, 
with difficulty in changing the supplier or the solutions) 
[2][4]. Other challenges for cloud computing can be hiring IT 
experts, facilitation of network requirements, adoption costs, 
and government budgets allocated for cloud computing [9]. 
3) Complexity 
Several studies emphasize complexity as a major 
challenge, which adversely affects the adoption of cloud 
solutions [8][34], thus hindering the realization of the 
benefits [39]. Complexity also contributes to user 
dissatisfaction [39]. The lack of standards for cloud 
computing often leads to problems surrounding its adoption 
or difficulties in changing suppliers (of cloud services) [1]. 
Cloud service providers might also procure their services 
through a third party and therefore increase the risks of chain 
failure and interruption of cloud services [2]. 
4) Other challenges 
One notable challenge is the potential lack of the IT experts 
required to manage cloud computing [9]. This issue is 
interesting because of the finding that one of the drivers of 
the migration to cloud computing is reducing the need for IT 
expertise. It is also interesting that despite the research 
indicating an expected increase in performance [40], another 
study reports concerns related to under-performance [4]. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This study has aimed to explore and understand the 
phenomenon of cloud computing in the eGovernment 
context. To this end, we adopted a literature review approach, 
collecting and analyzing 51 relevant research articles and 
discussed cloud computing in the digital government domain. 
Our analysis identified 32 distinct benefits of cloud 
computing in eGovernment. Of the 32 benefits, cost 
reduction, security, and flexibility and scalability are the most 
prominent. Among the 34 distinct challenges identified, those 
related to security are by far the most frequently mentioned 
in the reviewed literature. No consensus has been reached 
about the cost benefit of moving to cloud solutions as costs 
are mentioned among both benefits and challenges of the 
cloud technology. 
The limitations of this study include the choice of search 
terms (some related terms can also be included in the search) 
and the selection of databases. Some challenges and benefits 
are possibly better described in the more general computer 
science literature, while remaining applicable to the 
eGovernment domain. 
Nonetheless, we believe this review offers a useful 
overview of the use of cloud computing in eGovernment. It 
can be a starting point for more in-depth research on the 
applications of this technology for the provision of public 
services.
