Abstract—Our study focuses on the demography of the largest 
European social network VK and the representativeness of VK 
population sample with respect to the real-world state 
demography. The relationships between the variables, such as 
region code, settlement type, age and gender are explored. A 
special-purpose tool has been developed for ethnic group 
labeling purposes, which performs the classification given the 
user forename, patronymic and/or surname and ensures 99.2% 
accuracy. The analysis of the considered variables is helpful in 
finding a solution to the cold start problem in recommender 
systems. 
Keywords- internet sociology; internet demography; internet 
surveys; social network analysis. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Scientists and politicians are concerned about the 
accuracy of traditional sociology's methods (questionnaires). 
Traditional polls are no longer a gold standard for the 
evaluation of politicians activity, elections outcome 
prediction and studies of voters' preferences. Predictions 
failed for the US 2016 elections, events in Israel, U.K. and 
Greece last year, Scottish independence referendum and US 
congress elections of 2014 [2]. As for the Internet surveys, 
the initial confidence in the accuracy of their methods was 
replaced by doubts about their consistency, mainly because 
(i) Internet demography differs from the real-world one, and 
(ii) demographies of different Internet segments vary 
significantly from one another, e.g., as of 2008, the Facebook 
audience was dominated by young white people from 
middle-class families, while MySpace was represented 
mainly by Afro-Americans [4]. Taking into account the 
discrepancies between the Internet demography and the real-
world demography allows us to perform a more efficient 
study of potential customers, voters, patients and others on 
the Web and to apply the results to real-world situations. 
Our study considers 239.044.903 user profiles of the 
largest 
European 
online 
social 
networking 
service 
VKontakte (VK) [28], whose average daily audience equals 
to 64.525.950. The study includes the following stages: (i) 
data collection via VK Open Application Programming 
Interface (API) [29]; (ii) filtering; (iii) user location 
identification using the Federal Information Address System 
(FIAS); (iv) analyzing the relationship between the variables: 
region code, settlement type, age and gender; (v) developing 
the ethnic group classifier for further use of the 
corresponding variable.   
Current results include 1) the analysis of the age 
distribution of VK users across regions and settlement types, 
and 2) the analysis of the gender distribution of VK users 
across regions and settlement types. A tool for ethnic group 
labeling of target users has been developed and validated, so 
that the ethnic group feature can be further processed. An 
important application of our study of Social Network (SN) 
users demographics is to improve user profiling and mitigate 
the problem of the cold start in recommender systems (how 
to recommend a movie to see or a product to buy to new 
users with no history of activities).     
The paper is organized as follows. Section II overviews 
the state of the art in the domain. Section III considers data 
gathering, filtering and description. In Section IV, the 
analysis of the obtained data is covered. Section V outlines 
the tool for ethnic group labeling and Section VI concludes 
the paper. 
II. 
RELATED WORK   
Among papers dealing with the study of Facebook and 
other English-speaking SN population are the works by 1) J. 
Chang et al. [5] on the study of ethnic groups represented in 
the SN, 2) P. Corbett [6] on Facebook demographic groups, 
3) T. Strayhorn [23] on gender differences in the use of 
Facebook and Myspace by first-year college students. 
Twitter data has been widely used for quantitative 
measurement and prediction of real-world events including 
prediction of the price level in the stock market [3], 
sentiment analysis of brands [21], prediction of movie 
revenues [1], earthquake prediction [20], and prediction of 
election outcomes [14] [27]. A large number of these 
predictions turned out to be inaccurate, which leads to the 
following questions: (i) Is Twitter population representative 
enough? (ii) In case it is, in which segments? Since Twitter-
based predictions are considered to allow for a better 
understanding of real-world events and phenomena, Twitter 
sample should be representative to a certain extent: e.g., 
young people tweet far more often than older people, 
therefore, the corresponding part of the population is better 
represented. In any case, SN data analysis can be fruitful 
only if the SN demography data is approached scientifically.  
One of the first papers on Twitter demography published 
by A. Mislove et al. [13] asked the following questions: (i) 
Who are Twitter users? (ii) To which extent the Twitter 
profile collection is representative of the whole population of 
the country? The authors undertook the first steps to explore

the Twitter dataset that covers over 1% of the US population. 
A comparative study of the Twitter population and the real-
world one was conducted based on 3 criteria: location, 
gender, race. It was shown that the SN population is non-
uniformly distributed: densely populated regions are 
represented redundantly, while underpopulated regions 
representation is scarce. Moreover, the male population 
prevails on Twitter and results in a non-random sample. 
Twitter has been selected as an example of social 
platform, because, as opposed to the users of other SNs, 91% 
of Twitter users made their profile and communication 
history visible to non-registered users. At the moment, 
Twitter data use is the only possibility to perform a free 
large-scale study of particular features of the communication 
and information exchange. The investigation of the Twitter 
platform started quite a long time ago and is being 
considered promising, however, there remain questions on 
the sufficiency of the representation of demographic groups 
in the sample. To compare Twitter data to the US Census 
2000 data, users were mapped to their location (districts).  
In [22], it was found out that most UK Twitter users 
prefer to indicate hobbies instead of their job. The authors 
explain it by the fact that the creative sector on Twitter is 
represented by an excessive number of users, as compared to 
the Census 2011 data. The tool for the automatic extraction 
of data on user age, developed by the authors, allowed to 
find out that, according to proportions, Twitter is dominated 
by young population as opposed to the Census 2011 data. 
However, in view of the predicted values, there is a 
significant number of older twitters. The study has shown 
that there is a way to extract the data on age and occupation 
of Twitter users from metadata with varying accuracy that 
depends particularly on professional groups. 
III. 
DATA  
A. Collection 
For the purposes of our study, 239 044 903 profiles from 
VK social network are considered. The data is accessed via 
VK Open API and collected using an in-house Python-based 
crawler. The gathered data is stored as JavaScript Object 
Notation (JSON) in a Hadoop cluster (HDFS) [11]. The 
processing is done using Apache Spark framework for in-
memory cluster computing together with Hive data 
warehouse software [12]. 
B. Filtering 
The following account types are excluded to sort out 
reliable data on the population of the considered social 
network: groups, deactivated accounts, fake accounts, and 
profiles, where no current city and/or no date of birth are 
indicated. 
C. Description 
As a result of data collection and filtering, two arrays are 
built. The first array in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) 
format contains 29.053 lines with the following information 
on VK population: location name, number of VK users, 
number of women among VK users, number of men among 
VK users, region code, location type (town, settlement or 
other). The second array in CSV format contains 1.048.576 
lines with the following information on VK population: 
location name, age, number of VK users of this age, region 
code, location type.  
The data was being collected during December 2015 for 
83 regions, including the Moscow Region. The city of 
Moscow will be considered independently for comparison 
purposes in our future work. The information on user 
location is extracted from the ”Current city” field in the 
general information section of user personal profiles. In the 
present work, we perform a comparison with the real 
demography (data from the official Federal State Statistics 
Service (Rosstat) statistics as of January 2015). 
Each of the resulting nodes (non-fake profiles) is 
described by certain attributes, such as age, gender, 
settlement type, etc., that differ in format and dimensions. 
The majority of these attributes can be used for opinion 
mining, decision making in recommender systems, etc.. The 
main questions are: (i) how to evaluate the quality of these 
attributes? (ii) how to efficiently use them? To answer these 
questions, it is crucial to use the topology of the network 
where the given nodes live and communicate. We build a 
model, which, however imperfect, provides a high-resolution 
picture of the behavior of a large number of nodes (people). 
To evaluate the quality of attributes, the preferential 
connectivity coefficient is estimated: if nodes having a 
certain attribute connect more often, this attribute is 
considered useful. Attributes can be effectively used to study 
the structure of massive networks as it is shown in [24], 
where a method is introduced that automatically creates a 
network of overlapping clusters, from the largest to the 
smallest, up to a threshold of term frequencies that is used to 
detect the similarity of interests. 
D. Filtering 
The following account types are excluded to sort out 
reliable data on the population of the considered social 
network: groups, deactivated accounts, fake accounts, and 
profiles, where no current city and/or no date of birth are 
indicated. 
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
The analysis is based on two types of the collected data: 
1) gender distribution of users across regions and settlement 
types (49.334.562 users) and 2) age distribution of users 
across regions and settlement types (41.236.001 users). The 
information on the location of users is aligned with the FIAS 
data. The parameters of the above samples have the 
following differences. The first sample (gender distribution) 
includes the total number of users, the number of men, the 
number of women, the number of the region according to the 
Constitution and the settlement type corresponding to each 
of the settlements, where 83 regions and 35 settlement types 
are covered. The sample does not include the city of 
Moscow, Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. The sample 
includes the city of Baikonur - one of the territories serviced 
by the Administration of secure facilities under the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs (No. 94 according to the Constitution and 
26

No. 99 in our database). The second sample includes such 
parameters as age, the number of users of a given age, the 
number of the region according to the Constitution and the 
settlement type corresponding to each of the settlements, 
where 83 regions and 45 settlement types are covered. This 
sample does not include the city of Baikonur, the Republic of 
Crimea and Sevastopol.  
The distribution of VK users among regions is presented 
in Figures 1 and 2. The plot is divided into two parts for 
visual clarity. The values are sorted from the smallest to the 
largest. The first plot is built in arithmetic scale (absolute 
values of the number of users), the second plot is built in 
logarithmic scale (the difference between the minimum and 
the maximum values in this area is over 8 millions). The 
fewest number of users (44) has been registered in the region 
defined by the number 99 in our database, which 
corresponds to Baikonur, a city leased from Kazakhstan until 
2050. VK population under 10.000 has been registered in the 
following constituent regions: 33 - Vladimir Oblast (2148), 
79 - Jewish Autonomous Oblast (2553), 6 - Republic of 
Ingushetia (6858).  
The values change by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the 
range from 12.348 (87 - Chukotka Autonomous Okrug) to 
262.389 (89 - Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug). 
Figure 2 shows the demography of VK for the other 42 
regions. The values change by one order of magnitude in the 
interval from 275.411 (40 - Kaluga Oblast) to 2.740.984 (66 
- Sverdlovsk Oblast). The maximum value (8.377.856) is 
observed for Saint Petersburg (78). 
 
Figure 1.  Distribution of the number of VK users among the constituent 
regions of the Russian Federation. 
The real demography data has been taken from the 
Rosstat website [18]. The most recent statistics on the 
number of residents per region that can be accessed via the 
online Rosstat service reflects the situation as of January 1 of  
2015, which allows us to perform the comparison with the 
data collected by our research group in December 2015. The 
results of the comparison of VK users distribution and the 
real Russian population distribution among the constituent 
regions are presented in Figures 3 and 4. These figures are 
parts of one plot. The first part describes data for the first 42 
regions and the second part describes the remaining 40 
regions, for a total of 82. The comparison is made for 82 
regions, because Rosstat does not provide statistics for leased 
territories (Baikonur city). Moreover, the number of users in 
Baikonur is low (44). The comparison shows that, for most 
regions, the number of social network users is lower than the 
number of residents. For 30% of regions the number of 
registered users is the lowest (less than 10% of residents), as 
it is shown in Table I. 
Furthermore, a relatively low number of VK users (under 
20%) as compared to the number of residents is observed in 
the following constituent regions, as shown in Table II:

The number of users in Moscow Oblast is quite low, 
according to the gathered data, probably because Moscow 
Oblast residents work and spend most of their time in the 
city of Moscow, so they prefer to specify ”Moscow” as their 
current city. The situation will become clearer when we 
analyze the VK population in the city of Moscow. 
In the following regions, the majority of residents have 
VK profiles: 3 - Republic of Buryatia (89.82%), 10 - 
Republic of Karelia (83.78%), 18 - Udmurt Republic 
(86.64%), 48 - Lipetsk Oblast (77.02%), 54 - Novosibirsk 
Oblast (75.83%). 
The above considered regions, where we observe the 
excess of real demography statistics values, are situated in 
the Northwestern Federal District. Vologda Oblast is a 
highly industrialized region, where one of the largest 
metallurgical plants of the country (Severstal) is located. The 
metallurgical industry is followed by chemical, food (center 
of butter industry), timber and machine building industries. 
Also, salt production, glass making and textile industries are 
well developed. 
Figure 2 shows the demography of VK for the other 42 
regions. The values change by one order of magnitude in the 
interval from 275.411 (40 - Kaluga Oblast) to 2.740.984 (66 
- Sverdlovsk Oblast). The maximum value (8.377.856) is 
observed for Saint Petersburg (78).

regions to the official Rosstat statistics as of January 1st, 2015 (1). 
 
Figure 3.  Comparison of the distribution of VK population through 
regions to the official Rosstat statistics as of January 1st, 2015 (2). 
Murmansk Oblast is the home of one of the largest 
Russian ports; therefore, the fishing industry is well 
developed here. These regions afford good job opportunities, 
they are always in need of qualified human resources. 
Having these circumstances in mind, the excess in the 
number of users compared to that of real residents can be 
partially explained by the possible recent movement of 
people corresponding to the indicated percentage of VK 
users to their new workplaces, which is why they have not 
yet been officially registered. As for Saint Petersburg, these 
users can be among those, who reside in this constituent 
region without a temporary residence permit nor an official 
workplace. Moreover, residents of Leningrad Oblast may 
have indicated ”Saint Petersburg” in their current city field, 
because most of them work and spend most of their time 
there. Also, users may have selected Saint Peterburg, 
because they plan to move there in the nearest future and/or 
they do it on purpose to attract attention from other users. 
The distribution of VK users according to the settlement 
(locality) type is presented in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8. Figure 5 
shows the extent to which urban population prevails over 
that of other settlement types (46.803.588 citizens against 
2.530.974 (5.13%) in rural settlements, Cossack villages, 
mountain villages and other). 
In Figure 6, the VK population in a range of settlements 
is presented, where cities and settlement types with 
population under one thousand users are excluded for visual 
clarity. The standard notation for settlement types is 
transliterated (sl - sloboda, kp - health resort settlement, 
gorodok - community area, st and zd/d st - train station, aul - 
mountain village, u - ulus (administrative division of the 
Sakha Republic), np - inhabited locality (settlement), kh - 
khutor (a type of rural locality in Eastern Europe), st-tsa - 
Cossack village, rp - workers’ settlement, p - settlement, pgt 
- small town, d - small village, s - big village).  
 
Figure 4.  VK users distribution according to settlement type. 
 
Figure 5.  VK social network population distribution across different 
settlement types. 
Population values for settlement types between sloboda 
and khutor change smoothly from 1427 to 15113. In the 
khutor - big village, the interval population values change 
drastically from 15113 to 985069.

Figures 7 and 8 show VK population values for all of the 
considered settlement types in logarithmic scale, organized 
from the smallest to the largest. The standard notation of 
settlement types is used (the list of settlement types can be 
found in [19]. The notation is as follows: s/a - rural 
administration, zh/d op - railway station, sh - highway, zh/d 
post - railway post, zh/d rzd - railway junction, s/o - rural 
okrug, r-n - district, dp - suburban settlement, s/s - rural 
council, p/o - post office, p/st - settlement near a railway 
station. The lowest population has been registered for the 
following settlement types: s/a - 1 user, zh/d op - 3 users, 
zh/d post - 4 users, sh - 4 users. In the s/a - p/o interval the 
population grows by 3 orders of magnitude to 628 users 
(p/o).  
Furthermore, in the p/st - bv range it changes by 3 orders 
of magnitude from 675 to 985069 users. So, the leading 
settlement types as to the number of VK users are (in 
descending order) city, big village, small village, small town, 
settlement, workers’ settlement, Cossack village.

A. Gender 
Gender distribution of VK users across regions is 
depicted in Figures 9 and 10 (percentage ratio). The number 
of men is marked with blue color, the number of women - 
with orange color. According to the obtained data, in 19 out 
of 82 regions most users indicated gender in their profiles

In 40 of the considered regions, over 50% of users are 
men. Region 99 (Baikonur city) cannot be taken into account 
in the gender analysis, because only 44 users are registered 
there as of December 2015 and 30 of them are men. The 
lowest number of male users has been observed in Yamalo-
Nenets Autonomous Okrug 83 (46.34%). Also, this value is 
lower in the following constituent regions: 6 - Republic of 
Ingushetia (68.14%), 5 - Republic of Dagestan (68.35%), 20 
- Chechen Republic (74.03%). In 58 regions there are less 
than 50% of female users. The highest number of female 
users (53.65%) resides in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous 
Okrug (83). In the following constituent regions women 
constitute less than 30% of users: 15 - North Osetia Republic 
(24.62%), 64 - Saratov Oblast (24.80%), 20 - Chechen 
Republic (25.29%), 51 - Murmansk Oblast (25.98%), 48 - 
Lipetsk Oblast (26.23%), 68 - Tambov Oblast (26.43%), 56 - 
Orenburg Oblast (26.46%), 18 - Udmurt Oblast (27.64%), 3 - 
Republic of Buryatia (28.12%), 74 - Chelyabinsk Oblast 
(29.79%), 63 - Samara Oblast (29.88%). According to the 
processed data on VK demography, the number of men in 
this social network is 3.970.836 higher than the number of 
women. 
B. Age 
The following account types are excluded to sort out 
reliable data on the population of the considered social 
network: groups, deactivated accounts, fake accounts, and 
profiles, where no current city and/or no date of birth are 
indicated. 
 
Figure 10.  Age distribution of VK users across regions. 
Age distribution of VK social network users across 
regions is shown in Figure 11. Most users are from 15 to 33 
years old. The peaks are achieved at age 26 (2.145.219) and 
28 (2.031.442). In what follows, the higher the age value, the 
lower the number of users. However, there is an unusual 
maximum at the age of 96. Most probably, users chose this 
age at random. 
A comparison with Rosstat data has been conducted (see 
Figures 12 and 13).  
It is important to note that the VK  sample includes only 
those users whose profiles contain age data. The sum of all 
users that show (or fake) their age constitutes 41.236.001, 
while the sum of all Russian Federation residents with the 
age attribute recorded in Rosstat database is 121.861.482. 
The comparison shows that the main maximums stay close 
for both samples: the majority of users/residents are of ages 
26-28. According to Rosstat calculations, the number of 
residents of age 27 is the highest (2.607.083). Also, there are 
over 2 million residents with the age values 23-42, 44 and 
51-60 in Russian Federation. Only two age values exceed 2 
million users (26 and 28 years old) and the age 
corresponding to the most VK users is 26 (2.145.219 users).

According to the processed data for the second sample, 
the amount of urban VK population is significantly lower 
than that of rural population (Figure 14). In general, urban 
population equals to 30.81% and rural population - to 
69.19% of the total population (41.236.001 users). Values 
are in the range from 28.67% (17 years) to 39.21% (82 
years), the average value is 32.51%. It turns out that the least 
number of users of age 17 live in towns/cities and over 40% 
of users at the age of 82 are urban citizens as well. 
Surprisingly, the same ratio is observed for all of the 
considered ages (15-110). Since we have been expecting the 
opposite results, there will be another iteration of data 
collection process to build a new age distribution across 
different settlement types. A detailed examination of the 
sample gives us an idea on the origins of these results. Only 
316 out of 1114 towns and cities of the Russian Federation 
(data as of January 1st, 2015[31]) form part of our sample. 
The complete list of towns and cities has been taken from 
[16]. When comparing the lists, we have found out that our 
automatically created list of town/city names includes wrong 
entries that probably refer to some areas/objects (district, 
street, metro station, etc.) inside a town/city or suburban 
area, such as ”Roshcha”, ”Malaya”, ”Yuzhnaya”, ”Yuzhny”, 
”Chekhov-1”, ”Chekhov-4”, ”Chekhov-5”, ”Chekhov-6”, 
”Chekhov-7”, ”Druzhba”, ”Kirova”, ”Krutaya”, ”Krutoy”, 
”Lenina”, ”Nizhniy”, ”Nizhnyaya”, which do not correspond 
to any of the entries in the official list.  
Figure 15 shows the age distribution of rural and urban 
population of the Russian Federation, according to the 
official Rosstat information, based on the data on 
121.861.482 residents, which is 3 times higher than the 
considered number of VK users. The urban population of the 
Russian Federation is 2.95 higher than that of rural 
population as of January 1st, 2015. Rural population 
constitutes only 25.30% of the total population.  
 
Figure 14.  Age percentage distribution of urban and rural population, 
according to Rosstat. 
Figure 16 shows age distribution of the Russian 
Federation rural population, according to VK API data as 
compared to Rosstat calculations. The number of users 
between 15 and 37 years residing in the rural area is higher 
than that of the registered rural residents in this age interval 
(almost 2 times higher in the 15-31 range). In what follows, 
as the age value increases, the number of users smoothly 
decreases in the range from 37 to 99 years, except the 
previously seen unusual peak at 96 years: the number of rural 
residents at the age of 96 (57.424) is significantly higher than 
that of the officially registered Russian Federation residents 
at this age (3.952).  
Figure 17 depicts the comparative age distribution of the 
Russian Federation urban population, according to VK API 
data as compared to Rosstat calculations. As it has been 
noticed before, VK urban population sample is not 
representative enough, which is why another iteration of data 
collection and analysis is needed. On the basis of the 
processed data, we conclude that urban population of ages 
between 15 and 34 prevails (from 300.000). School and 
university students turn out to be the most active part of VK 
users: 909.412 users at the age between 15 and 25 years (in 
total) against 666.719 at the age between 26 and 99 years (in 
total). In the following, as the age grows, the VK urban 
population smoothly decreases (34-99 years), except the 
maximum at the age of 96, where the obtained value 
(26.424) is higher than the official statistics (12.594) as in 
the case of rural population. 
While comparing VK and Rosstat plots, we have noticed 
that the largest number of users/residents is observed in the 
interval between 25 and 30 years in both cases: over 500.000 
VK users between 24 and 30 years and around 2.000.000 
officially registered residents between 27 and 29.

ETHNIC GROUP LABELING 
In the previous section, we considered VK demography 
variables, such as age, gender, region and settlement type, 
their relationships, and a comparison with the real-world 
demography has been conducted (Rosstat statistics). Another 
variable that is of key importance for sociological analysis 
(e.g., user behavior prediction) is the ethnic group. Due to 
the fact that this parameter is not indicated in SN profiles, 
our task is to devise an algorithm for the automatic

classification of users according to their ethnic group. We 
plan to compare the results with the official data on the 
ethnic composition of the Russian Federation [30].  
Our tool for ethnic group labeling takes forename, 
patronymic, if any, and surname data as input and outputs the 
ethnic affiliation. It has been successfully tested on the lists 
of eminent people (e.g., Time’s magazine list of 100 most 
important people of the 20th Century [26], famous Georgians 
[7], Ossetians [17], List of People’s Artists of Azerbaijan 
[32], etc.). The average accuracy of the system is 99.2%. The 
core of the algorithm is a neural network trained on 
representative samples. The existing similar-purpose systems 
of the prior art are Onolytics [15], E-tech [8], EthnicSeer 
[10], Ethnea [9] and TextMap [25].  
These systems use predefined hierarchies/group lists, 
however, no hierarchy/list construction standards are 
mentioned. Except for Wikipedia, no training resources are 
referenced in case of machine learning-based systems. 
Moreover, the hierarchies represent a mix of ethnic and 
religious (e.g., ”Muslim” is listed as an ethnic group) groups. 
Russian ethnic diversity is not covered by these 
hierarchies/lists, therefore, a special-purpose structure has 
been developed. The details on the classification algorithm 
and comparison to the similar-purpose systems will be given 
in an upcoming paper. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
This paper presents the first steps toward understanding 
the attributes of social media users. It includes the analysis of 
VK social network population sample and the comparison to 
Rosstat data. The attributes taken into account include region 
code, settlement type, age and gender. VK covers the 
following regions the best (in descending order): Saint 
Petersburg, Murmansk Oblast, Vologda Oblast, Republic of 
Buryatia, Republic of Karelia, Udmurt Republic, Lipetsk 
Oblast, Novosibirsk Oblast. According to the first sample 
that takes into account the gender feature, the urban VK 
population is 18 times larger than the rural one. The number 
of men in VK is 3.970.836 higher than the number of 
women. The majority of VK users indicated their gender in 
19 out of 82 regions, including Murmansk Oblast (77.83%), 
Vologda Oblast (85.91%), Republic of Buryatia (75.34%), 
Udmurt Oblast (76.89%) and Lipetsk Oblast (76.05%) that 
are among the best covered by VK. According to the second 
sample including users that specified their age, most VK 
users are between 15 and 33 years old. The number of users 
who specified their age in VK is 3 times lower than the 
official number of Russian Federation residents. The number 
of users of age 16-18, 96 and 99 exceeds the official number 
of residents with these age values. 81.159 VK users 
introduced the age in the interval from 100 to 110 years. For 
these age values there are no official statistics. Also, in the 
age-oriented VK sample, the rural population is two times 
higher than the urban one.  
The ethnic group feature will also be considered upon 
additional testing of the corresponding tool. Our current 
tasks include comparing the ethnic composition of VK with 
the official data on the Russian Federation ethnic 
composition and assessing the name feature quality (whether 
it is useful for the analysis of user groups behavior and 
preferences, and, consequently, whether profiles can be 
improved using kins and/or friends profiles data). Also, we 
are developing an approach to effectively assess the quality 
of other account attributes. It can be helpful in mitigating the 
cold start problem in recommender systems.
