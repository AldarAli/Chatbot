Abstract—The Web has already become a platform that 
reshapes business models, thus spawning new opportunities for 
growth. Furthermore, the Web constitutes an effective media 
rich communication channel for businesses to contact their 
customers, support their transactions and promote their 
products and service through digital marketing. This paper 
focuses on the applicability of fuzzy logic techniques to 
assessing web sites performance with respect to digital 
marketing objectives. This research utilizes the Fuzzy Delphi 
Method (FDM) the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) 
and similarity methods in order to select the web sites that 
mostly satisfy digital marketing targets that are set by a 
Communications Company (CC) in Greece. Data on a large 
number of digital marketing parameters is collected, 
representing the performance of the CC on the web over a 
period of time. This paper aims to identify the criteria that can 
be used for assessing web sites, to determine their relative 
importance and to rank web sites according to their 
contribution to CC objectives. Fuzzy logic is utilised to deal 
with the subjectivity inherent in setting a company’s priorities. 
FDM is used to capture the managers’ views regarding the 
assessment criteria and the FAHP is used for determining the 
criteria’s weights. 
Keywords-Fuzzy Delphi Method; Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy 
Process; Similarity Methods; Web Site selection.

INTRODUCTION
Digital advertising spending is growing globally. 
According to [1], for countries such as the UK, China, 
Norway and Canada, digital advertising has already become 
the dominant advertising channel, which accounts for more 
than 50% of the total ad spending. It is also expected [1] that 
the global spending on digital ads will increase by 17.6% to 
reach $333.25 billion. As regards to the top digital ads 
sellers, Google is expected to outperform their competitors 
being the largest digital ad seller in the world in 2019, 
attracting 31.1% of the global ad spending, or $103.73 
billion. Facebook will be No. 2, with $67.37 billion in net ad 
revenues, followed by China-based Alibaba, at $29.20 
billion [1]. Investments in Digital Marketing (DM) are 
driven by companies’ aims to improve cost effectiveness, as 
well as by changes in customer behaviour. However, DM 
increase is attributed to the fact that results from DM 
initiatives are more easily accountable for compared to those 
of traditional marketing [2]-[5]. Furthermore, as customers 
are increasingly using digital channels for their transactions 
with business, marketers have realized the need to track these 
transactions and to measure their performance [6]. In another 
survey [7], also discussed in [8], 65% of marketing leaders 
surveyed in the USA plan to increase their spending on 
digital advertising, due to factors that impose a continuing 
and consistent shift of offline media spending to digital 
advertising, a decline of organic social in favor of paid social 
and the rising importance of video, which is more expensive 
than other digital techniques.  
For this purpose, firms have already started using Web 
Analytics (WA) for collecting data and assessing digital 
marketing performance. WA can be defined as the process of 
collecting, storing, analysing and reporting of Internet data 
aiming at understanding and optimizing Web usage and e-
business performance. A recent work [2] found that digital 
marketing performance measurement represents a top-
priority for businesses. 
With the proliferation of web sites, businesses have many 
opportunities to showcase their brand online. Globally there 
are over 1.5 billion with around 200 million of them being 
active. The development of a DM investment plan requires 
the analysis of websites performance. WA provides a quite 
comprehensive set of websites traffic data that can be used to 
assess DM alternative plans. In addition, available are 
programmatic digital marketing platforms for  automated 
bidding on advertising inventory in real time, that give 
businesses access to websites traffic data and the opportunity 
to show an ad to a specific customer, in a specific context.  
From there, a DM agency will help businesses determine 
which digital channels, i.e., websites, should be used to reach 
their ideal buyers. DM agencies evaluate businesses’ website 
traffic, determine the best online platforms to invest in, and 
continually maintain the balance between your marketing 
activities and the results they provide. Programmatic 
Advertising (PA), as a new format of online precision 
marketing, has sparked a new wave of explosive growth in 
display advertising markets [9]. In USA, the PA promotion 
spending reaches 32.56 billion dollars in 2017, taking up the 
80% market share of the online display advertising; in the 
UK, programmatically traded ads account for more than 75% 
of online display advertising spending by the end of 2017; 
and in China, the PA market scale is about 11.69 billion 
dollars in 2017, and will grow to 29.6 billion in 2019 with 
the average growth rate of about 35% [9]. PA has evolved as

a new model in advertising that facilitates the precise 
matching between advertisements and target audiences in a 
real-time manner, as well as it allows for the effective 
allocation of the limited ad resources, thus leading to the 
improved performance in market promotions [7]. Therefore, 
one critical decision that arises in the context of PA is ad 
inventory allocation, i.e., determining how to allocate the 
limited ad impressions (ad inventory) to the demanding 
advertisers as to optimize the publishers’ various objectives 
[7]. Advertisement impressions allocation has been widely 
considered as one of the most critical decisions for 
publishers in PA markets [10][11]. 
This study suggests a methodology based on multicriteria 
analysis and fuzzy logic in order to identify and quantify the 
websites selection criteria in programmatic advertising. This 
paper also proposes the use of similarity methods in order to 
identify websites that have been overlooked, therefore they 
can be considered as an investment option.  
This paper suggests the use of FDM in order to determine 
the selection criteria. The FDM is well established and used 
in similar studies [12]. The (FAHP) is proposed for it allows 
decision makers, e.g., marketing managers, to express their 
beliefs regarding the relative importance of selection criteria, 
and then it aggregates their opinions in order to produce a 
hierarchical model that quantifies their relative of the 
selection criteria. This study also utilizes similarity methods 
in order to identify and recommend websites for investment. 
Thus, this research aims to: 

Identify the selection criteria that marketing 
managers adopt when allocating resource during the PA 
decision process.  

Propose a multi-criteria approach for identifying 
and assessing Websites and allocate resources in the 
context of PA. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II, 
discusses the proposed methodology and the methods 
utilized for the data analysis. The empirical study and the 
data analysis are presented in Section III. The paper 
concludes and indicates future research in Section IV.  
II.
METHODOLOGY AND METHODS
This section discusses the proposed methodology and the 
methods used in this study. 
A. Methodology for identifing and quantifing websites 
selection criteria that can be used in programmatic 
advertising 
This study proposes a multi-criteria approach in order to 
identify selection criteria upon which PA managers could 
evaluate the performance of websites and decide how to 
allocate their ad impressions and subsequently their 
investment budget. Data is collected from two sources. 
Firstly, from the management of a digital marketing agency 
that participated in our case study. Then data were collected 
from the agency’s PA platform regarding multiple 
advertisement campaigns that have been run on behalf of a 
multinational telecommunication company operating in 
Greece. The data is analyzed by utilizing the FDM and 
FAHP multicriteria analysis methods. In recent years, many 
researchers 
adopted 
Multi-Criteria 
Decision 
Making 
(MCDM) approaches for solving problems such as assessing 
alternative solutions, selection problems, strategic analysis 
[13]-[18] etc. The steps of the proposed methodology 
adopted follow. 
Step 1: Collect data from the management team of the 
digital marketing agency in Greece. The collected data refers 
to the management perspective of what selection criteria 
should be used in PA decision making. The agency manages 
traffic data for one its customer a big multinational 
telecommunication company. A group of five (5) managers, 
dealing with digital marketing and programmatic advertising, 
had agreed to participate in our study. At first, the managers 
were introduced to the topic of this research they were 
informed about procedures regarding their involvement and 
the methods to be used. Next, the managers were asked to 
review the data (variables) that were retrieved from a PA 
platform that the agency uses to follow the performance of 
advertisement campaigns. Next, they were asked to select a 
list of variables they would consider most important. The 
FDM [19]-[21] was utilized in order to prioritize and finally 
select managers’ suggestions. The linguistic variables and 
corresponding Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) that were 
used in FDM, for the managers to express their priorities are 
shown in Table I:

The linguistic scale for the FDM was adopted by Sun 
[22]. The final list of parameters as resulted from the FDM is 
shown in Table II:

A FAHP questionnaire was then developed and sent to 
five managers of the agency that participated in this case

study. The questionnaire consisted of questions that referred 
to the relative importance of the selected criteria as perceived 
by the each one of the managers. The linguistic variables and 
corresponding (TFNs) that were used in FAHP, for the 
managers to express their beliefs are shown in Table III:

(2/9, 1/ 4, 2/7) 
The linguistic scale was adopted by Kilincci et al. [23] 
and Lee et al. [24]. With respect to sample sizes used in AHP 
or FAHP, expert group sizes range from 1 in [23] to 5 in 
[25], 9 in [26] and 24 experts in [24]. The sample size of five 
is therefore adequate for applying FAHP. 
Step 2: 
Apply 
FAHP 
and 
construct 
the 
hierarchical model for websites selection.  
Step 3: Collect data, for to the selection criteria, from the 
PA platform. Data are then analyzed to assess websites 
performance.  
Step 4: Assess websites performance. Examine the 
proposed model’s validation. 
Step 5: Apply similarity methods to identify and 
recommend investment opportunities in websites that 
currently are not considered by the agency in the 
advertisement portfolio of the telecommunication company. 
B.
The Fuzzy Delphi Method 
The FDM has been extensively used in many studies 
seeking expert consensus on MCDM problems such as 
developing performance appraisal indicators for mobility of 
the service industries [12] for logistics and supplier 
evaluation [27] for lubricant regenerative technology 
selection [19] and for developing road safety performance 
indicators [20]. The FDM was proposed by Murry et al. [21] 
as an integration of fuzzy logic with the traditional Delphi 
Method [28]. Expert consensus, in MCDM methods such as 
the FDM or the FAHP, is usually calculated using the 
geometric mean, which is assumed to capture expert 
consensus more accurately [12][20][29][30]. This paper uses 
TFNs with geometric means to represent expert consensus. A 
TFN is denoted simply as a triple (

where i =1,…,n and j=1,…,k represent the number of 
experts and the number of criteria respectively, and the   
represents the response of the ith expert regarding the jth 
criterion. 
C.
The FAHP Method 
The FAHP is an extension of Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) introduced in [31]. Fuzzy logic is introduced to AHP 
by utilizing linguistic variables and fuzzy numbers in order 
to deal with uncertainty in judgments. FAHP prioritizes the 
relative importance of a list of criteria and sub-criteria 
through pair-wise comparisons by experts as discussed 
in[32]. The extent analysis method introduced in [33] is a 
popular method to solving MCDM problems with FAHP. 
Assume that

 is a Triangular Fuzzy

and extent analysis for each goal (gi) is performed 
respectively. Therefore, m extent analysis values for each 
object can be obtained, with the following notation:  
where,  i = 1,2,…,n  
(4) 
and all the 
 (j=1,2,…,m) are TFNs. The 
steps of FAHP are shown below: 
Step 1: The value Si of the fuzzy synthetic extent with 
respect to the ith object is defined as:.

EMPIRICAL STUDY AND DATA ANALYSIS
After all responses from the group of the five managers 
were collected, the FAHP was applied (eqs. 5-13) returning 
the importance weights for the selection criteria. The results 
are shown in Table IV.

The results show that the agency management was 
concerned more about the number of users (e.g., clicks 
unique and interacting users) who were attracted from an ad, 
than other criteria, e.g., the number of impressions that have 
been viewed or served. Therefore, the most important key 
success factor for a digital ad is to firstly attract the attention 
of the potential customer. Next, the websites were ranked by 
using advertising campaigns data that were retrieved from 
the PA platform that the agency had access and the selection 
criteria 
weights. The campaigns 
data 
measure 
the 
performance of every website considered by the agency, in 
terms of the selection criteria. A sample of the ranking is 
shown in Table V. 
TABLE V. 
THE WEBSITES RANKING
The results indicate the overall ranking as well as the 
ranking for each individual criterion. So, the agency 
management could know how each website performed in 
total and for each individual criterion. Next the websites 
were grouped in their relevant subject categories. The FAHP 
23

was then performed to rank the websites by their category. 
The results are shown in Table VI. 
TABLE VI. 
RANKING WEBSITES BY THEIR RELEVANT SUBJECT 
CATEGORY
The results indicate that the best performing campaigns 
for the telecommunication company were those ran by the

following 
second. However, 
the 
effectiveness of the investment in advertising depends on the 
budget that is spent on each website and on each sector. 
After normalizing the spending the ranking of each website 
and each sector were recalculated. The results regarding the 
sectors are shown in Table VII. 
TABLE VII. 
THE COST-BENEFIT CONTRIBUTION OF EACH SECTOR
By taking into account the budget spent for advertising in 
each sector, the ranking changes. So, despite the News and 
Information sector’s achievement to outperform all the other 
sectors, the amount of money that was spent for advertising 
in this sector seems to be larger than it should be being 
disproportioned with the sectors performance results.  
The websites evaluation based on the selection criteria as 
well as on the advertising budget, does not highlights the 
best performing sites but it also reveals investment 
opportunities. By calculating the Chi-Square similarity 
method as discussed in [35], websites of similar performance 
but with much lower level of investments may represent a 
promising alternative for advertising. This study analyzed 
data from 123 websites. So, the resulting similarity matrix is 
(123x123) matrix. The values in the matrix show how much 
a website is similar to all the rest. The closer the value is to 
+1, the more similar the websites are. On contrary,   values 
closer to -1, indicate dissimilarity. The sample of the 
similarity matrix shown in Table VIII indicates that WS1 
Website is very much similar to WS8 with a similarity 
degree of 0.946.  
TABLE VIII. 
THE SIMILARITY AMONG WEBSITES
If the advertising spending on the WS1 and WS8 is far 
apart then an investment opportunity is worth considering. 
Assuming that the budget spent on WS1 is much lower that 
the WS8, then the WS1 is already a promising alternative for 
serving impressions. 
IV.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Programmatic advertising and digital marketing attract a 
lot of attention since the focus of interacting with customers 
is already shifted on digital channels. Web analytics and PA 
platforms play an important role in assessing the 
effectiveness of digital marketing. Challenging decisions 
should be made by management teams when devising an 
advertising plan. There are millions of websites and other 
digital channels that need to be considered for serving 
impressions. Currently, analytics tools do not provide a 
comprehensive list of parameters to consider and analyze in 
PA related decision making. This study by utilizing 
multicriteria methods, such as the FDM and the FAHP, 
proposes a methodology to identify and analyze the relative 
importance of websites selection criteria and use them in 
developing a hierarchical model that could assist decision 
making in the PA. This research also suggests that similarity 
methods 
can 
be 
utilized 
to 
highlight 
investments 
opportunities in an attempt to assist PA management to 
revise their options. Furthermore, this research suggests that, 
Web analytics tools should improve their functionality by 
combining MCDM methods, in order to enhance their value 
in assessing digital marketing strategies. 
Future research should focus on developing methods and 
tools that take into consideration time-dependent factors in a 
real-time manner and develop the required functionality in 
analyzing and managing the interactions among investment 
performance and customer interactions.
