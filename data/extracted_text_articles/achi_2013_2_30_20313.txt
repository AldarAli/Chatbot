Abstract— A principal characteristic of three dimensional user 
interfaces is that it contains information in the 3rd axis. 
Visually, this information is presented as being placed further 
away from the screen or having depth. A consequence of this is 
that information can be occluded. Determining the optimal 
amount of depth levels for specifically sized icons is important 
in the design of 3D user interfaces. This paper investigates the 
depth placement of objects of a three dimensional user 
interface on a tablet device at the early stage of the 
development process. We present mixed methods evaluation 
with a paper prototype with a focus on the users' subjective 
experiences. Users were presented with concepts of different 
depth levels, with and without 3D objects. The findings 
indicate that users' preference was for depth levels 3-5. We 
recommend designing 3D UIs with a controllable depth by 
starting with a few depth levels and increasing them 
automatically based on the amount of 3D objects. Also, it is 
important to give a user a possibility to customize depth levels 
when needed. This paper provides user preference information 
on depth for 3D UI designers and developers, especially in the 
context of a touch screen tablet device.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Three dimensional (3D) graphical user interfaces (GUIs) 
have been studied for many decades and they are still 
actively researched [1][2][7][10][14]. Typically, interaction 
with 3D user interfaces involves dealing with information 
and objects that are spatially organized in three dimensional 
virtual space. The number of objects, their size and issues of 
occlusion must be defined and evaluated with users in order 
to provide a positive user experience. To show large amounts 
of information, 3D objects are spatially organized at different 
levels of depth from the 3D camera, or what we call depth 
levels. 3D research and development is a large and diverse 
area. Studies exist about appropriate 3D UI metaphors and 
depth for touch screens in PC environments [1][11]. 
However, there is not a clear answer for what kind of 3D UI 
and depth users would actually prefer for touch screen tablet 
devices.  
Cipiloglu et al. [5] present a framework for enhancing 
depth perception in computer graphics. Different depth cues 
help users to perceive the spatial relationships between the 
objects. Earlier studies indicate that spatial organization of 
information enables efficient access to objects in graphical 
user interfaces. Cockburn and McKenzie [6] studied the 
effectiveness of spatial memory in 2D/3D physical and 
virtual environments and compared 2D, 2.5D and 3D 
interfaces. However, this experiment was conducted with a 
PC and mouse and one would expect interaction to be 
different than with a touch screen tablet device. One 
influencing factor for a user-tablet interaction with touch 
screen is the size of the objects, widgets and icons. 
According to Budiu and Nielsen [3], the target size for 2D UI 
widgets is 1*1cm for touch devices. In a 3D UI on a tablet 
device, there are several aspects that can have an influence 
on how users perceive the space and how they are able to 
interact with 3D objects in depth through touch screen. This 
issue has not been studied much in a mobile tablet device 
context. In a hybrid 2D/3D UI study, Salo et al. [15] found 
that a large amount of 2D overlay icons decreases the 
interaction with 3D objects which are embedded in a 3D 
virtual environment. 
This paper presents how we used a paper prototype as a 
part of mixed methods evaluation procedure at the early 
phase of the design process to find out the optimal depth 
levels in 3D graphical user interfaces. Later, we developed a 
virtual prototype as well in order to see how users' 
preferences for depth in a 3D UI compare with the results 
from the paper prototype. Based on the user evaluations with 
both paper and virtual prototypes, we propose that the depth 
levels 3-5 could be the most preferable depth for the 3D UI 
as a default starting point, depending on the system context. 
II. 
METHOD OF STUDY 
Paper prototyping is a widely used method in the human-
computer interaction (HCI) field, especially in the user-
centered design (UCD) process [16]. The aim of the UCD 
process is to support developing systems that meet the user's 
expectations and needs. ISO 13407 [8] defines a prototype 
as: "representation of all or part of a product or system that, 
although limited in some way, can be used for evaluation". 
According to the Buchenau and Fulton Suri [4], prototypes 
are "representations of a design made before final artifacts 
exist and they are created to inform both design process and 
design decisions". Prototypes can range from sketches to 
different kinds of models, which depict the design as follows 
35

ACHI 2013 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

"looks like," "behaves like," "works like" [4]. One benefit of 
using prototypes is that they can facilitate exploring and 
communicating propositions about the design and its context. 
The paper prototyping itself as a method is not a new 
idea. Typically, it has been used for improving usability of 
the UI. Our focus was on subjective user's experiences. 
When studying user experiences in the early design phase, it 
is important to use suitable research methods. Although the 
interest in UX in industry and academy has been high over a 
decade, there are not enough systematic methods regarding 
how to evaluate user experiences [17]. Especially, there is a 
need to develop and use low-cost methods for UX evaluation 
and utilize the collected information in the early phase of the 
design and development processes [18]. ISO 9241-110 [9] 
defines user experience as: "a person's perceptions and 
responses that results from the use and/or anticipated use of 
a product, system or service". Therefore, user experiences 
should be evaluated before, during and after the use [17].  
A. Concept Design 
In the early stage of our research, we did a concept 
design phase to explore different ideas for the visual design 
of the 3D UI. In this phase, we drew approximately 100 
sketches of different 3D UIs for touch screen tablet devices. 
From those sketches we selected the most relevant examples 
for the further design. Among those sketches there were two 
sketches about 3D UI utilizing depth. The first example 
illustrates the 3D objects on top of the VE (Fig. 1a) and the 
second the same example in a customization mode where the 
grid is visible and background VE is invisible (Fig. 1b). 
Based on these sketches we created a paper prototype in 
order to study depth levels for 3D UIs on tablets.

and B) with a grid background. 
B. Evaluation Procedure 
We developed a paper prototype in order to study users' 
preferences for depth levels in 3D UIs on tablets in the early 
design phase. We used our depth level paper prototype as a 
part of mixed methods evaluation procedure where we 
illustrated ten 3D UI concepts to the users by using various 
types of prototypes. Fig. 2 presents the contents of the whole 
evaluation procedure. This paper focuses only on the 
findings gathered from the phase 5: 2) selection tasks A-C 
(Fig. 2). It was important to introduce participants to the 3D 
UI topic and show different examples in the evaluation 
phases 1-4 before the depth level evaluation (Fig. 2). 
Findings from the phase 1 are reported in [12] and from the 
phases 2 and 3 in [13].

C. Depth Level Paper Prototype and Selection Tasks 
The paper prototype was created in such a way that a UI 
example would be comparable with commercial off-the-shelf 
touch screen tablet devices with 2D icons in a 2D UI (e.g., 
Apple iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab). For instance, in these 
kinds of tablets, there are 4*5 application icons presented per 
screen. Therefore, our grid example included 4*5 icon areas 
as well. The depth in each level is the space that a 3D icon of 
an application requires. Fig. 3 illustrates one example page 
of our paper prototype. The size of the grid was 23.8 
centimeters (almost equal to the iPad's screen size, which is 
9.7 inches) on a size A4 white paper. Fig. 4 illustrates depth 
levels without objects (A), with ordered (B) and unordered 
3D objects (C). In each selection task (A-C), we had eight 
depth levels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, infinity (∞) and users were 
asked to select one level in each task (A-C) based on which 
depth level they prefer (Fig. 2).

Figure 4.  Example depth levels 1, 3, 4, 5 and ∞ without objects (A), with ordered (B) and unordered 3D objects (C). 
We decided to create depth levels with a different set of 
3D objects, because of the two reasons. First, in the 3D UIs, 
objects can be placed anywhere and they can be occluded.  
Second, in the tablet devices, a user can have a different 
amount of application icons and widgets.  
D. Participants 
The evaluation was conducted with 40 participants (15 
female, 25 male), whose age varied from 23 to 52 years 
(averaging 35) (Fig. 5). Users had prior experience with 
touch screen devices, either tablets or phones. 
III. 
FINDINGS 
The following Subsections present which depth levels 
users preferred in the selection tasks A-C (without objects 
and with ordered and unordered 3D objects) in the 3D UI 
concept evaluation (Fig. 2). Users' subjective experiences are 
also cited. 
A. Depth Selections without Objects 
Without 3D objects, depth levels 3 (40%) and 4 (35%) 
were clearly the most selected choices (Fig. 6). According to 
the feedback, participants made their selections based on 
how many icons or applications they could place in the space 
and how they could select them by touching. For instance, 
depth level 1 was regarded as too plain or tight and only a 
few applications could be located on the periphery.  
One person, who selected level 2, commented: "Here 
could be 36 icons on sides and ceiling". Participants 
understood that these icons would occupy the same 
volumetric space as a 2D icon. Subjects selected depth levels 
from 2 to 4; because they did not want the background grid 
to be too small. Participants understood that the background 
grid decreases when the depth increases. They thought the 
background area is meant for open applications, which is 
easily viewable. A person, who selected level 3, said that the 
depth depends on the physical size of a finger, the finger will 
"poke" many icons if the space has too much depth. 
Participants who selected depth levels from 3 to 5 
justified their selection by referring to memory: "It would be 
impossible to remember where some objects are". The 
comments on depth levels 10, 15 and infinity were: "too 
deep", "too small periphery", "difficult to control" and 
"cannot use anymore". One person commented that the 
infinity level could be a suitable solution for thousands of 
music files.

B. Depth Selections with Ordered 3D Objects 
The comments from participants during the selection of 
the depth level without objects, revealed how they would 
place 2D icons on the surfaces. When participants saw depth 
levels with 3D objects, they perceived how those would 
appear and be located in the 3D space. When 3D objects 
were organized in the space, the depth selection was deeper, 
half of the participants selected depth level 5 (Fig. 6). Users, 
who selected levels 4 or 5, said that "from these levels they 
can remember, control and select icons". In Fig. 5, a 
participant is selecting the depth level 5 because in that level 
he can see and select also occluded objects. One person, who 
selected level 2, commented that "If objects would be 
organized only on the sides, the depth level could be even 
deeper".  
In this task, people also counted how many objects there 
would be available for them, and thus, level 2 was regarded 
as too small. Depth level 1 was regarded as boring. One 
person, who selected level 5, commented that "The level 1 
shows that I'm poor, I don't have many things happening in 
my life". She explained this comment by comparing how 
many applications she would need in her private and 
professional life. A person, who selected level 10, said that 
level 1 would be enough for his mother (e.g., elder and non-
technically oriented people). A majority of the comments of 
depth levels 10, 15 and infinity were negative and related to 
issues like visual appearance, controllability and memory. 
One person said: "It does not feel coequal, because some 
item is behind the others". One user thought that depth could 
increase according to the amount of applications. 
C. Depth Selections with Unordered 3D Objects 
When 3D objects were not organized, 40% of all users 
selected the depth level 4 (Fig. 6). Participants, who selected 
level 4, said that they would like to be able to change their 
viewpoint or perspective to see behind the objects. Depth 
levels 1 and 2 were regarded as boring. Some users thought 
that level 2 causes claustrophobia. Depth levels 3-5 got 
comments, mainly relating to controllability. Comments on 
level 5 or more were mainly negative. Users wondered how 
visible and recognizable the icons would be. They thought 
that different 3D object shapes could make them 
recognizable. Some arguments reflect more on the users' 
personality, for instance, one person selected level 5 and 
said: "I like a certain type of chaos". Another person who 
selected level 10, said: "I'm not a minimalist". 
IV. 
VALIDATION OF THE FINDINGS 
This section presents how we later validated UX findings 
gathered by the paper prototype. We developed a virtual 
prototype on a tablet device and conducted the similar depth 
level evaluation with both the paper and virtual prototypes. 
However, this test did not include the whole 3D UI concept 
evaluation procedure (Fig. 2). 
A. Development of Virtual Prototype on a Tablet 
We evaluated our paper prototype method by developing 
a virtual prototype and conducting the same depth level 
evaluation with the virtual prototype. In order to be able to 
conduct a similar evaluation, we designed depth levels with 
the same visual appearance (Fig. 7). However, in the final 
virtual prototype, we implemented more depth levels, 
because we also wanted to study levels from 6 to 20. 
Another reason for small differences on the appearance was 
that the virtual prototype was developed by using a 3D 
program and its camera perspective. This made the 
background grid appear in a slightly different size in the 
virtual prototype than in the paper prototype (Fig. 8). 
Therefore, we measured the hypotenuse of the background 
grid at each depth level in both of the prototypes and 
compared them. The difference in the size of the hypotenuse 
was approximately +/- 1 centimeter. This small difference 
has been taken into account in the comparison of the results 
(Fig. 11b).

prototype (depth level 5).

The virtual prototype was developed on a tablet device 
(9,7") and users were able to adjust the depth levels by 
pressing the screen continuously with one finger and then 
swiping forward (swipe up) and backward (swipe down) 
with another finger (Fig. 9). This interaction model was the 
main difference in comparison to the paper prototype, in 
which the depth levels were adjusted by turning pages of the 
binder (Fig. 10a).

Figure 10.  In the validation test, a user made depth level selection tasks A-
C with the paper (A) and the virtual tablet prototype (B). 
B. Participants' Selections with the Virtual Prototype 
In this comparison test, the same depth level selection 
tasks were conducted with both, paper and tablet prototypes 
using a total of 34 participants (Fig. 10).  
With the virtual prototype, 18% of users selected level 3 
from the example without objects (Fig. 11a). When objects 
were ordered, levels 4 and 5 were both selected by 18 % of 
participants. 41 % of users selected level 3, when objects 
were unordered. The majority of users preferred levels from 
3 to 5 in all tasks. Deeper levels such as level 30 and infinity 
were selected by 3-9% of subjects. These selections indicate 
the same results that were found by the paper prototype. (Fig. 
11a.)  
In order to compare results with both paper (PP) and 
virtual prototypes (VP), we combined selections in certain 
depth levels (Fig. 11b) according to size of hypotenuse in the 
background grid. The levels were combined as follows: 
 
level 4 in VP represents the level 3 in PP, 
 
levels 5-6 in VP represent the level 4 in PP, 
 
levels 7- 9 in VP represent the level 5 in PP, 
 
levels 20 and 30 in VP represent level 10 in PP 
 
levels 10, 11, 14 are not referable to any levels of 
paper prototype; therefore, they have been moved to 
NA (not applicable) category. (Fig. 11b)  
Results with virtual prototype (Fig. 11b) support our 
findings gathered by the paper prototype (Fig. 6). 
Participants in the both tests preferred depth levels 3-5 (Fig. 
6 and 11b).

DISCUSSION 
The depth level experiment in the concept evaluation was 
made in order to get user feedback for the design of 3D UIs 
in the early design phase. The paper prototype was 
developed and used for a certain mixed methods evaluation 
situation. In this context, the paper prototype proved to be a 
useful method and enabled us to get user feedback for a 
specific research topic. Especially in mixed methods 
evaluation procedures, it is important to use different types 
of prototypes to illustrate design ideas to the users and then 
communicate about them. This paper contributes UX

research by presenting how a fast and low-cost method can 
be used in the early design phase as a part of mixed methods 
evaluation procedure.  
Also the validation test with the paper and virtual 
prototypes elicited similar results than we found by the paper 
prototype in the concept evaluation. In further studies, we 
will use these findings in new 3D UI designs. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
This paper presented how users perceive depth in a 3D 
UI and which depth level they prefer. Results from the depth 
level selections with paper and virtual prototypes elicited that 
users preferred levels from 3 to 5. They liked these depth 
levels because they thought that they can perceive and select 
all needed applications easily just from one view without a 
need for hierarchical menu structures and camera view 
changes. The level 1 was regarded as boring and too simple. 
Only a few users preferred the infinity level. This level 
would be interesting to study more with a running 
application, because preferences for infinity level can be 
dependent on the content (e.g., music, photos, contacts). 
Based on the user evaluations with both paper and virtual 
prototypes, we propose that the depth levels 3-5 could be the 
most preferable depth for the 3D UI as a default starting 
point, depending on the system context. Users could also 
have a possibility to customize the depth levels when needed. 
In further studies, we will use these findings in new 
designs, and then test how users experience the depth levels 
with an interactive 3D UI on a touch screen mobile device. 
The reason for providing this early phase design and UX 
evaluation information to 3D UI and HCI research fields is to 
increase the knowledge of conducting UX studies with time- 
and cost-effective low-fidelity methods.
