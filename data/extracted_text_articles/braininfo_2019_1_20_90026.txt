Abstract— The Personalizable assisTive Ambient monitoring 
and Lighting (PETAL) Project represents a unique and 
innovative solution that aims to reduce the cognitive decline 
among Mild Cognitive Impairment patients through an 
assisted ambient environment, as well as through the use of 
neurocognitive stimulation applications. The functioning of the 
system is based on an online platform named “Rule Editor” 
that will act as both receptor for the information coming from 
the environment and transmitter of the information which will 
eventually 
materialize 
through 
the 
peripheral 
devices 
connected. One of the most important parts of the system is the 
Human Centric Lighting (the term was coined in 2013 and 
refers to lighting that induces positive health effects in human 
beings), which supports the following functions: sleep-wake 
rhythm, directs attention in a timely manner, supports 
structure of daily activities and spatial-temporal orientation. 
The system will also integrate motion and proximity sensors 
that will continuously monitor the presence of the patient 
inside the home through a smartwatch worn by the elderly. 
Using the same smartwatch, the platform can send warnings to 
different numbers prior set in the case the patient falls. 
Moreover, 
regarding 
the 
neurocognitive 
stimulation 
applications, the patients will perform exercises for maximum 
an hour, 3 times a week. Using this platform, we can monitor 
changes that might appear in some particular contexts – 
aspects regarding the user, time, environment, etc. Thus, the 
necessary adjustments that should respond to the patient’s 
requirements could be performed. The platform will allow the 
caregivers to personalize the way in which the platform as well 
as the Lighting System and other connected devices and 
appliances will act using a set of “rules”.  
Keywords – MCI; elderly; light; cognitive functions; technology.

 INTRODUCTION 
Lately, ageing and dementia have represented a 
main focus among both clinicians and researchers in terms 
of early diagnosis and interventions through predictive 
biomarkers. The term Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) 
was firstly introduced in 1988 [1] to describe a transitional 
state between the cognition of normal aging and mild 
dementia – the subjects were identified based on the Global 
Deterioration Scale when Stage 3 criteria were fulfilled.  
In section II we will present the concept of MCI in 
detail by providing evidence-based information regarding 
clinical presentation, assessment and diagnostic criteria. In 
the `third section, the operating system of the PETAL 
project is explained while in the last sections – Conclusions, 
all the achievements are going to be summarized and the 
future work will be presented as well. 
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
The first clinical criteria for MCI were proposed by 
a group of investigators from the Mayo Clinic in the late 
90’s; In 1999 the concept of MCI has further been 
developed [2][3] and in order to reach an agreement on the 
clinical features of MCI, an international conference was 
held in 2003 (Key Symposium) that materialized in a 
revised criteria for this condition [4]. More recently, the 
National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association 
(NIA-AA) put together a group in order to once again 
evaluate MCI clinical criteria along Alzheimer’s Disease 
Spectrum [5] – the core criteria overlap with those proposed 
by the Key Symposium. The American Psychiatric 
Association has recently published new criteria for dementia 
in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
for Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which recognize the pre-
dementia stage of cognitive impairment. The condition, 
which has many of the features of MCI, is termed mild 
neurocognitive disorder (NCD) [6]; see Table1.

TABLE I. EVOLUTION OF MCI CRITERIA 
 
 
The prevalence of MCI can highly vary depending 
on the population. Using Winblad’s 2004 diagnostic criteria 
[4], the prevalence of MCI was 28.3% in the U.S.[7], 24.3% 
in Austria[8], 17.2% in Germany [9] and 12.7% in China 
[10]. According to a recent review of population and 
community-based studies, the annual incidence rate of MCI 
ranged from 51 to 77 per 1,000 persons in those 60 years or 
older [11]. 
As seen in Table 1, MCI patients present cognitive 
disfunctions which do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for 
dementia. Typically, executive functions, attention, 
language and visuospatial skills are the main domains in 
which MCI develops [12]. Clinical data suggesting a change 
in cognitive abilities is necessary for being classified as 
MCI. This information is generally gathered by using 
questionnaires addressed to the patient and or caregiver. 
People diagnosed with MCI have greater difficulty or need a 
longer period of time, compared to healthy individuals of 
the same age category, to complete daily activities that 
require greater use of cognitive functions - use of the phone, 
finding and organizing personal things, shopping, treatment 
compliance, moving and guiding or managing their own 
finances. In spite of these disorders, patients with MCI are 
in most cases independent - the accusations they invoke do 
not interfere with the abilities and the possibility of social 
activities within the family or the workplace [13]. The 
subjective cognitive complaint then needs to be confirmed 
by objective cognitive measures such as neuropsychological 
test batteries. Objective cognitive impairment is defined as a 
poor performance in one or more cognitive measures, which 
suggests deficits in one or more cognitive areas or domains. 
There 
is 
no 
gold 
standard 
to 
specify 
which 
neuropsychological test battery to use, but it is important 
that all the main cognitive areas are examined [12]. 
Considering impairment in the memory domain as 
well as in a single domain or multiple ones, MCI can be 
classified in 4 major subtypes – amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 
non amnestic MCI (naMCI), single or multiple domain as 
follows: aMCI – single domain (impairment only in 
memory), aMCI – multiple domain (impairment in 
memory and other cognitive domain), naMCI – single 
domain (impairment in a single cognitive domain, but not 
memory), naMCI – multiple domain (impairment in at 
least two cognitive domains, but not memory).  
Risk factors are a subject relatively new to 
research, the current information being gathered in the last 
ten years. The most important risk factors are: old age, low 
level of education, male gender, presence of Ƹ4 allele on 
APOE gene, comorbidities – cardiovascular diseases and 
diabetes having a more impact, depression. Physical 
activity as well as social and cognitive stimulation can 
both contribute to postponing or preventing MCI [12]. A 
review of 41 cohort studies with a ten-year maximum 
follow-up was conducted and revealed that, on average, a 
32% of people with MCI progress to dementia [14]. In a 
multiethnic community-based study of 2,364 participants, 
the investigators specifically examined the reversion rate of 
MCI, the results being as follow: 47% remained unchanged 
and 31% reverted to normal within an average of 4.7 years 
follow-up [15]. While the reasons for these different 
outcomes remain unknown, additionally, the risk of 
mortality increased by 50% to 150% in persons with MCI 
compared to those without MCI [16][17][18]. 
In terms of MCI interventions that aim to prevent, 
slow down or even reverse the progression of this pathology 
can 
be 
grouped 
in 
the 
following 
categories: 
pharmacological, physical training / exercise, cognitive 
interventions and psychotherapy [19]. Recommendations 
focus more on non-pharmacological interventions, one of 
the main reasons being that they produce no adverse effects. 
Among the non-pharmacological interventions, cognitive 
training and physical exercise (specifically aerobic 
exercise) may attenuate the cognitive impairment. A recent 
review showed how the efficacy of cognitive training in 
MCI measured as improvements in tests of global cognitive

functioning, memory and meta-memory [20][21]. A 
limitation of these findings is the small samples of the 
individual 
studies. 
Only 
seven 
RCTs 
(randomized 
controlled trials) were identified by a systematic review 
[20], with a total of 296 MCI subjects who were cognitively 
treated. Most of these studies in fact included samples of 
fewer than 50 individuals; therefore, replication of the 
findings in larger RCTs is warranted. 
To conclude, MCI is by all means a heterogenous 
entity limited by inconsistent findings. In many ways, the 
rapid transition from research to clinical setting has been 
premature. However, this does highly reflect the clinical 
need of standardized criteria and diagnostic algorithms 
given the high level of awareness of cognitive disorders in 
population. The major controversial issues for MCI research 
are centered on the subjects – source (memory clinics or 
general population) and age (middle aged or elderly), 
implementation of the criteria – test batteries, cut-offs and 
norms, data collection – prospective vs retrospective case 
findings as well as classification – standardized algorithm 
vs clinical judgement, blindness – awareness vs blindness 
(to clinical history) and follow-up (short-term vs long-term 
predictivity)[12]. 
 
III. 
PETAL PROJECT 
As previously mentioned, the current focus 
regarding MCI interventions is directed more towards the 
non-pharmacological interventions.  
PETAL Project - PErsonalizable assisTive 
Ambient monitoring and Lighting aims to extend the time 
older people can live in their home environment by 
increasing their autonomy and assisting them in carrying out 
activities of daily living. In particular, the goals are to 
provide older adults affected by MCI with useful and usable 
means to increase their awareness and control of their 
current lifestyle by providing them with relevant and 
tailored information in an intuitive and natural manner. The 
PETAL system is comprised of 2 main components – the 
Lighting system and a cognitive-stimulation exercises 
mobile app. The lighting system will be in charge of the 
non-visual light effects as well as the photometric factors 
(triggers of the non-visual light effects) whereas the 
cognitive stimulation app will focus directly on the 
cognitive improvements. 
The current definition of light is based on its 
physical explanation as being the visible part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. However, the human eye cannot 
see a spectrum, it is rather the photoreceptors – rods and 
cones, which collect, decipher and transpose the emission or 
reflectance of electromagnetic waves in a specific range or 
photons into meaningful visual signs in our brains. It is only 
two decades since the entraining and phase-shifting capacity 
of light on human circadian rhythms was discovered. 
Relatively little attention has been paid to other light effects 
on human brain, such as its alerting properties. As of 1995, 
only a handful of studies had directly or indirectly examined 
the immediate activating effects of light on alertness, 
performance and/or mood [22][23]. This has recently 
changed since a novel, third type of photoreceptor in the 
retina of mammals has been detected [24]. This novel 
photoreceptor cell type, an intrinsic photosensitive retinal 
ganglion cell, is considered to play a crucial role in many of 
the non-visual biological effects of light also in humans. 
The existence of such a photoreceptor can explain why pupil 
constriction, 
melatonin 
suppression 
and 
circadian 
entrainment are still possible in rodless and coneless 
transgenic mice [25][26].  
Personalizable Lighting is a term that has become 
more and more popular in the lighting industry during the 
last years. Although the term is used on a large scale, there 
is no precise definition of this term. In the Human-
Computer Interaction area, two main approaches are 
considered for personalization: adaptive interfaces - which 
dynamically adjust the interface in a way that is intended to 
support the user and adaptable interfaces - which provide 
customization mechanisms but rely on the user to use those 
mechanisms to do the adaptation [27]. Thus, these 
approaches differ with respect to who is in control of the 
personalization: adaptive interfaces are system-controlled 
whereas adaptable interfaces are user-controlled. 
PETAL System aims to trigger the non-visual 
lighting effects - regulation of sleep-wake cycle, 
regulation of appetite, impact on mood, impact on 
activity-rest-pattern, impact on behaviour by exploiting 
and modulating the photometric light parameters, such as 
light intensity, light spectrum – colour temperature, time 
and duration of the exposure as well as light history. Thus, 
the project is a classic exponent of the Human Centric 
Lighting (term introduced in 2013 into the lighting industry 
that describes all kinds of lighting that positively affect 
human being’s mood, alertness, performance, health and 
well-being).  
The lighting system is composed of hue bulbs, hue 
light stripes for guidance and a central luminaire which 
consists of 3 lighting components: up-light (indirect light for 
ambient room illumination), down-light (diffuse task-light 
for facial brightening) and flexible spot (direct task-light for 
high visual requirements in the task area). The system will 
also integrate a set of sensors – proximity and motion 
sensors, temperature, humidity pressure, smoke and gas 
sensors, as well as door and window sensors; all this 
equipment will be integrated through an online platform that 
allows the user to program and control the system according 
to the subject needs, preferences and schedule. Moreover, 
monitoring the presence of the subject inside the home is 
possible, through a smartwatch worn by the elderly. Using 
the same smartwatch, the platform can send warnings to 
different numbers prior set in the case of a fall.  
In conclusion, the PETAL - Lighting System is an 
adaptable lighting system that represents a first step towards

an adaptive lighting solution in private homes for elderly 
with MCI. In connection with the PETAL platform, a 
flexible solution was created that is adaptable to a great 
variety of requirements that can occur in this setting. Further 
development that integrates automatic algorithms that 
produces necessary lighting rules because of gathered 
information from sensors can be the next step towards an 
optimized, adaptive lighting solution. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
To sum up, PETAL System is part of the cognitive 
interventions among MCI patients that aims to prevent, slow 
down or even reverse the progression of this pathology. 
Through its personalizing lighting system and adaptive 
interface it is going to extend the time older people can live 
in their home environment by assisting them during the 
activities of daily living as well as increase their autonomy 
by triggering the non-visual effects of light. 
Until now all the components of the PETAL 
system have been tested and integrated with each other in 
order to be fully operable and a mock-up trial has been 
successfully performed. Thus, the system is ready to be 
installed in our patient’s homes so that it can be evaluated 
whether it is able to reduce the neurocognitive progression. 
In order to objectify this hypothesis, we performed 
neuropsychiatric tests on our patients (Neuropsychiatric 
inventory, Mini Mental State Examination, Activities of 
Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
Questionnaires, Quality of Life Questionnaire, Rey 
Auditory and Verbal Fluency Test, as well as Raven 
Matrices, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Stroop Test) 
prior to the field trial of the system and it will be performed 
once again after the end of the testing phase. What is more, 
using the Zarit Burden interview we will be able to measure 
the impact PETAL System has on caregivers as well.
