Abstract—Zigbee/IEEE 802.15.4 is a high level communication 
and short range standard in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), 
where each node can send and receive data with high security, 
reliability, low complexity, low power consumption and low 
cost. It is utilized by industry leaders, such as Samsung, 
Motorola, Siemens, Philips, etc., and used in industrial, medi-
cal purposes, control and monitoring applications. ZigBee 
supports two operation modes; beacon enabled mode and bea-
conless enabled mode. In this paper, we present the optimal 
values of two parameters used in the Zigbee standard, name-
ly,  BO (Beacon Order) and SO (Superframe Order), to en-
hance the network performance, which can be obtained by 
increasing the network throughput as well as decreasing the 
total energy consumption and end-to-end delay. The experi-
ment was applied on a star topology, along with an improved 
backoff mechanism for ZigBee networks. The results showed 
that the best BO and SO values that increases the throughput, 
decreases the end-to-end delay as well as decreases the total 
energy consumption is (8, 8).

 INTRODUCTION 
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard (Zigbee) [1] is a technologi-
cal standard for high level communication in WSN, which 
approved to assign protocols for the data link, Mac and phys-
ical layers. This standard is essentially based on IEEE Low 
Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks. It connects between 
two devices in the lower level of communication that makes 
it useful for low data rate, low power and low cost networks,  
such as WSN [1][2]. It is developed by the ZigBee Alliance 
[5], and its name came from a zigzag type of dance, which is 
used by the honeybee to inform the other bee hive members 
that a new source of food is detected [6]. ZigBee protocols 
are directed towards earning remote control applications, like 
wearable health monitoring systems [4].  
The MAC layer of IEEE 802.15.4 standard deals with 
two kinds of network topologies; star and peer to peer net-
works, and it supports two work modes; beacon mode, and 
beaconless mode [3]. 
To avoid a collision that appears in the network while 
transmitting in the same time and cause loss of data when 
using beacon mode, a popular approach is used, called slot-
ted Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance 
(CSMA/CA) that determines the devices which can rival 
with the other devices during the access of the channel [8]. 
There are two ways for channel access: the first way is 
Contention Free Period (CFP), where the Personal Area 
Network (PAN) coordinator assigns small period of time for 
each node in the Superframe to do whatever it needed with-
out contention or latency, this time is called Guaranteed 
Time Slot (GTS). The second way is Contention Access 
Period (CAP). In the beaconless mode the un-slotted 
CSMA/CA approach is preferred [3][13]. In both modes, the 
nodes which depend on IEEE 802.15.4 standard try to send 
their data, and, if the collision happens when more than one 
node sends in the same time, the user waits for a little period 
of time, called backoff time; then, it tries to resend its data 
again after that time is finished. 
Backoff time is computed through a linear function se-
lected randomly from the range of [0-2BE-1], where BE 
symbolizes the backoff exponent that is required to deter-
mine the amount of time that a node have to wait before 
trying to send again [4]. 
The Beacon is a message with a particular form used to 
synchronize the clock of the node in the network. Two se-
quential beacons include among them one superframe, which 
is splatted into 16 active periods of time slots as well as an 
elective idle amount of time, where all nodes can weight if 
the sleep mode is enabled as shown below in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  E SuperFrame Structure. 
The process of using the beacon message can be clarified 
as follows: A coordinator sends the beacon signals to the 
node to start sending its data (beacon enabled PAN). On the 
other hand, the beaconless mode has no GTS time, but it has 
CFP, which makes an advantage for it because it saves the 
battery life unlike the beacon mode [2]. 
The paper presents the optimal BO and SO value to im-
prove the network performance. The network improvements 
are gained by increasing network throughput, as well as de-
creasing the end-to-end delay and total energy consumption. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows; Section II pre-
sents a literature review of several techniques used in ZigBee 
networks. Next, Section III shows the simulation and ob-
tained results. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section IV.

RELATED WORK 
Many researches have been performed in the domain of 
the ZigBee networks; mostly, these researches are about how 
to improve the network throughput as well as decreasing the 
total energy consumption and average end-to-end-delay, that 
can be summarized as improving the network performance. 
Rao et al. [4] have suggested an Adaptive Backoff Expo-
nent (ABE) algorithm, where BE amount was administered 
depending on device's participation to the network passing. 
ABE executes a variable macMinBE and approved it just by 
devices participated in the transference activity. Moreover 
ABE leads to solve the potentiality of the devices to choose 
amounts as same as the BE amounts raised essentially by the 
little quantity of potential BEs. Thus, devices will backoff a 
corresponding period of time producing collisions. Hence 
ABE cannot back PANs with great scales.  
Rohm et al. [6] have studied the impact of changing fun-
damental backoff values, such as macMaxBEs, macMinBEs, 
and macMaxCSMA, on the efficiency of beaconless ZigBee 
networks; the study was performed under several traffic 
loads by suggesting a dynamic scheme for estimating the 
best backoff values. Where the new dynamic scheme contin-
uously observes different network traffic indicators and 
change backoff parameters, according to it. Furthermore, 
they evaluated the traffic loads by observing the packet loss 
and latency averages at every node to avoid extra communi-
cations for nodes, which are needful in the centrally managed 
algorithm. Also, they ensured that there are no invisible 
nodes in the whole radio range of nodes. The simulations 
were implemented by using several packet sizes, such as 133 
byte long packets. 
Huang et al. [7] have combined two types of wireless 
technologies, which are: (WLAN) Wireless Local Area Net-
work (IEEE 802.11b) and ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) in the 
health monitoring field They have suggested a cooperative 
existence scheme based on dynamic GTS allocation with 
preemptive technique for the Wearable Health Monitoring 
systems. They suggested two-layer-architecture: the first 
layer was released by Body Area Network (BAN) that con-
trols the communication between sensors on the body with 
the controller on the wrist. The second layer sends the infor-
mation received from ZigBee devices to the infrastructure 
network through WLAN. The new pattern works as follows: 
at first it quantifies the RSSI and Channel Utilization (CU) to 
locate the status of the channel, so if ZigBee channel is emp-
ty the PAN coordinator will choose it, otherwise the new 
approach will be called and start by calculating GTS through 
active period in each superframe.  
Ha et al. [10] have studied how to increase the through-
put and decrease the energy consumption for Zigbee 
CSMA/CA. They have suggested two techniques; the first 
one was depended on the collision and Clear Channel As-
sessment (CCA) values, where they increases and decreases 
the backoff exponent (BE) value regarding to transmission 
status. The second technique benefits from the CCA results 
by shifting the scope of backoff counters. They performed 
their simulation using the NS-2 simulator with 25 nodes and 
one coordinator, where there are no invisible nodes and all 
nodes forward data packets to the coordinator. And although 
that most Zigbee applications use a little amount of traffic 
load, each node may suffer from the saturating of the net-
work and radio congestion. The simulation shows that the 
proposed techniques improved the throughput by 29.9% and 
energy efficiency by 86.8%. 
Ko et al. [11] have presented a new State Transition 
Scheme to increase the network performance by modifying 
the BE values depending on the moving scheme base on the 
transmission conditions. In their simulation they have used 
the NS-2 simulator as well as modified NS-2 MAC simula-
tor. From their experiment they observed that the throughput 
and network performance increased after changing the min-
BE values to 1 rather than the original values that were cho-
sen from the range between 3 and 5. 
Lee et al. [12] have adjusted the amount of BE in the 
slotted CSMA/CA to an effective EBE value that is being set 
regarding to the volume of devices available in the PAN in 
the network. The backoff delay time of the nodes decreased 
regarding to the lack of nodes that joined the network. So, 
they initialized the EBE to the least value in the range be-
tween 2 and macMinBE value, and setting the battery life 
extension (BLE) in the beacon frame to 1 that increases the 
necessity to long backoff periods due to the increase of nodes 
that joins to the network. 
Khan et al. [14] have suggested the Improved BEB 
(IBEB) algorithm. Which decreases the potentiality that 
devices may choose amounts like BE amounts and waits for 
the same time of backoff. Devices uses a different value to 
compute the backoff time instead of the random choose of 
BE only. They pick temporary Backoff value greater than 
10% and less than 40% of the computed backoff period of 
time, either they hired the unit temporary Period (IP) to re-
duce the potential of picking both IB and BE. The outcomes 
of simulation exposed that IBEB is better than the BEB 
scheme while examined on various network scales and loads.

SIMULATION SETUP AND RESULTS 
DISCUSSION 
The optimal BO and SO value that achieves the best net-
work performance were investigated through an improved 
linear backoff mechanism, because using linear function is 
more suitable for ZigBee network to minimize the collision 
between different nodes in the network as well as minimiz-
ing the packets delay sustained by the backoff technique. 
Simulation evaluation was performed using QualNet v5.2 
simulator. QualNet is a simulator based on C/C++ program-
ming language, derived from GloMoSim simulator that was 
first issued in 2000 by Scalable Network Technologies 
(SNT) [9]. QualNet is designed to back simulation of large 
scale and different networks. It has a smooth graphical user 
interface that supports a lot of tasks, such as network scenar-
io creation, protocol design, and animated implementation.

The Performance metrics investigated in our study are:  
 
Throughput: volume of bits passes through the PAN 
per second.  
 
Average End-to-End delay: The average time, which 
the packet spends to move from the source device to 
the target PAN coordinator. 
 
Total Energy Consumption: The total amount of 
sending, receiving, sleeping and idle energy used by 
the PAN nodes.  
In the following, there are presented three groups of re-
sults that show the variance of network performance depend-
ing on the BO and SO values. Where the first group of re-
sults shown in Figure 3 indicates that the throughput increas-
es to reach its maximum value 2592 Bit/Sec at (BO, SO) =

(5, 1) as well as at (5, 5) and decreases to reach the minimum 
value 172.8 Bit/Sec when (BO, SO) = (4, 1).

imum value, which is 16.44958 Sec when (BO, SO) = (9, 6) 
and decreases to reach the minimum value 0.122474 Sec 
when (BO, SO) = (2, 1).

Figure 5 best summaries the results obtained from the 
previous figures. It was constructed by giving the all BO and 
SO values suitable ranks according to the results obtained 
from each studied metric, i.e., (8, 8) has the highest value, 
that make it the best (BO, SO) values, where (4, 4) comes on 
the next stage by presenting high amount of throughput, 
balanced with low amount of end-to-end delay and total 
energy consumption. Furthermore, the value (9, 6) comes at 
the end of the list by presenting the worst amount of end-to-
end along with the worst total energy consumption value.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
Zigbee is a high level communications and short-range 
standard in WSN, it consumes little power (small batteries) 
and low cost than alternative networks, such as Bluetooth or 
Wi-Fi. When more than one node tries to send data in the 
same time, collision and packets delay happens then, they 
have to wait for a little period of time, called backoff time. In

order to cope with these problems, the optimal BO and SO 
values that achieve best network performance on star topolo-
gy were presented, as the network improvements were 
gained by increasing network throughput as well as decreas-
ing the end-to-end delay and total energy consumption, con-
sidering the use of improved backoff mechanism for ZigBee 
network that minimizes the collision and packet delay be-
tween various nodes in the network. The results show that 
the best BO and SO value that increases the throughput, 
decreases the end-to-end delay as well as decreases the total 
energy consumption to is (8, 8). As a future work, we plan to 
study the effect of the BO and SO values on the same algo-
rithm using other topologies instead of the star topology; and 
then to compare the network performance in all studied to-
pologies to find out which one is the best. Another proposed 
work is to study the impact of the data traffic load and data 
traffic type on the performance of the Linear backoff algo-
rithm by changing the number of packets sent from the nodes 
to the PAN coordinator per each experiment under different 
traffic types.
