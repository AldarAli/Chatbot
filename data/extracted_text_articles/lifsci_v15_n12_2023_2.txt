Abstract—The reception of vibrations is a special sense of
touch, important for many insects and vertebrates. The latter
realize this reception by means of hair-shaped vibrissae all over
the body, but especially arranged in the mystacial pad around
the snout. Latest research activities focus on modeling these
sensor components to explain some biological behaviors/features
(Technical Biology) or to investigate their usage for technical
applications for, e.g., object surface and/or shape detection
(Bionics). In contrast to these works, we focus on the modeling
of the dynamic operation modes to be applied for dynamic
scanning patterns of objects. We set up a principal mechanical
model of a single vibrissa to describe these modes of operation:
passive and active vibrissae. They are either used passively to
sense environmental forces, e.g., wind, or actively, when they are
rhythmically moved to scan objects or surfaces. Consequently, the
vibrissa inspired model has to allow for stabilizing and tracking
control as well, but yet being able to detect (superimposed)
solitary excitations. Hence, the biological paradigm exhibits some
adaptive behavior, and so must the controller: to be adaptive
in view of both the randomness of the external signals to be
suppressed and the uncertainty of the system data.

I. INTRODUCTION
Tactile sensor technology seems nowhere near from playing
a key role in environmental exploration in mobile robotics,
especially when compared to optical sensing technology. Tak-
ing a glance at the world of biology, the sense of touch
provides necessary information for several species, e.g., mam-
mals, especially nocturnal animals like rats. They exhibit a
sophisticated tactile sense organ supporting tactile exploration
which complements the visual and aural sensing: the mystacial
vibrissae in the snout region, see Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. Mammals with vibrissae: a cat named ‘Alfred’ with whiskers (left),
and a rat (right) [3].
The rats beneﬁt from their vibrissae in different ways
while they are moved in different modes of operation [1],
[2]: they are involved in their social behavior, acquisition of
food, locomotion, navigation [4], [5], detecting air ﬂows [6].
They enable the rats to detect, localize and recognize objects
near their faces [7], including detection of object features
(orientation, shape, texture) [8], [9].
The mystacial vibrissae are arranged in an array of columns
and rows around the snout, see Fig. 2.
Fig. 2.
Schematic drawing of the mystacial pad (left) [10], follicle-sinus-
complex of a vibrissa (right) [11].
The vibrissa itself (made of dead material) is mainly used as
a lever for the force transmission. But, in contrast to ordinary
hairs, vibrissae are stiffer and have a hollow conical shape
[10]. Each vibrissa in the mystacial pad is embedded in and
supported by its own follicle-sinus complex (FSC), see Fig. 2,
right. The FSC is characterized by its exceptional arrangement
of blood vessels, neural bonding and muscles.
Despite the distribution and difference of the vibrissae in
a mystacial pad with respect to their (varying) material and
geometrical features (multi-layer system, slenderness, conical
shape with inherent curvature inside this pad), we focus on
a single vibrissa, its surrounding tissue, its functionality and
mode of operation. For a more detailed overview see [12]. Due
to [13], the surrounding musculature is divided in extrinsic
and intrinsic one. The vibrissa can either be moved passively
(e.g., by wind), or actively through alternate contractions of
the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The resulting rhythmic
pro- and retractions of the vibrissa, called whisking, are used
to scan surfaces and objects [11]. Relevant information can
be perceived by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of

the oscillation to each task. By observing rats accomplishing
several types of exercises, Berg and Kleinfeld in [14] could
distinguish two main whisking patterns: exploratory whisking
when rodents explore their environment with large amplitude
sweeps in a low frequency (5-15Hz) range, and foveal whisk-
ing when rodents palpate object surfaces with small amplitude,
high frequency (15-25Hz) movements. Summarizing, the com-
plex FSC- and muscle-system enables the rodents to use their
vibrissae in two different ways (modes of operation):
• In the passive mode, the vibrissae are being deﬂected
by external forces (e.g., wind). They return to their rest
position passively — thus without any muscle activation.
• In the active mode, the vibrissae are swung back- and
forward by alternate contractions of the intrinsic and ex-
trinsic muscles. By adjusting the frequency and amplitude
of the oscillations, the rodents are able to investigate
object surfaces and shapes amazingly fast and with high
precision [15].
But, how the animals convert these multiple contacts with sin-
gle objects into coherent information about their surroundings
remains unclear and is not of focus in this work. However,
from the point of view from control theory, every biological
sensory system has the ability to constantly adapt its sensi-
tivity to its current environment in a way that empowers it
to distinguish the relevant information out of the multitude
of negligible stimuli (→ adaptive system). Several control
strategies enhance the relevance-oriented stimulus processing:
• a feedback-loop (closed-loop control system) enables
the rodents to immediately react to an object contact:
they slow down the concerned vibrissae, diminishing the
occurring wear-out effect on the hair [16], [17],
• depending on the mode (passive or active) and the ex-
pectations of the rodent, the neurons reaction is being
suppressed, enhanced or left unaltered [18]–[20].
Therefore, this biological sensor system is highly interesting
for applications in the ﬁeld of autonomous robotics, since tac-
tile sensors can offer reliable information, where conventional
sensors fail (in dark, smoky or noisy environments).
In the following Section II, we give a very brief overview
on mathematical models to describe the rigid-body motion of
vibrissa-like mechanical systems. In Section III, we set up
a simple model of a single vibrissa, derive the equations of
motion for a stringent mathematical treatment. For this, we
present some aspects of control theory for this systems in Sec-
tion IV. We introduce a general system class this equations of
motion belongs to and show some output feedback controllers
mimicking the adaptive nature of the mentioned different
modes of operation of a vibrissa. Numerical simulations in
Section V show the effectiveness of these controllers in λ-
tracking some reference signals such that the system is in a
passive or active mode. The main difference to [1] is presented
in Section VI, where we –additionally to new adaptors– focus
on noise-corrupted outputs due to some measurement failures
and show that the suggested adaptive tracking strategies still
work effectively. Section VII concludes the paper and closes
with an outlook.
II. STATE OF THE ART - MODELING ANIMAL VIBRISSAE
An intensive literature overview of technical vibrissa models
(rigid body and continuum) has been presented in [21]–[23].
Here, we brieﬂy discuss some models therein, where we
restrict the investigations to rigid body models, continuous
models are in recent exploration.
The following summarizes the relevant information of the
encountered mechanical models found in the literature for this
paper.
• Mitchinson in 2004 [24] and 2007 [17] - Model of the
FSC: Mitchinson’s research group has developed a model
of the FSC to increase the knowledge over this biological
sensory system on the one hand, and on the other hand
to promote the development of innovative and efﬁcient
tactile sensors. Following the anatomy in literature, the
scientists modeled the various layers of the FSC, linking
them with spring and damping elements to simulate the
compliance of the biological tissue (see Fig. 3).

• Berg in 2003 [14] - Determination of the range of
movement of the vibrissa: The function of the musculature
in the mystacial pad was investigated by Berg and Hill
in [14]. They recorded electromyogram (EMG) activity
from the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles while rats were

whisking, to characterize the pattern of muscular dynam-
ics. The following observations were made during one
whisking cycle, also see Fig. 4:
– the protraction of the vibrissa is caused by the
contraction of the intrinsic muscle retracting the FSC
(→ angular deﬂection),
– the retraction of the vibrissa is induced by the
contraction of the extrinsic muscle retracting the
vibrissa at skin level (→ translatory shift).

hence: angular deﬂection in rostral direction ϕrest +
65◦, angular deﬂection in caudal direction ϕrest −
35◦, translatory shift ≈ 5mm in caudal-rostral di-
rection, translatory shift ≈ 3mm in dorsal-ventral
direction
• Hill in 2008 [25] - Model of the musculature in the mysta-
cial pad: The researchers developed a mechanical model
of the vibrissa, focussing on the relationship between
the various muscle contractions and the resulting vibrissa
motion. Furthermore, three vibrissa / follicle units, linked
by spring and damping elements, were incorporated in the
model so that the inﬂuence of the intrinsic muscle slings
on their neighboring follicles could also be considered,
see Fig. 5.
The fact that a passively deﬂected vibrissa returns to
its initial position without oscillating, implies that the
mystacial pad is overdamped. Summarizing:

The goal is not to recreate an exact copy of the biological
system, but to implement the speciﬁc characteristics of the
vibrissa needed for the detection of useful information in
challenging surroundings in a mechanical model. Principally,
the tenor of our investigations is from bionics: modeling live
paradigms, exploiting corresponding mathematical models in
order to understand details of internal processes and, possibly,
coming to artiﬁcial prototypes (e.g., sensors in robotics). We
point out that we focus on a single vibrissa and not on a tuft
of various vibrissae as in [27].
III. A FIRST MODEL OF A SINGLE VIBRISSA
In this section, we present a ﬁrst vibrissa-inspired sensor
model and derive the corresponding equations of motion.
Following [13] and as mentioned in Section I, the vibrissa is
supported by its FSC. Important parts of it are an enveloping
chamber with controllable blood supply, and intrinsic and
extrinsic muscles which control the vibrissa motions. This
biological description suggests physical models as sketched
in Fig. 6, and these then lead us to the mathematical model
based on the pendulum device in Fig. 7.

The model has a viscoelastic support (skin level) and is

vibrissa amounts to ca. 100◦ = 1.74 rad, the amplitude
of the exploratory reference signal (5) can be chosen to

≈ 0.8 rad. The frequency of the signal ϕref1(t)
has been set to f = 5 Hz according to the ﬁndings in [14].
Foveal whisking has been implemented with the reference
signal (6), using an amplitude of A = 0.2 rad ≈ 12◦ and
a frequency of f = 25 Hz, since rodents scan speciﬁc
objects with small amplitude, high frequency movements
(15 − 25 Hz).

We have a good tracking behavior, the output is captured by
the tube. This seems to be true because the error is captured
by the tube around zero, see Fig. 13 (left). Let us point out that
we omit the ﬁgure of the output for reasons of presentation
(oscillations with high frequency to be tracked) and focus on
the error in the following. The controller gain is given in
Fig. 13 (right). Fig. 14 shows the control torque that very
weakly responds to the local disturbance.

Again, and also in simulation of another active mode (foveal
whisking), we have a good tracking behavior because the
controller works effectively, see Figs. 15 and 16. But, it is
quite hard to detect the gust of wind in the system variable.
Only the control torque reﬂects the “peak” around t = 20 s, see
Fig. 16. Therefore, we try to detect the additional excitation
by means of other observables.
This problem is tackled in the next section.
VI. IMPROVED ADAPTATION LAWS AND CONTROL
SCHEMES
The foregoing simulation shows that the system is not really
sensitive to notice the excitation peak around t = 20, though
tracking and stabilization are essentially guaranteed. Moreover,
after the control objective is achieved, the gain parameter still
stays at its high value. Figs. 11 (right), 13 (right) and 15 (right)
show the monotonic increase of k(·) towards a limit k∞. But,
if some perturbation repeatedly caused the output to leave the
λ-strip, then k(t) would take larger values again and again.
The aim is now to avoid this drawback.
At ﬁrst, we introduce some modiﬁcations of the control
strategy (3) presented in [1]. These show up with an altered
feedback law allowing for output disturbances and various
adaptors. Let the control system be of class (2). Then, let
us consider controllers of the general form:

Here, one cannot clearly see the advantage of two alternat-
ing exponents. The gain parameter k(·) increases very fast in
the beginning of the simulation, see Fig. 19 (right). This is
due to the “switching on” of the controller. It forces e faster
into the tube at cost of a high k. Then, k decreases if e
stays in the tube for a duration larger than td, see Fig. 19
(right). The error e is forced back into the λ-tube very fast,
see Fig. 19, because the attraction of the tube is stronger for
small deviations ∥e(t)∥ − λ > 0. This is on the expense of a
tolerable overshooting of k at the beginning, mentioned above.
But, interestingly, we are also able to detect solitary excitations
in observing the gain k(·) instead of Mu(·), see Fig. 20.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
The foregoing considerations have shown that adaptive
control is promising in application to vibrissa systems. In
particular, it allows, based on the dynamical equations, to
describe two main modes of operation of vibrissae: passive and
active ones. More precisely, these control strategies allow the
artiﬁcial system to proceed its scanning procedure / its mode
of operation (e.g., to investigate the surface texture of objects
as in [35]) despite the existence of external disturbances —
as in nature. Hence, the presented controllers can mimic
the adaptive nature of this paragon using adaptive control
schemes. Further on, improved adaptive controllers are useful
to diminish high gain factors to reduce an overload of the
scanning device. As mentioned in this paper, the presented
controllers are also robust with respect to output measurement
noise.
Therefore, this research on improved controllers should
be developed further. Simultaneously, the following prob-
lems/tasks are under investigation: separation of an extra
receptor from vibrissa to hopefully get more insights into
this sophisticated biological system and its data processing,
and identiﬁcation techniques to get knowledge of solitary
excitations.
Near future tasks are
• replace the simple model of a circular pendulum by
spherical one (to model spatial receptivity),
• tuning of the adaptors (i.e., to ﬁnd favorable values of γ,
σ, td), and investigating rates of convergence,
• hardware experiments to validate the theory,
• to develop elastic vibrissae models, e.g., multi-body sys-
tems and/or continuum systems,
• consider a tuft of vibrissae (modeling the intrinsic mus-
culature), not only a single vibrissa.
After doing this, one can think about the application
of the presented tracking scenario to replace the kinematic
drive/kinematic scanning trail in present application for recog-
nition of object contours and/or texture in, e.g., [33], [34].
