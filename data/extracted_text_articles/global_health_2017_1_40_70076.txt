Abstract -- Cervical cancer prevention is dependent on frequent
Pap
smear
screening
based
on
national
guidelines
and
recommendations. Several identified barriers to health access
may prevent women in several Latin American countries from
receiving the consistent care necessary to prevent cervical
cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
effectiveness
of
a
peer-education
based
women’s
health
program in increasing Pap screening adherence and cervical
cancer awareness in a rural Nicaraguan community. In this
community trial, researchers created an ambassador model for
community education and evaluated the effects by way of
surveys and chart review at a local clinic.

I.
INTRODUCTION
In Nicaragua, cervical cancer is the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths, with an estimated 18.43 deaths per
100,000 females in 2011 [1]. Prevention of cervical cancer
is largely dependent on periodic Pap smear screening. The
nature of this test makes it highly specific, but only
moderately sensitive, requiring periodic testing to ensure
results remain accurate [2]. Access to consistent health care
is difficult in many Latin American countries due to
educational, socioeconomic, and cultural barriers [3][4].
There is a larger difference in the mortality of cervical
cancer
than
the
incidence
of
cervical
cancer
when
comparing
these
numbers
between
developed
and
developing nations [5]. This supports the idea that the
greatest risk factor leading to death from cervical cancer is
the lack of regular screening or health care intervention.
The
objective
of
this
study
is
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness of a peer-education based women’s health
program in increasing Pap screening rates and cervical
cancer awareness in a rural Nicaraguan community.
In section II,
we describe
the
methods
used
by
researchers to establish the education program and perform
the 2 separate chart reviews. In section III, we present a
summary of the pertinent raw data from both the survey
assessments and chart reviews. In section IV, we present the
qualitative data obtained from education sessions. In section
V, we combine quantitative data and qualitative data and
discuss
limitations
and
future
indications
for
this
investigation.
II.
METHODS
Investigators used an educational model and materials
previously validated by Moffitt Cancer Center [6] on a rural
US Hispanic population to develop a health education
ambassador system. Community leaders (n=11) in a small
rural
Nicaraguan
community
were
identified
via
collaboration with a local non-governmental organization
(NGO), recruited, trained, and then instructed to educate
other women (n=29) in a session-based manner. These
sessions were organized by the ambassadors in local homes,
and the participants in attendance were friends or family
members recruited by the ambassadors. Sessions were held
in small groups in living rooms or private terraces to
encourage conversation amongst participants. Data was
collected through questionnaires and structured discussion.
Eligibility for both ambassador and participant groups
was dependent on age (21-70), gender (female), and
location (living within the community of Cedro Galan).
Specific eligibility for community leaders to serve as
ambassadors included ability to be contacted via phone,
attendance to training sessions, and willingness to host
independent sessions.
The
success
of
this
education,
and
community
perceptions of Pap screening and cervical cancer, were
measured through a survey (n=40). This survey contained
both true/false items for evaluation of knowledge and scaled
health prevention readiness measurements.
All discussion topics were archived by researchers and
coded for categories for qualitative analysis.
A chart review was performed at the local clinic in order
to establish baseline community Pap screening adherence
(n=564). Eligible charts from women ages 21-70 were
reviewed and recorded based on age, smoking status, Pap
screening history and records, and available comorbidities.

QUANTITATIVE DATA
A. Survey Results
Comparisons made between pre-session survey and
post-session survey are presented in Table 1. For the two
questions presented in Table 1, the results were consistent
with p values of p=0.09, and p=0.61, respectively. These
results are further discussed in the conclusions section
below.

B. Chart Review Results
Baseline chart review data for the 564 patients reviewed,
the mean age was 38.6 years (+/- 12.4 years) with a
minimum of 21 years and a maximum of 70 years. The
review indicated that 498 (88.3%) of eligible women lacked
positive Pap screening information in their clinic chart. Of
the 66 (11.7%) women that had Pap screening on record, 2
(3%) had an abnormal result possibly indicative of cancer.
Of the charts reviewed, smoking data was only available for
34 (6%) patients. Of these patients, 4 (11.8%) were listed as
current or past smokers.
IV.
QUALITATIVE DATA
Participants
identified
multiple
barriers
to
effective
cervical cancer prevention in their community based on
personal experience. Qualitative data was assigned to
categories to develop the following themes shown in Table
2 below. All participants agreed with the need to prevent
cervical cancer and increase awareness in their community.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
The overarching goal of this multi-part study was to
increase cervical cancer awareness and identify a method
for effective community education. While the survey data
did not provide evidence of a change in cervical cancer
awareness
following
participation
in
the
educational
program, researchers identified several confounding factors,
including the unfamiliarity of the population with the survey
format. The formatting used included several categories
with answers coded in a graduated format (very likely,

population despite repeated instruction by researchers. This
finding
may
be
useful
for
future
studies
in
similar
communities and an additional long-term study should be
completed to test a reformatted and more intuitive survey
with simplified questions coded with only two or three
predetermined answers. Future studies may test follow-
through with cervical cancer prevention information learned
during educational sessions by way of increased Pap
screening adherence in the population. Follow-through
might be monitored by way of further chart review and
survey at the local clinic. With regards to the low screening
rates indicated by the chart review, it must be considered
that women do have some access to public healthcare, and
may
have
obtained
their
screening
at
more
remote
healthcare locations. Future study via survey will measure
prevalence of screening regardless of clinic location.
Significant value was found in the formatting of this
program to provide a small, safe space for discussion of
sensitive topics, to encourage questions, and for the sharing
of knowledge. The identified themes suggest that barriers to
adequate cervical cancer prevention encompass several
aspects of daily living for women in rural Nicaragua. These
themes identified during this study may be used to create
additional opportunities for future educational sessions on
other health topics identified by the community.
