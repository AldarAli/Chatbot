Abstract—In order to access valuable indicator information
in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity, domain experts tend to use visual-
izations to quickly gain an overview of a given situation, even
more so in the age of big data where initially following visual
summaries tends to be more efﬁcient before diving into raw data.
For this purpose, researchers analyze the visual and functional
requirements of systems to facilitate data exploration. In this
paper, we conduct a trend analysis of latest research contributions
presented in VizSec symposia in terms of visualization techniques
and functional requirements. Additionally, an international and
a currently ongoing national project, focusing on Local Public
Administrations (LPAs) and Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are
analyzed and compared to current state-of-the-art research in
terms of requirements of real users in the ﬁeld of CIs and
LPAs. Particularly, a deﬁciency concerning the requirements of
collaboration, enhanced situational awareness, multi-stakeholder
involvement, and multi-stakeholder visualization were identiﬁed
and are discussed in the context of the utilization of cybersecurity
visualizations in their work environments.
Index Terms—requirements analysis; collaboration; situational
awareness; multi-stakeholder; visualization.
I. INTRODUCTION
Monitoring tools are meant to provide users with processed
data and, regarding human computer interaction, preferable
visualizations of various granularities. Tools evolved in terms
of functionality and monitored scope, trying to provide the best
possible user experience in times of big data and dynamic
environments. This is especially true in the ﬁeld of cyber-
security, where in an environment of increasing complexity
a continuous stream of potentially massive data needs to be
automatically preprocessed and classiﬁed for increased human
comprehension.
Despite the increased sophistication of cybersecurity mon-
itoring tools, current state-of-the-art research mainly focuses
on the concept of visualization for analyses and neglecting
additional needs of users regarding collaboration, enhanced sit-
uational awareness, multi-stakeholder involvement, and multi-
stakeholder visualization. These additional capabilities are
especially valuable in the context of Critical Infrastructure
Protection (CIP).
As the main point of monitoring tools focusing on dynamic
environments lies in the provision of real-time data visual-
izations, the core work mostly focuses on which types of
visualizations are used and how data can be interacted with in
order for the user to facilitate a deeper understanding of the
underlying data. In an organizational context, especially when
dealing with CI, it might not be sufﬁcient to determine the
state of a given situation and provide assistance in terms of CI-
related decision making on a purely technical level. The socio-
technical and social dimension within an organization is a key
factor for decision making: In order to implement a solution
to a cybersecurity problem, it is often necessary to collaborate
within the organization to decide on an appropriate course-
of-action. The decision making process includes employees
with different backgrounds on different levels of the organiza-
tional hierarchy. Yet the representation of the data describing
the issues is geared towards employees with a technical
background. In order to facilitate collaboration and informed
decision making on all levels, data representations that are
more suitable to employees without a technical background
should be investigated as well.
This shows that data driven cybersecurity requires signiﬁ-
cant consideration regarding data provision and visualization
for a wide range of stakeholders, e.g., technical personnel,
managers, ﬁrst responders, authorities, and the general public.
Crucial information needs to be tailored to user groups ac-
cording to their needs and ensuring irrelevant data is ﬁltered
out.
The main objective of this work is to analyze aspects
of functionalities and visualization used in state-of-the-art
research regarding cybersecurity monitoring tools, as well as
comparing their potential for integration in existing workﬂow
processes of LPAs and CIs. The central research questions
addressed in this research paper are:
• What are current trends in state-of-the-art research for
administrations and organizations in terms of visual and
functional requirements?
• What are identiﬁed gaps between presented research
contributions and the needs of organizations?
After this introduction, this paper continues with Section
II describing the related work, providing mentions and eval-
uations from different domains (including CIP) regarding
visualizations and similar trend analyses. Section III inspects
core requirements analyzed in the context of the international
research project CS-AWARE [1] in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity
for LPAs, and the currently ongoing national research project
ODYSSEUS [2] aimed at creating a multi-layered risk model

in the CI sector. In Section IV, an additional analysis of state-
of-the-art research of visualization and functional concepts in
the domain of cybersecurity was conducted, followed by a
comparison with ﬁndings from the previous section. Section
VI provides a conclusion and outlook on future work.
II. RELATED WORK
Concerning detection and analysis of cyber incidents, the
human factor plays an essential role in the continuously
evolving environment of cybersecurity. A variety of tools with
different focus areas keep on emerging and all of them bring
their own techniques and visualizations to address the speciﬁc
problems at hand in that area.
According to D’Amico et al. [3], who conducted a survey on
cyber operators in terms of cybersecurity visual presentations,
the human factor is regarded as a critical part in assessing
various situations and consequential decision making. The ma-
jor issue being addressed is the ﬂuctuant effectiveness of data
visualization due to subjectivity, different levels of experience,
as well as different goals of respective user groups. Their
ﬁndings concerning visualizations concluded that visualiza-
tions are becoming increasingly more important than regular
text-based analyses, although they should still be provided for
deeper inspection. The greatest focus of the researchers with
respect to the questions asked was whether hours worth of
time and effort to learn discerning visualizations would pay
off, to which 10 out of 15 participants agreed.
Regarding the facilitation of decision making cited by Wag-
ner et al. [4], one of the major issues lies in the fact that a di-
agnostic routine in a continuously evolving environment such
as cybersecurity is virtually impossible. Generally, extensive
domain knowledge is necessary to derive valid assumptions.
Current trends show that instead of automating the process
of decision making, the existing data has to be automatically
analyzed and interactive visualizations as a basis for decision
making need to be generated from those results. To facilitate
comprehension, the output has to take the granularity of
information into account. Despite the advantage of visualizing
additional dimensions using 3D visualization techniques, a ma-
jority of tools and research contributions avoid their inclusion.
Concerning the overall type of visualizations used, 24 out
of 25 proposed systems support 2D visualizations, whereas
only 4 out of 25 proposed systems either only support 3D
visualizations or use it to complement their 2D visualizations.
Focusing on CI and CIP, Merabti et al. [5] explore major
challenges regarding CIP, differentiating between system mod-
elling, system of systems design (addressing the problem of a
complex internal heterogeneous ecosystem), (cyber-) security,
and crisis management. Concerning crisis management, the au-
thors developed a tool facilitating the discovery of vulnerabili-
ties and study cascade effects of crisis management processes.
The user interface mainly relies on a 2.5D geographical map
with a node-link diagram overlay.
Nukavarapu and Durbha [6] present a dynamic simulation
model for real-time situational awareness for operational risk
management in CIs during disasters. By employing a colored
petri net visualizing data provided through a Geographic
Information System (GIS) cascading effects can be simulated.
The usage of the model aims to provide assistance regarding
decision making and response planning for disaster response
personnel. Although use case scenarios were provided regard-
ing the motivation of the model’s usage, there were no domain
experts involved in the design or evaluation cycles.
Lee et al. [7] present a dynamic monitoring and analysis
system incorporating multiple CI and GIS datasets. The system
includes data processing and analysis capabilities regarding
efﬁciency and vulnerabilities, as well as simulation of ”what-
if” scenarios in the context of CI incidents. The visualiza-
tions include node-link diagrams over geographical maps,
line charts and textual representations. Follow-up work by
Tabassum et al. [8] provides demonstration scenarios based
on the previous work.
As part of communication and enhanced situational aware-
ness analysis, Thom et al. [9] [10] conducted user interviews
comprising of 29 domain experts from disaster response and
CI management regarding the results of a social media analysis
on a real world Twitter data set during the German ﬂood 2013.
While the results and the subsequent discussion with partici-
pating stakeholders provided various insights concerning data
provision and data processing, e.g., included media support
and classiﬁcation, the domain experts stated fake news as a
major concern.
Similarly, Mittelst¨adt et al. [11] introduce a visual ana-
lytics system for CIs with simulation features for cascading
effects. The system facilitates enhanced situational awareness
by analyzing Twitter messages linked to a given incident. The
targeted users consist of various stakeholders from different
domains, i.e., analytics experts and police, grouped into crisis
managers, site commanders, or ﬁrst responders. User evalu-
ations and interviews conducted with domain experts from
CIs and government provided positive feedback. A signiﬁcant
limitation stated during interviews was the aspect of fake news
regarding analyzed Twitter messages.
Puuska et al. [12] present a CI simulation system focusing
on the aspects of situational awareness and collaboration
regarding data sharing. They conducted user interviews with
domain experts and stakeholders from different CIs, mobile
network operators, and rescue service providers (e.g. police
force) resulting in a set of requirements covering collaboration,
interoperability, multi-stakeholder needs, visualization, as well
as general system requirements. The applied visualization
techniques focus on node-link diagrams over a geographical
map and line charts displaying the impact of natural disasters
on CI.
III. ANALYSIS OF USER REQUIREMENTS IN THE CI AND
LPA SECTORS
The following section analyzes requirements of nationally
and internationally funded projects in the ﬁeld of security,
including the CS-AWARE project [1], and the currently on-
going ODYSSEUS project [2]. Special attention is given to

SECURWARE 2020 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

the concept of enhanced situational awareness to extend the
regular scope.
A. Requirements Analysis in CS-AWARE
In the context of the CS-AWARE project [1], which focuses
on the concepts of enhanced situational awareness and infor-
mation sharing for LPAs, multiple end-user workshops orga-
nized in form of focus group interviews were conducted during
the design cycles with cybersecurity and representatives from
various LPA user groups (including executives, operations,
and external stakeholders, i.e., the general public). During the
evaluation cycles, a set of technical evaluations in form of
user studies and UX interviews were conducted followed by
the completion of questionnaires, if applicable.
1) User Requirements: The user requirements were ac-
quired during the design cycle’s workshops types with the
project’s end-user partners, the cities of Rome and Larissa. The
workshops provided insights into internal processes, structure,
and limitations of LPA operations. In the workshops, the
domain experts reported their experience in form of stories
in collaborative groups starting with individual experiences
and afterwards broadening them by adding more details about
the context, issues, and the outcome of events. Stories in-
cluded various topics ranging from fake news to sharing
potentially sensitive data through web conferencing tools. The
involved user groups consisted of managers (n=5), system
administrators (n=6), and local service users (n=2) in Rome,
and manager (n=1), system administrators (n=3 + 1 unit
manager) and local service users (n=2) in Larissa. The results
of the workshops allowed to derive requirements based on
each user groups objectives, including ”reduction of time for
threat understanding” and ”more effective relation with service
providers in handling cybersecurity”, system artifacts, i.a.,
”report of information shared by other LPAs” and ”weekly
incident reports”, and the desired behavior, i.a., ”Regular
communication with technical team and internal users” and
”collaboratively discussing solutions”, during the deployment
of the system.
2) Visual Requirements: Regarding the visual components
used, the CS-AWARE system primarily focuses on tabular
views and the provision of raw data. Used visualization tech-
niques belong to the 2D display and geometrically transformed
displays category, including a dartboard chart and a node-
link diagram. The system focuses on textual representations
of information and provides the users with a high degree of
interaction including searching and ﬁltering textual and visual
representations, as well as zooming and panning the interface
elements.
3) Functional Requirements: The main concepts of the
CS-AWARE project are, i.a., collaboration and an extended
aspect of situational awareness, as the latter focuses on the
gathering of data from a multitude of external sources, as
well as building a threat sharing community consisting of
CS-AWARE users. Kupfersberger et al. [13] describe the
information ﬂow model of the CS-AWARE project providing
an in-depth analysis regarding its functional requirements.
One of the major requirements of the domain experts was
the functionality of interoperability, speciﬁcally to seamlessly
support the integration of the system into the existing work
environment. This includes the sharing of ﬁndings between
applications, i.e., data import / export and email notiﬁcations.
B. Requirement Analysis in ODYSSEUS
During the ODYSSEUS project [2], which focuses on the
analysis of cascading effects between critical supply networks
in cities, the domain experts from various CIs stated collabo-
ration and enhanced situational awareness to be critical factors
concerning the life cycle of threats.
While the core functionality of CIs (i.a., power supply or
water supply) work independently from external networks and
therefore generally remain unaffected by external outages,
problems stated by the domain experts may arise from outside
their ﬁeld of activity, i.a., panic reactions from the population
and fake news. These erroneously undermine public trust
and pose a security risk for public administrations and the
population. The identiﬁed requirements include:
1) Project Environment: The project environment consists
of internal project partners encompassing research facilities,
industry, and federal ministries. After creating a set of use case
scenarios, multiple end-user workshops were conducted to
evaluate the assumptions. The ﬁrst workshop had the form of
focus group interviews with domain experts from different CIs.
After an initial assessment and adaptions of the use case sce-
narios, a set of subsequent workshops were conducted focusing
on various domain experts regarding business continuity, and
security from each CI involved.
2) Functional Requirements: In order to cope with potential
problems, which is largely done in collaboration with other
public administrations, a reliable ﬂow of communication be-
tween these administrations and the CIs has been identiﬁed
as essential.. In this regard, the requirement of information
sharing is to be underlined, as it facilitates timely reactions
of involved parties both in terms of communicating valuable
information, and in terms of collaboration regarding mitigation
actions and next steps.
Additional paths of information ﬂows concerning informa-
tion sharing facilitate enhanced situational awareness. While
this constitutes a favorable advantage for CIP and other
organizations, the domain experts stated the need for increased
assessment of public resources regarding trustworthiness, du-
plicates, and accuracy in order to correctly assess the situation.
IV. FOCUS, GAPS OF MAJOR TRENDS IDENTIFIED IN
LITERATURE
In order to objectively evaluate the work presented in
the Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec)
during the years 2017 to 2019, a set of different categories
were chosen ranging from visualization techniques to user
involvement. Additionally, as not all papers focus on the
demonstration of applications, general categories described by
Liu et al. [14] were used for the classiﬁcation of research
contributions.

A. Dimensions Evaluated
The following subsection describes new dimensions eval-
uated in this paper, derived from or complementing existing
categories.
1) Category of Contribution: Liu et al. [14] provide an
analysis of submitted research in Information Visualization
(InfoVis) concerning future trends, major goals, recent trends,
and state-of-the-art approaches. The authors classify these
works into four main categories: Empirical methodologies,
Systems & Frameworks, Applications, and Interactions. In the
context of this work the last category will be removed.
The category of contribution selects the main contribution
type presented by the authors. If authors use an application to
demonstrate their proposed model, then the contribution will
be assigned to the empirical methodology category, despite
also including an application.
2) Visualization techniques: Regarding visualization tech-
niques, a subset of categories identiﬁed by Keim [15] and
used by Wagner et al. [4] was selected consisting of: Standard
2D/3D Displays, Geometrically Transformed Displays, Iconic
Displays, Dense Pixel Display, and Stacked Display. Addition-
ally, as the VizSec specializes in the collaboration between
academia, government, and industry, the following categories
have been added or underlined form the list above:
• Maps as geographical visualizations. This category is part
of the Standard 2D/3D Displays category, but due to the
coverage of speciﬁc use cases, this subcategory will be
treated separately.
• Tabular View as a textual representation of summarized
or derived information, generally displayed as, but not
limited to, tabs.
• Raw Data as supporting the display to raw data regarding
the data source. This category is especially valuable to
gain an in-depth understanding after an initial analysis in
order to facilitate decision making.
Multiple categories can be selected due to a range of use
cases applicable.
3) Interactivity and Mapping: The functionality of con-
tributed applications is evaluated in part according to the
presence of interaction and distortion techniques by Keim [15]
and categorization by Wagner et al. [4]. The selected subset
consists of different degrees of Interactivity, Filtering, and
Dynamic or Static Mapping.
In addition to the categories listed in related work, we
identiﬁed several additional categories relevant for interactivity
and mapping, which is based on practical experience with user
requirements from the CI and LPA ﬁeld:
• Interactivity Low describes basic interactive features
between the user and the application, e.g., viewing static
visualizations.
• Interactivity High describes advanced interactive fea-
tures between the user and the application, e.g., inspecting
selections and applying ﬁlters.
• Collaboration as the functionality of collaboration be-
tween users using one application and external targets, or
between multiple instances of the same application.
• Customization as the functionality to adapt the appli-
cation view according to various parameters, i.a., color
palette.
4) User Involvement: The categories for user involvement
differentiates between the level of expertise of people involved
either in form of user interviews before or during the initial
design processes, or user studies during the design or evalua-
tion processes of the contributed research. The categorization
follows adapted user types described by [16] and consists of:
• No Users describes a research contribution with no in-
volved individuals during the design or evaluation cycles.
Use case scenarios exemplifying the usage of the pro-
vided contribution without actual real user involvement
also fall into this category.
• Lay Users are users without required domain knowledge.
• Novices are users with beginners knowledge of the do-
main, e.g., students in the required ﬁeld.
• Experts are users with extensive domain knowledge
generally working in the industry.
5) Included Content: The included content category pro-
vides an overview of all aspects involved comprising the
individual research contributions as follows:
• Tool, Prototype, etc. describes the usage of a technical
application either as the main contribution, or to support
the main contribution.
• Model, Approach, etc. describes the usage of novel
methods in order to tackle unique problem spaces through
new visualization techniques.
• User Study describes the involvement of real domain
experts for evaluation purposes.
• User Story/ Interview describes the involvement of real
domain experts for the purpose of gathering information
about the problem space being tackled.
B. Analysis of VizSec symposia 2017-2019
In the context of this work, we analyzed the years 2017
- 2019 of the VizSec symposia according to the categories
described above. The VizSec symposium constitutes a forum
of research contributions encompassing academia, govern-
ment, and industry, which provides a meaningful insight into
current trends. The results regarding relevant contributions
might differ according to the authors intent. The outcome of
the analysis is presented in Tables I to V, and are discussed
in Section IV-B4 and Section V.
1) VizSec 2017: In terms of visualization techniques used,
a majority of authors focus on simple 2D displays with
additional techniques, if their usage would support the purpose
of the work, i.a., dense pixel displays. Concerning interactivity,
nearly every proposed tool includes a form of high interac-
tivity characterized by the possibility to manipulate rendered
visualizations, i.a., by applying ﬁlters, panning, or zooming.
A major gap identiﬁed of the VizSec 2017 papers is the
functionality in terms of collaboration. Only two [17] [18]
11
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2020.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-821-1
SECURWARE 2020 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

out of ten papers addressed this topic, although Sethi and
Wills [18] only conducted expert interviews resulting in those
experts stating the need for collaboration without going into
further detail on how to ensure this functionality, or proposing
ways on the implementation. On the other hand, Franklin et
al. [17] designed a prototype speciﬁcally supporting a collabo-
rative process by implementing a shared space to ”brainstorm,
share notes and hold [their] brains during interruption”.
2) VizSec 2018: All authors include a form of 2D displays
as visualization techniques in their work with only Krokos et
al. [19] additionally using 3D display visualization techniques.
Apart from this aspect, nearly every author included another
visualization technique in order to complement their work.
In terms of interactivity, seven out of nine papers proposing
a tool or prototype implemented additional functionality for
increased interactivity of the system.
Again, the major scientiﬁc gap identiﬁed in the VizSec
2018 papers is the aspect of collaboration, as none of the
eleven papers discussed the importance of collaboration or
incorporated collaborative functionality into their prototypes.
3) VizSec 2019: Every author with focus on a presented
application included a form of 2D display into their research,
with four out of seven authors including another visualization
technique to complement their work.
The major gap identiﬁed in the VizSec 2019 papers is
again the aspect of collaboration, as none of the eleven papers
discussing or supporting the implementation of collaborative
functionality. Ulmer et al. [20] discuss collaboration as part of
future work.
4) Current Trends:
In terms of evaluation techniques,
Barkhuus et al. [21], is analyzing papers submitted to the CHI
conference and found that those techniques commonly used
in industry are generally unsuitable for academia as they are
speciﬁcally designed to meet the needs of businesses. In terms
of empirical evaluations, a strong shift in favor of qualitative
evaluations was detected.
Staheli et al. [16] analyzed the research submitted to the
IEEE VizSec symposia over a time period of ten years from
2004 - 2013. Their goal was to identify gaps in evaluation
approaches regarding information visualization. Concerning
the statement of Barkhuus et al. [21], the authors express
that the research provided in VizSec papers are designed to
be used in practical situations regarding real world use cases.
The core ﬁndings in terms of trend analysis showed a rise
regarding feature set utility, insight generation, and usability,
while the aspect of collaboration was barely present (2 out of
119 research contributions).
Current trends in the context of VizSec research contribu-
tions show that a majority of submissions tend to focus on the
presentation of novel applications or prototypes for visualiza-
tion, as shown in Table I, while empirical methodologies (i.a.
novel models or evaluations) ﬂuctuate between years.
In contributions focusing on the presentation of applica-
tions or prototypes, or using them to visualize underlying
models, a majority of research contributions use simple 2D
charts as visualization technique, as depicted in Table II.

Additional provision of textual representations or access to
raw data proves especially advantageous for domain experts
in conducted evaluations. Visualization techniques using iconic
displays or dense pixel displays tend to be part of empirical
methodologies to underline alternative aspects of data, which
consequently provides valuable input for further research.

As the main contribution of visualizations in cybersecurity
is related to data exploration and insight creation, applications
are bound to provide a high degree of interactivity - like
the functionality of brushing and linking for the purpose of
ﬁltering data. The category Dynamic Mapping is especially
relevant in this evaluation, as it constitutes an essential part of
situational awareness. Detailed results are provided in Table
III. The category of collaboration shows a signiﬁcant gap in the
cybersecurity ecosystem, despite a critical need for increased
increased cooperation and collaboration between cybersecurity
actors, as highlighted by the European cybersecurity strategy
of 2013 [51] and the Network and Information Security (NIS)
directive [52]. Although a few research contributions mention
the aspect of collaboration as part of related work, it is
generally not implemented by the presented conceptions.
Regarding user involvement in terms of interviews with
domain experts and evaluation processes, the results seem
to reﬂect the ﬁndings of Staheli et al. [16], as a majority
of users in presented research contributions were domain
experts vs. users with differing experience levels. Despite most
contributions include tools or use case scenarios, about one
third did not provide any end-user involvement (e.g. interviews

V. DISCUSSION OF IDENTIFIED GAPS
In the context of discussing gaps, the aspects of collabo-
ration, enhanced situational awareness, multi-stakeholder in-
volvement, and multi-stakeholder visualization are discussed,
as we have identiﬁed a need for cybersecurity visualizations
in this context from user feedback in the context of the two
research projects presented in Section III.
The analysis shows that collaboration is rarely a factor
in current state-of-the-art cybersecurity visualization research.
The beneﬁts of a collaborative approach include the facilitation
of information sharing between CI stakeholders and govern-
ment authorities during incidents and enhance mitigation and
response actions, as shown by Puuska et al. [12], and in the
context of CS-AWARE.
Regarding enhanced situational awareness, the current state-
of-the-art focuses on situational awareness within an organiza-
tion rarely exceeding the boundaries of a given organization. A
growing trend to CIP research can be observed in the context
of evaluations of Twitter posts as analyzed by Thom et al. [9]
[10] and Mittelst¨adt et al. [11]. The expectations of enhanced
situational awareness incorporate the analysis of external data,
i.a., social media or distinct information sharing communities,
in order to gather more knowledge regarding active threats
to facilitate responsive measures. Domain experts involved in
CS-AWARE and ODYSSEUS stated an increased need for data
analysis outside the organizational scope of LPAs and CIs.
Regarding multi-stakeholder involvement in the design and
evaluation cycles of a project, the general trend in state-of-the-
art analysis only incorporates the views of a single stakeholder
group at most. Puuska et al. [12] and Mittelst¨adt et al.
[11] incorporate views and processes of multiple user groups
ranging from analysts to ﬁrst responders. The expectations
include an increased incident handling capability to account
for multiple interdependent processes (i.a. supported incident
handling & data sharing across departments and increased
coordination with external organizations and authorities). Dur-
ing ODYSSEUS the need for the evaluation and adaption
of created use case scenarios arose, after which different
stakeholders were interviewed to gain insight into dependent
processes including domain experts from CIs and LPAs.
Regarding multi-stakeholder visualizations, the current state
of state-of-the-art research generally focuses on single use
cases for technical personnel to alleviate readability of pro-
cessed raw data. A majority of CIP related work provides
visualizations encompassing at least technical user groups
and facilitates coordination with other groups like, e.g., ﬁrst
responders, for which individual views need to be created. The
expectations of incorporating multi-stakeholder visualization
lies in the increased homogeneity of the ecosystem facilitat-
ing interoperability and collaboration. In the context of CS-
AWARE, the need for accommodating different user groups
(e.g. management, technical personnel) by representing data to
suit their speciﬁc requirements was clearly expressed during
the end-user workshops.
In order to meet those expectations, an initial assessment
of involved stakeholder groups is essential, highlighting indi-
vidual needs and desirable outcomes in terms of visual and
functional requirements. Furthermore, the results may expose
dependencies previously not taken into consideration. As a
recommendation, we propose:
• Using workshops and user interviews during early stages
of a project’s life cycle to assess and deﬁne the de-
sired outcomes for each user group. This includes the

assessment of what information is required by each user
group, and how data needs to be represented to meet those
requirements.
• Additionally, proposed systems need to take collaboration
and coordination efforts between multiple user groups
into account, including domain-independent stakeholders.
Notably, the functionality of supporting data/information
sharing provides stakeholders with the capability of efﬁ-
cient incorporation of a system into an existing environ-
ment.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work a gap analysis in the current state-of-the-
art of cybersecurity related visualizations is presented. The
requirements for cybersecurity visualizations of end users
from the LPA and CI sectors are analyzed, based on results
achieved during the two research projects CS-AWARE and
ODYSSEUS. A gap analysis with respect to the requirements
identiﬁed is conducted based on an in-dept analysis and
categorization of the VizSec symposia from 2017-2019.
The ﬁndings show a gap between the state-of-the-art re-
search and the extended requirements of LPAs and CIs
speciﬁcally in the context of collaboration, enhanced situa-
tional awareness, multi-stakeholder involvement, and multi-
stakeholder visualization. For each gap, we analyze the current
trend, as well as expectations resulting from the implementa-
tion of these aspects. Finally, we propose recommendations
aimed at increasing the efﬁciency of realization of projects
including multiple domain-interdependent stakeholders.
Future work encompasses the evaluation of analyzed aspects
and requirements to be included during the progress of the
ODYSSEUS project, and providing a proof-of-concept im-
plementation of cybersecurity related visualizations that take
the aspects of cooperation/collaboration and optimization of
visualizations for different user groups within the organization
into account.
