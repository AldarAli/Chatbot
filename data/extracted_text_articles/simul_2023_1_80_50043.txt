Abstract—Agent-based models can be used to assess the impact 
of different mixes of marketing and sales measures on home-
owner’s energetic refurbishment decision-making. During the 
last two decades, governments have been using especially mar-
keting-like measures (e.g., mass media campaigns) to push 
residential refurbishment – for a large part unsuccessfully. 
Only recently, more sales-like activities (e.g., visits of energy 
consultants) have been offered for that purpose. The question 
now arises whether this will be a more successful approach. 
This paper addresses the research question asking what mix of 
marketing and sales measures is optimal to support homeown-
ers during their refurbishment decision-making. 
Keywords— Agent-Based Modeling (ABM); refurbishment 
Decision-Making (DM); marketing and sales; empirically 
grounded.

 INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 
Much research has been published about the importance 
of residential refurbishment for sustainability. Germany’s 
building stock has been erected for the largest part before the 
existence of any energetic building standards. Furthermore, 
German homeowners tend to energetically refurbish their 
property slowly and doubtingly. Consequently, heating resi-
dential buildings consumes too much energy and is accom-
panied by a huge ecological footprint [1]. 
More recently, the dependence of many European coun-
tries on Russian gas for heating buildings and the war Russia 
has been fighting against Ukraine has recharged the debate 
that energy efficiency in housing should be improved and 
refurbishment should be speeded up to lessen the dependen-
cy on Russian gas. 
This paper draws on a previous idea contribution of the 
author as discussed in [2]. It deals with the question asking 
how governments can optimally push homeowners in the 
direction of a positive refurbishing decision with the help of 
marketing and sales measures. In the past, governments used 
mass media campaigns to do this. More recently, local gov-
ernments have been offering visits of energy consultants at a 
reduced (or even at no) charge to convince homeowners to 
refurbish. The question is whether there are optimal (cost 
efficient and concerning speed) mixes of marketing and sales 
measures that help homeowners make this decision positive-
ly. An empirically grounded Agent-Based Model for refur-
bishment is developed and the impact of different mixes of 
marketing and sales on refurbishment Decision-Making 
(DM) is simulated. 
Science has applied ABM in the context of the current 
energy transition numerous times before. Du et al. [3] con-
clude in their review that ABM has been developed to model 
socio-demographic factors, housing factors, social influ-
ences, and environmental attitudes as drivers of DM in a 
context of energy transition. Most ABM, however, have fo-
cused on solar energy diffusion and less research was done to 
study refurbishment. Furthermore, Du et al. [3] conclude 
“Future studies can also evaluate the effectiveness of market-
based policies […]” (p. 8). 
Jager already stated in 2007 that the effectiveness of 
marketing could benefit from social simulations like ABM 
[4]. He proposed different formalizations of the 4 P’s com-
monly used in marketing to be implemented in ABM (Prod-
uct, Price, Place and Promotion). Delre et al. [5] focus espe-
cially on promotional activities, which is the category where 
mass and personal communication can be classified. Until 
today, however, ABM applied in consumer behavior DM 
studies do not differentiate between marketing and sales. 
For both the literature concerning DM in an energy tran-
sition context, and ABM literature in the field of marketing, 
modeling an optimal usage of marketing and sales to push 
residential refurbishment is an interesting contribution. 
This paper is structured as follows. Section II briefly ex-
plains the key concepts used in this paper. Here, the Hierar-
chy Of Effects (HOE) model, the German Sinus lifestyle 
typology, and the ABM approach are discussed, as they are 
used to simulate the refurbishment DM of 17 Mi. homeown-
ers in Germany. Section III discusses all specifics and details 
of the developed ABM for refurbishment. Finally, Sec-
tion IV presents and discusses the modeling results and an-
swers the research question of this paper. 
II. 
KEY CONCEPTS USED IN THIS PAPER 
The objective of commercial communication (or “touch-
points”) is to have an impact on consumers and to support 
consumers in buying DM. A large body of research exists to 
assess this impact. HOE models represent a family of models 
that examine this impact of touchpoints on different steps in 
the buying behavior. In this logic, HOE models assume

forthcoming steps in the DM process can only be reached 
when previous ones have been effectively completed. Con-
sequently, the number of people who reach the next step in 
the process is usually reduced, compared to the previous 
step. This transfer from a previous step onto the next is 
called conversion. HOE models enable the calculation of 
transfer rates under the influence of communication – and as 
well under the influence of different kinds of communica-
tion: mass and personal communication. 
Section I mentioned that ABM has not distinguished be-
tween marketing and sales until today. HOE models can do 
exactly this: The first stages in the model are primarily im-
pacted by marketing (mass communication touchpoints), and 
the last stages primarily by sales (personal communication 
touchpoints). This is the main rationale behind applying the 
HOE logic within the ABM for refurbishment. 
In previous research, the author developed a HOE model 
for energetic refurbishment of residential buildings [6]. The 
resulting model is based on Lewis [7], Lavidge and Steiner 
[8] and is shown in Figure 1. This model assesses the impact 
of touchpoints on DM for energetic refurbishment. 
The ABM approach simulates decisions and/or behavior 
of different individual agents. These agents can interact with 
their environment, as well as with each other. Within an 
ABM, usually different agents behave according to their 
individual preferences, their characteristics, their interac-
tions, as well as their environment. Software for ABM al-
lows for the setup and description of different agents, their 
preferences, interactions, as well as their environment. In this 
way, the aggregated system with its dynamics (that emerges 
from many different individual behaviors) can be simulated. 
ABM is especially interesting when problems of emer-
gence are studied [9]. This work uses this approach to study 
refurbishment intention (after interactions with marketing 
and sales) at a lifestyle and system level.  
The last concept described is the Sinus Lifestyle typolo-
gy. The typology is used in marketing & sales, both in prac-
tice and in academics. The Sinus Institute has been monitor-
ing sociocultural developments and trends in the German 
society since the 1980ies and small adaptations to the life-
style typology are carried out regularly. The lifestyles are 
positioned in a two-dimensional space. The x-axis describes 
their orientation: Traditional towards progressive lifestyles. 
The y-axis describes social status: Lower class towards upper 
class. 
Ten lifestyles are located within this two-dimensional 
space. Previous research by the author [6] showed that de-
pending on the Sinus lifestyle, German homeowners have 
very diverse attitudes and behaviors concerning energetic 
refurbishment of residential housing. This work uses the 
Sinus lifestyle approach as it forms an efficient segmentation 
approach to create differentiated, empirically grounded, 
agents within the ABM.

After this brief description of the key concepts of this pa-
per, the following section will provide a detailed description 
of the ABM that was developed to simulate the impact of 
marketing and sales on homeowner’s refurbishment deci-
sions. 
 
III. 
ABM FOR REFURBISHMENT 
The ABM for refurbishment is based on empirical data, 
taken from [6] as displayed in Table 1. The representative 
sample (n = 4,471) describes the status quo of the DM con-
cerning energetic refurbishment of 17 mi. homeowners in 
Germany. 
It comprises Sinus lifestyle [10] data and their status quo 
concerning the DM process in the format of the developed 
HOE model as described in the previous section.  
As an example, the adaptive pragmatic lifestyle (with 
22.4% behavioral intention) is more than two times as likely 
to invest in energetic refurbishment compared to the precari-
ous lifestyle (9.3% behavioral intention). 
With the help of this data, conversion rates (CR) can be 
calculated, e.g., 65% of the social ecological lifestyle is con-
verted from knowledge (80.0%) to attitude (52.3%). 
Within the ABM for refurbishment, 17,000 agents 
(homeowners) are set up according to the distribution of the 
status quo in their refurbishment DM (as displayed in Ta-
ble 1) and taking into account the real sizes of the ten Sinus 
lifestyles in German society. 
The impact of touchpoints on each individual agent’s 
DM concerning energetic refurbishment is simulated with 
the HOE model. As a result of the interaction with various 
touchpoints an agent is guided through the five steps of the 
HOE model (see Figure 1). Taking one step within the HOE 
model is calculated with the help of a threshold variable. It is 
assumed that an agent’s threshold variable needs to reach a 
value of 4, prior to being transferred to the next step in the 
HOE model. Each touchpoint is increasing the threshold 
variable with a specific amount. Once an agent has been 
transferred, the threshold variable is set to 0 again. During 
the initialization of the model, the threshold variable is set 
randomly between 0 and 3. Each year, every agent’s thresh-
old variable is updated as a result of being exposed to (dif-
ferent) touchpoints. 
How much a specific touchpoint increases the threshold 
variable depends on the touchpoint itself. Touchpoints exist 
in many appearances and should not be generalized. Not 
every touchpoint generates the same impact. It is generally 
acknowledged in marketing and sales, that Mass Communi-
cation (MC) touchpoints (e.g., advertising campaigns and 
information brochures) are best suitable to transfer consum-
ers through the first stages of DM, especially awareness, but 
as well knowledge and to a lesser extend interest. Further-
more, Personal Communication (PC) touchpoints (e.g., sales 
talks) are generally more suitable to transfer consumers 
through the last stages of DM, especially intention, but as 
well conviction and to a lesser extend interest [11][12].

In the specific case of energetic refurbishment, home-
owner have varying informational needs. In the first stages of 
DM there is usually a stronger focus on information gather-
ing. In the later stages of DM, an interaction is usually nec-
essary, to assess and to judge different financial, technical, or 
constructional aspects of the energetic refurbishment [13]-
[15]. Especially these informational needs cannot be satisfied 
by mass communication alone. 
So, mass communication can unfold a full impact in the 
beginning, but no impact at the end of the DM process. Per-
sonal communication can unfold a full impact at the end, but 
no impact in the beginning of the DM process. 
This phenomenon is reflected in the model by incorporat-
ing a correction factor (CF) for the additions to the threshold 
variable. The correction factor for mass communication 
(CFMC) is decreasing for every consecutive step (1.0; 0,5; 0.0 
and 0.0) and the correction factor for personal communica-
tion (CFPC) is increasing for every consecutive step (0.0; 0.0; 
0.5 and 1.0) in the DM process. These values of the correc-
tion factors at specific stages of DM are assumed. Finally, 
every agent’s threshold variable is increased with a value as 
shown in (1) in each period. 
 
(CR * MC * CFMC) + (CR * PC * CFPC) 
()    
Equation (1) incorporates the variables MC as well as 
PC, which stand for Mass Communication (MC) and Per-
sonal Communication (PC). During the initializations of the 
model, these variables can be set equal to the amount of mass 
and personal communication that the agents is exposed to 
during one period (of the simulation). 
The amount of mass communication has a range between 
0 and 5, which means that a homeowner is exposed to one 
mass communication touchpoint (e.g., a television or a radio 
commercial or an online advertising) between 0 (no expo-
sure) and 5 times in one period. The amount of personal 
communication has a range of 0 to 5 as well. The meaning of 
this personal communication touchpoint range is linked to 
the number of energy consultants that is available and active. 
Currently, approx. 15,000 to 30,000 energy consultants for 
residential buildings are active in Germany, depending on 
the used definitions [16][17]. They realized approx. 280,000 
energy consultancy reports in 2022 (compared to approx. 
180,000 reports in 2021 and 100,000 reports in 2020 
[18][19]). Such an energy consultancy report is assumably 
the result of a series of five personal communication touch-
points (e.g., personal emails and phone calls and visits). So, 
30,000 energy consultants realized 1.4 mi. personal commu-
nication touch points in 2022. This paper assumes that 
30,000 energy consultants could realize a maximum of 3 mi. 
personal communication touchpoints, leading to a maximum 
of 600,000 energy consultancy reports per period, in the 
years to come. This maximum practically means doubling 
their output in terms of personal communication touchpoints, 
compared to already high 2022 levels. 
Section I described that in the past, governments mainly 
campaigned to push refurbishment. This can now be simulat-
ed with, e.g., MC = 5 and PC = 0. More recently, (local) 
governments have been offering and facilitating personal 
visits and consultancy by energy consultants in a limited 
way, which can be seen as a sales measure. This can now be 
simulated with, e.g., MC = 5 and PC = 1. The impact of any 
mix of marketing and sales measures can now be simulated 
by the model. 
Section I mentioned as well that some ABM include so-
cial influence to simulate DM in a context of energy transi-
tion. Baranzini et al. investigated social influence in photo-
voltaic panel diffusion in Switzerland and conclude that “So-
cial contagion is also a driver of adoptions in the private sec-
tor”. They add “We also confirm […] that social contagion is 
a very localized and short-term phenomenon, whose strength 
declines with distance and time.” [20]. The ABM for refur-
bishment incorporates this phenomenon in the following 
way. Each positive refurbishment decision in the direct 
neighborhood of an agent leads to an acceleration of the DM 
process. This is implemented in the model by increasing the 
threshold variable by 30% for every neighboring agent’s 
positive refurbishment, as shown in (2). 
 
( + (No. of agents * 30%)) 
()    
Potentially, the acceleration can reach multiples of 30%. 
The maximum acceleration however is set to 120% (because 
of 4 neighboring agents, or more than 4 neighboring agents, 
taking positive refurbishment decisions). This acceleration 
effect is limited to two periods after the period of the refur-
bishment. In the model 5,041 districts with 17,000 home-
owners exist. Each district has an average of 3,4 homeown-
ers. 
Another essential aspect of touchpoints is their price. In 
general, mass communication is less costly than personal 
communication. A common way to quote prices in mass 
media is with the help of the costs per mille (CPM) metric, 
which expresses the price per 1,000 views. Price ranges for 
CPM vary greatly, as media vary greatly in type and quality. 
An average CPM for mass media in the ABM for refurbish-
ment is set to € 13.50. This is based on a media mix of Tele-
vision (30 seconds advertisement, median $ 36 CPM), Radio 
(30 seconds advertisement, median $ 6.75 CPM), Online 
(300 x 250 banner ad, median $ 2.27 CPM) and magazines 
(full page color ad, median $13.24 CPM) [21]. US-Dollar ($)

costs for a personal communication touchpoint in the ABM 
for refurbishment is set to € 16.67. It is assumed that a sales-
person costs € 80,000 per year and has 200 working days per 
year. During a typical 5-day work week in average of 16 
potential customers can be visited. Furthermore, during each 
working day, 10 phone calls and 10 Emails can be processed. 
This leads to 4,800 touch points, or € 16.67 per touchpoint. 
An optimization of refurbishment intention and costs is 
not sufficient, as the speed of refurbishment needs to in-
crease (see Section I). As time is an importance factor, this 
paper limits the modeling time to 27 years (2023 to 2050) 
and tries to identify the costs for more refurbishment speed. 
Finally, it must be mentioned that the ABM for refur-
bishment was realized in the Netlogo environment [22]. The 
model’s code is available under GitHub [23]. The simulation 
results were imported in Microsoft Excel to analyze and plot 
them. 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This section presents and discusses the results of the 
ABM for refurbishment. First, the impact of different levels 
of mass and personal communication over a fixed period of 
27 years (from 2023 – 2050) are investigated. Therefore, a 
first sample was created that consists of 720 observations 
(n = 720). One observation is the result of running the ABM 
for refurbishment 27 years. 20 observations were done for 
every combination of Mass Communication (MC) and Per-
sonal Communication (PC) between 0 and 5 (see Sec-
tion III), to account for stochasticity in the model. Second, 
this paper looks into the velocity of developing refurbish-
ment intention, for which a second sample is created. This 
sample consists again of 720 observations (n = 720), howev-
er, the ABM for refurbishment only runs until a refurbish-
ment intention of 95% among homeowners is reached. With 
specific combinations of mass and personal communication, 
this happens in less than 27 years. Both samples documented 
all homeowner’s reached status quo in the DM process. Fur-
thermore, the costs that are involved with mass and personal 
communication are recorded, as well as Sinus lifestyle data. 
Analysis shows that the first and the second sample do not 
differ significantly for these key variables. 
Figure 2 shows the impact of mass and personal commu-
nication on refurbishment intention at an overall system level 
after 27 years (sample I). One important finding is that mass 
communication alone does not convince homeowners to re-
furbish. This modeling result is in line with the previously 
described phenomenon that governments mainly used mass 
communication in the past and could hardly change the hesi-
tant refurbishment behavior of German homeowners. The 
portion of homeowners with a refurbishment intention in-
creases from 14.3% (see Table I) to 18.6% after 27 years of 
mass communication. This result can be interpreted as a in-
dicator that governments have been working cost inefficient-
ly by investing solely in mass communication campaigns. 
The costs for mass and personal communications are il-
lustrated in Figure 3. These are accumulated economic costs 
after a fixed period of 27 years of mass and personal com-
munication exposure.  Later in this paper, specific mixes of  
 
Figure 2.  Mass and personal communication and refurbishment intention 
mass and personal communication will be identified that 
enable an acceleration of the creation of refurbishment inten-
tion and less time than the fixed period of 27 years will be 
necessary, resulting in lower economic costs. 
Figure 3 shows that personal communication is the main 
driver of total costs. And it is important to acknowledge that 
these accumulated costs represent the economic costs and are 
not necessarily paid by one and the same party. This makes 
them abstract and somehow intangible. While governments 
might invest in mass communication campaigns, households 
might invest in energy consultancy. Nevertheless, an optimal 
point should be identified, where all (or most) homeowners 
decide to refurbish at least costs. This point can be identified 
at MC = 5 and PC = 1. At this point, the model shows that 
after 27 years, 99.2% of German homeowners developed a 
refurbishment intention at economic costs of € 301.01 mi. 
In a next step, this paper investigates the velocity of de-
veloping a refurbishment intention of 95% among home-
owners, with the help of sample II. This seems a highly rele-
vant information, as it could reveal levels of mass and per-
sonal communication that convince homeowners to refurbish 
more rapidly. In this way the model can determine the addi-
tional costs for more rapid refurbishment paths. The cost in 
Figure 3 should now be adjusted as well, as with specific 
mixes of mass and personal communication, less than 27 
years are necessary to reach a 95% refurbishment intention. 
Figure 5 shows these adjusted total accumulated costs. 
The optimal point can be identified for Figure 4 and 5 as 
well: still at MC = 5 and PC = 1 a 99.2% refurbish intention 
among Germany’s homeowners until the year 2050 is 
reached (and a 95% refurbish intention is reached slightly 
earlier in the year 2048). The economic costs would yield up 
to € 301.01 mi. (at 99.2% in the year 2050) or € 278.7 mi. (at 
least at 95% refurbishment intention in the year 2048). Faster 
pathways however are now becoming visible and are listed 
in Table 2, as well as the additional costs for this accelera-
tion. The additional costs are calculated by comparing the 
specific scenario with the optimal point MC = 5 and PC = 1. 
The table is sorted by the column duration in years and 
shows the levels of mass and personal communication (MC 
and PC) that reach a 95% refurbishment intention.

Figure 3.  Total costs of communication after 27 years 
As an example, the duration of developing a refurbish-
ment intention of 95% among German homeowners can be 
reduced by 10 years by looking at the MC = 5 and PC = 2. 
With these levels of mass and personal communication, the 
system reaches a 95% refurbishment intention after 15 years 
with additional costs of € 38.6 mi. Practically, this means 
additional investments of 89% per year (€ 278.7 mi. over 
27 years compared to € 317.3 mi. over 15 years), or 14% 
over the whole period. Another example is the point MC = 3 
and PC = 2 at which a 95% refurbishment intention is 
reached after 17 years (instead of 25 years) with additional 
costs of € 73.1 mi. Practically, this means additional invest-
ments of 86% per year (€ 278.7 mi. in 25 years compared to 
€ 351.8 mi. in 17 years), or 26% over the whole period. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The ABM for refurbishment and the results in this paper 
investigate the research question whether there are optimal 
(cost efficient and concerning speed) mixes of marketing and 
sales measures that help homeowners to create a positive 
refurbishment intention. To answer this research question 
model based, an ABM model for refurbishment is developed 
that utilizes (for German homeowners) representative data 
concerning their DM process for energetic refurbishment. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Time duration of reaching a 95% refurbishment intention 
 
Figure 5.  Total costs of communication at 95% refurbishment intention 
This paper describes different samples that were created 
for the two different sub questions. The ABM for refurbish-
ment shows that advanced levels of Mass Communication 
(MC = 5) and small to moderate levels (PC = 1) of Personal 
Communication can lead to a refurbishment intention satura-
tion among German homeowners in a cost-efficient way. 
This result suggests that past initiatives from governments to 
create refurbishment intention through mass communication 
only were inefficient. This paper explores as well additional 
costs for an acceleration of the development of refurbishment 
intention under the influence of mass and personal commu-
nication. Even if the economic costs estimated in this paper 
seem somehow abstract and intangible, the model shows that 
specific levels of mass and personal communication can sig-
nificantly accelerate the creation of refurbishment intention 
in the population at accumulated costs that do not seem un-
feasible. The explorations in this paper show that there is a 
potential to speed up the energy transition in buildings.

This paper does without an explicit sensitivity analysis 
for the ABM for refurbishment, as the explorations discussed 
in this paper represent a kind of sensitivity analysis for refur-
bishment intention among homeowners by itself. This paper 
presents different figures (e.g., Figure 2 and 4), which assess 
the sensitivity of refurbishment intention (in terms of the 
portion of homeowners with refurbishment intention, and in 
terms of the time to develop this refurbishment intention) as 
a result of different mass and personal communication levels. 
Although this work develops a segmented approach to 
simulating German homeowners’ DM for energetic refur-
bishment, it assesses the costs for touchpoints for these 
homeowners in a lump-sum kind of way at the end of Sec-
tion III. Future work could address this issue and do an at-
tempt to develop a segmented and more realistic cost calcu-
lation approach for the different Sinus Lifestyles. 
Another issue lies in the simulation of specific (but static) 
mixes of mass and personal communication over a longer 
period. It is common marketing practice to vary campaigns 
over time, which is not incorporated in the ABM for refur-
bishment. Future versions should dynamize the levels of 
mass and personal communication over time (within the 
simulation time of 27 years, e.g., reducing mass communica-
tion from MC = 5 to MC = 1 and increasing personal com-
munication from PC = 0 to PC = 1 over time). 
The same holds for the static approach concerning the 
capacities of energy consultants. Section III discusses a max-
imum of 3 mi. personal communication touchpoints per peri-
od, in the years to come. Most likely, capacity will increase 
in case of change of momentum in the refurbishment market 
and this should be considered in the model.
