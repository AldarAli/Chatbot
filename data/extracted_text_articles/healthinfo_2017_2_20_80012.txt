Abstract—A new method of similarity/dissimilarity analysis of
Deoxyribonucleic acid/Ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) sequences,
is brieﬂy outlined. The sequences are represented as a set of
material points in a 3D-space. Such a 3D-dynamic graph is
characterized numerically by the values analogous to the ones
used in the classical dynamics. Application of such an approach
for a characterization of the Zika virus genome is also discussed.
Keywords–Bioinformatics; Alignment-free methods; Descrip-
tors.

INTRODUCTION
A fast development of databases stimulated designing of
new mathematical methods aiming at similarity/dissimilarity
analysis of biosequences (DNA, RNA, protein). One branch of
the methods, Graphical Representations, was created already
in the eighties [1]. Originally, only a visual inspection on
the considered objects was the aim of these studies. The
DNA/RNA sequences are long and are composed of four
letters. Therefore, in a natural way they can be represented as
complicated objects in a 4-dimensional space. Since the human
perception is limited, the reduction of the space to a lower
dimension became desirable. This resulted in developing many
different Graphical Representation methods [2][3][4][5][6]
(for reviews see [7][8]). Alternatively, one can also characterize
the sequences numerically, using so called descriptors [9].
Assigning descriptors to the graphs is far from being trivial.
In Section 2 we brieﬂy outline a Graphical Representation
method introduced by us several years ago and its application
to a characterization of the Zika virus genome.
II.
METHOD AND EXPECTED RESULTS
Recently, we have introduced a new Graphical Repre-
sentation method called by us 3D-dynamic Representation
of DNA/RNA Sequences [10][11]. The inspiration for the
numerical description of the 3D-dynamic-graphs came from
the classical dynamics. We treat the graphs as rigid bodies.
As descriptors characterizing the 3D-dynamic graphs we took
coordinates of the centers of mass and the moments of inertia
of these bodies. Two examples of the 3D-dynamic graphs
are shown in Figure 1. The shapes and the locations of the
graphs in the 3-dimensional space of different sequences are
different. The aim of the new studies is an application of
this approach to a new mathematical description of the Zika
virus genome. Preliminary results are presented in Figures 2-
5. Figure 2 and 3 show 3D-dynamic graphs representing the
complete genome sequences of Zika virus. As we can see, the
time evolution of the complete genome sequence of Zika virus
is well represented graphically.

Figure 3. 3D-dynamic graphs representing the genomes of the Zika virus.
A pair of graphs is similar to each other: French Polynesia
2013 and Brazil 2015 (Fig. 2) and different: Senegal 2001
and Brazil 2015 (Fig. 3). This observation is conﬁrmed by the
calculations of the descriptors presented in the axes of Figures
4 and 5. µx, µy, µz are the coordinates of the centers of mass
of the 3D-dynamic graph, in the {X, Y, Z} coordinate system.
They are are deﬁned as
µx =

where xi, yi, zi are the coordinates of the mass mi. As the
descriptors we also select the square roots of the normalized
principal moments of inertia:

where I1, I2, I3 are the principal moments of inertia of the
3D-dynamic graph and N is the length of the sequence.
In the Figures we observe concentrations of points in
particular parts of the diagrams. We have already applied
the 2D-dynamic representation of DNA/RNA sequences for
a characterization of this virus [12]. In the future work, we
are going to check if the third dimension supplies any new
and relevant information.
