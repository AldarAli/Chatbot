Abstract—The power consumption rate and bandwidth gain 
are the two major design criterions considered in the sensor 
networks, since the sensor nodes in the network are usually 
with limited capabilities in terms of processing power and 
bandwidth availability. These two criterions are usually 
contradictory to each other. However, the efficiencies of power 
consumption 
rate 
and 
bandwidth 
gain 
are 
achieved 
simultaneously in the image processing on sensor network 
proposed in this paper. This is made possible by a technique 
innovation: image processing in the compressed form. It is 
noted that in the conventional approach the compressed image 
must be decompressed first to be processed. This innovation 
makes the compression and processing a joint design not two 
separate processes as before.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Signal processing and data compression should be 
considered together as a whole to make totally efficient. 
More specifically, we propose in this paper to have signal 
processing and data compression suitable for being aware, 
reasoning and thus convenient for the sensor network [1-2] 
to make a decision. We accomplish this purpose by making 
data compressed and signal processed both functionally, i.e., 
being able to be accessed and processed to a specific interest.  
More clearly, the data is compressed in the hierarchical data 
structure processed by morphological image processing. 
Most importantly, we implement our morphological image 
processing on the hierarchical data structure [3-4] instead of 
on the pixel matrix. Therefore, the signal processing and 
compression are joined together. To our knowledge, this 
joint processing concept is newly proposed. 
The morphology processing has long been applied 
successfully to industry auto-inspection and medical image 
processing [5-6]. There are many efforts on hardware 
implementation to facilitate the morphological processing 
[7-10]. Neural network consideration was also investigated 
in [11]. Morphological processing has recently been applied 
to video coding in sensor network by shape compensation 
[12], and cognitive sensing [13-14]. The quad tree data 
structure has been well applied to the field of computer 
vision such as image segmentation and compression [15-16]. 
The quad tree with its hierarchical data structure is 
computationally efficient. The quad tree is based on the 
principle of recursive decompositions of space. The 
technique of recursive call has been further developed to 
extend to the imbedded system [17-18] applications. 
The conventional morphological image processing is 
processed by a pixel vs. pixel basis with the pictures stored 
in the matrix form. In contrast, the proposed morphological 
processing in the quad tree data structure can be processed 
by a block vs. block basis. The pyramid approach can be 
also classified as fast block basis processing but without the 
compression consideration due to the pyramid layer of every 
resolution in matrix form. The proposed approach is novel 
to achieve fast morphological processing jointly with image 
compression.   
The power consumption rate and bandwidth gain are the 
two major design criterions considered in the sensor 
networks, since the sensor nodes in the network are usually 
with limited capabilities in terms of processing power and 
bandwidth availability. These two criterions are usually 
contradictory to each other. However, the efficiencies of 
power consumption rate and bandwidth gain are achieved 
simultaneously in the image processing on sensor network 
proposed in this paper. This is made possible by a technique 
innovation: image processing in the compressed form. It is 
noted that in the conventional approach the compressed 
image must be decompressed first to be processed. This 
innovation makes the compression and processing a joint 
design not two separate processes as before.

IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPTS WITH WORKING 
EXAMPLE 
It is noted that by the quadtree decomposition, any binary 
image can be decomposed into black and white square 
blocks with some fixed size of power of 2. Thus, dilation of 
the whole image can be accomplished by dilating individual 
decomposed square blocks. White square blocks do not need 
dilation, black square blocks take a simple dilation by the 
tree pattern copy operations. The tree patterns are the 
dilation results of black square blocks and can be computed 
as patterns in advance for preparation. It is common for very 
many dilated block to share the same tree patterns. 
Therefore, the implementation concepts can be summarized 
as two strategies: block vs. block processing using pattern 
method and efficient transformation from sequential access 
string format to direct access pointer format. A working 
example is illustrated in Fig. 1.

EXPERIMENTS ON SENSING APPLICATION 
For sensing need, the workout example is a continuation 
to our research on low bit-rate video coding for sensor 
network. This continuation extends video coding to target 
tracking. The goal of this working example is to find object 
“boat”, which is also set for the performance comparison. 
The boat obtained from the best resolution is regarded as the 
benchmark as in Fig. 2. The boats obtained from the lower 
resolutions appear image quality degradation as shown in 
Fig. 3. Accordingly, the quality degradation can be 
interpreted as “distortion”, which is further numerically 
defined as the error count from the error image referenced to 
the benchmark for every resolution. The error images are 
shown in Fig. 4.

As a summary of our experiments, three procedures are 
applied in our signal processings: (I) binarized quantization, 
(II) down sampling in resolution (III) shape compensation 
by morphological  operations. It is noted that the error 
results are compared for different resolutions in procedures 
II and III. 
 
 
IV.  RATE–DISTORTION PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
 
Rate–distortion theory is a major branch of information 
theory about source coding, which provides the theoretical 
foundations for lossy data compression; it addresses the 
problem of determining the smallest compression rate R to 
encode the source signal without exceeding a given 
distortion D when reconstructed by the coded data bits. The 
compression rate corresponds to the cost of data bits and the 
distortion represents the performance. To apply the rate-
distortion theory to our work, we first define the distortion 
as the error counts from the error images referenced to the 
target image computed by the best resolution. Secondly, we 
interpret the rate as the power consumption rate instead of 
the original data rates.

for two methods: the logarithm in the processing (horizontal) axis is also 
required because of too large deviation for the two processing power spent 
in the respective methods. 
 
 
Fig. 6. The rate-distortion performance comparison in communication 
bandwidth for two methods. 
 
The transmission bandwidth in our analysis is roughly 
computed by the data bits of the testing image because the 
bandwidth cost is proportional to the data bits transmitted in 
transmission. It is straightforward to count the data bits for 
the direct method, in which the picture is stored in the 
matrix form. In contrast, the data bits for the proposed 
method are computed from the node information in Table I. 
It is noted that the rate-distortion analysis for bandwidth can 
also be interpreted as the analysis for consumption rate for 
transmission power since the transmission power is usually 
proportional to the data rates. The processing power is 
approximated by the processing time, which is simply 
measured in average of 100 times and listed in Table II. As 
a summary, we can associate the processing time and data 
bits with the concepts of power cost and bandwidth cost 
respectively and have the corresponding two cost-distortion 
(rate-distortion) functions represented in Fig. 5 and 6.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, three strategies are proposed to improve 
the bit processing rate. First, utilizing the sensor’s special 
feature, which emphasizes on decision not for visual 
aesthetics or entertainment purpose. Second, exploiting an 
appropriate functional image processing such as the 
morphological image processing, which provides the feature 
only (not the detail) for decision. Third, developing an 
image processing in the compressed form such as in the 
quadtree data structure, which is advantageous in the low 
resolution. Strategy 3 requires a technique innovation, 
image processing in the compressed form. It is noted that in 
the conventional approach the compressed image must be 
decompressed first to be processed. This innovation makes 
the compression and processing a joint design not two 
separate processes as before.  
Morphological processing is suitable for fast module 
applications in sensor network because it is built upon 
simple logic operations with many extended functional

interpretations such as erosion, dilation, thinning, and 
pruning. The processing efficiency can be further improved 
by being implemented in hierarchical data structure. With its 
hierarchical data structure, the morphological processing 
can be applied to be focus on any specific blocks. The 
conventional direct method for morphological image 
processing is processed by a pixel vs. pixel basis with the 
pictures stored in the array form. In contrast, the 
morphological processing with a hierarchical data structure 
can be processed by a block vs. block basis. This joint 
processing concept is first time proposed in this paper. The 
processing efficiency is also verified in our experiments. 
The rate-distortion theory is applied to our bandwidth 
gain analysis by defining the distortion as the error counts 
from the error images referenced to the target image 
computed by the best resolution. Meantime, the rate-
distortion theory is further modified by us to study the 
power consumption rate if the rate is simply interpreted as 
the power consumption rate instead of the original bit rates. 
As a summary, it is the efficiencies in both the compression 
and the speed performance to make the proposed method 
outperform the direct method significantly in the rate-
distortion analysis.
