Abstract—A clinical trial of telehealth services was carried out 
along the Eastern seaboard of Australia from Townsville in the 
North to Launceston in Tasmania over a period of 18 months 
from mid-2013 to end-2014. Patients were selected based on 
their history of hospitalization for their chronic conditions. A 
Test group of 114 patients was supplied with at home 
telemonitoring equipment and 173 patients were enrolled as a 
matched control group who were subjected to normal care. 
The impact of telemonitoring over one year following the start 
of telemonitoring, was analyzed using linear regression and 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Mortality was reduced by 
>40%, the rate of hospitalization was reduced by 53% and 
length of stay was reduced by 7.5 days. The rate of expenditure 
on medical services was reduced by 46.3% and that for 
Pharmaceutical expenditure by 25.5%. There were significant 
differences in results for patients with Heart Failure, those 
with Lung Disease and those with Diabetes. The effective 
introduction of telemonitoring was dependent on local factors 
such as workplace culture and capacity for organizational 
change management.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In industrialized nations, approximately 70-78% of 
healthcare budgets are spent on the management of chronic 
disease or its exacerbation. As the population ages the 
burden of chronic disease will increase and place healthcare 
budgets under increasing strain. Telehealth services have 
been demonstrated as an effective innovation in international 
contexts, but there are low levels of evidence from 
Australian studies. 
This study analyzed whether the introduction of at-home 
telemonitoring services for the management of chronic 
disease in the community reduces patient use of the health 
system and improves mortality, healthcare outcomes and 
patient quality of life. We also explored the issues and 
challenges in deploying telemonitoring services in the 
community. 
This trial was designed to create a robust evidence base 
for these key success factors and to demonstrate an effective 
and scalable model for Internet-enabled telehealth services in 
Australia. Armed with the insights provided by this evidence 
base, policy makers may have much of the data they require 
to implement funding models and create a sustainable 
Telehealth services sector in Australia. 
II. 
AIMS 
The project bbjectives were to demonstrate and document 
how telehealth services can be successfully deployed across 
Australia, by piloting services in five different settings across 
five states, with a range of health service providers, 
including Local Health Districts, Medicare Locals and not 
for profit community organisations. This was carried out by 
deploying and demonstrating the operation of Telehealth 
monitoring in a multi-site multi-state case matched control 
trial (Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design) of 
chronically ill patients living in their own homes in the 
community. This has never previously been attempted in 
Australia. Specific aims included; 
• 
Provide evidence that at home telemonitoring has the 
potential to reduce unscheduled admissions to hospital 
compared to the control group.  
• 
Provide evidence for an impact on hospital admissions, 
mortality, 
clinical 
events 
and 
symptoms 
and 
improvements in functional measures and patients' and 
carers’ experiences with care. 
• 
Evaluate health economic benefits 
• 
Evaluate impact on clinical work force availability and 
deployment 
• 
Evaluate impact of human factors (acceptability, 
usability 
by 
patients, 
carers, 
nurses, 
General 
Practitioners (GPs) and administrators) 
• 
Evaluate impact of workplace culture and capacity for 
organizational change management. 
• 
Derive clinical and health economic evidence on how 
Telehealth services can be scaled up nationally to 
provide an alternative cost effective health service for 
the management of chronic disease in the community. 
III. 
METHODS 
The clinical trial design has been previously reported in 
the literature [1] and will only briefly be summarized here.  
The trial was carried out at five different sites 
representing two different models for the management of 
chronic disease in the community, one Hospital based and 
the other Community based. This allowed the analysis of site 
specific differences in workplace culture, organizational 
change management and staff and management capabilities,

that contribute to differences in measured health, social and 
economic outcomes. 
The trial design required 25 test patients and 50 case 
matched control patients at six sites in five states and 
Territories. Test patients were supplied with state of the art 
Telehealth technology in the home for the monitoring of vital 
signs, delivery of clinical questionnaires and messaging 
between patients and carers.  Test and Control patients were 
closely matched using a range of clinical, demographic and 
socio-economic criteria. Before and after data was available 
from national data bases on medical expenses (MBS data) 
and pharmaceutical expenses (PBS Data), as well as 
hospitals admissions and length of stay (LOS) from National 
Hospital RoundTable data.  
A preliminary graphical analysis of both PBS and MBS 
data, using the MATLAB function normplot as well as the 
Chi-square goodness of fit test indicated that the data were 
not normal. Both lognormal and sqrt transformations were 
found to be effective in normalizing the data. The sqrt 
transformation was chosen as a little better, and applied to 
data before linear regression analysis was carried out.  
MBS data were summed over 30-day intervals back 
approximately three years (36x30-day intervals) from the 
start of intervention and forward by almost one year (12x30- 
day intervals). When a Test patient had two controls, the data 
for both controls were averaged.  
Ignoring missing points, data were then averaged and the 
95% confidence limits calculated across all rows for each 
time interval. Before and after data were generally varying 
over time, and were analyzed using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) a general linear model, which blends ANOVA 
and linear regression. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
Two sites in the Nepean Blue Mountains Area were 
ultimately merged into a single site for logistical reasons. 
Following dropouts, withdrawal of consent and patients 
rejected because of poor or missing data, 100 Test patients 
and 114 Control patients were analyzed in detail. Out of 
these, 67 were males and 33 were females. 
The average age of patients was 71.9±9.4 years. There 
was no significant difference in age between males and 
females or Test and Control patients. Test patients were 
monitored for an average of 276 days with 75% monitored 
for more than 6 months.  
TABLE 1: LINEAR REGRESSION AND ANCOVA ANALYSIS OF 
 
   SQRT(MBS) DATA 
In the period of 100 days, prior to the onset of 
telemonitoring, there were only minor differences in the 
number of GP visits (P=0.04) and no significant differences 
in number of visits to specialists, number and cost of 
medications prescribed or number and cost of laboratory 
tests carried out.  
ANCOVA analysis was carried out on Test and Control 
patient data and control-test differences. A matrix of results 
with slopes, intercepts and P values is shown in Table 1 for 
all Test patients. Graphical data of sqrt(MBS Costs)  against 
time is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. sqrt(MBS Costs) plotted for Test patients before and after 
intervention with 95% Prediction Intervals shown as red dotted lines 
Similar analysis was carried out for PBS data as well as 
for different patient cohorts and different disease conditions. 
MBS data showed a 46.3% reduction in the rate of 
expenditure after one year and a 23.5% saving of $611. PBS 
savings were more modest with rates of expenditure falling 
by 25.5% and savings of 11.5% or $354 over one year.  
Detailed hospital data was available for 53 Test patients 
and 64 Control patients. A similar ANCOVA analysis 
carried out on data averaged over 100 day intervals, revealed 
a 53.2% reduction in the rate of admission and a saving of 
approximately 23.8% or 0.67 admissions over the year 
following the intervention. Rates of LOS were reduced by 
almost 68% resulting in a 33.8% saving over the year of 7.5 
days. Mortality for Test patients over the trial period was 
reduced by >40% relative to their Controls. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Results of the CSIRO National Telehealth Trial have 
been briefly summarized. Telemonitoring of patients with a 
range of chronic conditions has been shown to reduce 
expenditure on medical services and pharmaceutical items as 
well as significantly reduce the rate of hospitalization and 
length of stay. Mortality was also significantly reduced. 
Patients found the telemonitoring equipment easy to use and 
compliance 
rates 
>50% 
were 
achieved 
for 
daily 
measurement of vital signs. There were significant 
differences observed between different patient cohorts and 
different chronic conditions.
