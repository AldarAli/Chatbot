Abstract—This paper presents a fault detection and isolation 
(FDI) model for an industrial Linear Friction Welding (LFW) 
production machine in Rolls-Royce. The LFW machine is a 
complex 11 actuator machine which has 6 degrees of freedom. 
The inplane axis is the most complex axis due to the high 
power and high dynamic response requirements, necessitating 
the use of two four-stage servo valves. We adapted a previously 
proposed model with fault diagnosis techniques to enable fault 
detection and isolation for the LFW inplane welding axis. This 
paper will demonstrate the models ability to detect and isolate 
faults during production, allowing immediate detection - 
enabling operators or maintenance to utilize the information to 
effectively get the LFW machine back into production. 
Keywords-modelling; fault detection; fault isolation. 
 
I. 
LFW INTRODUCTION 
Linear Friction Welding (LFW) [1] has been a key 
technology in recent years for aircraft engine manufacture in 
both commercial and military market sectors. For joining 
Blades to Discs (Blisks) [1], LFW is the ideal process for 
the following reasons: 
 
LFW is a solid state process which gives 
reproducibility, and high quality bonds therefore 
improving performance 
 
More cost effective than machining Blisks from 
solid billets  
 
Blisks enable up to 30% weight saving over 
conventional rotors 
 
LFW enables hollow bladed Blisks 
 
Dissimilar materials can be joined for optimised 
blade and disc properties 
 
The process can be divided into six phases: contact - 
initial advancement of actuators seating the blade onto the 
disc stub and applying a seating force, ramp up - blade 
oscillations start to occur, conditioning – maintaining the 
oscillations to enable frictional heat to build up, burn-off – 
material deforming plastically under compression, ramp 
down – blade decelerated to a static position, and forging – 
allowing the weld to complete under a constant pressure.  
 
Fig. 1 outlines the process phases: 
 
 
Figure 1 - LFW Process phases 
 
Rolls-Royce’s LF60 is a linear friction welding system 
that is designed to weld Blisks in a production environment. 
The system uses a combination of high performance, high 
accuracy servo-hydraulics to produce oscillatory motion 
between the components which creates frictional heating, 
and a forging force sufficient to produce a high strength and 
geometrically precise bond. 
Faults occurring on the LF60 can lead to system 
downtime and the scrapping of components [2], both of 
which could lead to a monetary loss for the business. In 
order to reduce the likelihood of these issues a novel method 
of redundancy has been placed on the machine, with no 
additional sensors or hardware needing to be installed. 
Analytical redundancy in detecting faults has then been 
applied to the system. 
 
Section 2 introduces the LFW machine and gives an 
overview of the modelled system. Section 3 reviews residual 
generation methods applicable to this work and section 4 
outlines the chosen residual generation and evaluation 
methods for the FDI system. Section 5 evaluates the FDI 
model using two actual production fault cases. Section 6 
concludes this paper.

FAULT DETECTION INTRODUCTION 
Over the years different computer based diagnosis 
techniques have been tried and tested in a number of 
different domains. For the simpler and well understood 
systems, techniques such as decision trees, fault directories, 
and probability theory have been successfully applied [3, 4]. 
When applying these techniques with more complex 
systems, the accuracy of results reduces resulting in 
incomplete and inconsistent diagnosis. This is due to the 
fact that a high number of interactions could exist, therefore 
more complex techniques have been developed and used. 
More complex techniques such as artificial intelligence have 
been used in the fault diagnosis area, but limitations such as 
incompleteness 
and 
inconsistencies 
in 
knowledge, 
knowledge extraction, and the dependency of the extracted 
knowledge exists [5]. To reduce these limitations fault 
diagnosis by the use of model-based techniques was 
approached, this involves capturing knowledge about the 
structure and behavior of the system, and the key system 
interactions. Simulating the knowledge alongside the system 
can then be used to predict the system behaviour, and 
identify when a fault could occur or diagnose it. This is 
done by the model generating the systems nominal 
behaviour, and any deviations identified. 
 
Model-based fault detection and diagnosis/isolation 
(FDI) techniques have been researched widely in the 
literature, examples being [6-10]. This involves creating a 
residual signal by comparing the systems actual output 
signal and the estimated one from a nominal system model, 
once created this residual signal can be used as the indicator 
of abnormal system behavior. An example of residual 
indication can be seen in Fig. 2. As the error occurs in Fig. 2 
the residual in a) appears out of its threshold, in b) there is a 
frequency change but the majority of the residual stays 
within the threshold. There is a threshold present due to 
system modeling uncertainties and noise. Fig. 2 identifies 
that faults can be detected but not simply by residuals 
appearing out of tolerance.

FDI focuses on the use of fundamental knowledge to 
achieve efficient and effective diagnosis. Models of the 
correctly functioning system which can generate the 
expected system behavior are used to express the 
fundamental knowledge. Comparing the systems behavior 
with the models behavior can give the ability to derive 
possible faults, but the fault detection accuracy depends 
greatly on the existence of a good system model [11].  
Other FDI techniques exist such as knowledge based 
methods [12] which don’t involve an analytical model but 
are data-driven and knowledge based techniques able to 
estimate the system dynamics. Signal processing techniques 
in the time-frequency domain can also be applied to detect 
faults. Some examples of these are spectrogram and 
scalogram [13], and wavelet decomposition [14]. 
 
A fault can be defined as a departure from an acceptable 
range of an observed variable or a calculated parameter 
associated with a process [15]. The underlying cause of this 
abnormality is called the root cause. With increased systems 
complexity it is becoming difficult for human operators to 
continuously diagnose systems, manage system degradation, 
parameter drift, and component failures. This difficulty is 
compounded by production pressures, the amount of system 
variables, and incomplete or unreliable data. FDI deals with 
timely detection, and diagnosis of abnormal system 
behaviour. Once detected the human operator is able to take 
action accordingly. 
 
A model of the LF60 Inplane actuation system has been 
developed in [16], fault detection methods have been placed 
onto the model to enable detection and isolation for faults 
which have previously occurred on the system. 
 
III. 
THE LF60 LINEAR FRICTION WELDING MACHINE 
Each machine axis on the LF60 is independently 
controlled using a combination of PID and Amplitude and 
Phase control (APC). The six main degrees of freedom are 
referred to as inplane, forge, hade, roll, pitch and yaw. The 
inplane actuator, which is driven by two four stage valves, 
oscillates the blade tangentially to the disk. Forging pressure 
is obtained by a combination of four PID controlled 
hydrostatic actuators. The six hade actuators restrain the 
unwanted movement in the other degrees of freedom [17]. 
 
A CAD picture of the LF60 inner cage showing the actuator 
attachments can be seen in Fig. 3.

Figure 3 - Picture of the inner cage with actuators attached 
 
The inplane actuation system provides the oscillating 
motion. This is the most complex system on the machine 
and therefore the one where the majority of faults occur [2]. 
It is driven by two 4 stage servo valves. Each one has a pilot 
two stagevalve rated at 6.31x10-5m3/s; this drives the 3rd 
stage 2.52x10-3 m3/s spool which in turn drives the 4th stage 
2.52x10-2 m3/s spool.  
 
Fig. 4 shows a front view of the inplane servo valves. 
 
 
 
Figure 4 - LF60 4 stage inplane Valves arrangement: front 
view 
 
The 4 stage servo valve works by the initial first stage 
torque motor controlling flow via a nozzle-flapper 
arrangement. The 2nd stage has a mechanically feedback 
spool linked to the first stage by the feedback spring. The 3rd 
stage spool, with electronic position feedback, acts as a flow 
amplifier to the 4th stage, which also has electronic closed-
loop control of the spool position. The modelled system in 
[16] models important factors as outlined in [18] which 
include fluid compressibility, variable cylinder oil volumes, 
internal cylinder leakage, cylinder cross-port bleed, valve 
orifice pressure-flow characteristic, valve overlap, valve 
body pressure drop, manifold pressure drop and oil volume, 
valve spool dynamics, maximum valve opening, valve spool 
slew rate limit, friction, and geometric properties.

A number of fault detection approaches exist in the 
literature. A classification of these different approaches can 
be seen in Fig. 5.

Figure 5 - Classification of the diagnostic system [19] 
 
Quantitative based diagnosis methods involve creating 
analytical redundancy with the use of physical models to 
generate residuals that can be used for isolating process 
failures. These can be detailed or simplified physical 
models.  
Qualitative based diagnosis methods can be rule based, or 
qualitative physics based. Rules based systems involve 
systems derived from expert knowledge, first principles, or 
limits checks.  
Process history based diagnosis methods are used when a 
priori knowledge of the process is not known therefore 
input-output (black box) relationships are developed using 
statistical, neural network, or similar pattern recognition 
techniques. Grey box methods use process data to determine 
model parameters by using mathematical terms.  
Given the availability of a system model (developed and 
validated in [16]) the diagnosis system used will be 
qualitative based, detailed physical modeling. A number of 
model-based fault diagnosis methods can be found in the 
literature [7, 8, 19]. The main two are parity equation 
methods and observer based approaches which are discussed 
in the following subsections. 
 
A. Parity Equation Methods 
 
The Parity Equation Method involves providing a proper 
check of the parity (consistency) of the measurements for 
the monitored system first proposed by [20]. Mathematical 
models describing the relationships between system 
variables are used to describe the input-output or space-state 
characteristics of the system, the rearrangement of these 
gives the parity equations [19]. Output of the parity equation 
in theory should be zero mean, but in reality due to model 
inaccuracies, measurement and process noise the output will 
be nonzero. Parity methods are similar to observer methods

but usually designed more intuitively. Fig. 6 shows two 
methods for parity generation, an output error method and 
the equation error method.

B. Observer approaches 
 
Reconstructing 
the 
outputs 
of 
a 
system 
from 
measurements using the estimation error with observers or 
Kalman filters is another commonly used approach for fault 
diagnosis [22]. With the observer approach the estimation 
error can be considered as the residual, in order to detect 
and isolate faults. For stochastic systems, the Kalman 
filtering technique can be used, which enables noise to be 
factored into the approach [23]. State estimation is improved 
with the use of Kalman filters due to the processing of all 
available measurements regardless of precision to estimate 
the current variable of interest. 
For example, take the system state and measurement 
equations (1) and (2) respectively: 
 
 ̇                                        (1) 
 
                                     (2) 
 
  is the system input, the process noise is represented by  , 
and the measurement white noise is represented by   with 
  (   )   , and   (   )   . The state and estimation 
noise is uncorrelated i.e.   (   )   . The Kalman filter 
equation can provide the optimal estimate of   termed  ̂: 
 
 ̂    ̂      (    ̂    )                 (3) 
 
 ̂    ̂                                       (4) 
The weightings for   and   are chosen by trading off fault 
sensitivity to the likelihood of false alarms using 
engineering experience. Fig. 7 shows the Kalman estimator, 
which uses the known inputs   and the measurement   to 
generate the output and state estimates  ̂      ̂ . Riccati 
equations are solved to find the Kalman filter gain  .

C. Residual Generation Summary 
 
Each of the discussed approaches involves the creation 
of a residual (or series of residuals) which need to be 
analyzed further to provide indication and isolation of faults. 
Residual evaluation can be done using a constant threshold 
or an adaptive threshold, constant threshold residual 
evaluation has a number of disadvantages. Due to the 
inclusion of noise, or uncertainties in models false alarms 
can be triggered. Therefore, adaptive thresholds which take 
into account any modeled inaccuracies or noise can enable 
better fault detection, and the reduction of false alarms. 
Given the availability of a validated model, the preferred 
method of residual generation is the parity method, utilizing 
the model to compare outputs of the actual system to form 
residual signals. 
V. 
RESIDUAL EVALUATION 
The fault diagnostic method used in this paper will be of 
the qualitative based type with detailed physical modelling 
of the system used to check the consistency of the actual 
system. The inplane system model developed in [16] will 
act as an intuitively designed observer providing analytical 
redundancy. Residual generation will be done by comparing 
the measured values of the system outputs   , with the 
corresponding analytically computed values  ̌ :

Figure 8–Fault diagnosis flow diagram 
 
Once a residual has been generated, the residual would 
need to be evaluated to see if a fault is present or not. 
Various forms of residual evaluation exist in the literature, 
some of which include residual threshold setting based on 
the minimal detectable failure [24], posterior probabilities to 
process information in order to detect faulty circuits [25], 
the use of fuzzy logic enabling the incorporation of human 
operator knowledge to interoperate the residuals [26], and 
probabilistic methods based on likelihood ratios [27]. The 
residual limits in this research will be created by using 
previous fault free data executed through the model and 
used to capture the maximum residual limits for fault free 
conditions, therefore creating adaptive residual limits 
defined from previous fault free data, similar as in [28]. Due 
to the different components welded on the LF60 the residual 
limits will be component specific, therefore a number of 
knowledge based data files will be stored which hold 
residual limits for each residual and component. In the 
presence of a fault the residual signal will appear high i.e. 
     at that time signal. 
 
The use of adaptive residual limits defined from 
previous fault free data will allow for any compared signals 
(model vs. new data) which deviate more than normal, 
outside 
of 
the 
modeling 
noise, 
disturbances, 
and 
inaccuracies to be picked up and therefore flagged by the 
model alerting to a fault, or a change in system 
performance. On the detection of a residual breach the 
system will decide on the type of fault, its cause, location, 
and possible solutions given a knowledge base of logical 
rules defined from previous fault occurrences. A flow 
diagram of the logical rules can be seen in Fig. 9. The 
logical rules would be triggered post residual evaluation of 
Fig. 8.

The following section implements the fault detection 
scheme and tests it against a number of fault cases.

FAULT DETECTION AND ISOLATION CASE STUDIES 
This section evaluates the FDI with two actual 
production fault cases. 
 
A. Fault case 1: Start-up instability 
 
The start-up instability shown in Fig. 10 was caused by a 
faulty relief valve [29], the machine alerted to this issue 
therefore production was immediately halted (due to Rolls-
Royce confidentiality the current machine detection 
methods cannot be shown).  The benefits of a fault detection 
model would not only be the ability to detect the fault, but 
also the isolation of the issue by the model informing the 
operators of its cause and possible solution.

Figure 10 - Start-up instability 
 
Simulating a non-faulty component of the same type 
through the FDI model yields the outputs shown in Fig. 11. 
The upper figure compares the actual (fault free) output with 
the models output, the 2nd figure shows the residual signal 
and adaptive limits. The 3rd figure indicates any trips of the 
adaptive residual limit by the residual, and the lower figure 
indicates detection of a fault on the signal. The fault 
detection signal only trips if the limit trip signal is triggered 
and remains triggered for a predefined persistence of 3ms, 
which is done to further reduce false fault detections. 
 
 
Figure 11 – Start-up Instability, Fault detection with the 
residual generation method (fault free) 
 
Fig. 12 shows the FDI model simulated with the start-up 
instability fault. The limit trip signal is tripped immediately 
and a number of times throughout the simulation – therefore 
the fault detection signal trips also and stays high from the 
start of the simulation. This simulation shows an effective 
capture of the fault using the FDI model. Using the logic 
previously defined in Fig. 9, the model outputs an indication 
to the user to “Check HSM” after detecting the presence of 
the fault occurrence on the relevant signals.  
 
 
 
Figure 12 – Start-up instability, Fault detection with the 
residual generation method (fault) 
 
B. Fault case 2: Force holding Instability 
 
The Inplane force holding instability of Fig. 13 was only 
captured during manual review of the data post Blisk 
completion. Therefore the immediate detection of this type 
of fault would be of great benefit to potentially saving the 
scrapping of the Blisk and rectify the issue immediately. On 
simulation of the fault through the FDI model, the model 
and residual limits are sensitive enough to capture the 
instability and therefore indicate the presence of a fault, as 
shown in Fig. 14.

FDI model simulated with fault free data: 
 
Figure 15 – Force hold Instability, Fault detection with the

Therefore this fault can be successfully detected and the 
operator/maintenance engineers notified immediately. A 
notification of “Valve instabilities” would be displayed post 
fault occurrence.  
 
Therefore the model demonstrates effective capture of 
this fault at the first instance of its occurrence, enabling 
quick detection and isolation of the fault – reducing the 
potential for scrapping a component. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
A fault detection system has been implemented on a 
model previously developed in [16]. Case studies of actual 
production faults have been examined with the FDI model 
proving the model’s ability in detecting abnormal system 
behaviour and using a series of logic steps to isolate the 
fault, its cause, and possible solutions.  
 
The FDI system will be placed alongside the LFW 
system in order to detect faults upon the occurrence thus 
providing timely detection and identification, saving the 
business valuable time and money. Implementing the FDI 
system will involve careful understanding and integration 
with the LFW system and its users. This will be 
accomplished by utilizing the latest soft systems research 
knowledge.
