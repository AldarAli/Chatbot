Abstract—Efficiency and performance of the heavily used 
electronic devices in the field are always open for debate. As 
the technology advances, efficiency and performance of the 
electronic devices increase. Digital communication systems are 
also getting their share of this development trend. Digital 
communication systems, such as Digital Private Mobile Radio, 
Digital Mobile Radio/MotoTRBO, Association of Public-Safety 
Communications Officials-International Project 25 and Icom-
Kenwood NEXEDGE use half rate Advanced Multi-Band 
Excitation (AMBE) 3600 bps vocoder to provide clean and 
intelligible voice communication service. Although this half 
rate vocoder incorporates Forward Error Correction (FEC) 
coding to 
protect voice frames, 
its 
error correction 
performance does not meet today’s standards. To improve the 
FEC performance of the vocoder, in this work, we assess the 
FEC portion of the vocoder and propose a better performing 
FEC scheme. The proposed 2/3 rate convolutional code with 
vocoder frame length reduction provides a 4.41 dB coding gain 
in the high signal-to-noise region compared to AMBE FEC 
while preserving audio quality. Since all works are conducted 
around the vocoder section, improvements can be easily 
implemented in existing digital communication systems and 
standards.

 INTRODUCTION 
From small sites to huge organizations, mobile 
communication systems have evolved from analog to digital 
in order to keep up with the fast pace of the modern world. 
Since digital radios provide better sound quality and 
extensive 
data 
services 
compared 
to 
their 
analog 
counterparts, they are commonly used in areas where people 
need wireless communication. There is a large number of 
digital radio systems, which are already available, such as 
Digital Private Mobile Radio (dPMR) [1], Digital Mobile 
Radio (DMR) [2]-[3], NXDN [4], APCO P25 [5], digital 
smart technologies for amateurs (D-Star) [6], etc. All digital 
radios incorporate at least one type of vocoder to provide 
voice services over digital communication channel. There is 
a vast number of speech coders currently available. 
Advanced Multi-Band Excitation Speech Codec (AMBE) 
[1]-[2] is one of them and it is used in many communication 
systems. AMBE half rate 3600 bps vocoder is used in the 
following digital radio systems: dPMR, DMR/MotoTRBO, 
APCO P25 and NXDN [1]-[6]. AMBE 3600 bps vocoder 
consists of 1150 bps Forward Error Correction (FEC) and 
2450 bps vocoder data.  
AMBE speech codec is a type of speech compression 
technique. It consists of encoder and decoder. It can encode 
samples of voice data to a compressed stream and can 
generate synthesized voice output bits from the compressed 
bit stream [7].  
In theory, digital radios outperform their analog 
counterparts in terms of voice quality. We do not always 
have ideal conditions and also we do not always have high 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value. Due to attenuation and 
distortions in the communication channel, the overall Bit 
Error Rate (BER) performance of the digital radio degrades 
hence lowers the voice quality. Even though every 49 data 
bits of vocoder are accompanied by 23 FEC bits, the AMBE 
vocoder FEC cannot perform well. For this reason, limited 
communication range and bad audio quality can happen in 
noisy environments. To enhance the voice quality without 
modifying digital communication standards and protocols, 
the AMBE vocoder FEC should be improved. AMBE 
vocoder is an independent system which is realized in an 
isolated integrated circuit (IC) or a software library.  
To improve the FEC performance of the AMBE vocoder, 
a better FEC can be employed. In [8], the authors show that 
replacing the AMBE forward error correction scheme with a 
combination of block code and 5/6 rate Punctured 
Convolutional Code (PCC) provides 3.35 dB additional gain 
in the high SNR region. But, we can further increase the 
coding gain using solely convolutional codes, hence 
increasing the audio quality and the communication range. 
Although Turbo codes provide more coding gain than 
convolutional codes, they are not suitable for short block size 
such as 49 bits [9] [10]. In addition, it is widely known that 
Low Density Parity Check codes work better when large 
block sizes are utilized [11]. Because we are dealing with a 
small block size, convolutional codes are selected in the 
proposed FEC scheme. In this work, we proposed and 
present an improved FEC which outperforms the AMBE 
standard and the FEC scheme proposed in [8]. 
In the following section, existing FEC schemes are 
described. In Section 3, the proposed FEC scheme is 
explained. In Section 4, the performance analysis is 
presented. In Section 5, the results of the paper and the 
conclusion are explained. In the last section, the future work 
is given.

II. 
EXISTING FEC SCHEMES 
AMBE 3600 bps vocoder is a very low-rate speech coder 
used for voice transmission. Due to the high compression 
ratio every bit of information in the compressed speech data 
stream has low or high importance, but not zero. Compressed 
audio is more vulnerable to bit errors compared to the 
sampled audio. Depending on which parameter bits are 
exposed to bit error, they either distort or impair the 
synthesized voice. So, vocoder frames must be protected 
very well to prevent audio loss in those digital radios using 
speech codecs like AMBE 3600 bps half rate speech coder.  
FEC is a largely researched and advanced technique to 
detect and correct errors in data frames. Different error 
correction codes can recover different number of bits. If the 
data is received with a greater number of errors than that the 
employed FEC can recover, the decoder cannot reconstruct 
the received data correctly. In those conditions, catastrophic 
errors occur while reconstructing data frames. In an 
environment where BER is very low, the AMBE vocoder 
performs well and provides good voice quality at 3600 bps 
[7]. However, when the BER values are very high, the 
AMBE vocoder cannot correct the received vocoder frame 
errors, hence cannot reconstruct the audio. To make the 
AMBE vocoder more noise resistant, a better FEC scheme 
should be implemented. 
One of the most commonly used vocoders, the half rate 
AMBE 3600 bps speech coder, is composed of 2450 bps 
voice and 1150 bps FEC data. By standard, AMBE coded 
voice is sent in 20 ms voice packets. Each voice frame is 
composed of 49 voice data bits and 23 FEC bits. The FEC 
used in the AMBE 3600 bps vocoder incorporates one 
extended Golay (24,12) code and one Golay (23,12) code. 
There is also data dependent scrambler and modulation key 
parameter involved in the FEC scheme. Standard FEC 
implementation is employed to protect the most sensitive 24 
bits while the remaining bits are left unprotected [5]. Block 
diagrams of the AMBE 3600 bps FEC encoder and decoder 
are given in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. 3600 bps AMBE's vocoder FEC encoder scheme 
 
 
 
Figure 2. 3600 bps AMBE`s vocoder FEC decoder scheme. 
 
As seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2, AMBE FEC scheme 
uses modulation key and data dependent scrambler derived 
from the first Golay code while encoding or decoding the 
second Golay code. If an irrecoverable error occurs in the 
first Golay code, the modulation key and the descrambler 
sequence cannot be calculated correctly. Wrong modulation 
key and descrambling sequence create more errors and 
escalade the overall erroneous bit count. Due to the high 
number of bit errors, irrecoverable frames cannot be decoded 
and discarded. Hence, the voice quality falls catastrophically 
and the received speech cannot be synthesized at all due to 
high BER. This chain reaction becomes self-inflicted 
destruction for the vocoder frames. In such situations, the 
AMBE vocoder offers comforting silence or frame repetition 
in the place of irrecoverable frames.  
By standard, AMBE 3600 bps speech coder does not 
protect the whole voice frame from errors. Although less 
error sensitive or less significant vocoder parameter bits have 
less impact on synthesized voice quality, their effect is non-
zero. All the bits in compressed speech have either a major 
or a minor effect on the overall synthesized voice quality. 
For a communication channel where the BER value is lower 
than Pb=10-5, there is no noticeable change in voice quality 
and intelligibility. In contrast, when the BER value is higher 
than Pb=10-5, the synthesized voice quality degrades and 
impairs intelligibility. 
In order to improve the voice quality of the AMBE 3600 
bps vocoder by making the vocoder more immune to errors, 
vocoder frames should have better protection than what 
AMBE provides. To enhance FEC performance, Golay 
(23,12) code along with 5/6 rate convolution code FEC 
scheme was implemented in the AMBE 3600 bps vocoder 
[8]. Hybrid FEC encoder and decoder block diagrams of the 
referenced work are given in Figure 3 and Figure 4, 
respectively.

In the given work, Golay (23,12) code adds additional 
11 bits to 49 bits and makes 60 bits of data. After 5/6 rate 
convolutional code is applied, the frame becomes 72 bits. 
The referenced work incorporates block and convolutional 
codes in sequence to avoid making any modification to the 
AMBE 
vocoder 
frame 
while 
improving 
the 
FEC 
performance and synthesized audio quality.  
III. 
PROPOSED FEC SCHEME 
For 
further 
improvement 
on 
the 
AMBE 
FEC 
performance, instead of using solely block codes or using 
block and convolutional codes in sequence, utilizing purely 
convolutional code yields increased coding gain. To utilize a 
better convolutional code than in [8], the number of FEC bits 
in vocoder frame should be increased by 1 bit. As given 
above, the AMBE standard produces 23 FEC bits for every 
49 vocoder data bits. In digital radio systems where vocoders 
and compressed data are used extensively, bit stealing is 
common practice to reduce data length to optimize the FEC 
or transmitted data rate [13] [14]. In order to steal 1 bit from 
vocoder voice frame data, more than 100 hours (over 19 
million voice frames) of AMBE 3600 bps coded records 
have been analyzed in terms of individual bit probabilities in 
the vocoder voice frame. Bit probabilities in vocoder voice 
frame are given in Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5. Bit probabilities in vocoder voice frame (calculated using 100 
hours, over 19 million voice frames of AMBE 3600 bps record). 
 
As seen in Figure 5, 37th bit in voice frame is zero with a 
82.104% probability. Additionally, 37th bit is one of the less 
sensitive bits in AMBE 3600 bps voice frame and represents 
the least significant bit of 5-bit gain value [7]. Having said 
that, we decided to discard the 37th bit in vocoder frames 
prior to encoding, and add 37th bit back to the frame with 
zero value after decoding. After bit stealing was taken into 
account, a vast number of vocoder voice frames were 
processed and their voice quality was assessed by using the 
perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) method. 
PESQ is an objective method for speech quality assessment 
of narrow-band telephone networks and speech codecs 
developed by the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) [15] [16]. Results of the PESQ tests showed that the 
stolen bit has very low impact on voice quality and 
intelligibility hence, its effect is negligible. PESQ test results 
for randomly selected synthesized speech files are shown in 
Table 1.

After bit stealing, 48 bit long vocoder voice frame 
became suitable for 2/3 rate PCC. The proposed PCC can 
obtain a 1/2 rate convolutional code with constraint length 
12 and the generator polynomial [6765 4627] [17]. The 
block diagrams of the proposed FEC encoder and decoder 
are given in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively.

IV. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
The bit error probabilities of the proposed FEC scheme 
are evaluated for four-level frequency-shift keying (4-FSK) 
modulation by Monte Carlo simulations. In the simulations, 
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is 
employed. For comparison, the BER curves of uncoded 4-
FSK, AMBE standard, Golay codes, hybrid Golay and 5/6 
rate PCC FEC and the proposed 2/3 rate PCC FEC are also 
included in Figure 8.  
 
Figure 8. BER performance of uncoded, AMBE FEC, Golay (23,12) codes 
(AMBE FEC without scrambler), hybrid Golay (23,12) and 5/6 rate PCC 
and proposed 2/3 rate PCC. 
 
Compared to uncoded 4-FSK, the AMBE FEC scheme 
provides an Eb/N0 advantage of approximately 0.31 dB for a 
BER value of Pb=10-5. The hybrid Golay and 5/6 rate PCC 
FEC scheme [8] provides an Eb/N0 advantage of 
approximately 3.35 dB with respect to the AMBE FEC 
scheme. Relative to the hybrid Golay and 5/6 rate PCC FEC 
scheme, the proposed 2/3 rate punctured convolutional code 
FEC scheme provides an Eb/N0 advantage of approximately 
1.06 dB. Moreover, 2/3 rate punctured convolutional code 
FEC achieves 4.41 dB coding gain with respect to the 
AMBE FEC. Also, it can be clearly seen that the Golay code 
without data dependent scrambler (cyan curve), which is 
performance of Golay (24,12) and Golay (23,12) codes in 
sequence, is better than the AMBE FEC due to the high 
number of bit errors caused by the scrambler in low Eb/N0 
values. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
For any of the digital radio systems listed in the 
introduction section, the received vocoder frames are 
conveyed to DVSI’s AMBE 3000 vocoder IC or vocoder 
software library within the radio central processing unit or 
digital signal processing without any interpretation or 
processing. Since voice frames are protected only by 
vocoder FEC, it is easy to change vocoder FEC to obtain 
more coding gain without modifying the air interface 
protocols used in radios. In this work, bit stealing enabled us 
to use 2/3 rate PCC inside the AMBE 3600 bps vocoder 
while preserving audio quality, as shown in the PESQ test 
results. Audio quality measurements are given in terms of 
mean opinion score and obtained using PESQ method. With 
the help of 2/3 rate PCC, we obtained 1.51 dB and 4.41 dB 
coding gain compared to the study in [8] and AMBE 3600 
bps FEC respectively. Increased coding gain provides 
increased voice quality and procures higher communication 
link quality in noisy environments. Increased coding gain 
may also help to extend battery consumption in battery 
powered radio. By utilizing the proposed FEC, we need less 
transmission power to achieve the same performance and 
communication range than that available with the present 
FEC. 
VI. 
FUTURE WORK 
For further improvement on AMBE FEC performance, 
unequal error protection techniques can be utilized to obtain 
more coding gain or increased voice quality. For future 
work, unequal error protection schemes will be evaluated 
and applied in order to enhance voice quality or coding gain.
