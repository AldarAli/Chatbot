Abstract—Many
people
use
Instagram
to
submit
their
experiences related to travel destinations with many hashtag
related keywords for their feelings and experiences. Those
hashtags describe not only their experience,s but also some
values related to the destination. Therefore, Instagram users
search locations with those hashtags to obtain information
about experiences, meals and sightseeing. Hashtags entail
much value for tourists. We have started to find seasonal
trends and a tendency of tourists’ experiences from Instagram
data. We regard it as effective for distributing information to
tourists. This paper describes the accuracy and analytical
method of tourists’ behavioral analysis using hashtags.
Keywords- e-tourism; hashtag; Instagram; social media;
tourist behavior.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Today, many tourists use and enjoy social media as
Social Network Services (SNSs) before travel, during travel,
and after travel. They search for sightseeing information
reviews of travel destinations and post various information
related to sightseeing spots visited by social media. The
media
provide
accumulated
reviews
of
sightseeing
information and review blog sites such as TripAdvisor [1].
In Japan, social media of many kinds exist. Each medium
has characteristic contents, as presented in Table I. Many
users use several media to accommodate their feelings to
post their experiences. Already, Instagram users [2] are more
numerous than Facebook users [3] in Japan [4]. Instagram
not only has many active users; it has many young female
users. This social media site continues to expand.
Many researchers use social media data for tourist
behavior or to provide specific travel information to achieve
tourists’ satisfaction and to attract interested tourists. We
analyzed tourist behavior at sightseeing spots in Japan using
social media and thought about using it for behavior analysis.
This paper describes analyses of tourist behavior and trends
using Instagram hashtags.

PROPOSED ANALYTICAL METHOD FOR INSTAGRAM
DATA
A. Target dataset
We analyze an example of tourists who visited Sapporo
in Hokkaido, which, along with Kyoto, is famous as a Japan
travel destination. We gather data about visiting Sapporo
from Instagram. We search the tourist data in Instagram
using the hashtag of '# 札 幌 旅 行
(Japanese, Sapporo
Travel)’.
When browsing the data of the Sapporo travel hashtag,
one can find posts for marketing use by restaurants, shops
and so on in Sapporo city. These posts are not travelers.
Therefore, we would like to raise the accuracy of tourist
behavior analysis by suggesting a method of narrowing
down travelers' submissions easily.
B. Proposed method specifically examining hashtag
numbers
When extracting data with a hashtag of ‘#札幌旅行
(Japanese, Sapporo Travel)’ from Instagram, we gather the
following dataset.

Period: 06/29/2013 – 12/19/2018

Submission number: 8,229

Number of unique submitting persons: 2,902
For these datasets, we ranked various factors and
examined whether it was possible to conduct meaningful
analyses. First, when ranking these datasets with users with
many posts, as presented in Table II, the most frequent posts
are those from owner id 4317813670, as shown in Figure 1.
The post owner is a shop staff, posting information about
handmade cookies to advertise them to Instagram users.

In addition, when ranking users with many hashtags used
per post, as presented in Table III, one can find messages
introducing stores, restaurants, and shops in the rankings.
Owner Id 2284144589, which uses the greatest number of
hashtags, is a lamb barbecue restaurant. The shop posts its
time sales, as shown in Figure 2.
It is necessary to exclude users in marketing to improve
the accuracy refinement of tourist-only datasets. However,
because it is impossible to check and analyze large amounts
of text data within the posts, we specifically examined the
number of usage hashtags per post by one user and decided
to see if it can choose whether to use marketing depending
on the number of hashtags.
We have hypothesized that the similarity of sentences is
high in postings by marketing users. We assume that persons
who use Instagram for marketing use similar numbers of
hashtags for their messages. To confirm that this hypothesis
is correct, we choose to examine the similarity of sentences
among posted users.
C. Investigation of sentence similarity
To obtain similarity of sentences by edit distance, the
following are two methods for obtaining the edit distance.

Levenshtein distance

Jaro–Winkler Distance
The Levenshtein Distance is the distance represented by
the minimum edit distance of a character string and another
character string. Here we have a standardized Levenshtein
distance. We calculate the similarity of sentences.
The Jaro–Winkler Distance calculates the distance from
the number of characters that match in a character string
different from a certain character string and the necessity of
substitution. The Jaro–Winkler distance means that the
possible values of the distance are 0 to 1. A larger distance
value represents higher similarity between character strings.
The similarity between the previously submitted text and
the next text was calculated on the posted sentence of the
user who made two or more posts from the acquired dataset.
We implemented these two editing distance algorithms and
calculated the editing distance by posted users [5].
Using the edit distance, we graphed both the Levenshtein
distance and the Jaro–Winker Distance similarity of the
posted text. The texts submitted by users according to the
number of posts never achieved higher similarity as the
number of postings increased. Similarly, even if the number
of uses of hashtags increases, the similarity of the submitted
text will not increase, as shown in Figure 3. In other words, it
turned out that the hypothesis that users who have many
posts and hashtags described earlier are doing marketing
activities is not applicable.
To find out if this hypothesis does not hold true, we
examined whether it is specific to the dataset of '#札幌旅行
(Japanese, Sapporo Travel)', we calculated the same editing
distance to the dataset of '# 京 都 旅 行 (Japanese, Kyoto
Travel)'. The newly acquired dataset is the following.

Period: 08/06/2011 – 01/08/2019

Submits number: 303,013

Unique number of submitted persons: 71,484

MMEDIA 2019 : The Eleventh International Conference on Advances in Multimedia

As in the case of Sapporo travel, the similarity of the
posted text by post number and by hashtags was calculated,
as shown in Figure 4.
For this dataset of Kyoto trips, even though the number
of posts and hashtags usage increased, it was not apparent
that the similarity of the text being posted would be high.
Based on the number of hashtags of Instagram, it turned out
that it can not readily exclude postings that are made as
marketing tasks.
We speculated that shops and restaurants that use
Instagram for marketing are repeatedly posting similar texts.
However, a guess can not be formulated even if the editing
distance is obtained. At present, we can not exclude posts by
restaurants and shops using marketing unless full-text
analysis is used.
III.
TOURIST BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
According to Section II, it is not possible to exclude
marketing activities using the number of hashtags for post
messages under Instagram. We use the acquired data as is
and analyze the tourist behavior. The analytical method is
applied as follows and analysis is made as to whether there is
periodicity.
1.
Quarterly ranking of hashtags included in posting
messages at 2018
2.
Quarterly
classification
tendency
of
posted
photographs at 2-18
3.
Quarterly hashtags ranking of posts containing food
in posted photographs at 2018
4.
Trend analysis for the “Shime Parfait”
First, we created quarterly rankings of hashtags in 2018
included in posting text and investigated whether the posting
tendency differs depending on the time, as presented in Table
IV. Many hash tags attached with hashtags of Sapporo travel
indicate that Sapporo City is a city in Hokkaido; most post
users use hashtags for location of Hokkaido, Sapporo and
someplace of Sapporo area. Additionally, because the
hashtags of "#札幌グルメ(Japanese, Sapporo gourmet)" are
raised to the top, one can see that it is possible to enjoy a
meal on a Sapporo trip.
When the data are acquired using Instagram, the JSON
element data ‘accessibility_caption’ are included for each
post. These data show what is included in the posted pictures
by Instagram's own classification result as follows.
“accessibility_caption”: "Image may contain: food"
It is possible to classify the posted photographs using this
parameter. Therefore, we created a quarterly ranking of
‘accessibility_caption’ at 2018, as presented in Table V. By
this ranking, one can see that the images are always on top
with the food and the self-portraits.
Instagram does not disclose what technology is used for
'accessibility_caption' or how it analyzes information related
to photos. Therefore, detailed analysis can not be performed
using this parameter. However, because it can be understood
simply whether the photograph is food, person, indoor or
outdoor, it is thought that analysis by hash tag can be
explored and developed further.
According to the ranking of hashtags attached to pictures
of which food is taken, filter by accessibility_caption
parameter, the top places of course have many hashtags of
place names, but also include hashtags of specific foods such
as sweets, Lamb meat barbecue called “Genghis Khan,” and
ice cream and gelato, as presented in Table VI. The rankings
of sweets and cafés are nearly equal. Therefore, it is thought
that they are eating sweets at a cafe.
Hashtag analysis can be used to check trends. For
instance, magazines and web contents for Sapporo trips are
written about “Sapporo Shime Parfait,” a cold and sweet
parfait that people can enjoy after a night of drinking. Since
the Sapporo Parfait committee was established at September
1, 2015, it has advertised this item on its Web site [6].
Comparing “Shime Parfait” to the famous food of
Sapporo, “Genghis Khan,” tourists have gradually come to
enjoy “Shime Parfait” as depicted in Figure 5 with a post and
impressions. In addition, the extraction of the number of
postings is done while considering synonyms.
By analyzing the use of hashtags, we can analyze the
reasons for tourism given by visitors to Sapporo. Because
these datasets are not limited to tourists, specific hashtags
such as soup curry, lamb meat barbecue, and ice cream are
assumed to be posted as a marketing strategy, so asking for
seasonality by quarterly ranking can be regarded as difficult.
IV.
CONCLUSION
The active use of Instagram is expanding. Many users
enjoy posting pictures and videos to Instagram when they
visit some place. Therefore, one can analyze the purpose of
tourists visiting sightseeing spots by using the hashtags
assigned to Instagram data. However, analysis of hashtags to
analyze what meals tourists are enjoying in Sapporo, and
what photographs tourists are taking when they are alone is
impossible. Analyzing images of the posted photographs or
analyzing the text body is necessary to conduct a detailed
analysis.
Instagram can also post to Facebook and Twitter [7]
simultaneously. Therefore, instead of conducting an analysis
using Instagram data only, using methods such as analyzing
the behavior of tourists in conjunction with analysis of
tweets with location information can provide data for tourism
behavior analysis without building a complicated system.
V.
FUTURE WORK
As a method of finding similar posts, it is possible to
calculate Jaccard coefficients by extracting hashtags from the
contribution text in a regular expression. We would like to
find
a
method
of eliminating
information posted
by
companies and shops to gather more accurate tourist data.
Because it is possible to post from Instagram to Twitter
simultaneously, we conducted an analysis of places related to
meals and places where seasonal variation occurs. By
combining tweet data with positional information in Sapporo
and hashtag analysis of Instagram, a more precise analysis of
tourist behavior in Sapporo can be conducted.
