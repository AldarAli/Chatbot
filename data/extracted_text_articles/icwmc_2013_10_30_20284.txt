Abstract— In this paper, the complex Switch and Stay 
Combining/Maximal Ratio Combining (SSC/MRC) combiner 
will be considered. The output signal is observed at two time 
moments in the presence of Rice fading. Both combiners, SSC 
such as MRC, are dual branches. The probability density 
function (PDF) at the output of the complex combiner will be 
obtained and the bit error rate (BER) for binary phase swift 
keying (BPSK) modulation will be determined. The results will 
be shown graphically in some figures. The improvement of 
using this kind of complex SSC/MRC combiner, with regard to 
classical MRC and SSC combiners at one time moment, is 
emphasized.

INTRODUCTION 
The fading is one of the most important reason for 
system performance degradation in mobile communication. 
Many different communication systems are subjected to 
fading caused by multipath propagation due to reflection, 
refraction and scattering by buildings, trees and other large 
structures [1]. Because of that received signal is a sum of 
different signals that arrive via different propagation paths. 
Some statistical models are used in the literature to 
describe the fading envelope of the received signal such as 
Rayleigh and Rician distributions [2]. They are used to 
characterize the envelope of faded signals over small 
geographical areas (short term fading). The log-normal and 
gamma distribution are used when much wider geographical 
areas is involved.  
There are several ways to reduce fading influence on 
system performances without increasing the signal power 
and channel capacity. The diversity reception techniques are 
used extensively in fading radio channels to reduce the 
effects of fading on system performances [3].  
The use of diversity is significant if there is statistical 
independence in the fading of the received signal in each of 
the diversity branches. The assumption of statistical 
independence between the diversity channels is valid only if 
they are sufficiently separated [2]. In mobile radio systems 
the signals at the mobile station become decorrelated as the 
antenna separation increases. In space diversity systems an 
antenna separation of 30 to 50 wavelengths is required to 
have correlation coefficients strictly between zero and one-
third, in which case, for a two-channel maximal-ratio system 
in a Rayleigh-fading environment, the effect of correlation 
may be ignored [4]. 
However, there are other cases of practical interest where 
the assumption of statistical independence is not valid [5]. A 
long time ago Al-Hussani and Al-Bassion studied the effect 
of correlation on the performance of a dual-branch MRC 
combiner for correlated Nakagami fading channel. They 
found that for the Nakagami-fading environment and for a 
worst case fading condition and identical signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) in each of two branches, the performance 
difference between a single channel and dual channels 
system increases from 3 to 24 dB as the correlation 
coefficient decreases from unity to zero.  
There are several kinds of diversity combining schemes 
such as Maximal-Ratio Combining (MRC), which is the 
optimal combining scheme [3]. In this combiner signals from 
all inputs are summed. Because MRC requires cognition of 
the channel fading parameters, it is the most complicated 
combining model [3].  
The next by performances is Equal Gain Combining 
(EGC) [6], and then Selection Combining (SC) and Switch 
and Stay Combining (SSC), with lower performances. These 
combining models are simpler and cheaper and they are very 
often implemented in practice whereas SC and SSC 
combining models do not require signal cophasing and 
fading envelope evaluation [7]. 
SSC is simplification of the system complexity, but with 
losing in quality. In this model, the receiver selects an 
antenna until its value drops below predetermined threshold. 
Then, the receiver switches to other antenna and stay with it 
for the next time slot, regardless the channel quality of that

antenna is above or below the threshold. In the literature, 
mainly dual SSC schemes have been analyzed [8]. 
By the authors' knowledge in the new open literature 
these problems are not treated by sampling in two time 
moments, except by this group of authors. We derived the 
expressions for joint probability density function of the SSC 
combiner output signal in the presence of different fading 
distributions in two time moments (for example in [9] for 
log-normal) and based on them determined the performance 
analysis of SSC/SC combiner at two time moments in the 
presence of log-normal and Rayleigh fading in [10], [11]. 
The bit error rates for SSC/MRC combiner at two time 
moments in the presence of log-normal, Rayleigh and Hoyt 
fading we determined in [12]-[14], respectively. 
In this paper, the probability density function and the bit 
error rate, based on it, for SSC/MRC combiner output signal 
in the channel with Rice fading and sampling at two time 
moments during one time interval, will be considered. The 
system is more complicated compared to classical MRC and 
SSC systems at one time moment, but with better 
performances. That imply that bit error rate can be increased 
and transmit power can be reduced comparing to classical 
systems.  
This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents 
related works; Section III gives the complex SSC/MRC 
system model and the probability density functions 
derivations, such as the bit error rate of the SSC/MRC 
combiner output signal at two time moments. Sections IV 
shows the numerical results obtained for performances 
introduced in previous sections. Finally, the main gains 
obtained in the paper are pointed out in Section V, 
Conclusion.  
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The model of the SSC/MRC combiner with two inputs, 
considering in this paper, is presented in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.   Complex dual SSC/MRC combiner. 
The complex SSC/MRC combiner with two branches at 
two time moments is considered. 
At the inputs of the first part of complex combiner the 
signals are r11 and r21 at first time moment and they are r12 
and r22 at second time moment. The output signals from SSC 
part of complex combiner are r1 and r2. The first index 
represents the branch ordinal number and the other one signs 
the time moment observed. The indices at the output signal 
correspond to the time moments considered. The SSC 
combiner output signals r1 and r2, are the inputs for the MRC 
combiner. Finally, the overall output signal is r. 
The joint probability density function of correlated 
signals r1 and r2 at the SSC combiner output, at two time 
moments, Rice distributed and with same parameters σi and 
Ai [15], is obtained in closed form from expressions in [9, eq. 
(3) - (6)] as

NUMERICAL RESULTS  
Some values of the bit error rate for different types of 
combiners and correlation parameters, are presented in Fig. 2 
and 3, where it is assumed that both inputs have the same 
channel parameters. It is adopted that rt is the optimal 
threshold for the SSC decision [3]:

The family of curves for the BER is shown in Fig. 2 
versus different distribution parameter A.  
 
 
Figure 2.  Bit error rate for different types of combiners versus parameter 
A for σ =1 
 
 
It consists of four curves: one for one channel receiver, 
the other for MRC combiner at one time moment, third for 
SSC/MRC combiner at two time moments for uncorrelated 
case, and fourth for very strong correlation. 
We can see that SSC/MRC combiner has remarkably 
better performances for uncorrelated case then MRC 
combiner considered at one time moment. For ρ =1 the BER 
curves for complex SSC/MRC combiner and for MRC 
combiner coincide with each other. Thus, it is visible that 
utilization of this complex SSC/MRC combiner provides 
better performance of the system for uncorrelated signals, 
but for strong correlation it is not economic to use complex 
combiner. 
The influence of correlation to the bit error rate of 
complex SSC/MRC combiner is presented in Fig. 3. The 
benefits of using this type of combiner increases with 
decreasing of correlation between input signals. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Bit error rate  for SSC/MRC combiner versus  parameter A for 
σ=1 and for different values of ρ  
 
It is obvious that using of complex SSC/MRC combiner 
results in better performance of the system, because the BER 
for uncorrelated SSC/MRC combiner decreases regarding 
MRC combiner. Also, it is apparent that there is no 
economic reason for the use of complex SSC/MRC combiner 
in the case of strong correlations between input signals since 
then characteristics are not better than for simple MRC 
combiner.

CONCLUSIONS 
The probability density function of output signal at two 
time moments, for complex dual SSC/MRC combiner, is 
determined in this paper in closed form expressions. The bit 
error probability is calculated on that basis. 
This 
is 
important 
for 
the 
system 
performance 
determination for system deciding by two samples. First, the 
joint probability density function of the SSC combiner 
output signal at two time moments is derived and used as 
input of MRC combiner. The obtained results for bit error 
rate are calculated and shown graphically. The performance 
improvement of SSC/MRC combiner at two time moments, 
comparing with classical SSC and MRC combiners, is
