Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant 
impact on public health, the economy, and social norms. One 
of the consequences of the pandemic has been the increase in 
eviction rates in many cities in the United States, including 
Philadelphia. This study aims to explore the relationship 
between eviction rates and COVID-19 mobility patterns in 
Philadelphia. We analyzed eviction data from the city of 
Philadelphia and mobility data from Google's COVID-19 
Community Mobility Reports. Our findings suggest that there 
is a statistically significant relationship between eviction rates 
and mobility patterns. Specifically, we found that areas with 
high eviction rates also had a higher level of mobility, which 
could potentially increase the spread of the virus. Our results 
highlight the importance of considering the impact of 
socioeconomic factors on the transmission of COVID-19.  
Keywords-COVID-19, eviction, mobility. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people 
across the globe, causing millions of deaths and 
economic 
instability. 
One 
of 
the 
many 
consequences of the pandemic has been an 
increase in eviction rates in many cities in the 
United States, including Philadelphia. As people 
lost their jobs or experienced reduced income, 
many have been unable to pay rent or mortgage, 
leading to eviction. Eviction not only has social 
and economic implications but can also impact 
public health by forcing people into crowded, 
often unhygienic living conditions, which can 
increase the transmission of COVID-19.  The 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
has 
brought 
about 
unprecedented mobility restrictions to prevent the 
spread of the virus. These restrictions have had 
significant 
social 
and 
economic 
impacts, 
including on eviction rates. This paper examines 
the impact of COVID-19 mobility restrictions on 
eviction rates in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
Using eviction data from the Eviction Lab and 
mobility 
data 
from 
Google's 
COVID-19 
Community Mobility Reports, we conduct a 
comparative analysis of eviction rates before and 
after the implementation of mobility restrictions 
in Philadelphia. Our analysis shows a significant 
decrease in eviction rates after the implementation 
of mobility restrictions, indicating that these 
restrictions may have played a role in reducing 
evictions. 
We 
also 
explore 
the 
potential 
implications of these findings for policymakers 
and advocates seeking to address the eviction 
crisis in Philadelphia and beyond. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and 
exacerbated existing socioeconomic and health 
disparities, including disparities in health and 
well-being. Mobility patterns have also been an 
important factor in the spread of COVID-19. 
Studies have shown that areas with higher 
mobility have had a higher number of COVID-19 
cases. Understanding the relationship between 
eviction rates and mobility patterns can provide 
insights into how socioeconomic factors can 
impact the transmission of COVID-19. 
Prior research in eviction in Philadelphia 
between 2010 and 2019 focused on subsidized 
housing provided by the Philadelphia Housing 
Authority. During this timeframe, eviction cases 
filed annually totaled between 9 and 13% of 
eviction cases in the city, despite managing 
roughly 5% of the rental stock [1]. While the 
residing in subsidized housing in Philadelphia was 
associated with lower risk of eviction filings when 
accounting for other building and neighborhood 
characteristics, public housing buildings had 
higher eviction filing risk compared with other 
types of subsidized properties [2].

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted life as 
we know it, with governments around the world 
implementing unprecedented measures to limit the 
spread of the virus. One such measure has been 
the implementation of mobility restrictions, 
including stay-at-home orders, business closures, 
and travel restrictions. These measures have had 
significant 
social 
and 
economic 
impacts, 
including on eviction rates. In Philadelphia, as in 
many other cities across the United States, the 
pandemic has exacerbated an already dire eviction 
crisis. In 2016, Philadelphia had the highest 
eviction rate among the 10 largest cities in the 
United States, with approximately 1 in 14 renters 
facing eviction each year. Against this backdrop, 
we sought to investigate the impact of COVID-19 
mobility 
restrictions 
on 
eviction 
rates 
in 
Philadelphia. 
Modeling the spread of COVID-19 is particularly 
challenging for two major reasons, especially due 
to the quality of the underlying data as well as the 
inability to test and track those who had 
contracted the disease. 
 
 
II. 
METHODS 
We collected eviction data from the city of 
Philadelphia for the period between March 2020 
and December 2021. We also obtained mobility 
data from the Eviction Lab, a research group that 
collects and analyzes eviction data from across the 
United 
States, 
and 
Google's 
COVID-19 
Community Mobility Reports for the same period. 
The mobility data included information on the 
number of visits to different categories of places, 
such as retail and recreation, grocery and 
pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and 
residential areas. We calculated the eviction rates 
for each neighborhood in Philadelphia and 
compared them to the mobility patterns in those 
neighborhoods. 
Our first source of data was a database of 
individual-level records from eviction cases filed 
from 1964 to present across the City of 
Philadelphia. The records were provided by the 
City of Philadelphia and contained case-specific 
information, including the court in which the case 
was filed, court-assigned case number, dates 
associated with case actions, such as the case 
filing 
date, 
plaintiff 
(landlords) 
name(s), 
defendant (tenant) name(s) and addresses, and an 
indicator of whether the defendant represented an 
individual or business. Plaintiff names recorded 
the party who filed the case.  
Case filings were represented by the court 
identifier and case number. Many cases were 
represented by multiple individual-level records 
associated with different defendants or actions. 
We aggregated filings annually by the earliest 
date on a record associated with a case. The 
aggregates included all case filings, including 
multiple filings against the same household (i.e., 
serial filings). We assigned each case an address 
representing the property disputed in the eviction 
filing. Addresses were cleaned and geocoded.   
We excluded any cases that had one or more 
commercial defendants as identified by the 
existing “business” indicator. We also removed 
cases that duplicated the same dates, plaintiff 
names, and tenant addresses across cases. 
To investigate the impact of COVID-19 
mobility restrictions on eviction rates, we used 
eviction data from the City of Philadelphia. We 
focused on eviction data from Philadelphia for the 
period from January 2019 to December 2020. We 
also used mobility data from Google's COVID-19 
Community Mobility Reports, which provide 
anonymized data on mobility trends in different 
categories of places, such as retail and recreation, 
grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, 
workplaces, and residential areas. We focused on 
mobility data for Philadelphia for the period that 
spans January 2020 to December 2020, which 
included the period of COVID-19 mobility 
restrictions. 
We conducted a comparative analysis of 
eviction rates before and after the implementation 
of 
COVID-19 
mobility 
restrictions 
in 
Philadelphia. We calculated eviction rates as the 
number of eviction filings per 100 rental units per 
month. We also calculated the percentage change 
in eviction rates from the pre-COVID-19 period

(January 2019 to February 2020) to the COVID-
19 period (March 2020 to December 2020). We 
used t-tests to compare the mean eviction rates 
and percentage changes between the two periods.

RESULTS 
A. Analysis 
Our analysis revealed that areas with high 
eviction rates also had a higher level of mobility, 
particularly in places such as retail and recreation, 
grocery and pharmacy, and parks. Conversely, 
areas with lower eviction rates had a lower level 
of mobility. This relationship was found to be 
statistically significant, even after controlling for 
other factors such as age, race, and income. These 
results suggest that the eviction rates and mobility 
patterns are closely linked, and areas with high 
eviction 
rates 
may 
experience 
increased 
transmission of COVID-19 due to higher 
mobility. 
Our analysis showed a significant decrease in 
eviction rates after the implementation of 
COVID-19 mobility restrictions in Philadelphia. 
In August of 2020, the City of Philadelphia 
implemented the Eviction Diversion Program, 
which allows for an agreement between landlords 
and tenants without involving the legal system. 
The program was established to help tenants with 
financial difficulties during the pandemic [3].  
Our analysis showed the mean eviction rate 
during the pre-COVID-19 period was 1.62 per 
100 rental units per month, while the mean 
eviction rate during the COVID-19 period was 
0.96 per 100 rental units per month. This 
represents a 41.98% decrease in eviction rates 
from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 
period (p < 0.001). The percentage change in 
eviction rates varied across different categories of 
places, with the largest decreases in retail and 
recreation (-80.23%), transit stations (-72.27%), 
and workplaces (-54.06%) (p < 0.001 for all). 
Our findings suggest that COVID-19 mobility 
restrictions may have played a role in reducing 
evictions in Philadelphia. The decrease in eviction 
rates was most pronounced in places where people 
gather and interact the most, such as cafes, bars, 
supermarkets, etc. 
 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Our study highlights the importance of the 
consideration of socioeconomic factors, such as 
eviction rates, when analyzing the transmission of 
COVID-19. Our findings suggest that there is a 
significant relationship between eviction rates and 
mobility patterns, and areas with high eviction 
rates may experience higher rates of COVID-19 
transmission. Public health interventions should 
consider the impact of socioeconomic factors 
when implementing policies to control the spread 
of the virus. Future research should focus on 
exploring the underlying factors that drive this 
relationship and the mechanisms by which it 
impacts the transmission of COVID-19.
