Abstract— Seated balance, especially for the application of 
wheelchair users, has become an area of interest for 
researchers. Numerous studies have been done to date, which 
analyze the effects of wheelchair propulsion on shoulders and 
limbs, but little study has been done in regards to trunk 
muscles and their stabilization effects. Therefore, for this 
study, motorized rotational motion at a rotational angle of 45 
degrees was performed on nine subjects in both the forward 
and backwards directions of motion. Eight abdominal and 
back trunk muscles (rectus abdominis, external oblique, 
thoracic erector spinae, and lumbar erector spinae) were 
analyzed via electromyography (EMG). In addition, the effect 
of the presence of virtual reality was analyzed on the muscle 
activity. Each trial was made up of four randomized test, and 
were performed three times each on each subject for accuracy 
purposes. The acquired raw signals were processed in 
MATLAB, and their results were analyzed. It was found that 
the most muscle activity was present in the forward rotational 
direction while visuals were playing on the screen in front of 
the subject. This indicates, that it is under that condition that 
the muscles work their hardest in order to stabilize the body 
and maintain balance.

 INTRODUCTION 
The study of seated balance with rehabilitation 
engineering has been an area of great interest to many 
researchers. One of the reasons for this is its wide are of 
application. Understanding seated balance and the factors 
which affect it become increasingly valuable when dealing 
with individuals in wheelchairs. Although wheelchairs were 
revolutionary in helping disabled individuals get around, 
they are not without their drawbacks, as their prolonged use 
can lead to possible injuries [1]. When a wheelchair travels 
over uneven surfaces, the inevitable motions which it causes 
the human body to endure can lead to tendinitis, carpal 
tunnel syndrome, and even back pain [2]-[6]. Moreover, 
when these users utilize ramps to go from one level to 
another, their bodies lean towards the direction opposite to 
the direction of motion in order to reduce tipping and 
maintain stability [7]. However, since these individuals tend 
to have weaker stabilizing trunk muscles either due to spinal 
cord injury, or atrophy [8]. This limits the amount of 
directional leaning their body can perform in order to shift 
their centre of mass and remain balanced [2].  
Fortunately, a vast number of studies have been 
performed to date which assess the effect that wheelchair 
propulsion has on muscles [9, 10]. However, the focus of 
these studies has been on shoulder and upper limb muscles, 
and very little study has been done on trunk muscles, which 
is surprising as it has been suggested that these trunk muscles 
play a vital role in stabilization of balance during wheelchair 
propulsion [11][12].  
Yang, et al. [11], and Howarth, et al. [13] both performed 
studies examining lower back and abdominal muscle 
contractions through electromyography (EMG). They did so 
while subjects were in forward wheelchair propulsion, and 
they found that the initial stages of motion produced the 
highest muscle activity. Moreover, other studies such as the 
ones mentioned have focused on manual wheelchair 
propulsion, and only on even surfaces. It is important to note 
though that as technology rapidly advances, motorized 
wheelchairs, as well as scooters are becoming more widely 
used. Furthermore, they travel over uneven surfaces and 
ramps on a regular basis.  
This became the motivation behind our study, in which 
decided to focus on the effects of motorized rotational 
motion on the stabilizing trunk muscles. Specifically, the 
muscles which we focused on were the Rectus Abdominis 
(RA), External Oblique (EO), Thoracic Erector Spinae (TE), 
and Lumbar Eector Spinae (LE). To add another layer to this 
study, we decided to combine the motion with visuals 
achieved through virtual reality, which allowed us to perform 
a comparison on the effects that visuals have on stabilization.  
All of the studies were performed on healthy subjects in 
order to set the baseline in determining how a healthy 
individual’s muscles should be contracting. As a further step 
in the future, the study could be expanded to wheelchair 
users in order to analyze their muscle deficiencies as 
compared to a healthy individual. 
Virtual reality allows for the study of the link between 
physical human behaviour and perception [14]. Furthermore, 
it allows for the recreation and analysis of the outside world 
in a lab setting which can be controlled [15]. Although 
virtual reality has been extensively studied for the purpose of 
training and rehabilitation, little has been done in the field to 
date in regards to seated balance for wheelchair users 
[16][18]. However, when testing during rotational motion, 
the chances of experiencing motion sickness increase 
according to the sensory conflict theory. This theory states 
111

that when there are conflicting visual and vestibular inputs, 
disequilibrium occurs, resulting in motion sickness [19][20]. 
This paper will proceed by looking at the methods used 
for this study in section II, including subject selection, 
experimental setup, and trials. Section III will move on to 
outlining the produced results of the trials. The results will 
be discussed in section IV and compared to previous studies, 
and finally section V will wrap up with the concluding 
remarks. 
II. 
METHODS 
A. Subjects 
This study was performed on nine healthy subjects (two 
males, and seven females), between the ages 20 and 30 
years old. None of the recruited subjects had any pre-
existing medical conditions or injuries. Approval from the 
Ryerson University Research Ethics Board had been sought 
after and received prior to the commencement of this study. 
B. Experimental Setup 
For this study, a motorized rotational device, the 
MaxFlight FS-VC Dual System motion simulator, was used 
to mimic the motions that a typical wheelchair goes through 
on a daily basis. This world class simulator is the only one 
of its kind which can rotate a full 360 degrees in both the 
pitch and roll directions. It has an option in which the angle 
and direction of motion can be manually set to any value 
between 0 and 360 degrees. Figure 1 illustrates the 
simulator with an open cockpit, and Figure 2 shows the 
simulator while in motion.

Once a subject has met the eligibility requirements, their 
muscles were wiped with alcohol swabs in preparation for 
electrode attachment. Two Ag/AgCl electrodes (3M™ Red 
Dot™ Monitoring Electrodes) were placed on each of the 
following trunk muscles with an approximate interelectrode 
distance of 3 cm: Rectus Abdominis (RA) – 3 cm lateral to 
the umbilicus (belly button), External Oblique (EO) – 5 cm 
lateral to the rectus abdominis, Thoracic Erector Spinae 
(TE) – 5 cm lateral to the T9 spinal disk, and Lumbar 
Erector Spinae (LE) – 3 cm lateral to the L4 spinal disk. As 
previously mentioned, these muscles play a key role in 
seated balance, and were chosen for that reason.

The electrodes were then connected to the CleveMed 
Bioradio 150 data acquisition device via snap-leads. The 
CleveMed Bioradio then transmitted the acquired signals to 
a nearby computer wirelessly.  
C. Trials 
Trials were performed in both the forward and backwards 
directions, each at a rotational angle of 45 degrees. 
Additionally, each trial in each direction was performed 
both wile visuals were playing on the screen in front of the 
subject, and also when visuals were not present. Moreover, 
each trial was performed three times for accuracy assurance. 
As subjects were not told which direction they were about to 
travel, and the order of the trials was randomized, this was a 
blind study. Subjects were given a ten minute break halfway 
between the study in order to minimize any possible motion 
sickness.  
D. Signal Processing 
A sampling frequency of 960 Hz was used for data 
acquisition of the raw signal. Once the raw signal had been 
112

obtained, it was rectified, and a low-pass Butterworth filter 
(4th order) with a cut-off frequency of 6 Hz was used to 
filter out the noise from the signal. 
                       
 
           
 
               
      (1) 
Where N is the order of filter, Ωc is the corner frequency, Ωp 
is the pass-band edge frequency, and 1/(1+ε2) is the band 
edge value of |H(Ω)|2. 
Next, in order to visualize the overall shape and 
amplitude of the muscle activity, the envelope of the 
rectified signal was obtained. Subsequently, the three trials 
for each condition were averaged in order to reduce noise 
due to biological factors during data acquisition. This 
resulted in a single signal, which was representative of the 
muscle.  
In order to analyze the amount of muscle activity, the 
root mean square (RMS) of the averaged signal was 
obtained.

      (2) 
Finally, the work done by the muscle (related to the 
amount of contractions) was determined by finding the 
integral of the signal, referred to as the iEMG.

RESULTS 
All of the calculations were performed in MATLAB, 
including the production of the figures. Since eight muscles 
of nine subjects were recorded under four conditions, a 
plethora of results and figures were produced. In the interest 
of saving space, the figures for subject 2, and the RMS ans 
iEMG values for subject 5 will be displayed only, as they 
were the most representative of the results overall. To recap, 
each of the previously mentioned eight muscles were 
analyzed under the following four conditions: 
 Forwards direction, visuals present (FV) 
 Backwards direction, visuals present (BV) 
 Forwards direction, visuals not present (FN) 
 Backwards direction, visuals not present (BN) 
Furthermore, each of the eight channels represents the 
following muscles:

Ch.2: Left Rectus Abdominis (RA) 
Ch.3: Right External Oblique (EO) 
Ch.4: Left External Oblique (EO) 
Ch.5: Right Lumbar Erector Spinae (LE) 
Ch.6: Left Lumbar Erector Spinae (LE) 
Ch.7: Right Thoracic Erector Spinae (TE) 
Ch.8: Left Thoracic Erector Spinae (TE) 
Figures 3-7 represents the produced results as a signal 
goes through the signal processing algorithm (FV used as an 
example).

When comparing the raw signal in Figure 3 to the filtered 
averaged signal in Figure 6, it can be seen just how effective 
the signal processing algorithm was in cleaning the signal 
and removing unwanted excess noise from the signal.  
As the RMS and iEMG values represent the work done 
by each muscles, they will be compared under the various 
conditions, as illustrated by Tables I and II.

DISCUSSION 
Upon analyzing the produced graphs of all nine subjects, 
it was noted that amongst the different conditions the overall 
shape of the muscle response was very similar for the same 
subject, which was expected.  
Moreover, when looking at all of the RMS and iEMG 
tables for all nine subjects, it can be seen that the RMS 
values of the back muscles (Ch. 5-8) are consistently lower 
than those of the front abdominal muscles (Ch. 1-4). This 
finding illustrates the fact that it is the posterior back 
muscles that play a larger role in upper body stabilization.  
Furthermore, higher RMS and iEMG values were 
produced when the subjects were travelling in the forwards 
rotational direction. It is important to note that when the 
subjects are travelling in the backwards direction, the back 
of the seat is there to support them, a possible reason as to 
why the trunk muscles do not need to work as hard to 
stabilize.  
The final trend is that the RMS and iEMG values of the 
muscles tend to be higher when visuals were playing on the 
screen as opposed to when the screen was turned off. This 
was expected, as when the visuals are playing on the screen, 
it 
gives 
the 
subject 
the 
feeling 
that 
they 
are 
travelling/displaying more than they actually are. If the 
subject perceives their fall to be steeper, their muscles will 
work harder to stabilize the body, resulting in higher RMS 
and iEMG values. Moreover, when the screen was turned 
off, it was pitch black inside of the motion simulator cabin, 
so the subject was not able to place themselves in relation to 
the surrounding environment, and likewise, their muscles 
did not feel as though they had to work as hard to stabilize 
balance 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
When looking at the findings overall and summarizing 
them, it can be concluded that the FV (forward direction, 
visuals present) condition had the highest muscle activity, as 
determined by the RMS and iEMG values, and thus, the 
muscles had to work the hardest in that condition in order to 
stabilize and maintain balance. All of the findings could be 
used for the development of effective rehabilitation 
programs, including virtual reality training.
