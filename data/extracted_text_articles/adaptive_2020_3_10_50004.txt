Abstract—With increasing threats by large attacks or disasters,
the time has come to reconstruct network infrastructures such
as communication or transportation systems rather than to
recover them as before in case of accidents, because many real
networks are extremely vulnerable. Thus, we consider self-healing
mechanisms by rewirings (reuse or addition of links) to be
sustainable and resilient networks even against malicious attacks.
In distributed local process for healing, the key strategies are the
extension of candidates of linked nodes and enhancing loops by
applying a message-passing algorithm inspired from statistical
physics. Simulation results show that our proposed combination
of ring formation and enhancing loops is particularly effective in
comparison with the conventional methods, when more than half
damaged links work or are compensated from reserved ones.

INTRODUCTION
In contemporary world, network infrastructures, such as
communication, trading, transportation, energy and water sup-
ply systems are crucial for supporting social activities, econ-
omy, industrial production, etc., while increasing the frequency
of large disasters or military conﬂicts turn threats by destroying
the functions into reality. To confront the serious problems,
a new supple approach resilience [1][2] attracts much atten-
tion in system engineering, biology, ecology, and sociology.
Resilience means the ability to sustain basic objective and
integrity even in encountering with the extreme change of
situations or environments (e.g., by disasters or malicious at-
tacks) for technological system, organization, or individual [1].
However, to be resilient system, the concept of safety against
accidents or disruptions should be extended from Safety-I to
Safety-II [3]: from “as few things as possible go wrong” to
“as many things as possible go right”, from “reactive, respond
when something happens” to “proactive, continuously trying
to anticipate developments and events”, and so on, in these two
complementary views, which do not conﬂict. Safety-II requires
to adjust, adapt, develop, and design better processes with
technological or human resource allocations. Moreover, the
concept of resilience includes reorganization or reconstruction
of the system with adaptive capacity beyond the conventional
recovery [4], as shown in Table I. Such paradigm shift has
afﬁnity to self-adaptive mechanism or system. Thus, we focus
on developing new mechanism to lead to (social-ecological)
resilience with reconstruction as far as accepting innovation
rather than ﬁnding and decreasing weak or wrong parts in a
network system.

In this paper, we study how to reconstruct a sustainable
network under limited resource, and propose effective self-
healing methods based on enhancing loops through a local
process around damaged parts. The motivations for enhanc-
ing loops are as follows. There is a common topological
structure called Scale-Free (SF) in many social, biological,
and technological networks [5][6]. Although the SF networks
have an extreme vulnerability against malicious attacks [7], it
has been found that onion-like structure with positive degree-
degree correlations gives the optimal robustness of connectivity
[8][9]. Onion-like structure can be generated by whole rewiring
[8][10] in enhancing the correlations under a given degree
distribution. Moreover, since dismantling and decycling prob-
lems are asymptotically equivalent at inﬁnite graphs in a large
class of random networks with light-tailed degree distribution
[11], a tree remains without loops at the critical state before
the complete fragmentation by node removals. Dismantling
(or decycling) problem known as NP-hard [12] is to ﬁnd
the minimum set of nodes in which removal leaves a graph
broken into connected components whose maximum size is
at most a constant (or a graph without loops). It is suggested
that the robustness becomes stronger as many loops exist as
possible. In fact, to be onion-like networks, enhancing loops
by copying or intermediation is effective for improving the

robustness in incrementally growing methods [13][14] based
on a local distributed process. Thus, we remark that loops make
bypasses and may be more important than the degree-degree
correlations in order to improve the connectivity in a net-
work reconstruction after large disasters or attacks. However,
identifying the necessary nodes to form loops is intractable
due to combinatorial NP-hardness, we effectively apply an
approximate calculation based on a statistical physics approach
in our proposed self-healing. We assume that rewirings (reuse
of undestroyed links) are performed by changing directions or
ranges of ﬂight routes or wireless beams in the healing process,
though we do not discuss the detail realization that depends
on the current or future technologies and target systems.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section
2, we introduce the conventional methods for recovery and
healing of a damaged network, and newly discuss some lim-
itations and extensions of the resource for connecting nodes.
In Section 3, we explain our proposed self-healing method. In
Section 4, we show the effect of healing on the connectivity
and the efﬁciency of paths in damaged real networks by
malicious attacks through computer simulation. In Section 5,
we summarize the obtained results and mention a future work.
II.
RELATED WORK
We brieﬂy review recent progress of typical methods for
recovery and healing of a network in complex network science
(inspired from fractal statistical physics) and computer science.
In complex network science, several recovery and heal-
ing methods have been proposed. As one of the recovery
methods, the strategies of random, greedy (for regaining the
largest connectivity), and preferential recovery weighted by
population have been considered in taking into account the
order of recovered links [15]. The effectiveness of recovery
from localized attacks is investigated on a square lattice.
Against link failures, a simple recovery method has been also
introduced to reconstruct an active tree for delivering from a
source node by using back-up links [16]. However, it is unclear
which pairs of two nodes should be prepared for back-up links
in advance.
On the other hand, a self-healing method has been proposed
by establishing new random links on interdependent (two-
layered) networks of square lattices [17], and the effect against
node attacks is numerically studied. In particular, for adding
links by the healing process, the candidates of linked nodes
are incrementally extended from only the direct neighbors
of the removed node by attacks until no more separation of
components occurs. In other words, the whole connectivity
is maintained except the isolating removed parts (known as
induced sub-graphs for removed nodes in computer science).
Note that such an extension of the candidates of linked nodes
is a key idea in our proposed self-healing method as mentioned
later.
Furthermore, the following self-healing methods, whose
effects are investigated for some data of real networks, are
worthy to note. One is a distributed local repair in order of a
priority to the most damaged node [18]. In the repair by linking
from the most damaged node to a randomly chosen node from
the unremoved node set in its next-nearest neighbors before
attacks, the order of damaged nodes is according to the smaller
fraction kdam/korig of its remained degree kdam and the origi-
nal degree korig before the attacks. The selections are repeated
until reaching a given rate fs controlled by the fraction of
nodes whose kdam/korig exceeds a threshold. Another is a
bypass rewiring [19] on more limited resource of links (wire
cables, wireless communication or transportation lines between
two nodes) and ports (channels or plug sockets at a node). To
establish links between pair nodes, a node is randomly chosen
only one time in the neighbors of each removed node. When
ki denotes the degree of removed node i, only ⌊ki/2⌋ links are
reused. Note that a degree represents the number of using ports
at the node. In the bypass rewiring, reserved additional ports
are not necessary: they do not exceed the original one before
attacks. Moreover, greedy bypass rewiring [19] is proposed in
order to improve the robustness, the selection of pair nodes is
based on the number of the links not yet rewired and the size
of the neighboring components.
In computer science, ForgivingTree algorithm has been
proposed [20]. Under the repeated attacks, the following self-
healing is processed one-by-one after each node removal,
except when the removed node is a leaf (whose degree is one).
It is based on both distributed process of sending messages and
data structure, furthermore developed to an efﬁcient algorithm
called as compact routing [21]. In each rewiring process, a
removed node and its links are replaced by a binary tree.
Note that each vertex of the binary tree was the neighbors of
the removed node, whose links to the neighbors are reused
as the edges of the binary tree. Thus, additional links for
healing is unnecessary. It is remarkable for computation (e.g.,
in routing or information spreading) that the multiplicative
factor of diameter of the graph after healing is never more
than O(log kmax), where kmax is the maximum degree in the
original network, because of the replacing by binary trees.
However, the robustness of connectivity is not taken into
account in the limited rewiring based on binary trees, since a
tree structure is easily disconnected into subtrees by any attack
to the joint node. In other research, a recovery strategy with
resource allocation of bandwidth in a communication network
is discussed at several service levels from full to partial
with respect to what and how optimization [22], although
considering the link’s thickness (e.g., deﬁned by bandwidth
or transportation amounts) is out of our current scope.

The characteristics of resource allocation are summarized
in Table II for the above conventional and our proposed
methods, although there has been no discussion about resource
of links and ports. ForgivingTree or bypass rewiring methods
is not controllable but strongly depending on the reuse of all or
half links before attacks. We assume that some links emanated
from a removed node i can be reused for healing by local
rewiring between the neighbors. These links (cable lines) work

at the neighbor’s sides, even though they are disconnected
at the removed node’s side. As a control parameter in our
simulation, we set the reusable rate rh according to the
damage, on the assumption ki(1−rh) links do not work in the
removed node’s degree ki. In the two kinds of resource, we
consider that ports work independently from connection links,
as similar to a relation of airport runaway (or plug socket) and
ﬂight by airplane (or cable line). As one of the added values
from the conventional heuristic methods, we consider a new
design strategy by enhancing loops to improve the effect on
healing in the next section.

EFFECTIVE SELF-HEALING
A. Outline of Proposed Methods
We assume that almost simultaneously attacked nodes
are not recoverable immediately, therefore are removed from
the network function for a while. In case of emergency
for healing, unconnected two nodes are chosen and rewired
as the reconstruction assistance or reuse of links emanated
from removed qN nodes, when the fraction of attacks is q.
The healing process in each of the following 1), 2), and
3) is initiated just after detecting attacks and repeated by
Mh
def
= rh× ˜∑
i∈Dqki links. Here, ˜∑
i∈Dqki means the number
without multiple counts of lost links by attacks. Dq denotes
the set of removed nodes, |Dq| = qN. The key strategies
are 1) enhancing loops contributes to improve the robustness
[14][23], 2) forming a ring that encloses damaged parts is
able to maintain the connectivity on the edges of extended
neighbors, and 3) complementary effects of 1) and 2) in the
limited resource of Mh links. Any one of them is performed
as the healing process.
1)
Enhancing loops for smaller q0
j + q0
j′
To select two nodes in the neighbor nodes j, j′ ∈
∂i in the increasing order of q0
j +q0
j′ for all i ∈ Dq,
as shown in Figure 1.
2)
Extended ring
To make a ring of simple cycle without crossing,
the neighbors are extended from the ﬁrst damaged,
the second damaged, etc., to the last damaged area
in this order, as shown in Figure 2.
3)
Combination of extended ring & enhancing loops
for smaller q0
j + q0
j′
After using Mr ≤ ˜∑
i∈Dqki links for the ring,
if Mh > Mr, then the selections of two nodes in
the extended neighbors on ring are repeated in the
increasing order of q0
j + q0
j′ for Mh − Mr links.
Else a ring is incomplete and an open chain is
generated among the extended neighbors. In this
case, additional rewirings between the nodes j, j′
with smaller q0
j + q0
j′ are not performed due to
lack of links.
Enhancing loops is performed by applying the values of q0
i
(introduced in next subsection) for estimating Feedback Vertex
Set (FVS) whose nodes are necessary to form loops. Since a
node i with small q0
i belongs to a dangling subtree with high
probability, by connecting such nodes, it is expected that a new
loop on which a part of the subtree is included is added. From
left to right in Figure 1, the original red links emanated from
the removed node i (marked by ﬁlled circle) are reused as the
blue ones for the healing. When there is at least a path between
the nodes j and j′ in Figure 1, a new loop is created. Note
that the attacked node i is isolatedly removed as breakdown.
A ring is generated as follows. In Figure 2, the process is
initiated in order of removals of three nodes from left to right.
Filled and open circles denote removed and active nodes, red
and magenta lines denote removed and virtually added links,
respectively. From top left to top right in Figure 2, a red node
and its links are damaged, a ring formation around the 1st
removal node at the left is tried to the direct neighbors of
it. A green link is established, while virtual magenta links
are considered by sending messages to active neighbors. From
middle left to middle right in Figure 2, the ring formation
around the 2nd removal node at the center is tried again to
the neighbors which include the extended ones by the virtual
links. Light blue links are added, but virtual magenta links are
considered. From bottom left to bottom right in Figure 2, the
ring formation around the 3rd removal node at the right is tried
similarly. Finally, a ring is established by green, light blue, and
blue links. The connections between neighbors on a ring are
in random order except through the extension process.

B. Applying Belief Propagation Algorithm
We review the following approximation algorithm [24][25]
derived for estimating FVS known as NP-hard problem [12].
It is based on a cavity method in statistical physics in the
assumption that nodes j ∈ ∂i are mutually independent of

each other when node i is removed. The joint probability is
P\i(Aj : j ∈ ∂i) ≈ Πj∈∂iqAj
j→i by the product of independent
marginal probability qAj
j→i for the state Aj as the index of j’s
root. In the cavity graph, if all nodes j ∈ ∂i are either empty
(Aj = 0) or roots (Aj = j), the added node i can be a root
(Ai = i). There are the following exclusive states.
1)
Ai = 0: i is empty (removed). Since i is unnecessary
as a root, it belongs to FVS.
2)
Ai = i: i becomes its own root. The state Aj = j
of j ∈ ∂i is changeable to Aj = i when node i is
added.
3)
Ai = k: one node k ∈ ∂i becomes the root of i when
it is added, if k is occupied and all other j ∈ ∂i are
either empty or roots.

{q0

(1)-(6) in order of random permutation of the total N nodes.
The distributed calculations can be also considered.

We investigate them for Open Flight between airports and

N = 6474, M = 12572. The following results are averaged
over 10 samples with random process for tie-breaking in a
node selection or ordering of nodes on a ring.

by square) of extended ring and enhancing loops is superior
with higher ratio than the conventional simple local repair [18]
method (marked by circle) with a priority of rewirings to more
damaged nodes, whose healing works only for weak attacks in
small q. We remark that in our proposed combination method
the cases of rh ≥ 0.5 (overlapped orange and purple lines
marked by square) maintains the almost whole connectivity in
the surviving (1 − q)N nodes. In other words, the network
function can be revived completely, if more than half of links
emanated from removed nodes work. In rh ≤ 0.1 (green and
red lines marked by square), making a ring is unﬁnished,
the ratio is dropped. Moreover, since the ratio in Figure 4
is lower than the ratio marked by square in Figure 3, only
enhancing loops (marked by up-pointing triangle) or extended
ring (marked by down-pointing triangle) has weaker effect than
the combination. However, enhancing loops increase the ratio
of GC moderately in rh ≤ 0.1 for q ≤ 0.5 (green and red lines
marked by up-pointing triangle) in Figure 4.
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, our proposed combination
method (marked by square) has higher efﬁciency of paths
than the conventional simple local repair method (marked

On the other hand, we investigate the number of additional
ports which should be prepared in advance besides reusable
ports. It is reasonable to consider that the original ports at
neighbors of a removed node remain and can be reused at
undamaged locations, even if the links from the neighbors
are disconnected on the way. Thus, we assume that there
exist active ports of a node at least as many as its degree in
the original network before attacks. Note that the minimum,
average, and maximum degrees are kmin = 1, ⟨k⟩ = 10.77,
and kmax = 242 in Open Flight, kmin = 1, ⟨k⟩ = 3.88,

maximum number of reserved additional ports in our proposed
combination method. The number tends to be larger ranging
from a few to nearly 2kmax ∼ 3kmax, as the fraction q of
attacks and the reusable rate rh increase. Shown in parentheses
are averaged values over the nodes that require additional
ports in each network with healing. The averaged number of

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have proposed self-healing methods for reconstructing
a sustainable network by rewirings against attacks or disasters
in the meaning of resilience with adaptive capacity. The fun-
damental rewiring mechanisms are based on maintaining the
connectivity on a ring and enhancing loops for improving the
robustness by applying BP algorithm inspired from statistical
physics. As the resource allocation, the rewirings are controlled
by a parameter rh for reuse or addition of links between
the extended neighbors of attacked nodes. We have shown
that our proposed method is better than the conventional
simple local repair method [18] with a priority of rewirings
to more damaged nodes, although reserved additional ports
are required much more. In particular, the whole connectivity
can be revived with high efﬁciency of paths in our proposed
method, when more than half links emanated from attacked
nodes work. Thus, such amount of links are necessary for

sustaining network function. If there is lack of the resource,
the shortage parts should be compensated according to the
damages. Under the same resource, further improvement for
both connectivity and efﬁciency with fewer additional ports by
a modiﬁcation of the proposed healing method will be a future
work.
