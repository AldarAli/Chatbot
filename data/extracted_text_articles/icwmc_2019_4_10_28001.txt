Abstract—In this information age, large amount of data is
available online. These data are used by both internal and
external sources for analysis and research purposes. The collected
data is stored into huge data sets containing sensitive and
Non−Sensitive Attributes. For the reason that attributes are gen-
erally separated, the correlation between these various attributes
is lost. Thus, it will be necessary to prevent attributes from losing
the correlation between them or at least reduce the correlation
loss. As a solution, correlated attributes are grouped together.
Although, the data utility is preserved by reducing the correlation
loss between Sensitive Attributes, privacy protection remains a
serious concern. The main problem here is publishing data sets
without revealing the sensitive information of individuals and
in the same time preserving data utility. Most of the current
researches on ensuring privacy in big data are centered on data
anonymization. L-diversity is an anonymization technique that
can be applied on a data set with one or multiple Sensitive
Attributes. This paper proposes an algorithm that deals with
sensitive numerical and non−numerical attributes. The algorithm
applies the principle of -diversity technique after grouping highly
correlated attributes together through a vertical partitioning. Our
proposed algorithm makes a balance between privacy and data
utility.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the data collected by public and private
organizations are increasing every day and stored in electronic
repositories. The collected data includes various types of
attributes, especially sensitive ones [1]. Besides, Big data sets
can be used in different sectors, for example, biology, online
banking, medical research and so on [2]. However, more
challenges are rising since the collected data includes sensitive
information [1]. The ﬁrst challenge is preserving data utility.
Because each attribute is universally separated, the correlations
between different Sensitive Attributes are lost. This will be a
major problem when performing analysis about data utility [3].
Thus, we have to reduce the correlation loss between attributes
by grouping highly correlated attributes together. However,
even if the data utility is preserved by dividing the huge data
set into various data sets containing only highly correlated
attributes, the challenge of ensuring privacy remains a crucial
issue when sharing a data set that contains personal informa-
tion [4]. Current information technologies create vast amount
of data characterized by velocity, volume and veracity. So,
disseminating this data increases the possibility of violating the
privacy of individuals. That’s why privacy protection is consid-
ered as one of the most important issues in big data processing
[5]. In order to ensure privacy, data has to be sanitized and
the best way of sanitization is data anonymization. There are
several anonymization techniques treating Sensitive Attributes
in the literature, one of them is called ”-diversity” using
horizontal partitionning. The main idea behind ”-diversity” is
that the values of the Sensitive Attributes are well−represented
in each bucket [6]. In this paper, a new algorithm of data
anonymization is proposed. It is a variable distinct -diversity
algorithm applied on highly sensitive correlated attributes
whatever its type: numerical or non-numerical. The algorithm
makes a balance between data privacy and data utility. Besides,
it is divided into two main parts. The ﬁrst one is intended for
preserving data utility by grouping highly correlated attributes
together in several data sets. We used ”Pearson” correlation
tool to determine the highly correlated attributes. Although,
”Pearson” tool processes numerical values only, we used an
algorithm that converts non−numerical values into numerical
ones to process non−numerical attributes too. The second
part used the -diversity principle by splitting the data set
horizontally into buckets including distinct values in order
to ensure privacy. In this paper, we try to prove that the -
diversity principle must only be applied on data sets including
highly correlated attributes; otherwise, -diversity will not be
an effective anonymization technique.
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows: in
Section 2, we will make an overview of some works found in
literature using -diversity technique in order to ensure privacy
in big data. Next, in Section 3, we will present the proposed
technique including the algorithm. Later, in Section 4, we give
our experimental results applied on a part of a real data set.
Finally, we conclude our paper and give some perspectives in
Section 5.
II. RELATED WORK
Generally, -diversity technique aims to ensure privacy in
huge data sets. In most of cases, -diversity is applied on a
data set while the threshold  is ﬁxed to a speciﬁc value.
Besides, the degree of correlation between attributes is not
considered. For instance, Priyadarsini et al. in [7] proposed an
Enhanced -diversity algorithm able to diversify several Sen-
sitive Attributes without dividing the data set. The proposed
47

algorithm attempts to support multiple Sensitive Attributes for
-diversity by applying certain conditions to determine the size
of the bucket. Moreover, Priyadarsini et al. in [7] accommodate
the values corresponding to the sensitive categorical attributes
within each bucket by setting the value of the threshold  based
on the occurrence of distinct values in the whole column.
Besides, Sei et al. in [8] suggested a privacy model called
(1, ..., q)-diversity, which can deal with databases including
various sensitive Quasi-Identiﬁer (QI) attributes. The proposed
method in [8] does not make any modiﬁcations on the original
data set but adds various random values to each attribute in the
data set to realize (1, ..., q)-diversity. Therefore, the threshold
 is set to a ﬁxed value. Moreover, Oishi et al. in [4] presented
(, d)-semantic diversity algorithm considering the resemblance
of sensitive attribute values within each bucket by adding
distances to settle the problem of impossibility to satisfy
the threshold  of -diversity. The algorithm in [4] satisﬁes
-diversity through a method based on adding a Boolean
indicator to every sensitive attribute without generalizing the
Quasi-Identiﬁer attributes. Also, Gaoming et al. in [9] pro-
posed a (k, , θ)-diversity model based on clustering to reduce
information loss and increase the usefulness of data. The
algorithm in [9] takes as input three parameters, the thresholds
k and  correspond to k-anonymity and -diversity techniques
respectively and the parameter θ corresponds to the degree of
privacy preserving. Additionally, A new technique using the
principle of -diversity is presented by Y. Sei and Ohsuga in
[10], which randomizes the Sensitive Attributes belonging to
each individual. The method in [10] is divided into two parts;
the ﬁrst one concerns the data holder where −1 random values
are generated and added to a sensitive attribute in the whole
original data set. The second one concerns the data user where
the user has the possibility to identify the QI attributes that
should be analyzed based on the relation between QI attributes
and sensitive ones. Furthermore, Chakraborty et al. in [11]
proposed (α, ) and recursive (α, c, ) diversity techniques. Both
eigenvector centrality and noise node addition concepts are
used in the process in order to create an anonymized network.
In other sector, Tu et al. in [12] proposed a heuristic algorithm
in order to get an approximate solution. The algorithm meets
-diversity principle for protecting trajectory privacy through
speciﬁc generalization, while guaranteeing the smallest loss
of spatiotemporal granularity. Besides, R. Yogesh Kulkarni
and Murugan in [13] proposed an algorithm called, CPGEN
(C-mixture based Privacy GENetic algorithm) in order to
ensure privacy. The method in [13] combines the genetic
algorithm with C-mixture theory for privacy measurements.
The C-mixture is a new privacy measure, which integrates
various privacy constrains belonging to both k-anonymity
and -diversity principles. Moreover, Susan and Christopher
in [14] suggested an anonymization technique by combining
the advantages of anatomization, and an improved slicing
technique using both k-anonymity and -diversity principles
to treat high dimensional data sets, which include various
Sensitive Attributes. The anatomization approach reduces the
information loss and slicing algorithm preserves the correla-
tion and utility.
The main idea of this paper is inspired from the previous
works and we assume that -diversity principle has to be
applied only on highly correlated attributes in order to ensure
privacy and preserve utility. In the next section, we will present
our proposed technique including the algorithm that applies
the principle of -diversity on a data set containing attributes
having strong correlation between them.
III. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE AND SOME RELATED
CONCEPTS
Our proposed technique ensures privacy by applying -
diversity principle on highly correlated attributes. Besides, the
technique preserves data utility by grouping every two highly
correlated attributes in a data set.
A. L-diversity and Correlation
1) Correlation analysis: With data analysis techniques,
precious information could be extracted from big data. In
data analysis, big data technologies includes data mining,
machine learning and correlation analysis [15]. Correlation
is a well-known mathematical and statistical method for
analyzing the compatibility of huge data sets [15]. Since
each attribute is generally separated and thus distinguishable,
the correlation between various attributes is lost. This is
considered as an inherent issue to make efﬁcient analysis of
attribute correlations [3]. In order to reduce the correlation
loss, a partitioning approach is proposed in [16] based on
the lexicographic and Non-Sensitive Attributes (NSAs) sorted
by correlation between NSAs and Sensitive Attributes (SA).
Besides, this approach preserves the published data utility
[16]. Authors in [3], [16]–[18] used vertical partitioning by
grouping attributes into columns according to the correlations
existing between these attributes where only highly corre-
lated ones are grouped into columns. The main idea is to
break the association between columns while preserving the
relationship within each column [3] and [17]. The fact of
grouping highly correlated attributes together minimizes the
high dimensionality of the data set [17] and [18], moreover, it
preserves better utility than generalization and bucketization
approaches [17]. Besides, as mentioned in [3], [14], [17],
[18], slicing technique preserves data utility because highly
correlated attributes are grouped together while conserving
the correlations between such attributes. The evaluation of the
correlations between the pairs of attributes could be realized
through several correlation tools depending on the type of the
treated attributes. For instance, Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
is utilized to evaluate the correlation between two continuous
attributes [18], whereas mean-square contingency coefﬁcient
is a ch-square measure of correlation between two categorical
attributes [16] and [18].
In this paper, we used Pearson tool to identify the highly
correlated attributes whether they are numerical or not. In
the case we have non-numerical attributes in the data set; we
convert non numerical values into numerical ones through a
proposed converting algorithm. The algorithm gives the same
48

number to similar values in the data set. This conversion will
give us the opportunity to process different types of data. The
Pearson correlation tool is used to calculate the degree of linear
correlation between two numerical attributes through 1 [19].

and ¯y= the mean of y variable.
The correlation here is the sum of the multiplication be-
tween corresponding numbers related to the treated attributes.
Besides, the resulting correlation values are in the range
[−1.0, +1.0]. After calculation Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
for all the pairs of attributes existing in the data set, we identify
those corresponding to the highest value in order to apply
the -diversity principle on a data set containing only highly
correlated attributes.
2) L-diversity principle: Most of anonymization techniques
existing in the literature are applied before publishing the
data set [20]. Some of these techniques deal with quasi
identiﬁer attributes and others deal with sensitive ones. In this
paper, a technique using the principle of distinct -diversity
is suggested dealing with Sensitive Attributes. Besides, the
proposed variable -diversity technique doesn’t take into con-
sideration any prior value of the threshold . Furthermore,
the principle of -diversity has been introduced to improve
traditional data mining that preserves privacy. -diversity is
considered as an important technique in privacy protection
[21]. L-diversity is a group based form of anonymization used
to ensure privacy in huge data sets by minimizing the huge
scale of big data in term of representation [21]. The -diversity
model (Distinct, Entropy, Recursive) is an extension of the k-
anonymity technique, which deal with QI attributes [22] and
[23]. L-diversity ensures that an adversary needs  − 1 values
using background knowledge to deduce  − 1 possible values
of a sensitive attribute in order to violate privacy [9] and [24].
In other words, an equivalence class (EC), also called bucket
is deemed to satisfy -diversity if there are at least  ”well-
represented” values related to the treated Sensitive Attributes
(SAs) [6], [24], [25]. Then, the whole data set is deemed to
satisfy -diversity when every bucket existing in that data set
satisﬁes -diversity [24] and [25]. Moreover, -diversity helps to
mitigate both homogeneity and background knowledge attacks
[22] and [25]. Existing methods for -diversity only take into
consideration  ”well represent” sensitive values. However,
they omit the size of every bucket in the data set. Thus, the loss
of information in the published data sets is much larger, which
lead to a decrease concerning the data utility [9]. Our proposed
algorithm applies the principle of distinct -diversity without a
prior value of the threshold ””. That means that the value of 
is not ﬁxed, so there is an opportunity to maximize this value
in order to ensure privacy as much as possible. In the next
part of this section, we will present our proposed algorithm,
which applies the principle of variable distinct -diversity on
highly correlated attributes.

Our algorithm is divided into two parts. The ﬁrst one
identiﬁes the two highly correlated attributes among all the
attributes in the Original Table. The second one presents the
process of applying -diversity principle. The anonymization
process is applied on a Table containing N tuples and L
attributes. The attributes are the ﬁelds of a structure.
In the ﬁrst part, from line 6 to line 22 in the algorithm, the
identiﬁcation of the two highly correlated attributes is realized
through a correlation tool called ”Pearson”. Since the data
set could contain both numerical and non-numerical attributes
and also Pearson tool processes only numerical attributes, we
convert non-numerical attributes into numerical ones. Then,
we calculate the correlation coefﬁcient between every two
attributes p in the Original Table. After that, we save the
49

indexes nd and ndj of the attributes corresponding to the
highest correlation coefﬁcient hc.
In the second part, from line 23 to line 48 in the algorithm,
we apply -diversity on the two attributes, which have the
highest correlation. We start by identifying the distinct values
corresponding to the ﬁrst attribute, then, we put these tuples in
D1 Table, the remaining tuples are put in RT Table. However,
Table D1 may still contain non distinct values with respect to
the second attribute. Then, we copy distinct tuples in Table
D1 with respect to the second attribute in Table D2, besides,
we add the remaining tuples in D1 to RT Table. Thus, D2
is the -diversity Table with distinct values with respect to
both highly correlated attributes. Once the process ends, we
clear the Original Table and we copy the content of RT Table
in the original table and we repeat the process of -diversity
until RT Table is empty. The complexity of the anonymization
part of the algorithm is of the order of N2∗NbBckets where
NbBckets is the number of buckets existing in the data set
and N is the number of tuples in the same data set. Therefore,
when we analyse the bloc ”repeat-until”, we ﬁnd that there are
two loops inside. The ﬁrst while loop processes NbBckets
operations because we identify distinct values corresponding
to the ﬁrst attribute in the OrgnTbe. Later, in the second
while loop we identify distinct values corresponding to the
second attribute based on the result table of the previous loop.
Then, we analyse the ”repeat-until” bloc and according to
the algorithm, we notice that the process is repeated N times,
which is the number of lines in the OrgnTbe.
In the next section, we will highlight the different steps of
the proposed algorithm applied on a part of real data set.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Now, we will implement our algorithm on a test table related
to health sector. We have developed our algorithm with Java
tool. Table I is a part of a real data set called ”careplans” [26],
which contains several attributes like ”Disease”, ”Treatment”,
”Date of diagnosis” and ”Cure date”. I mention that I have
randomly selected 9 tupes from the ”careplans” real data set.

After converting non numerical values, we calculate the
correlation between every two attributes in the data set. First,
we calculate the correlation between ”Disease” attribute and
the other attributes in the data set. In the following, we give
the corresponding Pearson correlation coefﬁcients:
r(Dsese, Tretment) = 0.8431
r(Dsese, Dte oƒ dgnoss) = 0.5103
r(Dsese, Cre dte) = 0.5103
The correlation between ”Disease” and ”Treatment” at-
tributes is strong and positive. However, there is a moderate
positive correlation between ”Disease” and ”Date of diagno-
sis”, the same moderate correlation is between ”Disease” and
”Cure date” attributes.
The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between ”Disease” and
”Treatment” equals 0.8431, which is the highest value among
the three correlation values calculated between ”Disease”
attribute and the other attributes in the data set. The -diversity
principle will be applied on a part of Table I, which contains
only ”Disease” and ”Treatment” attributes.
Second, we calculate the correlation between ”Treatment”,
”Date of diagnosis” and ”Cure date” attributes. Here are the
values of the calculated Pearson correlation coefﬁcients:
r(Tretment, Dte oƒ dgnoss) = 0.3983
r(Tretment, Cre dte) = 0.3983
We remark that the correlation value between ”Treatment”
and ”Date of diagnosis” attributes equals the correlation value
between ”Treatment” and ”Cure date”. The relationship be-
tween the attributes is weak because the correlation value is
near zero value.
Finally, we calculate the correlation between the last two
attributes ”Date of diagnosis” and ”Cure date”.
r(Dte oƒ dgnoss, Cre dte) = 1
The calculation of Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between
”Date of diagnosis” and ”Cure date” gives a value of 1, which

means that there is a strong positive correlation between these
two attributes.
Now, we will process by applying 1-diversity on Table I
with respect to ”Disease” and ”Treatment” attributes corre-
sponding to the highest value of Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
(0.8431).
We are going to highlight through different tables the
whole steps until we obtain an anonymized table satisfying
1-diversity. Table III represents Bucket 1 where all the tuples
contain distinct values when treating both ”Disease” and
”Treatment” attributes.

In the ﬁrst step, we collect the distinct values from ”Treat-
ment” attribute column, which are ”Recommendation to rest”,
”Musculoskeletal care”, ”Healthy diet” and ”Ice therapy”.
Then, we put in Bucket 1 the tuples corresponding to the
already mentioned distinct values with ascendant order. We
can see that ”Recommendation to rest” and ”Musculoskeletal
care” values correspond to ”Whiplash injury to neck” value,
then we will retain only ”Recommendation to rest” attribute
because it is the ﬁrst value in the order. However, ”Healthy
diet” and ”Ice therapy” correspond to distinct values, which
are ”Gout” and ”Rheumatoid arthritis” values. Then, we obtain
the ﬁrst bucket satisfying 1-diversity as mentioned in Table III.
In the next step, we put the remaining tuples from Table I in
another table called Rest of table RT 1.

Table IV is called RT 1; it contains tuples other than those
existing in Bucket . This table takes the place of the Original

all of them containing distinct values. And here we obtain 3
buckets satisfying -diversity.

We notice that we will reapply all the steps of -diversity
algorithm on a Table containing ”Date of diagnosis” and ”Cure
date” attributes since there is a strong correlation between
them.
Since Tables III, V and VI satisfy the principle of distinct
-diversity, we could say that Table VII satisﬁes distinct -
diversity too. Besides, we remark that at least there exist
three tuples within each bucket in Table VII. Consequently,
the resulting table after the anonymization process is called
3-diversity table.
V. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
This paper presents a new approach for data anonymization.
The approach focuses on anonymizing data sets while preserv-
ing the data utility. First, we applied a conversion process on
values in the data set by transforming non-numerical values
into numerical ones. After that, we grouped the pairs of
attributes with the highest correlation together into several
data sets through the calculation of Pearson correlation coef-
ﬁcient. Consequently, the data utility is preserved by reducing
the correlation loss between the grouped highly correlated
attributes. Later and in order to ensure privacy, we apply

a variable distinct -diversity on highly correlated attributes
algorithm throughout a horizontal partitioning until treating
all the buckets in data set. Besides, our proposed algorithm
makes a balance between privacy and data utility. As a
perspective, we plan to compare our proposed technique with
other anonymization techniques existing in the literature. In
addition, we will test our algorithm on the large real data set
”Careplans”. Moreover, we plan to deal also with QI attributes
by applying k-anonymity technique instead of -diversity one.
