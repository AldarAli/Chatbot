 INTRODUCTION 
In ophthalmology, restoration of the accommodation 
ability of the human eye is still an unsolved problem. The 
process of accommodation means the adjustment of the 
refraction power of the human eye with respect to the object 
distance. The loss of the ability to accommodate is due to an 
aging process of the human eye leading to a stiffening of the 
lens. 
Different 
approaches 
for 
restoration 
of 
the 
accommodation ability are currently under discussion [1]- 
[4], but none of them solves the problem in its entirety [5].  
The concept of the Artificial Accommodation System 
(AAS) follows a mechatronic approach and will be 
implantable into the capsular bag of the human eye [6]. The 
following components represent the functional units of the 
AAS: 
 
An active optical subsystem, 
 
an information acquisition system, 
 
an information processing system, 
 
a communication unit, 
 
housing, and 
 
an energy supply system.  
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the AAS 
[7]. There are depicted the main components and the position 
of the implanted system within the capsular bag of the 
human eye. A demonstration model of such an implant 
solution was designed and realized at a scale of 2:1 [8]. 
The active optical subsystem is of vital importance to the 
implant since the optical performance of the AAS depends 
on its reliable function.  
The article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the 
active optical subsystem of the AAS with all its components. 
Section 3 covers the set-up of the demonstration model and 
shows exemplarily its mode of action. The paper is 
completed by the conclusions drawn in Section 4. 
 
II. 
THE ACTIVE OPTICAL SUBSYSTEM 
The three principal components of the active optical 
subsystem are presented and discussed in the following 
subsections.  
A. Optics 
Figure 2 shows a sketch of the optical components used 
in the demonstration model of the ophthalmic implant. The 
ray path is from left to right. The AAS features a modular 
concept, where the housing as well as optical surfaces 
integrated in the housing will be used for different optical 
principles. Originally, the housing was designed for an 
optical subsystem using an axially moveable lens to adjust 
refraction power [9]. Hence, the optics integrated in the 
housing are negative aspheric lenses. The first lens integrated 
in the housing is for beam expansion, the second lens 
integrated in the housing has the task to focus the rays on the 
retina (or camera chip in case of the demonstration model). 
Both optics are described by aspheric surfaces [7]. 
Manufacturing of the housing with its integrated optics 
was realized using a precision glass molding process. The 
influences of the manufacturing tolerances were analyzed by 
measuring the molded surfaces and a subsequent integration 
of the measured data into the optical simulation model [10].

The task of the varifocal optics inside the housing 
(between the optics integrated in the housing) is to adjust the 
refraction power due to the visual requirements. One optical 
concept, which can be used as varifocal optics is the 
principle invented by Alvarez and Humphrey in 1970 [11]. 
According to this principle, the refraction power is varied by 
a mutual shift of two cubic-type lens parts perpendicular to 
the optical axis as shown in Figure 3. To combine the above 
described housing design with this varifocal concept, an 
aspherical inset lens has to be designed to add a positive 
refraction power to the negative lens of the rear side (see 
Figure 2) [7]. 
 
Figure 3.  Alvarez-Humphrey optics. 
Alvarez-Humphrey optics were studied extensively [12–
14] and proposed for different technical [15]–[17] as well as 
ophthalmic applications [18], [19]. The opposing surfaces 
are conjugated and of cubic shape. Design parameters of the 
Alvarez-Humphrey (AH) lenses are the lateral movement v 
of the lens parts and the “form” parameter A determining the 
shape of the lens surface. The polynomial description of the 
surface sag is given by (1): 
z(x,y) = A((y − v)x2 + 1/3(y − v)3). 
  (1) 
The relation between the lateral movement v and the change 
of refraction power ΔD is given by (2) [20]: 
ΔD~A v. 
  (2) 
Adjustment of the refraction power by means of a lateral 
shift of lens parts is advantageous in all applications where 
the space available along the optical axis is limited, as is true 
for the demonstration model at hand. Requirements of the 
optics and its design are presented in [21]. To compensate 
for aberration effects as well as for manufacturing tolerances 
a comprehensive design approach was used [22] resulting in 
a robust freeform surface of the AH optics, which is 
represented by a polynomial of seventh order using 35 
parameters [7]. Also the robust design of the AH optics 
results in two different descriptions of the opposing freeform 
surfaces violating the conjugation of the original AH concept. 
The AH optics was manufactured by two competing 
processes: 
ultraprecision 
diamond 
machining 
and  
microinjection molding. While diamond machining is 
suitable only for small series fabrication microinjection 
molding is a replication process with the potential of mass 
fabrication [23, 24].  For both processes the effect of 
manufacturing tolerances on the performance of the optical 
subsystem was analysed and compared against each other by 
simulations based on a measurement data enhanced model 
[25]. 
B. Actuator 
As described above, design parameters of the AH optics 
are the lateral mutual shift of the lens parts, v, as well as the 
form parameter A. To preserve a constant ΔD a reduction of 
v, which is requested to minimize the actuation stroke, leads 
evidently to a higher value of A (see (2)), which in turn 
significantly increases aberration effects and hence limits 
imaging quality. As a trade-off a maximum mutual shift of 
the lens parts of 180 µm with an actuator rest position at 40 
µm displacement allows for a change of 4.6 dpt in optical 
power and was found to be a reasonable compromise for the 
demonstration model [26]. 
The requirements of the actuator with respect to cycle 
lifetime, power consumption, fail-safe behavior, response 
time, and space can be found in [26]. As the final actuator for 
the demonstration model a piezoelectric stack actuator 
(Noliac A/S, NAC2001-H06, Noliac, Kvistgaard, Denmark) 
was chosen. This actuator offers a nominal stroke of 4.9 µm 
of which a maximum of 2.9 µm is used during operation [27]. 
C. Amplification linkage 
To provide a maximum lateral shift of a lens part of 140 
µm (resulting in a displacement of the lens part of 180 µm on 
basis of the actuator rest position of 40 µm) an amplification 
ratio of around 48 of the maximum actuator stroke of 2.9 µm 
is required. For reasons of miniaturization and reduction of 
assembly processes, a monolithic design with flexure hinges 
was selected. The planarity of the linkage enables a Deep 
Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) process for fabrication of the 
linkage in single-crystal silicon [26]. Figure 4 shows the 
linkage manufactured by DRIE fulfilling the transmission 
requirements [26]. The opening in the upper part of the 
linkage is the host structure for the piezoelectric stack 
actuator. The lens parts are to be assembled into the round 
mounts in the middle of the linkage. Minimum structure

widths of about 24 µm were realized by means of the DRIE-
process. The linkage is enclosed by a solid frame serving 
both as interface to the subsystem mount and as handling 
frame during system assembly.

III. 
SET-UP OF THE ACTIVE OPTICAL SUBSYSTEM 
Assembly of the AH optics, the actuator, and the silicon 
linkage yields the varifocal optics. Figure 5 depicts two 
photographs of the varifocal optics in two different actuation 
states. On the left hand side, the piezo stack actuator is 
expanded. The expansion leads to a mutual outward shift of 
both lens parts and therefore to a relative decrease in 
refraction power of the optics. On the right of Figure 5 the 
contraction of the actuator is shown leading to an inward 
movement of the lens parts and an increase of the optics’ 
refraction power. This effect is visible comparing the grid 
size in the image: while reducing the refraction power the 
grid size of the image scales down (Figure 5, left) compared 
to an increase of refraction power as shown in Figure 5 on 
the right hand side. 
As described in Section 2, the optical subsystem consists 
of the varifocal optics assembled in a housing where both the 
entrance and exit windows provide optical power by means 
of curved optical surfaces integrated in the housing. Since 
the AAS features a modular concept where varifocal optics 
of different kind can be exchanged the optics integrated in 
the housing have to be adapted to the optics used.  
Combining the negative rear-side optics with an AH optics, 
an aspherical inset lens has to be designed to add a positive 
refraction power to the negative lens of the rear side. The 
exact description of the optics integrated in the housing and 
the aspheric inset lens can be found in [7]. Figure 6 shows 
the varifocal optics assembled on its mount in the rear half 
shell of the glass housing. 
 
 
 
Figure 6.  Varifocal optics assembled to the rear half shell of the glass 
housing. 
The active optical subsystem combined with a sensor 
cross and electronics for control, information acquisition & 
processing, and communication is depicted in Figure 7. The 
sensor cross of the demonstration model consists of 
photodiodes and is segmented:  
 
The central segment is for measurement of the 
environmental luminance. 
 
Two outer segments are for measurement of the 
pupil diameter. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
these 
two 
measurands 
the 
accommodation demand and hence the adjustment of the 
refraction power can be derived [5]. 
Mode of action of the active optical subsystem is shown 
in Figure 8 for two different adjustments of the system’s 
refraction power. On top of Figure 8 a concentric pattern at a 
distance of approximately 3 m is imaged sharply on a camera 
chip while the pen in the foreground is out of focus and is 
imaged only blurred. Readjusting the varifocal optics for the 
near sight images the pen at a distance of approximately 
0.3 m sharply while the image of the concentric pattern 
appears blurred.

CONCLUSIONS 
Restoration of the accommodation ability of the human 
eye is still an unsolved problem. One possible approach is to 
replace the presbyopic human crystalline lens by a 
mechatronic implant. One key component of such a 
mechatronic implant would be the active optical subsystem 
consisting of varifocal optics and a tailored actuation 
principle. As varifocal optics an Alvarez-Humphrey optics is 
presented, which is able to adjust the refraction power by a 
mutual shift of two freeform lens components perpendicular 
to the optical axis. For designing freeform optics, the robust 
design approach is essential [28] consisting of monolithic 
integration principles to minimize assembly efforts as well as 
an optimization of the functional components with respect to 
robustness against remaining assembly and manufacturing 
tolerances.  
Actuation is conducted by a piezoelectric stack actuator 
while a silicon linkage provides the necessary displacement 
amplification. The result leads to a robust design of the 
active optical subsystem, which is integrated in a 
demonstration model at a scale of 2:1. A first impression of 
the mode of action of the demonstration model is shown for 
imaging objects in two different distances.
