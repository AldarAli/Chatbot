Abstract—Real-word entities can be mapped to unique
entity identiﬁers through an Entity Name System (ENS),
to systematically support the re-use of these identiﬁers and
disambiguate references to real world entities in the Web.
An entity subscription service informs subscribed users of
changes in the descriptive data of an entity, which is a set
of free-form attribute name-value pairs. We study the design,
implementation and application of an adaptable, push-policy
subscription service, within a large-scale ENS. The subscription
system aims to deliver ranked descriptions of the changes
on entities, following user preferences through a feedback-
driven adaptation process. Within this paper, we offer a novel
approach based on the discrimination between the content
(descriptive aspect) and the type (directly quantiﬁable or binary
aspects) of information instances (i.e., entity changes in our
case). We study and evaluate two different approaches of
adaptation to user interests: one that only manages constant
user preferences and one that adapts to interest shifts of the
users. We evaluate the learning curve of the variations of
the system, the utility of the content-type discrimination, as
well as the effectiveness of modeling user behavior for random
interest shifts of the user. The experiments demonstrate good
results, especially in the system’s content-aware adaptation
aspect, which takes into account user interest shifts. We also
extract a set of useful conclusions concerning the detection of
user interest shifts, based on feedback, as well as the relation
between the user interest shift frequency and the optimality of
learning memory window size.
I. INTRODUCTION
An Entity Name System (ENS) [2], [3], [4] is a system
that aims to handle the process of assigning and managing
identiﬁers for entities (e.g., people, locations) in the World
Wide Web (WWW). These identiﬁers are global, with the
purpose of consistently identifying a speciﬁc entity across
system boundaries, regardless of the place in which refer-
ences to this entity may appear.
In the ENS we are interested in the minimal amount of
information based on which we are able to uniquely identify
each entity in the system. This information is imported both
automatically or manually to the system, but its update
is based mostly on collaborative effort — which is also
apparent, e.g., in Wikipedia.
The volume and volatility of the data contained within
the ENS offer a challenge concerning both the maintenance
and accessibility of the information. The maintenance of the
entity data would be a rather expensive and cumbersome
task, was it not designed as a joined effort with the ENS
user-community. By relying on the collective wisdom and
collaboration of users, we aim to induce and use their
feedback in order to achieve high data quality. The premise is
that users will be willing to “adopt” some entities, and make
sure that their descriptions in the ENS are always accurate.
In support of this functionality, we are proposing and
describing the adaptive aspect of an Adaptive Entity Sub-
scription System, which allows a user to subscribe to entities
of interest (e.g., one’s own entity, or entity of one’s home
town) and get informed about changes on these entities.
The subscription system helps clients follow the changes
of entities in the ENS at the time they occur through
asynchronous messages (e.g., via e-mail).
The personalized aspect of AESS takes into account what
kinds of change are interesting for a given subscription
client. The system ranks the information on changes in every
sent message, according to user preferences. It further adapts
to the individual use-patterns of each client and to user
interest shifts, based on the information of the feedback. The
aim is that the information ﬂow to the user remains aligned
to user interest. This kind of personalization provides ease
of use and enhances the user’s experience and interaction
with the system, thus facilitating the update of and access
to ENS data.
In the following paragraphs we elaborate on ENS and the
subscription service notions to deﬁne clearly the setting of
our study.
A. The Entity Name System
The ENS has a (distributed and replicated) repository
for storing entity identiﬁers along with some small amount
of descriptive information for each entity. The purpose
of storing this information is to use it for discriminating
among entities, not exhaustively describing them. Entities
are described by a number of attribute-value pairs, where
the attribute names and the potential values are user-deﬁned
(arbitrary) strings.

The ENS supports, through an Access Services layer, the
search for an entity or the update of entities. The search
allows the ENS clients to identify an entity based on cross-
validated and updated data. Updates on the entities of the
ENS repository can be performed either by inserting a new
entity in the system or by changing some of the attributes
of an existing entity. System administrators can even merge,
split or delete entities.
Figure 1.
Schematic of the ENS and its interactions.
As shown in Figure 1, the end result is that all instances
of the same entity (i.e., mentioned in different systems,
ontologies, web pages, etc.) are assigned the same identiﬁer.
Therefore, joining these documents and merging their infor-
mation becomes a much more simple and effective process
than before.
Within this context, a client can be interested in receiving
information on changes on the identifying information of a
speciﬁc entity in the ENS. To this end, a client can subscribe
to entities that are of some interest and get informed about
changes on those entities. This subscription-based informa-
tion service is described in the next paragraphs.
B. The Subscription Service
The administration and checking of entity information is a
difﬁcult task in itself, considering the scalability of an ENS.
To alleviate the burden of such a task and to handle the
information need of non-administration clients, we propose
the use of a change subscription system.
The change subscription system helps clients follow the
changes of entities in the ENS in the time they occur.
The subscription system informs users through asynchronous
messages (e.g., via e-mail) on sets of changes concerning
entities the users have selected. Examples of subscription
include subscribing to changes of the “current population”
attribute of one’s home town, or of the “phone” attribute of
a former colleague.
The system we propose ranks the information on changes
in the sent message according to user preferences on what is
important, and is able to adapt to the individual use-patterns
of each client. This ranking is based on a user model, which
is created through machine learning and a feedback-based
user modeling methodology. The system we propose further
adapts to user interest shifts, based on the information of
the feedback.
Within this work, we further study the relation between
size of the system’s memory window — which takes into
account the last k instances of user feedback to create the
user model — and the performance of the system. We
conclude that:
• The performance of the system is highly correlated to
the average frequency of user interest shifts.
• There exists a near-optimal operation range for the
window memory size parameter, which is computed
based on the estimated interest shift frequency.
The experimental results show that the proposed approach
can successfully adapt to usage patterns, delivering to each
user change notiﬁcations ranked according to one’s interest.
Note that we use ENS as a concrete example for ease
of exposition, but our techniques can be applied to any
adaptation process, where there are data that are hybrid in
nature, i.e., they can be represented by a vector and a string
representation of content.
In the following sections, we present related work (Section
II), we deﬁne the problem tackled herein (Section III) and
elaborate on our proposed methodology (Section III-A).
Then, we present the performed experiments (Section V),
followed by related work (Section II). We then conclude
and present future work (Section VI).
II. RELATED WORK
User-modeling has been used for several years (e.g., [5])
and applied to a variety of settings, from information re-
trieval [6] to ﬁltering tasks [7], [8] and recommendations [9].
In this work, the information retrieved is deﬁned a priori
and is always sent to the user without any ﬁltering, because
the user is subscribed to speciﬁc entities. However, what is
considered unimportant based on estimation of importance
can easily be discarded, if needed, providing a ﬁltering
mechanism.
Feedback-based approaches have been proposed in infor-
mation retrieval since the early 1970’s [10]. These feed-
back methodologies have relied both on the vector space
model [11], [6] or Bayesian modeling [12] to represent user
needs. Our method is a content-based method, as far as the
content vs. collaborative [13] perspective of the system is
concerned. The novelty of our work lies in the fact that
we express information instances taking into account their
dual nature: type and content. For us, the type represents the
297

directly quantiﬁable (or simply binary) aspects of a piece
of information, e.g., the number of words of a text, or
whether a car is blue or not. The type of our instances,
which are pieces of change information, is identiﬁed by
vector features engineered for entity change subscription.
The content represents the descriptive part of a piece of
information, e.g., the name of a person, or the content of
a web page. To represent what we deﬁne as content, we
use an intermediate representation: the n-gram graph, which
takes into account fuzzy matching of strings1. However,
our methodology allows any kind of similarity metric to be
applied between the content part of any two information
instances. The function of similarity allows to add the
content as a set of new dimensions to the feature space
describing a change. Therefore, the representation of the user
model is different in semantics from the representation used
in most of the other approaches, because of the intermediate
representation of the n-gram graphs.
Within this work we use incremental, explicit user feed-
back. Incremental feedback has been used in retrieval
tasks [15] and in the context that we are applying it, which
is actually a push-based information ﬂow, it is the most
appropriate approach. However, in our case there are no user
queries to improve, like for example in [16], because the
information delivered to the user is based on the changes of
entities pre-selected by the user. There is also no relevant
document set that we can use to expand our knowledge,
in contrast to retrieval tasks. Therefore, we only take into
account the user’s history of feedback to corresponding
instances. We take into account individual user needs and
not “canonical” (i.e., group or community) user needs [5],
[17].
Our adaptive subscription service aims to rank the in-
formation retrieved. Ranking has been in the user model-
ing community since the 90’s [18] and has given rise to
the recommender systems domain (see [13] for a survey).
In this work, the ranking of information is treated as a
regression problem, based on a mapping of qualitatively
described user interest to real values (similar to the notion
of utility [13]), so as to be genericly applicable. However,
we do not search for a function PREF(u, v) that indicates
the certainty of whether u should be ranked before that
v, as, e.g., is described in [18]: the ranking in our case
comes as an emergent result of the regression method. Our
approach evaluation takes into account cases where the user
considers instances equally important, because we estimate
error in a way that accounts for acceptable error in the
regression. A base difference that exists between our system
and recommender systems is that we only need to rank
pieces of information that are designated by the subscrip-
tion of the user; we do not recommend new information
1The n-gram graphs can actually represent any type of information
where neighbourhood can be deﬁned between the features of a represented
instance. For more details, see [14].
instances, relative to user preferences as is the case in some
recommender systems [19], nor are we interested in popular
recommendations, as in [20].
The importance of term coexistence as a model for user
preferences in content ﬁltering, as well as the ability of the
system to adapt to user shifts, has also been studied through
an analogy to the immune system in Nootopia [21]. There, a
network (or graph) representation of terms, as well as their
coexistence in interesting content, form the representation
of what we consider the content of user preferences. The
terms, represented as weighted nodes of the network, are
connected through a weighted edge, if they appear in a
given window of words within a text. The weights on the
edges are a function of the frequency and distance of co-
occurence of the connected terms. In Nootopia however,
the interesting — non-interesting distinction is performed
through a self-organizing model, that rejects unimportant
pieces of information, which does not allow several levels
of interest. Furthermore, the system uses whole words as the
basic unit of analysis, whereas we use sub-word items. The
advantage of the sub-word items is that one can decide on
similarity between different word forms, without the need
of preprocessing like stemming, lemmatization, etc. The
process of checking against the preference graph in Nootopia
is performed through a network activation process, which
increases complexity, when compared to our Normalized
Value Similarity algorithm. Finally, we take into account
other aspects of the preference, represented as the type
portion of the change and the ﬁnal estimation of the graded
interest is estimated in the vector space and not the space
of graphs.
In this work, we also study the effect of “memory”
window, i.e., the number of remembered feedback instances,
to the performance of the system, also in the presence of
user interest shifts. Contrary to [15], in the presence of user
interest shift, taking into account only a limited number
of feedback instances does better than using all available
feedback data, because an interest shift can heavily alter the
estimator function’s efﬁcacy. Our study indicates that there
seems to be a steady functional relation that exists between
the user expected interest shift and the memory window, in
order to achieve near-optimal results. A highly related study,
even in a similar task, has been performed in [22]. However,
we do not use classes of documents to relate the user to
class-based interest, as done in [22], and we do not use a
binary decision of correctness as feedback. Furthermore, our
information instances, i.e., changes, have some dimensions
concerning their type and the model of the content is not
based on bag-of-words. Finally, we do not study how to
detect an interest shift, but the relation between an estimated
interest shift frequency and the “memory” window. The
detection of the interest shift can use any method from
time-series analysis or any probabilistic model (e.g., Hidden
Markov Model), but is not the focus of this work.

In the next section we formulate the problem of adaptive
subscription as a problem of interest estimation, based on
user-feedback.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
The subscription service is a supplement to the usability
of the ENS, tackling the problem of keeping consumers of
information concerning speciﬁc entities updated. The system
disseminates information to consumers2 about changes on
entities to which the consumers have subscribed.
The sending of information can be either synchronous,
based on the time a change takes place, or asynchronous.
Furthermore, the update can be sent for every individual
change or for a set of changes, e.g., periodically per day.
In our case we use an asynchronous model for the update,
that takes place periodically and contains all the information
the user has subscribed to. It should be noted that a user
subscribes to an entity, which in turns implicitly deﬁnes the
set of changes that will reach the user.
It is clear that a subscription service for changes on enti-
ties is not very different from any other kind of subscription
service. Nevertheless, the attributes of the information on
changes partially deﬁne the adaptive approach we present
within this work (see Section IV-A). As we elaborate later in
this article, changes can have various degrees of importance,
based on their type. For example, a “delete” change can be
more important than an “insert” change (also see Section
IV-A). Then, the content of a change is a completely
different aspect from its type. We consider the content of
the change to be the difference between the attributes of the
original state of an entity and the attributes of the new state.
We argue that this content can provide more information
than the type of the change alone (also see Section V).
A. Subscription Feedback and Adaptive Content Ranking
The problem we tackle within this work is bringing the
information on changes to consumers, in such a way that will
best suit individual consumers’ needs. The main scenario
we face wants a user-consumer to have subscribed to a
set of entities from the ENS, in order to get informed
about changes in these entities. However, each user may
be interested in different kinds of changes. This problem
needs an adaptable system to support the modeling and
application of user needs and preferences. The system we
propose is aware of user feedback in order to improve the
users’ experience and optimize the ﬂow of information to
each individual user.
The problem can be formalized as follows:
Given
• a set of users, i.e., user models U
2The terms client, user and consumer will be used interchangeably
throughout the text.
• a set of change descriptions D = {< T, C >, T ∈
T, C ∈ C} of type T and content C, where T is the
set of possible types and C the set of possible contents
• a set of feedback indications F = {< U, D, I >
, U ∈ U, D ∈ D, I ∈ I}, where I a set of importance
indicators, either categorical (nominal-scale) or real
we need the system to optimize the estimation function
of importance for a new description of a change Dn,
f(U, Dn|F) : U × D → I, for our criterion J (described
below) that aims at minimizing the following absolute dif-
ference: |f(U, Dn|F) − I0(U, Dn)|, where I0(U, Dn) ∈ I is
the user assigned interest value.
In this work the I set will be considered to be the set
of real numbers, i.e., I ≡ R. This way we can provide a
partial ordering of descriptions Di ∈ D. Our criterion J
is based on whether the ordering of the set of descriptions
a user is entitled to get (due to a subscription) is the one
expected by the user. We do not consider that there is a
unique ordering that will suit the user’s needs. Instead, we
measure the performance of the system based on a devised
measure, called Ratio of Acceptable Errors (RAE), deﬁned
in Section V.
IV. PROPOSED APPROACH: ADAPTIVE
SUBSCRIPTION-BASED UPDATES
The architecture we have devised consists of the Change
Queue, the User Proﬁle Database, the Subscription Infor-
mation Broker and the Adaptive Information Control (see
Figure 2).
The Change Queue is a change log or repository of
changes retaining information on the time stamp of a change.
The User Proﬁle Database, matches a user-consumer to her
proﬁle and holds such information as the time stamp of
the last update the user has received. The database can be
distributed over several servers and a login-based approach
allows mapping each user-consumer to a corresponding
proﬁle and the set of entities she has subscribed to. On the
other hand, the sustem is designed in a way that there is no
need to transfer proﬁle information across different modules
of the system, thus seriously reducing privacy concerns for
this information.
The Subscription Information Broker takes change in-
formation and stores them into the Change Queue. The
broker is also the component that sends the information to
the consumers. To do that, the broker requests from the
Adaptive Information Control component the set of data
that need to be sent to active users, on a per user basis.
Furthermore, the Subscription Information Broker reports
the consumer feedback to the Adaptive Information Control
when the consumer uses the feedback mechanism, to allow
for adaptation to consumer needs.
The Adaptive Information Control matches each consumer
to a user proﬁle, requests from the Change Queue the

changes that have occurred since the user’s last update and
ranks and groups the information that will be sent to the
user. This information is then passed on to the Subscription
Information Broker to be disseminated. The Adaptive In-
formation Control also uses user feedback provided by the
Subscription Information Broker to recompute and update
the user proﬁles in the User Proﬁle Database.
The asynchronous nature of the overall process, as well as
the fact that only Subscription Information Broker interacts
with external messages, allows for off-line and distributed
processing, facilitating scalability. This is why no external
access is granted to the subscription service database di-
rectly. Furthermore, the Adaptive Information Control mod-
ule is a required medium between the feedback mechanism
and the user model database, because of the required calcu-
lations for the update of the user model, especially as far as
it concerns the content of a change (see Section IV-A2).
The adaptation of the aforementioned architecture to user
needs relies on two main aspects of the Adaptive Infor-
mation Control: the ﬁrst is how changes’ descriptions are
represented to form a user model and the second is how the
system adapts to user feedback.
A. Modeling Change and Information Importance
We deﬁne the description D of a change in a dual way,
concerning the type and the content of the change. For each
of these aspects we use a different kind of representation to
address their individuality.
1) Type of a Change: The type T of a description can be
viewed as a point in a multi-dimensional space, where the
dimensions are:
• One dimension for each alternative of entity change:
deletion, splitting of an an entity into two, merging
of two entities in one, and entity update. A deletion
change signals the removal of an entity from the ENS.
A splitting change indicates the splitting of a single
entity into two individual entities, when an entity is
found to have been erroneously created with data from
two different entities. A merging change describes
the merging of two entities into a new one, when
the original entities actually referred to the same real
entity. An update indicates any change in the individual
attributes of an entity. The value for each dimension
can be either 1.0, indicating the corresponding type of
change, or 0.0 otherwise.
We have decided to use a different dimension for every
change alternative, because enumerating the alternatives
over a single real axis would imply a partial ordering
between alternatives, which does not stand. An example
case of a merging change will have the value 1.0 at
the merging dimension and all the other alternatives’
dimensions, i.e., deletion, splitting and update, set to
zero.
• One dimension for each alternative of attribute change,
which is the result of an entity update change: deletion,
insertion, update. A deletion of an attribute means
removing the attribute name-value pair as a whole from
an entity. An insertion indicates the insertion of a new
attribute name-value pair into an entity. An update
is a change of a given attribute, using a new value.
The update is further elaborated using the following
dimension of normality.
• The normality of a type of change should indicate, in
a quantitative manner, whether a given update appears
to be expected. This normality can be judged by such
processes as type checking for new values, or by
whether a value holds similar qualities to other values
for the same attribute. For example a grammar model
for a given attribute can indicate whether the new value
is normal or not. We use normality as a real value,
normalized between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates
maximum abnormality and 1.0 perfect normality.
We can now represent a type T of change in a vector
space, but the content C of the change is a completely
different challenge. In an ENS system, the state of an entity
can be described as a set of attribute name-value pairs. Thus,
C is determined as the difference between the two states.
Ideally, we want to be able to identify such preferences as
“I am interested in changes that have to do with my entities’
name or telephone number”, or “I am interested about when
the inProduction ﬁeld of proteins has a value of true”. To
identify such preferences one must act on the string level and
create a model for attribute names and attribute values that
are of interest for the consumer. The string representation of
the content is the attribute-value pair that was changed, in its
changed version if such a pair is applicable to the change.
Otherwise, the representation is an empty string.
2) Content of a Change: To model interesting attribute
name-value pairs, we use the paradigm of character n-gram
graphs [23], which can take into account substring matches
and offer a set of operators that allow for an updatable
model [14].

Sample N-gram Graph Representing the String “home phone”
A character n-gram Sn contained in a text T can be any
substring of length n of the original text. The n-gram graph
is a graph G = {V G, EG, L, W}, where V G is the set of
vertexes, EG is the set of edges, L is a function assigning a
label to each vertex and edge, and W is a function assigning
a weight to every edge. N-grams label the vertexes vG ∈
V G of the graph. The (directed) edges are labeled by the
concatenation of the labels of the vertexes they connect in
the direction of the connection.
The graph is simply constructed by a running window
over a given string, that analyzes the string into overlapping
character n-grams and records information about which n-
grams are neighbours within the window. The edges eG ∈
EG (the superscript G will be omitted where easily assumed)
connecting the n-grams indicate proximity of these n-grams
in the text within a given window Dwin of the original text
[23]. The edges are weighted by measuring the number of
co-occurrences of the vertexes’ n-grams within Dwin.
A graph sample, generated for 3-grams with a maximum
neighbouring distance of 3 can be seen in Figure 3. In Figure
4a we also depict the growth of graph size, in terms of edge
count, based on the number of represented random strings,
which shows that the graph’s edge count grows linearly to
the number of modeled string instances. For normal text3
the growth is more logarithmic than linear, as shown in
Figure 4b. The logarithmic behaviour is more apparent when
the vertices, i.e., possible n-grams, are used to indicate the
growth of the n-gram graph (see Figures 5a, 5b).

Edges of N-gram Graph Over the Number of Modeled Strings
We use the n-gram graphs within this work due to several
of their traits like language neutrality and the fact that, when
used for matching between strings, they offer a graded nor-
malized indication of similarity. We also use the updatability
of n-gram graphs, when applied as language models [14].
In other words, if we judge a set of attribute names-values
as indicative of importance, we can create an n-gram graph
that models the whole set and, thus, avoid keeping all the
attribute names-values for matching. Furthermore, the model
offers fuzzy matching and substring matching, which helps
in open domains of attribute names and values, as is the case
of an ENS.
To model the content C of changes a user is interested
in, we create for each training instance Ci, given by the
feedback process, a corresponding n-gram graph GCi. The

(b) Actual Strings - Vertices
Figure 5.
Vertices of N-gram Graph Over the Number of Modeled Strings
graph is based on the string representation of the change.
The model graph construction process for each set of
changes (e.g., of the uninteresting/interesting/critical classes
of changes) comprises the initialization of a corresponding
graph with the ﬁrst string representation of content, and the
subsequent update of this initial graph with the graphs of
the other content instances in the class.
Speciﬁcally, given two graphs, G1 and G2, the ﬁrst
representing the training set of changes and the second a
new instance, we create a single graph that represents the
updated model graph G1 with the graph of new evidence
G2:
update(G1, G2) ≡ Gu = (Eu, V u, L, W u)
(1)
such that Eu = EG
1 ∪ EG
2 , where EG
1 , EG
2 are the edge sets
of G1, G2, respectively. In our implementation two edges are
equal e1 = e2 when they have the same label, i.e., L(e1) =
L(e2).
The weights of the resulting graph’s edges are calculated
as follows: W i(e) = W 1(e) + (W 2(e) − W 1(e)) × l. The
factor l ∈ [0, 1] is called the learning factor: the higher the
value of learning factor, the higher the impact of the second
graph to the ﬁrst graph. More precisely, a value of l =
0 indicates that the new graph will completely ignore the
second graph. A value of l = 1 indicates that the weights of
the edges of the ﬁrst graph will be assigned to the weights of
the resulting graph. As we need the model of a class to hold
the average weights of all the individual graphs contributing
to this model, the i-th graph that updates the class graph
(model) uses a learning factor of l = (1 − i−1
i ), i > 1. This
creates a class model that acts as a representative graph for
the class content instances.
As already indicated, we need to create more than one
model graphs: one per feedback alternative of the user.
Within this work we give the user three alternatives for
feedback: unimportant information, important information
and critical information (in order of increasing signiﬁcance).
Therefore, we create three corresponding model graphs.
These graphs represent their corresponding content instances
in the user model.
In our system the set of I, which stands for importance, is
the set of real numbers R. We set three qualitatively mapped
thresholds of importance: -1.0, which indicates unnecessary
information, 1.0, which indicates useful information and
2.0, which indicates critical information. Of course, the set
of importance alternatives could have as many elements
as desired, keeping in mind that, if I ≡ R, using higher
values for higher importance will probably provide better
distinction. Given this kind of mapping, we need to be able
to judge the importance i ∈ I of a new instance of changes,
for a particular user.
To further clarify these deﬁnitions, we provide examples
of changes that a user of the system could evaluate as:
• Critical: name deletion or garbaging names, deletion
of default attributes of a type, e.g., deletion of the
longitude and latitude of a location entity.
• Important: change of the longitude and latitude of a
location entity with a new, normal value.
• Unimportant feedback: change in a ﬁeld with a value
that references some other ENS entity.
B. Ranking Using User Feedback
Having reported on the representation of changes, we
can now describe the methodology for assigning importance
values to entity changes, based on a user model.
The parts of the process that need to be described are
• What algorithm is used to learn which changes are
important for a given user?

• What are the descriptive features that can be used to
model a change?
The algorithm we use to learn the user model is actually
that of Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR). SVMs
have already been successfully used in a variety of applica-
tions and settings [24]. Within this work we use the LibSVM
library [25] and especially its ϵ-SVR implementation of the
algorithm found in [26].
The basic idea behind the ϵ-SVR is that, given a set of
training data {(x1, y1), ..., (xl, yl)} ∈ X ×R,where X is the
space of the input patterns we need to “ﬁnd a function f(x)
that has at most” ϵ “deviation from the actually obtained
targets yi for all the training data, and at the same time is as
ﬂat as possible. In other words, we do not care about errors
as long as they are less than” ϵ, ” but will not accept any
deviation larger than this” [27]. In our case, of change types
T, X ≡ Rd, which is the vector space we deﬁned for the
representation of types T ∈ T, and yi ∈ I.
For the content C of changes, on the other hand, we
ﬁrst calculate the size-normalized value similarity[14] be-
tween the n-gram graph GC of a judged C, with re-
spect to each of the n-gram graphs of the user model
Gimportant
U
, Gunimportant
U
, Gcritical
U
. This similarity value,
which lies between 0.0 and 1.0, indicates what part of
the graph of C can be found in the corresponding graphs
of the model of the user. This set of similarities S =
Sunimportant, Simportant, Scritical is the second constituent
of the representation of a description D =< T, C > of
a change with respect to a user model. To use this set of
similarities, we integrate them within the vectors of the type
as new dimensions-features. Therefore, when n-gram graphs
are used, the overall importance of a change is estimated
based on the combined vector for type and content in an
extended input vector space X′. For an illustration of the
overall process of using the graph models into the feature
vector, also see Figure 6.
While in the original version of the system we created
a single graph for both attribute names and attribute value
modeling, experiments (see section V) indicated that these
two models needed to be separated. Therefore in a second
version of the adaptivity process, each level of importance
uses two graphs to represent attribute names and attribute
values.
C. Shift-Aware Adaptive Subscription System (SAAS)
The problem we have described so far does not take into
account changes of user interest over time. However, in
real world scenarios interest shifts occur. This means that
a user does not have a single behavior over time, but that at
random times she changes the target (i.e., desired) ranking
of information.
To tackle the problem of shifting interest we decided
to study the case where the system only remembers the
feedback instances of the last k iterations. This means that

The Process of Content Features’ Extraction
the system “forgets” everything before that. This introduces
the notion of system memory to our approach. The system
memory for iteration i is therefore deﬁned as the set of
feedback instances provided by the user within the time
interval [i − k, i − 1]. This system memory describes the
training set of the learning algorithm. The implementation
simplicity of the system memory approach makes it easily
integrated in a system like the ENS.
The full system that also takes into account interest shifts
has been named SAAS.
V. EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
In order to evaluate our methodology, and given the
fact that OKKAM is not yet at a production state, which
means that users have been limited in number, we had
to generate a synthetic set of entity changes, much like
other works on adaptive systems (e.g., [28], [29]). In the
following subsections we describe the data, the process and
methodology of evaluation, as well as the results of our
experiments.
A. Data
The information concerning user behavior is twofold in
our case. We try to replicate the behavior of the users of the
ENS who change entity data. Then, we create proﬁles for
the behavior of subscribers using the adaptive subscription
service. Correspondingly the data we generate are of the
following two aspects:
• ENS User Behavior Data.
• Entity Subscribers’ Feedback Data.
1) ENS User Behavior Data: As behavior of the users
that change the entities’ data, we generate a number of
changes’ descriptions D — 10000 instances split into sets of
1000 instances to provide for 10-fold validation. To generate
this kind of dataset, we randomly create changes based on a

selection from the following user behaviors: benevolent user
changes, system administration changes and malevolent user
changes. The probabilities of emission per user proﬁle and
change type are elaborated on in Table I.
2) Entity Subscribers’ Feedback Data: The second part
of the evaluation dataset consists of subscriber feedback.
We consider a few representative cases of subscribers to
minimize the evaluation overhead, while providing useful
insight on the adaptivity of the system:
• a subscriber who is interested in the deletion of at-
tributes, to make sure no information concerning the
entities he has subscribed to are missing. This scenario
is expected to mostly use the type of the change
description as a discriminating factor of importance.
• a subscriber mostly interested in the changes of names
entities. This subscriber scenario is expected to mostly
use the content of a change description as a discrimi-
nating factor of importance.
• a subscriber who is interested in whether any entity he
has subscribed to has its “isDeceased” status changed.
This scenario aims to represent the difﬁculty of users
interested in speciﬁc attribute values.
• a subscriber who has the role of a validator of data in
OKKAM, who wants to be aware of abnormal changes
in default attributes, such as deletion or change with an
abnormal value. This subscriber scenario is expected
to use both the type and the content of a change
description as a discriminating factor of importance.
A more detailed description of what each user ﬁnds inter-
esting and critical can be found in Table II. All changes not
noted within a proﬁle are considered uninteresting for the
proﬁle. The proﬁles have been chosen so that they are require
different kinds of information to be determined, concerning
either the type or the content of the change.
Before the actual evaluation, we use the learning method-
ology and produce corresponding results, also supplying
feedback for every step. This process is reiterated for every
subscriber scenario for the whole set of change data. The
information supposedly sent to the user is annotated with the
iteration number, simulating the time-stamp of the change.
For our case, iteration i is considered complete when the

system gets the feedback of that i-th step from the user.
B. Evaluation Methodology
To evaluate the system learning effectiveness, as well as
whether the addition of content-related features is useful,
we experiment on different aspects of the system response.
We determine how quickly the system learns, by “emitting”
changes to the supposed user — in groups of ten — and
measuring how well the systems adapts to the feedback. We
consider that the user feeds back the system after every new
emission, by indicating the importance of all the items in
the last group. The performance of the system for every
emission is, at this point, based on the mean absolute error
of the importance estimation. To judge the learning curve of
the system, we study the magnitude of the mean absolute
error as related to the current number of emissions. We
also deﬁne the Rate of Acceptable Errors measure as an
alternative measure of performance.
1) Rate of Acceptable Errors (RAE): We deﬁne the
system performance for a given change emission to be the
number of times a ranking error has exceeded 0.5. Given our
I values, errors beyond this 0.5 margin may cause an error.
Errors below this margin cannot cause an error by them-
selves. So the performance is the percentage of the impor-
tance estimation in a given set that have their absolute error
below 0.5. Thus, a value of 1.0 in performance indicates a
ranking that is ideal, while a value of 0.0 indicates a ranking
that will have several errors. We call this measure Ratio of
Acceptable Errors (RAE). The formula, for a given set D0

where ˜I(i), I(i) is the i-th element of the corresponding
sequence, ⌊x⌋ is the ﬂoor operator, |X|, gives the number
of elements of a sequence X, |x| is the absolute value of a
number x and min(x, y) is the minimum function.
To determine whether the content aspect of the system is
a valuable resource, we trying two alternatives. One uses
the graph similarities as a feature, while the other does
not. When we use content, we expect that the system will
perform better for subscriber proﬁles that indeed use content
criteria. For other proﬁles, we expect no loss in performance.
C. Learning Different User Proﬁles
Table III indicates the Pearson correlation [30] between
the number of emission, i.e., the training iteration, and the
mean absolute error. A negative correlation indicates that,
after performing more training the error is diminished. We
see that in all cases, when using graphs, the system learns,
with statistical support. In all the cases where we expected
that the content should be used, indeed the system cannot
learn when the content-sensitive methodology is not applied.
RAE as a function of time, as illustrated in Figure 7,
indicates the learning curve of the system. The points in the
graphs indicate the RAE for a given iteration. We note that
there can be several RAE for a given iteration, since we have
applied 10-fold validation of the results. The lines represent
an approximation (LOWESS smoothing [31]) of RAE over
iterations. Dark lines refer to the RAE when using graphs,
while gray lines represent the performance without them.
It appears that, when the content methodology is used,
all proﬁles are feasible to learn. At this original version, the
most difﬁcult case was the attribute name-value-based one
(see Figure 7d), because we used to represent the name-value

pair as a single string and, therefore, generate features of
similarity for them in common, inducing noise in the n-gram
graph pattern matching. In Figure 8 we see the evolution
from the common graph to the separation of graphs for
the attribute name and the attribute value, leading to new
corresponding features in the vector space. It is obvious
that the original problem has been adequately faced and the
learning of the originally difﬁcult case, now takes minimal
iterations to occur.
In general, very few iterations (< 10) are enough for the
proﬁle to be learned. Even the complex proﬁle is learned in
about 20 iterations. This shows that the presented method-

ology is very promising in learning subscriber proﬁles on
changes, but a new version should take into account the
ﬂaws of the ﬁrst. Furthermore, in the original version there
was no support for changing interest over time.
To study also the more realistic case when a user changes
her interests, we created a shifting-interest user proﬁle in
our data generation process. This user changes her interests
either in a periodic or a random manner. Upon the iteration
of the interest shift the user is replaced by one of the basic
proﬁles (see Table II) in a round robin manner. We will call
this user changing user. In the second version of the system,
we also split the representation of interest for attribute names
and attribute values, to check whether all proﬁles could be
effectively learned now.
D. Learning Changing Users’ Preferences — Periodic
Change
In the case of the periodic change we generated the
feedback for the changing user, who every 100 iterations
shifted her interest proﬁle. Given our previous experiments,
we had seen that the system takes about 20 iterations to
learn a proﬁle and, thus, the selection of 100 iterations gave
enough time for the system to show its behavior.
In order to benchmark our shift-aware version of the
system we ﬁrst used the non-adaptive algorithm, where the
system takes into account all the feedback from the user
so far. This approach, presented in [1], can be effective for
non-changing interests, given that the system, once reaching
top performance, will stop taking new instances as data. It
is important to note here that the feedback of the user can
give a direct evaluation of each iteration, therefore providing
information about whether the system has reached high
performance.
In Figure 9a, we present the behavior of the shift-unaware
version of the system. The boxplot on the left indicates the
quantiles of the distribution of the values. More precisely,
for a population of N ordered sample values, it indicates the
values at positions 1 (min. value), N
4 , 2N
4
(median), 3N
4 , N
(max. value). The vertical gray lines indicate the interest
shift. We repeat that, after every interest shift, the user
follows another proﬁle. The ﬁrst thing that is apparent in
the ﬁgure is that, even though the algorithm starts really
well, after the ﬁrst interest shift it never manages to reach
the original levels the performance.
To compare the shift-unaware version to the ﬁnal SAAS,
we performed experiments with windows of various sizes,
but ﬁrst we tested the system with a window equal to the
shift frequency4. The result is illustrated in Figure 9b. It is
obvious that the performance of the SAAS is much more
robust than that of the shift-unaware version.
4Within the text we will use the term frequency to actually describe the
period of the shift. So 1 shift every 100 iterations will be described as
having a frequency of 100.

In order to determine how sensitive the system is to
the selection of the window we conducted a whole set of
experiments for a range of different windows. The results,
together with the performance of the shift-unaware version,
are shown in Table IV. As can be seen, even the extreme
cases where the window is really small do better on average
from the shift-unaware version. This has to do with the fact
that too much noise is induced in the training set if the
memory holds all the history of feedback. Therefore, the
shift-unaware version can be both ineffective and expensive
in terms of storage when compared to SAAS.
Another important conclusion however from the table was
that, even though the system is generally robust, the perfor-
mance does vary according to the window size. The next step
was to study what is the correlation of the window size to
the performance. In fact, we studied the correlation between

the ratio of the window to the interest shift frequency.
E. Learning Changing Users’ Preferences — Random
Change
Given the fact that we wanted to study what is the effect
of having a small or large window as related to the size of
the change frequency, we decided to make the experiment
even more demanding: the user would randomly make the
interest change. To create this random change we used a
random sampler5 that, given a mean of the change frequency
M, would cause an interest shift in the range of [ M
2 , 3×M
2
].
First, we studied the performance of the SAAS for the
random change with M = 100. The results can be seen in
Table V.
To further delve between the relation of window size, M
and RAE performance we repeated the experiments with
M = {50, 75, 100, 125, 150} iterations. The results can be
found in Figure 10, where we depict the average level of
performance (i.e., average RAE) for different W indow Size
M
ratios, given various window sizes. From the diagram, we
noted two things:

• There seems to be a correlation between the average
RAE performance of the system and the average fre-
quency of the shift. This correlation was also proven
statistically by a Pearson correlation test between the
performance of the system and the average frequency
of the shift. The test showed that there is a very
strong linear correlation (approximately 0.8) with high
statistical conﬁdence (p-value was much lower than
10−2. This simply veriﬁes that a users that do not
change frequently their interest will be easier to model.
• There is a range for the ratio of window size to expected
change frequency, which appears to hold high perfor-
mance, regardless of the frequency itself. To better
illustrate and estimate this range we provide Figure 11,
where we present the overall — i.e., over all window
sizes — relation between RAE and W indow Size
M
ratio.
Given that the estimated user interest shift frequency
is F, then it appears that the range between 0.4 × F
and 0.8 × F offers near-optimal results. This indicates
that it is enough to use the expected value of the
frequency to get near-optimal results. Given the fact
that less memory means less space, one could select
to use 0.4 − 0.5 of the estimated user interest shift
frequency to have low spatial cost with near-optimal
performance.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We propose an adaptive subscription service architecture,
concerning the update of clients of an ENS with information
on entity changes. The subscription service, called SAAS,
uses information from user feedback to model user needs,
taking into account both the type and the content of changes.
The system appears to learn even complex user preferences

in a low number of feedback iterations, also coping with
user interest shifts. Our system performs well, even with
randomly changing user interest. It should be noted that in
our experiments we used a radical shift of interest every
time, which made the problem even more demanding than
an average real case scenario. Nevertheless, the average
performance is high and the system appears robust and able
to cope with all different user proﬁles.
We studied the relation between the memory window
size parameter of the user modeling process to the average
performance of the system. There we detected a near-optimal
range for the parameter, which can be calculated as a simple
function of the estimated average change frequency of the
user interest. We showed that the mean performance of the
system is highly correlated to the interest shift frequency, but
the system remains robust enough even for frequent interest
shift changes.
In the future, we plan to study on information theoretic
grounds whether one can determine a priori the performance
of adaptive systems, which use user feedback history, based
on a few easily extracted parameters of the system. For
unchanging user behavior, we may also need to keep the
memory window constant, i.e., not dependent on the current
iteration, until a drop in performance indicating user interest
shift occurs. This means that need to integrate the ability of
detection of user interest shift into the system to improve
on our performance. This interest shift detection should
probably be based on the grounds of time-series analysis of
the feedback data. It will also be important to compare our
methods with an alternative that should use active learning to
augment the training set with useful additions. Finally, it is
important to use the content and type discrimination in other
applications of the user modeling domain and determine
whether there is a generic gain to using this approach.

APPENDIX A.
THE BIAS OF THE RANDOM SAMPLER
To determine whether we have a bias concerning the
frequency sampling from the uniform distribution over the
values [70,210], we perform bootstrapping over our sample
values for all folds and we measure the mean difference
between the input value and a randomly generated, equally
sized, sequence of uniformly sampled numbers from the
same interval (generated by the R statistical package). In
every bootstrap, a new sequence of random numbers is used.
This is repeated 20000 times and we can then estimate the
mean difference between the means, within a 99% interval.
The two-tailed equi-tailed interval returned for the 99%
conﬁdence level indicates that it is most probable that
the mean difference between the numbers generated within
the experiment and a gold-standard generator range from
(approximately) -13 to to 2, which is a pretty good indication
that our generated values can be considered as uniformly
distributed within the 50, 150 interval.
