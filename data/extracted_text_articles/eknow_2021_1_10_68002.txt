Abstract—Under the situation where the resolution of 2019
novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) cannot be foreseen,
tourism locations have continued to be exposed to the risk
that receive intermittent inﬂuxes of people from other regions.
Therefore, it is an urgent issue to establish countermeasures
for accepting tourists. Based on this background, this study
designed an agent-based model that can simulates a spreading
infection process, brought by a continuous inﬂux of tourists,
among regional residents. This study compared the COVID-19
control measures in tourism locations by simulation experiments.
As a result, it was found that certain effects can be expected from
active epidemiological investigation. Greater effects can also be
expected from the regular testing of tourism business employees,
but large-scale testing is currently a major barrier. While the
introduction of contact tracing apps is effective as a counter-
measure therefore, there is a need for further improvement.

I. INTRODUCTION
On October 1, 2020, in view of the governmental update
that the situation of COVID-19 infections in Japan was under
control, the ”Go To Travel” campaign was executed in full
with the aim of economic stimulation in tourism areas by
promoting consumption [1]. After that, it was not until the
arrival of the worst third wave ever is clariﬁed at the end
of December that the tourism promotion established by the
directive to ”make Japan better through travel” had been not
completely canceled. Elsewhere, preliminary calculations were
announced stating that the gross domestic product (GDP) for
the full year of 2020 had decreased by 4.8% because of
COVID-19 and that economic losses were expected to reach
30 trillion yen [2]. The impact on the tourism industry, in
particular, is far-reaching, including not only travel agencies
and accommodation businesses but also land, sea, and air
transport; the restaurant industry; and consumer goods busi-
nesses, which are crucial to the economies of many regions.
For example, a preliminary calculation of economic losses in
Okinawa due to the reduction in tourists was 186.7 billion
yen for the February-May period [3]. Total domestic travel
and tourism expenditure in 2019 including inbound tourism
was 27.9 trillion yen [4], so there were serious concerns that
the ”evaporation” of the tourism demand supporting regional
economies would cause critical disruption thereof. Therefore,
this study models the spread of COVID-19 infection in tourism
locations and compares the effects of hypothetical prevention
and control measures to ﬁnd feasible, effective, astute infection
prevention and control measures with consideration for the
effects both on those directly involved in the target regions
and on others. The purpose of this study is not to discuss
the superiority or inferiority between a bottom-up approach
in terms of personal behavior, such as avoiding the three Cs
(closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings) and
voluntarily restricting movement, and a top-down approach in
terms of strong government restrictions, such as the declaration
of a state of emergency. Rather, this study examines the idea
of infection prevention and control measures that enable the
continuous growth of the entire region, without bound by such
categories.
A. COVID-19 agent-based simulations
Even with the negative impacts of COVID-19 infections
around the world, we have acquired greater expertise. Ac-
cordingly, several researchers are working on modeling social
systems that include non-linear interaction to create simu-
lations for policy-making support toward the prediction of
infection expansion in the future, which is almost impossible
by intuition alone, to resolve the situation. Agent-based models
excel at the manifestation of effects through micro-level behav-
ioral changes among individual citizens as speciﬁc intervention
measures against infection, as well as at operability based on
intervention scenario ﬁnding. Therefore, they are used with
existing infectious diseases, such as smallpox [5] [6] [7],
measles [8] [9], Zika fever [10], Ebola hemorrhagic fever [10]
[11], and rubella [12]. As for the proposed COVID-19 simu-
lations, most are based on macro-scale mathematical models
including the studies, but there are also some interesting agent-
based models. Ferguson et al. [13] reports that non-medical
intervention, such as wider social distancing, home isolation,
and home quarantine throughout the UK and the United States
may mitigate the spread of the infection to some degree, but
as long as there is no prevention system, such as a vaccine or
antiviral drug, pressure on medical resources is unavoidable,
and large numbers of fatalities are likely. Based on this
report, the UK government shifted immediately from its initial
mass immunization strategy to strict intervention measures to
ensure social distancing. Silva et al. [14] simulated not only
the epidemiological dynamics but also an estimation of the

economic effect of various intervention scenarios with regard
to ensuring social distancing and demonstrated that where
a lockdown is unfeasible because of the scale of economic
impact, a combination of the use of face masks and partial
isolation is more realistic. Aleta et al. [15] constructed an
agent-based model based on census research and movement
data in the greater Boston area and demonstrated that by means
of testing, contact tracing, and home quarantine after a period
of strict social distancing, it was possible to resume economic
activity while protecting the health system. D’Orazio et al.
[16] suggested that a reduction of virus spreading in public
buildings ”emerges” from individuals’ protection measures,
such as facial masking, by using an agent-based model which
can jointly simulate people’s movement and virus transmission
. Then, D’Orazio et al. [17] suggested that such individuals’
protection measures are also keys to sustainable economic
activities in touristic urban areas, by a similar approach.
B. Summary of related studies and positioning of this study
These studies demonstrate that the use of an agent-based
model is possible but do not sufﬁciently verify the effects
of non-medical interventions with attention to the hetero-
geneity of residents’ daily lives and their close relations
to these interventions when a vaccine or antiviral drug is
not available. Further, there are also not adequate spatial or
temporal estimates of regional characteristics with regard to
countermeasures and their effects on parts of tourism locations,
for instance, that receive intermittent inﬂuxes of people from
other regions. Therefore, this study explores feasible, effective
non-medical infection prevention and control measures using a
COVID-19 agent-based model with the assumption of speciﬁc
tourism locations. The remainder of this paper is organized
as follows. Section 2 describes the COVID-19 agent-based
experimental model which can evaluate various non-medical
infection prevention and control measures. Section 3 explains
the experimental scenarios assuming the implementation of the
measures to prevent and control infection. Section 4 discusses
the experimental results. Section 5 concludes this paper by
describing the research achievements.
II. COVID-19 INFECTION MODEL FOR TOURISM
LOCATIONS
As an expansion of existing infectious disease studies
in which validity evaluations have been conducted for the
transition of infection—namely an Ebola hemorrhagic fever
model [11] and a rubella model [12] —a COVID-19 model
[18] was constructed for Myoko City in Niigata Prefecture.
The model uses restored population data created with the
household composition restoration method [19], a method
of restoring population data so that it conforms to various
published statistics (e.g., national census, demographics, busi-
ness/industry statistics, etc.), which is optimized using simu-
lated annealing with the errors in the recreated data (restored
data) collation after calculation as the objective function. This
restored population data includes the longitude and latitude
of the location of the household and its members’ gender,
age, employment status, type of industry, scale of business,
etc. Using this data, FIG. 1 shows the population distribution
of the target city. With attention to place names, terrain,
road connections, school district divisions, etc., the town is
divided into nine zones as shown in the ﬁgure. The valley-
shaped terrain is traversed by a local railroad, with residential
areas distributed next to the line. Most of the population is
concentrated in the north, forming an urban area integrated
with the center of Joetsu City, where the terminal station
is located. In addition, there are many ski and hot spring
resort areas at the foot of the mountains in the southeast and
southwest.
FIG. 1. POPULATION DISTRIBUTION OF MYOKO CITY
The total population based on the restored population data
is approximately 31,500 people, but for ease of calculation,
it was rounded down to approximately 1/5 in the model.
However, the ratios of household composition, number of
households, population per zone, etc. were set according to
the actual population composition (see TABLE I).

based on people’s heterogeneity, such as age and lifestyle.
Therefore, by implementing such demographic information in
the model, it is possible to simulate the complex behavior of
infection.

A. Behavior of citizen
Resident agents in the model who commuted to work or
school were set based on restored population data, munic-
ipal public information regarding public facilities, tourism
guides, etc. 66% of young people—that is, 17% of the total
population—attended childcare facilities or school. There were
10 childcare facilities, nine elementary schools, and four junior
high schools in the city, as well as one senior high school
in the city and four outside. 70% of the remaining young
people, 80% of adults, and 20% of the elderly—that is, 48%
of the total population—were workers. This corresponds to a
48.3% total employment ratio in the restored population data.
TABLE III shows the employment locations of workers.

The area has many popular tourist locations, and the ratio of
employees at wholesale or retail businesses, accommodation,
or food service businesses and daily life-related services and
entertainment businesses was 26%. Reﬂecting this, the ratio
of workers in actual customer-facing roles was set at 15%,
just over half. These employees in the hospitality industry are
considered to have contact with tourists, the main topic of this
study. In the hospitality industry, local shops are established
near local railway stations in the model area, with their
employees set as residents of nearby zones. These local shops
refer to retail stores, such as supermarkets and restaurants
that are mainly served to local residents. However, tourists
also use the two in the south, near the resort areas in the
southeast and southwest. Tourism spots, hotels, and night spots
are located in the southeastern and southwestern resort areas,
with the majority of their employees living in nearby zones.
Some of the resident agents other than workers at local shops
and residents of nursing homes go shopping at local stores
neighboring to their residential zones after work or school.
Finally, all resident agents other than hospital inpatients go
home.
FIG. 2 shows the household and facility distribution in the
model space.
B. Progress of infection and symptoms
In each round of simulations, infection was modeled on
localized interaction among resident agents. Resident agents
were activated sequentially in random order; in the case of
contact with other resident agents who were infected on the
model plane, the contact ratio cr was generated probabilisti-
cally because of interaction, with infection occurring in line
with the transmission ratio tr. The infection ratio ir, the
probability of the occurrence of infection, was deﬁned as
follows.
ir = cr ∗ tr
(1)
This infection probability deﬁnes how much a nearby in-
fected person infects each agent. This probability was set so
that the expected value would be the same based on the basic
reproduction number R0 (2.5) of COVID-19 and the estimated
contact time of the inhabitants per day at each contact scene
such as workplace, school, home, and so on.
Based on reports of detailed analyses of the infection
prevalence of COVID-19 [20] [21], the following process of
the progress of symptoms was deﬁned. The incubation period
is 5 days following infection, but the person can infect others
by the third day even during this period. On the sixth day,
when the incubation period has ended, symptoms, such as
fever, coughing, and diarrhea occur in most infected people.
After the fever, the basic scenario included a 50% probability
of home isolation after visiting a doctor. The remaining 50%
of infected people are either essentially asymptomatic or have
minor symptoms, so they continue to go to work or school
while self-medicating with febrifuges, etc. After the symptoms
have continued for 4 days or more, infected people see a doctor
and undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with the
results conﬁrmed the following day, leading to hospitalization
if the results are positive. Regarding the actual number of
fatalities, because the estimated number of infected people
has been drastically reduced, the test supplementary ratio was
set at half (50%). Further, 20 days after infection, 20% of
infected people become seriously ill and are hospitalized even
without having seen a doctor in advance. Also, by 41 days

FIG. 2. HOUSEHOLD AND FACILITY DISTRIBUTION
after infection of those hospitalized with serious symptoms,
fatalities comprise 0.06% of young people, 0.21% of adults,
and 1.79% of the elderly. The mildly ill recover by 27 days
after infection and the surviving seriously ill by 49 days after
infection, achieving temporary immunity.
III. ESTIMATING EFFECTS OF INFECTION PREVENTION
AND CONTROL MEASURES
For this model, simulation scenarios for infection prevention
and control measures for the entire region were set, including
the hospitality industries that may be used by infected tourists.
Table IV shows the settings of the scenarios. There are a
total of 12 scenarios, deﬁned by whether to accept tourists,
infection control at shops, nightspots, tourist spots, quarantine
facilities for infected people, degree of tracking close contacts,
frequency of PCR tests, and so on.
These infection prevention and control scenarios are roughly
divided into four; social distancing (scenarios S1-S2), contact
tracing (scenarios S3-S4), regular testing for high-risk workers
(scenarios S5-S7), and combination of contact tracing and
regular testing (scenarios S8-S11). In Scenario B0, tourists are
not accepted by the hospitality industry overall, and there is no
inﬂux of infections, but one resident is infected at the initial
point. In Scenario B1, tourists are accepted by the hospitality
industry overall, and one infectious tourist per week enters.
In Scenario S1, local residents’ visit to local shops is reduced
by 75%; in Scenario S2 local residents’ visit to local shops
is reduced by 75% and contact between hospitality industry
workers and tourists is reduced by 75%. In scenarios S3 and
S4, local residents’ visit to local shops is reduced by 75%,
contact between hospitality industry workers and tourists is
reduced by 75%, forward tracking (once) of persons in close
contact and PCR tests are implemented, and those testing
positive are isolated at a treatment accommodation facility.
Here, a forward tracking of persons in close contact with the
objective of preventing further infection expansion is imple-
mented by tracking tests, e.g., via interviews and the contact
app COCOA, [22], etc. for persons in post-infection close
contact with people who have tested positive for infection.
The tracking ratio is deﬁned as the discovery ratio of persons
in close contact and the infection source. In scenarios S5-S7,
local residents’ visit to local shops is reduced by 75%, contact
between hospitality industry workers and tourists is reduced by
75%, workers undergo regular PCR testing, and those testing
positive are isolated at a treatment accommodation facility.
In scenarios S8-S11, local residents’ visit to local shops is
reduced by 75%, contact between hospitality industry workers
and tourists is reduced by 75%, forward tracking of persons in
close contact and PCR tests are implemented, workers undergo
regular PCR testing, and those testing positive are isolated at
a treatment accommodation facility.

IV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS
Each simulation scenario was implemented 100 times. The
infection prevention and control measures were evaluated by
the average of the peak number of people hospitalized with
serious symptoms, which is the major serious impact on
medical resources. The results are shown in FIG. 3.
The average number of mildly infected persons was 14.3
(B1) at the maximum and 2.4 (B0) at the minimum. The
infection process has an incubation period of 5 days and a
recovery time of 27 days, so the number of new positive cases
per day ranges from 0.65 to 0.11, which is 11 to 2 per 100,000.
In Tokyo, where the infection was spreading at that time, the
number was 14 to 2 per 100,000. Therefore, the average results
of the simulation are almost the same as the actual values of
Tokyo.
The effects of the voluntary infection prevention and control
measures (Scenarios S1 and S2) endorsed as the new normal
and new travel etiquettes were, in comparison with the peak
number of patients hospitalized with serious symptoms with
canceling tourism (Scenario B0), 738% if tourists are accepted
without countermeasures (Scenario B1), 385% with reduction
in residents’ visit to local shops (Scenario S1), and 148% with
thorough reduction in contact between workers and tourists
(Scenario S2).
Scenarios S3 and S4 were 114% with a forward one-time
tracking ratio of 50% (Scenario S3) and 106% with a forward
one-time tracking ratio of 80% (Scenario S4) in comparison
with Scenario B0. These scenarios include reducing a visit to
local shops, thorough reduction in contact, and the isolation
of infected people, the effects of composite prevention and
control measures also including the implementation of tracking
tests for persons in close contact.
On the other hand, the combined spread prevention mea-
sures (scenarios S5 to S7), which carry out regular virus tests
on hospitality employees who may come into contact with
tourists, reduced the number of infected people. The results
are 93% with a 50% test ratio every 2 weeks (Scenario S5),
71% with a 75% test ratio every 2 weeks (Scenario S6), and
63% with a 100% test ratio every 2 weeks (Scenario S7).
Furthermore, the combined spread prevention measures
(scenarios S8 to S11), which carries out both follow-up
inspections of close contacts and regular virus inspections
of hospitality employees, effectively reduced the number of
infected persons. In these scenarios, the results were 67% with
a forward one-time tracking ratio of 50% and a 50% test ratio
every 2 weeks (Scenario S8), 56% with a forward one-time
tracking ratio of 50% and a 75% test ratio every 2 weeks
(Scenario S9), 59% with a forward one-time tracking ratio of
80% and a 50% test ratio every 2 weeks (Scenario S9), and
53% with a forward one-time tracking ratio of 80% and a 75%
test ratio every 2 weeks (Scenario S11).
V. DISCUSSION
The experiment results demonstrate that there are limited
effects even when changes are made to local residents and
tourist lifestyles or to hospitality business service methods in
regions, such as tourism locations that are intermittently visited
by infected people.
As a result of evaluating the effect of active epidemiological
survey, for prospective surveys and tests in persons close con-
tact with those testing positive, it was found that hospitalized
patients can be kept at about the same as that of prohibiting
tourism.
The discovery of infected people by means of substantial
PCR testing at the regional level is expected to have an effect,
but uniform testing for all regional residents is limited. So
the effects of regular PCR tests were evaluated with regard to
workers in contact with tourists in commercial stores, tourism
spots, accommodation facilities, and entertainment districts.
As a result, it was found that infection control effects were
greater than that of prohibiting tourism. However, in Japan,
the maximum testing capacity per day for PCR tests as of
May 2021 is approximately 0.16% (203,477 tests [23] out of
126.5 million people), which is far below the testing standard
of the scenarios where major effects were observed.
Regular PCR tests for just hospitality industry workers have
an effect, but there are various barriers to realize it. So the
effects of the combination of regular PCR tests and active
epidemiological survey were evaluated. As a result, it was
found that major effects on infection control were observed
while reducing number of tests. However, such surveys also
require the construction of systems that enable large-scale
information collection and processing across large areas and
over a long period of time. Therefore, the capacity is limited
when relying only on the efforts of public health center
workers, for example, and if infection expansion continues and

FIG. 3. COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES
the labor required for the survey expands likewise, the survey
system and even the medical system are at risk of collapse.
Therefore, the construction of comprehensive survey systems
that utilize information technology, including tracking persons
in close contact by means of mobile phones, etc., is expected
to have a major effect on the prevention of increased infection.
To this end, in addition to designing a top-down system, the
key is to increase the users of COCOA and other contact
tracing apps to contribute to a bottom-up system. As targets for
infection prevention and control, from now on, the app usage
ratio should be 80% both in the region and among visitors, and
the delays between positive conﬁrmation, app registration, and
notifying persons in close contact should each be shortened as
much as possible.
In Japan, in addition to the continuing low capacity for
PCR testing, there are major barriers to access to tests for
residents, namely decisions made by doctors and the fact
that voluntary testing is not covered by insurance [24], so
sufﬁcient testing systems have not been constructed for the
implementation of any of the infection prevention and control
measures described above. Regardless of whether or not the
region is a characteristic tourism location, for residents who
want to be tested after becoming aware that they may have
been infected or that they may infect others, testing is to
be implemented without delay, allowing for subclinical cases,
to identify infected people. Through the construction of a
system with bottom-up aspects of this kind, for the ﬁrst
time, it will be possible to accurately grasp the infection
situation, the highest priority for public health. This pandemic
is still full of uncertainties regarding, e.g., the development and
distribution schedule for a vaccine, the mutation of the virus,
and the pathology of after-effects. Therefore, it is desirable to
invest pertinent resources promptly to minimize the damage
to citizens’ health and to the economy to the extent possible.
VI. CONCLUSION
With the objective of evaluating the COVID-19 infection
prevention and control measures in tourism locations, this
study compared 11 types of infection prevention and control
measures by constructing simulation models in imitation of
speciﬁc tourism locations. As part of public health policy
to prevent and control infection, analyses of tourist contact
reduction measures, active epidemiological investigation—
prospective tracking tests for people in close contact with
those testing positive for infection, and regular PCR testing
for tourism business employees were conducted. As a result of
the simulated experiments, while there are certain effects from
measures to reduce contact, it was found that the effects are
limited in the case of a continuous inﬂux of infected people
to tourism locations. While certain effects can be expected
from active epidemiological investigation; while greater effects
can also be expected from the regular PCR testing of tourism
business employees, this requires large-scale testing, which is
currently a major barrier. While the introduction of contact
tracing apps is effective as a countermeasure therefore, there
is a need for further improvement in the registration delay
time and the implementation systems for prompt testing after
notiﬁcation.
