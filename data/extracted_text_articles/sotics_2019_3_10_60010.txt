Abstract—Readability 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
characteristics of text information in the listed company's 
annual report. There exists a "framing effect" when decision 
makers use information, which means individual decisions are 
influenced not only by the content, but also by the way in which 
information is expressed. Readability greatly affects investors' 
trust perception and emotional experience, then, affects their 
decision-making. Based on the heuristic model of emotion and 
dual processing theory, this paper established a theoretical 
model to analyze the impact of readability on investors' trust 
perception, emotional experience and investment intention 
under different financial conditions. By using behavioral 
methods, we designed a 2 (readability: high, low) *2 (financial 
status: good, spread) mixed cross experiment to collect data. 
Our study reveals that regardless of profit status, investors are 
more willing to invest in companies with more readable annual 
reports and that the influencing process is mediated by 
investors' emotional experience and trust perception. These 
findings provided evidence for how the information disclosed by 
enterprises affects investors' perception and decision-making 
behaviors and also established theoretical basis for improving 
corporate information disclosure strategies. 
Keywords-annual report; readability; trust perception; 
emotional experience; investment intention. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
In the era of big data, information has increased 
explosively. Regulators and scholars increasingly emphasize 
the treatability of information. As early as 1998, the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the 
Plain English Handbook to improve the readability of the 
documents disclosed by enterprises. The China Securities 
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has also emphasized that 
annual reports of listed companies can be illustrated with 
statistical charts and pictures so as to improve the readability.  
 
 
This study focused on the impact of readability on investors' 
trust perception, emotional experience and investment 
intention and we further analyzed the mediating effects of 
emotional experience and trust perception on investment 
intention. 
As an important channel for listed companies to disclose 
information, an annual report contains financial information 
and non-financial information. Financial information is 
disclosed through standardized financial statements and will 
be audited by certified public accountants. Non-financial 
information is mainly disclosed through narrative text 
information, which provides useful incremental information 
for stake-holders [1]. Because narrative text information does 
not need to be audited, it may be easier for managers to 
manipulate to achieve impression management [2]. For 
example, managers may manipulate the readability of annual 
reports to obfuscate a company's performance [3]. 
Previous studies have shown that there are differences in 
the readability of management's information disclosure and 
this difference in readability is positively correlated with the 
market's short-term response [4]-[7]. Annual reports with low 
readability often lead to lower overall trading volumes and 
lower trading consensus [6], and investors are more likely to 
invest in companies with more readable disclosure documents 
[4]. On the contrary, annual reports with high readability are 
positively correlated with the trading volume of general 
investors, extraordinary returns and the possibility of 
corporate equity refinancing [5]. 
These results provide strong evidence for our study that 
the readability of disclosure documents can affect investment 
decisions and market results. However, previous studies only 
focused on the economic consequences of readability. They 
did not explore the causes of these results. Why did readability 
affect investors' behavior? The mechanism of the impact of 
readability on investors' decision-making remains to be 
further explored. Therefore, we introduced emotion and trust 
in psychology, trying to uncover the "black box" behind this

problem through the heuristic model of emotion and dual 
processing theory. This study not only provided new evidence 
for how information disclosed by enterprises affects investors' 
perception and decision-making behaviors, but also 
established a theoretical basis for improving corporate 
information disclosure strategies. 
The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
summarizes the literature review and develops our 
hypotheses. Section 3 describes the methods. Section 4 
reveals the results and the analysis. Section 5 includes 
conclusions and suggestions. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES 
Four hypotheses were proposed based on the literature on 
readability of annual reports, investment intention, emotion 
and trust. 
A. Readability and Investment Intention 
Readability is the cornerstone of text communication. It is 
the key factor which determines whether a text can be 
effectively understood [8]. According to Ease of Processing 
theory, people seem to prefer information which can be 
processed more easily [9]. Therefore, the more readable the 
information is, the smoother the process will be for investors, 
which also implies that such information disclosure is more 
reliable. Previous studies have proved that text readability can 
significantly influence the judgment of small investors 
[10][11]. Low readability tends to reduce investors' trust in 
information sources, leading to participants' poor evaluation 
[12]. Investors are more likely to invest in companies with 
more readable annual reports [5]. At the same time, readability 
often reflects executives' psychological characteristics and 
behavioral motivation to the capital market [13], and then 
affects the response of capital markets. Therefore, we believe 
that higher readability conveys more positive signals to 
investors and enhances their confidence and cooperation 
intention, thereby improving their investment intention. Thus, 
we propose the following hypothesis: 
H1: Investors prefer to invest in companies with more 
readable annual reports. 
B. Mediating Effects of Emotional Experience 
In uncertain environment, individuals often use emotional 
heuristics 
to 
make 
choices. 
They 
consciously 
or 
unconsciously make decisions based on their subjective 
emotional reactions to task options [14]. Modern theories of 
cognitive psychology and neuroscience hold that there are two 
systems in human’s brain in the process of reasoning and 
decision-making, namely, the intuitive system and the rational 
system. The systems operate in parallel and depend on each 
other's guidance [15]. Both the heuristic model and the dual 
processing theory emphasize the role of emotional and 
intuitive irrational factors in decision-making. Analytical 
reasoning cannot be effective unless guided by emotion. 
Therefore, rational decision-making requires a proper 
combination of analytical system and intuitive system [15]. 
When investors make decisions, the company's business 
performance and future prospects provide important reference 
and will ultimately affect their investment intention and 
decision-making. This process is the result of careful analysis 
processed by the brain's rational systems. Rational analysis is 
important. But in uncertain and complex decision 
environment, people tend to rely on emotional experiences to 
make decisions [16]. A growing body of research has 
provided evidence that both positive and negative emotion can 
influence investor behaviors. Positive emotion will increase 
investors' risk tolerance [17]. In this case, investors will 
overestimate the return of investment decisions and 
underestimate the corresponding risks, thereby improving the 
level of investment [18]. However, negative emotion will 
increase the degree of investors' "loss avoidance" [17] and 
people will make careful analysis and critical evaluation when 
reasoning and making decision. Based on the above analysis, 
we predict that high readability will stimulate positive 
emotion and make investors enhance their investment 
intention and that low readability will generate negative 
emotion and make investors reduce their investment 
willingness. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses: 
H2: The impact of annual reports' different readability on 
investment intention is mediated by positive emotion 
triggered by investors. Annual reports with high readability 
will generate positive emotion and enhance the investment 
intention. 
H3: The impact of annual reports' different readability on 
investment intention is mediated by negative emotion 
triggered by investors. Annual reports with low readability 
will generate negative emotion and reduce the investment 
intention. 
C. Mediating Effects of Trust Perception 
According to social psychology, trust is the process that 
the trustor generates confident and positive expected 
cognition based on words, behaviors and decisions of the 
trustee. In uncertain and uncontrollable circumstances, 
individuals tend to make judgments and decisions according 
to their trust perception. Trust Decision-making Model 
further explains the generation of trust that based on the 
trustor's perception of trustee's ability, integrity and kindness, 
the trustor will form a cognition of the trustee's credibility, 
and further form a trust evaluation for the trustee, thereby 
making the choice of whether to trust the trustee [19]. In the 
process of investment decision-making, an investor's first 
impression comes from the course of information collection 
and evaluation of listed companies. The investor will form a 
trust perception in listed companies and their management 
through reading or other intuitive feelings, and then make 
investment decisions. If the annual report's high readability 
increases the investors' trust perception in ability, integrity 
and kindness of the listed company and its management, and 
improves the investors' favorable impression for the 
company, we expect that investors will enhance their 
willingness to invest. On the contrary, the annual report's low 
readability may reduce investors' trust evaluation, thereby 
reducing their willingness to invest. Base on the analysis 
above, we propose the following hypothesis:

H4: The impact of annual reports' different readability on 
investment intention is mediated by the trust perception of 
investors.  
III. 
METHODS 
In order to verify the above four hypotheses, the required 
data were collected through experimental methods, including 
the design of participants, task materials, and procedures. 
A. Participants  
Participants were 40 graduate students of Beijing 
University of Posts and Telecommunications, including 10 
males and 30 females. The age of participants ranged from 20 
to 25. All participants had financial foundation and stock 
investment experience. Finally, a total of 38 valid data (9 
males and 29 females) were collected. 
B. Task Materials 
Task materials were four simplified annual reports of 
different companies. Based on real annual reports disclosed 
by Shanghai Stock Exchange, we prepared two simplified 
annual reports according to the company's financial position 
(makes a profit or loss). On this basis, we changed their 
readability by changing the length of sentences and 
paragraphs, as well as altering information's present format 
(highlight the title and the main data, for example). By doing 
so, we controlled the consistency of the information content 
contained in two annual reports. Finally, we got 2 (readability: 
high, low) *2 (financial status: good, spread) totally 4 
different company' simplified annual reports. Among them, 
company A and B were the profit group, in which A's annual 
report had high readability while B had low readability; C and 
D were the loss group, in which C's annual report had high 
readability while D had low readability. 
In addition, some seven-point Likert-type scales were 
designed for our experiment. These scales included a reading 
feedback scale, an emotional scale, a trust scale, an 
investment intention scale and a basic information 
questionnaire. In the reading feedback scale, 4 items were 
designed to test how carefully the participants read the task 
materials. For the emotional scale, we used the Positive 
Affect and Negative Affect Schedule designed by Watson et 
al. [20] to evaluate investors' emotional experience. In our 
trust scale, we developed 12 items to evaluate the 
participants' trust perception on ability, integrity and kindness 
of the listed company and its management. In the investment 
intention scale, we designed 3 items to evaluate the 
investment intention of investors. 
C. Task Procedures  
We simulated the real investment environment and 
divided the tasks into profit group (A&B) and loss 
group(C&D). Each participant was asked to participate in both 
groups randomly. The main steps are as follows: participants 
were asked to read the annual reports of the two companies 
corresponding to the first task group. After reading, they 
needed to fill in the reading feedback and investment intention 
scale (the order of the two companies were random). After the 
completion of the first task, participants could rest freely and 
then followed the same process to complete the second task. 
After finishing both tasks, participants filled in the emotional 
scale, the trust scale and the basic information questionnaire. 
The experiment ended. 
IV. 
RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
 Paired-Samples T Test and Bootstrap mediation test were 
performed on the experimental data to test the validity of the 
above four hypotheses. 
A. Readability and Investment Intention 
According to the results of Paired-Samples T Test, 
readability had significant influence on investors' investment 
intention. As Figure 1 shows, the average investment intention 
of the company with more readable annual report is 
significantly higher than that of the company with less 
readable annual report in both groups (profit group: t=5.598, 
p=0.000; loss group: t=3.391, p=0.002). 
 
Figure 1.  Investment intention under different surpluses 
Therefore, H1 is supported. Regardless of profit status, 
investors prefer to invest in companies with more readable 
annual reports. 
B. Mediating Effects of Emotional Experience 
The results of Paired-Samples T Test showed that annual 
reports' readability causes significant differences in positive 
and negative emotion. Specifically, positive emotion triggered 
by high readability is significantly different from those 
triggered by low readability (profit group: t=7.712138, 
p=0.000; loss group: t=8.140316, p=0.000); negative emotion 
triggered by high readability is also significantly different 
from those triggered by low readability (profit group: 
t=4.091056, p=0.000; loss group: t=5.044795, p=0.000). 
To further examine the mediating effects of emotional 
experience, we performed Bootstrap mediation test with 
reference to the mediation effect analysis procedure proposed 
by Zhao et al. [21] and multiple parallel mediation variable 
test methods proposed by Preacher and Hayes [22]. The 
sample size was selected as 5000 and the confidence interval 
was set as 95%. Table 1 shows the results.

Under the condition of profitability, because 0 was not 
contained in the interval (LLCI=0.179, ULCI=0.932), the two 
mediating variables, positive emotion and negative emotion, 
taken as a set, jointly mediated the relationship between 
readability and investment intention. The indirect effect 
through the two mediators was 0.511. An examination of the 
specific indirect effects indicated that only positive emotion 
was a mediator while negative emotion was not, since positive 
emotion's 95% CI did not contain 0 (LLCI=0.014, 
ULCI=0.956), and negative emotion's 95% CI contained 0 
(LLCI=-0.143, ULCI=0.277).  
The results indicated that, in profitable companies, the 
relationship between readability and investment intention was 
mediated by positive emotion, but not by negative emotion. 
Figure 2 shows the corresponding mediating model. 
 
Figure 2.  Emotional Experience mediating model of profitable company 
Under the condition of financial loss, the interval 
(LLCI=0.317, ULCI=1.235) did not contain 0, indicating that 
the mediating effects of positive emotion and negative 
emotion were significant. The indirect effect through the two 
mediators was 0.775. In the two mediating paths, only 
negative emotion was a mediator, since its 95% CI did not 
contain zero (LLCI=0.052, ULCI=0.660). The mediating 
effect of positive emotion was not significant (LLCI=-0.003, 
ULCI=0.864). 
The results indicated that, in loss-making companies, the 
relationship between readability and investment intention was 
mediated by negative emotion, but not by positive emotion. 
Figure 3 shows the corresponding mediating model. 
 
Figure 3.  Emotional Experience mediating model of loss-making 
company 
The interpretation of these results is that different 
emotions were at work under different surplus situations. In 
profitable companies, positive emotion mediated the effect 
of readability on investment intention. On the contrary, in 
loss-making companies, it was negative emotion but not 
positive emotion that mediated the effect of readability on 
investment intention. 
C. Mediating Effects of Trust Perception  
According to the results of Paired-Samples T Test, annual 
reports' readability caused significant differences in investors' 
trust perception (profit group: t=7.153509, p=0.000; loss 
group: t=5.821748, p=0.000). There were significant relations 
between trust perception and investment intention (profit 
group r=0.587, p=0.000; loss group r=0.415, p=0.001). 
To further examine the mediating effect of trust 
perception, we conducted Bootstrap mediation effect test with 
reference to the mediation effect analysis procedure proposed 
by Zhao et al. [21] and Bootstrap method proposed by 
Preacher and Hayes [23] and Hayes [24]. The sample size was 
selected as 5000 and the confidence interval was set as 95%. 
Table 2 shows the results.

corresponding mediating models.

V. 
CONCLUSION 
As one of the most important characteristics of text 
information in the listed company's annual report, readability 
considerably affected investors' decision-making. However, 
previous studies only focused on the economic consequences 
of readability. There were few empirical studies on the 
mechanism of readability' impact on investors. Based on the 
heuristic model of emotion and dual processing theory, this 
paper established a theoretical model to analyze the impact of 
readability on investors' trust perception, emotional 
experience and investment intention under different financial 
conditions. By using behavioral methods, we designed a 2 
(readability: high, low) *2 (financial status: good, spread) 
mixed cross experiment to collect data. This study reveals 
that, regardless of profit status, investors are more willing to 
invest in companies with more readable annual reports and the 
influencing process is mediated by investors' emotional 
experience and trust perception. 
This study provided new evidence for how information 
disclosed by enterprises affects investors' perception and 
decision-making behaviors. Firstly, we have provided 
evidence that investors prefer companies with more readable 
annual reports regardless of profit status. Secondly, we proved 
that the impact of readability on investment intention is 
mediated by emotional experience and trust perception. We 
interpret these results as that analytical system and intuitive 
system work together in the process of making judgments. 
When investors make decisions, the company's business 
performance and future prospects provide important reference 
and will ultimately affect their investment intention and 
decision-making. This is a process of careful analysis by the 
brain's rational systems. At the same time, the brain's intuitive 
system also plays a significant role that irrational factors, such 
as trust perception and emotional experience evoked by 
readability, affect investors' judgments and decisions as well. 
Our results are consistent with the notion that when investors 
make decisions, annual report information is processed by 
analytical system and intuitive system together and then 
affects investors' investment behavior. 
This study also provided a theoretical basis for improving 
corporate information disclosure strategies. There exists a 
"framing effect" when decision makers use information, 
which means individual decisions are influenced not only by 
information content, but also by the way in which information 
is expressed. Readability affects investors' trust perception 
and emotional experience and then influences their decision-
making behaviors. Therefore, in the process of information 
disclosure management, managers can make effective use of 
this influence by choosing more effective information 
disclosure methods (for example, disclose more readable 
documents) to send positive signals to investors and 
stakeholders, in order to improve the company's credibility 
and value identity and promote market and enterprise 
development more effective.
