Abstract— Turbo coded 64-QAM systems have been adopted 
by standards such as CDMA-2000 and Long Term Evolution 
(LTE) to achieve high data rates. Although several techniques 
have been developed to improve the performance of Turbo 
coded QAM systems, combinations of these techniques to 
produce hybrids with better performances, have not been fully 
exploited.  This paper proposes a combination of Joint Source 
Channel Decoding (JSCD), adaptive Sign Division Ratio (SDR) 
based scaling and prioritised constellation mapping, to 
improve the performance of Turbo coded 64-QAM. JSCD 
exploits a-priori source statistics at the decoder side and SDR 
based scaling provides a scale factor for the extrinsic 
information as well as a stopping criterion. Additionally, 
prioritised constellation mapping exploits the inherent 
Unequal Error Protection (UEP) characteristic of the 64-QAM 
constellation and provides greater protection to the systematic 
bits of the Turbo encoder. Simulation results show that at Bit 
Error Rates (BERs) above 10-1, the combination of these three 
techniques achieves an average gain of 2.5 dB over a 
conventional Turbo coded 64-QAM system. However, at BERs 
below 10-1, the combination of only JSCD and SDR scaling 
provides an average gain of 1 dB.

 INTRODUCTION  
    Since the inspection of Turbo codes by Berrou et.al in 
1993 [1], several communication standards have adopted this 
powerful near Shannon limit error correcting code. For 
example, Turbo coded 64-QAM systems have been widely 
exploited to achieve reliable transmission at high data rates 
in several standards such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) 
[2],[3], CDMA 2000 [4] and HomePlug Green PHY [5]. 
These systems have also been reported to be promising for 
IEEE 802.11a [6]. The major impact of Turbo codes has led 
to the emergence of several techniques such as Joint Source 
Channel Decoding (JSCD) [7], [8], [9], [10], extrinsic 
information scaling and iterative detection [11], [12], [13], 
[14], to improve its error performance and lower its decoding 
complexity. Moreover, certain characteristics of the 64-
QAM constellation have also been exploited to improve the 
performance of Turbo coded QAM [15]. An overview of 
these techniques is given below.       
JSCD essentially involves the use of a-priori source 
statistics and the exploitation of residual redundancy to 
enhance the channel decoding process. For example, Murad 
and Fuja [7] proposed a composite trellis, made up of a 
Markov source, a Variable Length Code (VLC), and a 
channel decoder’s state transitions, to exploit a priori source 
statistics. A low complexity version of the technique in [7] 
was developed by Jeanne et.al [8] and more recently Xiang 
and Lu [9] proposed a JSCD scheme for Huffman encoded 
multiple sources, which could exploit the a-priori bit 
probabilities in multiple sources. Also, Fowdur and 
Soyjaudah [10] proposed a JSCD scheme with iterative bit 
combining, which incorporated two types of a-priori 
information, leading to significant performance gains. On the 
other hand, extrinsic information scaling aims at improving 
the Turbo decoder’s performance by scaling its extrinsic 
information with a scale factor. For example, Vogt and 
Finger [11] used a fixed scale factor to improve the Max-
Log-MAP Turbo decoding algorithm, while Gnanasekaran 
and Duraiswamy [12] proposed a modified MAP algorithm 
using a fixed scale factor. Interestingly though Lin et.al [13] 
proposed a scaling scheme that extended the Sign Division 
Ratio (SDR) technique of Wu et.al [14] to adaptively 
determine a scaling factor for each data block at every 
iteration.  Finally, the Turbo decoding process can be further 
enhanced by exploiting the UEP characteristic of the 64-
QAM constellation to give more protection to the systematic 
bits of the Turbo encoder. This technique has been applied to 
LTE Turbo codes by Lüders et.al [15].  
In contrast with previous works, which have mostly 
considered the schemes developed to improve the 
performance of Turbo codes independently, this paper 
analyses the performance of a Turbo coded 64-QAM 
scheme, which integrates three different techniques. Firstly, 
at the encoder side, prioritized constellation mapping [15] is 
performed so that the systematic bits output by the Turbo 
encoder are given the highest protection when they are 
mapped onto the 64-QAM constellation. The second 
technique employed is JSCD [7], [10], which exploits a-
priori source statistics during Turbo decoding. The final 
technique used is adaptive extrinsic scaling based on the 
SDR criterion [13].  Significant performance gains are 
obtained for both iterative and non-iterative decoding with 
the combination of these three techniques.   
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section II 
describes the complete system model.  Section III presents 
the simulation results and analysis. Section IV concludes the 
paper and lists some possible future works.

reordering is performed on a group of six bits at a time since 
six bits are mapped onto one complex 64-QAM symbol.
From Fig. 1, it is observed that after bit re
parity bits S0 occupy the first two positions of the six bit
that are mapped on one symbol of the 64-QAM constellation 
shown in Fig. 2. In this constellation, the bits found in the 
first two positions are most protected, while the bits found in 
the last two positions receive the lowest protection.

This can be explained by considering the four major and 
16 minor quadrants of this constellation. The major 
quadrants are distinguished by the first two bits of the 
constellation point, for example, in the upper right major 
quadrant, the first two bits are 00. Hence, if the de
only distinguishes between the four quadrants
first two bits are correctly de-mapped. Each major quadrant 
is divided into four minor quadrants
using the 3rd and 4th bits of the constellation points.  
Therefore, with bit ordering [15], the systematic bits
receive the highest protection while the second parity bits, 
P2, receive the lowest. Since the systematic bits of a Turbo 
encoder have the greatest impact on its performance
ordering scheme improves the performance of the Turbo 
decoder. The modulated 64-QAM symbols are then 
transmitted over a complex Additive White Gaussian Noise
(AWGN) channel and the corresponding received sequence 
is denoted by Rt.  
The complete system model for

QAM de-mapper to produce soft bits. These soft bits are then 
de-multiplexed and sent for Turbo decoding. The first Turbo 
decoder is modified so that it can incorporate a

the trellis of the RVLC decoder as described in [7] and [10]. 
This results into a composite trellis structure with which 
JSCD can be performed. With JSCD the computation of the 
branch transition probability is modified.

    With the joint decoder, the a-priori statistics, Pr{Ci} can  
be incorporated into the Turbo decoding process. The 
derivation of the a-priori source statistics for the RVLC 
source given in Table I is now explained. The RVLC 
decoder’s bit-level trellis is shown in Fig. 4 [10]. 
    From the bit level trellis, the probability of the transition 
from state Mt-1 = l’ to Mt = l where l’, l Є 
(F,IA,IB,IC,ID,IE,IF), given an input bit i at time instant t, 
can be derived for all possible state transitions. For example, 
the probability of the transition from the final state F to the 
intermediate state IA, is given by [10]:

    The combination of prioritized constellation mapping, 
JSCD and adaptive scaling certainly lead to an enhanced 
Turbo coded 64-QAM system, but at the cost of greater 
computational complexity and delay. The complexity 
increase due to the bit re-ordering scheme is negligible and 
may even be integrated with the multiplexer. JSCD on the 
other hand leads to the greatest increase in complexity and 
delay because as mentioned previously the joint decoder is 
obtained by merging the states of the RVLC decoder with 
the states of the Turbo decoder. The number of 
computations involved in computing S1r and S2r to perform 
adaptive scaling also increase the delay. However, this is 
compensated by the faster convergence achieved with the 
use of the scale factor and the possibility of stopping the 
iterative decoding process once convergence is achieved. 
This prevents the decoder from performing unnecessary 
iterations.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
The performances of the following four Turbo coded 64-
QAM schemes are compared:  
Scheme 1 – The Turbo coded 64-QAM system with 
JSCD, adaptive scaling and prioritised constellation 
mapping. The encoding and decoding frameworks are given 
in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, respectively. 
Scheme 2 - This scheme only uses prioritised 
constellation mapping. The encoding is as per Fig. 1, but the 
decoding does not include JSCD or adaptive scaling.  
Scheme 3 – This scheme uses JSCD and adaptive scaling 
and its decoder is similar to Scheme 1. However, prioritised 
constellation mapping is not performed, as such, the bit re-
ordering block of the encoder shown in Fig. 1 is omitted.

Scheme 4 – This scheme is a conventional Turbo coded 
64-QAM system without prioritised constellation mapping, 
JSCD and SDR scaling.  
In all simulations, a random alphabet source with the 
probability distribution given in Table I has been used. After 
generating the alphabets, they are grouped into packets of 
size P = 64 symbols. The packets are then Reversible 
Variable Length Coded to obtain an RVLC bit-stream as 
shown in Fig. 1. Normally, the length in bits, L, of each 
packet is transmitted as side-information because L is 
different for each packet. The packetization is important to 
prevent error propagation. The RVLC bit-streams of all 
packets are grouped into blocks of 4056 bits since an 
interleaver size of 4056 bits has been used in the simulations. 
The parameters for the Turbo code used are as follows: 
 
Generator: G = [1, g1/g2], where g0 = 7 and g1 = 5 in Octal. 
Interleaver size, N  = 4056 bits.   
Maximum number of iterations, I = 12. 
Code-rate = 1/3 and channel model: Complex AWGN.  
 
The graphs of Bit Error Rate (BER) as a function of 
Eb/No have been plotted separately over a low Eb/No range: 
0 dB ≤ Eb/No ≤ 3 dB   and a high Eb/No range: 3.5 dB 0 ≤ 
Eb/No ≤ 6.5 dB in steps of 0.5 dB. Eb/No is the ratio of the 
bit energy, Eb to the noise power spectral density, No. It is to 
be noted that the transition from the low Eb/No range to the 
high Eb/No range is essentially a  continuity from 3 dB to 
3.5 dB and up to 6.5 dB. The performance analysis has also 
been made for both iterative and non-iterative decoding. 
Fig. 5 shows the graph of BER against Eb/No for 
iterative decoding over the low Eb/No range. It is observed 
that the Turbo coded 64-QAM system with JSCD, adaptive 
scaling and prioritised constellation mapping (Scheme 1) 
provides the best performance with an average gain of 2.5 
dB for BER > 10-1 over the conventional Turbo coded 
system (Scheme 4). At an Eb/No of 1 dB, Scheme 1 also 
provides a gain of about 1.5 dB over Scheme 3, which does 
not employ prioritised constellation mapping.  
 
 
Fig. 5. Iterative low Eb/No performance with N = 4056. 
Moreover, Scheme 2, which uses only prioritised 
constellation mapping outperforms Scheme 3 by 1dB at an 
Eb/No = 1 dB.  It is to be noted from a theoretical point of 
view the performance of the system for a BER > 10-1 is 
important because it is revealing a new characteristic of the 
system whereby it is seen that significant gains can be 
obtained in this BER region using the proposed technique. 
However, from a practical point of view the performance of 
the system for BER > 10-1 is not really relevant. 
Fig. 6 shows the graph of BER against Eb/No for  
iterative decoding over the high Eb/No range. In this range it 
is observed that prioritised constellation mapping is not 
beneficial. For example, Scheme 2 provides the worst 
performance while the performance of Scheme 1 is 
comparable to that of Scheme 4. A possible explanation is 
that with iterative decoding, in the high Eb/No range, 
convergence takes place. As such, giving more protection to 
the systematic bits does not provide further gains. Also, since 
lower protection has been given to the parity bits, this can 
lead to performance degradation. Over this Eb/No range, 
Scheme 3 which uses only JSCD and adaptive scaling 
provides the best performance with an average gain of 1 dB 
in Eb/No over Scheme 1 and Scheme 4. It is to be noted that 
Scheme 3 outperforms Scheme 1 over this high Eb/No range 
because Scheme 1 suffers from a performance loss, which 
results from the use of  prioritised constellation mapping 
after convergence. 
Fig. 7 shows the graph of average number of iterations 
versus Eb/No over the range 3 dB ≤ Eb/No ≤  6.5 dB. 
Scheme 1 and Scheme 3, which employ SDR based scaling 
with a stopping criterion, show a progressive decrease in the 
number of iterations required as the Eb/No increases. For 
example at an Eb/No of 5.5 dB, Scheme 3 consumes six 
iterations less than Scheme 2 and Scheme 4. However, 
Scheme 1 consumes on average 1.5 iterations more than 
Scheme 3 due to performance loss as a result of using 
prioritised mapping after convergence. The number of 
iterations required by Schemes 2 and 4 remains fixed at 12.

Fig. 8 shows the graph of BER against Eb/No for non-
iterative decoding over the low Eb/No range. It is observed 
that Scheme 1 outperforms all the other schemes with an 
average gain of 2.5 dB over Scheme 4 and  2 dB over 
Scheme 
3. 
However, 
with 
non-iterative 
decoding, 
convergence does not take place and the use of prioritized 
constellation mapping does not lead to degradation at BERs 
below 10-1. This is observed in Fig. 9 whereby Scheme 1 
outperforms Scheme 3 by 0.5 dB on average and Scheme 4 
by almost 1.5 dB. It is to be noted that in [15], whereby only 
bit-reordering was used, it was also observed that with non-
iterative decoding a performance gain is obtained throughout 
the 
Eb/No 
range 
whereas 
with 
iterative 
decoding 
convergence takes place at a certain point. Hence when 
prioritized constellation mapping is used the iterative scheme 
does not present a similar relation as the non-iterative.

IV. 
  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
   This paper proposed an efficient Turbo coded 64-QAM 
scheme with JSCD, adaptive scaling and prioritised 
constellation mapping.  At the encoder side a re-ordering 
mechanism is used to map the systematic bits of the Turbo 
encoder on the most strongly protected points of the 64-
QAM constellation. To enhance the decoding process, 
JSCD is used to incorporate a-priori source statistics and 
adaptive SDR based scaling is also performed. At BERs 
above 10-1, the proposed scheme provides a significant 
performance gain of 2.5 dB with iterative decoding over a 
conventional Turbo coded scheme. For BERs below 10-1, 
the use of prioritised constellation mapping degrades 
performance as a result of convergence. Hence, for BERs 
below 10-1, it is preferable to use only JSCD and SDR 
scaling, which achieves a gain of 1 dB on average over a 
conventional Turbo coded scheme. However, with non-
iterative decoding, the proposed scheme, outperforms a 
conventional Turbo coded scheme at all BERs because there 
is 
no 
performance 
degradation 
due 
to 
prioritised 
constellation 
mapping. Overall, the combination of 
prioritised constellation mapping with JSCD and SDR based 
scaling appears promising for Turbo coded 64-QAM 
systems.  
     Several interesting future works can be envisaged from 
the scheme proposed in this work. A straightforward 
extension 
would 
be 
to 
assess 
its 
suitability 
for 
communication systems such as LTE. A more challenging 
future work would be to use JSCD schemes, which are less 
complex and hence do not incur significant delays while still 
allowing the exploitation of source statistics. The prioritised 
constellation mapping scheme could also be optimised so 
that performance gains could be obtained in the high Eb/No 
range also. Finally, investigations could be made on how to 
extend the scheme to block Turbo codes and also on the 
possibility of using bit interleaved coded modulation.
