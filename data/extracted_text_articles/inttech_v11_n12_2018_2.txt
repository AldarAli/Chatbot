Abstract—Personal and professional communication increasingly
take place on online platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and
Google+. This trend is accompanied by new forms of com-
munication and novel communication dynamics which can no
longer be analyzed using conventional methods only. By means
of agent-based social simulation, actors in social media can be
modeled and their behavior can be investigated. In this work,
we use complex agents to model and simulate Twitter users with
respect to analyzing communication behavior accompanying a
television program. To this end, we present a case study and
show how different actor constellations within a population of
agents inﬂuence the dynamics of this communication.

INTRODUCTION
It is no longer possible to imagine a world without informa-
tion and communications technology. Social media like Face-
book, Twitter, or Google+ have become predominant means
of communication for both private and professional users and
social activities increasingly take place on online platforms.
This trend is accompanied by new forms of communication
which also result in novel communication dynamics. For
analyzing and understanding such emerging phenomena, the
suitability of conventional approaches is limited. To overcome
shortcomings of existing approaches, innovative methods such
as agent-based modeling and computer simulation can be used.
They allow for a systematic and adaptive investigation of
communication dynamics in social media [1].
Understanding communication processes and dynamics is
important in both commerce and politics, e.g., to derive
communication strategies for social media. By this means,
marketing campaigns can reach a vast target audience through
viral communication dynamics [2]. However, if the same dy-
namics distributes negative opinions, emerging mass criticism
can endanger a company’s commercial success. Therefore, it
is crucial to anticipate likely reactions of social media users
to such campaigns to avoid unintended effects or to develop
appropriate counter strategies to those effects [3].
Nonetheless, the inherent distribution of social media and
the dynamics of user interactions therein make it difﬁcult to
analyze and understand that kind of communication. Thus,
manual analysis has been complemented using methods from
computational linguistics, data mining, and simulation [4].
These methods help recognize conversation topics, discern
user communities, and model information diffusion in social
networks.
Especially agent-based social simulations [5] are a promis-
ing technique for understanding complex dynamics of inter-
related communication activities. They model the behavior of
humans by means of artiﬁcial agents to explore the effects of
different social actor constellations and various situations in
an experimental environment. For instance, viral dynamics of
mass phenomena in social media like the harlem shake [6]
can be reproduced by using artiﬁcial agents for representing
media users [7]. Each agent can react to other agents’ com-
munication activities in a simulated media environment. This
interaction leads to complex dynamics. Exploring various user
constellations and agent decisions in a controlled experiment
helps understand these dynamics in real world social media.
However, agent-based simulation for social media analysis
requires a model of user motivations and resulting behaviors
to yield realistic results. Agents must be complex enough to
explain why particular communication processes emerge and
which effects potential reactions to them will provoke. Thus, in
this paper, we present an agent-based model of user behavior
for analyzing communication dynamics in social media. This
is a ﬁrst step toward a simulation-based decision-support
method for developing and testing social media communication
strategies as proposed by Berndt et al. [3].
The paper is structured as follows. Section II provides
an overview of the foundations of social media analysis,
social actor theory, and agent-based modeling as a technique
for dynamic analysis. Subsequently, Section III describes
our concept of complex agents for modeling user behavior.
This concept covers individual social actors, their respec-
tive decision-making, as well as populations of media users.
Section IV applies that concept to communication processes
on Twitter, which accompany a German television program
and speciﬁes the agents’ decision functions accordingly. In
Section V, we evaluate our model by simulating user behaviors
in the presented scenario. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is
conducted to identify how compositions of different actor types
inﬂuence the communication behavior of individual agents.
Finally, Section VI concludes on our ﬁndings and gives an
outlook on future work.
The presented model was ﬁrst introduced in earlier work
of the authors [1]. As extension of this preceding contribution

and to illustrate the agent decision-making, this work provides
and discusses formal speciﬁcations of the decision behavior of
each of the four applied actor types. Moreover, the results of a
sensitivity analysis are presented to shed light on the inﬂuence
that different actor types have on the communication behavior
of the agents.

FOUNDATIONS
To analyze, model, and simulate user behavior in social
media, it is necessary to understand communication processes
within those media. Such processes depend on the under-
lying platforms that structure possible communication, the
observable communicative activities, as well as the social
actors performing these activities. Thus, the following sections
discuss approaches and theories for analyzing and modeling
these aspects. In addition, we give an overview of the state of
research in agent-based modeling of human behavior to pro-
vide a foundation for our approach to user behavior analysis.
A. Social Media
Social media structure communication processes by pro-
viding options to their users to connect with each other. In
terms of graph theory, such a structure can be described by a
set of users (nodes) and relationships between the users (edges)
[8]. Graphs can be unidirectional, deﬁning the direction of the
relationship, or bidirectional, connecting two nodes without
providing information regarding that direction.
For instance, the online social network Twitter can be mod-
eled as a directed graph. In contrast to most other platforms,
which consist of bidirectional relationships between users, a
distinction between followers and followees is made on Twitter.
That is, a user actively and voluntarily decides, which other
users to follow for receiving their status updates. Following
another Twitter participant makes the following user become
a follower. However, a followee, i.e., the user being followed,
does not need to follow his or her followers.
When analyzing the structure of social media, a typical task
is to identify and assess the importance of the most inﬂuential
users by means of centrality measures [9]. The degree of
centrality corresponds to the total number of edges a node
has. Hence, it is a measure of a node’s interconnectedness in a
graph. Nodes having a high degree (compared to other nodes)
act as hubs for information diffusion within a social network.
By contrast, a graph’s density denotes the interconnected-
ness of an entire network. It is used to compare different net-
work structures and their impact on information propagation.
The density is deﬁned by the ratio of the number of existing
edges and the maximum number of edges in case every pair
of nodes would be connected by an edge (complete graph).
B. Communication
Human communication can be considered as a sequence
of actions by individuals, where the behavior of a sender
inﬂuences the behavior of a receiver [10]. The sender uses
a set of characters to encode a message, which is transmitted
using an information medium. The receiver uses an own set
of characters to decode and interpret the message and returns
a feedback using the same mechanism [11]. The formulation
and transmission of messages by the sender as well as the
corresponding reaction by the receiver form the communicative
activities available to users of social media.
However, the shift of communication into technical media
is accompanied by a loss of information. The transmission of
messages is ensured, yet, the receiver does not know whether a
message was interpreted correctly. On Twitter, communication
results can only be returned by replying to a Tweet using
another Tweet. Consequently, conversations are formed as
sequences of messages, which refer to or forward previous
ones [12]. To that end, Twitter provides mechanisms for
replying to other tweets and for addressing a tweet to a certain
person. Using the @-symbol followed by the name of a user
or by putting the preﬁx “RT” (retweet) at the beginning of a
tweet, dialogs or conversations can be deﬁned and identiﬁed.
In addition to the structuring of dialogs, Twitter users can
use another operator for classifying the content of a message.
The content provides information about the intention as well
as the context of communication. On Twitter, the #-symbol
(hashtag) is used for categorizing messages and for marking
keywords. This simpliﬁes ﬁltering Tweets according to certain
topics, which makes this kind of communication easily acces-
sible to media studies and communication research. In fact,
Twitter has been widely used for conducting studies of certain
subjects or events, e.g., spread of news and criticism [4], [13],
the activity of diseases [14], or political communication [15].
C. Social Actors
Communication is inherently social. In fact, sociality can
be considered to consist entirely of communication [16]. Social
systems emerge from interconnected communicative activities
being selected by social actors. Those actors are inﬂuenced by
an observed social situation. They decide about their reactions
to that situation. This results in observable behaviors that lead
to a new situation in effect (Figure 1). For example, a user can
observe an ongoing conversation about a speciﬁc topic (1). She
may decide to utter a controversial opinion about that topic (2).
Her utterance becomes observable to other users in the form
of her respective Tweet (3). This changes the conversation
and provokes further reactions. Thus, the conversation on the
macro-social level (4) both inﬂuences individual behaviors and
emerges from them on the micro-social level.

There are several analyses of user behavior in social
media available. For instance, activity frequencies on Twitter
(i.e., Tweets, Responses, Retweets) have been related to user
attributes and traits such as gender, age, region and political
opinion [18]. While such an analysis reveals how social media
users interact with each other, it cannot explain why they do
it. To answer that question, other studies cover motivations
12

for communication. These motivations can be categorized into
groups such as smalltalk, entertainment, or information and
news sharing [19]. Additionally, they can be derived from psy-
chological personality traits [7] [20]. Such approaches provide
valuable insights into the decision-making process of social
actors in diverse situations ranging from casual comments on
a television series [21] to crisis communication [22].
In addition to social media speciﬁc and psychologically
founded motivational categories, there are also theories of
actor behavior in sociology. Sociologists distinguish between
four basic social actor types, which differ in their behavior
[23]. Firstly, the homo economicus is a rational decision-maker
who strives to maximize her personal utility. Such an actor
attempts to reach personal goals as efﬁciently as possible.
Secondly, the homo sociologicus obeys social norms and
obligations. This actor type tries to conform with expectations
to avoid negative sanctions. Thirdly, the emotional man is
driven by uncontrollable emotions such as love, anger, respect,
or disgust. This leads to affective behavior in response to, e.g.,
unfulﬁlled expectations [24]. Finally, the identity keeper has
the goal to establish and maintain a desired social role. Such
an actor seeks social acknowledgment by provoking positive
reactions toward stereotypical behaviors. In the remainder of
this paper, we will show how these actor types can be applied
to agent-based modeling of user behavior in social media.
D. Related Work: Agent-Based Modeling of Human Behavior
As discussed in the preceding section, communication
processes in social media emerge from individual activities of
the participating users. For investigating emergent phenomena,
agent-based modeling has been established as a standard
means. Artiﬁcial agents are capable of decision-making, com-
munication, and goal-directed behavior [25]. By modeling real
world actors as software agents, individual behavior and antici-
pation of behavior on the micro level can be simulated resulting
in emergent effects on a macro level [26] [27]. In terms of
social sciences, using such actor models for simulation studies
is referred to as agent-based social simulation [5].
The majority of agent-based models in social media anal-
ysis is concerned with information propagation. They aim at
identifying a group of users, which can propagate information,
i.e., a message, to as many users as possible [28]. The users
are frequently modeled as agents being connected by neigh-
borhood relations in cellular automata [29] or general network
graphs [30]. These agents often have particular behavioral rules
that ﬁre if a certain activation threshold is reached. Such a
threshold denotes the required strength of inﬂuence (e.g., a
number of received messages) on an agent until it becomes
active itself. This method is particularly relevant for planning
advertising strategies since viral marketing campaigns make
use of information propagation effects [2], [31].
While threshold models are usually investigated by means
of simulation studies, there are also analytical approaches to
agent-based modeling of opinion formation. These focus on
the interactions among agents, which lead to the diffusion and
adoption of opinions in a process of compromising [32]. They
model these interactions by means of thermodynamics [33]
or the kinetic theory of gases [34]. These methods describe
the emergence of macro-social phenomena from micro-social
interactions using differential equations. This allows for ana-
lyzing the resulting opinion dynamics mathematically.
However, there is a discrepancy between these threshold
and analytical models on the one hand, and the mentioned
sociological perspectives on decision-making on the other.
While these methods describe how opinion and communication
dynamics occur in agent-based social simulations, they lack the
descriptive power to analyze why this happens. That is, they
focus on the dynamics between interacting agents and treat
the agent population as a homogeneous mass. For instance,
in kinetic theory, gas molecules behave solely according to
their current states and their mutual inﬂuences without having
individual habits. The same holds for cellular automata in
which all cells, i.e., agents, are usually homogeneous and
strongly restricted in their neighborhood relations. As a result,
the discussed approaches largely disregard modeling individual
motivations for decision-making such as described by social
actor types.
For utilizing agent-based social simulation to understand
human behavior and to develop communication strategies, it is
necessary to apply more elaborate agent decision approaches.
Agents must have individual motivations to allow for analyzing
who participates in communication processes for which reason
[3]. Since, in social media, different users react differently
to the same message, this should also be the case for ar-
tiﬁcial agents in a simulation model. In fact, a wide range
of agent decision-making architectures based on philosophy,
psychology and cognitive science is readily available [35]. In
addition, sociological theory and agent-based modeling have
been combined in the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of socionics [36].
In that context, the described social actor types can be utilized
to explain social behavior in an agent-based simulation.
Dittrich and Kron model social characters by means of
actor types and combinations between these types [23]. They
simulate the so-called “bystander dilemma” in which persons
must decide whether or not to help a victim of physical vio-
lence. In their model, agents implementing the homo sociolog-
icus and identity keeper roles feel obliged to help while homo
economicus and emotional man ﬂee the situation. Combining
these dispositions on both an individual and on a population
level leads to complex macro-social behaviors. This makes that
approach a promising candidate for a transfer to modeling user
behavior in social media as described in the following section.
In this regard, Berndt et al. [1] present a ﬁrst approach towards
the use of sociological agent types in agent-based modeling for
the simulation of user behavior.
III.
CONCEPT: MODELING USER BEHAVIOR
In this section, we adapt the agent-based decision-making
approach by Dittrich and Kron [23] to modeling communica-
tive user behavior in social media. That is, we model the
selection of messages about a speciﬁc topic to be published
on a social media platform within a limited time frame [37].
Our modeling and simulation concept is structured as
shown in Figure 2. Each decision-making situation receives an
input of one or more keywords, which describe the situation
(e.g., a list of hashtags or abstract topic description). The
respective output consists of messages being published at the
social network platform by the population of agents. In order
to produce that output, each agent observes the situation and
calculates expected values for its potential reactions according
to its respective social actor type and depending on the
activities of other agents. It then selects its next message (or
chooses not to publish any message) with respect to these
expected values. The following sections describe the actor

types, their combinations, and the resulting agent populations.
A. Social Actor Types and Decision-Making
Besides the current situation, its social actor type deter-
mines an agent’s decision-making. To that end, we model each
type by means of a function EV that returns an expected value
for each available activity option. For a homo economicus, this
amounts to a standard utility function. Contrastingly, a homo
sociologicus prefers socially adequate behaviors over contro-
versial actions. Such an agent makes its behavior dependent
on contributions to a conversation by other agents. In addition,
while the identity keeper has a genuine desire to further any
kind of discussion, the emotional man only becomes active
when being emotionally affected by the situation.
All of the expected value functions should cover the same
range of values to make them comparable with each other.
That range depends on the number of available activity options
and their effects in a particular application scenario. Each
option can either have a positive, neutral, or negative effect
on an agent’s goals. For instance, a scenario with ﬁve possible
messages can be encoded through the following set of values:
{−1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. In this case, a message is either detrimental
to an agent’s goals (-1), it can be neutral towards them (0), or
it furthers its motivations to different extents (1–3). Then, the
agent can select its actions as follows.
arg max
a
EV i(s, a)
Each actor type i (i ∈ {homo economicus, homo sociolog-
icus, emotional man, identity keeper}) maximizes its expected
value for all available actions a in the current situation s. If
there are several options with the same value, an agent decides
randomly among them. This results in a speciﬁc message (i.e.,
Tweet) being selected and published at the simulated social
network platform for all other agents to observe. A formal
speciﬁcation of each actor types’ expected value functions is
presented in Section IV
Using the described value maximization approach to select
a message to be communicated leads to a restriction in the
amount of behavioral randomness. This is especially useful
for evaluating the sensitivity of the resulting emergent effects
on the population level to the agent population. Different com-
positions of agents within a population will lead to different
interactions with low variance.
In order to increase the variance of agent behaviors,
ﬂuctuating populations can be introduced. Alternatively, a
random selection of messages, weighted by their respective
expected values, can be introduced. This will then increase the
randomness on an individual instead of the population level.
However, adding this stochasticity decreases the explanatory
impact of modeling social actor types because their respective
motivations become less pronounced in the selected commu-
nication activities.
B. Actor Type Combinations and Populations
According to the preceding decision-making model, each
agent can implement one of the four available actor types.
However, these are only prototypical examples for categorizing
motivations. In fact, an actor’s social disposition will often be
more adequately described by a mixture of several basic moti-
vations [23]. Consequently, we allow for combinations of actor
types within individual agents to represent that phenomenon.
For mixing several actor types, each agent is deﬁned by
four weights wi, one for each actor type i, with P
i wi = 1.
The weights denote the ratio with which those types contribute
to its decision-making. Then, an agent with mixed types selects
its activities by maximizing the weighted sum of the respective
expected values (with a randomized selection in case of several
maxima).

EV i(s, a) wi
In addition to combining actor types within an individual
agent, it is also possible to mix different agents within the
overall agent population. That is, a population can either
consist of homogeneous agents that all implement the same
actor type combination, or it can comprise different agents.
Homogeneous populations are particularly useful for model
validation and calibration. They make the effects of different
value functions easily observable and adjustable. Contrast-
ingly, heterogeneous populations are more realistic. They lead
to complex interaction dynamics, which are necessary for
replicating and explaining user behaviors in social media as
described in the following sections.
IV.
APPLICATION: AGENT-BASED ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL
MEDIA COMMUNICATION
In this section, we apply our agent-based modeling concept
to an analysis of user behavior in communication processes on
Twitter. In particular, we model live-tweeting behavior during
an episode of the German television series “Tatort” (meaning
crime scene). Running since 1970, “Tatort” is the most popular
German TV series, which attracts a broad audience across all
social groups, genders, and ages. We use a dataset of Tweets
about the episode “Alle meine Jungs” (all my boys), of 18
May 2014. The dataset contains eight distinct phases of very
high or very low Twitter activity, which correspond to speciﬁc
scenes of the episode. These scenes provide the situation for
the agents in our model to react to. Each of them is described
by one or more out of ﬁve attributes as shown in Table I.
In our model, the agents can act repeatedly during each
scene. At the beginning of a scene, they base their actions
only on the respective description; subsequently, they can also
react to other agents’ Tweets. Thus, a dynamic communica-
tion system emerges from these interrelated activities. In the

following, we describe the available actions and the decision-
making of the four actor types in these situations.
A. Agent Activity Options
The Tweets in our dataset can be classiﬁed by their
sentiment and tonality along two different dimensions. They
are either positive or negative and they are either joking or
not joking (i.e., serious). The possible combinations of these
categories result in four different message types available to
the agents. However, since not all users reply to every message,
an agent also has the option not to tweet. Nevertheless, it can
still decide to participate in the conversation about the current
scene at a later time after observing Tweets by other agents.
This results in the following ﬁve activity options for the agents.
1)
No Tweet
2)
Tweet – positive – joking
3)
Tweet – positive – not joking
4)
Tweet – negative – joking
5)
Tweet – negative – not joking
Which of these options an agent selects at which time
depends on its underlying combination of actor types, as
well as on the activities of other agents as described in the
following.
B. Agent Decision-Making
In our application example, the actor types deﬁning the
agents’ decision-making represent typical behavioral roles and
motivations in social media communication. These include the
maximization of publicity, a desire for serious discussion, the
expression of anger, as well as genuine content production.
Motivations are represented by the homo economicus, homo
sociologicus, emotional man, and identity keeper, respectively.
For all actor types, we evaluate the available activity options
with respect to those motivations in each situation in order
to identify expected values for the agents’ decisions. Table II
summarizes the criteria and values for that evaluation. Further-
more, for each actor type, a speciﬁcation of function EV is
presented, which is used for the calculation of the expected
values [38].

In social media communication, a homo economicus agent
attempts to maximize the impact of its contributions on the
conversation. Such an agent gains the highest utility by pro-
voking agreement with as many other agents as possible. Thus,
its underlying utility function anticipates probable majority
opinions. Actions supporting these are rated higher than less
popular or even controversial contributions according to the
distribution of actions in the original dataset. This agent
type will maintain its ratings during an actual conversation
regardless of other agents’ behaviors.
In addition, we use a threshold of a minimal number of
Tweets by other agents for this type of agent to become active
itself. This threshold equals to the mean number of Tweets
across all scenes (24 in the dataset). Until the threshold is
reached, an agent will not participate in the conversation,
leaving its utility unchanged. Thus, the homo economicus
represents a casual media user who only joins ongoing con-
versations to represent common sense opinions shared by the
expected majority of recipients.
The corresponding expected value function depends on the
Tweets published in the current scene s so far as given by
tweetss. If the overall number of Tweets in P
a′∈A tweetss(a′)
does not exceed the threshold, the homo economicus has a
value of −1 for all other actions than the no Tweet option.
The threshold
1
|A|
P
a′∈A ϕs(a′) is the arithmetic mean of all
Tweets throughout the scenes in the entire original data set.
Otherwise, the agent selects its actions according to their share
in the real world data set given by ϕs(a). The prevalent action
is yielded by the term maxa′∈A(ϕs(a′)), which iterates over all
possible actions in the respective scene. Moreover, the utility
values for a homo economicus are normalized and rounded to
the nearest natural number between 0 and 3.

Contrastingly, a homo sociologicus agent rates the available
actions according to general social norms as well as other
agents’ behaviors. With respect to the scene description, its
expected value function evaluates these options by their per-
ceived strength of obligation. For instance, an agent should
not joke about an emotional scene. However, if the majority
of other agents has deviated from such norms before, the homo
sociologicus will mimic these previously observed activities in
order to gain acceptance by other agents. Hence, that type of
agent represents a both morally concerned and opportunistic
user who joins the dominant group as soon as one emerges.
This behavior is typical, e.g., in massive online protests [4].
The expected value of a homo sociologicus agent depends
on the norm for the current situation and the predominant
action so far. The function norm(c, a) returns a value of −1
for an action it should not select, 1 if the agent can execute
an activity, 2 if it should do it, and 3 if it must choose the
respective action. Table III shows the norms that affect an agent
for each attributional category in the current scene description.

express that anger. This leads to predominantly negative and
sometimes sarcastic (i.e., joking) contributions. By publishing
negative Tweets, the agent decreases its anger until it no longer
feels the need to communicate. Consequently, that behavior
produces isolated criticism without any intention of engaging
in an actual discussion.
The expected value for the emotional man depends on
the output of an anger-function. That function evaluates the
current attributional categories of the situation description
according to their emotional implications for the agent. If an
action decreases the agent’s anger, its expected value is 2. If
the agent can even strongly decrease it, the value is 3. In case
an action would increase its anger instead, the anger-function
returns -1 and if an action does not affect the anger at all, the
yielded value is 0. Table III shows the results of the anger-
function.

Finally, the identity keeper is a genuine content producer.
This type of agent has the goal of bringing forward any kind of
discussion in order to maintain its participation in it. That is,
the agent can strengthen its identity by providing arguments for
other agents to react to. For that purpose, any kind of Tweet can
be appropriate, especially controversial ones if they provoke
reactions. Only remaining inactive weakens that identity. As
a result, the identity keeper represents a user who enjoys a
conversation for the sake of the conversation and who ensures
a certain diversity of perspectives on the discussed topic. Thus,
the expected value for the identity keeper is deﬁned as follows:

By combining the described actor type models within indi-
vidual agents, it is possible to represent mixed motivations and
to implement a wide variety of decision behaviors. Moreover,
heterogeneous populations of different agent types will lead to
complex interactions of these behaviors. The following section
evaluates these effects.
V.
EVALUATION: SIMULATION OF USER BEHAVIOR
As a proof of concept for our agent-based modeling ap-
proach, we have implemented the aforementioned agent types
and decision-making algorithms in a JAVA program. In the
following, we use that program to simulate user behaviors
emerging from different populations of various agents. Such
a simulation gives a ﬁrst impression of the range of effects
that the model can (re)-produce. In particular, it allows for
analyzing the interplay between several actor types on both
the individual and the population level. In addition, the results
of a sensitivity analysis are presented, which provides detailed
insights in how variations of the input parameters affect the
behavior of the agents in the model.
In our simulation, we compare two different settings. The
ﬁrst one consists of a homogeneous agent population with
mixed actor types. That is, each agent combines all four
types with equal weights. By contrast, the second setting
comprises a heterogeneous agent population in which every
agent implements one of the four basic actor types. Throughout
the population, these agents are uniformly distributed. They
communicate about all eight scenes. Their respective activity
choices depend on the situation description for those scenes as
well as on the previous actions of other agents.
For both settings, the population size is set to 164 agents
that can join the conversation in each scene (as in the real
world dataset). This number is relevant as long as the homo
economicus uses a ﬁxed conversation size threshold. The more
agents there are, the sooner will a homo economicus impact the
communication dynamics. While the threshold can be scaled

Figure 5. Homo Sociologicus
up or down according to the population size, we use the
realistic one to enable comparisons of our simulation results
with that dataset in future studies.
Figure 3 shows the arithmetic mean of our evaluation
results together with the respective standard deviations out
of 100 simulation repetitions (except for the “No Tweet”
option). For the homogeneous population, the results show a
majority of negative not joking Tweets. This is due to the fact
that both identity keeper and homo economicus consider this
activity as adequate. Moreover, the emotional man favors it
over all others. Combining these within the agents leads to
the observed uniformity, which even becomes ampliﬁed as the
homo sociologicus imitates dominant behaviors. Only scene
4 leads to negative as well as positive Tweets. That scene is
described as being funny. Hence, the positive actions favored
by all other actor types override the negative option selected
by the emotional man.
Contrastingly, the heterogeneous population leads to more
diverse behavior. In that case, negative Tweets are still preva-
lent for most scenes. This is caused by the same effects
as described: The homo sociologicus ampliﬁes the behavior
being initially driven by the other actor types, particularly
the emotional man. However, since these agent types act
simultaneously in a mixed population, all other actions are also
observable. This leads to realistic effects, such as decisions not
to tweet at all in scenes being described as thrilling.
After analyzing the interplay between different actor types,
the behavior of each individual actor type is evaluated with
respect to the identiﬁcation of potential factors that inﬂuence
its behavior. To investigate how different inputs of the simu-
lation model inﬂuence the observed communication behavior
of the actors, sensitivity analysis can be applied [39]. For this
purpose, different parameter conﬁgurations must be simulated
such that the inﬂuence of variations can be observed. In the
presented simulation model, three different types of actors can
be speciﬁed as parametrization of the model, which are then
used to generate the population. The character of each actor
is deﬁned as a combination of the four presented motivations,
i.e., homo economicus, homo sociologicus, emotional man, and
identity keeper. As the sum of all motivations must be equal
to 100%, each agent must embody all four motivations, and as
motivations can be deﬁned in 10% steps, a total number of 79
different agent speciﬁcations is possible. To investigate how
different motivations inﬂuence the communication dynamics
of the actors, only scenarios that consist of a single agent type
are considered. By this means, interactions between different
agent types can be avoided and unbiased results are generated.
The results of the conducted sensitivity analysis are pre-
sented in Figure 4 - 7. Separated by the four presented
motivations and for each possible message type, the number
of tweeted messages is presented. To illustrate the distribution
of the results, boxplots are used, which visualize the median
value (bold line) as well as the range in which the middle
50% of the observed data fall (box). On each side of the box,
antennas visualize 1,5 times the interquartile range and outliers
that fall outside this range are marked as circles.
The behavior of homo economicus, a casual media user, can
be described as balanced compared to the behavior observed
from agents with other motivations. The number of joking
tweets, regardless whether they are positive or negative, is

considerably lower than the number of not joking tweets
(median of number of joking tweets <25 compared to median
of number of not joking tweets >40). Compared to the
three other motivations, the number of tweets sent by homo
economicus remains steady when the ratio of this motivation
increases from 10% to 70%. Only the number of negative not
joking tweets increases (approx. 25%) as the ratio of homo
economicus exceeds 50% and the number of positive not joking
tweets decreases slightly (approx. 5%).
In contrast to homo economicus, the impact of the ratio of
homo sociologicus on the number of tweeted messages is much
higher. For positive not joking messages, a total increase of
more than 25% can be observed while the ratio increases from
10% to 70%. Also for negative not joking tweets, an impact
of the ratio of homo sociologicus can be observed. Yet, after
an initial increase of the number of tweets, a decrease occurs
as the ratio exceeds 30%. Considering the number of joking
messages, an even stronger inﬂuence of the ratio of homo
sociologicus can be identiﬁed. For positive joking messages, a
total increase of almost 300% and for negative joking messages
a total decrease from 25 to 0 messages occurs. Summarizing
it can be said that an increasing ratio of homo sociologicus
results in an increase of the number of positive tweets, both
joking and not joking, in favor of a decrease of the number of
negative tweets.
The communication dynamics observed as the ratio of
emotional man increases are diverse. An increasing ratio
results in a decreasing number of positive joking tweets (-
40%). The amount of positive not joking tweets decreases as
the ratio increases from 10% to 20%. From this ratio onward
to a ratio of 70%, no considerable decrease can be observed.
The number of negative tweets, in contrast, increases as the
ratio of emotional man increases. While an increasing number
of negative joking tweets can be observed for a ratio between
40% and 60%, no steady behavior can be observed for the
number of negative not joking tweets. Instead, the number of
messages increases ﬁrst and then decreases again.
Finally, the inﬂuence of the identity keeper is similar to the
one of homo economicus. Considering the amount of positive
joking, positive not joking, and negative joking messages,
neither an increase not a decrease can be observed as the
ratio increases. Only the number of negative not joking tweets
increases slightly (<25%) as the ratio increases from 50% to
70%.
Summarizing, both homo economicus and identity keeper
positively affect the number of negative not joking tweets.
Further impacts that can be identiﬁed are an increasing number
of positive joking tweets for a high ratio of homo sociologicus
as well as a deceasing number of positive joking tweets
for a low ratio of emotional man. The amount of positive
not joking tweets as well as of negative not joking tweets
can mostly be attributed to homo sociologicus as well. This
observation is supplemented by the positive impact high ratios
of homo economicus and identity keeper have on the number of
negative not joking messages. Overall, the observed behavior
corresponds to the sociological theories presented in Section
II-C. Homo economicus behaved efﬁciently and did not write
more messages as its ratio increased. The norms of homo
sociologicus mainly lead to positive messages, however, also
some negative not joking messages are sent which can be

attributed to the judgmental parts of the television program.
The behavior of the emotional man is a result of emotional
implications, which explains the increasing amount of negative
messages as the ratio increases. Finally, the communication
behavior of the identity keeper is not related to the content
and rather to social aspects. Hence, messages sent by this actor
type are mainly not joking.
Overall, these results presented in this evaluation show that
the combination of actor types both within individual agents
and their mixing in heterogeneous populations drastically
impacts the emergent dynamics of simulated social media com-
munication. This demonstrates that modeling motivations of
individual agents can produce behavioral heterogeneity, which
other models have to introduce artiﬁcially, e.g., by means of
random noise [34]. In contrast to those approaches, we can
directly control, which type of agent reacts to which particular
communicative situation in what manner. The composition of
an agent population then models the afﬁnity or aversion of a
user group in social media to certain topics, opinions, and
communication styles. Hence, we conclude that our model
adds this composition of populations as an important variable
to existing methods for studying information diffusion in social
simulations.
However, it is important to select and calibrate the agent
types carefully for such a simulation to yield meaningful
results for understanding user behavior. To that end, it is nec-
essary to analyze available real world data and identify typical
activity patterns [4]. Then, potential underlying motivations
can be derived from those observations in order to deﬁne the
required actor types and their combinations [7] [20]. With this
work, we have shown how such actor types can be modeled
for exploring user behavior in agent-based social simulations.
VI.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have developed an agent-based model
of user behavior in social media. This model facilitates dy-
namic analyses of complex communication processes, which
are difﬁcult to assess by means of conventional approaches.
In such a context, agent-based social simulations allow for
experimentally exploring emergent behaviors [4].
Our model focuses primarily on the decision-making of
social actors communicating about a speciﬁc topic. This is
in contrast to existing work on information diffusion, which
analyzes the impacts of social network structures on the
spread of messages. Instead, we have modeled motivational
causes for user behaviors by utilizing complex agents based on
sociological theory. To that end, we have presented a general
concept for representing and combining four different actor
types in agent-based social simulations.
In addition, we have applied this concept to model and
analyze Twitter communication about a German television
program. Our evaluation shows that particular combinations
of different motivations either within individual agents or
across an entire population drastically impact communication
dynamics. Therefore, we conclude that it is crucial to consider
these motivations carefully in order to realistically model and
explain user behavior in social media. Furthermore, the impact
different actor types have on the communication behavior
were shown by means of a sensitivity analysis. The observed
dynamics correspond to the sociological descriptions of the
respective actor types.
While our model provides a promising ﬁrst step to agent-
based simulations of social media usage, we consider both
extensions and applications of the model for future work.
Firstly, we are working on calibrating the model to accurately
imitate the user interactions observed in our real world ex-
ample. This will provide insight into the achievable realism
when combining the four basic actor types into complex
agents and populations. As a ﬁrst result, we have already
demonstrated that our model is indeed capable of reproducing
the communication activities of real world users [38].
Secondly, it would be interesting to integrate the agent de-
cision method with existing information diffusion approaches
[28]. This will complement those methods with motivational
aspects of why information is spread within a social network.
In that context, the population composition will provide an ad-
ditional variable, which impacts communication dynamics. The
various actor types can then produce behavioral heterogeneity
on a more detailed and explanatory deeper level than the
addition of abstract random noise to an equational modeling
approach [34].
Finally, it will also be necessary to model the activity
options for the agents in more detail. This covers particularly
the message contents. In order to simulate, e.g., the shaping of
opinions in political discourses, a classiﬁcation of communi-
cation contents and their impact on the interaction is required.
To achieve this, we plan to utilize content modeling and
annotation techniques from media and communication studies
[40] for encoding discourses in agent-based social simulations.
In addition to extending the existing model, we plan to
utilize the model as part of comprehensive simulation studies.
By this means, research hypotheses regarding the behavior of
the model can be answered systematically and in a method-
ologically sound way [41]. Potential hypotheses on the model’s
behavior that can be investigated in such a way include the
inﬂuence actor types have on the communication behavior of
other actor types or the identiﬁcation of actions that inﬂuence
communication dynamics in a speciﬁc way.
