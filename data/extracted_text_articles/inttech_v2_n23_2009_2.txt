 Abstract−In management research, the long 
tail phenomenon is typically linked to the long-
tail 
of 
product 
demand 
distribution, 
particularly 
under 
electronic 
distribution, 
storing and consumption of content. This 
article discusses the role of open mobile 
software platforms in creating a market for 
niche mobile applications. Open software 
platforms of smartphones facilitate innovation 
around new applications. This study makes a 
hypothesis that open software platforms are 
boosting 
the 
use 
of 
niche 
applications. 
Empirical data on smartphone usage is 
collected over three consequent years in 
Finland. The dataset of 1 145 smartphone users 
is analyzed in studying whether the long-tail 
phenomenon is evident in the demand for 
mobile applications. The analysis of usage-level 
data reveals that the application demand is 
more heterogenic in the newest panel study 
than in the earlier studies. In other words, 
though the top 5% of applications typically 
represent more than 90% of total application 
usage, the bottom 80% of applications (the 
long-tail part) already represent 2.10% of total 
observed application usage in 2007, whereas 
this tail is only 1.39% in 2006 and 0.89% in 
2005. 
Average 
usage 
activity 
of 
niche 
applications has increased. The analysis reveals 
a U-relationship between the number of users 
and usage frequency of applications, meaning 
that many niche applications are being used 
actively by those who installed them, suggesting 
that the value of add-on applications is high.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Chris Anderson introduces the concept of long-tail in 
his articles [1] [2], suggesting that though typically 
only few top hits or instances (e.g., top movies, books, 
search words) dominate the rankings, particularly the 
digital means of content distribution and consumption 
have opened the doors for niche products that face 
demand from only few people. These products, though 
outside of the top rankings, are significant in number, 
and together form the long-tail. The value of this long-
tail can be significant, because of the mere number of 
titles in the long-tail. Particularly in situations where 
the supply and demand of products is potentially 
infinite (huge variety), the long-tail is evident. In 
addition to Anderson, e.g., Kilkki [13] discusses the 
practical applications and mathematical modeling of 
the long-tail concept.  
 
Figure 1 presents the basic logic of the long-tail 
phenomenon. Few titles receive very high popularity 
(e.g., sales), but the potentially infinite tail of the 
distribution can cumulatively represent a significant 
share of total value and volume of the market. 
 
 
FIGURE 1 - THE LONG-TAIL PHENOMENON 
 
The 
mobile 
industry 
is 
undergoing 
a 
major 
transformation, as it is converging with the Internet, 
media and computer industries [22]. From the 
perspective of this paper particularly the increasing 
penetration of open mobile software platforms is of

importance [16], transforming mobile phones into 
multi-purpose smartphones. The birth of the mobile 
application market is the consequence of this trend. 
Independently of handset vendors or mobile operators, 
mobile software developers (3rd party companies and 
individuals) can create their own solutions on top of 
Symbian, Windows Mobile, Google Android or any 
other software platform. In essence, mobile phones 
have become programmable handheld computers, 
which have Internet connectivity, computing power 
and open APIs (application programming interfaces), 
providing prospective platforms for an infinite set of 
new mobile services and applications. 
 
The assumption of this study is that the creation and 
evolution of the mobile application market, which is 
constantly being induced by the penetration of open 
mobile software platforms, is changing the way how 
end-users use mobile phones. The key hypotheses of 
the thesis include: 
 
1. A long-tail of mobile applications is emerging, 
and the application demand is distributed over 
an increasing number of applications 
2. The mobile application market is more 
fragmented than earlier, there is more variety 
both in supply and demand 
3. Niche products can achieve high usage among 
the few who adopt them 
 
The research problem of this study is to find out 
whether empirical metrics of smartphone usage over 
time reflect these hypotheses. New empirical modeling 
approaches are developed in solving the problem [24]. 
 
The article first introduces the concept of long-tail, and 
then proceeds to a summary of the current state of the 
mobile 
industry, 
particularly 
with 
regards 
to 
smartphones and add-on applications. After that, the 
research setting and dataset of this study are explained, 
and then rigorous analysis practices are applied in 
studying the distribution of add-on application usage 
activity. Finally, the article summarizes the main 
findings of analysis. 
 
II. BACKGROUND 
 
A. 
Long-tail 
 
The long-tail phenomenon is first introduced by 
Anderson (see [1] and [2]). Anderson realizes that 
many businesses of today (e.g., Amazon) generate 
significant revenue by selling a high number of items 
in small quantities. Despite the market including a 
small number of dominating titles that sell in huge 
numbers, the digital age provides cost-efficient 
distribution and storing mechanisms to economically 
sell practically an infinite number of items, each 
potentially selling only a handful of copies. However, 
all together these low-selling items represent a 
significant amount of total volume. 
 
Statistically the concept of the long-tail has been 
known for ages. Many distributions, such as power law 
and Pareto distributions, experience a long-tail. 
Statistically the long-tail means a low-frequency part of 
the distribution following a high-frequency part. This 
low-frequency part of the distribution asymptotically 
tails off. Many business cases account for this 
phenomenon, as it relates to many things from sales 
volume to productivity of employees. For example, 
McKinsey is using its 80/20 rule typically in 
communicating various business-related findings [8]. 
 
What Anderson [1] [2] and Shirky [18] contribute to 
the existing literature, is the suggestions that the digital 
economy makes both storing and distribution of 
products 
(e.g., 
content, 
applications, 
software, 
products) cheaper, thus making it economically viable 
to provide much more heterogenic portfolios of 
products available for sale. In other words, the supply 
of products (in terms of number and variety of items) 
goes up. Given the heterogenic preferences of people, 
there will be a creation of markets for niche products, 
selling only few copies. These niche products contrast 
with the bestseller hits that dominate the rankings. 
However, due to the changing economies of supply and 
demand, the relative total volume and value of these 
niche products (making up the long-tail) is much higher 
than in traditional markets. 
 
In addition to Anderson and Shirky, Ken McCarthy 
[15] points out the impact of the Internet (and 
openness) and the potential emergence of the long tail 
phenomenon. The assumption is that all people have 
individual preferences, and there is (some) demand for 
a high number of products, given they can be 
economically provided for sale. For example, digital 
online stores, such as Amazon, boost the size of the 
market and variance of products sold, creating 
consumer surplus by simply changing the mode of 
product delivery [3]. In a later article [2] it is also 
suggested that demand side dynamics, such as search 
engines and recommendation engines, help customers 
to find niche products and to induce the long tail effect. 
The long tail has been discussed under many topics, 
from competition [12] to user-driven innovation [10], 
and from science fiction novels [9] to contrary effects 
of the Internet [7].

B. 
Mobile software platforms  
 
This paper follows the definition of Webodia [25] for a 
mobile operating system, which is defined as an 
operating system for mobile devices, meaning 
essentially a software platform on top of which 
applications can run. Software platform is used as a 
synonym 
to 
operating 
system 
in 
this 
paper, 
highlighting the platform functionality of operating 
systems. 
 
The key contribution of a mobile software platform is 
its programmability: in addition to default programs 
embedded in the system also new applications can be 
installed and used. The PC industry is known for its 
modular technical design, in which openness and the 
role of operating systems as platforms is critical. The 
emergence of mobile operating systems, such as 
Symbian, Windows Mobile, Apple iPhone and Google 
Android (forthcoming) are transforming the mobile 
industry towards more PC like evolution. Symbian is a 
market leader of platforms at Q4/2008 (65% market 
share), followed by Windows Mobile (12%) and RIM 
(11%). Symbian is mainly being boosted by Nokia (see 
Table 1) with its massive sales volume of converged 
devices. 
 
TABLE 1 - SALES OF CONVERGED MOBILE DEVICES 
Q4/2007 [6] 
 
 
Smartphones are here defined as pocket-sized 
computer devices that provide at least cellular circuit 
and packet switched connectivity, and run a mobile 
operating system. Smartphones can also be called as 
multimedia computers [17] or converged devices [5]. 
Smartphones access wireless networks through various 
radio-access technologies, such as WiFi, 3G and 
EDGE. Processing power and memory capacity of 
smartphones support advanced services, from games to 
office applications. Smartphones effectively combine 
traditional 
offline 
functions, 
such 
as 
personal 
information management or office applications, with 
online 
services 
such 
as 
person-to-person 
communications or Internet browsing. [11] Effectively 
mobile phones are migrating from communication 
devices towards computers. According to [11], today’s 
smartphones hold the highest potential in becoming 
multi-purpose devices supporting everything from 
communications to digital wallets and from personal 
data assistants to authentication/authorization devices 
 
Mobile software platforms are the key cornerstone in 
the transformation of the mobile industry [22]. As the 
user-driven innovation, open APIs, and connectivity to 
the Internet are the key factors of this evolution, 
smartphones together with open mobile software 
platforms serve as catalysts of the evolution. This paper 
assumes that the open mobile software platforms are 
creating new supply of services and applications. 
Independent and numerous developers all over the 
world can build new applications, and for example 
players of Internet and computer industries can easily 
port their existing solutions to mobile phones. Along 
with the increasing supply also increasing demand 
should realize, as the potential demand can better be 
fulfilled. The emerging variety of available mobile 
applications is defined here as the mobile application 
market. The mobile application market is created 
partially by the increasing number of applications 
shipping with new devices, but more importantly 
because of the programmability of devices and 
availability of add-on applications. 
 
The creation of the mobile application market could 
have two profound effects on the usage of applications: 
 
• 
First, it can shift demand to low-frequency and 
niche applications. 
• 
Second, it can create new demand by providing 
solutions that did not exist earlier. 
 
The purpose of the empirical part of the paper is to 
collect and analyze data particularly with regards to the 
first implied effect. The second effect is more difficult 
to study, as the size and length of the panel studies used 
for data collection in this study are different, and 
therefore the absolute number of identified applications 
does not necessarily communicate the absolute domain 
of demand. In addition, the micro-level analysis 
perspective of this study is suitable particularly for 
relative comparisons (the first implied effect above). 
 
 
 
III. ANALYSIS 
 
A. 
Research setting 
 
A handset-based end-user research method is used in 
the empirical analysis of this paper [20]. This research 
229
International Journal on Advances in Internet Technology, vol 2 no 2&3, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/

 
 
 
method is developed over the years to study the 
behavior of mobile end-users using smartphones. The 
research method includes a handset-based client, that 
observes usage-level events (e.g., application sessions), 
and transmits this data to centralized research servers at 
predefined intervals. In addition, various web-based 
surveys can be deployed through the research platform.  
 
The handset-based end-user research is structured as 
panel studies, which typically include a few hundred 
consumers from each geographical market for a period 
of 1-2 months. The advantages of the platform are the 
combination of subjective survey and objective usage-
level data, observations of real end-user behavior, and 
accuracy as well as variety of data points available. 
The shortcomings include the effort of arranging panel 
studies, and adverse selection of panelists (only early-
adopters can be studied because of the requirement of 
owning a smartphone). 
 
The dataset of this study include three panel studies, 
arranged in a similar manner in three consequent years 
in Finland 2005-2007 (for the reports of the studies, see 
[14]; [21] and [23]). Only panelists with a self-
purchased device are included in the dataset. This is 
because handset bundling in Finland is bringing 
smartphones to more mass-market oriented people, 
which can be hypothesized to form a different type of 
market (in terms of tech-savvy nature) from 
smartphone self-purchasers [22] [19]. 500, 369 and 276 
Finnish early-adopter consumers (equipped with 
Symbian smartphones) are studied in years 2005, 2006 
and 2007, respectively. In the analysis of the data, each 
application usage session of the panelists is identified, 
and analyzed with standardized data mining methods. 
For each application several metrics are calculated, 
ranging from number of trial users to number of active 
users, and from average time spent per day to average 
number of weekly application activations. All in all, 
359 744, 251 749 and 138 636 application activations 
are observed in the panels of 2005, 2006 and 2007, 
respectively. 
 
B. 
Usage of mobile applications 
 
Usage-level data (applications usage) is available from 
three years. In addition, a special add-on application 
survey is conducted during the smartphone panel study 
of 2007. Panelists are asked several questions 
regarding add-on application installation and usage. 
Appendix A provides the results of the questionnaire. 
All in all, 84% of panelists have installed add-on 
applications to the device, and 35% claim to install 
applications frequently. The most typical way to install 
applications is to download from the Internet with 
computer (70% of those who installed applications), 
and to install then the application from computer to 
mobile phone via USB (66%). 57% of those who have 
installed applications, have downloaded applications 
directly with a mobile phone. The Internet is the best 
source of information when looking for applications 
(85% of those who have installed applications browse 
the Internet with computer when looking for 
information). 42% of those who installed applications 
have heard of new applications from friends or family. 
The most typical reason for not installing more 
applications is the lack of interesting applications in the 
market (62% of those who have installed applications 
blame this). 31% blame the prices, but only less than 
20% blame the difficulty of installation or search. 76% 
of panelists have a positive attitude for an advertising-
based delivery of content and applications. Handset 
vendors and operators are still considered as the most 
important actors among the producers of applications 
(31%, 26%, 10% and 6% consider vendors, operators, 
Internet companies and media companies as very 
important 
actors 
in 
mobile 
service 
delivery, 
respectively). See Appendix A for details. 
 
The usage-based dataset of three years is first 
processed with standardized data mining processes. 
The raw data consists of accurate traces of each 
application usage session of each panelist over the 
panel period, and the data is available from all of the 
three annual panel studies. Voice calls are not studied 
here, and the focus is solely on smartphone 
applications. In the data mining process, average 
activation times per day and average usage frequencies 
(share of days when used) are calculated for each 
application and for each user. This data is further 
linked to separate application mapping files (see [20]) 
that map each application into a distinct functional 
category. Based on the data also the number of users 
for each application is calculated. Table 2 illustrates 
some of the key descriptive statistics of the dataset. All 
in all, the number of panelists without a bundled 
subscription (the requirement for the panelist to be 
included in the dataset) is not that high for the newest 
panel than earlier. However, significant amount of data 
is collected each year. The average usage activity (in 
activations per day) and distribution of application 
activations among the different types of applications do 
not experience significant changes. PIM (personal 
information management) corresponds to the use of 
phonebook, calendar and other daily applications.

This article studies the patterns of application usage 
and the structure of realized demand. Regarding the 
use of applications, Figure 2 plots the share of panelists 
who have at least once tried applications. All the 
applications are plotted in descending order of number 
of users (x-axis as the percentile). The figure 
communicates the diversity of applications that are 
used by end-users. All in all, 820, 752 and 404 
different applications are observed for the years 2005, 
2006 and 2007. The number of distinct applications is 
decreasing over time, because in the most recent panels 
the amount of usage data collected is lower than 
earlier. 
 
It is notable that the more recent panels experience 
wider use of mobile applications. In other words, for 
example the 10% percentiles of user rates (in share of 
panelists) are 3%, 5% and 10% for 2005, 2006 and 
2007. The share of panelists, therefore, adopting rare 
applications (outside of top 5%), is higher in newer 
panels. In other words, an increasing number of mobile 
applications are achieving high penetration rates 
among early-adopters. 
 
 
FIGURE 2 - ADOPTION OF MOBILE APPLICATIONS 
 
Next, 
more 
accurate 
usage-level 
profiles 
of 
applications are studied. Usage frequencies are plotted 
across user rates for all applications that have at least 
1% user rate (meaning that at least 1% of all panelists 
have 
used 
that 
particular 
application). 
Usage 
frequencies communicate the average frequency of 
usage in percents (the share of all panel days when the 
application is used), and user rates communicate the 
share of all panelists who have tried the application. 
Figure 3 plots the exemplary results for the applications 
observed in the panel of 2007. 
 
It is interesting to differentiate between three main 
types of applications. The widely adopted applications 
(group A; having a user rate higher than 50%; all 
embedded 
applications), 
less 
widely 
adopted 
applications (group B; having a user rate between 10% 
and 50%; almost totally embedded application that do 
not achieve high success), and niche applications 
(group C; having a user rate lower than 10%; almost 
totally 3rd party applications). 
 
 
FIGURE 3 - THE U-RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEAN 
FREQUENCIES AND USER RATES 
 
Though it can be expected that only few applications 
make it to the group A, it is interesting that many of the 
embedded applications in today’s smartphones (for 
example embedded calculators and notes applications) 
do not achieve the 50% user rate, and are instead 
categorized into less widely adopted applications. The 
most significant observation is the high number of 
applications existing in the group C, meaning that a 
long-tail of applications exist - including many niche 
applications that do not achieve a high user rate.

Many of the applications in group C receive high mean 
usage frequencies, meaning that those few panelists, 
who use them, use them actively. This means that 
though these niche applications receive a low number 
of users, these niche applications can still generate a lot 
of value to the end-user, assuming that high usage 
frequency corresponds to high perceived value. This 
inverted relationship between user rates and mean 
usage frequencies is here called as the U-relationship 
between the number of users and usage activity. This 
U-relationship holds irrespective of the panel (see 
Figure 4). 
 
FIGURE 4 - ADOPTION OF MOBILE APPLICATIONS 
 
Table 3 highlights the identified patterns in each of the 
application groups. Usage intensity is calculated as the 
average number of activations per day per user. 
Expectedly the usage intensities and frequencies are 
highest in the group A of applications. However, there 
are no significant differences between applications of 
group B and C. In the panels of 2006 and 2005 the 
mean usage frequencies and intensities are higher for 
the applications in the group C than in the group B. 
The number of applications that achieve high usage 
frequencies (>20%) is higher in the category C than in 
the category B, this holding in all panels. However, the 
number of applications is also higher in the category C, 
which forces the arithmetic means quite low. 
 
The descriptive analysis of this chapter reflects the 
diversity of application usage. In addition, it 
emphasizes the U-relationship between application 
usage frequency and number of users. In other words, 
the study suggests that though the application might be 
a niche item in terms of number of users, the realized 
usage activity might still be quite high. This gives 
support regarding the hypothesis of the existence of the 
long-tail of mobile application usage. 
 
 
C. 
Long-tail of mobile applications 
 
The hypothesis of this paper is that the usage of mobile 
applications is more heterogenic today than earlier. In 
other words, the distribution of total application usage 
should be flatter than earlier, due to increasing usage 
activity of add-on applications. Figure 5 plots the total 
amount of usage (daily usage intensities) over the users 
of the applications. The applications are sorted in the 
descending order of total usage (in number of launches 
per day). 
 
 
FIGURE 5 - TOTAL AMOUNT OF MOBILE 
APPLICATION USAGE (LOGISTIC SCALE) 
 
The figure reveals that the end of the usage distribution 
is very flat (the logistic scale is used for the purposes of 
illustration). Demand exists for a number of 
applications. Additionally the hypothesis of the study 
can be confirmed true, as the distribution of application 
usage for 2007 is flatter than in 2006 or 2005. In other 
words, the value of the tail of the distribution is higher 
232
International Journal on Advances in Internet Technology, vol 2 no 2&3, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/

 
 
 
in 2007 than earlier, though absolute numbers are used 
in the figure (and fewer panelists are included in the 
dataset of 2007 than in 2006 or 2005). 
 
Table 4 presents the analysis for each panel study. 
Generally, the top applications catch a significant share 
of total application usage. This is not surprising. 
However, the share taken by these top applications is 
decreasing over time. In 2005 the top 3% of 
applications (ranked based on total usage activity) 
represent 92.18% of total usage, in 2006 only 89.64% 
and in 2007 85.76%. The estimation of the total 
volume of usage in the long-tail part of the distribution 
(the bottom 80% of applications) reveals that in 2007 
application usage patterns are more heterogenic than in 
2006 or 2005, mainly because of increasing usage 
activity of add-on, niche applications. The total share 
of usage in the bottom 80% of the distribution is 0.89% 
in 2005, 1.39% in 2006 and 2.10% in 2007.

Figure 6 illustrates graphically the cumulative usage of 
mobile applications. As can be seen, in 2007 the 
cumulative distribution line is beneath the lines of 2006 
and 2005, indicating that a relatively higher number of 
applications are responsible of the total demand for 
mobile applications. 
 
 
FIGURE 6 - CUMULATIVE USAGE OF MOBILE 
APPLICATIONS (LOGISTIC SCALE) 
 
The statistics above support the hypothesis, that the 
long-tail of the mobile application market is not 
insignificant. In fact, it has been growing in volume 
over the years. In general, instead of the typical 
20%/80%, a modified rule of 6.9%/93.1% holds in the 
panel study of 2007, for example. Top 6.9% of 
applications, ranked by total usage activity, are 
responsible for 93.1% of total smartphone usage 
observed in the panel study of 2007. The analysis 
confirms that average usage activities of niche 
applications have risen, and the bottom part of the 
distribution represents more of the usage in 2007 than 
in 2006 or 2005. It is not possible to analyze the 
absolute size (length) of the long-tail in this study, as 
the panel studies are of different length and size (which 
affects the likelihood of observing applications). This 
relative comparison, however, confirms that the 
balance in usage between default platform and niche 
add-on applications is shrinking.  
 
Figure 7 explores the usage patterns of mobile 
applications. Though the total number of usage 
sessions in the panel is not that high for the bottom 
80% of applications (deriving from the rules of 
ranking), the mean absolute usage activity (sessions per 
day per user) is still quite high for many applications, 
as can be seen in Figure 7. The usage activity in 
sessions (application activation and consequent usage) 
per day per application user can be considered as a 
proxy for the value of the service, as it reflects the 
extent of application usage among those who have 
really adopted the application. Also alternative metrics 
for usage activity exist, such as absolute face time per 
day per user, but different applications experience high 
variety in this variable due to their inherent nature 
(consider e.g., music players against calendars). 
Therefore usage sessions were chosen as the key metric 
in this article. Although the total panel-wide usage is 
not always so extensive, the value of the application to 
an individual user might be high. This corresponds to 
the finding of a U-relationship between the number of 
users and mean usage frequencies. In essence, the value

of niche applications can be significant to the ones who 
adopt them, and this leads to the long-tail phenomenon.

FIGURE 8 - CUMULATIVE RELATIVE VALUE OF MOBILE 
APPLICATIONS TO END-USERS (LOGISTIC SCALE) 
 
Figure 8 reflects the value-creation of mobile 
applications. An average number of usage sessions per 
application per day per user are normalized against the 
total number of sessions observed in the panel, and 
then the cumulative sum of these values (assuming that 
observed usage sessions per day per user reflect the 
value of applications) are plotted against percentiles. 
The figure illustrates that the value creation of mobile 
applications is not that steep in 2007 as in 2006 or 
2005. This suggests that the value of mobile 
application usage increasingly derives from niche 
applications, the finding that is done already earlier in 
this paper with the U-relationship of application user 
rate and usage frequency, and with the long-tail 
analysis of Table 4. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
According to a survey study conducted in 2007, 84% 
of panelists have installed add-on applications to their 
mobile devices, and 35% claim to install applications 
frequently. 76% of panelists have a positive attitude for 
an 
advertising-based 
delivery 
of 
content 
and 
applications. Handset vendors and operators are still 
considered as the most important actors among the 
producers of applications (31%, 26%, 10% and 6% 
considered vendors, operators, Internet companies and 
media companies as very important actors in mobile 
service delivery, respectively). 
 
The study covering real empirical usage-level data 
from three consequent years 2005-2007 in Finland 
reveals that a U-relationship exists between the number 
of users and average usage frequency of applications. 
In other words, the most widely adopted applications 
also experience high-frequency usage from end-users, 
meaning that they are valuable to end-users. The 
middle group of applications, including applications 
that are used by many panelists because they are 
typically embedded in smartphones, do not experience 
very active usage on average. However, the niche 
applications, receiving only a handful of panelists, 
experience very active usage inside their narrow user 
domains, increasingly so over time. These niche 
applications therefore generate significant value to the 
particular end-users who adopt them. 
 
The further analysis of usage-level data reveals that 
indeed the demand for mobile applications is more 
heterogenic in the newest panel study than earlier 
panels. In other words, though the top 5% of 
applications 
typically 
represent 
91-96% 
of 
all 
application usage, the bottom 80% of applications (the 
long-tail part) already represent 2.10% of total 
observed application usage in 2007, whereas this tail 
was only 1.39% in 2006 and 0.89% in 2005. This 
change is due to the increasing usage activity of add-on 
applications. In the newest dataset from 2007, 6.9% of 
top applications represent 93.1% of total smartphone 
usage.  
 
The article finds that indeed the mobile application 
market is fragmenting, and end-users increasingly 
derive value from niche applications. This holds albeit 
still the top applications represent a significant volume 
of total smartphone usage. Value plots of the paper are 
based on the assumption that the observed usage 
activity per panelist reflects the value of the application 
to end-users. Based on this value analysis, it seems that 
the value is created increasingly in the long-tail of the 
application market. In this regards the mobile industry 
is moving towards the PC and Internet industries, 
where wide consumer choice is prevailing. The 
implication of this research is that there is a clear 
business case for developers who are targeting a 
selected group of subscribers, and not selling in high 
numbers. The value of the application (and therefore 
willingness to pay) might be very high for the selected, 
niche, subscriber segment.

Though the relative plots of application usage patterns 
confirm the hypothesis regarding the existence and 
relative size of the long-tail of the mobile application 
market, the absolute growth of mobile application 
market cannot be studied with the obtained data. This 
mainly results from the fact that that the size of the 
panel studies differs from each other and the length of 
the studies is different. Future research should attempt 
to collect data that is easier to control and compare 
against other available datasets. In addition, a more 
macro-level instead of a micro-level study setting 
(meaning more representative, bigger panels) should be 
established in order to follow the trends on the market. 
Future research should attempt to understand if the 
findings are a result of shifting demand or advancing 
technology.
