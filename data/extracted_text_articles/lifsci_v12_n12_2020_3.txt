Abstract— The total amount of lifted weights and lift 
frequency are moderate to strong risk factors for lower back 
pain. Measurement of carried weight is thereby of interest. The 
aim of this paper is to (1) present three novel analyses methods 
for estimation of weight during walk and (2) to describe the 
design process of the cost-effective research system IngVaL 
based on pedobarography. The paper will also (3) present the 
durability of the sensors. Motivations for choices in the system 
design are given for hardware, selection of sensor type, sensor 
implementation and calibration of sensors. To measure weight 
during walk with IngVaL, fifteen test persons made five walks 
each with a pseudo-random added extra weight. Three 
analyses methods were tested, for estimation of weight while 
walking, resulting in Root Mean Square Errors of 11.3 kg, 
7.1 kg and 6.1 kg respectively. The durability of the sensors 
were tested in an outdoors walking condition. It can be 
concluded that the IngVaL system shows good durability and 
that weight during walk is possible to measure with simple 
analyses methods.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extension of a conference paper, which 
reported a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 13.8 kg for 
monitoring of weight while walking [1]. 
There are numerous applications for analyses of foot 
plantar pressure distribution using insoles, containing 
pressure sensors, in the shoes. Examples are gait analysis [2], 
posture analysis [3], humanoid robotics [4], evaluation of 
footwear [5] and footwear design [6], sports [7][8], stroke 
rehabilitation [9][10][11] and measurements during daily 
human activity [12][13]. 
There are several types of sensors that are used in 
systems for foot plantar measurement [14]. Four commonly 
used sensor types, that are used by researchers building 
pedobarography systems, are the capacitive [15], the 
piezoelectric [16], 
the 
resistive [17][18][19] 
and 
the 
optoelectronic [13][19]. Three commonly used commercial 
portable pedobarography systems, for respective sensor type, 
are compared in Table 1. 
Some applications for analyses of foot plantar pressure 
distribution need insoles with a matrix of sensors. But in 
some applications, when this is not needed, it is of interest to 
use insoles that cost less and have good durability to allow 
measurements in large populations over a long time. For this 
kind of measurements over time a pedobarography research 
system has been developed. First, a prototype version was 
designed by the authors. An improved second version was 
named Identifying Velocity and Load (IngVaL).

Pain in the lower back is one of the most common health 
problems today [20]. About a third of all employees in 
Sweden, during the year 2015, had pain in their lower back 
every week [21]. The year 2015, 16% of the employed men 
and 10% of the employed women in Sweden lifted more than 
15 kg several times a day [21]. The total amount of lifted 
weights and lift frequency are moderate to strong risk factors 
for lower back pain [22]. Measuring of carried weight is 
thereby of interest. A wearable system is needed to monitor 
work conditions over a longer time period and preferably 
also during walking. Sazonova et al. have been able to 
measure weight using a wearable pedobarography system, 
but 
the 
persons 
had

the 
measurements [17].

sensor implementation in the insoles and the dynamic 
calibration of the sensors. The paper will also (3) present the 
durability of the sensors. 
 
II. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT 
This system development section has three subsections 
called Selection of Sensor Type, Sensor Implementation and 
Calibration of the Sensors. There are two versions of the 
pedobarography research system, the first prototype version 
and the second version, IngVaL. The design process of the 
two systems are described. Block diagrams of the first 
prototype system and the IngVaL system are shown in

Four force sensors in each insole were selected and the 
signal conditioning was done using the FlexiForce adapter 
model 1120 (Phidgets Inc., Calgary, Canada). The sampling, 
with a frequency of 200 Hz, and the Bluetooth transmission 
were done with an IOIO-OTG (Sparkfun Electronics Inc., 
Niwot, USA). The IOIO-OTG is based around a PIC24FJ256 
microcontroller. A tablet received and stored the collected 
data. Software for receiving data from the IOIO-OTG is 
available for Android [23] and for Windows [24]. The whole 
system was built using commercial off the shelf components. 
A. 
Selection of Sensor Type 
Researchers have used many different types of force 
sensors when designing pedobarography systems and all of 
those sensor types have their advantages and disadvantages. 
Desirable sensor properties are low sensor thickness, low 
sensitivity for temperature change, low hysteresis, high 
linearity, good electrical stability and good durability. 
Resistive sensors can be very thin, have good electrical 
stability and no hysteresis. Drawbacks are non-linearity, drift 
of the output when the sensor is under static load and they 
can have problem with durability. Piezoelectric sensors are 
linear, robust and not sensitive to electromagnetic 
interference. Main disadvantages are that it can only be used 
in dynamic applications, the output from the sensor is 
temperature dependent and it needs to have amplification 
close to the sensor. Capacitive sensors have a large 
measurement range and low temperature sensitivity but 
special care has to be taken to reduce parasitic capacitance 
when connecting the sensors to the electronics. Another 
disadvantage is that they have a non-linear output. 
Optoelectronic sensors are not sensitive to electromagnetic 
interference but are often thicker than the other types. They 
can also be used to sense forces in three dimensions but they 
often cannot differentiate between the three planes. 
The durability of the sensors became a problem in the 
first prototype system. Occasional maximum readings were 
the first sign of sensors breaking down and thus those 
sensors had to be replaced and recalibrated. 
The model of the force sensing resistors in the prototype 
version were model ESS301 (made by Tekscan Inc., Boston, 

18

USA) with a 9.5 mm diameter of the active sensor area. The 
motivation for selecting this specific model was that it had 
good protection against humidity caused by perspiration. 
Larger forces can be measured when a small sensor area is 
used since the sensor measures the average of the forces 
acting on the active sensor area. Non-linearity is not a 
problem after calibration. Good availability and low 
thickness (0.2 mm) were two additional advantages. The 
durability of the sensors became a problem in the first 
prototype system. 
An additional measuring problem with the first prototype 
system was that the sensor area was too small, which made 
small foot movements inside the shoe a problem. In the 
IngVaL system the sensor model was changed to a larger 
model, A401 (Tekscan Inc., Boston, USA), to reduce that 
problem. It also made it possible to measure a larger area of 
the foot. Model A401 of the sensor and the signal 
conditioning adapter are shown in Figure 2.

The A401 model has an active sensor diameter of 
25.4 mm. The black circle on the sensor is the boundary of 
the active sensor area. 
B. 
Sensor Implementation 
The primary supporting positions for force interactions 
between the foot and the insole are the heel and the 
metatarsal pad (MTP), which is the pad under the forward 
part of the sole closest to the toes. The end of those bones, 
closest to the toes, are the metatarsal heads which are the 
bone structure for the MTP under the foot. The sensors are 
often placed under the heel, the MTP and the big toe, due to 
the bone structure of the foot and the possibility to monitor 
the forces from heel strike to when the foot leaves the ground 
again [25][26][27]. Sensors were therefore placed under the 
MTP and the heel, both in the first prototype system and in 
the IngVaL system. A fourth sensor was added to monitor 
when the big toe pad is in use since it is the last sensor to be 
activated during the stance phase (when there is contact with 
the ground) of the step. The four sensor locations are shown 
in Figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Sensor locations; small circles for the prototype version and big 
circles for IngVaL. A is the heel sensor, B is the outer and C is the inner 
metatarsal pad sensor, D is the big toe pad sensor. 
Mechanical stress on the boundaries of the active sensor 
area turned out to be the culprit of the sensor breakdowns in 
the prototype after investigating the broken sensors. Stress 
on the boundaries short-circuits the sensors and results in 
quite rapid breakdown. The first prototype insoles were not 
comfortable for the user since the interface material against 
the foot was made of polyurethane. This material is not good 
at absorbing perspiration but the resulting shoe environment 
did not affect the sensor functionality. 
New versions of the insoles were made for the second 
version of the system, IngVaL. The sensors were 
implemented sandwiched between a base of EVA and a 
protecting cork and leather layer of model 6949 (BNS 
Bergal, Nico & Solitaire, Vertriebs GmbH, Mainz, 
Germany). The leather interface, towards the foot, also 
helped reducing perspiration. Material was removed in the 
EVA base, under the boundaries of the active sensor areas, to 
remove any mechanical stress on the boundaries. The two 
sensors under the MTP were moved slightly more apart in 
the IngVaL version to better be able to measure forces close 
to the edges of the insoles. 
C. 
Calibration of the Sensors 
The use case for the system has to be taken into account 
when choosing the amplification to make sure that there is 
no saturation of the signal when measuring the largest forces. 
The amplification is changed by replacing a resistance on the 
Phidgets signal conditioning adapter. The manufacturer 
(Tekscan Inc., Boston, USA) recommends using at least four 
different force levels. The calibration function solves the 
problem with non-linearity. Sensor calibration was done by 
using five different force levels and repeated five times per 
force level. The forces were applied dynamically to avoid the 
problem with static load drift [28]. Polynomials of at least 
the third order is recommended for force sensing 
resistors [29]. The calibration functions for the sensors in 
IngVaL used fourth order polynomials, see Figure 4. 
A new calibration station was designed for IngVaL. A 
button load cell of model CZL204E (Phidgets Inc., Calgary, 
Canada) was used together with the Phidgets 4-input Bridge 
model 1046. The calibration forces were applied, by stepping 
with the heel placed on the top nut, to mimic the dynamic 
scenario the sensors are used in during walk. Using a static 
load would have introduced the problem with drift over time 
for this type of sensor.

Figure 4.  Weight in kilogram versus voltage in volt gives the calibration 
function (a polynomial of the fourth order). The calibration function for the 
heel’s force sensing resistor is shown as an example. 
A steel disk is placed over the sensing peg of the load 
cell to ensure a correct angle of the applied force. The angle 
is guaranteed because the steel disk is adapted to fit snugly 
on the peg of the load cell. An EVA disk is used between the 
heel sensor and the load cell to protect the sensor surface and 
to distribute the forces evenly. Metal spacers are added until 
the sensor almost registers pressure. Calibration forces acts 
perpendicular to the sensor area due to a minimized vertical 
displacement. The calibration station is shown in Figure 5.

III. METHOD 
This section contains the experiment and data analysis. 
The IngVaL version of the system was used in the 
experiment. The experimental study has a cross-sectional 
design. Three novel weight estimation analyses are described 
in the Data Analysis subsection. Ethical approval for the 
study was granted by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority 
(diary number 2017/070). 
A. 
Experiment 
Inclusion criteria for the fifteen test persons participating 
in this study were to be healthy, have an EU shoe size of 43 
or 44 and to be able to walk 1.0 m/s on a treadmill while 
carrying up to 20 kg extra weight in a backpack. The first 
author is shown wearing the backpack and walking on the 
treadmill in Figure 6. 
All test persons are university staff and they had an 
average weight of 83.9 kg while wearing the backpack 
without any added weight inside it. The lowest and highest 
weight, without added weight in the backpack, were 75.2 kg 
and 110.9 kg respectively. Each test person made five walks, 
using the same insoles and shoes, with a pseudo-random 
added extra weight of (10, 20, 0, 15, 5) kg in the backpack. 
Safety measures were automatic stop of the treadmill 
(Comfort Track Prime 97690, LifeGear Ltd., Taiwan) if the 
test person moved away too far from the correct position, 
and extra padding was placed in the backpack to protect the 
spine. A health insurance for the test persons was bought 
from the Insurance department of the Legal, Financial and 
Administrative Services Agency. Data was recorded during 
one minute per walk, excluding acceleration and deceleration 
phases, and a test walk was made first to make sure the test 
person was comfortable walking on the treadmill and that all 
sensors were working correctly. An electronic floor scale 
(model GS 42 BMI, Beurer GmbH, Ulm, Germany) was 
used to measure the reference weight for each of the five 
weight configurations with an accuracy of ±0.050 kg.

the IngVaL system and the extra carried weights. 
The durability of the sensors was investigated. All 
sensors were in good working order during these 75 walks in 
the experiment. The durability of the sensors was examined 
further by performing additional walking outdoors. 
B. 
Data Analysis 
Three novel analyses methods for estimating weight 
during walk were evaluated. In analysis method 1, data from 
the heel sensor was used for estimation of the carried weight 
while walking. The 200 largest heel sensor values during 
each one minute walk were averaged. In analysis method 2, 
data from all sensors were used to estimate weight while 
walking. All samples from all the sensors during each one 
minute walk were averaged. 
Fifteen test persons and five walks each resulted in 75 of 
these averages for each of the two analyses methods. For 
both methods, two averages (for 0 kg and 20 kg) for each test 
person were used to create a linear equation for individual 
calibration. The other three averages (5 kg, 10 kg and 15 kg), 
for each test person, were compared to the linear equation to 
see how big the error was. Thus, n=45 in the graph in the 
results section. An overview of the three steps of the data 
analysis are shown in Figure 7.

walking. 
Method 1 only uses the heel sensor and the other two 
methods use all sensors. The outputs from method 1 and 
method 2 are summed together in analysis method 3. 
 
IV. RESULTS 
The first analysis method used only the heel sensor for 
the estimation of weight while walking, and resulted in a 
RMSE of 11.3 kg. The result is presented in a plot of the 
reference weight, as measured by the electronic floor scale, 
versus the weight estimation errors in Figure 8. 
There is a tendency for overestimation, in method 1, of 
the weight with a mean of +2.1 kg. The second analysis 
method uses data from all the sensors and the mean is this 
time negative, -3.1 kg. A third method combining method 1 
and method 2 seemed promising since the means have 
opposite signs. The third analysis method simply combines 
method 1 with method 2 by adding the outputs together 
before the individual calibration is done. The results of 
method 2 and method 3 are also shown in Figure 8. The 
result for method 3 is also shown in Figure 9 for clarity. 
A summary of the results (RMSE, standard deviation 
(SD), mean, and upper and lower 95% confidence intervals) 
for the three methods are presented in Table 4.

Further durability testing was performed by normal walking 
outdoors. One sensor became unusable after a total of 
36000 steps. 
 
V. DISCUSSION 
The IngVaL system has shown to have good durability. 
A novel analysis method resulted in a RMSE of 6.1 kg for 
the weight measured during walk. The previous paper [1], 
which this paper is an extension of, reported a RMSE of 
13.8 kg. 
The earlier work was based on the equipoise method 
which used three sensors for the analysis and calculated a 
“neutral” point of balance between the forces on the heel 
sensor and the forward sensors [1]. One downside with the 
equipoise method was a very small number of usable 
samples for the estimation of the weight which made the 
estimation more uncertain. 
Three analyses methods have been presented in this 
paper. Method 2 and method 3 used all four sensors. 
Method 2 resulted in a RMSE of 7.1 kg. Method 3 reduced 
the RMSE to 6.1 kg.  
The reason for having as few sensors as possible is to 
reduce the cost of the system. The cost of portable 
commercial pedobarography systems often starts at €10000. 
The component cost for IngVaL would be close to €100 if 
the number of manufactured systems are reasonably high. 
Each sensor costs around €10 and this means the novel 
analyse method that only uses the heel sensor is a clear 
advantage. Method 1 only used the heel sensor and resulted 
in a RMSE of 11.3 kg. 
The analyses methods have been kept as simple as 
possible. This approach was chosen in order to be able to 
have the analysis running on for example a smart phone or 
tablet in the future. 
A recurring challenge, when estimation weight using few 
sensors, is that all persons have unique bone structures in 
their feet. Thus, small movements of the foot inside the 
shoes can result in big changes of the amount of force hitting 
a sensor. The approach of this paper to counter the problem 
of feet being unique is to do an individual calibration for 
each person using measured data from walk without carried 
weight and also from a walk with a large carried weight to 
create a linear equation. The larger sensor area in the IngVaL 
system, compared to the prototype system, also helped with 
this issue since a larger area of the insole is covered with 
sensors. 
All foot arch types have proportional distribution of the 
forces over all regions of the foot [30]. A possible source for 
errors in the weight estimation is that some anatomies of feet 
show a more increasing contact area, between the foot and 
the insole, when the person carries weights compared to 
subjects with normal feet [31]. 
The most used portable pedobarography system that uses 
resistive sensors, F-Scan by Tekscan, states that their sensors 
are durable enough for multiple trials [32]. This way of 
expressing the durability makes it hard to compare with other 
systems. Great care was given in the sensor implementation 
in the IngVaL system to improve the durability of the 
sensors. The durability testing showed that the first sensor 
became unusable after 36000 steps. The sensor had moved a 
bit out of position and this put stress on the boundary of the 
active sensor area. Possible ways for overcoming this 
problem is to remove more material under the sensor, and 
thereby use less of the sensor area, and/or embed the sensor 
deeper into the insole. 
Sazonova et al. estimated weight directly after coming to 
a standstill after walking, and reported a RMSE of 10.5 kg. 
Force sensing resistors drifts under static load and this adds 
to the challenge of measuring correctly when standing still. 
The drift problem is avoided when measuring during 
walking due to the dynamic loads on the sensors. Both 
methods 2 and 3 have a lower RMSE, than the system 
measuring during standing still. 
Since the total amount of lifted weights and lift frequency 
are moderate to strong risk factors for lower back pain it is of 
interest to measure heavy working conditions over time. 
IngVaL can measure during walk and this means that the 
system is potential candidate for this monitoring. Heavy lifts 
are of course not the only factor for lower back pain. A 
sedentary lifestyle or incorrect lifting technique are examples 
of other factors that also can cause back problems. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented three novel analyses for estimation 
of weight during walk and described the design process of 
the pedobarography system. The durability of the sensors can 
still be improved upon. Another modification of the sensor 
implementation can be done to stop the sensors from moving 
in the insole plane and putting stress on the boundary of the 
active sensor area.
