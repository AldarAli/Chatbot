Abstract—We live in a world of data, in a constant flow of
information. In business intelligence, data support a key role in
decision-making and innovation. Digital tools are used to help
business intelligence experts in research of insight. However,
these tools are often difficult to use for a novice and are not
fully adapted to every activity field. In this study, we propose
to
apply
a
user-centered
design
method
for
business
intelligence tool redesign. We have integrated the user as a co-
designer from the ideation phase to the evaluation of the
solution. We present here the developed method and the
mobilized tools necessary to generate a novel, efficient and
generic interface for business intelligence experts.
Keywords-user-centered design; data visualization; design
method; evaluation method.
I.
INTRODUCTION
With the Big Data advent, we are confronted with a huge
production of digital information. Big Data is defined as: "a
new generation of technologies and architectures, designed
to economically extract value from very large volumes of a
wide variety of data, by enabling the high velocity capture,
discovery, and/or analysis" [1]. Therefore, it can be
approached
in
a
technical
way,
for
instance,
with
algorithms, but it can also be addressed towards the end
users, their operations and their needs. This represents the
end-user approach that will be favored here, through the
user-centered design process. End users are strategic or
marketing stakeholders of companies from different fields
(such as aeronautics, pharmaceuticals, transport, etc.,) but
they are driven by a common aim: collecting as much data
as possible on their markets to adapt their strategy and
decision-making. For example, they want to visualize key
information during a meeting and show them to their boss in
a quick and efficient manner. We performed an intervention
based on principles of user-centered design [2] and using its
relevant tools and resources.
The context of the study was an intervention within a
software edition company. Collaborators were using a
business
intelligence
platform
including
complex
functionalities from meta-analysis to news reading. This
software was composed of several functionalities to share,
organize, analyze, collect and search information. However,
this version was restrictive, not intuitive and therefore not
fully satisfying for the business intelligence expert. In this
context, the company was looking for developing a new
software to improve multidimensional data manipulation.
We
identified
the
following
multidimensional
data
concerns:
●
The origin of the information: type of media, of
network, etc.
●
The
characteristics
of
the
information:
date,
transmitter, linked concepts, etc.
In this study, we aimed at developing a new tool to support
the daily work of the business intelligence expert and
improve the decision-making by allowing an intuitive
browsing within a complex network of data. To reach our
goal, we used the user-centered design method.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, we present a state of the art to define business intelligence
and to specify the human needs and habits in this domain.
We also identify the cognitive principles involved in
visualization and data processing to improve those activities
in an appropriate manner. Then, in Section 3, we define our
method of intervention. Finally, in Sections 4 and 5, we
perform a study to build a relevant solution for the end-user
and to evaluate and to readjust it quickly.
II.
STATE OF THE ART
A state of the art will first allow us to define the terms of
business intelligence and data visualization. In the second
step, we will present the research question discussed in this
paper.
A. Business intelligence
Business
intelligence
is
defined
as
a
"process
implementing, recurring and methodical devices to collect,
process and disseminate information to its operation. It is a
systematic activity, equated to an active environmental
monitoring"
[3].
Gathering
competitive
or
strategic
information for a company is a major challenge that provide
added value, and sustains the growth of the company [4]. To
this
end,
several
software
solutions:
Digimind,
AMI
Enterprise Intelligence (Figure 1), Synthesio, etc. have been
developed,
offering
advanced
setting
and
information
analysis of one or more topics of interest. The information is
valuable for decision makers and must give insights quickly
to push for action and to optimize decision-making. We
extracted from the literature a first taxonomy of tasks
governing information analysis. It consists of the following
categories [5]: Observation, Navigation, Manipulation and
Comparison to which we added one more: Restitution. We
translated
functionally these categories into
the tasks
performed by the user during the analysis [6]: Give an

overview, Filter, Zoom, Details on demand, Associate,
Provide a historical, Extract. After collecting a dataset, the
user will first implement visual exploration strategies [7]
and by then get new knowledge from the data by completing
specific tasks. The decomposition of these strategies gave us
a first insight of users’ needs to analyze data and to proceed
to decision-making.
Figure 1.
Business Intelligence AMI EI Software process
B. Business intelligence and Data visualization
This project is at the crossroads of two subjects:
Business Intelligence and Data visualization. We are already
familiar
with
some
theories
about
visualization
and
architecture information of a Human Computer Interaction
(HCI), for instance with the Gestalt Theory [8], whose basic
premise is: “in front of the complexity of our environment,
the brain will try to get in shape, to give a meaningful
structure to what it perceives to simplify and organize”.
Therefore, it was important to ensure excellent presentation
and organization of information, and to introduce visual
variables in user interface design regarding the user
perspective [9]. The laws proposed in Gestalt Theory guide
designers to arrange information in a relevant way. In
addition, the system acts as a guide for the user by intuitive
interaction, involving for instance icons and labels, mostly
known as “Affordance” [10].
The functions of icons and
labels
must
be
clearly
represented
and
quickly
understandable. For instance, we can switch a cursor’s
representation to indicate the possibility of "grabbing" an
object and moving it to another. Affordance is highly
attractive from the perspective of data visualization as it
facilitates decision-making and thus improves usability and
usefulness of the system.
To provide functional implementations based on user as
a human, we investigated cognitive sciences in detail. We
focused on the user’s needs to interact with a dataset and to
provide better performance. The Active Reading consists in
transforming the "reader" into an "actor" [11]. This is
possible by offering a degree of freedom in document
manipulation thanks to specific enrichment such as graphic
signs and text annotations. The user can actively read and
produce a modified or "enhanced" version of the source
document.
Thus,
during
a
second
reading,
important
information will be easier to find and draw more attention.
The
main
constraint
of
this
process
remains
the
homogenization of these signs between different operators,
particularly for the purpose of sharing information. Indeed,
it
is
important
that
all
operators
share
a
common
understanding of the codes used. The notion of Active
Reading is strongly linked to the concept of ownership
defined as "the progressive internalization of technical and
cognitive skills at work, in individuals or groups who handle
daily technology "[12]. Consequently, the daily use of
technology allows suitable changes by creating new uses.
This concept must bring designers to think about their
project in a prospective way such as we have done here.
Interestingly, it is common to say "I see" when we realized
something instead of "I understand” since vision is the first
sense we used, that provide us valuable knowledge on how
information is assimilated [13]. Graphical characteristics
(orientation, color, texture and movement) are seen without
effort. For this reason, it is a source of information that
promotes efficiency and should not be ignored. There are
many forms of presentations to be considered, particularly
movement that can be used such as a dynamic information.
We chose vision as a central element of our project so we
will be sensitive to those pieces of information during all
our intervention.
C. Research question
The state of the art has allowed us to promote the
importance of visualization and perception in the context of
business intelligence and manipulation of a large and
heterogeneous amount data. As part of this work, the
research question focuses on how to effectively adapt a
user-centered design method to design and evaluate a
business intelligence platform?
III.
METHOD
To define our intervention methodology, we used the
User-Centered Design (UCD) [14] [15], which is frequently
used in the field of ergonomics [3] [16] [24]. The project
was divided into four main stages, regarding the UCD
method:
1-
specify
the
context
of
use,
2-
specify
requirements, 3- create design solutions, 4- evaluate design.
For each step of the method, we mobilized tools that
allowed us to (1) introduce the users at the beginning of the
design process and (2) produce intermediate solutions on an
iterative and incremental way in order to permit their
evaluation by the users. The users were first introduced in
the design process as informant. Then, they became the
most important stakeholder during the design of solution
and its validation. These two phases were built on an
iterative manner. The user contribution was progressive and
participated to the success and strength of our intervention
(Figure 2).

We opted for a method close to the MVP (Most Viable
Product). This method consists of proposing a simple
version of a product with basic features and allowing it to
evolve using user’s feedbacks. It is an agile design
approach, which, if it remains close and keeps listening to
users, provides very convincing results [23].
After the presentation of the general approach we will
present in details the steps that bring us to the development
of the final solution.
IV.
EXPERIMENTATION
To reach a pertinent solution for the interface users, we
first worked with them on the usage context.
A. Phases 1 and 2: Specify the context of use and the
requirements
In this step of the design process, we drew from the
literature all relevant information to specify better users’
needs, such as the vision process, the active reading process
[11], the preference for dynamic information, etc. We also
gathered complementary and specific information during
users’
interviews,
about
their
preferences
on
the
composition of the modules, the importance of the analysis
page, the difficulties to use some features such as key
concepts, etc. Then, we realized a benchmark to determine
the add value that we can propose on this market.
Creativity
workshops
were
integrated
in
our
intervention.
We
settled
up
a
brainstorming
with
4
developers, 3 managers and 3 designers with the following
lead question: “How to improve the manipulation and the
interaction with Big Data?”
We focused on the two working axis that emerged from
this work: elements about the representation of information
and
elements
about
the
interface
interaction.
Recommendations were associated to these two axis and are
presented in the table below:
TABLE I. 2 AXIS RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations
Interface
interactions
- Save, export and share data
- Drag / drop of a value from a chart to
another,
allowing
zooming
to
obtain
more details
- Ability to lock the widget filters to keep
a scope unchanged, as a context of the
analyze
- Comments on data
Representing
information
- Multiplicity of graphics
- Filter display
- Widget layout
For the interface redesign, we focused on the analysis
mode because it represents the most difficult part for the
users but also because it covers the highest number of
interaction elements and information representation. Indeed,
interviews with users allowed us to identify difficulties
linked to the analysis mode as it is not interactive and it
does not allow the reading of several graphics at the same
time to compare and study the interaction between several
criteria (Figure 3).
During the analysis configuration, the expert has to use 3
tab pages to set up one analysis (Figure 4). Once again, the
presence of these 3 tab pages prevents the expert to have a
synthetic and global vision of the elements of the analysis.
Moreover, the language used is not adapted to random users
but only to experts.

A work of synthesis brought us to the first functional
prototype that combine insight from the literature and users’
interviews [17][18]. To start the experimentation, we
developed
an
interactive
prototype
with
a
dedicated
software: Axure, and implemented our solution on the
Analyze module of AMI EI software.

B. Phases 3 and 4: Create and evaluate design solution
During all prototyping, we confronted the solution to our
research findings to readjust the conception. The first
version was composed of functionalities such as save,
export,
share,
filter,
widgets
addition
and
also
new
interaction such as drag and drop. Although we made an
important research on users’ needs, we also included the
specificity of AMI EI to accomplish the business goal. The
evaluation phase started with a presentation of the prototype
to expert clients to gather feedbacks and advices about the
functional
architecture.
We
decided
to
include
“Recommended analysis”, working such as an analysis
template, to reach user of different expertise level. We also
included a rapid and simple way to access to the filters of
the analyze (Figure 5).
For the evaluation, we made two different tests with
different users: expert evaluation and end users testing.
Figure 5.
Screenshot of recommended Analysis page
1)
Experts evaluation
The
evaluation
was
realized
in
two
steps:
a
demonstration of the prototype and a test scenario. First, we
performed a demonstration of the prototype to five AMI
expert customers. During the recorded interview, the experts
guided us to a more fluent architecture. For instance, instead
of dissociating the family of criteria with their children, the
experts proposed a simpler way to present criteria all
together. They particularly enjoyed multiples widgets on a
same page, the use of a shortcut to add widgets and the
direct manipulation offered by the drag and drop interaction.
They also
raised
the importance of text document’s
consultation during analyze. Following this, we conducted
iterations and established a test scenario composed of tasks
such as starting an analysis, adding criteria to it, filter with
these criteria, dragging and dropping a value from a widget
to another. We engaged a second expert’s review and
received positive feedbacks and validated the overall
behavior with a second phase of iteration before user
testing. Each iteration phase took about a week.
2)
End users testing
Prior to the user testing, a protocol was written and
included:
●
The objective of the test: improve the navigation
and manipulation of a large dataset
●
The scope: the analyze module
●
The context: 1h of testing by ConfCall with
recording
●
Several scenarii, based on the information analysis
tasks: starting an analysis, adding criteria to it,
filter with these criteria, dragging and dropping a
value from a widget to another.
●
Material and human resources: AMI EI customers
●
Final questionnaire
The testing sessions began with a presentation of the scope
project and the objective. Then, the participants could
performed the scenario of tasks. In line with the low number
of users of the current Analysis module, we could only meet
five testers. However, their profiles were varied by their
level of expertise and by their work field (Aviation, Defense
and Security, Automobile, University Research). Moreover,
according to Nielsen, 80% of usability problems can be
observed with a panel of five users [19].
3)
Results
Two tasks, adding a widget and locking a graphic,
required a demonstration to three out of five testers before
the functionality can be well understood. However, all
features were considered useful and relevant. The more
popular ones were: plurality of widgets on a same a page,
preprogrammed analysis models, drag / drop, sharing,
annotation and export tools. All users also highlighted a
better
usability
compared
to
the
current
model
and
suggested some improvements to pass the next step with a
even more intuitive interface. At the end of each task, we
asked them whether the interface met their needs in day-to-
day job and all participants answered positively. Finally,
they had to evaluate the global interaction on a scale of 10
(10 meaning the highest score for the best interaction).
These feedbacks and score were formalized through the
final questionnaire (Table II).

Figure 6.
Screenshot of optimized Analysis page after final questionnaires
The different areas of improvement were specified in a
document restoring observations during user testing and
their recommendations and requests. This document was
accompanied by own specifications for the development of
the solution. Using "checklists", we described each feature
and each section of the interface [20][21]. We collected rich
feedback from users and the overall behavior can be
validated and new iterations implemented. The solution
continued
to
evolve
until
the
presentation
to
the
development team. We interviewed five more users, experts
in Business Intelligence analysis, and developed solids use
cases
helpful
to
determine
"who
(actor)
does
what
(interaction) with the system, for what purpose (goal),
without dealing with system internals" [22].
The stakeholders decided to integrate this module in the
new platform of consultation developed by AMI Software.
Therefore, with an input of his choice, the user can visualize
the following information:
●
its change over time in the collection of data
●
the set of documents associated to it within all the
documents collected
●
the set of the most relevant concepts lies to it
In addition, with all evolutions of the solution (after a
fourth phase of iterations) the user can:
●
Add a widget: the navigation bar was transformed
into
a
floating
button
that
follows
the
user
throughout his scrolling on the page without being
too visually ubiquitous.
●
Analysis criteria are gathering on "Perimeter of
research" and personalized according to users’
needs. The selection is quite free and sub-criteria of
a family can be chosen. The content is more
distinguishable too (Figure 7). The comparison
with the figure 4 and the settings of the actual
analysis show clearly the progress made on an
individual widget filters is also available and
manageable for customizable views.
We decided to include “Share” and “Save” on a second
phase of development. Preprogrammed models will also be
included later, as we want to build them with the help of the
daily use and a better knowledge on this need.
Figure 7.
Screenshot "Personalized my research perimeter"
We defined an included analysis interface in an existing
product and offered a simple interface with innovative
interaction and meaningful representation. This design
allows users (and even those who are far to be experts on
Business Intelligence) to manipulate information to prepare
a reunion with an important client or to make advanced
market analysis and to spot a trend.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The "user-centered" approach established in this project
gave an effective response to the problem “How to
effectively adapt a user-centered design method to design
and evaluate a business intelligence platform?”
The combination of a scientific and technological
research, multidisciplinary team and an iterative process
leads to a prototype that respects the model of ergonomic
Graphical User Interface:
●
meets ergonomic criteria (usability),
●
innovates in line with needs and goals of end users
(relevance and usefulness),
●
Supports technical constraints of IT developers.
Our project is also influenced by contributions of data
visualization and manipulation fields. The motion was
introduced as a vehicle for information first, but also as a
facilitator for handling this information (drag/drop). The
crucial aspect of information architecture was enhanced by
providing
smooth
navigation
with
clear
design.
This
categorization allows the user to adapt quickly to the
interface and to identify interactions. Through an analysis of
the professional activity of end users, we have implemented
innovative features and provided a relevant and intuitive
solution.
Ongoing
features
on
the
prototype
assert
the
stakeholders’ satisfaction toward UX Designer’s work.
Those features included more Social Media Analysis, which
is increasingly used in market analysis. Based on the work
of Wu, Rosen & Schaefer [24], it will be interesting to
determine how to detect communities or influencers in such
networks. Indeed, it is important to involve all resources
necessary
to
make
the
product
evolve.
During
the
presentation to the development teams, it will be crucial to
make sense and to attach a clear goal in each feature [25].
