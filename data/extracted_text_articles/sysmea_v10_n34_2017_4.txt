Abstract—The adaptiveness of Field Programmable Gate Arrays
is a key aspect in many mobile applications. Modern vehicles
contain up to 100 ”Electronic Control Units” in order to im-
plement all necessary functions for autonomous driving. Due to
the limited power resources of mobile applications, an appro-
priate implementation of power reduction measures is crucial
for achieving an acceptable amount of power savings. However,
effective power reduction mechanisms have to be applied to
the backbone of each Field Programmable Gate Array: the
look-up table. In this paper, we describe the implementation
and comparison of various Static Random Access Memory cells
and the related characteristics which are used as a benchmark.
All Static Random Access Memory cells have been analyzed in
order to evaluate feasible modiﬁcations for the sake of lowering
leakage currents and modiﬁed for minimizing static and dynamic
power consumption. The trade-off between low-power use cases,
a fast response time and area considerations as well as yield
after manufacturing has to be carefully analyzed. Therefore,
further aspects like signal to noise ratio and area increase due to
additional, required transistors are deliberated about whether the
additional efforts delivers desired results. Since speed in terms of
a high operating frequency is demanded by many applications, we
analyze each design upon its capabilities to run at their maximum
speed.

INTRODUCTION
During the last years, the number of classic desktop com-
puters used in domestic homes has constantly decreased. The
reason behind this phenomenon is the rising number of mobile
devices such as smartphones and tablets, taking over most of
the functionalities provided by desktop computers before [1].
Furthermore, upcoming features like highly automated driving
cars or fully autonomous vehicles require a high demand
for computing power. Whilst the computing performance of
mobile devices is improved constantly to face the challenges
of complex applications like video processing for adaptive
cruise control on long distance highway drives, the capacities
of batteries providing the needed energy resources have not
been extended in the same way. A modern, upper-class vehicle
contains more than 70 electronic control units (ECUs) to
provide all features desired by consumers these days [2]. On-
board communication networks like Controller Area Network
(CAN), FlexRay and ethernet ensure the communication be-
tween these devices, but also introduce a remarkable amount
of additional weight of approximately up to 30% (depending
on the used technology). In order to counter the limits set by
power consumption and overall weight, a signiﬁcant reduction
of the ECU number would be an efﬁcient approach. This could
lead to the application of more powerful processors, taking
over many of the functionalities from the large number of
slower ECUs used before. The downside of this approach
would be a higher power consumption due to higher clock
frequencies. A more comprehensive approach focuses on the
massive usage of FPGAs in mobile applications. Field Pro-
grammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer various advantages
compared to processors and Application Speciﬁc Integrated
Circuits (ASICs). Being fully conﬁgurable, FPGAs are well-
suited for the execution of various functions which have been
spread over several ECUs before, either purely by hardware
implementations or software execution running on a softcore
processor implemented on the FPGA’s fabric. However, FP-
GAs do not offer similar power saving mechanisms imple-
mented on microprocessors and lack of of a substantial power
management system. Power consumption saving mechanisms
shall be applied to series production passenger cars, which is
a cost-sensitive market, hence we choose the Xilinx Spartan-
3 low-cost FPGA as a baseline architecture for all further
considerations [3]. FPGAs play a major role for the realiza-
tion of adaptive systems. Partial, dynamic reconﬁguration [4],
supported by various FPGA designs, offer a vast potential for
fast adaption of the implemented functional range within a
vehicle, e.g., realizing a requested function by the driver and
disengaging a previously implemented vehicle function which
is not required any more [5].
In this paper, we evaluate selected Static Random Ac-
cess Memory (SRAM) cell designs on their suitability for
a low-leakage look-up table (LUT) implementation, which
are the elementar computational elements. Since the overhead
of reconﬁgurability leads to unused parts within the FPGA,
both static and dynamic power consumption are analyzed
for each cell design. In Section II, we give an overview
about a selection of existing designs and our motivation for
improvements. In Section III, we describe a number of leakage
reduction techniques and evaluate the feasible adaption on
current designs. In Section IV, we investigate the SRAM
cell designs on their assets and drawbacks and compare the
simulation results. In Section V, circuit improvement methods
for standby and active currents reduction are introduced. All
investigated SRAM cells are enhanced with these additional
improvements and compared again. In Section VI, we use each
modiﬁed SRAM cell to implement a 4-input LUT reference
design and explore the power consumption during the idle and
active state. The advantages of reasonable SRAM cell design
modiﬁcations are presented based upon the simulation results.
In Section VII, further timing considerations are described.
In Section VIII, all previous discussions are summarized and
concluded.

RELATED WORK
Various SRAM cell designs have been under research over
the years. Compared to dynamic RAM (DRAM), which is
widely used as main memory in many applications, SRAM
offers numerous advantages like quick read & write-cycles,
cell stability, data retention without refresh cycles, differential
outputs and many more. During the pre-Complementary Metal-
Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) era, the 4T cell [6] was com-
monly used for cache memories. Considering the additional
effort in terms of process variations for implementing the
resistor load and weaker signal to noise (SNM) margin, this
cell type was replaced by the 6T cell [7]. This design depicts
the mostly used approach for combining reliable functionality
with a proven in use fabrication process due to its CMOS
structure. Being the starting point for benchmarking, cell
variations like the 5T SRAM [6] design were developed to
eliminate the parasitic capacitance penalties of two bitlines.
Further derivations like the 7T cell implementation [8] inherit
the characteristics of the reference 6T design and provide
power savings by exploiting an effective writing mechanism,
putting no further requirements on adaptions to auxiliary
circuitry. Features like soft error rate robustness during low-
power operation have been explored in a 10T design varia-
tion [9]. All of these cell types have been designed during
research without applying additional, commonly used power
reduction measures. LUT designs have been evaluated and
improved on architectural level [10] for power reduction by
power gating mechanisms. New FPGA designs were presented
and compared to commercial products, by adding structural
improvements [11].
Our approach goes one step further and is based on circuit
level improvements to a LUT by reasonable selection of a
suitable SRAM cell design and substantial modiﬁcation of the
cell circuitry to achieve better leakage reduction and power
savings. The improvements achieved on that level are essential
for important leakage current suppression and are an inevitable
step to be combined with architectural amendments.

LEAKAGE REDUCTION
Three major components of leakage currents can be iden-
tiﬁed for a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) transistor of
gate lengths in nanometer scales:
•
Subthreshold leakage
•
Direct tunneling gate leakageshown in
•
Reverse biased p-n BTBT leakage
Whilst the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) leakage cur-
rents can be neglected for devices exceeding 50nm gate
lengths, subthreshold and direct tunneling gate leakage currents
come into consideration for our design. Tunneling electrons
through gates oxides can be countermeasured by carefully
setting an adequate oxide thickness of each transistor. This
dependency can be seen in (1):
JDT ∝A(Vox
Tox
)2
(1)
A = µoCox
W
Leff
(kT
q )2e1.8
By increasing the oxide thickness Tox, the direct tunneling
current density JDT can be efﬁciently lowered to a minimum
stage [12]. Increasing the gate length Leff would have a
similar effect, but lead to higher effort in the manufacturing
process due to a change in one of the basic technology
parameters like the gate length of a transistor. Therefore,
this option should be avoided. However, the usage of multi-
oxide thicknesses is a technology dependent parameter and
requires awareness for the selection of a suitable multi-oxide
technology.
Subthreshold currents can be expressed by the following
equation:
Isub∝ W
Leff
e(VGS−Vt0−γVSB+ηVDS)/nVt)(1−e
− VDS
Vt
)
(2)
Equation (2) shows the parameters which contribute to the
overall weak-inversion current, ﬂowing below the threshold
voltage Vth of each MOS transistor in the circuit. Several
leakage reduction measures can be applied by utilizing these
parameters to design a low leakage circuit:
•
W: setting the width of a transistor as small as
possible leads to a higher resistance of it and therefore
to smaller leakage currents
•
Vgs: Gate biasing is done by applying a Vgs voltage
lower than Gnd, which turns the transistor deeply off
•
Vsb: Body biasing by tweaking the body voltage of a
turned off transistor
•
Vdd: Lowering the supply voltage mitigates or even
completely removes the DIBL (drain-induced barrier
lowering) effect, represented by η in (2)
In general, we can distinguish between two classes of
leakage reduction techniques [13]. Some can be applied during
the design, whereas others can be used during operation time of
the circuit. A reasonable extract of these techniques is shown
in Table I.

Energy efﬁcient circuits should feature multiple supply
voltages and at least a dual threshold approach. As shown
in Table I, these characteristics need to be added during
the development phase. Furthermore, additional techniques
working during operation of the circuit can help to con-
tinuously reduce the overall power consumption. Dynamic
(threshold) voltage scaling (DVS & DVTS), as well as variable
threshold CMOS (VTCMOS) circuitry are powerful methods
to overcome the side-effects like subthreshold leakage due to
progressive scaling to smaller technology nodes.
We analyze the techniques listed in Table I on their careful
combination and application to volatile (SRAM) memory cells
and therefore automatically to LUTs.

SRAM CELL DESIGNS
The backbone of each computational activity within an
FPGA is the LUT [14]. Typically an FPGA consists of
a sea of tiles which contain the necessary logic in terms
of LUTs and interconnection circuitry, shown in Figure 1.
Two different groups of logic can be identiﬁed: Conﬁgurable
Logic Block (CLB) and switch matrix. A CLB is used for
ensuring the feature of adaptiveness due to the built-in LUTs,
therefore it contains the LUTs and additional components,
e.g., ﬂip-ﬂops, multiplexers and basic logic gates. On the
other hand, the switching matrix is used for providing all
necessary interconnections to other tiles / LUTs in case that
more complex functions are requested to be implemented and
require a combination of multiple CLBs.

By putting a higher focus on the optimization of the conﬁg-
uration RAM cells, these efforts serve not only improving the
power balance of the CLBs, but also to decrease the switch
matrices standby leakage currents. For communication with
peripheral logic General Purpose Input Output (GPIOs) blocks
are implemented, which can be used for bidirectional data.
However, switch matrices and GPIOs are not subject matter of
this paper and will be discussed in later publications.
Depending on the number of the LUT’s inputs, a LUT can
contain numerous SRAM cells. For example, in case of a 4-
input LUT, 16 SRAM cells are necessary for the realization
of all possible input value combinations. An exemplary illus-
tration of a LUT is shown in Figure 2.
Since the memory cells are used for conﬁguration, they
are also called conﬁguration RAM (CRAM). Once conﬁgured
during the start-up phase, the content of these memory cells
would not be changed until the next reconﬁguration cycle. In
consequence, the static leakage current reduction is of higher
signiﬁcance for the overall power consumption.
The selection of a low-power SRAM cell design is crucial
for an appropriate energy-efﬁcient implementation of inte-
grated circuits. Many memory cell designs have been intro-
duced in the past. The common 6 transistor cell can be found
in most FPGAs nowadays [15]. In principle, this memory
cell consists of two cross-coupled inverter and two access
transistors, connecting the inverters to the bitlines, as shown
in Figure 3.
As long as M5 and M6 are in cut-off mode, the cross-
coupled inverters are isolated from the bitlines and store the

complementary data value at the output nodes of each inverter.
Data retention is ensured as long as a sufﬁcient supply voltage
Vdd is applied. Before reading the stored data, both bitlines
BL and BL are precharged to Vdd by a special precharge
circuit and the access transistors M5 and M6 are turned on.
One of the bitlines will be discharged to Gnd, whereas the
other bitline will remain on Vdd. The voltage drop between
BL and BL will be sensed and evaluated by a sense ampliﬁer.
For writing data into the cell, one of the bitlines is kept at
Vdd, whereas the other bitline is kept at Gnd. By turning the
access transistors on, the desired value is written. For this
purpose, a suitable bitline driver circuit is needed to ensure
the propoer execution of the writing cycle. Careful transistor
sizing is required for avoiding the cell to ﬂip during, e.g., a

read cycle. This cell design is well-elaborated and used for
years in integrated circuits. Its stability and reliability is well-
known and therefore used in various applications. However,
the power consumption of the 6T SRAM cell can be further
optimized by some modiﬁcations resulting in the SRAM cells
described in the following paragraphs:
1) 4T SRAM cell: A typical implementation of a four
transistor SRAM cell is shown in Figure 4. In comparison
to the 6T cell, a smaller are of approximately 30% can be
achieved [16]. Due to the replacement of all pMOS transistors
by polysilicon resistors, only nMOS transistors are used for the
pure functionality of this cell. Despite of the space-savings,
which could lead to a higher yield after the manufacturing
process, the realization of high-resistivity polysilicon resistor
adds additional technological steps to the manufacturing pro-
cess, resulting in higher costs.

Figure 4. 4T SRAM cell
The 4T (polysilicon) SRAM is a predecessor of all CMOS-
based SRAM cells. Lower stability, lower tolerance against
soft-errors and a more technically demanding manufacturing
process exclude this cell type from further considerations [6].
2) 5T SRAM cell: The circuitry of a ﬁve transistor SRAM
cell is shown in Figure 5. The advantage of this cell design
compared to the 6T reference cell is the availability of just
one access transistor M5 and therefore only one bitline BL
[17]. The connecting bitlines in each slice of an FPGA add
undesired parasitic capacitances, which underly the process of
charging and discharging during each read- and write-cycle
and lead subsequently to higher power consumption. A cell
design working with just one access transistor adds space-
savings. For a proper and stable functionality of this cell,
asymmetric transistor sizing is required, which may complicate
the manufacturing process and to modiﬁcations of auxiliary
circuitry like sense ampliﬁers, precharge circuits, etc..
3) 7T SRAM cell: The seven transistor SRAM cell is shown
in Figure 6, which enhances the 6T reference cell design by
an additional feedback transistor M7 and 2 signal lines R and
W. The idea behind this design is a write mechanism, which
depends only on one of the two bitlines in order to execute
a write operation. This can be also expressed in equation (3)
[12].
While the activity factor α equals 1 in conventional mem-
ory cells, the 7T SRAM cell reduces this factor to less than 0.5
by exploiting the fact, that most of the bits in memories and
caches are zeros [8]. The main asset of this implementation is

The drawback is the required additional control logic and

SRAM CELL DESIGN MODIFICATIONS
The simulation results showed that the choice of a suitable
SRAM cell design leads to a signiﬁcant impact on power
consumption of a LUT. In this section we present further
improvements on each cell design in order to achieve even
better power savings in this essential component. Since Xilinx’
Spartan 3(A) is manufactured in a 90nm process and has a
recommended internal supply voltage of 1.2V , we choose a
90nm TSMC technology library at an comparable operating
voltage of 1.2V .
Coming back to the proposed cell designs in Section IV,
we refer to the 4T SRAM cell since its compact design is of
interest for further considerations and performance comparison
to other design. The major drawback of the 4T SRAM cell is
the high-resistive polysilicon resistor, which should be replaced
or completely omitted in an improved cell. A possibility how
to bypass this drawback is shown in Figure 7.
The previous pull-down network (PDN) consisting of two
nMOS transistors is replaced by a pull-up network of two
pMOS M1 and M2 transistors [18]. In combination with both
nMOS access transistors M3 and M4 a stable and power
saving functionality is achieved. Instead of precharging both

bitlines to Vdd as a pre-step of the reading-phase, the bitlines
are ”precharged” to Gnd, due to the fact that pMOS transistor
are used as drivers in this cell. This saves power and ensures
compatibility with CMOS logic processes. Nevertheless, minor
adaptions to the auxiliary circuitry around the cell have to be
done, e.g., modifying the bitline drivers.
A. Test results
All SRAM cells have been designed and simulated by
usage of the Cadence toolchain and a 90nm technology pro-
vided by TSMC at an ambient temperature of 27◦C. The main
challenge to achieve comparable results was to develop suitable
bitline drivers, precharge circuitry and a sense amplﬁer. Careful
design of the bitline drivers is crucial for avoiding the cell
to ﬂip during a read cycle. All simulations are performed
with a clock frequency of 200MHz and a load of 600aF.
Conﬁguration memory cells used in a LUT are not supposed
to be written and read at high frequencies, like, e.g., memory
arrays in a microprocessor’s cache (up to 4GHz). Therefore, we
choose a lower frequency, nevertheless all cells have also been
successfully tested with a higher clock frequency of 500MHz.
All cell designs have been applied to the test circuit in Figure
8.

consumption without any further improvements, is done. The

Compared to the other designs, Table II shows clearly
the drawbacks of the reference 6T SRAM cell. Substantial
power savings can be achieved by the choice of alternative
cell design. For example, the average power consumption of
the 6T SRAM reference cell design is 927nW and about 3
times higher than the average power consumption of the 4T
loadless SRAM cell, which is only 334.5nW. That results in
power savings of approximately 65%.
B. Dual Threshold CMOS
Further optimizations can be achieved by the introduction
of high threshold voltage (Vth) transistors. High Vth transistors
require a higher VGS voltage at the gate in order to turn the
transistor on, which can lead to an increase of the propagation
delay within a signal path. Therefore, high Vth should be only
used in applications which are not timing-critical. However,
the SRAM cells in a LUT are used as conﬁguration RAM
(CRAM) and are pertinent for use with high threshold voltage
transistors. All cell designs have been modiﬁed and the simula-
tions were performed again. These modiﬁcations are limited to
the core cell only, the precharge circuitry, the sense ampliﬁer
and the bitline drivers have not been modiﬁed. The results are
summed up in Table III.

In comparison to the reference design of the 6T SRAM
cell, the introduction of the high Vth transistors adds power
savings of about 25%. The performance of the high Vth 4T
loadless SRAM cell is slightly improved and leads to energy
savings of approximately 10nW. In general, we can say that
this modiﬁcation improves both, the maximum and minimum
energy consumption of all introduced cells. For illustration
purposes, these improvements are shown in Figure 10 and
Figure 11.

Since the 4T loadless SRAM cells offers an excellent out
of the box power balance, the strongest impact of the ﬁrst
optimizing steps can be primarily noticed on all previously
already existing designs, especially the 6T SRAM cell. In-
dependent from the respective implementation, each exploited
measurement is positively inﬂuenced by the modiﬁcation done
in a step before.
C. Transistor Stacking
Transistor stacking, shown in Figure 12, which is also
known as self-reverse biasing, is a strong technique to reduce
subthreshold leakage current by raising the voltage at the
source terminal of each transistor. By constantly increasing
the source voltage VS and keeping the gate voltage VG at the
same level, VGS becomes negative at a certain point of time,
which leads the transistor into super cut-off mode and turns it
deeply off. Subthreshold currents are exponentially reduced.

At the same time, the body to source potential VSB
also becomes negative, since the body terminal of a nMOS
transistor is usually kept at Gnd. In consequence, the body
effect is intensiﬁed, thus Vth is tuned by that effect to a
higher level. This fact can be further exploited by continuing
stacking transistors in series, but the effect of subthreshold
current reduction becomes diminished with a rising number
of transistors. This technique implies a trade-off between
power savings and size ratio of the chip. Despite the gradual
technology shrink up to 16nm FinFET, on-chip space is not an
unlimited resource and should be used carefully. Therefore, we
choose to add two stacking transistors only in order to have
a reasonable compromise between leakage current reduction
and size-ratio of the cells. The simulation results are shown in
Table IV and Table V.

(≈ 12%) and leakage currents.
The combination of both techniques, dual-threshold CMOS
and transistor stacking, puts additional improvements to the
overall power savings parameters. Since most of the currently
available technologies feature dual-threshold CMOS, the fea-
sibility of this combination is high.

Figure 14. Comparison of average PWR dissipation between standard and

Figure 13 and Figure 14 display different characteristics of
the consumed power by referring to the values of Table IV
and V. The 5T SRAM offers a slight advantage compared to
the 4T loadless SRAM design due higher active and standby
intrinsic power consumption of less transistors when applying
stacking to a logic design. Nevertheless, the 4T loadless SRAM
cell still performs better than the remaining memory circuits.
Another interesting aspect to be considered is the signal to
noise ratio, which gives a benchmark about the margin between
the transferred signal or stored data inside a memory cell
and the inﬂuence of background noise on the signal lines,
which can not be neglected. This factor is even of higher
signiﬁcance when volatile memory cells are equipped with
high Vth transistors, replacing their standard Vth counterparts.
To investigate potential undesirable side effects on the intended
functionality, Figure 15 shows the butterﬂy plots of two 6T
SRAM implementations, each realized with high and standard
Vth transistors. It can be seen that this modiﬁcation has a small
impact on the signal to noise margin, but this is still acceptable
due to predominant beneﬁts in terms of power savings.

D. Dynamic Voltage Scaling
The higher the supply voltage is, the faster the operation
of the integrated circuit will be, since high Vdd allows fast
charging and discharging of parasitic capacitances. In case of
low demand on performance such as for CRAMs, the supply
voltage can be lowered while still ensuring data retention
within the cell. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) depends
usually at least on an operating system and a regulation loop
to recognize the circuit speed and to cover a wide range of
operating voltages. Our approach simpliﬁes this principle by
introducing two additional transistors, shown in Figure 16.
Both transistors M9 and M10 are used to connect the
SRAM cell to two different supply voltages, Vdd and VddL,
whereas Vdd equals the primary 1.2V. On the one hand, the
prerequisite of this method is a dual-Vdd setup, representing
a simple alternative to the mentioned operating system driven
regulation loop, and on the other hand, a modiﬁed power gating
approach is implemented. Since the 4T SRAM cell has no
connection to Gnd in its core, power gating is achieved by
the possibility to fully cut-off the supply voltage, if needed.
However, power gating should be introduced at a coarse-grain
level, e.g., by powering or switching off groups of cells at
a higher abstraction layer. By lowering the supply voltage
to VddL, which equals 1V, we can further reduce leakage

transistor sizing of an efﬁcient memory cell design. We present
the modiﬁed, loadless 4T SRAM cell in Figure 17.

which can be seen in Figure 18. By comparing the results
of Figure 18 with the outputs shown in Figure 9, we see a

LUT SIMULATIONS
The LUT was implemented with each cell type investigated
in the previous chapters. In order to achieve an equal distribu-
tion of bits, all memory cells have alternating bits stored and
are not connected to the bitlines by switching off all access
transistors. As a matter of lucidity, we present a comparison

between the 6T SRAM- and 4T SRAM LUT implementa-

performance in terms of power savings and leakage current
reduction than the 6T SRAM cell design does. By comparing
a LUT implementation with a standard 6T SRAM cell and our
modiﬁed 4T SRAM design, Table VII summarizes the results
and highlights the improvements in power dissipation, which
equals power savings of approximately 16%. Figure 22 shows

It should be mentioned that either the precharge circuit nor
the sense ampliﬁer have been optimized for power efﬁciency.
Optimizing these parts will lead to even better results and
raise the duration of a battery charge, independent of the
target application. Further optimization can be achieved by
coarse-grain power gating of CRAM blocks within the LUT
architecture. Unused CRAMs should be completely powered
off by adding additional, thick-oxide transistors, cutting off the
cell from Vdd and Gnd.

Figure 22. Leakage current of an improved 4T SRAM based LUT
The modiﬁed 4T memory cell design introduced in Figure
17 is superior in terms of low power aspects compared to all
other investigated cell designs. However, this solution requires
additional space, since it requires at least four additional
transistors to achieve its intended power-efﬁcient functionality.
VII.
TIMING CONSIDERATIONS
Despite the fact that timing aspects play a minor role for
volatile memory cells used for conﬁguring LUTs, a closer
investigation of, e.g., the maximum operating frequency fmax
is helpful to sound the limits of these circuits for their intended
usage. In special cases like critical real time calculations, fast
reconﬁgurability of an programmable logic device may be
a inevitable requirement. This maximum operating frequency
can be determined by (4):
fmax =
1
tHL + tLH
(4)
The summands tHL and tLH display the time necessary for
a HIGH → LOW and LOW → HIGH transition respectively.
Figure 23 shows a typical 1 → 0 switching event with
additional measurement marks at 90% and 10% of the supply
voltage Vdd, including the ∆ of time, which is considered to
be tHL. All considered SRAM cells have been investigated
upon these characteristics and compared against each other.
The correspondent results are summarized in Table VIII.

The results reveal the superior performance of the 4T
loadless SRAM in terms of elapsed time for both tHL and
tLH. In direct comparison to the reference 6T SRAM cell, we
achieve an improvement of ≈ 60% for the LOW → HIGH
transition. The improvement for the complementary operation
HIGH → LOW is less, but energy savings of ≈ 36% are still
noteworthy.
For having a better overview about the different slew rates
and maximum operating frequencies, all results were visual-
ized in Figure 24. The 4T loadless SRAM cell outperforms the

frequency gives an impression about the capabilities of this
newly developed cell to be used for calculations in critical real
time environments. It should be mentioned, that this designed
was not optimized for short channel effect suppression. The
recent proceedings in process technology lead to a continuous
design shrink, which come along with a signiﬁcantly higher
yield in manufacturing. The downside of these achievements
are undesirable physical effects, e.g., the short channel effect.
The smaller the channel length becomes, the higher leakage
currents in standby mode will be, due to tunneling effects
of electrons from drain to source even without establishing
a steady voltage VGS > Vth at the gate of a transistor.

CONCLUSION
We analyzed a typical LUT structure of an FPGA in terms
of power dissipation and leakage current. Our approach was to
integrate power savings mechanisms at the basic circuit level
before heading for further optimizations on architectural level.
Different SRAM cell structures have been investigated on
their power characteristics in order to evaluate the best design
for implementing a LUT, which features inherent low-power
characteristics. Simulations have shown that the 4T loadless
SRAM cell features the required properties. We applied various
low-power techniques and enhanced this cell for standby
leakage current mitigation. Hence, we presented a modiﬁed
4T loadless SRAM cell design. By combining dedicated
techniques during design time and during operating time, we
achieved a reduction of the average power consumption within
the LUT of 16% during simulation time. Subsequently, this
leads to overall energy savings of 127aJ compared to the
origin 150aJ of a 6T SRAM cell based LUT implementa-
tion. The leakage current Ileak is reduced dramatically from
1.741nA to approximately 0.2nA, showing the strong impact
of leakage reduction methods on power-critical circuitry. On
the other hand, the 4T loadless SRAM design offers very
fast reconﬁguration capabilities due to its remarkably high top
operating frequency fmax above 12GHz, which outperforms
the alternative designs signiﬁcantly. This goes back to a
good slew rate for each of both transitions during signal
processing. The overall performance of this design could be
further enhanced be careful adaption of the gate length to
catch up disadvantages in terms of short channel effects. It
can be predicted that this measure would further decrease
standby leakage current Ileak, but it would automatically lead
to increasing the width of the transistors to avoid any penalties
in speed. This would be acceptable if area considerations do
not play a role, which is rather unlikely due to a preferable high
yield at the end of a semiconductor manufacturing process.
All identiﬁed and investigated pros come along at the cost
of certain adaptions to peripheral circuitry, e.g., the sense
ampliﬁer, which needs to be redesigned for the usage with
this newly developed memory design. Additional wiring for the
DVS transistors is required which is synonymous with more
parasitic capacitances and area consumption. These challenges
have to be faced during layout phase after synthesis and
strongly depend on the chosen process node. Since registers
and GPIOs occupy a large amount of area in FPGAs, further
power savings can be achieved by adapting the architecture of
these circuits. This will be addressed in future publications.
FPGAs support adaptiveness of whole systems by re-
conﬁguration abilities on demand of the respective application.
The presented low-power cell design reduces power consump-
tion signiﬁcantly during the charging and discharging cycles of
re-conﬁguration tasks within an FPGA and delivers an overall
good performance leading to an appropriate suitability for
mobile low power applications.
