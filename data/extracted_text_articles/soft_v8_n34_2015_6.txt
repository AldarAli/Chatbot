Abstract—This paper presents the extended research conducted
for an implementation creating knowledge-supported dynamical
visualisation
and
computation,
which
can
also
be
used
in
combination
with
dynamical
processing.
The
focus
of
methodologies,
knowledge,
and
approach
is
data-centric,
especially concentrating on cognostics and knowledge. The
methodologies,
knowledge
resources,
data
structures,
and
workﬂows are very suitable for long-term multi-disciplinary
context
and
creating
application
components
for
the
use
with High End Computing. The core knowledge is based on
long-term knowledge resources further developed for several
decades and used with many applications scenarios utilising
multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual content and context like
references, associations, and knowledge container collections.
A major goal of the application case studies shown here is
creating context-sensitive dynamical program components and
algorithms from selected knowledge content. The selections are
results of dynamical workﬂows, which are part of component
implementations, e.g., including search processes and result
matrix generators. Previous research has shown that long-term
knowledge resources are the most important and most valuable
component of long-term approaches and solutions. Here, the
structures and classiﬁcations are used with independent database
frameworks and programming interfaces. The results show
that the methodological foundations and knowledge resources
are very well suitable as long-term core base, as well as for
creating dynamical application components, e.g., for visualisation
and computation in multi-disciplinary, geoscientiﬁc, and spatial
context. The knowledge resources can refer to any kind of
resources. The overall environment allows to develop and govern
extensive content structures and promote their long-term vitality.
The long-term knowledge resources and cognostics are an
excellent base for supporting dynamical processing sustainable,
economic, long-term development of resources and components.

INTRODUCTION
Many methods have been created for deploying comput-
ing and processing with knowledge discovery and dynamical
visualisation. However, conceptual knowledge and cognostics
supporting the creation of fully functional application com-
ponents has not been been considered explicitely. The target
in this implementation is multi-disciplinary information with
examples from geoscientiﬁc and natural sciences referring
to universal knowledge and reaching into many disciplines.
The secondary data utilised here can also include spatial
information.
Within the last decades the value of the content, the “value
of data”, has steadily increased and with this the demand
for ﬂexible and efﬁcient discovery processes for creating
results from requests on data sources. This paper presents
the extended research based on the creation of knowledge-
supported dynamical visualisation and computation, the results
of which were published and presented at the GEOProcessing
conference in February 2015 in Lisbon [1]. Applying the
conceptual knowledge and cognostics in this context, this paper
is especially focussing on support for data-centric approaches.
This research shows details of the latest case studies and
discusses the up-to-date experiences from the implementation
of the dynamical components and their integration with knowl-
edge resources’ structures and workﬂows. The case studies
especially consider the levels inside application components,
which can be created based on universal knowledge resources
and cognostics. The studies also discuss the conceptual support
for generators and some resulting features.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II introduces
with the state-of-the-art and motivation for this research.
Sections III and IV summarise the foundations and challenges
with cognostic components, Section V introduces the method-
ological bases, Section VI presents the previous research being
a fundament for this work. Sections VII and VIII present
the fundamental implementations, esp. integration referring to
knowledge and dynamics, discussing the foundations, architec-
ture, framework, integration, and dynamical visualisation and
computation. Section IX discusses selected parts of the imple-
mentation and resulting components and Section X presents
examples of dynamical cognostic processing in context with
knowledge and cognostics. These sections show the details of
the implementation and the resulting components, from geo
sets, computation to index selection and some views from
the resulting visualisations. Sections XI to XIII evaluate the
main results, potential and summarise the lessons learned,
conclusions and future work.
II.
STATE-OF-THE-ART AND MOTIVATION
The creation of long-term knowledge resources and utilisa-
tion methods is one of the most pressing goals in information
science as the masses of data and the loss of knowledge in
society are steadily increasing in all areas. Existing projects
employ segment-like spectra of disciplines in their focus.
Examples are large digital libraries and projects like the
Europeana [2] and the World Digital Library (WDL) [3]. For
most data, source and resulting data, it is reasonable to assume

362
International Journal on Advances in Software, vol 8 no 3 & 4, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/software/
2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
a data value at least higher than the funding value [4], which
motivates for increased efforts.
As existing projects, e.g., which are only concentrating on
bibliographic means, do not focus on such integration, use
different and mostly isolated classiﬁcations and schemes for
different areas and speciﬁc purposes. For example, there is
a small number of general classiﬁcations, which are mostly
used in library context. Although such classiﬁcations are used
in many thousands of institutions worldwide this is neither
a general use case or application scenario nor a signiﬁcant
share of the overall knowledge. They are missing to provide
facilities for arbitrary kinds of objects, e.g., factual data and
trans-disciplinary context in information science and natural
sciences. Therefore, the handling of knowledge issues at a
cognostic level is not reﬂected by processes for creation of
software components. Besides these major gaps in research,
shortcomings result regarding data quality, data-centric solu-
tions, required long-term aspects, and functionality of applica-
tion components.
In contrast to that, the state of the art for documentation
of universal, conceptual knowledge is the Universal Decimal
Classiﬁcation (UDC) [5], which is one of the very few
classiﬁcations providing a universal classiﬁcation [6], [7].
Besides public interfaces, the implementations of the known
application scenarios are not publicly available in common.
Anyhow, all known scenarios have in common that they deploy
only a small subset of available classiﬁcations and in the
vast majority the classiﬁcation process is not automated. It
is necessary to develop logical structures in order to govern
the existing big data today and in future, especially in volume,
variability, and velocity. This is necessary in order to keep the
information addressable and maintain the quality of data on
long-term.
Beyond the focus of the mentioned segment-like projects the
knowledge resources and concepts discussed and implemented
in this research focus on the trans-disciplinary integration of
arbitrary different segments and disciplines and a universal
usability based on factual data and criteria. The documentation
and context also integrates and refers to content and context,
e.g., conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge and
allows for a huge range of possible scenarios. This is a
driving force to extend the use of classiﬁcation in trans- and
multi-disciplinary context and transfer the experiences from
deploying a classiﬁcation for long-term documentation and
application.
III.
FOUNDATIONS OF COGNOSTIC COMPONENTS
The term cognostics is related to the Latin verb cognoscere
(con ‘with’, gnoscere ‘know, recognise’). This is in itself a
cognate of the Greek verb γιγνωσκω (gign´osko), meaning
’I know, I perceive’ (noun: gn´osis, ’knowledge’) referring to
‘recognize’, ‘conceptualize’. The archaic paradigm of many
aspects of ﬁelds of human activities is, e.g., a complementary
trias of animistics, empirics, and cognostics. Most cognostic
content followed prehistorical and early historical times, in the
later stages of development. Cognostic fundaments have been
discussed in detail by classical ancient Greek philosophers.
“Cognition” as a modern term at least dates back to the 15th
century, used for “awareness” and “thinking”.
Cognition is the set of all mental abilities and processes.
Cognition is therefore related to knowledge, decision making
[8], [9], problem solving, human-computer interaction and
many more. Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and
generate new knowledge.
In result, the implementation of cognostic views can be
complex, not only because of application components but
especially because of the knowledge-centric base, which has
to be created. A lot of following researchers have picked-up
the term, e.g., in context with diagnostics guided by computers
[10], [11], in an early phase of data exploratory analysis and
without developing a base for the knowledge itself.
The term cognostics has been more widely used with devel-
opments in information science since the nineteen-nineties. In
Geocognostics refers not only to dynamical components but to
different views and how to achieve this, e.g., how to integrate
political and social-cultural differences, which are examples of
major aspects to be considered.
The cognitive aspects of human-computer interaction are
multifold, especially in the context of geographic information
systems [12]. As one contribution to complex information
systems, on the one hand, the accuracy of spatial databases is
an important factor [13] but on the other hand it is important
that researchers and users can create cognitive collages and
spatial mental models [14]. Besides that, the integration of
psychological aspects of spatial information [15] as well as
the consideration of cultural aspects [16] has become sig-
niﬁcant for several decades. This has led to the concepts of
cognitive geographic information systems [17] and the idea
of geocognostics [18]. These fundamental concepts have led
to implementations considering cognostics with dynamical
features [19] and collaboration frameworks [20], resulting in
modular cognostic component concepts [21] and knowledge
based approaches and implementations [22], e.g., the new
concept of object carousels.
IV.
CHALLENGES WITH KNOWLEDGE AND COGNOSTICS
The insufﬁcient care for knowledge has shown to have
impact on scientiﬁc work [23] and most achievements have
to be created over and over again [24] as well as on industrial
developments and automation [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].
Data collections can provide any huge amount of infor-
mation, directly and in consequence of applied workﬂows.
The more unstructured the data collections are the more
interpretation of the data are possible. Automated processes
can then easily lead to a much higher rate of misinterpretation.
Examples of misinterpretation [31] and unclean data [32],
which can regulary result when not integrating high quality
knowledge resources have led to suggestions and recommen-
dations that raw data might take enormous efforts to clean,
reformat, and consolidate but is very well worth. In spite of
the quantity of data [33] bigger does not mean better. For many
cases big data has been claimed a ‘big misnomer’ [34].
The quality of data cannot be neglected especially when
creating sustainable structures, long-term documentations and

363

solutions. Some analysis considers data size being important
on the one hand, e.g., volume of data. On the other hand, small
volumes of data can have a large signiﬁcance, examples are
the following:
•
Non-standard mean data like outliers can be signiﬁcant
for working with problems and data.
•
Rare data events or attributes can be the interesting ones.
•
Rare discrete values or classes.
•
Missing values can lead to sparsely observed observation
space.
Therefore, the target is a) to minimise the continuous rework
and provide long-term features in order to document all
parts of the creational steps and results and b) to integrate
knowledge and cognostic features, which is a core purpose of
the knowledge resources. Besides beneﬁts, complex “all-in”
folders, like in election context do show up with challenges
[35], which requires alternatives.
V.
METHODOLOGICAL BASES: LOGICAL STRUCTURES
To work on that goal requires to deﬁne information units
and to care for depositing an appropriate segmentation in
sub-units. The information units require links to the related
units, e.g., superunits. The challenges are to deﬁne these
structures and units for data used in different disciplinary
context, in one discipline, as well as in multi-disciplinary
context. These logical structures are the basic precondition for
the development of functioning algorithms, which can access
the units and whose application can be perfected in a next self-
learning step. The tries of using unstructured data result in the
fact that data volumes, variabilities, and volumes devaluate
the resulting values of requests. Any isolated technological
approaches to the big data challenge have shown not to be
constructive. A sustainable approach has to consider the data
and structure itself.
•
The ﬁrst step is the preconditional deﬁnition of a logical,
commonly valid structure for the data.
•
The second step is the planning for the applications
based on the logical structures in step one.
•
The third step is the creation of algorithms regarding the
data and data retrieval, interfaces, and workﬂows based
on steps one and two. The fourth step is the planning
of the implementation. This includes data format, plat-
forms, and applications.
Further, the creation, development, and operation of the
content and components require to consider and deﬁne the
essential plans, especially:
•
Plans for extending structures.
•
Preparations for all required interfaces for the newly
extended structures should be done.
•
Plans for self-learning components.
•
Plans for container formats and utilisation.
•
Plans for sustainable handling of data lifecycles, data
formats, and system resources.
The early stage of planning requires a concept catalogue. So
far, the activities are commonly in a pre-planning stage. The
next step includes case studies on structures, algorithms, and
collaborational issues (efﬁciency, economical cycle).
VI.
FUNDAMENT FOR THIS WORK
Long-term knowledge resources can be created and used
for universal documentation and re-use of content. The re-use
includes discovery, as well as gathering new results and creat-
ing new applications. The knowledge resources [36] can refer
to any kind of resources, e.g., to natural sciences resources
or historical geographic resources [37]. Basics of knowledge
organisation [38] and multi-lingual lexical linked data [39]
have been discussed for various disciplines and shown the
huge potential and value of the knowledge. This also shows
the beneﬁts of linking with universal classiﬁcations, especially
with consequently numerical notations, which can be easily
and most ﬂexibly and efﬁciently used with modern applications
components. Further, on the one hand, information services
beneﬁt from a comprehensive and holistic model for evaluation
[40] and on the other hand, they align with the beneﬁts for a
quality management of information services [41].
The paper presents a new implementation for creating
knowledge-supported dynamical visualisation and computa-
tion, which have not been integrated before for that purpose.
Therefore, a major goal of the application case studies is cre-
ating dynamical program components and algorithms based on
knowledge resources. The different previous projects and case
studies have already shown that the combination of knowledge
resources with integrated conceptual knowledge references can
be used for the creation of dynamical applications.
The dynamical visualisation and computation based on
knowledge resources does have numberless applications. Some
prominent examples with the research presented here are
knowledge discovery, visualising result matrices from work-
ﬂows or search processes, and creating objects and extend-
ing knowledge resources. The framework presented here is
a high level framework interconnecting several frameworks
for complex system architecture, multi-column operation, and
long-term creation for main resources. Therefore, the required
approach is considered to be necessarily most complex from
knowledge and implementation point of view.
Following the Geo Exploration and Information case studies
[42] based on the actmap framework [43] a number of devel-
opments for the deployment of High End Computing resources
and technologies with integrated systems are still state of
the art. In addition, including the structural and conceptual
knowledge based on the knowledge resources, research has
been done for a different special database framework, which is
as well autonomous and can be used for the creation of stan-
dalone dynamical and portable application components. The
components can be integrated with the existing frameworks, as
well as they can be used as standalone interactive applications.

IMPLEMENTATION: INTEGRATION AND KNOWLEDGE
A. Content and context
The implementation shows the context-sensitive dynamical
components based on the knowledge resources. The knowl-
edge resources provide the structure and integrate the factual

364

knowledge, the references, including the references for the
object classiﬁcation views required for the dynamic utilisation,
ensuring integration [44] and sustainability [45].
Previous case studies have shown that any suitable carto-
graphic visualisation can be used for the presentation of the
results, for example, with the Generic Mapping Tools [46]
(e.g., ﬁltering, trend ﬁtting, gridding, views, and projections)
or creating exports and imports with various products.
Most available cartographic visualisation products are too
specialised in order to handle advanced knowledge workﬂows
on the one hand and dynamical results on cognitive context
on the other hand. In the presented case where the application
should concentrate on the intention of presenting a special
result in an abstract way we require special and ﬂexible
facilities for dynamical sketch drawings. The more, in the
special case the cognitive background forbids to concentrate
on detailed cartographic visualisation or mixing with modern
ways of geographic conventions. Historical names, locations,
and context are not adequately represented by existing modern
frameworks.
Regarding both requirements for this study are fully com-
plied by the ﬂexibility of the implementation. The knowledge
resources themselves are not restrictive regarding the use of
other components for other purposes.
B. Implementation foundations
The implementation for dynamical visualisation and com-
putation is based on the framework for the architecture for
documentation and development of advanced scientiﬁc com-
puting and multi-disciplinary knowledge [47]. The architecture
implemented for an economical long-term strategy is based
on different development blocks. Figure 1 shows the three
main columns: Application resources, knowledge resources,
and originary resources.

Figure 1. Architecture: Columns of practical dimensions. The knowledge
resources are the central component within the long-term architecture.
The central block in the “Collaboration house” framework
architecture [48], are the knowledge resources, scientiﬁc re-
sources, databases, containers, and documentation (e.g., LX
[36], databases, containers, list resources). These can be based
on and refer to the originary resources and sources (photos,
scientiﬁc data, literature).
The knowledge resources are used as a universal com-
ponent for compute and storage workﬂows. Application re-
sources and components (Active Source, Active Map, local
applications) are implementations for analysing, utilising, and
processing data and making the information and knowledge
accessible. The related information, all data, and algorithm
objects presented are copyright the author of this paper, LX
Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources [36], all rights reserved. The
LX structure and the classiﬁcation references based on UDC
[5], especially mentioning the well structured editions [49]
and the multi-lingual features [6], are essential means for
the processing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge
objects and containers. Both provide strong multi-disciplinary
and multi-lingual support.
The three blocks are supported by services’ interfaces.
The interfaces interact with the physical resources, in the
local workspace, in the compute and storage resources the
knowledge resources are situated, and in the storage resources
for the originary resources.
All of these do allow for advanced scientiﬁc computing and
data processing, as well as the access of compute and storage
resources via services interfaces. The resources’ needs depend
on the application scenarios to be implemented for user groups.
C. Cognostics and related data
The content-supported cognostics support a plethora of
knowledge object sources, information, and data features. An
excerpt of examples of these features used in the case studies
implemented here are:
•
name,
•
keywords,
•
conceptual knowledge and classiﬁcation,
•
text,
•
link references,
•
dates,
•
languages,
•
translations,
•
transliterations,
•
map locations and GPS,
•
various types of comparisons and context references,
•
researchers’ views,
•
comments,
•
object speciﬁc material, classiﬁcation, documentation,
parameters, ﬁles, workﬂow descriptions, programs, . . .
All the data provided for an application, e.g., from knowledge
objects in collections or containers, including textual and non-
textual data, scientiﬁc data, mathematical data, technical data

365

as well as comments can be analysed by the workﬂows and
application components.
The visualisation components can use all the cognostic
attributes in order to further exploit the information for the
respective application targets. In addition, with the multi-
disciplinary long-term features and structures the knowledge
resources provide the means for a sustainable integrated re-
search data management [50].
This is signiﬁcant in combination with integrated realia and
digital resources, for example, in digital museums projects
[51]. An example for creating components usable with com-
plex environments is an agent-based modeling and simulation
in archaeology [52]. This is especially interesting for High End
Computing environments, in the given examples, for example,
for archaeological simulations [53].
In the presented scenarios implemented with this research,
the new resources overcome the insufﬁcient documentation,
the structural and long-term deﬁcits. Therefore, the integration
beneﬁts from the combination of structured and unstructured
data.
A lot of unstructured data is provided on the Internet.
For some scenarios this source might provide the largest
percentage of unstructured data, regulary integrated in the
workﬂows, e.g., with knowledge discovery processes. Regard-
ing non knowledge resources based sources the propertisation
(or ‘Proprietarisierung’ and ‘proprietarisation’ in German and
French a bit more concisely reﬂecting the stricter and essential
Latin ‘proprius’, meaning ‘own, individual, special, particular,
characteristic’ and dissociating from ‘proper’ and ‘property’)
is not only a threat for the free Web [54], [55], [56] but also for
the workﬂows, which can be based on unstructured data and
free and open access data, at least to a ﬂexible extend. The
situation may lead to challenges with application scenarios,
which contain a large percentage of references to unstructured
data on the free net as well as with workﬂows, which require
or beneﬁt from such data.
With unstructured Big Data, which is most of the overall
amount of data available, there is also a lot of bias [57]. With
high end solutions and resources, e.g., with High Performance
Computing, there is an increasing demand for techniques sup-
porting fault tolerance [58]. For High End Computing solutions
this can be achieved by modular structures and documentation.
One of the important features of algorithms and structures
supporting these applications is the ability to cope with failures
in information and applied knowledge [59]. With the facilities
of the knowledge resources for precision and fuzzyness the
components can cover a ﬂexible range of cognostic coverage.

IMPLEMENTATION: INTEGRATION AND DYNAMICS
A. Integration and computation
The context of the application components is fully integrated
with the knowledge resources and dynamical components [60].
The screenshot (Figure 2) illustrates some features. Shown
examples illustrate features of Active Source, computed and
ﬁltered views, LX information, and aerial site photographs,
e.g., from Google Maps.
Figure 2. Dynamical use of information systems and scientiﬁc computing with
multi-disciplinary and universal knowledge resources [48].
Many general aspects of dynamical use of information
systems and scientiﬁc computing have been analysed with the
collaboration house case studies.
B. Implemented content and application dynamics
The main groups of challenges are resulting from the content
and from the applications.
•
Content side: From content side, the knowledge re-
sources provide the central repository and infrastructure
(‘Knowledge as a Service’) for discovery and component
creation.
•
Application side: From application side, the dynamical
components can deploy the resources to any extent and
in any step of workﬂows.
Any part of the components and features can be assembled
from the knowledge resources’ workﬂows. As an example, the
site context and factual data components, the database and the
graphical user interface components including event deﬁnition
and management can be dynamically created via transform
routines and concatenate operations.
C. Dynamical visualisation and computation implementation
A number of different visualisation tools and frameworks
have been analysed in the latest case studies. The results
presented here were mostly realised with Tcl/Tk [61] for the
dynamical visualisations, Fortran and C based programs for
required algorithms, Message Passing Interface (MPI) [62],
and Perl for dynamical scripting.
Many components have been developed for the actmap
framework [43] and successfully used and veriﬁed in context
with existing scenarios. Besides the actmap framework addi-
tional possibilities of creating application programming inter-
faces and graphical user interfaces for dynamical visualisation
of knowledge matrices have to be analysed.
As a simple example for a dynamical, portable, and stan-
dalone component an application like Tclworld has been con-
sidered [63]. The application is built on a very portable Tool

366
International Journal on Advances in Software, vol 8 no 3 & 4, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/software/

Command Language (TCL) base integrating programming,
database, and user interfaces.
The database application programming interface [64] is
very simple, portable, and extendable. The database graphical
user interface [65] can be used within the same application
and is based on a rapid prototyping concept. Both interface
models allow dynamical control and extension of any features
regarding the application, as well as for the content.
IX.
IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTING COMPONENTS
The knowledge resources are very ﬂexibly supporting docu-
mentation and handling of knowledge content and context. The
features include cognostics as well as dynamical application
support.
Key to the ﬂexibility is that any knowledge object can
carry as much documentation as required. It is the task of the
application workﬂow to make use of the available information
to the extend needed and to develop or create complemen-
tary information. Creating knowledge-supported dynamical
components starts at the application to knowledge resources’
interface level. The conventional components and processes
have been described and discussed in practice in detail in
previous research, regarding Active Map Software [43], case
studies [42], and knowledge integration for classiﬁcation and
computation [44].
For the visualisation and computation using the matrix ob-
jects with spatial and georeferenced context, a new application
instance “lxworlddynamic” has been created based on the
knowledge resources and interfaces. This component re-using
the Tclworld interfaces is the required extension complemen-
tary to the actmap framework components. All parts of the
component shall
•
support dynamical and cognostic features,
•
integrate with the knowledge resources and existing
components, e.g., georeferenced objects,
•
be usable interactively,
•
have access to the content, e.g., index selection,
•
facilitate a standalone application assembly, and
•
allow a ﬂexible conﬁguration of all aspects of the
applications’ visualisation and computation, including
cognostic support.
Especially, the component requires a site handler database,
has to refer to sets of georeferenced objects, a level handler for
selecting levels of detail, to create groups of matrix objects, to
support for an individualised conﬁguration, to facilitate index
selections on the generated matrix elements, to visualise the
matrix elements and context graphically, and has to provide
associated data textually and numerically.
Therefore, the implementations done for this study concen-
trate on creating dynamical, generated, cognostic components.
Explicitly, the focus was not on georeferencing standards or
cartographic issues or precision. Any of such features can be
developed by third parties being interested in supporting their
individual scenarios.
A. Knowledge resources and geo sets
The integrated information systems can generate result
matrices based on the available components and workﬂows.
The result matrix generators can be conﬁgured to deliver any
kind of result matrix. One base for the implementation is the
generation of georeferences data resulting from requests. The
listing (Figure 3) shows an example of a result matrix, an
excerpt of the generated site handler database.

The database is the result of a request summarising results on
objects referring to a deﬁned context, in this case references
between archaeological and geological objects.
The framework provides a number of features like level han-
dlers and sets of object georeferences. The listing (Figure 4)

When a representation of matrix objects in dynamical spatial
cartographic context is possible then selected objects can be
integrated either from the matrix elements or from the context
elements and references (Figure 7).

and grids. Any part of the dynamically generated components
can be individualised depending on context-sensitive attributes
and workﬂow conﬁguration. The listing (Figure 8) shows an
example for the generated on-the-ﬂy-symbol used for “sites”.

Figure 8. Excerpt of generated on-the-ﬂy symbol for sites (lxworlddynamic).
Different symbols can be integrated for different sites or for
different groups. The objects with their symbols are only
visible if the deﬁned level, which is handled by the level
handler, is active in the interactive view.
C. Dynamical visualisation and computation
The following image (Figure 9) shows a screenshot of a
resulting dynamical visualisation of items in the result matrix,
in this case the resulting archaeological context sites. The
generated application utilises all the features so far described
with the implementation.
Figure 9. Archaeological context sites in interactive, dynamically generated
spatial application (lxworlddynamic).
The screenshot illustrates the dynamical visualisation of
the matrix elements for the context of the respective results.
With the workﬂow a spatial context has been chosen for
the matrix, creating the components. The spatial application
component has been assembled by the workﬂow, integrating
the object item references from the result matrix and secondary
information from the referring knowledge resources objects
with a dynamical and interactive view of the matrix.
Figure 10 shows a screenshot of a resulting dynamical
zoom visualisation of matrix results and secondary information
on geological and archaeological context sites. The partially

shown superpositioning effect of the respective zoom is still
visible in order to show the results, which can be separated in
different cognitive views, different zooms, and event sensitive
actions. The implementor can do anything with this feature
he is interested in, e.g., use the interactive features for label
stacks and level effects, being sensitive for single results or
result group. Workﬂow sensitive cartographic material objects
(e.g., cities, land, sea, countries, border lines, grid lines) are
shown for orientation and context and support cognitive feature
display. The shown zoom value and the scroll bars indicate the
level of detail. The screenshot illustrates the matrix elements
and their references within the knowledge resources.
Figure 10. Zoom archaeological and geological sites and context, integrated
in interactive, dynamically generated spatial application (lxworlddynamic).
In this example, an active context-sensitive window compo-
nent is delivering the secondary information. This component
is actively communicating with the other components. The
site entity data regarding levels and objects referred from the
matrix elements is dynamically available (Figure 11).

example, the displayed data excerpt includes the level, the
type, and the location of the respective site. Figure 12 shows
a screenshot of the corresponding dynamical site database.
Figure 12. Site database, secondary information (lxworlddynamic).
The site database can be accessed by integrated or external
applications’ components, e.g., for searches, references or for
generating further result matrices. The screenshot illustrates
the matrix elements and their references within the knowledge
resources. In this example, an active context-sensitive window
is delivering the secondary information.
X.
DYNAMICAL COGNOSTIC PROCESSING
Some of the knowledge object data is processed and ﬁltered
for cognostic context and shown in application components,
e.g., as secondary data in dynamical windows, e.g., in the
LX World database windows.
A. Knowledge levels and cognostics
A resulting selection can, for example, be used for interac-
tive discovery processes in the dynamically generated result
matrix. The next passages are based on a result matrix of
objects from the context of natural sciences and archaeology.
The result matrix elements were dynamically processed and
added to the interactive application component. The standard
entries had not to be removed as from the processing workﬂow
they are not interlinked and as they demonstrate the co-
existence of non-linked objects. The data is based on the
knowledge resources and the lxworlddynamic components.
The workﬂow illustrates the secondary information from the
dynamically extendable database being used for cognostic
based improvement of an intermediate result matrix. In this
case, the goal is to look for archaeological sites with associ-
ations to more than two societies or cultures as they might
be called. The following example (Figure 13) shows a search
window searching “Society” context in the intermediate result
matrix in the intermediate historical result matrix.
Figure 13. Secondary information on “Society” (lxworlddynamic).
The secondary search window contains the results from
within the result matrix, Mayan, Roman, and Greek soci-
ety. They are dynamically interlinked with deeper respective
information. The following example (Figure 14) shows the
referenced information for “Mayan society” in the context of
the result matrix.

(lxworlddynamic).

The following example (Figure 15) shows the referenced
information for “Greek society” in the result matrix’ context.

(lxworlddynamic).
The following example (Figure 16) shows the referenced
information for “Roman society” in the result matrix’ context.
Figure 16. Dynamically linked information on “Roman society”
(lxworlddynamic).
Whereas the ﬁrst entry does not carry a dynamical reference
to a common location, both entries Greek and Roman link to
a location object “Antipolis”.
The following example (Figure 17) shows the referenced
information for “Antipolis” in the context of the result matrix.
Figure 17. Dynamically linked information on “Antipolis” linked as well
from “Greek Society” and “Roman society” (lxworlddynamic).
When the discovery goes into the elements’ context, then
the attributes refer to many details of the context. Figure 18
shows an excerpt of an referenced Antipolis object entry with
UDC classiﬁed knowledge objects.

As used in the objects’ excerpt, the classiﬁcation presents
a view, which includes a cognostic meaning with its selection
and sort order. In this case, only appropriate elements from the
compiled result matrix are linked automatically when relevant
for the application scenario.
B. Synonyms and cognostics

searching in the intermediate result matrix for the synonyms
of Vesuvius.

Besides all the other information in this excerpt, the names of
the object in different languages and the explicitely declared
synonyms were choosen to be handled equally when dynami-
cally generating the “Synonym:” data for the lxworlddynamic
database as shown in Figure 19. Due to the reference to the
objects in the knowledge resources it will also be possible to
use the information separately again for further cognostic pur-
poses, e.g., when creating a language speciﬁc search interface.
It is important to mention that with the excerpts of clas-
siﬁcation shown the conceptual knowledge consistency is
supported by editions, which may be used exclusively but
also in combination. Table II excerpts the classiﬁcation (UDC)

resources references for the example above.

Whereas any of the application components are limited by
default –not only those in the examples above– the resources
containing the knowledge provide much higher ﬂexibility,
which includes “universal” conceptual knowledge features. In
consequence, only individual representations and views of the
objects can be shown.
C. Cognostic levels and dynamical visualisation
Classiﬁcation has been considered as a research tool for
several decades now [66]. When getting into non-disciplinary
classiﬁcation [67] or the more into integrated knowledge
processing then the UDC can support even complex context.
Today, many sites using a classiﬁcation will considered UDC
to be the top end of the existing multi-lingual universal
classiﬁcations [68]. In detail, regarding some disciplines’ clas-
siﬁcation the reliability of classiﬁcation is an issue, e.g., with
diagnostic classiﬁcation [69]. In other cases, e.g., with text
classiﬁcation a non-parametric statistical method can help to
provide solutions [70]. The recherche in heterogeneous data
resources is a special challenge [71], which can be supported
by referencing between classiﬁcations and imaging between
classiﬁcations.
This means besides UDC, regarding universal, multi-
disciplinary knowledge, natural sciences, and mathematics,
e.g., the Physics and Astronomy Classiﬁcation Scheme (PACS)
[72], the Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation (MSC) [73], the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) library classiﬁcation system
[74], and the North American Industry Classiﬁcation System
(NAICS) [75] are and were widely in use and might need to
be considered.
With the research on knowledge resources and dynamical
components basic work for intermediate classiﬁcation has
been done [76], which can extend the knowledge context
and interlinks specialised resources into universal conceptual
knowledge. Handling details or respectively the content and
context of “objects” includes challenging tasks. Using an
universal classiﬁcation can support the cognostic aspects in
many ways. For example, on the one hand, the granular-
ity must be as high as possible but on the other hand it
should still be easy to group certain selections. Therefore,
the documentation requires means, which combine precise and
fuzzy methods at the same time. This results in challenges
from creating documentation down to using the content in
any way. Today advanced cognitive geoscientiﬁc information
system components can integrate higher levels of cognostic
information. All the aspects can be documented and provided
applying a universal classiﬁcation. Mapping cognostic details
with levels of details can, e.g., be aligned with the depth of
the classiﬁcation.
All the objects, like map objects and their attributes are part
of the environment, including the city markers. These entries
are deﬁned for creating a speciﬁc environment.
In this example, from the second view level on the generated
entries are shown. These entries are objects from the group
of result matrix elements. The context and attributes of these
objects can be generated according to the cognostic context
and purpose. For example, the labels, colours, appearance of
the objects, the dynamical features and so on can be modiﬁed
by the author for creating the respective view accordingly. In
the above examples cognostics contributes especially from the
•
Object level (e.g., documentation context),
•
Workﬂow level (e.g., result matrix generation),
•
Application level (e.g., component implementation),
•
Interactive level (e.g., dynamical context).
The following screenshot (Figure 21) shows an example
for the dynamical visualisation of a result matrix containing
archaeological and geological sites and context. The object
data is integrated in an interactive, dynamically generated
spatial application. The screenshot shows level 1, where the
cognostic level of detail containing the “site” objects is deﬁned
level 2.
Figure 21. lxworlddynamic – archaeological and geological sites and context,
integrated in interactive, dynamically generated spatial application (level 1).

Whereas in this example level 1 only contains continents,
some border lines, and some larger cities level 2 also visualises
the targeted objects.
D. Conceptual support for generators
The high level of required application and discovery pro-
cesses leads to the fact that there must be facilities to create
result matrices via many different ways when using a knowl-
edge resources concept.
Structured long-term resources integrating complex docu-
mentation and classiﬁcation and providing the required ‘data
features’ have been developed for that purpose. Besides the
large spectrum of features of the knowledge objects, the major
attribute supporting cognostic reuse is conceptual knowledge.
The knowledge object can carry many attributes, e.g., ref-
erences, keywords, and conceptual knowledge. In many cases
this conceptual knowledge comes in the form of one or more
classiﬁcations.
The classiﬁcation, which has shown up being especially
important for complex multi-disciplinary long-term classiﬁ-
cation with knowledge resources is the Universal Decimal
Classiﬁcation (UDC) [77].
UDC allows an efﬁcient and effective processing of knowl-
edge data and provides facilities to obtain a universal and
systematical view on classiﬁed objects.
Regarding library applications only, UDC is used by more
than 144,000 institutions and 130 countries [78]. Further
operational areas are author-side content classiﬁcations and
museum collections, e.g., with documentation of resources,
library content, bibliographic purposes on publications and
references, for digital and realia objects.
The tiny unsorted excerpts of knowledge resources objects
only refer to main UDC-based classes, which for this part of
the publication are taken from the Multilingual UDC Summary
(UDCC Publication No. 088) [49] released by the UDC
Consortium under the Creative Commons Attribution Share
Alike 3.0 license [79] (ﬁrst release 2009, subsequent update
2012).
If nothing special is mentioned the basic classiﬁcation codes
are used in an unaltered way. If a classiﬁcation refers to a
modiﬁed code in particular contributing authors have to notice
and document the modiﬁcations explicitely. So in practice, the
classiﬁcation views with knowledge resources are references
to UDC.
E. Series of cognostic views
The series of screenshots in Figure 22 depicts the sequence
zoom details in levels 2 to level 5 for the archaeological and
geological sites and context. The ﬁrst image shows the LX sites
generated from the result matrix. The second image shows the
zoom of the Europe LX sites’ area. The third and fourth images
show a zoom and a followup zoom of the Europe selection,
e.g., identifying Barcin and Vesuvius sites.

F. Triggering events and interactive features
Figure 23 shows the generated search window for the result
matrix site database, especially with the Vesuvius georeference
data.
Figure 23. lxworlddynamic – archaeological and geological sites and context,
site database window (Vesuvius).
Using the “!” function triggers a “goto” for the coordinates
and open a corresponding zoom window containing the se-
lected georeferences (Figure 24).
Figure 24. lxworlddynamic – archaeological and geological sites and context,
“goto” (!) zoom window (Vesuvius).
The sequence of the consequent levels and interactive fea-
tures shows a dynamical visualisation integrated with result
matrices and components generated from universal knowledge
resources. Based on this any events can be triggered that way,
e.g., visualisation or computation events. This goto function
is only an example for the multitude of possibilities to add
code and procedures to the generated components in order to
support the dynamic and cognostic features.
G. Generating referenced information code
Figure 25 shows the generated search window for the result
matrix site database, especially with a country dependent
graphics included with the information. The code for the com-
ponent as well as for the content has been created dynamically.

is automatically linked by the framework environment in a
very simple fuzzy way and can transport cognostic aspects
in textual and visual context. The cognostic levels can be
handled very ﬂexible, e.g., the content and the generated
database entry code in arbitrary ways. In this case, the result
matrix deﬁnes objects for one level. The environment deﬁnes
additional context objects for other levels.
XI.
EVALUATION
Application components can be created and assembled dy-
namically from any workﬂow. Knowledge objects can be used
efﬁciently with any dynamical components. The cognostic
features for the content as well as for resulting applica-
tion components can be efﬁciently provided by conceptual
knowledge documented with advanced knowledge resources.
Database interfaces can be used dynamically and efﬁciently
with the components. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and
Application Programming Interfaces (API) can be used most
ﬂexible on that dynamical base.
The information created from arbitrary numbers of re-
sources’ objects in this excerpt includes site labels, level
information, category information, as well as the georefer-
ences. The components can trigger any instances and events
dynamically and interactively. This allows any kind of pro-
cessing, computation, and visualisation, from sketch like vi-
sualisation to special cartographical mapping. All the more,
the dynamical components based on the knowledge resources
and the lxworlddynamic frameworks allow for the interactive,
autonomous components’ generation. The components have
been successfully implemented on a number of operating
systems (e.g., SuSE Linux, Debian, Red Hat, and Scientiﬁc
Linux, as well with older and up-to-date distributions).

The knowledge and system architecture allows to seam-
lessly integrate with all the steps required for a sustainable
implementation of the methodological bases. The case studies
done over several decades of knowledge resources’ creation
and development and two decades of application component
developments have shown that plans for extending structures,
creating interfaces, self-learning components, container for-
mats, and integration with life cycles and systems resources’
operation can be assured even for long-term application.
XII.
FURTHER POTENTIAL OF COMPONENTS
The development with this long-term research has led to
sustainable solutions when implementing components that
support splitting up the data, which is most important in
order to achieve an efﬁcient use of available resources, e.g.,
Input/Output or distribution onto many disks and machines.
Otherwise, bulk data can be as inefﬁcient to handle as it
will not be practical to use certain methods and algorithms
at all. Not all the tools, which are implemented by respective
disciplines for handling data are suitable and efﬁcient for all
data, algorithms, and workﬂows. Parallel processing can and
should be done with different tools for different purposes.
Examples are commonly used tools like Hadoop, Hadoop
Distributed File System (HDFS), and MapReduce with a basic
Application Programmers Interface (API) for a more abstracted
way of developing components for parallel processing of
portions of data on a cluster system.
For critical cases it might be argued that components
like MapReduce code are costly to write and difﬁcult to
troubleshoot and manage. With the same breath, tools like
MapReduce are inefﬁcient for exploring datasets. Therefore,
the Hadoop_on_a_chip ‘ecosystem’ got tools that span a
wide variety of needs, including providing layers of abstraction
that make interacting with the data simpler.
In public presentation and marketing common understanding
of containers is reduced to certain aspects, e.g., security
features [80], [81]. Special container concepts have been
introduced for handling Big Data, especially scientiﬁc data,
e.g., the NERSC ‘Shifter’ at the National Energy Research
Scientiﬁc Computing Center [82].
These approaches are insufﬁcient from the content and
knowledge related point of view of containers. For example,
on the one hand, there is nothing general for a container when
postulating that it should contain “everything”. At the same
level, security features have to be considered very special
with speciﬁc cases of application. In addition, in most cases
the advanced application scenarios trigger those secondary
conditions. On the other hand, containers must not only
provide computational features. The result is that up to now
we neither have a commonly discussed container concept
nor a set of universal features. A container is a term for a
data or ﬁle format bundling the data for certain purpose and
application. The features for anything more interesting will
include data, documentation, references and so on. Doing so
includes how the information is transferred or accessed, which
includes to deﬁne the modalities for a certain scenario. When
discussing containers from the content and knowledge view
many scenarios if not universal application is the target, which
induces a much more general understanding of containers as
has been done with this research.
XIII.
CONCLUSIONS
Application components have shown to beneﬁt in many
cases from dynamical processing in context with knowledge
and cognostics. This research has provided details of the
implementation and the resulting components, from structure,
content, and context of knowledge resources and cognostic
support for dynamical components, geo sets, computation to
index selection and various views from the resulting visuali-
sations.
Long-term knowledge resources are core means for pro-
viding a sustainable base for these features. The knowledge
resources can refer to any kind of resources and allow to
efﬁciently transport implementation features for long-term
vitality of use cases. Over many years the implementation with
different scenarios has proven to be straight forward.
It has been demonstrated that with the proposed framework
and concept context-sensitive dynamical components can be
successfully created on base of universal knowledge resources.
It has been shown that even standalone dynamical components
can be created based on the implementation of the founda-
tions, supporting arbitrary dynamical, modular, portable, and
extendable database application programming and database
graphical user interfaces. The implementation can utilise work-
ﬂows and algorithms for knowledge discovery and selection
up to intelligent application component creation. It integrates
very efﬁciently in workﬂow chains, e.g., for computation and
visualisation, and is very well usable even for rapid prototyping
environments.
The integration is non-invasive regarding the knowledge re-
sources for uni-directional visualisation and computation. If the
intention with an application scenario is to update information
consistently then multi-directional workﬂows can also update
objects in side knowledge resources or containers from the
created components in arbitrary ways, ensuring consistency
and plausibility, as well as following management and security
policies. Future work will be focussed on issues and usability
beyond the plain Big Data approaches, resulting from data val-
ues, creating implementations supporting data vitality. A major
focus will concentrate on sustainable integration of content and
context with conceptual knowledge and cognostics.
