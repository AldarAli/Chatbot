Abstract—Games have emerged as a prominent form
of entertainment, hence establishing the gaming business
as a highly lucrative sector. Nevertheless, the process of
developing a game can be extremely complex, involving a
multitude of activities, components, and team members,
making some games take a long time to be produced. The
game community has already engaged in the creation of
its own games. This practice is commonly referred to as
modding. The application of mods in game development
can provide several benefits, including enhanced longevity
of games, reduced production expenses, and accelerated
creation of diverse games within reduced timelines. Nev-
ertheless, the existing mod development process predomi-
nantly lacks a structured framework. Hence, the objective
of this study is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation
that clarifies the main attributes, benefits, difficulties, and
methodologies employed in the creation of mods.

view, Multivocal review.
I. INTRODUCTION
By conducting a brief search, it is feasible to identify
numerous games available for purchase, as well as several
websites that offer modifications for these games. A modifi-
cation, also referred to as a ”mod,” involves one or several
alterations or adjustments made to a game, which could
be related to its mechanics, dynamics, or any other basic
element. The classification of it may differ contingent upon
the degree of modification: these categorizations involve terms
such as patches, tweaks, add-ons, and other designations [1–
3]. This method of modifying games can result in a variety
of advantages for the company that created the original titles.
Among the primary advantages there are: an increase in the
number of users, the number of sales, and the longevity of the
game [4].
With this is mind, the paper presents a review of the use
of mods in development of games. The method used in this
research was Multivocal review that is a more complete exam-
ination of the literature that aims to elicit as much information
as possible about a specific subject; hence, it incorporates
data from both white (academic papers, books, etc.) and
gray (blogs, websites, videos, etc.) sources. This strategy is
typically utilized when there is substantial community support
for the study subject and it is necessary to verify practical
knowledge on a particular subject [5].
The subsequent sections of this paper are outlined as fol-
lows: Section 2 provides a concise overview of the research
procedure used in this study. Section 3 includes a comprehen-
sive analysis of the data encountered during the search process.
Finally, Section 4 offers a concluding summary of the paper.
II. RESEARCH PROTOCOL
As mentioned, this research conducted two literature re-
views applying distinct search strategies (one for each review):
a Mapping Literature Review (MLR) and a Multivocal Review
(RM). The first study’s objective was to collect data from
white literature (academic papers), while the second served as
a supplement by collecting data from gray literature (websites,
blogs, etc.) [5].
In the initial phase of the investigation, three search
databases were utilized, following the recommendation of B.
Kitchenham et al. [6]. The search string was executed on the
main search engines: Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEEXplore.
In order to facilitate the execution of this study, a fun-
damental search string was formulated based on the PICOC
framework, which covers the following components: Popu-
lation, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context [6].
Combining domain-specific keywords with the logical operator
”OR” and fields with the logical operator ”AND” produced
the search string. This string was utilized for the duration of
the search. To validate the search string, two control papers
(Modding as part of game culture [3], Serious mods: A case
for modding in serious games pedagogy [7]) were used to
generate and execute the string in the Scopus database, the
first database to which the string was applied. This validation
technique seeks to ensure the quality of the search string by
returning only relevant articles and author knowledge.
According to some scholars, snowball processes can mit-
igate the lack of other search engines and supplement the
strategy by conducting search through the references and
citations of the papers. In order to minimize the loss of some
papers and broaden the scope of the search, the forward and
backward (one-level) snowballing procedure was employed
to verify the references and citations of papers for relevance
[8]. The procedures, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality
criteria and research questions will be described below.
The research execution procedure consisted of the following
steps:
1) Execute the search string. For searches in gray literature,
it was searched for each search string up to page 10 of

google. The search strings were formed by combining the
keywords of population and intervention;
2) Apply the inclusion / exclusion criteria based on the title;
3) Apply the inclusion / exclusion criteria based on the
abstract;
4) Apply the inclusion / exclusion criteria based on the full
text;
5) Apply the quality criteria; Apply snowballing backward;
6) Apply snowballing forward. For searches in gray litera-
ture, the snowballing was performed on site references,
on links contained within the site.

III. RESULTS ANALYSIS
The first phase provided a total of 923 papers. This number
was reduced to 14 after the inclusion and exclusion criteria
were applied to the publications. From these studies, the
snowballing process was carried out, and a total of 245 more
papers were evaluated. After this approach, 9 papers were
included, totaling 23 papers read and assessed.
Based on the findings of the initial phase, it was deter-
mined that the gaming community is quite active in terms of

development, enhancements, and modifications. Consequently,
a new phase was introduced to the study. In addition to the
investigation, a search for gray literature was conducted.
The gray literature search encompassed up to page 10 of
Google for each of the search keywords, resulting in 700
links that required validation. The inclusion and exclusion
criteria were implemented after visiting each link, resulting
in the selection of 21 links for the quality criteria step. Ten
links were selected and approved based on the following cri-
teria. The snowball effect was achieved by utilizing backlinks
(website reference connections). As a consequence, the entire
procedure was restarted for the authorized connections, and
335 additional links were validated. Lastly, fourteen additional
documents were added in the search the snowballing process.
Table I shows the search string used in the search. The
appendix demonstrates the papers and links that were analyzed
in this review.
Q1: What modifiers are used to create games from other
games?
Increased accessibility to personal computers and the ex-
pansion of the Internet, which is disseminating an increasing
quantity of content, are closely related to the rise of the
mod trend [10]. The community and academy are increasingly
generating game adaptations, which help game developers in a
variety of ways, such as recruiting new players, prolonging the
life of a game, providing new perspectives for the game, and
fixing bugs. In general, modifications are referred to as mods
and can be viewed as alterations to the original game [1]. In
general, a mod is an original game that has had one or N
alterations or modifications made to its mechanics, dynamics,
rules, or some of its components [11].
Mods are as diverse as the games themselves. They vary
in size and complexity and can make minor adjustments
to the original game or completely alter its visual design
[12]. Modding is the process and technique of modifying or
adapting video games. It is frequently a ”Do It Yourself” (DIY)
strategy that teaches social and technical skills affiliated with
innovation by reusing the concept of an existing game. Nu-
merous aspects of the game, including the user interface, game
items, bug fixes, characters, and regulations, are modifiable
[4]. By altering the rules of a game, for instance, players are
able to construct a unique gaming experience [13].
Developing mods is possible by applying mutators to a
game. A mutator is a modification to an existing game; for
instance, applying mutator M to game G results in the creation
of a new game named G [M] [14]. Depending on the number
145

IARIA Congress 2023 : The 2023 IARIA Annual Congress on Frontiers in Science, Technology, Services, and Applications

of mutators utilized, a game may be classified in a variety
of ways. There are numerous adaptations and modifications,
each serving a distinct purpose [1, 4]. Each of them will be
described in more detail in the following [1-3][8][16-27].
Interface customization: The interfaces are designed to
emphasize the visual component of the game in order to
enhance the experience. This customization entails making
changes to the visual element, such as remodeling the acces-
sories, skin, shader, or animation of a character or a game
map, altering the game’s colors, or altering the information
displayed on the screen;
Partial Conversions: Add a new map, a new character,
and a new item; increase the game’s pace; add small mecha-
nisms, bots, and rules. It is still possible to classify partial
modifiers according to the modifications they execute. (1)
Mutators/tweaks: Modify or add restricted features that have
no effect on the game’s functionality or mechanics. They
may include modifying the game’s theme song, increasing the
game’s speed, or modifying some graphic elements and minor
rules. (2) Add-ons: They serve as supplementary elements
within the game, performing minor adjustments such as mod-
ifying the theme’s music, accelerating the game, or adjusting
minor graphical components and rules. (3) Mod: Mods: They
are the intersection of the previous two, as they retain the
capacity to change rules and configurations.
Total Conversions: Certain changes are so drastic that they
result in the creation of new games. A well-known conversion
is the CounterStrike mod, which was based on Half-Life. In
general, the number of modifiers used differentiates a partial
conversion from a complete conversion. When a significant
number of modifiers are applied to the point where something
new is generated, a complete conversion occurs.
Others: Machinima: It could be seen as the outcome
of changes that influence the visual replay of game usage
sessions. In this type of modification, games are used for
other purposes, such as telling a story, making a movie,
or replicating a gaming experience. Patch: They frequently
concentrate on addressing unresolved problems and creating
technical enhancements. This modification is known as an
unofficial or fan patch when it is created by a community.
Q2: What characteristics are needed to derive a game?
A game is a type of software development in which design-
ers, developers, and software engineers work together to create
an experience for players to live through the game [15]. Once
the game is out, the contributors devote their time to updating
and adding content to the main game. Modifications may
include new game models, textures, music, and mechanisms,
as well as complete remakes [15].
There are two primary methodologies for mod development.
The first scenario occurs when there is a need for expansion
in a particular game by introducing new elements, while the
second scenario occurs while seeking games that offer similar
characteristics to those wanted in the game under development
[16]. Both need the same characteristics.
A game is made up of components that work together
to generate the final output. The required qualities for their
construction can be determined by defining games. Games
are activities that occur in an abstract environment where
decisions, actions, and rules are developed with the objective
of accomplishing a leisure activity in the form of entertainment
or amusement [17]. On this premise, the following aspects
must be decided prior to the construction of any game:
rules, actions, behaviors, objective, game loop, difficulty, and
rewards [16, 18].
Each of the characteristics necessary for the interpretation
and evolution of a game will be exemplified below. These
features were divided into four broad categories that capture
the attributes of the games at a higher level of abstraction. It
should be noted that game mechanics were previously divided
into actions and behaviors [17-19][23][24][29][32].
[Avatar]
Operation rules: Rules about the player. E.g.: the player
can only carry one weapon at a time [4][14][18][28][33-35];
Transition rules/states: Understanding the character’s state
transitions. E.g.: the player can only shoot if he/she has a
weapon in his/her hand [16, 19–23]; Actions: Commands that
can be executed by the character. E.g.: shooting and walking
[4, 19, 20, 22–24].
[Game world]
Levels: The game’s stages. Strongly influenced by the game-
play that can change from one stage to the next [16, 19–
23, 25]; Rules of objects: Rules of the objects contained in
the world. E.g.: when an object must be locked or unlocked
[4, 16, 20, 23, 24, 26]; Behavioral rules: Rules of behavior
that the world can exhibit. Eg .: if the player collects a specific
item it can start to rain [15, 16, 23–25, 27]; Temporal states:
It works like a state machine; depending on the world’s state,
it can only go to a specific one [4, 16, 23, 25, 27]; Mission:
What you want to achieve/complete [4, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25];
Obstacles: What you must overcome in the game, its difficul-
ties [7, 15, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27].
[Game play]
Winning and losing conditions: Conditions to win or lose the
game [7, 12, 16, 20, 23, 27]; Strategic dilemmas: Strategies
that can be used in the game. E.g.: combo attacks [7, 12, 16,
20, 23, 27]; Chains of actions: Chain of actions that can be
combined. Eg .: player action with a map action [16, 20, 22,
27].
[General features]
Rules: Encapsulates the logic inside the system [4, 13, 16,
20, 21, 23, 24, 28]; Score: The points obtained by the player
throughout the game [16, 20–23, 27]; Behaviors: Commands
that are executed by the system [4, 16, 20, 21, 23, 27]; Goal:
What you want to achieve/complete [4, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25];
Challenge: What must be accomplished to achieve the goal
[4, 7, 16, 20, 21, 23]; Rewards: reaching the goal [4, 16, 20,
23, 24, 28]; Game loop: Flow of engagement of the game.
It is the execution of the game where the player seeks a goal
by executing a challenge and being rewarded with something
[4, 20–22, 27]; Interface: The visual of the game, the game’s

sprites, and graphics [7, 19, 21, 23–25, 28]; Entities: Objects
and elements instantiated within the game [12, 21, 23, 24, 27].
Q3: What are the advantages and difficulties of creating
games from others?
Generalizing mod developers’ intentions is difficult. There
are several elements that contribute to a user producing a mod.
Attempting new things, resolving bugs, creating new charac-
ters, increasing the difficulty of the game, gaining advantages
in the game, extending the game’s life cycle, the software was
originally designed for a significantly different environment
and may require improvement, the official developer is unable
to deal with the problems, and so on are among the most
significant ones [4, 29].
Modifiers, like games, are complex and time-consuming
to create. The time it takes to create a mod varies greatly.
The construction process might vary in duration, ranging
from a few days to a somewhat longer period, while offering
the advantage of using reusable components. As previously
mentioned, creating a game can be incredibly time consuming
and can take years. However, the time necessary to release a
mod is far shorter [4]. Mods allow the community to add to
the original game. Depending on the nature of the mod, it may
only require one or several releases. For example, a mod that
improves the texture of a game may only require one version.
The potential to increase the longevity of games is another
advantage that can be ascribed to the employment of modifiers.
Every game has an effective life cycle. Modifiers, on the other
hand, can extend the life of the game by adding additional
instructions, characters, levels, and other factors, giving play-
ers more areas to explore [4, 20, 30]. Using the same logic,
modifications may help boost sales, income, and profits for
original games, as many people purchase the original game in
order to play the mod [4, 11, 29].
Another significant advantage of modifications is their abil-
ity to draw new players to the game, so extending its longevity.
For example, Dota 2 was a Warcraft mod that reached 450,000
daily players five years after its debut and 16 years after the
original game’s release. As a result, the game’s player base
and longevity grow [4, 31].
Despite all of the benefits stated so far, there are still issues
and hurdles to be aware of when building mods. The first
and most serious issue is the initial investment required to
create a mod, which is required to comprehend the source
code, reverse engineer it, and extract its functionality [21, 32].
Following this line of thought, various investigations have
already been conducted with the product line. However, this
strategy necessitates an initial expenditure to understand the
project’s first characteristics [21, 32].
Q4: What tools or frameworks support these changes?
A variety of frameworks and tools make it easier to con-
struct customizations. However, cloning and do-it-yourself
have been the most popular methods of mod development
thus far. The modder chooses the base game to be modified,
confirms the properties he or she wishes to change, and
then creates the new game [32]. This less complex approach,
known as opportunistic reuse or ad hoc reuse, consists of
cloning, copying, and stretching. Opportunistic reuse gives
immediate benefits and achieves the intended result. However,
project quality is not a priority; extensive reworking results
in unanticipated behavior and an unstable software structure
[23].
Typically, technologies that allow access to an unencrypted
internal representation of the game software are used to
modify games. While it may appear that game makers want
to dissuade players from customizing their games, this is not
the case. In order to increase sales and market share, video
game developers are increasingly providing software tools for
personalizing their products [29]. Software Development Kits
(SDKs) for games/domains provided by game development
studios to users represent a current business method for
engaging users and assisting in product creation outside the
company [1, 15, 33]. In addition to SDKs, which are the most
popular manner of accessing the game’s source code, various
other platforms enable access to and allow alterations to the
game’s source code. The Creation Kit, GECK, Construction
Set, MODKit, REDKit, Modbuddy, and D’jinni are among the
most important ones [4].
Another possibility for the development of modifiers is
through free software games, in which the end user has
complete access to the game’s source code and may modify
it as desired [1]. However, this strategy is used by small
businesses or anonymous developers.
Finally, there are companies that help and support the
development of adjustments with the purpose of decreasing
difficulties, enhancing game quality and consistency, and
developing new ideas. This strategy seeks to improve the
game sold by leveraging the suggestions of consumers. The
Unreal engine was designed to provide users access to all
of its technological components. This allowed it to conduct
a number of tournaments known as Unreal Tournaments,
in which the developer could express his or her creativity
while producing mods [4, 12]. Other firms allow alteration
construction as well, although without direct access to the
components. Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft, for
example, provides a User Interface (UI) modification tool that
allows add-ons to modify the user interface panel, resulting in
a better gameplay experience.
IV. CONCLUSION
Game companies are growing in size, earning billions of
dollars per year, releasing a significant number of titles each
year, and attracting fans of all ages and genres. However,
as previously mentioned, designing a game may be a time-
consuming process that can take years to finish. The gaming
community, on the other hand, is expanding on a daily basis.
With such a vast user base, some members may be concerned
or disgruntled about having to wait so long for a game to be
launched.
In light of this consideration, the current paper presents a
multivocal study of papers that involve information associated

with the development of modifications (mods). The primary
objective was to find the essential characteristics required for
mod creation, as well as to explore the associated challenges
and advantages. Additionally, the study aims to identify the
most commonly employed techniques in this process.
Through the review, it is possible to conclude that the
mod process is widely utilized in the gaming community,
with numerous benefits and few disadvantages, but numerous
challenges. The current strategy to mod development lacks
a standardized protocol, as it is being conducted in an ad-
hoc manner. Therefore, the primary objective of this research
paper is to categorize the fundamental attributes, techniques,
and resources employed in mod development.
In subsequent research efforts, it is anticipated that the
insights gleaned from this comprehensive analysis will serve
as a foundation for the development of an innovative mod
creation methodology.
