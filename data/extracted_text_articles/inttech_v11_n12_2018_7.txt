Abstract—The objective of this research is to continue our 
journey into determining whether the blogosphere, as a type of 
social media platform, can be used to disseminate information 
regarding the socio-political views and concerns of citizens 
within a specific community. We expand upon our example 
case of focusing on information relative to the Venezuelan 
community regarding the current Venezuelan socio-economic 
crisis. Are Venezuelan blogs being used to discuss socio-
political events and the quality of life concerns that are 
associated with the economic crisis in that community? Are 
Venezuelans using blogs to discuss possible migration away 
from the region as a result of these concerns? The Blogtrackers 
tool was used to analyze almost 30,000 Venezuelan blog posts 
collected between August 2003 and March 2017. Our analysis 
showed that the blogosphere is indeed being used as a platform 
by citizens to discuss these issues. We show how the posting 
frequency, sentiment, and keyword trends have changed over 
time relative to the changes in the socio-political landscape of 
the region and the events surrounding them. Of particular 
interest is the keyword trend analysis that shows that blogs are 
being used to discuss issues associated with quality of life 
factors and interest in migration away from Venezuela as a 
result of the crisis. We believe that this study can be used as a 
starting point to show the value of analyzing blogs in helping to 
identify humanitarian needs, in facilitating assistance efforts, 
and in drafting policy decisions. 
Keywords- blogosphere; situation awareness; socio-political; 
social media data analysis; migration; Venezuela; Blogtrackers. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an expanded version of the earlier work by 
Mead et al. [1], which established the basis for using blog 
analysis for studying socio-political awareness. Social media 
platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and blogs 
have changed the way citizens express and share their 
sentiments regarding socio-political situations within their 
communities, and have created a space for citizen journalism 
[2]. These new mediums of communication have also 
allowed for citizen sentiment to be channelized from the 
online forum to the streets in the form of public debates and 
protests. Tufekci and Wilson [3], for example, demonstrated 
that participation in protests, both before and on the first day 
of the Tahrir Square demonstrations was elicited by 
information that citizens posted on blogs, Facebook, and 
Twitter. 
A blog is a “personalized webpage, kept by the author in 
reverse chronological diary form” [4]. Blogs give people a 
social identity and are a medium for association, self-
expression, and dissemination of information [5]. Blogs can 
be a very effective way to gain an in-depth understanding of 
issues and events due to the fact that recording, revisiting, 
and reflecting on the past is possible through previous blog 
entries. The ability for readers to leave comments in an 
interactive environment is an important part of blogging.  
Blogs serve as an interactive platform for information 
exchange and discussion, and provide useful information 
about events [6]. Blogs serve as a way for citizens to gain 
situational awareness of the socio-political landscape of their 
environment, and data experts who track and analyze blogs 
can gain an understanding of the perspectives and intentions 
that exist among citizens. The Blogtrackers tool [7] was used 
to analyze a large dataset of Venezuelan blogs to determine 
whether the blogosphere is being used to disseminate 
information about issues stemming from the Venezuelan 
socio-economic crisis, and, if so, how this content is 
changing over time. This information is particularly helpful 
for emergency responders, and policy and decision makers 
leading humanitarian assistance efforts. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
reviews the currently published literature and related work 
regarding citizen use of social media platforms relative to the 
attainment of situational awareness of socio-political issues. 
Section III explains the methodology used such as the data 
collection 
process 
and 
the 
Blogtrackers 
tool 
(http://blogtrackers.host.ualr.edu/Blogtrackers/). Section IV 
provides a discussion of the data analysis results. Section V 
concludes the study outlining future research directions.

RELATED WORK 
In this section we discuss the various previously 
published work related to the analysis of social media data 
as a means for studying socio-political awareness. 
A. Informational Power of Social Media Platforms 
Many sources highlight the power of social media 
platforms such as blogs, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to 
be effective tools for allowing citizens to engage in socio-
political 
scenarios 
such 
as 
obtaining 
information, 
disseminating information, participating in socio-political 
discussions, and becoming mobilized to act or to participate 
in impactful events [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. 
Additionally, some sources focus on or add that the 
effectiveness of social media platforms as informational and 
motivational tools can be leveraged by organizations for 
crisis management and emergency response [8, 11, 15, 17, 
18, 19, 20, 21]. Much of the literature highlights the power 
70

of social media platforms by using the example of the 2010 
protests in Egypt, followed by an Egyptian Revolution in 
2011, wherein the public used social media to communicate 
their dissatisfaction with socio-political issues such as 
poverty, unemployment, corruption, high prices, repression, 
and human rights abuse [9, 10, 11, 16, 22, 23]. 
B. New Media Versus Traditional Media 
Many sources refer to social media platforms as “New 
Media” [13, 16, 24], “Participatory Media” [9, 25], and 
“Modern Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICTs)” [13, 16, 22, 23], and draw a contrast with 
“Traditional Media” platforms such as television, newspaper, 
and radio (especially, state-controlled traditional media) [9, 
11, 13, 14, 16, 22, 24, 25]. Valentini et al. [14] showed that 
crises tend to be communicated or framed differently within 
the writings of new media (specifically blogs) than they are 
within the writings of traditional media. Some sources 
contend that citizens are increasingly using social media sites 
for obtaining and disseminating socio-political information 
due to the perceived or real incompetence of or censoring by 
state-owned media outlets [16, 22, 24]. 
C. A Focus on the Blogosphere 
Using the possibility of migration due to the Venezuelan 
economic crisis as a case study, Mead et al. established the 
basis for using blog analysis for studying socio-political 
awareness [1]. Before Mead et al., only a small pool of 
sources focus specifically on blogs as a means for obtaining 
and disseminating socio-political information [22, 26, 13, 
14]. The number of blogs has been said to double every five 
months; they are easily found and can be accessed freely by 
anyone with an internet connection [13]. Al-Ani et al. [22] 
highlighted the power blogs played in mobilizing citizens 
during the Egyptian revolution of early 2011. Blogs 
represent a “counter-narrative” to the government-controlled 
media especially during times of crisis, and provide a means 
to voice dissent and to challenge authoritative power [22]. 
Blogs provide a means to potentially develop and maintain a 
strong sense of community among citizens interested in 
certain themed topics [26]. Additionally, blogs often-times 
represent “citizen-based news sources” that challenge 
traditional media in terms of the ability to form public 
opinion [14]. The information posted on blogs and the 
commentary reactions to the posts, therefore, have become 
of increasing interest to social media researchers. 
D. Cybersecurity Issues 
Some sources highlight the potential cybersecurity issues 
related to the use of social media platforms for spreading 
situational awareness in terms of socio-political issues [27, 
25, 11]. Fearn [27] warns that “cybercriminals” are 
increasingly using programs called “bots” to attack social 
media users via Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube with 
negative comments and to spread disinformation or fake 
news via these platforms. Since the blogosphere is also a 
social media platform, the potential for blogs to be used 
nefariously by bots can be argued [25]. Goolsby et al. [25] 
also argue that social media can be used to broadcast “hoax 
messages”, which can “hide among the stream of natural 
messages and be accepted…”. 
E. Methodologies for Analyzing Blog Data 
A review of the literature shows a variety of 
methodologies for conducting data analysis on blog data. Al-
Ani et al. [22] utilized the technique of topic modeling on 
blog data to ascertain how blog topics changed over time 
between 2004 and 2011. The topic modeling technique 
revealed time-specific themes in the blog data that could then 
be compared with public events and citizen actions such as 
protests [22]. Berendt et al. [26] used text and graph mining 
to analyze blog data. The text mining revealed the word 
themes in the data; whereas the graph mining exposed the 
connections between the bloggers in terms of their use of 
these words/themes [26]. In addition to longitudinal content 
analysis, Valentini et al. [14] applied sentiment analysis to 
blog data wherein they attempted to assign the sentiment 
values of neutral, positive, or negative to each blog post. 
Their analysis revealed interesting time-relevant topics and 
associated sentiments, such as a strong lack of trust in public 
and private governing entities surrounding political issues 
[14]. 
F. Migration Potential Resulting from Socio-Political 
Crisis? 
Google [28] created an interactive data visualization for 
tracking the interest in migrating to various countries of 
destination from specific countries of origin. Of particular 
interest is the data visualization showing a ranking of 1 to 
211 based on user search counts about migrating to the 
United States from within a particular country. For example, 
Venezuela is “ranked 105 out of 211 countries for Google 
searches for immigration to the United States from 2014-
2015” [28]. According to numerous sources, Venezuelans 
are protesting against their government due to such reasons 
as unemployment or low income, lack of access to basic 
needs such as food and medicine for themselves and their 
children, and political corruption [29, 11, 30]. Although the 
Google search data visualizations [28] precludes many of the 
Venezuelan issues that have been recently reported, one can 
still ask the question of whether or not there is potential for 
Venezuelans to migrate away from the many problems that 
they have been experiencing in their specific socio-political 
crisis? An analysis of numerous active Venezuelan-specific 
blogs was conducted to provide insights. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this section we discuss the methodology for this study 
including how the data set was obtained and the data 
analysis methods used. 
A. Data Collection, Cleaning, and Indexing 
Using the Blogtrackers tool, three steps were executed in 
order to crawl and collect the data from an identified set of 
Venezuelan blogs: (1) exploring the blog site, (2) crawling 
the blog site, and (3) cleaning and storing the data in a 
database for analysis and retrieval (Fig. 1). Hussain et al. 
provide a detailed explanation of the mechanics of the 
71

Blogtrackers tool in “Analyzing the Voices during European 
Migrant Crisis in Blogosphere” [31]. 
 
1) Exploring the blog site: Several blog sites were 
identified that specifically discussed issues relevant to 
Venezuela. Subsequently, each site was explored to 
determine whether their structure was ideal for use with the 
Blogtrackers tool. It was also important that the blog 
continually be focused on Venezuelan topics and contain 
specific metadata attributes for each post such as author, 
title, and date. 
 
 
Figure 1. Data collection process. 
 
2) Crawling the data: The Web Content Extractor 
(WCE) tool [32] (Fig. 2) was then used to collect data from 
each blog site. Once the crawler is set up, the tool begins 
from a set of seed URLs—the blog sites’ home pages—and 
advances through each blog post to extract all of the desired 
attributes. 
 
 
Figure 2. Web Content Extractor. 
 
3) Cleaning and Storing the Data: A three-step cleaning 
process was used. (1) Clean from within WCE by deleting 
empty fields and advertisement URLs. (2) Clean with SQL 
queries to select validated and verified data. (3) Clean with a 
script to standardize attributes, extract metadata, sentiments, 
and outbound URLs. 
B. Analyzing the Data with Blogtrackers 
Blogtrackers is a tool designed to explore the 
blogosphere and gain insights about events and how these 
events are perceived in the blogging community [33]. After 
setting up a Venezuelan blog tracker, five features of the 
Blogtrackers tool were used to analyze the resultant dataset.  
 
1) Posting Frequency 
The “Posting Frequency” feature was utilized to identify 
any unusual patterns in the blog postings. This aids in 
detecting real-time events that interested the blogging 
community. The user can click on any data point on the 
graph to get a detailed list of the named-entities mentioned in 
blog posts during that time-period. This feature also displays 
a list of active bloggers with number of posts. Fig. 3 shows 
the posting frequency for Venezuelan blogs from 2003 to 
2017.

captions. 
 
2) Keyword Trends 
The “Keyword Trends” feature was used to provide an 
overall trend for keywords of interest. It helps track changes 
in topics of interest in the blogging community. The user 
can select any data point on the trendline to view all the 
blogs and a network of co-occurring named-entities. Fig. 4 
shows the keyword trends related to the ongoing 
Venezuelan socio-political crisis.

“Economic crisis” for 2016. 
Reader is encouraged to use digital version for better readability of images, labels, legends, and 
captions. 
 
3) Sentiments and Tonality 
The “Sentiments and Tonality” feature was used to 
display the trend of positive and negative sentiments of 
blogs for a selected time-period (Fig. 5).

and captions. 
 
The sentiment and tonality features are defined by 
Pennebaker et al. [34, 35] and as calculated by the 
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software [36]. 
Additionally, a data analyst can drill down by clicking on 
any point of interest and view radar charts (Fig. 6), which 
display tonality attributes such as personal concerns, time 
orientation, core drives, and cognitive process.

captions. 
 
4) Influence 
The “Influence” feature was used to identify the 
influence of a blogger or a post. Agarwal et al. discussed the 
concept of bloggers’ influence [6]. The “Influence” feature 
of the Blogtrackers tool can display the influence trends 
over time for the top 5 influential bloggers (Fig. 7). Clicking 
on a point on the trend line allows a deeper dive into the 
data by displaying the most influential posts for that period. 
Additionally, a user can explore the content themes of 
active-influential, inactive-influential, active-non influential, 
and inactive-non influential bloggers.

Reader is encouraged to use digital version for better readability of images, labels, legends, and 
captions. 
 
5) Additional Blog Information 
The “Additional Blog Info” feature was used to provide 
additional information about a specific blog. A dashboard-
like screen is presented to the user, revealing the posting 
trends and sentiments of the selected blogs, as well as a list 
of the underlying URLs and domains. Fig. 8 shows this 
feature being used to look at a specific blog from the 
database called, “Caracas Chronicles”. At a glance, we can 
see some interesting things about this particular blog; such 
as, it is most active on Monday’s; it was most active during 
the month of February in 2014, December in 2015, and 
April in 2016; and there was more negative sentiment in 
2016 than in 2015.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
 In this section we describe the database of Venezuelan 
blog posts that we collected in accordance to our above-
mentioned methodology, and we discuss details from our 
data analysis methods. 
A. Venezuelan Blog Database 
To assess whether Venezuelan blogs were discussing 
issues related to the economic crisis in Venezuela, 40 blog 
sites were identified. The blogs were found using simple 
manual search techniques on various platforms, such as 
google.com, blogsearchengine.org, and fastblogfinder.com. 
The blogs were reviewed by our research team to ensure 
that they fit the structure required by the WCE and the 
Blogtrackers tool. A final dataset of 29,493 blog posts was 
obtained between August 27, 2003 and March 26, 2017. A 
total of 177,870 links were extracted (120,296 being distinct 
links) from 13,590 domains and 749,829 entities. The post 
sentiments were also extracted. Table I provides the 
language distribution for this dataset.

B. Posting Frequency of Venezuelan Blogs 
Fig. 9 shows a more detailed view of blog posting 
frequency from January 2015 to March 2017, which 
indicates a continuous increase. Specifically, blogging 
activity increased drastically between March 2016 and 
January 2017.  
 
 
Figure 9. Change in Venezuelan blog posting frequency from January 2015 
to May 2017. 
Reader is encouraged to use digital version for better readability of images, labels, legends, 
and captions 
 
This increase corresponds to news reports of hundreds of 
thousands of people beginning to take to the streets in 
protest during early September of 2016 [37]. Between the 
beginning of January, 2015 and the beginning of March, 
2017, blogging frequency can be said to have notably risen 
by the beginning of June, 2016 (increasing by about 50%) 
(Fig. 9). 
C. Keyword Trendlines for Venezuelan Blog 
To further assess the extent of the impact of the crisis on 
Venezuelan citizens, the dataset was searched for quality of 
life keywords such as “need food”, “need water”, “need 
petrol”, “need medicine”, “high prices”, and “inflation”. The 
resultant keyword trendlines indicated that the occurrence of 
these quality of life factors fluctuated over time (Fig. 10). 
The occurrence of English keywords related to quality of 
life such as “need food”, “food shortage”, “high prices”, 
“need water”, “need petrol”, “need medicine”, and 
“inflation” all began to notably increase beginning around 
January 1, 2012 (Fig. 10).

keywords over time.

captions. 
 
Trading Economics data shows that beginning January, 
2012, crude oil prices began to decline and the Venezuelan 
monetary exchange rate plummeted [39, 40]. Of the above-
mentioned keywords, “need petrol” was the most prevalent 
since around mid-2013 through January 1, 2017, spiking 
dramatically in early January of 2016. On February 18, 
2016, CNN Money reported that on the previous day, 
Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro announced a 
6,000% price increase for gasoline/petrol in Venezuela [41]. 
Additionally, of these keywords, “high prices”, “need food”, 
74
International Journal on Advances in Internet Technology, vol 11 no 1 & 2, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/

“need water”, and “need medicine” were the next highest 
ranking, respectively. This ranking order of occurrence 
remained the same from early January 2014 through the end 
of 2016. Beginning early January 2016, however, the 
occurrence of all of these keywords began to decline 
through early January of 2017. A broader look from January 
2015 through March 2017 reveals a spike in the occurrence 
of the keyword “high prices” in early May 2015 and again 
in early February 2016. The spike in early May 2015 may 
correspond to incidents of raids on Venezuelan markets by 
“black-market foot soldiers” beginning in early April [42]. 
This broader view also shows a spike in the occurrence of 
“need petrol” in early February 2016. The count declines 
from the rest of February 2016 to early March 2016, then 
begins to climb again through early May 2016. There was a 
drastic increase beginning early July 2016, which peaked in 
early November 2016. There was steady decline from early 
January 2017 to March 2017, where the occurrence of the 
keyword “need petrol” returned to levels closer to the other 
noted keywords. The keyword “need food” broke out to 
become the second-highest occurring keyword beginning 
early July 2016 (recall the NYT report of Venezuelans 
ransacking stores). It held this position through March 2017, 
closely followed by “high prices”, which exceeded it 
slightly and briefly in early January 2017. The occurrence of 
“need medicine” also rose significantly from early July 
2016 through early August 2016. The occurrence of “need 
water” rose to the fourth-highest position from early 
September 2016 through late October 2016. 
Trendlines for the Spanish equivalents for these quality 
of life keywords were also generated (Fig. 11). For example, 
similar to the increase in blog posting frequency, the quality 
of life keywords trends figures each show a large increase in 
frequency beginning near early September of 2016 [37, 43]. 
The occurrence of the Spanish equivalents of many of these 
keywords related to quality of life such as “escasez de 
alimentos”, “necesito agua”, “inflacion”, “cuidado de la 
salud”, “necesito comida”, “altos precios”, “necesito 
medicina”, and “necesito gasolina” also saw variation over 
time (Fig. 11). The occurrence of the Spanish keyword 
“inflacion” (inflation) did not register on the graphical 
output for January 1, 2003 to January 1, 2017, and “necesito 
gasolina” (need gasoline) barely registered. The occurrence 
of “escasez de alimentos” (food shortage) and “cuidado de 
la salud” (health care) mirrored each other, beginning to 
increase in early January 2013, increasing further sharply in 
early January 2015, peaking in late December 2016, and 
dropping sharply through early January 2017. “Necesito 
agua” (need water) consistently held the second-highest 
occurrence count notably from early January 2014 through 
early January 2017, with a breakout spike between early 
January to late December 2015. Also through this early 
January to late December 2015 timeframe, “altos precios” 
(high prices), “necesito medicina” (need medicine), and 
“necesito comida” (need food) held the next highest count 
rankings, respectively. “Necesito agua” (need water) saw a 
spike in occurrence count between early January 2008 and 
early January 2009. A broader look at the occurrence of the 
Spanish keywords from January 2015 through March 2017 
reveals that “cuidado de la salud” (health care) and “escasez 
de alimentos” (food shortage) consistently mirrored each 
other and held the top rank for most occurring of the quality 
of life keywords. “cuidado de la salud” and “escasez de 
alimentos” occurred at least 50% more of the time than the 
others from early January to early March 2015, then 
beginning again from mid-November 2015. Although 
experiencing a short decline from early June to early July 
2016, the count of these two keywords continued to rise 
through their peak in early December 2016. They began to 
decline sharply from early January 2017, returning to near 
January 2015 levels by early March 2017. “Necesito agua” 
began in a breakout rise in early May 2016, with a mild 
spike in early June 2016 (corresponding to the NYT’s story 
of ransacking stores), another spike in early December 
2016, then a slow decline through early March 2017. “Altos 
precios”, “necesito medicina”, “inflacion”, and “necesito 
comida” (in that apparent ranking order) only began to 
register on the data visualization from around early October 
2016 through around early January 2017. “Necesito 
gasolina” barely registered on the data visualization in this 
14-month period except from early November 2016 to 
around mid-February 2017.

These quality of life keywords may represent a set of 
motivational factors leading to an interest in Venezuelan 
citizens migrating away from Venezuela. To explore this 
suggestion, we generated several trendlines for keywords 
such as “immigrate”, “migrate”, “emigrate”, and “leave 
Venezuela” (Fig. 12).  
 
 
 
Figure 12. English keyword trendlines for various keywords that possibly 
indicate migration interest over time.

captions. 
 
The frequency of occurrence of the keyword, “leave 
Venezuela” seems to drastically increase between the end of 
2015 and beginning of 2016. The keyword “leave 
Venezuela” began to increase dramatically in occurrence 
beginning early January 2013 through its peak of almost 
10,000 posts in late December 2015, with the most notable 
rise being between early January 2015 and late December 
2015. According to a report by United Press International, in 
2016, 75% of the Venezuelan population lost an average of 
19 pounds due to the effects of the economic crisis that was 
satirically referred to as the “Maduro Diet” [44]. By early 
January 2017, occurrences of “leave Venezuela” dropped 
down to about 3,000 (Fig. 12). The bottom chart of Fig 12 
kind of zooms in to show that the peak in occurrence of the 
keyword “leave Venezuela” actually occurred in early 
December 2016. 
Trendlines for the Spanish equivalents for these 
migration keywords were also generated (Fig. 13). It was 
revealed that the keywords “leave Venezuela” and 
“Venezuela” were almost identical, indicating that every 
time Venezuela was mentioned it was about leaving or 
migrating from Venezuela. As with the quality of life 
indicators, these migration-related keywords trends figures 
show a large increase in their frequency beginning in 2016, 
especially near early-September. Of the Spanish equivalents 
of English keywords that may be indicative of a desire to 
flee Venezuela, “salir de Venezuela” (leave Venezuela) was 
the only one that notably registered on the data visualization 
between early January 2003 and early January 2017 (Fig. 
13).

The others, “emigrar” (emigrate) and “inmigrar” 
(immigrate), barely registered. Occurrences of the keyword 
“salir de Venezuela” began to increase in early January 
2012 (recall the Trading Economics data showing the 
decline in both crude oil prices and the Venezuelan 
monetary exchange rate), peaking in late December 2016 
near 14,000, then beginning to decrease sharply through late 
December 2016 or early January 2017. According to a 
report by CNN Money, there was a 160% increase from 
2015 to 2016 in Venezuelans seeking U.S. asylum [45]. The 
most notable increases in the occurrence of the keyword 
“salir de Venezuela” (each at different rates) were between 
early January and late December 2013, early January 2014 
and early January 2015, and early January to late December 
2015. Between early January 2015 and early March 2017, 
“salir de Venezuela” occurred at least 50% more of the time 
than did the keywords “inmigrar” (immigrate) and 
“emigrar” (emigrate). At its peak for this date range, “salir

de Venezuela” occurred over 200% more often than 
“inmigrar” and “emigrar”. There was a slight decline in the 
occurrence of the keyword “salir de Venezuela” from early 
June to early July 2016. Subsequently, however, there was a 
resumption of the sharp rise of the occurrence of “salir de 
Venezuela” in early July 2016 (again, recall the NYT’s 
story of the ransacking of Venezuelan stores). The keyword 
“emigrar” (emigrate) began to register slightly more on the 
data visualization from around early November through 
around mid-December 2016. 
D. Timeline of Sentiments Among the Venezuelan Blogs 
Recall that Fig. 5 shows the prevailing sentiment of the 
blogs for a specific time period. Fig. 14 provides a more 
detailed view of how the sentiment of the Venezuelan blogs 
has changed over time. The graphical output appears to 
show a sharp shift to a prevailing positive sentiment in early 
January 2016. This could correspond to the Venezuelan 
leader, Nicholas Maduro, declaring a 60-day economic 
emergency for the region in order to give himself power “to 
pay for welfare services and food imports” [43]. 
Subsequently, however—and although many blog posts 
were identified as having a negative sentiment—the 
prevailing sentiment of the blogs has been positive for the 
past two years. This prevailing positive sentiment seems 
counterintuitive, as we expected to see a prevailing negative 
sentiment due to the ongoing Venezuelan economic crisis 
and continued reports of Venezuelan citizens protesting in 
the streets. Therefore, we believe that the concept of 
sentiment with regard to this dataset needs to be addressed 
further in future work involving a more detailed dataset and 
a possible revision of how sentiment is calculated. 
Consequently, for this paper, we can only conclude that the 
graphical output at this time does not seem to reveal any 
significant differences over time with regard to the concept 
of sentiment, and appears to only fluctuate along with the 
recorded count of blog posts. Regardless, the visualization 
shows that between early January 2015 and early March 
2017, the overall sentiment of the Venezuelan blog posts 
was predominantly positive (there were more blog posts 
rated “positive” than there were those rated “negative”) 
(Fig. 14). The difference (spread) between the number of 
Venezuelan blog posts rated “positive” and the number of 
blog posts rated “negative” was relatively small (from about 
50 to 150) from early January through around mid-
November 2015. Although the number of blog posts rated 
“positive” and the number of blog posts rated “negative” 
both continued to increase between mid-November 2015 
and early January 2017, the spread widened most notably 
between early April and early June 2016, then again 
between early September 2016 through early January 2017. 
Between mid-year 2007 and mid-year 2009, there were 
more Venezuelan blog posts rated “positive” than there 
were blog posts rated “negative”. Between early January 
2010 and early January 2012, the number of blog posts rated 
“positive” and the number of blog posts rated “negative” 
were roughly equal. In early January 2013, the spread 
(difference) between the number of blog posts rated 
“positive” and the number of blog posts rated “negative” 
began to widen, with more being “positive”. Again, this 
seems odd in light of the fact that Venezuela entered into a 
deep recession beginning January 2014 [46].  
Although fluctuating in size, this positive-dominated 
spread continued through at least early January 2017. The 
bottom chart of Fig. 14 shows the number of blog posts 
rated as having a “positive” sentiment relative to the number 
of blog posts rated as having a “negative” sentiment for 
each day from May 2, 2016 to June 30, 2016.

During this time range, the number of blog posts rated 
“positive” always exceeded the number of blog posts rated 
“negative”, although only slightly for at least seven dates. 
On at least four dates, the number of blog posts rated 
“positive” sharply exceeded the number of blog posts rated 
“negative”; for example, on May 13, May 26, May 30, and 
June 26. Reuters reported that on May 13, 2016, Maduro 
declared a 60-day “state of emergency” [47]. News reports 
for May 26, 2016 also include topics related to the “state of 
emergency” declaration; Reuters reported that Venezuelan 
opposition to Maduro, essentially, warned him against 
corruption related to contracts with foreign companies [48]. 
On May 30, 2016, BBC News reported that eleven people 
were killed in a recession-related shooting in Trujillo state 
[49]. Finally, on June 26, 2016, NPR broadcasted a story on 
its “All Things Considered” radio program discussing how 
Venezuelans are running out of food and medicine [50]. At 
least one date stands out on the graph where the number of 
blog posts rated “negative” rose to almost reach the number 
of blog posts rated “positive”—June 23, 2016. The 
Washington Post reported that on that date (June 23, 2016) 
the Organization of American States met and argued for a 
recall referendum against Maduro [51]. Curiously, the 
bottom-most chart of Figure 14 seems to show that on May 
28, 2016 there were barely any blog posts. This may be due 
to the system of scheduled electricity blackouts that the 
Venezuelan government was implementing as reported by 
The NYT on this date [52]. 
E. Tonality of Venezuelan Blogs 
Recall that Fig. 6 displays the feature of Blogtrackers 
that shows tonality attributes of individual blog posts. For 
example, for two random Venezuelan blog posts in our 
dataset, the predominant personal concerns were “Work” 
and “Money”. The predominant time orientation was 
“Present focus”. The predominant attribute for core drives 
and needs was “Power” (and to a lesser extent 
“Achievement”). The predominant cognitive process was 
not as clear, varying among that of “Differentiation”, 
“Tentativeness”, and “Cause”. The predominant summary 
variable 
was 
“Analytical 
Thinking”. 
Finally, 
the 
predominant sentiment/emotion for this timeframe was 
“Anger”. We did not analyze the tonality feature further for 
this paper, but believe that the concept should be examined 
in future work. 
F. Influential Venezuelan Bloggers 
Recall that Fig. 7 shows the top 5 influential bloggers for 
a specified time period. Blogtrackers calculates influence 
based on the definitions and algorithms developed by 
Agarwal et al. [25]. Fig. 15 is another example of the 
feature, using January 2015 to March 2017 as the selected 
time-period of analysis. One blogger, “Daniel”, was 
consistently more influential than other bloggers [53]. We 
did not analyze this feature further for this paper, but believe 
that the concept of influence within the blogosphere should 
be examined in future work. With fluctuating levels of 
influence, between late December 2015 and early March 
2017, the five most influential authors of the Venezuelan 
blogs 
in 
our 
database 
were 
“Francisco 
Toro”, 
“mesaredondacontracomunistabg”, “Juan Cristobal Nagel”, 
“Manuel Madrid” and “Daniel” (Fig. 15). “Manuel Madrid” 
only seemed to be active during early December 2015. 
“Francisco Toro” apparently didn't begin activity until early 
June 2015, and ceased being active in early January 2017. 
“Juan Cristobal Nagel” apparently ceased being active in 
early June 2016 (again, this date corresponds to the NYT’s 
story of Venezuelans ransacking stores). The most 
consistent and predominantly influential blogger was 
“Daniel”. “Daniel” was notably the most-influential blogger 
during at least three key date categories: early March 2015, 
early December 2015, and early June 2016.

G. Socio-politico-economic Awareness 
One event can be said to have corresponded to numerous 
spikes (or otherwise noticeable changes in various data 
categories—early June of 2016.  June 19, 2016 is when news 
reports emerged of Venezuelans ransacking stores out of 
desperation stemming from food shortages and high prices. 
This event seemed to spark bloggers to increase their posting 
frequency. This event also seemed to cause bloggers to 
increase their use of the keywords “necesito agua” (need 
water). Additionally, and although the data show a seeming 
decline from early June to early July of 2016, the use of the 
keyword “salir de Venezuela” (leave Venezuela) quickly 
resumed in frequency in early July of 2016; perhaps 
communicating an increasing level of frustration with the 
economic conditions.  This pattern with the frequency of the 
keywords “salir de Venezuela” comes on the heals, however, 
of another data pattern that popped out in the visualizations 
that show that the frequency of the use of the keywords 
“cuidado de salud” (healthcare) and “escasez de alimentos” 
(food shortage) experienced a short decline from early June 
to early July of 2016. Perhaps this means that instead of 
blogging about these two topics, the bloggers were 
discussing the possibility of migration. The data also showed 
78
International Journal on Advances in Internet Technology, vol 11 no 1 & 2, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/

that the number of blog posts rated as having a positive 
sentiment began to decline around the time of this event. In 
fact, the number of blog posts rated as having a negative 
sentiment rose to almost reach the number of blog posts rated 
as having a positive sentiment around June 23, 2016.  
Another characteristic of the data that seemed to correspond 
to this event is that one of the top five most influential 
bloggers, “Juan Cristobal Nagel” apparently ceased being 
active in early June 2016, which, although speculation, 
causes one to wonder if these harsh economic conditions 
were behind his exit from the Venezuelan blogosphere. 
Ultimately, however, these patterns in the data seem to 
suggest that indeed bloggers, especially the Spanish-
language bloggers, are raising awareness of these socio-
political events. 
V. 
CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 
This paper extends the work by Mead et al. that 
established the basis for using blog analysis for studying 
socio-political awareness. This approach remains novel in 
that few researchers have specifically focused on analyzing 
blogs, and instead focus on other social media platforms, 
such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. As a detailed 
example, this research showed that Venezuelan blogs are 
being used to disseminate socio-political information in an 
attempt to increase awareness of events and sentiments 
during the Venezuelan economic crisis. Our analysis showed 
that the frequency and content of blog posts changed over 
time, reflecting changes in the socio-politico-economic 
landscape of the region—such as protests and other news 
events, the documented decline in quality of life factors such 
as the need for food and medicine, and expressed interest in 
migration away from Venezuela. The sentiment of the blogs 
seemed to change over time as well, but the overall 
sentiment 
analysis 
was 
inconclusive 
and 
seemed 
counterintuitive and therefore the concept needs to be 
addressed further in future work. For example, the number of 
blog posts that were rated as having a positive sentiment far 
exceeded the number of blog posts rated as having a negative 
sentiment even when the dates revolved around significant 
events such as on June 26, 2016, which was only a few days 
after news reports emerged of Venezuelans ransacking stores 
out of desperation. We believe, however, that blog 
analysis—with Blogtrackers and other tools—can continue 
to be used to gauge socio-political awareness of important 
issues among various populations. This paper continues to 
develop the stage for future work using Blogtrackers and 
other natural language processing tools and techniques for 
blog analysis as a possible approach for anticipating events 
(e.g., protests, migration, refugee scenarios). Future work 
may also include further analysis of the concepts of blog 
tonality 
and 
blogger 
influence. 
Specifically, 
further 
understanding blogger influence is of great importance due 
to 
the 
emergent 
concepts 
of 
fake 
news, 
opinion 
manipulation, and disinformation campaigns. Broadly 
speaking, however, this particular study sheds a spotlight on 
the blogosphere’s role in assessing situation awareness of a 
region engulfed in socio-politico-economic crisis. We 
believe that the information derived from monitoring blogs 
can provide actionable insights to local emergency 
responders 
(i.e., 
real-time 
blog 
monitoring), 
and 
humanitarian assistance organizations and policy decision 
makers (i.e., based on short- and long-term trend analysis).
