Abstract— Widespread use of the Web and other Internet
technologies in postsecondary education has exploded in
the last 15 years. Using a set of items developed by the

studies show a general positive relationship between the

forecast that by 2018, 51% of Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) jobs will be in
computing.

INTRODUCTION
There has been a rapid infusion of technology into
traditional
instruction
methods
utilized
in
higher
education [9] [11]. Using a set of tools developed by
the National Survey of Student Engagement, research
studies show a general positive relationship between
the use the of Web Based Education technologies,
student engagement, and learning outcomes. Recent
studies forecast that by 2018, 51% of STEM jobs will
be in computing [1]. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2008-
2018 Employment states that 75% of all engineering
jobs in the U.S. are going to be in computing,
organized as shown in Figure 1 [2].
Roadmap: In Section 2, we discuss the motivations
to use educational technology in web-based courses. In
Section 3, we discuss the video management web-
based system used by Auburn to facilitate online
learning for off-campus students. In Section 4, we talk
about a tool that provides our students training to learn
MS Office in the most convenient manner possible. We
conclude our findings and experience in Section 5.
II.
MOTIVATION FOR USING WEB-BASED
EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES
Auburn University enables all faculty members to
use the Canvas learning management system [3] hosted
by Amazon Web Services cloud [4] to deliver all
courses.
Canvas is fully intergraded with Banner [5] (an
administrative
software
package
and
a
highly-
integrated web-based system with a common database
that is shared by everyone who uses it). Canvas is
substantially conformant with Level A and Level AA
of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version
2.0 (WCAG 2.0) [6]. Canvas includes: lectures,
assignments, practice tests, exams, grades, links to
other related sites, other student resources; see Figure
2. Students and instructors have constant access to
these resources.
III.
VIDEO MANAGEMENT WEB-BASED SYSTEM
For distance learning courses, Ponopto [7] video
management system is used to manage, live stream,
record, and share videos, and is fully integrated with
Canvas learning system; see Figure 3.

TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT WEB-BASED
APPLICATIONS
MyITLab
[8]
is
a
personalized
cloud-based
application, providing high-fidelity HTML5 Office
Simulations for teaching and learning digital literacy
and Microsoft Office productivity.
Students
have
a
realistic,
simulated
training
environment that allows them to learn Microsoft Office
skills. It offers help and hints that use multiple methods
of completion, is automatically graded, and provides
feedback so they can see what they've done incorrectly.
Instructors can easily assess their students' Word,
Excel, Access, and PowerPoint skills by assigning
projects that are submitted and immediately graded by
MyITLab's Grader engine. The engine also captures
potential integrity violations at both the document and

content level to ensure students are completing their
own work.
MyITLab [8] includes a road map for continued
accessibility enhancements that meets WCAG 2.0. The
MyITLab interface features several aids for low-vision
and
mobility-impaired
users,
including:
voicing,
keyboard controls, and adjustable screen settings: The
Accessibility Mode brings up the Accessibility Toolbar,
which reads MyITLab aloud, highlights text as it is
read, and provides options to translate the MyITLab
interface into several languages [10][11]. The new
MyITLab Virtual Keyboard is designed to ensure that
every student can complete the simulation activity (see
Figure 4).
This
keyboard
allows
for
users
with
visual
impairments, with non-PC hardware, such as a Mac
computer, to enjoy the same user experience.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Web Based Education Technologies are rapidly and
fundamentally changing higher education, enabling
students to learn what they want, when they want, and
how they want. Many developing countries don’t have
access to Web Based Education
Institutions of higher education also have the ethical
responsibility of providing learning opportunities to all.
Constructive
partnerships
between
publishing,
education
and
assistive
technology
companies,
academia and governmental education institutions are
vital for maximizing the success, and inclusiveness of
the Web Based teaching and learning.
