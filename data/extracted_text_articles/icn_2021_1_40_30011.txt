Abstract— Among the protocols available for Internet of 
Things (IoT) applications, the Narrow Band-Internet of Things 
(NB-IoT) is one of the most relevant for presenting advantages, 
such as long range, low latency and low energy consumption. 
One of the points questioned for every protocol is the ability to 
serve applications that are in a mobile environment. To 
validate the possibility of the protocol working in this scenario, 
it is necessary to evaluate its performance in different 
propagation 
environments. 
This 
article 
presents 
field 
measurements that were made on an NB-IoT operational 
network in a suburban environment. The measurement results 
were compared with the results calculated on three 
propagation models used to predict loss of propagation in a 
mobile environment: Cost-231 Hata, ITU-1225 and Erceg 
Greenstein. Comparisons show that the Cost-231 Hata model 
offers the best performance in predicting propagation loss in 
the considered scenarios. These results provide relevant 
information about the performance of the propagation models 
used, applied to the NB-IoT protocol in a suburban 
environment.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A. Background 
The heterogeneous characteristics of communications 
between things introduce considerable challenges to the 
networks that are part of these new scenarios, including 
scalability, different traffic volumes, and Quality of Service 
(QoS) requirements. The requirements of the applications 
used by these devices can also vary from the sending of 
information with extremely low latency to the establishment 
of highly reliable and prioritized communication. The IoT 
networks should allow the communication of specific data 
rate and low complexity to meet all these critical 
requirements of the devices. There are also variations in 
coverage, where there is a possibility of areas with a radius 
from one meter to more than one kilometer [1].  
Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) networks 
were designed to meet long-range coverage applications. 
There are solutions proposed to work in unlicensed bands, 
like LoRA and SigFox [2][3], and others to operate in mobile 
communications bands, such as NB-IoT, which was designed 
to work with Long Term Evolution (LTE) [4]. 
NB-IoT is a promising technology developed to support 
massive implementations with low data rates and narrow 
bandwidth [5]. It also offers low-cost devices, battery life of 
more than ten years, and great capacity [6]. It can be 
deployed in three different modes: (i) stand-alone, as a 
dedicated carrier (200KHz channel), (ii) in-band, within the 
occupied bandwidth of a Physical Resource Block (PRB) 
carrier - 180KHz, and (iii) within a guarding period in the 
LTE carrier (PRB - 180KHz) [7]. It is interesting to note that 
the third mode presented allows NB-IoT support with 
minimal impact on LTE [8]. Figure 1 presents the joint NB-
IoT operation with the LTE structure. 
 
Figure 1. Operation Mode in-band and out-band. 
The highest modulation scheme considered in NB-IoT is 
the Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) [5], and only 
Frequency Duplexing Division mode (FDD) is supported. 
The multiple access scheme is identical to the LTE, i.e., 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) 
and Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(SC-FDMA) for downlink and uplink, respectively. In 
downlink transmission, only one PRB is used, whereas, in 
the uplink, there are two options: single-tone transmission 
and multi-tone transmission. In single-tone, the spacing 
between subcarriers can be 3.75KHz or 15KHz [9]. Multi-
tone enables sets of 3, 6, or 12 subcarriers. LTE’s protocols 
are used in totality by NB-IoT users, and five new physical 
channels should be introduced. A new category of user 
equipment, called Cat-N, came with NB-IoT [10]. In 
addition to operating in LTE bands, NB-IoT can also work 
on the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), 
which is seen as a significant advantage since GSM already 
has global coverage. In this case, the signal is transmitted in

standalone mode [4] and operates with 200kHz bandwidth, 
the same as in GSM [11].  
The range of NB-IoT technology is around 15 km, and 
the loss of extended coupling is approximately 20dB [7]. The 
operating frequencies available for NB-IoT are the same for 
LTE. 
B. Motivation 
Comparative analyses between real environments and 
empirical propagation models prove to be quite relevant for 
different protocols and technologies. They have a significant 
contribution to network planning and performance analysis 
of the adopted parameters [14]. 
Unlike protocols that operate in unlicensed frequency 
bands, protocols based on mobile communications networks, 
such as NB-IoT, are promising technologies developed to 
support massive deployments, with reduced data rates and 
narrow bandwidth [6]. However, their performance in mobile 
environments is not widely explored.  
The main objective of this study is to analyze the 
performance of the NB-IoT protocol. The chosen scenario 
was the suburban mobile environment in the city of Santa 
Rita do Sapucaí, Minas Gerais - Brazil, using the network 
installed by the operator TIM (Telecom Italia Mobile). The 
main goal is, based on field measuremts (using a Quectel test 
device BG96), to find the best propagation model to 
characterize the network’s performance. 
C. Paper Organization 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II summarizes the related work. Section III presents 
the propagation models considered in our analysis. Section 
IV presents the conditions of field measurements. Section V 
focuses on the performance analysis of the results. Section 
VI concludes the paper and suggests future works. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Several studies involving the performance of the NB-IoT 
protocol have been carried out to trace its performance in 
different scenarios. Also, comparative analyses between real 
environments and empirical propagation models prove to be 
quite relevant for different protocols and technologies as they 
have a significant contribution to network planning and 
performance analysis of the adopted parameters [14]. Ravi et 
al. [15] present the results obtained through experimental 
measurements to analyze the attenuation suffered in NB-IoT 
in indoor environments. According to Shin et al. [16], there 
are still many open problems concerning the link adaptation, 
performance analysis, and project optimization of the NB-
IoT. A study of the NB-IoT performance is presented by 
Adhikary et al. [17] with an analysis of the different NB-IoT 
channels in various scenarios, considering the Typical Urban 
(TU) channel model, however, in a static environment, 
without mobility. Finally, Ingabire et al. [18] present a 
comparative study between the LoRaWAN coverage and the 
Okumura-Hata, Cost 231-Hata, Extended-Hata, and ITU-R 
1225 propagation models in a static urban environment.  
The related work present analyzes the NB-IoT protocol, 
as well as its advantages and behavior analysis in certain 
scenarios. And there is a similar analysis that relates the 
LoRaWAN protocol to propagation models. 
III. PROPAGATION MODELS 
This section summarizes three propagation models used 
for this study: Cost-231 Hata, ITU-R 1225, and Erceg 
Greenstein models.  
A. Cost-231 Hata Model 
This model is an extension of the Okumura Hata model 
[19]. It is valid for frequencies between 500 MHz and 2000 
MHz and can be applied in urban, suburban, and rural 
settings. The path loss is computed using the expressions 
below [20]: 
PL (dB) = A + Blog(d) + C 
 
 
(1) 
where: 
A = 46.3 +33.9log10(fc) – 13.28log(hb) – a(hm) 
(2) 
fc is the frequency (MHz) 
hb is the base station antenna height (m) 
a(hm) for urban scenarios is defined as: 
a(hm) = 3.2(log(11.75hr))² - 4.97 
 
 
(3) 
hr is the device height (m) 
a(hm) for suburban scenarios is defined as: 
a(hm) = (1.1log(fc) – 0.7)hr – (1.56log(fc)*0.8) 
(4) 
B = 44.9 – 6.55log10(hb)  
 
 
(5) 
C = 0 for medium city and suburban areas and  
C = 3 for metropolitan areas 
B. ITU-R 1225 Model 
Defined by the International Telecommunication Union - 
Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) [21], this empirical and 
semi-deterministic model can be used in urban and suburban 
scenarios and was designed for frequencies around 2000 
MHz. In this model, the path loss is computed by (6). 
PL (dB) = 40log(d) + 30log(f) + 49  
 
(6) 
where d is the distance in kilometer and f is the frequency in 
MHz. 
C. Erceg Greenstein 
Erceg Greenstein is a statistical model derived from 
experimental data collected in the United States in 95 
macrocells. This model is applicable in suburban scenarios 
21

and has different categories for different terrain types [22]. 
The path loss in this model is computed by (7). 
PL (dB) = A + 10γlog(d/d0) + Xf + Xh 
 
(7) 
where; 
A = 20log(4πd0/λ) 
 
 
(8) 
γ = a – b*(hb) + c/hb 
 
 
(9) 
d = distance between the device and base station (m) 
d0 = 100m  
hb is the base station antenna height (m) 
Xf = 6log(fMhz/2000) 
 
 
(10) 
The parameter Xh is related to the type of terrain (A, B 
or C). Terrain A refers to hilly/moderate-to-heavy tree 
density. Terrain B refers to hilly/light tree density or 
flat/moderate-to-heavy tree density. Terrain C refers to 
flat/light tree density. 
 
For terrain types A and B: 
Xh = -10.8log(hm/2) 
 
 
(11) 
For terrain type C: 
Xh = -20log(hm/2) 
 
 
(12) 
where; 
 
h is the device antenna height (m) 
 
Also, parameters a, b and c are related to the type of terrain 
and are described in Table 1.

The choice for these models was based on the possibility 
of use in environments with mobility and on the similarity 
in the construction characteristics of each one, which 
include frequency, distance between the mobile device and 
the tower, height of the device, height of the tower, among 
others. 
IV. FIELD TEST MEASUREMENTS 
The scenario used in carrying out the measurements has 
a suburban profile with small obstructions caused by some 
low-rise buildings and constructions. The relief variation is 
approximately 50 meters. Routes that could totally obstruct 
the signal were avoided to prevent incorrect interpretations 
of the results, and the route layout also considered the need 
to repeat the experiment several times. It is important to 
note that an experiment refers to the round trip of the 
specified route. Twenty experiments were carried out on 
three routes within the city of Santa Rita do Sapucaí, and 
one route on the BR-459 highway in order to validate the 
behavior of the protocol at higher speeds, totaling the 
collection of 3000 samples.  
All routes started at the same location, a few meters 
from the tower where the transmitting antenna was installed. 
For route 1, the path was basically made in a straight 
line with some variations in altitude along the route. 
For route 2, the path traveled was crossing the city 
through the flatest part. The analyzed site presented 
residential buildings with no vegetation. 
Route 3 was made in the part of the city where there 
were hills. The place had a certain density of vegetation, and 
residential buildings. 
Finally, route 4 was carried out on the highway, having 
its format similar to route 1.

(c). Route 3. 
 
Figure 2(d). Route 4. 
As all routes presented similar characteristics with a 
certain density of vegetation and residential buildings, the 
environment was considered suburban. 
The routes carried out within the city covered 11 km, 6.5 
km and 8.7 km for routes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For these, 
the average travel speed was 30 km/h. The route carried out 
on the highway covered 15 km, at speeds of 40km/h, 60 
km/h and 80 km/h. Figures 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d illustrate the 
routes used in the experiments. 
A gateway Quectel model BG96 was used in the 
experiments. It is a wireless IoT communication module 
with LTE Cat M1, LTE Cat NB1, and General Packet Radio 
Services (EGPRS) functions. For the NB-IoT solution, the 
transmission power of the device is 23dBm. Also, it 
provides a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). 
The transmitting antenna information is in Table 2.

We used a Universal Subscriber Identification Module 
(USIMCard) from the operator TIM. The base station is 
located on the top of the Cruzeiro hill in Santa Rita do 
Sapucaí. 
V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
In this section, the NB-IoT coverage will be analyzed 
along the four traced routes, and a comparison will be made 
with the three propagation models presented. 
The conditions inserted in each propagation model for 
each route are presented in Table 3:

For each route, the measured values were compared with 
the values presented by the considered propagation models. 
The parameter used to represent the signal strength was the 
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) [22] measured 
in dBm. The analytical expression for the theoretical RSSI 
values is presented below: 
RSSI (dBm) = Pt + Gt + Gr – PL – A 
(13) 
where; 
 
Pt is the transmission power (dBm) 
Gt is the transmission gain (dBi) 
Gr is the reception gain (dBi) 
PL is the Path Loss (dB) 
A is the attenuation (dB) 
 
Figure 3 compares the measured values of RRSI 
(samples) for one route and the values predicted by the 
propagation models. 
To better interpret the measurements results, the 
measurement samples were grouped into clusters, with each 
cluster containing samples in a range between d - a and d + 
a, where d represents a given distance from the radio base. 
23

ICN 2021 : The Twentieth International Conference on Networks

After that, we computed the mean value of the RSSI, taking 
all samples belonging to the same cluster. Figures 4, 5 and 6 
show the average RSSI measured and the RSSI computed 
using the propagation models for urban routes 1, 2, and 4. 
For route 3, the graph was not represented in this paper, 
because the results are similar to the of route 2. 
Figure 3. Measurements (samples) obtained in one route in comparison 
with the propagation models. 
 
The behavior of the RSSI measurements are relatively 
similar in all these routes as the device moves away from the 
transmitting antenna. 
Finally, Figure 7 shows the result of the average RSSI 
considering the samples of all routes. 
Based on Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7, we can conclude that the 
Erceg Greenstein model is not accurate in predicting the 
propagation loss in the scenario considered in this paper. 
 
Figure 4. RSSI on the urban route 1. 
 
The ITU-1225 model is adequate to predict the 
propagation loss for long distances on some routes. For 
short distances, the most accurate model is Cost-231 Hata. 
Also, when we grouped all measurements of all routes 
(Figure 7), the Cost-231 Hata model has the best 
performance. 
Figure 5. RSSI on the urban route 2.  
 
In the route taken on the highway, the protocols behavior 
is different, and there is a sharp drop in the collection of 
samples after the distance of 2000m. As the average speed of 
travel of the device on this route is from 60 to 80 km/h, it is 
proved that the performance of NB-IoT in scenarios with 
mobility for medium to high speed is not efficient, which can 
impact the use of this protocol in mobile applications.

Figure 7. RSSI grouping all samples of all urban routes. 
 
One key performance metrics used in evaluations is The 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures the average of 
all absolute errors between the measured values and the 
calculated results from the propagation models. 
The performance of each propagation model is presented 
in Table 4.

According to the results, the Cost-231 Hata model has 
the lowest absolute mean error, confirming that this is the 
model that most closely matches the actual measured values. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, the NB-IoT protocol coverage was 
analyzed through real field measurements on four different 
routes in the city of Santa Rita do Sapucaí-MG, Brazil.  
The measured results were compared with three 
propagation models used in mobile communication 
scenarios: Cost-231 Hata, ITU-R 1225, and Erceg-
Greenstein.  
The results presented by the Erceg-Greenstein model are 
not accurate for all considered routes. The ITU-R 1225 
model has good performance for long distances on some 
routes. The best results are presented by the Cost-231 Hata 
model, which is confirmed using the MAE metric. 
The protocol behaves differently on the route taken on 
the highway, and a stable communication link could not be 
established. Thus, the performance of NB-IoT for 
environments with medium to high speeds is not efficient. 
The future works include analyses made with other 
protocols with characteristics similar to NB-IoT, such as 
LoRa, in the same scenarios and conditions, to compare the 
performance between both technologies.
