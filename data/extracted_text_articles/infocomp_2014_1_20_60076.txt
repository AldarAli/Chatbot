Abstract— The problem on non-homogeneous shear flows 
over the rough terrain is considered semi-analytically. 
Mathematical modelling of these flows is interesting due to 
important applications in meteorology and oceanography. 
Known results presumably refer to the wave phenomena 
appearing in the flows over single bell-shaped obstacle. 
Presently, most intrinsic problem is to describe a complicated 
interference patterns which can be forced by multiple-ridged 
topography. In this paper, a non-linear model of a stratified 
flow over combined obstacle is constructed under the small 
amplitude assumption for the topography. Attention is focused 
on the stationary wave patterns formed directly above the hill 
range. Wave solutions corresponding to the topography with a 
finite number of peaks are calculated. These solutions predict 
rigorously the splitting of a near-field flow to the separate wave 
zones having different spatial scales.

 INTRODUCTION  
Modeling of stratified flows plays a significant role in 
several environmental disciplines, especially in meteorology 
and oceanography [1][2]. Internal waves in the non-
homogeneous 
atmosphere 
and 
ocean 
are 
generated 
frequently from the interaction of the mean flow with 
orographic obstacles, such as mountains and submarine 
ridges. Lee waves arise downstream of the obstacle under 
appropriate upwind conditions. These waves possess 
horizontal lengths amounting to tens of kilometers and 
typical magnitudes of vertical displacement are on the order 
of hundreds of meters. Therefore, they can present a hazard 
to air traffic and sub-sea operations.  
The theory of lee waves deals with the mathematical model 
of inviscid incompressible non-homogeneous fluid. Long’s 
model is based on the linear Helmholtz equation for a steady 
stream function which should satisfy appropriate boundary 
conditions and radiation condition at infinity (we refer to the 
paper [3] for a mathematical details of the Long’s theory). 
This linear partial differential equation arises as a 
leading-order approximation to more general non-linear 
Dubreil-Jacotin – Long equation of stratified fluid [4]. 
Despite the linearity, explicit analytic solutions are known 
only for the simplest topographies, such as a single semi-
circular obstacle [5][6]. Numerical solutions to Long’s 
theory also encounter substantial difficulties due to the 
specific form of a boundary condition for arbitrary 
topography [7][8]. 
We develop a semi-analytical approach [9] involving the 
von Mises transformation of both dependent and independent 
variables in the non-linear version of the Dubreil-Jacotin – 
Long equation. The main idea of this method is to satisfy the 
exact topography condition by solving approximate 
equations in an auxiliary rectangular domain. The impact of 
the non-linearity is analyzed by the perturbation procedure 
with a small parameter which characterizes typical height of 
an obstacle. Our attention is focused on the fragmentation 
effects for the near-field wave patterns forced by the rough 
topography of finite extension.  
This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes 
the mathematical setup, including the formulation of a basic 
model; Section III characterizes the perturbation procedure 
combined with the Fourier method to construct an analytical 
solution; Section IV illustrates preliminary results of 
numerical modelling of stratified flows. Discussion and 
conclusions are presented in Section V.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 
The mathematical model of a steady stratified 2-D flow 
over an uneven bottom is formulated as the boundary value 
problem for a second-order elliptic partial differential 
equation, i.e., DJL (Dubreil-Jacotin – Long) equation, which 
has the form

where g is the gravity acceleration, h  is the total depth of 
the stratified fluid layer, N  is the constant Brunt–Väisälä 
frequency (i.e., the buoyancy frequency of air or ocean 
water), and c is the speed of the far-upstream flow. Quantity 
  determines the slope of the density profile for a 
uniformly stratified fluid being at rest and λ indicates the 
value of the sub- or super-criticality of the upstream flow 
with respect to the phase speed of infinitesimal internal 
waves. Finally, the small parameter   characterizes a

From the mathematical point of view, problem (1) is a 
non-linear eigenvalue problem with spectral parameter  as 
the bifurcation parameter. A non-trivial wave solution can 
bifurcate from the wave-less regimes if the magnitude of 
topography   is sufficiently small. Bifurcation occurs by   
belonging to a continuous spectrum of linear waves (see 
Fig. 1).

Based on that, a non-trivial solution should have periodic 
asymptotics with respect to spatial variable x far-
downstream the obstacle. In that sense, problem (1) can be 
also considered as the non-linear diffraction problem. The 
main difficulty is that the amplitude of stationary wave 
forced behind the obstacle is unknown a priory.

ANALYTIC SOLUTION 
We apply a semi-analytical approach involving von 
Mises transformation of the DJL equation. Namely, we seek

 This transformation

However, such a geometric assumption allows to satisfy the

Certainly, this approximation corresponds to the

EXAMPLES OF CALCULATED WAVE PATTERNS  
Wolfram Mathematica® [10] was used at all stages of 
semi-analytic calculations. Symbolic computer algebra was 
applied to present truncated solution (2), which provides 
fast convergence. Most of the numerical simulations used 
the series for coefficients 
w0
and 
1
w with ten basic 
harmonics. Computational flow domain involved the 
discretization with 50 points in horizontal direction x and 
10 points in ψ. The calculation of a non-linear second-order 
solution used a numerical result for a leading-order linear 
solution presented by 6-order interpolation splines. Multiple 
series of calculations were carried out on the two node 
computer cluster at Novosibirsk State University.   
Figure 2 and Figure 3 demonstrate some examples of 
the calculated 1-mode lee wave patterns, which appear in 
the flow region over the finite number of obstacles. 
Parameters   and λ are taken as  =0.04 and λ=15 in all 
cases. The Boussinesq parameter σ is chosen as σ =0.2.  
 
 
Figure 2. Lee waves over two bell-shaped obstacles. 
 
Figure 2 illustrates the influence of the non-linearity on 
the stratified flow formed over the double bell-shaped 
topography. The non-linearity essentially corrects only the 
wave column immediately above the second obstacle but 
the downstream wave-tail still remains non-perturbed 
behind the obstacles.  
 
Figure 3. Separation of stratified flow. 
 
Figure 3 illustrates an interesting effect of the wave 
interference, which can be observed in the near-bottom 
region of the boundary-trapped waves over a multi-hill 
topography. The near-bottom flow is clearly separated from 
the upper region of slowly modulated waves having the 
maximum amplitude at the mid-height of the fluid layer. 
The separation between lower and upper wave zones occurs 
at the height predicted by the zero points of the hydrostatic 
mode. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
In this paper, we outline semi-analytic approach 
assigned to simulate atmospheric stratified flows over 
combined 2D topography. The method exploits calculation 
the Fourier series which present modal decomposition of the 
waves forced by localized multi-bumped obstacle. Such an 
analytic solution of fluid mechanics is constructed by the 
perturbation procedure taking into account the non-linearity 
of mathematical problem. As noted, the limitations can arise 
by modelling the flows with overturning streamlines above  
the sharp-crested terrain with high peaks. However, the 
method seems to be well-conditioned while it predicts 
realistically the fragmentation of wave patterns due to 
interference of lee waves from adjacent ridges. Preliminary 
results demonstrate the ability to provide fast computations 
of the flows even for irregular-shaped topography. From a 
geophysical viewpoint, an efficient method is also needed to 
provide accurate computation of the fronts of separated 
wave zones. This work is in progress now. Next technical 
steps will operate with obtained Fourier solutions in order to 
evaluate analytically the impact of modal decomposition on 
the 
fragmentation 
effect 
observed 
by 
numerical 
experiments. Furthermore, we also plan to extend this 
method to modelling of stratified air flows over topography 
in local regions being of interest from meteorological 
viewpoint. By that, important issue is to estimate the 
computation requirements which are asserted to the 
algorithm by such a real topography.
