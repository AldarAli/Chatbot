INTRODUCTION
Taiwan has one of the more advanced telecom networks
in the region of Asia Pacific. Since the privatization and
liberalization of Taiwan’s telecom markets in 2005, the
telecom
industry
faced
many
changes
of
competitive
environments and challenges of technological innovations.
Telecom companies need to find new ways to obtain
competitive advantages. According to the administrative plan
of
2013
proposed
by
the
National
Communications
Commission (NCC), enhancing the monitoring mechanism
of high-speed broadband network, and amending guidelines
for fixed-line network service quality are part of the telecom
supervision plan in Taiwan [1]. Chunghwa telecom (CHT)
company is the largest telecom operator in Taiwan, and no
one can compare with its rich talented personnel, facilities,
fund and network construction [2]. The CHT’s 2014
guidance also reported “Facing market saturation and
competition on broadband business, we will continue to
support growth through offering attractive convergence plans
and facilitating higher-speed migration. Lastly, we plan to
launch ground-breaking 300Mbps speed services, helping us
solidify our technological superiority and maintain our
market
leading
position.”
[3].
Therefore,
the
telecom
infrastructure plays an important role in CHT’s broadband
strategic management.
The telecommunications room (telecom room) gathers all
connectivity from customers or business, such as broadband
networks, data communications, and fixed line. Due to the
needs of customers and the market share, the telecom
infrastructure needed to provide more diversification of
services. The telecom rooms play an increasingly critical role
in
broadband
infrastructure,
among
these
all,
power
infrastructure is the heart of telecom resources. In terms of
management
and
operation,
CHT
has
some
inborn
inferiorities because it has been a monopoly for 40 years [2].
To make the best use of limited resources and efficient
resource allocation, CHT needs to develop more effective
management strategies for power infrastructure to meet
increasing demand for broadband network performance in
the business market.
With the advent of the Internet and the development in
the telecom industry, in selection of telecom alternatives for
the power system protection and control applications, greater
emphasis is usually placed on reliability than cost [4].
Additionally,
the
management
of
telecom
power
infrastructure based on knowledge discovery from domain
experts were however less discussed. Therefore, this study
developed a group strategic knowledge mining (GSKM)
model for telecom power infrastructure. The objectives of
this paper are to clearly elicit the criteria and evaluate the
strategic
values
of
the
alternatives.
Furthermore,
by
uncovering the clusters knowledge rules and generating the
decision tree, the decision makers’ knowledge will be mined.
The contributions of the proposed model may support the
planners and managers to develop more effective power
management strategies for telecom rooms. The existing
methodologies in the GSKM model include: (1) Eliciting
criteria for knowledge discovery by using the modified
Delphi method; (2) Evaluating the weights and alternatives
to get strategic values by using fuzzy MCDM method; (3)
Integrating the group experts’ opinions by using two fuzzy
aggregation method; (4) Clustering the telecom rooms for
mining the experts’ knowledge and advice appropriate
management strategies of power infrastructure.

BACKGROUND
A. Knowledge elicitation
The Delphi method is a set of procedures and methods
for formulating a group judgment toward a subject matter in
which precise information is lacking, and relies on soliciting
individual (often anonymous) answers to written questions
by survey or other type of communication [5]. A series of
iterations provide each individual with feedback on the
responses of the others in the group. The final responses are
24

IMMM 2014 : The Fourth International Conference on Advances in Information Mining and Management

evaluated for variance and means to determine which
questions the group has reached consensus about, either
affirmatively or negatively.
Murry and Hammons defined that the modified Delphi
method is a technique to arrive at a group consensus
regarding an issue under investigation [6]. It was used to rate
the indicators. This process consisted of one round of
anonymous ratings of the indicators by the panel, a face-to-
face panel discussion, and a second round of anonymous
ratings immediately after the panel discussions. It is a
structured approach to expert panel deliberations that does
not require consensus.
Iggland applied fuzzy Delphi method in coupling of
customer preferences and production cost information [7].
Ishikawa et al. implemented experts’ judgments with group
fuzzy integration based on fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) [8].
Applying fuzzy set theory to the Delphi group decision
method seems attractive as demonstrated by Cheng who
utilized fuzzy Delphi method to adjust the fuzzy rating of
each expert [9]. Therefore, the fuzzy modified Delphi
process was used to develop consensus in the proposed
model.
B. Getting the Fuzzy Weights for criteria
Because an evaluator always perceives the weight with
their own subjective evaluation, an extra or precise weight
for a specified criterion was not given. This led to the use of
the fuzzy weights of criteria. In decision analysis, pairwise
comparison of alternatives is widely used [10]. Usually,
decision
makers
express
their
pairwise
comparison
information
in
two
formats:
multiplicative
preference
relations and
fuzzy preference relations. The analytic
hierarchy process (AHP) with multiplicative preference
relations has been applied extensively in telecom fields
[11][12][13][14]. However, the decision makers may also
use fuzzy preference relations to express their preference due
to their different cultural and educational backgrounds,
personal habits, and the vague nature of human judgment.
There
are
some
common
research
issues
between
multiplicative preference relations and fuzzy preference
relations, as both are based on pairwise comparison.
Therefore, research progress in multiplicative preference
relations can benefit research in fuzzy preference relations
[15].
The fuzzy preference relations method provides some
advantages, including a consistency indicator, simplicity of
computation, high precision and preservation of ranks. The
method
constructs
the
decision
matrices
of
pairwise
comparisons using an additive transitivity. Only comparisons
are required to ensure consistency for a level with criteria.
The method is simply and practically provides ranking
choices in decision-making problems [15][16][17].
Current approaches for group decision-making analysis
support different preference formats, but their computational
procedures are very complicated. Usually, they consist of
three steps: (1) uniform the preference information given by
decision makers through a transformation function, (2)
aggregate the uniformed preference information into a
collective one by means of the aggregation operators, and (3)
rank alternatives or select the most desirable alternatives by
the selection methods [18].
The multi-granular linguistic methodology permits the
unification of the different linguistic domains to facilitate the
calculus of consensus degrees and proximity measures on the
basis of experts’ opinions. The consensus degrees assess the
agreement amongst all the experts’ opinions, while the
proximity measures are used to find out how far the
individual opinions are from the group opinion [17].
Therefore, this study assumed that there exist several experts
who may have different background and knowledge to solve
a particular problem and, therefore, different linguistic term
sets (multi-granular linguistic information) could be used to
express their opinions.
C. Aggregating linguistic labels into a group opinion
1)
FLOWA
(Fuzzy
Linguistic
Ordered
Weighted
Average): At present, many aggregation operators have
been developed to integrate information. The aggregation
function, ranking method, and consensus measure are the
main problems to be solved for a fuzzy group decision-
making issue. The existing main aggregation operators can
be briefly classified into the following three categories: (1)
One contribution of the methodology presented herein is
that the result of this aggregation approach is a collection of
linguistic labels with a calculated degree or membership
function, presenting a more informative aggregation. (2) A
two phase model developed by Herrera and Herrera-Viedma
[19]. (3) The operators, which can only be used in situations
where the arguments are exact numeric variables, such as
Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging (LOWA) operators
that is based on the OWA and the convex combination of
linguistic labels [20]. Ben and Chen proposed a new
linguistic-label aggregation operator incorporated fuzzy set
theory into LOWA that call the fuzzy-LOWA (FLOWA)
operator. FLOWA organized OWA and LOWA aggregation
algorithms and individual linguistic opinions into a group
opinion. These aggregation methods operate directly on the
linguistic labels and allow each expert to represent an
optimistic or pessimistic predilection [21].
2)
EFWA (Efficient Fuzzy Weighted Average): When
the environment is vague, the rating criteria and the weights
of their corresponding importance are often evaluated as a
fuzzy number. In order to obtain the weighted sum of those
criteria evaluated by fuzzy numbers in terms of rating and
importance, this study use the fuzzy weighted average for
the calculation. There has been some research involved in
the field of fuzzy weighted average [22][23][24]. Lee and
Park proposed an efficient algorithm, named the Efficient
Fuzzy Weighted Average (EFWA), to compute a fuzzy
weighted average, which was an improvement over the
previous methods by reducing the number of comparisons
and
arithmetical
operations
[22].
The
computational
algorithm of EFWA is based on the α-cut representation of 
fuzzy sets and interval analysis. The managerial meaning of
25

IMMM 2014 : The Fourth International Conference on Advances in Information Mining and Management

α-value can be explained as a confidence level [23]. 
Because of the above-mentioned advantages, this study will
adopt the EFWA algorithm to aggregate decision makers’
opinion.
III.
THE GROUP STRATEGIC KNOWLEDGE MINING MODEL
This section proposes the GSKM model. It includes three
phases, as shown in Figure 1. Phase I is the process of
criteria elicitation and weights assessment for telecom
knowledge discovery. Phase II is to evaluate and aggregate
the alternatives, namely telecom rooms, to get strategic
values and ranks. Phase III is the process of clustering the
telecom rooms and mining the decision tree for the power
infrastructure.
Figure 1.
The GSKM model.
A. Phase I. Criteria Elicitation and Weights Assessment
To identify the important criteria for the operation
strategies in power infrastructure of telecom rooms, the
fuzzy modified Delphi method is used to elicit implicit
knowledge of decision makers and assess criteria for
deciding weights. The decision makers are invited to take
part in a series of rounds to identify, clarify until reaching
consensus on this issue.
This process consisted of the first round of anonymous
ratings of the indicators and a face-to-face discussion, and
then generated an impact assessment form for power
infrastructure of telecom rooms. The decision makers
investigated that MCDM problem with preference relations
could assess the relative importance weights of criteria.
Moreover, human thoughts are uncertain, fuzzy theory could
be used to express their preference relations in linguistic
terms. To integrate the decision makers’ opinions, the
FLOWA method was used to aggregate all criteria. This way,
the decision makers’ valuable domain knowledge can be
acquired and shared in an effective and efficient manner. In
the following rounds, a series of discussion are provided
feedback to the decision makers, the appropriate thresholds
are also restricted to achieve the goals by cognitive
subjective view until consensus is reached. Finally, criteria
and weights are decided in this phase.
B. Phase II. Alternatives Evaluation and Aggregation
To evaluate the alternatives with respect to criteria, the
MCDM method consists of two steps: (1) collecting the
individual confidence level, define the linguistic terms and
corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers, and (2) aggregating
all decision makers’ opinions and integrating the scores of
weighing the criteria for each alternative.
The first step should utilize fuzzy set theory to deal with
the uncertain problem of linguistics, and the linguistic terms
are replaced by suitable triangular fuzzy numbers that are
used for arithmetical operations. Each decision maker
defined their different confidence levels and corresponding
triangular fuzzy numbers in terms of VH (very high), H
(high), M (medium), L (low), VL (very low) to score the
importance of alternatives that collected with respect to the
criteria
elicited.
When
the
scores
finished
assessing
completely, the strategic values will be obtained, and then a
decision matrix is established for the decision makers.
In the second step, in order to obtain the weighted sum of
those criteria evaluated by fuzzy numbers in terms of rating
and importance, we used EFWA method to aggregate the
weighted scores that are from individual decision-makers to
become the group results. Therefore, the alternatives can be
ranked according to the group scores.
C. Phase III. Decision Tree Mining
This phase included defuzzification and data analysis. By
clustering for discovering the knowledge rules and feedback
to the decision makers, two algorithms are employed. One is
center of gravity for defuzzifing and ranking the alternatives,
and another one is V-optimal for uncovering the clusters
knowledge rules and generating the decision tree. Therefore,
the results may help decision makers to more effectively
manage the telecom power infrastructure, and thus obtain
competitive advantages.
IV.
A CASE ILLUSTRATION
In order to illustrate the practicability and usefulness of
the proposed model, we implemented it in the power
infrastructure of telecom rooms for the largest telecom
company in Taiwan. We convened three decision makers
who are the most knowledgeable in power technologies and
services. The processes of evaluating the strategies can be
expressed as follows.

A. Identification of selecting criteria and deciding weights
In the first phase, the fuzzy modified Delphi method was
applied to reach consensus on the importance of each of the
identified criteria for evaluating operation strategies toward
the power infrastructure of telecom rooms. During the first
round, the decision makers were provided the fault research,
cause analysis, accident causation and process and the choice
of UPS of the telecom rooms’ electric power system to
understand
practical
implementation,
planning
and
management. Based on the decision makers’ deep domain
knowledge about the related geographical information,
facilities, personnel allocation and future investment plan of
the telecom rooms, they were elicited the criteria and
suggested
criteria
through
brainstorm
technique.
After
discussing in the first round, this study analyzed the priority
ranking of criteria is as follows: staffing＞room features＞
initial load＞power supply＞growth forecast＞maintaining
support, and included 266 telecom rooms in Southern
Taiwan.
The decision makers used fuzzy preference relations to
assign the strategic values for criteria. The value represents
the important degree of the preference for the first criteria
with respect to the second one. The decision matrix, which is
based on Saaty's 9 point scale, is constructed. Therefore, the
decision makers used the fundamental 1–9 scale defined by
Saaty to assess the priority score [21]. To combine the scores
of fuzzy preference relation that each decision maker
assessed, the FLOWA method is applied to get final weights
of each criterion. Herein, the matrix and the weight factors of
6 evaluation criteria for group opinions are shown in Table I.

In Table I, the criteria “maintaining support” was
“extreme unimportance” and ranked last. In the next round,
the decision makers decided to give up it for satisfying the
threshold condition, and then regenerated the matrix of five
evaluation criteria. According to Table II, the weight set on
C1: staffing, C2: room features, C3: initial load, C4: power
supply, and C5: growth forecast respectively were 0.3, 0.26,
0.29, 0.16 and 0.1.
B. Assessment of telecom rooms
In phase II, the three decision makers, who have the basic
knowledge about fuzzy theory are then introduced to the
basic concepts of common linguistic term set (LTS) by the
facilitator. After a brief introduction, the decision makers
defined their linguistic terms and corresponding triangular
fuzzy numbers according to their subjective judgments
within a scale of 0-10. The LTS {VH, H, M, L, VL}
indicates very high, high, medium, low, and very low,
respectively. See Table III.

Each decision maker used their linguistic terms to
evaluate the 266 telecom rooms with room features, staffing,
initial load, growth forecast and power supply on power
infrastructure of telecom rooms for the importance of
operation strategies. To aggregate the evaluation results from
the three decision makers, the EFWA method was used to
calculate the weighted scores of the criteria. Through
repeating the computational procedure of EFWA, the
interval for α = 0, in which each point is corresponding to
the end points of the triangle representing the membership
function.
The
process
is
repeated
for

which
corresponds to the center of the triangle. Consequently, with
the intervals for α = 0 and α = 1, the aggregation results of
EFWA for partial telecom rooms are shown in Table IV.

C. Generating and exploring classification rules
The aggregation matrix, which is a linguistic term,
should be transferred to non-fuzzy values; herein the Center

corresponding membership degrees. According to the BNP

value, 266 telecom rooms will be ranked. After determining
the ranked result, the V-optimal histogram, which is suitable
for clustering ordinary data, and based on the concept of
minimizing the quantity of the weighted variance, clustered
the telecom rooms into five groups. The numbers of each
type of telecom room for class A, B, C, D, and E are 31, 68,
72, 32, and 63, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
The privatization, liberalization and competition of
telecom markets have created a really strong competition. In
the new era of the digital economy, telecom resources lack
effective management [25][26]. Many telecom companies
and DGT pay more attention to the problem. If organizations
can achieve performance of implementation of strategy,
invest in telecom equipment accurately, and reduce operating
costs, they will make optimal use of company resources.
According to the classes of the telecom rooms (Table VI),
CHT can apply the management modes to the planning
stages of engineering works, particularly the initial stages or
re-planning of power equipment to advance the effective use
and resource development and utilization.

power infrastructure strategies. It will enhance readability
and simplify the decision-making task for the differences
between management modes and types of power system in
each telecom room.
There are generally two main objectives in constructing
GSKM model. The first objective concerns the improvement
of the quality of the decisions taken. During the planning
stages of engineering works, particularly the initial stages or
re-planning
of
power
equipment,
power
maintenance
strategies can be integrated into the design-lifecycle to
advance the effective use and resource development and
utilization. The second objective of a formalized decision
study is to supply technical documentation in support of
decisions both in front of authorities and of public opinion.
Theoretically, most of scholars and experts studied the
electric power transmission system, discussed how to solve
the power distribution system, and trending econometric
analysis. Because of different nature of each telecom room,
this study may not be applied to plan telecom power
infrastructure. Finally, the model will apply to other domain
and compare with other group model in future work.
