Abstract—  Many 
environmental  sites  are  becoming 
contaminated  by  mixed  wastes,  including  such  organic 
compounds  as  BTEX  (benzene,  toluene,  ethylbenzene,  and 
three isomers of xylene), TPH (total petroleum hydrocarbons), 
and  CAHs  (chlorinated  aliphatic  hydrocarbons)  including 
TCE (trichloroethylene). TCE, as a representative CAH, has 
been widely used in various industrial processes and is among 
the most prevalent hazardous organic compounds present in 
the  environment.  In  this  study,  a  microbial  pure  culture 
enriched and isolated from a heavily oil-contaminated site in 
Xiamen, China, was used to remove mixtures of BTEX, TPH, 
and TCE under different pHs (5, 7, and 9) at 25°C, from the 
artificially contaminated water and to assess the interactions 
between  those  compounds  during  their  bio-removal. The 
mixtures of BTEX (BTEoX, BTEmX, and BTEpX) and TPH 
showed different trends when TCE added to the mixture. TCE 
showed  an  inhibitory  effect  on  bio-removal  of  o-xylene  in 
BTEoX mixture, while it showed a stimulatory effect on the 
overall removal efficiencies for BTEmX and BTEpX mixtures. 
On the other hand, TCE was the most efficiently removed 
when mixed with BTEoX and TPH, except at pH 5, while less 
removed  in  other  mixtures  at  almost  similar  amounts, 
regardless of pH. The highest removal  of BTEX and TPH 
occurred at pH 7 or 9, while the highest removal of TCE 
occurred at pH 7, regardless of mixtures.

I.INTRODUCTION
Due to the industrialization, petroleum production is not 
only the primary source of fuel but also the contamination 
source of soil and groundwater [1]. Besides of basic usage of 
these productions, lots of them are lost by leakage. Major 
causes of crude oil-contaminated soil include leaking storage 
tanks and pipelines, land disposal of petroleum waste, and 
accidental  or  intentional  spills  [2].  There  are  many 
compounds in petroleum. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, 
and  three  isomers  (ortho-,  meta-,  and  para-)  of  xylene, 
collectively known as BTEX, are among these compounds, 
which are also widely used as industrial solvents for organic 
synthesis  and  equipment  cleansing  [3].  Trichloroethylene 
(TCE) is widely used in various industrial processes, such as 
industrial  dry  cleaning,  textile  manufacturing,  etc.  It  is 
among the most prevalent  hazardous  organic  compounds 
present in the environment [4]. TCE is also carcinogenic and 
would cause other serious health effects on humans [5]. 
There have been lots of studies focused on removing 
these  contaminants.  Among  all  the  current  technologies, 
biological treatment is regarded as the most economical and 
environmentally  sound  approach  [6].  However,  no 
microorganism capable of growing on TCE as a sole carbon 
or energy source has yet been isolated [7]. Instead, several 
anaerobic and aerobic bacteria are known to degrade TCE by 
the  co-metabolic  transformation.  Hence,  a  non-growth-
supporting substrate is transformed through the catalysis of 
non-specific enzymes synthesized by bacteria in the presence 
of a growth substrate [8]. 
Many studies have proved that TCE has an inhibitory 
effect to other compounds during the bio-removal process. 
TCE significantly inhibited phenol degradation during the 
degradation  of  phenol  and  trichloroethylene  by 
Pseudomonas  cepacia G4  [9].  TCE  was  regarded  an 
inhibitor to 1,1-dichloroethylene bio-removal [10] and also 
showed an inhibitory effect to isopropyl alcohol [11]. On the 
other hand, the efficacy of TCE biodegradation varies with 
different  compounds  under  different  conditions.  The 
combination of BTEX, TPH, and TCE can be frequently 
found in the environment.
 The efficacy of biodegradation is also influenced by a 
number  of  factors  including  bioavailability,  quality  and 
quantity  of  contaminants,  temperature,  pH,  and  oxygen. 
These  factors  are  essential  for  formulating  successful 
bioremediation strategies [8]. In this study, one indigenous 
microorganism isolated from a heavily oil-contaminated site 
in Xiamen, China was used to remove mixtures of BTEo/m/
pX (350 mg/L), TPH  (1,000 mg/L), and TCE(15 mg/L) 
under three different pH values (5, 7, and 9) at 25°C, from 
the  synthetic  contaminated  water.  Indigenous 
microorganisms were first enriched and isolated from the 
contaminated soil. The interaction between BTEX, TPH, and 
TCE  during  their  bio-removal  from  the  artificially 
contaminated  water  under  different  pH conditions  was 
evaluated. Results would help find out the interactions and 
the  most  appropriate  combination  of  contaminants and 
environmental  conditions  when  the  bioremediation 
technology applied to the mixed wastes contaminated sites.

II.MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Chemicals
Benzene  (purity,  99.7%),  toluene  (purity,  99%), 
ethylbenzene  (purity,  99%),  ortho-xylene  (purity,  99%), 
meta-xylene (purity, 99%), and  para-xylene (purity, 99%) 
were purchased from the International Laboratory (USA). 
TCE (purity, 99%) was purchased from Da Mao Chemical 
Manufacture in Tianjin, China. TPH were purchased from 
the  Caltex  Company  in  Macau  Special  Administrative 
Region  (SAR),  China,  and  the  TPH  stock  solution  was 
prepared using the 1:1 ratio (v/v) of unleaded gasoline and 
diesel mixed with dimethylformamide (DMF). 
B. Soil sample collection
Indigenous microorganisms were isolated from the soil 
samples,  potentially  contaminated  with  petroleum 
compounds and obtained from a site near a gas station in 
Xiamen, China. Soil samples were stored in a freezer until 
use.
C. Enrichment and isolation
The microbial pure cultures were enriched and isolated 
from the soil sample. Soil sample (5%, w/w)  was first added 
into the nutrient broth (contained 3.0 g/L beef extract and 5.0 
g/L peptone) in a serum bottle, and then 150 mg/L of toluene 
was added as a substrate for the microbial growth. After the 
serum bottles were covered with stoppers (90% teflon/10% 
silicone) and aluminum crimp sealed, they were inverted and 
placed on an orbital shaker (IKA) at 150 rpm and 25°C. 
Then, 10% (v/v) inocula from these bottles were aseptically 
inoculated into the mineral salts medium (MSM contained 
KH2PO4 1.0  g/L;  K2HPO4 1.0  g/L;  NH4NO3 1.0  g/L; 
MgSO4·7H2O 0.2 g/L; Fe2(SO4)3 0.5 g/L; and CaCO3 0.02 g/
L) containing 150 mg/L of toluene as a sole substrate. After 
several weeks of subculturing, pure cultures were isolated 
from the bottles by using nutrient agar (NA) plates. The pH 
of medium was adjusted by adding HNO3  (1.0 mol/L) or 
NaOH (1.0 mol/L) solution. All the apparatus and media 
were autoclaved (HIRAYAMA) for 20 min at 121°C, under 
15 psi (103.5 kPa) in advance.
Several microbial colonies with different morphologies 
were chosen from the NA plates and aseptically transferred 
to test tubes containing MSM with 150 mg/L of toluene. 
After the tubes were incubated on the shaker at 150 rpm and 
25°C, one microbial pure culture from the soil sample, which 
showed higher turbidities by measuring optical density (OD) 
at 600 nm  and  higher  toluene removal  efficiencies,  was 
chosen for further experiments. The selected pure culture 
was further transferred, 10% (v/v), into the newly prepared 
MSM containing mixtures of BTEX and TPH.
D. Analytical methods 
The  concentrations  of  BTEX,  TPH,  and  TCE  were 
measured  using  a  gas  chromatograph  (Agilent,  6890N, 
Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd, China) equipped with a flame 
ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (HP-5; 30 
m × 0.53 μm I.D. with a stationary-phase film thickness of 
0.88 μm). One microliter of liquid samples was injected by 
the autosampler injector (7638 Series, Agilent Technologies 
Co.,  Ltd,  China)  equipped  with  a  tapered  microsyringe 
(5181-1267, Hamilton Company, USA). Nitrogen was used 
as a carrier gas. The inlet and detector temperatures were 
280°C and 300°C, respectively. The column temperature was 
programmed as initial temperature, 40°C (hold for 2 min), 
then incrementally increased at 12°C/min to 300°C (hold for 
10 min). 
E. Bio-removal of mixtures
After several weeks of subculturing, the pure cultures 
(10%, v/v) were added into the fresh MSM which contained 
different concentrations of BTEo/m/pX/TPH/TCE mixtures 
at different pH values (5, 7, and 9) at 25°C. 
After the serum bottles were sealed with stoppers and 
aluminum  crimps,  they  were  inverted  to  minimize  the 
volatilization of these compounds, then incubated on the 
shaker  at  150  rpm.  Bottles  containing  MSM  with  these 
compounds but without microorganisms served as controls. 
Sample aliquots of 2 mL were periodically withdrawn from 
the bottles and analyzed for the concentrations of BTEX, 
TPH, and TCE.  
III.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The experimental  results  for the  interactions  between 
BTEX (350 mg/L for BTEo/m/pX), TPH (1,000 mg/L), and 
TCE  (15 mg/L) in the artificially contaminated water  at 
different pH values at 25°C are shown below.
A. Removal of BTEoX and TPH
The  removal  efficiencies  for  benzene,  toluene, 
ethylbenzene,  ortho-xylene,  and  TPH  in  BTEoX/TPH 
mixture without and with TCE after 144 hours of incubation 
are shown in Figure 1 and 2, respectively. For the mixture 
without  TCE,  the  highest  total  removal  efficiencies  for 
BTEoX mixture and TPH were 84.7% at pH 7 and 63.7% at 
pH 9, respectively, and the lowest total removal efficiencies 
were 29.1% at pH 5 and 34.5% at pH 5, respectively (data 
not shown). On the other hand, for the mixture with TCE, 
the highest  removal efficiencies  for BTEoX mixture and 
TPH were 74.5% at pH 9 and 61.5% at pH 7, respectively, 
and the lowest total removal efficiencies were 28.9% at pH 
5 and 35.8% at pH 5, respectively (data not shown). These 
results  suggested  the  inhibitory  effect  of  TCE  on  the 
removal  of  BTEoX  mixture  and  TPH.  The  removal 
efficiency for  o-xylene in BTEoX/TPH mixture was most 
affected  by  the  presence  of  TCE,  regardless  of 
environmental conditions. After TCE was added into the 
mixture of BTEoX (350 mg/L) and TPH (1,000 mg/L) at 
25°C, the removal efficiency for o-xylene dropped rapidly 
from 17.6% to 9.9%, from 82.3% to 13.8%, from 83.2% to 
10.3% at pH 5, 7, and 9, respectively. 
B. Removal of BTEmX and TPH

ethylbenzene,  meta-xylene,  and  TPH  in  BTEmX/TPH 
mixture without and with TCE after 144 hours of incubation 
are shown in Figure 3 and 4, respectively. For the mixture 
of BTEmX and TPH without TCE, the highest  removal 
efficiencies for BTEmX mixture and TPH were 82.4% at pH 
7 and 70.4% at pH 7, respectively, while the lowest removal 
efficiencies  were  39.2%  at  pH  5  and  36.7%  at  pH  5, 
respectively (data not shown). On the other hand, for the 
mixture  with  TCE, the  highest  removal  efficiencies  for 
BTEmX mixture and TPH were 85.5% at pH 9 and 64.0% at 
pH 7, respectively,  while the lowest removal efficiencies 
were 49.4% at pH 5 and 28.1% at pH 5, respectively (data 
not  shown).  Overall,  these  results  indicated  a  slightly 
stimulatory effect of TCE towards the removal of BTEmX 
mixture. However, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, the removal 
efficiencies for individual compound in BTEmX mixture and 
TPH were not significantly affected by the presence of TCE, 
regardless of pH. 
C. Removal of BTEpX and TPH
The  removal  efficiencies 
for 
benzene,  toluene, 
ethylbenzene,  para-xylene, and TPH in mixture of BTEpX 
and  TPH  without  and  with  TCE  after  144  hours  of 
incubation are shown in Figure 5 and 6, respectively. For the 
mixture without TCE,  the highest removal efficiencies for 
BTEpX mixture and TPH were 82.6% at pH 9 and 60.7% at 
pH 7, respectively,  while the lowest removal efficiencies 
42.0% at pH 5 and 30.5% at pH 5, respectively (data not 
shown). On the other hand, for the mixture with TCE, the 
highest removal efficiencies for BTEpX mixture and  TPH 
were 85.0% at pH 9 and 61.9% at pH 9, respectively, while 
the lowest removal efficiencies were 49.0% at pH 5 and 
26.1% at pH 5, respectively (data not shown). As for the 
BTEmX/TPH mixture, TCE showed a slightly stimulatory 
effect on the removal of BTEpX mixture and TPH. The 
removal  efficiencies  for  BTEpX  mixture  with  TCE 
compared to without TCE were 49.0% vs. 42.0% at pH 5, 
85.5% vs. 82.6% at pH 9, while there was about 0.5% 
difference at pH 7. As shown, the removal efficiency for 
TPH in the mixture was most significantly stimulated by the 
presence of TCE at pH 9.
D. Removal of TCE
Table 1 shows the removal efficiencies for TCE (15 mg/
L) at different pH values at 25°C when mixed with BTEoX 
(350 mg/L)/TPH (1,000 mg/L), BTEmX (350 mg/L)/TPH 
(1,000 mg/L),  or  BTEpX (350 mg/L)/TPH (1,000 mg/L) 
mixtures. TCE  was  the  most  efficiently  removed  when 
mixed  with  BTEoX and TPH at  pH 7 or 9, while less 
removed  in  other  mixtures  at  almost  similar  amounts 
regardless of pH. The highest removal of TCE occurred at 
pH  7,  regardless  of  mixtures.  The  amounts  of  chloride 
generated from the co-metabolism/mineralization of TCE at 
each pH are stoichiometrically equivalent to the bio-removal 
efficiencies  except  when  mixed  with  the  BTEmX/TPH 
mixture at pH 7 and 9.
IV.CONCLUSION
This study evaluated those interactions among the most 
frequently  found  organic  environmental  contaminants 
(BTEX, TPH, and TCE) when they existed in mixtures at 
different pH values at 25°C. The highest removal efficiencies 
for the mixtures of BTEX and TPH were at pH 7 or 9, while 
the lowest were at pH 5, regardless of the presence of TCE, 
implying the isolate (indigenous microorganism) preferring 
neutral  or slightly  alkaline condition.  When  the removal 
efficiencies for BTEoX, BTEmX, or BTEpX mixed with 
TPH were compared with or without TCE, TCE showed an 
inhibitory effect on the o-xylene removal in BTEoX mixture, 
while it showed a slightly stimulatory effect on the overall 
removal efficiencies for BTEmX and BTEpX mixtures. On 
the other hand, TCE was the most efficiently removed when 
mixed  with  BTEoX and TPH at  pH 7  or 9, while less 
removed in other mixtures regardless of pH, and the highest 
TCE removal occurred at pH 7 regardless of mixtures. Even 
though this study warrants more works, such as effects of 
different  temperatures  and  dissolved  oxygen  levels  and 
contaminants  concentrations,  to  further  evaluate  the 
contaminants’  interactions  in  mixtures,  these  preliminary 
results  would  still  help  improve  the  applicability  of 
bioremediation technology to the mixed wastes contaminated 
sites.
