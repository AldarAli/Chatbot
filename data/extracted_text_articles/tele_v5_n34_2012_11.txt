Abstract—This paper addresses the design of a class of anti-
collision algorithms for passive RFID (radio frequency iden-
tiﬁcation) systems, where tags are allowed to cooperate by
relaying (if necessary) the signals of other tags towards the
destination. All the relayed signals are combined at the reader
side so as to improve tag detection probabilities. The work
is focused on asymmetrical scenarios where tags and readers
experience different channel statistics. The objective is to include
tag cooperation in RFID anti-collision algorithms. To achieve
this goal, a framework for medium-access-control and physical
(MAC/PHY) cross-layer design of cooperative RFID anti-collision
algorithms is here presented. A tag activity model is also proposed
where different tag states are initially selected according to the
tag activation SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio). Tags
activated by high SINR values enter into states with relaying
capabilities, whereas those with low SINR values act as simple
sources of information (non-relaying state). Tags can change
state depending on the number of (re)transmissions performed.
A Markov model is used to calculate the system steady-state
probabilities. Instability is evaluated by the number of tags in
the backlog state, while fairness is evaluated by means of the Gini
index. Results show that tag cooperation is useful in networks
where tags with good channel states and low trafﬁc requests
cooperate with tags with bad channel states and low trafﬁc
requests.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. RFID technology and previous works
RFID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation) has been identiﬁed as
a good candidate for enabling the concept of the Internet-of-
Things (IoT). The main idea behind the concept of the IoT is to
ﬁnally bridge the gap between the virtual world of computers
and the physical world of objects. In RFID, a reader or
interrogator requests information (via radio frequency signals)
to low-cost tags or transponders [1]. These tags, which are in
charge of responding to reader’s requests, can be attached to
objects, animals or humans, and in some cases they can sense
environmental parameters such as temperature, position and
speed [2]. In passive RFID, where tags reuse the energy radi-
ated by readers, the limited coordination capabilities between
the network elements leads to the problem of signal collisions.
Therefore, an efﬁcient medium access control (MAC) layer is
crucial to the correct operation of RFID [3].
Two types of collision can be identiﬁed at the MAC layer of
RFID: tag and reader collision. A tag collision occurs when
two or more tags simultaneously respond to the same request.
Anti-collision schemes such as ALOHA and binary tree al-
gorithms are commonly employed to resolve tag collisions
[3]. Tag estimation methodologies [4], and modiﬁed frame
structures [3] have been proposed to improve the performance
of these anti-collision algorithms. Two types of reader collision
can be also identiﬁed: multiple-reader-to-tag and reader-to-
reader [5]. Two types of reader anti-collision algorithms can
be distinguished: those based on scheduling and those based
on coverage control. Typical scheduling schemes have been
subject to standardization: e.g., frequency division multiple
access (FDMA) in [6], and listen-before-talk (LBT) in [7].
More advanced schemes such as Colorwave [8] and Pulse
[9] implement inter-reader control mechanisms to assist in
collision avoidance. These schemes have paved the way for
self-organizing RFID anti-collision algorithms. Other solutions
such as HiQ [10] employ an analysis of collision patterns to
improve reader scheduling and thus reduce collision events in
subsequent time slots. In coverage-based algorithms, we can
ﬁnd schemes that reduce the overlapping coverage area be-
tween readers (e.g., [11]), and those that monitor interference
to adapt power levels accordingly (e.g., [12]).
B. Open issues and objectives
Despite these recent advances in RFID MAC layer design,
several issues remain open today. In particular, the last few
years have seen the proliferation of advanced signal processing
tools for conventional wireless networks (see [13] and [14])
that have not been fully explored in RFID. It is expected that
these algorithms will improve the performance of RFID just as
they improve conventional systems [15]. However, in order to
support a new physical (PHY) layer, an appropriate MAC layer
design is also required. This opens a wide range of MAC/PHY
cross-layer design issues for RFID.
One of the potential new PHY layer schemes for RFID is
known as cooperative diversity (CD). CD has been shown to
improve capacity, coverage, fairness and power consumption
of conventional wireless networks [20]. In networks with CD,
terminals are allowed to relay the packets of other terminals.
The network of relays mimics a macroscopic multiple antenna
system with high diversity gains. CD in RFID has been
explored only at the reader level in [17]. However, tag cooper-
ation, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed yet.
The main reason for this is the limited processing capabilities
of passive tags, which would avoid, in principle, the use of
tag-to-tag communication. However, recent developments in

[16] have shown that such tag-to-tag communication can also
be achieved in passive RFID.
The objective of this paper is to include tag cooperation in
the design of RFID anti-collision algorithms. In this paper it
is assumed that passive tag-to-tag communication is feasible.
Therefore, our focus is on the study of the consequences of
cooperation at the MAC layer rather than on the demonstration
of the feasibility of such tag cooperation. Recent results in
[16], however, suggest that the tag PHY cooperative layer
modeled in this work is feasible or is closed to be enabled
by technology developments. To achieve an appropriate anal-
ysis of tag cooperative schemes, a new design paradigm,
commonly known as MAC/PHY cross-layer design, is also
required. MAC/PHY cross-layer design plays a crucial role
in the design of conventional systems with CD. For example,
the work in [18] uses CD not only to improve PHY layer
performance, but also to resolve collisions at the MAC layer.
Throughput and stability analysis of ALOHA with CD has
been presented in [19]. A uniﬁed framework for cross-layer
design in CD networks has been described in [20], and a two-
transmitter two-receiver cooperative cross-layer algorithm has
been proposed in [21], among several other solutions in the
literature.
C. Paper contributions
This paper proposes an extension of the framework for
MAC/PHY cross-layer design of RFID systems previously
presented in [1] to cope with tag cooperation capabilities.
The framework includes a tag reception model suitable for
MAC/PHY cooperative cross-layer design, where relaying re-
transmissions are requested only when the tag is not correctly
detected by the destination. Reception probabilities calculated
in closed-form in [22] for the particular case of Rayleigh
channels are also used in this work. In addition, tag activity
is modeled with different tag states that initially depend on
the tag activation SINR: tags activated by a relatively high
SINR are driven into a state where they are able to relay
the signals of other tags in the network. By contrast, tags
activated by the minimum SINR are considered to enter
a state where they have no relaying capabilities, thereby
acting as simple sources of information. The states of the all
network, i.e. the collection of tags in their different states,
are mapped into a one-dimensional Markov model that can
be solved by conventional eigenvalue analysis. The solution
provides the steady-state probabilities of the network, which
are then used to calculate different metrics of the system,
such as throughput, average number of activated tags in the
backlog state, backlog delay, and fairness (by means of the
Gini index). Numerical results show interesting properties of
cooperative diversity in RFID networks. The modeling tools
proposed in this paper, which assume an asymmetrical network
deployment, and which include in the same design both reader
and tag anti-collision cooperative components, also represent a
novel contribution and a more realistic modeling approach of
complex RFID networks. Therefore, the analytical framework
developed here is envisioned for future RFID systems with
large numbers of tags and readers where interference becomes
a relevant issue in MAC layer design.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND CROSS-LAYER FRAMEWORK
A. Scenario description and protocol operation
Consider the slotted RFID network depicted in Fig. 1 with
a set of K readers denoted by R = {1, . . . K}, and a set of
J tags denoted by T = {1, . . . , J}. Tags are allowed to relay,
if requested, the signals of other tags towards the readers of
the network. At the reader side, all the copies of the relayed
signal of a given tag are combined (using a maximum ratio
combiner -MRC-) so as to achieve high diversity gains. In
this paper it is assumed that readers have enough complexity
for MRC processing. However, all expressions also apply for
systems without MRC. The relaying protocol used in the tags
will be decode-and-forward (DF). Four main processes can be
identiﬁed in the cooperative RFID network in Fig. 1:
• Tag activation by the transmission of readers, also called
the down-link transmission,
• Backscattering response by previously activated tags, also
called up-link transmission,
• Tag detection by neighbor tags or tag-to-tag communica-
tion, and
• Relaying of signals by cooperative tags and the signal
combining at the reader side.

Multi-tag and Multi-reader deployment scenario with cooperation
between tags.
In the down-link, the transmit power of reader k will be
denoted by Pr,k, while its probability of transmission will be
denoted by pr,k. The subset of active readers at any given time
will be denoted by Rt. Tags are activated whenever the SINR
received from a reader is above an activation threshold eγ(0)
j .
A tag will be assumed to be in D possible different states
according to the SINR level that was used to activate it. For
example, if the SINR is above the minimum SINR threshold
for activation eγ(0)
j
and below a second SINR threshold eγ(1)
j ,
where eγ(1)
j
> eγ(0)
j , then the tag will only act as a source of
information. On the contrary, if the SINR that activates a tag
is above eγ(d)
j
and below eγ(d+1)
j
, with d > 1, then the tag is
allowed to retransmit either its own signal or that of another tag
up to d times. The set of active tags in state d will be denoted
here by T (d)
P
, where T (d)
P
⊆ T and d ∈ {1, . . . , D}. These
active tags proceed to transmit a backscatter signal to the read-
ers using a randomized transmission scheme. The set of tags
that have been activated, regardless of their available energy
status, is simply denoted by TP , where TP = SD
d=1 T (d)
P
.The
subset of tags that transmit a backscatter signal once they have
been activated will be given by Tt, where Tt ⊆ TP ⊆ T and
where each tag j ∈ Tt will transmit with a power level denoted
by Pt,j. Whenever a tag is not correctly detected, the system
proceeds to request the immediate retransmission either from
the original tag or from another tag that has correctly decoded
the original transmission and that has enough energy to relay
a copy towards the reader(s). The cooperative retransmission
probability of tag j is denoted by pret,j, while the set of tags
that have relayed a signal of tag j in time slot n is denoted by
Tc,j(n). The maximum number of requested retransmissions is
denoted by R. Since in cooperative protocols with half duplex
constraints a packet transmission can take a random number of
time-slots, the length of a cooperative phase or epoch-slot will
denoted here by the random variable lep, where 0 ≤ lep ≤ R.
Finally, the set of tags correctly detected by reader k will be
denoted by TD,k.
B. Tag activation: Down-link model
Let us consider that the channel between reader k and tag j
is given by hk,j, while the channel between reader k and reader
m is given by gk,m, and the channel between tag i and tag j is
given by ui,j. Therefore, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) experienced by tag j due to a transmission of
reader k, which is denoted here by γk,j, can be expressed as
follows:
γk,j =
Pr,k|hk,j|2
Irk,j + Itj + σ2
v,j
,
k ∈ Rt
(1)
where Irk,j = P
m∈Rt,m̸=k Pr,m|hm,j|2 is the interference
created by other active readers, Itj = P
i∈Tt,i̸=j Pt,i(|uj,i|2)
is the interference created by other contending tags, and σ2
v,j is
the noise component. If the SINR experienced by a given tag
j, which was initially inactive, is above the threshold eγ(d−1)
j
and below the threshold eγ(d)
j
, then the tag is assumed to enter
into state d. The probability of an initially inactive tag j being
activated to state d in epoch-slot n can thus be written as
follows:
Pr{j ∈ T (d)
P
(n)|j ∈ T (0)
P
(n − 1)} =
Pr{eγ(d−1)
j
< max
k
γk,j(n) > eγ(d)
j
},

which means that the probability of tag j being activated to
state d is equal to the probability of the activation SINR being
below eγ(d)
j
and above eγ(d−1)
j
.
C. Backscattering
transmission:
up-link
model
(non-
cooperative)
Once a given tag j has been activated, it starts a random
transmission process to prevent collisions with other active
tags. This random transmission control will be characterized
by a Bernoulli process with parameter pt,j, which is also the
transmission probability. We consider the backscattering factor
βj as the fraction of the received power reused by the tag to
reply to the reader. Therefore, the transmit power of tag j
can be calculated as Pt,j = βjPr,k|hkopt,j|2, where kopt =
arg maxk γk,j denotes the reader that has previously activated
the tag. The SINR of the signal of tag j received by reader k
can then be written as:
bγj,k =
Pt,j|hj,k|2
bIr,k + bItj,k + Pr,kηk + bσ2
v,k
,
j ∈ Tt
(3)
where bIr,k = P
m̸=k Pr,m|gm,k|2 is the interference created
by active readers, bItj,k = P
i̸=j Pt,i|hi,k|2 is the interference
created by other active tags, ηk is the power ratio leaked from
the down-link transmission chain, and bσ2
v,k is the noise at the
reader side. Tag j can be detected by reader k if the received
SINR is above a threshold denoted by ˇγk. The probability of
tag j being detected by reader k in the non-cooperative phase
will be thus given by
Pr{j ∈ TD,k} = Pr{bγj,k > ˇγk},
(4)
which means that the probability of tag j being inside the
set of detected tags of reader k is equal to the probability
of the SINR of tag j at reader k being above the detection
threshold of reader k. Whenever a tag is not correctly detected
by the reader(s), the system enters into a cooperative phase
with a maximum of R transmissions (one direct transmis-
sion and R − 1 possible cooperative retransmissions). The
cooperative retransmissions are continuously requested until
the tag is correctly decoded or until the maximum number of
retransmissions R − 1 has been reached.
D. Tag-to-tag transmission model
The SINR of the signal of tag j received by tag i can be
written as:
ξj,i =
Pt,j|uj,i|2
Ir,i + Iti + σ2
v,i
,
j ∈ Tt,
(5)
where Ir,i = P
m∈Rt Pr,m|hm,i|2 is the interference created
by active readers. Tag j can be detected by tag i if the received
SINR is above a threshold denoted by eγi,r. The probability of
tag j being correctly detected by tag i will be thus given by
Pr{ξj,i > eγi,r},
(6)
which indicates that the probability of tag j being detected by
tag i is simply the probability that its SINR is above the tag
detection threshold of tag i.
E. Cooperative relaying phase model
Whenever a given tag is incorrectly detected by the reader,
the system will request retransmission by means of an ideal
feed-back channel. Tags in a relaying-able state, which have
correctly decoded the original transmission and which are
allowed to retransmit, proceed to do so in the following time
slot. The SINR experienced by the transmission of tag j
received by reader k in the cooperative phase is denoted by
bγ(c)
j,k, and it is given by:
bγ(c)
j,k =
P
i∈Tc,j Pt,i|hk,i|2
bIr,k + bItj,k + Pr,kηk + bσ2
v,k
,
j ∈ Tt
(7)
Since the reader proceeds to the combining of current and
previous received copies of the transmission via the MRC
receiver, the total SINR at the p-th time slot of an epoch slot is
the summation of all SINRs of the transmissions in previous
time slots of the epoch slot:
bγ(tot)
j,k (p) = bγj,k +
p
X
w=2
bγ(c)
j,k(w).
(8)
The total probability of tag j being detected by reader k in
the cooperative phase at the p-th time slot will be thus given
by
Pr{j ∈ TD,k} = Pr{bγ(tot)
j,k (p) > ˇγk},
(9)
which simply indicates the probability that the cooperative
SINR is above the tag detection threshold of reader k. Since
the relaying phases will be activated only when the previous
transmissions were not correctly detected, it is convenient
to rewrite the previous probability in eq.(9) indicating the
statistical dependency on the incorrect reception during the
previous time-slots as follows:
Pr{j ∈ TD,k} = Pr{bγ(tot)
j,k (p) > ˇγk|bγ(tot)
j,k (p−1) < ˇγk}. (10)
Closed-form expressions for these conditional reception prob-
abilities in the case of single-user transmission have been
derived in [22] for Rayleigh fading channels and will be reused
here to calculate performance metrics in subsequent sections.
III. PERFORMANCE METRICS AND MARKOV MODEL
The main performance metric to be used in this paper is
the average tag throughput or tag reading rate, which can
be deﬁned as the long term ratio of correct tag readings
to the total number of time slots used in the measurement.
Before providing an expression for this metric, it is ﬁrst
necessary to deﬁne the following concepts and tools: the
network state information, both the tag activation and tag
reception probability models, and the Markov model that will
be used for for the dynamic performance analysis of the RFID
network.
A. Network state information and tag activation model
The network state information can be deﬁned as the collec-
tion of all the parameters that completely describe the network
at any given epoch slot. In our particular case, the network
state information at epoch slot n, denoted by N(n), is deﬁned

233
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 5 no 3 & 4, year 2012, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

here as the collection of the sets of active readers Rt(n) and
contending tags Tt(n) during epoch slot n:
N(n) = {Rt(n), Tt(n)}.
(11)
Once the network state information has been deﬁned, we can
then deﬁne the probability of tag j being activated and driven
into state d in epoch slot n, given that it was inactive in the
previous epoch slot and conditional on a given realization of
the network state information N(n). This can be written, with
the help of eq. (1) and (2), as follows:
Q(d)
j|N (n) = Pr{j ∈ T (d)
P
(n + 1)|N(n), j ∈ T (0)
P
(n)} =
Pr{eγ(d−1)
j
< max
k
γk,j(n) > eγ(d)
j
}.
(12)
Let us now deﬁne the probability that tag j downgrades its
state from being in state d+x in epoch slot n to being in state d
in the following epoch slot, conditional on a given realization
of the network state information N(n). In this paper a tag
transmission either in cooperative or non-cooperative mode is
the only way for a tag to downgrade its state. In the cooperative
phase, the number of retransmissions depends on the length
of the epoch slot. These conditions can be mathematically
written, with the help of eq.(6), as follows:
G(d)
j|N (n) = Pr{j ∈ T (d)
P
(n + 1)|N(n), j ∈ T (d+x)
P
(n)} =

P
(n) Pr{maxk ξi,j(n) > eγj} ,
d > 0
, (13)
which contains all the possible transitions between the states
of the network whenever a non-cooperative or cooperative
transmission have been used. The common term in eq.(13)
given by pt,j + ¯pt,jpret,j
P
i∈T (d+1)
P
(n) Pr{maxk ξi,j(n) > eγj}
indicates the probability that a tag transmits with probability
pt,j plus the probability that it cooperates with any of the
other tags with probability ¯pt,jpret,j given that it has cor-
rectly detected any of the tags that requires cooperation with
probability P
i∈T (d+1)
P
(n) Pr{maxk ξi,j(n) > eγj}. In the case
that d = 0 we assume that the length of the cooperative
epoch Pr{lep(n) > x} has exceeded the available number
of transmissions of tag j and thus the tag boils down to
state zero or to the inactive state. In the case that d > 0
we assume that the length of the epoch is exactly equal to
the difference between the two tag states Pr{lep(n) = x}.
Therefore, this expression contains the behavior of the tags
that have overheard the transmission of the other tags and
that proceed to act as cooperative relays with a randomized
transmission process. For convenience in the analysis, let
us rewrite these probabilities in terms of the set of active
tags TP (n) by averaging over all values of N(n) where
Tt(n) ∈ TP (n):
Q(d)
j|TP (n) =
X
N (n);Tt(n)∈TP (n)
Pr{N(n)}Q(d)

(14)
and
G(d)
j|TP (n) =
X
N (n);Tt(n)∈TP (n)
Pr{N(n)}G(d)
j|N (n),
(15)
where Pr{N(n)} is the probability of occurrence of a given
realization of the network state information N(n). This term
can be calculated by considering all the combinations of active
tags and readers as follows:
Pr{N(n)} =
Y
k∈Rt

(16)
where (·) = 1 − (·). This concludes our deﬁnitions of the tag
activation probability and network state information.
B. Markov model
In order to deﬁne the Markov model for dynamic per-
formance analysis, let us now calculate the probability of
having a set of active tags TP (n + 1) in epoch slot n + 1
conditional on having the set of active tags TP (n) during the
previous epoch slot. This transition probability must consider
all the combinations of tags that either enter (i.e., they are
activated in epoch slot n) with probability Q(d)
j|TP (n) or leave
the different sets of active tags in their possible different
states (i.e., they transmit once or more in epoch slot n) with
probability G(d)
j|TP (n). This can be expressed as follows:
Pr{TP (n + 1)|TP (n)} =

Let us now arrange the probability of occurrence of all the

vector given by s = [s0, . . . sJJ]T , where (·)T is the transpose
operator (see Fig. 2). This means that we are mapping the
asymmetrical states into a linear state vector where each ele-
ment represents the probability of occurrence of one different
state Pr{TP }. In the example given in Fig. 2, we have only two
tags, where the ﬁrst system state is given by both tags being
active and in a relaying state, while in the second state only tag
1 is active in a relaying state and tag 2 is also active but in a
non-relaying state. The remaining states constitute all possible
combinations of the states of the two tags in the system. Once
these states are mapped into the state vector s, the transition
probabilities between such states (Pr{TP (n + 1)|TP (n)) can
also be mapped into a matrix M, which deﬁnes the Markov
model for state transition probabilities (see Fig. 2). The i, j
entry of the matrix M denotes the transition probability
between state i and state j. The vector of state probabilities

can thus be obtained by solving the following characteristic
equation:
s = Ms,
(18)
using standard eigenvalue analysis or iterative schemes. Each
one of the calculated terms of the vector s can be mapped
back to the original probability space Pr{TP }, which can then
be used to calculate relevant performance metrics as shown in
the following subsection.

C. Tag detection model
Before calculating the tag throughput, ﬁrst we must deﬁne
the correct reception probability of tag j without cooperation,
conditional on the network state information N(n). This
reception probability is given, considering eq.(4), by:
qj|N (n) = Pr{j ∈ TD(n + 1)} =
X
k∈R
Pr{bγj,k > ˇγk},
(19)
which indicates the probability that the SINR of tag j is
above the detection threshold of one of the existing readers
in R. Similarly, the reception probability of tag j during the
cooperative phase in the p-th time slot of an epoch slot can
be written, considering eq.(10),as:
qc
j|N (n)(p) = Pr{j ∈ TD(n + 1)} =
X
k∈R
Pr{bγ(tot)
j,k (p) > ˇγk|bγ(tot)
j,k (p − 1) < ˇγk}
(20)
Now, the total reception probability in epoch slot n, consid-
ering the adaptive activation of the cooperative phase when
detection in the previous transmissions have failed, can be
calculated, with the help of eq.(20) and eq.(19), as follows:
q(tot)
j|N (n) = qj|N (n) + ¯qj|N (n)
R
X
m=1
m−1
Y
p=1
¯qc
j|N (n)(p)qc
j|N (n)(m),
(21)
which is simply the summation of all cooperative cases with
a maximum of R (re)transmissions. Similarly, the average
length of an epoch-slot given the transmission of tag j can
be calculated as:
lep,j|N (n) = qj|N (n)+
¯qj|N (n)
R
X
m=1
m
m−1
Y
p=1
¯qc
j|N (n)(p)qc
j|N (n)(m)
(22)
It is also convenient to re-write these two previous expressions
(eq.(21) and eq.(22)) in terms of the set of active tags TP (n)
by averaging over all values of N(n) where Tt(n) ∈ TP (n),
which leads to:
q(tot)
j|TP (n) =
X
N (n);Tt(n)∈TP (n)
Pr{N(n)}q(tot)
j|N (n)(n)
(23)
and
lep,j|TP (n) =
X
N (n);Tt(n)∈TP (n)
Pr{N(n)}lep,j|N (n)(n)
(24)
D. Tag throughput, stability and backlog delay
The correct tag detection probability per epoch slot can be
obtained by adding all the contributions over the probability
space Pr{TP } previously calculated with the help of the
Markov model in eq.(18). This calculation can be mathemat-
ically expressed, using eq.(23), as follows:
Sj =
X
TP ,j∈TP
Pr{TP }pt,jq(tot)
j|TP .
(25)
The average length of an epoch slot in the steady state can
then be calculated over the probability space as:
L =
X
TP
Pr{TP }

 X
j∈TP
lep,j|TP (n) +
Y
i∈TP
¯pi

 ,
(26)
where the term Q
i∈TP ¯pi accounts for the contribution of one
time slot when non of the tags has transmitted. Finally, the
throughput of tag j can be obtained as the ratio of the correct
tag detection probability per epoch-slot from eq.(25) to the
average length of an epoch in the steady state from eq.(26):
Tj = Sj
L
(27)
As a measure of stability we will use the average number of
activated tags or tags in the backlog state, which can be simply
calculated as follows:
E[|TP |] =
X
TP
Pr{TP }|TP |.
(28)
A high number of active tags means that stability is com-
promised, while a relatively low number indicates that the
algorithm is more stable. The average backlog delay can also
be calculated, using an extension of Little’s theorem as in [23],
as the ratio of the average number of backlogged tags from
eq.(28) to the outgoing trafﬁc in eq.(25) [23]:
Db = E[|TP |]
P
j Sj
.
(29)

E. Fairness
In this paper we will evaluate fairness by means of the
Gini index, which is a metric commonly used in the area of
economics. The index can be mathematically written as [24]:
FG =
P
j
P
k̸=j |Tj − Tk|
2J P
j Tj
(30)
A value of the Gini index close to zero means the highest
degree of fairness, while a value close to one is related to a
worsening of fairness conditions.
IV. RESULTS
Let us now present some graphical results that will demon-
strate the beneﬁts of the proposed approach. We consider a
scenario with K = 5 readers and two groups of tags. The ﬁrst
group has J1 = 4 tags and the second J2 = 3 tags. Tags inside
the same group have the same channel statistics, while tags
across different groups have different channel statistics. For
convenience in the analysis we consider that the maximum
number of cooperative retransmissions is 1 or R = 2. This
also means that only two active states for tags (D = 2)
will be considered: A relaying state and a non-relaying state.
To illustrate the beneﬁts of the proposed approach we will
consider ALOHA operation rules both at the reader and tag
sides. This means that only transmissions without collision
will be considered as useful. In addition, all readers and tags
will use the same transmission and retransmission parameters.
The idea behind these assumptions is to simplify calculation
while preserving some asymmetrical aspects that are addressed
by the proposed approach. Tags in the ﬁrst group are activated
with a probability of Q(1) = 0.1 to state 1, and with probability
Q(2) = 0.5 to state 2. Tags in the second group will be
assumed to have activation probabilities Q(1) = 0.2 and
Q(2) = 0.3. Non-cooperative reception probabilities for the
ﬁrst group will be given by q = 0.6, while for the second one a
value of q = 0.92 will be used. Cooperative reception between
tags will be given by a probability of qcoop = 0.94. Finally,
tags in the relaying able state that have correctly detected
the transmission of another tag and that have received the
indication from the set of readers to relay a copy, will do
it with a probability of prep = 0.9.
Figure 3 illustrates the 3-dimensional perspective of the tag
throughput in the case of the cooperative ALOHA protocol
versus the probabilities of transmission of tags (pt) and readers
(pr). The non-cooperative case is illustrated in Fig. 4. The
gain of the cooperative case over the non-cooperative case
is displayed in Figure 5, where we can observe that the
cooperative scheme provides gains for almost all values of
transmission probabilities. This conﬁrms that tag cooperative
schemes provide some useful gains for the operation of the
system. In terms of the number of backlogged users, Figure 6
and Figure 7 display the results for the cooperative and non-
cooperative case, respectively, for users in state 1. For users in
state 2, the results are displayed in Figure 8 and Figure 9, while
the combined state 1 and state 2 is displayed in Figure 10 and
Figure 11. It can be observed only a slight improvement in the
case of the cooperative cases at low values of tag and reader
transmission probabilities. This effect on the improvement of
stability features is more evident in Figure 12 and Figure 13
for the backlog delay of the cooperative and non-cooperative
schemes, respectively. The gain in delay reduction in Figure
14 conﬁrms that cooperative schemes experience a reduction
of the backlog delay which is useful for improving the stability
of the system. Finally, in terms of the fairness indicator,
Figure 15 and Figure 16 display the results of the Gini index
for the cooperative and non-cooperative case, respectively. It
can be observed, particularly in Figure 17, that the relative
gain in fairness is slightly improved for the cooperative case,
particularly for values with high load or high transmission
probability.

V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper has provided a framework for the MAC-PHY
cross-layer design and optimization of RFID systems with
tag cooperation. In addition, the modeling of the tag activity
allows for the characterization of different energy harvesting
capabilities. This energy harvesting feature allows some of

the tags with the larger level of harvested energy to act as
relays for other tags with less favored conditions. The model
proposed here includes both the contention of the readers to
activate the tags and the contention process of the tags to reply
to the network of readers. This approach is novel in RFID
while being more accurate as we can now shed light on how
the processes of activation and detection of tags of RFID occur.
The proposed Markov model for asymmetrical systems allows
for investigation of stability aspects and dynamic performance
assessment. Illustrative results with an ALOHA protocol show
that tag cooperation provide general improvements in terms
of throughput, stability, backlog delay and fairness over its
non-cooperative counterparts. These results pave the way for
more advanced cooperation algorithms with improved physical
layer processing. The framework developed here can be easily
upgraded to cope with new schemes at the physical and
medium access layers of RFID and potentially for systems
with sensors that will be relevant in the future Internet of
Things.
