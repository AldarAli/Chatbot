Abstract—As described herein, we propose a method to 
increase the amount of data used to estimate the best time for 
viewing seasonal organisms, particularly flowers. Observations 
of the best viewing times of seasonal organisms, conducted by 
the Japan Meteorological Agency, are required by those in the 
tourism industry and tourists, but the numbers of such official 
observations are decreasing: an accurate alternative is needed. 
As one alternative, we have investigated estimation of the best 
viewing seasons and times of biological organisms using 
Twitter, which is widely used in Japan. Specifically addressing 
difficulties posed by the decrease in data for estimating the best 
viewing times of biological organisms, which was a difficulty of 
earlier research, we propose a new method for improvement. 
The proposed method using co-occurring words is used for 
obtaining tweets related to seasonality. Combining the 
proposed method with the conventional method for estimating 
the best viewing times of seasonal organisms showed improved 
accuracy compared to that achieved using the conventional 
method alone. 
Keywords- SNS; Twitter; estimating; cherry blossoms; co-
occurrence. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Along with the proliferation of Social Networking 
Services (SNSs), tourism-related information has begun to 
be disseminated and accumulated with such services. In 
recent years, many tourists have begun to collect tourism 
information using SNSs instead of consulting guidebooks or 
tourism websites. The use of SNSs allows many users to 
share information  through posts. It is not uncommon for 
tourists to select tourist destinations using that shared 
tourism information. Twitter [1], an SNS that allows the 
sharing of tourism information, is widely used for posting 
and viewing information related to events and hobbies. Posts, 
such as text, photographs, and images are designated as 
"tweets." Additionally, users can add location information to 
tweets at their discretion. These tweets with location 
information are called "geotagged tweets." Geotagged tweets 
are used to share what is happening where at the moment. 
Therefore, tweet information obtained from geotagged 
tweets reflects real-world circumstances. For this reason, 
geotagged tweets are anticipated for use as a social sensor 
that allows tourists to estimate and obtain tourism 
information for a region in real time, irrespective of location. 
Sakura, or cherry blossoms, are an important Japanese 
tourist resource. During the cherry blossoming season, many 
people in Japan enjoy viewing the cherry blossoms in areas 
where they live. Additionally, places known as cherry 
blossom spots attract visitors from afar, thereby producing a 
bustling atmosphere. The gathering of many people 
engenders the dissemination of much information about 
various regions and spots, which can then be analyzed to 
estimate the best time to view the cherry blossoms. Knowing 
the best time to view the cherry blossoms therefore has a 
considerably important effect on the tourism industry and on 
the regional economy. In fact, people working in lodging and 
tourism industries, at local shops and hotels, can use 
information about the best time to view cherry blossoms 
several weeks to months in advance to forecast demand and 
to anticipate guests. The timing of cherry blossoms also 
varies because of weather conditions and climate change. 
The Japan Meteorological Agency [2] conducts annual 
observations of biological seasons, including the days of 
cherry blossom blooming and full bloom. However, because 
of difficulties in maintaining observation targets and 
securing personnel, 
the 
scale of 
biological 
season 
observations has been reduced. In 2022, the number of 
observation targets for plants and animals has decreased to 
just six, down from 34 in 2021. Although observations of the 
days of cherry blossom blooming and full bloom are still 
continuing, it is possible that they will eventually be scaled 
back. Therefore, using Twitter's geotagged tweets to estimate 
the best time to view cherry blossoms is a low-cost and 
sustainable method that can be done without human labor. 
Furthermore, estimating the best time to view cherry 
blossoms can provide useful information for the tourism 
industry and regional economy. It might also be helpful for 
predicting the best time to view cherry blossoms considering 
weather conditions and climate change. 
Research on extracting tourist information from SNS can 
include the following. Mizutani et al. [3] developed a system 
that takes into account user needs and which conducts group 
tourism activities using SNS user information. Wang et al. 
[4] proposed a method of generating a tourist map using the 
popularity and satisfaction of tourist spots calculated from 
SNS-posted photos. Guanshen et al. [5] developed a tourist 
recommendation system that recommends tourist spots to 
users who want to plan a trip during specific periods, such as 
early autumn or Christmas holidays, using Twitter and

Wikipedia. As in earlier research, a method for estimating 
the best time to see cherry blossoms using geotagged tweets 
with moving averages has been proposed. Endo et al. [6] 
proposed a method of estimating the best time to see cherry 
blossoms using a simple moving average of geotagged 
tweets. The method is particularly useful in prefectures and 
municipalities where geotagged tweets are obtainable. 
Takahashi et al. [7] used weighted moving averages to 
estimate the best time to view cherry blossoms. Specifically, 
using a 5-day weighted moving average and a 7-day 
weighted moving average, they were able to improve the 
estimation accuracy. They performed estimation for each 
prefecture. However, their method showed that the 
prediction accuracy decreased for prefectures with fewer 
obtained tweets. Moreover, their method was not useful to 
estimate the best time to view cherry blossoms in regions 
where they were unable to see a trend because only a few 
tweets were collected per prefecture. Therefore, by 
increasing the number of tweets used for estimation, one can 
improve the prediction accuracy for prefectures that had 
previously been predicted to be less accurate using earlier 
methods. Also, one can produce estimates for prefectures 
that were not able to be estimated earlier because of a lack of 
tweets. As a method to increase the number of tweets used 
for estimation, the authors propose the use of words that co-
occur with "cherry blossoms." Using such tweets that show 
the same trend as that for annual cherry blossoms, one can 
produce estimates even for prefectures with few tweets. As a 
first step, the authors report a method to increase the dataset 
used for cherry blossom estimation using co-occurring words. 
This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the 
proposed method is explained in detail to increase the 
amount of data used for estimating the timing of cherry 
blossoms. The proposed method extracts words that co-occur 
with cherry blossoms, collects tweets using the extracted co-
occurring words, and uses the collected tweets to estimate 
the timing of cherry blossom viewing. The next three 
sections show the results of determining the co-occurring 
words using the proposed method and the results of 
estimating the best time to see cherry blossoms. The final 
section, Section 4, presents the conclusion of this paper. 
II. 
PROPOSED METHOD 
This section presents a method for determining the 
optimal time to view certain objects of keywords, such as 
cherry blossoms, through the analysis of co-occurring words 
and collected tweets. First, we perform a co-occurrence 
judgment of the chosen keyword. Next, we gather tweets that 
include the selected co-occurring words. Finally, we estimate 
the optimal time for the original keyword based on the 
collected tweets. For this study, we particularly examine 
keywords that are relevant to tourism information, 
specifically targeting cherry blossoms. Other keywords that 
could be considered might be hydrangea, autumn leaves, and 
wildflowers. However, we have not examined those 
keywords. The computer platforms and environments used in 
making the predictions are listed in Table 1. This study 
specifically examines cherry blossoms. The specific steps of 
this method are the following.

1. We propose a method for determining the optimal time 
to view a seasonal object as a keyword (in this case, "sakura" 
or cherry blossoms) by collecting tweets that include the 
keyword and using co-occurring words to infer the optimal 
time for viewing. The tweets were collected from February 
2015 through May 2022. The keyword used for the study 
was "sakura," written either in kanji, katakana, or hiragana. 
2. The Japanese morphological analysis tool MeCab [8] 
was used to conduct morphological analyses of the tweets 
collected in 1. MeCab is an open-source tool for performing 
morphological analysis of Japanese. Morphological analysis 
refers to the process of breaking down text into words or 
parts of speech. MeCab is characterized by its ability to 
perform high-precision analysis that incorporates evaluation 
of parts of speech and inflection types. It is used widely for 
Japanese morphological analysis. Using MeCab, the tweet 
text was broken down into words. The following 
preprocessing 
was 
performed 
in 
preparation 
for 
morphological analysis. First, cleaning was applied to the 
text to remove noise, such as URLs and symbols. Next, 
normalization was done to facilitate analysis of the words. 
Because Japanese tweets include a mix of full-width and 
half-width characters, full-width numbers were converted to 
half-width numbers, half-width katakana was converted to 
full-width katakana, alphabetical characters were converted 
entirely to lowercase, and numbers were all replaced with 
"0". After this preprocessing, MeCab was used to break 
down the tweet text into words. Additionally, MeCab and 
IPAdic, a dictionary for morphological analysis, were used to 
extract words corresponding to the three parts of speech that 
are likely to be used as collocates: "noun," "adjectival noun," 
and "verb." Then, the frequency of each was counted. Here, 
"adjectival nouns," which represent the stem of an adjective, 
are a part of speech introduced as a major classification by 
UniDic [9]. 
3. We conducted co-occurrence judgment of the top 1% 
of the words collected in "2". Words found to have 
frequency of less than 1% were determined to have low 
relevance to the keyword "sakura" and were not explored as 
co-occurring words because their occurrence in tweets 
including "sakura" from February 2015 through May 2022 
was in the single digits. For the method of co-occurrence 
judgment, we calculated the skewness and kurtosis of the 
frequency distribution of each word and determined the 
words which met the criteria as co-occurring words. 
Skewness and kurtosis are statistics that are used to indicate

how much a distribution deviates from a normal distribution 
and how sharp it is. They are regarded as appropriate 
indicators for finding co-occurring words with the same peak 
as the keyword during the annual tweet trend. The criteria for 
determination are given as  (1) and (2) below. The formulas 
respectively represent skewness and kurtosis of the 
frequency distribution of each word as S and K , and the 
skewness and kurtosis of the keyword "sakura" as Ss and Ks, 
respectively.

In this section, the method used to calculate skewness 
and kurtosis is described. The skewness and kurtosis were 
calculated for tweets that include the word in question in the 
text, extracted between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 
2018. The skewness (Ske) and kurtosis (Kur) are calculated 
using the formulas shown respectively in (3) and (4) below, 
where n represents the number of days in the specified period, 
xi denotes the value for the ith day (i = 1, 2, ..., n), x-bar 
stands for the mean value for the specified period, and s 
represents the sample standard deviation. In this case, n is 
365 days because the period used for this study is January 1, 
2018 through December 31, 2018.

To confirm the trend of tweets showing the same 
tendency as that of cherry blossoms throughout the year, it 
was necessary to set the period to include all months from 
January through December. Additionally, while the tweets 
were collected by our research team on a server that we 
manage, there were periods during which the collection was 
stopped because of power outages. To avoid any skewing of 
the calculated skewness and kurtosis values, it was necessary 
to minimize the inclusion of periods when collection was not 
possible. Therefore, we adopted the period from January 1, 
2018 through December 31, 2018, which satisfies these two 
conditions, for the calculation of skewness and kurtosis. 
4. To ascertain the peak period of cherry blossoms, 
tweets including the words identified as co-occurring words 
in "2" were collected. The peak period was estimated from 
the collected tweets. Estimation of the peak period was 
conducted using the same moving average method as the 
conventional method. The moving average used was a 
simple moving average. The n-day simple moving average is 
obtainable from (5) as shown below. 
Avg 𝑛 = (𝑥𝑖 + 𝑥𝑖−1 + ⋯ + 𝑥𝑖−(𝑛−2)+𝑥𝑖−(𝑛−1)) 𝑛
⁄   (5) 
The next two (6) and (7) were used to find the peak 
period by judging the period that simultaneously satisfies 
both equations for more than three consecutive days. 
Equation (6) identifies the period during which the number 
of tweets is higher than the average for a year. Equation (7) 
shows the period during which the number of tweets 
increases suddenly. The peak period is therefore identified 
by combining these two equations. In (6) and (7), xi 
represents the number of tweets on day i. Also, Avg n 
represents the moving average over n days. 
𝑥𝑖 > Avg 365  
 
 
 
 (6) 
Avg 10 < Avg 20  
 
 
 
 (7) 
The traditional method only collected tweets that 
included the word "sakura", resulting in an approximate 
daily tweet count of 30. However, the use of co-occurring 
words in the text caused an average of 400 tweets, which 
rendered the slight changes identified using the traditional 
moving-average method unreliable and which markedly 
reduced the estimation accuracy. Therefore, a moving 
average that was adjusted to the number of tweets including 
co-occurring words was used. 
For this study, we specifically examined the increase of 
the data volume, which has persisted as an important 
difficulty 
associated 
with 
the 
conventional 
method. 
Moreover, we sought to solve it merely by changing the data 
collection method. However, because of differences in the 
data volume, it became necessary to change the conditions 
used for estimation. Finally, we adjusted them to match the 
results we sought. 
5. Finally, we compared the estimated periods obtained 
using  the conventional method and the estimated the period 
obtained only from co-occurring words. We found that both 
results had similar accuracy. Therefore, we thought that an 
increase in accuracy could be expected by combining these 
two estimation results. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This paper presents results of our co-occurrence word 
determination and visual appeal estimation. The results 
obtained for the co-occurrence words collected for each of 
the three prefectures of Tokyo, Kyoto, and Shizuoka are 
presented respectively in Tables 2, 3, and 4. Table 2 for 
Tokyo shows the presence of the name of the famous Ueno 
Onshi Park, known for its cherry blossoms, as well as words 
related to cherry blossoms. Similarly, Table 3 for Kyoto 
shows the presence of the names Gion and Uji, which are 
also famous cherry blossom spots. Table 4 for Shizuoka 
shows the famous cherry blossom spots of Kawazu and 
Suruga. From these data, it can be inferred that the proposed 
method of co-occurrence word determination can be used to 
find relevant words. Additionally, it is noteworthy that 
Tokyo was found to have the most co-occurrence words 
among the three prefectures. That finding can be attributed to 
the fact that the total number of tweets collected for Tokyo 
was 179,332, whereas the numbers of tweets collected for 
Shizuoka and Kyoto were 15,596 and 16,790: the tweets 
collected for Tokyo were about 10 times more numerous 
than for either of the other two prefectures. 
Figures 1–6 present results obtained when estimating the 
optimal viewing period for cherry blossoms from March 1 
through April 30 of 2022. The correct period shown in the 
figures refers to the period from the date of flowering 
announced by the Meteorological Agency through the date 
of full blooming. That period is used for evaluation of the 
estimated results. In each figure, the number of tweets 
including the word "cherry blossoms" is shown in a stacked 
bar graph. The estimated optimal viewing period is shown in 
a shaded area. Figure 1 shows the period estimated as the 
optimal viewing period for Tokyo, either by the conventional 
method or by the proposed method. Figure 2 presents the

both the conventional method and the proposed method. 
Figure 3 shows the period estimated as the optimal viewing

the best viewing time for Shizuoka prefecture. Figure 6 
shows the period during which both the conventional method 
and the proposed method estimated the best viewing time for 
Shizuoka prefecture. As Figures 1, 3, and 5 show, the 
estimated period for all three prefectures is longer than the 
actual period, which is likely attributable to the fact that the 
actual period is from the blooming day through the full 
blooming day. Actually, it takes about 10 days to 2 weeks 
from the full blooming day until cherry blossoms start to 
scatter [10]. Early blooming cherry blossoms known as 
Kawazuzakura, which are famous for blooming in early 
January and reaching their best viewing time by early March, 
are thought to be related to estimation of the best viewing 
time from March 1 [11], as shown in Figure 5. This finding 
is consistent with the period stated as tourist information. 
Moreover, this finding is thought to have led to estimation of 
the best viewing time as that from early March. 
We evaluated results of estimating the blooming period 
of cherry blossoms using both traditional methods and 
methods that use co-occurring words. Table 5 presents 
results obtained from the evaluation using the metrics of

precision and recall, which are indicators of the accuracy of 
estimation. The Japan Meteorological Agency defines the 
blooming period as the period from the start of blooming to 
full bloom. The recall metric is used to evaluate how well the 
estimated period falls within this period. The precision 
metric is calculated as the proportion of the estimated period 
which falls within the blooming period. In Table 5, "sakura" 
refers to results of estimation conducted using traditional 
methods, whereas "co-occurring words" refers to results of

estimation using the proposed method. The "or" and "and" 
columns respectively refer to the evaluation of periods 
estimated as blooming by either the traditional method or the 
proposed method, and by both methods. 
As Table 5 shows, when doing estimation with co-
occurring words in Tokyo and Shizuoka, the prediction 
accuracy is lower than when estimation is done using 
traditional methods. In contrast, when using co-occurring 
words to conduct an estimation for Kyoto, the prediction 
accuracy is higher than when doing an estimation using 
traditional methods. Therefore, the results of traditional 
methods and the proposed methods vary depending on the 
prefecture. However, when evaluating the results of 
estimating the period during which either traditional methods 
or proposed methods are regarded as the best time, the 
reproducibility of the three prefectures can be improved. 
Therefore,  the accuracy can probably be improved by 
combining traditional methods and the proposed methods. In 
addition, since the proposed method increases the amount of 
data by using co-occurrence word judgments, the amount of 
computation required to estimate the best time to visit is 
larger than that of the prior method. Since the objective of 
the present study is to suppress the decline in prediction 
accuracy when the amount of data used for estimating the 
best time to visit is reduced, which was an issue with the

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This report described our study of a method for 
estimating the cherry blossom blooming period using geo-
tagged tweets and co-occurring words. To achieve higher 
accuracy of estimation, we proposed a method for increasing 
the data amount using co-occurring words related to 
keywords. When estimating the cherry blossom blooming 
period using co-occurring words, we demonstrated a 
prediction accuracy equivalent to that achieved using the 
conventional method, which used only cherry blossoms. 
However, the estimated period differed from that of the 
conventional method. Using this difference, we were able to 
improve the accuracy by combining results of the 
conventional method and the proposed method. No 
improvement in accuracy was found when using only co-
occurring words for prediction, perhaps because tweets 
including words that co-occur with "cherry blossoms" also 
included many tweets that were unrelated to the plant. 
Moreover, these noise tweets might have impaired the 
method, making it less accurate. Removal of these noisy 
tweets is left as a task for future work. In future studies, we 
would like to perform estimation for seasonal words that are 
unrelated to cherry blossoms. Thereby, we can ascertain 
whether the proposed method is effective for other words.
