Abstract—Three-hop wireless relay channels in the presence of 
Rician fading will be examined in this article.  This system 
model is generated by the product of three independent, but 
not 
necessarily

distributed, 
Rician 
random 
variables (RVs). Some important performance of this system, 
such as cumulative distribution function (CDF), outage 
probability (Pout) and average fade duration (AFD) of wireless 
relay communication system working over Rician multipath 
fading environment will be calculated and graphically 
presented. The fading parameters' impact will be analyzed 
based on the obtained graphs.  
Keywords- average fade duration (AFD); outage probability 
(Pout); random variables; Rician fading; three-hop relaying 
system.

 INTRODUCTION 
In mobile channels in the presence of multipath fading, 
properties of communications systems are disturbed 
significantly due to the signal envelope fluctuations [1][2]. It 
is of vital importance to characterize those random variations 
in terms of the fading characteristics and derive both first and 
second order [3][4]. The first order performance we will 
calculate here is outage probability (Pout). 
The closed-form expressions for Pout, channel capacity 
(CC), and average symbol error probability (ASEP) are 
derived in [5] for amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-hop relay 
network in the presence of Rayleigh fading. Based on 
approximation of multi-hop relay by dual-hop relay systems, 
the analytical expressions are obtained for some scenarios. 
A three-hop communication system, as we analyze, is 
illustrated in Fig. 1 [6]. It consists of the source node, 
denoted by (S), sending the information signal to the 
destination (D) with the help of two consecutive relays, 
namely R1 and R2. The AF relay nodes are assumed to be 
untrusted and hence, they can overhear the transmitted 
information signal while relaying.

All nodes are equipped with a single antenna operating 
in half-duplex mode. The consecutive relays are necessary 
helpers to deliver the information signal to the destination. 
This assumption is valid when the network nodes 
experience a heavy shadowing, or when the distance 
between terminals is large, or when the nodes suffer from 
limited power resources [6].  
Three-hop system is analyzed in [7]. For three-hop 
relay 
system 
we 
will 
obtain 
the 
second 
order 
characteristics. The knowledge of second-order statistics 
of multipath fading channels (level crossing rate (LCR) 
and average fade duration (AFD)) can help us better 
understand and mitigate the effects of fading. For example, 
the AFD determines the average length of error bursts in 
fading channels [8]. So, in fading channels with relatively 
large AFD, long data blocks will be significantly affected 
by the channel fades than short blocks [9].  
It is necessary to know this fact for choosing the frame 
length for coded packetized systems, designing interleaved 
or non-interleaved concatenated coding methods [10], 
optimizing the interleaver size, choosing the buffer depth 
for adaptive modulation schemes [11] [12], throughput 
(efficiency) estimation of communication protocols, ... 
Empirically-verified formulas for the LCR and AFD of 
common multipath fading models are necessary for all 
observed applications. 
The output signal from multi-hop relay system is 
product of random variables (RVs) at hops outputs. In 
[13], multi-hop system in the presence of Nakagami fading 
is analyzed through N*Nakagami distribution as suitable 
for modeling of realistic wireless fading channels. 
Statistical analysis of cascaded Rician fading channels is 
given in [14]. Different performance is derived for both 
fading channels in terms of the Meijer G-function. 
 We observed different products of RVs and derived a 
number of system performance for dual and three-hop 
relay systems in closed forms in [15]-[18]. Wireless relay 
system with two sections (dual-hop) in κ-µ short term 
fading channel is observed in [15]. In [16], an analytical 
approach for evaluating performance of dual-hop 
cooperative link over shadowed Ricean fading channels is 
presented. All performance of product of three Rayleigh 
RVs are presented in [17] and the statistics of product of 
three Nakagami-m RVs is given in [18].  
Here, we consider a three-hop relay channels as a 
special case of multi-hop relay network in the presence of 
Rician fading. This case is important for the channels 
where an optical line of sight is present. We opine that 
there are not enough reported works in this area. 
This paper is organized through four sections. In 
introduction, the basic points are given. In the second 
section, the first order characteristics of the product of 
three Rician RVs are introduced. In the third section, the 
second order characteristics of the product of three Rician 
RVs are presented and graphs for all performance are 
plotted. The acknowledgement and conclusions close the 
article. 
II. THE FIRST ORDER PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCT OF 
THREE RICIAN RANDOM VARIABLES  
For description of three-hop wireless relay system it is 
necessary to derive the first-order characteristics of the 
product of three Rician RVs. 
A. PDF of Product of Three Rician RVs 
Rician fading is a stochastic model for radio 
propagation where the signal arrives at the receiver by 
several different paths when one of the paths, typically a 
line of sight signal or some strong reflection signals, is 
much stronger than the others. In Rician fading, the 
amplitude gain is characterized by a Rician distribution. It 
was named after Stephen O. Rice [19]. 
Rician RVs xi have Rician distribution [19]:

Rayleigh fading is a model for stochastic fading when 
there is no line of sight signal. Because of that it is 
considered as a special case of the more generalized 
concept of Rician fading. Rayleigh fading is obtained for 
Rician factor κ=0. For this reason, derived expressions for 
CDF of product of three Rician RVs can be used for 
evaluation a CDF of product of three Rayleigh RVs, also 
for CDF of product of two Rayleigh RVs and Rician RV, 
and CDF of product of two Rician RVs and Rayleigh RV. 
The obtained results can be used in performance analysis 
of wireless relay communication radio system with three 
sections in the presence of multipath fading. This means 
that derived CDFs are used for the next cases: 1) when 
Rician fading is present in all three sections (
i  0
, 
i=1,2,3), then 2) when Rayleigh fading is present in all 
three sections (κ1=κ2=κ3=0), the next 3) when Rayleigh 
fading is present in two sections and Rician in one 
(κ1=κ2=0, 
3
  0
), and 4) when Rayleigh fading is present 
in one and Rician fading in two sections (κ1=0, 
2
  0
,
3
  0
 ). A case with κ →∞ present the scenario 
without fading. 
C. Outage probability of Product of Three Rician RVs 
The outage probability is an important performance 
measure of communication links operating over fading 
channels. Outage probability is defined as the probability 
that information rate is less than the required threshold 
information rate th. Pout is the probability that an outage 
will occur within a specified time period: 
 



where px(x) is the PDF of the signal and th is the system 
protection ratio depending on the type of modulation 
employed and the receiver characteristics [21].

power Ω=1.

Plots of the outage probability, for different values of 
parameters, are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The choice of 
parameters is intended to illustrate the broad range of 
shapes that the curves of the resulting distribution can 
exhibit. It is evident that performance is improved with an 
increase in Rician factors i. Also, higher values of fading 
powers Ωi tend to reduce the outage probability and 
improve system performance, as it is expected. 
III. THE SECOND ORDER PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT 
OF THREE RICIAN RANDOM VARIABLES  
Level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration 
(AFD) of the signal envelope are two important second-
order statistics of wireless channel. They give useful 
information about the dynamic temporal behavior of 
multipath wireless fading channels. 
A. LCR of Product of Three Rician RVs 
Level crossing rate is one of the most important 
second-order 
performance 
measures 
of 
wireless 
communication system, which has already found 
application in modelling and design of communication 
system but also in the design of error correcting codes, 
optimization of interleave size and throughput analysis. 
The envelope LCR is defined as the expected rate (in 
crossings per second) at which a fading signal envelope 
crosses the given level in the downward direction [4]. The 
LCR of RV tells how often the envelope crosses a certain 
threshold x [22]. We should determine the joint 
probability density function (JPDF) between x and x , 


(2.106)] to finally calculate the LCR. LCR is defined as

We give in this subsection some new graphs for 
normalized LCR of product of three Rician RVs 
depending on this product x with Rician factor i and 
average power i as parameters of curves in Figs. 4 and 5.

LCR grows as Rician signal power increases. The 
impact of signal envelope power on the LCR is higher for 
bigger values of Rician factor i. LCR increases with 
increasing of Ωi for all values of signal envelope. The 
impact of signal envelope on the LCR is larger for higher 
values of the signal envelope when Ωi changes. It is 
important bring to mind that system has better 
performance for lower values of the LCR. 
B. AFD of Product of Three Rician RVs  
Average fade duration measures how long a signal’s 
envelope or power stays below a given target threshold 
derived from the LCR [4]. According to that, AFD is [25,

The numerator is the cumulative distribution function 
of x from (4), and Nx (x) is LCR given in (8) [26].  
 
 
Figure 6.  AFD normalized by fm versus signal envelope x for different 
values of Rician factor i and signal powers Ωi=1. 
 
Figure 7.  AFD normalized by fm depending on signal envelope x for 
=1 and different values of signal powers Ωi. 
The normalized AFD (Txfm) of product of three Rician 
RVs is plotted in Figs. 6 and 7 versus signal envelope x. 
One can see that for higher values of i and lower x, AFD 
has smaller values. Also, it is visible from Fig. 7 that AFD 
increases for all signal envelopes and lower Ωi. The impact 
of Ωi is bigger at higher envelopes.

CONCLUSION 
Due to transmit power limitations, the multi-hop 
communication in relay systems is introduced for 
improving the quality of transmission in cellular and ad 
hoc networks. These benefits of multi-hop relays are 
especially visible in rural areas with small population and 
low level of traffic density. 
In this work, we presented previously determined 
formulas for the PDF and LCR and derived important 
expressions for CDF, Pout and AFD of the three-hop 
wireless relay system in the presence of Rician fading. 
This system output signal is the product of three Rician 
RVs. 
Outage probability is defined as the point at which the 
receiver power value falls below the threshold (where the 
power value relates to the minimum signal or signal to 
noise ratio (SNR) within a cellular networks). It is said that 
the receiver is out of the range of Base Station in cellular 
communications. Average fade duration is used to 
determine how long a user is in continuous outage. This is 
important for coding design. 
Based on the presented results it is possible to 
anticipate the behavior of the real wireless relay system in 
the presence of analyzed fading. Future works will 
introduce general fading distributions in consideration of 
three-hop relay systems’ performance.
