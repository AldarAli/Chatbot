INTRODUCTION
Bioinformatics is a young, interdisciplinary area of re-
search. It has been created in 1982 and it was related to
projects aiming at creation and studying databases contain-
ing information about Deoxyribonucleic acid/Ribonucleic acid
(DNA/RNA) and protein sequences. Nowadays, bioinformati-
cal studies are deﬁned as analysis and interpretation of these
biological data using theoretical methods taken from mathe-
matical, physical and biological sciences.
Deriving the information from the DNA or protein se-
quences became a modern tool for solving many problems
in biology and in medicine. Bioinformatical studies not only
constitute an important supplement of experimental works, but
in many cases they can replace experiments. It is particularly
important if animals have to be used in the experiments and
if the experimental studies are expensive and time consuming.
Therefore, developing high quality theoretical methods is of
particular importance. Fast development in this area of research
has been observed during the last two decades.
In particular, we have implemented nonstandard methods
which have not been used in bioinformatics so far: ideas
borrowed from the dynamics of the rigid body and from
the statistical spectroscopy. We have constructed algorithms
which can discover differences in a single base for a pair of
DNA sequences. We can tell which base it is and indicate
its approximate location in the sequence. Our methods can
be applied to DNA sequences of an arbitrary length and the
calculations can be performed in a short time.
The aim of our studies is both application of our methods to
the studies which are directly related to biology and medicine
and a construction of new methods which may be useful for
studies, for example, the mutations of viruses or the creation
of phylogenetic trees. We are going to predict directions of
the mutations of the inﬂuenza viruses and the Zika virus
by combining physico-chemical calculations with similarity
analyses of DNA sequences (due to a large practical signif-
icance). Different modes of implementation of our methods
and searching for methods useful for the description of the
dynamics of the mutation processes is another aim of our
studies. Such studies are particularly important in designing
new kinds of vaccine.
Moreover, we plan to work on the classiﬁcation of biolog-
ical structures by ﬁnding new similarity properties, deﬁning
new descriptors which in a numerical way characterize these
properties and on the construction of new methods of compari-
son of these structures. It is worth mentioning that ﬁnding new
classiﬁcation schemes often led to important developments in
the understanding of the research area for which these schemes
have been created (standard examples are the periodic table
of elements in chemistry, the Herzsprug-Russel diagram in
astronomy, the systematics of living organisms in biology).
In Section II we present the Graphical bioinformatics
method called by us 2D-dynamic representation of DNA se-
quences.
II.
METHOD AND EXPECTED RESULTS
Methods known in the literature as Graphical Representa-
tions of DNA/RNA Sequences [1] combine ideas from differ-
ent areas of science. They enable both graphical and numerical
comparisons of DNA sequences. Contrary to the frequently
used methods based on the alignment of the sequences [2],
graphical representations allow us to consider each aspect of
similarity separately. Another advantage of these methods is
that they are not demanding computationally.
In this work, we present a graphical representation method
introduced by us and called 2D-dynamic Representations of
DNA Sequences [3]. A speciﬁc feature of this approach is a
simple adaptation of some ideas of the classical dynamics.
Examples of 2D-dynamic graphs representing DNA sequence
are shown in Figures 1 and 2. As we can see, the shapes
of the graphs corresponding to different DNA sequences are
different. The issues related to the choice and to the properties
of the numerical characteristics of the graphs (descriptors), are
also discussed. We have deﬁned the following descriptors of
2D-dynamic graphs:
•
Moments of the mass-density distributions,
•
Angles between x axis and principal axis of inertia of
the graphs,
•
Coordinates of the centers of mass of the graphs,
•
Principal moments of inertia of the graphs.
The n-th moment of a discrete distribution ρE is deﬁned as
ME,n = cE
X
i
ρEiEn
i ,
E = x, y and the normalization constant
cE =
 X
i
ρEi
!−1

Summarizing,
•
2D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences allows
for both graphical and numerical analysis of similar-
ity/dissimilarity of DNA sequences.
•
The accuracy is high.
•
Negative:
The history of emergence of a graph is lost since
the graphs self-overlap. This point is corrected in 3D-
dynamic representation of DNA sequences.
We have already applied this method for a characterization of
the Zika virus genome [4]. The aim of the future work is an
application of this approach to a characterization of inﬂuenza
viruses. We expect that the nonstandard method can reveal
some new features of the considered objects.
