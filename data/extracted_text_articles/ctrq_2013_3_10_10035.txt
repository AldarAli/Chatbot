Abstract—In Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A), many 
techniques for improving the throughput of the system have 
been suggested. One among these techniques is the deployment 
of device-to-device (D2D) communication as an underlay to the 
International Mobile Telecommunications-Advanced (IMT-A) 
cellular network. However, deploying D2D technology in 
overlay macro cellular network may generate high interference 
to macro users (mUEs) as the D2D devices shares the same 
spectrum resource with mUEs. In this paper, we propose a 
partial co-channel based overlap resource power control 
(PC.OVER) scheme by mitigation of co-channel interference 
between mUE and D2D receiver (D2DR). In the proposed 
scheme, when more than one D2DR competes for the same 
resource with mUE, the power for those D2DRs which compete 
for the resource with mUE is reduced to low power. The 
simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms 
D2D with partial co-channel scheme in terms of the system 
throughput and outage probability for mUEs and D2DRs.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Recently, there has been an enormous increase in the 
amount of data traffics treated by cellular networks, due to 
the increase in mobile multimedia services. The cellular 
network needs to adopt these fast growing changes which 
bring about high demands of data rate services. To achieve 
this purpose, major efforts have been spent on the 
development of Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 
LTE for high data rate and system capacity. Different studies 
showed that the macro base station (mBS) handles more 
traffics than in the past years. Installing new base station(s) 
is expensive and the radio resources in cellular networks are 
limited. In [1], it has been proposed to handle the local peer-
to-peer traffic in a reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient 
manner by enabling direct Device-to-Device (D2D) 
communication as an underlay to the International Mobile 
Telecommunications-Advanced (IMT-A) cellular network. 
In D2D communication, users communicate directly with 
each other or via multi-hop without the intervention of the 
mBS. The spectrum utilization is improved in D2D 
communication as the D2DRs share the same resource with 
macro UEs (mUEs). However, when sharing spectrum with 
mUEs for data transmission, D2D links may generate high

Interference management in LTE-Advance network with 
D2D communication is a critical issue. This kind of 
interference may become even more complex when having 
great number of D2D pairs across different cells networks 
[4]. Fig. 1 provides an example of such an interference 
scenario. For example, there exists an interference from the 
D2D sender (D2DS) to the mUE (known as inter-tier 
interference) as indicated by the dashed red arrow.  
In this paper, we propose a partial co-channel based 
overlap resource power control (PC.OVER) scheme aiming 
to mitigate the co-channel interference between mUEs and 
D2DR. In low D2DR density, the mUE use any of the 
available resource block (RB) while the D2DR is restricted 
to use a portion of the available resources depending on 
resource allocation ratio (RAR) and use high power for its 
transmission. In high D2DR density, where more than one 
D2DRs compete for the same resource with mUE, the power 
for those D2DRs which compete for the RB with mUE is 
reduced to low power,   . We also consider the spectrum 
sharing strategies. The simulation results show that there is a 
significant increase in overall system throughput and the 
system outage was reduced.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II describes the system model. Section III studies the 
interference scenarios and proposed scheme. In Section IV, 
three performance measurement indicators have been 
evaluated as the measurement for our system performance.

SYSTEM MODEL 
A. System Topology 
 
As shown in Fig. 2, we consider a system topology 
with 7 hexagonal macrocells where the inter-site distance is 
𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 designated in meters (m). We assume that each mBS 
is located at the center of each macrocell and has cell 
identification (ID).  mBS denotes an mBS with cell ID = i is 
described as 𝑚𝐵𝑆𝑖 . mUEs and D2DSs are randomly 
deployed in the macrocell coverage and are stationary. Then, 
D2DRs are separated from their corresponding D2DSs with 
distance q, where q is uniform random variable in [1, 20] m. 
The target cell is the center macrocell, 𝑚𝐵𝑆1 , and 
interfering neighbor mBSs to mUEs and D2DSs in each cell 
site of 𝑚𝐵𝑆1. 
The physical frame structures in our D2D network is the 
OFDMA frequency division duplex (FDD). The length of 
each frame is 10ms and a frame consists of 10 sub-frames. 
Also, each sub-frame has two slots (a slot is 0.5ms) and each 
sub channel per slot is the unit of RB [5]. However, in this 
paper we named it as a sub-channel per symbol RB. The 
numbers of sub-channels and symbols are S and Z, 
respectively. 
We define RAR, α, between the mBS and D2DSs as 
 
 
 
 
Full frequency bandwidth of the total system bandwidth 
is allocated to mUE, while D2DS bandwidth depends on the 
RAR (RAR=0.2).

shown in (3) and (4).  
The path-loss is modeled according to the micro-urban 
models ITU-R report [6]. We apply different path-loss 
models to D2DRs and mUEs as given in (3) and (4) [7]. The 
path-losses of the micro-urban models for D2DRs

INTERFERENCE SCENARIOS AND PROPOSED SCHEME 
A. Interference Scenarios for D2D Networks 
As shown in Fig. 3, we consider two types of interference 
that occur in a two-tier (Inter-tier and Intra-tier) D2D 
network architecture. Inter-tier type of interference occurs 
among network elements that belong to the same tier in the 
network. In the case of a D2D network, Inter-tier 
interference occurs between neighboring D2D links. Intra-

tier type of interference occurs among network elements that 
belong to the different tiers of the network, i.e., interference 
between D2D links and macrocells. 
D2D links are deployed over the existing macrocell 
network and share the same frequency spectrum with 
macrocells. Due to spectral scarcity, the D2D links and 
macrocells have to reuse the total allocated frequency band 
partially or totally, which leads to inter-tier or co-channel 
interference. At the same time, in order to guarantee the 
required QoS to the mUEs, D2DRs should occupy as little 
bandwidth as possible that leads to intra-tier interference. As 
a result, the throughput of the network would decrease 
substantially due to such inter-tier and intra-tier interference.  
Fig. 3 illustrates all possible interference scenarios in an 
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) 
based D2D network. If an effective interference management 
scheme can be adopted, then the inter-tier interference can be 
mitigated and the intra-tier interference can be reduced 
which would enhance the throughput of the overall network. 
B. Proposed Resource Allocation Schemes 
The primary goal of this paper is to enhance throughput 
for both mUE and D2DRs. One way to achieve this is to 
mitigate interference. In partial co-channel scheme called PC 
scheme, the mUE transmits in any of the available RB from 
any of the 50 RBs as showed in Fig. 4(a). The D2DR is 
restricted to transmit data in the RB depending on the 
RAR[8]. 
  The PC scheme can be applied to the mitigation of co-
channel interference when D2DRs are deployed in a 
systematic way with low density. However, when multiple 
mUEs and D2DRs are densely deployed, i.e., having more 
than one user need to access of the same RB, PC scheme will

create serious co-channel interference. To solve this problem 
PC.OVER scheme is proposed to mitigate the interference. 
In this scheme, the mUE transmits in any of the available RB 
from those 50 RBs as in PC scheme. The difference is only 
for the D2D case when we have more than one D2DRs 
compete for the same RB with the mUE as shown in Fig. 4 
(b). The co-channel interference in such kind of situation is 
severe. Allowing D2DRs to transmit data with their high 
power will even worsen the interference. To avoid this and 
further mitigate the interference, for those RBs where more 
than one D2DRs compete for the same resource with mUE, 
the power for the competing D2DRs is reduced to low power 
   ) (Fig. 4 (b)). Note that where there is no D2DR 
competition, we have normal collision as indicated in the red 
colored RBs. Fig. 5 shows the procedure of how mBSs 
allocate the RB to D2DRs in the proposed scheme.  
 
 
 
IV. 
 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT 
In this section, the system performance is measured. The 
detailed explanations of the performance measures used to 
evaluate the system are described as follows:  
A.  SINR  Model 
The SINR model is defined as the ratio of a signal power 
to the interference power for the b-th RB in the a-th sub-
channel,      . We assume that X mBSs are placed in a 
given area and Y D2DSs are deployed in each macrocell’s 
coverage. Also, L mUEs are serviced by each mBS and F 
D2DRs are serviced by each D2DS.

the i-th macrocell coverage, respectively.  
 
The SINR of the 𝑚𝑈𝐸𝑖 𝑚 for the 𝑅𝐵𝑎 𝑏, 𝛾𝑚𝑈𝐸𝑖 𝑚

are binary values are 1 or 0 if 𝑚𝐵𝑆𝑥  is in the group of 
interfering neighbor mBSs for the m-th mUE and the 𝑅𝐵𝑎 𝑏 
is used by the neighbor mBSs or D2DSs, respectively.

V. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
We investigate the DL performance of the proposed 
resource allocation scheme using a Monte Carlo simulation. 
We performed 10,000 independent simulations and evaluated 
system performance according to the number of mUEs in the 
analysis. The values of X, S, Z, Y, L, and F are 7, 5, 10, 10~ 
200, 30, and 1, respectively. We assume that the mBS and 
D2DSs allocate only one RB for each mUE and D2DR, 
respectively. The mBS does not allocate the same RBs to 
mUEs in the same cell but D2DSs allocate randomly one RB 
in allocated channel groups for each D2DR. Log-normal 
shadow fading is considered with zero mean and standard 
deviations of 8dB for the link between the mBS and mUEs, 
and 9dB for the link between the D2DS and D2DRs but 
multi-path fading is not considered. Table 1 gives the key 
parameters.

scheme. The system was evaluated and compared with the 
conventional scheme where radio resources are randomly 
selected. 200 D2D pairs were deployed in the region of 30 
mUEs. Four cases are considered: consider having only 
mUEs (w/oD2D), mUEs and D2DRs are randomly allocate

Fig. 6 shows the system throughput of mUEs for the 
increasing number of D2DRs per 30 mUEs. Only the DL 
was simulated. There are several factors that contribute to the 
throughput variations between the schemes. Since the 
resources are randomly selected, the throughput for the 
conventional scheme decreases as the number of D2DR 
increases. For wD2D PC, there is improvement in system 
throughput. Though there exist interference between mUE 
and D2DR for those resources shared by mUE and D2DRs 
(collision areas), the system throughput is improved because 
the D2DR transmits only in RBs allocated by RAR. The 
throughput is further improved in our proposed scheme. This 
is due to the fact that our scheme avoided further generation 
of interference by reducing the power of D2DRs competing 
for the resources with either another D2DR or mUE. 
Proposed scheme shows better performance than other 
scheme by mitigating interference between D2DRs and mBS 
relaying mUE. 
 Fig. 7 shows the results of D2DRs system throughput 
that increases linearly, as the number of D2Ds increases. Due 
to RB exclusion, D2Ds’s available RB is less than that of PC 
scheme and Conventional Scheme; thus, there is a decrease 
of D2DRs system throughput.  
Figs. 8 and 9 show the outage probability for the mUEs 
and D2DRs respectively. In Fig. 8, comparing with 
conventional scheme, there is a slight decrease in outage in 
wD2D PC. Unlike in conventional scheme, the users in 
wD2D are uniformly distributed which in turn reduces the 
outage. The outage is further reduced in the wD2D PC. 
OVER scheme as the users are uniformly distributed and that 
the D2DRs use low power for data transmission when more 
than one D2DRs compete for the same RB with mUE. PC. 
OVER scheme are largely mitigates the interference from 
D2DRs. The resources also are well utilized in PC.OVER 
scheme.

In Fig. 9, the outage probability of PC.OVER scheme is 
generally higher than conventional and PC schemes. The 
high outage is due to the decrease of the power of the D2DSs 
which may cause some of the D2DRs to be denied of the 
services. There is a tradeoff between the system throughput 
and the outage. Since the system shows significant 
throughput improvement in mUEs, we still have a strong 
believe that our proposed scheme performs better than the 
conventional scheme and PC scheme.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We have studied interference mitigation using partial co-
channel based overlap resource power control scheme in 
LTE-Advance D2D networks. The impact of D2D 
interference on capacity was investigated. In this paper, we 
presented a PC.OVER Scheme for D2D outage and 
throughput. Simulation results showed that the proposed 
schemes outperform D2D networks in terms of system 
throughput and outage probability for mUEs and D2DRs. 
Inter-cell interference is one of the key problems for D2D 
networks. Thus, in future, we plan to study the improved 
resource 
allocation 
scheme 
considering 
Tx 
power 
management and the efficiency frequency planning of 
D2DSs to enhance system performance in future works.
