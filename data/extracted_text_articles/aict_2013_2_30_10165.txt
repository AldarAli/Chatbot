Abstract— In this paper, we have proposed the novel 
demodulation scheme of M-FSK (M-ary Frequency Shift 
Keying) signal on MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) 
frequency selective channels. As for this demodulation scheme, 
there exists almost no investigation except a few reports. The 
proposed scheme uses FDE (Frequency Domain Equalization) 
and ISI (Inter-Symbol Interference) canceller plus MLD 
(Maximum Likelihood Detection). We further reduced the 
BER by using iterative feedback of detected results. The 
novelty in this paper is the integration of those techniques for 
detecting MIMO M-FSK signal. Through computer simulation, 
we have verified that the proposed scheme using FDE and ISI 
canceller plus MLD with iterative feedback exhibits the 
excellent BER characteristics compared with previously 
reported FDE detector.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
M-FSK signal has the constant envelope property and is 
appropriate to be amplified by nonlinear amplifier with high 
power efficiency. However, as M-FSK is a nonlinear 
modulation scheme, the equalization at the receiver side has 
been difficult when it is subjected to frequency selective 
channels. On the other side, due to the increasing demand 
of high data rate and reliable data transmission, MIMO 
schemes with multiple transmit and receive antennas 
become quite popular recently. The conventional MIMO 
scheme processes the received signals using linear matrix 
processing. However it has been difficult to apply the linear 
processing to the nonlinear modulation such as MIMO 
M-FSK, and accordingly there was almost no research on 
MIMO M-FSK signaling. So, we aimed to develop the 
MIMO M-FSK transmission scheme and examine its BER.

We had already shown that the FDE (Frequency Domain 
Equalization) scheme using CP (Cyclic Prefix) [1] is 
applicable to the signal separation and equalization of 
MIMO M-FSK signals [2]-[4], where the FDE is done 
before the demodulation process of M-FSK signal. This 
method was originally developed for SISO (Single Input 
Single Output) FSK signals [5]. In [6], we developed the 
detection scheme using ISI canceller and MLD to further 
improve the BER. In that scheme, the ISI’s caused by the 
past symbols already detected were cancelled by ISI 
canceller, but the ISI cancellation caused by the future 
symbols and the separation of spatially multiplexed signals 
of MIMO transmission were achieved by MLD. This leads 
to the complexity of MLD of 
M KnT
 where M  is the 
modulation level (number of symbols) of M-FSK, 
s
KT  the 
maximum symbol delay time of multipath waves, 
sT  the 
symbol duration and 
Tn  the number of transmit antennas. 
As the complexity of MLD grows exponentially with the 
increase of K  and 
Tn , the realization of this detector 
looks quite difficult even though using M-algorithm instead 
of MLD [6]. In this paper, in order to improve the BER 
characteristics of the FDE detector [2]-[4] and reduce the 
complexity of the detector in [6], we propose the novel 
demodulator structure in which the FDE is firstly done to 
obtain the tentative decision results. Using the tentative 
decision results, the ISI replicas due to the transmit symbols 
other than the desired symbol are cancelled form the receive 
signal. If the cancellation is perfect, we can obtain the 
receive signal as if only the desired symbol is transmitted. 
Then the MLD is applied to the receive signal to separate 
the IAI (Inter-Antenna Interference) of MIMO transmission. 
At this stage the output of MLD is regarded as the decision 
results of 0-th iteration. Then the 0-th decision results are 
fed back to the ISI canceller and again used as the tentative 
decision results for ISI cancellation. The ISI cancelled 
receive signal is then fed to the MLD again. This iterative 
processing is repeated and results in the better BER 
convergence. The basic structure of the above iteration 
receiver was developed in [7],[8] for the linear SC (Single 
Carrier)-FDE signals. In the proposed MIMO M-FSK 
demodulator, the complexity of MLD is proportional to 
M nT
 which does not depend on the ISI symbol length of 
K  and this greatly reduces the complexity of detector 
enabling the detector for actual implementation.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the FDE 
receiver for MIMO M-FSK is described and simulated. In 
Section III, the proposed detector with FDE and ISI 
canceller plus MLD is introduced. In Section IV, the BER 
results of proposed demodulator through computer 
simulation are shown. In Section V, the complexity of 
detector is described. The paper concludes with Section VI. 
 
II. MIMO M-FSK DETECTION USING FDE 
 
In Fig.1 we show the transmitter and receiver block 
diagram for MIMO M-FSK when using the FDE at the 
receiver. At the transmitter, the data bits are M-FSK 
modulated and CP is added to the transmit symbol block 
like Fig.2 with the block length of 
n
s
T
= nT
 where n  is 
the number of symbols in a block and 
sT  is the symbol 
duration. From each antenna, the symbol block is 
transmitted. At the receiver, after the removal of CP, the 
received baseband I and Q signals are sampled at the 
sampling frequency of 
1/
sf
t
=
∆
 where 
∆t
 is the 
sampling interval, 
sT
c t
= ∆  and c  is the integer number. 
The value of c  is taken large enough to satisfy the 
sampling theorem and not to make aliasing for the received 
analog I and Q signals. 
The power spectral densities of continuous phase M-FSK 
signals are shown in Fig.3. 
As a block length 
n
s
T
= nT
 contains cn  samples, the 
number of FFT points becomes N
= cn
. The sampled 
complex discrete time signals (
),
1,
,
p

 are 
then FFT-transformed and the FDE based on MMSE 
criterion is performed at each frequency point. As the result 
of FDE, the ISI compensation and the signal separation of 
spatially multiplexed signals are made simultaneously. Then 
the frequency domain samples are IFFT-transformed and 
the time domain discrete samples are obtained.

These samples are equivalent to analogue M-FSK signals, 
because the sampling interval of 
t
∆  is taken small enough. 
The time domain samples are fed to the ordinary M-FSK 
detector. In this study, we employed a non-coherent energy 
detector as the M-FSK detector, because it is easy to 
implement and it does not need the phase synchronization 
[9]. In the energy detection of M-FSK signals, total M 
energy detectors are used, i.e., each energy detector for each 
frequency. The energy detectors for M-FSK are shown in 
Fig.4.

computer simulation condition is shown in Table I. The 
delay profile between each transmit and receive antenna is 
illustrated in Fig.5. The BER results are shown in Fig.6.

improved as the value of M increases from 2FSK, 4FSK, 
8FSK to 16FSK. This improvement is due to the bandwidth 
expansion of M-FSK signal with larger M value. Due to the 
FDE, the diversity order, i.e., the gradient of BER curve, is 
the same among 1 1
×
, 2
× 2
 and 4
× 4
. This is also 
observed in MIMO OFDM with FDE. Accordingly, we can 
say that the multi-stream MIMO transmission is available 
for M-FSK through the FDE receiver. 
 
III. ITERATIVE DETECTION OF MIMO M-FSK USING 
FDE AND ISI CANCELLER PLUS MLD 
 By using the equalization and signal separation with FDE 
and energy detector, the demodulation of MIMO M-FSK 
signal can be achieved. However, the BER characteristic of 
FDE receiver is not enough and we aim to obtain further 
BER improvement. In order to do this, we consider the 
decision results from FDE as the tentative decision results. 
Using the tentative decision results, the ISI replica at the 
receiver is generated and is subtracted from the receive 
signal. If the tentative decision results from FDE are correct, 
we can cancel the ISI and obtain the receive signal as if 
only transmit symbols at desired time k  are transmitted 
from 
Tn  transmit antennas. For this receive signal, the 
separation of spatially multiplexing is done using MLD. 
Then we consider the outputs of MLD as the reliability 
enhanced decision results and use them as the evolved 
tentative decision results. Using the evolved results, the 
new ISI replicas are generated and again subtracted from 
the receive signal to cancel the ISI. After this ISI 
cancellation, the MLD is again employed to separate the 
spatial multiplex. This iterative processing is repeated to 
improve the BER for each iteration. The above iterative 
procedure algorithm was originally reported in [7] for 
MIMO SC-FDE receiver. 
 In Fig.7, the transmitter and receiver block diagram is 
shown for this iterative demodulator. At the transmitter, 
M-FSK symbols with the block length of 
s
nT  are 
generated and the CP with the length of 
cCP
t
∆  is added at 
the head of the block. Each block with CP is transmitted 
from each antenna. At the receiver, after removing the CP, 
the equalization and signal separation are firstly done 
through FDE and the tentative decision results are obtained. 
Those tentative decision results are fed to the ISI canceller 
and the replica for ISI cancellation is generated. The 
replicas are made in order to cancel the ISI’s caused by the 
total 2K  transmit symbols before and after the desired 
symbol at time k . Accordingly, in making the ISI replica, 
the transmit symbol at time k  in the tentative decision 
results is set to zero. By subtracting the ISI replica from the 
receive signal, the ISI components due to the transmit 
symbols before and after the transmit symbol at time k  
are cancelled. If the tentative decision results are correct, 
we can get the receive signal as if the symbols at time k  
are only transmitted from antenna 1
 Tn
 with spatially 
multiplex. Then in order to separate the spatial multiplex, 
the MLD is applied to the ISI cancelled receive signal and 
the decision results at time k  are obtained. The new 
decision results at time k  are sequentially fed back to the 
ISI canceller and the decision time is evolved from k  to 
(
k +1)
. After obtaining all the decision results for n  
symbols, those decision results for n  symbols are replaced

replica, all the transmit symbols other than at time k  are

 The decision result 
1x (0)
 of MLD in (6) is regarded as the 
new tentative decision result and is fed back to the ISI 
canceller to detect the 2nd symbol in a block at time 
k = 2
. 
Next, for the 2nd symbol, the ISI cancellation and MLD are 
executed and the decision result of 
x2(0)
 is obtained. Then 
x2(0)
 is regarded as the new tentative decision result and is 
fed back to the ISI canceller for determining the 3rd symbol 
x3(0)
. Those sequential feedback procedure is repeated up to 
the n-th symbol in a block. The obtained decision results for 
all the n symbols in a block are regarded as the block 
decision results, which is again fed back to the ISI canceller 
and the subsequent MLD processing is done. This feedback 
of block decision results is repeated I  times and the final 
decision results are obtained. 
 
IV. 
SIMULATION 
RESULTS 
OF 
ITERATIVE 
DETECTION RECEIVER FOR MIMO M-FSK 
 Computer simulations are made to verify the BER 
improvement of iterative receiver. The simulation condition 
is listed in Table III. The delay profile is the same as in 
Fig.5. The BER results are shown in Fig.9 to Fig.14. 
 From Fig.9~14, we observe that the BER characteristics of 
“FDE and ISI canceller plus MLD” receiver with iterative 
detection are better than “FDE” receiver. We also see the 
BER is improved as the number I  of iterative feedbacks 
increases. 
I = 4
(#4) is enough for the BER convergence, 
where the MLD is repeated five times for a block.

V. COMPARISON OF COMPLEXITY OF RECEIVER 
STRUCTURE 
 We compared the complexity between the receiver with 
“FDE” and the one with “FDE and ISI canceller plus MLD.” 
The complexity is compared as the number of complex 
additions and multiplications required for detecting one 
symbol of FSK. The equations for calculating the 
complexity are given in Table IV, where we assume

. We also show the numerical results of 
complexity in Fig.15 and Fig.16. From those results, we 
know that the complexity of FDE receiver is far less than 
the “FDE and ISI canceller plus MLD” receiver. For the 
FDE receiver, the complexity gradually increases as the 
number of symbols n  in a FFT block becomes large, but 
does not depend on the delay time parameter L  of 
multipath. On the other hand, for the “FDE and ISI 
canceller plus MLD” receiver, we observe that the 
complexity increases as L  becomes large, but does not 
depend on the number of symbols n  in a block.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
 In this study, we have proposed the new receiver structure 
for M-FSK signal on frequency selective MIMO channels. 
In addition to the FDE receiver which was proposed 
previously, we demonstrated the novel receiver structure in 
which the ISI components are firstly cancelled by the 
tentative decision results obtained by FDE and then the 
MLD is employed to separate the spatial multiplexing.

The proposed receiver improves the BER with the iterative 
feedback of decision results. The BER characteristics of 
proposed iterative receiver are improved very much when 
compared with the conventional FDE receiver. By using the  
tentative decision results obtained from the FDE, the 
complexity of MLD in the proposed iterative receiver does 
not depend on the transmit block length and becomes 
modest, while the high quality separation of spatially 
multiplexed signals that comes from MLD is maintained. 
As future studies, instead of known channel state 
information (CSI) at the receiver, the measured CSI will be 
employed and the features of MIMO M-FSK comparing 
with existing linear modulations should be clarified.
