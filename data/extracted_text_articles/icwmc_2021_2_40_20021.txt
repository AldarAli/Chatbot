Abstract—In this paper, we present a time-domain coexistence 
technique to operate small cells of a Fifth-Generation (5G) New 
Radio (NR) operator in the 60 GHz band with the access points 
(APs) of an IEEE 802.11ad/ay, also termed as Wireless Gigabit 
(WiGig), operator located within a multistory building. Small cells 
are dual-band enabled operating in the 60 GHz unlicensed and 28 
GHz licensed bands. Moreover, we assume that small cells are not 
Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) feature enabled. Hence, to avoid 
blocking the transmission of APs of the WiGig operator, an 
interference avoidance scheme is developed in the time-domain 
that divides the air time in the 60 GHz band between the 
incumbent WiGig APs (WiAPs) and 5G NR Unlicensed (NR-U) 
small cells.  We derive average capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), 
and Energy Efficiency (EE) metrics for 5G NR-U small cells. With 
system-level simulation results, the average capacity, SE, and EE 
responses for three variants of the 5G NR, namely 5G NR 
Standalone, 5G NR-U Standalone, and 5G NR-U Anchored are 
evaluated. It has been shown that NR-U Anchored can achieve the 
maximum average capacity and EE, whereas NR-U Standalone 
can achieve the maximum SE when coexisting with a WiGig 
operator. Because the 60 GHz unlicensed band is present in both 
schemes, this signifies the importance of operating a 5G NR 
operator in the unlicensed bands.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Introduction of the Fifth-Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) 
to serve a large volume of data traffic has increased the burden 
on the licensed spectrum of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) 
[1]. An effective solution to address this problem is to serve 
data traffic in the unlicensed bands along with the existing 
licensed bands. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 
has recently taken initiatives to operate cellular networks in the 
unlicensed bands with the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [2]. 
However, technologies such as the IEEE 802.11 based WiFi 
have already been in operation globally over a wide range of 
unlicensed bands, including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 60 GHz 
bands [3]. This necessitates developing a technique that can 
allow both cellular networks and incumbent WiFi networks to 
coexist.  
      So far now, several research studies have addressed WiFi 
and cellular network coexistence such as LTE and 5G NR. For 
example, the authors in [4] addressed the coexistence of 5G NR 
Unlicensed (NR-U) and WiFi in the 6 GHz band, and in [5], the 
authors addressed the coexistence of WiFi with the beam based 
5G NR-U in the millimeter-wave (mmW) bands. Moreover, in 
[1], by implementing a mode selection procedure in 5G NR, the 
authors investigated the coexistence performance of the 5G 
NR-U and WiFi networks. Moreover, to address the 
coexistence between WiFi and cellular systems, several studies 
proposed to apply the Almost Blank Subframe (ABS) based 
Enhanced 
Intercell 
Interference 
Coordination 
(eICIC) 
technique. For example, using the concept of ABS, the authors 
in [6] proposed a scheme to coexist LTE with WiFi systems in 
an unlicensed band. Similarly, the authors in [7] proposed the 
LTE muting mechanism to mute the transmission of LTE in a 
certain number of subframes of every 5 subframes during which 
the channel can be used by WiFi users. Furthermore, an ABS-
based coexistence scheme to avoid co-channel interference 
between small cells and WiFi systems was presented by the 
authors in [8].  
      However, to operate in unlicensed bands, certain regulatory 
requirements, for example, using Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) 
and transmission power limits, are needed to be maintained [3]. 
Hence, to address the transmission power requirement in the 
unlicensed bands, 5G NR-U is expected to be operated in the 
small cells deployed indoors. In this regard, 60 GHz unlicensed 
band is considered an attractive unlicensed band for NR-U [5] 
[9] due to its wider contiguous bandwidth availability.  This 
implies that NR-U will aggregate the licensed 28 GHz or 38 
GHz spectrum and the 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum [9]. 
However, studies on the NR-U operating in both the licensed 
and unlicensed mmW spectra for in-building small cells are in 
the early stage, and detailed analysis and evaluation of major 
performance metrics, including capacity, Spectral Efficiency 
(SE), and Energy Efficiency (EE), for NR-U is yet to be 
addressed, which we aim to contribute in this paper.  
In line with so, we derive and evaluate average capacity, SE, 
and EE responses of in-building 5G NR-U small cells that are 
considered coexisting with the IEEE 802.11ad/ay, also termed 
as Wireless Gigabit (WiGig), where each small cell operates in 
both the 28 GHz licensed and the 60 GHz unlicensed bands. In 
doing so, we present a time-domain coexistence technique to 
avoid co-channel interference by modifying the concept of 
ABS. A system-level performance analysis is carried out for a 
number of variants of 5G NR, including 5G NR Standalone 
operating only in the 28 GHz band, 5G NR-U Standalone 
operating only in the 60 GHz band, and 5G NR-U Anchored 
operating in both the 28 GHz and 60 GHz bands.   
We organize the paper as follows. in Section II, system 
architecture and time-domain coexistence techniques are 
discussed. In Section III, we derive average capacity, SE, and 
EE metrics for each variant of 5G NR-U. In Section IV, we

capacity, SE and EE by varying the amount of transmission 
time of small cells under each variant of 5G NR-U. We

II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND TIME-DOMAIN COEXISTENCE 
Figure 1 shows the system architecture consisting of a 5G 
NR-U operator and a WiGig operator. Each NR-U operator has 
three types of base stations (BSs), namely macrocell BSs 
(MBSs), picocell BSs (PBSs), and small cell BSs (SBSs). We 
assume that all SBSs and WiGig Access Points (APs) are 
deployed only within a building, one per apartment per operator. 
An SBS or a WiGig Access Point (WiAP) serves only one User 
Equipment (UE) at a time. Each SBS is dual-band enabled such 
that the 28 GHz licensed band operates at its transceiver 1, and 
the 60 GHz unlicensed band operates at its transceiver 2. Note 
that each WiAP operates at the 60 GHz band. Moreover, we 
assume that any MBS or any PBS of the NR-U operates in the 
2 GHz band.   
Since both SBSs and WiAPs operate in the 60 GHz 
unlicensed band, co-channel interference is generated. To 
coexist both SBSs and WiAPs in the 60 GHz unlicensed band, 
we present the following coexistence technique. An SBS can 
share the 60 GHz spectrum with an incumbent WiAP by 
allocating them in different time slots to avoid simultaneous 
access by either the SBS or the WiAP to the 60 GHz spectrum 
using the well-established concept termed as ABS in LTE. We 
consider modifying ABSs to avoid transmitting control signals 
as well during ABSs resulting in Fully Blank Subframes (FBSs) 
as shown in Figure 2.  
An optimal amount of time to transmit data by NR-U 
operator in terms of Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs) can be 
defined by considering the average number of UEs of each 
operator over a certain time period T. According to [10], the 
arrival process of UEs of NR-U and WiGig operators can be 
assumed to follow the Poisson processes with a mean 
1
 and 
2

, respectively, over T. An optimum value of the number of FBSs 
(which is strictly a positive integer) over an FBS pattern period 
(FPP) TFPP of 5G NR-U operator can be obtained as follows.

Since UEs of different Radio Access Technologies (RATs) 
are allocated orthogonally in the time-domain, i.e., in different 
TTIs, no collision from simultaneous transmissions from UEs 
of both RATs occurs. Moreover, cellular technologies use a 
centralized scheduling-based approach to transmit continuously 
without sensing the channel status such that, based on the 
values of 
1
 and 
2
 over T, an effective allocation of FBSs 
using (1) can be performed for UEs of both NR-U and WiGig 
operators. Furthermore, (1) can be generalized for any arbitrary 
number of NR-U and WiGig operators, which we show in 
Appendix I. In general, an increase in the number of active 
operators, either NR-U or WiGig, causes a corresponding 
decrease in the number of subframes allocated to each operator 
for a given TFPP and vice versa.   
Remark 1: The value of TFPP plays a significant role in the 
allocation of subframes to each operator. If TFPP is less than the 
total number of NR-U and WiGig operators, there would be a 
high probability that one or more operators might not get 
scheduled over each TFPP. This problem would get worsen if all 
operators are active over any TFPP, particularly, for delay-
sensitive traffic. Hence, to ensure that each active NR-U, as 
well as WiGig, operator is scheduled in every TFPP to address 
the delay-sensitive traffic, it is recommended that the value of 
TFPP should be chosen such that each active operator is 
scheduled at least once per TFPP, i.e., TFPP (in terms of TTIs) 
should be at least equal to the sum of the number of NR-U and 
WiGig operators. As a general rule, a higher value of TFPP with 
respect to the total number of operators results in a better 
performance in subframe allocations to NR-U and WiGig 
operators.

       Due to a short distance between a UE and its SBS and a 
low transmission power of an SBS, we assume similar indoor

It is to be noted that for the SE estimation, only the licensed 
spectra, i.e., 2 GHz and 28 GHz spectra, of the NR-U operator 
are considered due to paying the licensing fee by the respective 
operator to use these bands. Now, 5G NR Standalone and 5G 
NR-U Standalone operate only in the licensed and unlicensed 
bands, respectively. The system-level average capacity for NR 
Standalone and NR-U Standalone can be expressed,

Figure 3.  Average capacity, spectral efficiency and, energy efficiency responses of small cells of a single operator of 5G NR Standalone (Std), 5G NR-U Std, and 
5G NR-U Anchored (Anch) with the variation of the number of FBSs (i.e., its transmission time) per FPP, including 50% and 75% of FPP, which coexists with a 
single WiGig operator in a building of small cells. (a) average capacity, (b) spectral efficiency, and (c) energy efficiency. 
We vary the transmission time (i.e., the number of allocated 
FBSs) per FPP (including 50% and 75% of FPP) of small cells 
of a 5G NR operator coexisting with a single WiGig operator 
within a building. Figure 3 shows the average capacity, SE, and 
EE responses for three variants of the 5G NR operator, namely 
5G NR Standalone, 5G NR-U Standalone, and 5G NR-U 
Anchored (Anch), which can be summarized as follows. 
 
Since 5G NR Standalone operates only in the 28 GHz 
licensed spectrum, which is allocated exclusively to it only, 
no changes in capacity, SE, and EE occur with a change in 
the number of FBSs over an FPP. 
 
 
Since 5G NR-U Standalone operates only in the 60 GHz 
unlicensed spectrum, which is shared as well by the WiGig 
operator, the capacity, SE, and EE responses increase with 
an increase in the transmission time from 50% FPP to 75% 
FPP due to having more time to transmit by the small cells.  
 
 
Since 5G NR-U Anchored operates both in the 28 GHz 
licensed spectrum, as well as in the 60 GHz unlicensed 
spectrum, with an increase in the transmission time, the 
average capacity response increases more than that of NR 
Standalone, as well as NR-U Standalone, operators due to 
operating in both the 28 GHz licensed and the 60 GHz 
unlicensed spectra. However, SE is a function of both 
achievable capacity and system bandwidth. Particularly, 
though SE is directly proportional to the achievable 
capacity, it is also inversely proportional to the effective 
licensed spectrum as given by (8). Due to this reason, SE 
for the 5G NR-U Anchored does not improve 
proportionately with its achievable capacity as the 
transmission time increases from 50% FPP to 75% FPP. 
Rather, 5G NR-U Standalone achieves the maximum SE 
due to requiring the least amount of the effective licensed 
spectrum. However, since EE is a function of transmission 
energy (Joule/bit), as well as achievable capacity (bits/s), 
the increase in the achievable capacity due to increasing 
the transmission time from 50% FPP to 75% FPP is 
significant enough to exceed the increase in the 
transmission energy for the NR-U Anchored as given by 
(9) in the same duration. This results in the minimum 
average energy required per bit transmission for the NR-U

achieve the maximum SE when coexisting with a WiGig 
operator.  Because in NR-U standalone, as well as NR-U 
Anchored, the 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum plays a role, this 
implies the importance of operating the 5G NR operator in the 
unlicensed bands.    
V. CONCLUSION 
     In this paper, we have presented a time-domain coexistence 
technique for small cells of a 5G NR located within a building 
to coexist with a WiGig operator in the 60 GHz band. Each 
small cell has been considered dual-band enabled, operating in 
both the 60 GHz unlicensed and 28 GHz licensed bands. 
Because each small cell has not been considered Listen-Before-
Talk (LBT) feature enabled, to avoid complete blockage of the 
transmission of WiGig Access Points (APs), an interference 
avoidance scheme has been proposed in the time-domain to 
divide the air time in the 60 GHz band between the incumbent 
WiGig APs (WiAPs) and small cells.  We have derived average 
capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Energy Efficiency (EE) 
performance metrics for in-building small cells of the NR-U. 
With system-level simulation results, by varying the number of 
allocated FBSs per FPP the 5G NR operator, the average 
capacity, SE, and EE responses for three variants of the 5G NR, 
namely 5G NR Standalone, 5G NR-U Standalone, and 5G NR-
U Anchored (Anch) have been evaluated. It has been shown 
that NR-U Anchored can achieve the maximum average 
capacity and EE, whereas NR-U Standalone can achieve the 
maximum SE when coexisting with a WiGig operator. Because 
the 60 GHz unlicensed band is present in both schemes, this 
signifies the importance of operating a 5G NR operator in the 
unlicensed bands.
