Abstract—In this work, new results are obtained using con-
structed probabilistic representation of the ﬁrst boundary value
problem for polyharmonic equation. It is shown that correspond-
ing solution is presented by the parametric derivative of a solution
to the specially constructed Dirichlet problem for Helmholtz
equation. On this base, new algorithms of ’random walk by
spheres’ for solving biharmonic equations are derived.

I. INTRODUCTION
The deﬂection of thin plates under the action of loads is
satisﬁed an biharmonic equation with Dirichlet, Neumann,
or mixed boundary conditions [1]. Despite the slow rate of
convergence of statistical methods for low-dimensional spaces,
in comparison with classical numerical methods, their use
is advantageous in ﬁnding a solution to a small area or
for calculating the statistical characteristics of the solutions
with random right-hand sides. We can distinguish several ap-
proaches of Monte Carlo methods for solving above mentioned
problems:
• Approaches based on probabilistic representation of the
solution [3], [7], [5]
• Random walk by subdomains methods [8], [9], [10], [13]
(”by spheres” is most known)
• Random walk on boundary methods [13]
• SVD-based approaches [14]
Let us consider the pros and cons of each approach. The
methods based on probabilistic representation of the solution
are often used to ﬁnd the asymptotic properties of solutions.
These methods are difﬁcult to construct numerical algorithms
directly and estimates of the simpliﬁed approach are used.
This methods are more time-consuming in comparison with
others. More economical methods are walk by subdomains
and walk on boundary based on the reduction of the original
equation to a special integral equation with generalized kernel.
Walk on boundary methods are derived for a more restricted
range of problems, but can solve problems with complex
geometry boundaries. New SVD approach allows to construct
the most efﬁcient statistical methods for ﬁnding solutions of
linear equations approximated the original problem.
This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research
(grants N09-01-00639-a and N11-01-00252-a) and Novosibirsk State Univer-
sity
In this paper, we consider the biharmonic equation with ran-
dom inputs functional parameters. The walk by shperes vector
estimates of covariance for the solutions were constructed in
[6], the corresponding walk on boundary vector estimates were
suggested in [13], SVD approach was presented in [14].
Here, a new scalar walk by spheres estimates of covariance
for the solution were constructed by an parametric differentia-
tion of well known estimates of solution to special constructed
problems. First, this approach was proposed by G. Mikhailov
[12]. Besides, Mikhailov and Tolstolytkin [6] proposed scalar
estimates had been fully investigated: the ﬁniteness of vari-
ances has been proved, absolute errors have been evaluated,
laboriousness have been estimated, the problem of optimal
choice of method parameters to achieve a given error level
have been solved. Compared to [13][14] the offered method
can solve a problems with a random spectral parameter. It
seems that the approach by Sabelfeld and Mozartova [14] is
less time consuming, but a special comparison of methods was
not carried out.
We obtain estimates for the Dirichlet BVP and some special
Neumann BVP. Further investigation is aimed at building a
cost-effective methods for mixed and Neumann BVP.
This work is mostly theoretical. However, the proposed
estimates is easy to extend to the real problems with the own
geometry of the boundary.
A brief structure of the paper is presented below. Pre-
cise mathematical formulation of problems for theory of
ﬂuctuations of elastic systems and some auxiliary equations
are presented in Section II. General theoretical results for
polyharmonic equation, obtained with Mikhailov [4][5], are
presented in Section III. New results and model calculations
are considered in Section IV.
II. BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
A. Helmholtz equation
Let us consider the Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz
equation in a domain D ⊂ R3 with boundary Γ:
(∆ + c)u = −g,
u|Γ = φ.
(1)
Let us assume that the following conditions hold. The function
g satisﬁed Holder condition [2] in D, D is a bounded open set
in R3 with a regular boundary Γ, the function φ is continuous
on Γ, c < c∗, where −c∗ is the ﬁrst eigen value of Laplace

operator deﬁned on the domain D. These conditions provide
the existence and uniqueness of the solution to problem (1),
the existence its probabilistic and integral representations in
terms of the spherical Green’s function [2]. We suppose that
above conditions are fulﬁlled and after change of all parametric
functions by their modules.
B. Elastic BVP
In a domain D ∈ R2 with boundary Γ bending of thin elastic
plate satisﬁes the biharmonic equation [1]
∆2u = f(x, y)/K.
(2)
In case a plate is lying on an elastic foundation, we have the
following equation [1]
∆2u + cu = f(x, y)/K.
(3)
Here, u(x, y) is normal ﬂexure of a plate at the point (x, y);
f(x, y) is a strength of normal charge; K = Eh3/12(1−σ2),
where E is the elastic modulus; σ is the Poison constant for
the stuff of the plate; 2h is plate thickness. Let us consider
the following frequently occurring boundary conditions
• the edge of the plate is simply supported: u|Γ = 0,
∆u − 1−σ
ρ
∂u
∂n

Γ = 0;
• the edge of the plate is rigid: u|Γ = 0,

Γ = 0;
• the edge of the plate is elastically supported: u|Γ = 0,
∆u +
(
1−σ

+ k0
)
∂u
∂n

Γ = 0.
Here, n is the external normal to the boundary Γ of the plate;
ρ is curvature radius of Γ; k0 is a value related to a rigidity
of the edge ﬁxity.
C. Metaharmonic BVP
Let us consider the general problem:
{ (∆ + c)p+1u = −g,
(∆ + c)ku|Γ = φk,
k = 0, . . . , p.
(4)
In this work, the following results will be used [5].
Theorem 1. Let conditions of the part A are satisﬁed then

is the solution to the problem (4).
III. ALGORITHMS OF ’RANDOM WALKS BY SPHERES’
A. General algorithm
Further considered estimators of the Monte Carlo method
are associated with a ’random walks by spheres’ in the domain
D [8]. For simplicity, we designate: D is a closure of domain
D; d(P) is a distance from the point P to the boundary Γ;
Γε = {P ∈ D : d(P) < ε} is the ε-neighborhood of the
boundary; S(P) = {Q ∈ D : |Q − P| = d(P)} is a sphere
of radius d(P) with its center at the point P lying in D. In
the ’random walk by spheres’ we chose the successive Pk+1
uniformly on the sphere S(Pk); the walk is terminated if the
point Pk+1 occurs in Γε. Let N = min{m : rm ∈ Γε}.
It is well known [12] that solution to the problem (1)
satisﬁes the following equation u(r0) = E ηε in Rn, where
ηε =

(6)
Here, dj = d(rj), D(ri) is a ball of radius di with its center
at the point ri,
s(c, d) =
(d√c/2)(n−2)/2
Γ(n/2)J(n−2)/2(d√c),
(7)
G(ρ; c, d) is a spherical Green’s function, J(·) is a Bessel
function, Γ(·) is a Gamma function.
Therefore, using Theorem 1, we have following assertion
(all derivatives are considered at the point c = c0) [4].
Theorem 2. Under the conditions of Theorem 1 the follow-
ing representation holds true for the solution to the problem
(3) u = E( ∂η1,ε

Here, uk is a solution to the problem (4) with φ ≡ φk, k =
0, . . . , p, function g is equal to zero for k = 0, . . . , p − 1.

The following theorems hold true [4].
Theorem 4. If c < c∗ and ﬁrst spatial derivatives of the
function {u(i)
k }, i = 1, . . . , p+1, are uniformly bounded in ¯D
then |u(r) − E˜η(p)

r ∈ D, ε > 0.
Theorem 5. Under conditions of Theorem 4, for c < c∗/2
it holds, that
D˜η(p)

∀ε > 0.
In the expression of ˜η(p)

Suppose c is a random variable such that

The aim of this subsection is to estimate covariance function

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper the parametric differentiation approach has
been considered as an efﬁcient method for constructing scalar
’random walk by spheres’ estimates. This method is based
on parameter differentiation standard estimates of the solution
to the special constructed boundary value problem. Using
this approach and partial averaging method, ’random walk by
spheres’ estimates of covariance function were obtained for
the Dirichlet problems of the biharmonic equation. For testing
efﬁciency of this method, two examples for different types of
equations have been considered. The constructed algorithms
are particularly useful for estimating the covariance function
in the local domain. Another improvement is the need to store
only one trajectory of a random walk.
The developed algorithms ﬁnd practical application in the
theory of elasticity, discussed in Section 2. Problems with
random functional parameters are suitable in the study of
vibrations of plates under the action of random forces such
as the wind or earthquakes.
Future work will focus on the development of similar
algorithms for boundary value problems of the second and
third type. Additionally, it is supposed to develop ’random
walk by spheres’ algorithms for biharmonic equations where
spectral parameter is a random value with high dispersion and
non-zero expectation.
