Abstract—A filter bank divides the input signal into L 
bands having different passbands called unequal-
passbands-filter bank. This type of filter bank can be 
obtained in various ways, for example, from an equal-
passbands-bank in which the signals of each band are 
combined to produce new unequal-passbands. Recent 
results showed that the unequal-passbands scheme has 
superior performance over the equal-passbands scheme. 
In this paper, a new method showing a decrease in the 
number of taps in the separation stage of the blind 
source separation system is presented. Decreasing 
number of taps is necessary to decrease the complexity 
cost. The simulation results prove that the proposed 
technique improves the convergence using filter bank in 
octaves with decomposition which was observed for 
colored input that has low-pass characteristics. 
 
Keywords- Filter bank; multiband; convergence; adaptive 
filters; taps. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, some schemes for adaptive filtering were 
presented with the aim to accelerate the convergence to 
input signals correlated over time (color signals). In some 
cases, the aim was to reduce the computational cost, 
promoting the coefficients of the adaptive filters whose 
sampling rate is below that of the input signal. However, 
these schemes have an input-output delay and spectrum 
overlap between the various bands that should be reduced in 
advance promote adaptation of the filters [1].  Marelli and 
Minyue [2] proposed a scheme with maximum decimation 
able to make almost an exact modeling of the Finite Impulse 
Response (FIR) systems, through the insertion of cross 
filters and considering that there is spectrum overlapping 
between adjacent bands. In this case, both the input signal 
and the desired signal was decomposed into multiple bands, 
and the error generated in each band was used to update the 
respective adaptive filters (direct and crossed) related to the 
band. 
Papoulis and Stathaki [3] proposed two schemes of non-
maximally decimated (F < L) filter banks. As the effect of 
the overlapping spectrum is directly proportional to the 
decimation factor, the lower the value of F the smaller the 
minimum mean square error of the scheme. For fixed values 
of L and F, one can obtain optimum filter bank that 
minimizes the mean square error of the final scheme. The 
difference between the two proposed schemes is that the 
desired signal is decomposed into multiple bands, while the 
other one the final error of the scheme is decomposed. 
Two other schemes have been proposed by Lian and 
Wei [4] and Brown [5]. Papoulis and Stathaki [3] use 
analysis bank without decimation, followed by adaptive 
filters of nonzero coefficients, whereas Brown’s algorithm 
[4], which was derived from the first, uses a maximally 
decimated filter bank with perfect reconstruction and 
adaptive filters operate at reduced rate. 
New research presented by McCloud and Etter [6], and 
Kim and Choi [7], showed that the error in the scheme is 
decreased in adaptive filters with unequal-passbands in 
analogy to the equal-passbands. The unequal-passbands-
schemes presented in [6] employ noncritical decimation of 
the multi-band signals. In this work an unequal-passbands-
scheme with maximally decimated random bands is 
proposed. The contribution of this paper is derivation of the 
unequal-passbands maximally decimated scheme from 
unequal-passbands scheme without decimation, which 
employs analysis bank and filters with nonzero-coefficients 
that are used to construct an equivalent FIR system.  The rest 
of the paper is organized as follows: adaptive filter scheme 
without decimation is discussed in Section II, maximally 
decimated 
scheme 
with 
unequal-passbands 
and 
the 
extraction of the total number of taps used in the proposed 
scheme is presented in Section III, simulation results is 
discussed in Section IV and finally, the paper is concluded in 
Section V. 
II. ADAPTIVE SCHEMES WITHOUT DECIMATION 
The adaptive scheme is shown in Figure 1 and uses 
filters with nonzero coefficients that are capable of 
modeling only a particular class of FIR systems and cannot 
be generalized for all FIR systems because the length of 
analysis filters is greater than the number of adaptive 
coefficients. However, Apolibario and Alves [8] show that 
by a suitable selection of the filter, better parameters can be 
obtained to model the FIR system. We propose in Figure 1 a 
scheme that can model any FIR system but will include 
some delay.

III. MAXIMALLY DECIMATED SCHEME WITH UNEQUAL-
PASSBANDS  
An analysis filter bank of unequal-passbands can be 
configured from the adaptive scheme of unequal-passbands 
shown in Figure 1, but employs analysis filters bank with 
unequal-passbands. This scheme is shown in Figure 2. The 
input signal x(k) , and Pi(z) indicates the analysis of 
unequal-passbands with L-bands, the adaptive filters of 
nonzero coefficients will be denoted as Si(z) , the required 
signal will be

d(k , where the error signal is e(k).

filter bank. 
Figure 3 shows the ith band of the resulting scheme, 
which allows the filters to operate at a lower sampling rate. 
To obtain a scheme with less complexity we consider the 
analysis filters are sufficiently selective to accept spectrum 
interference only in frequency responses of neighboring 
bands. The ith band that is shown in Figure 4, we see that 
Pr,c(z) = Pr(z)Pc(z) are the filters of nonzero coefficients  
Si(z) shifted forward by Fi [10]. Looking at the ith band of 
the simplified scheme shown in Figure 4, the sampling rate 
of the adaptive filters is Fi  and Fi+1  times less than the rate 
of the input signal.

The scheme can be further simplified by noting that

A. Taps Selection 
As mentioned in section III, about a good design of 
analysis filters to avoid the spectrum overlap, the parameters 
of Figure 4 are similar to the parameters of Figure  2. From 
this hypothesis an equation will be extracted assuming the 
case of modeling a random FIR system.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
A random signal with normal distribution was applied 
on an IIR filter with z = 0.73. A noise of 10-7 is used and a 
system of order KU = 900 is considered. The decomposition 
was in octaves with L = 1, 2, 3, 4. Table I shows the

decorrelate their samples.

Next, we compare the performance of mean square error 
considering different adaptive schemes with L = 4 bands. 
Figure 7 shows the performance of the mean square error 
for the proposed critical decimation scheme with unequal-
passbands and the subsampled scheme with unequal-
passbands. It can be seen that the suggested scheme with 
unequal-passbands 
offers 
faster 
convergence 
speed 
compared to the Ichikawa and Furukawa approach [13].

unequal-passbands. 
To decrease the problem of slow convergence in wider 
bands, we use a subsampled scheme.  
 
Figure 7.  The mean square error with L = 4 
The reason behind improving the convergence in the 
scheme with unequal-passbands in contrast to the one with 
equal-passbands is because of breaking down the input into 
narrower bands at the smaller frequencies that causes a 
lower rate between the largest and smallest powers [9]. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an unequal-passbands scheme was 
proposed and wider-band analysis filters were used. An 
equation is derived by modeling a random FIR system. This 
system is constructed from filters of nonzero coefficients 
that are used to design the equivalent FIR scheme. A perfect 
reconstruction is used by the help of the analysis filter bank. 
This bank allows us to obtain a scheme with less complexity 
by considering sufficiently selective analysis filters. By 
reducing the taps the computational cost is reduced. The 
results showed that the suggested method speeds up the 
convergence rate.
