Abstract—There exist many explications for phenomena in
logistics – one of them is the so called bullwhip effect. It explains
ups and downs in turnovers in a supply chain if demands and
offers of the participants are not synchronized. While previous
work on the simulation of the bullwhip effect was intended
to explain it in general, surprisingly little research has been
conducted with focus on how to make these simulations available
for companies. In doing so, simulation based forecasts could
reduce storage and production costs signiﬁcantly, prevent com-
panies from getting stuck in the bullwhip trap, and thus enable
signiﬁcant savings. This paper, in contrast, demonstrates how to
develop models of the bullwhip effect for a given scenario with
the aid of Excel and with a novel, freely accessible modeling and
simulation environment for high-level Petri nets, and compares
the ﬁndings. Companies can use both approaches and adapt them
easily to their speciﬁc problem. Hence, this paper has two major
outcomes: The models themselves but also an explanation on how
to ﬁnd such models.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many companies strive to reduce their internal costs. But
in addition, there is another signiﬁcant potential for savings
through a better understanding of the market and coordinated
communication with the other market participants. How high
this savings potential is can exemplary be explained using
the bullwhip effect (BWE): Strong ﬂuctuations in terms of
production and sales of the participants in a supply chain can
be observed, which lag behind current market developments.
Although phenomena such as the bullwhip effect are known,
this knowledge rarely has any practical impact on business
decisions. Appropriate simulation models could change that.
But entrepreneurs need both suitable models and software
to be able to carry out the corresponding simulations. This
enables savings in production and logistics as well as a
signiﬁcant contribution to increasing sustainability in supply
chains. For this, however, practitioners need guidance on how
to proceed methodically and which tools they can use for this.
This paper answers the question how to develop a sim-
ulation for the bullwhip effect in a step-by-step approach
in correspondence with the phase model of Figure 1 with
commonly available tools. It may therefore serve as a source
for practitioners to apply the ﬁndings to their own business.
A detailed description of an imagined scenario is the starting
point where the actual process and the business rules which
trigger procurement and production are the most important
components.

An Excel based simulation model served as a conceptual
model. For each simulation period distinct calculations had to
be deﬁned. Although this was a helpful step to understand the
problem, this solution does not scale very well. Interested read-
ers are invited to ask for the original Excel ﬁle. Afterwards, a
Petri net model was developed as an executable model. Also
here, interested users are invited to ask for the model and to
test it with the aid of the tool which is free to use for academic
purposes. Both, Excel and Petri net solutions were used to
validate each other. What must not be underestiamated is the
need for a meaningful visualization of the simulation results
to solve the problem.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II explains the
bullwhip effect and discusses former work on its simulation.
Section III introduces a supply chain scenario for which
simulation models have been developed in Excel as described
in Section IV and with the aid of high-level Petri nets as
described in Section VI. Since modeling and simulation of
Petri nets highly depends on the tool used, Section V is
inserted in between, introducing Petri nets and the Process-
Simulation.Center (P-S.C). Finally, in Section VII visualiza-
tion is addressed as a major topic to enable decision making
based on the simulation results. A summary and an outlook
are given in Section VIII.

II. RELATED WORK ON THE BULLWHIP EFFECT
Various deﬁnitions of the term BWE exist in literature. In
general, the BWE can be described as a volatile gap between a
company’s orders and its suppliers expectation which increases
in the up- and downstream of a supply chain. Typically, the
BWE is considered concerning the variables order volume,
inventory, lot size, and production capacity [2].
The drivers of the BWE are manifold: An increased demand
due to a delayed information is called Forrester effect, while
order bundling within a player is found as Burbridge effect.
The Houlian effect describes a situation where participants
expect a possible bottleneck of their suppliers and therefore
declare a higher demand as necessary. Finally, the promotion
effect results from price ﬂuctuations [3]–[5]. Often behavioral
and psychological factors of the decision makers in the supply
chain have a major impact on the degree of volatility [6].
There exist several approaches to simulate the BWE. But
[7][8] criticize that most authors use rather simple supply
chains which consist only of two to four stages with one player
on each stage. This means an unacceptable level of abstraction
for practical applications.
Other approaches to simulate supply chains are conjoint
with high entry barriers for potential users [9]. exemplary,
[10] use a genetic algorithm to consider cost and liquidity
management of supply chains. [11] use an adaptive network
based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) trained with the pro-
duction information of a beverage producer. Companies can
hardly adopt such methods because their modes of action are
in-apprehensible for IT laymen.
Thus, companies use software technologies to accelerate
the information ﬂow and production speed in the hope of
avoiding or at least reducing the BWE, instead of using the
knowledge concerning the bullwhip effect. In 2020, 45% of
the asked companies use inventory and network optimization
tools and another 44% will adopt these tools within the next
ﬁve years. Robotics and automation, which can be used to
speed up reactions on changing demands, are recognized as
the technologies with the highest potential (above 60%) [12].
From the authors’ perspective, these technologies result in
local and isolated improvements. Their impact on the entire
supply chain remains vague. The methods and tools used in
this paper to model the BWE, however, enable practitioners
to understand the causality within a simulation model, adapt
the models to their own needs, and to develop conﬁdence in
the simulation results.
III. SIMULATION SCENARIO
The presented simulation of the bullwhip effect is conducted
at the example of an imagined scenario (see Figure 2), where
consumers’ demands pull goods through a supply chain which
also consists of retailers, producers and raw material suppliers.

The scenario considers production and trading of shampoos
called Aloe, Chai, Coco which are kept simple: They consist
of bottled soap and odor of various ratio (see Figure 3). The
focus is on the ﬂow of the bottles. For other raw materials
there would be similar results, hence they are omitted here.

Products and raw materials are produced on demand. After
selling products to the consumers out of their stocks, retailers
ﬁll up their stocks when they reach their speciﬁc reorder
level. For this, the producers have to empty their stocks and
eventually order raw material from their suppliers for the
production of new products for upcoming requests. Also, the
producers use reorder levels to calculate their speciﬁc demand.
There exist 8 retailers named Ali, Ede, Glo, Lid, md, Pha,
Rew, and Ros. (and probably German readers assume which
real retailers the authors had in mind). Each of them offers
all three products and procures them from 6 producers called
Body, Head, Neck, Hand, Knee, and Foot. Each producer
produces one of the mentioned products and has exclusive
contracts with one or more retailers. The sourcing matrix in
Table I shows the relations between the different partners.

All raw material is delivered by one supplier since the focus
here is on the bullwhip effect for retailer and producer.
The simulation runs over 12 periods. All stocks of retailers
and manufacturers are initialized with 150% of their reorder
levels as shown in Table II. Retailers have access to their
global storage so local storages are not considered.

As summarized in Table III, the total consumption varies
seasonally from 700.000 to 1.400.000 bottles over all products
and their market share varies from 25% to 60% of the total

These assumptions allow to calculate the speciﬁc demand
of each product for all retailers in every period. Table V shows

The supply chain can be simulated period-wise, where each
period is divided into the following phases:
1) Retailers fulﬁll the demands of their consumers if pos-
sible. This reduces their stocks. Unfulﬁlled demands are
backlogged and deferred to the next period.
2) Retailers order products from their producers (e.g., Ali
orders Aloe from Body) when their stocks decrease
below their reorder level. The order amount is the dif-
ference between reorder and current level multiplied by
a nervousness-factor which is set to 2 in the following.
Unfulﬁlled amounts are deferred to the next period.
3) Producers satisfy the orders out of their stocks in the
sequence given by the retailers’ names. Unfulﬁlled de-
mands are backlogged and deferred to the next period.
The production is restricted by the amount of bottles in
the raw material stocks of the producers.
4) If bottle stocks sink below individual reorder levels, new
bottles are ordered as described above.
5) The production of bottles is assumed to be unlimited.
Since this scenario has several and widespread parameters,
it can be adapted to many real-world situations.
IV. SIMULATION WITH THE AID OF EXCEL
When developing a conceptual model of the BWE with
Excel, it was the aim to keep the calculations technically
as simple as possible. Hence, no VBA was used with the
consequence that each modiﬁcation of a stock, the calculation
of order amounts and of backorders had to be mapped with
the aid of individual data cells.
The challenges of this approach are to keep all calculations
of comparable concepts consistent and to chain the calcu-
lations of a given period with its previous one. Beside the
simplicity with respect to possible modiﬁcations of the model,
the calculation of the twelve periods occurs instantly.
Several data sheets for products, periods, demands, retailers
and producers were built as follows:
Product contains product master data to extend calculations
for more complex product recipes in the future.
Period contains the assumed situation per period described
by market share per product and per retailer.
Demand uses Period data to charge the demand of the con-
sumers for a speciﬁc product sold by a retailer per period.
Retailer uses Demand to change the initial stock of and the
demand for a speciﬁc product for each retailer. Then, the
stock level after fulﬁlling the consumers’ demands and a
possible backlog of unfulﬁlled demands are calculated.
The purchase volume equals the difference between cur-
rent stock and reorder level multiplied with the nervous-
ness factor, if the stock is below the reorder level.
The calculation of the following periods is conducted in a
similar way except for the initial stock per period which
is derived from the previous one.
Since 12 periods are considered for 8 retailers, the
calculation stretches over more than 100 rows and within
the rows stand out three column blocks for each product.
Producer is set up in a similar way like Retailer. Product and
retailer data are used to fulﬁll the initial demands of the
retailers. Supply conﬂicts between retailers are avoided
by serving them in alphabetical order.
Also the producers’ stocks after delivery are calculated
and a possible backlog is build up. If a producer’s
inventory is below the reported level, it produces enough
to replenish the inventory, multiplied by the nervousness
factor. This is only restricted by the amount of available
bottles.

Finally, bottles are ordered if the bottle amount is below
the reorder level, again multiplied by the nervousness
factor. It is assumed that the producer of the bottles can
always fulﬁll this demand.
The calculation of the following periods is conducted in
a similar way, and complexity of the sheet Producer is
similar to that of the sheet Retailer.
In addition to these calculation sheets, also sheets with
graphical dashboards have been established to observe changes
concerning the BWE if parameters like the initial stocks,
demands, reorder levels, or nervousness factors change. This
makes the simulation experimental.
Although it was easy to get started with the Excel model,
it became worse with the number of periods, products, and
retailers that had to be added to the sheet until the scenario
setting had been reached. One reason for this is that it
is difﬁcult to include well readable comments to the excel
sheets. Also changing delivery policies like the order in which
retailers are served by the producers must be implemented cell
by cell, since it is difﬁcult to centralize such decisions. Hence,
it must be stated that it is almost impossible to develop scalable
models for the BWE in Excel. Nonetheless, for the described
problem size it is a good alternative and helped to validate the
results of the Petri net model explained next.
V. PETRI NETS AND THE PROCESS-SIMULATION.CENTER
Petri net models are used to analyze and simulate dynamic
systems. Their main beneﬁt is the ability to describe concur-
rency in a natural way and concurrent actions are not forced
into a schedule. Hence, they are beneﬁcial for the deﬁnition
of business processes and supply chains [13][14]. One popular
and currently widely discussed application of Petri nets in
business process management is Process Mining [15][16].
Originally, Petri nets are deﬁned as Place/Transition nets
(P/T) with anonymous tokens indicating a system’s state [17],
but concepts like Predicate/Transition nets (Pr/T) and Colored
Petri Nets (CPN) also support the representation of high level
information [18]–[20]. Demanding models of high-level Petri
nets need appropriate software for modeling and simulation.
The Process-Simulation.Center (P-S.C), which is introduced
next, supports P/T and Pr/T nets. The Pr/T net concept is
realized in such a way that places have an assigned data type
and can be used in analogy to tables in a database. Functions
encoded on transitions and edges may process this data. Data
which is spread over several places can be joined into a single
data record. Own types for date and time are substructures for
the simulation of processes in production and logistics and
enhance the approaches to timed Petri nets [21].
In contrast to relational algebra and, hence, SQL, in P-S.C
the processing of tuples on places is serialized. The reason for
this design choice is that in business and production processes
work items are also treated one after another. The concrete
sequence is decided upon locally by the transitions of the net
and its marking [22].
Moreover, the P-S.C can be used to connect the process view
on a system with other views. Process maps may combine dif-
ferent processes with each other and express the strategic value
of a speciﬁc process as a primary, support, or management
process. Also, the organizational structure of an institution can
be combined with the Petri net view by arranging the process
nodes in swim lanes of the corresponding responsible organi-
zational units. Organizational charts complete the functions of
the P-S.C [22].
It is worth mentioning that for a better readability the P-S.C
draws nodes in such a way that their labels can be presented
within. To further strengthen visual clues of their functionality,
nodes can be provided with symbols [22].
The dearth of current Petri net tools, the quaint user ex-
perience of most of the still working ones and the unique
approach of using textual programming instead of drag-and-
drop modeling in combination with the added functionality are
the main reasons for the implementation of the P-S.C [22].
VI. SIMULATION WITH THE AID OF PETRI NETS
Figure 4 shows the Petri net model of the described scenario.
Swimlanes are used to separate the model into three parts,
called Exchange, Supply Chain and Phases, that interact in
order to simulate a period with the following ﬁve phases:
Phase 1 In the ﬁrst phase transition Buy Shampoo realizes
the transfer of goods from retailers to consumers. It is
enabled as long as there is unfulﬁlled demand for the
current period, which is coded in the token information
on place 1. Phase. For this place, Demand contains the
demand information for all periods and place Retailer
Dashboard encodes the initial stocks at the beginning
and later the achieved stocks as the simulation proceeds.
Delivered goods are coded on place Bought.
Transition next below from 1. Phase initiates the next
phase, if transition Buy Shampoo is no longer enabled.
Phase 2 The second phase occurs when the corresponding
place is marked with the number of the current period.
Now the retailers order shampoo if the stocks are below
the reorder level. At the same time, the producers’ stocks
of ﬁnished goods are emptied. For this, the current stocks
of the producers are encoded on place Producer Dash-
board. Delivered goods are coded on place Delivered.
When transition Order Shampoo is no longer enabled,
transition next below of 2. Phase ﬁres and phase 3 begins.
Phase 3 The third phase simulates the production of new
shampoo, restricted only by the number of available
bottles. Therefore, only the producer information must
be considered. The produced amount is stored on place
Produced.
When transition Produce Shampoo is no longer enabled,
transition next below of 3. Phase ﬁres to begin phase 4.
Phase 4 The fourth phase simulates the re-stocking of the
bottles if the current stocks are below the reorder level.
It is assumed that the producers of the bottles have inﬁnite
supply available.
When transition Deliver Bottles is not enabled anymore,
transition next behind 4. Phase ﬁres and the last phase of
a period begins.

VII. VISUALIZATION OF THE BULLWHIP EFFECT
The classic bullwhip effect is manifested by pronounced
ﬂuctuations in inventory levels upstream in the supply chain.
Besides, different views of what is happening are possible.
Visualizations are suitable for addressing different perspectives
within or interdependencies across the supply chain. To see the
bullwhip effect of a product in the supply chain, viewers look
into the participants’ warehouses. The data for this is a CSV-
export generated by the P-S.C at the end of the simulation.
Figure 6 provides a ﬁrst view: The four 3D area graphs in
the diagram represent the summed inventory per stage of the
supply chain: Light green ˆ= retailer stock, green ˆ= producer
stock I (ﬁnished goods), dark green ˆ= producer stock II (raw
material). All eight retailers offer Aloe in their portfolio, but
this product is manufactured by only three producers.
The stocks of Body, Head, and Neck and of the eight
retailers reach a similar level. Increased sales between periods
3 to 5 (from 200k to 404k shampoos sold) have a well visible
impact for the upstream participants in the supply chain.
Period zero represents the initial values in the warehouses
when no sales of the products have taken place yet. The gray
area chart (ˆ= bought goods) starts in the ﬁrst period. This
graph also shows the amount of goods actually sold in order
to classify the stage-wise inventory level of the supply chain.
Further, the bought goods act as an anchor value and could
be the benchmark in a customer-oriented supply chain.

It is worth taking a look at the respective ordering and
production behavior shown in Figure 7. Fluctuations between
purchased, delivered, and produced products become more
relevant upstream in the supply chain, as described in the BWE
literature.
The focus in Figure 7 is on the changes in inventories
of the product Aloe. Based on the general popularity of the
product’s consumer group, the number of shampoos supplied
and produced is also adjusted here. The gray line shows the
actual demand for shampoos. The light green bar reﬂects the

In addition, a simpliﬁcation of the model is uncovered
here: The production capacity of the producers varies greatly.
Fluctuations in demand are compensated for almost equally
by this ﬂexibility. Imagine a constant production level of e.g.,
400-500k shampoos and in a second step imagine the impact
on the producer’s inventories in Figure 6. The only limitation
in this model is the raw material, which must be ordered ﬁrst,
however, in unlimited quantities.
Basically, these large ﬂuctuations cause uncertainty in ca-
pacity and quantity planning for the participants. This also has
an impact on the capacities to be purchased in terms of loading
space or personnel planning. At this level, all movements at
the product level can be seen across all retailers and producers.
The clear picture given by Figure 6 becomes confusing from
the perspective of an individual. Figure 8 shows an in- and out-
diagram of retailer Glo’s product Aloe. The gray bars represent
the product’s actual amount of sales and the light green bars
represent the shampoos supplied by the producer.
The simulation can be considered as an equivalent to a
business planning game. Thus, the expired period is analyzed
at the same time as the decisions for the coming period
are made, e.g., for the delivery volume. So the stock in the
warehouse is replenished with the ordered quantity (minus
backlog) at the beginning of each period.
Therefore, for example, the inventory at the retailer Glo is
never empty, because the backlog is never equal to the ordered
quantity, but only parts of it.
In this simulation, the demand for the three products Aloe,
Chai, and Coco ﬂuctuates, and so does the planning reliability
for all involved parties. It becomes clear that at this level the
view of the big picture of the market is missing, which is still
given above. How would you act as a retailer Glo in a 13th
period? Would you adjust the order level or perhaps reduce
the order quantity? If you would have a simulation as the
described one, you could add all available market information
to the simulation to soften negative bullwhip effects.

VIII. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
During the validation phase for this research, the authors
found that individual variables such as demand distribution or
output data in the market hardly played a role to generate the
BWE. Further, the modelers could have imposed much tighter
constraints. The simulation model is key. Thus, the models
are most applicable to real-world data from enterprise users.
Even with the arbitrary numbers, the simulations produce the
bullwhip effect, which is clearly visible at the level of an
individual participant.
In conclusion, the following lessons can be summarized
when running a simulation with Excel:
1) At the beginning, a clear and consistent structure should
be developed directly, especially with regard to the
interaction between the tables.
2) Calculations with formulas should be kept as simple as
possible, because they must be repeated for the various
periods, products, retailers and producers.
3) Subsequent changes often lead to errors in the formulas;
the four-eyes principle should be applied.
Also for the Petri net simulation lessons could be learned:
1) It took several detours until the clear ﬁnal structure
presented in this paper was found.
2) However, the ﬁnal solution scales and only the initial
data for more periods have to be added. The Petri net
structure stays the same.
3) Without a mature tool for modeling and simulation
of high-level Petri nets, it is impossible to develop a
comparable model and to beneﬁt from this.
Each approach can meet the user at their individual skills
and supports the performance of what-if analyses and in
running through different scenarios. This is the beauty of these
approaches and paves the way for practical use.
But is this enough to protect companies from the bullwhip
trap? ”Presumably not,” because the simulation only takes
the user to the heart of the problem: Small changes of the
conﬁguration can have a signiﬁcant impact on the outcome,
and incorrect assumptions about the market made by users
lead to incorrect predictions regarding the bullwhip effect.
Nonetheless, further research on this topic seems to be
reasonable, because this research on bullwhip simulation is
only just beginning.
