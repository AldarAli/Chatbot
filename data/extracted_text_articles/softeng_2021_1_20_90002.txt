Abstract—This paper is a systematic literature review of the 
compliance of blockchain with the General Data Protection 
Regulation act. Although there are contradictory opinions 
about the compliance of blockchain with General Data 
Protection Regulation amongst different researchers, in this 
paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on the topic to 
get a  perspective on previous studies and models to build a

existing solutions and models for an interactive software 
auditing the transactions between the data subjects and third 
parties. This review aims to answer the dilemma of the 
applicability of blockchain in auditing the transactions between 
the data subjects and data processors in the General Data 
Protection Regulation framework. Moreover, this paper 
discusses the implications and limitations and paves the path for

INTRODUCTION 
Since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009, based on 
Blockchain technology, a vast group of academic, industrial, 
and business innovators have become more and more attracted 
to using blockchain technology for their purposes such as 
researches, literature reviews, secure contracts, information 
sharing, and digital transactions due to its immutable, 
transparent, secure, and trustworthy characteristics [1][2]. 
Accordingly, blockchain could be the best solution for 
privacy protection and data processing transparency regarding 
its compatibility with the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) act that is effective since May 25th 2018 across 
Europe; however, there are contradictory opinions around its 
compatibility among scholars [3][4][5]. Numerous pieces of 
literature introduced the disruptive capabilities of blockchain 
as the most important revolutionizing invention after the 
Internet itself, considering its distributed consensus model [6]. 
A systematic review of more than 260 scholarly articles 
about blockchain applications from 2014 to the first quarter of 
2018 illustrates that only 24 had focused on the privacy and 
security area, with more than 1000 percent growth in the 
second half [7]. Hence, regarding the exponential soar in this 
field, and considering the launch of GDPR in the second 
quarter of 2018, this study scrutinizes the contrasting notions 
about the trending less-investigated concept of blockchain-
GDPR harmony and develops a conceptual model for an 
interactive software auditing the interactions between the data 
subjects and third-party data processors under the supervision 
of GDPR issuing-parties based on the previous scholarly 
designs [5]. Hence, the research question is whether a 
blockchain-based platform is capable of auditing the 
transactions between the data subjects and third-party data 
processors in the framework of GDPR or not? 
In this regard, this paper analyzes 49 articles and 
proceedings from 2016 to 2020 to pinpoint the applications 
and challenges of blockchain and GDPR compatibility of 
blockchain technologies. This review consists of two main 
time periods, before the launch of GDPR and after the launch 
of GDPR, and classifies the applications of GDPR in the 
mentioned periods to identify the gap for the inception of a 
blockchain-based GDPR auditing moderator, also at the same 
time, underpins the issues of implementation of such an 
application. Moreover, this paper discusses the implications 
and limitations and paves the path for future studies to 
elaborate on the concept. This paper contains five parts 
including introduction as Section I, literature review as 
Section II covering subtitles of review process, constructs, 
applications, and compliance, results as Section III, discussion 
as Section IV, and conclusion as Section V.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
This study seeks the answer to the dilemma of 
applicability of blockchain in auditing the transactions 
between the data subjects and data processors in the GDPR 
framework that is provided by the EU and imposes strong 
obligations regarding security and privacy to all of the 
organizations around the world that collect or process any data 
related to the people in the EU [3]. 
Moreover, the findings of this study are related to the 
context of GDPR articles, and the level of analysis is the 
applications of blockchain technology, which are highly 
dependent on its components, mechanisms, and consensuses 
[8]. Consequently, the low diversity of the mechanisms of 
blockchain and the translation of the GDPR articles into 
logical machine algorithms are the limitations of this 
conceptual model that need further development in future

studies. Finally, the outcome of this study serves the interests 
of data subjects, third-party data processors, and the auditing 
organization for the GDPR acts. All the steps of this 
systematic review are explained in the following sections and 
depicted in Figure 1.  
A. Review Process 
To attain a holistic approach towards the proposed model, 
a preliminary search from 2016 to 2020 with the keywords 
“Blockchain 
Applications”, 
“Blockchain 
Issues”, 
“Blockchain 
Security”, 
“Blockchain 
Privacy”, 
and 
“Blockchain and GDPR” was conducted through Web of 
Science, Scimago Journal and Country Rank, and Google 
Scholar to help define the concepts, categorize the 
applications of blockchain, and assess its compatibility with 
GDPR. As a preliminary result, 89 articles and proceedings 
were selected for further investigations while after filtration 
on source journals and proceedings reliability, H5 index rate, 
citations rate, abstract and keywords relevancy, and result and 
conclusion validity and novelty, 40 articles and proceedings 
were found ineligible and 49 articles and proceedings were 
selected for the second round of filtration, as illustrated in 
Table I. Filtered articles and proceedings either have a high 
citation, a high H5 index from the publisher journal or 
proceeding, or a valuable content due to its novelty of 
publishing date. The initial inclusion and exclusion criteria of 
this systematic review are, respectively, the publication year 
of the study being between 2016 to 2020, the credibility of the 
study assessed by the citation rate of the study and H5 index 
rate of the publisher, the relevancy of the study evaluated by 
scanning the keywords and abstracts, and the novelty of the

results and conclusions. Regarding this criteria, the selected 
articles and proceedings were assigned into the subcategories 
of either supportive or key articles and proceedings, resulting 
in 21 supportive and 28 key articles and proceedings. 
The second round of filtration consists of the classification 
of the 28 key articles and proceedings based on whether they 
contain information concerning the definition of constructs, 
the applications of blockchain, or the compatibility of the 
blockchain and GDPR, resulting in 7 key articles and 
proceedings concerning constructs, 17 applications, and 4 
compatibility aspects. Finally, a three-step literature review 
reveals the definitions of the constructs, classifies the 
applications 
of 
blockchain, 
and 
demonstrates 
the 
compatibility of blockchain and GDPR. In each step, the 
minimum quantitative obligations are a minimum average 
citation of 150 or a minimum average H5 index of 65, and the 
minimum qualitative requirement is the verification of a 
supportive supervisory team including researchers with 
relevant research experience. 
B. Constructs 
In the first step of this systematic literature review, this 
paper derives the definitions of the foundational concepts and 
mechanisms embedded in blockchain technology and GDPR 
by reviewing 7 key articles and proceedings from 2016 to 
2020 to integrate the notions about the basis of the concepts. 
These articles and proceedings have an average citation of 150 
and an average H5 index of 65 with a citation range of 1 to 
518 and an H5 index rate of 19 to 112.  
GDPR is one of the largest and most difficult regulations 
in data privacy history issued by the European Union (EU) 
party across Europe with data subjects’ consent centricity. 
This regulation applies to all the data processors worldwide 
offering personal data-related goods and services to the 
citizens of the EU and the data processors located in the EU 
providing services for the rest of the world. Besides, the data 
subject’s consent should be withdrawable, the data should be 
removable, and the processing purpose of the third parties 
should be clear and accessible to the data subjects [9]. 
Moreover, one of the applications of the GDPR is the 
compensation of the data subjects suffering from data privacy 
violations. This reimbursement takes place by fining the data 
processors breaking the rules of GDPR, although this is only 
one-way monetized [3]. 
Blockchain technology is a synthesis of techniques of 
cryptography, algorithms, distributed consensuses, immutable 
databases, and distributed peer to peer networks that 
propagate blocks containing Hash as the modification notifier 
and function propagator, Timestamp as the time recorder of 
the transactions, and data subblocks containing specific 
programmed data [4][8]. 
Consensus algorithm enables the establishment of a 
mutual trust between the users of a blockchain network 
without any need for an administrative party to verify the 
transaction between them. In other words, the “consensus 
function is a mechanism that makes all blockchain nodes have

an agreement in the same message” [10]. 
Some consensus algorithms are like Proof of Work (PoW) 
that requires solving a complicated computational process to 
ensure authentication and verifiability to mine a block of 
transactions in a blockchain [7][11], Proof of Stake (PoS), 
which validates the users that present their holdings to 
generate the next block while another version of PoS is called 
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), which aims at completing a 
distributed consensus in the system [7][11], and Zero-
Knowledge Proof (ZKP) that in private transactions makes the 
verifier believe that the target information exists in the 
transaction, although it does not reveal the real information 
[11].  
Smart contract is an agreement between doubtful 
members, implemented by the consensus mechanisms in 
which trusted transactions received by the blockchain can call 
the contract's public methods to use its data for processing 
[12]. 
C. Applications of Blockchain 
In the second step, this review divides the target period of 
the investigation into the before and after the launch of GDPR, 
which is 2016 to the first quarter of 2018, and the second 
quarter of 2018 to 2020, and scrutinizes the applications of 
blockchain in scholarly articles and provides a classification 
for the covered fields. The classification and dispersal of the 
applications of blockchain are shown in Table II. This table 
shows the number of articles and proceedings in each period 
and the applications that each has mentioned. 
In this step, 6 articles from the first period with an average 
citation of 462 and an average H5 index of 87 were scanned 
that had a citation range of 11 to 1098 and an H5 index range

of 0 to 231, also 11 articles from the second period with an 
average citation of 124 and an average H5 index of 95 were 
scanned that had a citation range of 24 to 174 and H5 index 
range of 0 to 395. The mentioned table classifies the 
applications of blockchain into Healthcare, Finance, 
Database, Privacy and Security, Internet of Things (IoT), and 
others, and illustrates that in these 5 years 17 key articles have 
mentioned these applications 62 times, although none has 
mentioned a blockchain-based application for the audition of 
the transactions between the data subjects and third parties in 
the framework of GDPR, even after the launch of GDPR. 
On the other hand, some articles have discussed the 
compliance of other blockchain-based applications with the 
GDPR act that will be investigated in the next section. 
D. Compliance of Blockchain With GDPR 
 
In the third step, this review investigates the compliance 
of the concept of blockchain with the GDPR act. To achieve 
the result, the contradictory notions are extracted from 4 key 
scholarly articles and proceedings with an average citation of 
10 ranging from 1 to 28 and an average H5 index of 86 ranging 
from 77 to 112. The dispersal of GDPR inconsistencies of 
blockchain and their solutions are illustrated in Table III by 
classification of issues, solutions, H5 index, citation, and year.  
 
On one hand, data immutability in blockchain technology 
is in contrast with the GDPR act that entitles the users to delete 
their data, on the other hand, one solution to tackle the crisis 
of data immutability in the blockchain is using techniques like 
Accenture that lets a trusted party alter the data block, Monero

that makes the data subjects untraceable, and Hyperledger that 
transforms blockchain to a code executable distributed 
computer [13]. Moreover, a Hyperledger Fabric permissioned 
blockchain can use smart contracts to detect trusted parties, an 
off-chain storage method to reduce data leakage, and 
eXtensible Access Control Markup Language to impose 
governance measures to tackle the inconsistency of 
blockchain and GDPR in a blockchain-based personal data 
management application [4]. 
Another prototype overcoming compliance issues is the 
German Asylum case that uses the layered architecture of 
information access and storage, private blockchain, and data 
depersonalization methods to harmonize the ongoing 
procedures with the GDPR [14].  
In another example, Personal Data And Identity 
Management blockchain-based application, with a human-
centric approach, designs layered blockchains with smart 
contracts, permissioned access, digital identity verification, 
and off-chain storage for consent and identity management 
and data monetization [9].  
III. 
RESULTS 
 
This literature review reveals that although there has been 
a remarkable increase in the number of scholarly articles 
exploring the applications of blockchain in the privacy and 
security area before and after the lunch of GDPR, there is still 
a gap in unfolding high potential capabilities of blockchain as 
a GDPR-compatible technology, which is capable of 
providing the basis for the audition of the transactions 
between the data subjects and data processors. As disclosed 
previously, 17 articles and proceedings have mentioned the 
applications of blockchain 62 times from 2016 to 2020 while 
only 4 articles and proceedings have investigated its 
applications in GDPR-related topics like human-centric data 
management services or one-way monetized personal data 
management services [4][9][13]. Furthermore, none has 
indicated blockchain’s capability as a basis for a two-way 
monetized GDPR-mining auditing platform. 
  
After extraction of the concepts and constructs of GDPR 
and blockchain from the literature, classification of the 
explored applications of blockchain, and investigation of 
technical compatibility of GDPR and blockchain, this study 
explicates that there might be illusive inconsistencies in the 
definitions of GDPR and blockchain at a superficial level; 
however, at a technical level techniques and technologies like 
Smart Contracts, Monero, Accenture, Hyperledger, Off-
Chain Storage, etc. reinforce the unseen bonds between the 
interrelated motifs of GDPR and blockchain [4][14]. 
 
Consequently, after clarification of the compatibility of 
GDPR and blockchain regarding the research’s question, and 
after exploration of the previously proposed solutions and 
models, this study aims to fill the gap with a conceptual two-
way monetized GDPR-mining blockchain-based auditing 
platform to fulfill the necessity of an effective transaction 
auditor platform as a supervisory authority, which is capable 
of fining data privacy violators and rewarding trader data 
subjects.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
After three rounds of systematic literature review and 
analysis containing definition extraction, application gap 
detection, and blockchain-GDPR compatibility assessment, 
this study develops a conceptual model based on the previous 
prominent 
GDPR-compliant 
blockchain-based 
data 
management applications and builds up the GDPR article 
mining concept and two-way monetizing contracts upon 
previous models.  
Previous models introduced in the reviewed papers were 
designed to enhance the security and privacy of managing 
personal data in the framework of GDPR with the help of 
blockchain technology, also one-way monetization is 
mentioned in one of the previously designed models [4][5][9]. 
 
Although significant efforts have been made at a technical 
level for the management of personal data, there is still a need 
for an auditing platform capable of two-way monetized 
audition accompanied by the feature of the GDPR-mining 
concept. Therefore, this study aims to build upon previous 
models and conceptualize a two-way monetized auditing 
platform in which data processors can mine the GDPR acts as 
nodes in the blockchain. In this conceptual three-layered 
blockchain-based model, an issuing party acts as a supervisory 
authority that stores, audits, and monetizes the transactions 
between the data subjects and the third parties based on smart 
contracts. Figure 2 illustrates the model.  
This model consists of a public blockchain for the 
registration and credit evaluation of the third parties that 
permits all the data processors to register as a verified member 
on the blockchain and to interact with the data subjects in 
order to build up an agreement with them in the framework of 
a smart contract for the monetization of their relation 
regarding data processing and data trading [5][9]. This 
blockchain evaluates the data processors based on PoW 
consensus after completion of each cycle of transaction that 
goes through the three-layered blockchain and comes back 
with the result of the process. Data processors can mine the 
GDPR nodes and earn value and credit as long as they prove

auditor. 
more and more nonconflicting results with the GDPR nodes 
[7][11]. 
Also, a private blockchain of data subjects and their 
customized governance policies for communication with the 
third parties is an intermediate layer that stores all the 
information of the data subjects in blocks of data using 
consensus algorithms and techniques of data propagation and 
data alteration in order to empower the data subjects to chose 
how they want to share their blocks of data and when they 
want to share or withdraw their blocks of data 
[4][7][10][11][13]. In this blockchain, smart contracts clarify 
the agreement of monetization and data accessibility. In this 
regard, data processors send their request of fetching data with 
the transparently defined act of GDPR, which is needed to be 
taken into account, in the form of a PoS or DPoS consensuses. 
As long as data processors share their act, they can fetch 
information and mine GDPR nodes to elevate their credits 
[7][11]. Also, the ZKP consensus ensures the availability of 
information on the data subject side and the availability of 
funds on the data processor side for further monetization in 
the form of data trading or violation fining [11]. Monetization 
is based on the inputs of involved parties in the agreement of 
the smart contract. 
The third layer is a consortium blockchain of machine-
translated GDPR article nodes in which each node presents 
one specific article of GDPR and its requirements and 
relations. Requirements obligate the data processors to 
process the data in the framework of GDPR, and the relations 
present the possible connection of the different acts of GDPR 
as nodes in the blockchain. Each time a data processor reaches 
the information of a data subject through a smart contract, the 
transaction of fetching and processing of information goes 
through the GDPR layer for further evaluation and audition of 
the process. Moreover, a backward transaction containing 
processed information of the data subject comes back through 
the GDPR layer and notifies the data subjects about the way 
their information is being used. This backward transaction 
helps the evaluation of the third parties in an assessment cycle 
while the third parties can either enhance their credit as they 
mine more and more GDPR articles nodes or lose credit due 
to GDPR violations. 
Finally, all the transactions and information are stored on 
an off-chain server of the auditing issuing party that enables 
the issuing party to trace the footprints and audit the 
transactions based on the agreements between the involved 
parties to either reward the data subjects for selling the data or 
fine the third parties in case of GDPR-conflicting transactions 
[4][9]. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 2, at the starting 
point, data processor number 1 registers on the first 
blockchain via transaction 1 and requests the establishment of 
a smart contract with data subject A. After initiation of the 
monetization agreement and clarification of the act, it fetches 
the demanded data from the second blockchain and mines the 
related GDPR act number II. Eventually, after the process of 
the data at the end point, a backward transaction containing 
the processed data travels back to the start point, where a 
supervisory authority stores all the information of the 
transaction on the off-chain storage and audits the transaction 
based on the smart contracts in order to validate the GDPR-

act mining of the data processor and monetize the transaction. 
Similarly, data processor number 2 goes through the same 
procedure via transaction 2, however it mines two GDPR acts 
due to the relevancy of its purpose to those acts. 
This is an early-stage conceptual design and needs further 
development due to its technical and practical limitations like 
the translation of GDPR acts into machine algorithms 
adjustable in the framework of blockchain, unavailability of 
customized blockchain mechanisms, and possible refusal of 
the involved parties for the implementation of such a platform. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
To recapitulate, in three-rounds of systematic analysis, this 
paper extracts the proper definitions for the understanding of 
the concepts of blockchain and GDPR, classifies the 
applications of blockchain, and demonstrates that neither 
before nor after the launch of GDPR no scholarly article has 
mentioned the application of blockchain in auditing and 
monetizing the transactions between the third parties and data 
subjects. However, after the launch of GDPR, some scholars 
have investigated the inconsistency of blockchain-based 
applications with GDPR acts and proposed designed 
solutions. 
Finally, this study builds upon those designs and proposes 
an interactive conceptual GDPR-mining blockchain-based 
auditing model capable of GDPR node mining and two-may 
monetizing. This is an initial conceptual design and further 
investigation regarding practicality of the model needs to be 
done, and developments need to be made in the future.
