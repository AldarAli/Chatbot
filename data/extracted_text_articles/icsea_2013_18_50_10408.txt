Abstract—Embedded systems have gained more and more
importance in recent years, being adopted in a diversity of
application areas. Due to the increasing variety and complexity
of these systems, a rising demand for software quality can
be observed. Initiatives proposing quality models and quality
attributes (QM&QA) for embedded systems can already be
found. Nevertheless, there is a lack of a complete, detailed
panorama about the research that proposes QM&QA dedi-
cated speciﬁcally to this domain. In this paper, we apply the
systematic review technique to investigate how QM&QA for
embedded systems have been deﬁned, evaluated, and used. In
addition, we identify which quality attributes are considered as
the most important ones in the embedded systems domain. As
a result, this work provides a detailed state-of-the-art about the
QM&QA for embedded systems and identiﬁes new, important
research topics for the future, contributing to improve the
quality of these systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, a large number of products containing embed-
ded software has been developed and used, bringing an
effective impact to the society. Embedded systems have
been widely adopted in different application areas, such
as telecommunication, transportation, entertainment, and
medicine [1]. According to Liggesmeyer and Trapp [2],
over the last 20 years, software’s impact on the embed-
ded system functionalities, as well as on the innovation
and differentiation potential of new products, has rapidly
grown. Besides that, the complexity and diversity of these
products are creating a considerable challenge for embedded
software development, which usually has to meet stringent
requirements, such as real-time or performance [1]. The
development process of embedded systems has to ensure
the compliance with various quality attributes, such as
maintainability, safety, security, and dependability. In this
context, the quality assessment activity must be considered
a key concern during the development of such systems.
This statement is especially true considering the fact that
many embedded systems are considered critical, i.e, systems
whose failures may cause serious damage to the environment
or to human lives, damage to expensive equipment, or non-
recoverable ﬁnancial losses [3].
In another perspective, software quality models have be-
come well-accepted means to describe, manage, and predict
software quality. Over the years, a variety of quality models
have been proposed to support the development of general
software systems. McCall’s Quality Model [4], considered as
the precursor of the actual models, establishes three major
perspectives for deﬁning and identifying the quality of a
software product: product revision, product transition, and
product operations. Each of these perspectives describes a
set of quality attributes that refers to the ability of a software
system to undergo changes, to adapt to new environments,
and to adequately performs its functionalities. Similarly,
Boehm’s Quality Model [5] attempts to deﬁne software
quality by a given set of attributes and metrics. Another
important quality model is ISO/IEC 25010 standard [6],
which incorporates quality goals that encompass a large
number of quality attributes. Given its relevance, quality
models and sets of quality attributes (QM&QA) that intent
to speciﬁcally address the needs of embedded systems can
also be found [7], [8]. These studies can be considered
important initiatives, as embedded systems have particular
characteristics, such as the use of dedicated hardware and
real-time constraints, that differentiate them from general in-
formation systems. Nevertheless, as far as we are concerned,
there is no complete, detailed view of how QM&QA have
been deﬁned, evaluated, and used in the embedded systems
domain. Therefore, a study involving a broad, fair analysis
of this research topic seems to be quite relevant, considering
the impact that it could have on the quality of the embedded
systems being developed.
The main objective of this paper is to present a detailed
state of the art of QM&QA for embedded systems, the ap-
plication areas that they are intended for, and how QM&QA
have been evaluated. In addition, this work also aims at
identifying which quality attributes are considered as the
most relevant ones in the embedded systems context. For
this, we have adopted and applied the systematic review

technique [9], which allows for a complete, fair evaluation
of a topic of interest. Results have shown that most studies
are recent, indicating a growing interest and concern of the
community on the proposition of QM&QA for embedded
systems. Besides that, we have observed that there is a
lack of quality models that are widely adopted and used
by developers of embedded systems. Based on our ﬁndings,
we intend that this state of the art makes it possible to
identify interesting, important research topics for further
investigations.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II presents the conducted systematic review and de-
scribes its results. Section III presents the quality assessment
of these results. Section IV summarizes the main, important
ﬁndings of the systematic review and identiﬁes perspectives
of future research. Finally, Section V presents our conclusion
and future work.
II. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW APPLICATION
Our systematic review was conducted from Novem-
ber/2012 to April/2013 by six persons: four software engi-
neering researchers, an embedded system expert, and a sys-
tematic review specialist. To conduct our systematic review,
we followed the process proposed by Kitchenham [9]. In
short, this process is composed of three main phases: plan-
ning, conduction, and reporting. These phases are explained
in more details during the presentation of our systematic
review.
A. Phase 1 - Planning
In this phase, the objectives and the systematic review
protocol are deﬁned. The protocol consists of a predeter-
mined plan that describes the research questions and how the
systematic review will be conducted, i.e., the search strategy.
It also establishes the selection criteria, the data extraction
and synthesis method.
1) Research Questions: Aiming at ﬁnding possibly all
primary studies to understand and summarize evidences
about QM&QA for embedded systems, the following re-
search questions (RQ) were established:
• RQ1: How are QM&QA for embedded systems de-
ﬁned?
– RQ1.1: What are the information sources used to
deﬁne QM&QA for embedded systems?
– RQ1.2: Are the QM&QA developed in a prescrip-
tive or descriptive manner?
• RQ2: What are the application areas where QM&QA
for embedded systems have been used?
– RQ2.1: Are the QM&QA designed for critical
embedded systems?
– RQ2.2: Which design approaches, such as service-
orientation or component-orientation, have been
adopted to develop these embedded systems?
• RQ3: How have QM&QA for embedded systems been
evaluated?
– RQ3.1: What is the level of evidence used to
evaluate the QM&QA?
– RQ3.2: In how many embedded systems the
QM&QA have been applied?
– RQ3.3: Have the QM&QA been used in actual
projects?
• RQ4: What are the main quality attributes for embed-
ded systems?
2) Search Strategy:
In order to establish the search
strategy and considering the research questions, we ini-
tially identiﬁed two main keywords “Embedded System”
and “Quality Model”. We also identiﬁed related terms for
these keywords: “Embedded Software”, “Quality Attribute”,
“Non-functional Requirement”, “Non-functional property”,
and “Quality Requirement”. We considered the plural form
of all keywords and related terms. Besides that, only pa-
pers written in English were considered in our systematic
review, since it is the most common language in scientiﬁc
papers. We used the Boolean operator OR to link the main
terms and their synonyms; furthermore, all these terms were
combined using the Boolean operator AND. The ﬁnal search
string was: (“Embedded System” OR “Embedded Systems”
OR “Embedded Software”) AND (“Quality Model” OR
“Quality Models” OR “Quality Attribute” OR “Quality
Attributes” OR “Non-functional Requirement” OR “Non-
functional Requirements” OR “Non-functional Property”
OR “Non-functional Properties” OR “Quality Requirement”
OR “Quality Requirements”).
In addition to the search string, we also deﬁned a control
for our systematic review. For this, we considered two
previously known studies [7], [8]. They were our baseline to
check whether our search string was properly deﬁned, i.e.,
if our string was able to ﬁnd these studies in the publication
databases. Moreover, in order to select the most adequate
databases for our search, we considered the following criteria
discussed in [10]: content update (publications are regularly
updated); availability (full text of the primary study is avail-
able); quality of results (accuracy of the results obtained by
the search); and versatility export (since much information
is obtained through the search, a mechanism to export the
results is required). The selected databases to our systematic
review were: ACM [11], IEEE Xplore [12], ScienceDirect
[13], Scopus [14], Springer [15], and Web of Science [16].
According to Dybå et al. [17] and Kitchenham et al. [18],
these publication databases are the most relevant sources.
Aiming at not missing any important primary study, we also
considered the related works presented in the reference list
of the primary studies selected by our systematic review.
3) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: The selection crite-
ria are used to evaluate each primary study obtained from
the publication databases. These criteria make it possible
to include primary studies that are relevant to answer the
research questions and exclude studies that do not answer
them. Our inclusion criteria (IC) were:
• IC1: The primary study presents a quality model for
embedded systems;
524

ICSEA 2013 : The Eighth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

• IC2: The primary study reports the use of a quality
model for embedded systems;
• IC3: The primary study proposes a set of quality
attributes; and
• IC4: The primary study is an empirical study that has
as outcome a set of quality attributes.
The established exclusion criteria (EC) were:
• EC1: The study does not propose or report QM&QA
for embedded systems;
• EC2: The study is a previous version of a more
complete paper about the same research; and
• EC3: The primary study is a table of contents, short
course description, copyright form or conference pro-
ceedings.
4) Data Extraction and Synthesis Method: In order to
extract data, we planned to build data extraction tables
related to each research question. These tables will syn-
thesize the results to facilitate drawing conclusions. During
the extraction process, the data of each primary study will
be independently extracted by two reviewers. In case of
disagreements, discussions will be conducted. To summarize
and describe the set of data, statistical synthesis method and
meta-analysis will be applied.
B. Phase 2 - Conduction
In this phase, we adapted the generic search string deﬁned
in the Phase 1 according to the speciﬁcity of each publication
database. The search of primary studies was then performed
by searching for all primary studies that matched the adapted
search string. After removing primary studies indexed by
two or more publication databases, 308 primary studies
remained for analysis. Initially, the title and abstract of each
study were read and the selection criteria were applied. A
total of 15 studies were selected for further reading. These
studies were read in full by two reviewers and the selection
criteria were again applied. As a result, nine primary studies
were selected for the data extraction. Besides, we looked for
the related work (i.e., the main references) of each primary
study read in full. Among all related works evaluated, we
selected two relevant primary studies that had not been
previously identiﬁed [19], [20]. Finally, a set of 11 studies
was selected as the most relevant to our systematic review.
Table I shows all primary studies included, their publi-
cation year, and references (Ref.). It is important to notice
that only three primary studies found propose quality models
for embedded systems (i.e., they were included by IC1).
Therefore, most of studies are dedicated to provide sets
of quality attributes for embedded systems. Moreover, it is
possible to observe that 73% (i.e., 8/11) of the studies were
published in the last ﬁve years, which might indicate an
increasing interest for this topic of research.
C. Phase 3 - Reporting
This phase presents the analytical results of our systematic
review. Data extraction and synthesis of knowledge consid-
ering each research question are discussed below.

1) RQ1 - Research Question 1: This research question
aims at understanding how QM&QA for embedded sys-
tems have been deﬁned. For this, we have investigated
which sources of information are most used to develop the
QM&QA and whether they are deﬁned in a descriptive or
prescriptive way. Descriptive primary studies depict how
quality has been addressed in systems of this domain. On the
other hand, prescriptive primary studies introduce guidelines
of how quality should be addressed in embedded systems.
Table II summarizes the sources of information and methods
of development used in each primary study.
We noticed that most of QM&QA for embedded systems
(54.5%) were developed from documental analysis, i.e., us-
ing information collected in documents associated to existing
systems, such as system requirement documents. Moreover,
personal experience and literature reviews were considered
in 36.4% and 27.3% of the primary studies, respectively.
Developed systems, standards and regulations, interviews,
questionnaires, existing software architectures, and on-going
projects were also considered in at least one primary study.
Furthermore, it is possible to observe that there is no
predominance of prescriptive or descriptive studies. We also
identiﬁed that there is no correlation between the informa-
tion source and prescriptive/descriptive QM&QA. Thus, the
choice of information sources may be more related to the
context in which the model was deﬁned than the purpose
for what it was intended.
2) RQ2 - Research Question 2: This research question
investigates for which application areas QM&QA for embed-
ded systems have been developed. To answer this question,
we collected data regarding the application areas of the
embedded systems, as well as the approaches used to design
these systems. We also collected data to discover whether
QM&QA were designed to critical embedded systems. Ta-
ble III summarizes the obtained results.
Regarding this research question, it is possible to point
out that several studies (S5, S6, S9, and S10) are concerned
about quality of embedded systems in general, i.e, without
a speciﬁc application area. QM&QA for embedded systems
for the transportation area can also be highlighted (S3, S7,
and S11). With respect to the design approaches, we found
out that they are often related to component-based embedded
systems, as presented in studies S3, S4, S6, S9, and S11. It

is also possible to identify QM&QA that are not limited to
a speciﬁc type design approach, such as presented in studies
S2, S5, and S10. Furthermore, we found out that most of
primary studies (nine out of 11) are dedicated to critical
embedded systems. This result was expected and reinforces
the importance and interest in the quality of this type of
systems.
3) RQ3 - Research Question 3: This research question
investigates on the evaluation of the QM&QA for embed-
ded systems available in the literature. For answering this
question, we collected data about the level of evidence
used in the evaluation, the number of systems in which
these QM&QA have been applied, and whether they are
in actual use or not. The following levels of evidence were
considered: industrial evidence (i.e., actual use of QM&QA
in industry), industrial studies (i.e., QM&QA developed
in the industry); academic studies (e.g., controlled lab ex-
periments or evidence based results); expert opinions or
observations; demonstration or working out toy examples;
and no evidence. Table IV presents the information about the
evaluation of the QM&QA for embedded systems. Studies
that do not report whether the proposal is in actual use or
not are represented as Not Reported (NR).
It is possible to observe that only three studies (S4, S8,
and S11) present QM&QA that were evaluated through

their application in embedded systems. Five studies were
evaluated using expert opinion (S3, S6, and S7) or academic
studies (S2 and S10). Three studies do no present informa-
tion about their evaluation (S1, S5, and S9). However, it is
worth highlighting that QM&QA proposed in S1 and S9 are
descriptive studies that emerged from personal experience
(see Table II) and may not need an explicit evaluation.
Besides that, it can be noticed that, among the QM&QA
evaluated using embedded systems, only primary study S4
reports its application at least twice. Regarding the adoption
of QM&QA, only S1 and S4 studies indicate that their pro-
posals are currently supporting the evaluation of embedded
systems. The other included studies do not present evidences
about their current adoption. Despite these QM&QA may be
in actual use, no publication reporting this information was
found in our systematic review.
4) RQ4 - Research Question 4: This research question in-
vestigates the main quality attributes for embedded systems.
Table V presents the main quality attributes identiﬁed in this
review and the primary studies that address these attributes.
We identiﬁed 18 major quality attributes related to em-
bedded systems. These attributes are those addressed by at
least 25% of the primary studies, i.e., three or more studies.
It is observed that the main quality attributes are related to
maintainability and reliability. This result seems coherent,
since an embedded system involves the coordinated project
of software and hardware. Besides that, the maintainability
is a challenging issue of the development of this type of

systems. Embedded systems are also often used in safe-
critical context and, therefore, they must be reliable. Most of
studies also address security, safety, functionality, efﬁciency
(i.e., efﬁcient consumption of hardware resources, such as
processor, memory, and battery), portability (i.e., ability
of being transferred and used in a different environment),
and testability as important quality attributes. Other quality
attributes addressed by less the half of the studies were: per-
formance, usability (i.e., ability of being understood, learned,
conﬁgured, and used), availability, extensibility, reusability,
fault tolerance, recoverability (repairability), interoperability,
and ﬂexibility.
III. QUALITY ASSESSMENT
In order to analyze the quality of the included primary
studies, we developed a checklist containing seven questions
based on the quality assessment created by Kitchenham et
al. [28]. Table VI presents the quality assessment criteria and
the scores obtained by the primary studies. For each question
in the checklist, the following scale-point was applied: the
study fully meets a given quality criterion (1 point), the study
meets the quality criterion in some extent (0.5 point), and the
study does not meet this quality criterion (0 point). Thus, the
total quality score fell into the range between: 0 - 1.0 (very
poor); 1.1 - 2.0 (poor); 2.1 - 3.0 (fair); 3.1 - 4.0 (average), 4.1
- 5.0 (good), 5.1 - 6.0 (very good), and 6.1 - 7.0 (excellent).
It can be noticed that eight out of 11 studies were considered
as having good quality. On the other hand, two studies were
considered as having poor quality. Despite of that, these
two studies were not excluded from this review because
we were interested in covering all publications available
in the research area. It is also important to highlight that
studies considered as having poor quality did not present
information about evaluation, limitation of their results, and
perspectives of future research.
IV. BRIEF DISCUSSION
After carrying out the systematic review, a ﬁrst ﬁnding
was that QM&QA are often deﬁned using two or more
different sources of information. This fact may evidence
that the establishment of QM&QA is a complex task and
requires broad knowledge about the domain. This review
also points out that, among the studies that propose generic
QM&QA (i.e., QM&QA that can be applied to any type of
embedded system), only study S9 is described in the format
of a quality model (i.e., included by IC1), but it is considered
to have a poor quality. Therefore, contributions that provide
widely accepted quality models for embedded systems are
still necessary.
In parallel, QM&QA could be used as means to con-
duct quality evaluation of embedded systems. This review
also pointed out that few QM&QA were evaluated using
evidences obtained in the industry or in real embedded
systems. Thus, more studies reporting experiences of eval-
uating embedded systems might increase the reliability of
the QM&QA and also provide important feedback to im-
prove them. In this scenario, this topic of research can be
considered as a promising one and results of this review can
be used as a starting point. Notice that the set of attributes
can also be different, including a different distribution, if we
considered speciﬁc application areas, such as automotive and
robotics. Finally, we identiﬁed that only study S11 proposes
a set of metrics related to its QM&QA. Therefore, we believe
that the identiﬁcation of metrics associated to QM&QA is
also an important topic of research, and it can contribute to
provide some measurement to the development of embedded
systems.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The adoption of quality models and the identiﬁcation of
most important quality attributes can contribute to improve
the quality, which is so needed in embedded systems. In
this perspective, the main contribution of this work is to
present a detailed state of the art on the QM&QA available
in literature, the way they were deﬁned and evaluated, and
the main quality attributes addressed by them. For this, we
conducted the steps of a systematic review. As future work,
we intend to make a more speciﬁc investigation of this
research area, for instance, to identify metrics associated to
each quality attribute. Furthermore, we intend to consolidate
the results of this systematic review in a general quality
model for embedded systems, aiming at contributing to a
more effective development of such systems.
