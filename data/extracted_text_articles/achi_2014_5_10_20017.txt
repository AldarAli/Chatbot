Abstract — This work presents a new methodology for 
designing user tests that evaluate the impact of different Web 
accessibility barriers affecting people with disabilities. The 
methodology is based on several steps that help in the creation 
of Web content to be tested by users with specific disabilities. 
Several user tests have been carried out to check the validity of 
the steps defined in the methodology. The paper includes the 
methodology used, a case study and the key findings of the 
analysis. The results of the case study have been positive as the 
objective of providing a methodology has facilitated the 
creation of an evaluation environment: selection of the 
elements to be evaluated and the tasks to be performed by 
users who carried out the test. As a conclusion, we can state 
that the introduced methodology helps to include elements in 
user tests and optimizes the time and available resources 
needed for the preparation of an accessibility test.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
A large number of people have difficulty accessing the 
Web. The World Report on Disability [1] estimates that 
between 15% and 19% of the population have some type of 
disability, a substantial group of consumers that should not 
be ignored. However, current accessibility involves a 
compromise between ideal accessibility and available 
resources. As in classical usability, it is common sense to 
place more emphasis on problems with greater impact and/or 
that recur more frequently [2]. Therefore, it is important to 
understand the difficulties caused by different elements when 
experienced by specific user groups, in order to prioritize 
actions taken to improve accessibility for them. Technical 
accessibility, the most widespread, attempts to place all users 
and all contexts on the same level, but usability –and 
accessibility– are contextual and depend upon the type of 
user [3]. User testing is recommended to ensure the 
accessibility of a Web site. These tests provide quantitative 
and qualitative data about real users that perform real tasks 
with a product [4]. 
In this paper, we focus on web context and propose a 
new methodology that facilitates the creation of a user test 
environment (elements to be evaluated, tasks to be 
performed) adapted to the characteristics of users with 
disabilities. In this sense, preparing a user test environment 
aimed at assessing specific barriers for disabled users can be 
quite an effort for the evaluator preparing the test: selecting 
barriers affecting each disability to evaluate, choosing 
specific HTML elements that incorporate the barriers and 
adequate coding of the elements, deciding how to approach 
the tasks to be performed, etc.  
Without a systematically automated process, there is no 
way to ensure that the tools used for proper testing 
incorporate all the elements to guarantee adequate results. 
Additionally, it hardly ensures an adequate and exhaustive 
list of tasks to run during the test.  
Moreover, accessibility barriers cannot be generalized: 
accessibility barriers related to mobility-impaired users are 
different from those associated with visually impaired users, 
and in each specific case the evaluation environment (Web 
site/s) should incorporate different elements to ensure the 
validity of the test. 
Hence, accessibility evaluators should raise several 
questions when designing experimental Web user tests for 
people with disabilities: 
 
To which group do my main users belong? 
 
What elements are especially problematic for this 
group? 
 
What tasks should be performed by users on my Web 
site to assess the impact of problematic elements? 
 
What Web content should be added to the Web site to 
allow the user group to carry out tasks? 
To address these questions and explain the methodology, 
the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the 
related work. The methodology is introduced in Section 3. 
Section 4 presents a case study and the last section presents 
the conclusions of the work.

RELATED WORK 
By barrier, we mean any condition that prevents the 
execution of an objective by users with disabilities. 
Initiatives such as the "Accessible Project" [5] and the 
"Barrier Walkthrough" [6]have studied the most problematic 
Web barriers affecting different profiles of users with 
disabilities (visual, low vision, hearing, cognitive and 
103

Step 3. Select barriers to 
test 
Step 1. Select the 
disability profile 
Step 2. Select HTML 
elements 
Step 4. Select the specific 
tasks to evaluate 
Step 5. Generate the Web 
content to test 
motor). It is important to point out that disabled users 
interact with the Web in different ways [7] and it is 
necessary to analyze their characteristics in order to 
understand which barriers cause a greater impact in each 
case. 
There are methodologies, proposed in [8], [9] and [10] 
based on the importance of user testing for developing 
software, but they do not take into account the process of 
preparing the necessary environment for carrying out the 
user test. In this sense, the methodology we propose provides 
a proper framework. 
Various methodologies are followed for evaluating the 
accessibility of a Web site [11], [12]. Traditionally, 
accessibility evaluation is carried out by applying the Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [13] [14], or its 
ISO equivalent, ISO/IEC 40500:2012 [15]. However, 
WCAG guidelines are primarily a legal instrument and, as 
several authors point out [16] [17] [18], compliance with 
them does not guarantee 100% accessibility of the Web site. 
Moreover, according to some authors [19] [20], WCAG 2.0 
guidelines do not address all the needs of users  for accessing 
content. Consequently, although WCAG guidelines provide 
an important starting point, conducting user tests is very 
important for detecting errors to as great an extent as 
possible [20] [4]. 
Given the importance that WCAG guidelines have 
gained, several tools have been developed to automate the 
evaluation of Web accessibility [22]. However, not all 
elements can be evaluated automatically, given that it is 
necessary to complement the evaluation with a manual 
review.  
In general, automatic accessibility evaluation tools 
provide result reports that are too technical, making it 
difficult for people who are untrained in accessibility to 
understand them. There are some examples that make 
accessibility evaluation available to the non-expert evaluator, 
helping that person to understand WCAG guidelines and to 
create Web content. Accessibility Evaluation Assistance 
(AEA) [23] [24] is a tool that shows the aspects that must be 
taken into account for applying WCAG guidelines, thus 
facilitating the evaluation process. Accessibility Example 
Generator (AEG) [25] is another tool that assists in the 
process of creating examples of both accessible and 
inaccessible Web pages.  
Related to all this, the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) 
of the W3C has two projects that work with aspects related 
to Web content source code: (i) the project WCAG 2.0 Test 
Samples Repository [26] features accessible and inaccessible 
code samples within the context of WCAG 2.0 guidelines; 
and (ii) the project "Before and After Demonstration" [27] is 
a set of web pages showing examples of accessibility 
barriers. 
In this sense, the methodology we propose is focused on 
minimizing the effort of creating the user test environment 
aimed at people lacking a background in accessibility in 
order to adapt content to the needs of an organization. The 
tool automates the methodology, optimizes the time and 
resources needed to create the HTML elements to be tested 
and streamlines a process which is costly if done manually. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The proposed methodology has the following key 
strengths: 
 
To optimize the effort for preparing the user test 
environment: evaluators can reduce the time needed 
to create code or to analyze the guidelines relevant to 
their case. 
 
To reduce the time to prepare and generate the user 
test environment: evaluators can minimize the 
creation time of the test environment by using a tool 
that automates the methodology.  
 
To ensure the inclusion of all the HTML elements to 
be tested from a selection of profiles and HTML 
elements, specific accessibility barriers are listed for 
assessment, as well as tasks likely to cause access 
problems for previously selected user profiles. 
 
Ease of use: accessibility related information is 
presented in a simple and understandable manner for 
users without prior knowledge of accessibility. 
 
Below (Figure 1) is an outline of the methodology 
presented. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Outline of the methodology presented. 
A. Description of the methodology  
The methodology uses and lists several data sources: 
disabilities, Web page elements, accessibility barriers and 
WCAG guidelines, which are put together to obtain a list of 
tasks to run on a web page with accessible and inaccessible 
source code. The methodology consists of five steps in 
which the evaluator selects the user profile of the test (step 
1), HTML elements that present problems to the selected 
user (step 2), barriers to testing (step 3) and specific tasks to 
perform in the test (step 4) to finally obtain a source code 
with a web implementation that collects all aspects of the 
previous selections (step 5). The evaluator has the code that 
best fits the needs of the user test or that best performs the 
test using all the information resources generated. 
1) Step 1: Select the disability profile: In the first step, 
the characteristics of the user who will participate in the test 
104

are selected. The user profiles offered by the International 
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 
[28] were considered, but we thought that it was more 
appropriate to group the characteristics into a total of four 
groups further split by the severity of disability. 
1. People with mobility impairments: 1a) mild and 
moderate limitation and 1b) severe limitation.  
2. People with cognitive impairments: 2a) mild and 
moderate limitation and 2b) severe limitation. 
3. People with hearing impairments: 3a) mild and 
moderate limitation and 3b) severe limitation or total 
deafness. 
4. People with visual impairments: 4a) low vision, 4b) 
severe limitation or blindness and 4c) color-blind. 
 
2) Step 2: Select HTML elements: All HTML elements 
that are of interest to test and that cause some problem for 
the users of the profiles chosen in step 1, are selected. 
 
3) Step 3: Select barriers to test: The accessibility 
barriers to be tested are selected in the next step. Only the 
barriers that cause problems are listed according to the 
HTML elements and the user profiles previously chosen. 
We have used the following information sources to obtain 
the list of barriers: the accessible project [5], which lists the 
disability accessibility barriers that most directly have an 
impact and the work of Cunningham [29], which lists the 
most problematic HTML elements for each type of 
disability. 
Keep in mind that the same barrier can affect one or more 
of the various disabilities. 
 
4) Step 4: Select the tasks to evaluate: The possible 
tasks to perform in the user tests according to previous 
selections are chosen in this step of the methodology. As a 
barrier can affect one or more disabilities, the principle of 
the task is different for each affected group. For example, 
the barrier "moving content" is perceived differently 
depending on whether the user has visual or cognitive 
disabilities. Therefore, an adequate approach for participants 
with disabilities is essential. 
 
5) Step 5: Generate the Web content to test: The last 
step of the methodology is to obtain the Web content 
(accessible and inaccessible), which will be incorporated 
into the pages to test, in keeping with the previously 
selected parameters.  
This may not be the final code since its aim is to inspire 
and facilitate the task of creating a test page by the team 
responsible for carrying out the user test. 
The methodology also offers information on how to 
evaluate the accessibility barriers in order to supplement the 
information given to a new evaluator. 
IV. 
CASE STUDY 
In the following section, we show a case study that 
implements the previously proposed methodology through a 
mock-up of the tool. This case study was based on an 
evaluation by the authors of the paper [31], rather than with 
actual evaluators with no technical knowledge. The 
examples of web pages were inspired by W3C WAI and 
provided by [32]. 
It begins with the premise of running a user test for 
people with severe visual impairments or blindness and to 
find out  the difficulties that a contact form can cause.  
A. Steps of methodology 
Below are the steps to be followed: 
1) Step 1: Select the disability profile: A user test is 
prepared, adapting it to a specific user profile. As an 
example, the following profile is selected: People with 
severe visual impairments or blindness. To empathize with 
these users and to better understand the difficulties they 
encounter, a profile of a user with the selected disability is 
displayed.

2) Step 2: Select the HTML elements: The elements on 
which the test is focussed are selected.TABLE I. shows a 
list of all problematic elements that affect users with severe 
visual impairment. Each element is accompanied by related 
WCAG guidelines. This information is only needed in order 
to be able to list different information groups internally, and 
no information would be displayed in the user interface. In 
our case we selected the item "Form" to test the particular 
difficulties users may have in sending a contact form. To 
facilitate the communication of the Web element, each 
element is accompanied by an HTML example that may be 
incorporated into the test (See Figure 2).

3) Step 3: Select barriers to test: With the previously 
selected information the accessibility barriers to be tested 
are shown. As a specific example, TABLE II. shows the 
barriers related to visually impaired users (step 1) and the 
form elements (step 2).

Verification of the barrier 
Manual verification:  
To create the form we suggest the use of a form-builder tool. 
To validate the form code we suggest using the WAT tool: it 
displays the text fields that are identified with labels and IDs in 
the same form. 
 
B. Create the user test environment 
Once the HTML elements are known, as well as the 
specific Web content to be added to the website, the next 
step is to proceed with its creation and implementation. At 
the end of the process, a summary is shown (See TABLE V. 
). The evaluator can embed an obtained code in a simple web 
page and start the test.  
The authors of this article have checked the validity of 
the proposed methodology by creating several user tests 
aimed at people with cognitive disabilities [30] and visual 
disabilities [31]. By following the methodology, there is a 
reduction in the time needed for creating the user test 
environment and an improvement in the effectiveness of 
preparing the test environment to include the most 
problematic elements for users with disabilities. The studies 
carried out by the authors were focused on learning the 
mental state of users with disabilities as they interacted with 
each barrier to accessibility. It was necessary to be very 
precise when creating the HTML files to be evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents a new methodology that optimizes 
the design of a user test environment for people with 
disabilities. This methodology is shown through a case 
study. The proposed methodology is based on following a 
series of specific steps in order to provide suitable content 
and tasks for carrying out a user test for people with 
disabilities. The evaluators can conduct the user test without 
specific knowledge of accessibility, the methodology 
minimizes the effort needed for creating such an 
environment adapted to the specific needs of the 
organization. The methodology is accompanied by a tool that 
automatically performs some of the steps and speeds up 
implementation, thus reducing time and costs in creating the 
right environment for user tests. In the case study, with only 
five selections (and five mouse clicks) the evaluator has a 
suggestion of task, and the code of both accessible and non-
accessible implementations. 
The authors followed this methodology with users with 
cognitive disabilities [30]. As a conclusion we found that 
using the proposed methodology facilitates the inclusion of 
elements to be tested and optimizes the time and available 
resources used in the preparation of the test. 
In a complementary manner, the methodology can also 
help webmasters to be aware of the most problematic 
elements (barriers) of a specific disability and with this 
knowledge, 
they 
are 
more 
aware 
of 
accessibility 
requirements in a Web page.
