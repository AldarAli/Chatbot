Abstract‚ÄîThis paper proposes a novel spectrum sensing
scheme for dynamic trafÔ¨Åc circumstances, where a Primary User
(PU) signal may randomly depart or arrive during the sensing
period, and thus, the conventional schemes developed under the
assumption of the static trafÔ¨Åc circumstances perform poorly. In
the proposed scheme, a sensing period is partitioned into several
sub-periods and the Ô¨Ånal decision on the existence of the PU
signal is made by combining sensing decisions during each sub-
period. From numerical results, it is conÔ¨Årmed that the proposed
scheme has an improved detection performance compared with
those of the conventional schemes.

INTRODUCTION
The spectrum sensing determines the existence of a Pri-
mary User (PU) signal on frequency bands and thus enables
the Cognitive Radio (CR) to allocate a vacant frequency band
to a Secondary User (SU) without interfering the PU [1][2].
So far, most spectrum sensing techniques [3]-[5] have been
developed under the assumption of static trafÔ¨Åc circumstances
where the PU is present or absent during the whole sensing
period [6]. In practical wireless communications, however, the
PU trafÔ¨Åc could be dynamic, i.e., the PU could arrive at or
depart from the frequency band in the middle of a sensing
period randomly, and in such a dynamic trafÔ¨Åc circumstance,
the conventional spectrum sensing techniques where the PU
trafÔ¨Åc is assumed to be static would perform poorly [5].
An interesting spectrum sensing scheme [7] was proposed
for dynamic trafÔ¨Åc circumstances, where the dynamic be-
havior of the PU signals is modeled as a Poisson random
process and an improvement in detection performance over
the conventional schemes was shown. However, the scheme
of [7] requires additional information including the arrival
and departure rates of PU signals and the performance im-
provement is not signiÔ¨Åcant especially in low Signal-to-Noise
Ratios (SNRs) of practical interest. In this paper, we propose
a novel spectrum sensing scheme based on partitioning of
a sensing period, where a sensing period is partitioned into
several sub-periods and the Ô¨Ånal decision on the existence of a
PU signal is made by combining sensing decisions during each
sub-period. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme provides a better detection performance than those of
the conventional schemes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the received signal model of the CR systems in the
dynamic trafÔ¨Åc circumstances. In Section III, we explain the
proposed spectrum sensing scheme based on sensing period
partitioning. The proposed scheme is conÔ¨Årmed to perform
better than the conventional ones in Section IV, and Ô¨Ånally,
Section V concludes the paper.

SYSTEM MODEL
In the dynamic trafÔ¨Åc circumstances, the spectrum sensing
problem can be modeled as a binary hypothesis testing problem
with the null hypothesis H0 and the alternative hypothesis H1:
H0 : y[n] =
{
x[n]+w[n] for n = 1, 2, ..., J0,
w[n]
for n = J0+1, J0+2, ..., N,
(1)
and
H1 : y[n] =
{
w[n]
for n = 1, 2, ..., J1,
x[n]+w[n] for n = J1+1, J1+2, ..., N,
(2)
where y[n] is the nth sample of the received signal, x[n] is the
nth sample of the PU signal, w[n] is the nth additive white
Gaussian noise sample, N is the number of observed samples,
and the hypothesis H0 (H1) represents that a PU signal is
present (absent) on the frequency band at the beginning of a
sensing period and then the PU signal departs from (arrives at)
the band between the J0th (J1th) and the (J0+1)th ((J1+1)th)
samples. In this paper, we assume that the departure or arrival
of PU signals follows a Poisson random process and occurs
only once in the sensing period, as in [7].

PROPOSED SPECTRUM SENSING SCHEME
A. Test Statistics
To solve the hypothesis testing problem in the dynamic
trafÔ¨Åc circumstances, Ô¨Årst, we partition a sensing period com-
posed of N observed samples into K sub-periods with N/K
samples each, where N is assumed to be divisible by K and
a set of samples in the kth sub-period is denoted by
Gk = {y[n]}k(N/K)
n = 1+(k‚àí1)N/K.
(3)
Then, we perform energy detection to determine the existence
of a PU signal during each sub-period with a threshold ŒªG
predetermined by a given false alarm probability. Thus, the test
statistic TGk corresponding to the kth sub-period is obtained
as
TGk =
k(N/K)
‚àë
n = 1+(k‚àí1)N/K
|y[n]|2 , k = 1, 2, 3, ..., K.
(4)
Comparing TGk with ŒªG, Ô¨Ånally, we decide the existence of
the PU signal during the kth sub-period:
TGk
D1, Gk
>
<
D0, Gk
ŒªG, for k = 1, 2, ... , K,
(5)
where D1, Gk (D0, Gk) represents that the PU is present (ab-
sent) during the kth sub-period.
If a PU signal arrives at (departs from) the frequency band
at the end of a sensing period in a dynamic trafÔ¨Åc circumstance,
the probability that the whole energy in a sensing period

exceeds the threshold would be small (large) even if the PU
signal is actually present (absent) at the end of the sensing
period, and thus, the conventional spectrum sensing techniques
using simply the whole energy during a sensing period would
yield a wrong decision on the existence of the PU signal. To
solve this problem, we use the sensing decisions from K sub-
periods as follows. Depending on the presence or absence of
the PU signal in each sub-period, Ô¨Årstly, we represents the kth
sensing decision xGk as 1 or 0, i.e.,
xGk =
{
1 when TGk > ŒªG
0 when TGk ‚â§ ŒªG

for k = 1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , K ‚àí 1. Using the majority rule, subsequently,
we make an intermediate-decision as
K‚àí1
‚àë

(7)
where the intermediate decision D1, M (D0, M) represents
that the PU is present (absent) during the Ô¨Årst K ‚àí 1
sub-periods and it is combined with the sensing decision
D1, GK
or D0, GK
corresponding to the Kth sub-period,
yielding the Ô¨Ånal decision on the existence of the PU sig-
nal. We have four different combinations (D1, M, D0, GK),
(D0, M, D0, GK), (D0, M, D1, GK), and (D1, M, D1, GK) as
shown in Figure 1 and it is easy to see that the hypotheses
H0 and H1 are Ô¨Ånally declared for (D1, M, D0, GK) and
(D0, M, D0, GK) and for (D0, M, D1, GK), respectively. On
the other hand, as shown in Figure 2, we have two cases
corresponding to H0 (Figure 2(a)) and H1 (Figure 2(b)),
respectively, for (D1, M, D1, Gk). Thus, the Ô¨Ånal decision is
made by comparing the average of the test statistics {TGk}K‚àí1
k=1
with the test statistic TGK of the Kth sub-period for those
cases. Finally, the decision rule can be summarized as

In other words, in case of (D1, M, D1, Gk), the proposed
scheme compares the TGK with average of {TGk}K‚àí1
k=1 . In
other cases, the proposed scheme decides the existence of the
PU signal based on the detection result of sub-period GK.
B. Distribution of Test Statistics
In this section, we derive the probability density function
(PDF) of the test statistic TGk. Assuming that the additive
white Gaussian noise samples {w[n]}N
n=1 have zero-mean and
unit-variance, we can easily see that TGk follows the non-
central chi-square distribution

mances of the proposed and conventional [3][7] schemes in
terms of the detection probability deÔ¨Åned as Pr(H1|H1). For
simulations, N is set to 200 and the SNR is deÔ¨Åned as œÉ2

s and œÉ2
n are variances of the PU signal and noise,
respectively. For the scheme of [7], the product of the arrival
or departure rate and the sensing period is set to 0.1.
Figure 3 shows the detection probabilities as a function
of the SNR when the false alarm rate Pfa is 0.05 and
K = 2, where we can clearly observe that the proposed scheme
offers a detection probability improvement over the conven-
tional schemes at low SNRs of practical interest (‚àí20 dB <
SNR < ‚àí5 dB). Although the detection probability of the
proposed scheme is a little bit lower than those of the conven-
tional schemes at high SNRs, it should be noted that all of the
schemes perform well at high SNRs, and so, the difference in
performance between the proposed and conventional schemes
is insigniÔ¨Åcant.

(ROC) curves of the proposed and conventional spectrum

sensing schemes when the SNR = -10 dB and K = 2.
From the Ô¨Ågure, the proposed scheme is found to offer a
ROC performance improvement over the conventional schemes
when the false alarm probability is smaller than 0.25, which is
a practical range of the false alarm probability in spectrum
sensing. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, it is observed that that the proposed
scheme has a larger detection probability (a smaller false alarm
probability) than those of the conventional schemes for a Ô¨Åxed
false alarm (detection) probability.
The superiority of the proposed scheme over the conven-
tional ones shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 stems from the
fact that the proposed scheme makes the Ô¨Ånal decision on the
existence of the PU by giving a more weight to the sensing
decision from the last sub-period unlike the conventional

schemes where all of the sensing decisions from sub-periods
have the same weight.
As the value of K increases, the sensing decision from the
last sub-period would recognize the existence and nonexistence
of the PU signal after a given sensing period more exactly;
however, the reliability of the sensing decision from each sub-
period would be worse, since the number of samples used
during each sub-period decreases. From this observation, we
can see that there exists an optimum value of K. Figure 5
shows the detection probabilities of the proposed scheme as
a function of K when SNR = -12 dB and -10dB, and Pfa =
0.05. In this simulation, N is set to a multiple of K that is the
closest to 200 when N is indivisible by K. From the Ô¨Ågure,
we can observe that 7 is the optimum value of K when SNR
is -10dB, and 10 is the optimum value of K when SNR is
-12dB. In addition, it is seen from Figure 6 that the optimum
value Kopt decreases as the value of the SNR increases and
eventually becomes saturated. This is because more samples
are required in each sensing period to maintain the reliability
of the sensing decision from each sensing period. It should be
noted that the optimum number of the sub-periods is not over
10 in the SNR ranges (-12 dB ‚àº 0 dB) of practical interest, i.e.,
the proposed scheme does not involve a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in
complexity. Thus, the proposed scheme should be applicable
to real-time applications.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a novel spectrum sensing
scheme for dynamic trafÔ¨Åc environments. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we have
Ô¨Årst partitioned a sensing period into several sub-periods and
then have performed energy detection during each sub-period.
Finally, we have obtained a decision rule on the existence of
a PU signal by combining the sensing decisions from sub-
periods. From numerical results, we have conÔ¨Årmed that the
proposed scheme offers a noticeable performance improve-
ment, and also, have determined an optimum number of sub-
periods.
