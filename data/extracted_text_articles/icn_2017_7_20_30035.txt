Abstract—This paper presents the Clustered Inter-domain Proxy
Mobile Internet Protovol version 6 (CI-PMIPv6), an intra-domain
and inter-domain Distributed Mobility Management solution for
PMIPv6-based networks. It anticipates the exchange of mobile
node information for future handovers using a Distributed Hash
Table (DHT) structure. The main advantages of CI-PMIPv6 are:
to avoid the introduction of a single point of failure; to allow a fast
spread of information among network entities; to take advantage
of the execution of inter-domain handover-related operations
in parallel with the execution of intra-domain handover-related
operations; and to avoid generating bottlenecks. Results show
that, in the scenario studied, CI-PMIPv6 handover costs less
and suffers less latency and packet loss in comparison with
other schemes studied. Additionally, the values of goodput in
CI-PMIPv6 are greater.

INTRODUCTION
The evolution and widespread use of multimedia appli-
cations for mobile gadgets are the key factors for the rapid
growth in the use of mobile networks. Mobile data trafﬁc grew
60% between Q1 2015 and Q1 2016 [1]. Additionally, the
emergence of mobile devices connected to vehicles expand the
possibilities for use-case scenarios. Thus, efﬁcient solutions
for mobility management are a relevant and contemporary
concern. Binding updates and tunneling setup are the main
operations in IP mobility management and, therefore, the
applicability of the related protocol may well be determined
by how efﬁcient these are. The Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) Networking Working Group proposed the Proxy
Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol [2] mainly to resolve issues
related to the energy saving and high latency found in Mobile
IP (MIP). PMIPv6 introduces two types of entities: the Mobile
Access Gateway (MAG), which tracks the location of the
current Mobile Node (MN); and the Local Mobility Anchor
(LMA), which plays a similar role as the MIP’s Home Agent
in a local domain. Signaling between MAG and LMA is
responsible for updating the binding of the MN. Due to relying
on a non-mobile entity to keep track of the MN, PMIPv6
has lost the MIPv6 inter-domain feature. Studies have been
proposed on PMIPv6-based inter-domain solutions. However,
they still face problems related to centered entities and the high
cost of signaling.
In this paper, we propose CI-PMIPv6, a low cost and
a low latency intra-domain and inter-domain solution. CI-
PMIPv6 makes inter-domain handover possible by spreading
information on MNs efﬁciently among LMAs from the differ-
ent domains. Intra-domain handover is minimally changed to
send useful updates for future inter-domain handovers to those
LMAs. The main characteristics of CI-PMIPv6 are:
•
Distributed mobility management - LMAs from
each domain form a cluster, which runs a Kademlia-
based DHT [3] so as to spread information efﬁciently;
this avoids the use of global entities and, thus, avoids
creating single points of failure and performance bot-
tlenecks;
•
Network-based handover - CI-PMIPv6 maintains the
PMIPv6 advantage of reducing MNs’ consumption of
energy by avoiding host-based handover signaling and
processing overheads;
•
Reuse of existing PMIPv6 entities to exchange
inter-domain information - the compatibility with
PMIPv6 legacy systems is achieved; additionally,
MAGs may remain unaware of inter-domain mobility,
as in PMIPv6;
•
Anticipation of MN information for future han-
dovers - during the MN’s ongoing handover, its cur-
rent LMA proactively spreads the MN information
to neighbor LMAs in the cluster; this information
is needed for future inter-domain handovers and is
rapidly available to neighbors LMAs, thereby avoiding
time waste during such handovers due to the extra sig-
naling needed to request and obtain such information.
By using CI-PMIPv6 it is expected that low inter-domain
handover cost and latency will be achieved in comparison
with other PMIPv6-based inter-domain approaches cited in
the literature. The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows: CI-PMIPv6 is detailed in Section II. Related work is
presented in Section III. Section IV deals with evaluating the
performance of CI-PMIPv6 and the results achieved. Finally,
some conclusions are drawn and suggestions made for future
research studies in Section V.
II.
CI-PMIPV6
Figure 1 presents the CI-PMIPv6 architecture and shows
that the LMAs form a cluster. Each LMA contains a Kademlia
peer [3], and they are all connected to the same DHT. The
choice of a Kademlia-based Peer to Peer (P2P) architecture
for the cluster allows:
•
LMAs to communicate without placing them in a
hierarchy;
•
Mobility management without centralized entities,
thus avoiding bottlenecks and a single point of failure;

MAGs to abstract the existence of the cluster, which
is recognized only by the LMAs, thereby avoiding
unnecessary signaling between the local domain and
the core network;

The MN information is stored in its original LMA, which
forwards it to its neighbors. Each piece of information in the
cluster is represented in a <key, value> pair format, where:
•
The key is the MN original IP address;
•
The value is a triple of <MN current IP, MAG IP,
LMA IP>.
The <key, value> pairs are stored in peers whose nodeIDs
are the closest to the key. The nodeID, i.e., the identiﬁer of the
LMA as a Kademlia peer, is the LMA IP Address. Both keys
and nodeIDs are in the 128-bit space, as in every IPv6 address,
instead of in the 160-bit space as in the standard Kademlia
proposal [3].
The PING, STORE, FIND_NODE, FIND_VALUE primi-
tives, and the look-up procedures from Kademlia are valid for
network refresh, information storage, location of peers, and
information retrieval in the cluster. Selecting and registering
LMAs in the same DHT is done according to agreements
among engaged network operators. Likewise, CI-PMIPV6 in-
troduces the new primitives UPDATE and DELETE. They are
responsible for refreshing and removing <key, value> pairs
in the cluster. These primitives follow the same logic as in the
STORE primitive.
Figure 2 shows the signaling call ﬂow for intra-domain
handover. The ﬂow is similar to that proposed by the PMIPv6
standard. After triggering the layer-2 event, the previous MAG
(PMAG) exchanges deregistration signaling with the LMA.
The LMA waits for a ﬁxed interval before removing the
binding deﬁnitively. When visiting the new network, the MN
requests the new MAG (NMAG) for a route via the Internet
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Rtr Sol. message. Then,
the NMAG must request the LMA to update its binding table
with the messages Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy
Binding Acknowledgment (PBA). A tunnel is set up between
the LMA and NMAG to forward packets to the MN. The
NMAG, then, may send the ICMP Rtr Adv. message to
announce itself as the access router for that MN and then, the
handover is ﬁnished. CI-PMIPv6 adds to that ﬂow a call to the
cluster UPDATE message. Thus, whenever the MN associates
itself with a MAG, the cluster is updated. We assume that the
LMA runs both the update operation and the rest of the intra-
domain handover operation in parallel, e.g., the LMA runs both
of the operations simultaneously on different cores. These two
operations do not block each other. This is possible since the
spread of binding information in the cluster is not useful for
concluding the current intra-domain handover. MAGs do not
need to interact with the cluster and may proceed with the
handover normally. We further assume to be negligible the
amount of time spent performing a system call for starting
the update operation during intra-domain handovers. We also
assume that trafﬁc from the LMA to the cluster and trafﬁc
from the LMA to the MAGs can be kept isolated from
each other. For instance, each LMA might have exclusive
network interfaces and paths for communicating with MAGs.
In this manner, update messages ﬂowing from the LMA to
the cluster during intra-domain handovers cannot block (e.g.,
head-of-the-line blocking in network interfaces) or affect (e.g.,
increasing queuing delay) messages ﬂowing to the MAGs.
The MN information is proactively spread in the cluster. The
information will be necessary if there is ever an inter-domain
handover executed by the MN. The MN information is rapidly
available to neighbors LMAs in the cluster, thereby avoiding
the need for the extra signaling to request and obtain such
information during inter-domain handovers. Notice that CI-
PMIPv6 takes advantage of the execution of inter-domain
handover-related operations in parallel with the execution of
intra-domain handover-related operations.

Figure 3 shows the signaling call ﬂow for an inter-domain

domain handover. When detecting the link layer trigger, the
PMAG sends the Dereg.PBU message to the previous LMA
(PLMA). The PLMA sets a timer to wait for a period of time
before removing the binding information in order to prevent
a ping-pong effect. The MN enters the new domain and asks
NMAG for a new route. The NMAG sends a PBUNoProf

message to the LMA in its domain (new LMA - NLMA) to
inform it that the MN was not originally registered in that do-
main. The NLMA searches for the MN IP in its cluster history
and ﬁnds out that it originally belongs to the PLMA domain.
Then, NLMA responds to NMAG with a PBAProf message
containing the node information needed for registration. After
that, the NLMA sends a PBUInterdomain message to the
PLMA informing that the MN has entered a new domain. Thus,
PLMA refrains from removing the node binding. This must
happen before the timeout set aside for the removal in the
PLMA. It updates its own cluster history instead and sends an
UPDATE message to the cluster. In parallel, PLMA sends the
PBAInterdomain message to the NLMA informing it that
it is ready to redirect data trafﬁc to the NMAG in the new
domain. Thus, a tunnel is set up between PLMA and NMAG.
It is important to notice that PLMA remains the anchor entity
for the MN until the session ends. This simpliﬁes the process
of context switching.
The greatest CI-PMIPv6 opportunity for performance gains
comes from the anticipated knowledge that LMAs get from
cluster updates. The information obtained is useful in future
inter-domain handovers. CI-PMIPv6 avoids the MAG, which is
a local domain entity, to exchange handover signaling with the
core network, where the cluster is and also where the network
trafﬁc is more intense. Additionally, the fact that the PLMA
still manages communication after the inter-domain handover
eliminates the need to create an additional tunnel, a tunnel
between two LMAs. This avoids increasing the overhead of
tunneling.

RELATED WORK
Park et al. [4] present a scheme where the LMA from a
domain forwards the handover signaling to the LMA in another
domain to achieve inter-domain handover. There are neither
optimizations, nor additional entities. The consequence is the
introduction of an extra tunnel between those LMAs and a
duplicated number of signaling messages. Simulations with
QualNET measures packet loss and latency in comparison with
a scheme with PMIPv6/MIPv6 interworking. The authors state
that the proposal is better suited for scenarios where handover
is frequent. A similar proposal can be found in [5].
Zhong et al. propose the Enabling Inter PMIPv6 Domain
Handover (EIPMH) [6]. The authors introduce the Trafﬁc
Distributor (TD), an entity that redirects data to the LMA while
the MN is out of the original domain. The TDs are statically
conﬁgured and have knowledge about other TDs, their IP
preﬁxes, and mapping to the LMAs. In that proposal, the TD
is responsible for assigning preﬁxes to its MNs instead of
the LMA. The NLMA must send a query PBU_Forwading
to the PLMA to ﬁnd additional information about the MN
and the TD responsible for communicating with the Internet.
The TD also creates a tunnel to the NLMA. Also, there are
tunnels between LMAs and between the NLMA and the MAG.
The NS-2 simulation tool is used to evaluate performance.
Latency and throughput are compared to those found in I-
PMIP. However, the evaluation does not consider the extra
overhead derived from the tunnel between the TD and the
NLMA. The process of ﬁnding the PLMA, look-up for the
NLMA, and the change of MAGs are not considered.
In the Newman et al. proposal [7], the original LMA keeps
managing the node until the end of the session and exchanges
signaling with the MAG in the new domain during inter-
domain handover. That LMA is called the Session Mobility
Anchor (SMA). It is assumed that LMAs from different
domains already know each other and are physically close
to each other. To locate the MAG in the new domain, the
original LMA relies on a centralized entity called the Virtual
Mobility Anchor (VMA), which undertakes location updates
whenever a handover takes place. Hence, that solution faces the
same single point of failure issue as in [6]. The authors state
that I-PMIP sees to it that the policies of different domains
remain transparent, since there is no direct connection between
MAGs from different domains. Performance is evaluated by a
theoretical analysis, which compares the I-PMIP latency to the
latency found in MIP, and Hierarchical approaches for MIP
and PMIP. According to [7], I-PMIP has proven to be more
efﬁcient in the scenarios studied. Nyguyen and Bonnet propose
a similar solution in [8] focusing on routing optimizations.
Joe et al. [9] present an inter-domain approach based on an
architecture that considers special types of MAG: the Boundary
and Overlapping MAG (BMAG and OMAG, respectively). The
BMAG is associated with only one LMA, while the OMAG
is associated with more than one domain. Both are found in
regions where a domain ends and another domain begins. Also,
only one authentication entity for all domains is considered.
The presence of a gateway guarantees maintenance of the IP
address. The authors propose two solutions: Reactive and No-
Gap. In the Reactive solution, a path is created between CN
and PLMA and NLMA. The BMAG discovers a NLMA by
geographical locating it. The authors do not specify how the
look-up is done. The functionality of the BMAG is shared with
edge routers. A tunnel must be created between the gateway
and the NLMA, between LMAs, and between the PLMA and
the NMAG. In the No-Gap approach, the OMAG has infor-
mation from both domains and creates two simultaneous paths
as the MN enters its area. Thus, the MN receives redundant
information from both LMAs. Besides the PMIPv6 messages,
extra signaling is exchanged between the NLMA and the
gateway to conﬁrm and obtain additional information about
the MN. Additionally, the NLMA must authenticate the MN.
A tunnel must be created between the gateway and the NLMA,
and between the NLMA and the OMAG. The performance
evaluation compares the solution with MIPv6, Fast Handovers
for MIPv6, I.PMIPv6, and EIPMH by measuring handover
latency. What may well be noticed is that the Reactive mode

leads to greater overheads because of an additional tunnel in
comparison to the No-Gap model. According to the authors,
the No-Gap model is the most efﬁcient model. This is why this
paper gives more focus to the No-Gap solution, which has a
counterpart in [10].
Table I summarizes the differences between CI-PMIPv6
and other inter-domain solutions. The non-optimized approach
[4] has the greatest increase in extra signaling in comparison
with the original implementation of PMIPv6. Additionally,
there might be an overhead related to the addition of one more
IP header caused by the extra tunnel. These factors may be
responsible for a remarkable increase in latency during the
inter-domain handover. The advantage is the absence of new
entities and the compatibility with the PMIPv6 legacy system.
The EIPMH [6] introduces the TD - a centralized entity
- to manage the transition between two LMAs. The authors
acknowledge that there may be more than one distributor, each
of which is responsible for a coverage area. Nevertheless, the
handover between distributors is not covered by the authors.
Furthermore, the solution adds two extra tunnels and requires
changes in the infrastructure of the network.
I-PMIP [7] requires the existence of a centralized entity to
maintain MNs information. It creates a single point of failure
and causes changes in the network infrastructure. Addition-
ally, the extra tunnel added may increase the packet delivery
overhead.
The No-Gap solution [9] is one of the least expensive
solutions in terms of signaling overhead. However, it requires
changes in legacy border routers and generates redundant data
packets in the same MAG, coming from different LMAs.
CI-PMIPv6 appears to be the least expensive solution, since
the extra signaling necessary for inter-domain handover is one
of the lowest, when compared with other solutions. It does not
require extra tunnels and may interwork with PMIPv6 legacy
systems. The cluster messages do not add extra signaling costs
to the ongoing handover, since they are asynchronous and are
necessary only in future inter-domain handovers. Thus, we
expect that CI-PMIPv6 will have a smaller handover cost,
lower latency - as a consequence, less packet loss - and a
higher useful trafﬁc rate than the other proposals.
IV.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND RESULTS
In this section, CI-PMIPv6 performance is compared to
non-optimized, No-Gap, I-PMIP, and EIPMH solutions. The
evaluation is based on the analytical modeling presented in
[11] [12] [13]. This allows the cost of handover signaling in a
session, latency and the packet loss of one handover, and the
goodput in a session to be measured. We consider that mobile
devices are attached to vehicles in a highway during a voice
call (e.g., Skype). Inter-domain handover takes place as the
MN arrives at a new domain. The mobility pattern follows the
Fluid-Flow model [14]. That model considers average velocity
(v), the subnet and domain coverage areas (AM and AD,
respectively) and the subnet and domain perimeters (LM and
LD, respectively) as parameters. The direction of movement
is uniformly distributed in a range of 0 to 2π. Since this
experiment is interested in a vehicular scenario, the choice
of this model is very appropriate.
Two variables determine the dynamics of the MN: the
domain crossing rate (µD) and the subnet crossing rate (µM).
The former is the rate at which the node switches from one
domain to another. It is equivalent to the inter-domain handover
rate (Ng). The latter is the rate at which the node switches
from one subnet to another. The intra-domain handover rate
(Nl) considers a subnet crossing when this does not imply a
domain crossing. That is, Nl is the difference between µM
and µD. Their equations are as follows [11] [13]:
µM = vLM
πAM
,
(1)
Ng = µD = vLD
πAD
,
(2)
Nl = µM − µD.
(3)
Another important parameter to describe mobility of a node
is the Session-to-Mobility Ratio (SMR), which relates session
arrival rate and the subnet crossing rate as follows [11]:
SMR = λS
µM
.
(4)
If SMR is near zero, this means that the node has high
mobility. The higher the SMR, the more static the node.
The signaling cost is the number of handover signaling
messages, taking into consideration the distance in hops be-
tween two entities x and y, namely H(x−y), the underlying
media, and the processing cost. For each protocol message
sent, the signaling cost is (see [11])
Cx−y = α(H(x−y)) − β + PCy,
(5)
PCy = ς log N y
MN,
(6)
where the parameters α and β represent the coefﬁcients
of unity transmission costs (in messages/hop) in wired and
wireless links, respectively. The cost of processing at one end
is represented by PCy. It is measured based on a logarithmic
search in a data structure with the size of the number of
MN entries and a normalizing constant ς equivalent to the
bandwidth allocation. If the reception of a message at one
end does not imply the search in a local storage, PCy is
considered zero. Additionally, if the node that sends or receives
the message is not an MN, the β factor is excluded. The
handover signaling cost is the sum of the cost of all messages
exchanged during a handover. The average cost is measured
as a weighted sum of the intra-domain and inter-domain
114
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2017.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-546-3

counterparts. It depends on Ng and Nl rates. The average
cost [11] is presented as
cost = intraDHO cost × Nl + interDHO cost × Ng
Nl + Ng
.
(7)
The inter-domain signaling cost for a session is the cost
of one inter-domain handover multiplied by both Ng and the
session duration:
cost in session = interDHO cost×Ng×session duration.
(8)
Handover latency is measured as the handover duration,
i.e., the time a node spends without effective communication.
The latency equation for a message exchanged between two
nodes x and y is (see [13])
Tx−y = 1 + q
1 − q
Msize
Bwl
+ Lwl

+
Hx−y
Msize
Bw
+ Lw + Tq

.
(9)
The ﬁrst part of the sum is the wireless overhead and
it must be excluded if neither x nor y is a wireless device.
The second part is the overhead in the wired medium. The
parameter q is the probability of failure of the wireless link,
Msize is the average length of a message, and Bwl and
Bw are the wireless and wired bandwidths, respectively. The
propagation delay in wireless and wired media are Lwl and
Lw, respectively. The average queuing delay in each router
is represented by Tq. Handover latency is the sum of the
latency of all signaling messages exchanged during a handover.
As in the signaling cost, the average latency is measured
as a weighted sum of the intra-domain and inter-domain
counterparts as follows [11]:
latency = intraDHO lat × Nl + interDHO lat × Ng
Nl + Ng
.
(10)
The average packet loss in a handover is the average
number of packages not sent/received during handover. The
packet loss (PL) is the product of the handover latency and
the packet arrival rate (λp) [11], i.e.,
PL = Tλp.
(11)
Finally, the goodput is a measure that relates the useful
data trafﬁc during a session and the total trafﬁc (TOT), which
is the total number of bytes transmitted during a session. The
goodput is determined as follows (cf. [11]):
Goodput = TOT − (Psize × PLsession + TOT × PD)
session duration
,
(12)
TOT = session duration × λp × Psize,
(13)
PD =
40 × Htunnel
(40 + Psize) × HMN−CN
.
(14)
Goodput additionally depends on the packet loss and the
packet delivery (PD) overhead. PD overhead is the cost of
tunneling the IP-in-IP extra 40-byte header along the path
between an MN and its correspondent node (HMN−CN).

Now, we turn our attention to the perfomance evaluation of
CI-PMIPv6. The signaling cost in a session is measured as a
funcion of SMR. Latency and packet loss in one handover are
measured as a function of the probability of failure of the link
in the wireless network. The goodput in a session is measured
as a function of SMR.
We consider in our evaluations that a domain has 7 subnets.
Each subnet follows a hexagonal model and has one MAG.
There is a central subnet that is managed by a single LMA. The
other subnets surround the central subnet. The coverage area
of each subnet is equal to 1.8 km2 and the perimeter is equal to
5 km. Table II summarizes the values of the parameters used
for performance evaluation. The Kademlia parameter k used
in CI-PMIPv6, which represents the size of the neighborhood,
is set to 10. This value is chosen based on a scenario where
nodes have an average speed of 15 m/s (60 km/h) and may
cross 10 domains during a session. The probability of failure
of the wireless link ranges from 0 to 0.8 in experiments to
consider the radio channel under different quality conditions
during handover. The greater this probability is, the more link-
layer retransmissions are necessary. We consider α to be equal
to 1 message/hop and β to be equal to 10 messages/hop, since
wireless links tend to cost more than wired links. The average
queue time is a typical value of 5 ms. We consider that the
average residency time of an MN is equal to 300 s, which
corresponds to a mean speed of 15 m/s. The theoretical latency
across a 4G LTE interface is in the order of 10 ms. We assume
that the wireless link has a propagation delay of 10 ms in order
to capture such behaviour. The propagation delay of wired
links are assumed to be a typical value for Fast Ethernet. The
arrival rate of packets corresponds to a voice call (e.g., Skype)
and the session arrival rate allows consecutive voice calls that
are 13 minutes long each. We consider that the average data
packet size is 300 bytes long [15]. The average packet size
used for handover signaling is 160 bytes long.
Figure 4 presents the inﬂuence of SMR on the overall
cost during a session. If SMR is near zero, there is a high
mobility scenario. If SMR is high, this means that the network

mobility is low. Therefore, the cost tends to be lower with
higher values of SMR for all proposals. When SMR tends to
zero, there is a high number of handovers during a session. In
this case, the number of messages exchanged during handover
plays an important role in the overall cost. The scheme with
no optimization has the worst performance and CI-PMIPv6
presents the lowest cost, since it requires fewer messages to
accomplish handover. Additionally, the presence of a cluster
that exchanges domains information proactively and in parallel
with the current binding update simpliﬁes the communication
during future inter-domain handovers, which require less in-
teraction between core network entities. The CI-PMIPv6 cost
is always the lowest. In particular, it is 20% lower than the
cost in No-Gap when the SMR is equal to 0.01.

Figure 5 presents the average handover latency as a func-
tion of the probability of failure of the wireless link. This
probability represents the reliability of the wireless channel and
may degrade performance due to retransmissions. The EIPMH
results are inﬂuenced by the high number of interactions in the
core network. It has the highest latency until the probability of
failure reaches 0.65. From this point on, the scheme without
optimization has greater latency. This is due to the fact that it
has more messages involving the MN, thus making the scheme
more sensitive to the wireless media. I-PMIP presents slightly
better results than No Gap. It is important to notice that CI-
PMIPv6 presents the smallest results for latency. In particular,
CI-PMIPv6 latency is 16% smaller than the latency in I-PMIP
when the probability of failure is 0.8. In this case, CI-PMIPv6
still has a handover latency of 410 ms, which is 90 ms lower
than the latency in I-PMIP. CI-PMIPv6 performs better because
unnecessary interactions in both the core network and the
wireless network were eliminated.
Figure 6 presents the number of lost packets as function of
the probability of failure of the wireless link. The packet loss
is directly related to the handover latency, since no buffering
during handover is considered in the protocols. Considering
that in this scenario the arrival rate is 38 packets/s, there is
a signiﬁcant loss of quality in the worst case even for the
No-Gap scheme, which presents the second best result. The
number of lost data packets for CI-PMIPv6 is the smallest
in all cases studied. In particular, it is 16% smaller than the
value observed for No-Gap when the failure probability is 0.8.
The number of lost data packets for CI-PMIPv6 is always the
smallest because CI-PMIPv6 has the lowest handover latency.

Figure 7 presents the goodput versus the SMR. If SMR
is high, it means that the network mobility is low. Thus,
goodput tends to be more stable as SMR grows. CI-PMIPv6
has higher goodput for all SMR values. This means that the
proposed scheme can send more useful data during a session.
CI-PMIPv6 maintains the same number of tunnels created
in PMIPv6. This avoids the PD overhead due to headers in
IP-in-IP tunneling. EIPMH has the worst goodput because it
requires the creation of two extra tunnels, besides the pre-
existing PMIPv6 tunnel.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presented the CI-PMIPv6 as a distributed solu-
tion for inter-domain IP mobility. CI-PMIPv6 has a distributed
design, which organizes LMAs from different domains in a
cluster as Kademlia peers. In that cluster, information on MNs
is spread proactively and in parallel with the current binding
update, thereby simplifying future inter-domain handover pro-
cesses.
CI-PMIPv6 was compared to several inter-domain ap-
proaches and results have shown that when CI-PMIPv6 is used,
the cost, the latency, and the packet loss in the scenario studied
are lower. Additionally, the goodput reaches higher values. In
future work, it is intended to extend the solution to FPMIPv6.
Further, the application of localized routing techniques may

further expected. Future experiments with a variable number
of domains will highlight the scalability of the cluster in
comparison to other architectures.
