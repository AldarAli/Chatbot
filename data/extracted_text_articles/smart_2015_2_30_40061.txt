Abstract— The rise of urban population brings the need
of effective ways to move around the city and strategies
to improve the traffic flow. This study aims to observe
the present context of the traffic lights, one of the
solutions to traffic control most used in our time. This
study will also look some solutions already implemented
by the cities of Los Angeles and Recife using sensors and
cameras at intersections, in order to optimize traffic
control in real time. The proposal will be a system of
intelligent
traffic
lights
based
on
big
data
from
navigation and traffic applications, which adapt the
traffic lights depending on traffic, contributing to the
improvement of systemically traffic control instruments,
generating immediate gains in quality of life in cities.

I. INTRODUCTION
Big cities have several challenges for us to tackle; one of
them is the issue of urban mobility. "The United Nations
projected that half of the world's population would live in
urban areas at the end of 2008” [1]. Nowadays, predictions
say that by 2050 about 64% of the developing world and
86% of the developed world will be urbanized [2].
By analyzing these predictions, it becomes clear that it is
necessary to think about problems in the urban environment.
Among urban problems, urban mobility and the massive use
of cars is one of the most significant.
Dealing with such problems is not simple since cars
have become one vital part of urban environments; the
majority of the cities are living in car paradigm, as Recife
city, which has the biggest flux of car in Brazil. This
paradigm deals with the notion that we have to improve
mobility but mobility is nor improving [3].
This paper proposes a discussion about how the traffic
lights, one of the major instruments in traffic control of big
cities, can be smarter by relying on data collected by the
drivers using apps like Waze and Google Maps. The paper
is divided as follows: Section II focuses on discussions
about urban mobility. Sections III and IV highlight some
existing solutions in traffic light, and briefly analyze them.
In Section V, some proposals are discussed and future
researches are suggested.

CITIES ANALYSIS
For the last few years, the number of people that live in
the urban area has surpassed the amount living in rural areas
[4]. Figure 1 shows in 2050 the urban population will
account for 6 billion people out of a total 9 billion.
Figure 1. Urban and rural areas of the world, 1950 – 2050 [5].
Population growth in urban centers and the lack of
infrastructure are the main factors to affect urban mobility,
causing traffic problems and jams [5].
Recent politics of income redistribution in Brazil had
increased the car sales for the past ten years.
"Brazil is the world's fourth-biggest auto market
and a major base of operations for Italy's Fiat SpA,
Germany's
Volkswagen
AG
and
U.S.-based
General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co." [6].
Even with the decrease in sales over the past years, big
urban centers in Brazil are filled with cars. Recife is one big
city with traffic problem, and one of the biggest cities in the
northwest of Brazil. A research published in a local
newspaper shows that Recife is the city that has a largest
number of streets with traffic jam during rush hours in
Brazil [7].
The increase in numbers of cars on streets is not the only
reason for the traffic problems to appear; there is a lack of
planning to deal with this amount of cars. For example, it is
very common for someone to wait a traffic light to become
green even if there is no car in the street. This might
intensify the traffic jams instead of work as a traffic
controller [8].
The problem of traffic jams in cities is not an easy
problem to address. It is necessary to improve public

transportation system and provide people with means to be
less dependent on their cars.
In addition, it is also necessary to stimulate other
possibilities of transportation, to improve safety on the
streets, to increase people security feelings and walkability
through the streets. Among the options to address such
scenario, big data appears as a possible solution to improve
traffic systems and solutions.
III. EXISTING SOLUTIONS
This section depicts some solutions in big cities around
the globe.
A. Los Angeles city
The city of Los Angeles is a city with one among the
worst traffic jams in the USA. It has a system that uses big
data to control the traffic lights. The New York Times gives
a breakdown of how it all works:
“Magnetic sensors in the road at every intersection
send real-time updates about the traffic flow
through fiber-optic cables to a bunker beneath
downtown Los Angeles, where Edward Yu runs the
network.
The
computer
system,
which
runs
software the city itself developed, analyzes the data
and
automatically
makes
second-by-second
adjustments, adapting to changing conditions and
using a trove of past data to predict where traffic
could snarl, all without human involvement” [9].
Further information about the smart grid system, used in
Los Angeles, and how it works, could see below:
“The
system
is
intelligent
in
that
it
can
automatically adjust the time delay between light
changes whenever issues arise. So, for example, if
there is an accident that causes one or more lanes
to be closed on any highway in the city (thus
causing a bottleneck), it can adjust the lights and
give more time to let cars caught up in it all pass
through. Alternatively, it can also be used to help
keep public transport running on time – if the buses
are late, the system can help them to pass through
the lights faster and get back on schedule”[10].
This system slightly improved the traffic in the city.
According to officials, the average time to drive 5 miles in
the city before was 20 minutes. These smart traffic lights
have reduced the time to just 17.2 minutes.
B. Recife city
Some actions have already been tested to improve the
traffic control in Recife: some traffic lights use cameras to
make the time that they stay green or red more effective,
according to the traffic on the streets without the need of a
pre-programed pattern.
With smart traffic lights, the control of the traffic flow is
conducted in real time [11]. This means that a command and
control service is responsible to change traffic lights through
an adaptive control. Figure 2 shows how the adaptive urban
traffic control system works.
Figure 2. The adaptive urban traffic control system works.
IV.DISCUSSIONS
Looking at Los Angeles and Recife solutions it is
possible to observe the need of the installation and
maintenance of a great number of sensors around the city.
This will possibly lead to a high cost for the execution of
these services. There is also the need of the development of
a system that controls and updates the data of the traffic
lights. Besides that, these sensors just work for the nearby
traffic and cannot understand what is happening with the
traffic around the city as a whole.
Another aspect of this idea is the possibility of using the
sensors that are already on the streets and do not depend on
government agencies to work; they just need smart citizens
feeding data for their own good. This approach can possibly
lead to a lower cost of implementation and maintenance
compared to the Los Angeles and Recife solutions that need
the implementation and maintenance of sensors around the
city.
V. PROPOSAL
The proposal, looking at these examples, is a new
approach for these big data traffic lights. Instead of using a
lot of time and money building an infrastructure of magnetic
sensors in every road intersection, use data gathered by the
drivers and shared trough the web using apps like Waze or
Google maps. The drivers rely on this information for their
daily commutes. We could use the data gathered by the
drivers to help us improve the time and flux of the traffic
lights.
Some actions are performed to enable the traffic light
system of Smart Cities to control the traffic light based on
the current traffic situation. Some traffic lights have camera
assistance to help decide the length of the green and the red
in order to smooth the traffic flow. In other words, with the

help of the smart traffic lights, the control of the traffic is
done in real time.
VI.FINAL DISCUSSIONS
Our proposal in this paper shows the potential of using
mobile sensors available in smartphones and other smart
objects to solve problems in cities, in this case, urban
mobility. These sensors have already improved the traffic
for many people, especially for those who want to see the
traffic flow, and take an alternative route, for example. It is
time to use this data in a different way, creating a greater
good for the city. The use of the big data information
generated by these sensors connected to social networks and
connected with the traffic lights, can create new possibilities
for better optimized traffic flow and can generate algorithms
that may help government agencies to create further
solutions that could improve urban mobility.
Our proposal is an initial effort to study the possibilities
of big data to improve the traffic flow in big cities and with
further research can lead to the creation of a “smart traffic
light.” The smart traffic lights are expected to access the
huge amount of information generated by the users and
shared through social networks.
Future studies will focus on user research, data mining
techniques, and solutions that use big data for urban
mobility.
