Abstract—Scholars write scholarly articles to introduce new 
concepts and ideas. Unfortunately, not every learner or reader 
can understand every scholar’s work. One reason for this is 
that the language used in papers is profound, hence many 
learners find it difficult to cope with the language and 
understand the ideas put forward in papers. To overcome this 
problem, our focus in this research is to develop a teaching-
based technique to guide learners toward a better way of 
understanding and learning from scholarly articles. The 
technique in this paper is validated in case studies with the 
support of evidence that shows it is a proof of learning concept 
which has significantly contributed to guiding students to 
better practice in their learning. In addition, the use of this 
technique helps to promote educational sustainability by 
developing 
students’ 
interest 
in 
appreciating 
and 
understanding scholarly articles.  
Keywords-scholarly articles; learning technique; education, 
sustainability. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
    Our recent work [1] demonstrated a practice-based 
technique to learners. This paper is an extended version 
which incorporates case studies and compares the results to 
establish whether the technique can be highly recommended 
for use.  
A scholarly article is defined in many ways. A standard 
definition describes it as an original research or 
experimentation written by a researcher or an expert in the 
field who is often affiliated with a college or university [2]. 
California State University, Chico [3] conducted a research 
study to compare and contrast scholarly articles with other 
article types and established that the language used in 
scholarly articles is a technical terminology appropriate to 
the discipline. It is assumed that readers will have a similar 
scholarly background, but despite this assumption, there is 
unfortunately no evidence that the process of reading and 
understanding scholarly articles is easy.  
 
Scholarly articles need to be succinct in order to sustain 
the reader‟s interest. Papers are usually circulated within 
academic institutions and are available to industry because 
they not only contribute to the body of knowledge, but also 
to the development of new products and services, new 
processes and new technology, all of which benefit 
organizations and society as a whole. They drive innovation 
and change. 
 
Developing 
scholarly 
articles is compelling 
and 
challenging. Introducing them in the classroom may 
frequently be even more challenging, especially if they are to 
attract students‟ interest as a support for their learning. 
 
The reasons are essentially twofold. Firstly, some articles 
are not easily read and understood due to the technical nature 
of the language used, and secondly, the students‟ lack of 
critical research skills disadvantage them in understanding 
the methodologies used in the development of the articles. 
 
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 examines 
the use of state of the art requirement elicitation techniques 
to understand scholarly papers. Section 3 contains a 
discussion of related works on learning approaches, and 
educators‟ feedback on scholarly articles is covered in 
Section 4. Section 5 outlines a new technique which is 
followed by a discussion of data collection methods in 
Section 6.  Section 7 addresses the issue of understanding 
subject assessment criteria.  Section 8 describes the first case 
study validation of the technique; in section 9, an overview 
of results from  the case studies is presented.. Subsequent 
case studies are also validated; discussion of their results are 
in Section 10 and Section 11. Section 12 concludes and 
updates the direction that research will take in the future.  
II. 
STATE OF THE ART USING REQUIREMENT 
ELICITATION TECHNIQUES TO UNDERSTAND 
SCHOLARLY PAPERS  
The structure of scholarly papers varies in type and 
length. Examples of scholarly papers are: 1) research papers, 
2) experience reports, 3) short papers, 4) posters, 5) tutorial 
proposals, 6) tutorials, and 7) panels. A research paper 
describes original, empirical and theoretical research that is 
composed of new techniques and tools. Usually, a full-length 
research paper comprises about eight pages. Some full 
research papers consist of new interpretations, while others 
require in-depth case studies for analytical findings. 
 
The three largest groups of people who frequently need 
to access, retrieve and read scholarly papers are educators, 
researchers, and students. They read scholarly papers to: 1) 
conduct new research, 2) collect information, 3) advance 
knowledge, and 4) collect ideas and translate them into 
projects. 
 
Although scholarly papers are documents to be read for 
the importance of their information content, they should also 
be thought of as undoubtedly significant learning drivers for 
students, teaching them how to think, reflect and review their 
knowledge.

To encourage learners to read and understand scholarly 
articles, some common requirement elicitation techniques 
from the field of software requirements [4] are widely 
introduced to group-learners and an individual-learner. 
Examples of requirement gathering techniques include 
brainstorming, 
prototyping, 
interviews 
and 
agile 
methodology [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. All have been developed 
and used to clarify, elicit and confirm requirement needs 
with users. Such techniques are thought to be worth 
introducing into the academic environment to promote 
learning effects by encouraging socialization and interaction 
between learners. These techniques are useful for group 
discussion and for promoting group synergy, with its 
potentially positive effects on student learning. 
 
According to Ambler [5], agile methodology highlights 
story telling from an unclear scenario. It is effective for 
eliciting users‟ or customers‟ requirements, and is useful for 
helping users to clarify their knowledge through an implicit 
method, by putting their ideas into a narrative to help the 
developer understand their requirements. However, it does 
not promote a critical review of suggestions or ideas. 
 
As information technology rapidly advances, the 
availability of learning tools has become increasingly 
sophisticated. Learning tools [11] [12] provide adequate 
features and functionality to facilitate better learning. 
According to Chua et al. [13], these tools support learning 
activities but cannot replace current strategies or introduce 
new learning strategies or practices. 
 
Integrating scholarly papers into any learning activity can 
facilitate the learning process effectively and can stimulate 
learning by providing interest and excitement. A number of 
traditional teaching and learning methods fail to explicitly 
demonstrate how to introduce research into practice-based 
learning. 
 
Many learning methods focus on theory-based and 
practical-based components, but very few have integrated 
research-based components into their learning processes. 
Few researchers could imagine how the mapping of 
scholarly papers enables learners to improve their learning 
performance and even to experience joy in reading them. 
 
III. 
RELATED WORKS ON LEARNING TECHNIQUES 
The term „learning‟ is broad. Buchanan and Huczynski 
[14] define learning as „the process of acquiring knowledge 
through experience which leads to a change in behaviour‟. In 
other words, learning is not just the acquisition of 
knowledge, but its application by doing something different 
in the world. 
 
A familiar scenario that has incorporated changes can 
drive us to learn something new, or adjust to a new way of 
operating, or to unlearn something. From an organizational 
learning [15] point of view, learning is associated with two 
important concepts: the first is the power of knowledge 
acquisition, and the second is the power of knowledge 
sharing. Understanding scholarly articles provides readers 
with knowledge and thus increases their ability to 
knowledge-share with others [16] [17].  
 
It is therefore important to encourage students to learn 
through reading scholarly articles. However, integrating 
these articles in the classroom remains a challenging task for 
educators. 
 
Acknowledging that this is an issue that impacts learning 
in the classroom, the focus of this paper is to introduce a 
learning technique that can assist educators to integrate 
scholarly articles and case-based learning in their teaching. 
 
Case based learning is not a new concept in education. It 
is effective, but can be challenging. These challenges have 
been discussed widely in research that focuses on achieving 
better learning experiences by recognizing the depth of the 
subject content while increasing the capacity of the learner to 
develop skills, including problem solving skills [18] [19] 
[20] [21]. 
 
Case based learning can be conducted either by 
individuals or by groups. Traditionally, the method involves 
face-to-face teaching. Although some researchers claim that 
face-to-face teaching of case based reasoning is one of the 
most traditional and effective learning methods, it 
demonstrates a lack of learning innovation. Face-to-face 
teaching is usually conducted in a classroom environment 
where one or more learners absorb the concepts or theories 
directly from an educator. The learner can clarify immediate 
doubts directly with the educator.  
 
This method promotes a dual learning loop: questions 
from learners and feedback from educators. The drawback of 
this approach is that not all learners are able to accept and 
adapt to an educator‟s teaching techniques. In particular, the 
technique used in case based reasoning does not promote 
student learning through the sharing of ideas and knowledge 
among individuals in the class. Hence, some students find 
learning difficult, rather than enjoyable or fun. In the worst 
case, students can become bored with a single and lengthy 
case study, and instead of their learning horizons being 
widened, their thinking narrows to focus solely on the case. 
 
IV. 
EDUCATORS FEEDBACK ON SCHOLARLY ARTICLES  
We surveyed educators to understand what their aims 
were for learners who have read scholarly papers. Every 
educator has different expectations and requirements; for 
example, some educators provide scholarly articles for 
learners to read, but their requirement is for learners to 
summarize the article in their own words. This means 
writing a short version of the research paper from which the 
educator can assess the learner‟s writing and analytical skills.

The process is similar to the „requirements elicitation‟ 
technique. 
 
Some educators, however, do not ask for a summary 
page but want to know how the learners judge the scholarly 
articles; in other words, they want to test their evaluative 
skills. This process is similar to the requirement gathering 
technique called „prototyping‟. 
 
Some educators want learners to answer questions in 
response to scholarly articles. The aim is to test their critical 
analysis in problem solving, and this process is similar to 
the interview technique. Some educators want learners to 
discuss what the article is about, a process which is similar 
to the agile methodology of story-telling. One commonality 
of these approaches for scholarly papers is managing and 
eliciting requirements.  
 
V. 
A NEW TECHNIQUE 
Our objective in introducing the new technique is to 
provide learners with a better way of understanding scholarly 
articles by a combination of processes (eliciting, analyzing, 
clarifying, reviewing, verifying and validating) so that they 
can get the most out of papers which can provide them with 
valuable knowledge.  
 
The inward process of the technique emphasizes how 
learners‟ skills (communication, analytical and team skills) 
can be strengthened, and the outward process of this 
technique is a knowledge sharing mechanism for others. In 
addition, this technique can help to strengthen learners‟ skills 
by making them: 1) responsible for interaction, 2) 
accountable for critical review, and 3) empowered to 
produce innovative ideas and decision making. The diagram 
in Figure 1 illustrates each process.  
 
 
 
Figure  1. The framework for a practice-based technique on  
scholarly papers 
 
The steps below show how each individual task is processed. 
1. Delivery by lecturers 
Theories are delivered by lecturers to the class. 
2. Imparting knowledge of theories to the class 
Students learn these theories from the lecturer, and their 
ability to understand concepts is assessed by giving 
them scholarly articles that relate to the theories 
discussed in class. 
3. Introducing scholarly articles to students 
Selected articles are distributed to students. 
4. Communicating and sharing of information by 
students with the aid of the learning tool 
This tool supports and facilitates discussion on the 
paper‟s topic. 
5. Class contributing their answers on the learning 
tool 
All students in the class take part in the discussion 
using the learning tool. 
6. Group problem solving 
Students in each group perform brainstorming sessions 
to understand the article and decide the questions to be 
asked in class for class comments and suggestions. 
7. Uploading questions and answers on the learning 
tool 
Individual groups upload either open-ended or closed-
ended questions in the forum of a learning tool to 
address problems, concerns and challenging issues 
discussed in the paper. 
8. Class participation 
The class reads the papers and provides answers based 
on the 
questions asked by 
the 
group, either 
quantitatively or qualitatively. Students are also 
encouraged put related questions to the group. 
9. Individual student participation 
Individual students must answer the questions discussed 
in the forum. 
10. Group presentation 
Students present their findings in class.  
 
The presentation covers: 1) understanding the paper‟s 
content, 2) addressing problems and concerns about the 
paper, 3) discussing questions and answers posted on the 
forum, 4) consolidating findings in a summary format, and 5) 
proposing a strategy, if necessary in relation to the questions 
asked by other students in the class. Feedback is provided by 
the class and the lecturer. 
 
Current designs of learning and teaching techniques [11] 
[12] [13] are useful, especially for widening the range of 
teaching materials that can be easily understood by students

and that will encourage them to engage in deep learning 
rather than surface learning. Nonetheless, they lack the 
ability to elaborate interactively on the students‟ learning, 
and no significant evidence was found in the literature 
review to demonstrate that these techniques provide good 
support for students in learning scholarly articles effectively. 
VI. 
DATA COLLECTION METHOD  
Concern as to how the technique will be validated and 
the number of case studies needed for such validation is, no 
doubt, a crucial issue. A framework is proposed to validate  
the technique in classes and observe step by step how the 
process works on educators  and students. The steps below 
outline the sequence of the data collection process:  
1. Scholarly articles selected by educators.  
2. Formation of groups to be decided by educators.  
3. Each group is asked to select a scholarly paper.  
4. Each group is asked to read and analyse the paper, 
and then to highlight an important concern that has 
not been discussed in the paper. 
5. Each group is required to upload questions and ask 
the class for their participation on the learning tool.  
6. Each group must summarise class members‟ 
feedback on questions and present their discussions 
and/or answers in class.  
7. In a particular week, an anonymous  survey will be 
distributed to students to comment on the 
technique.  
8. Students return the survey to the subject 
coordinator 
for 
data 
analysis 
and 
data 
interpretation.  
9. Three results are revealed. The first result presents 
an overall statistical rating on closed-ended 
questions; the second presents comments made by 
students on questions posted on the forum; and the 
third result offers qualitative analysis based on the 
open-ended questions.  
VII. SUBJECT ASSESSMENT CRITERA  
Students are informed of the marking criteria in this subject. 
Figure 2 shows the subject assessment criteria for 
understanding scholarly articles. Students were asked to 
rank their priorities in understanding scholarly articles. Of 
the three assessment criteria, seven groups gave the 
component of research skill the highest mark on innovation 
and invention (see Figure 3).

of scholarly papers, it is very unlikely that they would be 
able to incorporate the research ideas into their discussions

VIII. TECHNIQUE VALIDATED IN FIRST CASE STUDY 
One author of this paper is a subject coordinator who 
coordinates a post-graduate subject offered to information 
technology students. A past survey result showed high and 
good ratings for the teaching, but not for the subject. 
 
In order to validate our proposed technique, we selected a 
postgraduate subject having two classes, A and B, as the 
main focus of the case study and as part of the unit analysis. 
We carried out an experiment on fifty students from both 
classes in five weeks and, according to what we observed, 
data was analyzed from surveys and information that was

posted by students on an online discussion board using an e-
learning tool.  
 
Past feedback from many students expressed concern at 
the difficulty in understanding scholarly articles. Many could 
not interpret what the authors discussed in the paper. As a 
result, students did not like the subject or the support 
materials handed out by the subject coordinator. Rather than 
re-design the whole subject, the coordinator analyzed all 
aspects of the learning factors that impacted on the students‟ 
learning, and reviewed all processes, including tools and 
techniques. The learning environment was the first area to be 
evaluated to discover whether there were any missing or 
inappropriate resource supports for the students.  
 
The learning tool that was provided to the students 
provided good functionality and adequate features, according 
to our observation, and was therefore not believed to be the 
cause of the problem. As such, the tool was retained. Next, 
the coordinator reviewed ten different scholarly articles, 
carefully selected by us, to determine whether they were 
difficult for students. This review confirmed that there was 
no replacement of the existing articles, as that was not 
primary teaching goal. The teaching goal was to encourage 
students toward deep learning, rather than surface learning 
and the objective was not, therefore, to change the ten papers 
being used. Instead, the coordinator revisited the presentation 
structure, as a result of which it was recognized that it was 
necessary to re-engineer the presentation process so that the 
subject matter would be explicitly clear to students, both 
informatively and intuitively. It was decided to outline any 
missing steps between the old and new presentation 
structures, in order to achieve improvement in the subject. 
  
Our objective is to ensure that students are more engaged 
in their learning and hence we proposed the development of 
a collaborative interface between students at group and class 
levels for questions and discussions. This interface acted as a 
two-way 
communication 
process 
that 
made 
groups 
responsible for posting their designed questions, and the 
class responsible for feedback on the designed questions. 
 
Fifty students from two classes in one semester took part 
in the new process. Ten scholarly articles were chosen, on 
topics ranging from understanding Michael Porter‟s 
framework on the five forces to strategic information 
planning. Papers published by ACM, MISQ and IEEE were 
the focus. Students listened attentively to the settings for the 
paper discussion in the first lesson. Each group was made up 
of five students. Ten groups of five students per group were 
formed, and each group was given a different paper topic to 
read, analyze and discuss. 
 
Of the concerns raised, some students were confused 
about the actual process because it was the first time they 
had experienced such a technique. A minority of students felt 
insecure and lacking in confidence because detailed data had 
to be collected and interpreted in one of the steps, and they 
had no prior knowledge of research skills. 
 
There were no negative responses from students about 
the learning process, but acceptance of change was not 
readily forthcoming when the new technique was introduced. 
IX. 
RESULTS FROM THE FIRST CASE STUDY  
The first week of presentations by the two classes went 
well. Students knew what to do for each paper. They had to: 
1) identify a problem issue discussed in the paper (a process 
equivalent to requirements gathering), 2) contribute their 
opinions or comments on the paper (a process equivalent to 
requirements elicitation), 3) ask the class for feedback on 
questions they asked (a process equivalent to requirements 
clarification), 4) respond to comments from their classmates 
(a process equivalent to requirements review), 5) know how 
to summarize their findings and propose a strategy (a process 
equivalent to that of requirements changes), and 6) present 
their data or findings in a class presentation (a process 
equivalent to requirements traceability). 
 
The presentation structure, the learning tool and the 
interface for group discussion are the events on which we 
sought understanding. Students claimed that class A‟s papers 
were more difficult than class B‟s papers. The statistics 
report showed that class A received more responses than 
class B, even though the papers were difficult.  
 
We believe that class A students received a high response 
rate due to the fact that the topic interested them, and thus 
they focused on that, rather than on the paper‟s difficulty. 
The same group of students had to analyze data (feedback) 
from the class and summarize their findings in one 
presentation slide. Two of the five questions had to involve a 
critical review of the research into technology and an 
analysis of the data collected from their classmates. They 
were also required to propose ideas for solutions to a 
particular problem based on their classmates‟ feedback.  
 
In other words, they had to be able to think of a strategic 
approach and show why it was useful, thought provoking, 
innovative and interesting. Most importantly, they were 
asked to summarize findings from the five questions and to 
conduct an oral presentation to the class the following week 
in order to leverage knowledge and knowledge transfer of 
the topic, ideas and solutions for the class.

After week five, an anonymous survey was distributed to 
all students to evaluate their responses to the technique. 
Forty-one out of fifty students completed and returned the 
survey. Nine students did not complete it as they did not 
attend the class. The survey findings are shown in Table 1, 
Figure 3 and 4. 
 
Difficult papers were rated with an asterisk, indicating 
that students had difficulty reading them and understanding 
the scope, and that they had to read them more than once. 
Before we reviewed the learning process, we were convinced 
by our students that scholarly papers were too hard to read. 
We think this is the same belief that drove a similar situation 
in software development, in which the team always found it 
difficult to understand some of the users‟ requirements 
because they were vague or incomplete. In fact, a well 
developed 
process 
to 
help 
developers 
understand 
requirements simplifies the situation and makes users‟ 
requirements understandable. 
 
This learning technique underpins the process for 
assisting students to overcome the barrier of reading difficult 
papers. The aim is to make them realize that academic papers 
are not complicated or hard to understand. It is a guiding 
process on the „how‟ and „what‟ of reading scholarly articles. 
 
We were also keen to know whether students liked the 
presentation structure. The process for the presentation was 
to have them read an article, post designed questions and 
then analyze data from the class feedback and comments 
from the subject coordinator for an oral presentation. In this 
question, we were able to gain many valuable insights from 
students‟ responses. Most of their comments are similar and 
we summarized them into four aspects: 1) article topics, 2) 
paper discussion, 3) questions posted on the forum, and 4) 
their oral presentation. We were pleased to find that feedback 
from the students was positive. For the article topics, the 
words used repeatedly are: 
„Topics are current significant, clear and interesting’, 
‘good knowledge’, ‘It sharpened our thinking’, ‘Topics are 
thought-provoking’, ‘They give us business aspects of a 
technical field’, ‘They broadened our knowledge of IT 
strategies’.  
 
The comments on the paper discussion showed that 
students felt it was ‘informative’, and that ‘team dynamics 
were unique’. They agreed that the process involved two-
way discussion and they ‘enjoyed it’. They also believed that 
such discussion helped them ‘not only get to know each 
other better but also able to share their experience and 
knowledge within the group level and class level’. On the 
questions posted on the forum, one student commented that 
‘questions are a good help to think critically and relate to 
the paper and real life experiences’. As for the oral 
presentation, many students claimed that the purpose was to 
‘help understand the topic well’, ‘stimulate discussion in 
class and feedback from the subject coordinator’.  
 
Students commented that ‘there was a lot of information’ 
and ‘argumentative and critical evaluation’. They felt that 
they learned how to ‘build oral communication skills, 
negotiation skills and analytical skills, as well’. 
 
As a supplementary question, we wanted to know 
whether students found the presentation structure helpful to 
their learning; for example, whether it led to better 
understanding of the scholarly articles. 98% of students 
agreed that the presentation structure did help them to 
understand the scholarly papers better. One student offered a 
comment that was not negative about the presentation

structure, but rather concerned the length of the paper. He 
felt that some articles were slightly longer than others and 
thus took longer to read.  
 
Another student believed that some students‟ answers in 
the forum discussion showed a lack of clarity – either their 
answers were incomplete or the meaning was not clear – and 
it would have been better if they had provided resource links 
to justify their findings clearly from journals or books. 
X. 
TECHNIQUE VALIDATED IN SECOND CASE STUDY AND 
ITS OUTCOME 
One semester later, the same technique was validated in 
the same subject. The total number of students enrolled was 
fifty and each group had ten students. They were given 
scholarly articles to read and told to use the framework in 
Figure 1 to assist their understanding At the end of the 
teaching semester, students were asked to complete a survey 
designed by the subject coordinator. Students‟ responses in 
the result findings (see Table 2 and Figure 5) are similar to 
those of the first case study.

Some constructive comments were made in this semester, 
particularly in relation to the questions posted on the forum, 
and their oral presentation. Two students commented that the 
questions posted on the forum by groups analyzed them 
quantitatively, which did not provide useful insights to the 
paper topic. Ideally, it would be helpful for groups to provide 
in depth answers.   
XI. 
TECHNIQUE VALIDATED IN THIRD CASE STUDY AND 
ITS OUTCOME 
It is highly recommended that the technique should be cross 
validated in different subjects in order to evaluate its results. 
In another faculty, a research-based subject with heavy 
emphasis on scholarly articles did not receive a good subject 
rating, hence the subject coordinator wanted to seek subject 
improvement. He agreed to use the technique for a trial 
period during one semester to see whether this would help to 
improve his subject rating level. He was interested to 
discover whether the length of scholarly articles affected 
students‟ ability to read and understand. 
 
In total, 20 students were enrolled in the subject (Class 
D). Although the enrolment was not large, the number of 
students seemed sufficient for us to analyze the results, as 
long as they were new students learning how to read and 
understand scholarly articles for the first time. 
 
Fifteen students took part and completed surveys. The 
information in the returned surveys enabled us to explicitly 
investigate whether there was any validity threat to the 
technique. Not to our surprise, the students‟ feedback was 
similar to that of students in the first subject. The following 
Table 3 and Figure 6 illustrate the Class D data.

Figure  6.  Class D data with students responses to the paper  
The results shown in this table and diagram clearly 
identified to the subject coordinator that there is no 
significant evidence that students‟ difficulty in understanding 
scholarly articles is due to the length of the paper. Three 
students mention that papers 1, 3 and 5 are difficult despite 
their length and size. Paper 1 has 9 pages, paper 3 has 7 
pages and paper 5 has 14 pages. The most highly rated by 
students is paper 3. Five students feel that it is difficult. 
 
In the survey, we asked students to comment on the 
usefulness of the presentation structure. Fifteen students 
agreed that the process of presentation really helped them to 
better learn the concepts and theories discussed in the papers. 
One student commented that the presentation can be time-
consuming but is nevertheless thought-provoking. 
 
In order to establish the technique‟s reliability and 
effectiveness, it must be validated in more than one case 
study. The more case studies involved in the validation, the 
more accurate and reliable the technique can be considered 
to be.  
 
XII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
Existing case studies reveal that the technique can be 
applied effectively in research-based and coursework-based 
subjects in which students might be experiencing difficulty 
in understanding scholarly articles. The technique appears to 
be convincing enough to be suitable for use in small classes.  
 
Strategies discussed in this paper are twofold. The first 
strategy was to observe the technique introduced into the 
subject and to see the effect on students and their ability to 
accept difficult scholarly papers. The second strategy was to 
conduct a survey to measure student satisfaction with the 
technique.  
 
From the survey, we see that the technique is successful, 
in particular from the positive comments showing that many 
students like the technique, and from the relationship 
between the questions and answers.  
 
Two research strategies were proposed in case studies 
[22] in order to review the technique to ensure that it is 
practical and sustainable. We were not simply looking for 
techniques to assist students to overcome their learning 
problems; we were also concerned that our technique could 
be easily used and adapted by educators anytime, anywhere 
and for any subject. 
 
Our future research study will seek to validate this 
technique in large classes and in programming subjects, to 
establish whether it is suitable to use in such contexts. Many 
concerns remain to be addressed: for example, is this 
technique able to support a large class of, say, 600 students? 
Is a learning tool a necessary aid for supporting resources 
and setting up a forum discussion? What are the limitations 
of this technique? These questions will roll into the next 
phase of our research investigation, which will be more in-
depth and analytical.
