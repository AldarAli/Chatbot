Abstract— 
Telecommunication 
services 
are 
expected  
to be of good quality and offered for a reasonable price. 
Operators, competing strongly for customers, always present 
their 
products 
in 
the 
best 
light, 
and 
underline  
the highest service quality, which is often measured  
in incomparable circumstances, using different procedures  
and measurement methods. The paper presents the efforts  
of European standards institutions, regulators and operators in 
the scope of improving the provision of telecommunication 
services and ensuring quality. The author presents the main 
parameters that influence the quality of Short Message Service, 
which represents a wide range of text messaging services and 
shows 
the 
method 
and 
environment 
for 
measuring  
end-to-end 
delivery 
time. 
The 
measurement 
scenarios 
performed in both the real network and also a laboratory 
environment are presented. The results of measurements, 
performed in the real networks of four operators in Poland, 
show that the message delivery time fluctuates during the course  
of the day and also depends on the operator. Generally however, 
the short text service is of good quality and is highly assessed by 
users. The author also presents also the quality of experience 
model for text messaging.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the last few decades, mobile telephony has reached  
a deeper level of penetration worldwide than cars, radio  
or TV. From over 700 million registered users in 2000, the 
mobile cellular industry has grown considerably and exceeded  
7 billion subscriptions in 2015. With the increased number  
of mobile subscribers over the world, Short Message Service 
(SMS), has gained a huge popularity among the users (around  
8 trillion messages a year) and is also described in numerous 
scientific papers [1-4]. Moreover, after voice, messaging is the 
biggest 
revenue-generating 
mobile 
service 
on 
the 
telecommunication market [5]. Although, in some countries 
SMS has peaked, and the traffic volumes are in decline, there 
are still more countries where overall SMS traffic and its use-
per-subscriber is still growing. A significant growth in mobile 
subscribers is observed in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and 
Latin America, thus the dominance of SMS in the immediate 
future is unthreatened. According to [5] SMS will be one  
of the major worldwide communication tools for the next 
decade, despite the progressive extension of user equipment 
utility. The increase in the processing power of mobile devices 
has made them significantly more multi-functional and allows 
Internet browsing, emailing, multimedia and instant 
messaging. Despite the rapid growth of the so called Over-
The-Top (OTT) messaging apps and Voice over IP (VoIP) 
services, 
SMS 
is 
still 
generating 
more 
than 
half  
of the total mobile messaging revenue (Fig. 1) [6].

Such large revenues mean that SMS will remain an 
important service for mobile operators for many years. While 
Instant Messaging (IM) and SMS are both text messaging 
services, there are differences that encourage different user 
behavior. IM is a two-way communication with many quick 
responses, whereas SMS is an individually paid-for message 
that is used to just send information. While there are low to 
zero costs for the user when using IM, travelers stick to using 
SMS as it is cheaper than purchasing a mobile data package 
or subscribing for a data roaming plan in order to send a few 
messages. SMS is common to all phones and almost all users 
[6] while IM usually requires smartphones with dedicated 
apps and specific knowledge of how to use it, which can be a 
barrier for some sections (older) of society. Moreover, the 
market for IM is fragmented by different services that cannot 
communicate with each other. Users also choose IM apps 
based on their geographical location. While WeChat and Line 
are clearly the leaders in China and Japan respectively, 
WhatsApp is also far bigger in East and South-East Asia than 
the USA. 
One of the major factors that allow service providers to 
keep their customers is the price, which is diminishing year by 
year, the next factors being common availability, simplicity. 
and good quality. Service quality is becoming an increasingly 
more important factor to users at the moment of choosing  
a network operator or service provider [2-8]. Thus, many

operators’ efforts are concentrated on the efficient 
mechanisms for handling the message traffic [9]. On the other 
hand, a service-oriented management is focused on service 
quality rather than network performance [10]. An effective 
evaluation of service quality can help a service provider to 
increase customer satisfaction which plays a key role in 
influencing a user’s decision on staying with or changing a 
provider. Soldani and al. [11] claim that over 80% of customer 
defections (churning) are due to frustration over the product 
or service and the inability of the provider/operator to deal 
with this effectively. Moreover, this is a chain reaction, where 
one frustrated customer will tell other people about his bad 
experience. An operator cannot assess the level of its service 
quality based on checking customer complaints, but should 
have a more active attitude as statistics have shown that for 
every person who calls with a problem, there are another 29 
who will never call. On the other hand, about 90% of 
customers will not complain before defecting. This churn 
directly affects the profitability and image of the operator or 
service provider. Thus, the way to avoid such situation is to 
devise a strategy to manage and improve the Quality of 
Experience (QoE) [12]. 
The QoE based research mechanism for control and 
management of resources is also getting more attention in 
literature [13-15]. The SMS quality evaluation is also 
important in terms of the professional deployment of the 
service [16]. It is of great importance to the many local 
governments (e.g., in Poland) that implement SMS to notify 
inhabitants and all people about emergency states [17]. There 
has been a noticeable increase in text messaging applications 
in healthcare, as a part of mobile Health (mHealth) programs, 
for behavior modification, disease management and 
surveillance, prevention and public health education, data 
collection, etc. [18, 19]. On the other hand, growing 
competition among service providers and network operators 
forces these entities to provide high quality services. The 
question of how to describe this quality and what parameters 
should be used, is asked not only by operators but also by 
regulators of the telecommunications market in the European 
Union [20]. One of the factors motivating telecommunications 
industry operators to act in this direction are regulations 
undertaken both at the European level [21, 22], and in 
individual Member States [23, 24]. A particular example of 
this can be seen in the case of Poland, where on the Electronic 
Communications Office’s initiative (2012), a Memorandum 
on Cooperation for Improving the Quality of Services  
in the Telecommunications Market has been signed.  
The first stage of works was finalized in the form  
of an official report [25], which was published by  
the Electronic Communications Office in February 2014. 
Despite long discussions, the current edition of this report 
does not define any QoS requirements for SMS, but there  
is a hope for a gradual expansion of the scope of this 
document. Although, SMS is not a real-time service,  
it is often perceived as such (a near-real-time) service [26]  
by a huge amount of users. Therefore, two factors seem to be 
important from the QoS point of view, these are: delivery rate 
and time of delivery. Nowadays, the delivery rate is mainly at 
a high level, reaching, in the case of many operators, values 
around 95% [17]. However, these factors are correlated with 
each other, because the delivery rate also depends, among 
other things, on the delivery threshold time after which the 
message is considered as lost. Therefore, delivery time seems 
to be a key performance indicator (KPI), which is much more 
crucial for the service quality perceived by the users. They 
want the information to be delivered in acceptable time. But 
what does it mean? In the era of information and 
communication technologies with more and more bandwidth 
and rich service offerings, user demands concerning the 
service are also growing. Today SMS is more often treated as 
an almost instantaneous communication medium for rapid 
exchange of information, and even a form of text dialogue 
between people [26]. The arrival delays could be a serious 
problem for time sensitive content such as customer account 
changes, last-minute tickets, product availability notifications 
etc. Online booking services and airlines, for example, already 
use SMS to notify travelers of the status of flights [27, 28]. 
A relatively short time of message delivery is one of the main 
factors describing SMS quality affecting its application and 
popularity among users. In Section II the author presents the 
basics of SMS functionality and the main parameters and 
statistics describing the quality of the service, according to the 
ETSI standards [29]. Section III describes the main 
prerequisites concerning service quality assessment in the real 
network. Sections IV and V present the method and tools used 
during measurements in the real network, taking into account 
connections inside one network and between different 
networks, 
respectively. 
The 
message 
delivery 
time 
distributions are also presented and discussed. In Section VI 
the author proposes, on the basis of measurements results, the 
Quality of Experience model for SMS. Section VII presents 
the conclusions and the plans for the future work. 
II. 
SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE QUALITY 
SMS, belonging to the so-called “non-real-time” class, is 
a “store-and-forward” type of service [30]. Communication 
between two users is done via at least one server, acting as an 
intermediary unit. A user’s equipment transmits a message to 
the server, which optionally sends it to the next server and so 
forth. The end server, after receiving the message, informs the 
recipient’s equipment of receiving a message and, finally, the 
user can read the message. SMS was originally designed for 
the transmission of text information, where the length of 
a single data unit cannot exceed 140 bytes and, according to 
ETSI standards [31], remains constant regardless of the 
number of characters transmitted in a single message. 
Depending on the alphabet used, the maximum message 
length may vary between 70 and 160 characters. When the 
information is longer, then it is divided and encapsulated into 
several 140-byte data units, and sent as separate messages. 
According to ITU-T recommendations the quality study 
presented in this paper only takes into account the information 
that does not exceed the size of a single data unit [32]. The test 
scenarios for concatenated message sending are for further 
study. On the other hand, ETSI standards give very detailed 
information regarding SMS quality parameters and their 
computation.

The most important parameters are: 
 
SMS Successful Ratio - the ratio of correctly sent 
messages, expressed by the probability of correct 
message sending and its delivery to a service center, 
 
Completion Rate for SMS - indicator of properly 
delivered messages, expressed by the percentage of 
messages 
successfully 
sent 
and 
delivered  
to a recipient, 
 
End-to-End Delivery Time for SMS - time  
to deliver a message from end to end, expressed  
as the time measured from the moment of sending  
a message by a sender to a service center until  
it is received by a recipient. 
Monitoring of the parameters, mentioned above, is crucial 
for the operator, who has to watch over the process of service 
delivery at every stage of its implementation. It gives the 
knowledge of network performance, which in turn impacts the 
quality of service [33]. The measurements can be done based 
on the following scenarios: 
 
using all real traffic in the network (in a specific 
period of time), 
 
using a sample of real traffic, 
 
making the test calls, 
 
a combination of the above. 
Message loss and message integrity are valid concerns, 
however, they are handled by lower layer network 
mechanisms and protocol, which are outside the scope of this 
paper. From the user’s point of view, it is very important that 
messages are delivered to the recipient as soon as possible and 
in an unchanged form. From this perspective, it can be seen 
that the parameter which probably has the strongest impact on 
the SMS quality, perceived by the user, is the End-to-End 
Delivery Time. 
According to the ETSI standard [29], the following 
statistics should be provided separately: 
 
the mean value in seconds for sending and receiving 
short messages, 
 
the time in seconds within which the fastest 95%  
of short messages are sent and received, 
 
the number of observations performed. 
It should be noted that, concerning the mobile 
environment, the values of QoS parameters, can be affected 
not 
only 
by 
congestion 
in 
the 
SMS 
system  
or signalling channels but also by network or service  
non-accessibility in the claimed area of coverage. In that case, 
operators 
may 
wish 
to 
distinguish 
the 
effects  
of coverage and access congestion. From the user’s point of 
view there is no need to do it, because all these phenomena 
have an impact on the end-user perception. 
III. 
MEASUREMENTS SET-UP 
The most representative for the network are statistics 
calculated from measurements on real traffic performed in a 
long period of time and in the whole network. This is 
obviously the most expensive case and it is therefore valuable 
to limit the measurements to the needed number and 
representative population of Network Termination Points 
(NTPs) or Service Access Points (SAPs). When sampling or 
test calls are used, it should be ensured that the results reflect 
the service quality perceived by customers. In general, the 
choice of adequate origin and destination NTPs for the 
measurements may be based on the national/international 
numbering plan, on traffic patterns/distribution or on 
geographic coverage. Measurements should be scheduled so 
as to reflect traffic variations over the hours of a day, the days 
of the week and even the months of the year [29]. Network 
specific characteristics and user behaviour, depending on the 
kind of networks under study, i.e., fixed, mobile or 
a combination of them, need to be taken into account. SMS 
quality assessment using an intrusive method (based on test 
messages sending) has the advantage to precisely analyse the 
service quality over defined configurations because it is an 
end to end analysis and correlates well with user perception. 
The main drawback of such a kind of method is that it provides 
a limited view of the quality of service provided by the 
operator or service provider, in general. This is due to 
a restriction of the measurements to the analysed test 
configuration or specific network area. It is obviously 
impossible to do such kinds of measurements everywhere in 
the network and it is therefore important to specify the number 
of measurement locations, so that the measurement points can 
be spread according to the size of the examined network. In 
practice, the drive tests are used to determine the quality of 
service that is experienced by users in main meeting places 
and communication paths. As a rule of thumb, the number of 
samples (tests) within a measurement campaign correlates 
with the reliability of results. In general, the higher the number 
of collected data samples, the more precise and trustworthy 
the results are. The number of observations for message 
delivery times depends, like the number of observations for 
any quantitative variables, on the variability of measured data. 
Therefore there is a need to perform some pilot tests or take 
into consideration the results of former measurements in the 
network in order to get some initial data. The number of 
observations can be calculated by formula (1):

– the expected standard deviation of the call

mean(x)  – the expected mean value of the measured 
value (from former measurements). 
𝑎  
– the relative accuracy.

Taking into account the number of tests to be performed 
and the usually limited time of measurement, particular 
attention should be paid to the scheduling of SMS tests. This 
means that a subsequent SM towards the same destination can 
affect the result of a previous SMS test if the second SM is 
sent before stating the result of the first one [31]. So, to avoid 
such a situation, a proper time interval between the sending of 
messages should be kept. An alternative way to increase the 
number of tests is by sending the SMs towards different 
destinations. In such a way, the queuing per destination 
mechanism is bypassed. 
IV. 
IN-NET MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED IN THE REAL 
ENVIRONMENT 
This Section presents the method, measurement 
environment, results, and evaluation of SMS quality provided 
by leading mobile operators functioning in Poland, i.e., 
Orange, Play, Plus and T-Mobile. 
A. Method and the Measurement Environment 
Data 
was 
collected 
from 
more 
than  
120 000 tests (individual observations) performed during one 
week in Wroclaw - one of the biggest cities in Poland  
(650 000 inhabitants). The test environment (Fig. 2) consists 
of measuring robots (one per operator), each covering a 
Personal Computer with a 3G modem and specially designed 
application that manages the measurement and data collection 
process. Each robot plays both roles: sender and receiver. 
Initially, the first one sends a previously prepared text 
message to the Short Message Service Center (SMSC) located 
in the operator network, inserting its own number (i.e., both: 
the sender and receiver belong to the same network) in the 
destination address field. The time of the message sending is 
written down into a special record of a log file on the robot’s 
hard disk. The SMSC then sends the message further, i.e., to 
the receiver, which in this situation is the same robot that sent 
the message before. Next, the receiving part of the robot is 
informed of the incoming message and then it also records the 
current time in the log file. In this way, the file collects a 
number of records with the times of sending and receiving the 
particular messages. In the next step the robot sends the 
message to another robot that is connected to the other 
operator’s network. All previous actions are repeated and then 
the next operator’s network is chosen as the destination in a 
round-robin scheme. The robot software allows the setting of 
the frequency of message sending in an order, based on 
message delivery time observed, in order to avoid traffic 
congestion (Fig. 3). 
 
Figure 2.  The test environment for the SMS parameter measurement in 
real mobile networks 
It should be noted that such a solution causes the risk of 
substantially reducing the number of tests when the delivery 
time increases enormously. In order to eliminate such 
phenomenon, it is possible to limit the maximum acceptable 
delivery time and, if it is overrun, the expected message may 
be recognized as lost. Then the sending of the next message 
can start. In this phase of the measurements such a time limit 
was not used so that the robots were able to capture all 
delivery time cases. 
 
Figure 3.  Sequential message sending scenario 
B. Message Delivery Time Distributions 
The measurements performed in real networks, as 
mentioned before, allowed the message delivery time 
distributions in each network to be determined (Figs. 4-7). 
After analysis of the distributions it can be stated that very 
long delivery times occur in the case of some operators (e.g., 
Play), which may be irritating to some customers. From 
a statistical point of view, however, they are not of 
considerable importance (it concerns about 10-4 cases). 
Moreover, it is negligible especially in the case of discarding 
5% of the highest values before further analysis. The majority 
of the captured message delivery times do not exceed 10 
seconds which means that SMS users should be satisfied. 
Moreover, almost 99% of the messages were delivered in 
a time of no higher than 6 seconds in the case of three 
operators. Only in the Play network the  message delivery time 
distribution was different. The question is: are the captured 
message delivery times satisfactory in the case of real time 
text messaging applications? More detailed analysis will be 
shown in the Section IV, where the scores of subjective 
measurements will be taken into account.

C. Message Delivery Time as a Function of the Time  
of Day 
Analysis of the results showed that message delivery time, 
as expected, is not stable and is diversified depending on the 
operator (see Table II). 
It can be noted that the lowest mean value of the message 
delivery time (3.6 s) occurred in the case of operator No. 3.

A slightly worse score can be seen in networks 1 and 4. 
The longest delivery times, as well as standard deviation, was 
offered by operator No. 2. Such rough analysis can lead us to 
the conclusion that the SMS does not work properly and many 
of 
users 
may 
be 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
service.  
On the other hand, when we take into account the median, 
which is by definition the value located in the middle  
of the population, it can be noted that it is comparable with the 
appropriate parameters of the other operators. Moreover, the 
median value seems to be a better parameter describing the 
service quality experienced by the users in the case  
of high standard deviation of QoS parameters. As mentioned 
before, ETSI proposes to describe the message delivery time 
by presenting the time within which the fastest 95% of short 
messages are sent and received [29]. According to the above, 
the distributions of message delivery times as a function  
of the time of day are presented in Figs. 8-11. The black points 
represent median values, whereas the dashed boxes show the 
ranges 
of 
delivery 
time 
after 
discarding 
5%  
of the lowest and highest values, respectively. In other words, 
they represent 90% of the population. Moreover, the top level

Figure 11.  Short message delivery time in the T-Mobile network as a

denotes the highest limit of delivery time for 95%  
of messages sent in the relevant hour [29]. As presented  
in Fig. 4, fluctuations of the message delivery time 
experienced by almost all SMS users of the Orange network, 
do not exceed the value of 6 seconds. The highest deviation is 
observed at around 3 and 5 o’clock in the morning.  
The results of the observations performed in the Play network 
show the values of delivery time deviation that are almost at 
the same level, except for one hour (7 a.m.), during the whole 
day. However, compared to the Orange network, the range of 
deviations, observed in the individual time intervals,  
is much wider here. Moreover, it can be seen that users of the 
Play network experience relatively high fluctuations of 
message delivery times not only in specific hours but during 
the whole day. It should be noted that the median values and 
deviations of the message delivery times, presented in 
Figs. 8- 11, are valid for 90% of observations and may slightly 
differ from the values shown in Table I, which takes into 
account all the captured data. Although the median (or even 
the mean) values of the message delivery times and their 
deviations can be used to compare the different operator’s 
network performances or QoS parameters, they do not answer 
the question concerning the quality assessed by the users. For 
this reason, the relation between objectively measured QoS 
parameters and the quality of experience (QoE), which is 
subjective, should be determined. 
V. 
INTER-NET MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED IN THE 
REAL ENVIRONMENT 
In this section, the author presents the second part of the 
measurements performed in the real network. This is an 
extension of the previous investigations and not only covers 
separate measurements performed in networks of different 
operators (In-Net) but also takes into account relations 
between networks (Inter-Net) as well. Although the operators 
remained the same, the author changed the location of the 
measurements from an urban to rural area of the same part of 
Poland (Lower Silesia district).

A. Method and the Measurement Environment 
Each “inter-operator” relation is described by 1440 
measurements, i.e., one measurement per minute (60 samples 
per hour), which results in more than 23 000 measurements in 
total. The test environment consists of measuring robots (one 
for the operator), analogous to the ones presented in Fig. 2. 
However, the measurement scenario was extended to inter-
network investigations. In order to compare Inter-Net 
relations, the author, as a first step, performed the In-Net 
investigations for each network separately. The author does 
not analyse delivery times as a function of the time of day but 
shows how the examined networks fulfil ETSI requirements 
[29, 30]. One of the main parameters, as mentioned before, is 
the time in seconds within which the fastest 95% of short 
messages are sent and received. Therefore, the cumulative 
distribution function (CDF) of the message end-to-end 
delivery times is determined for each operator. 
 
Figure 12.  Cumulative Distribution Function of end-to-end message 
delivery time in the Orange network 
 
Figure 13.  Probability Density Function of end-to-end message delivery 
time in the Orange network 
Figure 12 shows that at least 95% of messages in the 
examined (rural) area of the Orange network are delivered in 
a time of no longer than 16 s. That is more than twice as long 
as in the urban area tested before (see Fig. 4). Moreover, as 
presented in Fig. 13, these times are of higher deviation and 
most of the messages are delivered between the 10th and 12th 
second. Significantly longer delivery times were observed in 
the Play network, where 95% of messages were delivered to 
their destination in a time exceeding 30 seconds (Fig. 14). 
It is interesting that most of the messages reach the 
receiving station, as in the Orange network, in comparable 
time, i.e., in less than 10 seconds. Twelve seconds are needed 
to deliver 84% of the messages. However, very long delivery 
times are observed here more often than in the case of 
measurements in the urban area. As presented in Fig. 15, over 
7% of messages are delivered in a time exceeding 30 seconds.

The fact that the vast majority of messages in the Play 
network are delivered in a relatively short time can positively 
influence user perception of the service. On the other hand, a 
fairly large amount of messages are delivered in a time of 
longer than 30 s, which means that 95% of them are delivered 
in the longest time when compared with the other examined 
networks. 
The Plus and T-Mobile networks behave in similar way to 
the Orange network, which means that 95% of messages are 
delivered in a time of less than 20 seconds (in the case of the 
last two it is 18 s) and the observed delivery times are of a 
standard deviation that is significantly lower than in the Play 
network (Fig. 16-Fig. 19).

delivery time in the Plus network

Figure 18.  Cumulative Distribution Function of end-to-end message 
delivery time in the T-Mobile network 
 
Figure 19.  Probability Density Function of end-to-end message delivery 
time in the T-Mobile network 
Analysis of the message delivery process shows that the 
mean value of message delivery times, in the case of messages 
exchanged between users belonging to different operator 
networks, is usually higher than in the case of transmitting 
them inside an individual network. Exceptions to this rule are 
seen in the Play and Orange networks where In-Net 
measurements show comparable or even higher mean values 
of message delivery times (Tables III and IV). In almost every 
network the maximum values of message delivery times 
significantly exceed the mean values (even 20 times or more). 
Additionally, high values of standard deviation of delivery 
times are observed for almost all the operators. An exception 
to the rule is the Plus network, where these times are low and 
rather stable, i.e., of low standard deviation. It concerns both, 
In-Net and Inter-Net measurements as well.

For all the In-Net and Inter-Net relations a median value 
of message delivery time was determined. As presented in 
Tables III and IV, in most cases and due to asymmetry of its 
probability distributions, these values significantly differ 
from the mean values. Analysis of the data shows non-zero 
(positive) skewness, which denotes that most of the delivery 
times measured are lower than the calculated mean value. It 
suggests that the median value should not be treated as the 
main performance indicator, describing quality of the service. 
In general, the median is better suited for skewed 
distributions, like in our cases, to derive a central tendency 
since it is much more robust and sensible. If the median is not 
equal to the mean, it is an indicator for statistical outliers, i.e., 
a small number of extreme measurement data values that 
significantly influence the mean value [34]. From a statistical 
point of view it is understandable, but from a practical point 
of view the median value additionally gives us information 
about the so called common user perception of the service 
quality. Even if the mean value of message delivery time is 
high, a median value could be quite moderate, which denotes 
that the vast majority of the users are satisfied with the service 
quality.  
As mentioned before, from a practical point of view, the 
message delivery time is the most relevant statistic for at least 
95% of messages [29]. The results are presented in Table V. 
More detailed analysis of the longest delivery times for 
95% of the fastest messages, with the participation of the 
stations connected to the Play network, showed that these 
times are as follows: 
 
 
 
75 s  – for messages inside the Play network, 
 
560 s – for messages sent from the Play to Orange 
 
  
network, 
 
240 s – for messages sent from the T-Mobile 
 
  
to Play network.

Such long delivery times are usually acceptable for

VI. 
QOE MODEL 
This paragraph presents the method and test-bed for 
assessing the quality experienced by users (QoE) of text 
messaging services. When identifying QoE metrics in general, 
there are as many different expectations as there are users, but 
most of these expectations can be grouped under two main 
categories: reliability and quality [11]. The main KPIs, in the 
service reliability dimension, are: 
 
availability (anywhere), 
 
accessibility (anytime), 
 
access time (setup time), 
 
continuity (service retainability). 
 
The quality category can be described by the second group 
of KPIs as follows: 
 
quality of session, 
 
bitrate, 
 
active session throughput, 
 
system responsiveness, 
 
packet loss, 
 
end-to-end delay and delay variation. 
 
Depending on the type of service, the value of each of 
these metrics translates to a different level of impact on the 
actual QoE. Some can be totally irrelevant in one case while

being the most important in another. The most important KPIs 
for SMS users seem to be end-to-end delay and its variation. 
The concept of the measurement environment is based on 
the server emulating the service provider and also several test 
positions representing user terminal equipments (Fig. 20). 
Each position consists of a Personal Computer (PC) with a 
special application emulating the mobile phone. A group of 
testers (40 selected users) send and receive short messages 
(1200 in total). In the experiment all test messages have the 
same format and content. 
 
 
Figure 20.  The laboratory test environment for the evaluation of text 
messaging Quality of Experience 
The users send a number of messages which are passed 
through the server to the destination addresses after a period 
of time. This may be controlled during the test. After receiving 
the message, users assess the service quality by evaluating the 
end-to-end delivery time and choosing the appropriate marks 
from the MOS evaluation panel, where MOS stands for Mean 
Opinion Score, expressed in a 5-level scale (0 – the worst case 
and 5 – the best one, respectively). All the test parameters and 
user marks are stored on the server and saved for further 
analysis. Several dozen users took part in the experiment and 
more than 1.2 thousand tests were performed. The results of 
the tests allowed a QoE model to be built (2), which indicates 
a relationship between end-to-end message delivery time and 
service quality perceived by the users. Statistical analysis 
shows a significant correlation (almost 80%) between 
message delivery times and the users’ evaluation grades. 
Next, regression analysis was performed and, using ordinary 
least squares (OLS) estimation, the approximate relation 
between message delivery time and users’ grades (in MOS 
scale) was determined: 

+4.97
MOS= -0.1
T


 
where: T - message delivery time. 
 
Due to the fact the distribution of the data was not normal 
(checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test [35]), the author made  
a validation of the model, using the Mann–Whitney–
Wilcoxon (MWW) test [36]. The test can even be applied on 
unknown distributions, contrary to the t-test, which can only 
be applied on normal distributions [37]. This test showed a 
good estimation of the users’ quality perception, under 
assumption of 95% confidence interval (significance level 
p<0.05). 
As was mentioned before, the mean value of the QoS 
parameter 
may 
not 
always 
be 
the 
best 
indicator  
of the network performance or the quality perceived  
by users. Therefore, the author presented the SMS QoE 
model, which shows the relation between the message 
delivery times and the median values of user ratings (Fig. 21). 
Thus, the author proposed a new name for the scale, i.e., 
Median Opinion Score (MedOS). The black points represent 
the median value, whereas the upper level of the dashed boxes 
determines the scores given by the 95% of users experiencing 
the specific message delivery times. Four levels of quality, 
acceptable by users, were defined, i.e., excellent quality (EQ), 
good quality (GQ), fair quality (FQ) and poor quality (PQ), 
respectively. 
 
 
Figure 21.  The quality experienced by the users majority (MedOS scale) 
Next, four ranges of the message delivery times were assigned 
to the proper quality levels (EQ, GQ, FQ or PQ) on the basis 
of median values of user scores, given for those times (see the 
dashed ellipses in Fig. 21). According to ETSI [29], the 
quality levels should take into account the best 95% of 
samples (here messages). The Excellent Quality level, 
denoted by EQ(95), is reached when the median of user scores 
is equal to 5, and 95% of the samples have ratings equal or 
higher than 4.

The same procedure is applied to the other quality levels 
(there were no scores falling into the poor quality range). In 
this way, the relations between the message delivery times 
(QoS) and proper quality levels (QoE) were determined. 
Table VI presents, according to the MedOS scale, the 
measurement results obtained from the four examined real 
networks. Next, the Weighted Average Quality Factor 
(WAQF) was calculated using (3).

In this case the WAQF differs considerably from the In-
Net results obtained in the urban area, which were higher. On 
the other hand, there was no significant difference between In-
Net and Inter-Net results observed in the rural area. 
WAQF seems to be used as one of the parameters that 
allow a comparison of the SMS quality provisioned by 
different operators. However, it is necessary to be very careful 
when drawing general conclusions concerning QoE in the 
examined networks based on this factor due to the fact there 
is no simple relation between these measures. This should be 
a matter of further investigation. 
More detailed statistical analysis seems to be good in such 
a case and the median value and the time within which the 
fastest 95% of short messages are sent and received [29] 
should at least be taken into account. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Nowadays, the text messaging is one of the most popular 
means of communication and a high quality of the service is 
therefore crucial in today’s competitive market. Operators 
should 
continuously 
monitor 
network 
performance 
parameters in order to detect and isolate the problems and 
different kinds of threats that can impact on the quality 
experienced by the end-users. Thus, it is very important  
to not only have knowledge about the values of objectively 
measured performance parameters, but also about their 
influence on the service quality subjectively perceived by 
users. The results presented in the article show that the SMS 
provisioned by the operators functioning in the examined area 
of the Polish telecommunication market is of very good 
quality and can be used, to some extent, as a medium which 
also supports other kinds of text communication, especially 
those that require short end-to-end delivery times and 
immediate user-to-user interactions. Obviously, message 
delivery time fluctuates during the course of the day and also 
depends on the operator, but generally brings great 
satisfaction to users. It should also be noted that such a 
relatively small amount of collected data does not allow to a 
general statement about the whole Polish network to be made. 
Such a generalization could be made after collecting data from 
a bigger and representative number of selected areas, which 
will be done in the next step of the investigations. The author 
plans to build a Service Quality Monitoring System, which 
will be prepared to measure SMS KPIs in a wider area using 
so called drive tests and a central management system that will 
control the measurement scenarios and data collection. All 
data will be centrally processed and presented on a web-page. 
It should be underlined that although SMS cannot be 
treated as a real-time messaging service, it can in some cases 
be used as an alternative. The main strengths of SMS are 
worldwide availability and the fact that there are no special 
requirements for user equipment or any specific software 
applications. Further work will be devoted to developing the 
QoE model towards a more comprehensive investigation of 
the quality issues, regarding not only intra- but also inter-
operator communication.
