Abstract—This paper is research into how to optimize the sen-
sitivity values of an installed gyroscope in the autonomous 
guided vehicle with a magnet-gyro guided system. A magnet-
gyro guided system mostly uses a MEMS gyroscope, which is 
small-sized, uses little power, and costs little. However, the 
MEMS gyroscope needs a high sensitivity value for changing 
angular velocity in each environment, not only due to the ne-
cessity of an accurate sensitivity value for the measured angle 
value but also due to the difference between the measured an-
gle and sensitivity value. The sensitivity value describes the 
specifications of the sensor, but the sensitivity value is influ-
enced by the given environment or gradient. Therefore, the 
optimization process is required for the sensitivity value of the 
installed gyroscope in the environment. A number of optimiza-
tion algorithms have been studied, but we chose the Dynamic 
Encoding Algorithm for Searches (DEAS) and the Genetic Al-
gorithm (GA) to optimize the sensitivity value. We used an 
AGV with laser navigation for experiments in this paper. We 
did 5 experiments for each change of the rotation angle - 30, 40, 
50, 60° - and compared the calculations of the sensitivity value 
of optimization through the DEAS and the GA. The experi-
ment results confirm that the optimization sensitivity values of 
the DEAS contain less error than the optimization sensitivity 
value by the GA algorithm.

 INTRODUCTION  
An Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) is a large mo-
bile robot that can load and unload freights to the appointed 
position within either a fixed or unfixed path. Because it 
does not require manpower, AGVs can reduce wages and 
fatal accidents. Localization and position estimations are 
examples that use AGV technology [1]-[3]. Localization is a 
categorized wire and wireless guide method. The wire-
guided method is a means for an AGV with detection by an 
attached or laid guideline to the floor. This method is used 
for safety reasons, but requires installation and maintenance. 
The wireless guide method remedies the wire guide meth-
od’s shortcomings. It induces an AGV through a laser or an 
attached landmark to the ceiling or surface of a wall instead 
of a floor guideline. The wireless guide method has the ad-
vantage of not requiring installation of a guideline by driving 
an imaginary guideline. A typical device that uses the wire-
less guide method is laser navigation. Laser navigation has a 
±25mm localization accuracy. It is also easy to modify the 
driving line, and extend workspace. But this comes at the 
cost of a slow response speed of 250ms, a big error of locali-
zation at a high speed or rotation driving. The magnet-gyro 
guide method is a new method to gain the advantages from 
both the wire and wireless guide methods. This method can 
induce an AGV by the measured magnet field information 
through installed magnets in the floor. The measured angular 
velocity by a gyroscope when there is no magnet, when the 
magnet is detected, the position and the angle of an AGV 
revise by the information of the detected magnet [4][5]. This 
method does not require the trouble of installation and 
maintenance of the wire guided method, and resolves the 
high cost of the wireless-guided method. Accuracy of the 
gyroscope for a position estimation of the vehicle is of im-
portance in the magnet-gyro guide method because it induces 
an AGV by the measured yaw angle by the gyroscope when 
driving the gap of magnets. Commercialized gyroscope with 
a high accuracy is restricted to the AGV, because of its big 
size and large power consumption. The gyroscope of a Micro 
Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) was used for AGV 
miniaturization and low power. However, the MEMS gyro-
scope has problems such as low bias safety, low accuracy 
through noises, and low performance of straightness in com-
parison to the commercialized gyroscope. Generally, to cal-
culate the sensitivity value for the angular velocity of the 
MEMS gyroscope, the representative value of the sensor 
specification must be used. However, because the sensitivity 
value is influenced by the given environment or gradient, an 
optimization method is required for the sensitivity value of 
the installed gyroscope in the environment. The existing op-
timization methods that use differentiation are complicated 
and need many arithmetic operations. So calculating the op-
timized sensitivity value is very difficult. Dynamic Encoding 
Algorithm for Searches (DEAS) optimization algorithm fits a 
Micro Control Unit (MCU) with a limited performance be-
cause the DEAS algorithm searches a global optimization 
solution without differentiation. This paper makes a compar-
ison between the DEAS and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in 
order to make a performance evaluation of the DEAS opti-
mization algorithm. This paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents the measurement system for a MEMS gyro-
scope. Section 3 goes into details regarding DEAS and GA 
algorithms for the optimization sensitivity value of the 
MEMS gyroscope. Section 4 mentions the experiments con-
ducted and the results. Lastly, Section 5 is the conclusion of 
this paper.

MEASUREMENT SYSTEM 
A. Experimental system 
To experiment using the proposed method, an axel-
driven fork type AGV with a built-in laser navigation was 
used. Laser navigation can measure global location. It is in-
stalled on top of the AGV to protect disturbances, and 
measures global position by using reflectors.

Figure 2.  Hardware configuration of the AGV 
The forklift-type AGV and the hardware configuration 
used in the experiment are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respec-
tively. In Figure 2, industrial PC is used for rapid research 
and development. DAQ is used to control the driving parts of 
a manufactured forklift type. The position data of laser navi-
gation is received through DSP every 500ms and the linear 
velocity of an encoder is received through DSP every 25ms. 
Transmission rates of MEMS gyroscope and magnet posi-
tioning system are 25ms and 100ms respectively. The data of 
the sensors is transferred from AVR to DSP. Encoders and 
gyroscope are used to measure a local position to compen-
sate for the low response speed of laser navigation. The 
gathered data is sent to an industrial PC by DSP with RS-232 
serial communication. Table 1 is the specification of in-
stalled sensors. The localization accuracy of laser navigation 
as a global positioning sensor depends on the number of rec-
ognized reflectors, and the distances between the sensor and 
reflectors. The sensor has a positioning accuracy of ±4mm 
and an angle accuracy of ±0.1°. MEMS gyroscope used in 
this experiment was designed by ADXRS613, AT90CAN-
128 and 12bit ADC.

The output of MEMS gyroscope is influenced by temper-
ature variation. The angular velocity value and the tempera-
ture value of the MEMS gyroscope are measured every 25ms. 
The output of gyroscope (O+) depending on temperature is 
calculated using equation (1).

C is the central output value of a gyroscope (0 ~ 4096: 
2048). S is the sensitivity of the gyroscope, with an average 
value of 0.0125V/°/s in the datasheet. In this paper, the cen-
tral value of the gyroscope is calculated by averaging 1000 
data points obtained in the stop state of AGV. The ADC val-
ue of the gyroscope in a stop state is between 2034 and 2042. 
We used 2039 as the average output value. However, gyro-
scope has errors because the sensitivity of the installed envi-
ronment of the sensor is not considered. To use MEMS gyro-
scope sensor as a navigation system, direct optimization is 
needed as a measurement system within a built-in MEMS 
gyroscope. 
III. 
SENSITIVITY OPTIMIZATION 
The sensitivity of gyroscope changes depends on the en-
vironment of the gyroscope’s installed place and slope. To 
improve performance of the gyroscope, sensitivity optimiza-
tion should be fulfilled in MCU with measured data in real 
time, because of the computation time and complex algo-
rithm structure in existing optimization algorithms with sto-
chastic or direct search, etc. Therefore the optimization algo-
rithm for sensor needs a low computation for operating in 
real time. This paper proposes a simple and rapid method to 
optimize the sensitivity of the gyroscope through DEAS. 
A. Dynamic encoding algorithm for searches 
Existing optimization algorithms with derivative methods 
have high computation time. It is not suitable in real time.

Thus, sensitivity values should be directly optimized in 
MCU to consider the environment of a gyroscope. It is obvi-
ous that existing algorithms cannot be used if it has a high 
computation time. However, a DEAS algorithm can find 
both a local and global optimal solution of a cost function by 
using well-planned computer operations, which has a good 
operation time to performance [6][7]. The implementation of 
DEAS is simple. DEAS can also rapidly search optimal solu-
tions on a low-spec computer because its source code is op-
timized by denoting a solution by binary code. It can solve 
nonlinear optimal problems as well as linear problems. 
DEAS is divided into two groups, local search plan and 
global search plan. Figure 5 represents the flow chart of the 
DEAS algorithm. 
B. Local search strategy 
DEAS is composed of Bisectional Search (BSS) and 
Unidirectional Search (UDS). Local search plan is optimized 
by using the features of a binary string. If 1 is pasted in LSB, 
the real number is increased, and if 0, it decreases. The BSS 
step is to paste 0 or 1 into the LSB of binary string and to 
determine the search direction. This step creates neighbor 
search locations at mutually opposite sides from the current 
search location. It can improve optimization and resolution 
about solution space. The USD step explores the local area 
until it finds the optimal value of the cost function. Figure 3 
represents the flow chart of BSS. The BSS step tries to boost 
resolution by changing the length of the binary string and 
concentrates on finding the optimal solution. This step de-
cides search locations near the current location. It initializes 
data except for the investigated optimal binary string in the 
previous section and pastes 0 and 1 at LSB of the binary 
string to create two neighbor search locations. The following 
equation (3) is applied to decode the binary string of generat-
ed neighbor search locations to be a value between 0 and 1, 
where b is the place value of the binary string and m is the 
length of the binary string. Optimal value is selected by 
comparing the calculated cost values. The binary string with 
optimal value is passed to the UDS step.

A cost value of a selected neighbor location is calculated 
by adapting the decoded value in a cost function. USD has a 
global search feature to search a wide range of neighbor lo-
cations, which is decided by the unmodified state (to change 
length of binary string from BSS).

Also, the BSS step is just done just once but the UDS 
step is repetitively done until the value of the cost function is 
improved. Figure 4 represents the flow chart of the UDS step. 
In Figure 4, Ot is a currently-selected optimal solution, Ot-1 is 
a previously selected optimal solution. The UDS step has 
two stages that are the Limit and Overlap stages. The Limit 
stage is a process to exclude the maximum and minimum 
binary strings in the UDS step. The Overlap stage is a pro-
cess to exclude the previous optimal solution. 
C. Global search strategy 
The global search plan is performed to prevent being 
trapped in the local optimal solution by changing initial 
search locations. The global search plan can search a solution 
value by repetitively performing local optimal algorithms 
(change initial location). Figure 6 represents a flow chart of 
the global search plan. In Figure 6, t represents the number 
of performed global searches and n is the specified number 
of searches. In the local search plan, the searched location is 
stored as history to prevent searching previously searched 
locations.

D. Genetic Algorithm 
GA is one of the most famous algorithms in the field of 
optimization algorithms. Here it is used to evaluate the per-
formance of the DEAS algorithm. GA, as stochastic search 
method, uses the natural phenomenon of genetic inheritance 
and competition for survival as its model. Figure 7 represents 
a flow chart of GA to optimize sensitivity of MEMS gyro-
scope. The repetition count number of GA is 100 in this pa-
per. GA has crossover and reproduction operators. Two 
highly fitted chromosomes are selected in crossover. 50% of 
total chromosomes are selected as the next generation in re-
production. 
E. Sensitivity value optimization of gyroscope 
The proposed optimization algorithm of gyroscope’s left 
and right sensitivities is searched through DEAS by using 
angle data of laser navigation after making AGV turn a full 
360°. Figure 8 represents the flow chart of sensitivity opti-
mization. SR is the sensitivity of right turning and SL sensi-
tivity of left turning. ESR is a sensitivity error of right turn-
ing and ESL is a sensitivity of left turning. The following 
equation is a cost function to calculate ESR and ESL. Where 
O+ is the calculated gyroscope’s output through equation (4), 
N is the number of data.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
A. Experiment Environment 
Pillar type reflectors are attached at the wall to measure 
the localization of laser navigation in an 840 x 2,010 cm ex-
perimental space.  The laser navigation used in this paper is 
SICK’s NAV200. The position can be measured with an ac-
curacy of ±4 ~ 20 mm error. The experimental environment 
is Figure 9. The AGV is rotated 360° after the steer angle is 
fixed using laser navigation, and the raw data of the MEMS 
gyroscope is saved. The AGV is driven to turn left and right, 
each 2 times. The saved raw data of gyroscope is optimized 
using DEAS and GA in each turn direction. To evaluate the 
performance of the two algorithms, we compare the calculat-

C. 360° left turn driving test 
The result of the right turn experiment in the same condi-
tion with left turn is as in the following table. As Table 3 
shows, the sensitivity on the left turn using DEAS is 
0.0250021V/°/25ms and the sensitivity using GA is 
0.0251250V/°/25ms. The average errors on the right 360° 
turn driving are 3.4855°, 4.1265° on each algorithm. The 
average error using specification is 45.0002°. For left turn 
driving, less error occurred using sensitivity calculations than 
in using specification. This is because the sensitivity of spec-
ification does not consider the environment of the gyroscope 
such as tilt and electric noise, among others.  
Figure 10 shows error using optimized sensitivity 
through each algorithm. As verified in Figure 10, the left part 
in the boxplot is the experiment result (angle error) of the

right turn driving test and the right part is the experiment 
result of the left turn driving. In the result, errors using 
DEAS and GA are lower than errors of specification values 
from the left/right turn-driving experiment. However, GA is 
not proper in MCU because it requires high computation to 
show good performance. DEAS is proper in MCU, which 
finds the optimal solution of cost function by only using 
well-planned operations.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we implemented and compared perfor-
mances using DEAS and GA, which are well known optimi-
zation methods. Sensitivity optimization of MEMS gyro-
scope is very important due to low angular velocity accuracy 
and a low straightness performance. Therefore, a sensitivity 
value of a gyroscope should be optimized from MCU to 
measure the data of a gyroscope. Because existing optimiza-
tion methods have high computation and complex algorithms, 
it is difficult to apply in MCU. However, a well-planned 
DEAS algorithm is simple and has a lower computation time 
than the existing algorithm. Therefore, this paper suggests 
sensitivity optimization of a gyroscope through DEAS. To 
verify the performance of the proposed method, we com-
pared the result of DEAS with the result of GA. As for ex-
perimental results, the average error using sensitivity of 
specification (in gyroscope datasheet) was 45.0002°, 45.0002° 
on turns right and left, respectively. The average error of 
sensitivity value through DEAS and GA from right turn driv-
ing respectively are 3.4855°, 3.5347°, and the result of left 
turn driving are 3.4855°, 4.1265° respectively. As calculated 
error using optimized sensitivity through DEAS and GA, 
average errors on right turn driving are 0.0250065°, 
0.0250100° and on left turn driving is 0.0250021°, 
0.0251250°. As the results show, the proposed method had a 
better performance than the result of specification. As part of 
future research, we plan to study what reduces drift and
