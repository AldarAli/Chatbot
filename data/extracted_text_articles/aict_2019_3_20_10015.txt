Abstract—We have been studying on applying the named data 
networking technology to mobile ad hoc networks.  We suppose 
a type of ad hoc networks that advertise versatile information in 
public spaces such as shopping mall and museum.  The proposed 
approach is a hybrid one where a proactive routing is used in 
the producer side network, and a reactive routing is used in the 
consumer side network.  The proactive routing here has a 
feature that only the name prefix advertisement is focused on.  
In the reactive routing, only the first Interest packet is flooded 
and the corresponding Data packet creates a routing entry.  
Although we reported some results of the performance 
evaluation of the proposed method previously, they are still 
insufficient.  In this paper, we show the results of performance 
evaluation focusing on the node moving in the consumer side 
network.  The results indicate that our proposal has little 
overhead both for Interest packet transfer and routing control.

Routing; Proactive Routing; Reactive Routing. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the Information Centric Network (ICN) is 
widely studied as a future Internet architecture well suited for 
large scale content distribution.  The Named Data Networking 
(NDN) [1] is adopted widely as a platform for ICN research 
activities.  The fundamental concept in NDN is the name of 
required content, not the address of hosts containing content.  
A consumer requesting a content sends an Interest packet 
containing the content name.  A producer providing the 
corresponding content data returns a Data packet to the 
consumer.  NDN routers transferring the Data packet cache 
the packet for future redistribution. 
Originally, NDN is designed for wired network topology, 
but it can be effectively applied to wireless multi-hop ad hoc 
network topology.  In wireless ad hoc network, the routing 
mechanism is more important research topic than wired fixed 
network, because network nodes move around.  In NDN, the 
purpose of routing is how to construct Forwarding 
Information Base (FIB) for name prefixes, which specifies the 
correspondence between a name prefix and an interface called 
face (or a neighbor identifier) to the content with this name 
prefix.   
In the previous papers, we proposed a new NDN ad hoc 
routing scheme [2][3], which is targeting at ad hoc networks 
providing various useful information in public spaces, such as 
station, shopping mall and museum.  Content providers 
advertise helpful information for users, such as location map, 
advertising catalog, and exhibition details.  The proposed 
scheme adopts a hybrid approach, which has the following 
features.  First, in the type of ad hoc networks we suppose, a 
content producer side has a stable network where producers 
and intermediate routers are located in fixed positions.  On the 
other hand, consumers are mobile nodes which change their 
locations quite often.  Therefore, a proactive routing is 
adopted in a producer side network, because of its in-advance 
route setting, and a reactive routing is adopted in a consumer 
side network, because of its flexibility for mobility.  The 
second is about the procedure of proactive routing.  The NDN 
proactive routing procedures proposed so far [4]-[8] are 
focusing on advertising both the network topology and the 
name prefix.  On the other hand, the proactive routing adopted 
in our proposal is focusing on just the name prefix 
advertisement.  The third is about the procedure of reactive 
routing.  The reactive routing of our proposal uses both FIB 
and PIT.  Although the first Interest packet for a specific name 
prefix is flooded, the corresponding FIB entry is created by 
the returning Data packet and the following Interest packets 
for the name prefix are transferred by this FIB entry.   
Although the basic idea was presented in our previous 
papers, the performance evaluation results described in those 
papers and another paper [9] are limited, because they only 
provide rather simple theoretical analysis and do not evaluate 
detailed behaviors of routing protocols.   
This paper describes the detailed results of the 
performance evaluation for the routing control and Interest 
transfer overheads focusing on moving consumer side nodes.  
The performance evaluation is conducted with ndnSIM [10], 
a widely used NDN simulator implemented over the ns-3 
network simulator [11].  The rest of this paper consists of the 
following sections.  Section 2 shows the related work on NDN 
routing. Section 3 describes our NDN ad hoc routing protocol. 
Section 4 shows the implementation of the proposed protocol 
over ndnSIM and the results of the performance evaluation.  
Section 5 concludes this paper.   
II. RELATED WORK ON NDN ROUTING 
There are several proposals on the routing in NDN.  For 
the wired NDN topology, the proposed named OSPFN [4] and 
NSLR [5] are examples introduced in an early stage.  Both of 
them are based on the link state routing protocol, which 
maintains and advertises link statuses between neighbors, 
shares the topology information, and creates routing tables 
from it.  The protocol in [6] is a relatively new proposal based 
on the link state routing considering multipath routing.   
In the case of the NDN based wireless ad hoc network, 
both the proactive and the reactive approaches are proposed 
[12].  This trend is the same as the IP based ad hoc network.  
MobileCCN [7] and TOP-CCN [8] are examples of the 
proactive routing mechanism.  MobileCCN can be said an

NDN version of Routing Information Protocol (RIP) [13].  
TOP-CCN is an NDN version of Optimized Link State 
Routing (OLSR) [14].  On the other hand, E-CHANET [15] 
and REMIF [16] are examples of reactive routing mechanism, 
which are designed based on Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance 
Vector routing (AODV) [17].  In these reactive routing 
mechanisms, FIB is not used at all, but Interest packets are 
flooded to find producers or cached Data packets.  Only 
Pending Interest Table (PIT) is used for forwarding Data 
packets.   
The proactive routing can create FIB responding to an up-
to-date network topology, but has some overhead of routing 
control message exchange.  On the contrary, the reactive 
routing has no overhead of routing, but has some overhead of 
Interest packet transfer.   
III. HYBRID ROUTING PROTOCOL FOR NDN AD HOC 
NETWORK 
A. Overview of Proposed Routing Protocol 
We have adopted the following design principles for our 
hybrid NDN based routing mechanism.  
 As described above, we divide a whole NDN network 
into the producer side and the consumer side.  In the 
producer side, NDN nodes including producers and 
intermediate routers have their location fixed.  So, a 
proactive routing mechanism is introduced in this part.  
On the other hand, the consumer side includes mobile 
nodes working as consumers or intermediate routers.  
Those nodes move around and the network 
configuration often changes.  In this part, a reactive 
routing mechanism is introduced.   
 For the producer side, our proactive routing focuses 
only on name prefix advertisement.  It constructs a 
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) starting from each 
producer.  An FIB entry for a specific name prefix is 
given by pointing upstream nodes traversing the 
corresponding DAG in a reverse direction.  If there are 
more than one upstream nodes, both of them are 
registered in the entry and used for multipath 
forwarding [18].   
 In order to create a DAG for a specific name prefix, 
the corresponding producer issues a Name Prefix 
Announcement Request (NPAreq) packet.  It is 
broadcasted, and if any receiving NDN nodes are on 
the corresponding DAG, they return a Name Prefix 
Announcement Reply (NPArep) packet by unicast.   
 As for the consumer side, NDN nodes do not use any 
control packets for routing.  Instead, the FIB entry is 
created by the first Interest packet for a name prefix.  
The first Interest packet is flooded throughout the 
consumer side, and after it reaches some node in the 
producer side, this Interest packet is transferred to the 
producer.  When the corresponding Data packet 
returned, a temporary FIB entry is created at the nodes 
in consumer side.  For the following Interest packets 
for the same name prefix, this FIB entry is used.  
B. Communication Sequence of Proposed Protocol 
Figure 1 shows an example of communication sequence of 
the proposed protocol focusing on the consumer side behavior.  
Figure 1(a) is an example network, where the producer side 
nodes construct a DAG whose root is producer node 2.  As 
shown in Figure 1(b), when consumer node p starts the content 
retrieval for name prefix name, the first Interest packet is 
flooded among the consumer side nodes.  The Interest packet 
arriving at node 6 is transferred according to the DAG, via 
node 5 to node 2.  When the corresponding Data packet returns, 
the corresponding FIB entry is created at nodes q and p.  The 
following Interest packets will be transferred using these FIB 
entries.   
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, we describe the results of performance 
evaluation using the ndnSIM simulator version 1.0.   
A. Simulation conditions 
Figure 2 shows the network configuration used in the 
simulation.  In the fields of 300 m by 200 m, four producer 
side nodes are located in a grid configuration with 100 m 
distance.  The location of these nodes are fixed through a 
simulation.  In addition, ten consumer side nodes are deployed

randomly with the center of (200, 100).  These nodes move 
around according to a random walk model.  All nodes 
communicate with each other through ad hoc mode IEEE 
802.11a protocol.   
The details of simulation condition are given in Table I.  
As for the radio propagation, we used a setting used 
commonly in the ns-3 simulator.  The data rate in IEEE 
802.11a is 24 Mbps constant.  The consumer side nodes move 
around according to the 2 dimensional random walk model 
with the constant mobility speed, where nodes change their 
direction at every 2 second.  We adopted the mobility speed 
of 40 m/s, 20 m/s, and 10 m/s.  Those values are large as a 
moving speed of human, but they are adopted for changing the 
wireless connection during a 15 second simulation run.  
Among the producer side nodes, the node located at the 
position (0, 0) works as a producer.  As for the consumer side, 
two, four, six, or eight nodes work as consumers requesting 
different content or the same content.  If each consumer 
requests different content, the Data packet caching is not 
effective in the simulation.  If the same content is used for all 
consumers, the caching will be used effectively.   
B. Evaluated methods and their implementation details 
The methods evaluated in this paper are the proposed 
method, REMIF (simplified version), and NDN over UDP/IP 
ad hoc network with OLSR routing (OLSR based NDN).  
OLSR based NDN is used in order to estimate the 
performance of TOP-CCN, because the exchange of Hello and 
TC (Topology Control) messages corresponds to that of CA 
packets in TOP-CCN.  On the other hand, OLSR based NDN 
uses the IP based routing in intermediate nodes as shown in 
our previous paper [19], and even if all consumers request the 
same content, the Data packet caching is not effective.  So, 
when the same content is used, OLSR based NDN can be used 
to estimate an IP based ad hoc network.   
The following describe the details of the implementation 
of three evaluated methods.   
(1) REMIF 
FIB is not specified, and Interest packets are always 
transferred with the destination address set to broadcast MAC 
address (“ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff”).  On the other hand, PIT is used for 
returning Data packets to consumers.  When a new Interest 
packet is received, the incoming face and the source MAC 
address of the Interest packet is stored in a new PIT entry.  
Since it is possible that the identical Interest packet is received 
via a different path, the duplication is detected by the Interest 
nonce stored in this PIT entry.  A retransmitted Interest packet 
from a consumer contains the same nonce as the original 
Interest packet.  In order to handle retransmitted Interest 
packets properly, a PIT entry for which a Data packet is not 
returned needs to be discarded when its lifetime expires.  The 
lifetime of a PIT entry is set to the lifetime of Interest packet, 
500 msec in this evaluation.   
Since REMIF uses the broadcast in transmitting Interest 
packets, we observed a mis-ordering problem.  The details are 
described in our previous papers [9][19].  In order to avoid this 
problem, we took the following way.  In the PIT handling in 
the ForwardingStrategy class, when a Data packet is received, 
the records for incoming faces and outgoing faces are cleared, 
and then the PIT entry is erased by setting the PIT entry 
pruning timer.  In the default, this value is set to 0 and the PIT 
entry is removed instantly.  In this evaluation, we set this timer 
value to 50 msec.  This means that our implementation ignores 
duplicate Interest packets received during 50 msec from the 
Data packet handling.   
(2) Proposed method 
In the performance evaluation here, we focus on the 
protocol behavior and the routing overhead when consumer 
side nodes move around.  So, as for the routing protocols for 
producer side nodes, we set the FIB by hand before simulation 
runs start.   
We implemented the FIB handling behavior in consumer 
side nodes by extending the REMIF program described above.  
At first, when a consumer side node receives an Interest 
packet, it looks for an FIB entry matching the name prefix 
included in the Interest packet.  If there are no entries, it 
creates a new entry for the name prefix with the default face 
and the broadcast MAC address.  A consumer side node 
transmits s the received Interest packet according to the 
corresponding FIB entry.   
When a consumer side node receives a Data packet, it 
registers the face from which the packet is received and the 
source MAC address of the data frame containing the Data 
packet in the corresponding FIB entry, if the MAC address in 
the entry is the broadcast MAC address.   
When the network configuration of consumer side nodes 
changes, the FIB needs to be reconstructed.  We implemented 
this mechanism in the following way.

 In order to detect the route change in consumer side 
nodes, we use the PIT entry pruning timer described 
above.  When this timer is expired, the incoming and 
outgoing faces in the PIT entry examined.  If they 
remain in the entry, we can decide that the Data packet 
corresponding to an Interest packet is not returned.  
These checks are executed in the PIT related class (the 
PitImpl class, specifically).   
 If this timeout occurs consecutively (three times in our 
implementation), we decide that the route change 
occurs.  Then, the outgoing face in the PIT entry is 
checked and, if the outgoing face has a unicast MAC 
address, the routine for clearing FIB entry in the 
ForwardingStrategy class is called.   
 In the clearing FIB entry routine, the MAC address is 
set to the broadcast MAC address.   
(3) OLSR based NDN 
The OLSR based NDN method is implemented the 
approach using the TCP/IP protocol stack under NDN.  We 
can use the OlsrHelper class supported in the ns-3 simulator 
and the IpFaceHelper supported in the ndnSIM simulator.  It 
should be noted that the calling of “Bing()” in the 
“CreateOrGetUdpFace()” method in the IpFaceStack class 
needs to be commented out, in ndnSIM version 1.0.   
C. Evaluation results 
(1) Overview 
We conducted three kinds of performance evaluation.  The 
first is that using two consumers by changing the mobility 
speed.  The second is that changing the number of consumers 
from two to eight with 20 m/s mobility speed.  In these 
evaluations, individual consumers retrieve their own content, 
that is, no cache mechanisms are used. The third one is that 
where all consumers request the same content.  In this case, 
cache mechanism is effective for REMIF and the proposed 
method.  The conditions of the third evaluation is similar with 
that of the second evaluation.   
In the evaluation for REMIF and the proposed method, we 
evaluated the following features, by changing the mobility 
speed of consumer side nodes or the number of consumers:  
 the total number of Interest packets originated from 
consumers,  
 the total number of Interest packets actually sent from 
consumers (including retransmissions), 
 the total number of Data packets consumers received, 
 the total number of forwarded Interest packets by all 
nodes, and  
 the total number of forwarded Data packets by all 
nodes.   
In the evaluation for OLSR based NDN, we evaluated the 
following features: 
 the total number of Interest packets originated from 
consumers,  
 the total number of Interest packets actually sent from 
consumers (including retransmissions), 
 the total number of Data packets consumers received, 
and  
 the total number of Hello and TC messages used in 
OLSR.   
As for the sending interval of Hello and TC messages, we 
selected 0.5 sec and 1 sec, respectively.  In order to establish 
routing information in the evaluation of OLSR based NDN, 
we introduce 5 second period before starting the content 
retrieval.  In other word, simulation runs for OLSR based 
NDN take 20 seconds, consisting of 5 seconds for routing 
information setting, 10 seconds for Interest packet origination, 
and 5 seconds for timeout retransmission.   
(2) Results of evaluation by changing mobility speed 
Figures 3 through 5 show the results of the first 
performance evaluation.  In the following figures, we 
normalize the number of packets by the total number of 
Interest packets originated from consumers.  By adopting this 
normalization, the number of Data packet received by 
consumers shows the data delivery ratio.   
Figure 3 shows the total numbers of Interest and Data 
packets that consumers sent and received actually.  The 
number of Interest packets is one through four times of that of 
the original Interest packets.  The three methods have a similar 
tendency.  Similarly, the number of Data packets that 
consumers received, i.e., the data delivery ratio, is 1 except the 
case of OLSR based NDN with 40 m/s speed, in which case 
the value is 0.99.  With the 5 second retransition period, 
almost all Interest packets are satisfied by the corresponding 
Data packets.   
Figure 4 shows the numbers of Interest and Data packets 
forwarded by all nodes in the network.  Except the Interest 
packets in REMIF, the numbers are several times of the 
original Interest packets.  The number of forwarded Interest 
packets in REMIF is more than twenty times of that of the 
original Interest packets.   
Figure 5 shows the overhead of OLSR, i.e., the numbers 
of Hello and TC messages during the Interest origination and 
retransmission period.  From this result, it can be said that the 
overhead of OLSR routing messages is not very large.   
Those results with two consumers show that although the 
number of forwarded Interest packets in REMIF is large, the 
data delivery rate is high for three methods, and that the 
mobility speed examined here does not affect the performance 
so much.   
(3) Results of evaluation by changing number of consumers 
Figures 6 and 7 show the results of the second 
performance evaluation.  Here, we changed the number of 
consumers, which request their own content, from two to eight.  
The mobility speed is set to 20 m/s.  It should be noted that 
the vertical axis is logarithmic in those graphs.   
Figure 6 shows the total numbers of Interest and Data 
packets that consumers sent and received actually.  The 
proposed method and OLSR based NDN have a similar 
tendency, but the data delivery ratio is high for the proposed 
method.  When there are eight consumers, the ratio of the 
proposed method is 0.85 and that of OLSR based NDN is 0.52.  
On the other hand, the performance of REMIF is worse than 
the others.  In the case of eight consumers, the number of 
Interest packets actually sent by consumers goes to as high as 
49

32.7 times that of original Interest packets, and the data 
delivery ratio goes down to 0.27.   
Figure 7, giving the total numbers of Interest and Data 
packets forwarded through the network, shows similar results.  
In the case of eight consumers, the total number of forwarded 
Interest packet is 242 times of the number of original Interest 
packets.  The proposed method and OLSR based NDN also 
give similar tendency in this figure.   
From the results with changing the number of consumers, 
it can be said that the performance of REMIF is worse than 
the others according to the increase of consumers requesting 
different content.  It should be noted that the REMIF used in 
this paper is a simplified version, which does not include the 
Interest suppression with deferring the Interest packet 
flooding randomly.  But, we believe that the Interest flooding 
without FIB may be a problem when the number of consumers 
is large.   
(4) Results of evaluation with Data packet caching 
Figures 8 and 9 show the results of the third performance 
evaluation.  Here, all consumers request the identical content, 
and therefore the Data packet cache is expected to work 
effectively.  The cache size of each node is 1,000 packets and 
the other conditions are the same as in the second evaluation.  
As described in Section 4, the caching does not work in OLSR 
based NDN, and so, it indicates the performance of IP based 
ad hoc network in this evaluation.   
Figure 8 shows the total numbers of Interest and Data 
packets that consumers sent and received actually.  In this 
figure, the results of the proposed method and REMIF 
changed largely compared with Figure 6.  The number of 
actually sent Interest packets is up to around twice of the 
original Interest packets.  That of REMIF becomes less than 
10 % of Figure 6 in the case of eight consumers.  The data 
delivery ratio of the proposed method and REMIF is 1 through 
this evaluation.  On the other hand, the result of OLSR based 
NDN is similar with that shown in Figure 6.  In the case of 
eight consumers, the data delivery ratio is 0.59.

Figure 9 shows the total numbers of Interest and Data 
packets forwarded through the network.  In this figure, the 
result of REMIF changed largely from that in Figure 7, 
although the number of forwarded Interest packets is still 
largest among the three method.  In the case of eight 
consumers, the number was 242 times of that of original 
Interest packets, but it decreases to 12 times when the caching 
works well.   
From those results, it can be said that the Data packet 
caching can reduce the traffic largely and that the performance 
can be increased compared with IP based ad hoc network.   
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper showed three kinds of performance evaluation 
with mobile nodes which move around according to the 
random walk model.  The results of the performance 
evaluation show the followings.  
When the number of consumers is small, the proposed 
method, a simplified reactive routing (simplified REMIF), and 
a proactive routing (OLSR based NDN) have a similar data 
delivery ratio, although the number of flooded Interest packets 
is large in simplified REMIF.  The mobility speed of 
consumer side nodes did not affect the delivery ratio so much.  
Secondly, when the number of consumers requesting different 
content increases, the performance, i.e., the data delivery ratio 
and the routing overhead, of REMIF becomes worse.  The 
data delivery ratio of the proposed method is better than that 
of OLSR based NDN supposing TOP-CCN.  Thirdly, when 
the Data packet caching works effectively, the performance of 
the proposed method and REMIF is improved largely.  The 
OLSR based NDN, which does not use the caching and 
therefore emulates IP based ad hoc network, has poor data 
delivery ratio than NDN based method.  So, it can be said that 
the data caching is effective.
