Abstract—Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlying 
cellular networks enhance the network capacity and spectrum 
efficiency, but make interference situation more complicated. 
In this paper, we concentrate on managing the interference 
between D2D communications and cellular networks at cell 
edge when sharing channel resources. First of all, a scheme 
based on interference-suppression-area (ISA), which contains 
downlink part and uplink part, is proposed to classify the 
strength of interference between D2D user equipments (UEs) 
and cellular user equipments (CUEs). Secondly, power control 
and resource allocation are processed to reduce mutual 
interference inside ISA. Finally, the range of ISA is discussed, 
which influences the system performance heavily. The 
simulation results show that this interference management 
scheme significantly improves system performance, and the 
optimal system performance can be obtained by adjusting the 
range of ISA.

 INTRODUCTION 
The development of mobile communications puts 
forward higher requirements on transmission rate, spectrum 
efficiency and network capacity. While radio frequency 
resources are quite limited, it has become a research hotspot 
to find efficient ways to fully utilize the channel resources. 
Because of the remarkable spectrum efficiency, D2D 
communications are considered as a promising solution to 
solve these problems. 
Under the control of base station (BS), D2D 
communications underlying cellular networks can obtain the 
required frequency resources and transmit power, share 
resources with CUEs and improve spectrum efficiency. In 
addition, D2D communications reduce the burden of cellular 
networks, increase the system throughput, reduce the power 
consumption of the mobile terminal and increase the bit rate, 
etc. [1][2]. 
However, 
resources 
sharing 
between 
D2D 
communications and cellular networks will cause additional 
interferences [3]. It is likely to assign orthogonal or 
nonorthogonal channel resources to D2D links and cellular 
links. 
Orthogonal 
resources 
are 
safe 
but 
wasted. 
Nonorthogonal resources cause interferes but improve 
spectrum efficiency. Due to limited frequency resources, the 
nonorthogonal channel resources are more practical to be 
considered. 
In nonorthogonal resources sharing mode, BS can adopt 
various resource allocation strategies with different gains and 
complexities. Random resources allocation is a simple way 
and the interferences between D2D communications and 
cellular networks are also random. Another simple way is 
that BS allocates the resources used by the CUEs which are 
far away from the D2D pairs. This method can make the 
interference between D2D communications and cellular 
networks as small as possible. 
At cell edge, the interference between BS and D2D UEs 
is weak, because of pathloss. Hence, there are two main 
interferences existing in the system. In downlink, the 
interference from the D2D transmitting user equipment 
(TUE) to the CUEs around it, and in uplink, the interference 
from surrounding CUEs to the D2D receiving user 
equipment (RUE). 
Some efforts have been taken to overcome the 
interferences when D2D communication underlying cellular 
networks [4-8]. In [4], the problem of interference 
management for D2D communications where multiple D2D 
users coexist with one cellular user was discussed. To 
optimize the transmit power levels of D2D users to 
maximize the cell throughput while preserving the SINR 
performance for the cellular user, the authors investigated the 
availability of the instantaneous or average channel state 
information (CSI) at the base station and studied the trade-
off between the signaling overhead and the overall system 
performance. In [5], an interference avoiding scheme for 
D2D communications was proposed when frequency is 
persistently allocated, which did not allocate subchannels 
that nearby cellular users currently use via overhearing signal 
power of uplink cellular users and calculating the 
interference in the frequency domain. It is noticed that some 
researches utilized the interference limited area to manage 
the interference. In [6], the mutual interferences between 
D2D communications and cellular networks were restricted 
under the constraints by adopting the interference limited 
area control method in downlink. Simulation results showed 
that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the total 
capacity of cellular and D2D communication, in addition to 
suppressing the mutual interferences. In [7], the authors

proposed a δD-interference limited area control scheme to 
manage the interference from cellular networks to D2D 
communication while exploiting the same uplink resources. 
The results indicated that the system capacity can be 
improved only at a small cost of cellular communication 
performance. In [8], D2D communication underlying a 3GPP 
LTE-Advanced cellular network was considered and an 
interference limited local area scenario was used in system 
simulation. The results showed that D2D communication in 
this scenario increased the total throughput. However, these 
works didn’t clarify the relationship between system 
performance and the range of the area. Actually, the area 
range has a great influence on system performance. 
In this paper, an interference management scheme based 
on ISA is proposed to manage the interference between D2D 
communications and cellular networks. Firstly, the whole 
area can be divided into two parts by interference strength. 
The area with strong interference in downlink and uplink is 
defined as ISA. Then power control and resources allocation 
are applied to decrease the strong interference. Furthermore, 
the range of ISA is discussed. It is analyzed that the optimal 
system performance can be obtained by adjusting the range 
of ISA. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follow. In Section II, 
the D2D communications underlying cellular networks is 
described and the interference problem is formulated. In 
Section III, the interference management scheme based on 
ISA is discussed in details. The simulation results are 
presented and analyzed in Section IV. The main conclusions 
are drawn in Section V.

SYSTEM MODEL 
A. System Model 
The system model considered in this paper is a cellular 
network with D2D communication underlying it and sharing 
resources with cellular links as depicted in Fig.1. There are 
M CUEs uniformly distributed in the cell and one D2D pair 
located at the cell edge. In downlink, BS transmits signals to 
CUEs, and in uplink, CUEs transmit signals to BS. The TUE 
transmits signals to the RUE and the maximum distance 
between them is D. 
 
Figure 1.  System model of D2D communication underlying cellular 
systems. 
BS allocates channel resources and controls transmit 
power to cellular links and the D2D link. It is assumed that 
channels are orthogonal, and the interference only exists in 
intra-channel due to the channel sharing of the D2D 
communication and the cellular communications. Given that 
all channel resources, both uplink and downlink channel 
resources, have already equally allocated to CUEs and the 
number of channel resources equals the number of CUEs M, 
i.e., M uplink channel resources and M downlink channel 
resources. The D2D pair is allowed to share multiple 
resources, both downlink and uplink channel resources, with 
CUEs. 
The channel considered in this paper is modeled as 
Rayleigh fading channel, and thus the channel response 
follows the independent complex Gaussian distribution. 
Besides, the distance-dependent path loss model is used to 
measure the signal power transmission loss. The channel 
gains contain the pathloss and the normalized small-scale 
fading, 
and 
we 
use 
GBS,UEk(RUEk), 
GUEk,BS(RUE), 
and 
GTUEk,RUE(BS,UEk) to respectively represent the channel gains 
from BS to the k-th CUE (or the RUE) on the k-th channel 
resource, the channel gains from the k-th CUE to BS (or the 
RUE), and the channel gains from the TUE to the RUE (or 
BS, the k-th CUE) on the k-th channel resource.

B. Problem Formulation 
In downlink, BS transmits signals to CUEs and the TUE 
transmits signals to the RUE. Accordingly, CUEs suffer 
from interferences caused by the TUE and the RUE is 
disturbed by BS. 
We denote the situation of sharing resources between the 
D2D pair and cellular links in downlink by array rd(M), 
where rd(k) = 1 implies that the D2D pair shares the same 
resources with the k-th cellular link, and rd(k) = 0 implies 
that they don’t share the same resource. 
The SINR of the k-th CUE can be represented as:

where PTUE,RUEk and PBS,RUEk are respectively the transmit 
power of the TUE and BS to the RUE in the k-th channel 
resource. 
In uplink, CUEs transmit signals to BS and the TUE still 
transmits signals to the RUE. Accordingly, the RUE suffers 
from interferences caused by CUEs and BS is disturbed by 
the TUE.  
We denote the situation of sharing resources between the 
D2D pair and cellular links in uplink by array ru(M), where 
ru(k) = 1 implies that the D2D pair shares the same resources 
with the k-th cellular link, and ru(k) = 0 implies that they 
don’t share the same resource.

where CDL and CUL are the capacity in downlink and in

Thus, the optimization objective can be transformed as 
finding array rd(M) and ru(M) to maximize the system 
capacity. 
III. 
INTERFERENCE MANAGEMENT SCHEME 
In this section, the proposed interference management 
scheme based on ISA is introduced in details. 
A. Power Control 
In this system model, CUEs and the D2D pair coexist in 
the system and share whole channel resources. To guarantee 
the D2D communication, the transmit power of the TUE 
PTUE should be promoted as much as possible. On the other 
hand, large PTUE will cause severe interference to cellular 
communications which have higher priority. Hence, the PTUE 
should be controlled at a proper level. 
In this scheme, we set the PTUE in downlink. On one hand, 
the interference from BS to the D2D communication in 
downlink can be offset effectively by power control. On the 
other hand, the interference from CUEs to the D2D pair in 
uplink is related to the distribution of CUEs, which has a 
great randomness and is not easy to be controlled. 
To decide the PTUE, BS sets up a SINR threshold η and 
the maximum transmit power of the TUE PTUEMAX. To ensure 
the quality of the D2D communication, PTUE should meet η 
as far as possible on the premise of not exceeding PTUEMAX. 
The SINR of the RUE in the k-th channel resource 
should satisfy:

B. ISA Setting 
D2D communications have characteristics of short 
propagation distance and low transmit power. Thus the 
interference created by the D2D communication is quite 
limited. If resource scheduling was processed in the area 
with severe interference, which allocates the orthogonal 
resources to the D2D pair and the disturbed CUEs, the 
interference from the D2D communication to cellular 
networks would be reduced. 
Therefore, we define an ISA for the D2D pair to indicate 
the area with severe interference. The CUEs and the D2D 
pair in same ISA will cause severe interference to each other, 
and require orthogonal resources. 
In downlink, the receiving interference power of the k-th 
CUE is:

where dTUE,UEk is the distance between the TUE and the k-th 
CUE, and a is the pothloss exponent. RDL is the range of the 
ISA in downlink (ISADL). Given a power threshold, indicated 
as PDL, of the receiving signal from the D2D pair to CUEs. 
When the receiving power equals PDL, the RDL can be 
calculated as:

where PUL is the predetermined power threshold of the 
receiving signal from a CUE to the RUE. 
The range of ISA affects the number of channel resources 
can be used by the D2D communication, i.e., rd(M) and 
ru(M). According to the formula (11) and formula (12), the 
range of ISADL is related to PDL and PTUE, and the range of 
ISAUL is related to PUL and PUEk. Therefore, BS can control 
the range of ISA by determining these parameters. 
C. Resources Allocation 
When the interference between CUEs and the D2D pair 
is inevitable, the resources allocated to them should be 
orthogonal. 
In this scheme, BS provides forbidden channel resources 
of the D2D communication in downlink, and then the TUE 
further determines ultimate channel resources in uplink. 
In downlink, in order to minimize the interference caused 
by the D2D communication, the resources of the CUEs 
outside the ISADL should be allocated to the D2D pair. For 
this purpose, we set up an exclusive channel D2DCH for the 
D2D communication to make a CUE estimate whether it is 
in ISADL or not. In D2DCH, the TUE transmits an identifier 
to indicate that the D2D pair is communicating. All CUEs in 
community monitor this channel. When the receiving power 
is larger than PDL, it indicates this CUE will be affected by 
the D2D communication heavily, i.e., in ISADL. After 
receiving feedback information of the CUEs in ISADL, BS 
notifies the TUE the resources allocation information of 
these CUEs. These resources are forbidden resources for the 
D2D communication. 
Then, ISAUL is set to further determine the final used 
resources. The RUE monitors all channel resources. When 
the receiving power at certain channel resource is larger than 
PUL, it indicates the CUE transmitting on this resource will 
affect the D2D communication seriously, i.e., in the ISAUL. 
The RUE reports these resources information to the TUE. 
According to the feedback information from BS and the 
RUE, the TUE obtains information about all forbidden 
resources and determines the available resources. If there are 
no available resources, the D2D communication should wait. 
By this way, BS can control the range of ISA by setting 
related parameters, and through resource allocation, the 
interference between the D2D communication and cellular 
networks is reduced and system performance is improved. 
Moreover, it is necessary to discuss the influence on 
system performance caused by ISA range. With the ISA 
enlarges, the quantity of CUEs in ISA will increase and the 
cellular network performance will be improved because the 
interference caused by the D2D communication decreases. 
However, the D2D performance will decrease because the 
number of available resources reduces. Therefore, the system 
performance would not always be improved. There exist an 
appropriate range of ISA can make the system performance 
reach optimum. In this paper, we obtain the optimal ISA 
range by simulation. 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, the proposed scheme is simulated and the 
system performance is analyzed. The parameters are shown 
in Table I.

Firstly, we simulate the range of ISA with the change of 
corresponding power threshold. Due to the distribution of 
CUEs in ISA can reflect the range of ISA; we use the 
distribution of CUEs to illustrate the change of ISA. The 
D2D pair is located at the cell edge with coordinates (1000, 
0). The simulation time is 200. Separately, scatter plot in 
Fig.2 illustrates the distribution of CUEs in the ISADL, Fig.3 
is about the CUEs distribution in ISAUL, and Fig.4 shows the 
combine situation of downlink and uplink.

Figure 3.  Distribution of CUEs in ISAUL with the PUL. 
 
Figure 4.  Distribution of CUEs in ISA with the PDL and PUL. 
According to the above results, with the decrease of 
power threshold, ISA enlarges. In uplink, due to the higher 
signal power, the CUEs around BS are not easily affected by 
the D2D communication, so when the PUL is small, there is a 
blank circle around BS in ISAUL as shown in Fig.3. 
Fig.5 illustrates the system capacity changed with the PDL 
and PUL. 
 
Figure 5.  System capacity changed with the PDL and PUL. 
We can draw a few conclusions from this simulation 
result. First of all, as we expected, there exists an optimal 
value of system capacity shown as the dark red areas. The 
optimal value is appeared when PDL is around -130dBm and 
PUL is around -115dBm. Secondly, when PDL and PUL set too 
large, the system capacity becomes small. This is because 
when the power threshold is too large, fewer CUEs will enter 
the ISA, the interference between the D2D communication 
and cellular networks can’t be controlled efficiently. Finally, 
when the PDL (or PUL) is fixed, the system capacity with the 
increase of PUL (or PDL) will first increases then decreases, 
there is an optimal value. 
In order to assess the system performance of the 
proposed scheme, we compare the scheme with the random 
scheduling scheme which allocates the whole resources to 
the D2D communication as shown in Fig.6 and Fig.7. From 
above results, the maximum system capacity appears when 
PDL is around -130dBm and PUL is around -115dBm, 
therefore, we separately fix one of them and investigate the 
system capacity changed with another one. 
 
Figure 6.  System capacity changed with the PDL. 
 
Figure 7.  System capacity changed with the PUL. 
Fig.6 is the system capacity changed with PDL when PUL 
equals -115dBm and Fig.7 is the system capacity changed 
with PUL when PDL equals -130dBm. In these two graphs, the 
red curves represent the system capacity of the proposed 
scheme and the blue ones represent the system performance 
of the random scheduling scheme. It is obvious that the 
proposed scheme is superior to the compared scheme. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an interference management scheme based 
on ISA is proposed to manage the interference between the 
D2D communication at cell edge and cellular networks. BS 
controls the range of ISA by setting related parameters. On 
the premise of guaranteeing the D2D communication, BS 
controls the transmit power and helps determining the 
channel resources of the D2D communication. The 
simulation results show that this scheme can significantly 
promote the system capacity. Moreover, the range of ISA has 
great influence on the system performance, and the optimal 
system performance can be obtained by adjusting the range 
of ISA.
