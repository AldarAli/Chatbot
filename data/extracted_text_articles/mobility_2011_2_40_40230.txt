Abstract—The development of mobile devices and wireless 
communications networks is an opportunity for the companies 
that want to achieve their customers anywhere and anytime. 
This work in progress explores the factors that influencing the 
adoption of m-commerce and proposes a methodology to 
aggregate the total influence of the incentives on the intention 
of use.  The knowledge of these effects should improve the sale 
promotions policy, based on incentives, and can influence the 
adoption of m-commerce. The regression analysis confirms the 
relationship between the studied variables. 
Keywords–Incentives; m-commerce; Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM); theory of the forgotten effects. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The wireless communication networks are spreading 
worldwide at a rate ever recorded to date by any other 
communication technology [1]. It has become an everyday 
technology that is changing the relationships at work, family, 
personal relationships and use of leisure time available 
anywhere and anytime. 
To date, the m-commerce had been to buy ringtones, 
screensavers, games, videos, etc. This is a stagnant market in 
which there is to think about developing new kinds of 
content that appeal to the majority, which is a challenge for 
marketing departments of content providers as stated [2]. 
The development of mobile technology and the growth of 
access to navigation via mobile devices open up new 
possibilities for m-commerce. New kinds of e-commerce 
transactions, conducted through mobile devices using 
wireless networks and other wired e-commerce technologies. 
Is possible group the m-commerce [3] in transactions 
services (e.g., mobile shopping, ticket purchasing, stock 
trading), information services (e.g., news, location/traffic 
information) and entertainment services (e.g., download 
rings tone, download movies). 
The literature on the adoption of the m-commerce is 
centered in the study of the intrinsic factors that influencing 
the intention of use of the m-commerce, but the companies 
need external factors that they can manipulate to influence 
the users. This research introduces the incentives, as external 
factor, and evaluates the total effect, direct and indirect, on 
the intention of use of the m-commerce. We consider that the 
knowledge of the real impact of the incentives improves the 
policy of promotions with the objective to influence the m-
commerce adoption. 
This work is structured in five sections: the first section 
presents a review on adoption of m-commerce; the second 
section presents the research model and explains the used 
factors; the third section is detailing the data collection and 
the measurement of variables and proposes the analysis 
methodology; the fourth section shows our preliminary 
results of the research, and finally, expose the main 
contributions for the business and scientific community, and 
comment future research.  
II. 
ADOPTION OF M-COMMERCE 
Many authors have defined the concept of m-commerce 
as the extension of electronic commerce that use wireless 
devices and telecommunications networks to accede 
anywhere and anytime to the exchange goods, services and 
information.  
A review of the concept of m-commerce can be obtained 
from [4]. A base for studying the determinants of the 
intention of use is the Theory of Reason Action (TRA) [5] 
Behavior and attitude toward are subjective norm related to 
behavioral intention. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [6] 
adding the perceived behavior determinant of the behavioral 
intention. Numerous studies take the Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) [7], based on TRA, to study the determinants 
of technology adoption. Many authors have used the TAM 
model in the study of acceptance of different technological 
innovations: Internet and mobile Internet, software, laptops, 
etc. For the purpose of this work should highlight the work in 
the fields of m-commerce [8][9][10]. Although there are 
various studies on the potential of wireless technology and 
mobile services it is necessary to explore new factors that 
affect the use intention of m-commerce. 
III. 
THE RESEARCH MODEL 
A. Objective 
The purpose of this work is to understand the influence 
of the factors that affect the use intention of m-commerce 
adding the incentives to the TAM. The incentives are 
external factors that can be manipulated by the enterprises. 
So the main objective of this research was to determine the 
overall effect of incentives on the use intention of m-
commerce, direct and indirect effect through other factors.

B. Proposed research model 
 
The context and the incentives have significant impact on 
users' behavior. We introduce in the model the incentives (I) 
as antecedent of the intention of use of the m-commerce 
(BIm). 
H1: The incentives have a direct positive effect on 
intention of use of the m-commerce. 
The incentive strategies influence the attitude toward the 
technology and the perceived usefulness (PU) in the self 
check-in service. Therefore we introduce in the model the 
incentives as antecedent of the attitude and PU. 
H2: The incentives have a direct positive effect on 
attitude toward m-commerce. 
H3: The incentives have a direct positive effect on 
perceived usefulness. 
Considering the uses and gratifications theory a person 
who receives incentives will be most happy. Greater 
happiness can influence the perception. Based on the uses 
and gratifications theory, several studies [7] show the 
influence of intrinsic motivation in the decision to use 
mobile services. We introduce in the model the incentives as 
antecedent of the perceived enjoyment (PE). 
H4: The incentives have a direct positive effect on 
perceived enjoyment. 
Perceived ease of use (PEOU) as "the degree to believe 
that which a person using a particular system is free of 
effort" and observed a positive interaction of PEOU with the 
PU [7]. PEOU has been considered as an important 
determinant in adoption of past information technologies 
such as intranet [11], 3G [12], online banking [13][14] 
wireless internet [15], Internet commerce [16] and m-
commerce [17][18][19][20][21]. We introduce in the model 
the PEOU as antecedent of the PU. 
H5: The perceived ease of use has a direct positive effect 
on perceived usefulness.  
An application of the m-commerce easier to use will also 
more funny to use [22][23][24][25][26]. We introduce in the 
model the PEOU as antecedent of the PE. 
H6: The perceived ease of use has a direct positive effect 
on perceived enjoyment. 
 
Figure 1.  Reseach model. 
PU as "the degree to believe that which a person using a 
particular system would enhance his or her job performance” 
and observed a positive interaction of PE with the PU [7]. 
Similarly, [27][28] and [29] working this hypothesis. We 
introduce in the model the PE as antecedent of the PU. 
H7: The perceived enjoyment has a direct positive effect 
on perceived usefulness. 
PU and the PE as antecedent of attitude applied to 
technology acceptance [7][24][25][30]. Similarly, the PE is 
present in the studies of [31][32]. We introduce in the model 
the PU and the PE as antecedents of the attitude. 
H8: The perceived usefulness has a direct positive effect 
on attitude toward m-commerce. 
H9: The perceived enjoyment has a direct positive effect 
on attitude toward m-commerce. 
TAM propose the attitude toward particular system as 
antecedent of the behavioral intention of use following the 
TRA and the TPB. Then we introduce in the model the 
attitude as antecedent of the intention of use of the m-
commerce (BIm). 
H10: The attitude toward m-commerce have a direct 
positive effect on intention of use of the m-commerce. 
The social influence is present in the TRA [5] and the 
TPB [6] as antecedent of behavioral intention through the 
subjective norms. We introduce in the model the social 
influence (SI) as antecedent of the PE and the attitude toward 
the m-commerce (Attm). 
H11: Social influence has a direct positive effect on 
perceived enjoyment. 
H12: Social influence has direct positive effect on 
attitude toward the m-commerce. 
IV. 
METHODOLOGY 
A. Data collection 
We made a survey with students because they are more 
susceptible to use this kind of services. A total 367 
questionnaires have been validated. The sample is formed of 
60.3% of women and 39.7% of men, with ages between 19 
and 37 years. As for the experience in online purchase, 
95.6% have occasionally bought on the Internet and 14.7% 
have bought some product through the mobile devices. 
B. Measurement of variables 
A literature review facilitates the scales for measure the 
constructs. According to [33][34] a factor analysis allows 
checking the validity of measurement scales. All items 
should be higher of 0.6. A Cronbach's alpha analysis was 
done in order to analyze the reliability of the used scales and 
to test internal consistency of the scales. All factors exceed 
0.7, as recommended [35]. 
Likert scales (ranging from 1 to 7), with anchors ranging 
from „„strongly disagree‟‟ to „„strongly agree‟‟ were used for 
all questions.

We use the software SPSS 17 to make the factor analysis 
and the reliability test. We confirm, in a preliminary analysis 
the validity and the reliability of all scales considered 
keeping in mind the adjustment measures previously 
discussed.   
C. Factors influences 
To calculate the influence of each factor on the proposed 
constructs (perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, 
attitudes toward the m-commerce and intention of use of the 
m-commerce) has made four multiple regression analysis. 
The table II shows the preliminary results. 
D. Incidences of first order and higher 
The incidence between two variables is the cause-effect 
relationship of one variable on another. The simplest case is 
the incidence of first order (e.g., A affects B) where A is the 
cause of B. Second order is considered where the impact is 
not direct (e.g., A affects B through C). 
In the the model there are incidences of first order: I  A 
Incentives (I) affect the 
attitude 
(Attm). 
But there 
are 
also incidences of 
second order: 
I 
 
A 
 
BIm, 
Incentives (I) have an indirect effect on the intention of 
use of m-commerce (BIm) through attitude toward the m-
commerce (Attm). 
With the intention of determining the overall effect of 
incentives on the intended use of m-commerce use the theory 
of the forgotten effects. To calculate the maxmin convolution 
of the impact of A on C from the impact of A on B and the 
incidence of B on C using the formula [36]: 
 
µ (ai, ck) = V (μ (ai,bj)  ⋀ μ (bj,ck))                 (1) 
 
For all ai, bj y ck  
i = 1, 2, 3,… 
j = 1, 2, 3,… 
k = 1, 2, 3,… 
 
Maxmin convolution can be represented with the symbol 
(ο) so that the process can be summarized as follows: 
mac = mab ₀ mbc                             (2) 
 
In the case of an incidence of order 3: 
mad = mab ₀ mbc₀ mcd                      (3) 
 
Given that the maxmin convolution satisfies the 
associative property: 
mab₀ (mbc ₀ mcd) = (mab₀ mbc) ₀ mcd         (4) 
 
In the case of incentives (I) there are incidences of first 
(I  BIm), second (I  A  BIm), third (I  PU   A  
BIm) and fourth order (I  PE  PU  A  BIm) 
on the intention 
of 
use of m-commerce 
(BIm). 
As develop the following: 
mI BIm = mI PE ₀ mPE PU ₀ mPU A ₀ mA BIm          (5)

a 
confirmatory analysis with the 367 questionnaires of the 
sample. 
Confirmed the hypothesis we calculate the impact of 
incentives on the set of constructs studied in the model with 
the proposed methodology based on the theory of forgotten 
effects. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The development of the methodology proposed will 
allow study the aggregate effect of one factor on another, 
keeping in mind direct and indirect effects. It is important to 
aggregate the effects to know the importance of the factors in 
the acceptance of m-commerce process. Besides the 
incentives is a controllable factor for the company, so it can 
be used as a tool to improve the acceptance of m-commerce. 
The combination of the regression analysis and forgotten 
effects provide a solution to aggregate all influences, direct 
and indirect, that exists between two variables. Other kind of 
analysis such as structural equation models obtain result 
from a group of factors on others but does not offer solution 
to find the total effect of one variable on another. 
If the responsible of decision-making knows the total 
effects of the incentives on the intention of use of m-
commerce then can influence to the users. The findings of 
this research can incorporate in the sales promotion policy to 
accelerate the acceptance of this new channel and 
augmenting sales.
