Abstract—Power line communication is a candidate for
communication technology in electric vehicles and home area
networks of smart grid. This paper derives the error rate
performance of a QPSK-transmitted power line communication
system. The Nakagami-m distribution is used as the closed-form
background noise model, which was presented by a previous
work. We have evaluated the symbol error rate of QPSK
systems with both analytical values and computer simulations,
and veriﬁed its validity through computer simulations.
Keywords-Power Line Communication; Background Noise;
Symbol Error Rate; Nakagami-m distribution.
I. INTRODUCTION
Power Line Communication (PLC) has evolved so sig-
niﬁcantly that it can support various services, ranging from
low-speed command and control to high-speed multimedia
transmission. There has been commercial deployment of
PLC technology, e.g., for Automatic Meter Reading (AMR),
in recent years [1]. The performance of AMR using PLC has
been analyzed by various researchers (e.g., [2], [3]). PLC
is also of great interest due to its possibility as a commu-
nication technology for smart grids. The requirements for
PLC are presented as an energy management and facility
automation systems in smart grids [4]. Furthermore, the
possibility of vehicle communications using PLC has been
studied. The channel characteristics of an in-vehicle power
line were measured and analyzed for PLC [5].
Despite the versatility of PLC, its channel is time-variant
and corrupted by unpredictable impulsive noises. Thus ex-
tensive research activities on effective channel modeling of
background noise, and impulsive noise have been conducted
[6], [7]. It was proposed that the amplitude of background
noise in power-line channel follows the Nakagami-m distri-
bution [8] [9]. In our previous work, a closed-form expres-
sion for the real part of background noise was derived [10].
Using this closed-form expression, we derived the Bit Error
Rate (BER) performance of (Binary Phase Shift Keying)
BPSK transmission over power line channels and veriﬁed
its validity by simulations [11].
This paper considers the Symbol Error Rate (SER) of a
quadrature-phase shift-keying (QPSK) system. The system
model for the QPSK system is presented in Section II. As an

jA , according to the symbol set, {s0, s1, s2, s3} then, the
complex decision metric at the receiver, r, is deﬁned as
r = ±A ± jA + y + jz,
(12)
where I and Q channel data, ±A ± jA, are corrupted by a
complex Nakagami background noise, y + jz. We assume
that four signals are equally probable; thus, the optimal
threshold for decision is x and y-axes. For example, if signal
s0 is transmitted and a noise-corrupted received signal falls
in the ﬁrst quadrant, then the decision is correctly made as
s0; otherwise, it fails.
When a symbol s0 is sent, the probability of symbol s0
is correctly decided, p(C|s0), and is represented by
p(C|s0) = p(y > 0|s0) p(z > 0|s0),
(13)
which means a noise-corrupted symbol must fall on the ﬁrst
quadrant. We get

where we can evaluate the integral part, P1, using the
result from [11] as Eq.(17). The simulated and the analyzed
evaluations of P1 are depicted in Fig. 3. The X-axis is a dB-
scaled Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value, which is deﬁned
as A2/Ω. For higher values of SNR, P 2
1 becomes very small;
then, Eq. (16) can be approximated as
Pe
≈ 2P1,
(17)
which means that the symbol error rate is approximately
twice the BER of BPSK. The result is that the SER of QPSK
is poorer than that of BPSK in symbol error sense.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
The SER performance of QPSK is simulated with the
Monte Carlo method. 106 symbols are randomly generated
at the transmitter. The generated symbols are corrupted
by complex Nakagami-like background noise; then, the
demodulated symbols are decided by a threshold comparison
as presented in Fig. 1.
Fig. 4 shows the analyzed and the simulated SER per-
formances for m = 0.6. The approximated analysis curves
obtained from Eq.(17). The simulation results match well
with those of the analysis. The accuracy of the approximated
analysis is credible for all SNR values. Fig. 5 shows the
analyzed and the simulated SER performances for m = 0.9.
We can observe that a similar accuracy exists between the
simulated and the analyzed performances.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper analyzed and simulated the SER performance
of the QPSK-transmitted signal under Nakagami-like back-
ground noise. We derived the imaginary portion of the
Nakagami-like background noise. The derived result shows
that the statistical behavior of the real and the imaginary
parts of noise are the same. Next, we derived the SER
performance of the QPSK-transmitted signal. For higher
values of SNR, the SER performance is approximated to
twice the error rate performance of a binary transmitted
signal. Simulation was done for randomly generated 106
symbols through the Monte Carlo method. The analyzed
SER performances agree well with the simulations using
various values of m. The BER performance of the QPSK-
transmitted signal would be the focus of the future work.
