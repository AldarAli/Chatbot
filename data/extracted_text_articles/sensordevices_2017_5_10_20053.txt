Abstract—The increasing use and associated environmental
release of consumed human and veterinary antibiotics have
drawn great attention recently. A high percentage of the
excreted antibiotics remains in an intact form and enters the
natural aquatic systems via the effluent and sludge from
wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, and livestock farms.
These released antibiotics may lead to bacterial resistance
proliferation, contamination or adverse impacts on non-target
organisms and microbial ecosystems. Therefore, this situation
has created a compelling need to develop sensitive on-site
detection techniques for monitoring these antibiotics in the
environment. However, delicate instrumentation and complex
sample pretreatment requirement of conventional analytical
techniques such as spectrophotometry, electrophoresis, and
chromatography have hindered their practical applications in
real time and in situ sensing task. On the other hand,
electrochemical techniques have served as sensitive methods
for on-site monitoring with low cost, high efficiency, and
minimum sample pretreatment necessity. In the present work,
an
electrochemical
sensor
for
rapid
determination
of
sulfamethoxazole, one of the most widely used antibiotics, has
been developed. Functionalized reduced graphene oxide was
used to modify the electrodes owing to its high charge mobility,
low background noise, and high surface area.
The response
was optimized in terms of pH, scan mode, and applied
potential.
Moreover, the modified electrodes showed great
selectivity and stability, and thus collectively, renders it a
promising sensor toward detecting sulfamethoxazole in the
aquatic system.

INTRODUCTION
Up to 95% of antibiotics could be excreted in an
unchanged state from animals and humans [1]. Throughout
the conventional biological wastewater treatment processes,
many 
antibiotics 
such 
as 
β-lactams, 
sulfonamides, 
trimethoprim,
macrolides,
fluoroquinolones,
and
tetracyclines have been reported to remain in the final
effluents and be released to the environment [2-4]. Also,
treated-wastewater irrigation in arid regions has caused
elevated levels of bacterial antibiotic resistance in both
aquatic system and treated-wastewater-irrigated soils [1].
These released antibiotic compounds in discharge or reused
wastewater have raised increasing concern, owing to their
adverse impact to the aquatic environment or proliferation
of resistant strains of bacteria [2]. Sulfonamides, one of the
most commonly used antibiotic groups, are used for the
treatment
of
urinary-tract
infections,
pneumocystis
pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, meningococcal meningitis,
acute otitis, toxoplasmosis, skin and soft tissue infections
[5].
Sulfamethoxazole
is
a
representative
sulfonamide
antibiotic and frequently found in surface water and
groundwater worldwide [6, 7]. Given the wide usage of
sulfamethoxazole, its real-time and in-situ detection is of
great
importance.
A variety of analytical
techniques,
including
chromatography,
spectrophotometry,
and
electrophoresis,
are
time-consuming,
expensive
and
pretreatment-needed. On the other hand, electrochemical
techniques, which have fast response, low cost, simplicity
for operation, are promising for sulfamethoxazole detection.
A few studies have used electrochemical approach for
determination
sulfamethoxazole
[5,
8-10].
Herein,
we
propose an electrochemical sensor for selective detection of
sulfamethoxazole
based
on
modified
electrodes
with
functionalized reduced graphene oxide (RGO), owing to its
high charge mobility, low background noise, and high
surface
area.
Methods
of
sample
preparation
and
characterization of the present work are introduced in
Section II. Then we demostrate electrochemical responses
of
the
developed
sensors
for
sulfamethoxazole
determination in Section III, and finally, we conclude in
Section IV.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals of the highest purity available from Sigma
Aldrich (Missouri, USA) [11] and Acros Organics (New
Jersey, USA) [12], unless stated otherwise, were used
without
further
purification.
Aqueous
solutions
were
prepared in water that purified to ≥ 18.2 MΩ·cm. The pH 
adjustment was achieved by adding HClO4 and NaOH
solutions.
Synthesized
graphene
oxide
and
reduced
graphene
oxide
were
characterized
by
UV-Vis
measurements (HITACHI U-3900 spectrophotometer). The
cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on

an electrochemical system (CH Instruments). Graphene
oxide (GO) was prepared from purified natural graphite by a
modified Hummers’ method. Functionalized RGO, N-RGO,
was prepared by reducing GO via a solvothermal reaction
with ammonia solution.
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Figure 1 (a)), the
absorption peaks at 230 and 300 nm are assigned to the π-π 
transition
of
aromatic
C=C
bonds
and
C=O
bonds,
respectively. After the reduction, the absorption peak was
red-shifted to 271 nm, indicating a successful GO reduction,
in which the conjugated C=C bonds were restored. The
electrochemical oxidation of sulfamethoxazole on the bare
and modified electrode surfaces was examined, as shown in
Figure 1 (b). The relative ordering of CV current has been
determined to be N-RGO > bare electrode > GO. In the
presence of sulfamethoxazole (50 μM), a relevant increase 
in the current was observed for N-RGO, as compared to
bare electrode and GO modified electrode (Figure 2),
implying an enhanced electrochemical response of the N-
RGO modified electrode. This indicates a promising sensing
feature of N-RGO toward sulfamethoxazole detection.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
In the present work, the characterization and evaluation
of
functionalized
RGO
modified
electrodes
for
determination of sulfamethoxazole were performed. The
fabricated electrode is promising as an on-site detection tool
for point-of-care monitoring of sulfamethoxazole with fast-
response, sensitive, and cost-effective characters.
