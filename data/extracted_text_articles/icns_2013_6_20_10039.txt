Abstract-In this paper, a WDM mesh network is planned
and designed by two methods so that to satisfy all its
demands and each connection has to be protected with the
dedicated way by both nodes. In the first method, each
connection uses the free available wavelength after the
maximum busy wavelength (higher index) of each optical
link from full complementary working and protection
lightpaths. In the second method, each connection uses the
first free (lowest index) available wavelength of each optical
link from full complementary working and protection
lightpaths.
Keywords -WDM networks; dedicated protection.
I. INTRODUCTION
Optical
networks
using
Wavelength
Division
Multiplex (WDM) make use of the enormous bandwidth
of an optical fiber. WDM divides the tremendous
bandwidth (~50THz) of a single mode optical fiber in to
many non overlapping wavelengths (or wavelength
channels with bandwidth 1-10 Gbps or more) which can
operate
simultaneously,
with
the
fundamental
requirement that each of these channels operate at
different wavelengths. WDM basically is frequency
division multiplexing in the optical range where the
carrier frequencies are referred as wavelengths. These
high capacity WDM optical mesh networks that based on
optical technologies, provide routing, grooming and
restoration at the wavelength level as well as wavelength
based services.
In this paper, all network parameters are known and
the WDM mesh network is planned and designed so that
to satisfy all its demands using the shortest path
algorithm and each connection has to be protected with
the dedicated way and based on the spare capacity which
is allocated as a “dedicated” resource for sole use of the
connection. The assignment of the suitable wavelengths
for each connection is done using a) the free available
wavelength after the maximum busy (higher index)
wavelength of each optical link from full complementary
working and protection lightpaths, b) the first free (lower
index) available wavelength of each optical link from
full complementary working and protection lightpaths
and c) the benefits of the second method versus the first
one also shown when wavelength conversion is not used
as well as the performance improvement when the
wavelength conversion is used. The demand tables are
large and they are not showed.

III. THE PROBLEM AND ITS
SOLUTION
A.
The problem
The network topology and other parameters are
known as WDM and optical fibre capacity, the number
of node pairs and the node pairs that the demands
(requests for connection) must be satisfied and the m:N
(1:7) WDM and optical fibre shared protection protocol.
So, this network is characterized as multifibre network
by working and protection fibres per link (multifibre
link) and edges of two opposite direction links. The
WDM mesh network is planned and designed so that to
satisfy all its demands using the shortest path algorithm
and each connection has to be protected with the
dedicated way and based on the spare capacity which is
allocated as a “dedicated” resource for sole use of the
connection. The assignment of the suitable wavelengths
for each connection is done using a) the free available
wavelength after the maximum busy (higher index)
wavelength of each optical link from full complementary
working and protection lightpaths, b) the first free (lower
index) available wavelength of each optical link from
full complementary working and protection lightpaths
and c) the benefits of the second method versus the first
one also showed when wavelength conversion is not
used as well as the performance improvement when the
wavelength conversion is used. The demand tables are
large and they are not showed.Table I with symbols is
showed below. The network has identical nodes. Each
node can be assumed to have two functionalities: first, a
lightpath or connection request generation/termination
capability and, second, a wavelength routing capability.
This essentially means that a node can either act as the
source/destination node of a lightpath or as wavelength
routing node. On the network nodes are installed the
Optical
Cross
Connects
(OXCs).
The
Wavelength
Division Multiplex- Optical Cross Connect (WDM -
OXC) has multiplex and demultiplex systems that
convert the aggregated optical signal to simple optical
signals and vice versa. A lightpath is an optical channel
from source to destination to provide a connection
between these nodes and using a same free wavelength
on all of the fiber links in the path.

This is called wavelength continuity constraint. An
optical channel passing through a cross-connect node
may be routed from an input fiber to an output fiber on
the same wavelength. It is assumed that no different
wavelengths are assigned on all links along the route if
nodes have not wavelength conversion capabilities. It
means that the initial wavelength which carries the
traffic
does
not
shift
to
other
wavelengths
by
intermediate nodes of the lightpath. The networks with
this capability are called “Networks without wavelength
118

conversion”.
If nodes
have
wavelength
conversion
different wavelengths can assign on all links along the
route for each lightpath. It means that the initial
wavelength which carries the traffic can shift to other
wavelengths by intermediate nodes of the lightpath. The
networks with this capability are called “Networks with
wavelength
conversion”.
For
this
example,
the
connection group size of each node pair is set to the
number two (2).
B. The formulation
To make the problem computationally feasible, the
problem is generally divided into subproblems, the
working lightpath assignment and the backup lightpath
assignment. But the lightpath assignment is different for
each method. At the first method, the free available
wavelength after the maximum busy (higher index) one
on all of the links is assigned and at the second one, the
first free (lower index) available wavelength on all of the
links is assigned (if wavelength conversion is not used
these wavelengths must keep along each lightpath but if
wavelength conversion is used it is not valid). So each
different assignment method produces different needs for
optical fibers. So the maximum (higher index) occupied
wavelength of the first method for each fiber is greater
than the second one (lower index). So the critical factor
is the number of wavelengths required to satisfy the
network demands.
The solution of the planning and designing problem is
based on the following equations.
Yw= Aw * Xn
(1)
Aw is a matrix that shows the active optical fiber
network
links
(2p)
from
which
the
(n)
working
connection groups pass so its dimension is (2p x n), Yw
the column matrix (2p x 1) which has elements the
working busy capacity of each optical fiber network link
and Xn the column matrix (n x 1) which has elements
the connection group size of each node pair. The total
working wavelengths for all links (TYw) are given below
but the total working wavelengths of each link is the
term in the bracket.

TYw = Σ
Σ Aw i,j *Xj
(2)
i=1 j=1
The knowledge of each node pair demands which are its
requests for connection and their shortest full disjoint
dedicated protection lightpaths create the necessary
wavelengths for their satisfaction for each link.
Ydp= Adp * Xn
(3)
Adp is a matrix that shows the active optical fiber
network links (2p) from which the (n) protection
connection groups pass so its dimension is (2p x n), Ydp
the column matrix (2p x 1) which has elements the
protection busy capacity of each optical fiber network
link. The total dedicated protection wavelengths for all
links (TYdp) are given below but the total dedicated
protection wavelengths of each link is the term in the
bracket.

TYdp = Σ
Σ Adp i,j *Xj
(4)
i=1 j=1
A=AwUAdp
(5)
The unity of the matrixes Aw and Adp gives the matrix A
in which there are common active links for working and
protection lightpaths.
The total wavelengths are the following
TY = TYw + TYdp
(6)
The maximum (higher index) busy wavelength of each
optical link is λmax,i. The maximum (higher index) busy
wavelength of all optical links is λmax and λmax=
maximum (λmax,1, λmax,2, …, λmax,2p).

When
the
protection network is not used the term which multiplied
with (m/N) is neglected and the available resources are
less. The equation (8) means that multiplying the number
of the necessary working WDM and optical fiber
systems of each link with the m:N ratio creates the
necessary protection WDM and optical fiber systems.
The m:N=1:7 shared protection WDM and optical fiber
systems of each link means that the maximum number of
working WDM and optical fiber systems that sharing a
protection WDM and optical fiber system is seven. It is a
practical way to reduce the cost of the protection
network. The roundup is always done for the larger
integer. If there are not protections WDM and fiber
systems the equation (8) is zero.
The total WDM and optical fiber systems are
T= Tw + Tp

C. Synoptic description of the methods
Two methods are used in this paper. These methods
have two parts, the first part or the planning and
designing part that means network without failure and
the second part or network with failure. The algorithm of
allocation path and routing uses a more traditional
approach which is the shortest path algorithm. The
synoptic description of these methods is showed in the
table II. On the failure free network phase, the third step
(wavelength allocation step) is the more critical and it is
119

different to each method. The network has not nodes
with wavelength conversion. The working connection
starts from the source node and progresses through the
network occupying a wavelength on each optical fibre
and switch to another fibre on the same wavelength by
OXC, according to its shortest working optical path up to
arrive at the destination node. Simultaneously, the
protection lightpath of the connection starts from the
source
node
and
progresses
through
the
network
occupying a wavelength on each optical fibre and switch
to another fibre on the same wavelength by OXC, so
another full disjoint protection optical path is obtained.
So the full dedicated protection for this connection is
obtained. The difference between “without wavelength
conversion” and “with wavelength conversion” is the
occupied wavelength of the link after switching that is
the “same” with the wavelength if input, for the case of
“without” and “anyone” for the case “with”.
The assignment problem of both algorithms can be
used by both cases (nodes without or with wavelength
conversion) suitably modified. The assignment problem
of each algorithm is working as follows to keep the
capability of nodes without conversion. For the first
algorithm, each node pair uses the free available
wavelength after the maximum busy (higher index) one
which is the same for all optical links of the working
path of the connection and the same is done for the
protection
lightpath
of
the
connection.
The
first
algorithm is adapted in the problem of nodes without
wavelength conversion. In this scheme, all wavelengths
are numbered. The searching for available wavelengths
is done after the maximum busy wavelength and a higher
numbered wavelength is considered. The first available
wavelength is then selected. This scheme is requires no
global information. The assignment problem for the
second algorithm is as follows. For the second algorithm,
for each node pair the first same (lower index) free
available wavelength of all optical links of the working
path of the connection is assigned and the same is done
for the protection lightpath of the connection for the
same node pair. If there is any such wavelength for all
optical links, the connection is done by them. If no, the
first algorithm is done. The second algorithm is the First
Fit one adapted in the problem of nodes without
wavelength conversion. In this scheme, all wavelengths
are
numbered.
When
searching
for
available
wavelengths,
a
lower
numbered
wavelength
is
considered before a higher numbered wavelength. The
first available wavelength is then selected. This scheme
is requires no global information. The second algorithm
is used for the problem of nodes with wavelength
conversion.
When a failure occurs and an optical link cut, the
working and protection WDM and fiber systems of this
link are also cut and the network topology changes and
protection lightpaths pass the traffic. Table II presents
the synoptic description of the methods. Its worst case
time complexity of each method depends of the network
topology and the total number of connections. It is
O(t*q2) where t the total number of the connections. The
second method needs about 11 100th of the second (0.11
seconds) time to consume but the corresponded first
protection method needs only 5 100th of the second (0.05
seconds).
The
time
difference
of
these
protection
methods is small but the first method is faster than the
second one.
In graph theory, the shortest path algorithm finds the
shortest path between two given vertices in an undirected
graph G= (V, E).The shortest path connects the two
vertices and its length is minimum.

D. Example
It is assumed that the topology of the network is
presented by the graph G(V,E). This mesh topology is
used because it is a simple, palpable and it is easy to
expand to any mesh topology. The vertex set has q=8
elements which are V= {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8} and
the edge set has p=12 elements which are E = {e1, e2,
e3,…, e8, e9, e10, e11, e12}. Each edge has two optical links
of opposite directions with their fibers for each direction.
The connections of each node pair form connection
groups according to its shortest path and transverse the
network. Figure 1 presents the mesh topology.
Network planning and designing is flexible to meet
the needs of the network. The capacity of WDM optical
fiber system takes values of 8, 16 and 32 OCh
(wavelengths). The number of node pairs is n=8*(8-1)
=56. The source destination demands are not showed
because their tables are large. The m:N WDM and
optical fiber system shared protection is 1:7, which is a
practical way to reduce the protection network. No
further calculations and results are presented for the
network planning and designing because their tables are
very large and their meaning to solve the protection
problem is small. The symbolism V1,V2,V3 is usually
used as follows on optical path layer (OCh layer). If the
120

nodes have no wavelength conversion capability, it
means that the wavelength of the input port wavelength
is used at the output port. So a connection wavelength of
the optical link <V1, V2> routes at the same wavelength
one to the optical link <V2, V3> by WDM-OXC of node
V2 and thus, it is written V1, V2, V3. If the nodes have
wavelength
conversion
capability
means
that
the
wavelength of the input port wavelength is the same or
different at the output port. The dedicated protection is
done during the planning and designing steps allocating
to each connection two links full disjoint lightpaths
between the source and the destination node, one for the
working lightpath and the other for the protection
lightpath. If a failure occurs, the infrastructure will
change and the protection lightpath passes the traffic.
The capacity of the WDM system is 8,16 and 32 optical
channels and each node pair has two connections. The
total
working
wavelengths
are
200
and
the
total
protection wavelengths are 304, for each case of table 4.
So the total busy wavelengths are 504. The wavelength
protection ratio is 1.52. The <V1, V2> is assumed as a cut
link. The table III shows the node pairs connections that
pass through the cut link. The bold lightpaths are cut.
For
the
assignment
(nodes
without
wavelength
conversion), the tables which show the procedures and
the results of each algorithm are large, so I don’t show
them. The connection of each node pair forms a
connection
group
and
by
the
both
working
and
protection lightpaths proceed from source node to its
destination node and by allocating a common free
wavelength on all of the fiber links in the working
lightpath
and
one
corresponded
in
the
protection
lightpath. The entire bandwidth available on each
lightpath (working or protection) is allocated to this
connection during its holding time and the corresponded
wavelengths cannot be allocated to any other connection.
When
a
connection
is
terminated,
the
associated
lightpaths are torn down and the wavelengths become
free once again on all links along the routes. All
connection group sizes are equal to two (2). The second
algorithm has λmax,i wavelength for each link which is
lower or equal than the corresponded of the first one and
it means that equation (9) gives smaller or equal number
WDM systems for the second algorithm versus first one.
The difference of the performance is ought to the
maximum
wavelength
index
difference
of
two
algorithms. The lightpath length is an important factor
that effects on performance. The table IV shows the
performance of each case as number of WDM and fiber
systems. The performance of first algorithm is showed in
the table IV(x). The performance of second algorithm if
can find lower index free wavelengths for lightpaths with
only one hop length, is showed in the table IV(1). The
performance of second algorithm if can find lower index
free wavelengths for lightpaths with only one and two
hop
length,
is
showed
in
the
table
IV(2).
The
performance of second algorithm if can find lower index
free wavelengths for lightpaths with only one, two and
three hop length, is showed in the table IV(3). The
performance of second algorithm if can find lower index
free wavelengths for lightpaths with only one, two, three
and four hop length, is showed in the table IV(4). The
performance of second algorithm if can find lower index
free wavelengths for lightpaths with only one, two, three,
four and five hop length, is showed in the table
IV(5).Table
IV(y)
shows
the
improvement
of
performance if the second algorithm is used with
wavelength conversion.

E. Discussion and Proposals
Protection strategies are critical for optical mesh
networks.
Although
dedicated
path
protection
mechanisms are simple and fast, they use 100% or more
redundant capacity. Protection is the primary mechanism
to deal with a failure and it is faster but no flexible.
Spare wavelengths on the routes are dedicated or shared
across working path demands that have no spans in
common. It is not need to know the exact location of the
failure because it is capable of protecting against
multiple simultaneous failures on suitable working
lightpaths. This protection method can give to the
network surveillance after single failure as optical link
cuts, node failures, wavelength scratches and multiple
failures on working connection lightpaths. It is also uses

the coherent protection of the mesh network. If the
network is planned and designed to satisfy all its needs
with
protection
paths,
it
means
that
no
blocking
probabilities should be calculated. The algorithm of the
assignment
is
critical
because
it
could
be
saved
significant number of WDM and fiber systems and to do
the
network
design
less
expensive.
The
second
assignment algorithm has better performance than the
first one (table IV, case (5) versus case (x)) because for
each optical link its λmax is less or equal than the
corresponded of the first one and produces smaller
number of WDM and fibre systems. The other cases
(1),(2),(3) and (4) give the transition to case (5). The
wavelength conversion improves more the performance
because reduced number of WDM and fiber systems is
required, table IV(y). Its disadvantage is the usage of
wavelength converters that are expensive. In a mesh
network with wavelength conversion capability, each
output port of the optical switch is associated with a
dedicated wavelength converter. So it is able to convert
all the input wavelengths to any other wavelengths
without any limitation. This wavelength conversion
method
is
called
complete
one.
The
number
of
converters is equal to the number of the fiber links
multiplied by the number of wavelengths per fiber. So
the number of converters will be large and the cost of
such architecture can be high. The converters can be
incorporated in the OXCs. The second algorithm of
assignment is a variety of the First Fit. First Fit chooses
the available wavelength with the lowest index. This is
adjusted for both problems (nodes without and with
wavelength conversion). When the capacity of WDM
systems increases the number of these systems may be
same, table IV, cases IV(4), IV(5) and IV(y) but their
occupation percentage is different.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the problem of using the shortest path
algorithm to plan and design a WDM mesh network with
dedicated protection path is showed. The wavelength
assignment problem is studied by two algorithms. The
first one is looking for available wavelengths out of the
busy wavelength space and the second one in the busy
wavelength space. The second algorithm has significant
benefits versus the first one because it uses fewer
resources than the other one when a dedicated protection
lightpath is used with the shortest path algorithm for
both lightpaths. The first algorithm is faster than the
second one. But the conclusion is that both approaches
are suitable for the telecommunication traffic protection
for fault management. The selection of the suitable
method is based on wavelength availability of the failure
site. The wavelength conversion method has also better
performance
than
without
wavelength
conversion
method but it is more expensive and the optimization is
