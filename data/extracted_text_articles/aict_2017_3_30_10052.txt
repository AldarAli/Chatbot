Abstract—It is well known that one of the most serious draw-
backs of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
scheme in wireless applications is its high peak-to-average power
ratio (PAPR), which decreases the efﬁciency of power ampliﬁers
(PAs) and increases transmitter power consumption. We propose
a constant amplitude zero auto-correlation (CAZAC) equalization
scheme, which is a robust way of overcoming the PAPR problems
with the OFDM scheme. The CAZAC equalization scheme makes
the PAPR of multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-
QAM) OFDM signals into the PAPR of M-QAM single-carrier
signals. This paper proposes a new wireless system that introduces
the CAZAC equalization scheme. CAZAC improves the estimated
power-added efﬁciency of the PAs for a 16-QAM OFDM system
with 52 subcarriers from 10 to 30% because it reduces the
PAPR of 5 dB while the system imposes no penalties on the bit
error rate (BER). The paper also provides theoretical analysis
of CAZAC equalization and information on spectral control and
the efﬁciency of BER under fading environments.
Keywords–OFDM; CAZAC sequence; Zadoff-Chu sequence;
PAPR reduction.

INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems
that attain high speeds and high capacity have recently been
attracting attention in wireless applications, e.g., wireless
local area networks (WLANs), third generation partnership
project long-term evolution (3GPP LTE), and the digital video
broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) standard [1] [2].
However, the main drawback of OFDM is its high Peak-to-
Average Power Ratio (PAPR), which decreases the efﬁciency
of the power ampliﬁers (PAs) and increases transmitter power
consumption [3] [4]. Therefore, a number of techniques have
been proposed to reduce the PAPR [3]. Well-known techniques
are clipping-and-ﬁltering, partial transmit sequence (PTS), and
selected mapping (SLM). Clipping-and-ﬁltering limits the peak
amplitude of the transmission signal. However, non-linear dis-
tortion causes BER to degrade. PTS partitions input data into
disjoint sub-blocks. Moreover, each sub-block are weighted by
a phase factor.
This technique chooses the phase factor to minimize the
PAPR of combined signals. SLM generates multiple candidate
data blocks. All data blocks represent the same information.
Although PTS and SLM can be expected to create a certain
reduction in PAPR, both techniques need side information in
the receiver, which decreases spectral efﬁciency. The most
practical solution to improving PAPR is to introduce single
carrier frequency division multiplexing access (SC-FDMA).
The 3GPP LTE system adopts SC-FDMA for uplink multiple
access systems [2] [5]. However, SC-FDMA has not been
considered to be suitable for next-generation high-speed com-
munications.
A new PAPR reduction technique with constant ampli-
tude zero auto-correlation (CAZAC) equalization was recently
proposed [6] [7]. This technique multiplies frequency domain
OFDM symbols and CAZAC sequences to reduce the PAPR of
OFDM signals. However, this technique needs to use all sub-
carriers in the frequency domain, which violates the spectrum
mask deﬁned by the IEEE 802.11 a/g standard. Since this is not
an easy problem to solve, CAZAC equalization was used for
visible light communications that did not need to take spectral
management into consideration.
This paper proposes a new wireless communication system
with the Zadoff-Chu sequence scheme, which is one of the
most well known CAZAC schemes. The M-QAM OFDM
signal acts as if it were an M-QAM single-carrier signal in the
system by introducing the Zadoff-Chu sequence scheme as the
CAZAC scheme. Therefore, CAZAC improves the estimated
power-added efﬁciency of PAs from 10 to 30% for a 16-
QAM OFDM system with 52 subcarriers because it reduces
the PAPR of 5 dB while the system imposes no penalties on
BER. This paper also provides a theoretical analysis of Zadoff-
Chu sequence equalization and information on spectral control
and BER under fading environments.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II analyze
the CAZAC-OFDM system and consider applying CAZAC-
OFDM to wireless communication. Section III presents the
effect of CAZAC-OFDM in wireless communication. Finally,
conclusions are drawn in Section IV.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
A. OFDM system
The frequency domain symbol, X = [X0, X1, ..., XN−1]T
in OFDM systems is modulated by N-size Inverse Fast Fourier
Transform (IFFT), which converts the frequency domain to
the time domain. The discrete-time OFDM signal with N
subcarriers is represented as
xn =
N−1
∑
k=0
Xkej2πkn/N,
(1)
where j = √−1 and n are the discrete time indices. However,
receiver acquires frequency domain symbol Y by applying

∑

(2)
where σ2 is noise power.
The PAPR of the OFDM signal (1) can be expressed as:
PAPR = max |xn|2
E[|xn|2] ,
(3)
where E[·] is the expectation operator. PAPR is an index that
represents the amplitude ﬂuctuation of the OFDM signal for
each frame. We can see from Eq. (2) that the OFDM signal is
composed of a plurality of subcarrier signals, which causes
an increase in amplitude ﬂuctuations. A high PAPR signal
requires the power ampliﬁer to operate at a large input-back-off
(IBO) due to the corresponding value of the PAPR to amplify
the transmission signal without distortion. Increasing the IBO
generally greatly decreases the efﬁciency of PA.
B. CAZAC-OFDM
CAZAC sequences involve constant amplitude and provide
excellent cross-correlation properties. Therefore, CAZAC se-
quences are used in wireless communication systems such as
channel estimation and time synchronization. The Zadoff-Chu
sequence is one of these CAZAC sequences. The Zadoff-Chu
sequence, {ck}, is represented as:
ck =
{
ejπk2/L
(L is even)
ejπk(k+1)/L
(L is odd)
,
(4)
where L is the length of the CAZAC sequence and k =
0,1,...,N 2 − 1 denotes the sequence index. CAZAC sequences
are generated by cyclic shift of the original CAZAC sequence.
The periodic cross-correlation function, ρ, is deﬁned as:
ρ(m)
=
L−1
∑
n=1
cnc∗
(c−m) mod L

where m represents integer variable. In this paper, we choose
L = N 2 in this paper, where CAZAC N ×N precoding matrix
M is represented as:

Figure 1. Proposed CAZAC-OFDM system
All sub-carriers in a CAZAC-OFDM system include data
symbols. This system cannot include null sub-carriers. There-
fore, the spectrum of the proposed system does not satisfy the
spectrum mask.
The Zadoff-Chu sequences in Eq. (5) have periodic cross-
correlation performance. Therefore the original frequency do-
main symbol, X, can be demodulated by using complex
conjugate M H.
MM HX = NX.

Figure 1 shows the conﬁguration for a transmitter and
receiver in the CAZAC-OFDM system, which applies CAZAC
precoding matrix M to the mapping data after serial-parallel
conversion.
C. Analysis of CAZAC OFDM
We clarify why the PAPR of CAZAC-OFDM was the
same as the PAPR of mapped data signals such as 16 QAM.
Frequency domain symbol X′ is represented as:
X′
=
M T X


 .(10)
We assumed that L = N 2 was even in the following since the
OFDM system uses FFT, which rapidly computes the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) with input data having a length with
a power of two. Therefore, we propose that baseband OFDM
signal xn can be represented as:

Equation (11) can be transformed as:

{
−ej2π(l+n)/N}k =
{
N
(−ej2π(l+n)/N = 1)
0
(−ej2π(l+n)/N ̸= 1) .
(12)
In this case, if −ej2π(l+n)/N = 1, then 2(l + n)/N is odd.
From 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1 and 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1, l and n correspond
one to one. Therefore, when Eq. (12) = N, l is represented
as:
l = (N/2 − n) mod N.
(13)
Therefore, xn is represented as:
xn = N · c(N/2−n) mod N · X(N/2−n) mod N.
(14)
The signal at time n in Eq. (11) is obtained by rotating the
symbol of Xm. Therefore, the time signal of the proposed
system looks like a single-carrier signal. Figure 2 plots the
baseband signal on the complex plane. We applied 16 QAM as
constellation mapping to the frequency domain symbol in this
case. The PAPR of a single-carrier signal is generally lower
than that of a multi-carrier signal.
The proposed system ﬁrstly applies FFT to input signal
Y on the receiver side to obtain for get symbol Y in the

where G is the noise added to each subcarrier and M is the
conjugate of the matrix M. All elements of the matrix M are
complex number on the unit circle. In addition, all elements
of the matrix M are also complex number on the unit circle.
Therefore, noise is dispersed for all sub-carriers. As a result,
the proposed system is robust against noise including only
speciﬁc frequency components such as frequency selective
fading.
D. Proposed system
The frequency domain symbol of CAZAC-OFDM in Eq.
(10) includes data sub-carriers in all sub-carriers. Figure 3 plots
the difference between the spectrum with and without null
sub-carriers. If the IEEE 802.11 speciﬁcations are taken into
consideration, the normalized frequency can be multiplied by
40 MHz. The ﬁltering normalized frequency in Fig. 3, which
is smaller than 0.25, degrades BER. It is necessary, on the
other hand, to reduce the power spectrum by 20 dB between
the normalized frequencies of 0.225 and 0.275 according to
the speciﬁcations of the spectrum mask. Therefore, it is not
possible for ﬁltering to satisfy the spectrum mask.
We solved this problem in this research by decreasing
the symbol rate. Moreover, data sub-carriers were allocated
to all sub-carriers without using null sub-carriers. Therefore,
the proposed system did not decrease the data rate despite the
decreasing symbol rate.

Figure 4. CCDF performance
of the proposed system. Table I summarizes the simulation
setting. We will now present the simulation results of OFDM
and single-carrier (16 QAM) systems to enable a comparison
of performance.
We ﬁrst considered the complementary cumulative distribu-
tion function (CCDF) of PAPR to evaluate the performance of
PAPR, which is the probability that PAPR will be higher than
a certain PAPR value PAPR0, i.e., Pr(PAPR > PAPR0).
Figure 4 plots the CCDF of PAPR using the proposed system
as well as the OFDM and single-carrier systems. We found
that the PAPR of the proposed system was almost equal to
that of the single-carrier system. Moreover, the PAPR of the
proposed system was improved by 5.8 dB at the CCDF of
10−3 compared with the OFDM system. This PAPR reduction
resulted from CAZAC equalization. The CAZAC equalization
in Fig. 2, converted the amplitude of the OFDM signal to
the amplitude of the mapped data such as 16 QAM, which
improved PAPR.
We next examined the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed
system. We considered three channels: additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN), AWGN & frequency selective fading channels,
and Rayleigh fading. A speciﬁc frequency (101 MHz) was
highly attenuated, as plotted in Fig. 5 in the AWGN &
frequency selective fading channels, in addition to AWGN.
Figure 6 plots the BER of the proposed system and the
OFDM system under AWGN and the AWGN & frequency se-
lective fading channels. The results indicate that the proposed
system does not degrade BER. The signal power of speciﬁc
sub-carriers is highly attenuated in the OFDM system, and thus
BER is large even when the noise power is low. In contrast,
the BER of the proposed system is small because the inﬂuence

proposed system has excellent capabilities to resist frequency
selective fading.
Figure 7 plots the BER of the proposed and the OFDM
systems under AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. We found
that the BER of the proposed system was comparable to that
of the OFDM system in both channels. Therefore, CAZAC
equalization did not affect the multi-path fading compensation
of OFDM.
Finally, we show the spectrum of the proposed system in
Fig. 8. By decreasing the symbol rate, the spectrum of the
proposed system satisﬁes the spectrum mask standardized by
IEEE 802.11 speciﬁcation [1]. Therefore, the proposed scheme
can be applied to wireless communication systems such as Wi-
Fi and LTE.

CAZAC scheme would approximately improve the power-
added efﬁciency of the PA for a 16-QAM OFDM system
with 52 sub-carriers from 10 to 30% because it reduced the
PAPR of 5 dB while the system imposed no penalties on BER.
The system satisﬁed the spectrum mask deﬁned by the IEEE
802.11 a/g standards, while maintaining the same data rate, by
adjusting the symbol duration of the standards and increasing
the number of data sub-carriers. Moreover, the CAZAC scheme
had an advantage in reducing BER under frequency selective
fading environments and not degrading BER under Rayleigh
fading environments.
