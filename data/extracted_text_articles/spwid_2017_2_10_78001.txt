Abstract—We propose a preliminary work of a GIS-based partici-
patory sensing system for collecting city information which works
with a real-time collaboration of local government employees.
With garbage management data collected by our application, we
provide the running results of spatio-temporal data analysis that
uncover the latent relationships among the spacial distributions
of uncollectible garbage and city demographics. To discover such
relationships, we conducted simple experiments that predicted the
amount of uncollectible garbage from demographic and housing
statistics by regularized linear regression methods and show
that utilizing both population and housing statistics improved
the predictive performance. We also report that the features
of population and housing statistics, which are related to the
lifestyles of citizens, greatly affect the amount of uncollectible
garbage.

INTRODUCTION
Understanding the relationships between citizen’s activ-
ities and an urban information (e.g., types of housing) is
one critical topic for both citizens and governments. These
relationships could provide an understanding of cities from
various viewpoints, so that we can utilize knowledge for urban
management, urban planning and so on. For example, Budd [1]
studied what type of house burglaries could be predicted from
ofﬁcial British crime data. In a more recent study, Venerandi et
al. [2] proposed a quantitative method to study the relationship
between gang activity and a set of descriptors of urban forms
extracted from open datasets for areas in London. Since
providing security and safety are important for cities, these
observations should encourage more practical urban planning.
In this paper, we focus on ﬁnding the relationship between
garbage and urban information, including demographics and
types of residences. Waste management and recycling are
typical worldwide problems in various cities and countries
for improving public health and reducing environmental foot-
prints [3], [4]. In addition, since the cost of garbage man-
agement in cities is enormous (e.g., Fujisawa city in Japan
annually pays more than seven billion yen for garbage-related
city operations), garbage reducing initiatives are required for
a city to be cost-effective [5]. Thus, the ﬁnal goal of our
research is to provide valuable knowledge for cities to reduce
such management costs by analyzing the relationship between
garbage and urban information.
Our paper tackles two challenges: collecting ﬁne-grained
garbage information in realtime and analyzing the latent re-
lationship between the collected garbage information and the
urban information. In most Japanese cities, the information
about daily garbage amounts is measured and available only at
garbage centers. There is no detailed information on collected
garbage for each area of a city. Moreover, several types of
speciﬁc garbage, such as illegally-dumped or uncollectible
garbage, require a special cost on garbage management. How-
ever, such information has not been collected or stored at
all. Thus, we propose a new system called MinaRepo that
collects such information by participatory sensing of the daily
tasks of city employee. Secondly, we investigate the basic
statistics of the garbage data collected by MinaRepo and
urban information. Then, we conduct a regression problem
that predicts the amount of garbage in urban sites based on
the population and the housing statistics of Fujisawa city and
we identify the latent relationships among garbage and city
demographics.
In summary, contributions of the paper are as follows:
•
We introduce MinaRepo, a new way to collect ﬁne-
grained garbage-related information by piggybacking
on the daily tasks of city employees.
•
We reveal the latent relationships among garbage-
related information and city demographics based on
statistical machine learning methods.

RELATED WORKS
Various kinds of attempts on urban waste monitoring,
management, and its related technologies can be found in [6]
and references therein. Recently, a remote sensing system
has become a popular technology in those research topics. A
combination of remote sensing and machine learning method
was proposed by [7]. They conducted a linear regression
problem to estimate the amount of solid waste produced by
commercial activities on urban sites, but no population and
household statistics were considered in their analysis.
Great efforts have been made to improve and deploy
participatory sensing technology [8]–[10].These works show
the possibility of participatory sensing involving the citizens.
In contrast to these works, we especially focus on city ofﬁcers

as target users. In addition, our purpose is to provide efﬁciency
to their daily works to gather a lot of data with correct labels.
In the context of sustainability of cities and environment,
statistical analysis methods were utilized to detect relation-
ships between recycling and consuming behaviors [11], [12].
However, those articles did not focus on revealing relation-
ships among uncollectable garbage and city demographics
and adopted participatory sensing technologies for gathering
datasets.

MINAREPO
A. Expert Crowd Sensing
To understand a citys situation or its citizens activities,
it is necessary to obtain various city related information
generated by citizens. One way to get such information is by
monitoring the daily works of city administrative employees
because they are the ones dealing with city information and
citizens demands on a daily basis. For example, Fujisawa
city has about 3, 500 local government employees, some of
whom work outside of city hall, in areas such as garbage
collection, ﬁreﬁghting, or maintaining city infrastructure like
roads. By integrating their daily works with city sensing, large
amounts of useful data can be collected every day. We call such
piggyback sensing on the daily work of city employees Expert
Crowd Sensing. In addition, city employees are expected to
have more task speciﬁc knowledge of the city in which they
are working than general residents. For example, garbage
collectors, who daily travel through their assigned area, should
be knowledgeable about the whole area and could detect subtle
changes in a city. Consequently, expert crowd sensing enables
us to acquire more accurate human sensing data with greater
sensitivity. To achieve expert crowd sensing, a sensing tool
must satisfy the following requirements:
•
Easy integration with the daily responsibilities of city
employees
To enhance their daily work by such sensing, the tool
must not disturb their current daily activities and has
to efﬁciently support them.
•
Easy usage
Since most city employees are not information tech-
nology experts, our tool has to be easily understood
and simply leveraged.
•
Providing reliability, dependability, and security
The tool must be used in daily city functions, which
sometimes provide critical services for citizens. Reli-
ability and dependability are also needed for it. Since
city tasks often deal with the private data of citizens,
data must be securely protected.
To satisfy the above requirements, we took an approach of
user-engaged system development. We ﬁrst interviewed city
employees about the details of their work ﬂow in their daily
works and what kind of problems they presently face. We also
speciﬁed the types of city data that can be collected by their
works. After designing and implementing a prototype system,
city employees reviewed it and gave feedback to us. Then, we
reﬂected on such feedback and incorporated it into our system.
Such user-engaged development and reﬁnement were repeated
several times.
B. System Design and Implementation
Through
user-engaged
development,
we
developed
MinaRepo, an expert crowd sensing system that satisﬁes the
above requirements. MinaRepo is composed of smartphone
applications and server-side software. Fig. 1 represents its
usage ﬂow. If a city employee notices incidents that should
be reported, he/she opens the MinaRepo application of
his/her smartphone/tablet. First, he/she selects the type of
a report based on such city incidents as illegally-dumped
garbage, grafﬁti, uncollectible garbage, road damage, and
so on. Then he/she takes a photo of the city incident and
inputs a brief description for the report: ”these garbage items
are plastic bottles and are not allowed to be dumped in
this area.” At the same time, the GPS(Global Positioning
System) location information is automatically added to the
report. After inputting the needed information, he/she sends
the report to the MinaRepo server, where it is stored in
a secure database. The report can be accessed by a web
interface, which visualizes all the reports with tables and a
map interface, where city employees can check the details of
all reports by clicking on the report item. In addition, the web
interface provides a search functionality and ﬁlters the reports
by type, reporter’s name, or date. If an additional action is
needed (e.g., erasing grafﬁti or disposing of illegally-dumped
garbage), city employees can contact the appropriate city
ofﬁcials.

Figure 1. Overview of MinaRepo work ﬂow
We ﬁrst started to collaborate with the garbage-collecting
section of Fujisawa city. Through engaged development, we
conﬁrmed that the work ﬂow must comfortably ﬁt their daily
works. Usually, those reports are shared among city employees
in traditional analog ways; when a city employee notices a
city incident, he phones a manager and describes it. Then the
manager records it in a map document and faxes it to another
employee. This traditional procedure is time-consuming and
wastes human resources. MinaRepo enables city employees to
report city incidents easily and efﬁciently.

We deﬁned seven types of reports for the sensing tasks
of the garbage section and identiﬁed three types of actions
needed in their work: urgent action is needed, action is needed
but not urgent, and no action is needed. We also provide an
interface with which to choose the type of action required for
a report. When an ”urgent action is needed” report is input,
an e-mail, which includes detailed information of the report,
is automatically sent to city personnel. This functionality
increases efﬁciency.
For providing system reliability and dependability, we also
developed automatic system monitoring and backup function-
ality. When our systems is out-of-use, city employees can get
status notiﬁcation by e-mail so that they can work using their
traditional procedures.

SUMMARY OF THE MINAREPO DATASET
Our dataset, which consists of 1, 173 reports recorded from
October 6, 2016, to April 25, 2017, includes seven types of
labels. The ﬁrst label, residue, reports garbage that was dumped
or discarded in the wrong place or on a wrong day. The
second label, forgotten-garbage, is legal solid waste that was
overlooked by the garbage trucks. The third label, illegally-
dumped garbage, is solid waste that cannot be legally picked up
in Fujisawa city. The fourth label, garbage-station, indicates a
report about garbage problems at the specially designated drop
sites. The ﬁfth label, grafﬁti, reports a place where grafﬁti has
been written on walls or buildings. The sixth label, animal
corpse, denotes where an animals body has been found. The
remaining label, disaster, report places where a relatively major
incident happened and the damage caused by it. Examples of
reports with residue and grafﬁti labels are shown in Figs. 2
and 3.
Figure 2. Photo from reports with
residue label
Figure 3. Photo from reports with
illegal graﬁtti label
Reports were submitted by 55 users. The average number
of daily reports was 8.65. We show the numbers of reports
by label and user in Figs. 4 and 5. Residue labels were the
most frequently reported type. Grafﬁti reports were the second
largest type. Fig. 5 indicates that our system works with users
of different activity levels, including highly active users whose
number of reports are in the hundreds. In contrast, about 63%
of the users submitted fewer than ten reports in this period
because they had just started to use our application.
The time series plot of the numbers of reports is shown
in Fig. 6. One particular day got more than 100 reports
because on that day the local government was sponsoring
a special campaign to detect grafﬁti. The Lag-N autocor-
relations of this time series with N
= (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
were −0.07, 0.29, 0.19, −0.01, −0.02, 0.02, and 0.27, respec-
tively. Thus no signiﬁcant autocorrelation was found from this
dataset. We also checked the spatial autocorrelation of each
label. The spatial autocorrelations for the ratio of each label by
population were calculated on 192 areas of administrative dis-
tricts with K-nearest neighbor graphs (K = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Moran’s I value with the highest absolute value and its p-values
for each label are shown in Table I. The residue label got
a positive spatial autocorrelation, and its p-value was smaller
than 0.01. Thus, reports with this label are suitable for detailed
statistical analysis.

We utilized the demographic and housing statistics and
describe basic summaries to understand the spatial demograph-
ics in this city. Housing statistics consisted of information
about rental properties, such as identifying whether they are
condos, apartments, or houses. From this dataset, we obtained
87 features that include the number of renting rooms, the
average housing prices, average occupied areas, and so on.
Other characteristic features also seem to have correlations

with the amount of uncollectible garbage, for example, in-
formation about eligible renters, since some rooms can only
be inhabited by one person, and such convenient amenities,
including automatically locking doors, lockers for deliveries,
and access to the internet. We averaged these values for each
site. To compare our dataset and these statistics, we illustrated
the amount of residue per population, the spatial density of the
population, and the number of apartments per area in Figs. 7,
8, and 9.

EXPERIMENTS
We conducted experiments that predicted the amount of
uncollectible garbage with residue label by population on each
site. We employed linear regression methods: Elastic Net,
Lasso, Ridge, and Ordinal Least Squares (OLS) [13]. We
denote the target values, input values, and coefﬁcient vectors
as yn ∈ R, xn ∈ Rd for n = (1, · · · , N), and β ∈ Rd,
respectively. Then, we deﬁned the linear regression problem
with both the ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalty terms as:

where we denote the hyper parameters as λ1, λ2 ∈ R. When
λ1 ̸= 0 and λ2 ̸= 0 this method corresponds to Elastic net and
includes Lasso, Ridge and OLS as special cases with (λ1 ̸= 0
and λ2 = 0), (λ1 = 0 and λ2 ̸= 0), and (λ1 ̸= 0 and λ2 ̸= 0),
respectively.
We used the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the predictive perfor-
mance of these methods,

We employed three types of input features in our experiments
in which we used housing statistics (d = 87), and population
statistics (d = 12), and both (d = 99) were used as inputs. We
randomly picked 80% of the 192 sites as a training data set
and used the rest as a test dataset. Hyperparameters λ1 and
λ2 for the regularized linear regression methods were selected
by one-leave-out cross validation. We ran 10 experiments and
got the average and the standard deviations of the predictive
errors.
We show the experimental results in Tables II and III. Ridge
achieved the best predictive performances on RMSE and MAE.
Utilizing both the housing and population statistics improved
the performances over just using the housing or population
statistics.
To check the effects of the input features, we show the
coefﬁcient values learned by Ridge in Fig. 10. We also show
the top 15 highest or lowest coefﬁcient values and their
correlation with the target values in Tables IV and V. We
conﬁrmed that the features of the housing statistics obtained
the highest and lowest coefﬁcient values among the features
whose correlation was also high or low. We found various
kinds of input features, which might indicate the relationship

between garbage and city demographics, in Tables IV and V.
For example, housing characteristics, such as home security
companies, single-rentals only, self-locking doors, and free
internet, all of which are favored by young people living
alone, got the highest coefﬁcient values. The ratio of 30’s and
50’s inhabitants, which were features of population statistics,
obtained high values. On the other hand, different features such
as apartments that allow room-sharing also had high values.
This feature seems to be favored by young people with room-
mates; the popularity of such room-sharing is increasing in
Japan. In contrast, with Table V, we found completely contrary
features in Table IV. Such housing features as condominiums,
terraces, lightings, and ﬂoor heating, which seem to be favored
by families or senior citizens, had lower values. Population
statistics including 70’s and 90’s inhabitants also obtained
lower values.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a novel application for gathering
information on uncollectible garbage in a city. We also showed
the basic summaries of our dataset and visualized information
such as housing and population statistics. To understand the re-
lationships between garbage and demographics, we conducted
simple regression problems and discovered a set of features
that increases or decreases the amount of uncollectible garbage.
