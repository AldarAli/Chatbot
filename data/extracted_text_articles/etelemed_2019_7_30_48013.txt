Abstract—Wearable devices facilitate continuous monitoring of
personal health data. However, automated health state analysis
based on this data is challenging in various aspects. This work
presents preliminary algorithm evaluation results for health state
irregularity detection based on a continuous data sample collected
by an in-ear heart rate and body temperature sensor. The results
show that a One-Class Support Vector Machine could be suitable
for the task.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices like smart watches and ﬁtness trackers are
becoming an integral part of our lives. This facilitates contin-
uous monitoring and analysis of personal health data outside
of clinical environments [1]. There are already applications
which use the ability of wearable devices for speciﬁc disease
monitoring, like the heart arrhythmia detection functionality
by the Apple Watch [2] or the Empatica Embrace 2 seizure
detection bracelet [3]. But, none of them considers a person’s
overall health state. Based on this background, we have built
a prototype of a real-time monitoring system for automated
irregular health state detection [4]. The centerpiece of this
system is a machine learning server component, deciding
whether measurements are normal or indicate a change in a
persons health state.
Interpretation of sensor health data is challenging. Phys-
iological Response Patterns (PRP) depend on many factors
like activities, the environmental context or demographic data
and can change over time [5]–[7]. Therefore, PRPs can not
be described in general terms. Algorithms have to be trained
on a person related basis. Additionally, it is often difﬁcult to
collect and access irregular PRPs [8] and thus, this data is
not available during training of algorithms. Furthermore, not
only the accuracy of applied algorithms plays a key role, also
sensitivity and speciﬁcity need to be taken into account to
reduce, for example, alarm fatigue [9].
However, anomaly detection algorithms could be one type
of algorithms used to classify individual PRPs as either normal
or irregular. They have been successfully used in other domains
(e.g., credit card fraud detection or measurement error detec-
tion) where irregular data is not available or can change over
a period of time [10].
The objective of this work is to evaluate four anomaly
detection algorithms in the context of wearable sensor gen-
erated health data. The aim is to verify whether anomaly
detection algorithms, already successfully used in other ﬁelds
than medicine, are suitable for the above mentioned system to
detect irregularities in continuously measured health data like
body temperature and heart rate.
The remainder of this work is structured as follows:
Section II describes the approach for data collection, data
preparation and evaluation of the selected algorithms. In
Section III, the classiﬁcation results of the algorithms are
presented. Finally, a conclusion and an outlook about future
work is given in Section IV.

METHODS
The anomaly detection algorithms have been selected so
that they are based on different mathematical concepts. The
selected ones are Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest, One-
Class Support Vector Machine and Autoencoder. For assess-
ment of these algorithms, a 72 hour-long data sample of a
healthy 28 year old male subject (N = 1) was recorded using
the prototype. Utilizing an in-ear sensor, the vital signs body
temperature and heart rate were measured in 5 second intervals.
For later division of the collected data into training and test
set, the measurements were labeled according to the performed
activity. After collection of the sample, the data was split into
2 minutes long time-series, having an overlap of 30 seconds
(N = 6200). Since generation of irregular health data is not
possible at the push of a button, the measurements during the
activities sport, metro and eating were regarded as artiﬁcial
irregularities. All the remaining measurements were considered
as normal. Training of the algorithms was based on a data-
driven approach supplement with two statistical features (i.e.,
mean and standard deviation of heart rate and body tempera-
ture). Only the normal data was used for training. Finally, the
anomaly detection algorithms were evaluated on the artiﬁcial
irregular data using confusion matrices to calculate the metrics
accuracy, sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

RESULTS
The performance evaluation of the algorithms was done in
an overall setting and individually for each type of irregular
data. In the overall setting (see Table I), the algorithms per-
formed with an accuracy higher than 80 %. With the exception
of the Isolation Forest, speciﬁcity was higher than sensitivity.
All algorithms showed a speciﬁcity higher than 88 %. For
sensitivity, the algorithms reached results better than 76 %. The
best overall results were achieved using the One-Class Support

Regarding each type of irregular data individually (see
Table II), the activity sport was identiﬁed best in all four
algorithms. The Local Outlier Factor and the Autoencoder
performed better for the type eating than for the type metro.
The One-Class Support Vector Machine and the Isolation
Forest reached better results for the type metro than for the
type eating.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work shows preliminary results regarding the ability
of anomaly detection algorithms to classify PRPs of activities
collected by wearable devices as either normal or irregular.
The use of these algorithms in combination with the prototype
could potentially enable individuals to identify aggravations of
their health earlier and thus, seek medical attention earlier.
The advantage of the selected algorithms is that they
consider the great inequality in the distribution of the two
kinds of data, normal and irregular. By changing the deciding
threshold between normal and irregular time-series measure-
ments, it is possible to take inﬂuence on the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of an algorithm. This is of most importance in
medical applications and allows to change the focus between
not missing any true positive or not having to many false
positive classiﬁcations. For speciﬁc applications, this tradeoff
would have to be individually reviewed. The most promis-
ing results for prototype use were shown by the One-Class
Support Vector Machine. However, the other algorithms have
also shown positive results, so that a majority vote could be
considered, if computationally reasonable.
Further research is needed to assess whether the same
results can be achieved for more subjects and if irregularities
caused by an imminent or already occurring disease could
also be detected with high accuracy, sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Additionally, adding more monitoring resources for vital signs,
such as blood pressure and respiratory rate, could improve the
results.
