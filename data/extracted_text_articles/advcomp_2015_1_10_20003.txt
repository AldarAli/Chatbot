Abstract—The paper gives a high-order precision and high 
resolution scheme for the governing equations of the 
detonation in condensed explosives. Based on the relaxation 
approximation, 
the 
nonlinear 
governing 
equations 
of 
condensed explosives detonation are transformed into linear 
relaxation systems, in which it can avoid solving Riemann 
problem and calculating the Jacobian matrix of nonlinear flux, 
and it is not necessary to split the source term of chemical 
reaction law. A fifth-order WENOM (Mapped Weighted

discretization and a fifth-order IMEX (IMplicit-EXplicit) 
scheme of linear multistep methods with monotonicity and 
TVB (Total Variation Boundedness) in time discrtiezation are 
utilized. The proposed method is applied to numerically 
simulate the steady structure of a one-dimensional planar 
detonation wave and the unsteady propagation of a one-
dimensional 
spherically 
divergent 
detonation 
wave 
in 
explosives PBX-9502. The test cases demonstrate that the 
proposed method can obtain very satisfactory numerical 
results in terms of accuracy and resolution.

 INTRODUCTION 
The design of complex engineering devices that use high 
explosives to do useful and controlled work requires the 
capability to numerically simulate detonation with high 
fidelity [1]. In the past several decades, the Lagrangian 
method [1] is in the majority because of its nature character 
to treat with the interface of multimaterial. However, in the 
recent decade, more attention has been paid to the Eulerian 
method due to its following advantages: 1) to well preserve 
conservation of the total energy due to usually using finite 
volume discretization; 2) to commonly sharpen the 
discontinuity of detonation wave due to using high resolution 
scheme; 3) to easily construct high-order precision in 
temporal and spatial discretization; 4) to conveniently utilize 
small meshes to improve accuracy due to employing fixed 
space grids. Representative works show some fruits of 
Eulerian method [2]-[5]: using second-order Godunov 
scheme, adopting simple equation of state (usually perfect 
gas formulation) and chemical reaction model, employing 
split way to treat with the chemical source term. 
The governing equations of the detonation in condensed 
explosives are nonlinear hyperbolic conservation system 
with strongly stiff reaction source term of chemical reaction 
and complex equation of state. It is the strong stiffness of 
reaction source term and the complexity of equation of state 
that brings enormous difficulty to numerically compute the 
detonation by high-order precision and high resolution 
scheme. 
When strongly stiff source term is discretized, in-
sufficient spatial/temporal resolution may cause an incorrect 
propagation speed of discontinuities. H. C. Yee [6][7] points 
out that the phenomenon of wrong propagation speed of 
discontinuities is connected with the smearing of the 
discontinuities caused by the discretization of the advection 
term. The smearing introduces a nonequilibrium state into 
the calculation, thus as soon as a nonequilibrium value is 
introduced in this manner, the source term turns on and 
immediately restores equilibrium, while at the same time 
shifting the discontinuity to a cell boundary. The analysis 
shows that the degree of wrong propagation speed of 
discontinuities is highly dependent on the overall amount of 
numerical dissipation contained by the numerical scheme. So, 
excellent shock-capturing scheme for detonation wave 
discontinuity must possess the high resolution, namely low 
numerical dissipation. At present, most high resolution 
schemes have utilized Riemann solver [8] based on simple 
equation of state, such as the perfect gas with gamma law [9]. 
However, unreacted solid component and gas product 
component of detonation in condensed explosives usually 
utilize some complex equation of state [10], such as Jones-
Wilkins-Lee (JWL), HOM, BKW, Davis, extremely, 
SESAME data library, and so on, also, the temperature and 
pressure of mixing zone in chemical reaction needs to 
iterative operation when generally considering pressure and 
temperature as equilibrium state. Apparently, the high 
resolution scheme based on Riemann solver is difficult to 
construct numerically flux about the flow equations of 
detonation in condensed explosives. In order to capture 
exactly the shock discontinuity, besides the high resolution 
in spatial discretization, the high resolution in temporal 
discretization is very necessary. Hundsdorfer et al. [11] show 
that the unsplitting explicit and implicit scheme is more 
reliable: the advection term adopts explicit discretization, 
and the source term adopts implicit discretization. 
Recently, developing a relaxation method is an effective 
strategy to numerically solve hyperbolic conservation system 
[12]-[15]. The main idea of the relaxation method is to 
transform the nonlinear hyperbolic conservation system into 
linear hyperbolic relaxation equations by means of relaxation 
approximation. When the relaxation rate tends to zero and

the subcharacteristic condition is satisfied, the solution of the 
relaxation equations converges to the solution of the original 
hyperbolic conservation system. In comparison with upwind 
schemes such as the Godunov scheme, relaxation method 
does not require the Riemann Solver and the computation of 
its Jacobians. These features make the relaxation method 
particularly suitable for those systems where the Riemann 
problem is difficult to solve or when it is not possible to 
perform analytical expression for Jacobians. The relaxation 
method is gradually applied to gasdynamics [16], shallow 
water motion [17], multimatierial and multicomponent flow 
[18], magnetohydrodynamic [19]. 
In this paper, the relaxation method is applied to 
numerically simulate the typical detonation problem about 
the condensed explosives. After the nonlinear governing 
equations of the condensed explosives are transformed into 
linear 
relaxation 
equations, an 
improved 
fifth-order 
WENOM [20] is utilized to spatially discretize and a fifth-
order IMEX scheme of linear multistep methods with 
general monotonicity and boundedness properties is utilized 
to temporally discretize [11]. The numerical examples about 
one-dimensional detonation wave in explosives PBX-9502 
demonstrate that our method has high accuracy and high 
resolution properties. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we give 
the governing equations of detonation in condensed 
explosives. In Section III, we establish the relaxation 
equations for the governing equations of detonation. In 
Section IV, the numerical scheme for the relaxation 
equations is gives. In Section V several numerical tests are 
shown. Some conclusions are presented in Section VI.

For condensed explosives, there are several huge 
numbers in the chemical reaction rate. For example, for high 
explosives PBX-9502, I=4.0×106, G1=1100.0, G2=30.0, so 
the source term for the chemical reaction rate is regarded as 
strongly stiff.

ESTABLISH OF RELAXATION EQUATIONS 
By means of relaxation approximation, the governing 
equations about condensed explosives may be replaced by 
the following relaxation system:

The linear characteristic of relaxation system (2) is

approach the solutions of the original problem (1):

Thus, system (4) is dissipative if the subcharacteristic 
condition holds. It can be thought that introducing relaxation 
rate is equivalent to introducing numerical dissipation. 
In practice, the elements of diagonal matrix in system (2) 
may be chosen as: 


A implies the bigger numerical dissipation.

A third-order Runge-Kutta method [21] is used for 
starting procedure of this IMEX scheme. 
Finally, the relaxation scheme with temporal-spatial fifth-
order precision about the detonation flows in condensed 
explosives turns into the expression (8). It is worthy to 
indicate that the discretization procedure does not solve 
Riemann problem.

A. Steady structure of 1D planar detonation wave 
When the detonation arrives at the steady state, the 
distribution of physical variables in chemical reaction zone 
can be exactly obtained by means of the Rankine-Hugoniot 
relations of detonation wave. 
The calculating length of explosives takes 5.0cm, and the 
explosives is initiated by the Chapman-Jouguet condition at 
its left hand side. The distributions of pressure, relative 
volume, velocity and mass fraction in chemical reaction zone 
are obtained, and comparisons are made with the exact 
solutions. Figure 1(a-d) gives the results where the mesh 
sizes are 
 1 100
x
/
, 1 200
/
, 1 500
/
, 1 1000
/
 cm 
respectively. At the same time, the relation of the Chapman-
Jouguet velocity and Von Neumann pressure to the mesh 
sizes is given in Figure 2(a-b). From Figure 1, the shock 
front of detonation wave is well resolved, and the spurious 
oscillation does not appear in the vicinity of the shock 
discontinuity. From Figures 1 and 2, when the mesh size is 
less than 1 500
/
cm (about 50 meshes in the reaction zone), 
the calculating solutions agree well with the exact solutions. 
Figure 3(a-b) shows the change of pressure and 
velocity at several typical times on the course of unsteady 
propagation of the detonation, in which the discretized mesh 
is 
1 500

4.80, 5.28s. From the results, the pressure grows much 
quickly, and reaches the steady state about 3.84s after 
initiating CJ conditions. The change agrees well with the 
experimental results [10].

B. Unsteady propagation of 1D spherically divergent 
detonation wave 
When a divergent detonation wave propagates in 
spherical way, the physical variables behind the shock front 
will sharply descend. A poor numerical scheme is usually 
unable to correctly treat with the effect of geometry factor to 
result in detonation extinguishing [1]. 
The calculating radius of spherical explosives takes 
5.0cm, and the explosives is initiated by the CJ condition at 
the center. Figure 4(a-b) shows the change of pressure and 
velocity at several typical times on the course of unsteady 
propagation of the detonation wave, in which the discretized 
mesh is 
 1 500

3.84, 4.32, 4.80, 5.28s. From the results, the pressure and 
velocity grow along with increasing distance and reach 
quasi-steady state about 3.84s after initiation, whose 
values are lower than the corresponding planar ones.

CONCLUSION 
This paper presented the relaxation method for 
numerically simulating the detonation in condensed 
explosives, and a temporal-spatial fifth-order precision 
scheme is utilized to discretize the relaxation equations, 
which does not require solving Riemann problem and 
calculating the Jacobian matrix of nonlinear flux and 
splitting the source term of chemical reaction law. The 
calculating results for the steady structure of a one-
dimensional 
planar 
detonation 
wave 
and 
unsteady 
propagation of a one-dimensional spherically divergent 
detonation wave in PBX-9502 demonstrate the high 
precision and high resolution of the present method. The 
present method will be generalized to two-dimensional 
detonation problems in condensed explosives.
