Abstract— Temperature is the most important parameter to be
measured in industry, automation, environment and many
other fields. Almost any silicon diode can be used as a
temperature transducer. Its main advantages are the high
precision and the high long-term stability while the drawbacks
are the limited operation temperature and the parameter
spread
due
to
fabrication
uncertainties.
We
propose
a
dedicated fabrication technology for silicon-based temperature
diodes, specifically designed and optimized to overcome these
limitations. It is designed for higher temperature sensing
applications where simple calibration, high accuracy and high
long-term stability are most important. We demonstrate test
results to evaluate the obtained process stability and discuss
potential application fields in hybrid multi-sensor systems and
more complex feedback-based sensor-actor systems.

INTRODUCTION
The demand for high performance sensors in the field of
process and environmental control, automation and security
is
obvious.
Here,
sensors
for
pressure,
humidity,
concentration [1], play the most important role. But high
accuracy and long term stability of those sensors must been
seen in context with the performing of temperature. Another
trend goes conform to the accuracy: the spatial distance
between the main sensor (e.g. pressure) and the temperature
sensor or the distance between the temperature sensor and
the measuring substance (air, liquid, solid matter) must be as
small as possible. From another perspective, [2] classifies
this fact regarding the invasive, semi-invasive and non-
invasive principle. Miniaturization and integration are the
strategy in the future. Therefore, in the last years the sensing
of temperature has played an ever increasing role in different
fields of smart sensor systems and system integration. With
the silicon-diode based temperature sensor described in [3] a
common
denominator
has
been
found
for
all
these
challenges. In following we describe three typical designs
and technologies of silicon temperature sensors.
First of all the design and technology of single-chip
temperature
sensors
including
proposals
for
a
higher
temperature range will be described. Advantages regarding
stability, working range, size, cost, ease of use, are compared
to the well established thermocouple, resistive and thermistor
based temperature sensors. To enter this market with single-
chip silicon temperature sensors is more difficult but
possible. Decisive advantages should be the compatibility of
the electrical interfaces and signal processing [2] and the
potential for an easy-to-integrate assembly process in chip-
on-board or flip-chip technologies.
Secondly the silicon diode as temperature sensor is
described forwarding full or hybrid integration close to the
signal processing. The main advantages should be the
technology compatibility from the process point of view and
the assembly as close as possible to other devices. Sensors
measuring environmental parameters such as humidity,
pressure, force, gas and liquid concentration have typically
strong temperature dependencies. This temperature cross
sensitivity has in most cases the effect, that the higher the
working temperature is, the lower the resulting accuracy for
the
primary
quantity
under
investigation.
Temperature
measurements at the point of primary detection system (for
the purpose of temperature compensation) are absolutely
necessary.
The third case is of increasing importance for sensor-
actor-systems where integrated temperature sensors decide
about accuracy and expense for calibration. One predestined
system is the dew point sensor system [4]-[6]. Such a sensor
system consists of two different transducers (temperature and
condensation)
and
a
heating-cooling
system.
The
temperature sensor has to measure the water temperature as
the result of a closed-loop conducted by the cooling element.
For
all
these
applications
an
integrated
silicon
temperature sensor can have the same dominator and enough
potential for extended temperature applications. Trends in
application fields like smart mobility, smart health, smart
security, and smart manufacturing [7] go conform to the
progressive
trends
of
microelectronic,
micro
system
technique [8] and key enabling technologies [9].
In Section II, the technology strategy is described under
the point of view of possible kinds of silicon integration.
Basis for this integration is the typical current-voltage
characteristic of a silicon p-n junction (see Section III).
Section
IV
covers
different
temperature
sensors
and
applications. Section V concludes the paper.

TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY
Already
in
[4][10],
the
monolithic
integration
of
temperature sensors in a CMOS- process had been described.
Up to now, some of these concepts have been realized by
products on the market.
Figure 1. Selection of different sensor integration
Fig. 1 presents an overview of different integration
concepts for temperature sensors into systems. Type A is part
of a complete CMOS process realized e.g. in [11]-[13]. After
the CMOS process, no further back end technology steps are
necessary. The CMOS electronics can be used for signal
processing of the temperature signal [14].
In case of type B temperature sensor the CMOS process
is added by back end processing steps. Typically, Micro-
electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology steps like
membrane etching or realization of electrodes including
deposition of functional layers
are described
by this
technology chain. Both realizations have limitations due to
the temperature range of CMOS electronics.
Type C is similar to A, except that the temperature sensor
fabrication is based on selected CMOS steps only (diffusion,
metallization
and
passivation).
Substrates,
diffusion
parameters and metallization can be selected to obtain a
higher operation temperature of the sensor [15]-[16]. In the
same matter, Type D is the most commonly used technology
in micro sensor systems. From the main sensor point of
view, the temperature sensor stands for front end processing
followed by the sensor specific MEMS steps.

SILICON P-N JUNCTION TEMPERATURE SENSORS
The electrical potential difference (at a given current) at p-n
junctions shows pronounced temperature dependence. With
increasing temperature the current-voltage characteristics
shifts to lower voltages. This relationship is shown in Fig. 2.
This correlation between current, voltage and temperature is
the base for the use of p-n-junctions in temperature
measurements.

Single p-n junction Temperature Sensor
In Fig. 3 a typical layout is shown. In order to minimize
the voltage deviation by using higher currents, a four-wire
measurement is possible. Since n-substrate is used, the
effective diode is formed by the p-type implantation in the
middle of the structure.

This allows a single-point calibration. By modifying the
preparation using silicon-in-insulator (SOI) technology, the
measuring range can be extended up to 250 °C. In this case,
the manufacturing tolerance, i.e. the deviation of the
characteristic curve of a sensor from the mean value, is
minimal. The biggest differential illustrated in Fig. 5 at 140 °
C corresponds to a relative error of 0.5 %.

p-n junction temperature sensor for error compensation
(using the example of a pressure sensor)
A silicon based piezoresistive pressure sensor is a good
example for a monolithic integration of a MEMS component
with a temperature sensor. Temperature variations influence
parameters like linearity, sensitivity and accuracy. The on-
chip
temperature
measurement
is
essential
for
a
compensation of these cross sensitivities. An integrated
silicon temperature sensor realized as p-n junction does not
need further technology steps, but its integration has further
advantages.
Firstly the sensor can be placed close to the piezoresistors
and measures the temperature direct without artefacts,
secondly the p-n junction does not need additional layers
such as metal depositions which could cause mechanical
effects and affect the performance of the piezoresistors. Fig.
6 shows a typical design where the Wheatstone bridge and
the temperature sensors (left hand corner) are integrated on
one chip. The integration of several diodes at different places
does not cause additional cost but does e.g. not provide
further improvements of this concept.

junction as temperature sensor [17]
C.
p-n junction temperature sensor as part of a sensor-
actor-system (using the example of a dew point sensor)
Temperature sensors are of central importance in the
realization of a thermal detecting dew point sensor [5][18].
On the one hand temperature sensors are used to determine
the state of condensation on a sensitive sensor membrane, on
the other hand to detect the temperature of the sensing spot.
Water has a high heat capacity and a high enthalpy of
vaporization. Thus, it makes up a high energy conversion in
the evaporation even of smallest water droplets. The heat
capacity of a micro mechanic membrane with heating and
temperature sensing elements, however, is extremely small.
Comparing the heat capacity of a dewy and not dewy spot on
the membrane can determine condensation qualitatively. For
this task it is ideal to use Seebeck elements. These allow the
determination of a temperature profile in response to a
transient heating pulse.
In a balance of condensation and evaporation, located on
a water-surface, the surface temperature is corresponding to
the dew point temperature. To determine the temperature of
the condensing surface of the thermal dew point sensor, two
measurements are required. By means of a diode, implanted
in the silicon bulk, is the bulk-temperature determined. The
temperature dependence of the diode forward voltage
(approximately 2.3 mV/K) is calibrated at several points in
order
to
achieve
a
high
accuracy.
Furthermore,
the
temperature difference between the silicon bulk and the
sensitive condensation spot on the membrane is determined
by using Seebeck elements. The two determined temperature
values are added and result in the absolute temperature of the
sensitive condensation spot. In Fig. 7 the design of the dew
point sensor is presented and both temperature sensors are
marked.
Further technology modules e.g. thinfilm peltier modules
[19] increase the value chain and the potential of further
miniaturization.

CONCLUSION
Silicon based temperature sensors are of increasing
importance for the actual and next generation of smart sensor
systems. Single temperature devices as well as integrated
device for process automation and environmental conditions
are not possible without temperature sensing. Current
development in this field addresses the extension of the
working range to higher temperatures. Next generation of

process sensors are focused more and more on in-situ and on
in-line applications and are exposed harsh environments and
higher temperatures. To keep pace with the advantages of
cost effective microelectronic technology the implementation
of silicon temperature sensor as front end or backend process
is still the most promising way.
