 INTRODUCTION  
Travel time estimate is important information applicable 
in many intelligent transportation system (ITS) services 
(route guidance, advanced traveler information system or 
advanced traffic management system) as well as in 
transportation planning process. It is one of the largest costs 
of transportation, and travel time savings are often the 
primary 
justification 
for 
transportation 
infrastructure 
improvements. Travel time information is acceptable and 
useful to all, decision makers, transport system users, 
technical and nontechnical staff and often used as relevant 
when comparing different transportation modes.  
Today‟s accessibility of different data sources and 
large quantity of data has double effect on travel time 
estimation. It eases up the procedure by allowing different 
and up to date quality data to be included in estimation. On 
the other hand it goes under the „curse of dimensionality‟ by 
making calculation process more demanding if even 
possible. Therefore statistical methods are not applicable in 
these cases and advanced analytics and data science 
mechanisms are required.  
In literature, different approaches for travel time 
estimation can be found. Although there are papers dealing 
with roads that have different characteristics [1][2], best 
results are achieved for freeways and free flow traffic 
conditions [5].Reason for this lies in the smaller number of 
factors influencing the travel time.  
Understanding traffic factors affecting travel time is 
essential for improving prediction accuracy. Some of traffic 
factors that affect travel time are free flow travel speed [1], 
occurrence of incident situations, holidays or other 
uncommon events [2], congestion level [3] and weather 
conditions [4][5].  
Another important element of travel time estimation is 
the forecasting period (the greater it is the higher is the 
prediction error) [6].  
When it comes to travel time estimation approaches 
applied in literature, they can be divided in two basic groups 
[7]: 
 Extrapolation models - mainly based on statistical 
approaches and historical values as regression models [8] 
[9], 
ARIMA 
(Autoregressive 
Integrated 
Moving 
Average) 
models 
[20], 
STARIMA 
(Space-Time 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) [10], 
Kalman filter [11], ANN (artificial neural networks) [12], 
SVM Support vector machines [13] and pattern based 
forecasting [14]. 
 Explanatory models - based mainly of factor or 
parameters analyses and traffic flow theory as dynamic 
traffic assignment [15] [16]. 
Paper has six sections. After introduction, a description 
of travel time estimation methodology is given. A case study 
and result comparison are defined, followed by a conclusion.

DESCRIPTION OF TRAVEL TIME ESTIMATION 
METHODOLOGY  
Two non-parametric methods, kNN and IRM, are used 
for travel time estimation and described in more details. 
 
A. K nearest neighbours  
K nearest neighbors is an algorithm that is based on 
similarity metric described by distance function locates the 
"best" neighbors (the neighbors that are most likely similar 
to the target). One of the most popular choices to measure 
this distance is Euclidean. Other measures include Euclidean 
squared, City-block, and Chebyshev [17]: 
            (1) 
where x and p are the query point and a case from the 
examples sample, respectively.

The choice of k can be regarded as one of the most 
important factors of the model that can strongly influence the 
quality of predicted outcome. The goal is to find an optimal 
value for k that achieves the right trade-off between the bias 
and the variance of the model. For travel time estimation 
purpose, value of k for each road class was determined by 
cross validation method.  
For regression, a kNN prediction is the average of the k-
nearest neighbor outcome. 
                                     (2) 
where yi is the ith case of the examples sample and y is the 
prediction (outcome) of the query point. For classification 
problems, like road classification, kNN predictions are based 
on a voting scheme in which the winner is used to label the 
query. 
 
B. Iterative regression method 
IRM is iterative multivariate linear regression approach 
where estimation for dependent continuous variable is based 
on determination of unknown number of independent 
variables from set of all proposed predictors. 
Estimation procedure is described through following 
steps: 
 
1. Defining dependent variable y and z1,…, zn independent 
variables. 
2. Calculate correlation coefficient between y and each of 
independent variables z1, …, zn. 
3. Select independent variable with the most significant 
correlation coefficient. 
4. Mark selected independent variable with x1 and calculate 
parameters a1 and b1 as first iteration by linear 
regression function: 
                                (3) 
5. Determine the residual r: 
                          (4) 
6. Calculate correlation coefficient between residual (r1) 
and each of remaining independent variables. 
7. Select independent variable with the most significant 
correlation coefficient. 
8. Mark selected independent variable with x2 and calculate 
parameters a2 and b2 as second iteration by linear 
regression function: 
                                 (5) 
9. Regression functions from first and second iteration give 
more precise estimation of dependent variable: 
               (6) 
10. Repeat steps 5 to 9 until residual r becomes small 
enough (stops effecting 0,001% of predicted value for y 
in previous iteration) 
 
C. Applied travel time estimation procedure 
Methodology proposed for travel time estimation 
procedure incorporates multiple data analytics techniques. 
Overall overview of used methods and procedures is given 
on Figure 1. 
First phase incorporates different data collection 
methods, data fusion and cleansing, as well as data 
interpolation (when needed). Product of these procedures is 
input for time series data analysis that results with detection 
of characteristic time intervals. This is done based on the 
analysis of speed records. Characteristic time intervals are 
considered to be time periods in which the vehicle 
throughput capacity on the observed part of the road is 
significant. For example, significantly low (to identify the 
morning and afternoon “peak” periods) or significantly high 
(free flow conditions). 
After this phase, gathered data are used for revision of 
official road classification. Reason for this lays in the fact 
that official road classifications are mainly used for general 
purposes and roads are classified based on infrastructural 
characteristics. For deep traffic analysis like travel time 
estimation this classification is not sufficient and new 
classification is developed. In this paper, classification 
methodology is used to classify road segments (continuous 
part of the road from one intersection to the sequent one) 
based on real traffic flow data collected from GPS tracks as

well as road segments infrastructure data. The software used 
for this procedure is StatSoft Statistica Data Miner. Priori the 
application of classification technique called kNN principle 
component analysis (PCA) was applied. The purpose of this 
was to reduce dimensionality of collected data and to select 
variables relevant for road classification.  
Since kNN algorithm is highly sensitive to the choice of 
k, after the reduction of dimensionality a v fold cross-
validation procedure is applied to determine k value. 
Distance measure used in kNN classification is Euclidian 
distance for standardized data. Data are standardized to 
transform all values (regardless of their distributions and 
original units of measurement) to compatible units from a 
distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
This makes the distributions of values easy to compare 
across variables and/or subsets and makes the results entirely 
independent of the ranges of values or the units of 
measurements. Results of this phase are road segments 
separated in different categories. For each of these 
categories, in next step, different travel time estimation 
procedure is carried out.   
At this point, whole data set is divided into two subsets, 
one for training and one for model development.  Travel time 
estimation is based on two approaches kNN regression in 
combination with v fold cross-validation and IRM 
approach.This is applied separately for each road class and 
each characteristic time interval. 
D. Advantages and areas of practice 
Developed travel time estimation procedure has multiple 
advantages for practical application as: 
 Supports application of  multiple data sources (different 
sensors);  
 Allows automated data fusion and dimensionality 
reduction; 
 Improves estimation procedure by basing estimation 
steps on real traffic performance data (road classification 
is based on traffic data, not only on road infrastructure 
data); 
 Once defined values of k for each road class (in cross-
validation step) doesn‟t need to be calculated again. Due 
to the fact that this is the most computational demanding 
step in travel time estimation procedure, future 
application of this procedure is much less time and 
computational expensive and therefore suitable for real 
time travel estimation:     
 Completely automated travel time estimation that can 
give results in real time. 
Travel time is one of most important values in traffic 
planning and allows decision maker to base its decisions on 
traffic performance on different routes/modes choice etc. 
Travel time estimation information can be delivered to 
drivers to aim them in route selection choice or to be a part 
of automated route guidance system as well as to be 
incorporated in different ITS services.

TRAVEL TIME ESTIMATION (CASE STUDY: CITY OF 
ZAGREB) 
 
The travel time estimation procedure we propose in this 
paper is applied for case study in City of Zagreb and 
described through description of data collection process, road 
classification, travel time estimation and evaluation of 
results. 
 
A. Data collection process 
Data used for travel time estimation were collected from 
three sources including 51 835 560 GPS tracks, road 
segments data and meteorological data from official 
Meteorological and Hydrological Service. Geographical area 
covered with data collection process was urban area of City 
of Zagreb, Croatia and time window for data collection was 
thirteen months. 
 
B. Data on the traffic conditions 
Traffic conditions are analyzed based on the GPS vehicle 
tracks. The data were recorded by the device and sent via 
mobile network. Data were sent to the local server and stored 
in the database (Table 1).

found in literature [18]. 
 
E. Road classification 
After the collection and fusion of gathered data and priori 
the development of travel time estimation, road classification 
has been revised (official road classification in City of 
Zagreb is defined by Spatial plan of City of Zagreb [19]).  
As a result of the procedure proposed on Figure 1, in 
Road classification box, a set of four distinctive variables is 
selected: 
• 
mean average speed on road segment, 
• 
speed‟s standard deviation on road segment, 
• 
length of road segment, 
• 
vehicle count of each road segment.  
Based on this, for road classification 28NN model [5] is 
used (k-nearest neighbors 
model that for segment 
classification takes into account neighborhood of 28 most 
similar road segments). Results of classification procedure 
separates roads in five classes marked as class A, class B, 
class C, class D and class E. Compared to official road 
classification that contains also five road classes (highways, 
fast roads, state, county and local roads) that are divided 
based on their construction characteristics and the level of 
authority in charge of their maintenance this way achieved    
results    are    distinct    in    47.22  %    cases.  
More on extracted road classes is given in Table 4, where 
number and share of segments included in each class, overall 
length of segments and their share in total road network 
length, number of records/segment length, mean average of 
number of records on each segment, vehicle speed mean 
average value, vehicle speed standard deviation and average 
segment length for each class are presented. Based on this 
data we can see that class E includes largest number of 
segments (around 64 %) and larges share (although 
somewhat lower than segment count share). By comparison 
of length and segments shares it is visible that class A 
contains smallest amount of segments but they have lower 
number of intersections and higher lengths then segments in 
others classes (length share/segments share for class A 
equals 3.07). Also, 2.96% of all segments belong to the class 
A, 11.76% to classes A and B and 30.36% to classes A, B 
and C. These classes have highest traffic flow and 94.7% of 
all records were recorded there. Based on average number of 
records for each class we can see that number of records per 
segment length decreases from road class A to road class E 
in non-linear manner. Mean average of number of records on 
each segment, vehicle mean average speed and its standard 
deviation as well as average length of road segment 
decreases from road class A to road class E. And while 
average speed for class A represents double average speed of 
class E deviation is increased. We can say that road class A 
while having highest traffic flow and average vehicle speed 
also has largest discontinuity in vehicle movements. 
Respectively, class E has lowest vehicle speed deviation and 
most continuous traffic flow. 
More on road classification based on hybrid approach 
can be found in literature [5].

IV. 
TRAVEL TIME ESTIMATION 
 
The travel time estimation procedure is described through 
definition of characteristic time intervals and application of 
kNN and IRM methods. 
 
A. Definition of characteristic time intervals for travel 
time estimation 
For the purpose of travel time estimation characteristic, 
time intervals should be identified. A presentation of one 
such analysis is given in Figure 3 for segment Slavonska 
Avenue, direction East-to-West. Figure 3 clearly shows the 
morning congestion which is most expressed in the interval 
between 06:00 h and 08:00 h and the afternoon congestion 
which is a bit longer,  taking from 15:30 h -18:30 h. 
 
Figure 3.  Segment speed analysis 
Based on such analysis characteristic time intervals for 
travel time estimation are defined as follows: 
• 
Morning peak interval (06:00-08:00 h); 
• 
Noon free flow interval (12:00-13:00 h); 
• 
Afternoon peak interval (15:30-18:30 h); 
• 
Evening free flow interval (21:00 – 22:00 h). 
B. Urban travel time estimation procedure 
At this point, whole data set is divided into two subsets. Data 
collected during first eleven months represents training set 
for model development. Data collected during last two 
months are removed from model development procedure and 
will serve for the travel time estimation error testing. 
 
C.  KNN based approach 
For each road class one road, belonging to that class, is 
selected to serve as demonstrative one for results of travel 
time estimation procedure for selected time intervals. These 
roads are defined in Table 5.

URBAN TRAVEL TIME ESTIMATION RESULTS 
 
Based on defined steps, different kNN and IRM 
regression procedures were applied on data set for each road 
class. From testing data set a number of vehicle tracks for 
each time interval is selected and compared with achieved 
results. Based on this data MAPE (mean absolute percentage 
error) is calculated for each road class and each time interval 
defined:

Described results are presented on Figure 9 for morning 
peak period, Figure 10 for noon time period, Figure 11 for 
afternoon peak period, and Figure 12 for evening period. For 
a morning peak period best results are achieved for road 
class E and IRM method, while for noon time interval best 
results are achieved for road class A and kNN method. For 
afternoon time interval best results are achieved for road 
class D with IRM method, while the same method results in 
highest MAPE for road class A. Results of evening time 
interval show that the best results are scored by kNN method 
for a road class D and the worst ones for road class C by 
IRM.

CONCLUSIONS 
Based on results achieved from case study in City of 
Zagreb, we can see that GPS tracks, meteorological data and 
data on road infrastructure present good starting point for 
urban travel time estimation. 
In a case of large data sets application of traditional 
statistical approach is not advised due to the computationally 
demanding process of travel time estimation. Dimensionality 
reduction applied in this paper resulted in reduction of 58 
input variables into the average of 21 of them mainly 
reducing variables with high correlations while keeping 
maximum data variability contained in original data set.  For 
example, it was evident that data on snow cover thickness 
and thickness of new snow cover are highly correlated. Data 
on new snow cover had higher influence on speed deviations 
and therefore remained in travel time estimation data set 
after the dimensionality reduction step. Also, data on 
direction and speed of wind had poor influence on travel 
time estimation and were mainly removed during 
dimensionality reduction step. Relative humidity and 
horizontal visibility were correlated in significant manner 
together 
with 
y 
coordinate 
of 
the 
record 
during 
autumn/winter period. This can be explained through 
influence of river Sava and often fogs in surrounding areas 
during the cold weather. Since y coordinate yield significant 
correlation with travel time only in this context it was often 
omitted during dimensionality reduction phase together with 
horizontal visibility variable while x coordinate proved to 
have high influence on the value of travel time. Beside x 
coordinate, road segment length, wet ground temperature, 
average speed, speed deviation, log time and daily air 
temperature remained in data set after dimensionality 
reduction step for each road class. As expected, values that 
identified road/segment as road name, segment ID, 
beginning and end coordinates had very high correlation and 
were mainly presented by segment ID variable after 
dimensionality reduction step. Also, it should be noted that 
vehicle ID remained as significant variable in data set 
proving the influence of driving characteristics of each driver 
to the travel time value. 
For reduced data sets, kNN and IRM methods results 
were compared. Based on the achieved results,  real time 
forecasting procedure is applied with forecasting interval of 
2 hours. Best results are achieved for road class A (mainly 
freeways) with MAPE 0.043197, followed with road class D 
and C. Lowest MAPE is achieved for road class B and it is 
0.188525.  
Comparison of results to others research is very difficult 
due to the fact that there is no research that uses same road 
classification technique or definition of characteristic 
estimation time interval. Therefore comparison will be made 
based on most similar values for characteristic time interval 
and/or road class. 
When compared to the results achieved in literature [20] 
for afternoon peak hour, road length of 2.9 km, desired speed 
of 64 km/h and without consideration of a long queue that 
based on this data would correspond to the road class A from 
our model the error achieved by model proposed in this 
paper is twice smaller (4.3%) than average error from 
literature (8.3%). 
When results are compared with Google maps [21] travel 
time estimate for a road class C in length of 2.317 km and 
afternoon peak period, the achieved result by Google maps is 
6 minutes (360 sec) while model proposed in this paper gave 
estimated travel time for this input data to be 477 seconds. 
Travel time value measured by GPS record was 476 seconds.  
Compared to results for morning peak period MAPE 
values of three algorithms from literature [22], point-
detection-based algorithm (10.6 %), probe-based algorithm 
with 5% probe rate (10.8%) and adaptive Kalman filter 
algorithm with 5% probe rate (7.6%), are higher than 
average MAPE value for all road classes achieved by model 
proposed in this paper. Average MAPE  for all road classes  
achieved by proposed model equals 5.02% for morning peak 
period.
