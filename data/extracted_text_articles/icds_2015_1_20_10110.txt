Abstract‚ÄîThe E-readiness Layered Model (ELM) tends to 
cover the lack of indicators measures for the e-readines index 
calculation. This paper‚Äôs aim is to test the effectiveness of this 
model through the comparison of an ELM estimted index and 
a calculated index. Indeed, European I2010 indicators‚Äô 
measurements database is used in this test and the comparison 
of data series shows a high correlation between the two indexes 
(Pearson and Spearman coefficients are above 0.95). Also, the 
two main differences between the data series are analysed in 
the light of two other international e-readiness initiatives (the 
Economist Intelligence initiative Unit one and the International 
Telecommunication Union one). This test shows that ELM 
could lead to estimate the e-readiness index using 6 indicators 
instead of 20 (70% less). 
Keywords-e-readiness; dynamic system modeling; state 
model; e-readiness layered model; Spearman coefficient. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The world discovered in 2011 the importance of 
composed indexes through the powerful financial rating 
agencies, such as Standard & Poors and Moody's. Indeed, 
the famous ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù rating for countries and financial 
institutions solvency can influence their economic stability. 
Similarly, the Shanghai ranking participates in guiding 
students towards the highest-ranked universities; the 
backwardness of the French universities in this index led to 
the creation of a parliamentary commission for the 
development of education in France. 
In this international context, the e-readiness indexes are 
an important approach for measuring and developing the 
integration of new technologies in countries and regions. 
These indexes are important as they contribute to the 
governments‚Äô e-Strategy assessment and the orientation of 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to different countries 
(investment in offshore software development, in call 
centers, etc.). However, the availability of Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICT) indicators‚Äô measures is 
one of the main issues for the development and spread of 
this concept. 
To address this issue, Belkhayat et al. [1] proposed an E-
readiness 
Layered 
Model 
(ELM) 
to 
reduce 
the 
measurements‚Äô need in the e-readiness estimation process. 
Belkhayat et al. [11] proved the convergence of the ELM 
and tested its pediction accuracy for one indicator. This 
paper evaluates the ELM capacity to reduce the indicators 
measurements‚Äô need for the e-readiness index estimation. 
 Indeed, Section 2 of this paper introduces the main 
issues related to the excessive measures need to calculate e-
readiness indexes. Section 3 gives a brief presentation of the 
layered approach proposed in the literature to overcome this 
problem. In Section 4, we precise the testing approach 
adopted and the results observed. 
II. 
EXCESSIVE NEED OF INDICATORS MEASURES: MAIN 
OBSTACLE TO THE E-READINESS CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT 
The e-readiness tends to measure and analyze the level 
of integration of ICT in countries‚Äô development. The 
measurement of e-readiness is a global index based on the 
compilation of a set of indicators correlated to ICTs. This 
concept of e-readiness has gained importance globally 
within last decade. Indeed, the action plans of the two 
World Summits on the Information Society (Geneva 2003 
and Tunis 2005) called for the periodic evaluation and 
comparison of international performance in the field through 
a composite index comprising comparable statistical 
indicators [2]. To this end, several organizations, such as 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), World 
Economic Forum (WEF), the Economist Intelligence Unit 
(EIU), have focused on this concept and have developed 
specific approaches for the e-readiness measurement and its 
exploitation in guiding the development of new technologies 
in different countries and regions. Two main objectives are 
reported for these approaches: ICT integration evaluation 
and different countries ranking according to a composite 
index [3]. 
Thus, each of these e-readiness approaches relies on a 
set of indicators that reflect a vision of the ICTs role in 
countries‚Äô development. These indicators can be related to 
the digital infrastructure, ICTs human resources, and also 
other areas that may be impacted by new technologies such 
as governance or economics. At this stage, the number of 
indicators considered by each approach may range from a 
dozen (11 approach ITU) to more than a hundred ("e-
readiness ranking" developed by IBM and EIU [4][5][6][7]. 
Thus, the calculation of an e-readiness index requires 
thousands of indicators measurements (the number of 
indicators multiplied by the number of countries in the 
panel). Also, to get an accurate picture, these measures 
should be carried out synchronously and in a relatively

small window of time. The UN report [7] presents the latter 
as a challenge: a window of 30 days was set in the approach 
used to measure the e-Government index, but the realization 
could not be done in less than 75 days due to the complexity 
of collecting and processing indicators measurements. 
Faced with the lack of measures, regular e-readiness 
evaluation initiatives resort to reducing the indicators 
framework 
or 
forcing

database 
completeness using measurements from previous years or 
estimating the missing measurement mainly by the hot deck 
method (expert comparison to other similar countries) [8]. 
However, the reduction of the indicators framework impacts 
the relevance of the index while the missing data estimation 
is difficult in the ICT field due to the unavailability of large 
historical databases and the frequent change of the 
indicators definition (necessary changes to take account of 
technological developments and societal phenomena related 
to ICT (4G-3G - DSL, social networks, e-learning, etc.) [9]. 
On the other hand, measurement quality differs from one 
country to another depending on the data source, the survey 
methodology or even the perception of people who respond 
to these inquiries. 
Davidrajuh produced an attempt to address the first issue 
through fuzzy logic [10]. To cope with the problem related 
to the exponential number of inference rules needed, this 
attempt was based on the aggregation of e-readiness 
indicators in a smaller set of "key indicators". However, the 
author does not specify the validation process and the results 
of this approach tests. We have not found any other related 
work.  
III. 
LAYERED APPROACH AND STATE MODEL FOR 
PREDICTING THE E-READINESS INDICATORS MEASURES 
We proposed an approach for modeling the e-readiness 
indicators evolution considering them as measurable 
characteristics identifying a ‚Äúvirtual" dynamic system [1]. 
This paper focused on a layered modeling approach and 
cross indicators impactability concept leading to a dynamic 
system state model. Indeed, the indicators are classified into 
three layers (basic layer, intermediate layer and target layer) 
according to the importance they represent to the e-Strategy 
process owner which is the highest authority of the state or 
country: 
Basic Layer: featuring the basic indicators that can be 
of two types: basic indicators on which it is possible to act 
by decision (example: Cellular phone network coverage or 
the rate of research and development (R&D) budget to 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be directly impacted by 
government decision) or general prerequisite indicator part 
of a wider area than that studied (example: illiteracy rates).  
Target layer: featuring indicators that represent a 
development goal, e.g., rate of e-business GDP to GDP.  
Intermediate layer: having intermediate indicators that 
are neither basic indicators nor target ones. These indicators 
generally represent milestones that help ensure the smooth 
progress of projects but are not final goals in themselves, 
e.g., percentage of the population using the Internet. 
Thus, this classification is based on an assimilation of e-
readiness to a dynamic system whose state is characterized 
by the chosen indicators framework and where the basic 
indicators represent the system control levers. This design 
leads to a state model linking indicators variations over 
time: 
ùê∏ùëâùëò+1 = (ùëÖùêºùëÄùëò)ùëá ‚àó ùê∏ùëâùëò + ùê∂ùëò 
 
       (1) 
where EVk is the indicators measures evolution vector 
for the period k (period between Tk-1 and Tk); Ck is a 
constant vector corresponding to the basic indicators 
evolutions planned by the e-Strategy stakeholders for the 
next period and (ùëÖùêºùëÄùëò)ùëá is the transition matrix calculated 
on the basis of previous measures and an indicators‚Äô 
impactability matrix [11]. 
Belkhayat et al. used Kalman filtering for testing the 
ELM convergence and the indicators prediction accuracy 
[11]. 
Thus, the ELM state model suggests that the knowledge 
of current measures and the planed variations in basic 
indicators (Ck commands) allows us to predict the other 
indicators variations and then the reconstitution of the next 
system state vector. 
ELM is a new indicators‚Äô measurements prediction 
approach used in the e-readiness field where the 
unavailability of large historical databases and the frequent 
change of the indicators definition are limiting the use of 
other known prediction methods used in the conventional 
sectors [9]. We could estabilish the convergence of the state 
model and the evaluation of the accuracy of the indicators‚Äô 
estimations in comparison with measured values [11]. In 
this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of the e-readiness index 
based on the prediction model in comparison with the other 
e-readiness indexes measured and estimated by other 
institutions. The methodology and results of this evaluation 
are the subject of the next section.   
IV. 
ELM EVALUATION: LAYERED MODEL APPLIED TO 
THE I2010 INITIATIVE 
A. Materials and methods 
We used the I2010 database [12] to test the efficiency of 
ELM through the evaluation of its potential reduction of 
measures need to calculate e-readiness using the predictive 
model. This database fits to our test needs because it is 
containing regular yearly measurements for a significant 
number of countries and indicators (29 countries and 52 
indicators). 
The testing approach relies on the comparison of two e-
readiness indexes: the one calculated on the basis of all 
2010 measures and the one calculated on the basis of 2010 
basic indicators measures and the ELM state model. Indeed, 
the use of 2008 and 2009 measures, as well as the 2010 
basic indicators measures, leads to the prediction of the 
other indicators variations; then, one can calculate the 2010 
index based on the predictive model.

ICDS 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Digital Society

To execute this approach, we began by reducing the 
database to keep only the indicators and the countries for 
which we have all 2008-2009-2010 measures. The reduced 
database included 20 countries and 20 indicators. 
The aim of the second step was to classify indicators 
according to the ELM three layers. The third step provided 
the necessary inputs to calculate the transition matrix of the 
state model (impactability matrix and calculation of 
indicators optimal values). Appendix 1 contains these 
elements that are the same used in [11] for the model 
convergence validation tests. 
The last step concerned the estimation of the indicators 
variations and the calculation of the two indexes to 
compare. In the following, we note ¬´ I2010-P ¬ª the index 
calculated on the basis of predictions and ¬´ I2010-M ¬ª the 
index calculated on the basis of all 2010 measures.  
B. Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows the two indexes for the 20 countries of 
the panel. We based the correlation analysis of these two 
data series on the Pearson correlation coefficient which ‚Äúis a 
measure of the linear association between two variables 
using quantitative data‚Äù, and the Spearman correlation 
coefficient which is a ‚Äúcorrelation measure of association 
between two variables when ordinal or rankordered data are 
available‚Äù [13]. The two data series correlation analysis 
gives us 97.5% for the Pearson correlation coefficient and 
95.3% for the Spearman correlation coefficient (countries 
ranking correlation). These correlation coefficients values 
(close to 100%) denote that the two data series are highly 
correlated. 
Also, the graphic analysis shows two main issues: the 
first is related to the measures and ranking deviations of 
Spain and Italy and the second is related to the tighter 
spreads between the five countries of the leading group: 
Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany and Ireland. To 
figure out these issues, we made comparisons of our two 
indexes among the other main e-readiness indexes measured 
in 2010: ¬´ e-readiness Ranking 2010¬ª published by the EIU 
and IBM and IDI (ICT Development Index) published by 
the ITU (International Telecommunication Union). 
1) First issue: Italy and Spain indexes and ranking 
differences 
Italy and Spain indexes have significant differences that 
affect the ranking. Indeed, if Italy and Spain are removed 
from the data series, Figure 2 includes the two indexes 
ranking differences of the other 18 countries (Denmark 
being the leader). 
Figure 2 shows that the countries ranking does not 
change except for Slovakia and Hungary, which had a small 
gap of about 1% and exchanged their position by passing 
Slovakia behind Hungary.  
 
Figure 2: Countries ranking difference between I2010-P and I2010-M. 
To understand this difference, we gathered the ranking 
of the two countries in the two other e-readiness indexes 
mentioned above. Hungary exceeds Slovakia of about 3% in 
the "e-readiness Ranking 2010 report‚Äù. In IDI, Hungary 
exceeds Slovakia of about 2%. These findings confirm that 
the index ¬´ I2010-P ¬ª complies with the two countries 
ranking in the other indexes measured in 2010. 
Regarding Italy and Spain rankings, we find that Spain 
moves from the 12th position to the 9th position winning 
three ranks and Italy goes from the 18th to the 13th position 
winning five ranks. Also, we gathered their respective 
rankings (in the panel of studied countries) in the other 
published indexes. Table I shows the ranking of the two 
countries following the four indexes under comparison:

Table I confirms that the index ¬´ I2010-P ¬ª complies 
with the two countries ranking in the other indexes 
measured in 2010. This allows us to estimate that the

ranking of Spain and Italy according to I2010-P is more 
accurate than their ranking in I2010-M. 
2) Second issue: The tighter spreads between the 
leading group countries 
The distance between the first and the fifth of the 
ranking frontrunners is tighter in I2010-P. Indeed, the gap 
decreases from 18 points in I2010-M (more than 20% of the 
leader index) to 9.5 points in I2010-P (~ 12% of the leader 
index). In comparison with the other indexes, this difference 
is about 8% in the "e-readiness Ranking 2010" and 15% in 
IDI. This allows us to confirm that I2010-P is more accurate 
than in I2010-M regarding this issue. 
The accuracy of I2010-P is clearer if we consider only 
Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and Germany. Indeed, the 
amplitudes of the indexes for these four countries are in 
Table II as follows:

9% 
8,1% 
11,6% 
This table shows that the amplitude of I2010-P is within 
the same range than those of EIU and IDI while the 
amplitude of I2010-M is more than two times the EIU one. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The lack of ICT indicators measures is hindering the e-
readiness (e-strategy) concept development (e-readiness is 
the first phase of the e-strategy process). ELM approach 
attempts to overcome this problem through a predictive 
system based on dynamic systems state models. This paper 
has attempted to assess the contribution of this approach by 
comparing an index calculated on the basis of 20 indicators 
measures and an index calculated on the basis of six basic 
indicators measures and the predictive model (used input 
tables for the ELM model are presented in the appendix 1). 
The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients of 
the results exceed 95%. This ensures that the two indexes 
are highly correlated. On the other hand, the graphics 
exploratory analysis revealed two main differences between 
the two compared indexes. The results comparison with 
other e-readiness indexes measured in 2010 showed a 
greater consistency for the index based on the predictive 
model. Thus, this test assumes the robustness of the 
predictive model based on the ELM while allowing a 
significant advantage through the reduction of indicators‚Äô 
measures need of 70% (from 20 to 6 indicators). 
However, it should be remembered that the predictive 
model requires the availability of the two previous periods‚Äô 
measurements. This leads us to conclude that the ELM 
approach can be very useful for initiatives that plan to last 
over time (annual rankings). Indeed, these initiatives can 
invest in exhaustive measures of the first two years and then 
use the ELM approach to decrease the need of indicators 
measurements. Also, the ELM can be used as a simulator to 
assist in the e-strategy fomulation (based on e-readiness 
diagnostic) through the prediction of the impact of planed 
actions on basic indicators. Indeed, the stakeholders can 
estimate the impact of their action plan before its validation. 
Finally, we find that the ELM approach is not specific to 
e-readiness and can be exploited in other sectors like human 
development where indicators definitions can change over 
time.
