Abstract— This study investigated how monetization of data in
a Big Data environment has been suggested in academic
literature. Our goal was to find out what methods have been
applied to determine the relevance and value of data in these
environments and if these methods are based, in any way, on
information theory. In order to come to a conclusion, we
applied a formal process of systematic literature review based
on the methodology suggested by Kitchenham. The results
showed that, in spite of the progress made on the topics of Big
Data and the application of analytical methodologies over the
last decades, there is no method based on data that is widely
used to determine the value of a datum in a Big Data
environment. By observing the results, it is possible to conclude
that little attention has been given to the dimension Value in
academic studies related to Big Data when compared to
searches directed to the other three classical dimensions
(Volume, Velocity and Variety). More specifically, in terms of
economic value, studies are even scarcer, and the existing ones
do not share a common view on how to measure this value. If,
on the one hand, monetization in Big Data environments is still
a field that needs to be better explored in academic literature,
on the other hand, these intangible assets, i.e., data, grow
exponentially and are more and more present in the corporate
world. It highlights the opportunity to develop studies in
search of standards that can be widely accepted and used to
this end.

I.
INTRODUCTION
In 1999, Mood and Walsh were the first to propose an
economic view directed to digital assets. In their view, data
represented the raw material, information systems (hardware
& software) would be the manufacturers and information
would be the finished product that would need to be priced
[1].
In this study, we sought to understand how monetization
in Big Data environments has been suggested in academic
literature. Originally defined by Gartner in 2001 as “high-
VARIETY data that are received at high VOLUME and at
increasingly higher VELOCITY” [2]. This definition came
to be known as the 3 Vs of Big Data. After this definition,
many others have proposed new Vs to be added to the
original definition [3]. At least two new Vs have been
accepted as part of this definition: namely Veracity and
Value [4]. The concept of each of these dimensions is
detailed below [5]:

Volume is the magnitude of large-scale datasets.
The variation in the size of large-scale data relies on
the structure and time of data, i.e., volume is the
size of distinct types of data acquired from distinct
data sources;

Velocity is the rate at which the data is received and
then refined for analytical purposes;

Variety is a distinct type of data representation such
as structured, semi-structured, and unstructured
data;

Veracity refers to the biases, noise, and abnormality
in data. Veracity issues arise due to the process
uncertainty
(randomness
in
process),
data
uncertainty (data input uncertainty), and model
uncertainty (approximate model);

Value is another dimension of big data in the
business perspective. Business organizations need
to notice the value of big data, to increase the profit
by minimizing the operational costs to provide
better services to the customers;
We will focus our searches on the dimension Value,
more specifically on the financial value that can be extracted
from a certain datum in a Big Data environment.
For reaching our goal, we sought to find out which
methods have been suggested or applied so as to determine
the
relevance
and
the
value
of
data
in
Big
Data
environments. Additionally, if these methods are based on
any kind of information theory, a mathematical theory,
originally proposed by Shannon in 1948 [6], studies the
quantification, storage and communication of information
and ways in which it is applied in different areas.
In order to conduct this research, we applied a formal
process of
systematic
literature
review based
on
the
methodology suggested by Kitchenham et al. [7]. This
process was set in motion by the definition of the problem
we want to solve and by the definition of the research
questions,
search
protocols,
selection,
extraction
and
syntheses of the primary studies related to the theme. The
process went on with the execution of previously defined
protocols in the search for answers.
The results showed that, despite the progress in the theme
of Big Data and improvements in the application of
analytical methodologies over the last decades, there is not
yet a method based on data that can be widely used to
determine the value of a certain datum in a Big Data
environment. According to the results we found, it is
possible to conclude that academic research has given very
little attention to the dimension Value, especially when
compared to the research done on the other three classical
dimensions (Volume, Velocity and Variety) [2]. More
specifically, when it comes to financial value, research is

even scarcer and the existing papers do not share a common
view on the most suitable way to measure it.
If on the one hand, monetization of data in a Big Data
environment is still a poorly explored field in academic
literature, on the other hand, these intangible assets, the data,
grow exponentially and are more and more present in the
corporate world. This fact highlights the opportunity to
develop studies in search of standards that can be widely
accepted and used to this end.
This article is structured as follows: in Section 2, we
explore the context that we have adopted in our study related
to the topic of Big Data; in Section 3, we provide details on
the protocols applied to the review; in Section 4, we present
the results; in Section 5, we present the conclusion and
suggest further future studies.
II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
After analyzing studies from different sectors and
applications
with
non-specified
contexts,
theories
and
designs, we use this section to contextualize both the
population and the intervention related to this study.
A. Big Data
In spite of having given a definition to the origin of the
term Big Data in the introduction, it is a fact that since its
advent it has been used in a number of academic studies and
commercial applications without a clear uniform meaning or
context.
In a 2016 review comprising over a thousand and five
hundred studies that mentioned the term “Big Data”, De
Mauro et al. [8] proposed the following definition that would
be able to bundle most of the assessed texts: “Big Data is the
information asset characterized by such a High Volume,
Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and
Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value”. This
definition is the one taken into consideration in our study
and what makes the theme of our review even more
relevant, once it highlights that the explicit objective of a
Big Data environment is to turn digital assets into value.
In our case, we searched for studies that proposed ways
in which financial value can be extracted from data in the
context herein.
B. The Value of Data as Digital Asset
“Many argue that Facebook did not “purchase” user
registrations, but user data and user-generated data are the
company’s core asset, which led to the largest technology
Initial Public Offering (IPO) in history” [1].
The debate on how “value” itself was formed has been
going on for millennia, since pre-Christian era, when
Aristotle argued that value is based on the need for
exchange (Aristotle, 350 BC). This concept is in the core of
economic adjustment and is the basis to define what will be
produced, how it will be produced and who will produce it.
Another key discussion in economic theory includes
questioning the reasons for a product or service to be priced
the way it is, that is, how the value of a product or service is
determined and how to calculate it correctly.
The theory was formulated and applied in a world where
products and services were in their entirety represented by
physical
assets
with
well-defined
characteristics:
raw
material,
finished
products
and
services
provided
by
physical living beings (humans and animals).
The advent of computers brought the world a new
category of assets, digital ones, represented in a discrete
numerical
way
and
used
in
digital
devices
with
computational processing. These digital assets are capable
of delivering a new category of products and services: better
decisions, increased performance, competitive advantages
and they can even be sold directly as a product. It is in this
context of “data” as a digital asset and as a product itself
that we will study the ways of monetization that have been
proposed.
III.
METHODS
The formal process of systematic literature review
applied in this study was based on the methodology
suggested by Kitchenham et al. [7]. Six steps composed our
methodology:
(1)
development
of
the
protocol,
(2)
identification of the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, (3)
search for relevant studies, (4) data extraction, and (5)
synthesis.
This review focuses on identifying primary studies that
approached techniques that proposed ways for monetizing
new data in a Big Data environment. Bearing this goal in
mind, the next step was the definition of the problem that
would guide the search for primary studies.
According to Eron Kelly, “In the next five years, we'll
generate more data as humankind than we generated in the
previous 5,000 years” [9]. In this setting, we have defined
the problem:
●
How can we monetize new data generated and
available
in
the
Market
in
a
Big
Data
environment?
Our research questions are presented below. The aim is
to discover methods either in use or suggested to determine
both relevance and value of the datum in Big Data
environments and to observe if any of them considers the
information theory in their formation.
A. Research Questions
RQ1. What methods have been suggested or applied to
determine the relevance of the datum?
RQ2. What methodologies have been applied to identify
the value of a datum?
RQ3. Does the methodology to identify the value use the
information theory in its formulation? How?
With the questions well defined, in the following sections
we move on to defining the protocols for search, selection,
extractions and detailed synthesis.
B. Search Protocol
We chose to perform an automatic selection that would
guarantee the feedback of the highest possible number of
articles that could answer our research questions. For such,
we started by defining the search string. Table I below shows
the search string we applied.

three
(3)
academic
bases
that
congregate relevant studies in the context of software
engineering and Big Data:

ACM Digital Library;

IEEE Xplore;

ScienceDirect – Elsevier;
In the process of extracting information from the selected
bases, the search strings were applied separately in each of
them. The searches were conducted between May and June,
2020. The studies were grouped and then examined in search
of duplicity. Table II shows the number of studies found in
each selected base.

Figure 1 presents the number of studies returned in the
search according to the year of publication. It is important to
point out that in spite of being a recent theme, as the first
studies date from 2012, it has gained increased attention by
the year.
Figure 1.
Studies grouped by year of publication.
We have observed a compound annual growth rate of
67% in the number of studies between 2012 and 2019. This
shows how this theme has become more and more relevant
and coherent with the increase in solutions and demands
based on data.
C. Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion
With well-defined string and bases, we focused our
selection of articles in the period between 2012 and 2019.
The starting point was 2012 for being the year where the first
articles related to the theme were published. 2019 was
chosen so as to guarantee the replicability of this study in
future research (2020 is still ongoing and new articles might
still arise for this period in future studies).
On
the
Criteria
for
Inclusion
and
Exclusion,
we
considered primary studies that would analyze ways of
monetizing
data, regardless of the context, sector or
application.
Criteria for Inclusion: Besides the period of publication,
we still defined as criteria for inclusion:

Primary studies published in English;

Studies that approach the theme of Big Data and
monetization of data;

Studies that answer at least one of the research
questions.
Criteria for Exclusion:

Academic or teaching-oriented articles;

Short articles, courses, tutorials and secondary and
tertiary studies (reviews);

Duplicated studies (in these cases, only one version
was considered).
D. Steps of the Selection
This section describes the selection process from the start
by using the strategies described below in order to identify
primary studies.
The first step was to obtain studies returned from the
search in the databases by using the Zotero [10] and Ryyan
platforms [11], both designed for managing publications and
supporting reviews. We used these tools to conduct the steps
listed below and in Figure 2 in the Results section, showing
the number of articles that were filtered through each step
until the final selection:
1. Elimination of duplicates and articles written in
another language;
2. Search for keywords related to the theme;
3. Reading of the title;
4. Reading of the abstract;
5. Reading of the Introduction and Conclusion, and;
6. Reading of the full article.
In steps 2-6 above, many articles were eliminated for not
mentioning ways of monetizing data in the Big Data context
either in the title, abstract or keywords, others were also
eliminated
from
the
reading
of
the
introduction
and
conclusion
for
clearly
not
approaching
the
research
questions. Finally, in the Reading of the full article step, an
additional number of studies were eliminated because, in
spite of approaching themes related to the subject of this
study, they did not present answers to the research questions.
Figure 2 shows the outcome of the execution of this
protocol in the Results section.

E. Extraction and Synthesis Protocol
We used a support form, from the Google Forms tool, to
extract the evidence that answered the research question.
This evidence was catalogued in a spreadsheet so it could be
used in the following synthesis step.
A thematic synthesis was defined to our review, once the
contexts, theories and designs of the selected articles do not
follow specific standards. This method of synthesis is
specially adjusted to these cases, once it allows to identify
(codify) and report patterns (themes) based on the data
extracted from primary qualitative studies [12].
IV.
RESULTS
A. Conducting Search and Selection
The search was performed according to the protocol
defined in the previous step and the results are presented in
Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Results of the search and selection process.
A total of 2199 related studies were found in our search
string for the defined period and, after the application of the
inclusion and exclusion criteria and the steps for selection
defined in our protocol, we were left with 19 primary studies
to be dealt with in the following extraction and synthesis
stages.
Table III presents the number of studies retrieved from
each database. It is curious to observe that most of the
studies where we found answers to our research questions
came from the base that returned the fewest articles in our
initial search. In general, at the end of the selection process,
only a few studies approached our problem when compared
to the original total of results at the beginning. Answers were
found in less than 1% of the studies returned from the initial
search.

B. Conduction the Extraction and Synthesis processes
We move on with the conduction of our protocol, now to
the extraction and synthesis steps.
Each of the excerpts extracted from the 19 selected
articles was codified for a future more detailed synthesis of
the theme, according to the thematic synthesis methodology
suggested by Cruzes and Dyba [12]. It starts with the
identification of keywords in the extracted texts, followed by
a process of codification of these texts into higher concepts
and, at last, a definition of themes, grouping one or more of
the generated codes. In Figure 3, we present the process we
applied.

DATA ANALYTICS 2020 : The Ninth International Conference on Data Analytics

We have found eight studies with answers to one of our
questions and in ten other papers we found answers to two of
our questions. Only one of the papers was able to answer our
three research questions.
C. Answers to the Research Questions
This section approaches a detailed discussion on the
results of the systematic review. The subsections provide
answers to RQ1 - RQ3 research questions.
After the analysis and extraction steps have been done in
primary studies, we were able to identify some aspects
related to monetization of data in a Big Data environment
based on these studies. The first conclusion is that the theme
of monetization of data in a Big Data context is still a recent
theme, as two thirds of the answers were found in studies
published in the last 3 years. The second conclusion is that
few theories and models were developed aiming to approach
the theme of this research, once we were left with only 19
studies that were able to answer the research questions.
Finally, among the few papers that proposed theories and
models to meet the theme of this research, we have not been
able to find a model or method that could be considered a
standard.
It was surprising to find out that in order to valuate a
datum in a Big Data context, techniques based on data are
not the most commonly applied. This may sound like a
contradiction at first, but it can also be interpreted according
to the market law (supply x demand) even in these contexts.
Another hypothesis to justify this observation would be
the natural stillness of concepts (inertia), usually applied to
physical assets, with characteristics of scarcity, in an
approach that would seem more natural in the context of
digital assets (using data-based techniques in order to price
data).
In this section, we summarize the answers to each of the
research questions.
1)
RQ1: What methods have been suggested or applied
to determine the relevance of the datum?(14 answers)
a) In
this
review,
the
most
applied
methods
to
determine the relevance of data were the analytical
techniques (50% of the findings, 7 cases);
b) Methods that evaluated the relevance of data in a
business context were found in 29% of the cases (4 cases);
c) In 2 of the cases (14%) there were methods based in
intrinsic characteristics on the data (kinds of data, volume,
velocity, etc.);
d) Finally, in 1 of the articles, the use of the datum was
applied as a method to determine the relevance of the datum
(defined as the number of hits or references to a certain
piece of information).
Even among the most used methods, it was not possible
to find uniformity, for instance, in the case of the use of
analytical techniques to determine the relevance of a datum,
where many distinct techniques were applied without the
predominance of a specific one.
2)
RQ2: What methodologies have been applied to
identify the value of a datum? (14 answers)
Table V summarizes the answers to this research
question.
TABLE V.

USE OF THE DATUM (USE/HITS)
14.29%
BOOK VALUE
14.29%
RISK X RETURN
7.14%
INFORMATION THEORY
7.14%
In a simplified way, we have found that the supply x
demand market law was the most common reference to
determine the value of new data in a Big Data context,
followed by analytical techniques (also highlighted in the
previous question). Next in line, there were the methods
based on the use of data, book value and, finally, a case was
based on the price of risk x return and the other based on
information theory.
3)
Does the methodology to identify the value use the
information theory in its formulation? How?
Although in only one of the cases the Information Theory
has been used as a method to determine the value of new
data, four other studies have referenced this theory in their
considerations. Two studies cite entropy as a factor that is
directly linked to pricing new data and two others refer to the
exchange of information as a trigger to generate value, that
is, no exchange, no value.
Many of the studies that proposed methods for valuating
a datum considered that, despite the proliferation of the
theme of Big Data, research to determine value in this
context is still recent in academic literature.
V.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
As we finished the proposed systematic literature review
process, in search for answers on how to monetize data in a
Big Data context, the first conclusion was that the theme of
monetization of data in this context is still recent in academic
literature. The first studies that answered our questions in the
researched bases dated from 2013 (2 studies) and 75% of the
answers we found dated from 2017 on. Another conclusion
is that very few theories and models were developed with the
specific aim of approaching this theme, since out of 2199
studies in our initial search we ended up with only 19 that
were able to address our research questions. In sum, it was
possible to observe that less than one percent of the studies
answered at least one of our questions. Finally, even among
the few papers that proposed theories and models to answer
the research questions, we could not find a pattern or method
that would be considered a standard or even a most applied
one.
The results showed that, despite the progress in the theme
of
Big
Data
and
in
the
application
of
analytical
methodologies over the last decades, there is not yet widely
58

DATA ANALYTICS 2020 : The Ninth International Conference on Data Analytics

used data-based method to determine the value of a datum as
a digital asset. Based on the studies we found, it is possible
to conclude that very little attention has been given to the
dimension Value in academic research when compared to the
three classical dimensions (Volume, Velocity and Variety) of
the original definition of Big Data. Research is even more
scarce in terms of financial value, and the existing studies do
not share a common view on the right way of measuring and
defining this value.
The most surprising finding was the fact that, in order to
valuate a datum in the context of Big Data, techniques based
on data are not the most commonly applied. This may sound
like a contradiction at first, but it can also be interpreted by
the market law (supply x demand) even in contexts or by the
natural stillness necessary to a change of approach that
seems to be inevitable when considering the characteristics
of digital assets.
If on the one hand monetization of data in Big Data
environments is a poorly explored field in academic
literature, these intangible assets grow exponentially and
they are more and more present in the corporate world,
which highlights the opportunity to develop research to find
standards that can be widely accepted and used to this end.
With future studies, we will delve deeper in the theme in
search of models and standards for pricing data-based digital
assets (analytical techniques).
We can consider as threats to the validity of this research
the fact that we have not done manual search for articles and
did not include commercial white papers in the scope. The
main reason is that it was a first approach to the problem and
our intention was to review the theme in academic literature
in an automatic manner. Future works will also consider
these additional steps.
