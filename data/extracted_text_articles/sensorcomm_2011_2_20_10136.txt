Abstract—Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been of
high interest during the past couple of years. One of the most
challenging tasks of WSN research is still location estimation.
As a well performing ﬁne grained localization approach,
Distributed Least Squares (DLS) was introduced, splitting the
costly localization process in a complex precalculation and
a simple postcalculation, which is performed on constrained
sensor nodes. Nevertheless, as size of precalculation and conse-
quently, cost of computation and communication are growing
with network size, it was shown that this algorithm is unsuitable
for large WSNs. This restriction has been overcome by scalable
DLS (sDLS), which enables to use the idea of DLS in large
WSNs for the ﬁrst time. Although cost of computation of sDLS
is independent of the network size, it was relatively high, due
to costly matrix updates. Consequently, this cost was reduced
by sDLS with normal equation (sDLSne), circumventing the
updates. Unfortunately, sDLSne comes along with a decreased
localization accuracy. The approach, presented in this work,
combines the efﬁcient sDLSne approach with various coarse
grained localization techniques to improve localization accu-
racy. The resulting localization accuracy overcomes the efﬁcient
sDLSne approach as well as the more precise sDLS approach,
while cost of computation still outperforms sDLS.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent technological advances enabled development of
tiny wireless devices, which are able to sense their envi-
ronment, compute simple tasks and exchange data among
each other. Interconnected assemblies of such devices, called
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), are commonly used
to observe large inaccessible areas. In many applications
of WSN, knowledge of nodes’ locations is mandatory for
a meaningful interpretation of measured data. In addition,
location-awareness is also necessary for geographic rout-
ing [1][2] or location based clustering [3]. Due to existing
limitations in terms of size, ﬁnancial cost and energy con-
sumption, local positioning within the network is preferred
over utilizing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs)
like GPS [4]. Therefore, the presence of location-aware
sensor nodes, referred to as beacon nodes, is typically
assumed. The remaining nodes, which we refer to as blind
nodes, are assumed to use communication and any kind of
distance estimation or neighborhood information to estimate
their positions with the help of beacon nodes.
Localization algorithms can be divided into centralized
and decentralized on the one hand, and ﬁne-grained and
coarse-grained on the other hand. Coarse-grained approaches
like Centroid Localization (CL) [5], Weighted Centroid
Localization (WCL) [6] and Adaptive Weighted Centroid
Localization (AWCL) [7] often abstain from exact dis-
tances, require less communication and computation, and
provide lower precision estimates. In contrast, ﬁne-grained
approaches use costly computations and distance estimations
to achieve localization with high precision. High precision
and low complexity have been ﬁrstly combined by Dis-
tributed Least Squares (DLS) [8], which splits the costly
localization calculation into precalculation and postcalcula-
tion. Independent from a speciﬁc blind node, the complex
precalculation is performed on a high performance sink. The
remaining postcalculation is less complex and performed on
resource-constrained blind nodes.
The concept of DLS has been adapted by scalable DLS
(sDLS) [9], which enables the idea of DLS to be used in
large WSNs. In contrast to DLS, sDLS provides costs of
computation and communication, incurred on blind nodes,
which are independent from network size, i.e., independent
from total number of beacon nodes. This is achieved by use
of individual precalculations instead of one global precalcu-
lation. A fundamental enhancement is given by sDLS with
normal equation (sDLSne) [10], which signiﬁcantly reduces
the cost of computation by circumventing costly updates,
introduced with sDLS.
Using sDLS, blind nodes are assumed to choose one
precalculation out of several precalculations provided by
neighbouring beacon nodes, according to their distances.
Commonly, the set of beacon nodes included in the chosen
precalculation differs from the set of beacon nodes within a
blind node’s communication range. This causes a suboptimal
localization accuracy and offers possibilities for further
improvements. The present work combines multiple posi-
tion estimates, based on sDLSne, by use of coarse grained
localization techniques, to improve localization accuracy.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II covers basic informations about sDLS algorithms. In
Section III, the new hybrid localization approach is presented
in various variants, using several optimizing parameters.

are presented in Section V. Finally, the presented work is
summarized in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
The DLS algorithm was developed to diminish trade off
between precision and cost of localization [8]. It provides
localization with high precision at low cost. The basic idea
of splitting the calculation into precalculation and postcal-
culation was adapted by sDLS and its successor sDLSne to
support large WSNs with network size independent cost for
blind nodes. Both approaches are brieﬂy described in this
section.
The system of equations, which have to be solved for
localization of a blind node is originally built by distance
equations as given in equation (1).
(x−xi)2+(y−yi)2 = r2
i
(i ∈ I; I = {1, 2, . . . , m}) (1)
Here x and y give the unknown position of a blind node.
The known position of a beacon node is denoted as xi and
yi, while the distance between both nodes is denoted as ri.
The number of beacon nodes utilizable for localization is
given as m.
This system of equations is linearized by use of a lin-
earization tool [11], using one beacon node as linearizer,
denoted with index L. After restructuring, the system of
equations consists of equations as given in equation (2),
where rL denotes the distance between blind node and
linearizer, ri is the distance between blind node and beacon
node, and diL denotes the distance between linearizer and
beacon node.

After further restructions, the system of equations matches
the matrix form Ax = b, using A, x and B as given in
equation (3).

Here, the beacon nodes, used for localization, are denoted
with indices K = {k1, k2, . . . , kn} with K = {I ∖ L}. Ma-
trix A of equation (3) only consists of beacon position
data, while b contains distances between beacon nodes and
blind nodes. Therefore, calculations on matrix A are to
be performed as part of the precalculation at a powerful
sink outside the WSN. The localization will be ﬁnalized on
each blind node by performing the remaining part of the
calculation.
To solve the linear system of equations, using normal
equations, equations (4a) to (4c) are used. While (4a)
shows the entire equation, (4b) presents the precalculation,
performed on the sink, and (4c) presents the postcalculation,
performed on blind nodes.
x =

includes most of the beacon nodes within the blind node’s
communication range. Nevertheless, in most cases some
beacon nodes included in this precalculation are outside
the communication range of the blind node and vice versa.
While sDLS locally updates this precalculation, by use
of matrix updates, to achieve the initial intention, sDLSne
estimates the unknown position with this unprecise precal-
culation.
Due to this displaced set of beacon nodes as well as the
high inﬂuence of the node geometry, especially the given
choice of the linearizing beacon node, the resulting position
estimation tends to be drawn in the direction of this beacon
node. In addition, the used distance estimation also causes
an impairement of the position estimation. Furthermore, a
defective distance estimation may cause the blind node to
spuriously choose a precalculation of a beacon node, which
is not the closest.
The aim of Hybrid Distributed Least Squares (HDLS)
is to use multiple precalculations of nearby beacon nodes.
The resulting position estimates, according to each chosen
precalculation, serve as tentative results. These results can
be seen as virtual beacon nodes. They will be combined to
a ﬁnal position estimate using coarse grained localization
techniques. For that aim, various approaches have been
studied in this work. The used coarse grained localization
approach presents only one factor, that inﬂuences the result-
ing accuracy. The following factors, studied in our work, are
to be further explained in this section:

A. Virtual Beacon Strategy
To control the number of virtual beacon nodes that are to
be created using sDLSne, the following strategies have been
investigated:
Closest Two
– Virtual beacon nodes are created from pre-
calculations of the two closest beacon nodes.
Closest Three
– Virtual beacon nodes are created from
precalculations of the three closest beacon nodes.
Great Deal
– Virtual beacon nodes are to be created, using
precalculations of all beacon nodes in range.
Range Based
– Beacon nodes in a range, given as a multi-
ple of the distance to the closest beacon node, are used for
creation of virtual beacon nodes. This strategy extends the
before mentioned strategies, which serve as upper bound.
Within our investigations, this range has been varied from
125% up to 250% of the closest beacon node.
B. Coarse Grained Estimation Technique
Created virtual beacon nodes are combined to a resulting
position estimation Pb using coarse grained localization
techniques. The following techniques have been studied:
CL –
The plain Centroid Localization (CL) approach is
used to combine the virtual beacon nodes, i.e., unweighted
arithmetic mean is used as given in equation (5). Here, V
indicates a set of given virtual beacon nodes and P indicates
a position.

presented subsequently. Common weights rely on measured
distances or received signal strength (RSS).

AWCL –
Virtual beacon nodes are combined by use of
Adaptive Weighted Centroid Localization (AWCL). While
WCL simply gives more inﬂuence to closer beacon nodes,
i.e., beacon nodes with higher weight, the idea of AWCL is
to give more inﬂuence to the difference of given weights.
Therefore, if the weights, e.g., RSS, of beacon nodes
in range are similar to each other, they are to be re-
duced by a reduction part q of the smallest weight, with
{q ∈ R|0 ≤ q ≤ 1}, as illustrated in Figure 2. Otherwise,
i.e., in case of high differences within the weights, AWCL
inherently acts as WCL.

C. Weightage
Except from the plain CL algorithm, the presented coarse
grained estimation techniques are utilizing weighting factors.
The aim of weights is to give higher inﬂuence to more
important (virtual) beacon nodes. In the given case a pre-
calculation is deﬁned as more important, if the accordant
beacon node and therefore the linearizer is closer to the blind
node. In the same way, it is more important if the number
of beacon nodes included in the precalculation and in the
blind node’s communication range is high. Consequently the
following weights have been studied:
Signal Strength
– Virtual beacon nodes are weighted ac-
cording to the RSS of the beacon node that provided the
precalculation used to create the virtual beacon node. On
average, the RSS is expected to be higher the closer the
beacon node is. Although, variations of shadowing and fad-
ing may compromise this relation, it has been investigated as
possible weightage. Equation (8) illustrates this weight, with
i indicating the linearizer of the according precalculation as
well as the resulting virtual beacon node.
wi = RSSi
(8)
Similarity
– Virtual beacon nodes are weighted according
to the rate of beacon nodes, included in precalculation, that
are located within the communiction range of the blind node.
This weight is given in equation (9), where Pi indicates the
set of beacon nodes included in the precalculation of beacon
node i and B indicates the set of beacon nodes within the
communication range of the blind node. This is applied to
the WCL approach, which is then called Similarity based
WCL (SWCL).
wi = |Pi ∩ B|
|Pi|
(9)
D. Reduction part
AWCL has been shown as more accurate than the original
WCL. In advance of an included WCL estimation AWCL
reduces all given weights by a certain portion of minimum
weight, as given in equation (7). This leads to the behavior
that in case of nearby weights the remaining small differ-
ences get more importance. For our investigations, the used
reduction part q has been varied from 15% to 65%.
E. Distance approximation
To enable a blind node to use beacon nodes outside its
own communication range, sDLSne introduced a distance
approximation, given in Figure 3, that utilizes the given dis-
tance between linearizer and inaccessible beacon node (diL),
and the estimated distance between blind node and linearizer
(rL), which was assumed to be as close as possible, due to
the prior choice of the blind node. The sum of both distances
is used as approximation of the unknown distance ri.
Now, using not only the closest beacon node, but up
to all beacon nodes within the communication range, this
Figure 3. Approximation of a distance between blind node and inaccessible
beacon node i by means of the linearizing beacon node L
approximation tends to be more and more inaccurate. There-
fore, two variants of this distance approximation have been
investigated.
Independent Approximation
– For each precalculation dis-
tances to inaccessible beacon nodes are estimated as given
in Figure 3. All data used is either directly estimated by use
of measurements or provided by the precalculation itself.
Dependent Approximation
–
Most
inaccessible
beacon
nodes are included in multiple precalculations, provided to
the blind node. As illustrated in Figure 4, distance approx-
imations towards such an inaccessible beacon node will
differ according to the used precalculation, due to different
linearizer nodes used in different precalculations.

Two approximation strategies: To estimate distances of inac-
cessible beacon nodes, included in a precalculation, either (a) the beacon
node, providing the precalculation or (b) the closest beacon node is used.
To provide the most precise distance estimation the shortest
distance, which can be estimated from the given precalcu-
lations, have to be selected for calculation of virtual beacon
nodes.
To achieve this, one possibility is to ﬁrstly determine all
possible estimates for inaccessible beacon nodes, i.e., one for
each precalculation, which includes the inaccessible node, to
subsequently calculate the minimum distance estimations. In
most cases a more efﬁcient solution can be applied. Figure 5
illustrates such a solution compared along with independent
approximation in the context of the over all position estima-
tion, given on the right hand side. The illustrated approach

processes precalculations individually but in ascending order
of their distances towards the blind node, as illustrated on
the right side. For this purpose, the distance between blind
node and linearizer acts as the distance towards its according
precalculation. Once a distance towards an inaccessible bea-
con node has been approximated by a close precalculation,
this distance will be marked as known, as illustrated in the
last but one box on the left side of Figure 5. If the same
beacon node occurs in a further precalculation, the before
calculated distance will be taken and the beacon node will
be not treated as inaccessible.
Figure 4 illustrates the presented strategies by giving
a worst case example for both approaches. Using inde-
pendent approximation for the precalculation illustrated in
Figure 4(a) highly overrates the distance towards the inac-
cessible beacon node. By use of dependent approximation
instead, the better approximation provided by a closer pre-
calculation illustrated in Figure 4(b) would be used.
IV. SIMULATIONS
To verify performance of the introduced HDLS ap-
proaches, the MATLAB R
⃝ based network simulator Rmase
is used [12]. The simulator provides a realistic radio commu-
nication model including spatial and temporal normal dis-
tributed fading. A static bidirectional spanning-tree routing
was used to send data packets from nodes to sink and vice
versa. Distance estimations performed by blind nodes rely
on the simulators radio model.
A random deployment of n2 nodes within a ﬁeld of n∗n
arbitrary distance units (adus) was utilized. The ﬁrst node
was always used as sink, while the remaining nodes have
been randomly chosen as blind nodes (50%) or beacon nodes
(50%). Note that the low number of blind nodes has been
proofed to has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the presented
results but speeds up the simulation dramatically. The ﬁeld
size parameter n was varied from 5 to 30. The average
communication range, given by the radio model, was 3 adus.
For each ﬁeld size the average over 100 simulations has
been determined. In each simulated network all presented
localization approaches have been performed concurrently.
V. RESULTS
As described in Section III, there are various factors,
inﬂuencing the accuracy of HDLS. To distinguish between
the different approaches, resulting from these factors, a
naming scheme is used, illustrated as syntax diagram in
Figure 6. This diagram also shows the more than 350
combinations, which have been investigated by simulations.
In Figure 6, ”S” symbols similarity based weightage, applied
to WCL. Reduction part of AWCL have been varied from
15% to 65%. Range based strategy, indicated with an ”R”,
also denotes a percentage of the distance towards the closest
beacon node, which limits the catchment area of further
beacon nodes. It is used in addition to the ﬁxed upper bound
of virtual beacon nodes.

Syntax diagram: Naming of investigated HDLS approaches
First, used coarse grained techniques are analysed along
with different virtual beacon strategies, i.e., the number of
virtual beacon nodes. Figure 7 shows mean localization
error over the number of deployed nodes, using the basic
CL approach. It is illustrated, that the hybrid approaches
perform signiﬁcantly better than the underlying sDLSne,
but in most cases not as accurate as the original sDLS
approach with costly matrix updates. Furthermore, it is
shown that the hybrid approach with two virtual beacon
nodes is outperformed by the one, using three virtual beacon
nodes. In contrast, using as much virtual beacon nodes as
possible does not further increase localization accuracy.
Similar results have been found for HDLS based on WCL
with traditional RSS based weighting, shown in Figure 8. It
is shown that this approach performs the better, the more
virtual beacon nodes are used. Futhermore, it outperformes

In Section III, SWCL has been introduced as an alternative
approach of WCL, using similarity instead of signal strength.
Both WCL based approaches are compared in Figure 9. On
the one hand, the illustration shows that similar to the CL
based approach, the SWCL approach performs best, when
three virtual beacon nodes are used. On the other hand, it is
shown that this approach is outperformed by the RSS based
approach.

The third coarse grained technique, investigated to use
with HDLS, is AWCL. The performance of AWCL depends
on a reduction part, deﬁned by AWCL. The best reduction
part is said to be 55%. Therefore, this factor is also used
for the results, given in Figure 10. The presented results
show, that this approach also outperforms the costly sDLS
approach and performs the better the more virtual beacon
nodes are used. Further investigations, using different reduc-
tion factors showed that also in the given context a reduction
factor of 55% performs best in most cases. Nevertheless,
achieved accuracy is often inﬂuenced only marginal by the
reduction factor.

As an intermediate result HDLS provides best accuracy,
using as much virtual beacon nodes as possible, combined
by AWCL with a reduction part of 55%. While the previous
results used virtual beacon strategies with a ﬁxed number
of virtual beacon nodes, the following results investigate
the range based virtual beacon strategy. The range within
precalculations of beacon nodes are used to create virtual
beacon nodes was varied from 125% to 250% of the distance
between blind node and closest beacon node. The range
based approach is combined with a ﬁxed upper bound as
presented before. Figure 11 shows the resulting localization
accuracy for CL based HDLS, using various ranges and an
upper bound of two, i.e., HDLS falls back into sDLSne,
if the closest beacon node is signiﬁcantly closer than all
other beacon nodes. On the one hand, it is shown, that even
a small range of 125% outperforms sDLSne. On the other
hand, the graph shows, that only in few cases, this spatial
limit outperforms the unlimited version. It also shows that
in most cases a spatial limitation of 175% performs very
close to the unlimited counterpart. Similar results have been
found for the use of WCL, SWCL or AWCL.
As AWCL turned out as the most promising approach, it
is selected to compare the range based strategy with various
upper limits of virtual beacon nodes. Figure 12 shows
the results for the previously introduced upper bounds in
combiniation with the spatial limits of 125% and 250%. On
the one hand, the results show that the range based strategy

Mean localization error of CL based HDLS with independent

also works for limits higher than two. On the other hand,
it is shown that the higher the spatial limit, the lower the
mean localization error. Although the unlimited approaches
perform better than the corresponding limited approaches, it
comes out that a spatial limit of 250% achieves good results.

have been ﬁgured out, which are equivalent to numerous
limits. As illustrated in Figure 13, a spatial range of 150%
can be put on a level with the upper bound of two virtual
beacon nodes. A spatial limit of 200% instead can be equated
with the strategy of using 3 virtual beacon nodes. Once
again, as much beacon nodes as available is proved to
provide lowest localization error. Nevertheless, a spatial limit
of 250% provides also good results.
Using a spatial limitation instead of a ﬁxed number of
virtual beacon nodes can be only seen as alternative, if it
is more cost efﬁcient. Therefore, the number of arithmetic
operations, used for the according localization approach,
has been investigated. Figure 14 illustrates this cost for the
HDLS approaches, presented in Figure 13. It clearly comes
out that the two range based approaches, which have been
pointed out as equivalents need slightly more computations
than the corresponding approaches.

Range based equivalents of AWCL based HDLS approaches

Up to this point, the presented results are based on
independent approximation of distances towards inaccessible
beacon nodes. The remaining part of this section presents
the results, achieved by use of dependet approximation.
As shown in Figure 15, use of this approximation signif-
icantly improves localization accuracy of CL based HDLS.
It outperforms sDLS as well as the best CL approach
with independent approximation, even if only two virtual
beacon nodes are used. It is also shown that there is only
a small gain, which distinguishes the all beacon strategy
from the three beacon strategy. Similar results have been
found using WCL, SWCL and AWCL. In all cases, each
approach using dependent distance approximation outper-
forms the according HDLS approach based on independent
distance approximation, using as much virtual beacon nodes
as possible.
To sum up the before mentioned results and to ﬁgure out
the best HDLS approach for each coarse grained technique
the best performing approach is presented in Figure 16.
Noticeable, but not surprising, best results are achieved
using as much virtual beacons as possible. Furthermore,
Figure 16 shows impressively that use of dependent distance
approximation outperforms independent distance approxi-
mation. Using dependent approximation, the AWCL based
approach performs best closely followed by WCL. The same

Figure 17.
Mean localization error of best performing HDLS approaches
for different limits of virtual beacon nodes
order is depicted for independent distance approximation.
Furthermore, it is shown, that range based virtual beacon
strategy is useful in combination with CL and SWCL. In all
cases a high spatial limit is used.
Due to the obviously strong impact of the number of
virtual beacon nodes, same analyses have been performed,
taking only results with an upper limit of three or two
virtual beacon nodes into account, respectively. In both
cases dependent distance approximation outperforms inde-
pendent distance approximation. Also the internal order of
the presented approaches is similar to the one presented in
Figure 16. For each upper limit of virtual beacon nodes
the best HDLS approach is presented in Figure 17. As it
is illustrated, two times AWCL based approaches provide
best results, while in the third case WCL performs best. All
given HDLS approaches perform better than original sDLS
with costly update operations. Even though, using as much
virtual beacon nodes as possible results in highest accuracy,
high accuracy can be also achieved using two or three virtual
beacon nodes.
The achieved improvements in localization accuracy are
mainly caused by an increased number of beacon nodes,
used for localization. Due to the fact, that different virtual
beacons, based on different precalculations, use different
sets of beacon nodes, cardinality of resulting unions is
commonly higher than cardinality of the individual sets.
Since the number of used beacon nodes only depends on
the applied virtual beacon strategy, Figure 18 exemplarly
shows the number of used beacon nodes for the best cases,
presented in Figure 17. It is shown, that using two virtual
beacon nodes increases the number of beacon nodes used by
about 40% compared to sDLSne. Using three virtual beacon
nodes leads to an increase of about 67%, while using as
much virtual beacon nodes as possible leads to an increase
of 245% beacon nodes.

Mean number of used beacon nodes of best performing HDLS
approaches for different limits of virtual beacon nodes
As a matter of course, using more beacon nodes, increas-
ing localization accuracy, comes along with increased cost
by means of computation. The mean number of operations,
performed on each blind node, to perform one localization
is given in Figure 19. The number of operations is mainly
determined by the number of virtual beacon nodes or the
number of individual precalculations, respectively. The most
important result is that all presented approaches need less
computations than the original sDLS with matrix updates,
while all of these approaches, given in Figure 19, provide
higher accuracy than sDLS. The additional cost for each
additional virtual beacon node is about 80% of the cost of
sDLSne.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this work, the efﬁcient localization approach sDLSne
has been combined with various coarse grained approache

Mean number of operations of best performing HDLS
approaches for different limits of virtual beacon nodes
to improve accuracy of localization. As shown in Figures 8,
10, 15, and 17, the new HDLS approach provides higher
accuracy than sDLSne and even outperforms the initial sDLS
approach. Using the newly introduced dependent distance
approximation, even use of only two virtual beacon nodes,
i.e., two precalculations, dramatically increases localization
accuracy. Although HDLS needs more computations than
sDLSne, it needs much less computations than sDLS. It
further provides the possibility to chose between various
variants with different cost. Using a small range, the pre-
sented range based virtual beacon strategy provides an very
cost efﬁcient way to improve sDLSne.
