Abstract—In this paper, we propose an analytical Markovian
model to compute the performance of a network composed by
four radios in a line wireless multihop conﬁguration, with data in
only one way, considering four operation modes, with half duplex
and full duplex communications and omnidirectional and direc-
tional antennas. This kind of network was previously presented
in the literature, but its performance has been analyzed only
based on simulation. We use the proposed Markovian model to
compute the performance of the system considering that no buffer
is available on the servers, based on the following performance
metrics: throughput, capacity, block probability, drop probability,
and the average number of packets in the network. We showed
that in a system without buffer the performance of half duplex
operation can be better than the performance of full duplex
operation in terms of capacity and throughput.
Keywords–5G; full duplex communications; performance anal-
ysis; Markovian models.

INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of trafﬁc demand in mobile com-
munication networks, the future ﬁfth generation (5G) mobile
network is facing considerable challenges in spectral efﬁciency.
5G is expected to provide 1000-fold throughput of today’s 4G
[1].
To deal with it, several techniques have been recently
developed. Among them, In-Band Full Duplex (IBFD) com-
munications, which enable a device to transmit and receive
simultaneously at the same frequency, can potentially double
the spectral efﬁciency [1]. Until very recently, the concept of
transmission and reception at the same time and frequency
domain IBFD did not seem to be very promising, because of
the Self-Interference (SI), which is generated by the transmitter
on its own receiver [2]. Fortunately, with the recent advances in
interference cancellation techniques [3]–[7], SI can be reduced
to acceptable levels.
In order to perform IBFD, a new radio design has been
developed. The new radio design differs mostly in the way the
SI cancellation is implemented, and also in the number and
types of antennas. For example, [8] proposed a radio design
with two omnidirectional antennas and [9] proposed a radio
design with two directional antennas and one omnidirectional
antenna. In [9], Miura and Bandai analyzed the performance
of the proposed scheme based only on simulation.
In this paper, we propose a ﬁrst approximate Markovian
analytical model to investigate the performance of the system
proposed in [9], considering the same line wireless multihop
network with data in only one way.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the considered radio design and the network. Sec-
tion III presents the proposed Markovian model of the network.
Section IV derives the performance metrics of interest. Section
V presents the numerical results. Finally, the paper concludes
in Section VI.
II.
NETWORK SCENARIO AND ASSUMPTIONS
We use the proposed network shown in Figure 1, repro-
duced from [9], to evaluate the radio design in a multihop
network. In this network, each node can communicate with its
neighbor node and can not do carrier sense from two separated
nodes, such as Node S and Node 2 in the ﬁgure.
Half duplex nodes cannot transmit and receive simultane-
ously, while full duplex nodes can.
Omnidirectional antennas transmissions interfere with the
anterior neighbor node; for example, Node 2 transmission
interferes with Node 1 reception. In this case, only one
operation is allowed for a successful transmission. Directional
antennas do not have this problem.
We deﬁned the following representations of the transmis-
sion possibilities, called operation modes:
•
A[Half,Omni]: representation of a conventional node
using one omnidirectional antenna to transmit and
receive in a half duplex mode.
•
B[Full,Omni]: representation of an IBFD node using
two omnidirectional antennas, one to transmit and one
to receive, as proposed in [8].
•
D[Full,Direc]: representation of an IBFD node using
two directional Transmission Antennas (TX), TX1 to
transmit from 0 to π and TX2 from π to 2π, and one
omnidirectional Reception Antenna (RX). TX1 and
TX2 cannot be used simultaneously. Therefore, the
node can operate in two modes: TX1-RX and TX2-
RX. This mode was proposed in [9].
•
C[Half,Direc]: representation of the same radio design
as proposed in D[Full,Direc], but operating in a half
duplex mode.
In Figure 1, we have the transmission processes in the
network for each operation mode. The network operation

Figure 1. Transmission process for each operation mode [9].
depends on the type of nodes that it uses, so each network
operates differently according to the type of nodes used.
The representation shows how each network should operate
in order to achieve the maximum end-to-end throughput.
Figure 1 Mode A[Half,Omni]. In this mode, a transmission
from S to D needs three steps to be completed: (i) transmission
from S to 1; (ii) transmission from 1 to 2; and (iii) transmission
from 2 to D. This is necessary to obtain the maximum end-to-
end throughput, because only one node can transmit at a time
to avoid interferences since they are not full duplex capable.
Figure 1 Mode B[Full,Omni]. In this case, nodes S and 1
can transmit simultaneously. However, the full duplex opera-
tion in node 2 can not be used, because a transmission from
node 2 will interfere with the reception of node 1. Thus, in
order to obtain the maximum throughput, the pattern (i) and
(ii) must be repeated.
Figure 1 Mode C[Half,Direc]. Here, node 2 can transmit
simultaneously with node S. However, node 1 can not transmit
and receive at the same time, because of the half duplex
operation. Thus, in order to obtain the maximum throughput,
the pattern (i) and (ii) must be repeated.
Finally, Figure 1 Mode D[Full,Direc]. Here, nodes S, 1 and
2 can transmit simultaneously, due to the full duplex operation
and the use of directional antennas.
For each one of these four operation modes, [9] has com-
puted the maximum throughput and, based only on simulation,
the throughput and the number of retransmissions as a function
of the number of nodes.
The main contribution of this paper is to propose a
Markovian model to investigate the performance of the system
proposed in [9] in terms of throughput and other performance
metrics.
III.
MARKOVIAN MODEL
In this section, multidimensional Continuous-Time Marko-
vian Chains (CTMCs) are used to model the system, one for
each operation mode. The network consist of 4 nodes and three
hops. The last node is the destination, so it does not transmit.
Figure 2 shows the state diagram for mode A[Half, Omni].
The same approach is applied to the other modes in order to
compute the desired performance metrics.
Figure 2. Mode A[Half,Omni] State Diagram.
The transitions in the Markovian model occur due to arrival
or departure of a packet in a given node. The arrival processes
follow a Poisson distribution with average value λ packets/s;
the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean
value 1/µ seconds, resulting in a maximum departure rate or
service rate equal to µ packets/s.
Finding and solving a Markovian model to evaluate the
performance of the presented systems is a complex task. Thus,
in order to simplify the model, we considered a system without
queue. This assumption could be unrealistic for most appli-
cations. However, the results and conclusions obtained using
this simpliﬁed model is useful to give us some insights about
the comparative performance of the systems. A new model,
considering a more realistic system, is under construction.
Let x = {i, wi, j, wj, k, wk} be the general state repre-
sentation of the system, where i indicates a transmission in
the ﬁrst hop, wi indicates a packet waiting in the ﬁrst node,
j indicates a transmission in the second hop, wj indicates a
packet waiting in the second node, k indicates a transmission
in the third hop, and wk indicates a packet waiting in the
third node. For example, x = {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0} represents a state
where there is a transmission in the second hop and no packets
waiting in the nodes.
Only one packet can be on a server at any given moment.
The packet can be in transmission in the proper hop or waiting
for transmission. Thus, we have: i + wi ≤ 1; j + wj ≤ 1; and
k + wk ≤ 1. The set of generic feasible states is denoted as
S = {x|0 ≤ i, wi, j, wj, k, wk ≤ 1; 0 ≤ i + wi ≤ 1; 0 ≤
j + wj ≤ 1; 0 ≤ k + wk ≤ 1}. More speciﬁc sets of feasible
states for each mode are presented in Tables I to IV.
To simplify the notation, we considered that the subset
{hop, node} denotes a server, so we have three servers: server
i {i, wi}, server j {j, wj} and server k {k, wk}. Only one
packet can be in a server at a moment, the packet can be in
a state of being transmitted {1, 0} or waiting for transmission
{0, 1}; i.e., if i = 1, wi = 0 and if wi = 1, i = 0, meaning
i + wi will never be greater than 1. The same is valid for all
other servers.
The stationary probabilities, π(x) can be calculated from
the global balance equations and the normalization equation,

which are given as
πQ = 0,
X
x∈S
π(x) = 1.
(1)
where π is the steady state probability vector and Q denotes
the transition rate matrix. The detailed transition rates and
conditions for each mode can be found in Tables I to IV below.
The total transition rate from state i to state j, namely
qij is the summation of transition rates from state i to state
j considering all possible transitions. Once we determine the
qij for all i, j(i ̸= j) ∈ S, the diagonal elements in Q, i.e.,
qii i ∈ S are found as
qii = −
X
j∈S,j̸=i
qij.

When the steady state probabilities are determined from
(1), the performance of the system can be evaluated with re-
spect to different parameters. The derivations of mathematical
expressions for these parameters are presented in the following
section.
IV.
PERFORMANCE METRICS
To analyze the performance of the system we considered
the following metrics: blocking probability, drop probability,
capacity, throughput and the average number of packets in the
network.
A. Blocking Probability
The blocking probability, denoted by P, is deﬁned as the
probability of the network being in a state where there is a
transmission or a packet waiting in the server i and, therefore,
no packet can enter the network. This is computed by:
P =
X
x∈S
π(x), if
i + wi = 1.
(3)
where P is equal to the summation of all states probabilities
where i + wi = 1; i.e., there is a packet being transmitted or
waiting in the server i.
B. Capacity
The capacity, denoted by C, is deﬁned as the average
number of successful transmissions per time unit. This is
computed by:
C =
X
x∈S
π(x)µ, if
k = 1.
(4)
where k = 1 represents a transmission from server k
to destination node, that is a successful transmission, and µ
represents the maximum departure rate in server k.
C. Drop Probability
The drop probability, denoted by D, is deﬁned as the
probability that once a packet enters the network, it doesn’t
complete the transmission with success, meaning it is dropped.
This is computed by:
D = 1 − ST.
(5)
where Successful Transmission (ST) is the probability that
once a packet enters the network, it completes the transmission
with success. This is computed by:
ST =
C
λ(1 − P).
(6)
where C is the capacity, and λ(1 − P) represents the
average number of packet that enter in the network.
D. Throughput
The throughput, denoted by Th, is deﬁned as the relation
between the successful transmission rate by the total arrival
rate in the network and can be computed by:
Th = C
λ .
(7)
E. Average Number of Packets in the System
Let N(x) represent the sum i + wi + j + wj + k + wk in
each state. The average number of packets in the system can
be computed by:
Eq =
X
x∈S
π(x)N(x).
(8)
V.
NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present the performance analysis of the
four modes described in Section II. All computation was done
in MatLab using the analytical model proposed in this paper.
To compute the performance metrics, we set the arrival rate
λ varying from 1 to 10 packets/s and the maximum departure
rate µ equal to 10 packets/s.
The goal of this paper is to compare the performance of half
and full duplex systems. Thus, the channel is considered error
free. In addition, it is important to note that the performance
parameters used in the paper are normalized and, therefore,
depend only on the utilization factor (λ/µ) and not on the
actual data rate in the channel.
Figure 3 illustrates that the mode A[Half,Omni] has the
greater blocking probability because only one server can
transmit at a time and also because, while a packet does
not reach the end of the network, no other packet can enter
the network. The mode D[Full,Direc] has the lowest block
probability due to the fact that a new packet can enter
into the network at any moment (if server i is empty). The
B[Full,Omni] and C[Half,Direc] modes have almost the same
blocking probability.
In Figure 4, we can observe that the mode A[Half,Omni]
has no drop probability. This is because only one packet can
be transmitted in the network at a time. The B[Full,Omni] and
D[Full,Direc] modes have the greater drop probability because
they use full duplex transmission, meaning a server can receive
and transmit at the same time, but a packet is dropped if it
is received when the server is still transmitting, due to the
absence of queue positions in the servers.
Figure 5 and Figure 6 show that mode C[Half,Direc] has
the best performance in terms of capacity and throughput. This
result is due to the high drop probability of mode D, compared
with mode C. Finally, Figure 7 shows the average number of
packets in the system. Again, in this case, mode D[Full,Direc]
has the best performance.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a ﬁrst approximate Markovian
analytical model to evaluate the performance of four operation
modes in a line wireless multihop network, considering half
and full duplex operations and omnidirectional and directional
antennas, including a new IBFD mode proposed in [9], where
this mode was analyzed based only on simulation.
We considered a scenario with no buffer (no queue in
the servers). In this scenario, we conclude that the use of
full duplex operation with directional antennas mode has the
best performance in terms of blocking probability and the
average number of packets in the system and the mode using
half duplex operation with directional antennas has the best
performance in terms of capacity and throughput.
For future works, we intend to analyze the performance of
a system considering buffer (queues) in the servers.
