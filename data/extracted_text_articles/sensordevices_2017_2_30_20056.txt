Abstract—Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are often used
to monitor environmental parameters. In order to ensure the
continuity of the frequency response versus these parameters -
namely, to remove the effects of directivity, transducers working
out of the Bragg conditions are studied. Then, it is shown that
the multimodal nature of the acoustic cavity can be exploited to
design monolithic temperature SAW sensors.

INTRODUCTION
Physical quantities, such as temperature or pressure need
to be monitored in various industry sectors for safety reasons
and/or to ensure the good functioning of the facilities. One
major issue is that some sensors are inserted in harsh environ-
ments and in places where human intervention is not possible.
For instance, they could be located in rotary environment
(airplane turbines), oven where they face high temperatures
(steel industry), or they could also be subject to high magnetic
ﬁeld. Consequently, passive wireless sensors were developed.
These sensors make use of piezoelectricity and surface acoustic
waves (SAW) to allow remote measurements based on time or
frequency [1], [2].
Classically, one of the most common conﬁgurations for
SAW sensors is made of several resonators. These devices
allow for frequency differential measurements by taking into
account the behavior of each resonator regarding the quantity
of interest [3], [4] (the frequency difference between the
minima of the reﬂexion terms S11 is determined). However,
two difﬁculties come up. The ﬁrst one is a signiﬁcant issue
: how do different resonators interact and age in a different
way along time? Secondly, these systems usually work at
the Bragg conditions [5]; meaning that electrodes composing
the transducer are deposited on the surface of a piezoelectric
material so that the resonator is synchronous. Then, directivity
properties can be affected by environmental changes and
consequently, electrical response can be distorted, leading to
the appearance of contributions at the beginning and at the
end of Bragg band, to frequency jumps and ﬁnally, to wrong
measurement interpretations.
The solutions to design SAW wireless and battery-free
sensors proposed in this paper aim at resolving the two
previous considerations. At ﬁrst, the stability of the frequency
response is ensured thanks to the geometry of the device, which
directly impacts the sensitivity of the device to directivity.
This assertion is pointed out through different cases. Namely,
resonators are usually designed so that they are composed of
mirrors to create an acoustic cavity and of a ﬁnite transducer
whose mechanical period is twice smaller than the electrical
period [6]. These resonators work inside the Bragg band
and are subject to the previous constraints (risk of frequency
jumps when the directivity evolves, interaction between the
different resonators composing the structure). Thus, the idea is
to modify the design of the transducers in order to make them
work out of the Bragg band. The mirrors remain unchanged
[7]. Therefore, several SAW structures using langasite (LGS)
(YXlt)/48.5/26.7o cut and working out of the Bragg conditions
are designed to create acoustic cavity with a prevailing mode.
It is shown that resonators that meet the spectral purity
requirements can be designed.
Next, the intrinsic multimodal nature of the cavity is used
to design a monolithic sensor. By this way, the sensor is free
from the aging of each system independently and from the
interaction between them. A structure with more than three
resonances in the Industrial - Scientiﬁc - Medical (ISM) band
is designed to bring to light that a differential measurement
can be conducted directly between the different modes of the
system.
These different elements are pointed out using langasite
once again. This choice was made for two reasons. Firstly,
LGS was chosen due to the stability of its constants (piezo-
electric, elastic,etc.) at high temperatures. It is consequently a
good material for high temperature applications. Then, surface
acoustic waves on LGS exhibit a low velocity, which allows
the shrinking of sensoe dimensions for a given operating
frequency.
Finally, experimental measurements are carried out on
Quartz devices to emphasize the possibility to measure temper-
ature from 25oC to at minimum 130oC with a single resonator
sensor and to show the good calculation/test correlation. Quartz
was selected for experimental validations thanks to its well-
known material constants and because it is quite easy to
process compared to materials like langasite.
Consequently, section II details the directivity effects and
proposes a method to remove them. Next, section III is devoted
to the design of a monolithic SAW sensor by exploiting the
multimodal nature of the speciﬁc acoustic cavity described in
this work. Last part (section IV) concludes draws conclusions
on this study.

STABILITY OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF A SAW
DEVICE
A. Preliminary assessments
The stability of the frequency response of SAW sensors is
a crucial issue in measurement. It has been noticed that the
electrical response can be distorted and that frequency jumps
can appear when parameters like temperature or pressure vary.
This is pointed out on Figure 1, which shows the evolution
of the frequency response of a resonator working at the
Bragg condition when temperature varies from 25 to 300oC. A

decrease in conductance with temperature is clearly observed.
A change in the shape of the curve at the resonance is also
noticed when temperature increases. The appearance of a
second peak on the curve can lead to wrong measurement
interpretation. For instance, if we pay attention to the peaks
at 383.2 MHz on Figure 1, we can’t establish the value of the
temperature.
This phenomenon is due to the modiﬁcation of directivity
properties as shown in Figure 2. Indeed, directivity d expresses
the energy distribution in the cavity created by the two Bragg
mirrors. If d = 0o, the energy is concentrated at the beginning
of the stopband. On the contrary, if d = 90o, the energy is
mostly located at its end. As a consequence, when directivity
evolves, as shown Figure 2, the shape of the sensor response
is modiﬁed. This can be seen on Figure 1 : the device is
designed to work at the beginning of the Bragg band. But,
when temperature (so d) changes, the energy tends to move
in the Bragg band. As the band is narrow in this device, this
lead to the splitting of the peak.
Moreover, the reﬂection coefﬁcient r is deeply linked to
directivity as explained in [8]. It is well known by men of
the art that the control of reﬂection coefﬁcient is a critical
criteria to design SAW systems. The collapse of r and the
modiﬁcations of d with temperature (Figure 2) also induce the
decrease of insertion losses when heat rises.

directivity effects
B. Spectral quality of a three strips per wavelength resonator
To exhibit that a structure working out of the Bragg
band can be used to remove the inﬂuence of directivity on
the system, the behavior of a wave propagating under an
inﬁnite grating of platinum made of three strips per wavelength
λ is studied (transducer Figure 4. Once again, a langasite
(YXlt)/48.5/26.7o cut substrate is selected to put forward that
contrary to the results of section II-A and despite the existence
of two phase/frequency conditions involving the synchronism
of the design, either the beginning or the end of the Bragg
band is inhibited. That is to say, directivity has a negligible
effect on the response of the structure.
The observations to be drawn from the results represented
on Figure 3 are :
•
the large frequency gap between the ﬁrst and the sec-
ond contributions (about 8 MHz) that can be noticed
when looking at the x-axis of Figures 3a and 3b;
•
the very low electromechanical coupling (near to zero
for all the temperatures considered on Figure 3) of the
second resonance (high frequencies).

The mechanical coupling can be deduced from these graphs
considering the frequency gap between the resonance (maxi-
mum of admittance) and the antiresonance (zero of admittance,
which is also the maximum of impedance). On these ﬁgures,
susceptance and reactance are considered instead of admit-
tance and impedance because the behavior of the structure is
simulated by taking no losses into account.
These two assessments can be compared to the results of
Figure 1 : as the two modes are well separated, a splitting of
the principle mode in two is no more possible. Moreover, the
very low coupling of the second resonance induces that this
mode will not perturb the ﬁrst one.
This ﬁrst result, obtained considering an inﬁnite grating of
electrodes, demonstrates that beneﬁts are brought by working
out of the Bragg conditions, especially the possibility to
cancel the effects of directivity. As a consequence, a resonator
can now be designed according to the previous results and
following the pattern described on Figure 4.
The design of this kind of structures involves new criteria
and depends on the parameter to promote (coupling factor, low
cavity modes, etc.). The operating point is selected according
to the speciﬁcations. Regarding these considerations, three
cases are considered. Table I recaps their dimensions. The
frequency response functions of these structures are plotted
from Figure 5 to Figure 7. In ﬁrst instance, the device is de-
signed so that the resonant frequency (synchronous frequency)
is on the edge of the bandgap. The second case presents a
synchronous frequency between the beginning and the middle
of the bandgap. Finally, this frequency is located in the center
of the bandgap. We can notice that the use of one or another
location solution involves a trade-off between design criteria.
For example, the ﬁrst case shows a good dynamic on the
reﬂection coefﬁcient S11 (y-axis of Figures 5a, 6a, 7a) but, the
best ratio of cavity peaks on principal peak appears in the third
case, as for the best coupling factor than can be determined
on Figures 5b, 6b, 7b by considering the distance between the
maximum of conductance and its zero.
Finally, despite a low coupling factor (about 0.1% whereas
a similar structure working in the Bragg band has got a
coupling factor of about 0.25%) a resonator with a frequency
response function that meets the spectral purity requirements
has been successfully designed.

C. Remarks on designs
Three remarks can be added to the previous results. Indeed,
computations showed that the nearer your are from the pure
periodical excitation (alternating of +V/-V), the more the
secondary frequency contribution appears and the more losses
at the synchronous frequency are intensiﬁed. For instance, a
device with an excitation of ﬂoating/-V/+V/-V/ﬂoating/+V/-
V/+V will have a better spectral purity that a device with
+V/-V/+V/+V/-V/+V/-V excitation. To put it in a nutshell, the
response of the SAW device is better if the excitation pattern
is far from the +V/-V pattern.
Then, the design of resonators pointed out the possibility
to obtain puriﬁed designs with a prevailing mode in spite of
the multimodal character of the cavity.
Moreover, this kind of structure is easier to manufacture
than a three electrodes per λ system (larger strips to reach
the same frequency). Thanks to these two advantages, a 5/2λ
electrodes structure would be preferred than the 3/λ electrodes
system, which was presented at the beginning of the paper.
III.
MULTIPLE MODE RESONATORS
Now that the possibility to remove the inﬂuence of the
directivity on a SAW system response while keeping a good
spectral purity as been demonstrated, we will focus our at-
tentions on the possibility to design a monolithic temperature
sensor to free the system from the problematics presented dur-
ing the introduction. Consequently, the multimodal character
of the cavity is exploited.
A. Demonstration of the possibility to design a monolithic
SAW sensor
In the previous section, a single gap was taken into account
in order to simplify the optimization of the electrical response.
Now, two gaps are considered, as depicted on Figure 4. They
are deﬁned so that several resonances can exist in the wanted
frequency range. To sum up, an acoustic cavity is created
between the two Bragg mirrors. A transducer takes place inside
this cavity that beneﬁts from the energy of the cavity and
interrogates it thanks to direct and inverse piezoelectric effects.
Such a conﬁguration is an effective way to design a
temperature sensor using only one resonator by putting several
resonances in the ISM band. Indeed, the small variations of the
frequency difference between the peaks can be measured. A
SAW component is consequently designed. Its dimensions are
determined to obtain two main modes well separated and with
a maximum frequency interval between these two resonances.
A langasite substrate is still used and electrodes are made of
platinum. The structure of this component is summarized in
table II and its frequency response at ambient is given Figure
8.
The frequency difference ∆f between two resonances (fb
and fa) can be numerically evaluated. Indeed, an harmonic
analysis performed on a periodic and inﬁnite electrodes grating
reveals a phase velocity vϕ of about 2585 m/s. Considering
the values given in table II, we can deduce the total length of
the resonator: Lc ≃ 915λac with λac the wavelength of the
transducer. As a consequence:
∆f = fb − fa = vϕ
2Lc
≃ 236KHz with fb > fa

The previous equation is not entirely exact. Indeed, the
total length of the device is considered to take into account
the probability density of the presence of a mode. But, if the
mirrors were perfect, only the acoustic cavity should be taken
into account. However, it can be used as a ﬁrst approximation
to size the resonator. Then, this frequency difference evolves
along temperature as follows:
∆(∆f)
= ∂(∆f)
∂vϕ dvϕ + ∂(∆f)
∂Lc dLc
(2)
= ∆f0 × ( ∆vϕ
v0 − ∆Lc
L0 )
(3)
with ∆(∆f) that expresses the variation of the frequency gap
between two temperatures ; ∆f0 (resp. v0, resp. L0) is the
frequency gap (resp. the wave velocity, resp. the length of the
cavity) at the initial temperature. Terms in (2) correspond to

the total exact differential of ∆f.
Moreover, the variations of the wave velocity and of the
length of the cavity versus temperature have been established
by Bechmann and al. [9]. They are here expressed at the second
order :
∆vϕ
v0
= CTV1(T − T0) + CTV2(T − T0)2
(4)
∆Lc
L0
= α(1)
1 (T − T0) + α(2)
1 (T − T0)2
(5)
Finally, as CTV2 ≪ CTV1, the variation with the temper-
ature of the frequency difference can be approximated by:
∆(∆f)
∆f0
= (CTV1 − α)(T − T0)
(6)
The CTV and the ﬁrst order dilatation coefﬁcient α for the
(YXlt)/48.5/26.7o cut of Langasite were determined by Bungo
and al. [10]. It has been shown that CTV1 = −12.6ppm.K−1,
CTV2 = 73.9ppb.K−1 and α = 5ppm.K−1. As a conse-
quence, the calculation (as described in this section) of the
frequency gap of this device between 100oC and 200oC is
assumed to be 2.175 kHz if the initial frequency difference is
680 kHz. This is consistent with the results of the numerical
simulations, which give a ∆f of 2 kHz (Figure 9). Otherwise,
in this LGS crystal cut, reﬂection and conduction losses rise
fast with temperature, so the design has to be improved:
both variation of the frequency gap at these temperatures and
losses due to the fall of reﬂection and transducer coefﬁcients
can be seen. Nevertheless, despite the high losses due to the
increase of temperature, the good correlation between expected
frequency variations and simulation results have shown the
interest of our approach to measure temperature: a monolithic
SAW sensor has been designed.

B. Experimental results
Finally, a monolithic temperature SAW sensor is manufac-
tured to validate the previous results. A Quartz substrate and
aluminum electrodes are used. The transducers are made of
three strips per wavelength and three resonances in the ISM
band are expected. The evolution of the frequency gaps is
studied from 25oC to 130oC. The measures are done thanks to
a wafer probe whose chuck heats in this temperature range.
Figure 10 shows the frequency response of this device
for different temperatures. The frequencies are normalized.
The shift of the three resonances due to temperature changes
can be clearly observed on this graph. Furthermore, if we
have a look at Figure 11, we can study the evolution of
the frequency gap between the ﬁrst and the last resonances
along temperature. A decline of the normalized frequency
difference with temperature can clearly be observed. Indeed,
the frequency gap evolution under a temperature change can
be approximated by the following law :
∆(∆f)
∆f0
= CTF1(T − T0) + CTF2(T − T0)2
(7)
with CTF1 = −102ppm/oC and CTF2 = 226.5ppb/oC.
These results are consistent with the previous theoretical
analysis: a structure composed of an only transducer made
of a three electrodes per wavelength pattern was designed.
The response of this resonator shows three resonances whose
frequency difference of one peak to another decreases when
temperature increases.
As a consequence, after a set of calibrations, this device is
ready for use as a monolithic temperature sensor, which won’t
be subject to inconvenience such as frequency jumps due to
a change in directivity. Moreover, as a monolithic sensor, it
will not be subject to different aging between the different
structures.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Finally, this paper described a new design for surface
acoustic wave devices to mitigate the effects of the splitting
of the mode due to directivity effects and to raise the issue of
the badly known interaction between the resonators forming
the sensor.
As a consequence, a structure on LGS whose transducer
works out of the Bragg band is proposed. By this way, the

directivity while keeping a good spectral purity, which is
required for resonators and sources.
Furthermore, the intrinsic multimodal character of the
acoustic cavity is turned to its advantage. Indeed, a single
resonator with three main resonances was designed so that
differential measurements can be conducted to monitor en-
vironmental parameters. To validate this theoretical model,
a three strips per wavelength structure was realized on a
Quartz substrate. The possibility to monitor the evolution of
temperature between 25 and 130oC was demonstrated.
Further works will highlight the good agreement between
theoretical and experimental results on LGS.
