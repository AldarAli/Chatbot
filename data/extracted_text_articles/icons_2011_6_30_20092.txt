Abstract – For the business of an organization to be at a high 
level, it is necessary to define the relationships with an external 
company (partner) which is going to be helpful in the complete 
or partial implementation of some project. The main motive 
for hiring a company as a partner in the process of realization 
is for finding a high quality solution, and saving your own 
human resources. The process which deals with the business 
relationships between your company and an external company 
in the IT industry, according to ITIL V3 methodology of 
leading IT services, is Supplier Management. The aim of this 
article is to describe Supplier Management in the development 
of IPTV systems for a Telecom Operator, through the creation 
of a contract between Telecom Operator and an external 
company which needs to implement and install IPTV systems, 
and also through the guidelines for performance control of a 
partnership company by the Telecom Operator, during the 
project of application and installation of the IPTV system. The 
result of the comparative analysis has to be a sequence of 
recommendations for the improvement of relationships with an 
external company which has implemented the IPTV system 
and which is responsible for the initial maintenance of the 
IPTV system, for the purpose of enabling high quality IPTV 
services to the end users of this Telecom Operator. The 
measuring of the implementation of recommendations from 
the Supplier Management process in a comparative analysis 
was performed as recommended by the Balanced ScoreCard 
method.

I. INTRODUCTION
    Every company that wants to increase its level of work 
and business depends on the IT Service Management. If the 
IT processes and services are led successfully, the operation
of the company will become more fortunate and successful,
which can be noticed in the decrease of costs, and increase 
of revenues and achievement of contacts with other business 
partners. For the IT processes and services to be 
successfully led, it is necessary for the company to define a 
gathering of specialized organizational skills which are 
offered to clients in the form of a service. That set of 
specialized skills makes up the Service Management of a 
company [1], [8]. 
  
    There are many standards of Service Management
practice of which the most important is ITIL [1], [2]. 
Information Technology Infrastructure Library or ITIL 
represents the best environment for the practice of a 
company which offer IT services as their main business 
function.  ITIL poses a tool for implementing a service 
which one organisation will be able to fully use with 
realization of the implementation of all the processes or 
partially use through the implementation of just a few of 
their processes which are considered to be helpful in 
developing their business results. According to version 3, 
ITIL has 5 life cycle stages: Service Strategy, Service 
Design, 
Service 
Transition, 
Service 
Operation 
and 
Continual Service Improvement [1], [2], [8].
    Section II describes the basic meaning and goals of the 
Supplier Management process. Section III describes the 
criteria that the Telecom Operator needs to set for the IPTV 
consultant during the process of selecting a consultant who 
needs to implement and install the IPTV system. Section IV
lists the steps that need to be taken by the Telecom Operator 
and the IPTV consultant for the implementation of IPTV 
systems and defines five levels for the maintenance of the 
IPTV system by the consultant after the system is available 
for production. Section V is the central part of the paper, 
which presents a comparative analysis between the actual 
ITIL V3 recommendations Supplier Management processes 
and implemented ITIL V3 recommendations Supplier 
Management in the actual IPTV system, where BH 
Telecom's IPTV system is taken as the reference model. The 
conclusion of the contribution should give a result of 
applications of the ITIL V3 recommendations for Supplier 
Management in BH Telecom's IPTV system and give 
suggestions for improving recommendations that are poorly 
implemented.

    The last chapter of the article includes an analysis of the 
implementation of Supplier Management through the IPTV 
system of BH Telecom (the leading Telecom Operator in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina) with the recommendation of 
implementation, according to ITIL V3 standards, where 
throughout 
6 
main 
recommendations 
of 
Supplier 
Management according to ITIL V3 standards a comparative 
analysis has been performed regarding the application of 
ITIL V3 recommendations related to Supplier Management 
in the IPTV system of BH Telecom. 
    This contribution represents a continuation of scientific 
research and application of ITIL V3 standards which is lead 
in BH Telecom in order to adapt all of the systems under 
this standard 
with regard to 
previously published 
contributions 
in 
this 
field, 
a 
contribution 
entitled 
"Implementation of the Information System of the Telecom 
Operators Using the ITIL V3 Service Methodology for the 
Service Design Phase" which was published during the 
SERVICE COMPUTATION 2010 conference.
II. SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT
    Supplier Management process ensures that the external 
company and services, that they provide, can support the 
goals of the IT services and business expectations of a 
company. The aim of this process is to emphasize the 
importance of working with partner companies, and to 
provide guidance on how the business can best be directed 
towards the business benefit of the company by establishing 
a contract with another company that is used for complete or 
partial implementation of one or more projects which are of 
primary importance for the same company [9], [10], [11], 
[12], [18].
    The main goals of Supplier Management processes are to
[2], [4], [18]:

Maintain the value of money from the partner 
companies and the contracts with them.

Manage relationships with partner firms.

Manage the products of partner firms.

Categorize partner companies according to the 
quality of the products they offer.

Examine, renew and terminate agreements with 
partner companies.

Manage the performance of partner companies.

Implement services and plans for improving the
partner firms.
    When contracting business with partner companies, it is 
recommended to make a fully formal agreement with the 
partner company, with clearly emphasised and documented 
responsibilities and goals which the contract bears during 
certain phases in its life cycle, starting by defining business 
needs all the way to terminating agreements. Key activities 
of Supplier Management are [4], [8], [10], [16]:

Identifying business needs and preparation for 
business activities.

Assigning new agreements with partner companies.

Managing the performances of partner companies 
and contracts with them.

Defining the final requests with the existing partner 
companies.

Categorizing partner companies and contracts with 
them.

Evaluating and assigning new contracts with 
partner companies.
III. REALIZATION OF THE CONTRACT BETWEEN TELECOM 
OPERATOR AND EXTERNAL COMPANY WITH THE PURPOSE OF 
IMPLEMENTING AND INSTALING IPTV SYSTEM
   The first step in the realization of IPTV systems of 
Telecom Operator is the selection of a partner company that 
will design, implement and install IPTV system and also 
maintain the same for a certain period [1], [16]. Agreements
with 
external 
companies-consulate 
(contracts) 
are 
accomplished after a public process with which a company is 
chosen for projecting the installation of the IPTV systems.
The selection of IT consultants is performed through two 
phases: the prequalification phase and the final phase where 
the IPTV consultant is chosen. In order for the candidates to 
pass the phase of prequalification’s it is necessary for them:
a)
To not have any
legal impediment
in their 
participation in the contest for the choosing the best 
IT consultant.
b)
To have the right to perform professional services 
and to be registered in the proper professional
registers. 
c)
To have economical and financial condition to 
realize a successful implementation of the contract.
d)
That their technical and professional capacity 
ensures successful realization of the contract.
    Regarding the technical and professional
abilities, 
candidates must fulfil the following minimum requirements 
which must be confirmed through certified documents:
a)
Employed at least 30 certified IPTV consultants. 
b)
A 
minimum 
of 
three 
references 
to 
the 
implementation of IPTV systems in the telecom 
industry.
c)
Employed at least 20 certified IPTV consultants 
that will participate in the implementation of the 
project provided that at least 10 consultants provide 
a 12 month software support in the maintenance of 
the system.
d)
The existence of at least 10 IPTV consultants who 
have taken part in at least 3 projects of design and 
installation of IPTV systems.
e)
Possession
of 
own 
hardware 
and 
software 
infrastructures for the start of the mentioned project

f)
The offered IPTV software has to enable the end 
users functions such as: watching live TV channels, 
browsing, the electronic program guide (EPG), 
recording shows, shopping and an overview of all 
genres of movies, possibility of integration with 
VOIP platform, internet access, listening to radio 
channels, access to live games and encrypt live TV 
channels and movies.
g)
The offered IPTV software has to provide the 
expansion of the number of IPTV users in any 
number, expanding the number of movies to an 
unlimited number and the expansion of live TV an 
unlimited number.
h)
The offered IPTV solution must be such that it can 
be integrated with any type of Set Top Box.
i)
The offered IPTV solution must have a monitoring 
system that will monitor the activity of the whole 
system, live TV channels in certain regions of the 
Telecom Operator and the work of each Set Top 
Box that is connected to the IPTV system.
j)
The offered IPTV solution must be compatible with 
the existing network architecture of the Telecom 
Operator.
    The second phase is the phase of final selection for the 
IPTV consultant between the consultants who met legal, 
economical, technical and professional skills. There are three 
main parameters by which an IT consultant is selected from 
all other consultants: lowest price (with a percentage share of 
50%), the quality of offered the solution (with a percentage
share of 40%) and a deadline for the shipment of the offered 
solution (with a percentage share of 10%). The contract must 
be assigned to the consultant that has submitted the top rated
acceptable offer. In the event that two or more firms had the 
same rating for acceptability in the final assessment, the 
IPTV consultant with the shortest deadline time for the 
delivery of the offered solutions is chosen.
    The Telecom Operator can terminate the transfer from the
prequalification stage into in the final selection phase of the
IPTV consultant if the number of providers who have made 
it into the prequalification stage is less than 3 and in this case 
can again call a public process for the choice of IPTV 
consultant for the implementation and installation of IPTV 
solutions.
IV. MANAGING THE PERFORMANSE OF THE PARTNER 
COMPANY BY THE TELECOM OPERATOR IN REALIZATION OF 
THE IPTV SYSTEM 
    With the levels of maintenance of agreement between the 
Telecom Operator and the partner company it is necessary
to define the levels of problems, define malfunctions, 
response time and eliminating problems which the partner 
firm needs to solve according to the contract [16] (Table I).
   The first level represents the level of noticing problems, 
second level represents categorization of problems and 
setting priorities for solving the same, level three is solving 
the major problems that are essential for running the system 
and that must be solved in a matter of hours, level four is 
solving problems that need to be addressed over longer 
periods and are not relevant to the operation of the whole 
system, and the fifth level consists of a team of software 
engineers who are responsible for changing the functionality 
of the whole IPTV system, which usually takes place over a 
period of months or years [4], [16].
    According to the signed contract the total time of the 
project must be 18 months, provided that the time for the 
design and installation of the system by the partner company 
is 6 months, and the time for completing the obligations as 
well as offering software support provided by the partner 
company is 12 months. After the end of providing software 
support, after 12 months, Telecom Operator and the partner 
company can resign the contract again on the software 
maintenance system which again lasts 12 months. After this 
period of time, the Telecom Operator should be able to 
maintain with its own workforce its own IPTV system and to 
solve any incident or problems that may arise in it.
    After defining the levels and types of problems, it is 
possible to define the workflow for solving the problems for 
which, according to contract, the partner company is 
responsible. Table I shows the types of problems with 
periods that the partner company according to contract has to 
solve and targeted time for troubleshooting.

maintenance of the IPTV system, and an overview of the 
percentages of implementation of ITIL V3 suggestion for 
Supplier Management process in the IPTV system of BH 
Telecom. For the comparative analysis six basic ITIL V3 
recommendations for the Supplier Management have been 
chosen. Measurements of the implementation of ITIL V3 
recommendations for Supplier Management have been done 
according to the recommendation of standardized methods 
for measuring the realization of ITIL V3 recommendations 
which is called the Balanced Scorecard [7]. Balanced 
Scorecard, for each recommendation finds its relation to: the 
end user, internet processes, finances and growth potential of 
the system based on all four parameters gives the final results 
for implementation of one of the recommendations in one 
particular system.

Recommendation 1:
Identification of 
business 
requirements and 
preparation of 
business
In order to achieve 
financial gains and 
expansion of its 
services, BH Telecom 
has decided to 
introduce IPTV 
service by engaging 
foreign firms that 
should have a very 
high reference,  the 
same as the previous 3 
realized project in 
other Telecom 
Operators and own at 
least 20 certified 
IPTV consultants.
This 
recommendation 
has been fully 
realized (100%)
Recommendation 2: 
Assignment of new 
agreements with 
partner companies
There are clearly 
defined criteria for the 
prequalification stage 
and the final selection 
phase of IPTV 
consultants as the 
minimum number of 
consultants who must 
be at the stage of final 
selection for the entire 
procedure to 
successfully be 
completed. However, 
there is no defined 
criterion for a new 
business partner of 
choice in case of the 
termination of a 
partnership with a 
firm partner for the 
duration of the 
project. This 
conclusion is made 
after examining all

which is reflected 
through the work flow 
of support for which a 
firm partner is in 
charge and the types 
of problem solving in 
time by a firm partner 
under the contract 
must be resolved on 
the side where the 
firm partners in 
problem solving 
include all categories 
of technical staff from 
technicians to system 
engineers.
This 
recommendation 
has been fully 
realized (100%)
Recommendation 4: 
Defining the end 
requests with an 
existing firm partner
BH Telecom has not 
defined clear criteria 
by which to carry out 
re-election of the firm 
partners in the event 
of failure to fulfil all 
its obligations during 
the project 
implementation and 
installation of IPTV 
solutions as well as 
whether in this case 
the re-election of the 
firm partners take 
place through the 
public process through 
the stages of 
prequalification and 
the final selection of 
the IPTV consultant.

choose only those 
firms which meet the 
legal, financial, 
technical or 
professional abilities 
and the final stage of

of IPTV consultant.
Recommendation 6:
Evaluation and 
mediation of new 
contracts with 
partner companies
There is a clearly 
defined procedure of 
selection of other 
firms that may 
participate in the 
implementation of 
solutions where a firm 
aside from the IPTV 
consultant can come 
alone to implement 
and install a system 
database, the crypto 
system, video system, 
Load Balancing 
system, monitoring 
system, Network 
Video system or 
Headend system. 
Choosing this firm 
can happen at a later 
realization of the 
project when the 
contract expires with 
the initial IPTV 
consultant.
This 
recommendation is 
fully implemented 
(100%)
  The 
comparative 
analysis 
showed 
that 
Supplier 
Management in the IPTV system of BH Telecom has been 
completely applied in four ITIL V3 recommendations (the 
identification of business needs and the preparation of 
businesses, 
controlling
the
performance
of 
partner 
companies and contracts with them, categorizing partner 
companies and the contract with them, evaluation and 
intermediation of new contracts with partner firms), 
partially in one ITIL V3 recommendations (intermediation 
of new contracts with partner firms), and that it isn’t at all 
applied in one ITIL V3 recommendation (defining the end 
request with the existing partner company).
    
    If you find the arithmetic mean of all percentages of 
recommendations from Supplier Management you come to 
the conclusion that 75% of the recommendations have been 
successfully applied in BH Telecom's IPTV system   (Figure
1). Figure 1
shows the
ratio of successfully and 
unsuccessfully implemented ITIL V3 recommendations for 
Supplier Management in BH Telecom's IPTV system.

                 ITIL V3 recommendations for BH Telecom's IPTV system
VI.  CONCLUSION
    There are two main criterions that have to be taken into 
consideration upon defining Supplier Management during 
the implementation of IPTV system of Telecom Operators: 
criteria for granting contracts with partner companies for the
implementation and installation of an IPTV system and 
criterions for controlling the performance of the partner 
company by the Telecom Operator [4], [12], [13], [16]. The 
criterion for granting contracts to partner firms for the 
implementation and installation of the IPTV system has to 
satisfy all legal, economical, technical and professional
conditions that are set on the public process of choosing the 
partner company. Granting the contract to the partner 
company is usually managed in two phases: the phase of 
prequalification and the phase of final selection of the 
partner company. The criterion for controlling the 
performance of the partner company must define the stages 
of maintenance of the IPTV system by the partner company 
and phases of the development of the system that need to be 
defined by the Telecom Operator and the partner company.
    The comparative analysis has shown the applicability of 
ITIL V3 recommendations for Supplier Management in the 
IPTV system of the Telecom Operator is 75%. For complete 
realization of all ITIL V3 recommendations it is necessary
to define the criteria of choice of a new partner company for 
the duration of the project as well as the method of process 
after which the new partner company is chosen and defining 
clear criteria in the event that a partnership is terminated 
with the existing company. The criteria of selecting a new
partner company in the event of a termination of the 
contract with the current partner company has to offer a 
contract for accepting the best positioned team that on the 
public process didn’t acquire the contract for running the 
business of implementation, installation and maintenance of 
the IPTV system. Such a procedure would last only a few 
days and this way in a very short period a new partner 
company would be chosen. In the event that none of the 
companies accept the contract then the public process is

    Further investigations in this field should give a similar
comparative 
analysis
of
the 
process 
of 
Change 
Management, 
Incident 
Management 
and 
Problem 
Management which occurred six months 6 months after the
initial installation of the system which would include 
hardware and software changes of the IPTV system by the 
Telecom Operator and also conflicts with real incidents 
generated by the end users and real problems that may occur
because of the interruption
of one of the essential
components of the IPTV system [10], [16], [18].
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Telecom and Smart Com
for the advice during the 
implementation of the IPTV system in BH Telecom as the 
leading Telecom Operator in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
expert advice from Netvisor, Motorola, Kasenna and 
Verimatrix based on the practical experience in the 
implementation of individual components of the IPTV 
system in a large number of Telecom Operators.
