Abstract—In this paper, we study the problem of Transmit An-
tenna Selection (TAS) for the minimization of a base station power
consumption. We propose an algorithm, which solves this problem
when the optimal precoding and power allocation are employed,
i.e., when an eigenvalue decomposition is employed with a water-
ﬁlling algorithm. For that purpose, we derive an approximation
for the base station power consumption expression that can be
used to compute the number of switched-on antennas. Besides,
we show that Norm-Based Selection (NBS) policy can be used
for selecting the switched-on antennas. Finally, our numerical
results show that the proposed low-complexity algorithm provides
optimal power consumption performances.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is one of the
key technology to meet the ever-growing demand for mobile
data. However, increasing the number of transmit and receive
antennas increases the number of RF chains and, therefore, the
energy consumption of base stations. That is why mitigating
the energy consumed by MIMO systems is a big challenge for
the development of future wireless networks [1].
The base station energy consumption can be reduced by
switching-off some of the transmit antennas. This mechanism
is called Transmit Antenna Selection (TAS) [2]. This solution
has been widely proposed for maximizing the capacity of
MIMO systems [3][4] and can also be used for making green
wireless communications networks.
Making wireless communication networks green can be
done by either maximizing the Energy Efﬁciency (EE) or
by minimizing the base station power consumption under
some constraints on the quality of service (e.g., capacity).
An algorithm for maximizing the EE of a point-to-point
communication with antenna selection has been proposed in
[5]. However, this algorithm has a rather high complexity.
In [6], the authors proposed a transmit antenna selection
algorithm for maximizing the EE of a MISO system with
a large number of transmit antennas. Moreover, in [7], the
authors proposed to maximize the EE by selecting antennas
on both the transmit and receive sides. Unlike [6][7], which
focus on the maximization of the EE, in this paper, we focus
on the problem of antenna selection for power consumption
minimization. This problem has been studied in [8], in this
paper the authors proposed an algorithm to solve it in the case
where the transmit power is equally distributed over all the
eigenvalues. One of the limitations of the algorithms proposed
Figure 1.
A base station with Nt antennas serves a mobile user with Nr
antennas.
in [5]–[8] is the precoding and power allocation. Indeed, in all
these papers, the transmit power is equally distributed either
over all the antennas or over all the modes. Whereas, in MIMO
systems, more efﬁcient performance can be achieved using
better precodings. In particular, optimal performance can be
achieved using the well-known eigenvalue decomposition and
water-ﬁlling algorithm [9].
In this paper, we study the problem of transmit antenna
selection for the minimization of the power consumption of a
base station when the optimal precoding and power allocation
is performed. In other words, when the eigenvalue or singular
value decomposition is employed with a water-ﬁlling algorithm
[9]. In addition to improving the performance, the optimal
power allocation changes the set of antennas which have to be
switched-on to serve the user. We propose a low-complexity
two-steps algorithm for the selection of a sub-optimal set
of switched-on antennas. For that purpose, we derive an
approximation for the base station power consumption and use
it for computing Non (the number of switched-on antennas).
Moreover, we show that, once this number is known, we can
switch-on the Non antennas whose corresponding columns of
the channel matrix has the highest norm.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system
model is introduced in Section II. In Section III, we recall
the expression of the water-ﬁlling algorithm and we assess
the performance of the antenna selection policy. In Section
IV, we propose an approximation for the base station power
consumption and we use this approximation for selecting the
number of switched-on antennas. Some numerical simulations
are conducted in Section V and Section VI concludes this
paper.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a point-to-point MIMO system in which a
base station with Nt transmit antennas serves a mobile user
with Nr receive antennas. As illustrated in Fig. 1, each of
the Nt antennas of the base station is linked to an RF chain.

Instead of using all its antennas, the base station switches-off
some of them and the corresponding RF chains in order to save
energy. We denote Son the set of switched-on antennas and
Non is the cardinal of this set, i.e., the number of switched-
on RF chains. Moreover, for the analysis of the base station
power consumption, we focus on the power consumed in the
RF chains whose power consumption can be modeled as [5]
[10]:
P = 1
ηa
PTX + NonPct,
(1)
where P is the total base station power consumption, PTX is
the transmit power used to serve the user. This transmit power
must be lower than a maximum value denoted Pmax = 20W.
ηa = 0.35 denotes the efﬁciency of the power ampliﬁers, and
Pct = 120 mW is the static power consumed by each switched-
on RF chain. In other words, Pct is the power which can be
saved by switching-off an antenna.
In this paper, we suppose that the base station has a perfect
Channel State Information (CSI). We denote H ∈ CNr ×Non the
channel matrix when Non antennas are switched-on. Moreover,
hk denotes the kth column of the matrix H and ||hk||2 denotes
its Euclidian norm. Furthermore, L denotes the pathloss be-
tween the base station and the user and σ2 denotes the noise
power. We denote by Q the input covariance matrix [9], which
veriﬁes Tr(Q) = PTX , where Tr(.) denotes the trace operator.
With the notations introduced herein, the channel capacity can
be written as:
C = log2
 
det
 
INon + L
σ2 QH∗H
!!
,
(2)
where INon denotes the identity matrix of size Non, det(.) is
the matrix determinant and H∗ denotes the conjugate transpose
of H.
In our numerical simulations, we consider Rayleigh fading
channel, in such case, the elements of the channel matrix are
independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero mean complex
Gaussian variables with variance one. Moreover, we compute
the pathloss with the Winner II ’C1’ pathloss model [11] with
a 2 GHz central frequency. The thermal noise is equal to
σ2 = kBTB, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the
temperature in Kelvin and B = 1 MHz is the bandwidth. A
2dB noise ﬁgure is considered.
Our objective is to minimize the base station power con-
sumption while providing to the user a given quality of service
in term of capacity. The optimization problem can be written
as:
min
Son,PTX

PTX + NonPct,
(3a)
S.t. Cc ≤ log2
 
det
 
INon + L
σ2 QH∗H
!!
.
(3b)
PTX ≤ Pmax
(3c)
In (3b), Cc denotes the capacity constraint of the user.
Please note that, this constraint is written as an inequality,
however, it is easy to see that the base station power consump-
tion is minimum when this constraint is an equality, i.e., when
Cc = C. Equation (3c) makes sure that the transmit power
is not higher than the maximum transmit power of the base
station. In the following, we propose an algorithm to solve the
problem of (3).
III.
ANTENNA SELECTION POLICY
In this section, we ﬁrst recall the optimal MIMO precoding
and power allocation. Besides, we assess the performance of
the employed antenna selection policy.
A. MIMO precoding
We assume, here, that a set of Son antennas has been
switched-on and we recall the MIMO precoding which min-
imizes the power consumption. When the set of switched-
on antennas has been chosen, minimizing the base station
power consumption aims at minimizing the transmit power.
Looking at the capacity, ﬁnding the optimal MIMO precoding
means deriving the matrix Q which minimizes the transmit
power while providing to the user its capacity constraint. It is
well-known that the matrix Q is optimal when the eigenvalue
decomposition of H∗H is performed [9]. In other words, Q
and H∗H must have the same eigenvectors. In that case, the
capacity constraint becomes:
Cc =

(4)
where λk denotes the kth eigenvalue of H∗H, µk is the kth
eigenvalue of Q and N = min(Non, Nr). Then, the eigenvalues
µk which minimize the transmit power are computed with the
well-known water-ﬁlling algorithm:

B. Norm-Based Selection
In this section, we answer the following question: if we
want to switch-on Non antennas, which ones must be selected?
A good solution for antenna selection lies in switching-on the
Non antennas whose corresponding columns of the channel
matrix have the highest norm. This solution is called Norm-
Based Selection (NBS). This approach has been proposed in
[12] for capacity maximization with equal power allocation
over the antennas. It has been proven to be optimal at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and in the Multiple-Input Single-
Output (MISO) case [13]. Recently, this solution has also been
shown to provide near-optimal performance even when the
columns of the channel matrix are correlated [14].
In this paper, we propose to use NBS with the optimal
power allocation for the purpose of power consumption min-
imization. In order to assess the performance of NBS, we
consider a base station with Nt = 12 antennas and we suppose
that the capacity constraint is equal to 5 bits/s/Hz. We compare:

•
The minimum base station power consumption with
NBS. Which is obtained by computing the power con-
sumption with the Nt possible antenna conﬁgurations
with NBS and by ﬁnding the one that minimizes the
power consumption.
•
The minimum base station power consumption which
is computed with an exhaustive search. I.e., by eval-
uating the base station power consumption for the
2Nt −1 possible antenna conﬁgurations and by ﬁnding
the optimal one.
We compute the average base station power consumption,
with these two strategies, as a function of the distance between
the user and the base station. The results are presented in Fig.
2. They show that, with the selected simulation parameters,
NBS and the iterative search provide the same results. As a
consequence, this antenna selection strategy provides optimal
performance. That is why we can use NBS as a solution for
transmit antenna selection.

SUB-OPTIMAL NUMBER OF SWITCHED-ON
ANTENNAS
In this section, we propose a method to compute Non, the
number of switched-on antennas.
A. Number of antennas
In the previous section, we have shown that with an optimal
power allocation, NBS is an optimal antenna selection policy.
We, now, have to focus on the number of switched-on antennas.
Indeed, with NBS, we have Nt possible antenna conﬁgurations
(one for each number of switched-on antennas). In order to ﬁnd
the one which minimizes the base station power consumption,
we can compute the power consumption of the base station
for each of them and select the optimal one. However, this
iterative computation requires Nt matrix diagonalizations and
as many water-ﬁlling algorithms. This is too much. That is
why, in the following, we derive an approximation for the base
station power consumption when Non antennas are switched-
on. Once this approximation has been derived, the proposed
algorithm can compute the value of Non which minimizes our
approximation in order to provide a sub-optimal value for the
number of switched-on antennas.
In order to approximate the base station power consump-
tion, we ﬁrst insert the expression of the transmit power of (6)
in (1). We obtain the following expression:
P = σ2

we denote αk the normalized eigenvalue of H∗H:

where S = P

2. In order to derive an approxima-
tion for the base station power consumption, we consider the
case where the matrix H∗H has exactly N non-zero eigenvalues
and where all these eigenvalues are considered in the water-
ﬁlling algorithm. In other words, we consider the case N ′ = N.
In this situation, all the eigenvalues are beneﬁcial to satisfy the
user’s capacity constraint. This is the best case.
In (9), we have a weighted difference between the geomet-
ric and arithmetic means of
1
αk , ∀k ∈ ⟦1; N ′⟧. The geometric
mean is always lower than the arithmetic mean and we have
an equality in the case where all the αk are equals to
1
N . As
a consequence, we can approximate the base station power
consumption of the base station by its value in the case where
all the eigenvalues are equals. We derive:
P ≈ NonPct +
N2σ2

(10)
Please, note that, the evaluation of the power consumption
with (10) does not require any matrix diagonalization. More-
over, this approximation allows to verify if the constraint on
the maximum transmit power of (3c) is satisﬁed. Indeed, for
a given number of switched-on antennas, the transmit power
of the base station is approximated by:
PTX ≈ Papp
TX =

For a number Non of antennas, if the approximation of
(11) is higher than the maximum transmit Pmax, the value of
PTX will probably be higher than Pmax. As a consequence, we
can eliminate the antenna conﬁgurations for which the transmit
power is higher than Pmax by eliminating the values of Non
for which Papp
TX ≥ Pmax(1 − ǫ), where ǫ is a security margin
which can be equal to 0.05.
Finally, we can ﬁnd N∗
on, the sub-optimal value for the
number of switched-on antennas, by ﬁnding the value of Non
which minimizes (10):

Proposed algorithm
B. Algorithm in full
The observations done in the previous sections show that
NBS policy provides optimal performance, and that we can
provide an approximation for the base station power consump-
tion. So, the antenna selection can be done by ﬁrst ordering
the columns by descending order of their norm. Then, for
each value of Non, we can evaluate the base station power
consumption with (10) and ﬁnd the value N∗
on for which it is
minimum. Finally, the base station can make the eigenvalue
decomposition and apply the water-ﬁlling algorithm.
The whole algorithm introduced in this paper is summa-
rized in Fig. 3. It is interesting to note that among the ﬁve steps
of the algorithm, the ﬁrst three are used for antenna selection
and the last two are used for precoding and power allocation.
Besides, this algorithm has a low complexity. Indeed, the
step with the highest complexity is the matrix diagonalization
which is part of the precoding.
V.
SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we use numerical simulations in order to
analyze the effect of the proposed antenna selection policy and
of the power allocation on the base station power consumption.
A. Performance of the proposed policy
We ﬁrst conduct some numerical simulations in order to
assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. For that
purpose, we compare four different policies:
•
The proposed policy.
•
The optimal policy with NBS, in which we compute
the power consumption for the Nt possible conﬁgu-
rations and select the one which consumes the less
power.
•
A policy in which all the RF chains are switched-on.
•
A policy in which the number of antennas is computed
using the method proposed in [8].
For each of the antenna selection policies compared here,
NBS is applied and after selecting the number of antennas, the
base station computes the transmit power with the water-ﬁlling
algorithm. We consider the simulation parameters introduced
in Section II and we suppose that the base station has Nt =
32 antennas, that the user has Nr = 8 antennas, and that the
capacity constraint of the user is equal to 20 bits/s/Hz.

We display in Fig. 4 the average base station power con-
sumption with the four compared policies. We can see in this
ﬁgure that the proposed policy provides optimal performance.
We ﬁrst compare the base station power consumption with the
proposed policy and with the policy without antenna selection.
We can see that the highest gain is obtained when the user is
near the base station. In such situation, the base station power
consumption is reduced from 4 W to 0.2 W. Moreover, we
can see, in Fig. 5, that the number of switched-on antennas is
low when the user is near the base station and increases with
60

the distance. Indeed, when the user is near the base station,
the transmit power used to serve him is low. In such case,
the part of the power consumption which is dependent on the
transmit power ( 1
ηa PTX ) is low. As a consequence, switching-
on an antenna increases more the power consumption than
increasing the transmit power and, consequently, only one
antenna is switched-on. On the contrary, when the user is far
from the base station, the part of power consumption which
is proportional to the transmit power is high compared to
the power needed to switch-on an antenna. In that case, it
is beneﬁcial to switch-on more antennas.
By comparing the number of switched-on antennas with the
proposed and with the optimal policies, we can see, in Fig. 5,
that the number of switched-on antennas is slightly lower with
the proposed policy. However, we can see in Fig. 4 that, the
error committed on the number of antennas does not have any
effect on the power consumption as the water-ﬁlling algorithm
counterbalances this error by adjusting the transmit power. In
other words, when the power is allocated with the water-ﬁlling
algorithm, it compensates the error committed on the number
of antennas. Besides, as the proposed solution uses a little less
antennas than the optimal strategy, it requires a little more
power to serve the user. This result is shown in Fig. 6.
Furthermore, with the solution proposed in [8], the num-
ber of switched-on antennas is computed considering that
the transmit power PTX is equally distributed over all the
eigenvalues. With such hypothesis, more antennas are required
to serve the users. As more antennas are switched-on, the
base station power consumption is higher. This extra-power
consumption causes performance loss when the user is near
the base station and the transmit power low. That is why,
our solution outperforms the one proposed in [8]. When the
distance increases, the transmit power increases and the impact
of the error in the number of antennas has less impact on the
base station power consumption.
B. Impact of the power allocation
We now analyze the impact of the power allocation. For
that purpose, we still consider that the base station has 32
antennas and that the user has 8 antennas. We consider three
different power allocations: the water-ﬁlling one, an equal
power transmission over the transmit antennas and an equal
power transmission over the eigenvalues. For this evaluation,
we suppose that the capacity constraint is equal to 10 bits/s/Hz
and we do not consider the constraint on the maximum transmit
power. The results are displayed in Fig. 7. It is important to
note that, with equal power transmissions (over the transmit
antennas or over the eigenvalues of H∗H) the value of the
transmit power which satisﬁes the capacity constraint of the
user has to be computed using an iterative algorithm such as
the bisection method.
This ﬁgure shows that the water-ﬁlling algorithm outper-
forms the two others power allocations. More precisely, the
water-ﬁlling algorithm provides a large gain compared to the
allocation where the RF power is equally distributed over
all the antennas. Besides, even if the water-ﬁlling algorithm
provides a small gain compared to the power allocation with
equal transmit power over the eigenvalues, both solutions
require perfect CSI and the water-ﬁlling algorithm is more

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the problem of transmit antenna
selection with an optimal precoding, i.e., with the eigenvalue
decomposition and a water-ﬁlling algorithm. We proposed
a low-complexity algorithm for minimizing the base station
power consumption. Our results show that, when the water-
ﬁlling algorithm is employed, a small error in the number of
switched-on antennas has no effect on the base station power
consumption. This result highlights the possibility to reach
optimal performance with simple algorithms. For our future
work, we plan to study the combination of antenna selection
and Cell Discontinuous Transmission.
