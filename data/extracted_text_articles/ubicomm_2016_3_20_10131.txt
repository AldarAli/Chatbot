Abstract—Smart spaces have become an active research field 
over the last few years. The main objective of such spaces is to 
provide intelligent services to the user for improved comfort 
and energy saving. The recent advances in sensors network 
and embedded systems have helped a lot in the realization of 
smart spaces. In order to provide adapted services to the users, 
such spaces should operate in a proactive manner and 
according to the current context. The degree of intelligence of 
such spaces could be enormously enhanced with the context-
awareness aspect. Defining context and establishing its 
components are basic steps for context-aware services 
adaptation in a smart space.  In this paper, we propose a 
context-aware services adaptation for a smart waiting room 
which could improve both person’s comfort and energy saving 
in such spaces. We describe the context using a clear and 
concise definition and use the naïve Bayes machine learning 
technique for the adaptation.  
Keywords-waiting room, context; service; adaptation; naïve 
Bayes.

 INTRODUCTION  
The main aim of smart spaces or intelligent environment 
is to assist inhabitants (resp. occupants) to live comfortably 
by not bothering them from concentrating on setting and 
configuring home appliances.  The most common definition 
of a smart space is the one proposed by Cook and Das [1]: 
"Smart space is able to acquire and apply knowledge about 
its environment and to adapt to its inhabitants in order to 
improve their experience in that environment". Smart spaces 
should provide intelligent services in order to improve the 
quality of life, energy saving and safety of inhabitants. Smart 
spaces should provide adapted services in a proactive 
manner (without explicit intervention from user). In order to 
improve the intelligence of these spaces, services should be 
provided according to the current context. One example of 
smart spaces is the waiting rooms where people can wait 
(generally sitting) for some kind of services. An important 
issue in such spaces is energy saving. In several cases 
appliances of the waiting room such as light bulbs, cooling/ 
heating system and TV or radio/music player operate even 
when there is no person inside the waiting room which 
causes a great loss of energy. Context-awareness has become 
an important aspect of smart spaces. It could enhance both 
the person's comfort and energy saving of the waiting room 
and helps it to operate smartly by adapting services 
according to the current context. Context-aware services 
adaptation should be preceded by an important and basic step 
which consist of defining the context element and 
establishing its components. Several approaches for context-
aware services adaptation were proposed for either pervasive 
systems or smart spaces. Most of them have the following 
same weakness point: not based on a clear definition of 
context and do not propose a clear method for context 
elements establishment which limit their use and affect the 
quality of services adaptation. In this paper, we propose a 
context-aware services adaptation for a waiting room which 
could enhances energy saving and comfort of waiting 
persons. Our approach is based on a clear definition of 
context and clear steps to extract context elements. The 
adaptation task is done using the naive Bayes machine 
learning technique. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
provides some background information about related work. 
Section III describes the overall environment of an 
exemplary waiting room. In Section IV we discuss details 
about context identification. Section V presents our context-
aware services adaptation approach. The conclusion and 
future work will be given in Section VI.

RELATED WORK 
Several approaches for context-aware services adaptation 
for smart spaces have been proposed over the last few years. 
Most of them were proposed for a particular type of smart 
spaces namely smart homes.Li et al.[2] developed a context-
aware lightning control system for smart meeting rooms. 
They used an ontology-based context modeling approach and 
a rule based system for context reasoning. Madkour et al. [3] 
used a Weighted Case Based Reasoning (WCBR) for 
enabling context awareness. They illustrated the elaboration 
of an adaptive and autonomous control of heating 
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC). Ni et al. [4] 
proposed a case-based reasoning technique for services 
adaptation in a smart home. Chahuara et al. [5] presented an 
audio-controlled smart home based on a framework 
composed of knowledge representation module using a two 
level ontology, a situation recognition module based on the 
Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) logic reasoner and a 
decision making module based on the markov logic network 
(using weighted logic rules) to deal with uncertainty and 
imprecision of context information. Miraoui et al. [6] 
proposed a context-aware services adaptation approach for a 
smart living room using two machine learning techniques

namely naive Bayes and neural network. Humayun et al. [7] 
presented a context-aware application which can provide 
service according to the predefined choice of user. It uses 
Mahalanobis distance based k nearest neighbor’s classifier 
technique for inference of predefined service. They 
combined the features of supervised and unsupervised 
machine learning in the proposed application. This 
application can also adapt itself when the choice of user is 
changed by using Q-learning reinforcement learning 
algorithm. Badlani & Bhanot [8] proposed an adaptive smart 
home system for optimal utilization of power, through 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Kumar et al. [9] presented 
a semantic policy adaptation technique and its applications in 
the context of smart building setups. Humayun et al. [10] 
presented a machine learning based context-aware system 
which can provide service according to the trained model. 
Two effective learning algorithms: Back propagation Neural 
Network, and Temporal Differential (TD) class of 
reinforcement learning are used for prediction and adaptation 
respectively.

SMART WAITING ROOM 
A. Description of a typical waiting room 
A waiting room is a special place where people can wait 
(generally sitting) for a service. One can find waiting rooms 
in several locations: at doctor's office, at a lawyer office, at 
several government offices, at banks, etc. The main aim of a 
waiting room is to keep people waiting for their services in a 
comfortable state. An exemplary waiting room is composed 
of a set of appliances and furniture which can be mainly 
categorized in three classes: a) light system, composed of a 
set of light bulbs and window blinds, b) cooler/ heater 
system which is composed of a heater and a cooler or 
embedded in one air conditioner which can either make 
cooling or heating, c) entertainment system, which is 
composed of a TV and/or a radio/music player and d) a set of 
chairs (Fig. 1). 
 
 
Figure 1.  Main components of an exemplary waiting room 
B. Expected running of a smart waiting room 
In order to improve waiting people's comfort and saving 
energy, a smart waiting room should provide services 
according to the current context and proactively (without 
explicit user intervention) in an unobtrusive manner. In the 
initial and final state (the waiting room is empty), all the 
appliances should be off in order to save energy. As soon as 
at least one person enters the waiting room (state 1), the light 
system composed of window blinds and a set of light bulbs 
starts to adjust the inside light. When the system perceives at 
least one person sitting, it moves to state 2. In addition to 
running the light system, the smart waiting room should start 
the heating/cooling system to adjust the temperature inside 
the waiting room. After a few seconds, the entertainment 
system composed of the TV or the radio/music player should 
start and the waiting room goes to state 3. At any state, if the 
smart waiting room system perceives no one inside the 
waiting room, it should go to the initial state and put all 
appliances off or go to temporary state (state 3) during office 
hours where all appliances should be set at low energy 
consumption. Fig. 2 shows the state diagram of the overall 
operation of the smart waiting room. 
IV. 
CONTEXT IDENTIFICATION 
Context-awareness is a highly desirable property for 
smart spaces which allows them to provide proactively 
(without explicit intervention of users) adapted services 
according to the context of use. The first step of developing 
context-aware systems consists of defining context in a clear 
manner and establishing its components. In spite of the great 
number of definitions proposed for context, until now there 
are no agreed definition. Most of these definitions remain 
vague and general and do not provide clear steps or method 
to extract context elements. Some of the proposed definitions 
were 
based 
on 
enumerating 
contextual 
information 
(localization, nearby people, time, date, etc.) like those 
proposed in [11] [12] [13]. Others were based on providing 
more formal definitions in order to abstract the term, like the 
one proposed by Dey [14]. In our previous work [15], 16], 
we have made a survey of existing definitions of context and 
proposed a service-oriented definition of context for 
pervasive and ubiquitous computing environments which 
could be easily adapted to smart spaces. Our definition states 
that the context is: "Any information that triggers a service 
or changes the quality (form or mode) of a service if its value 
changes." This definition is sufficiently abstract and helps to 
limit the set of contextual information. We believe that this 
definition is more expressive, because it is simple, clear, and 
complete; in addition, it covers all aspects of the context. 
Establishing context elements is a three-steps process 
consisting of: 1) specify for each equipment the provided 
service and the set of information that could trigger the 
service, 2) specify for each service the set of forms through 
which the services can be provided. We should also specify 
for each form of service the set of information whose change 
will change the form of a service and 3) make the union of 
the two previous sets to get the final list of contextual 
information and define the set of possible values for each

context element. This information will compose the global 
context.

room 
By applying our context definition and context 
components establishment method to the smart waiting 
room, we have got the result of each step as indicated in 
Table I, Table II and Table III.

It is clear that our method for context elements 
establishment which is composed of the above three steps is 
easy to perform and leads to the set of global context 
required for services adaptation inside the waiting room. The 
possible values of each context element (values domain) 
could be adjusted according to the implementation. 
V. 
CONTEXT-AWARE SERVICES ADAPTATION 
The aim of context-aware services adaptation is to render 
appliances of the waiting room operating in a proactive 
manner with minimum human intervention and to provide 
services with minimum energy consumption. Based on the 
previous context definition and its element's establishment, 
we propose in this Section a context-aware services 
adaptation for a waiting room. The waiting room should 
operate according to the current context which is composed 
of the following elements: person presence, seated person, 
indoor temperature, indoor light, outdoor light and time. 
Whenever a person enters the waiting room, the light 
system should start adjusting the ambient light by setting the 
window blinds and light bulbs according to the rules 
presented in Table IV. There are also two particular context 
situations related to energy saving (Table V). The first one is 
when there is no person inside the waiting room and it is 
outside of office hours so the light system should be set off. 
The second one is when there is no person inside the waiting 
room and it’s during office hours so the system should set 
the light on its minimum energy consumption mode which is 
window blinds opened and light bulbs off. The symbol “?” 
means whatever value. 
The cooler/heater system should operate according to the 
current context whenever the system perceives at least one 
person seated inside the waiting room. The possible context-
aware configurations of the cooler/heater system are given 
by Table VI. Alike the light system, there are also some 
particular context situations related to energy saving. The 
first one is when there is no person inside the waiting room 
and it’s not office hours so the cooler/heater system should 
be set off. The other ones are when there is no person inside 
the waiting room and its office hours so the system should 
set the cooler/heater on its minimum energy consumption 
mode, which is shown in Table VII.

TABLE IV.  
CONTEXT-AWARE LIGHT SYSTEM CONFIGURATION 
 
TABLE V.  
ENERGY SAVING MODE OF THE LIGHT SYSTEM 
 
The entertainment system composed of the TV or 
music/radio player is triggered whenever the system 
perceives at least one person seated in the waiting room. 
Otherwise, it should be set off both during office hours or out 
of office hours in order to save energy as mentioned in Table 
VIII. 
The above tables of possible appliances configuration 
will form the training set for a naïve Bayes classifier chosen 
as a machine learning technique for the context-aware 
services adaptation of the smart waiting room. The Bayesian 
Classification represents a supervised learning method as 
well as a statistical method for classification. For each new 
sample they provide a probability that the sample belongs to 
a class. Training is very easy and fast, no need for 
complicated training process as in neural networks. Naïve 
Bayes is fast and space efficient. It can provide an optimal 
decision making system even in presence of violating 
independence assumption. We have used the free machine 
learning 
tool 
Waikato 
Environment 
for 
Knowledge 
Analysis(WEKA) [17] to implement the context-aware 
adaptation system.

In order to make a principal step toward our system 
validation, we performed three series of tests. Each one is 
composed of ten possible context situations. We have got 
satisfactory results with acceptance rate of 92%. Such rate 
was very encouraging.

Context-awareness could enormously improve the 
quality of services for smart spaces. It helps to provide 
proactive services which enhance both user's comfort and

energy saving. The most important task in building context-
aware systems consists of defining the context in a clear 
manner and establish its components. In this paper, we have 
proposed a context-aware services adaptation for a particular 
smart space namely smart waiting room using the naive

a lot the energy saving in such space in addition to 
improving person comfort. Our future work consists of 
applying the same approach for other types of smart spaces, 
such as smart office, smart classroom, etc.
