Abstract — Solving decision-making problems often depends
on
the
use
of
methods
for
multi-criteria
evaluation
of
alternatives.
Generally, the challenge relies on the ability to
structure long-term goals, while establishing accurate criteria
matrices and weights for assessing alternatives. Complexity
increases when preference functions become important to
define global utilities or determine final rankings. This topic is
of high importance for the policy making process, where
decisions result from group-thinking and collective processes.
Therefore, high levels of subjectivity are associated with the
decision process, typically reflected in preferences and options.
The application of different software tools or multi-criteria
decision-making methods can lead to non-identical outputs.
Collective decisions result from aggregation metrics and
weighing procedures. This paper discusses the balances of
individual and collective decisions, based on the rational choice
theory and the shift to behavioural economics. Subsequently,
data from decision-making in real practice supports the debate
on the use of multi-criteria methods.
Keywords - Decision-making; Decision theory; Multi-criteria
methods; Preferences; Governance; Policy making.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Governance arrangements recall a response to direct and
hierarchical models. In addition, they show that, among the
forms of governance, it is fundamental to deal with the
behaviour of the various actors involved in the decision
process,
either
through
cooperation,
partnerships
or
networking. Inevitably, new types of management and
coordination tools emerge, and changes occur leading to the
adaptation of organizational models, and integration of
different logics of public service delivery. Public decisions
are no longer considered to be totally dependent on
hierarchically organized structures and are defined by the
interaction of a diverse set of organizations located at
different territorial levels [1]. The theory of institutional
logics suggests that decisions and outcomes reflect the
interaction between individual behaviour and institutional
structures; so, individuals and organizations can look for the
power, status and economic advantages, as well as their
means and ends to respond to their interests, but both are
dependent on the institutional logics [2]. Thus, institutions
are expected to meet the demands of collective decision-
making in increasingly complex circumstances. In this
specific context, the need to articulate the multiplicity of
agents and interests in the pursuit of common goals is at the
basis of the development of decision support strategies.
There is a blind will to provide collective results, neglecting
the
basis
and
meaning
of
individual
placement
and
preferences. Decision theories find theoretical and empirical
evidence since the seventeenth century, supporting either a
rational perspective to explain complex decision-making
contexts, or providing complementary research to understand
the behavioural mechanisms of individuals and, therefore,
deal with the errors and biases of reasoning [3]–[5].
This paper is structured in four sections, besides the
Introduction. First, decision-making is framed within the
public policy process, focusing on the challenges deriving
from governance arrangements. Group decision-making
plays a key role as individual decision heuristics, preferences
and expectations meet collective purposes and goals. The
rational choice theory and the shift to behavioural economics
frames this debate. In real (policy) decision-making contexts
multi-criteria methods are used to structure and organize
priorities among
alternatives;
thus, a short review is
presented.
The
paper
follows
with
a
comparison
of
individual and collective outcomes by applying different
aggregation metrics and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making
(MCDM) methods to a real decision-making problem.
Finally, conclusions focus on the main findings and further
research recommendations.
II.
PUBLIC POLICY AND DECISION-MAKING
Governance does not mean the end of politics, but its
practice in a context of broader interaction subject to a game
of cooperation and conflict across all institutions and actors
of government arrangements. Within these arrangements
institutions are required to develop a couple of interrelated
steps: i) to establish a consensual and strategic vision based
on stakeholders’ motivations, preferences and expectations;
ii) to structure decision processes towards priorities; and iii)
to
develop
effective
coordination
mechanisms
in
the
integration and regulation of the process [6]. This complexity
discloses the notion that decisions reflect the functioning of
various decision heuristics, which include decision rules,
logical reasoning structures, and value systems [3][4][7].
Thus, decision-making is often associated with high degrees
of uncertainty and complexity, resulting from the limited
resources, multiple actors with (conflicting) motivations and
preferences. Individual or collective choices are made from a
set of alternatives, which can change over time or when
subject to different evaluation criteria. Gowda and Fox [8]
remind other scholars who strived to understand how
people’s
choices
operate
under
conditions
of
high
uncertainty and risk, and conclude that people do have a
systematic way to achieve their decisions and choices.
During decision-making, certain heuristics or rules of thumb

are followed, moving away from the typical rational decision
process advocated and used by economists (see, for e.g., the
works [3][7]). Even though preferences are assumed to be
determined by different utilities and probabilities, and one
can assume that people choose to maximize expected utilities
[9][10], individuals do not always have all the information,
or
the
ability
to
process,
manage
and
evaluate
the
consequences of their final options [4]. In addition, other
cognitive, normative and motivational elements that delimit
and characterize the individual and collective behaviour
explain behaviour patterns [3][11].
Group decision-making is a topic of major interest. Roy
[12] refers to the comprehensive dimension of decision, as
the decision results from the interactions among individuals,
entities, communities and the conflicts of their preferences.
Regardless the individual perspective of a decision, when
placed in the policymaking process, it is shaped by specific
information
systems,
behaviours
and
organizational
structures. There is a challenging effort to balance the
relations between actors involved in the decision process,
ranging from the alternative definition to the combination of
preferences. The perception of alternatives and decision-
making depends on a set of sociological and psychological
factors, often dealt with communication techniques and
strategies. Concepts such as agenda setting, framing and
priming mirror this complexity, as they describe how
different groups, with different degrees of power, interact
and define the political debate and, consequently, contribute
to the construction of the political agenda. In what concerns
decisions, the problem particularly consists in assessing the
option’s feasibility, risks and consequences, where setting
the wrong priorities may imply inefficient use of available
resources and opportunity costs [13]. Indeed, the discussion
on the decision-making process within the public policy
formation can be multifaceted as you concern, for instances,
the organization of all related steps of the decision process;
the selection and design of decision techniques and models;
the knowledge background, potential bias, interactions and
system-thinking
of
individuals
during
decision-making
moments.
The following section intends to capture two basic
elements: i) the actors and their relations during decision
processes and ii) the need of decision support tools able to
deal with the complexity related with the patterns of
behaviour, rules or structures.
III.
DECISION THEORY AND METHODS IN PRACTICE
A.
Rational choice and behavioural economics
Good policy decisions depend on both recognizing the
importance of multilevel governance for pursuing micro
level goals, by structuring integrated programs grounded in
external strategic frameworks, and considering the possible
evolution of exogenous factors.
These decisions require
policy coordination and territorial governance strategies,
often using decision support tools. The concept of decision
support systems has accommodated multiple perspectives,
suggesting
the
combination
of
generic
and
technical
principals to respond to the decision design of governance
arrangements involving a diversity of social actors and
sectorial perspectives. Empirical and theoretical findings are
set on the readings of the research of [14]–[19]. As these
studies show, decision problems are context-dependent and
there is no universal choice pattern to apply. Besides
subjective and asymmetric information issues, choices and
preferences are subject to great uncertainty and inaccuracy,
for which the cognitive characteristics of individuals and the
social, institutional and economic structures play a key role.
Moreover, to explain such diversity and complexity,
since the 17th century, decision theory has covered rigorous
mathematical and quantitative assumptions, defending its
rational foundation, and supported other approaches focused
on the cognitive basis of human behaviour, analysing the
meaning of heuristics and bias [4][7][14][20]–[23]. We
believe that the complex equilibrium between individual and
group decisions requires both descriptive assumptions and
rationalist components. The standard view of traditional
microeconomic theory explains human behaviour by using
rational choice, therefore, following principles such as
unbounded rationality and self-interest. At the basis is the
assumption
of
an
optimization
approach,
subject
to
consistent criterion assessment. Individual preferences and
choices,
however,
seem
to
be
much
more
complex.
Understanding how and why individuals decide in one way
or another underpins psychological and socio-cognitive
insights. These questions seem to be captured by behavioural
economics studies. This balance of socio-cognitive and
rational aspects are somehow present in the work of Mathis
et al [24], who present individual and social decisions based
on key assumptions and theoretical foundations of rational
choice and behavioural economics, for which preferences
and restrictions are placed in a debate of maximization of
individual and social utility. A variety of studies evidence the
characteristics of decision makers and encounter several
modelling choice mechanisms to deal with heuristic decision
rules, (un)predictable behaviour patterns, typical decision
routines, preferences (stated and revealed) and self-oriented
motivations
[3][4][7][25][26].
Research
has
evolved
providing
insights
on
linking
cognitive
and
social
psychology to shed light on how individuals and groups deal
in decision contexts (interesting reading on this matter are
[3][11][27]). Cognitive and behavioural biases are extremely
important to understand decision outputs. However, there is
no unified approach regarding the link between socio-
cognitive aspects and decision-making; though, efforts
towards
modelling
frameworks
grounded
on
multiple
economic, behavioural and cognitive theories are identified,
as well as attempts on applying theories of situated cognition
and social cognition (see [26][28]–[32]).
In this paper, the rational and socio-cognitive decision-
making assumptions are narrowly presented, as these require
the
combination of
multiple
preferences,
choices
and
decisions and encounter technical challenges for the design
of decision strategies and tools (Table I).
A set of key assumptions and analytic dimensions are put
through the above-mentioned aspects. This paper discusses
the preference formation process while dealing with the

Multi-criteria methods
The
following
considerations
lie
on
multi-criteria
analysis, based on the assumption that it allows preference
relations by combining different assessment on quantitative
and qualitative criteria. With rational and/or behavioural
guidelines, the decision problem focuses on choosing (most
appropriate alternative), ranking (differentiating worst and
best
options)
and
sorting
(from
a
list
of
plausible
possibilities) [33]. Some methods enable defining admissible
decisions while encountering uncertainties about current or
future impacts [34]. A common characteristic of multi-
criteria decision-making methods is the evaluation of options
by comparing several alternatives, based on individual or
collective assessments on several, and perhaps conflicting,
criteria. The best alternative derives from the aggregation of
all evaluations and comparisons. As Sabaei et al. [35] advise,
different
types
of
problems
suggest
the
design
and
application of adequate methods, whose selection should
result on expert’s judgments or any other technical restraints.
Amongst the most well-cited and common methods used
in publications are the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process),
the ELECTRE (elimination ET choix traduisant la realite),
TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to
Ideal Solution), SAW (Simple Additive Weighting), and
PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization METHod
for Enrichment of Evaluations) [35]–[39]. Generally, these
methods include different outranking methods, possibility of
combining qualitative and quantitative data, and ability to
deal with uncertainty.

ANALYSING INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE
PREFERENCES DURING PUBLIC POLICY FORMULATION
A.
Decision-making in real practice
This section presents how AHP was used to structure
group decision-making during a strategic municipal plan.
The
AHP,
in
comparison
with
other
methods,
was
considered the more prevalent rank order weighting method
due to both its theoretical and application simplicity. This
method was developed by Saaty [40], which decomposition
principle requires the comparison of pairs of various
elements that structure the decision process, allowing
ranking
the
various
elements,
evaluating
the
relative
importance of alternatives and clarifying prioritization.
To derive and synthesize priorities, the criteria followed a
hierarchical structure, further evaluated based on pairwise
comparisons with a relative scale. Once individual priorities
were obtained, the responses of the various participants were
combined to build a collective choice pattern. In practical
problems, given people's different positions on the same
options (criteria, alternatives, etc.), from which strong
convictions and contrasting valuations may arise, reciprocal
assumption plays an important role for the collective
outcome. As theoretically described by Saaty [41], the
decisions must be combined so that the reciprocal of the
aggregate responses is equal to the inverse synthesis of these
responses. In other words, if a/b = c/d, then b/c=d/c. Thus, no
category or answer prevails over the set of options. A key
debate issue regards to the consistency of the individual
answers. During pairwise comparison, inconsistent answers
might appear. In extreme cases this inconsistency may lead
to rejection of the answers. This happens in situations where
71

if A> B and B> C, then C≤A; If the answer is A> B, B> C 
and C> A, then the answer set is inconsistent. In order to
solve problems of logical inconsistency, a control value (R2)
was
defined,
sensitive
to
random
responses,
to
the
mismatches resulting from the scale used and to the
subjectivity that this type of exercise involves. The control
value was tested and adjusted to real-context circumstances,
as the application of the original recommended by Saaty, did
not conform to human reasoning and its capacity for
information processing. Wolf et al. [42] and Nogueira et al.
[43] further explain this application of AHP ( which was
applied to four strategic plans: 3 municipalities and 1

tourism
development
association).
Generally
following AHP assumptions’, the alternative classification
resulted from the combination of scores (detailed matching
of alternatives within criteria) and weights (resulting from
public processes) – the output is shown in Tables III and IV.

Methods and possible non-identical outcomes
1)
Preference aggregation
As reminded by Wang et. al. [44], multi-criteria methods
rely on criteria selection, weighting, evaluation, and final
aggregation. They suggest three categories of weighting
methods i) subjective weighting, ii) objective weighting and
iii) combination weighting methods and point several
methods based on weighted sum, priority setting, outranking,
fuzzy set methodology. Such statement supports the multiple
perspectives leading to different outputs, which change what
was initially considered a collective decision. Thus, the
following are discussed 1. the collective outcomes by
assessing to what extent individual weights when using
different aggregation metrics deviate from the results; and 2.
the priorities when using other multi-criteria methods.
The use of arithmetic or geometric means, for example,
changes the results. The interest in this comparison results
from the application of the geometric mean in contexts
where it is necessary to obtain an aggregation of items
classified with different scales. Although it is not an issue of
different scales, criteria vary in number of sub-criteria.
Additionally,
the
scores
matrix,
which
classifies
the
alternatives in each criterion, has different numerical ranges.
It is, therefore, debatable an overestimation of an alternative
or criterion deriving from the application of the arithmetic
mean.
Another
discussion
around
the
aggregation
of
preferences refers to the way in which these are initially
evaluated: ordinal, pairwise or cardinal choice. Although the
data collected (pairwise) was adjusted to transform the final
(and normalized) weights into an ordinal choice matrix, such
was not conducted. It would remain unjustified whether
potential divergences resulted from the method or from the
way judgment is structured in one case or another (such
validation would be impossible). Instead, the results were
compared with those that would occur with the application of
the cardinal choice method. Since the most voted can also be
the most rejected, how divergent can the results be?
For decision support purposes, a combined reflection of
the information that results from the comparison of real
results when subjected to calculations of arithmetic and
geometric means, as well as cardinal classification, is
relevant. The results show that in more general criteria
(therefore, more subjective) extreme values seem more
accurate, while in-between values require greater attention.
In general, sub-criteria concern to specific issues, where
preference
matrices
evidence
greater
disparity
among
options. For analytical and decision support purposes
considering other coefficients and dispersion indexes are
suggested to consolidate the analysis (e.g. Herfindahl-
Hirschman index, Theil index localization and specialization
coefficients).
2)
Scores, weights and multi-criteria decision methods
In general, a multi-criteria problem is performed by
defining criteria, alternatives and the link between both. The
criteria are valued to prioritize alternatives. As previously
mentioned, there is a wide range of methods, whose
assumptions of normalization and ordering differ. This work
contributes to this debate by demonstrating how these
methods can influence decisions made in a real context.
Despite the need to shape the input data to run the MCDM
methods, its homogenization was ensured, reducing possible
bias in the conclusions drawn. The selection of SAW,
TOPSIS and ELECTRE is due to their similarity regarding
the use of matrices of scores and weights, without having to
tamper the actual data. Some scale correction procedures
were, however, necessary. PROMETHEE rankings were not

calculated due to the inability to match real data to
preferences, indifferences and incomparability.
The comparable ranking results (Table V) are consistent
with the most and least relevant alternatives. The AHP, SAW
and TOPSIS allow to infer relative importance, under
different analytical perspectives. The AHP is via the scale
used for comparisons; SAW is due to the additive weighting

indicator,
comparing each alternative with best and worst ideal ones.
The ELECTRE does not allow this differentiation and, in
this case, it presented transitivity problems (Table VI).

CONCLUSION
Typically, the conceptual and mathematical background
of multi-criteria decision methods is based on examples
describing alternatives with objective criteria (e.g. choosing
printers or selecting candidates for a job). It is frequently
used in the entrepreneurial context, where the type of
problems dealt with allows greater objectivity of the input
data. The focus is often on maximizing utility functions,
reducing
costs,
optimizing
production
or
processes.
Operational research has contributed to the development of
decision support systems that fulfil these purposes. Although
dealing with and articulating multiple criteria are a concern
in these approaches, the policy-making context opens other
debates. Groups are put together to define action plans, based
on
priorities
fulfilling
strategic
development
paths.
Understanding individual and collective positioning is a key
aspect to support and toughen the decisions. The study on
MCDM evidences solid knowledge on structuring priorities,
but a lack of coverage on the aggregation of responses. As
well, the weight assignment process is described in AHP, but
in the other MCDM methods it is assumed as an input data
(not deriving from the methods’ procedures). While focusing
on alternatives, few is said about the combination of scores
and weights. Thus, efforts were made to comply with the
methods’ requirements. The simplicity of MCDM methods is
an advantage for its application; however, the difficulty of
adjusting them to real decision contexts limits their potential.
As explained, the complexity of decision in real practice
motivated the adjustment of AHP original assumptions.
To conclude, in addition to those presented, testing
aggregate differences based on other ways of collecting
preferences is not possible, as the original pairwise data is
not prepared for this purpose. This work does not emphasis
all assumptions and key analytical dimensions theoretically
discussed. It focuses on some of the identified problems,
such
as transitivity and
the
use of decision
support
instruments to overcome the rational limited capacity.
Moreover, it opens path to discuss the need to adjust the
parameters of the models and methods used, as verified in
the real context of application of the AHP.
This work provides an analytic framework, extensible to
other cases, allowing to compare and assess the sensitivity
and robustness of the results and methods. The apparent
consistency at the extremes of the priorities (most and less
valued alternatives) suggests the need to consider other
decision approaches to tune how intermediate values are
calculated. Additional testing by reducing alternatives or the
number of criteria can change these conclusions. Further
research topics go for explaining how decision makers deal
with uncertainty and how groups influence individual
decisions. The use of foresight techniques supports the
discussion about the methods that allow dealing with
uncertainty, in a more or less objective manner (projections,
estimates or scenario analysis, as suggested by Borges et al.
[45] and Marques et al. [46][47]). Finally, research on group-
thinking brings an additional layer to the decision theory.
The preferences of decision maker’s ex-ante and ex-post
collective debate can derive. Explaining this shift based on
(socio) cognitive indicators is, as well, useful for supporting
decision processes.
