Abstract—This paper analyzes the performance of a new DVB-
S2 system. The standard outer Bose-Chaudhuri-Hoquenghem 
encoder is substituted with a Reed-Solomon (204, 188) encoder 
in order to analyze and possibly improve the system 
performances. Simulation for analyzing the communication 
quality is designed via Matlab and Simulink. The results are 
compared with results from the existing DVB-S2 model. The 
new model with the Reed-Solomon outer encoder shows better 
performances: when noise reaches a level where the existing 
model gains no quasi-error free performance, the new DVB-S2 
model shows a quasi-error-free communication.

 INTRODUCTION  
DVB-S2 is the second generation specification for 
satellite broadcasting and part of the European standard, the 
EN 302 307 [1]. The new combination of a sophisticated 
coding scheme based on the low-density parity-check, LDPC 
inner codes concatenated with the Bose-Chaudhuri-
Hoquenghem (BCH) outer codes allows a quasi-error-free 
operation very near the Shannon limit [2], spectral capacity 
increase by 30-35% over the DVB-S standard for a given 
symbol rate and carrier to noise ratio is accomplished with 
modulation and coding schemes of higher order [3]. The 
DVB-S2 system was designed for high definition television, 
interactive applications like 
Internet 
navigation 
etc. 
providing them the best transmission performance, total 
flexibility and receiver with reasonable complexity [4]. 
In 
an 
earlier 
work 
[5], 
we 
designed 
simple 
communication models designed for analyzing influence of 
different model parameters on communication quality. These 
simulations showed that models perform better when the 
message is coded with the Reed-Solomon code over the 
BCH code. Therefore, the idea is to substitute the existing 
BCH code in the DVB-S2 model with the Reed-Solomon 
code in order to test the communication quality after 
substitution. Simulation is made using Matlab/Simulink.  
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
the bases of Reed-Solomon encoder and its implementation 
in the new DVB-S2 model based on the Reed-Solomon outer 
encoder. In Section III, the simulation models of both, the 
standard and the new DVB-S2 systems are given. Simulation 
results are presented in Section IV and Section V concludes 
the paper.  
 
II. 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
A simplified model of the DVB-S2 transmitter is given in 
Figure 1. The model is based on two codes: the outer BCH 
code and the inner LDPC code. The binary message of 
length k’ (generated with the bit generator) is encoded into a 
BCH codeword of length n’. The BCH code is a multilevel 
cyclic variable-length digital error-correcting code used to 
correct multiple random error patterns [4].  
The BCH codeword is sent to the LDPC outer encoder 
and treated as a message of length k=n’ to be encoded into a 
n-bit-long systematic LDPC codeword. The LDPC codes are 
type of error-correcting codes presented with a large sparse 
parity-check matrix H of the size M×N. The sparse matrix is 
defined with the number of ones, ωr<<N in every row and 
the number of ones in every columns, ωc<<M   [6], [7]. The 
parity-check matrix may be written as:

sparse matrix and H2 is defined with equation (2). Since the 
low-density parity-check codes are mostly extended irregular 
repeat-accumulate codes (eIRA) [8], the encoding can be 
done via the parity-check matrix with linear complexity by 
noting:

where c is the codeword [9]. This has to be solved for parity 
bits recursively [10].  
According to the DVB-S2 standard [1], the codeword 
may be of length n= 64800 or n=16200 referencing the 
normal and the short frame messages. The ratio k/n at the 
LDPC encoder defines the code rate of system. The DVB-S2 
standard defines eleven different code rates for the normal 
frame messages: 9/10, 8/9, 5/6, 4/5, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 1/2, 2/5, 
1/3 and 1/4. Short frames are suitable for all the same code 
rates, except for rate 9/10 [1]. 
The coded message is modulated onto a carrier via the 
QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK or the 32APSK modulation 
depending on application area. Gray mapping is used for 
QPSK (Figure 2) and 8PSK modulation schemes [1]. 
  Reed-Solomon codes showed to be suitable when 
mentioned burst errors occur. This paper presents a new 
DVB-S2 system where the BCH encoder is substituted with 
the Reed-Solomon coder (Figure 3). 
With the Reed-Solomon code, the bits are grouped into 
symbols, instead of being encoded directly in bits. The data 
words and code words are encoded in these symbols.__ 
The Reed-Solomon code is specified as RS (n’, k’) and 
every Reed-Solomon symbol has s bits. The code takes k’ 
original-message-symbols and encodes it into n’ symbols. 
The number of redundant bits is n’-k’ and they are not part of 
the message itself but are sent through the channel to protect 
the useful message. The number of possible codewords is 
2N, but only 2K contain data words. The rest of the 
codewords are not contributing to the message and are 
redundant.  
If errors occur, there is a high probability that they will 
convert the permissible code words into one of the redundant 
words that the decoder at the receiver is designed to 
recognize as an error [11]. The number of symbol errors that 
may be corrected, t is defined:  
 
2t = n’ – k’. 
 
 
(5) 
The Reed-Solomon code may detect and correct a corrupted 
symbol with a single bit errors as it can a symbol with all its 
bits in error, meaning that the Reed-Solomon code is suitable 
for correcting burst errors [4].  
The DVB code is the Reed-Solomon (204, 188) code 
using 8-bit symbols [12]. The Reed-Solomon (204, 188) is 
the shortened code, from the original Reed-Solomon (255, 
239) code and it will be applied to each randomized transport 
packet (of 188 bytes) to generate an error protected packet. 
The Reed-Solomon code adds the parity bytes after the 
information bytes of the transport packets (Figure 4). In 
DVB standards, the Reed-Solomon code can correct up to 8 
erroneous bytes per packet.  
III. 
SIMULATION MODEL 
Our simulation model is based on implemented DVB-S2 
simulation in Matlab; command ‘commdvbs2’ (Figure 5).   
Before simulating the existing model, simulation and 
system parameters will be chosen. The user has to define the 
code rate as well as the modulation scheme prior starting 
simulation. The simulation takes the 188 bytes long random 
binary sequence generated by using the Bernoulli generator 
(packet sourced) as its input. The message is sent through an 
AWGN channel and received at the receiver, demodulated 
and decoded. The bit error rate, BER is calculated after the 
low-density parity-check code block and the packet error, 
PER is calculated after the outer Reed-Solomon code block. 
Additionally, the simulation provides the constellation 
diagram for particular communication model.  
Our DVB-S2 model is presented in Figure 3 and its 
Matlab realization in Figure 5. The simulation used only the 
quadrature phase shift keying modulation scheme (Figure 2). 
The code rates may be set to any code rate supported by the 
DVB-S2 standard, as listed in Section II.

Figure 5.      The DVB-S2 Matlab simulation models with BCH or Reed-Solomon outer encoder.  
 
The message to be sent is generated via the random bit 
generator. The generated bits are encoded by the Reed-
Solomon (204, 188) encoder. The Reed-Solomon encoder 
adds 16 parity bytes after the information bits (Figure 4) of 
the transport packets. The transport packet after the Reed-
Solomon encoding is 204 bytes long. According to (5), the 
described Reed-Solomon code may correct up to 8 bytes in 
one packet. The Reed-Solomon coded message is led to the 
low-density parity-check code block to be encoded.     
The maximum number of iterations is set to 50 [1], 
meaning that the simulation will stop after 50 iterations if the 
encoded message is not calculated.   
The codeword is defined to be of length n=64800 [1].  
The encoded message is sent through the Gaussian 
channel with added white noise meaning that there is only 
one main path, without any delays. The channel should be 
quasi-error-free (with BER<10-7) after the outer encoder; 
after the BCH for the DVB-S2 and the RS outer encoder for 
the new DVB-S2. In one case, BER falls below 10e-7 and 
one burst of erroneous bits passed the outer encoder.  
At the receiver’s side, the received message is 
demodulated via the QPSK demodulator.  
After demodulation, the information is sent to the low-
density parity-check decoder. The decoding is based on the 
concept of belief propagation. It is an iterative process where 
the   information of the received bits is refined iteration by 
iteration [13].  The maximal number of iteration is set to 50 
[1].  
The Reed-Solomon decoder performs the outer decoding 
of message and results in information bits generated at the 
binary generator (with or without any errors).  
For every simulation, the constellation graph is plotted. 
The bit error rate is calculated as well as the packet error 
rate. The communication quality may be analyzed by 
comparing the gained bit error rates and packet error rates for 
different signal to noise ratios.  
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
Simulation results are gained with simulation models 
developed with Matlab and Simulink and described before.  
Simulation results are calculated for the implemented 
DVB-S2 Simulink model and for the presented new DVB-S2 
model based on the Reed-Solomon outer coding. The type of 
chosen Reed-Solomon encoder is the Reed-Solomon (204, 
188) encoder meaning that the data words of 188 symbols 
are mapped into code words with length of 204 symbols 
(Figure 4). The code is designed to correct up to t = 8 symbol 
errors. The QPSK modulation is chosen. The FEC rates are 
variable for each simulation. The results are calculated for 
different noise levels. The first is the noise level where the 
bit error rate has a quasi-error-free value at the implemented 
DVB-S2 model. The second is the nearest noise level where 
bit error rate has no quasi-error-free value; the bit error rate 
begins to be less than the minimum allowed value. The third 
noise level is the noise level where the modified DVB-S2 
model shows no quasi-error-free value.

Tables 1 – 5 contain representative results from five 
different simulations.  
Table 1 shows that the implemented model of the DVB-S2 
system performs quasi-error-free until Es/N0 reaches the level 
of Es/N0 = -2.53 dB. When Es/N0 = -2.54 dB the bit error rate 
is no more quasi-error-free and the system is not performing 
well. The third row in Table 1 presents the performance of 
the new DVB-S2 model at this SNR. It is shown that the new 
DVB-S2 model performs quasi-error-free even at Es/N0 = -
2.54 dB. Therefore, at same SNR the new DVB-S2 model 
shows better performances. The last row in Table 1 shows 
that substitution of BCH encoder with Reed-Solomon 
encoder does not improve the system significantly since the 
new DVB-S2 model gained a non quasi-error-free 
performance at noise level of Es/N0 = -2.653 dB.

Table 2 contains simulation results for the QPSK with a 
code rate of r = 1/3. The implemented model performs well 
with Es/N0 of Es/N0 ≥ -1.40 dB. When Es/N0 becomes lower 
the system has no quasi-error-free performance any more. It 
is shown that our model has an allowed bit error rate even 
with this noise level. Table 2 shows that with Es/N0 = -1.40 
dB the system has a quasi-error-free bit error rate.  
Table 3 shows simulation results for the QPSK with the 
code rate r  = 1/2.  The level of noise of Es/N0 = 0.85 dB has 
a bit error rate of satisfactory value. When the noise level 
becomes higher in system, the model shows a non-error free 
performance. Again, the new model has a quasi-error-free bit 
error rate, showing that the Reed-Solomon code could 
protect more bits from noise interference.  
Table 4, showing the simulation results for the QPSK 2/3 
leads to same conclusion, the new DVB-S2 model with an 
outer Reed-Solomon (204, 188) code performs quasi-error-
free at noise level where the implemented model gained an 
unsatisfactory performance.  
Table 5 contains the bit error rates for the QPSK 3/4. 
Again, the new model performed quasi-error-free in 
surrounding (Es/N0 = 3.94) where the implemented DVB-S2 
model based on the BCH gained an unsatisfactory results.

Simulation results may be analyzed via the constellation 
graph every simulation resulted with. A representative 
example of such graphical system performance analyzes is 
given in Figure 6 and 7. Figure 6 shows the constellation 
graph for the QPSK 1/4 for the already existing and for the 
new DVB-S2 model. The results show that the new model 
performs better since the dots are not so dispersed as they are 
at the constellation graph for the existing DVB-S2 model.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
This paper presented a new DVB-S2 model based on the 
Reed-Solomon outer coding since Reed-Solomon code 
showed to be resistant to burst errors.  The type of chosen 
Reed-Solomon code is the Reed-Solomon (204, 188) code. 
The Reed-Solomon (204, 188) code maps the data words of 
188 symbols into code words with length of 204 symbols. 
This code can correct up to 8 symbol errors.  
Simulation model for the new DVB-S2 is designed with 
Matlab. Simulation results of the new DVB-S2 model are 
compared with results gained with an existing DVB-S2 
model in Matlab.  
The results show that our new DVB-S2 model with the 
Reed-Solomon (204, 188) code performed better than the 
existing DVB-S2 model with the BCH outer coding. At 
Es/N0 level, where the existing model gained a non-quasi-
error-free performance, the new DVB-S2 model showed 
better results and a quasi-error-free bit error rate.  
The negative aspect of the use of the Reed-Solomon code 
is a much higher complexity of the Reed-Solomon decoder 
as compared to the BCH decoder.
