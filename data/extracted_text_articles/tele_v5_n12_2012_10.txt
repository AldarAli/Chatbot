Abstract—There are several different factors that affect the 
perceived quality of 3D content. Our objective in this paper is 
to investigate how the global and local change of brightness in 
a scene will affect the overall 3D visual perception. Our work 
contains two studies: 1) global change of brightness, which is 
achieved by setting different exposure times on the camera, 
and 2) local change of brightness, where the brightness of the 
background is consistent and the object’s brightness is 
changed using an external light source and/or a reflector disk. 
Subjective evaluations were performed, with the subjects being 
asked to rate the 3D perceptual quality of each sequence. The 
results of both studies demonstrate marginal difference in the 
brightness effects between 3D and 2D videos.  The latter study 
showed that the Weber contrast between objects of interest 
and background should be within the range of -0.35 to 0.55 to 
provide viewers with high quality 3D experience.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, 3D video has received increased attention 
among investors, researchers and technology developers. 
The introduction of 3D TV can only be a lasting success if 
the perceived image quality provides a significant step up 
from the conventional 2D television, while maintaining the 
same viewing comfort. The availability of high quality 3D 
content will also be a key factor to this success. Recoding 3D 
content – let alone high quality - is much more demanding 
and challenging than 2D video. In general, 3D content 
production needs different considerations and provisions 
beside the ones found in the conventional 2D video 
production to guarantee high quality of the produced content 
and the comfort of viewers. 
There are many factors and parameters that could affect 
the perceptual quality of 3D media. While the effects of 
different acquisition parameters on 3D perception have been 
studied before, their influence on the perceived quality has 
not been quantitatively assessed. More research and studies 
are required in order to improve our understanding of 
different factors that affect the viewers' perception of 3D 
video content. This knowledge will allow us to capture high 
quality 3D content that may help reduce or even eliminate 
the visual discomfort of the viewers and thus improve the 
overall quality of experience.  To this end, the study by 
Pourazad et al. (CONTENT 2011) quantitatively investigates 
the effect of contrast (local brightness-change) on the visual 
quality of 3D content [1]. Scene detail has also been noted to 
affect the visual comfort and quality of 3D content [1]. 
Goldmann et al. has addressed the effect that the distance 
between stereo cameras has on the perceptual quality of the 
captured videos [3]. The relation between the distance of the 
object(s) of interest from the camera and the quality of the 
perceived images when watched on different size displays 
has been investigated by Xu et al. [4].  
Content producers recognize contrast and brightness as 
some of the important factors in capturing 3D content and 
based on their practical experience they suggest using higher 
light settings for capturing 3D videos compared to 2D ones 
[5]. In physiological studies it has been found that there is a 
relationship between contrast and the human visual depth 
perception [6]. In this paper, we perform a systematic study 
on the effect of the global and local brightness-change on the 
visual quality of 3D content, and compare it to that of 2D. 
This study is the extension of our previous work on the effect 
of local brightness change (contrast) on 3D visual perception 
[1]. 
The objective of this study is two fold: first to provide 
guidelines for adjusting brightness levels during 3D 
capturing in order to offer the best 3D quality of experience; 
second to determine how these levels differ from the case of 
2D video and use this knowledge as a guideline for capturing 
3D content. In our study we investigate the effect of both 
global and local brightness-change on the perceptual quality 
of 3D content. We first examine the scenario where the 
brightness of the whole scene is altered (change of global 
brightness). Global brightness-change can be achieved by 
setting different exposure times on the camera. In the second 
part of our work only the brightness of the object(s) of 
interest is altered and the brightness of the rest of the scene 
stays relatively unchanged (change of local brightness). This 
can be achieved using a light source or reflector disks. Since 
there is no standardized set of 3D or 2D video clips that 
record the same (sufficiently similar) scene in different 
brightness/contrast levels, for both of these scenarios, we 
decided to capture outdoor and indoor scenes for our test.  
Note that synthetic videos are not practical in our study. 
Simply changing the brightness or contrast of a recorded 
video is a lossy process and the resulting videos may have 
unwanted artifacts, which will hamper the 3D perception. 
Once the test videos are captured we perform extensive 
subjective quality assessment experiments to quantify the

perceived quality of the 3D experience at different levels of 
global and local brightness. Understanding both of these 
scenarios will allow us to thoroughly identify criteria related 
to brightness for enhancing the viewers' 3D quality of 
experience.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II 
describes the experimental setup and discusses the results of 
the global brightness-change experiment, Section III 
provides the details of our subjective evaluations for the 
local brightness-change case, and conclusions are drawn in 
Section IV. 
  
II. 
EXPERIMENT ONE –  GLOBAL CHANGE OF 
BRIGHTNESS 
In this section, we investigate the effect of global 
brightness on the perceptual quality of 3D content and 
compare it with that of 2D video. In this case, the captured 
brightness of the background and that of the object are 
changed 
simultaneously. 
The 
following 
subsections 
elaborate on the details of our experiment. 
A. Capturing Setup 
To capture test video sequences we use two identical full 
HD cameras (Sony HDR-XR500V 1080 60i NTSC) with 
baseline distance of 9cm. Fig. 1 shows the stereo camera 
setup used in our experiment. We used the same settings on 
both cameras, which were aligned in parallel and attached to 
a bar that was custom-made for this purpose. Subsequently, 
the bar was secured to a tripod. Since zoom lenses may differ 
[5], only the extreme ends of the zoom range were used to 
avoid any zoom correction post-processing. We set the 
cameras to manual mode with ISO equal to 100 and we 
disabled face-detection, and the backlight compensation 
mode. Note that the camera setup and configuration is more 
complex in the case of 3D video recording and stereoscopic 
geometry and camera calibration require special attention 
[7].  
In order to secure temporal synchronization of the two 
cameras, a single remote control was employed to activate 
both of them at the same time instance. The temporal 
synchronization of the video sequences is further confirmed 
in the post-processing phase. We checked the left and the 
right views of each captured video sequence on a frame-by-
frame basis and ensured that the two views are temporally 
aligned. Even though the cameras are carefully lined up, the 
recorded videos may require rectification to compensate for 
vertical, horizontal and rotational misalignments that can 
hamper the perceptual quality of 3D content.  
We set the exposure adjustment of the cameras on the 
manual mode and capture each scene using several different 
exposure levels. When recording each exposure level, to 
guarantee that brightness is the only varying parameter, we 
ensure that the scene relatively stays unchanged in terms of 
content, object motion and camera movement. This 
guarantees the consistency needed in our comparisons. The 
exposure levels are chosen between sufficiently bright to 
sufficiently dark levels; the number of steps varies depending 
on the brightness of the scene that is captured. Note that 
since our cameras do not provide a numerical value for the 
exposure setting, we divided the exposure range (under 
expose to over expose) to 6 equal steps for the indoor scenes 
and 8 equal steps for the outdoor scenes by counting the 
number of steps on the camera. As expected, outdoor scenes 
captured during the daytime allow for a wider range of 
exposures. 
B. Subjective Evaluation 
The subjective evaluation was performed to investigate 
the effect of picture brightness on 3D visual perception and 
then compare it to that of 2D videos.  For this experiment, 
six stereoscopic test sequences were used (two outdoor and 
four indoor). Fig. 2 shows snapshots of our test sequences. 
Indoor scenes were captured at six different levels of camera 
exposures (very dark to very bright), and Fig. 3 shows an 
example of a scene captured with different brightness levels. 
Since outdoor scenes allow a wider range of brightness, the 
number of exposure levels for the outdoor sequences was 
increased to eight. In both cases, outdoor and indoor, each 
sequence is approximately 10 seconds long. 
The viewing conditions were set according to the ITU-R 
Recommendation 
BT.500-11 
[8]. 
Eighteen 
observers 
participated in our subjective tests: six females and twelve 
males, ranging from 23 to 63 years old. All subjects have 
none to marginal 3D image and video viewing experience. A 
65” Full HD 3D display (©Panasonic, Plasma. TC-
P65VT25) was used in our experiment. The TV settings 
were as follows: brightness: 80, contrast: 80, color: 50, R: 
70, G: 45, B: 30. 
At the beginning of the experiment a training section was 
provided: the “Running” test sequence was played starting 
from a very bright exposure to a very dark exposure to help 
viewers become familiar with the test process and show them 
the expected range quality-change. Note that “Running” was 
excluded from the subsequent testing process. 
Our tests included two steps: rating the perceptual quality 
of 3D content in different exposure levels and grading the

quality of the same content in 2D format. In order to 
maintain similar brightness conditions for both cases (3D 
and 2D), the left view of the captured video sequences was 
chosen and displayed to both eyes in the 2D case and the 
viewers were asked to use the glasses while watching the 2D 
video sequences. In our tests, subjects were aware if they 
were watching 2D or 3D videos. Both 2D and 3D subjective 
tests were conducted at the same time and the same room. 
The single stimulus continuous quality evaluation 
(SSCQE) method is used in our subjective tests [8]. After the 
training sequence, the viewers were first shown each 
stereoscopic test sequence in random order of exposure 
levels. Between two consecutive videos with different 
exposures, a three-second gray interval is provided for 
allowing the viewers to rate the perceptual quality of the 
content and relax their eyes before watching the next video.  
The perceptual quality reflects whether the displayed scene 
looks pleasant in general. In particular, subjects were asked 
to rate a combination of “naturalness”, “depth impression” 
and “comfort” as suggested by Hyunh-Thu et al. [9]. Fig. 4 
demonstrates the testing procedure. The scoring bar ranges 
from 0 – 10 in a continuous scale and a higher score 
correspond to better quality. Once all the stereoscopic 
sequences were played, there was a break interval of 5 
seconds followed by the 2D sequences. The same process 
was followed in this case - the same sequences in 2D format

were shown in random order of brightness, with 3-second 
intervals between each sequence - with the viewers asked to 
rate the video quality of the 2D content. 
C. Results and Analysis 
After collecting the experimental results, we removed the 
outliers based on the TU-R Recommendation BT.500-11 [8] 
(there was one outlier) and then the mean opinion scores 
from viewers are calculated. Fig. 5 shows the results with 
95% confidence interval. A general observation that applies 
to outdoor and indoor scenes is that the video sequences with 
brightness levels around the mid-band are more appealing to 
the viewers in both the 2D and 3D cases (rating scores are 
more than 6). Note that the exposure range is wider for the 
outdoor scenes and the highest brightness level for outdoors 
cannot be reached for the indoor scenes. The reason is that 
high levels of brightness in indoor scenes will introduce 
unacceptable degrees of noise caused by the sensitivity of the 
camera sensors. Regarding the indoor scenes, we observe 
that for scores above 6 (over which the quality may be 
regarded acceptable), the quality of the 3D experience 
increases as the brightness increases. This trend is also 
observed in the 2D case, with scores following the same 
pattern. If we would like to conclude something more from 
these findings, we could say that the 3D experience adds a 
bit more quality overall, although the difference is not very 
large.  
For the outdoor sequences, we observe that the extreme 
levels of brightness, very dark and very bright, result in 
unacceptable quality. For the mid-band section, the quality 
stays at acceptable levels, with very small variations.  The 
2D performance is almost identical, with 2D ratings slightly

higher than those of 3D in this case. The main reason for this 
deviation from the indoor case is the actual content of the 
outdoor scenes. The objects with depth in the latter case are 
relatively darker than the background. In fact, a large portion 
of the background – more so in the “OldBarn” sequence than 
the “LittleGreen” – is the sky, which in both cases is very 
bright and lacks detail. According to the viewers, the lack of 
detailed information in the background (i.e., overexposed 
sky) drastically reduced the level of depth illusion, 
hampering the 3D perception when watching stereoscopic 
content.  
III. 
EXPERIMENT TWO –  LOCAL CHANGE OF 
BRIGHTNESS 
In this section, we also study the effect of local 
brightness-change on the perceived 2D and 3D quality. The 
difference from the previous section is that, for each scene, 
the brightness of the background is kept relatively consistent 
while the brightness of the object(s) of interest is changed.  
A. Capturing Setup 
In our study, we intend to investigate the effect of the 
object’s brightness-change with respect to the background on 
the perceived visual quality in both 2D and 3D cases. For 
this comparison, 3D videos of indoor and outdoor scenes are 
captured using stereo cameras. Obtaining 2D videos is trivial 
since they can be derived directly from the right or left view 
of the 3D counterparts.  Below we present the setup of our 
3D capturing.  
For each scene, the brightness of the object(s) changes 
from an under-exposed to an over-exposed level, while the 
brightness of the background is adjusted to a normally 
exposed level (not over/under exposed) and is kept relatively 
unchanged for all the different recordings of the same scene.

The same capturing set up as the one described in Section 
II.A for the first experiment (Fig. 1) was used. For the indoor 
scenes, the brightness of the object(s) was changed by using 
a dimmable 1000W fluorescent video light source (FloLight 
FL-220AW). For the outdoor scenes, since the emitted light 
from the light source was insufficient for changing the 
brightness of the object(s) (due to the presence of sunlight), 
we used a collapsible circular reflector disc with multiple 
impacts to reflect different levels of sunlight on the object(s). 
Fig. 6 shows our capturing setup, the light source and the 
reflector used in our experiments.  In general, capturing 
outdoor scenes was much more challenging compared to 
indoor scenes, due to the presence of sunlight and the change 
of weather conditions, which kept altering the background 
brightness.  
For our study, at each brightness level, the luminance of 
the object(s) and background is measured using a 
multifunction light meter (Sekonic L-758Cine). We measure 
luminance since it indicates how much luminous power is 
perceived by the human eye when viewing the surface from 
a particular angle. To measure the brightness of object(s), we 
took the measurement at each brightness level using a 
specific spot on the object(s) which subjective tests shown to 
be the focus of attention. For example, in the case of the 
object of interest being a human, all measurements were 
taken from face. Regarding the background, we conducted 
several measurements, we made sure that the fluctuations 
were very small, and then took the average value. 
 
B. Subjective Evaluation 
For this experiment, six stereoscopic test sequences (two 
outdoor and four indoor) and one demo video were captured 
using the stereo camera setup described previously. Fig. 7 
shows a snapshot of our test sequences. For each scene the 
camera exposure is adjusted such that the background area is 
neither overexposed nor underexposed. The brightness of the 
object(s) between consecutive contrast levels are different by 
about 2/3 stop, which was achieved by measuring the 
luminance of the object(s) using a luminance meter. Then, 
the brightness of the object(s) is changed from an 
underexposed level to an overexposed level within multiple 
steps, with the brightness-change remaining visually 
differentiable (see Fig. 8). In both cases, outdoor and indoor, 
each sequence is approximately 10 seconds long. For each 
scene recording, we ensure that while the object’s brightness 
changes, the content of the scene and the background 
luminance remain unchanged.  
To quantify the perceived quality of the 3D experience at 
different levels of brightness, we performed subjective 
quality assessment tests. The viewing conditions of our 
subjective 
test 
were 
set according to the 
ITU-R 
Recommendation 
BT.500-11 
[8]. 
Eighteen 
observers 
participated in our subjective tests: seven females and eleven 
males, ranging from 23 to 60 years old. All subjects had 
none to marginal 3D image and video viewing experience. 
The same display as of our previous study was used for this 
experiment: a 65” Full HD 3D display (©Panasonic, Plasma, 
TC-P65VT25) and the subjective-test procedure was similar 
to our first experiment (see Section II, part B). 
 
C. Results and Analysis 
 After collecting the experimental results, we checked for 
the outliers based on the TU-R Recommendation BT.500-11 
[8] and then the mean opinion scores (MOS) from viewers 
were calculated. Fig. 9 shows the average perceptual 3D 
quality (MOS) versus brightness of the object(s) for all six 
stereo sequences. As it can be observed, the acceptable 
brightness level for objects in outdoor scenes is much higher 
than those in indoor scenes, due to the presence of sunlight.  
Here, the numerical value of object(s) brightness could not 
be used as a guideline for capturing high quality 3D content, 
in other words, we can not conclude that there is a certain 
range of brightness of the object(s) that results in acceptable 
3D quality (where MOS is greater than 6).  The reason is that 
the measured brightness is not a good indicator of what the 
camera has captured. In order to remove the camera effect, 
we need to avoid using the brightness and instead calculate 
the contrast between the objects of interest and the 
background.  There are many ways of measuring contrast. In 
this study we chose to use the Weber approach [10], which is 
one of the most commonly used in the field:

where Lo is the luminance of an object and Lb is the average 
luminance of the background.  
Please recall that in this experiment, the brightness of 
background is kept relatively constant and only the 
brightness of object(s) of interest is changed for each scene. 
This allows us to create videos with the same content but 
different contrast between the object(s) of interest and the 
background, a necessary feature for our subjective tests, as 
we do not want the content itself to affect the viewers’ 
decision. 
Fig. 10 shows the average subjective scores for quality of 
3D content versus contrast for all six sequences. A general 
observation that applies to both outdoor and indoor scenes is 
that the stereo video sequences with Weber contrast levels of 
-0.35 to 0.55 between the object and background are more 
appealing to the viewers (these correspond to rating scores 
above 6, which may be regarded as acceptable quality). Note 
that although the visually acceptable range of object’s 
brightness (MOS over 6) is higher for the outdoor scenes 
compared to that of the indoor scenes (as shown in Fig. 9) 
the range of contrast that ensures high 3D quality is similar 
for both cases. It is also observed that low scores are 
associated with high contrast scenes, which in Fig. 10 appear 
at both ends of the horizontal axis, as contrast here is the 
difference between the objects’ brightness and that of the 
background.  
Fig. 11 shows the average perceptual quality versus 
contrast for all six scenes. Each point in the figure denotes 
the mean opinion score for a specific scene at a specific 
contrast level. The blue solid line is the average MOS over 
all the scenes, and the upper and lower red dash lines denote 
the 95% confidence interval.  It can be observed that the

scores obtained from rating the 3D and 2D videos are 
following the same pattern, especially in the range of  
acceptable video quality (scores > 6), which indicates that 
the contrast or the brightness of the object of interest has 
almost equivalent influence on the perceptual quality for 
acceptable 3D and 2D videos. We also observe that scores 
for 2D are higher than those for 3D at the left end of the 
curve (where the object is much darker than the 
background). This is because crosstalk (ghosting) artifacts 
are severe whenever the background brightness is much 
higher than that of the objects of interest. 
To further verify that the effect of contrast on the quality 
of 3D and 2D videos is similar, we performed the statistical 
significance test. Hogg’s one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) [11] is applied to 2D and 3D scores for each 
scene. We state the null hypothesis as: there is no significant 
distinction between the collected values for the perceptual 
quality of 2D and that of 3D. The higher the returned p value 
is (which considers the difference in average and variance as 
well as the sample size), the less significant is the difference. 
A typical threshold of the p value that rejects the null 
hypothesis is 0.01 or 0.05. The p values for six scenes are 
0.3990 (Reading), 0.7663 (Interview), 0.9068 (Clapping), 
0.4104 (SlowMotion), 0.8228 (McMillan) and 0.8499 
(Painting) respectively, which are far above the threshold. 
Therefore, based on our experiment at each contrast level, 
there is no statistically significant difference between the 
perceptual quality of 3D and 2D videos of similar scenes. 
That is, given a large sample size, 3D and 2D videos should 
have virtually identical preferred contrast levels. 
Based on our observations, 3D content captured 
according to the recommended contrast range can provide 
high quality 2D experience. In this case, if the system 
involves the use of glasses, the display should adjust the

contrast of the 2D stream, to compensate for the diming 
effect of the 3D glasses.  
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Our psychophysical experiment involved considerable 
human power, including the subjects that took the tests and 
the researchers who prepared and organized the tests. These 
efforts could be reduced if a reliable 3D quality metric is 
available. Presently, the community is putting a considerable 
effort towards achieving this goal, but we are still far from an 
acceptable solution. 
Our finding that brightness has similar effects on 3D and 
2D videos is different from the practical observation in [5]. 
The latter suggests capturing 3D videos with higher light 
settings than 2D content in order to achieve good perceptual 
quality. This contradiction stems from the fact that we use 
3D glasses in both 2D and 3D subjective tests so that the 
light reduction for 3D and 2D is similar, whereas in [5] the 
light reduction was considered only for 3D.  
Our results on the relationship between 2D and 3D 
viewing (for both brightness and contrast) can be generalized 
for existing 3D displays, although the display systems 
deliver different amount of light when they display 3D 
content compared to 2D. In our study, this is due to the fact 
that both the 2D and 3D viewing tests were conducted while 
the display was set to the 3D mode and subjects wore 3D 
glasses during the entire experiment. On the other hand, the 
preferred range of contrast may vary depending on the 
displayed luminance range that the 3D viewing system 
supports. The variation, however, would not be large since 
contrast is defined as a ratio that is normalized by the 
background luminance. 
The low scores at both ends on the x-axis in Fig. 10 and 
Fig. 11 are due to the effect of crosstalk. Crosstalk is an

artifact where light that should be delivered to one eye is 
“leaked” to the other eye (it is also referred as the “ghosting” 
artifact) [12]. It is well known that crosstalk artifacts in 3D 
displays become severe when the contrast is high [13]. Note 
that all the existing 3D displays suffer from crosstalk. To 
reduce the crosstalk effect, we picked a 3D TV system, 
which based on subjective tests offers the best crosstalk 
reduction performance. 
Eye strain and headaches have been noted as some of the 
most important factors that affect the overall 3D quality [14]. 
In our tests, subjects were not explicitly asked to evaluate 
this factor. Properly identifying eye strain and headache 
requires a long-time viewing of a stimulus [15]. This is not 
practical in our current design, since it would make the 
testing session too long, and as a result it may affect the 
reliability of the collected data.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The era of user-centric multimedia has already begun, 
and quality plays a central role in it. Attention to the quality 
in 3D content case is even more important since low-quality 
3D videos can produce eyestrain, headache, and generally 
unpleasant viewing experience for the viewers. Brightness is 
one of the important factors that affect the visual comfort and 
quality of 3D videos. In this work, we investigated the effect 
that global and local brightness-changes have on quality of 
3D experience and its relation to the 2D scenario. This was 
done by performing extensive subjective quality assessments 
to quantify the perceived quality of the 3D and 2D 
experience at different levels of brightness. 
Our work contained two studies: 1) global change of 
brightness, which is achieved by setting different exposure 
times on the camera, and 2) local change of brightness, 
where the brightness of the background was kept relatively 
constant and the object’s brightness was changing using an 
external light source and/or a reflector disk. Subjective 
evaluations were performed, with the subjects being asked to 
rate the 3D and 2D perceptual quality of each sequence.  
A conclusion from both studies is that marginal 
difference is found in the brightness effects between 3D and 
2D videos. According to our results from the second study, a 
general observation that applies to outdoor and indoor scenes 
is that the stereo video sequences with Weber contrast levels 
of -0.35 to 0.55 between the object(s) and the background are 
more appealing to the viewers. In summary, content 
producers may improve the overall 3D quality of experience 
by adjusting the brightness of the objects of interest in a 
scene to ensure that the Weber contrast the objects and 
background falls within the suggested range levels. Film 
industry could use our findings to produce 3D videos with 
different brightness levels or light-settings.  
Our future work include: employ special lighting 
equipment in order to explore any possible case of brightness 
for foreground and background in outdoor and indoor 
conditions, conduct subjective tests with a much larger 
variety of content, and investigate the effect of different 
parameters on 3D perception quantitatively. This is towards 
our ultimate goal, which is providing guidelines for 
capturing and displaying 3D content as well as developing a 
3D quality metric.
