Abstract—For Smart Grid applications, Broadband Powerline 
presents inherent Unique Selling Points compared to other 
technologies. Many have promoted various technologies for 
Smart Grids. In Europe, new generation of Narrowband 
Powerline seem to gain ground. However, a growing number of 
utility and industrial companies, concerned about the limits of 
such widespread technologies, have tested and implemented 
Broadband Powerline- some with the help of bmp as strategy 
consultancy. The maturity coupled with the performance of 
this technology allows to forecast Broadband Powerline as one 
of the key technologies for Smart Grid, which will enable 
utility companies to overcome numerous challenges posed by 
the next generation energy distribution grid. Through this 
paper, we will describe the technologies forming the Powerline 
communications and especially, the place of Broadband 
Powerline among the Smart Grid technologies and its 
advantages. 
Keywords-Broadband Powerline; Smart Grid; Smart Metering;

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Traditional grid used by Utility companies is facing new 
challenges concerning the efficiency and flexibility of its 
applications. The development of Automatic Meter Reading 
(AMR) with Narrowband Powerline Technologies or other 
technologies was a first step. However, the needs of real time 
and permanent connectivity for all grid applications suggest 
the use of a technology offering higher performances and 
offering long term viability. Broadband Powerline appears as 
a technology meeting these needs and offering a global 
solution. 
Through this paper, we will first focus on the overall 
market of Powerline Communications. Secondly, we will 
offer an overview of the Broadband Powerline technology, 
and then its advantages as unique selling points. Finally, we 
will 
describe 
some 
representative 
cases 
concerning 
Broadband Powerline and assess its competitive position. 
II. 
BROADBAND POWERLINE WITHIN THE 
LANDSCAPE OF POWERLINE 
Using the electrical network to build a two-way 
communication Internet infrastructure, Broadband over 
Power Line technology (BPL) is currently taking a leading 
position [1] for the energy providers which want to upgrade 
their networks into “Smart Grids”.  
BPL transmits signals over the distribution networks in 
the 1 MHz-34 MHz (and beyond) via Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing modulation (OFDM) [2]. This multi-
channel modulation allows transmitting the signal over 
various frequencies, taking maximum advantage of the 
available frequency bandwidth.  
Recent similar developments are being undertaken 
focusing on the CENELEC A band (under 148 kHz), but 
even here BPL presents significant and valuable advantages 
over such Narrowband Powerline technologies.  
Used as part of the largest ongoing European projects, 
such as Linky by ERDF in France or Telegestore in Italy by 
Enel [3], the narrowband Powerline technology is a suitable 
solution for basic applications such as meter reading or 
remote billing. Supported by many international players, we 
are witnessing the emergence of several industrial standards, 
seeking to become European or even global references, such 
as PRIME [4] (led by Iberdrola), G3-Powerline [5] (led by 
ERDF) or Meters & More [6] (led by Enel). Some leading 
companies in PLC technology, such as Echelon [7] or 
Siemens [8], are following this trend and announced their 
willingness to open their protocols to all manufacturers.

The market is characterized by a quick evolution of the 
narrowband Powerline performances. As referred in Table I, 
the technologies using simple carrier modulations (FSK [10], 
S-FSK [11], BPSK [12], DCSK [13]) show today a 
commercial maturity and are industrialized by industry 
heavyweights such as Echelon [14], Enel or Yitran [15]. 
However, the low data rates – not exceeding 5kbps – allowed 
by this 1st generation constrain the implementation of future 
new applications.

More recently, yet still in development, a new generation 
using a multi-carriers modulation (OFDM) has been 
introduced on the markets, enabling higher data rates (from a 
dozen up to 128 kbps) and using the CENELEC A frequency 
band. As shown in Figure 1, this technology also increases 
the robustness of the signal, allowing crossing the 
transformers in order to communicate over the low and 
medium voltage lines, which is a clear advantage for 
electrical network including remote parts of rural areas. 
Definitely, more suited to the future, this new generation of 
OFDM-based products emerges, enabling for instance, the 
use of IPv6.  
 
Figure 1.  PLC and BPL basics [16] 
To implement the most suitable Smart Grid network 
regarding the needs of each energy supplier, the key question 
is to clearly identify the limits of this architecture enabled by 
narrowband Powerline. In order to ensure the sustainability 
of the network, it is primordial to take into account the 
possible evolution of these needs, in addition to the required 
applications to date. These might entail the implementation 
of alternative technologies allowing other data rates, and 
permanent connectivity throughout the energy distribution 
network.  
However, BPL reaches significantly more speed, as, in 
most of the cases, injecting 200 Mbps on the low voltage 
enables to benefit from Mbps up to the meter, and enhances 
the connectivity in enabling real time applications.  
Performances of BPL depend on the distance to cover, 
the electricity environment (type of cable, cables’ isolation 
methods, and type of secondary substation), skills of 
installer/integrators and the effective noise levels. Until 
recently, 200/300 Mbps was the maximum gross bandwidth 
reached by companies; however, current bandwidth can 
reach 400/500 Mbps or even 1 Gbps but higher speeds being 
addressed for the inhome market.  
BPL current performances are unequalled on the medium 
and low voltage lines. On one hand, low voltage lines offer 
200 Mbps speed over 250-300m without repeater and 
physical data rates under 1 Mbps over a long range 
transmission. As seen in the recent CEZ pilot [17] on Figure 
2, where more than 1,000 meters have been connected 
through BPL, all meters have been read, with speeds up to  
30 times higher than narrowband PLC having been tested in 
the same project in 2011. On the other side, BPL on 
medium-voltage underground lines is performing extremely 
well, allowing up to several tens of Mbps physical 
throughput. Such performances have been achieved with a 
number of tests and projects such as in Morocco with 
ONEE- Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau- [9] as 
early as 2008, or more recently in several deployments as 
backhaul or smart metering data as seen with Iberdrola in 
Spain [9].  
Figure 2.  Physical speed distribution on a secondary substation sample 
equipped with BPL at CEZ as in October 2011 [17]  
Today, BPL on overhead medium voltage lines are in 
some cases seen to allow 2 Mbps speed over 4 km and at 
least 200 kbps over 6 to 8 km. 
III. 
REVIVAL OF BROADBAND POWERLINE 
After years of unrealized hopes, BPL activities are now 
intensifying though the growing interest shown by industrial 
and utility companies, or venture capitalists.  
BPL has long seemed to be unsuccessful, with cases such 
as IBEC [18], which after having announced a partnership 
with IBM in order to connect undeserved US American areas 
via BPL technology, suddenly ceased its activities at the 
beginning of 2012. Major companies such as Endesa and 
Itochu, which in 2005 decided to invest in DS2 [19], have 
disinvested later on, or Earthlink & Consolidated Energy, 
which, after investing in Ambient [20], has seen the 
company stopping its broadband Powerline activities 
meanwhile.  
But, the maturity and newest developments of the BPL 
technology have led various players to re-consider their 
position towards this specific market. 
The first positive factor was the achieved standardization 
in the field of BPL. Indeed 2010 was the year when two 
major standards for the BPL industry were reached. 
The IEEE 1901 standard is based on the industrial norms 
Homeplug [21] and HD PLC [22].  
The technology specified by IEEE 1901 aims at using 
transmission frequencies of less than 100 MHz, and allows 
data rates rating from 100 Mbps. It is also used by all classes 
of BPL devices, such as BPL devices used for the first-
mile/last-mile connection, and broadband services as well as 
BPL devices used in buildings for LANs, Smart Energy 
applications, transportation platforms (vehicle) applications, 
and other data distribution (<100m between devices). 
Though the standard does not provide interoperability with 
the two technologies it is based on, it allows benefiting from

the coexistence between these technologies supported by two 
different MAC layer protocols.  
The ITU G.hn [23] standard, based on DS2/Marvell 
technology norm using OFDM access method, has first 
focused on the inhome market and can be supported by any 
wire (coaxial cable, electrical wire and telephone line). Its 
technology offers a data rate speed up to 1 Gbps but though 
being non-interoperable with IEEE 1901 based products, it 
has secured co-existence with these thanks to the Inter 
System Protocol (ISP), which coordinates the usage of the 
frequencies 
among 
the 
various 
domains 
of 
BPL 
implementation.  
Such a context has been securing the environment for 
BPL and has enabled the emerging of new players, such as, 
just to name a few: Broadcom [24], Mstar [25], Qualcomm 
Atheros [26], which are chipset providers using IEEE 1901 
standard or Lantiq [27], Marvell [28], Metanoia [29] using 
the G.hn standard. Sigma Designs [30] is one of the main 
chipset providers using both standards. 
Furthermore, heavyweights have adopted BPL as part of 
their portfolio or strategy.  
Alstom Grid [31] has partnered with a DS2 integrator to 
include BPL as a SCADA solution for medium voltage, 
integrating digital information together: telephony, video 
images, and grid data over 20 kV networks. Several 
deployments have been conducted by Alstom: in France, 
Brazil, India, etc. 
In 2012, Siemens Financial Services Venture Capital has 
become shareholder of PPC [32] to strengthen their portfolio 
in BPL communications.  
Alcatel-Lucent has been studying the opportunities, 
which might be realized by this technology, but up to now, it 
has not come out with a specific product or strategy. 
Itron cooperates with PPC for integrating BPL in their 
modems. Other modem suppliers have also undertaken some 
first developments with BPL: Landis & Gyr [33], IUSA [34], 
ZPA [35] and Mikroelektronika [36]. In 2009, Elster [37] 
announced its collaboration with Defidev [38] for the first 
meter prototype with BPL and radio being integrated. 
ETDE 
(groupe 
Bouygues) 
[39] 
is 
using 
BPL 
technologies for smart street lightning in various French 
cities.  
Utility companies as well have chosen BPL for various 
segments: Iberdrola has decided to implement BPL on its 
medium voltage lines for gathering the AMR data, British 
Gas which invested in PPC company in 2012 to strengthen 
its presence in the European smart grid market will start a 
pilot project with BPL on various smart grid applications for 
new opportunities. 
In addition, numerous utility companies all over the 
world are testing the technology for their own needs, in 
Europe (CEZ, EnBW, EDF, etc.), in Asia (Meralco, RESB, 
TPC, etc.) in Africa (CEET in Togo ONEE in Morocco, 
etc.), or in Latin America (Light, etc.).  
The interest for BPL has been intensified due to the 
potentials of the technology for supporting new applications 
within Smart Grid. 
IV. 
UNIQUE SELLING POINTS OF BPL FOR SMART GRID 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Implemented on the low and medium voltage networks, 
BPL allows a real time and permanent connectivity and thus, 
continuous monitoring of the entire electrical grid. The 
technology works without creating interferences with the 
energy distribution activities and allows energy utilities to 
achieve immediate operational gains, such as: 
 
In the short term:  
 
Technical and non-technical losses on low and 
medium voltage are identified and restrained. 
 
Manual meter readings are no longer required, 
replaced by remote metering enabling immediate 
and reliable readings. 
 
Invoices are automatically generated, preventing any 
entry error and reducing invoicing delay. 
 
Low and medium voltage network and substations 
remote 
monitoring 
allows 
improved 
network 
operations (preventive and reactive maintenance, 
etc.) and optimised investment decisions.  
 
In the medium term: 
 
Quality of service is improved thanks to error 
prevention, innovative offers and tariffs meet 
specific needs of clients.  
 
Gathering information in real time allows optimised 
network operation and highly reactive maintenance 
services. 
 
Customer service can offer a highly efficient 
support, 
improved 
with 
real-time 
network 
information transmitted through the Broadband 
Powerline infrastructure, and thus, enabled to answer 
to any incident or demand accurately. 
 
 In contrast to the generated benefits, Broadband 
Powerline induces limited additional operational costs, 
essentially related to the IP (Internet) management tools and 
the 
equipment 
maintenance. 
Further, 
the 
achieved 
commercial maturity of the technology has allowed 
manufacturers to develop a wide range of dedicated products 
for applications related to energy distribution.  
The flexibility of BPL communications and their ability 
to 
complement 
with 
any 
other 
telecommunication 
technology enable the use of existing infrastructures such as 
optical fiber deployed on High (or even Medium) Voltage 
networks or wireless technologies, and thus, to interface with 
any usual management system already deployed. Therefore, 
the investments required by the deployments are clearly 
defined and controlled.  
The energy provider is able to activate its infrastructure 
and to remotely manage each of its BPL devices, the meter 
and other connected devices (sensors, alarms, cameras, etc.) 
as soon as first infrastructures have been implemented. Thus, 
Return on Investment of Broadband Powerline businesses is 
immediately enabled and attractive and grows along with the 
increase of the Powerline coverage.

Broadband Powerline deployment might be divided in 
phases and cells, namely by group of LV equipments behind 
a transformer or a HV/MV line. The CAPEX can be spread 
across the first years of the project, in order to smooth out 
the required investments specific LV or MV groups. Such 
flexibility and incremental deployment permit previous 
analysis to identify the best potentials for operating savings.  
The analysis of Broadband Powerline projects deployed 
until today has brought proof of the rapid profitability 
reached by the implementation of a Smart Grid network 
through this technology. This is being achieved through the 
incremental 
savings 
made 
available 
by 
Broadband 
Powerline, the control of the correlated investments and the 
limited operating costs. Coverage of the dense areas ensures 
a return on investment within a few years and easily balances 
out the lower profitability of more rural areas, to eventually 
reach a profitability worth up to five times initial 
investments.  
These advantages are not the only benefits brought by 
Broadband Powerline, as this technology allows: 
 
A widening spectrum of possible applications thanks 
to the versatile nature of Broadband Powerline  
 
Possibility of upgrading the delivered speeds 
according to future needs and emerging new 
applications 
 
An efficient and simplified coverage of acentric, less 
dense areas 
V. 
HIGHLIGHTS ON SOME REPRESENTATIVE BPL CASE 
STUDIES- RETURN ON EXPERIENCE 
Representative projects implementing BPL have been set 
up within Smart Grid and show the viability and 
performance of BPL compared to other technologies. 
The most quoted as an example for AMR is the 
Advanced Metering Management Pilot Project, illustrated in 
Figure 3, and conducted by CEZ which has enabled to 
analyse and compare various powerline solutions for Smart 
Grid technology’s installation.  
Alongside various narrowband PLC solutions, such as: 
 
Landys&Gyr using PLC modem from local PLC 
vendor Modemtec,  
 
ZPA Smart energy which is a local company using a 
first generation PLC solution / licence from Renesas 
[40], 
 
ADD Grup Moldova [41] 
 
Echelon 
 
as well as a few GPRS from ZPA and a few RF from 
EHM,  
all being deployed at 28 000 meter locations and in almost 
1,000 distribution substations, 5000 BPL meters have been 
deployed with Corinex’ technology in 2 regions Vrchlabí 
and Pardubice in underground cables. Over 100 BPL 
couplers have been installed on medium voltage technology, 
as well as several dozen repeaters.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Pardubice BPL test with CEZ in Q1 2012 [17] 
General issues appeared along the project deployment 
such as network optimization, LV nodes identification with 
high level crosstalks, to name only few of them. But on the 
whole, the project implementation was mastered and allows 
drawing 
significant 
conclusions 
about 
the 
various 
technologies’ performance. 
In the Pardubice BPL project, where no repeaters have 
been installed, a final average meter reading success rate of 
99.705% was registered. Indeed, after the installation by 
CEZ (which has been done by the utility without assistance 
by Corinex), some 1.6% of the 1220 meters were not 
connecting first, but this was resolved quickly after 
reviewing. 
Thus, BPL appeared as having superior connectivity and 
performance to any other PLC deployments.  
Furthermore, CEZ states that the costs are comparable 
with narrow band solution in absolute terms, and hundreds 
times lower in price per Mbps. 
Thus, though emerging as smart metering solution, BPL -
among the numerous technologies tested or deployed for 
Smart Grid applications (Narrowband Powerline, Wireless, 
Radio, GPRS, etc.) - possess unique selling points to be 
pinpointed in the direct control of the energy distribution 
network, through a permanent and continuous connection 
(without concentrator for example), under truly controlled 
costs and allowing the possibility to increase data rates for 
future applications. 
Another Smart Grid area is the utilization of BPL for MV 
lines, allowing SCADA applications, monitoring of the 
distribution substations and gathering the data flow from the 
meters. The appetence of various utilities and industrialists 
indicate a soon to come maturity for BPL. Many Utility 
companies are testing (EDF, EnBW, Stadtwerke Ratingen, 
Scottish Power, etc.); but already some have decided to 
implement this in a full deployment. Iberdrola in Spain is a 
good example as already 40% of the targeted MV substations 
are connected through BPL.  
In France, one project has as well come to maturity with 
the SICAE de la Somme et du Cambraisis [42], which has 
deployed, jointly with Alstom Grid, innovative BPL 
technology for MV power grid applications such as 
telephony, video surveillance, remote meter reading, real-
time data exchange with grid controls and active demand 
response management.

The BPL platform has been successfully deployed over 
65 
km 
of 
underground 
and 
overhead 
lines 
with 
approximately 50 communication points on grid nodes for its 
French rural municipalities.  
 
 
Figure 4.  General overview of BPL performance [9] 
Unequalled performance on underground and overhead 
MV lines has been attained in this project, showing that BPL 
has pushed further its first limits related to distance and 
sufficient bandwidth, especially related to overhead MV 
lines.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION  
On the facts gathered from numerous projects and as 
highlighted by Figure 4, Broadband Powerline, enabling 
permanent, reliable and fast connectivity onto the entire 
electrical grid, is therefore considered as a future proof 
technology, particularly relevant for the implementation of 
the Smart Grid. However, it is foreseen that hybrid 
architectures will best meet the specific objectives and 
priorities of each energy provider, where as Broadband 
PLC/BPL can and is expected to play a central role. 
Some expect the European market potential for BPL in 
Smart Grids to reach €25bn  by 2020 in the Low Voltage 
segment (metering, e-Mobility, Home Gateway,etc.), while 
the MV (mainly network automation) is forecasted at €3.5bn. 
[43]. 
Though BPL will have to face specific challenges such as 
imposing an interoperable standard, while using BPL, one 
should as well consider the use of the excess of capacities 
which could be used to create high data rates Internet 
connections 
and 
make 
them 
available 
for 
various 
applications. 
In this respect, one could think of Internet and telecom 
services,  as well as the usage of BPL for smart street 
lightning networks and the set up of smart cities and 
buildings. 
The deployment of BPL solutions has allowed companies 
such as Bouygues, ETDE to offer additional services basing 
on a platform developped first to monitor the street lightning 
system. Thus, excess capacities enable video-surveillance, 
traffic monitoring, and the creation of hot spot WIFI as seen 
in some French cities in the Parisian region.
