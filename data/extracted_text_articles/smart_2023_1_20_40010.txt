Abstract—The emergence of Smart Homes is driven by 
increasing digitization and individual living conditions, which 
can improve living comfort, safety, and energy efficiency. 
Smart Homes can maintain home autonomy and quality of life 
in old age, but their implementation requires high technology 
acceptance from users. This study aims to investigate the 
interdependencies between older (55+) users and complex 
sociotechnical systems in the living environment, such as Smart 
Homes, to determine the significance of acceptance factors and 
particularly the influence of digital literacy on it. The research, 
as part of a dissertation, includes quantitative surveys and 
qualitative interviews to identify the factors that strongly 
influence the acceptance of technology by older adults. The 
goal is to develop a relevant theory and tailor technical 
solutions to the diverse needs of users, ultimately increasing 
technology acceptance and positively influencing the design of 
such systems.  
Keywords-Technology Acceptance; Smart Home.

 INTRODUCTION  
Increasing digitization and individual living conditions 
influence housing preferences and lead to the emergence of 
Smart Homes, which can improve living comfort, safety, and 
energy efficiency. Smart Homes can help maintain home 
autonomy and quality of life in old age, but their 
implementation requires high technology acceptance from 
users. Therefore, designing Smart Homes to meet individual 
needs and abilities is crucial for successful implementation. 
Non-use of connected technology may lead to higher costs 
and assisted living forms in the future. The challenge is to 
design technology adequately for older adults and sensitize 
society to their difficulties in dealing with technology [1]. 
For example, the use of a Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) 
application has the potential to enhance technology 
acceptance among older individuals and potentially improve 
their quality of life [2].  
Consequently, the research question arises to find a 
model that is considering multigenerationality and digital 
literacy, as well as aimed at a holistic integrated use of 
technology including all relevant factors to predict 
technology acceptance of older adults (55+) regarding 
complex socio-technical systems in the living environment. 
Furthermore, it is intended to determine the importance of 
acceptance factors in such a setting for older adults. The aim 
is to have a positive impact on the development and 
implementation of technology to bring the greatest possible 
benefit to society. 
Section II of this paper provides an overview of the 
theoretical 
foundations, 
including 
diffusion 
theory, 
innovation resistance theory, Fogg Behavior Model, Uses 
and Gratifications Theory, Gibson's Affordance Theory, 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Unified Theory 
of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), to 
understand Smart Home acceptance among older adults. 
Section III reviews the current state of technology 
acceptance research, emphasizing the need for representative 
samples. In Section IV, the objective is to investigate the 
interdependencies between older users and sociotechnical 
systems, focusing on acceptance factors and the impact of 
digital literacy. Section V outlines the research design 
involving quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to 
identify influential factors and develop a comprehensive 
theory. Section VI introduces a mixed-method approach, 
combining literature review, quantitative surveys, and 
qualitative interviews, to analyze the acceptance of Smart 
Homes among older adults. Section VII concludes the paper 
by summarizing the research objectives and outlining 
potential avenues for future work.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
The theoretical background for the acceptance of Smart 
Homes by older adults is described by various theories. 
Regarding this, the diffusion theory describes the processes 
that are associated with the introduction of innovations in a 
social system [2]. The innovation resistance theory deals 
with reasons why people resist or reject innovations [3]. The 
Fogg Behavior Model describes factors that influence a 
person's behavior [4]. The Uses and Gratifications Theory, in 
turn, states that the choice of media depends on the 
individual needs and interests they want to satisfy [5]. 
Gibson's Affordance Theory states that objects in an 
individual's environment are perceived not only by their 
physical properties but also by their potential for action or 
affordances [6]. The TAM by Davis from 1989 describes 
perceived ease of use and usefulness as central acceptance-
building variables [7]. The UTAUT expands on TAM and 
identifies additional factors that influence technology usage 
intention. Gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use 
also affect the intensity of these factors [8]. As all models are 
established, widely used, and specifically designed for

investigating acceptance, they will also be considered in the 
context of the dissertation. 
III. 
STATE OF THE ART 
The state of the art on technology acceptance research is 
heterogeneous and encompasses various research strands 
ranging from individual user acceptance to societal 
acceptance of technologies. The topic of technology 
acceptance of older people in Smart Homes can be classified 
within the movement of technology assessment, which deals 
with the impact of technologies on society and the 
environment [9].  
The TAM as a key model in this context has been 
confirmed by numerous studies, but there are still many 
unexplored areas of application that could contribute to the 
predictive validity of TAM. Future research should focus on 
the moderating role of individual variables, the inclusion of 
additional variables in the model, the investigation of actual 
usage, and the relationships between actual usage and 
objective outcome measures, as well as the older adult 
population as a target group. The examination of more 
representative samples of older adults is essential, as 
previous studies often only include relatively young and 
highly educated participants [10]. 
In general, the topic of technology acceptance is being 
continued today in other contexts, such as innovation 
research, and is sometimes referred to using other terms such 
as technology dialogue or technology openness [11]. 
Nonetheless, the question of how new technologies are 
received, evaluated, and classified by potential users, 
consumers, and the public remains relevant [12]. 
IV. 
OBJECTIVE AND RESEARCH QUESTION 
The dissertation aims to investigate the interdependencies 
between older (55+) users and complex sociotechnical 
systems in the living environment, specifically Smart Homes 
comprising Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living 
(AAL) applications. The focus is on examining the 
acceptance of these systems and understanding the 
significance of acceptance factors, including the influence of 
digital literacy. Rather than focusing solely on specific 
components, the study emphasizes the integration of various 
elements (e.g., voice recognition, touch-sensitive devices) 
within a Smart Home system. The goal is to develop a 
comprehensive understanding of the interplay between aging 
in a technological society and technology acquisition and 
acceptance. Additionally, the study investigates the potential 
for positively influencing the acceptance of complex 
sociotechnical systems, such as Smart Homes. This research 
aids in developing relevant theoretical frameworks, and 
facilitates the customization of technical solutions to meet 
the diverse needs of end-users, ultimately enhancing 
technology acceptance and informing system design. The 
study's insights provide valuable guidance for technology 
creators, 
including 
user 
interface 
design, 
usability 
improvement, and support and training provision to enhance 
digital literacy among older adults. 
V. 
RESEARCH DESIGN 
In the empirical part, quantitative surveys and qualitative 
interviews are conducted to identify the factors that strongly 
influence the acceptance of technology by older adults. First, 
a literature review is conducted to identify existing tools and 
studies on technology acceptance. The identified factors are 
then examined in a quantitative questionnaire design before 
serving as a starting point for an exploratory design based on 
grounded theory. Qualitative interviews are conducted to 
gain a deep understanding of the technology use and related 
conditions of older participants. The data is systematically 
analyzed to develop the theory. Knowledge gain occurs 
through iterative data collection and analysis. This process 
continues until theoretical saturation, the point at which 
sufficient information is available and no new insights are 
gained. Subsequently, an evaluation of the theory is 
conducted with a control group in either the same or an 
equivalent setting. The aim is to recognize the theory's pros 
and cons and enhance it as required to attain a superior 
comprehension of the investigated phenomenon.  
VI. 
METHODOLOGY 
In the dissertation, a mixed-method approach is chosen as 
a methodology, which consists of a literature review, a 
quantitative survey, and a Grounded Theory. This combined 
approach is often chosen when it comes to examining a 
complex phenomenon from different perspectives and 
gaining a more comprehensive understanding. Conducting a 
quantitative survey is considered particularly suitable for 
surveying many individuals and establishing measurable 
variables in relation to each other. Grounded Theory, in turn, 
enables the discovery of new theories based on empirically 
obtained data by providing insights into users' experiences, 
attitudes, and beliefs. Overall, Grounded Theory is a flexible 
and adaptable data analysis procedure that is well-suited for 
complex phenomena, as well as to consider the participants' 
perspective and capture the complexity of social processes 
and interactions [13]. The combination of both approaches 
obtains a more comprehensive picture of technology 
acceptance.  
The research design consists of several steps. Firstly, the 
specifics and developments of technology applications in 
Smart Homes are described. Secondly, a literature review is 
conducted to identify existing theories and models related to 
technology acceptance. Relevant literature sources are 
evaluated to extract significant factors. In the third step, a 
quantitative questionnaire design is developed to examine 
the identified factors. A representative sample of older adults 
is surveyed, and the data is statistically analyzed. The fourth 
step involves using the quantitative results as a starting point 
for qualitative interviews. Grounded Theory is applied to 
extract new insights from the data and advance theory 
building. The fifth and final step entails evaluating the 
theory. A test is conducted to identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of the theory and improve it if necessary.

approach to identify influential factors impacting the 
acceptance of Smart Homes among older adults. The 
findings 
will 
provide 
valuable 
insights 
into 
the 
interdependencies between older users and sociotechnical 
systems, offering a comprehensive understanding of this 
relationship. In addition, these findings will guide 
technology creators in designing user-friendly interfaces, 
improving usability, and delivering effective support and 
training for older adults. 
To further advance the field, future research should focus 
on the practical application of these findings in real-world 
settings. Evaluating the effectiveness of implementing 
technology and its impact on the quality of life for older 
adults is crucial.  
By bridging the gap between research and practice, this 
study aims to contribute to the development of age-friendly 
technologies and empower older adults to fully embrace the 
benefits of living in a technologically advanced society.
