Abstract—In this paper, we propose a peer discovery method for 
Device-to-Device (D2D) communications using Multi-Attribute 
Decision Modeling (MADM) technique. The method exploits 
both physical and social characteristics of User Equipment (UE) 
to find the most suitable partner for D2D communication. A 
small-cell based scenario is considered with the aim to pair the 
UEs with similar social and physical characteristics. Various 
social and physical attributes are used to rank the UEs and 
select the best one as a D2D partner. Simulation and analysis 
results are provided for various performance parameters.

INTRODUCTION 
Small-Cell Network (SCN) and Device-to-Device (D2D) 
communications are believed to be the emerging solutions for 
the heavily loaded cellular networks [1]. Since both paradigms 
aim to provide low cost, low power and short-range 
communication and reduce the burden on Macro-Cell Base-
Station (MCBS), they can be integrated to exploit both the 
licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands for direct 
communication between Cellular User Equipment (CUEs).  
In order to establish a D2D link between two CUEs, the 
source UE needs to discover the target UE with the desired 
service. The peer discovery may be performed with or 
without the assistance of Base-Station (BS) or eNodeB 
(Evolved Node B). The former method can improve the peer 
discovery process at the cost of higher signaling overhead. 
Similarly, the latter approach can achieve scalability and out-
of-coverage discovery but lacks synchronization and 
collision avoidance [2].  
In this work, we propose a method based on Technique 
for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution 
(TOPSIS) [3] for social-aware D2D peer discovery in SCN 
environment. It combines both the social and physical 
attributes of a UE to determine a suitable partner for D2D 
communication. A decision matrix is constructed where the 
UEs connected to the Small-Cell Base Station (SCBS) are 
considered as alternatives and various social and physical 
attributes as constraints. The decision matrix is then 
normalized and used to calculate the positive and negative 
ideal solutions. Then, based on the distance from the two 
ideal solutions, the candidate UEs are ranked and the best one 
is selected for D2D communication. The SCN based scenario 
can overcome the issues in traditional macro-cell based D2D 
communication. Also, the method is easy to implement and 
power-efficient as the peer discovery process is performed by 
the SCBS rather than the UE itself. 
The next section presents the problem definition and 
formulation. The third section discusses the simulation model 
and results and the final section summarizes the discussion 
with conclusion and future direction. 
II. 
PROBLEM DEFINITION AND FORMULATION 
D2D peer discovery is based on the physical and social 
relationship between human users. Users who are friends on 
social networks with same age group and profession are more 
likely to have similar choices. Moreover, for D2D 
communication the users also need to be located closely. 
Therefore, we consider both social and physical attributes to 
maximize 
the 
chances 
of 
willingness 
for 
D2D 
communication. For this purpose, we use TOPSIS method 
which ranks the available alternatives, i.e., UEs and select the 
best option based on the given attributes. The basic steps of 
the method are as follows. 
Step 1: We construct a decision matrix Dm in which the rows 
consist of UEs as alternatives while the columns are based on 
various social and physical attributes of the corresponding UE 
as given in (1). 
               𝐴𝑡1        𝐴𝑡2      𝐴𝑡3  …       𝐴𝑡𝑝−1        𝐴𝑡𝑝

where 𝑋𝑖,𝑗 is the value of attribute 𝐴𝑡𝑗 for 𝑈𝐸𝑖. 
Step 2: The values for each attribute have different scales. 
Moreover, we separate the attributes as desired and undesired 
attributes based on their impact on overall performance. So, 
we normalize the decision matrix to make it in uniform scale. 
The desired attributes are normalize1d as: 
𝑋𝑖,𝑗
𝑛𝑜𝑟 = 
𝑋𝑖,𝑗
∑
𝑋𝑖,𝑗
𝑚
𝑖=1
   where i = 1, . m and  j  1, . . . p(2)
while the undesired attributes are normalized as: 
𝑋𝑖,𝑗
𝑛𝑜𝑟 =  1 −
𝑋𝑖,𝑗
∑
𝑋𝑖,𝑗
𝑚
𝑖=1
     𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖 = 1, . 𝑚 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑗 =  1, . 𝑝  (3)

Step 3: Then based on impact on the performance we assign 
weights W to each attribute as: 
  𝑋𝑤(𝑖,𝑗) = 𝑊𝑖*𝑋𝑛𝑜𝑟    𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒  ∑
𝑊𝑖
𝑚
𝑖=1
= 1        (4) 
Step 4: Next, we find we find the Ideal positive (𝐼+) for each 
attribute and the ideal negative solution (𝐼−) as: 
 𝐼+  = {𝑀𝑎𝑥 (𝑋𝑊(1,𝑗), 𝑋𝑊(2,𝑗), … … 𝑋𝑊(𝑚,𝑗))}  (5) 
𝐼− = {𝑀𝑖𝑛 (𝑋𝑊(1,𝑗), 𝑋𝑊(2,𝑗), … … 𝑋𝑊(𝑚,𝑗))}    (6) 
Step 5: Then using eq. (5) and (6), we calculate the distance 
of each solution from (𝐼+) and (𝐼−) as: 
𝐷𝐼𝑖
+ = √∑
( 𝑋𝑤(𝑖,𝑗) − 𝐼𝑗
+)2
𝑝
𝑗=1
                      (7) 
𝐷𝐼𝑖
− = √∑
( 𝑋𝑤(𝑖,𝑗) − 𝐼𝑗
−)2
𝑝
𝑗=1
                       (8) 
Step 6: We then use 𝐷𝐼𝑖
+ and 𝐷𝐼𝑖
− from eq. (8) and (9) to 
calculate the coefficient of closeness to the ideal solution as: 
𝐶𝐶𝑖 = 
𝐷𝐼𝑖
−
𝐷𝐼𝑖
−+𝐷𝐼𝑖
+   𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖 = 1, , 𝑚  𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑒 0 ≤ 𝐶𝐶𝑖 ≤ 1    (9) 
Step 7: The final step is to rank the UEs in descending order 
based on the value of 𝐶𝐶𝑖. The UE with highest value of 
𝐶𝐶𝑖 is the best choice for D2D communication. 
III. 
SIMULATION AND RESULTS 
We performed simulations of the proposed scheme in 
MATLAB considering a small-cell environment with 10 UEs 
distributed uniformly. Social attributes like frequency of 
contact, contact duration, social media interaction and 
similarity of interest are considered as in [4]. Similarly, the 
physical attributes taken into account include the number of 
available services, distance from the source UE and the 
available interfaces. The SCBS provides assistance in D2D 
peer discovery and is assumed to have the mentioned 
information about the available UEs. 
Initially, each attribute of a UE is assigned random 
values between 0 and 6. For simplicity, uniform weights are 
assigned to the attributes after normalization. Three 
simulation scenarios are considered separately based only on 
physical, social and both the physical and social attributes.  
 
 
Figure 1. D2D peer Discovery Time vs. Iterations 
The simulations are run for ten times and the results are 
plotted in terms of D2D peer discovery time and Peer 
discovery success ratio as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. 
The results in Figure 1 show the D2D peer discovery time 
for scenario considering physical, social and the combination 
of physical and social attributes. The average time of 
discovering the best D2D peer is 39 ms. 
 
Figure 2. D2D Peer Discovery Success Ratio vs. Iterations 
Similarly, we plot the results of D2D peer discovery 
success ratio based on comparison with the analytical results 
as shown in Figure 2. The average success ratio in the 
scenario considering both social and physical attributes is 
88%. The proposed method is fast as it takes seven easy steps 
to find the best D2D peer. Similarly, it efficiently combines 
attributes of different impact in a simple manner. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION 
In this paper, we proposed a D2D peer discovery method 
based on multi-attribute decision modeling. The method is 
simple to implement, fast and improves the peer discovery 
process significantly. Simulation results demonstrate the 
efficiency of the method in terms of discovery time and 
success ratio. In the future, we aim to improve the work by 
considering more realistic scenarios and determine the impact 
of each attribute.
