Abstract— Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) are considered 
an attractive alternative to the traditional wired backbone 
networks for broadband Internet access. However, their 
capacity is limited due to the nature of the radio channel, which 
must be shared by the nodes forwarding the traffic from and to 
the gateway. Therefore, estimating the capacity of WMNs is an 
important question. The capacity analysis proposed for ad hoc 
networks can not be directly applied to WMN due to some 
fundamental differences, e.g. a different traffic pattern and 
node density. The main contribution of this work is the 
application of collision domains concept to the IEEE 802.16 
based WMNs. We consider a simple chain topology but the 
method can be extended to any arbitrary topology and the real 
world impairments (interference, fading, etc.) can be easily 
incorporated in the analysis. The presented results may have 
important implications for 802.16 mesh networks planning.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Broadband wireless internet access is becoming more and 
more popular nowadays. This is especially true since the 
introduction of IEEE 802.16 standard for local and 
metropolitan area network, called WiMax, in 2001. 
However, all the deployed WiMax installations use point-to-
multi-point (PMP) mode of operation. The revision of 
802.16 standard published in 2004 specified an optional 
mesh mode, where the nodes operate not only as hosts but 
also as routers, forwarding packets on behalf of other nodes 
that may not be in the range of the base station. WMN may 
form a self-configured and self-organized wireless backhaul 
network, which can be deployed incrementally, one node at 
a time, as needed, replacing a more costly wired backbone. 
However, multihop wireless communication is a relatively 
new idea and requires much research effort to analyze and 
optimize its performance. 
In this paper we will concentrate on capacity aspects of 
WMN [1], with special emphasis on 802.16 standard [2]. 
Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to investigate 
the capacity of ad hoc networks, but their results can not be 
directly applied to WMNs due to several reasons which will 
be explained in Section II. Section III shortly describes 
802.16 MAC protocol and the specific features of the mesh 
mode of operation. In Section IV we will show how the 
concept of Collision Domains, presented by Jun et al. in [3], 
can be applied to 802.16 mesh networks to estimate the 
capacity. This will be followed by discussion of nominal and 
effective load of the 802.16 Collision Domains as well as 
construction of collision domains in multi-channel and multi-
radio configurations. We will show numerical results 
obtained using the approach presented before and their 
verification by means of computer simulation in Section V. 
Finally, the work will be concluded in Section VI, where the 
possible directions for future work will be presented as well. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
In the past decade a lot of research have been devoted to 
determining the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks. In the 
fundamental work by Kumar and Gupta [4] the analytical 
lower and upper bounds of stationary network capacity have 
been derived and it has been shown that the throughput 
capacity per node reduces significantly when the node 
density increases. In [5] the authors analyzed ad hoc 
networks allowing node mobility and showed, that, if long 
delays are tolerated, the capacity remains constant with the 
number of nodes. The other interesting results related to this 
work have been presented in [6] and [7]. 
However, most of the results valid for ad hoc networks can 
not be directly applied to mesh networks due to some 
fundamental differences. They have been identified in [3] 
and are discussed below: 
A. In ad hoc network the traffic flows between any arbitrary 
pair of nodes while in WMN practically all the traffic is 
gateway oriented. WMN’s BS acts as a hot spot and may be 
a bottleneck of the whole network’s capacity. 
B. Topology of the WMN is rather stable, with new nodes 
occasionally joining or leaving the network, while an ad hoc 
network can change dynamically in both, number of nodes 
and number of links/connections.

C. There are no energetic constraints, nodes have access to 
external power sources. 
D. As a consequence of C. nodes can have multiple radios 
which can increase throughput capacity significantly. 
E. The number of nodes and the required bandwidth in 
WMN may be higher than in ad hoc network. 
F. Most of the results focused on the theoretical analysis for 
the asymptotic case. The resulting capacity bounds do not 
reflect the exact capacity of the WMNs with a given number 
of nodes. 
Consequently, another methods of WMNs capacity 
estimation must be developed, which will be discussed in the 
next sections.

OVERVIEW OF 802.16 MESH MAC PROTOCOL 
The mesh mode of operation, introduced in 802.16d 
standard, is an important extension to the original PMP 
mode, with the advantage of less path loss, coverage and 
robustness improving exponentially as nodes are added to 
the network and larger user throughput over multi-hop paths 
[8], [9]. 
The TDMA MAC protocol designed for the mesh mode 
supports both centralized and distributed scheduling. In the 
centralized mode the mesh base station (BS), providing the 
connectivity to the wired backbone, is responsible for 
collecting bandwidth requests from subscriber stations (SS) 
and managing resource allocation. In the distributed mode, 
transmissions are scheduled in a fully distributed manner, 
without requiring any exchange of control information 
between the SS’s and BS. Since decisions are taken locally 
by nodes, based on their current traffic load and channel 
conditions, the distributed mode is more flexible and 
responses quickly to the network requirements. Therefore, 
we will focus on the distributed mode only. 
The TDMA frame structure used in the mesh mode is 
illustrated in Fig. 1. It is divided in the control and data sub-
frames. The control sub-frame consists of 16 slots 
(transmission opportunities) and the data sub-frame is 
divided into multiple mini-slots. The control slots are 
accessed by nodes based on the distributed election 
procedure. Every node competes for the transmission 
opportunity using its neighbors’ scheduling information and 
the procedure ensures that in a two-hop neighborhood there 
is only one node which can transmit its control message at a 
time. 
The control slots are used to convey several types of control 
messages. Bandwidth negotiation is performed using MSH-
DSCH (Mesh Distributed Schedule) message, which 
contains the schedule and data slots allocation of the 
broadcasting node and its neighbors. Consequently, each 
node can obtain scheduling information of its two-hop 
neighbors and data packet transmission is collision-free in 
the entire extended neighborhood. A three-way handshake 
procedure is used for data slot reservation. The negotiation 
phase consists of three steps: 
1. the transmitting party sends out a request,  
2. the receiving party responds with a grant,  
3. the requester then confirms the indicated grant. 
Such a mechanism is required since not all nodes are in the 
same transmission range in a mesh network [10].

COLLISION DOMAINS IN 802.16 WMN 
A. Definition of collision domains in 802.16 WMN 
The concept of collision domains was applied to WMNs 
capacity calculation for the first time by Jun at al. in [3]. 
The method is based on the fact that the existence of 
gateways in WMNs introduces hot spots in the network 
that act as bottlenecks. Identifying the bottleneck collision 
domains allows computing exactly the minimum and 
maximum data rates available for each node for a given 
network topology and link layer protocol. The concept 
was further developed by Aoun and Boutaba in [11], by 
considering fairness to ensure proper operation of WMNs. 
However, all the previously listed research considered 
802.11 based WMNs only or did not take into account the 
specification of the MAC protocol at all. One of the key 
strength of the collision domains approach is the ability 
to include any MAC layer implementation by redefinition 
of collision domain. This is simply done by imposing a 
set of constraints (specified by the MAC protocol) on the 
links between nodes communicating in the mesh network. 
The main contribution of this work is the application of 
collision domains concept to the 802.16 based WMNs, as 
specified in the 802.16 standard [2]. For clarity, let us 
78

consider a simple chain of 
N = 8
 nodes (SSs) receiving 
and forwarding traffic from the gateway (BS). We will 
assume that the traffic is unidirectional (downlink), the 
bidirectional case will be treated later in Section VI. We 
define the collision domain 
4
CD  for link 
k =4
 (between 
SS3 and SS4) as follows (see Fig. 2): 
- the requester (SS3) broadcasts a Request message, 
notifying nodes SS2 and SS4 of its request – we include 
links 3 (SS2 → SS3), 4 (SS3 → SS4) and 5 (SS4 → SS5) 
in the collision domain 
4
CD , 
- the receiver (SS4) responses with a Grant message, 
indicating the granted data slots to nodes SS3 and SS5 – 
we add link 6 (SS5 → SS6) to the collision domain 
4
CD , 
- finally, we add link 2 (SS1 → SS2) to the collision 
domain 
4
CD , this step is done since node SS2 advertises 
its availability before node SS3 sends its grant 
confirmation (because of the cyclic way the control 
schedule is designed) and node SS1 is aware of the 
pending transmission in its extended neighborhood (and 
specifically between nodes SS3 and SS4), 
- additionally, node SS1 will not accept any requests from 
BS (since SS1 is in the interference range of SS3) and, 
therefore, we add link 1 (BS → SS1) to the collision 
domain 
4
CD . 
Unfortunately, the multi-hop hidden terminal problem 
has not been effectively eliminated in 802.16 MAC 
protocol. Referring again to Fig. 2, due to the 
uncoordinated channel access of node SS6, which is 
outside the extended neighborhood of node SS3 and may 
cause collisions at node SS4, we must include link 7 (SS6 
→ SS7) in the collision domain 
4
CD .

B. Nominal and effective load 
The definition of the collision domain presented in 
previous section allow us to compute the traffic to be 
forwarded within the collision domain. Assuming that 
each node in the chain (see Fig. 2) downloads from the 
gateway the traffic of 
[
]s
Ld bit
/
, a link which is closer to 
the gateway has to carry more traffic, e.g. link 1 (BS → 
SS1) has to carry the load of 
[
]s
Ld bit
/
8
 while link 6 has 
to carry 
[
]s
Ld bit
/
3
. Since each collision domain has to 
be able to forward the total load of its links, the collision 
domain

. If the 
bandwidth (the capacity of the MAC layer) for each link 
in the collision domain is constant and equal to [

B bit
/
, 
the throughput 
d
L  available to each node in the chain is 
limited to 
Ld < B 35
 (for the considered collision 
domain 
4
CD ). In order o find the collision domain which 
is limiting for the network (so called bottleneck collision 
domain) we have to identify the collision domain and its 
load for every link in the network and find the minimum 
throughput 
d
L  [3]. 
The load of collision domain presented so far leads to a 
pessimistic value of the throughput 
d
L  and is called the 
nominal load [11]. Instead, the effective load gives a 
more accurate estimate of the throughput by considering 
the spatial channel reuse, which is typical for multi-hop 
links in WMNs. Due to the spatial separation of links in 
the collision domain simultaneous transmissions are 
possible and should be deducted from the total load of the 
collision domain. Referring again to Fig. 2 we find out 
that link 2 (SS1 → SS2) can transmit simultaneously with 
link 6 (SS5 → SS6 - node SS2 is outside the interference 
range of node SS5) and we reduce the nominal load of 
collision domain 
4
CD  by the load of the lower loaded 
link in the pair. Similarly, link 1 (BS → SS1) can 
transmit simultaneously with link 5 (SS4 → SS5) and 
link 3 (SS2 → SS3) can transmit simultaneously with 
link 7 (SS6 → SS7). The effective load of the collision 
domain

 and the throughput

available to each node in the chain is limited to 
Ld < B 26
 (25% gain over the nominal load). 
C. Impact of link adaptation (MCS) 
The physical layer of 802.16 mesh mode is based on 
WirelessMAN-OFDM/TDD and features link adaptation 
(Modulation and Coding Scheme - MCS) for better 
utilization of radio resources [2]. Consequently, the raw 
data rates may vary from 2.40 Mb/s to 26.18 Mb/s (for 7 
MHz channel), depending on the receiver SNR, which, in 
turn, is a function of propagation conditions as well as 
network topology. 
With link adaptation every link in a specific collision 
domain may apply different MCS, which impacts the

collision domain load – now the load of every link must 
be scaled by the inverse of its bandwidth. Let us consider 
a simple example of a WMN consisting of two SSs 
downloading equal traffic 
[
]s

 from the BS. 
Assuming identical bandwidth B  for both links the 
collision domain load is equal to

 and the 
throughput

Ld < B 3
. However, if the 
bandwidth of the link 1 (BS → SS1) is twice that of the 
link 2 (SS1 → SS2), i.e. B
2
, the load of the collision 
domain is calculated as 
d

 and the

Generally, for the collision domain

links characterized by load 
iL  and bandwidth

following equation must be fulfilled:

The quantity 
Li Bi
 defines the percentage of time 
available for link i, since the transmission time (in other 
words the available resources) must be shared among all 
links forming the collision domain to carry all its load. 
D. Capacity increase in multi-channel mode 
The 802.16 mesh MAC protocol is designed primarily for 
multi-hop networks operating in a single channel. 
However, the nodes can employ up to 16 multiple non-
interfering channels [2] for data transmission to increase 
the available throughput for nearby nodes, which can not 
exploit spatial reuse. Assigning additional channels is 
known to be one of the most effective ways to increase 
WMN capacity [8]. 
The collision domain concept presented so far can be 
easily extended to incorporate the WMN operating in 
multiple channels. This requires re-defining collision 
domains, having in mind both the specific MAC protocol, 
as well as the existence of multiple frequency channels 
for parallel transmissions. Consequently, the construction 
of collision domains has to be performed for each 
specific channel assignment separately. 
Let us refer to the example discussed in section IV.A. 
Assuming the specific channel assignment, as shown in 
Fig. 3, we can remove from the collision domain 
CD4
(defined for link 4, which communicates over 
channel B) links 1 (BS → SS1), 2 (SS1 → SS2) and 6 
(SS5 → SS6), since they use channel A and do not 
interfere with link 4 (SS3 → SS4). Although link 5 
(SS4 → SS5) operates on channel A as well, it can not be 
removed from 
4
CD  due to the single-radio configuration 
of nodes (the node can not receive and transmit 
simultaneously). This reduces the nominal load of the 
collision domain

configured in multi-channel mode. 
E. Capacity increase with multi-radio nodes 
As we could see in the previous section assigning 
additional channels to the link chain can substantially 
decrease the load of the collision domain, increasing the 
available throughput of the WMN. However, even if the 
number of available channels is very high, the collision 
domain can not contain less than three links in a single-
radio configuration. This is caused by the fact that for a 
given link i both the transmitting node 
i−1
 and the 
receiving node i can not receive (node 
i−1
) nor transmit 
(node i) simultaneously with link i.  
This limitation do not exist in a multi-radio configuration 
any more. Since cost of radios and battery consumption 
are not limiting factors in a WMN, multiple radios can be 
placed in nodes to increase the capacity of WMN. 
Introducing multi-radio nodes releases the constraint 
limiting the capacity in multi-channel mode – now 
simultaneous reception and transmission (on different 
channels) is possible in every node. We refer again to the 
example discussed in section IV.A. If the specific channel 
assignment shown in Fig. 4 is applied, the collision 
domain 
4
CD  consists of links 3 (SS2 → SS3), 4 (SS3 → 
SS4) and 5 (SS4 → SS5), the nominal and effective load

respectively in the single-radio configuration. By adding

reduces to the link 4 (SS3 → SS4) with load

.

Fig. 4 Simple chain topology of WMN with 8 multi-radio 
nodes. 
However, as we will see in the next section, multi-radio 
configuration requires a careful selection of channel 
assignment scheme to be really effective. When the 
number of channels is limited, multi-radio configuration 
may have no impact on WMN capacity in the worst-case 
scenario. 
V. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS 
A MATLAB® script was used to evaluate the method and 
we considered a chain topology similar to that presented 
in Section IV. The script identifies the collision domain 
for every link and calculates the available throughput. The 
results were verified using a custom-coded 802.16 mesh 
mode MAC simulator, written in C++. 
A. Simple Chain Topology – Unidirectional and 
Bidirectional Traffic 
Let us first analyze a single node downloading data from 
the gateway through a chain of forwarding nodes. 
Assuming the bandwidth B normalized to 1, the 
throughput available to the downloading node changes as 
1 N
 for 
N ≤4
, and reaches 
.0 25
 for 
N >4
 (Fig. 5). The 
behavior is similar to 802.11 based chain [11], however, 
for 802.16 chain the nominal load of the bottleneck 
collision domain is 
7Ld
 and the effective load is equal to 
d
d
d
L
L

. 
If all nodes in the chain download the same traffic from 
the gateway the situation changes dramatically. In this 
case, for 
N ≥3
the collision domain 
4
CD  (SS3 → SS4) is 
the most congested and forms a bottleneck. If the traffic 
is unidirectional (downlink or uplink) the throughput 
decreases to 0.1 (per node) for 
N =4
 and becomes as low 
as 0.03 for 
N =10
 (see Fig. 6). For bidirectional 
asymmetric traffic with 
d
u
L
L
1.0
=
 (a value typical for 
ADSL links) the same throughput of 0.03 is reached for 
N =9
. If the traffic is symmetric (
d
u
L = L
), a similar 
throughput is obtained for 
N =6
.

B. Effects of Adaptive Coding and Modulation 
802.16 OFDM PHY layer used in the mesh mode features 
an adaptive coding and modulation scheme [10]. Using a 
modified version of the method presented earlier in this 
paper we can easily show the impact of the available 
bandwidth, which can vary from link to link, on the 
overall performance of the mesh network. 
Doubling the bandwidth on the links 1 to 5 increases the 
throughput almost linearly (Fig. 7), however, modifying 
subsequent links does not increase it any more. The most 
important is the fact that the substantial change of the 
bandwidth impacts the location of the bottleneck collision 
domain, which can be observed by increasing the 
bandwidth of some links to 
4B
. On the other hand, 
limiting the bandwidth to 
B 2
 or 
B 4
 on the links 1 to 4 
decreases the throughput up to 57% and 85%, 
respectively.

Fig. 7 Effect of adaptive coding and modulation – 
throughput vs. number of affected links in the chain. 
From the above we can conclude that the performance of 
the 802.16 WMN depends heavily on the bandwidth 
available on the links closer to the gateway, while the 
bandwidth of the other links do not impact the 
performance of the network substantially. 
Fig. 8 shows how the throughput is affected by changing 
the bandwidth of a single link in the chain. It should be 
noticed that the mesh network is more susceptible to the 
reduction of the bandwidth of the links than to its increase. 
This is important for 802.16 WMN planning, since the 
reduction of bandwidth of the links closer to the gateway 
reduces considerably the throughput available to all nodes. 
In the worst case scenario, limiting the bandwidth of 
link 1 to 
B 2
 or 
B 4
 decreases the throughput available 
to all nodes by 28% and 57% respectively.

C. Multi-channel mode 
As mentioned in the previous section, assigning 
additional channels is one of the most effective ways to 
increase WMN capacity. However, networks exploiting 
multiple frequency channels require very careful 
selection of number of channels as well as their spatial 
configuration. We analyzed several configurations with 2, 
3 and 4 channels, and some of the results are presented 
below. 
A comparison of different channel assignment schemes in 
2-channel configuration is shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. 
From this figures we can find out, that the load of the 
collision domain is minimized (and the throughput 
maximized) when the channels alternate as often as 
possible (AABB – throughput increased by 100% for 
N =10
), however, due to the limitations of the single-
radio configuration the assignment ABAB should be 
avoided (see Fig. 11 and Fig.12). 
Even if more channels are available for the 802.16 WMN 
at a given location, the throughput can be at most doubled 
in 
the 
single-radio 
configuration. 
The 
channel 
assignments schemes ABC and ABCD (Fig. 11 and

Fig. 12) as well as AABBCC (Fig. 13 and Fig. 14) 
performs identically as the previously analyzed AABB 
configuration. From this figures we can conclude, that in 
the simple 802.16 WMN chain and single-radio

radio channels and assigning additional channels does not 
increase the throughput any more. However, the results 
may differ considerably for the WMN with more realistic 
(complex) topology and interference model and we plan 
to investigate the issue more deeply in the future.

D. Multi-radio configuration 
The further reduction of 802.16 collision domains load, 
resulting 
in 
the 
increased 
throughput, 
requires 
introducing multi-radio nodes in the network. As argued 
in Section IV.E the collision domain can be reduced to 
the single link with the sufficient number of radio 
channels in this case.

Fig. 16 Throughput increase (relative to the single channel) 
for the channel assignments shown in Fig. 15. 
With two radio channels available to the WMN the 
throughput can be increased by 100% (Fig. 15 and Fig. 
16) in the multi-radio configuration. We obtained similar 
results in the single-radio configuration, however with 
multi-radio nodes the throughput is doubled for shorter 
chains, i.e. 6 nodes vs. 10 nodes in multi-channel case.

The advantages of the multi-radio configuration are fully 
exploited when more than two radio channels are 
available (Fig. 17). Adding one channel increases the 
throughput by 130% for 
N =10
 (ABCABC - Fig. 18), 
while four fold (300%) increase is observed for the 
10-node chain configured with four channels (ABCD).

A comparison of 3-channel multi-radio configurations is

configurations, adjacent links should avoid operating in 
the same channel since the multi-radio nodes can receive 
and transmit simultaneously, if assigned non-interfering 
channels.

Fig. 22 Throughput increase (relative to the single channel)

Fig. 21 and Fig. 22 summarize the benefits of the multi-
channel and multi-radio modes of operation of the 802.16 
WMN. We can see from these figures that the simplest 
but effective method of increasing the throughput 
requires adding the additional (and properly configured - 
AABB) radio channel. The further throughput increase is 
possible by assigning another channels (ABC, ABCD) 
and replacing single-radio nodes by multi-radio devices. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper we showed how the concept of collision 
domains can be applied to 802.16 WMN capacity 
calculation. The definition of collision domain is strongly 
affected by the MAC protocol used. Therefore it must be 
redefined for every mesh network standard. 
The collision domain concept proved to be exact, the results 
obtained by simulation of the 802.16 MAC layer are close 
to the theoretical analysis based on collision domains. We 
extended the method by allowing the variable bandwidth of 
each link, implemented in the 802.16 standard by the 
application of adaptive coding and modulation. The other 
extensions, like multi-channel and multi-radio terminals 
were included as well. The results obtained using the 
modified method may have important implications for 
WMN planning. 
However, the simple chain topology and the unrealistic 
interference model considered throughout the paper does not 
allow for any generalization of the results. We plan to adapt 
the method to the arbitrary topology of the 802.16 WMN. 
Since the collision domains are defined based on the 
interference among links, this can be done only after 
implementation of the more realistic propagation models in 
our collision domain identification algorithm.  
Finally, the mesh mode is very likely to be replaced by the 
relay solution in the new version of the 802.16 standard. 
Therefore, we will consider the application of the collision 
domain concept to the new mode as well as to the 
forthcoming IEEE 802.11s standard.
