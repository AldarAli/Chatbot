Abstract—Recently in the construction industry, because of the 
declining number of new employees and the aging of skilled 
workers, carpentry skills have not progressed. One means of 
transferring these skills smoothly is to train carpenter 
technicians 
at 
vocational 
skill 
development 
facilities. 
Nevertheless, it is difficult to spend much time at the basic tasks 
of carpenters, which include sharpening, chiseling, sawing, 
planing, and nailing, at such facilities. The development of an 
effective teaching method for carpentry work is desired. 
Therefore, we constructed a machine learning system to 
measure and evaluate the movements of unskilled workers. This 
study uses movements of skilled technicians and a questionnaire 
survey to evaluate the developed teaching method for tacit 
knowledge, i.e., intuition or knack, related to planing work.

 INTRODUCTION 
Structural forms of Japanese buildings include wooden 
structures, steel structures, reinforced concrete structures, and 
reinforced concrete structures. Among detached houses, 
according to data compiled by the Ministry of Land, 
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Construction statistics 
survey report 2018 [1], the percentage of wooden houses 
among detached houses exceeds 80%. Therefore, the wooden 
structure shown in Figure 1 represents the mainstream. 
In areas where wood suitable for building materials is not 
available, such as the Middle East, masonry is commonly used 
to support buildings with walls made of brick or earth. 
Japanese structures use abundant timber. In addition, 
buildings are supported by columns and beams. However, the 
population of Japanese carpenters who produce and maintain 
wooden houses is declining precipitously. According to the 
Census Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
Communications in 1975 [2], and a similar survey conducted 
in 2015 [3], the construction carpenter technician population 
has dropped by more than half in 45 years: from 852,745 
carpenters in 1975 to only 353,980 carpenters in 2015. 
Specifically examining the age structure, the proportion of 
15–39 year old people responsible for the future of the 
industry in 1975 was about 60%. By 2015 it had dropped 
considerably to about 20%.

The situation described above has come to represent the 
ordinary state of affairs. Therefore, the architectural carpentry 
industry must confront challenges hindering the passage of 
skills to inexperienced workers. One reason for this acute 
necessity might be that a longer time necessary to acquire full-
time construction skills after starting a job engenders a lower 
retention rate and a higher turnover rate. Therefore, acquiring 
and passing on skills efficiently and rapidly can contribute 
greatly to improving the employment rate of young people and 
to lowering of the turnover rate, in addition to helping to 
resolve shortages of human resources.

One means of transferring these skills smoothly is to train 
carpenter technicians at vocational ability development 
facilities. Vocational training at a vocational ability 
development facility is intended to develop and improve 
abilities by enabling students to acquire the necessary 
knowledge and skills for a profession. Because of recent 
diversification of employment, vocational development 
facilities 
must impart more knowledge 
and skills. 
Nevertheless, it is difficult to spend much time at the 
carpenter’s basic work in Japanese architecture, such as 
sharpening, chiseling, sawing, planing, and nailing. Therefore, 
an educational method must be developed that can teach 
carpentry work effectively in a short time. 
Planing work, which makes a wood surface smooth and 
glossy, is often applied to pillars in a Japanese-style room 
where the pillars are exposed. The planing work emphasized 
in this study is performed mainly on two pillars, as shown in 
Figure 1. This skill is particularly important for Japanese 
carpenters: improperly performed planing work can leave 
wood splintery and dangerous; also, roughly finished pillars 
will destroy the unique atmosphere of a Japanese room. 
From surveys of technical explanations and research 
papers published in Japan to date, we have learned the knack 
of planing work and how to teach related skills. In addition, a 
questionnaire 
survey 
related 
to planing 
work was 
administered to skilled workers to elicit planing work tips 
from workers. We also analyzed skilled and unskilled workers’ 
behaviors during planing work. Differences were clarified 
from motion analysis results [4],[5]. 
A huge amount of work and a great deal of time are 
necessary to compare motion analysis results manually. 
Conducting training efficiently requires rapid analysis of 
training data and provision of feedback promptly to trainees. 
Therefore, for this study, we are examining improvement of 
training efficiency using a system that analyzes and visualizes 
big data related to skills that can be acquired during training. 
As described herein, we summarize the possibility of training 
effects by machine learning in the field of vocational training 
based on analysis using k-means method for planing work 
training data. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents earlier research related to this topic. In 
Section III, we propose a K-means analytical method using 
data collected for planing work. Section IV presents a 
description of experimentally obtained results for our 
proposed method and a discussion of the results. Section V is 
a summary of the study contributions and expectations for 
future work.

RELATED WORK 
Chen et al. conducted a series of studies specifically 
examining motion analysis related to carpentry skills [6]–[8]. 
The studies and the results are described below. 
In one study [6], Chen et al. analyzed the same planing 
work as that examined in this study. They specifically reported 
details of measurement results of one of the four skilled 
workers. Results indicated that the posture during work should 
be “half-body”(diagonally opposite to the planing material). 
Half body is a posture similar to that shown in Figure 2, which 
portrays the posture with one leg before a half step from a 
standing position. 
 
Figure 2.  Half body (diagonally opposite to the planing material). 
They were able to classify planing work into four basic 
forms: a providing planing motion, a cutting motion produced 
by rapid closing of the elbow, a cutting motion resulting from 
a large backward movement, and sudden stopping of the 
planing motion. 
Chen et al. used a motion capture system to analyze 
sawing operations [7]. The report describes comparison of the 
sawing behaviors of skilled and unskilled persons. Results 
highlight their differences during work in terms of the 
forehead position, right arm movement, and saw speed. 
However, that report presented an analysis of few data. Its 
results are therefore regarded as being less generalizable. 
Features common to skilled people and those common to 
unskilled people were not described. Moreover, the analysis 
of measured values used no objective method such as an 
analytical statistical method or a clustering method. 
Research using a Kinect™ device (Microsoft Corp.) for 
motion analysis includes one study described by Kurebayashi 
et al. [8] with a developed system that can animate skeletal 
information measured using Kinect™. Furthermore, the 
system was used for a junior high school class: evaluations of 
the students’ feelings of use were assessed, showing high 
evaluations. Nevertheless, classification and organization of 
student motions were not performed using data obtained from 
this system. 
As described above, several behavioral analyses related to 
carpentry skills have been conducted, but results of only a few 
test subjects have been presented. Moreover, no objective 
method has been applied for data analysis. An earlier report 
[9] explaining various methods used to analyze big data is 
helpful for selecting an analytical method for big data 
obtained from many subjects, as in this study. Therefore, this 
study examines whether a difference between skilled and 
unskilled workers can be extracted by application of the K-
means method, a clustering method, to results obtained from 
numerous test subjects.

OUR PROPOSED METHOD 
This section presents a description of a method for 
analyzing data with machine learning using training data from 
planing work. 
A. Data collection 
In the experiment, the subject completed eight consecutive 
planing work bouts over the entire length of the work material. 
The subject's movements were measured using a Kinect™ 
sensor. In addition, the force generated during the work was 
measured using a strain gauge load cell (capacity 500 N). 
Figure 3 portrays the positional relation and axes for Kinect™ 
and the test subject. 
Kinect™ is prone to misrecognize skeletal information 
when measuring from a perspective that includes overlapping 
of body parts (e.g., the position information of the right and 
left elbows is switched). Therefore, Kinect™ was installed to 
give a perspective by which the body parts overlap to the least 
extent possible during operations, thereby mitigating 
misrecognition. The relation between the load direction and 
the axis during the planing operation is designated as the X 
axis; the pulling force is along the Y axis, with pushing force 
also occurring along the horizontal axis. The Z axis shows 
pushing force in the vertical direction. 
 
Figure 3.  Kinect™ and the subject's positional relation and axes         
(unit: mm). 
The work material was Japanese cypress material of 50 
mm width and 105 mm depth. The material length was 2000 
mm. The plane used for measurements was a replaceable 
blade-type intermediate finish plane. The plane blade 
adjustment was left to the working subject. Table 1 presents 
characteristics of five skilled workers (group J) and 10 
unskilled persons (group M). The author conducted motion 
analysis for them at a laboratory of Polytechnic University. 
Group J in this study mainly comprises artisans who have 
won prizes in the Skill Grand Prix. All were first-class 
technicians. Skills Grand Prix is a tournament for those with 
level 1 technical skills, especially those with outstanding skills. 
Group M members were 10 unskilled people: 5 third-year 
students and 5 fourth-year students from a Japanese 
polytechnic university studying architecture in 2018.

B. Preprocessing 
We used software (MATLAB; The MathWorks Inc.) to 
analyze skeleton position data measured using Kinect™ at 
0.03 s intervals. Table 2 presents data for one subject that were 
processed. Table 2 presents XYZ-axis values for 20 points of 
skeletal position data during planing work obtained from one 
shooting: the first column shows waist X axis data; the second 
shows waist Y axis data; and so on.

Among the data for 20 points of skeletal position 
information in Table 2, skeleton position information of the 
head, shoulder, waist, and left hand, which has been 
emphasized in earlier studies, is the subject of analyses in this 
study. Using these data groups, the data were processed into a 
machine-learning format for analysis using the k-means 
method. Table 3 presents an example of a dataset obtained by 
processing information related to the head, shoulder, waist, 
and left hand for each subject.

Data in Table 2 include those of eight consecutive planing 
works. Therefore, the data in Table 3 are divided into those of 
six planing works excluding the first and last planing work 
pieces. The time-series data of the location information for 
each planing work of each subject are arranged in one column 
as one dataset. A dataset for each XYZ axis value comprises 
head, shoulder, waist, and left hand data. Therefore, 12 
datasets are handled as one-dimensional data. 
For preprocessing, data are standardized: the average of 
each column data becomes 0. The time series of the data were 
also checked: abnormal behaviors (values that should have 
increased had decreased, etc.) were excluded from time series 
data for the corresponding single-cutting operation. 
The time required for a planing work piece differs every 
time. Therefore, the number of lines of motion data obtained 
in time-series differs for each planing work piece. Therefore, 
the number of rows in the dataset must be unified. Based on 
the planing operation with the longest planing work time, the 
blank after the other planing work was filled entirely with 
zeros. 
C. Analytical method 
Collecting large amounts of data has become easier 
because of improvements in computer processing speed and 
communication infrastructure. Furthermore, big data are 
analyzed and used in various fields. Performing this big data 
analysis manually would be very expensive and impractical. 
For this reason, machine learning, which can automatically 
obtain accurate results from large amounts of data in a shorter 
time than humans could reasonably achieve, is often used. 
Machine learning can resolve difficulties by inferring patterns 
from large amounts of data. Therefore, for this study, we 
decided to conduct analyses using the K-means algorithm, a 
method of unsupervised learning, as the first experiment to 
explore training effects using machine learning in the 
vocational training field. There are two reasons that the k-
means method was chosen as the machine learning technique. 
The first being simple clustering technique. The second is to 
explain many data in a short time. The author chose it because 
this k-means method meets both requirements for the purpose 
of this article. 
Equation (1) presents evaluation function f of the k-means 
algorithm. Data X are divided into arbitrary K clusters by 
finding the center of the cluster that minimizes Equation (1). 

f = ∑
min
௑ೕ∈௑ ௜∈௑ ฮ𝑋௝ − 𝑐௜ฮ
 
(1) 
Where Xj, j∈{1,…,n} represents each datum; n denotes 
the total number of data. Also, ci signifies the cluster center ii 
n{1,…,k}. The k-means method performs clustering by 
obtaining a cluster center that minimizes the distance between 
each data point and the nearest cluster center. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTS 
As described herein, we try to discriminate between 
movements of skilled and untrained persons based on 
acquisition of motion data. In doing so, we aim to clarify 
unique behaviors that are typical of skilled workers. 
A. Preliminary analysis 
First, cluster analysis was applied to divide the data into 
two by k-means using 12 datasets of XYZ axes of the head, 
shoulder, waist, and left hand shown in Section III.B as one 
matrix. A value of k was chosen as 2 is because it confirms 
the usefulness of the k-means method. In addition, one can see 
if clustering can be categorized broadly into skilled and 
unskilled people. The reason for choosing the head, shoulder, 
waist, and left hand is that they were also chosen in earlier 
studies [5]. One can ascertain the characteristics of the posture 
of the subject with planing work. Results show simple 
classification according to the length of time needed for the 
work. Work speed is an effective index for evaluating work 
movements, but specific movements common to skilled 
workers have not been clarified. Therefore, to exclude 
information related to work speed and to compare detailed 
movements in the planing work of the respective subjects, 
38

MMEDIA 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Multimedia

results demonstrated the necessity of conducting analyses 
using positional information aligned within a certain time 
interval. 
B. Experiment method 
This study specifically examines movements in the first 
few seconds of planing work and during the first few seconds 
before the end of the movement. Specifically examining the 
start and end of planing, they have their own movements. 
Therefore, the skill levels are easier to understand than during 
planing. To organize the time-series data of the obtained 
motion, the interval from the start to 2.25 s (initial interval) 
and the interval from 2.25 s before the end to the end time 
(final interval) were set. The reason to set the time to 2.25 s is 
the necessary amount of data to identify work trends. Then, 
the 75 time-series position information data included in each 
section were made into one matrix. The data were divided into 
two clusters using k-means. 
C. Experiment results for interval 
The experimentally obtained results for the initial interval 
presented in section IV.B are described in IV.C.1). 
Experimentally obtained results for the final interval are 
described in IV.C.2). 
1) Experiment results of the initial interval 
The analysis specifically examined movement for 2.25 s 
from the start of movement. Data were divided into two by k-
means for a matrix containing all data in the X-axis, Y-axis, 
and Z-axis directions (including the head, shoulder, waist, and 
left hand). Results show rough classification by skilled and 
unskilled persons. Figure 4 presents classification results for 
each planing work by skilled and unskilled workers obtained 
using location information in the initial interval. 
 
Figure 4.  Results of clustering by skeletal position in the initial interval. 
In addition, to ascertain which of the three directions is 
most effective for clustering, we divided the datasets in the X-
axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis directions and applied cluster analysis 
using each dataset to ascertain key factors for classification. 
As shown in Figure 4, results show that the movement in the 
X-axis direction had an effect. Therefore, the head, shoulder, 
waist, and left hand were clustered into two clusters using the 
k-means method to find out which part of the X-axis 
movement most affected clustering. As shown in Figure 5, all 
factors affecting the head, shoulder, waist, and left hand were 
confirmed as influential.

at the initial interval. 
2) Experiment result of the final interval 
These analyses specifically addressed the period of 2.25 s 
of movement until the end of movement. Data were divided 
into two parts using k-means for a matrix containing all data 
in the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis directions (including the 
head, shoulder, waist, and left hand). As described in IV.C.1), 
results show rough classification of skilled and untrained 
work. Figure 6 shows how planing work by a skilled person 
and by an unskilled person is classifiable using position 
information in the final interval. 
 
Figure 6.  Results of clustering by skeletal position in the final interval. 
In addition, to ascertain which of the three directions is 
most effective for clustering, after dividing the datasets in the 
X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis directions to ascertain key factors 
for classification, we applied cluster analysis using each 
dataset. Figure 7 presents experimentally obtained results for 
X. As in IV.C.1), results demonstrated that movement in the 
X-axis direction was affected. Therefore, the head, shoulder, 
waist, and left hand were clustered into two clusters by the k-
means method to ascertain which part of the X-axis movement 
most affected clustering. On the X-axis, all head, shoulder, 
waist, and left hand effects were confirmed.

Results presented above show that a feature exists in 
movement in the X-axis direction in the initial interval and 
final interval. To examine the factors that led to this analysis, 
we examined the video during the experiment and the raw data 
of the head, shoulder, waist, and left hand. Furthermore, all 
elements of the head, shoulder, waist, and left hand are 
affected. This effect might be attributable to the number of 
pauses used by skilled and unskilled persons during one bout 
of planing work. Skilled persons use a large forward-leaning 
posture because the pauses during planing work are few: 0–2 
times. This tendency was also observed for unskilled workers 
clustered in the same group as skilled workers. However, 
unskilled workers in different groups tend to use a slightly 
forward-leaning posture because they pause several times (1–
6 times) during planing work. Therefore, cluster analysis 
revealed differences between efficient work with few stops 
and work with numerous stops. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The purpose of this study was to construct a system to 
analyze and visualize big data related to training that can be 
acquired during vocational training. Then we conducted 
experiments to evaluate planing work to improve training 
efficiency, and found the possibility. The experiments 
specifically examined the initial interval and final interval, 
and included application of cluster analysis using k-means 
with position information obtained for four skeletal locations: 
the head, shoulder, waist, and left hand. Results show 
clustering of results by skilled and unskilled people. These 
results confirmed that applying simple machine learning such 
as k-means to planing work training data can engender useful 
analysis. This study used only four skeleton positions for 
analytical information. For that reason, only analysis that is 
related closely to the number of stops during planing is 
possible. In the past, analyses that were performed manually 
could be performed quickly using machine learning. The 
present study assessed clusters of skilled and unskilled people. 
Future studies, by performing clustering among unskilled 
people, are expected to provide optimal skill instruction for 
individual groups. Therefore, in this paper, we were able to 
analyze only the number of stops during planing. Future 
studies will use analytical methods to generate posture data 
from the measured three-axis data assess methods to analyze 
data for the load applied to the work material during planing 
work operations. Promoting this research can improve 
training effects in the field of vocational training by producing 
a continuous support system using machine learning.
