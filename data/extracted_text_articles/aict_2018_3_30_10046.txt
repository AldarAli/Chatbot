Abstract‚ÄîUtilization of massive Multiple-Input Multiple-
Output (MIMO) arrays for reliable data transmission at a very 
high bandwidth efficiency is one of the key techniques required 
for the Fifth-Generation (5G) wireless systems. In order to 
steer data beams to various moving targets including vehicular 
and aerial objects, new types of array structures are under 
study. One of promising candidates for such structures is the 
spherical array based on polyhedrons. In this paper, we 
investigate how the icosahedron shape can be used to perform 
full-dimensional beamforming to multiple receivers, and 
propose codebooks applicable to such a transmission scenario. 
The correlation performance of the proposal is verified for 
different codebook sizes, which is shown to exceed the greedy 
search algorithm performance.

I. INTRODUCTION 
For next-generation wireless systems, connectivity to 
various types of moving objects including self-driving cars 
and drones is becoming an important issue. In order to 
provide a sufficient coverage to such objects, full-directional 
beamforming capable of performing vertical tilting of all 
zenith angles is required. Utilization of Three-Dimensional 
(3D) antenna arrays on a spherical structure can be especially 
advantageous in such transmission scenarios [1]. Spherical 
arrays are generalization of uniform circular arrays which 
mainly target azimuthal transmission [2], and can be 
combined with millimeter-wave carriers to formulate beams 
based on a sufficiently large number of antenna elements 
located in a compact-size structure [3]-[5]. Arrays on 
geodesic domes have been investigated for satellite 
communication applications [6],[7].  
In this study, we investigate an efficient beamforming 
strategy based on spherical arrays and propose codebooks 
applicable in a limited-feedback environment. We assume a 
polyhedron-based array, for which antenna elements are 
located on vertices of the icosahedron. The boresight of each 
antenna element form a 3D sector, partitioning the whole 
isotropic space into 12 sectors. At each antenna location, a 
set of antenna elements or a subarray can be used for sharper 
beams with more flexible beam tilting adjustment. This type 
of sectorization can be regarded as an extension of high-
order sectorization used in 3GPP cellular system design in 
the conventional 2D space [8]. 
In Section II, the proposed codebook design is explained, 
followed by the performance evaluation result in Section III. 
Conclusions are given in Section IV.   
II. SECTORIZED CODEBOOK DESIGN 
Our strategy is to determine the beamforming vectors for 
each sector, and apply those vectors to other sectors as well 
by performing coordinate transformations. Figure 1 shows 
the sectorization of 3D space using the 12 antennas in the 
spherical array. As can be seen from the figure, each sector 
has the form of pentagonal pyramid, and we can indicate the 
beamforming direction of each vector at its base. Note Am 
denotes the m-th coverage sector, (Œ∏q, œÜq) represents the 
codevector location, and (Œ∏q‚Äô, œÜq‚Äô) is the location after 
transformation. Figure 2 is an illustration of such indication. 
With a single representative codevector at the antenna 
boresight, we evenly distribute the remaining vectors at a 
certain angular distance. The distance is determined by the 
correlation measure between the geometric channel and the 
codevector, in such a way that the average correlation is 
maximized. We progressively use more beamforming 
vectors to include Q = 2B entries in the codebook as the 
number B of feedback bits increases.

Constructed codebook C = {w1, w2, ‚Ä¶, wQ} includes 
codevectors wq for which the phase vector has the form  
 
          Phase(wq) = ‚Äì(2œÄ/Œª) [ d0, d1, ‚Ä¶, dM ‚Äì 1 ]T 
 
for q = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, Q, where Œª is the carrier wavelength, M is 
the number of antenna elements, and dm is the distance 
between the m-th antenna and the target receiver. The 
distance is determined using the geometry characteristics of 
the array polyhedron. For the antenna elements located at 
vertices of icosahedron, the distance has the form of  
 
dm = sin Œ∏ sin Œ± cos (œÜ ‚àí Œ≤) + cos Œ∏ cos Œ± 
 
where œÜ and Œ∏ are position angles for the codvector points in 
Figure 2. Symbols Œ± ‚àà {0, 31.7o, œÄ ‚Äì 31.7o, œÄ} and Œ≤  ‚àà {0, 
œÄ/10, 2œÄ/10, ‚Ä¶, 9œÄ/10} are obtained from the geometry 
information of icosahedron. By computing the distances, the 
codebook of a given size is obtained and the corresponding 
performance can be evaluated.  
III. PERFORMANCE  
We evaluated the average correlation performance of the 
proposed sectorized codebook for different codebook sizes. 
The result is summarized in Figure 3. As the codebook size 
increases, the correlation rapidly approaches to unity, the 
performance 
for 
beamforming 
vectors 
with 
infinite 
resolution. We found the case with the codevectors pointing 
the antenna boresight at the sector center (indicated as Type 
A in the figure) outperforms the case without them (indicated 
as Type B). We also have constructed search-based 
codebooks using the greedy algorithm, by successively 
selecting the beamforming vector, which is most preferred 
by the random channel location samples. As can be verified 
from the figure, the proposed Type A codebook exhibits 
enhanced performance over the search method.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
We proposed the codebook which can be applied to the 
3D space covered by spherical arrays. The design can be 
generalized to different array structures including geodesic-
based spheres and those including antenna subarrays. 
Planned future work is the multi-rank extension exploiting 
the orthogonality of the spherical beams.
