Abstract - This paper explores the vulnerability of social 
network users to identity theft facilitated by the information 
they share on social networking sites. While social networking 
presents new possibilities for friendships and the sharing of 
interests, at the same time it brings vulnerability through the 
outflow of personal information online. Identity criminals can 
exploit the weaknesses of social network users and social 
networking sites, effectively enabling the identity criminal to 
construct an identity from the information they obtain. The 
information gathered by an identity criminal can be used to 
establish identity, a powerful precursor to committing identity 
fraud. While there are preventative mechanisms that can 
reduce the incidence of this crime, information sharing on 
social networks is common and voluntary, which makes it 
difficult to control. While this paper presents an evaluation of 
existing work, further empirical research work is needed to 
understand the vulnerability of personal information on social 
networking sites.  Social networking sites have a vested interest 
in promoting rather than preventing the sharing of 
information.  In addition, identity crime is pervasive, which 
makes the amelioration of the risks difficult.  In concluding 
this paper, efforts are made to point toward starting points 
that will assist in resolving this crime.    
Keywords- social networking; identity theft; identity fraud. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Social networking has inspired computer users to share 
information online. Social networking sites bring together 
people with common interests and enable mass social 
interaction to take place. This overcomes geographical 
constraints and can bring together disparate groups [1]. 
Social networking is attractive due to its social inclusiveness 
[2] as well as its interactive nature [3]. For example, 500 
million people have used Facebook to create profiles to 
express themselves across this social networking platform 
[4]. The social linkages created by such sites bring together 
new social associations as well as new ways to interact 
online including instant communication and gaming [4]. In 
this regard, there have been many narratives about both the 
positive and negative social implications and influences of 
this social interaction [5]. Criminal activity has been a 
negative implication of such interaction and this one 
seemingly harmless type of human interaction has lent itself 
to another that is far more sinister: identity crime. 
 
This paper will first consider why the identity crime is 
serious in the context of the strong uptake of social 
networking which has been mentioned. The paper will then 
discuss the responses to dealing with identity crime and 
social networking that include deliberating the suitability of 
criminal law and privacy responses to this crime. Thereafter, 
the paper will discuss the challenges in dealing with identity 
crime and social networking.  Finally, the paper will provide 
some recommendations arising from this paper and 
foreshadow future work.   
II. 
THE EMERGING ROLE OF SOCIAL NETWORKING IN 
INFORMATION SHARING 
The extent to which individuals share information on a 
social networking site is determined by the decisions they 
make which are influenced by many drivers. The control 
mechanism used on a social networking site is typically the 
user privacy settings, which allow an individual to determine 
the visibility of their social networking profile to others. A 
social networking profile is the mode in which social 
networking users represent themselves online and facilitates 
their existence on the social networking site. The 
dissemination of information is at the heart of social 
networking [6]. The opportunity to share information is 
attractive to users who aspire in particular, to share their 
emotions, expressions and experiences online [7]. A key 
driver for social networking sites is the reciprocal nature of 
such information sharing [8]. Social networking sites finely 
balance the security needs of user with the ease of use and 
much of the research around changing the architecture of the 
interface has been previously explored [9]. Such sharing of 
information provides the foundation under which many 
relationships are formed [10] as well as the basis for 
rekindling relationships with old friends [11]. In addition, 
many social networking sites also contain incentives for such 
information sharing to take place whether by promoting the 
creation of these friendships, sharing general interests or 
religious beliefs, and numerous other motivators [8]. Many 
positive outcomes can be derived from social networking.  
 
Social networks have become an alternative to 
communication in many traditional social contexts [12]. 
Increasingly communication takes place online and social 
169

networking has become a platform that functions in place of 
(or in conjunction with) existing social contexts. However, 
social networking is a relatively new phenomenon and many 
of the social conventions around it are still developing [13]. 
It may be for this reason that many users are complacent 
about the potential risks associated with the sharing of 
personal information on this platform. Studies related to 
information sharing suggest that gender also influences the 
preparedness of users to share information, with boys and 
men being prepared to share information online more freely 
than girls and women [14]. Furthermore, younger men are 
seemingly more prepared to share information than older 
men [15] and it may be that factors like peer pressure play a 
role in this.  Nonetheless, there seems to be complacency in 
relation to the risks associated with information sharing on 
social networking sites. Many users share information about 
themselves that includes their full names, their location, date 
of birth and also photographs [10]. This can be the 
information required by identity criminals to form an identity 
that can be used to perpetrate crime. 
 
When information is acquired by an identity criminal, in 
most instances it is taken without the knowledge or consent 
of the victim [16]. In this sense, the victim might not be 
aware that their information has been stolen until they find 
themselves exposed to crime-related financial liability. 
Hence, the motivation for the identity criminal is typically 
monetary gain [17]. Such crime involves the collection of the 
information required to replicate the identity of the victim 
[18]. Once stolen, the identity criminal will typically use the 
name of the victim to commit fraud: identity fraud [19]. 
Information taken from a social networking site can be used 
to establish a false identity. The documents needed to 
establish identity vary, but most governments accept a range 
of identification documents to establish it [20]. By world 
standards, name, gender, nationality and date of birth are 
considered unique personal identifiers that collectively 
satisfy identity requirements [21]. Indeed, many of these 
details are commonly shared on social networking sites. 
When this information is used, many victims will not know 
that they have become victims until some considerable time 
has passed [22]. The time between when an identity crime 
occurs and an investigation takes place makes it difficult to 
gather evidence of the crime and to both locate and prosecute 
the offender [22]. During this time, the victim withstands the 
frustration of financial losses caused by such crime and 
research has shown that this frustration worsens the longer it 
takes for the situation to be resolved [23]. The subversive 
nature of this this crime ultimately adds to a victim’s 
frustration.   
III. 
WHY IS THIS CRIME SERIOUS? 
Identity crime has the potential to reach anyone.  Research 
conducted at Carnegie Melon University suggests that 
children 15-18 years of age (43%) are the age group most 
likely to be victimized by identity criminals. Of the other age 
groups, children aged 11-14 years (28%), 6-10 years (19%) 
and five years and under make up the balance of victims 
[24]. However, at the same time, it is evident that children of 
working age are at risk due to their levels of income as well 
as their relevant engagement with technology [25]. Overall, 
these victims present fruitful targets to identity criminals. 
While it is not clear what the reasons for this might be, it is 
probable that the risk of victimisation is linked to increased 
levels of engagement with technology [26]. Inadequate 
levels of supervision of children’s Internet usage, particularly 
with respect to social networking may also contribute to this 
[27]. Children have a particular vulnerability to identity theft 
crime as they usually possess an unblemished personal 
history and remain relatively undefended as targets of this 
crime [24]. This increases their status as prime targets of 
identity criminals. In addition, children often unknowingly 
share information about themselves that can place them at 
risk [28]. From these indicators of victimisation, it becomes 
clear that identity fraudsters are opportunistic when it comes 
to the perpetration of this crime and anyone can become a 
victim. 
 
In the United States in 2009, an estimated 11 million 
Americans had been the victims of identity crime [20]. In 
2010, 7% of households in the United States experienced 
identity theft victimization, [29] amounting to about 8.6 
million households [29]. Similarly, in 2010-2011 the 
estimated cost of personal fraud to Australians was $1.4 
billion [30] with approximately 44,700 Australians becoming 
victims of identity crime [31]. Statistics from the United 
Kingdom similarly suggest that identity crime is increasing 
prodigiously with the reported number of cases almost 
doubling between 2007 and 2012 from 77,500 to 123,600 
[32]. These statistics suggest that identity crime is global and 
significant in terms of both its impact and cost.     
  
The cost of identity crime is often regarded as being 
comprised of both direct and indirect costs. The most 
significant cost of identity crime is the financial cost [33]. 
However, the true cost of identity crime extends beyond 
financial loss [34]. These have been referred to as the 
difference between direct and indirect costs or hard and soft 
costs [34]. The financial costs (the hard costs) are easily 
quantified whereas the non-financial costs (soft costs) are 
more difficult to quantify as they relate to the cost of 
preventative measures as well as damage to reputation [34]. 
The cumulative losses reflect both the hard and soft costs of 
identity fraud crime. Obtaining accurate measures of the true 
cost is also influenced by the lack of data available on this 
crime [34]. The banking sector suffers significant losses in 
relation to identity crime [35] but its spokespersons remain 
reluctant to disclose the losses arising from this crime. 
Interestingly, bank losses in the United States have been 
estimated to amount to over $2 billion per year [36]. 
However, the banking sector prefers not to report these 
losses due to the commercial sensitivities they perceive them 
[37]. This contributes towards the difficulty in establishing 
measures on the true cost of identity crime. The key issue 
this raises relates to the strength of responses which remain 
linked to the commensurate strength of that response [38].

Ultimately, there are costs related to identity crime, which 
are more easily identified, and those that are not, many of 
which are not considered in connection with one another.   
IV. 
DEALING WITH IDENTITY CRIME AND 
SOCIAL NETWORKING 
There are many practical difficulties in convicting identity 
criminals [39]. In the first place, in an international context, 
no central body is responsible for overseeing crime 
committed via the Internet or where on the Internet this 
crime might occur. Identifying and controlling crime 
perpetrated through social networking sites is fraught with 
difficulties [40]. The Internet is a dispersed communication 
entity that permeates country boundaries thereby making 
regulatory responses to crime difficult [40]. Further, different 
values influence the way in which crimes are viewed.  
Interpol increasingly plays a role in dealing with cybercrimes 
like identity crime by having a programme to deal with the 
emerging threats in this realm [41]. The Council of Europe 
Cybercrime Convention aims to harmonise the regulation of 
cyber-crimes [41]. It provides domestic criminal law 
authorities with the necessary cooperative mechanisms to 
investigate and prosecute computer crimes [41]. However, 
like most international instruments, crimes require attention 
through domestic laws [42]. Success will therefore be 
dependent on the stance maintained by each country in 
question.  
 
The term ‘cybercrime’ has been used to describe crimes in 
which the computer or computer network is typically the 
target. This crime is distinguishable from other traditional 
crimes as it is limited to where the computer is used in the 
crime [43]. This thereby includes frauds in which the 
computer is used as a tool to commit the crime [43]. 
Likewise, if identity crime takes place through the use of a 
computer it is arguably included within the scope of the 
convention. However, the European Convention fails to deal 
directly with identity crime [44]. It captures computer-related 
forgery (article 7) as well as computer-related fraud (article 
8) and thereby by association it would apply to related 
offences [45]. The significance of this is that the 
abovementioned convention would assist in the investigation 
and enforcement of identity crime despite not making 
reference to it [46]. In a global sense, unfortunately, there is 
nothing simple about applying criminal sanctions to 
international crimes like identity crime, particularly when 
they fall outside globally acknowledged atrocities such as 
genocide. Even so, the effectiveness of such responses is 
reliant on the preparedness of countries to agree and 
cooperate on responses to crime. 
V. 
PRIVACY PERSPECTIVE 
International responses to privacy share some of the 
challenges with the international regulation of crime. There 
is a lack of supremacy and centrality when it comes to the 
regulation of privacy internationally [46]. Akin to crime, 
domestic laws which are often based on international 
agreements are similarly relied upon to regulate privacy [47]. 
International principles of privacy protection are provided 
for in international agreements like the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights [48]. These international agreements 
recognise the protection of the inalienable rights of all 
humans to privacy [48], highlighting the need for them to 
enjoy freedom of speech and belief [48]. Further, Article 12 
suggests that no one should be subjected to interference with 
respect to their privacy [48]. Such international agreements 
have provided the foundation for the development of 
domestic laws [47]. Australia has been a member of the 
United Nations since 1945 [48] and has thereby developed 
such laws domestically. This can be seen in the 
Commonwealth Privacy Act, which provides for how 
information is collected, used and disclosed within Australia 
[49]. However, a limitation of the domestic privacy response 
in Australia is that it is not prescriptive and rather offers 
guidelines on the use of personal information. Further, it is 
constrained by the same jurisdictional boundaries that limit 
the extraterritorial reach of criminal sanctions explained 
above [50]. These are barriers to resolving the privacy-
related issues of identity crime arising through the use of 
social networking. 
VI. 
CHALLENGES IN DEALING WITH THE SOCIAL 
NETWORKING NEXUS WITH IDENTITY CRIME 
A major challenge in responding to identity crime is the 
ability of law enforcement agencies to obtain evidence for 
the prosecution of this crime. The gathering of evidence on 
this crime involves obtaining digital evidence both on and 
off line [49]. It is essential for such investigative efforts 
across geographic borders to be effective as so much of 
crime such as identity crime takes place using the Internet, 
particularly due to the way in data are disseminated on social 
networking sites. The speed with which data transference 
takes place on the Internet makes the investigation of identity 
crimes difficult as the data possessed or used by a criminal 
can be destroyed or manipulated just as quickly [51]. 
Furthermore, as identity crime is cross jurisdictional then 
cooperation between law enforcement authorities is essential 
[52]. Any successful effort to investigate and enforce identity 
crime is reliant on the cooperation of countries [52] and the 
success of such efforts will also be dependent on the speed of 
such a response.  In relation to civil responses to identity 
crime, there are similarly many barriers on the ability of the 
individual to successfully take civil action against the 
criminal as individuals have a greater scarcity of resources to 
successfully pursue such action.  Similar issues around 
detecting and locating the offender exist for these actions 
also. 
 
A key weakness in the integrity of data is the way in 
which individual users manage their own information. Users 
need to accept the need for greater accountability for the 
information shared on social networking sites. Each activity 
171

ICDS 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Digital Society

we engage in results in users leaving traces of themselves 
like digital footprints.  Therefore, a commonsense response 
to dealing with the exploitation of social networking by 
identity criminals is for social networking users to improve 
their level of education about the relevant issues [49]. An 
educational program is necessary to ensure social networking 
users are both aware of the risks and of the need to exercise 
caution with respect to their personal information [53]. 
Moreover, in relation to the second point, this should take 
into account the ways in which, information might 
potentially be misused by identity criminals [54]. While 
education could have a direct impact on crime reduction [55] 
there will always typically be a proportion of the population 
not responsive to such efforts. The role of education is 
therefore not exhaustive but still should be regarded as 
another way of dealing with this crime. Social networking 
sites themselves should accept some responsibility in the 
protection of the user by encouraging the tacit sharing of 
personal information in some instances. This should be 
broader than the general technological security measures in 
place and needs to include the architecture underpinning the 
sites use [56]. This should involve reconsidering the ways in 
which, information sharing takes place on such sites and 
consideration of the architecture that facilitates this. Identity 
crime can be reduced through better understanding of and 
mitigation of these risks [57].   
 
A number of additional and general technical responses 
can be applied to prevent identity crimes. The responses 
include improved measures of authentication and encryption, 
but are not limited to these [58]. The aim of such 
technological responses is to ensure data integrity is 
maintained while correspondingly preventing unwanted 
misuse of information or intrusion [59]. However, as with 
most responses, such efforts have vulnerabilities by way of 
the advancements criminals make to overcome them [59]. 
The strength of the responses to identity crime often needs to 
be balanced against the perceived costs of such preventative 
action [60]. Nevertheless, these responses provide additional 
ways of dealing with information security and thereby 
provide another way in which, identity crime can be 
responded to. 
VII. 
DISCUSSION 
Ultimately, policymakers should consider a multi-faceted 
approach for dealing with identity crimes [61]. A mixture of 
techniques is necessary for counteracting the threats of this 
crime as the crime is ubiquitous response [62]. There are 
limitations with any approach to dealing with this crime, 
some of which have been discussed in this paper. The 
relationship of social networking and identity crime is unique 
and thereby requires creative responses. A major obstacle to 
responding to social networking and identity crime is the 
availability of accurate data relating to this relationship. 
While not all conceivable approaches to dealing with this 
phenomenon have been canvassed in this paper, the ones that 
have provide some insight into the many issues presented by 
this crime as well as some view of the plausible ways 
forward.  
 
The information that is disseminated through the use of 
social networking is the key catalyst to identity crime which 
is largely based on the actions of individual users.  The 
motivation for this research has been to explore the 
relationship between identity crime and social networking 
which has scarcely been explored in existing literature and to 
establish a basis upon which further research might take 
place. Further empirical research is needed to further probe 
the parameters of this relationship.  It is hoped that through 
raising awareness of this relationship that further research 
interest is generated and that through further research, that 
social networking users will can take greater precautions to 
prevent themselves from becoming victims of this crime.   
VIII. 
EVALUATION 
The material discussed in this paper, largely from 
secondary sources, identifies a relationship between social 
networking and identity crime. To further develop the 
contention, empirical research is needed to explore the scope 
of this relationship.  In terms of the responses to this 
phenomenon, this paper has explored a number of 
technological and non-technological responses which are by 
no means exhaustive. Further research into the relationship 
between social networking and identity crime is likely to 
provide insights into the mechanisms that might better deal 
with this crime.  
IX. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Information is the vehicle to identity theft and 
considerable information is stored on social networking sites.  
Law and technological responses have limitations in relation 
to the extent they can mitigate this crime and particularly 
given the voluntary nature of information dissemination and 
the issues around jurisdiction and cooperation discussed. The 
individual vulnerability to this crime is through personal 
identification information which ultimately means that the 
behavioural factors are important to understanding the crime 
and indeed mitigating risk. Therefore, it is hoped that 
through the dissemination of research and information that 
individuals may become better informed of the risks inherent 
in the activities they engage with on the Internet: particularly 
social networking. Individual users of social networking 
need to take greater responsibility for the personal 
identification information shared on social networking sites 
to avoid victimisation. In this respect, if behavioural norms 
can be changed on social networking sites then the risk 
inherent with identity crime can be reduced.  
X. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Social networking has encouraged many users to share 
personal information online, and social network users 
frequently engage in the sharing of information about 
172

themselves [9]. This article has considered the way in which 
social networking can potentially nourish the transference of 
personal information on the Internet, which in turn can 
provide identity criminals with the information needed to 
commit identity crime. While there are many ways to 
respond to this crime, a blend of techniques is likely to work 
best, given the pervasive nature of this crime and barriers 
presented by multiple jurisdictions. Future work is needed to 
explore these responses. An important starting point for 
dealing with this crime is to increase awareness of the risks 
associated 
with 
information 
sharing 
around 
social 
networking. If you have read this far, then this paper has 
achieved some of its educational aim: perhaps you will be 
more careful with your social networking profiles in the 
future. More research is needed to develop further 
knowledge about this crime and similarly more research is 
needed to understand the data surrounding identity crime and 
the nexus of this to the responses to it.
