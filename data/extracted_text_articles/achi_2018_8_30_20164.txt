Abstract—The aim of this study was to examine player 
behavior in two different levels of visual aesthetic quality of a 
tablet game user interface.  First, the tablet game was created 
by applying user centered design principles, such as 
prototyping and usability testing in an iterative manner. The 
game was then modified into two different visual aesthetic 
conditions – monochromatic (low quality) and in full color 
(high quality) to serve as response stimuli.  The first objective 
examined the effect of visual aesthetic quality on user 
engagement using the user engagement scale (UES). The four 
components of user engagement are reward, aesthetics, focused 
attention, and perceived usability. It was observed that three of 
the user engagement components, reward, aesthetics and 
usability significantly predicted perceived high visual aesthetic 
quality interface. 
In 
addition, 
three 
user 
engagement 
components, 
reward, 
aesthetics 
and 
focused 
attention, 
supported perceived visual aesthetic quality for the low-quality 
interface. 
This 
result 
was 
further 
substantiated 
by 
investigating the effect of perceived usability in the same 
experimental condition using the AttrakDiff questionnaire. The 
main finding of this study reveals that high visual aesthetic 
quality user interfaces are perceived to be usable whereas low 
visual aesthetic interfaces are not. There was also a significant 
difference in the level of overall user engagement between the 
two game interfaces, as participants found the high visual 
aesthetic quality to be more engaging.

design; user engagement; perceived usability; visual aesthetics.

 INTRODUCTION  
The ubiquitous property of tablet gaming has contributed 
to a wider demographic of users [1] [2]. Clearly the rate of 
tablet adoption is due to an innovation that has been 
perceived to have a greater relative advantage by the end-
users, as per the Diffusion of Innovations Theory [3]. 
Digital games arise from a wide spectrum of genres, 
classifications, and categories; technology acts as a catalyst 
for the changing medium of game interaction, from consoles 
to touch screen devices. In fact, traditional keyboard and 
console-based games are dramatically shifting to the more 
affordable touch-screen games for tablets and mobile 
devices [4]. The advent of touchscreen computing has 
revolutionized the field of Human Computer Interaction 
(HCI) as it has become part of our everyday life and 
experience [5]. The mobile platform has tremendous scope 
for developing newer types of games, targeted to a broader 
demographic of users [1]. Designing digital games for a 
broader audience is complex in the sense that all users have 
their own preference and motive in terms of game genres, 
such as action, adventure, or serious games. There is 
unanimous acceptance among researchers and practitioners 
in the HCI field that applications must be designed with the 
inclusion of non-task-related concepts [6], which Mahlke 
[7] positions as non-instrumental quality and other 
researchers describe as hedonic components [8]–[11]. 
Instrumental quality is also referred to as the pragmatic 
aspect of product quality which incorporates functionality, 
usability, practicality, and utility; non-instrumental quality 
on the other hand encompasses visual aesthetics, and 
hedonic qualities such as pleasure, enjoyment, and fun. 
Therefore, it becomes pertinent to design “engaging 
experiences” in products, to captivate and enrich user 
experience (UX) by adding playful and fun features in 
games [12].  A method to engage end-users is to create user-
centric applications based on user needs and satisfaction.  
HCI practitioners have linked UX to components beyond 
instrumental quality to include hedonic, visual aesthetics, 
affective, 
emotions, 
and 
“experiential" 
technology-
interaction [13]–[15]. The roles of instrumental and non-
instrumental qualities in products have been closely studied 
over and again by several scholars [7] [16]–[18]. There has 
been no consensus on the relationship between usability and 
visual aesthetics in the domain of product design, or 
interactive design. Some researchers have lengthily 
discussed the concept of what is “beautiful is usable,” 
signifying that a “beautiful” object influences usability [19], 
while other scholars have shown that there is no relationship 
between usability and visual aesthetics [20] or the factors 
are independent from each other [7]. User engagement is 
part of a positive UX [21]. Carr [22] explains that game 
players are able to make choices and important decisions 
during gameplay by virtue of the visceral characteristics of 
visual elements. This implies that users make judgment 
based on both cognitive and emotional capabilities [23], 
induced by visual elements [24]. It becomes essential to 
examine user perceptions and behavior during gameplay 
interaction. This will provide a deeper insight why users are 
attracted and engaged to play games [7]. The main objective 
of this study is to examine the effect of visual aesthetic 
quality on four components of user engagement [25] in 
tablet game interfaces. According to extant literature, no 
distinction has been made concerning the level of visual 
aesthetics in products that have an impact on usability. The 
second objective attempts to bridge the knowledge gap by 
providing insights to identify the level of visual aesthetics in

user interfaces that influence usability. Section II provides 
an overview of the literature review. Section III justifies the 
methods, including data gathering procedure. Section IV 
elucidates the analysis and results portion. Section V 
concludes the paper. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW  
It has been argued that the components associated with 
usability, such as effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction 
alone cannot be a sole predictor of UX. The inclusion and 
assessment of hedonic and experiential attributes concerning 
human technology interaction such as pleasure, fun, 
enjoyment, and engagement are necessary to close the loop 
[26]. A game interface connects a player’s experience to the 
gaming system; hence it becomes imperative to understand 
user engagement, UX, and emotional outcome, along with 
the characteristics of the tablet user interface. It is clear that 
mobile devices have a set of new features (touch screen, 
camera, GPS, etc.) over game consoles that offers different 
mode of interactions. According to Cyr et al. [27, pp. 951], 
aesthetics has demonstrated to have a “positive effect on 
user perception on mobile system's ease of use, usefulness 
and enjoyment.” However, the impact of the degree of 
visual aesthetic quality (low or high) on perceived usability 
is not clear.   
O’Brien and Toms [25] conducted a study in the e-
commerce domain to explore the hedonic and utilitarian 
motivation with regards to user engagement in the online 
shopping domain. The hedonic and utilitarian motivation 
and engagement include both functional and pleasurable 
aspects of UX and the hedonic qualities of product attributes, 
such as entertainment and utilitarian concepts including 
efficiency, cost, and functional attributes influence user 
engagement. Consequently, several studies have been 
conducted to assess user engagement in the domains of 
video games [28], online news [29] [30], and web searching 
[31]. UX examines the quality of information interactions 
from users’ perspective [21]. User engagement forms part of 
UX, as the positive side of user interaction is accentuated, 
whereby technology can entice and motivate the user 
towards product use [32]. User Engagement is defined as a 
user-product relationship encompassing an emotional, 
cognitive and behavioral bond that prevails over time [6]. 
User Engagement encompasses the initial reaction of users 
towards technology [33] as well as the continuous use and 
re-engagement with the information system over time [34] 
[35]. Engagement is determined by factors like visual 
aesthetics, 
system 
usability, 
user 
involvement 
and 
evaluation of the experience [34]. It was recommended that 
the term “engagement” should replace “satisfaction” as the 
latter does not signify the experience a user is drawn into a 
user interface [36]. User attitude towards the system is part 
of engagement and focused on the thoughts of individual 
users [37], “feelings” [38], “their degree of activity” [37], 
and “during system use [39]”. O’Brien and Toms [40] 
devised the UES scale to measure user engagement by 
assessing user perspective of perceived usability, aesthetics, 
novelty, felt Involvement, endurability, and focused attention. 
In this study, it was recommended to combine novelty, felt 
involvement and endurability into one factor called reward, 
because they all formed part of the hedonic aspects. By 
contrast, perceived usability, aesthetics and focused 
attention emerged to be typically different from each other 
in the UES scale study. Wiebe et al. [28] recommended to 
use fewer constructs in the UES scale. Hence, the UES scale 
was reduced to four factors: perceived usability, aesthetics, 
focused attention and reward [29].  
A description of the user engagement scale components is 
provided 
as 
follows. 
Researchers 
have 
associated, 
endurability to an experience in which users will remember 
the most gratifying moments during an activity, and will 
most likely repeat those activities again [41]. It is also 
associated to user loyalty. Novelty covers a new idea or 
concept pertaining to game narrative or storytelling, or a 
creative method for a player to interact with the game user 
interface, which may give rise to elements of surprise or 
excitement during gameplay. It arouses a user sense of 
curiosity [42]. Felt involvement is described as a fun 
experience which sustains user interest in an interactive 
environment which may arise from an emotional connection 
between the interface and the user [28]. Focused attention is 
defined as a high-level concentration and absorption of 
one’s mental state into an activity, which resonates with the 
flow theory, whereby the notion of time is lost when a user 
is fully immersed into the activity at hand [26]. Aesthetics 
appeals to the senses. Engholm [43] defines aesthetics as the 
“sensuous qualities, the emotions, moods, and experiences” 
that occur while interacting with a product. Visual aesthetics 
refers to the appearance the user interface, depicted as the 
top-most visible surface layer of the UX model [44]. 
Perceived usability is defined as the ease of use, the 
practical side of a product use, with goals such as efficiency, 
effectiveness, and user satisfaction in specific contextual use 
(ISO 9241-11). 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The objectives of this study were: (i) to examine the 
relationship between visual aesthetic quality and perceived 
game usability (ii) to examine the impact of visual aesthetic 
quality on game engagement. A convenience sample frame 
of fifty-six participants were recruited for the first objective 
on a university campus in the US. Thirty-five participants 
took part in the second objective. The within-subject tests 
minimized error variance individual differences between 
treatments. Participants were randomly assigned to each 
treatment to create equivalent conditions and to control 
extraneous variables across conditions. Participants selected 
for this study were between 18–35 years old. Perceived 
game usability data were collected using the dimensions 
related to pragmatic quality (PQ) of the AttrakDiff 
instrument. The dimensions related to visual aesthetics 
quality (AT) of the AttrakDiff instrument were used to 
160

gather data related to the perceptions of visual aesthetics 
[25]. PQ is comprised of seven bi-polar items, and is related 
to the perceived usability assessing ease of use. Similarly, 
AT consists of 7 bi-polar items, aimed to measure the 
perceived visual aesthetics of the game user interfaces. The 
procedure involved a within-subjects test whereby the same 
participant interacted with both game versions. Each 
participant was randomly assigned to play either the low or 
high visual aesthetic game version in order to ensure high 
internal validity; according to Law of Probability, this 
ensures that two equivalent groups are created [27]. A high 
visual aesthetic quality of an iOS adventure game was   
primarily created; the same interface was modified into a 
low-quality visual aesthetic condition by violating the 
Principles of Design, such as rendering low-bits graphics 
and reducing the contrast between foreground elements and 
the background. Each game session lasted for 10 minutes. 
At the end of each game session, participants were 
instructed to complete the 7-items of the PQ and the 7-items 
of the VA section of the AttrakDiff instrument, and the 31-
items of the User Engagement Scale (UES) questionnaire. 
The original UES is a self-report instrument which consists 
of the following constructs: usability, aesthetics, focused 
attention, novelty, endurability, felt involvement to capture 
user engagement. In this study, data from the three 
constructs novelty, endurability and felt involvement were 
combined as a single construct called reward.  
IV. 
 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
The first objective of this study was to examine if a 
variation of the visual aesthetic quality (low or high) a game 
user interface influences perceived game usability. The 
perception of usability data was first inspected for normality 
of distribution and verified for ANOVA assumptions. The 
boxplots did not reveal any extreme outliers or skewness. 
The bell-shaped curve, though slightly skewed to the right, 
confirmed that the data were normally distributed. During 
the preliminary analysis, it was noted that the variability of 
the perceived usability for the high-quality visual aesthetic 
quality was higher than the low visual aesthetic quality 
version. The perceived usability result was reported using 
AttrakDiff-(PQ) while the perceived visual aesthetic quality 
result was reported using AttrakDiff-(AT) (Hassenzahl, 
2003).   
It was important to verify if the perceived visual 
aesthetic quality of the two game conditions were different. 
The result demonstrated that the perception of visual 
aesthetic 
quality 
was 
statistically 
significant, 
F(1,51)=76.997, p<0.05, n=52. The null hypothesis is 
rejected, inferring that there is a significant difference of 
perceived visual aesthetics between the quality for the two 
game user interfaces. The descriptive statistics reveal that 
the high visual aesthetic quality interface had a mean value 
of 4.89 whereas the low visual aesthetic quality was rated at 
3.91; the boxplot shows that high visual aesthetic quality 
interface had a higher variability, slightly skewed to the 
right. The partial eta-squared, np
2 = 0.602, and according to 
Cohen’s [45] guidelines, is considered a large effect. It is 
deduced that 60.2% of the variance in the dependent 
variable, perception of visual aesthetics, is accounted by the 
independent variable, visual aesthetic quality. 
A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to 
compare the mean values of perceived game usability in 
the two levels of user interfaces, low and high visual 
aesthetic quality. IBM SPSS result for the PQ dependent 
variable shows F(1, 55)=0.196, p=0.660, n=56. For the low 
visual aesthetic interface, the mean value of the perceived 
game usability was rated at (µ=4.84, SD 0.74) whereas for 
the high visual aesthetic interface, the mean value for the 
perceived usability was (µ=4.88, SD 0.79). Given that p-
value>0.05, this implies that the perception of usability of 
both conditions of the game interfaces was not statistically 
significant, as both the low and high visual aesthetic quality 
were deemed to be equally usable. It was deduced that there 
was no effect-size, as per Cohen’s guidelines [45], given 
that partial eta-squared, np
2 =0.004, which indicates that the 
independent variables, low and high visual aesthetic 
qualities, did not influence the dependent variable, 
perceived usability.  
Pearson Regression Analyses were conducted to have a 
deeper understanding of the relationship between (i) the 
independent variable – perceived high visual aesthetic 
quality of game interface, and the dependent variable - 
perceived game usability (ii) the independent variable – 
perceived low visual aesthetic quality of game interface, and 
the dependent variable, perceived game usability.  
The relationship between perceived game usability, as 
measured by AttrakDiff-(PQ), and perceived high visual 
game aesthetics, as measured by AttrakDiff-(AT), was 
investigated using Pearson product-moment correlation 
coefficient. Preliminary analyses were performed to ensure 
no violation of the assumptions of normality, linearity and 
homoscedasticity occurred. There was a weak, significant 
positive correlation between the two variables, r=0.298, 
n=55, 
p=0.035. 
The 
high 
visual 
aesthetic 
quality 
significantly supports perceived usability, as p<0.05. Given 
the value of R2=0.089, 8.9% of the variation in the response 
variable could be explained by the high visual aesthetic 
game version. It is reasonable to deduce that high visual 
game aesthetic quality has an effect on perceived game 
usability. 
In addition, the relationship between perceived game 
usability, as measured by AttrakDiff-(PQ), and perceived 
low visual game aesthetics, as measured by AttrakDiff-(AT), 
was investigated using the Pearson product-moment 
correlation coefficient. There was a weak, positive 
correlation between the independent variable, perceived low 
visual aesthetic quality, and the response variable, perceived 
usability, r=0.193, n=49, p>0.05 9 (p=0.185). Low visual 
game aesthetics did not significantly support the predicted 
perceived game usability. Given the value of R2=0.037, it is 
deduced that 3.7% of the variation in the response variable 
161

was accounted for by the independent variable. Therefore, it 
may not reasonable to rely on this equation to predict 
perceived game usability using the low aesthetic quality 
version of the game user interface. It is deduced that low 
visual game aesthetic quality does not have an influence on 
perceived game usability.  
The second objective was to evaluate the impact of 
visual aesthetic quality on user engagement in the same 
experimental setting. A repeated one-way ANOVA data 
analysis of the UES questionnaire revealed that there was a 
statistically significant difference of user engagement level 
between the two game versions, F(1,34)=18.05, p<0.05, 
multivariate partial-eta squared 0.348. Following the 
commonly used guidelines proposed by Cohen [45, pp.284–
7], (0.01=small, .06=moderate, 0.14=large effect), this result 
suggests a very large effect size. This result comprises all 
the four components of the UES instrument. Users were 
more engaged in the high visual aesthetic version of the 
game user interface, which scored a mean value of µ=2.92 
(SD 0.49) as compared to µ=2.67 (SD 0.45) for the low 
visual aesthetic version.

Four individual dimensions of UES were individually 
compared as shown in Table I. All the user-engagement 
constructs (reward, focused attention, aesthetics, usability) 
were rated higher for the high-quality visual aesthetic game 
user interface version, implying that participants were more 
engaged in that version. Participants found a significant 
difference between the low and the high visual interface in 
the case of aesthetics and reward, p<0.05. There was no 
significant difference in the case of perceived usability and 
focused attention between the two game conditions.  
In order to examine if the components of user 
engagement were influenced by each condition of visual 
aesthetic quality of game user interfaces, a multiple 
regression analysis was conducted to predict the continuous 
dependent variable, perceived visual aesthetic quality, based 
on the following four multiple independent variables: 
reward, focused attention, aesthetics, and usability 
In the case of the high visual aesthetic quality, there 
was linearity as assessed by partial regression plots and a 
plot of studentized residuals against the predicted values. 
There was independence of residuals, as assessed by a 
Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.455. Homoscedasticity was 
present, as assessed by visual inspection of a plot of 
studentized residuals versus unstandardized predicted values. 
No evidence of multicollinearity was found, as assessed by 
tolerance values greater than 0.1; the Collinearity Tolerance 
ranges from 0.325 to 0.681. The assumption of normality 
was met as assessed by the Q-Q plot. As shown in Table II, 
three components of user engagement, namely reward 
(p=0.001), aesthetics (p<0.005) and usability (p=0.008), 
(except focused attention, p=0.096) significantly predicted 
perceived high visual aesthetic quality of the game user 
interface, F(4, 34)= 7.739, p<0.005. R2 for the overall model 
was 50.8% with an adjusted R2 of 44.2%, a large effect size 
according to Cohen (1988).

No

to 0.726. The assumption of normality was met as assessed 
by the Q-Q plot. As shown in Table III, three components of 
user engagement, namely reward (p<0.005), aesthetics 
(p=0.008) and focused attention (p=0.04), (except usability, 
p>0.05) significantly predicted perceived low visual 
aesthetic quality of the game user interface, F(4, 34)= 5.214, 
p=0.003. R2 for the overall model was 41.0% with an 
adjusted R2 of 33.1%, a medium effect size according to 
Cohen (1988). 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The above results add an important contribution to the 
field of HCI. High visual aesthetic quality of game 
interfaces has an impact on perceived usability, whereas 
interfaces with low visual aesthetic quality are not perceived 
to be usable. The results from Table 1 show that visual 
aesthetic quality had an impact on the overall user-
engagement which was significantly different in each 
condition. The high visual quality game interface was more 
appealing as the colorful and crisp graphics sustained users’ 
interests; the look and feel of the game elements were 
perceived to be more user usable. Emotional visceral 
responses, which emanate from our subconscious minds, are 
elicited by virtue of the game aesthetic quality. Colors, 
attractiveness and layout are essential design aesthetic 
elements that can immerse a player during mobile gameplay 
[46]. The level of overall user-engagement was greater in 
the high visual aesthetic quality. 
Moreover, 
two 
components 
namely 
reward 
and 
aesthetics were perceived to be significantly different, as 
part of the engagement level in the two experimental 
conditions. This implies that a high visual aesthetic game 
user interface influences users’ perception of endurability, 
novelty and felt involvement, holistically referred as reward, 
signifying that there were aspects of the high visual 
aesthetic interface that were self-motivating, gratifying, 
exciting, fun and surprising. This kind of engagement level 
prompted the users to play the game again in order to derive 
those unique experiences.  
By contrast, the mean value of the two other components 
of user-engagement, focused attention and perceived 
usability, were not significantly different, and were 
perceived to be equivalent in either game interface. This 
leads to the conclusion that there are other factors besides 
visual aesthetics such as game mechanics and game 
narrative in tablet games that might have influenced 
focused-attention and perceived usability. 
A limitation of the current study is that it may not be 
generalizable to other game types due to the relative small 
sample size. Further research is required to examine how 
game characteristics and components such as game 
mechanics and narrative may affect focused attention and 
usability in game interfaces. For future work, a larger 
sample size should be considered, including random 
selection of participants to increase externa validity of the 
experiment. This study can also be repeated with different 
cultural and/or demographic populations. This current study 
builds upon a previous work in progress research study that 
was presented at ACHI 2016.
