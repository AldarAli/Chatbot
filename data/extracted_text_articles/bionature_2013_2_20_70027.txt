Abstract—According to the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), Green Growth means 
“Fostering economic growth and development, while ensuring 
that natural assets continue to provide the resources and 
environmental services on which our well-being relies”. 
Furthermore, since Sustainable Development provides an 
important context for Green Growth, The United Nations 
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) include the goal 
“Ensure environmental sustainability”, which considers four 
specific targets related to the development policies, the 
biodiversity loss, the proportion of people without access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation facilities and the 
improvement in the lives of slum dwellers. In this context, our 
paper aims to provide both analytical and empirical 
contributions for the monitoring of the MDG achievements. 
With this regard we firstly propose a Poverty-Growth-
Environment triangle, and then we analyze the available 
statistical evidence in order to summarize the current progress 
and 
future 
perspectives 
towards 
the 
Environmental 
Millennium Development Goals.

 INTRODUCTION 
The increasingly industrialized and interconnected world 
is experiencing harmful environmental changes, which could 
threaten future human wellbeing. 
In this context, the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) has launched the 
Green Growth initiative, which –according to [1] – aims 
“Fostering economic growth and development, while 
ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources 
and environmental services on which our well-being relies”. 
Green growth can be considered as a subset of 
sustainable development, since it is narrower in scope, 
focusing on measurable progress at the interface of the 
economy and the environment.  
Appropriate information and comparable data are 
required in order to track progress towards green growth, and 
with this aim, the OECD is exploring a list of suitable 
indicators, which should consistently combine economic and 
environmental information, leading to a System of 
Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) which is 
currently in progress. 
The challenge of ensuring environmental sustainability is 
also 
included 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development Goals (MDG). More specifically, four 
different targets are specified within this goal, including a 
total of ten indicators, which allow monitoring the progress 
towards the environmental objectives. 
In this paper we firstly describe the Poverty-Growth-
Environment relationships and their connections with the 
environment 
targets 
included 
in 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals. 
Then, we focus on the available indicators in order to 
quantify progress towards these targets, also analyzing the 
regional disparities and testing for convergence. 
Finally the paper ends with some concluding remarks and a 
list of the main bibliographical references. 
II. 
GREEN GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL MDG  
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide a 
combination of human needs and basic rights that every 
individual around the world should be able to enjoy. More 
specifically, the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
adopted in the General Assembly Resolution 55/2 (year 
2000) by 189 State Members established certain fundamental 
values including freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, 
respect for nature and shared responsibility, leading to a set 
of specific and measurable objectives known as the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) to be achieved by 
2015.  
The eight agreed goals are respectively referred to 
poverty, primary education, gender equality, child mortality, 
maternal 
health, 
diseases 
as 
AIDS 
and 
malaria, 
environmental sustainability and global partnership. In this 
paper we mainly focus on the seventh goal, described as 
“Integrate the principles of sustainable development into 
country policies and programs and reverse the loss of 
environmental resources”, which includes four specific 
targets and a list of ten indicators, as summarized in Table I. 
A detailed description of these indicators appears in [2]. 
The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 
requires concrete strategies and special attention to the most 
vulnerable people, countries and regions. Therefore, we 
adopt 
the 
conceptual 
framework 
proposed 
by 
F. 
Bourguignon in his Poverty-Growth-Inequality triangle 
described in [3], assuming that “the rapid elimination of 
absolute poverty, under all forms, is a meaningful goal for 
development”. Within this context, Figure 1 illustrates the

environmental MDG.

More specifically, speaking in terms of the MDG targets, 
we should focus on halving by 2015 the proportion of people 
without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic 
sanitation, and achieving by 2020 a significant improvement 
in the lives of slum dwellers. Both objectives are related to 
the Poverty vertex of the triangle.

Development Goals 
In a second stage, a balance should be found between the 
objectives of growth and environment, whose relationships 
have been widely studied, leading to a controversial debate 
mainly focused on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). 
Inspired in the inverted U-shaped relationship between 
inequality and per-capita income proposed by Simon 
Kuznets [4], the Environmental Kuznets Curve holds that 
environmental quality initially worsens with the increases in 
per-capita income, but then improves after an Income 
Turning Point (ITP).  
Since a wide variety of empirical investigations regarding 
the EKC have been published during the last decades, some 
meta-analyses have been recently developed in [5] and [6]. 
As expected, results indicate that the estimated EKC-type 
relationships 
depend 
on 
several 
aspects 
as 
data 
characteristics, environmental indicators or methodological 
choices.  
III. 
MONITORING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE MDG  
Three years to the deadline, broad progress on the MDGs 
has been reported by United Nations [7], especially 
regarding the reduction of extreme poverty and the 
proportion of people without access to improved sources of 
water, and the improvement in the lives of slum dwellers. 
Nevertheless, achievements were unequally distributed 
across and within regions and countries. Moreover, progress 
has slowed for some MDGs after the international crisis, 
which has significantly impacted the economic perspectives 
thus affecting the odds of achieving the required targets. 
With the aim of providing a more complete description 
of the progress towards the environmental goals during the 
last decades and the future perspectives for 2015 and 
beyond, in the next sections we present a spatial analysis 
based on the United Nations Database.  
 
A. Poverty Targets 
Since the poverty reduction should be considered a 
priority, we firstly focus on poverty indicators, which have 
shown a good behavior according to the 2012 Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
Report 
[7]. 
More 
specifically, 
preliminary estimates confirm that the first target of the 
MDGs (cutting the extreme poverty rate to halve by 2015 its 
1990 level) will be achieved at the global level. 
This report also emphasizes that number of people living 
in extreme poverty (with less than 1.25 dollars a day) and the 
corresponding poverty rates are falling in every developing 
region, including Sub Saharan Africa, where the figures are 
particularly higher. 
Regarding the environmental goals, the reduction of 
poverty is the aim of targets 7C (halving the proportion of 
people without access to safe drinking water and basic 
sanitation) and 7D (achieving a significant improvement in 
the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers). According to 
the 2012 MDG Report, the world has already met the target 
of halving the proportion of people without access to 
improved sources of water, and improvements have been

achieved in the lives of 200 million slum dwellers, thus 
exceeding target 7D. 
In order to provide a more detailed analysis of these 
achievements we can compute a Performance Index, defined 
as: 

I t = Xt - X1990
X * - X1990

where X1990, Xt, X * respectively denote the 1990 value, the 
current value and the proposed target. This index has been 
recently computed in [8], showing outstanding progress for 
poverty goals while the lowest levels correspond to AIDS 
spread, child mortality and access to primary education.   
Table II summarizes the results obtained for target 7C, 
showing significant differences between regions (Eastern 
Asia shows the best behavior while the worst corresponds to 
Sub Saharan Africa) and also between indicators 7.8 and 7.9 
(the progress achieved with regard to access to drinking 
water is higher than the improvement in sanitation facilities). 
Furthermore, differences also exist between rural and 
urban areas (although this information is not collected in the 
table), being the rural performance higher than the urban 
indicator.

Regarding target 7D, Figure 2 represents the proportion 
of urban population living in slums, showing a positive 
evolution with the exception of Western Asia, whose figure 
increases during the last decade. Nevertheless, the worst 
situation corresponds to Sub Saharan Africa, with more than 
63% of its urban population living in slums.  
On the opposite side, an outstanding improvement is 
found in Northern Africa, whose initial situation was similar 
to that of Latin America and Caribbean, but has gradually 
decreased leading to the lowest proportion of urban 
population living in slums. Positive behaviors are also found 
in Southern, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, whose figures 
decreased significantly.

B. Environmental MGDs and regional convergence 
The previously proposed Performance index cannot be 
computed for most environmental goals, since they do not 
provide a specific target. Nevertheless, progress towards the 
MDGs can be approached through the cumulative growth 
rate, computed as:

Besides 
summarizing 
the 
MDG 
achievements, 
cumulative growth rates provide a useful tool in order to 
analyze regional disparities or test for convergence. Thus, 
table III summarizes the main regional results referred to 
eight different environmental targets (only 7.4: proportion 
of fish stocks within safe biological limits and 7.5: 
proportion of total water resources used, have been excluded 
due to the lack of information). 
In general terms, the obtained results agree with the 
expected signs, leading to negative rates of growth for the 
proportion of species threatened with extinction (7.7), the 
proportion of urban population living in slums (7.10), and 
the consumption of ozone-depleting substances (7.3). 
Table III also shows a parallelism in the behaviors of 
developing regions and the world as a whole. This fact is 
quite interesting and leads to the question of regional 
convergence. 
Furthermore, 
as 
we 
have 
previously 
said, 
the 
achievement of the MDGs is particularly important for poor 
regions and countries, thus suggesting the need of testing for 
convergence. With this aim we have tested, for each of the 
considered indicators, if the cumulative rates of growth are 
inversely related with the initial registered values, referred to 
year 1990.

The estimation results are summarized in Table IV, 
suggesting the existence of convergence only for some of the 
considered indicators.  
 
More specifically, only two out of eight regressions lead 
to significant coefficients at the one percent level (related to 
indicators 7.3 and 7.8) while two more estimated coefficients 
result to be significant at the five percent level. 
Nevertheless, we must stress that all the estimated 
coefficients, even when non-significant, show negative sign, 
thus excluding the existence of divergence.

IV. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) include the 
challenge 
of 
achieving 
environmental 
sustainability, 
specifying four targets referred to the development policies 
(7A), the biodiversity loss (7B), the proportion of people 
without access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities 
(7C) and the improvement in the lives of slum dwellers (7D). 
With the aim of monitoring the progress towards the 
environmental MDGs, we have assumed a Poverty-Growth-
Environment framework, thus considering poverty (targets 
7C and 7D) as a first priority, and then focusing on the 
growth-environment goals (targets 7A and 7B). 
Following this approach and according to the available 
information, we can conclude that progress has been made 
during the last two decades, although significant disparities 
remain between different regions and targets. 
Thus, our results confirm that Sub Saharan Africa 
performance is particularly poor for most of the considered 
indicators, while Eastern Asia performs quite well in most of 
the considered goals.  
Regarding 
convergence, 
the 
regressions 
of 
the 
cumulative rates of growth on the initial values lead to 
negative estimated coefficients for all the considered 
indicators, but only half of them result to be significant at the 
5% level.
