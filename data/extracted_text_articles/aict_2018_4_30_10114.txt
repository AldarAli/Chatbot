Abstract—A Gaussian function to clip multicarrier modulation
is presented in this paper in order to decrease their Peak to Aver-
age Power Ratio (PAPR). The Gaussian clipping (GC) function is
a soft non-linear function which keeps constant the average power
of the signal, what is a characteristic of great importance in real
transmission. The characteristics and performance of this GC is
analysed both theoretically and by simulation. Furthermore, in
the application context of Wiﬁ IEEE802.11, this GC is compared
to several other clipping functions well known in the literature
such as hard clipping, smooth clipping and deep clipping. The
results prove that the average power is kept constant which was
our objective.
Index Terms— PAPR; Clipping; Gaussian Clipping.
I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), al-
though used in standards such as IEEE 802.11a/g, IEEE
802.16, Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) [1] and 4G cellular
system/LTE suffers from the high Peak-to-Average Power
Ratio (PAPR). Large PAPR requires a linear High Power
Ampliﬁer (HPA), which is inefﬁcient. Moreover, the com-
bination of a non linear HPA and large PAPR leads to in-
band distortion and out-of-band radiation [2]. Several PAPR
reduction techniques have been proposed [3]- [6]. The simplest
way to reduce PAPR is to deliberately clip and ﬁlter the OFDM
signal before ampliﬁcation. However, clipping is a nonlinear
process and may cause signiﬁcant distortions that degrade
the Bit Error Rate (BER) and increase adjacent out-of-band
carriers [7]. The contribution of this paper is the following:
• ﬁrst, we propose a new clipping function, the Gaussian
Clipping (GC) function, which has the main advantage,
compared to other clipping functions from the literature,
to keep constant the average power.
• second, we analyse both theoretically and by simulation
the performance of this GC, in terms of PAPR reduction
gain and average power variation.
• third, we compare the GC performance with those of
other clipping functions in terms of average power and
BER in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) context.
In Section II, we recall the basic idea of OFDM and we de-
scribe the PAPR problem. In Section III, we ﬁrst describe clip-
ping functions already known in the literature. In Section IV,
we present our Gaussian clipping function. Section V deals
with theoretical performance. Then Section VI presents some
results and performance comparison, in a WLAN environment,
of different clipping functions and ﬁnally we conclude the
paper.
II. OFDM SYSTEMS AND PAPR ISSUE
The basic idea underlying OFDM systems is the division of
the available frequency spectrum into several subcarriers. To
obtain a high spectral efﬁciency, the frequency responses of
the subcarriers overlapp in an orthogonal way, hence the name
OFDM. This orthogonality can be completely maintained
with a small price in SNR degradation, even though the
signal passes through a time dispersive fading channel, by
introducing a Cyclic Preﬁx (CP).
The continuous-time baseband representation of an OFDM
symbol is given by
x (t) =
1
√
N
N−1
P
k=0
Xkej2πfkt,
0 ≤ t ≤ Ts ,
(1)
where N data symbols Xk form an OFDM symbol X =
[X0, · · · , XN−1], fk =
k
Ts and Ts is the time duration of
the OFDM symbol.
In practice, OFDM signals are typically generated by using
an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT).
The OFDM symbol represented by the vector X
=
[X0 · · · XN−1]T is transformed via IDFT into Ts/N-spaced
discrete-time vector x = x [n] = [x0 · · · xN−1]T , i.e.
xn =

(2)
In this paper, the discrete-time indexing [n] denotes Nyquist
Rate samples. Since oversampling may be needed in practical
designs, we will introduce the notation x [n/L] to denote over-
sampling by L. Different oversampling strategies of x [n/L]
can be deﬁned. From now on, the oversampled IDFT output
will refer to oversample of equation (2), which is expressed
as follows:
x [n/L]
=

The above expression (3) can be implemented by using a
length-(NL) IDFT operation with the input vector

Thus, X(L) is extended from X by using the so-called zero-

middle of X, i.e.,

where S1 and S2 are the set of In-Band (IB) indices and Out-
Of-Band (OOB) indices respectively.
In the literature, the envelope variations of x [n/L] are
often described in terms of the crest-factor (CF), peak-to-mean
envelope power ratio (PMEPR) or simply peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we adopt the term PAPR
to quantify the envelope excursions of the signal. The PAPR
of the signal x (t) may be deﬁned as
PAPR[x]
∆=
max
t∈[0,Ts] |x (t)|2
Px
,
(4)
where Px = E
n
|x (t)|2o
is the average signal power and
E {.} is the statistical expectation operator. Note that, in order
to avoid aliasing distortion into the data bearing subcarriers
and in order to accurately describe the PAPR, an oversampling
factor L ≥ 4 is required.
In the literature, it is customary to use the Complementary
Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the PAPR as a
performance criterion. It is denoted as
CCDF[x] (ψ)
∆= Pr

PAPR[x] ≥ ψ
	
.
If N is large enough, based on the central limit theorem,
the real and imaginary parts of OFDM x (t) follow a Gaussian
distribution and its envelope will follow a Rayleigh distribu-
tion. This implies a large PAPR.
III. SOME CLIPPING FUNCTIONS
In this Section, we present the clipping techniques family
[8]. Whatever the clipping technique to reduce OFDM PAPR
is, the output signal yn, in terms of the input signal xn is
given as follows:
yn = f (|xn|) ejϕn,
(5)
where ϕn is the xn phase and f (.) is the clipping function.
A. Classical Clipping (CC) technique
The Classical Clipping (CC) proposed in [7] is one of the
most popular clipping technique for PAPR reduction known
in the literature [9] [7]. It is sometimes called hard clipping
or soft clipping. To avoid any confusion, it is called Clas-
sical Clipping (CC) in this paper. In [7], its effects on the
performance of OFDM, including the power spectral density,
the PAPR and BER are evaluated. The function-based clipping
used for CC technique is deﬁned below and depicted in Figure
1 (a).

where A is the clipping threshold.
B. Deep Clipping (DC) technique
Deep Clipping has been proposed in [10] to solve the
peaks regrowth problem due to the out-of-band ﬁltering of the
classical clipping and ﬁltering method. So, in DC technique,
the clipping function is modiﬁed in order to “deeply” clip
the high amplitude peaks. A parameter called clipping depth
factor has been introduced in order to control the depth of the
clipping. The function-based clipping used for DC technique
is deﬁned below and depicted in Figure 1 (b).

,
A < r ≤ 1+β
β A

,
r > 1+β

,
where β is called the clipping depth factor.
C. Smooth Clipping (SC) technique
In [11], a Smooth Clipping technique is used to reduce the
OFDM PAPR. In this paper, the function based-clipping for
SC technique is deﬁned below and depicted in Figure 1 (c).
f (r) =




where b = 27
4 A2.
These three clipping functions are drawn on Figure 1 and have
been completely studied and compared in [8]. We may notice
that the ‘invertible clipping’ of [12] is a variant of SC.
To the best of authors’s knowledge, since 2008 with the
DC [10], no new clipping functions has been proposed in
the literature. Of course, a lot of papers deal with OFDM
clipping but from many others point of view as the threshold
computation of the CC [16] [17] [18] or the mitigation of the
clipping noise [10] [13] [15] ..., but no new clipping function
have been proposed so far as the GC introduced in this paper.

IV. GAUSSIAN CLIPPING
In this Section, we present the Gaussain clipping for PAPR
reduction. We start from the Gaussian function, which is drawn
in Figure 2. It will act on the multicarrier signal amplitude in
order to decrease its PAPR. In this context, only positive values
are taken into account, because the signal modulus is always
a positive value.
The Gaussian Clipping function f (.), associated to this
Gaussian function, is expressed as:
f (r) = Ae−(ηr)2,
r ≥ 0.
(7)
The parameters A and η control the performance of the
method (the transmitted mean power variation and the PAPR
reduction capability).
The GC technique equation (7) can reduce the OFDM PAPR
by increasing low amplitudes samples and by decreasing high
amplitudes samples, as illustrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3 shows that for samples rn such that rn = |xn| ≤
r(threshold), the signal is ampliﬁed whereas for samples rn such
that rn ≥ r(threshold) the signal is attenuated.
The threshold value, r(threshold), which corresponds to the
threshold between ampliﬁcation and reduction of the signal is
obtained by solving equation (8) and is given by equation (9).
f [r] = Ae−(ηr)2 = Ar.

What gives:
r(threshold) =

2η
,
(9)
where W is the Lambert function. The equation ( 9) shows
that r(threshold) depends only on the η parameter of the GC
(see equation (7)). It is therefore clear that r (threshold) and
consequently η, drives the PAPR reduction gain of the GC.
We will now explain the inﬂuence of A in the PAPR
reduction gain. We remind that one of our main objective is
to keep constant the average power between the input and
the output of clipping. Therefore, we would like to have
Py = Px, where Px is the average power of the signal before
and Py is the average power of the signal after the PAPR
mitigation technique. Considering equation (7) P y is given by
equation (10):
Py =
∞
Z
0
f (r)2 p (r)dr = A2
∞
Z
0
e−2(ηr)2p (r)dr.
(10)
Therefore, the ratio γ between the two powers Px and Py is
expressed as follows:
γ = Py
Px
= A2
Px
∞
Z
0
e−2(ηr)2p (r)dr.
(11)
As shown by equation (11), A and η inﬂuence the ratio γ.
This means that it is possible to drive the ratio γ between
the two powers thanks to parameter A without modifying the
PAPR reduction gain, for a given η . In fact we schowed that
the PAPR reduction gain only depends on η parameter.
The A parameter value which give Py = Px is given by
the equation (12)
A(opt) =
√Px
∞
R

e−2(ηr)2p (r)dr

(12)
To summarize, we have shown, theoretically, that η parame-
ter drives the PAPR reduction gain whereas A parameter drives
the average power variation for a given η.
V. THEORETICAL STUDY OF GAUSSIAN CLIPPING
In this Section, we analyse theoretically the behavior of the
GC function. We focus (subsectionV-A) on the average power
variation given by the following equations:
γ = Py
Px
,
(13)
∆E = 10 log10 (γ) . [dB]
(14)
In subsectionV-B, we focus on the PAPR CCDF at the
ouput of the GC function. We are interested in the PAPR
reduction gain ∆PAPR for a CCDF value of 10−2 before and
after clipping.

A. Average power variation analysis
The expression of the transmitted mean power Py as a
function of the OFDM mean power Px can be expressed as:
Py =
+∞
Z
0
[f (r)]2px (r) dr,
(15)
where px (r) is the probability density function (PDF) of
the OFDM envelope and can be assimilated to a Rayleigh
distribution for a large number of OFDM subcarriers:
px (r) = 2r
Px e− r2
Px ,
r ≥ 0.
(16)
By sustituting the expression of px (r) in equation (15), the
expression of the transmitted mean power Py is given by:
Py =
+∞
Z
0
h
Ae−(ηr)2i2 2r
Px
e− r2
Px =
A2
1 + 2η2Px
.
(17)
Let us consider γ the output-to-input mean power ratio;
using equation (17), γ is expressed below
γ
∆= Py
Px
=
A2
(1 + 2η2Px) Px
.
(18)
From equation (18), it is easy to compute the value of
A(opt) (that means the A value which gives Py = Px) and
is expressed as:
A(opt) =
!
1 + 2η2Px

Px
 1
2 .
(19)
Equation (19) shows that A(opt) depends on η (which controls
the PAPR reduction gain) and the average power of input
signal.
The average power variation related to the Gaussian clipping
given by equation (14) is compared with simulation results in
Figure 4. Results show a good match between theory (equation
18) and simulation. For a given η value, the average power is a
linear function of A. Therefore, for a given η parameter value,
it is possible to ﬁnd the value of A(opt) which keeps constant
the average power (our objective). This is given by the value
γ = 0.
B. PAPR distribution analysis
In this subsection, the PAPR CCDF is derived anatyically
for the ouput signal. To perform this analysis, like in [19] for
the classical OFDM PAPR analysis, we assume that the signals
x (t) and y (t) (input and ouput of the Gaussian clipping
respectively) are sampled at the Nyquist rate (that means,
oversampling factor L = 1). Therefore, input and output
samples xn and yn are respectively given by:
xn = x
 n
N Ts

,
yn = y
 n
N Ts

,
(20)
where 0 ≤ n < N, N is the subcarriers number and Ts the
OFDM symbol period. The signals xn and yn may also be
written:
xn = rnejφn,
yn = f [rn] ejφn = vnejφn,
(21)
where rn is the amplitude of xn et φn its phase; vn = f (rn)
is the amplitude of yn.
The PAPR of yn is deﬁned as:
PAPR[y] =
max
0≤n<N |yn|2
Py

0≤n<N vn2

(22)
By applying the same development as in [19], and by
assuming vn independance values we derive:

The PAPR reduction gain is compared to simulations results
and is presented in Figure 5 for several values of η parameter.
It shows that the theoretical approximation of equation (25) is
very close to simulation results.
The PAPR reduction gain decreases when η parameter
increases. This result provides us an upper bound of η. In fact
it should be smaller then 8 to have a positive PAPR reduction
gain, which, of course, is our objective.
VI. COMPARATIVE RESULTS STUDY WITH OTHER CLIPPING
FUNCTIONS
In this subsection, GC performance are compared with clas-
sical clipping [7] (Section III-A), Deep clipping [10] (Section
III-B) and Smooth clipping [11] (Section III-C) performance.
This comparative study is performed in the context of the
WLAN standard IEEE 802.11 a/g, whose parameters are given
in Table I.

power variation ∆E. For the Classical, Deep and Smooth
clipping functions, the PAPR gain decreases with ∆E and
becomes very small for ∆E ≃ 0 dB. At the opposite, this
PAPR gain with the GC is quasi constant in function of ∆E.
In fact, whatever the value of ∆E is, the PAPR gain ∆PAPR of
GC is equal to around 5.2 dB. This result is the great advantage
of the GC, because it offers a PAPR reduction of
5.2 dB
without modifying the average power. To reach this result it
is necessary to set
A
√Px at 0.45 dB as it is shown in Figure 7.
In this ﬁgure, the inﬂuence of the A parameter is presented.
The results show that parameter A could control the average
power variation without modifying the PAPR reduction gain.
This result is very important. In fact, it is possible to choose
A in such a way that Py = Px without modifying the PAPR
reduction gain. In other words, with the GC function it is
possible to reach a PAPR reduction gain of
5 dB with an
average power variation ∆E = 0.
Figure 8 presents the BER for the four clipping techniques.
As expected, these techniques degrade the BER. In fact the
signal resulting from clipping functions is useful for PAPR
reduction but is also the interferer signal which deteriorates
the signal both in band and out of band. Generally out of band

degradation is suppressed by ﬁltering (it is why clipping tech-
niques are generally named clipping and ﬁltering techniques).
As it could be seen GC is the one which degrades the most
the BER. This was expected because the PAPR reduction was
the greatest. That means that GC (as every clipping function)
could not be used without BER improvement. To improve
BER degradation due to clipping noise (whatever the clipping
function is), several techniques could be performed:
• by inverting the clipping function or by iterative subtrac-
tion of the noise regenerated with the clipping function
at the receiver [13]. Iterative methods to substract the
estimated noise have been proposed in [14] and in [15].
The main drawbacks, in our point of view, is that these
techniques become no more backward compatible and
add complexity at the receiver side. Furthermore, the
OOB noise, will degrade the signal in the ajacent band
(the so called shoulders), which is, of course, not accept-
able.
• Another alternative consists in turning the clipping
method into a Tone Reservation (TR) method. By princi-
ple TR does not deteriorated the BER. This technique has
several advantages: i) to be performed at the transmitter
side, ii) to be backward compatible, iii) to be very simple
to realize. It is this technique we have studied in [20] .
VII. CONCLUSION
Gaussian Clipping has been proposed in this paper. We
studied its theoretical performance in terms of PAPR reduction
and average power variation. These performances were also
evaluated trough simulations and compared to other clipping
techniques. The main conclusion is that the proposed GC is
a very interesting clipping method when keeping the average
power constant is a strong requirement.
Of course, as all the other clipping functions, due to
their non linear characters, GC degrades the BER, which
means that this clipping technique should be used in addition
with ﬁltering and/or with TR method.
