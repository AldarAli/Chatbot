Abstract—In recent time, the standards for Vehicular Ad-hoc Net-
works (VANETs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs)
matured and scientiﬁc and industry interest is high especially as
autonomous driving gets a lot of media attention. Autonomous
driving and other assistance systems for cars make heavy use
of VANETs to exchange information.They may provide more
comfort, security and safety for drivers. However, it is of crucial
importance for the user’s trust in these assistance systems that
they could not be inﬂuenced by malicious users. VANETs are
likely attack vectors for such malicious users, hence application-
speciﬁc security requirements must be considered during the
design of applications using VANETs. In literature, many attacks
on vehicular communication have been described but attacks
on speciﬁc vehicular networking applications are often missing.
This paper ﬁlls in this gap by describing standardized vehicular
networking applications, deﬁning and extending previous attacker
models, and using the resulting new models to characterize the
possible attackers interested in the speciﬁc vehicular network-
ing application. The attacker models presented in this paper
hopefully provide great beneﬁt for the scientiﬁc community and
industry as they allow to compare security evaluations of different
works, characterize attackers, their intentions and help to plan
application-speciﬁc security controls for vehicular networking
applications.

INTRODUCTION
Vehicular networking applications are a subset of applica-
tions used in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). They
typically need security controls, especially, when safety is at
stake. For a constructive planning of security controls, it is
of beneﬁt to have a model of a typical attacker, a so-called
attacker model. Typical attack classes are impersonation, data
tampering, sybil attacks, or Denial of Service (DOS) attacks,
please refer to [1] for a survey on these attacks. However,
these attack classes are very general and their severity differs
from application to application. Hence, it is beneﬁcial to have
application-speciﬁc attacker models for vehicular networking
applications. This paper presents vehicular networking appli-
cations speciﬁc attacker models. These attacker models could
be used for security control planning as well as evaluation of
security controls. Also, standardized attacker models as in this
paper are hopefully a great beneﬁt for the scientiﬁc community
to compare evaluations of different papers and modeling real
world attackers.
This paper is structured as follows: Section II presents
related work and shows the gap this paper is closing. Section
III gives an overview on vehicular networking applications.
Section IV presents a classiﬁcation of attackers that is used for
the application-speciﬁc attacker models introduced in Section
V. Section VI concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK
The ﬁeld of attack modeling has a long history with
some of it rooting in reliability engineering and the vault tree
analysis which got adopted and adapted as attack trees [2]–
[4] in the realm of secure systems engineering. Because of its
detailed and explicit nature the attack tree modeling approach
is best suited when goals of an attacker have been elicited
and actual mitigation should be developed. The approach taken
here categorizes attackers based on different aspects that are
derived from their goal, which in return tries to take advantage
of a speciﬁc vehicular networking application. Others use a
game theory based approach to infer intentions, objectives and
strategies of attackers [5], we derive these from the vehicular
networking application that the attacker tries to exploit.
The often cited Dolev-Yao attacker model [6] models the
attacker as an active saboteur. He is omnipotent and can
therefore intercept, eavesdrop, or modify all communication of
the network. Furthermore, the attacker can pose as a legitimate
communication partner and can therefore initiate a communi-
cation with every participant in the network. Compromising or
breaking cryptographic primitives is not possible for a Dolev-
Yao attacker. Networks in an Intelligent Transportation System
(ITS) aren’t limited to the Internet, instead they consist of
Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET), enabling ad-hoc com-
munication. Cellular technologies, like Long Term Evolution
(LTE), can provide connectivity to the Internet. Roadside Units
(RSU) or other stationary participants could be connected via
traditional electrical or optical wired technologies to other
separated networks or the Internet. The Dolev-Yao model is
far too imprecise for such a complex networking structure
and it only depicts a special type of attacker. This attacker
is also unrealistically strong by being omnipotent, which gets
increasingly unlikely the more complex and diverse a network
becomes. This was previously pointed out in regards to sensor
networks [7][8]. Especially, it is pointed out that physical secu-
rity should not be expected because an attacker can easily get
access to those nodes and perform a take over or compromise

cryptographic secrets [7]. In such a way, an outside attacker
becomes an inside participating one. To sum it up, the Dolev-
Yao model is far too imprecise and unrealistically strong to
be of use for security controls planning in realistic vehicular
networking scenarios.
A realistic attack scenario is the exploitation of low level
software or hardware vulnerabilities in the network stacks of
wireless transceivers. The existence and importance of these
vulnerabilities has been discussed in various publications, [9]–
[12]. This scenario marks the lower bound of attack scenarios
that are discussed in this paper. While still being relevant
speciﬁcally to wireless communication, cellular or ad-hoc, it is
also not speciﬁc to only one vehicular networking application
and the root cause of vulnerable soft- and hardware proliferates
through all the layers of current systems and is not speciﬁc
to wireless communications. Therefore, this is not in focus
for this publication. Instead, the main contribution is the
combination and extension of previous attacker models by
[6][7][13] and the detailed description of realistic attacker
models via the extended model. Most of the previous works
[14]–[18], are missing realistic attacker models. Some like
[15]–[17] use categories of attacks, like impersonation, data
tampering, sybil, or DOS attacks and describe each attacker
based on its category. [18] is really close to deﬁning realistic
attacker models by deﬁning categories of attackers, like driver,
road side or infrastructure.
Realistic attacker models are needed to better understand
who might be the attacker of a system, for better comparison
and ultimately needed to make risk based decisions about
whether to implement security controls and how to guard
against a speciﬁc realistic attacker.

VEHICULAR NETWORKING APPLICATIONS
A general classiﬁcation of vehicular networking appli-
cations uses two classes: safety applications and non-safety
applications. For realistic attacker models, a more ﬁne-grain
categorization is needed. The classes used in this paper are
described in the following. Please refer to [1] for a detailed
description of the vehicular networking applications.
A. Cooperative Sensing (Safety)
Cooperative Sensing applications use V2X communication
for situation awareness, e.g., to reduce risks of accidents while
driving.
Road Hazard Signalling (RHS): When a vehicle picks
up a standardized condition [19], an application broadcasts
these conditions to other recipients using a Decentralized
Environmental Notiﬁcation Messages (DENM) [20]. Condi-
tions include emergency vehicle approaching, slow vehicle,
stationary vehicle, emergency electronic brake lights, wrong
way driving, adverse weather condition, hazardous location,
trafﬁc condition, roadwork, and human presence on the road.
Cooperative Collision Avoidance (CCA): When a vehicle
senses a possible collision with an approaching vehicle based
on Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) [21] received
from nearby vehicles, the driver gets a warning. Two distinct
collision warning applications has been speciﬁed: Intersection
Collision Risk Warning (ICRW) (a warning is triggered if a
collision is likely to happen at an intersection) and Longitudi-
nal Collision Risk Warning (LCRW) ( a warning is displayed
to the driver if a front or rear end collision is likely)[22].
B. Cooperative Maneuvering
Applications apply V2X communication for driving au-
tomation functions in the levels 3 to 5 as deﬁned in SAE J3016
[23].
Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC): To op-
timize resource usage by forming a convoy or platooning and
reducing speed alteration via an extended horizon where minor
changes can be leveled out.
Cooperative Merging Assistance (CMA): To avoid col-
lisions vehicles and roadside units (RSU) cooperate and nego-
tiate merging maneuvers.
Cooperative Automated Overtake (CAO): For takeover
maneuvers either in a fully autonomous self-driving or a driver
assistance scenario, cooperation among vehicles to improve
safety is needed.
C. In-Vehicle Internet Access
Internet-based applications are offered to passengers and
in distraction reduced versions even to the driver.
D. Mobility Monitoring and Conﬁguration
The status of a vehicle can be remotely queried and
modiﬁed. This application includes control of auxiliary heating
systems as well as software and ﬁrmware updates. Usually, the
accessed vehicle is in a parked position during the interactions
of this application.
IV.
ATTACKER MODEL
There are already different characteristics for attackers
known in literature, some described in the following para-
graphs and extended if needed.
Insider Attacker vs. Outsider Attacker [7][13]: An
outsider attacker is restricted because he does not participate in
regular communication. An insider attacker on the other hand
is a regular participant in the communication. A participant
could become an insider attacker e.g., when hacked or infected
with malware.
Active Attacker vs. Passive Attacker [7][13]: A passive
attacker only eavesdrops on communication. An active attacker
on the other hand acts in the network, e.g., by creating and
inserting messages, by replaying messages, or by modifying
existing messages.
Static Attacker vs. Dynamic Attacker [7]: An attacker
adapting his behavior based on the behavior of network en-
vironment or attack target is called a dynamic attacker. Static
attackers on the other hand do not adapt to changes whatsoever.
An example of a static attack is the most basic form of malware
which doesn’t utilize a command and control infrastructure and
is build only for a speciﬁc purpose, like sending spam. An
example of a dynamic attack is an attacker of an Advanced
Persistent Threat campaign, which adapts to security measures
or changes his goal based on the detected environment around
it.
Cooperative Attacker [7] vs. Individual Attacker: At-
tackers colluding to reach a common goal (e.g., destabilization
of the network) are called cooperative attackers. An attacker
limited to its own abilities is called an individual attacker.
Local Attacker vs. Extended Attacker [13] extension:
Global Attacker [7]: How much inﬂuence an attacker has is
an important criteria for the scope and impact a given attack
can develop. Limited by his physical abilities, a local attacker
can only inﬂuence participants in his ad-hoc communication

vicinity. An attacker controlling multiple network segments
has the ability to execute more sophisticated attacks that need
a greater area of inﬂuence. This so-called global attacker has
the ability to access every message of the network. But based
on the diversity and complexity of ITS network architecture,
this type of attacker is limited to the infrastructure providers
or to attackers that can inﬂuence or execute control over this
communication infrastructure.
Malicious Attacker vs. Rational Attacker [7][13] exten-
sion: Opportunistic Attacker: An indiscriminate attacker who
does not care about losses, resource usage, or consequences
and targets functionality of participants or the network is called
malicious attacker. A rational attacker tries to reach a certain
goal by the cheapest means possible and is focused on his
beneﬁt or proﬁt. An attacker who only executes an attack when
an opportune circumstance occurs is called an opportunistic
attacker.
Table I shows the proﬁle matrix based on the attacker
characteristics described above that is used in the rest of this
paper to describe application-speciﬁc attackers.

Based on this proﬁle matrix, speciﬁc attackers can be
modeled. The worst possible attacker is shown in Table II.
The worst possible attacker is the most powerful attacker one
can think of. As described in Section II for the Dolev-Yao
model, such a powerful attacker is quite unlikely to appear in
most realistic scenarios (however, there is one valid scenario
listed below).

The worst attacker and weakest attacker are both ends of
the application speciﬁc attacker model presented in this paper.
However, in most vehicular networking applications a realistic
attacker model lies between the worst attacker and the weakest
attacker. The following section presents the realistic attacker
models applicable for each vehicular networking application
presented in Section III.
V.
APPLICATION SPECIFIC ATTACKER MODELS
For each vehicular networking application (see Section
III.), different speciﬁc attacker proﬁles are described in this
section.
A. Cooperative Sensing (Safety)
Attackers interfering with safety functions are always in-
advertently or intentionally risking to cause damage to them-
selves or other humans besides causing ﬁnancial damage. It is
important to keep this in mind especially when judging about
the motivation of a certain attacker.
A perpetrator is stuck in trafﬁc, he then decides to push
a button that forces his vehicle to send out false road hazard
warnings to inﬂuence other vehicles. In an ideal situation for
the attacker, the victim vehicles fall for his false claims. He
might pose as an emergency vehicle, send out false wrong way
driving warnings, roadwork, or human presence on the road
to clear a lane, to speed past other vehicles. He is an active
dynamic insider acting as an individual, with local reach, see
table IV. As stated previously, ﬁddling with safety functions is
borderline malicious activity. The speeding attacker might still
try to be rational about the reliance of the successful deceiving
of other trafﬁc participants as they might simply ignore his
false claims or he might overlook real hazards.

Another group taking advantage of this safety application
may be a single or group of environmentalists or annoyed
residents. Their goal might be to reduce the speed of vehicles,
no matter what the rest of the community decided on to be
acceptable. There are two basic technical approaches these
attacker can pursue either they try to jam valid RSUs (Denial
of Service), see Table V, or they try to compromise or mimic
a valid RSU, see TableVI.

When being able to communicate to other vehicles other
attacks are possible, like trying to get the vehicles to alter their
route, because of hazard warnings like weather conditions or

fake trafﬁc conditions. But a single RSU or a fake one has
only a limited area of inﬂuence.
A small step up for the attacker who is compromising
RSUs, see Table VI, to slow vehicles down, would be if he
does not stop after controlling one RSU. He would try to get
control over a larger area to have a bigger inﬂuence on victim
vehicles, see Table VII. By doing so he poses a greater risk to
safety in that area by exercising his power over an area and
colluding RSUs, to make the false or modiﬁed warnings look
authentic.

To prevent duplicate information, the following attack
model omits the table, because the attacker resembles the
worst case attacker as pictured in Table II. The attacker could
be a foreign power either state sponsored or independent but
the goal of this group would be to put on a stranglehold on
safety related functions to unleash massive chaos by using
infrastructure to ﬂood victims with false hazard, collision
warning and creating non existent vulnerable road users in
front of vehicle, to get the safety systems to collapse and
shutdown. During such an attack the goal of the attacker
would be to create human casualties or at least create huge
ﬁnancial losses and impediment. The whole purpose of such
a malicious attack is to weaken the position of an opponent
and to strengthen their own, this could be also achieved by
holding the infrastructure ransom and threatening to vandalize
the infrastructure. To have such a large scale effect the attacker
needs to compromise the infrastructure by ether common
vulnerabilities or by compromising the provider of it.
The last three attacker types in this section dedicated are
derived from the weakest attacker, see Table III. The goal of
these attackers is to acquire knowledge about nearby vehicles.
This goal is similar to the snooping individual who uses
the manufacturer build in monitoring as described in Table
XIII. The difference between these three type of attackers is
their scope, whether they have only local, extended or global
reception. A local inﬂuence might be easy to establish, only
one receiver is needed. For extended visibility, more receivers
are required, but for global reach the RSU to attacker receiver
ratio must be one-to-one. This would be easy to achieve for an
worst case attacker as he does not only want to have control
over some infrastructure but wants to have control over all
available ones.
B. Cooperative Sensing (Information/Non-Safety)
In comparison to the safety relevant applications mentioned
before, informational cooperative sensing application do not
have an immediate life threatening aspect. The application for
exchanging dynamic mapping information is particularly inter-
esting as it might be used to improve the driver’s experience,
but could be misused to annoy the driver or even to literally
navigate him into dangerous situations. One attacker who is
trying to annoy drivers or shop owners sets up a fake RSU to
send out false information about points of interest. This might
reach from false opening hours to false location information.
This can be considered as trolling, wasting someone’s time
and resources and annoying people to no end, as presented
in Table VIII. He is rather static, a individual opportunistic
attacker with only a local scope.

The second type of attacker are criminals, see Table IX,
that use technology to make their activities easier. In case of
mapping information, they could try to trick the driver via the
navigation system to take another route, to send the driver to an
abundant place to either rob or kidnap him. It may be enough
to setup some fake RSUs or compromise a few, software wise
or physically, to mislead or manipulate the victims systems.
A single criminal or a group of them may feed dynamic false
information into the systems near their victim and may even
deploy multiple RSUs to have a higher chance of misleading
the driver. When considering criminals as attackers, the dif-
ferentiation whether their motivation is malicious or rational
depends on where the perpetrators want to reuse their scheme,
like a business, or if they are outright hitmen. But whether the
latter one would invest in the technology and know-how to ease
his job of executing a paid for assassination is questionable.
Nonetheless intentional criminal activity would be considered
malicious.

C. Cooperative Maneuvering
When considering cooperative maneuvering, one distin-
guishes if a non-cooperative fallback is available or not. If
a non-cooperative fallback is available, the attacker might be
just like the trolling one mentioned in Table VIII as no real
7

SECURWARE 2016 : The Tenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

harm is possible because a safe downgrade to non cooperative
assistance is available. If no fallback is available, there is a
safety issue. CACC should have a non cooperative companion
ACC. For the cooperative automated overtake application
especially in an autonomous driving environment, the safety
implications are obvious. An attacker sending false awareness
information is only different from the worst case attacker (see
Table II) in regards to his reach as he is locally limited and to
the organizational aspect as he is an individual, see Table X.

D. In-Vehicle Internet Access
A malware author who uses the Internet connectivity as
an initial attack vector to infect software components in a
vehicle is summarized in Table XI. This type of an active
attack depends heavily on the design of the vehicular internet
access capabilities. If the vehicle itself does not have Internet
enabled or capable components and merely provides an access
point for other smart devices to get access, than the attack
surface is reduced. Still, an outside attacker could try to
attack the access point software or more generally common
software components among vehicles of the same manufacturer
or across the industry, that is reachable via the Internet. The
ability of an attacker to adapt his malware or the ability of it
getting new orders via an command and control infrastructure
makes him an dynamic opponent. As an individual attacker
who uses the Internet as the initial access vector to his victims,
his capabilities are also limited by the ability to directly
connect to a victim or whether the victim has to make the
initial connection. In this case, he would resort to common
scenarios like water hole, or phishing attacks, where the victim
connects to an Internet resource who serves an exploit kit
targeted at software vulnerabilities. Nevertheless the attackers
scope is limited in the sense of the initial attack vector to a
local one, further more he is going to act in a rational way, as
he wants to make a proﬁt of off his work.

E. Mobility Monitoring and Conﬁguration
There are cases where an owner or an agent of the
owner (modder, tuner) could be seen as an attacker from the
perspective of a vehicle manufacturer. In this case, the owner
or his agent tries to manipulate the vehicle, e.g., to decrease the
mileage count of a car. It is obvious that the owner or his agent
can access all available communication, hence he is an insider
attacker. He also has the ability to modify the hardware of
software and react to security controls in place. For example,
extraction of cryptographic keys from ﬁrmware images is
a well-known approach in the car hacking and chip tuning
community. Hence, the attacker is an adaptive attacker. Attacks
usually affect only one vehicle. A special case is an attack on
an online service portal of the manufacturer. If all vehicles of
this manufacturer can be modiﬁed remotely, the attack could
have an extended scope, but the initial vulnerability is still
local to the service portal. The owner of a vehicle is a rational
attacker as he is resource sensitive. If the use of a vehicle hack
has less value than the money needed to execute the hack, the
owner likely will not execute the attack. See Table XII for a
summary.

Another attacker is a control freak attacker. His goal is
snooping on his or her spouse, child, or anybody else using
the vehicle. As the owner of the vehicle, the active insider
individual attacker can use the location tracking or monitoring
ability for the legitimate purpose (e.g., ﬁnding his vehicle or
creating an automatic driver’s logbook) but also use it to spy on
persons he lends the vehicle to. He does not need to change
his behavior as tracking devices are already build into most
vehicles. He is very opportunistic as he uses the abilities of the
existing monitoring system. Only his own vehicle is affected.
The properties of the control freak attacker are summarized in
Table XIII.

An extension of the control freak attacker is an attacker
attacking a centralized location information system of a man-
ufacturer. If such a centralized system (e.g., a service portal)
exists and the user can query it for the position of his
vehicle (e.g., to ﬁnd a parked car), it could be an attractive
target. The attacker is an outside attacker but he must be
highly motivated, persistent, and dynamic. When attacking
the system, the possession or control of multiple vehicles
might be advantageous but the attacker is still considered to
be individual and locally limited to the attacked system, that
stores the location information. The attacker is not interested
to create outages or service interruption as he is interested in
the functioning system and especially in the data it gathers,

therefor he can be considered being rational. See Table XIV
for a summary of this attacker.

The last two attacker models are still ﬁt into the V2X
communication and application paradigm, although they are
centered around the existence of systems run by the manufac-
turer and misusing or exploiting weaknesses in them, which
are reachable via the Internet.

Maneuvering, In-Vehicle Internet Access, and Mobility Moni-
toring and Conﬁguration. Novel attacker models are presented
that focus on realistic application-speciﬁc attacks instead of

Our contribution describes 15 realistic attacker proﬁles in
its main Section V, an summary is given in table XV. These
attacker models allow for a more focused planning of security
controls for vehicular networks, as well as a better compara-
bility of security evaluations using these attacker models.
Using this attacker modeling approach for evaluation and
providing in-depth examples on how to beneﬁt from it in
particular vehicular communication applications is reserved for
future work.
