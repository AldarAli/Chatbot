Abstract—The energy efﬁciency (EE) maximization on the uplink
of multi-carrier direct sequence code division multiple access
(MC-DS/CDMA) cooperative wireless networks is an NP-hard
optimization problem of great interest for future networks sys-
tems. This paper presents three centralized solutions and two
distributed ones: the centralized solutions include an iterative
solution based on the Dinkelbach method and two heuristic
approaches, i.e., the Fireﬂy algorithm (FA) and the Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The distributed solutions
are based on a game theory framework and employ two differ-
ent algorithms for resource allocation: the classical waterﬁlling
algorithm adapted to the discussed problem and the Verhulst
distributed power control algorithm (V-DPCA). Simulations were
conducted in order to establish which technique has the best EE,
spectral efﬁciency (SE) and complexity tradeoff.

INTRODUCTION
Energy-efﬁcient telecommunications systems is of great
importance in terms of design and implementation due to
carbon emission reduction and cost. Besides, in wireless
communications the transmission power usually is not linearly
proportional to the transmitter-receiver distance, which makes
cooperative networks often more energy-efﬁcient than non-
cooperative networks. In such networks each mobile terminal
(MT) communicates with one or multiple relay stations (RS)
that forward the MT message to its respective base station
(BS). Besides the increase in EE, this sort of networks may also
be used to increase spectral efﬁciency (SE), system throughput
or decrease the average transmission power.
MC-DS/CDMA networks are characterized by the division
of the total available spectrum into uncorrelated CDMA non-
selective sub-channels. This characteristic improves granularity
which usually enhances system throughput, capacity, SE and
EE as well as lower the average transmission power (ATP).
Each one of the sub-channels is interference limited, thus bet-
ter interference cancellation techniques may be implemented
in order to further improve the system. In addition, MC-
DS/CDMA networks may carry out adaptive modulation or
multiprocessing gain techniques to support different multime-
dia services increasing the system ﬂexibility from voice service
to high data rate services.
1) Related Work: Many studies have been conducted re-
cently aiming to ﬁnd implementable resource allocation (RA)
algorithms for cooperative networks, among them [1]–[6]. RA
procedures are directly related to user satisfaction, company
proﬁts and environment issues. The work in [1] presents
a game theoretic approach for power control and receiver
design in cooperative direct sequence (DS)/CDMA networks.
A performance analysis for wireless cooperative networks
using amplify and forward (AF) protocol is presented in
[2] while a method for energy efﬁciency maximization with
minimum transmission rate requeriments is presented in [3].
Meanwhile, in [4] a concave fractional programming approach
for EE maximization in orthogonal frequency division multiple
access (OFDMA) cooperative networks is presented while in
[5] an analysis on EE-SE tradeoff for DS/CDMA networks is
offered. Furthermore, in [6] three different distributed solution
methods for the EE maximization problem in MC-DS/CDMA
cooperative networks are discussed.
2) Contributions: The main contribution in this work is to
analyse different algorithms, methods and approaches that can
be deployed in resource allocation of the uplink (UL) cooper-
ative MC-DS/CDMA networks. In order to ﬁnd a good solu-
tion/algorithm for power allocation and EE in MC-DS/CDMA
cooperative networks, which compromises both performance
and computational complexity, this paper extends the work
presented in [6] and incorporates two centralized heuristic al-
gorithms to solve the RA problem. All ﬁve algorithms/methods
are brieﬂy presented and analyzed under the same scenario
which consists of a single cell with one ﬁxed relay station,
directional antennas and cooperative communications aiming
to expand the coverage area without expensive costs for the
telecommunications company.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the
system model and description; EE and SE, as well as the
problem formulation are presented in Section III. Furthermore,
Section IV discusses centralized solutions while Section V
presents the game theoretic approach. Numerical examples and
results are offered in Section VI. Conclusions and future work
are addressed in Section VII.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
On the UL of MC-DS/CDMA cooperative systems each
MT communicates with the BS using a RS to forward its mes-
sage. In this paper we consider a single cell environment with
one ﬁxed RS (FRS) as shown in Fig. 1. The complex channel
gain for the MT-FRS link is described as hi(k) where i and k
are the MT and subcarrier indexer, respectively. Equivalently,
the complex channel gain for the FRS-BS channel is denoted
as g(k). Therefore the power channel gain vector for the MT-
FRS path is:
h(k) = [h1(k) h2(k) · · · hU(k)]⊤
k = 1, . . . N
(1)
where U is the system loading and N the number of parallel
non-overlaping subcarriers. The power channel gain vector for
the FRS-BS path is:
g = [g(1) g(2) · · · g(k) · · · g(N)]

In cooperative scenarios, the signal received at the relay
may go through different procedures before it is forwarded to
the next destination. The relay may use amplify-and-forward
(AF) protocol, decode-and-forward (DF) protocol or compress-
and-forward (CF) protocol. We only consider the AF protocol.
Hence, the signal received at the FRS is ﬁrst normalized by
the square root of the average received power and afterwards
ampliﬁed by the U ×U ampliﬁcation matrix A constrained by
tr(AAH) ≤ pR where pR is the available power at the FRS.
In interference limited multiple access networks an impor-
tant QoS measure is the signal-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) since all users transmit over the same channel at the
same time causing multiple access interference (MAI). In a
MC-DS/CDMA system, the post-detection SINR, considering
the adoption of linear receivers, may be generically expressed
for the ith user, kth sub-carrier as [7]:
δi(k) = Fi(k)
pi(k)hi(k)g(k)|dH
i Asi(k)|2
Ii(k) + NT(k) + σ2g(k)||AHdi||2
(3)
where hi(k) = |hi(k)|2 is the channel power gain between
user i and the single FRS and g(k) = |g(k)|2 is the channel
power gain from single FRS to BS, and di is the linear ﬁlter
at receiver, such as single-user matched ﬁlter (MF) or multi-
user Decorrelator, minimum mean square error (MMSE) ﬁlter
and so forth; following the results of [5] only the Decorrelator
will be considered herein since it had the best results in terms
of complexity-performance trade off. Hence, the Decorrelator
ﬁlter may be mathematically expressed as:
dDEC = [d1, . . . , di, . . . , dU] = S(ST S)−1 = SR−1
(4)
where di is the linear ﬁlter for the i-th user, S is the spread-
ing sequence matrix with each column representing an user
spreading code and R is the spreading sequence correlation
matrix. Furthermore, the Ii(k) in (3) is the ampliﬁed MAI at
the FRS forwarded to the BS:
Ii(k)

where pi(k) is the allocated power, associated to the respective

ENERGY AND SPECTRAL EFFICIENCIES AND
PROBLEM FORMULATION
The SE of each user through the N sub-channels can be
computed as the number of bits per second that may be trans-
mitted for a single Hertz. Considering a practical approach for
the theoretical bound obtained through the Shannon channel
capacity equation, the SE of the ith user can be deﬁned as:
Si =

log2 (1 + δi(k)) , i = 1, . . . , U

Finally, the user rate at each sub-channel is given by:
ri(k) = w · Si = w log2 (1 + δi(k))

In MC-DS/CDMA systems with a single FRS, the EE

∀i = 1, . . . , U, where i and k are the user and sub-channel
indexers respectively; ℓ ≤ 1 is the code rate. pi(k) is the MT
transmission power, pR is the re-transmission power from the
FRS to the BS, assumed a ﬁxed and equal power quantity
per user overall the subcarriers; pC and pCR are the circuitry
power consumption at MT and FRS, respectively; ̺ > 1 and
̺R > 1 are the power ampliﬁer inefﬁciency factors at MT and
FRS, respectively. The efﬁciency function f(δi(k)) expresses
the probability of error-free packet reception. Considering M-
QAM square constellation modulations of order M = Mi(k)
and Gray coding, the bit error rate is approximately [9], [10]:

CENTRALIZED RA SOLUTIONS
Analytical-iterative Dinkelbach method, as well as a heuris-
tic PSO-based and Fireﬂy-based algorithms are explored to
solve the RA problem in a centralized way.
A. Dinkelbach Method
The Dinkelbach method is an iterative method to solve
quasi-concave problems in a parameterized concave form [11].
The optimization problem in (11) is divided into N sub-
problems representing the EE problem in each subcarrier k:
maximize
C(p)
U(p) =

i=1
ℓi(k) w log2 [1 + δi(k)] · (1 − BERi(k))

s.t.(C.1)
δi(k) ≥ δi,min(k),
∀ i
(13)
(C.2)
0 ≥ pi(k) ≥ pmax,
∀ i
Each subproblem (13) is a quasi-concave problem [6]. The
following parametric concave program is associated with the
EE maximization problem in each subcarrier [12]:
maximize
p∈X
C(p) − λ U(p)
(14)
where X = {p ∈ X|0 ≤ pi(k) ≤ pmax ∀i = 1, . . . , U}.
The objective function of the parameterized problem, denoted
by F(λ) is a convex, continuous and strictly decreasing
function. Without loss of generality, the maximum EE λ∗ of
the parameterized problem is [12]:
λ∗ = C(p∗)
U(p∗) = maximize
p∈X
C(p)
U(p)
(15)
which is equivalent to ﬁnd F(λ) = 0. According to [13] the
Dinkelbach method is the application of Newton’s method to
a nonlinear fractional program converging with a super-linear
rate. The goal at each iteration of the method is to solve:
F(λn) = max
p∈X {C(p − λn U(p)}
@nth iteration.
(16)
Fig. 2 depicts a pseudo-code for Algorithm 1 based on iterative
Dinkelbach’s method. Moreover, in order to solve problem (16)
we have deployed CvX tools [14].
B. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Created by Kennedy and Eberhart in [15] the PSO algo-
rithm is based on ﬂocks behaviour when searching for food.
In this algorithm each possible solution is analogously put as a
particle in the swarm and each member of the population has
two main attributes: position and velocity. Position itself is the
candidate solution to the optimization problem and velocity is
the parameter used to move each individual according to the
best solution found by him and by the whole group.

λ0 satisfying F(λ0) ≥ 0;

n ← n + 1
until |F(λn)| ≤ ǫd;
Output: λn; p∗

Figure 2. Pseudo-Code for the Dinkelbach’s Method
In order to deal with unfeasible solutions the implemented
algorithm discards any individual which leaves the problem do-
main or does not satisfy at least one of the problem constraints
as in (11). Hence, at each iteration the M individuals move
through the search space, being eliminated from the population
if they leave the problem domain. At the t-th iteration the PSO
updates particle m position through:
Xm[t + 1] = Xm[t] + Vm[t + 1]
(17)
where Xm[t] is the particle m position at iteration t and it
is a U × N non-negative valued real matrix. Vi[t + 1] is the
velocity U × N matrix which can be computed by:
Vm[t + 1]
=
ωVm[t] + c1 U1
m[t] ◦

To become a useful tool, three basic rules about the
individual ﬁreﬂies are assumed: a) ﬁreﬂies have no gender
deﬁnition, hence any ﬁreﬂy can attract any other ﬁreﬂy; b)
attractiveness is proportional to the bioluminescence intensity
such that less intense ﬂash patterns ﬁreﬂies are moved on the
direction of more intense glints; c) if a particular individual has
the most intense ﬂash pattern then it moves randomly in the
search universe. Instead of being an intrinsic characteristic to a
ﬁreﬂy, the attractiveness is, in fact, a correspondence between
ﬁreﬂy i and j which is mathematically deﬁned as [16]:
βij = β0 e−γ d2
ij
(19)
where j attracts i with intensity β0 and an exponential decay
with the distance between them. The parameter β0 is the base
attractiveness at null distance, common for all individuals of
the population, and γ is the medium permissiveness or light
absorption coefﬁcient; dij is the Euclidean distance between
the ﬁreﬂies. Hence, at each iteration t, each pair i, j – where
ﬁreﬂy j has a larger light intensity than i – performs a move
such that i moves in the direction of j according to [16]:
Xi[t+1] = Xi[t]+β0 e−γ d2
ij (Xj[t] − Xi[t])+αf

B. Solving One Non-Coalitional Game (M-DPCA)
As a second approach, the problem is simpliﬁed by taking
the average channel gain over all N subcarriers. Thus, all
variables which had a subcarrier indexer k are now identiﬁed
by the operator ¯·, indicating that the variable takes the average
value over N subcarriers. Hence, the problem (11) can be re-
written as:

(C.2)
¯δi ≥ ¯δi,min,

Problem (30) does not have the sub-carrier dimension, thus
it is easier to solve when compared to the ﬁrst approach.
To ﬁnd the best power allocation policy to (30) the same
game theoretic approach presented in Section V-A is adopted.
Therefore, one may solve this approach through our proposed
Algorithm 2 depicted in Fig. 3 in combination with the V-
DPCA. This approach will be referred hereafter as M-DPCA.
VI.
NUMERICAL RESULTS
Simulations where conducted using MatLab 7.0 Mathworks
to establish which are the best parameters for both heuristics.
The scenario parameters values used in the simulations are
presented in Table I. Before comparing the different methods’
performance it is necessary to ﬁnd the best parameters for
both heuristics. Results from 1000 trials with at least 5
different values for each parameters shown that, for FA the best
reference light intensity is β0 = 1, the best light absorption
coefﬁcient is γ = 1 and the best random step coefﬁcient is
αf = 10−3. While for the PSO, the local best and global best
coefﬁcients are c1 = c2 = 2.
The effect of population size for both PSO and FA was
analyzed in Fig. 4. The population size and the maximum
number of iterations impact was analysed in terms of the
average EE obtained for both PSO and FA; also, such heuristic
distributed solutions was compared to the centralized solution
based on Dinkelbach method (Max EE). As shown, increasing
the maximum number of iterations as well as population size
leads to better EE results with the only counter effect being
the increase on complexity. Furthermore, FA has a signiﬁcant
advantage in terms of achieve EE when compared to the
PSO under small population sizes (5 to 10). This gap among
each algorithms’ solution is reduced when the population
size increases and is almost equivalent when it reaches 50
individuals.

three different QoS requirement classes. Basically, each class
represents one type of multimedia service; thus, users may

To effectively compare the performance of each method
one must consider the computational complexity of each
method. Some assumptions must be done: a) all algorithms
are assumed to execute the same amount of iterations, hence
the algorithm with the simplest iteration yield the simplest
algorithm of all; b) computational complexity of Dinkelbach’s
method solution obtained via CvX tool is not considered in
the analysis since its complexity cannot be securely obtained;
c) number of users in the system is considered U < N and
therefore has no impact on the complexity asymptotically.
At each iteration of the V-DPCA algorithm a ﬁxed number
of operations are conducted which leads, in asymptotic terms,
to a O(1) complexity. Hence, the M-DPCA approach has a
static complexity while the V-DPCA is executed one time at
each subcarrier which leads to linear complexity O(N). It is
also easy to show that at each iteration of the PSO algorithm
operations are computed for each of the individuals of the
population which represents an asymptotic linear dependence
of the population size, i.e., O(M). Finally, the complexity of
the FA is directly related to the fact that it must compare every
possible pair of ﬁreﬂies which gives an asymptotic complexity
of O(M 2) where M is the population size. Furthermore, the
performance comparison in terms of how close to the optimal
solution (on average) each algorithm ﬁnds itself is sumarized
in Table II. Such results represent the average over a thousand
channel realizations and MTs geographical distribution.

CONCLUSION
Five different approaches solving the energy-efﬁcient de-
sign in MC-DS/CDMA cooperative networks with FRS were
analyzed. Also, the algorithms’ complexity issues were brieﬂy
addressed. Our ﬁndings indicate that the best average EE-
complexity tradeoff is achieved by the M-DPCA. The M-
DPCA algorithm takes into account the average observed
interference while performing the power control of the non-
cooperative game in a distributed fashion, which is of
paramount importance in uplink scenarios. Indeed, such algo-
rithm presented the lowest iteration complexity and achieved
similar or better performance results regarding the average
EE than centralized solutions, such as the heuristic ones. An-
other advantage is that it simpliﬁes the interference estimator
procedure at the BS side while a low overhead information
exchanging between MT and BS is held.
Future works include the problem of the joint resource
block and power allocation in the uplink of multi-user multi-
cell large scale multiple-input-multiple-output (or massive
MIMO) under pilot contamination regime. Since the opti-
mization problem is of mixed-integer nature, we are propos-
ing different quasi-optimal resource allocation algorithms to
achieve the better tradeoffs regarding average system spectral
efﬁciency and energy efﬁciency, all of them supported by a
game theoretic framework.
