Abstract - There are many standards and types of laboratory 
equipment for examination of specific properties of diesel fuels. 
The basic standards of diesel fuel stability require examination 
taking a relatively long time, counted in days. The development 
of new methods of diesel fuel stability testing has as its aim 
accelerated ageing of the examined samples. The most popular 
of accelerated ageing factors are the increase of temperature 
and oxidation. In this paper a new method with diesel fuel 
sample positioned in a capillary and ultraviolet radiation used 
as degradation factor is proposed. Two possible optical sensor 
configurations are described as well as the data analysis 
method for classification of premium and standard commercial 
diesel samples. The comparison of two sensor configurations 
was made with the same fuel samples which included winter 
and summer premium diesel fuel as well as eco winter diesel 
fuel, unmodified and modified with sludge protection additive. 
The results of sensor analysis during fuel examination prove 
that 40 minutes of UV degradation and sequential fluorescence 
reading at 10 selected moments of time coupled with data 
processing is enough to evaluate diesel fuel chemical stability 
and quality. In the experiments light of 265nm and 365nm 
wavelengths was used correspondingly for degradation and 
fluorescence reading. We found that chemical stability of fuels 
was related to the amplitude variations of characteristic 
emitted fluorescence signals. The concentration of polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons in fuels was related to the amplitude of 
signals emitted from excited samples. The UV examination 
indicated that fuel’s chemical stability was better observable 
with forced degradation and excitation at 265nm, while fuel’s 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons presence was better 
observable with excitation at 365nm.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This paper’s focus is on selected aspects of a sensor 
using a capillary optrode and UV radiation as the 
fluorescence excitation factor and fuel degradation initiator 
that enables rapid testing of chemical diesel and biodiesel 
fuels stability. The principle and preliminary results of this 
work were presented in [1].  
A. Diesel and biodiesel fuel –as seen  from the user’s and 
producer’s sides 
On the diesel fuel user’s side low cost and high quality of 
the fuel are important. Diesel fuel quality is analyzed with 
reference to diesel engine operating characteristics, such as 
starting ease, low noise, low wear, long life, sufficient 
power, low temperature operability, and low emissions [2].  
On the fuel producer’s side, the quality of diesel fuel is 
determined by quality standards. These quality standards 
differ for diesel and biodiesel fuels. The most popular 
standards of diesel fuels are ASTM D 975 introduced by the 
American Society for Testing and Materials and EN 590 
introduced by the European Committee for Standardization. 
Respectively, the standards for biodiesel fuels are the ASTM 
D 6751 in the USA and the EN 14214 in Europe. In this 
approach, the quality of fuel can be described as a set of 
laboratory measured fuel parameters, like for example: the

cetane number, pour point, viscosity, density, acid number, 
the result of accelerated oxidation stability test, and result of 
test for gum content in fuels by jet evaporation, as well as 
sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen contents of fuel composition.  
The common feature of fuel user’s and producer’s sets of 
fuel quality parameters is that they depends on diesel fuel 
composition, which changes in storage due to presence of 
some chemical active fuel components [3]. 
B. Type and composition of diesel and biodiesel fuels 
The diesel and biodiesel fuel consists of the fuel base, the 
fuel improvers and impurities. The type of diesel fuel may be 
described by the fuel base origin or the technological 
process.  
Petroleum diesel (petrodiesel) is the fuel produced in a 
refinery as a blend of straight-run product, fluid catalytic 
cracking light cycle oil, and hydrocracked oil. The straight-
run product may be acceptable as diesel fuel. Synthetic diesel 
(syndiesel) can be produced from any carbonaceous material. 
The raw material is gasified and after purification is 
converted in the Fischer–Tropsch process. The synthetic 
diesel generally is the first class fuel base. Fatty-acid methyl 
ester (FAME), obtained from vegetable oil or animal fats 
which have been transesterified with methanol is a common 
biodiesel fuel base composition. FAME has lower oxidation 
stability than petrodiesel, and it offers favorable conditions 
for bacterial growth. Hydrogenated oils (HVO) may be 
produced from the triglycerides from vegetable oil and 
animal fats. The HVO is a composition of alkanes obtained 
in the refining and hydrogenation process. Therefore, HVO 
composition is similar to synthetic diesel like fuel. 
Modern petroleum-derived diesel fuel base is composed 
of about 74% saturated hydrocarbons - primarily alkanes, 
25% aromatic and acyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons. The 
typical chemical formula for diesel fuel base molecule 
composition is C12H23, but the number of carbons in the 
molecule ranges approximately from C10 to C22. Now, it is 
worth noting here, that at 25°C alkanes ranging from C5 to 
C17 are liquids, while alkanes ranging above C17 are in 
solid state. Therefore, it is expected that in the diesel fuel 
some solid state hydrocarbons particles are present and form 
some kind of colloid. 
The most common saturated hydrocarbon of diesel fuel is 
dodecane described with the formula H3C(CH2)10CH3. 
Alkanes have the general chemical formula CnH2n+2. Alkanes 
are only weakly reactive with ionic substances, but all 
alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction [4].  
Saturated cyclic liquid hydrocarbons are not alkanes, but 
they are often called cycloalkanes as are characterized with 
similar chemical properties as akanes.  
Unsaturated acyclic hydrocarbons fuel content consist 
primary of alkenes, but alkynes, alkadienes and alkatrienes 
may be found in diesel fuel.  
Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other 
functional groups are described by the general formula 
CnH2n. It can be seen that for the same number of carbon 
atoms acyclic alkenes have two hydrogen atoms less than the 
corresponding alkane. Acyclic alkyne is an unsaturated 
hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon-carbon triple 
bond. The general chemical formula of basic alkyne is 
CnH2n−2. 
Alkadienes are acyclic hydrocarbons having two carbon–
carbon double bonds, while alkatrienes are hydrocarbons 
having three carbon-carbon double bonds. A simple 
alkadiene is butadiene, which is a gas with the structure 
H2C=CH−CH=CH2. This molecule is important in the 
chemical industry as is used in production of synthetic 
rubber. A popular acyclic hydrocarbon containing three 
carbon-carbon double bonds; is 2,4,6-octatriene, which has 
the structure H3C-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3 and a 
standard name isooctane. It is a liquid and an important 
component of gasoline used in relatively large proportions to 
increase the knock resistance of the fuel.  
Unsaturated 
aromatic 
(cyclic) 
hydrocarbons 
are 
represented by monocyclic benzene (MAH – monocyclic 
aromatic 
hydrocarbon) 
and 
by 
polycyclic 
aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs). Benzene is a natural liquid constituent 
of crude oil and is one of the elementary petrochemicals. The 
simplest PAH having two aromatic rings is naphthalene 
(white crystalline solid). The three-ring PAHs compounds 
are anthracene (colorless solid) and phenanthrene (white 
powder).  
PAHs molecules can be found in coal and in tar as well 
as in crude oil. Therefore, almost every petroleum product 
contains various PAHs particles [5]. Diesel fuel is expected 
to contain PAHs particles ranging from three to five ring 
systems.  
Fuels fabricated for diesel engine may contain bio-
component that may reach a few percent of fuel volume. The 
bio-components’ 
presence 
is 
significant 
from 
fuel 
technology, affiliation (bio-diesel) and fuel parameters points 
of view [6]. Important is that bio-components may be of first 
or second generation [7]. The first generation of bio-diesel 
components includes fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) that 
are characterized by the presence of double bonds, while the 
second generation components base on hydro-treated 
vegetable oils (HVO) that seem to be mainly carbohydrates 
with saturated carbon atoms bonding [8].  
The modern diesel fuels include also a range of additives, 
as for example cetane improvers, antioxidants, detergents, 
corrosion inhibitors, deposit modifiers, lubricity agents, and 
biocides [9]. 
The most popular cetane improver is 2-ethyl hexyl nitrate 
(2-EHN); the minor significant improver is di-tertiary-butyl 
peroxide (DTBP). DTBP is a peroxide and its chemical 
formula is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3. 2-EHN is nitroalkane, which 
linear formula is CH3(CH2)3CH(C2H5)CH2ONO2. Both 
substances include oxygen and are reactive.  
It was found that hydrocarbons mixture with C10–C18 
particle is the optimum range for microbial metabolism [10]. 
Therefore, in stored diesel fuel some microorganisms are 
presented. The microorganisms adhere to the tank walls or 
settle in the fuel-water interface at the bottom of the tank. 
Possible routes of entry of microorganisms into the fuel can 
be from the ground by cracks of buried tanks and from the 
air, during loading operations. Furthermore, organic biocides 
with different functional active groups and hydrogen 
peroxide are in use as additives to diesel fuel [11].

C. Diesel fuel degradation during storage process 
Hydrocarbons of diesel fuel may degrade as a result of 
oxygen presence and reaction initiator. Known reaction 
initiators are light, temperature and catalyst. 
The photochemical reactions caused by light are mainly 
able to affect the physical properties of some of the oil 
fractions. They are able to alter the emulsion formation and 
the solubility of the fuel fractions. This is done by inducing 
reaction between oil components and other molecules, which 
makes the molecules more polar and water soluble, so 
creating new compounds with other physical properties [12]. 
It seems that there major mechanism involved in photo 
degradation of oil can be classified as direct or indirect 
photolysis [13]. Direct photolysis takes place when the 
molecule of interest absorbs energy from light and further 
degrades. Indirect photolysis occurs when another molecule 
absorbs the energy from light and reacts to degrade the 
molecule of interest. The UV radiation also can suppress a 
number of microorganisms in diesel fuel [14]. 
The thermal stability of diesel fuels was examined at 
different temperatures: higher than 150°C and below 150°C 
[15]. 
Saturated hydrocarbons common degradation is a result 
of oxidation. The products of oxidation include aldehydes, 
ketones, acids and alcohols which can further transform into 
multi-particle substances that form resins and sediments [16].  
The unsaturated hydrocarbons degradation in standard 
vessel condition may occur as the oxidation and 
polymerization process. Certain alkenes undergo self-
addition reactions in the presence of specific catalysts or 
energy supply to produce molecules called polymers. The 
reaction involves double bonds being converted to single 
bonds as hundreds of molecules bond and form long chains. 
It is not possible to give an exact formula for a polymer 
produced by a polymerization reaction because the 
individual polymer molecules vary in size [17]. Polymers 
made from alkenes result in a very long-chain alkane. As a 
result, it has the chemical inertness of alkanes and form solid 
sediment in fuel. 
Chemical oxidation of PAHs occurs readily, for example, 
anthracene 
(C14H10) 
oxidation 
gives 
anthraquinone, 
(C14H8O2). PAHs react also with singlet oxygen - a high-
energy form of oxygen. PAHs react with acetone in photo 
degradation. For example, naphthalene with 1% acetone 
mixture 
during 
UV 
irradiation 
results 
in 
1,2-
Benzenedicarboxaldehyde generation. The examination at 
254, 310 and 365 nm, wavelength shows that the influence 
of wavelengths on photodegradation rates of PAHs was 
significant [18]. The irradiation at 365nm found to be 
effective in oxidation of PAHs. For example, naphthalene 
C10H8 intermediates produced during UV irradiation in 
oxygen presence are:  
C8H6O2  ̵ 1,2-Benzenedicarboxaldehyde,  
C9H6O2  ̵ 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one,  
C10H6O2  ̵ 1,4-Naphthalenedione,  
C10H8O  ̵  1-Naphthalenol,  
C10H6O3  ̵  2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione, [19].  
Cetane improvers decompose rapidly and form free 
radicals when exposed to temperatures above 100°C. These 
radicals increase the rate of main fuel components 
decomposition; therefore, the ignition delay is negatively 
affected [20]. 
DTBP molecule during decomposition supplies both the 
oxidizer and the fuel particles. Thus, it can be used as a fuel 
in engines where oxygen is limited [21]. 
2-EHN in liquid phase can decompose in the absence of 
air as, for example, when pressure and temperature in storage 
tank increase above 75°C [22]. But, in another report [23], 
authors suggest that at temperatures below 100°C the 
decomposition of 2-EHN in diesel fuel is extremely slow, as 
at 120°C the half-life is 522.7 h. Moreover, in the mentioned 
paper, the 2-EHN at the 146.3°C and 2400 bar half-life is 
88.5 h, while half-life at 1 bar is 16 h. The initial step of 2-
EHN particle decomposition is the separation of NO2 and the 
rather unstable 2-ethylhexyloxy radical (2-EHO). Thus, we 
conclude that 2-EHN behavior in diesel fuel environment 
may depend on fuel composition. Moreover, such conclusion 
is supported by proposed method of 2-EHN concentration 
examination in diesel fuel with UV fluorescence examination 
reported in [24]. 
The antioxidant additive of diesel fuel principal function 
is to inhibit the formation of peroxides. Therefore, as can be 
seen, antioxidants should react with some cetane improvers 
as for example DTBP. 
D. Sensing methods for diesel fuel quality 
There are many methods to measure diesel fuel quality. 
The standardization process of measurement of diesel fuel 
parameters is still in progress [25]. Nowadays, the basic idea 
of fuel characterization is a selective and specific 
measurement of sequent parameters.  
Petro-chemic industry representative recognized a series 
of fuel parameters measured in laboratory conditions, as for 
example a cetane number (CN), acid-number, flashpoint, 
lubricity and oxidation stability. Measurements of the mostly 
recognized fuel quality parameter called ignition quality of 
fuel (CN) have to be carried out in the Cooperative Fuel 
Research Engine (CFR-5) or the Ignition Quality Tester 
(IQT™). On the other hand, many fuel parameters depend on 
fuel composition described by distillation results. The 
distillation parameters may to be measured using the classic 
distillation unit, or may be measured with automated 
distillation process analyzer [26]. Oxidation stability of fuel 
standard measurement with rancimat method refers to oils 
chemical reaction with gas environment [27]. It should be 
noted that chemical stability of fuel means thermodynamic 
stability of a chemical system and refers to chemical internal 
reaction between fuel components, [28] [29]. Therefore, 
chemical stability of fuel is not the same as oxidation 
stability. But, some definitions of the chemical stability 
refers to the tendency of a material to resist change or 
decomposition in its natural environment when exposed to 
air, heat, light, pressure, or other natural conditions. 
Contrariwise, fuel users expect parameters set that 
describe diesel fuel operability and that can be measured in 
situ. Unfortunately, such set of parameters is not full

standardized, but include engine start characteristic, time of 
fuel life (stability), fuel transfer dynamics from tank to 
injection unit and fuel contamination. 
A set of method for fuel contamination with different 
chemicals as for example non-transferred vegetable oils, 
kerosene, PAHs are under development. The examination of 
bio-components concentration can be made with the use of 
excitation-emission matrix method for wavelength range of 
250-500nm with spectral subtraction fluorescence for range 
of 300-600nm. This method is precise, but requires 
expensive equipment [30]. Therefore, mentioned method has 
been adopted to use with the one light emitted diode as 
excitation source [31]. But, an investigation result refers only 
to samples of diesel fuel intentionally contaminated with 
known concentration of bio-component or kerosene. It is 
worth noted that time-resolved fluorescence method can be 
used for classification of the unknown fuels groups as 
gasoline, diesel, bio-ester and vegetable oil [32]. The 
fluorescence time delay method and a high pass method are 
used for the detection of PAHs. In the high pass method, the 
high pass optical filter was used to remove the scattering of 
the exciting pulse, as the exciting energy may be too high 
and destroy detector. For example, naphthalene detection 
was performed with excitation at wavelength of 266 nm, 
with 6 ns pulse of 5 mJ, which was repeated at 10 Hz rate 
[33]. 
A set of method oriented to examination of oxidation 
stability of diesel fuels are also under investigations. For 
example, the method of antioxidant presence in fuel samples 
with absorption measurement performed at 256 nm has been 
proposed [34].  
Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy was suggested as 
a tool to evaluate the photo and thermal degradation results 
of crude oils [35]. The degradation was performed with 
sunlight of 350 W/m2 that lasts for 100 hours. Oils irradiated 
showed decreased fluorescence intensity at all wavelengths 
from 350 to 700nm, when examined in intervals of at least 2 
hours. 
New methods of diesel fuel fitness-for-use determination 
that are addressed to implementation in sensors are under 
development. These methods include measurement of 
characteristic points of local sample heating of fuel 
positioned in a capillary [36], measurement of the dynamical 
rise of fuel in an inclined capillary [37], reading of 
fluorescence effects in the range of UV-VIS and reading of 
UV-forced degradation results of closed sample of diesel fuel 
[38]. Dedicated components of mentioned sensors, as 
capillary optrodes [39], micro-heaters [40], optoelectronic 
photodetectors [41] and photodetectors pre-amplifiers [42], 
have been developed. Also, some aspects of automatization 
of sensor with capillary set-ups as data filtering and 
processing [43] as well as influence of man operator are 
under investigation [44]. Moreover, progress in explored 
methods of diesel fuel examination is coupled with 
development of new photonics elements as fluorescent core 
micro-capillaries [45], improvements in construction of 
electronic components as electronic modules [46] [47] and 
improvement in microelectronic manufacturing technology 
[48]. 
E. Photo degradation and photo detection possibilities of 
potentially unstable diesel fuel components  
The photo degradation and photo detection of potentially 
unstable fuels components is possible with radiation that 
wavelength range is absorbed by fuel in particular by 
unstable particles. 
The maximum absorption of alkenes shifts from deep UV 
toward longer wavelengths with the increase of the number 
of carbon-carbon double bonds, for example, H2C=CH2 the 
maximum absorption is at 180nm, for H2C=CH−CH=CH2 
the maximum absorption is at 217nm, while B-carotene with 
11 double carbon-carbon bonds is characterized by the 
maximum absorption at 455nm [49]. Absorption of UV in oil 
samples at 230–235 nm allows detection of alkadienes, while 
absorption at 260, 270 and 280 nm allows detection of 
alkatrienes [50]. For example, detection of isooctane may be 
performed as absorbance measuring at 232 nm and 264-
272 nm.  
Similar dependency of maximum absorption shift can be 
observed in aromatic unsaturated hydrocarbons. For 
example, benzene maximum absorption is at 255nm, 
naphthalene is at 286nm while anthracene is at 363nm. 
Absorption peaks are also influenced by functional groups 
while benzene maximum absorption is at 255nm, phenol is at 
270nm, and nitrophenol is at 320nm.  
PAHs generally absorb light in the 200-400 nm range and 
strongly fluoresce in 360-430nm range. For example, peak 
wavelength of excited fluorescence for benzo[a] anthracene 
is 
387nm, 
for 
benzo[a]pyrene 
is 
405nm, 
for 
benzo[k]fluoranthene is 403nm, for chrysene is 382nm and 
for phenanthrene is 366nm [51]. It is interesting that the 
emission spectra of benzo[a]anthracene is characteristic and 
can be described as hills with two similar peaks with one a 
little dominant height at 387nm and 410nm and with 
wavelength symmetric saddle. The naphthalene also has a 
similar shape with hills peak at 325nm and 335nm. The 
photo degradation of naphthalene with the addition of 
nitrogenous air pollutants NO2 was described [52]. The 
results indicate that naphthalene degradation occurs when 
irradiated with UV light > 290 nm. Reaction products were 
2-formyl-cinnamaldehyde, 
1,4-naphthoquinone, 
nitronaphthol, 
o-phthaldialdehyde, 
phthalide 
and 
nitronaphthalene. Nitronaphtalene is characterized by unique 
solvent-dependent fluorescence [53]. 
Up today, PAHs photo degradation as pyrene and 
benzo[a]pyrene using ultraviolet sources working at 
wavelengths of 254, 310 and 365 nm was investigated. The 
results of UV irradiation intensity on the degradation 
performance of PAHs show that with the intensity of UV 
irradiation being increased, the degradation rates of PAHs 
were higher. Additionally, degradation rates of pyrene were 
different at different UV irradiation wavelengths [54]. Also, 
PAHs degradation in real outdoor condition showed a good 
linear correlation with mean solar radiation intensity [55]. 
But, it was indicated that photo degradation rates of 
anthracene, phenanthrene and naphthalene in water surfaces 
are different. Athracene half-life was 1 hour, phenanthrene

was 20.4 hours while half-life of naphthalene exceeded 100 
hours [56]. 
F. Intermediate conclusions – selection of UV sources to 
degradation of unstable fuel components 
The diesel fuel is a multicomponent mixture that may be 
degraded with oxygen, temperature or light irradiation. 
Classical methods of fuel analysis of oxidation stability 
require trained chemist, costly equipment and prolonged 
time of examination or are not precise. On the other hand, 
fluorescence is a sensitive indicator of photochemical 
transformations of fuel components [57]. Therefore, 
examination of chemical stability of diesel fuels may be 
performed with forced UV degradation and fluorescence 
reading of signal emitted from unsaturated hydrocarbons.  
It should be noted that light absorption in popular PAHs 
as naphthalene {288 nm}, phenanthrene {252 nm; 275 nm; 
294 nm} and anthracene {252 nm; 356 nm} can be 
addressed with 260 UVTOP LED that emits radiation from 
255 nm to 270 nm when calculated for 20% of peak intensity 
located at 265 nm. This is due fact that aromatic components 
light absorption characteristics are not narrow peaks of 
mentioned wavelengths but extends into quite wide bands. 
For example, naphthalene absorption calculated at half 
intensity extends from 250nm to 289nm [58]. 
On the other, hand solar radiation falling to the ground 
does not include UVC range, but include UVA. The example 
of intensity of spectral distribution of sun irradiation for 
sunny day of 09 of May 2018 in Warsaw is presented in 
Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Distribution of intensity of sun irradiation in sunny day of 09 of 
may 2018 in Warsaw registered at 4pm. 
This data may lead to conclusion that radiation of 365nm 
wavelength is well represented in natural environment. 
Besides, for such radiation high powers LEDs are available, 
as for example M365F1. 
Therefore, the rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II describes the sensor construction development 
including sensor head with optrode as well as optoelectronics 
system set-up. Section III addresses the results of the 
analysis fluorescent signal that is recorded during photo 
degradation at selected wavelength. Section IV goes into 
conclusions. 
II. 
SENSOR CONFIGURATION 
Proposed capillary sensor with UV-forced degradation 
and fluorescence reading of chemical stability of diesel fuels 
can be configured with one, two or three UV sources. The 
UV forced degradation and fluorescence excitation in sensor 
with one UV source is performed at the same wavelength. 
The degradation and fluorescence excitation wavelengths 
can be different in sensor with two or three UV sources. The 
sensor configuration with a couple UV sources gives 
possibility to spread wavelengths for degradation and for 
fluorescence excitation, but the number of combination of 
measurement configuration increase rapidly with sources 
number. Therefore, in this paper the configurations of 
sensors with forced degradation and fluorescence excitation 
at the same wavelength are examined. The selected 
wavelengths for sensor examination are 265nm and 365nm. 
As a UV sources the light emitting diodes are in use 
correspondingly UVTOP265 LED and M365F1 LED. The 
examined UV degradation is realized by UV irradiation of 
sample fuel positioned in capillary for 40 minutes. During 
this degradation, fluorescence signals are read at 0.5, 1, 5, 
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 minutes. 
 
A. Sensor set-up with one UV source working at 265 nm 
The sensor head of the set-up with one UV source 
working at 265 nm is presented in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Scheme of the capillary sensor head with one UV source. 
The head is coupled to the optoelectronic sensor set-up 
for UVTOP265 LED according to the scheme presented in 
Figure 3. The set-up is optically powered by a LED 
controlled with the hardware D2100 driver that is triggered 
from a PC with the use of software. The fiber optic divider 
1:7 is used to produce a reference signal and to monitor light 
source parameters with PM100D optical power meter 
equipped with S120VC photodiode. The head output is 
connected to Maya 2000pro spectrometer, which is 
connected to PC and controlled by Ocean Optics software 
that enables sequential writing of data recorded.

Data recorded from spectrometer and power meter are 
processed 
in 
each 
examination 
for 
elimination 
of 
spectrometer dark signal, light source emitted power drift 
reduction and for de-noising of signal.  
B. Sensor set-up with two UV sources working at 365nm 
The sensor set up for head working at 365 nm requires 
relatively narrow band for fluorescence excitation source as 
the wavelength of excitation signal is close to emitted band 
of some PAHs. For example, M365F1 LED bandwidth 
(FWHM) is 7.5nm and the residual long wavelength 
radiation may interfere with excited fluorescence signals. 
Therefore, M365F1 LED using as fluorescence excitation 
requires optical filtering, which may reduce optical power 
required for degradation. Thus, dividing optical channel to 
excitation and degradation leads to the sensor configuration 
proposed in Figure 4. The head is coupled to the 
optoelectronic sensor set-up with M365F1 LEDs according 
to the scheme presented in Figure 5. The sensor set-up for 
fluorescence excitation and reading with M365F1 LED, 
contrary to UVTOP265 LED, includes a monochromator 
adopted as precise optical filter. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Scheme of the capillary sensor head with two UV sources. 
 
Figure 5.  Scheme of the capillary sensor set-up with two UV LEDs. 
The utilized monochromator DMC1-02 enables reducing 
bandwidth to 2nm and fully rejects the long wavelength 
residual radiation. But this tuning of the M3651F1 LED’s 
optical signal to the accuracy required by florescence 
excitation and reading of diesel fuels introduces 1:135 of 
signal attenuation. 
The UV degradation LED working point is set with 
current stabilization. Therefore, UV power shift can be 
present and can affect the obtained results. In presented 
examination, the degradation power was in range from 
1293µW up to 1300µW, while the excitation power was in 
the 8.98µW to 9.34µW range. While fuel oxidation 
parameters values as induction time, calculated in percent, 
varies for different fuel type much more than any possible 
variation of the mentioned LED power. 
 
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF FUEL EXAMINATIONS 
The six types of diesel fuel (DF) were under examination 
including three base clear fuels of premium summer type 
stored for 4 months in dark container in room conditions 
(PSC), fresh premium winter fuel (PWC) and fresh eco 
winter fuel (EWC). These fuels catalog data point similar 
oxidation stability, but eco fuels are expected to contain 
more PAHs than premium ones. Therefore, for examination 
purposes, fuels were modified with additional improver 
intended to be antioxidant and waxes solvent. This way 
auxiliary fuels names can be written as: premium summer 
with additional improver (PSA), premium winter with 
additional improver (PWA) and eco winter with additional 
improver (EWA). Mentioned acronyms are used in tables 
that gather experimental data.  
The examination was performed for fuel in ambient 
temperature equal to 22°C±1°C. In such conditions and used 
measuring procedure include data processing obtained result 
of examination accuracy is better than 280 [a.u.] while single 
measurement accuracy is 50 [a.u.] for full scale range equal 
64000 [a.u.].

fuels is presented in Figures 6-11.

The shapes of the characteristics are similar. The 
characteristic points may be proposed as two peaks P1 at 
380nm and P2 at 399nm as well as band signal B480 emitted 
round 480 nm. For analysis purpose, the characteristics

points P1, P2 and B480 for different fuel types are gathered 
in Figures 12-14. 
 
 
Figure 12.  P1 emission at 380nm, excited at 265nm. 
 
Figure 13.  P2 emission at 399nm, excited at 265nm. 
The first step of data analysis at Figure 12 should be 
performed for fuel couples: clear fuel and corresponding fuel 
with additional improver. In such case the influence of the 
improver is visible as characteristics shift down with the 
improver’s presence. This shift is not constant, but 
characteristics pairs are recognizable. The second step of 
analysis should be performed for fuel types -clear and with 
additional improver. The clear fuel types characteristics 
analysis lead to the conclusion that eco fuel generates greater 
signal at 380nm than premium fuels. But for fuels with 
improver this statement is not always true.

The characteristic data points of fuel under with 265nm 
radiation degradation, counting from the first minute, 
maximum signal, signal alternation and time to signal 
saturation at selected wavelength of P1, P2 and B480, are 
gathered in Table I. The greater is the maximum signal the 
fuel is expected to contain greater volume of fluorescence 
particles as PAHs, and therefore be of lower quality. For 
example, clear eco fuel is described by greater values than 
the eco fuel with improver, clear premium fuels are 
characterized by greater values than premium fuels with 
improver.

The signals alternation during degradation can be used 
for description of fuel stability. Signals changes for all 
parameters: P1, P2 and B480 indicate that eco fuel changes 
are greater than for the premium ones. But for premium fuels 
the signal change dependency on improver addition is not 
clear. Despite, the expected relation of lower stability of eco 
fuel compared to premium is confirmed. 
Times to saturation value of P1 increase or stay constant 
when the improver is added to fuel. Similar dependency has 
been obtained for values of P2 and B480.  
B. Diesel fuels examination with two UV sources working 
at 365nm 
Second set of examination was performed in the set-up 
from Figure 5. The family of characteristics for the set of 
fuels is presented in Figures 15-20.  
 
Figure 15.  Signal emitted from clear premium summer diesel fuel degraded 
and excited at 365nm. 
The first comparison of characteristics from Figure 15 
and Figure 6 shows that peaks are at different wavelength. 
Therefore the new peaks are numbered as P3 and P4. 
Moreover, the characteristic changes in B480 bandwidth 
presented for degradation with 265 nm wavelength now is 
not observable. Now, the bandwidth of visible changes is 
from 525nm to 625nm with the greatest variations at about 
575nm (B575). 
 
Figure 16.  Signal emitted from premium summer diesel fuel with 
additional improver, degraded and excited at 365nm.

and excited at 365nm. 
 
 
Figure 18.  Signal emitted from premium winter diesel fuel with additional 
improver degraded and excited at 365nm. 
 
Now, the experimental data analysis leads to the 
conclusion that peak radiation P3 and P4 wavelengths are 
characterized by minor, but measurable shifts. 
 
 
Figure 19.  Signal emitted from clear eco winter diesel fuel degraded and 
excited at 365nm.

Figure 20.  Signal emitted from eco winter diesel fuel with additional 
improver degraded and excited at 365nm. 
The characteristics measured for degradation of eco 
winter fuel, see Figure 19 and Figure 20, present the new 
peak (P5) creation as well as P3 and P4 peaks decay.  
Besides, the measuring P3 and P4 peaks wavelength 
shifts seems to be difficult in a sensor device implementation 
as it requires a spectrometer or a dedicated set of optical 
filters. But, observation of data gathered in Figures 15-20, 
leads to the conclusion that amplitude shifts of all mentioned 
peaks are going in the same direction. Therefore, the 
wavelength band information (B405) in the range of 380nm 
to 430nm should illustrate the tendency of signal changes, as 
presented in Figure 21. In such approximation, the difference 
between premium and eco type diesel fuel is clear and is the 
horizontal line at the 30000 [a.u.] of emitted signal.  
 
 
Figure 21.  B405 emission in 380nm to 430nm range, excited at 365nm. 
The B480 emission for 365 nm excitation seems to be 
stable, as presented in Figure 22. The most visible changes of 
signals are for initial period for eco fuel degradation. 
 
Figure 22.  B480 emission excited at 365nm. 
Emission at 575 nm, presented in Figure 23, looks 
different from the characteristic presented in Figure 22. Now, 
the most stable signals are for eco fuel. But, in both cases the 
time for saturation may be used as a local fuel stability 
pointer. 
 
 
Figure 23.  B575 emission excited at 365nm. 
The characteristic data points of fuel under with 365 nm 
radiation degradation, counting from the first minute, are: 
maximum signal, signal alternation and time to signal 
saturation at selected wavelength of B405, B480 and B575. 
They are gathered in Table II.  
The most visible aspects here is that the time to 
saturation that is defined as to the moment when the signal 
stops to increase, cannot be specified here for some cases. As 
for example the maximum signal during degradation at 
405 nm bandwidth increases only for eco fuel. The 
maximum signal fuels decreased in 405 nm bandwidth with 
the use of additional stability improver.

As previously (see Table I), the peak signals of eco fuels 
in B405 bandwidth are greater than for premium fuels. The 
signals changes suggest an opposite classification of 
chemical stability than expected, because lover values are 
observed for eco fuels than premium with except of B480 
signal alternation. But, signal alternation is relatively small, 
calculated in percent versus B405 maximum signal. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The experiments confirm that fuel fluorescence is a 
sensitive indicator of photochemical transformations. The 
UV radiation can be used for fuel sample degradation and 
fluorescence excitation. The sample irradiation at 265 nm 
and 365 nm results in different emitted signals changes. The 
265 nm irradiation results in amplitude shift of two peaks at 
380 nm and 399 nm, and also results in signal development 
at 480 nm. The sample irradiation at 365 nm results 
sometimes in the transformation of two peaks to one peak 
centered at 405 nm. The 405 nm characteristic signal emitted 
during this examination may be direct related with the 
generation of benzo[a]pyrene. 
Comparing the results gathered in Table I and Table II, 
we can see that signals variations of P1 and P2 peak 
registered for degradation with 265 nm wavelength are 
greater than signal variations of B405 observed for 
degradation with 365 nm. Therefore, chemical stability of 
fuel is easier to observation for photo degradation with the 
use of 265 nm wavelength than with the use of 365 nm. The 
results of data analysis during fuel irradiation at 265 nm 
enable to claim, that 40 minutes of UV degradation and 
sequential fluorescence reading at 10 selected moments of 
time coupled with data processing is enough to determine the 
chemical stability of the diesel fuel.  
Moreover, the ratio of B405 signals of eco fuels versus 
premium fuels is about 2:1 for excitation with 365 nm 
wavelength and is semi-stable during degradation. Therefore, 
B405 signals can be used to pointing PAHs concentration. In 
this case, the examination does not have to last more than 15 
minutes.
