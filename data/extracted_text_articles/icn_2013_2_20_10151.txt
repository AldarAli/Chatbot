Abstract—Dynamic spectrum access is a key technique in 
cognitive radio. Whenever primary users appear, secondary 
users must evacuate the primary channel rapidly, and switch the 
appropriate channel to primary users. There are two types of 
channel access methods, namely reactive and proactive channel 
access. In reactive method, cognitive radio does not need to 
switch channel until primary users appear, while in proactive 
method, secondary users predict future channel traffic by using 
channel history and switch channel before primary users appear. 
Most of the previous researches assume that all primary users 
possess the same channel bandwidth. In this paper, we take 
various channel bandwidths into consideration to make spectrum 
handoff decision with the method proposed before under real 
cognitive radio environment, and use this method to analyze the 
performance. Channel utilization rate in both methods is 
enhanced while considering various bandwidths. 
 
Keywords- reactive channel access; proactive channel access; 
Bandwidth.

 INTRODUCTION 
Spectrum is a precious and limited natural resource, and 
most portions of it have been authorized. With the development 
of network techniques, the demand for spectrum is increasing. 
“The biggest problem of spectrum application is not scarcity 
but ineffective,” according to [1]. Not only do we have to solve 
the ineffective problem, but we also need to make good use of 
the spectrum. With "spectrum sensing capability”, cognitive 
radio technology has been proposed [2], hoping that through 
time and space configuration, full use of those unused spectrum 
resources can effectively solve the problem of the spectrum 
congestion or the unequal distribution. 
The first step of developing cognitive radio is dynamic 
spectrum access [3]. Cognitive radio users must monitor the 
idle spectrum periodically, analyze the surrounding wireless 
messages at the same time to adapt themselves to the 
environment, and use these messages to learn and adjust the 
transmission state and parameters in radio. As soon as the 
primary users appear, cognitive radio users can seamlessly 
switch to other idle channels, making transmission continue in 
spite of the appearance of the primary users. 
Liu, et al. [4] discusses the concept of spectrum mobility, 
and develops the probability models of spectrum holes and 
spectrum handoff according to the characteristics when 
primary users appear. The probability of handoff is an 
important indicator to affect spectrum mobility, and it is also an 
important part of spectrum management. 
There are two types of channel access methods, namely 
proactive channel access and reactive channel access. It is still 
unclear under what condition we shall use which of these 
handoff methods. Wang, et al. [5] introduces these two 
methods, and uses a PRP M/G/1 model to derive the formula to 
analyze which of the two spectrum handoff methods can 
achieve the best efficiency with the variation of spectrum 
sensing time. 
Without interference to primary users, secondary users are 
allowed to temporarily use the channel for transmission. 
Aravinda, et al. [6] uses proactive channel access method 
without interference under TV broadcast condition. Secondary 
users can use the information of channel history to build a 
prediction model, and use it to make the spectrum handoff 
decision. Not only can it enhance the channel utilization, but it 
can also reduce the interfering time produced by primary users.  
Höyhtyä, et al. [7] proposes a simple method to classify the 
channels to either periodic or stochastic patterns, which may in 
turn help the secondary users to schedule the channel. Yang, et 
al. [8] sets the period when primary users appear as an 
alternative exponential ON/OFF model, and predicts future 
primary channel state according to previous primary users’ 
traffic. Secondary users can try not to interfere with the 
primary users by quickly switching to another unused primary 
channel to continue its transmission. Xue, et al. [9] emphasizes 
the importance of handoff delay in real life so that the 
secondary users can take it into consideration to make the 
spectrum handoff decision. 
Most of the previous researches assume that all primary 
users possess the same channel bandwidth. In reality, however, 
cognitive radio needs to adapt to the heterogeneous network 
architecture in which not all primary users possess the same 
channel bandwidths. According to IEEE 802.22 standard [10], 
cognitive radio is applied for 54 ~ 862 MHz UHF/VHF TV 
bands and must adapt to 6MHz, 7MHz, and 8MHz TV bands. 
This will lead us to make different spectrum handoff decision. 
Hence, we take various channel bandwidths into consideration 
to make spectrum handoff decision with the method proposed 
before under real cognitive radio environment, and use this 
method to analyze the performance. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:  In Section II, 
we introduce the system model. In Section III, we discuss the 
strategy of handoff decision. In Section IV, we show our 
simulation results. In Section V, we provide our conclusion.

SYSTEM MODEL 
A. System prediction model 
At the beginning of channel prediction model shown in Fig. 
1, secondary users will perform spectrum sensing, and then 
save the sensing information into channel history database. 
Primary users channel’s traffic information can be obtained 
from the historical database. Cognitive radio can use spectrum 
sensing results and channel history to predict channels idle time 
in the next slot. If it needs spectrum handoff, the channels idle 
time in the next slot subtracts channel switch cost and spectrum 
sensing time to get the channels remaining time. The packet 
capacity can be derived from the product of channels 
remaining time and the channel bandwidth. Finally, in the 
handoff decision section, cognitive radio will look for the 
channel that has the maximum packet capacity to be the 
handoff channel, and use it to transmit data.

B. Channel model 
We use the common alternative exponential ON-OFF 
model to be our channel model as shown in Fig. 2. The 
difference with previous research is that our bandwidth is 
variable. At first, all primary channels will be random in ON 
or OFF state. When the channel is in the “ON” state, which 
means that the channel is “BUSY”, the secondary users cannot 
access the channel; when the channel is in the “OFF” state, 
which means that the channel is “IDLE”, the secondary users 
can access the channel for transmission. The durations that the 
primary user passage shows ON (BUSY) and OFF (IDLE) are 
independently exponentially distributed. For channel n, the 
period of ON, 𝐵𝑛, follows an exponential distribution with 
mean 1/λ𝐵𝑛. On the other hand, the period of OFF, 𝐼𝑛, also 
follows an exponential distribution with mean 1/λ𝐼𝑛.

             f(𝐵𝑛)=ቊ λ𝐵𝑛e−𝐵𝑛λ𝐵𝑛, 𝐵𝑛 ≥ 0
0                    , 𝐵𝑛 < 0                             (1) 
In our simulation environment, we assume that cognitive 
radio is operated in a slotted model, and has N primary 
channels for access as shown in Fig. 3. At the period of 
spectrum sensing, cognitive radio will use the spectrum sensing 
result and the information from channel history database to 
predict the probability of channel idle time in next slot.

THE STRATEGY OF HANDOFF DECISION 
A. Reactive v.s. Proactive channel access 
Spectrum handoff occurs when the primary user appears in 
the licensed channel that is temporarily used by the secondary 
users. The main significance of the spectrum handoff is to help 
the secondary users switch to the suitable idle channels to 
resume transmissions. The types of spectrum handoff are 
divided into two types: 
Reactive channel access: Whenever a primary user occurs, 
secondary users have to handoff by following steps: first, after 
detecting any primary user, secondary users interrupt 
transmission and do spectrum sensing. Second, according to 
the real-time spectrum sensing, find idle channels and switch to 
the idle channel to resume transmissions. Not only does it have 
to spend real time spectrum sensing, some real time 
applications (for example, watching movies online) will also 
cause great harm. This is shown in Fig. 4.

history to predict future channel traffic, and schedule the

channel access intelligently. They may use the predicable 
method with the result of spectrum sensing to predict future 
channel traffic before primary users appear in order to avoid 
disruption by primary users, and to maintain reliable 
communication. The advantage of using proactive channel 
access is the reduction of communication disruption by primary 
user, for secondary users can switch to other channels before 
primary users appear and resume transmission faster. This is 
shown in Fig. 5. 
 
Figure 5.  The proactive channel access model 
B. Channel prediction 
We assume that the primary channels are a series of 
ON/OFF model; when the channel is in ON state, the channel 
is being used; when the channel is in OFF state, the channel is 
IDLE and secondary users can access this channel. The 
frequency of primary users' appearance can be built in an 
alternative exponent ON/OFF model. The average channel 
IDLE time can be set as E[TIDLE
n
]=1 λ𝐼𝑛
ൗ
, and the average 
channel IDLE time can be set as E[TON
n ]=1 λ𝐵𝑛
ൗ
. We can use 
the built model to predict future channel traffic. We assume 
that the idle probability of channel N in next slot is Pn which 
can be derived based on renewal theory [11]: 
          
𝑃𝑛 = ൞
λ𝐵𝑛
λ𝐵𝑛+λ𝐼𝑛 +
λ𝐼𝑛
λ𝐵𝑛+λ𝐼𝑛 e−(λ𝐵𝑛+λ𝐼𝑛)∆t    , s = 0

λ𝐵𝑛+λ𝐼𝑛 −
λ𝐵𝑛
λ𝐵𝑛+λ𝐼𝑛 e−(λ𝐵𝑛+λ𝐼𝑛)∆t   , s = 1
                (2) 
We can use the following formula to predict the channel 
idle time in next slot: 
              TIDLE
n
= 𝑃𝑛 λ𝐼𝑛
ൗ
                   (3) 
C. Intelligence channel switching 
When we make the spectrum switch channel decision, we 
consider [9] which mentioned switching cost to achieve more 
realistic simulation. In real life, spectrum switch decision 
making 
must 
consider 
more 
situations 
such 
as 
packet-loss-ratio, synchronization and delay. It must produce 
non-negligible handoff delay. The handoff delay needs to be 
taken into consideration, and it must affect the handoff 
decision as follows: 
          CH = arg max [ (TIDLE − ΓTswitch)]         (4) 
Γ = ൜ 1   , if CH(Prev) ≅ CH(Current)
 0   , else                                             
D. Bandwidth consideration 
When we make a switch decision in the process of 
proactive channel access, we take the channel bandwidth into 
consideration to achieve the best QoS. 
           PACKETn = Tremain 
n
* BWn              (5) 
         Tremain
n
 = TIDLE
n
- α ( Tswitch – Tsense )       (6) 
α = ൜ 1   , if CH(Prev) ≅ CH(Current)
 0   , else                                             
            CH=arg maxn( PACKETn)              (7) 
PACKETn means the packet capacity of the channel which 
performs transmission once and is equal to the product of 
channel remaining idle time and channel bandwidth.  Tremain 
n
 
means the channel remaining idle time, and BWn means 
channel bandwidth. If it needs to do channel switch, channel 
idle time has to subtract switch cost and spectrum sensing to 
calculate the channel remaining idle time. Finally, we will find 
the channel which has the maximum packet capacity to be our 
spectrum switch channel. The flowchart of this proactive 
channel access model is shown in Fig. 6. 
 
Figure 6.  The flowchart of proactive channel access model 
The available amount of the bandwidth is the key to 
determine the channel switch. When the remaining channel 
idle time is the same, the channel with bigger bandwidth 
possesses higher data transmission rate so that secondary users 
can finish their transmission faster.  
Example: In Fig. 7, the channel remaining idle time of CH 
Y is larger than that of CH X. It is the best choice to switch to 
CH X according to conventional channel switch method which 
31

does not consider the channel bandwidth. After taking it into 
consideration, even if the channel remaining idle time of CH 
Y is larger than that of CH X, CH X can achieve faster data 
transmission since the channel bandwidth of CH X is twice 
that of CH Y. Selecting CH X not only reduces the cost of 
channel switch and the slots needed for further spectrum 
sensing so that more slots can be used for data transmission, 
but also requires less time to finish transmission. 
 
Figure 7.  Channel selection with bandwidth consideration 
As for the process of reactive channel access shown in Fig. 
8, cognitive radio will first select a channel which is in IDLE 
state with maximum bandwidth to be “the First channel”, and 
start data transmission for 180ms. After finishing data 
transmission for 180ms, cognitive radio will perform spectrum 
sensing for 20ms periodically. Once primary user appears, 
cognitive radio will switch to the channel which has maximum 
bandwidth to resume communication if idle channels exist; 
otherwise, cognitive radio will keep spectrum sensing until the 
first idle channel appears.

IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
We take various channel bandwidths into consideration to 
make spectrum handoff decision with the method proposed 
before under real cognitive radio environment, and use this 
method to analyze the performance. In our simulation 
environment, there are a secondary user and ten primary users. 
The bandwidths of ten primary channels are uniformly 
distributed from 1 to 10 MHz and the mean idle and busy 
periods are also uniformly distributed in min=0.5 and 
max=0.6~2.0. Sensing period and switch cost is 20ms. The 
period of data transmission is 180ms. Simulation time is set to 
10000 sec. 
Fig. 9 shows the number of channel switch in proactive 
and reactive methods. Note that proactive channel access 
method will process channel switch before primary users 
appear in order not to interfere with the primary users. On the 
other hand, reactive method just switch after primary users 
appear. Therefore, the number of channel switch in proactive 
method will be larger than that in reactive method. 
Fig. 10 illustrates the number of interruption by primary 
users in these two methods. We find that the number of 
interruption by primary users in proactive method is always 
smaller than that in reactive method since proactive method 
predicts future primary channel state according to previous 
primary users’ traffic. 
Channel utilization rate in both methods is shown in Fig.11. 
Instead of choosing the longest transmission time, proactive 
method always chooses the channel with maximum data 
transmission rate to switch. Comparing with reactive method 
which switches to the first channel with the idle state, the 
channel utilization rate of proactive method is lower than that 
of reactive method. 
Proactive method can derive channel remaining time 
according to channel prediction model, and use the product of 
channel remaining idle time and the channel bandwidth to 
switch to channel with maximum data transmission rate, while 
in reactive method, cognitive radio will switch to the channel 
which has the maximum bandwidth without considering the 
probability of appearance of primary users, as shown in Fig. 
12.

CONCLUSION 
Previous methods of channel switch just apply to channels 
with the same bandwidth. In this paper, we take different 
bandwidths into consideration for that purpose. Under these 
circumstances, the rule of channel switch should be changed in 
order to find the channel which meets the requirements of the 
users. By comparing the Proactive with the Reactive methods, 
we conclude that the former has better performance in terms of 
total transmission data rate and the number of disruptions by 
primary users, while the latter enjoys less channel switches and 
higher channel utilization rate.
