Abstract—A Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) technique is 
presented, which allows dynamic access to the countrywide full 28 
GHz Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) spectrum to an arbitrary 
number of Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to serve their 
respective in-building Small Cells (SCs). Co-Channel Interference 
(CCI) is managed by controlling the transmission power of in-
building SCs of each MNO. Using the Equal Likelihood Criterion 
and the properties of left-justified Pascal’s triangle, we derive the 
system-level average capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and 
Energy Efficiency (EE) performance metrics. We carry out 
numerical analyses and simulation results for a country with four 
MNOs. It is shown that the proposed DSS can improve SE by 
about 2.64 times and EE by about 74.28% over that of the Static 
Equal Spectrum Allocation (SESA). Moreover, we show that the 
proposed DSS requires the reuse of the countrywide mmWave 
spectrum to 71.87% fewer buildings of SCs than that required by 
the SESA to satisfy the expected SE and EE requirements for the 
Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile systems.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Addressing high capacity and data rate demands with limited 
spectrum bandwidth allocated to a Mobile Network Operator 
(MNO) has become a major issue for the Fifth-Generation (5G) 
and beyond mobile systems. Since the achievable capacity is 
directly proportional to the spectrum bandwidth of an MNO, an 
effective approach to address high capacity and data rate is to 
allow each MNO to access the full spectrum in a country. 
However, allowing access to the Countrywide Full-Spectrum 
(CFS) to each MNO causes Co-Channel Interference (CCI), 
which can be managed in the Power-Domain (PD).  
The concept of countrywide full spectrum allocation and 
sharing is not so obvious in the existing literature. Saha [1] 
proposed a hybrid interweave-underlay CFS allocation in the 
28 GHz band by managing CCI in the PD. CFS allocation in 
the 28 GHz has been investigated later in Saha [2] by managing 
CCI in the time-and frequency-domain. However, in both 
studies, the analyses were limited to a specific number of 
MNOs in a country. In this paper, we relax the assumptions in 
Saha [1] and Saha [2] and present a Dynamic Spectrum Sharing 
(DSS) technique for an arbitrary number of MNOs in a country. 
Unlike the traditional DSS techniques in 5G New Radio (NR) 
where each MNO (allocated to a portion of the countrywide full 
spectra) shares its spectrum dynamically with other MNOs 
countrywide, the proposed DSS technique allows access to the 
countrywide full 28 GHz spectrum to each MNO dynamically 
to serve its in-building Small Cells (SCs) by controlling the 
transmission power of SCs within each building using the Equal 
Likelihood Criterion and the properties of left-justified Pascal’s 
triangle.    
We organize the paper as follows. In Section II, the system 
architecture and the proposed DSS technique are described. 
Relevant mathematical analysis of DSS is carried out in Section 
III and performance evaluation and comparison are performed 
in Section IV. We conclude the paper in Section V.   
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND PROPOSED DSS TECHNIQUE 
A. System Architecture 
The system architecture consists of an arbitrary number of 
O MNOs in a country, which is shown in Figure 1(a) for O=4. 
Considering a similar architectural feature for each MNO, only 
one MNO (e.g., MNO 1) is shown in detail in Figure 1(c). An 
SC of each MNO is deployed in each apartment of a building. 
All Macrocells (MCs) and Picocells (PCs) operate at the 2 GHz 
outdoors, while SCs operate at the 28 GHz indoors. Let 
m
P and 
rP denote the maximum and the reduced transmission powers 
of an SC of MNO o. Since all MNOs operate at the CFS, with 
an increase in the number of interferers, i.e., SC User 
Equipments (SUEs) of MNOs O\o, the aggregate interference 
from one SC to another increases. This causes the transmission 
power 
rP of each SC of all MNOs to be adjusted such that the 
aggregate interference power does not exceed the interference 
threshold (i.e., the maximum value of CCI power)

. Figure 1(b) shows the 
transmission power levels of an SC to manage CCI for O=4.  
The existence of any interferer SUEs (iSUEs) of MNOs O\o in 
an apartment can be detected by the SC of MNO o itself using 
any conventional spectrum sensing techniques to update the 
CCI and spectrum usage status real-time basis in every 
Transmission Time Interval (TTI) level by coordinating one 
MNO with another directly in a distributed manner [3].  
B. Proposed DSS Technique  
      The proposed Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) technique 
is stated as follows. An MNO o can be allocated to the CFS 
dynamically to operate its in-building SCs, subjected to 
managing CCI with SCs of other MNOs O\o over a certain 
license renewal term 
rt . CCI is considered managing in the PD

by controlling the transmission power of each SC using the 
following principle. An SC of MNO o operates at the maximum 
transmission power if no SC User Equipment (UE) of MNOs 
O\o is present, while at reduced power if an SUE of MNO O\o 
is present, within the corresponding SC coverage of MNO o in 
a building. The reduced power is subjected to satisfying the 
maximum allowable CCI at the SC of MNO o. 
III. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF DSS 
Let O be the maximum number of MNOs in a country such 
that

(mmWave) spectrum allocated to an MNO o and a country, 
respectively, be 
o
M and
C
M , defined in terms of the number of 
Resource Blocks (RBs) where an RB is equal to 180 kHz. 
Consider that each SC can serve one SUE at a time, and each 
combination of the coexistence of SUEs of MNOs O\o (one UE 
from each MNO) with a UE of MNO o in an apartment is 
equally likely over any observation time 
T  Q
and hence 
occurs with a probability of 

apartment) such that

     However, due to the presence of Line-Of-Sight (LOS) 
components, low multipath fading effect, high distance-
dependent path loss, small coverage, high wall and floor 
penetration loss, and low UE speed, the signal propagation 
characteristic at a high-frequency 28 GHz mmWave band does 
not change considerably indoors. Hence, we consider that each 
building has similar indoor signal propagation characteristics.

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND COMPARISON 
Table I shows selected parameters and assumptions used for 
the performance evaluation. However, the detailed simulation 
parameters and assumptions can be found in [2]. Using (4)-(9) 
and Table I, Figure 2 shows average capacity, SE, and EE 
responses for the proposed DSS and traditional SESA 
techniques. From Figure 2(a), it can be found that proposed 
DSS improves SE by about 2.64 times and EE by about 74.28%, 
respectively over that of the traditional SESA. The similar 
outperformance in SE and EE can be found in Figures 2(b)-2(c) 
over that of SESA with the variation of L.

      The Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile system is expected to 
offer SE of 370 bps/Hz and EE of 0.3 uJ/bit [5]. Using Figure 
2(b), the minimum values of L required by DSS and SESA are 
9 and 32, respectively, to satisfy the above SE and EE 
requirements for 6G. Hence, DSS requires the reuse of the 
countrywide 28 GHz spectrum to 71.87% fewer buildings than 
that of SESA.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented a Dynamic Spectrum 
Sharing (DSS) technique to share the countrywide full 28 GHz 
spectrum with in-building SCs of each MNO by controlling the 
transmission power of SCs. The proposed DSS has been 
detailed, and its outperformance over the traditional SESA in 
terms of average capacity, SE and, EE has been shown.
