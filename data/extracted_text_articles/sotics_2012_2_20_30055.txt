Abstract—The 
majority 
of 
existing 
methodologies 
for 
evaluation of e-government policies is underdeveloped and 
partial, preventing comprehensive and objective evaluation. 
This situation consequently results in poor quality of planning 
and implementation process, while further diminishing positive 
effects and decreasing public consumption of e-government 
services. One of the most frequently overlooked aspects of e-
government policies evaluation is the concept of public interest, 
which is not given sufficient attention within existing 
evaluation methodologies, reducing the legitimacy of policy 
making in the field. The significance of public interest is often 
elusively defined, while its dimensions are somehow rendered 
particularly within the financial benefits. Paper provides an 
analysis of more than 50 methodologies for evaluation of e-
government policies, exploring the presence of public interest 
aspect within. Analysis offers an insight into the current 
evaluation practice enabling detection of its deficiencies as well 
as their mitigation, and could facilitate a significant 
contribution to more evidence-based evaluation of e-
government policies.

 INTRODUCTION 
Various studies indicate that further e-government 
development is one of the most important factors of public 
sector rationalization [1][2][3], as well as faster countries' 
development [4][5][6]. Despite considerable investments in 
e-government in recent years (European Union (EU) 
countries are investing approximately 2.2% of Gross 
Domestic 
Product 
(GDP) 
in 
Information 
and 
Communication Technology (ICT) in the field of public 
sector [7][8][9]) the expected effects in terms of reducing 
costs and increasing the effectiveness of public sector are 
still rather ambiguous, while user acceptance of e-
government services is far below government anticipations. 
Disclosed issues and present public finance situation along 
with increasingly stringent austerity measures require 
careful direction of further e-government investments, 
particularly focusing on proficient evaluation of e-
government policies and their effects – be it on national, 
local or sectoral level.    
Past experience in the field necessitates the development 
of methodologies for evaluation of e-government policies 
(the collective term “methodologies” is used denoting 
approaches, 
studies, 
indicator 
models, 
measurement 
frameworks and similar undertakings for evaluation of e-
government policies) which could enable e-government 
decision-makers to conduct more qualified and quantified 
preparation, execution and evaluation of e-government 
policies including their broader societal implications. 
Considering e-government development so far, we have 
been witnessing a big gap between supply and demand of 
public e-services in most countries, which can be 
prevailingly attributed to “politically driven” development 
rather than “evidence based” evaluation and selection of e-
government policies [10][11][12]. 
Notwithstanding the increasing number of different 
evaluation methodologies emerging in the last years  
[13][14][15], some aspects of e-government policies 
evaluation have been largely disregarded, particularly public 
interest as one of the foundations of public policy making. 
This rather unsatisfactory state of affairs has led to growing 
calls 
for 
a 
reassessment 
and 
rebalancing 
of 
the 
rationalisations in evaluation of e-government policies, and 
in particular for a greater weight to be given to the public 
interest [16]. 
The paper discusses the main features of existing 
methodologies for evaluation of e-government policies and 
analyses their evaluation foci trying to establish the extent to 
which existing methodologies facilitate evaluation of public 
interest. Deriving from the aforementioned research 
objectives the paper is focusing primarily on the following 
interrelated research questions: 
1) Overview and study of existing methodologies for 
evaluation of e-government policies and summary of 
their characteristics.  
2) Analysis of the existing methodologies for evaluation 
of e-government policies regarding the aspect of public 
interest.  
From the methodological point of view, research 
represents a typical in-depth analysis, while research 
activities 
are 
embedded 
in 
two-phase 
incremental 
methodological framework. Combining different techniques 
of qualitative research methods [17], the initial part of the 
study has focused on the analysis of primary and secondary 
35

sources, whereas deriving from obtained research results, 
the conclusive part of the research is striving to integrate 
theoretical and practical aspects regarding the research 
subject. Selection of research methods was adapted to the 
research field [17][18] given the complexity of e-
government evaluation initiatives. 
Following the introduction, the second section of the 
paper presents the concept of public interest and an 
overview of the relevant literature while outlining various 
directions in evaluation of e-government policies and related 
issues and barriers. The third section provides an analysis of 
existing methodologies for evaluation of e-government 
policies and summary of their characteristics. The fourth 
section explores presence of the public interest aspect in the 
existing methodologies and sketches the research findings. 
The last section contains the review of the overall research, 
discussion on its limitations and subsequently submits the 
final arguments and observations regarding the research 
results and future work. 
II. 
CONCEPT OF PUBLIC INTEREST AND METHODOLOGIES 
FOR EVALUATION OF E-GOVERNMENT POLICIES – STATE OF 
THE ART 
The public interest is not a unitary concept: different 
public interests are relevant in different scenarios and need 
to be weighted differently depending on the circumstances 
[16]. Public policy makers, expert public and citizens have 
to find the appropriate balance of the numerous public 
interests that may exist in any given situation. Finding this 
balance will not only involve comparing the relative 
importance of one public interest to another but also involve 
the contemplation of the interconnection of public interests 
and considering the broader impact that these may have in 
turn on other public interest networks [19]. 
Although there are different conceptions of public 
interest inaugurating different research perspectives, most 
frequently, public interest is viewed as a set of substantive 
ideals against which all policy proposals should be judged. 
The concept is thus recognized as a symbol to which all 
agree (few people are opposed to the public interest) and to 
which special interests appeal in order to rationalize their 
policy desires [20]. Regarding the contextual platform 
consisted of political and cultural framework of a particular 
society and the economic resources at its disposal, the 
public interest is defined as the aggregate of the 
fundamental goals that the society seeks to achieve for all of 
its members. Thus, the art of government consists of 
achieving a harmonious rather than a destructive balance 
among conflicting goals [21]. Some authors have studied 
the public interest concept from the aspect of substantive 
truths or principles. These truths or principals are not formal 
tests that any public policy must meet; however general they 
may be and however much skill may be required to apply 
them in particular cases, they provide substantive guidance 
to the proper content of public policy [22]. While others 
consider public interest and its dimensions primarily as a 
process of public action, primarily bargaining and 
competition between different interest groups, resulting in 
the overall social consensus [23]. Summarizing numerous 
and occasionally complex definitions of the public interest 
concept, it can be generally regarded as a set of commonly 
agreed goals arising from the inclusive and transparent 
decision-making procedure, based on compromise and 
shared values of well-defined social community.   
 Despite its complexity and diversity of research 
approaches and perspectives, public sector concept is 
elaborated relatively well in theory, whereas it has failed to 
gain significant attention in majority of e-government 
evaluation undertakings. Consideration of public interest 
concept in methodologies for evaluation of e-government 
policies is often inadequate and superficial covering 
prevailingly financial factors and omitting all other societal 
aspects while reducing the potential of evaluation process 
for objective and comprehensive evaluation.  
A. Methodologies for evaluation of e-government policies 
In parallel to e-government development there have 
emerged numerous methodologies, trying to evaluate its 
development and effects on different parameters of 
government operation. According to their characteristics and 
subject of evaluation these methodologies could be 
classified in typical groups presented below. 
1) Front-office maturity and readiness  
The most known benchmark measurements on the EU 
level have been conducted by Capgemini [7][8][9], while 
the most renowned benchmark measurements on the global 
scale have been carried out by the UN [14][24], Accenture 
[25] and Brown University [26]. While focusing primarily 
on web site analysis, indicators from these methodologies 
are not precise enough to ensure comprehensive evaluation 
and validation of e-government policies on the national 
level (see critical analysis of such benchmark measurements 
from [12][27][28], etc.). Some other important benchmark 
measurements dealing with e-readiness are: The Global 
Information Technology Report [15], Digital economy 
rankings [29] and United Nations e-Government Survey 
[14][24]. These benchmark measurements deploy different 
sets of indicators for benchmarking e-readiness and 
information society in general. Being predominantly 
focused 
on 
front-office 
change 
and 
infrastructural 
requirements, these rather extensive methodologies are 
hardly providing evaluation of public interest, incapacitating 
its incorporation in the process of further e-government 
development.  
2) Effects and impacts of e-government policies 
Within a number of methodologies focusing on ex-ante 
and ex-post evaluation of e-government policies we could 
highlight: MAREVA [30], eGEP [31], WiBe 4.0 [32] and 
AGIMO [33]. MAREVA is dealing with ex-ante and ex-
post evaluations of e-government policies on the basis of 
parameters such as profitability, risks, benefits, necessity; 
similar aspects are evaluated by WiBe 4.0. AGIMO and 
eGEP are striving to identify and analyse costs of 
establishment, provision, maintenance and performance as 
well as impacts of e-government services. In general we 
could find these methodologies very exhaustive in terms of 
the large number of indicators; however they rarely address 
the concept of public interest comprehensively, while some 
36

SOTICS 2012 : The Second International Conference on Social Eco-Informatics

particularised dimensions of public interest are normally 
amalgamated with financial benefits.   
Considering significant organizational changes in the 
public sector organizations, induced by implementation of 
e-government policies, the research in the field is primarily 
focused 
on 
joined-up 
e-government 
model 
[34], 
organizational changes in the direction of network 
government [35], management and external factors which 
affect e-government development [36], business process 
change, 
information 
management 
capacity 
and 
organizational capabilities [37][38] and organizational 
culture [39]. An overview of related methodologies reveals 
there is no clear consensus on organizational changes 
caused by e-government implementation, and consequently 
no comprehensible methodology to measure implications of 
transformed public sector organizations for the various 
social aspects and implementation of public interest. 
3) National-level development 
Surveys often highlight political and sociological factors 
as the most important external factors affecting e-
government development. This aspect is partially discussed 
in United Nations e-Government Survey [14][24] through 
indicators 
such 
as 
e-participation, 
e-inclusion, 
e-
consultations, and other research in the field [9][25][40] is 
focusing on political and sociological indicators such as 
accessibility, digital divide, human rights, social inclusion, 
economic sustainability and life-long learning. However, we 
can see that such indicators are very general and it is hard to 
incorporate them in a national context and determine their 
actual 
impact 
and 
correlation 
with 
e-government 
development. Despite economic activities on national level 
could significantly affect e-government development in 
individual country, research [11][41][42] dealing with 
national economic indicators and their implications for e-
government is rather limited. Scarce studies [41] in the area 
are trying to define connections between national economic 
indicators 
and 
e-government 
development 
indicators 
specifically emphasizing correlations between GDP per 
capita, competitiveness, economic performance, government 
efficiency, use of ICT in the private sector, innovation index 
and internet access. The aspect of public interest within 
outlined methodologies is poorly elaborated and thus 
inadequately evaluated, while it appears that identification 
and formulation of vaguely indicated long-term public goals 
is hardly reached by public consensus. 
4) Evaluation of e-government policies – issues and 
barriers 
Evaluation of e-government policies is generally 
difficult [6][8][27][28], given the numerous obstacles to 
evaluation (Table 1) [43], complexity of public interest and 
frequent lack of clarity of objectives owing to the different 
and often competing stakeholder views. In addition, 
overlapping of initiatives and policies and their continuous 
fine-tuning related to volatile public opinion complicate 
monitoring and evaluation. The fact that e-government is 
relatively new is probably the main reason for fewer models 
and actual outcome experiences that can be used for 
benchmarking [43] and inclusion of public interest 
dimension. Effective evaluation including aspect of public 
interest requires good metrics, regular monitoring and 
reporting, disciplined and professional use of robust 
evaluation frameworks and the use of long-term evaluation 
practices. These qualities depend on a government’s overall 
evaluation culture [43]. E-government project failures could 
have been mitigated by appropriate and comprehensive 
evaluation in the course of their conceptualization and 
planning [12][44][45], the identification and elimination of 
the main obstacles to e-government evaluation, which 
obviously extend to several areas, such as: institutional, 
political, social, and cultural area, will require a broad 
consensus and strong commitment of all stakeholders. 
TABLE I.  
OBSTACLES TO E-GOVERNMENT EVALUATION 
Obstacle 
Example 
Lack of clarity of objectives - stated 
goals may not have associated 
measures of progress; there may be 
multiple objectives 
Hard to measure "quality of life". 
Hard to define success              
If people are spending more time online, 
is that good or bad? 
Easy to be too ambitious 
Several countries have set targets of "all 
services online" by specific dates. But 
not all services are appropriate to put 
online. 
Information paradox 
The benefits of ICT investment may not 
be visible for some time. 
Question of who are the clients; 
multiple clients 
Should one evaluate benefits for the 
users, the employees, the government at 
large, partners, etc.? 
Hard to measure shared benefits 
Shared infrastructure, multiple projects 
benefiting from shared portal, etc. 
Private sector tools may not work 
for governments 
Governments place importance on 
social values that are not incorporated 
into private sector tools and objectives. 
Available indicators may not be the 
good ones 
Current indicators (such as number of 
employees with internet connections) 
are helpful, but have limits. 
Government definitions and 
methodologies vary from one 
country to the next 
Collecting data is easier at the local 
level, but at that level administrations 
are highly decentralised. 
Incentives to misstate evaluation 
results 
If an organisation succeeds in saving 
money, telling others may result in their 
losing that money. 
Challenge of sharing results 
Hard to get organisations to report 
unsatisfactory results. 
What you measure may become 
focus of organisation 
If you measure number of services 
online, but not service quality, priority 
will be on putting services online but 
not on service quality. 
III. 
ANALYSIS OF EXISTING METHODOLOGIES FOR 
EVALUATION OF E-GOVERNMENT POLICIES  
The review of existing methodologies and various 
alternative approaches for evaluation of e-government 
policies was conducted in the second half of 2011. During 
that time we conducted an analysis of primary and secondary 
online resources, policy papers, reports, books, strategic 
documents, action plans and other documents containing e-
government related research. In the initial phase of the 
review, we used key words of evaluation, assessment, 
measurement, monitoring, indicator models, e-government 
projects, e-government policies and effects (impacts) of e-
government policies, and subsequently identified and 
37

retrieved more than 380 related references in total. The 
frequency of references is becoming much higher in the 
second half of the last decade, proving the field is evolving 
rapidly and the interest of both the research community as 
well as policy makers on national and international level is 
increasing. In the second phase of the review, the identified 
references were tested by inclusion into the research 
framework containing two criteria, namely 1) identified 
reference must be completed project where evaluation of e-
government policies is clearly outlined as the main research 
objective and 2) the reference must contain explicit 
indicators or benchmarks for evaluation of e-government 
policies. References which did not comply with both criteria 
as set out in the research framework were eliminated. After 
substantive verification and filtration, the vast majority of the 
items were excluded, leaving only 52 valid references. 
Identified methodologies and their publication types are 
catalogued in Table 2.

Report 
 
Conducting our review we have identified basically 
three types of references dealing with our subject of 
discourse. Taking into account their development level we 
categorized the identified methodologies into three groups: 
1) purely theoretical papers aiming to develop some kind of 
conceptual framework for evaluation of e-government 
policies, 2) research efforts developed up to the degree of 
pilot application and 3) methodologies developed in the 
practice for the practice (practical application). 
Analyzing 
the 
diverse 
variety 
of 
evaluation 
methodologies identified in this area, certain general 
characteristics were identified and summarized below: 
 
Majority of the identified methodologies (30) for 
evaluation of e-government policies are presented in 
scholarly papers and books.  
 
Certain methodologies are rather abstract containing 
speculatively selected indicators often encompassing 
non evidence-based theoretical platforms, while their 
utilization does not facilitate the acquirement of 
quantifiable evaluation results. 
 
Accredited methodologies are to a large extent 
narrowly focused assessing predominantly one of the 
various evaluation aspects. 
 
More mature methodologies are consisted of a large 
number of indicators, which are normally aligned for 
evaluation 
of 
e-government 
policies 
in 
the 
originating countries. 
 
Majority of the identified methodologies are not 
providing a comprehensive evaluation of complex e-
government policies impacts and their potential 
long-term outcomes.   
IV. 
PRESENCE OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST ASPECT IN THE 
EXISTING METHODOLOGIES   
Quest for satisfaction of the public interest, as presented 
in theory [16][22][23], should be at the heart of every e-
government policy making process, while its various 
dimensions should be comprehensively covered in the 
setting of long-term public goals. The latter assumption 
requires accountability of public policy makers and 
evidence-based decision making, which must be based on 
comprehensive and balanced methodologies facilitating 
evaluation of various aspects of the designated e-
government policy, its effects and the potential far-reaching 
consequences. Deliberation between public stakeholders 
[83], transparent policy making process and ultimate public 
consensus will increase the viability of high investments in 
e-government and facilitate positive response to the e-
government policy and more beneficial acceptance of new 
e-services while allowing the pursuit of public interest and 
overall social development.  
Proliferation 
of 
advanced 
ICT 
solutions 
and 
development of e-government have changed the social 
structure and political-sociological paradigm of the country 
as the widest social community [14][79]. E-government 
demonstrates considerable potential for the achievement of 
various ICT-induced social changes which could hopefully 
result in the accomplishment of at least some of the 
objectives within the public interest domain. 
Political-sociological effects of ICT and e-government 
on the society in general are very complex. They have a 
significant impact on changes of the social environment, 
they are affecting old and creating new forms of work and 
changing perception of the world and social relations 
[72][80][81][82]. Accordingly, existing methodologies are 
converging on the following aspects of public interest in e-
government evaluation:  accessibility [4][24][55], citizens’ 
trust 
and 
confidence 
[25][70][71], 
digital 
divide 
[4][43][15][79], social stratification and cohesion, citizens’ 
rights and democratic participation [5][15][40], openness, 
transparency and corruption [9][14][24]. Notwithstanding 
the importance of adequate evaluation of e-government 
impacts [6][9], integrated methodologies covering the aspect 
of public interest comprehensively, are rather scarce. 
Findings regarding the public interest aspect in the existing 
methodologies are categorized below: 
 
The aspect of public interest is assigned a peripheral 
role in most of the existing methodologies for 
evaluation of e-government policies. 
 
The concept of public interest is not clearly 
elaborated 
and 
categorized 
in 
the 
existing 
methodologies, 
preventing 
its 
comprehensive 
inclusion in the actual evaluation undertakings.   
 
Methodologies are applying large number of 
indicators when focused on evaluation of the costs, 
benefits and risks (the most segments of public 
interest aspect are usually incorporated with 
38

SOTICS 2012 : The Second International Conference on Social Eco-Informatics

benefits). However, the aspect of public interest in 
its individual form is usually allocated a very small 
number of indicators. 
 
Covering public interest in existing methodologies is 
particularized, usually including arbitrarily selected 
dimension of public interest. 
 
Aspect of public interest presented in methodologies 
is often inadequate and superficial focusing 
predominantly on financial benefits and omitting all 
other societal aspects while reducing the potential of 
evaluation process for objective and comprehensive 
evaluation. 
 
Existing examples of the integration of public 
interest aspect in the methodologies are speculative, 
since the segments of the public interest within the 
methodology were developed by policy makers 
without appropriate deliberation procedure and 
public consensus.  
Accordingly, inclusion of the public interest concept into 
the comprehensive methodology for evaluation of e-
government policies should encompass the following 
activities:   
 
Analyze the overall evaluation field and define the 
particular aspects of evaluation within e-government 
policy (e.g., infrastructural aspect, organizational 
aspect, political aspect, etc.). 
 
Define and clearly structure the notion of public 
interest and associated components. Constructs 
should not be too abstract, because it could prevent 
the acquisition of the required data, establishment of 
indicators and their measurement in practice, 
decreasing the overall evaluation success.  
 
Concept of the public interest should constitute a 
relatively autonomous category, preventing the 
dissipation of its components between other aspects 
of evaluation, which could significantly diminish its 
importance.     
 
Delineate the aspects of evaluation as much as 
possible and prevent overlapping and transition of 
the indicators from different aspects of evaluation.  
 
Conceptualize adequate and measurable indicators 
containing precisely specified object and unit of 
measurement, structure, context, etc.  
 
Indicators should be specifically focused on the 
evaluation of long-term public interest and goals that 
have been set out in the designated e-government 
policy. Evaluation of the public interest concept 
should be multidimensional including the demand 
side of e-government services (user preferences, 
needs and satisfaction, etc.), general value of e-
government policy for all social groups, its 
contribution to sustainable and inclusive social 
development, 
human 
rights 
and 
liberties, 
development of democratic values, etc.   
 
Assign appropriate weight to the concept of public 
interest and its components in the final aggregation 
of the evaluation results.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
Research revealed a multitude of approaches which have 
been used in previous research studies and evaluation 
endeavors in this area, but still, their utilization in the 
process of comprehensive evaluation of e-government 
policies is only conditionally exploitable. 
Despite limitations, seen mainly in the large diversity 
and absence of unified and clear theoretical framework, 
conducted analysis provides a valuable insight into the 
current e-government evaluation practice and facilitates 
exposure of inadequately evaluated public interest areas in 
the domain of e-government policies. The analysis results 
represent an advance in research of evaluation metrics and 
may eventually provide a solid platform for establishment of 
comprehensive methodology for evaluation of e-government 
policies including public interest aspect.  
Problems in the development, usage and general success 
of e-government initiatives are evidently interrelated with 
the low quality and underdeveloped methodologies for 
evaluation of e-government policies and their public effects. 
Addressed shortcomings will have to be resolved, in order 
to ensure quality evaluation and disclosure of objective 
situation in the field, which could ultimately initiate the 
broader inclusion of public interest dimensions into the e-
government policy-making procedures, and accelerate the 
overall 
development 
of 
e-government 
policies 
and 
appropriate e-services with added value for all stakeholders.
