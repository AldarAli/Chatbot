Abstract—The massive growth of social networks has created a 
need for the development of algorithms and systems that can 
be used for their analysis.  Techniques that reveal the structure 
and the information flow within the network can be used to 
understand the dynamics of the network and provide new 
opportunities in promoting virtual communities for a variety of 
purposes.  The basis of this research work is the understanding 
of a social network community, with special emphasis on 
communities that overlap.  A community is deﬁned as a 
subgraph with a higher internal density and a lower crossing 
density with others subgraphs. In this research, we apply a 
distance based ranking algorithm, the Overlapped Correlation 
Density 
based 
Partitioning 
(OCDP), 
to 
understand 
communities that overlap.  We introduce the OCDP algorithm, 
and present preliminary results of the technique through its 
application to a real world data set, the Bottlenose dolphin 
network.  The OCDP is compared with other algorithmic 
approaches, and in preliminary results show that it has good 
performance across different evaluation metrics.

 INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) 
Community detection is an significant issue in social 
network analysis, where the objective is to recognize related 
sets of members such that intra-community associations are 
denser than inter-communities associations [2][3][5][6][8]-
[11][14][15]. Researchers have presented various methods 
to extract communities from an SN that paper [17] presented 
a survey of these studies. Speciﬁcally, discovering the 
organizational structure of communities in an SN has been 
identiﬁed as an interesting but challenging problem [4,13]. 
Examples of important applications include characterizing 
potential key candidates for viral marketing or discovering 
core members of criminal group in monitoring criminal 
network [13]. Research on ﬁnding motivated members in a 
Social Networks is one component of this researhc, but 
outcomes have limited power to supply a complete view of 
the organizational structure.   
In the real-world networks, communities are often not 
disjoint but overlapped to some extent [19]. For example, in 
social life, a person usually has connections with several 
social groups such as family, friends, and colleagues; a 
researcher may collaborate with other researchers in 
different fields. This can also happen in many other 
complex networks including biological networks, online 
social networks, and so on. Indeed, overlap is quite a 
significant feature in real-world social networks [20]. For 
this reason, researchers have paid attention to the problem 
of overlapping community detection, and many techniques 
have been proposed, such as the the Link method which 
reinvents communities as groups of links rather than nodes 
[21], fuzzy c-means clustering [22],  and the algorithms 
utilizing local expansion and optimization including LFM 
(Local Fitness Maximization) [23], UEOC (the Unfold and 
Extract 
Overlapping 
Communities) 
[24], 
DenShrink 
(Density-based Shrinkage) [25] and the method based on a 
local definition of community strength [25]. A review of 
overlapping community detection algorithms is found in 
[26] along with quality measures and several existing 
benchmarks.   The authors have previously defined the 
Community Density Rank [18], a measure that is used to 
evaluate the structure of a community.  In this research 
paper, we extend the CDR algorithm to define the 
Overlapped Correlation Density based Partitioning (OCDP), 
to understand communities that overlap, and present initial 
results from the application of the algorithm to a real world 
data set, the Bottlenose dolphin network.  The OCDP is 
compared with other algorithmic approaches, and it is 
shown that it has an equal performance with several 
published algorithms over a publicly available community 
data set, the Bottlenose Dolphin Network.  It should be 
noted that this research effort is a work in progress, and 
though promising the OCDP has to be validated over much 
larger data sets.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
introduces the methodology and outlines the OCDP. Section 
III presents the results of the analysis on a real life data set 
and Section IV concludes the paper and proposes future 
work.  
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
In the analysis of a network, the first task is to compare 
nodes.  In order to execute this task, the importance of each 
node within the network has to be understood. The nodes 
13

that link to many other important nodes are themselves 
important. This process of analysis is similar to PageRank 
based algorithms [24].  The PageRank algorithm is the best 
known of these approaches, having been the basis of the 
original search mechanism for Google.  Here the global 
“importance” ranking for every web page is obtained by 
analyzing links among web pages. Other algorithms that 
improve on PageRank such as HITS, OPIC and etc. have 
been proposed.  
The OCDP computation proceeds in two parts- first we 
compute the Correlation Density Rank (CDR) of each node, 
and second, we use the CDR to find core nodes and the 
nodes associated with the cores (the community).  The 
Correlation Density Rank (CDR), is based on finding more 
frequent 
and 
influential 
Randomized 
Shortest 
Paths(RSP)[57] between nodes. In RSP model, the 
randomness of the walker is constrained by fixing the 
relative entropy between the distribution over paths 
according to the reference probabilities and the distribution 
over paths that the walker actually chooses from. With this 
constraint, the walker then chooses the path from the 
probability distribution that minimizes the expected cost.  
We employ the RSP measurement method in [23] as the 
distance between nodes, but with one major difference: we 
consider customized initial cost for edges such that, along 
with finding shortest path between nodes. The random 
walker intelligently selects the most important neighbor 
resulting in lower cost and smaller distance.  The CDR 
considers the distance between nodes as punishment and 
computes the density ranks of nodes. Hence, there will be a 
larger traffic amongst shortest path of nodes, if the distance 
becomes smaller. If the distance between nodes, i and j was 
less than the distance between i and k, then, i’s rank effect 
on j is more than on k, and the probability that a random 
surfer reaches j from i is more than the probability to reach 
k. Therefore, the objective is to minimize punishment so that 
a node with less distance entropy to have a higher rank.  The 
CDR scores of a node are compared with the nodes in its 
vertex border to determine the “core” of the community.  
Communities are then constructed around the cores 
iteratively, using a membership formulation, where each 
node can participate with communities formed by multiple 
cores.   
Deﬁnition 1 (Cardinality of a community). The cardinality 
of a community C is the number of its vertices. It is denoted 
by C . 
Deﬁnition 2 (Direct neighbor). In the graph G = (V, E), the 
vertex v is a direct neighbor of the node u if v and u are 
connected by an edge. This relationship is represented by 
the edge
,v u
 E
.  
Deﬁnition 3 (Vertex border). It is all the direct neighbors of 
node v in the graph. This set is noted by B(v). More 
formally this quantity is noted as follows:

RESULTS  
An experimental analysis of OCDP using a publicly 
available data set is described. We compared OCDP with 
five well-known algorithms: (1) CFinder (CPM) which 
implements the clique percolation (2011); (2) COPRA which 
is based on label propagation (2010); (3) GCE greedy 
approach (2013); and (4) EAGLE modularity-based 
approach (Eagle Community Detection Algorithm, 2012). 
(5) DOCNet (2014).  Bottlenose dolphin network is the real 
and well-known Dolphins social network which describes 
the associations between 62 dolphins living in Doubtful 
Sound, New Zealand (Figure 1).  The relationship between 
dolphins represent the statistically significant frequent 
association between them. This network is interesting 
because, during the course of the study, the dolphin group 
split into three smaller subgroups following the departure of 
key members of the population. In four commonly used 
measures in the overlapping community structure research, 
the modularity, 𝑄𝑜𝑣 ; the M rank; number of detected 
overlapping nod  es 𝑂𝑛
𝑑and detected memberships 𝑂𝑚
𝑑 ,)  the 
OCDP had similar or better results (Table 1). The measure 
evaluations are as follows (indicates better performance):  
𝑄𝑜𝑣, 𝑂𝑛
𝑑, 𝑂𝑚
𝑑 : higher,  M: lower.  While the results of the 
OCDP in comparison to other published techniques looks 
promising, it should be noted that this is a research effort in 
progress.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Social networks have become an ubiquitous feature of a 
highly connected global network of users.  Analysis of these 
networks is difficult due to the massive scale of the network 
and the complexity of the connectivity.  Of special interest is 
the structure and the information flow within the network.  
Knowledge of these may be leveraged to provide a basis for 
virtual communities that interact to achieve common goals in 
a number of domains.  In this research, we developed an 
algorithm the Overlapped Correlation Density based 
Partitioning (OCDP), that attempts to understand the 
structure of communities that share members.  We present 
preliminary results of the OCDP technique through its 
application to a real world data set, the Bottlenose dolphin 
network.  The Dolphin network while interesting is 
somewhat limited in the number of participants and their 
interactions.  Currently popular social networks involve 
hundreds of millions of participants, with billions of 
interactions and the scale up of this technique needs to be 
investigated.
