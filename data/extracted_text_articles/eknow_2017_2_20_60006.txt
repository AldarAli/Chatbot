Abstract— The aim of this paper is to perform a keyword 
analysis in two areas of research: Intellectual Capital and 
Knowledge Management. The keywords are of three types : 
keywords proposed by the authors in their articles, the 
keywords that users use in their queries and the densest words 
existing in a textual corpus. Zipf’s law usually applied for 
natural language is applied in this work for scientifc corpus 
constituted of confused full articles in each area. We wrote 8 R 
programs going through titles of articles, authors’ keywords, 
abstracts and full articles to calculate frequencies and interpret 
them. The keywords of intellectual capital measurement and 
diclosure have the highest frequencies. The measures are stated 
by companies in annual reports and could not be integrated in 
their balance sheets because the classical accounting does not 
take into acount intellectual capital as an asset. Knowledge 
management is more oriented towards the capitalization of 
knowledge to improve business 
performance and for 
industries. This work is the first in keyword analysis for the 
two areas.  It could be usefull to prepare glossaries, ontologies 
and all semantic reasearhes of research areas. 
Keywords-content analysis; keyword analysis; dense word; Zipf’s 
law; intellectual capital; knowledge management. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Our work is a quantitative analysis of keywords and in the 
areas of intellectual capital (IC) and knowledge management 
(KM). IC focuses on building and governing intellectual 
assets from strategic and enterprise governance perspectives 
with some focus on tactics [1]. KM is more detailed and 
focuses on facilitating and managing knowledge related 
activities such as creation, capture, transformation and use 
[1]. Otherwise, they are two faces of the same thing 
(knowledge); IC capitalizes it to create value and wealth 
and, KM manages it from acquisition to diffusion.  
A set of keywords indexes and densest words in a 
scientific article are proposed, calculated and analyzed to 
have an idea on the trends of scientific area via most used 
and extracted keywords and their evolution in time. In this 
paper, Zipf’s law was applied to confused abstracts of 
articles of IC and KM. The results were not satisfactory 
because the size of abstracts’ corpus is not sufficient to 
apply Zipf’s law, which is more adapted to larger corpuses. 
So we applied it on confused full articles of IC and KM 
separately to try to reach better results. 
The gap that we tried to satisfy is the inexistence of 
keyword analysis in IC and KM. This analysis is limited to 
articles existing in SCOPUS database and could be extended 
to other databases in the future. 
 
The paper is structured as follows: Section II contains the 
related works and Section III designs the solution and the 
application of R programs for the keyword analysis of IC 
and KM areas. Section IV is dedicated to analysis of results 
and finally, possible extensions to the work are announced 
to conclude the paper in Section V.  
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
In literature, there are several goals to keyword analysis. 
Among them, there is the research of Jaime I. L. et al [2] 
which is a proposition of a new keyword search algorithm 
that takes into account the semantic information extracted 
from the schemes of the structured and semi-structured data 
sources. Bang [3] focuses on the disciplines of the journal 
information system frontiers (ISF) researches. The author 
created a keyword classification scheme, incorporating new 
research topics into Barki’s information systems keyword 
classification scheme [24], to describe the disciplines of ISF 
until 2012, examining word frequency and keyword co-
occurrence. This work is limited to one journal in 
information systems and its results are not generalizable. On 
the other hand, Choi and Kang [4] extracted manually 
keywords from abstracts and titles from Journal of 
Educational Technology (JET) between 1985 and 2013 and 
found that educational technology research in Korea has 
been strongly influenced by new media, design theory, and 
educational assessment. The manual extraction of keywords 
takes time, limits the sample of articles and statements are 
true only for the sample; one journal is not sufficient.   Wu 
Bihu et al [5] examine author-selected keywords of research 
published in Annals of Tourism Research. In total, 5534 
keywords from 2504 articles form the basis of this analysis. 
Iterative coding results in 200 core keywords serving as 
descriptors of major research subjects, and 10 gene words 
indicating knowledge domains formed through cross-
references and hybridization of core keywords. By 
employing the social network analysis technique, Gohar and 
Jacob [6] found that the results highlight the importance of 
digital media and business, and IT governance to today’s 
information technology management environment.  
Zipf’s law is used in this work to show how much a 
scientific text respects it. Zipf stated that if one takes the 
words making up an extended body of text and ranks them 
by frequency of occurrence, then the rank of words 
multiplied by their frequency of occurrence will be 
approximately constant [7]. In [8], it is shown that the 
distribution of word frequencies for randomly generated 
texts is very similar to Zipf’s law observed in natural

languages such as English. On the internet, Zipf’s law 
appears to be the rule rather than an exception. It is present 
at the level of routers transmitting data from one geographic 
location to another and in the content of the World Wide 
Web [9].  
Our work provides a keyword analysis based on the 
calculation of frequencies of keywords in titles, abstracts and 
content of scientific articles for IC and KM areas to analyze 
quantitatively their trends in terms of themes, expressed by 
these frequencies. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY AND DATA 
Databases of research as SCOPUS do not offer keyword 
analysis and impose the type of exported data files; the 
performed analyses were adapted accordingly.  
A. Analysed data 
The data is exported from SCOPUS, i.e., a database which 
indexes thousands of scientific journals and more than fifty 
millions scientific articles in all areas of research. The data is 
a set of articles with “intellectual capital” or “knowledge 
management” in their titles. Analyses were performed on 
abstracts and full papers (PDF files). The scientific 
production is higher in KM (10000 articles) than IC (1500 
articles), according to data exported on April 16th 2016. 
B. Methodology 
Eight different programs are written in R language to 
achieve objectives of the study. The algorithms of the 
frequencies of author’s keywords and Zipf’s law are 
presented as examples; they produce results for sections A 
and E respectively after their implementation. The six 
remaining programs are developed for the results of B, C 
and D sections. 
 
Algorithm frequency_authors_keywords  
The authors’ keywords algorithm contains generic steps 
Begin 
1- Read the Excel file entries, 
2- Separate authors’ keywords of that article and put it in a 
table as they are combined in the same Excel box and 
separated by semicolons 
3- Repeat 1-2 until the Excel file is ended 
4- Calculate the frequency of authors’ keywords  
5- Order by descending order of frequencies 
6- Export the ordered Table in Excel 
7- Draw the overall graph on years 
End. 
 
Algorithm Zipfs_law 
The full articles are downloaded and gathered in the same 
directory to make a text corpus of an area. 
Begin 
1- Create an Excel file1 containing the names of PDF 
(acrobat reader) files gathered in a directory, each name in a 
row, 
2- Read the first name of PDF file from the Excel file1 and 
use it to open the PDF file, 
3- Read word by word and write them in text file3 created to 
include all the content of all PDF files together, and at the 
end of this operation it will be constituted the corpus of all 
PDF files (text corpus), 
4- Omit the punctuation from the text file3 
5- Repeat instructions 2-3 until the Excel file1 is ended, 
6- Each word of corpus from text file3 is added in a row in a 
second Excel file2 without repetition of words, 
7 - For each word from Excel file2, calculate frequency of 
the word in the corpus of text file3 
8- Repeat the operations 6-7 until text file3 is ended, 
9- Order the Excel file2 in descending order of frequencies 
10- For each word from Excel file2, calculate the value of 
the existing Zipf’s law for this word and put it in the second 
column, using the formula: 
Existing Zipf’s law (word) = Frequency (word) * rank (word 
in file2), 
11- Calculate the theoretic value of Zipf’s law for each word 
and put it in the third column, only the size of corpus is used 
as input to the theoretic value using the formula: 
Theoretic Zipf’s law (word) = Size of the corpus of text 
file3/rank (word in Excel file2), 
12- Repeat 10-11 until the end of Excel file3, 
13- Draw the graphs of theoretic and existing Zipf’s law 
- Note: this algorithm is applied once on IC and once on KM 
corpuses separately. 
End. 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The analyses were performed on abstracts, full papers and 
the other items of paper as titles and authors’ keywords. In 
certain cases, papers were analyzed individually then 
collectively. 
A. Authors’ keywords analysis 
1) Authors’ keywords analysis in IC area: In TABLE I,  we 
present the obtained frequencies of the authors’ keywords, 
in descending order (2308 keywords). The keywords 
highlited in TABLE I are discussed.

It is noted that research in IC area is oriented more 
towards IC management. At first, accountants are 
conscious about the measurement of IC as intangible asset

and tried to incorporate it to classical balance sheet next to 
tangible assets, but they have failed. Nowadays, the interest 
is extended to managers trying to disclose and exploit IC to 
improve business performance and IC is reported 
separately. In addition, it is noted that authors of IC area use 
a relatively short list of keywords to express the content of 
their scientific work but with significant frequencies and 
slight degradation between them. This is explained by the 
novelty of the field.  
 
2) Authors’ keywords analysis in KM area: for KM, the 
frequencies  of  authors’  keywords  are  represented in 
TABLE II, in descending order (6650 keywords).

It is noted that researches in KM are oriented more toward 
KM systems. The possession of tacit knowledge by experts 
is a competitive advantage. Data mining is used for 
automatic extraction of knowledge from existing databases. 
Knowledge sharing improves collaboration and is a 
concern of human resources management in a business or 
in a particular production system. The authors’ keywords 
Manufacture, 
industrial 
engineering, 
industrial 
economics and cybernetics are a strong argument that KM 
systems support industrial engineering and general industry. 
Moreover, it is noted that the authors of KM use a wide list 
of keywords relatively to express the content of their 
scientific work but with less frequencies than those of IC 
and have rapid degradations in frequencies. 
B. Analysis of users’ keywords in the summaries and 
complete articles 
The purpose of this analysis is to go deeper in the body of 
articles and search the frequencies of keywords requested by 
a user (could be scientist) in abstracts or full articles, to 
choose articles more appropriated to these keywords and 
incorporate them in his work (e.g. in the form of literature 
review). 
 
1) Analysis of users’ keywords in abstracts of IC area: An 
individual analysis of articles’ abstracts is performed.  It is 
beneficial when the user wishes select an abstract or a group 
of abstracts to read. The frequencies of users’ keywords 
when analyzing abstracts one by one, vary from an abstract 
to another and from keyword to another. For reasons of 
clarity and space, we presented a small sample most 
frequent keyword requested. For better analysis, cumulative 
frequencies of confused abstracts are presented in TABLE III.

The most frequent words are market and value. It is 
explained by the relationship between IC and the market 
value in certain methods of IC measurement (IC value = 
Market value - book value). It represents generally 4 or 5 
times the book value (value of business given by 
accountants), which explains the existence of a very 
important intrinsic value that is intellectual capital in the 
form of the know-how of the experts in business. The words 
industry and industrial are very frequent; this implies that 
IC is measured also within industrial businesses. The 
qualitative word is better ranked than quantitative one 
because of the qualitative nature of IC which is difficult to 
quantify. The managers and accountants look for a credible 
tool to measure it. VAIC, NICI, IC-dVal and WWTK are 
user requested measurement methods of IC, but do not exist 
in the sample of articles containing “intellectual capital” in 
their titles. 
 
2)  Analysis of users’ keywords in abstracts of KM area:

keywords in confused abstracts of KM.

The word data is the densest, it expresses the close 
relationship between knowledge and data [15]; the data when 
it is processed becomes information and when it is used it 
becomes knowledge. The word performance reflects that 
knowledge contributes to improve performance of a 
company [16]. The word sharing expresses the sharing of 
knowledge, reinforces the collaboration between members of 
professional team and gives better results than the individual 
tasks. This collaboration is carried out by communities of 
practice (community, communities, practice); they are 
groups of employees using knowledge in their work. The 
industry is also present in the KM (industry, manufacturing 
and industrial). The word intelligence argues the 
relationship between KM and business intelligence. It is 
involved in enriching the knowledge base. MSKM and 
MASK are two methods of knowledge management but

don’t exist in the studied sample containing only articles with 
“knowledge management” in their titles.   
3) Analysis of users’ keywords in the full articles in KM: 
We used the PDF files of articles downloaded from 
SCOPUS.  Fig. 1 shows the results when analyzing file by 
file. The red surrounded area represents the highest 
frequencies of users’ keywords. It could be useful to a 
researcher looking for a specific topic by selecting only the 
articles with high frequencies of required keyword (topic) to 
use them in their literature review. 
 
 
Figure 1. Frequencies of user keywords in PDF files individually in KM for 
2015 
 
In this individual analysis by PDF file, frequencies of 
keywords differ from one file to another. A global analysis 
would be more significant (TABLE V) when the researcher 
looks for the best area treating its topic (keyword) or to 
compare topics in the same area (IC, KM…etc).

The word system is the most frequent; it relates to 
knowledge management systems. The word context refers to 
the contextual nature of knowledge and its extraction by data 
mining. 
Network 
refers 
to 
its 
important 
role 
in 
communication and collaboration to share knowledge by the 
communities of practice.  
C. Analysis of the densest words  
It is called density of words in the abstracts, the frequency 
of any word in a text corpus, not keywords provided by a 
user or by author. This analysis complements the previous 
one, because sometimes there are important new words 
discovered by this analysis but less known by the user. It is 
an automatic extraction of the densest words. Excel files 
containing only abstracts are used. In other words, it consists 
to find frequencies of words in a corpus filtered from 
stopwords which are in English (a, an, the, then, it, he, she, 
about, etc.), commonly conjunctions, pronouns or any other 
word not affecting the meaning of a text. The set of 
stopwords exists in the literature and it is taken into account 
in certain languages as R; the used language in this work.  
 
1) Analysis of the densest  words in the abstracts  
a) 
Analysis of the densest words in the abstracts of IC: 
The means of the densest words in the IC area are calculated 
from 1995 to 2016. In all years, the word intellectual and 
capital have approximately the same appearance, the 
frequency of capital is more than intellectual (TABLE VI) 
because it exists other capitals: human capital, structural 
capital and organizational capital…etc.

the measurement models. 
b) 
Analysis of the densest words in the abstracts of 
KM: TABLE VII shows the averages of frequencies of densest 
words in KM area from 1997 to 2016. The generic words are 
same that IC ones. The word process indicates the 
knowledge management process optimization, which is 
subject to the reactivity of the knowledge system.

The word organisational is in third rank, it demonstrates 
the organizational aspect of knowledge management and the 
encouragement of organizational learning modules included 
in knowledge management systems. The word innovation is 
present as enrichment element of the knowledge system and 
the trigger of organisational learning. 
 
2) Analysis of the densest words in articles’ titles: The 
purpose of this analysis is very important, it is a decisive 
factor on the interest of a scientific article and its content. 
a) 
Analysis of the densest words in the titles of the 
articles of IC:  Fig. 2 shows the mean frequencies of the 
densest words in the titles of IC from 1998 to 2016.

Figure 2. Densest words in the titles of IC, per year 
 
It is noted that the two curves of the words capital and 
intellectual look the same on all the years since data is 
exported from SCOPUS have in their titles intellectual 
capital. The capital curve is slightly above the intellectual 
curve because there are other capitals. Their densities are 
highest in 2012 when the scientific production was highest 
for IC.

The word performance is very dense (Table VIII), 
because IC improves business performance; it is expressed 
by the words companies and firms. This performance is 
measured by performance indicator.

Analysis of the densest words in the titles of KM 
articles:  Fig. 3 shows the means frequencies of the dense 
words in titles of KM from 1997 to 2016.

The two curves of knowledge and management look the 
same on all the years since data is exported from SCOPUS 
have in their titles knowledge management. The knowledge 
curve is slightly above the curve management, contrary to 
what was found in abstracts and PDF. There are other 
treatments of knowledge (knowledge acquisition, knowledge 
sharing…etc.). Their densities are highest in 2009 when 
scientific production was the highest for KM.

3) Analysis of the densest words in the authors’ 
keywords: The first analysis performed in Section A, 
concerns the author keyword as a whole expression, but this 
analysis seeks the densest words composing this keyword.  
a) Analysis of the densest words in the authors’ 
keywords of IC:  Fig. 4 shows the frequencies’ means of the 
densest words in the authors’ keywords of IC from 1995 to 
2016.  
 
 
Figure 4. Densest words in authors’ keywords of IC, per year 
 
Over the years, the intellectual and capital curves have 
almost the same trends over time, but the capital one 
exceeds in density because there are other capitals than 
intellectual, such as financial capital and the components of 
intellectual capital.

get their keywords from the title. Common dense words 
(Table X) are performance, value, model, creation, 
indicator and involvement. 
b) 
Analysis of the densest words in the authors’ 
keywords of KM:  Fig. 5 shows the  frequencies’ means of 
the densest words in the authors’ keywords of KM from 
1998 to 2016. 
 
 
Figure 5. Densities of authors’ keywords of KM, per year 
 
In all years, the word management is less dense than the 
word knowledge, because there are other stages in KM 
process 
(e.g. 
knowledge 
transfer, 
knowledge 
capitalization…etc.).

The results of the density in the authors’ keywords are 
similar to the density in titles (TABLE XI), because in general 
the authors get their keywords from the title. Unlike IC, KM 
has no common dense words in the titles and authors’ 
keywords at least in these first rows of TABLE XI except 
information, knowledge and management. 
D. Analysis of Zipf’s law  
The analysis of Zipf’s law is different from the densest 
words analysis seen in Section C.  To apply Zipf’s law, all 
words are taken into account, including the stopwords. 
1) Analysis of Zipf’s law in IC:   A set of 655 among 1500 
full articles in IC are used to create a corpus on which Zipf’s 
law was applied. A set of 21365 different words appears in 
the corpus with different frequencies. The existing Zipf’s 
law represents the found frequencies of words and the 
theoretic Zipf’s law represents the theoretic frequency of 
word=Size of the corpus of text with stopwords (6911590 
words) divided by the rank of the word after ordering by 
descending order of existing frequencies. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Zipf’s law in IC corpus 
 
 Fig. 6 demonstrates that Zipf’s law is globally verified 
and slightly different in the middle of curve.  
 
2) Analysis of Zipf’s law in KM:   A set of 2420 among 
10000 articles in KM are used to create a corpus on which 
we applied Zipf’s law. A set of 18466 different words 
appears in the corpus with different frequencies. The 
theoretic Zipf’s law represents the theoretic frequency of 
word=Size of the corpus of text with stopwords (6470344 
words) divided by to the rank of the word after ordering by 
descending order of existing frequencies.

 Fig. 7 demonstrates that Zipf’s law applied in KM is 
globally less verified than IC and slightly different in the 
middle of curve.  
V. CONCLUSION 
In this work, scientific articles (abstracts and full articles) 
were 
quantitatively 
analyzed 
to 
draw 
qualitative 
conclusions. These articles are related to the areas of 
intellectual capital and knowledge management. Each area 
was analyzed separately and it has been found different

results especially for dense words. The densities are closely 
related to the scientific production of the area. 
Keyword analysis allows the identification of existing 
levels of meaning in scientific articles as well as the 
unexpected trends in the area. Eight programs have been 
written in R language and applied to IC and KM. The goal is 
to delve into the exported data files from SCOPUS to collect 
the authors’ keywords of scientific articles and calculate 
their frequencies. The full list of authors’ keywords in both 
areas prepares the ground for the area glossary and ontology 
design. The goal was to find the frequencies of authors’ 
keywords in the articles, keywords proposed by a user as 
needed and densest words in several items of articles (titles, 
abstracts, full files and authors’ keywords). The latter is the 
most significant; it allows discovering new concepts 
introduced in the area for enrichment of glossaries and 
ontologies which could be proposed for a research area. KM 
and IC have many common concepts as management, 
performance, model, value.   
Generally, Zipf’s law is valid in IC and KM fields for the 
database SCOPUS. Despite the fact that the sample of full 
articles in KM is larger than IC ones, the corpus of IC is 
richer in keywords. 
As perspectives, we could apply other sets of keywords 
indicators to draw other conclusions. This work prepares the 
ground for the creation of glossaries and ontologies for both 
IC and KM areas and it addresses the semantic relationships 
between keywords. 
For the representation of frequency, one would think to 
develop a tool for representing words in clouds as the 
frequency and relevance criteria specified by the user. 
For authors’ keywords, an analysis by group of words is 
possible because there are synonyms which may offer a sum 
of frequencies and one can calculate the frequency of the 
group of words. This grouping step requires a thorough 
knowledge of words and their use in the search area, and if 
we would do it automatically, this would require an 
additional effort of semantic links expressed by other 
ontologies or semantic analysis tools. The extension can be 
the logical combinations between several keywords in the 
search query. At the end, the designed programs can be 
applied to any area of research exported from SCOPUS 
database. To use them for other databases, it will be 
necessary to slightly adapt them to the shape of input data.
