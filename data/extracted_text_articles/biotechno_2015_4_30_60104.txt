Abstract— Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) are 
widely used in agriculture as an ecologically safe replacement 
of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. In this work, gene 
expression regulation under stimulation by maize root exudate 
was studied in a PGPR strain Bacillus atrophaeus UCMB-5137. 
A strong up-regulation of synthesis of (p)ppGpp (guanosine 
pentaphosphate) alarmone was observed. This alarmone is 
associated with the stringent response in bacteria, but its 
involvement in regulation of plant colonization has never been 
reported. Comparison of the profiles of gene expression at the 
classical stringent response and in the current experiment 
showed only a partial overlap that allowed us to make a 
conclusion that the tested bacteria had not been starved but 
responded specifically to the root exudate stimulation and 
(p)ppGpp alarmone is involved in this complex response. 
Comparison of the gene expression regulation in B. atrophaeus 
UCMB-5137 with a report obtained on a similar experiment 
with another PGPR strain B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 showed 
that these two closely related organisms had used different 
strategies of plant colonization. 
Keywords—Bacillus atrophaeus; plant growth promoting;

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Application of beneficial microorganisms residing in the 
rhizosphere to promote plant growth is a promising and 
efficient method of biocontrol of plant pathogens; it is safe 
for human health, other soil microorganisms and the 
environment.  Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) 
is a diverse group of microorganisms living in the plant 
rhizosphere. They exert beneficial direct or indirect effects 
on plant growth [1]. Till now, the gene regulation in PGPR 
Bacillus during root colonization was studied only in a few 
bacteria [13], and it remains unclear to which extend other 
PGPR bacteria follow the same pattern of gene regulation. 
Introduction of new generation sequencing techniques 
(NGS) made it possible to investigate gene expression 
profiles under similar experimental conditions in multiple 
taxonomically related PGPR bacteria by using the RNA-Seq 
approach. Here, we want to present our very first result in a 
planned series of experiment. Bacillus atrophaeus is one of 
PGPR able to colonize plants by forming thick colonies on 
the root surface. This study aimed at investigating the gene 
expression profile in UCMB-5137 stimulated by maize root 
exudate and compare the results to those obtained for PGPR 
B. amyloliquefaciens [13]. Understanding gene regulation 
underlying interaction between this bacteria and plants will 
broaden our understanding on how the PGPR bacteria 
belonging to Bacillus subtilis taxonomic clade can be 
effectively used to promote plant growth taking into 
consideration the commonalities and differences in gene 
regulation in these bacteria. The next section will provide 
information on the previous related researches. Then, the 
section on the methods is followed by a discussion of results 
obtained in this study and a conclusion section. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
Use of Bacilli as biocontrol agents is an advantage over 
other bacteria because they form thermostable and 
chemically resistant endospores [12]. Complete genome 
sequence of Bacillus atrophaeus UCMB-5137 showed

multiple horizontally acquired unique genes, which were 
hypothesized as possible source of an extraordinary activity 
in plant root colonization [2]. This strain has shown a 
significant potential of promoting plant 
growth in 
greenhouse trials (ongoing research). It was therefore 
interesting to study gene regulation mechanisms taking place 
as it interacts with plant. The interaction between Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens FZB42 under maize root exudate 
stimulation was studied previously using a method 
developed by Fan et al. [13]. It is demonstrated in this 
publication that the maize root exudate added to liquid 
medium may simulate plant derived signals stimulating root 
colonization behavior in PGPR bacteria. We used their 
approach except for transcriptomic profiling, where we used 
RNA-Seq. RNA-Seq is a sequence based approach, which 
has several advantages over microarray techniques including 
a broader dynamic range of expression levels [14]. Our 
expectation was that the gene expression profiles obtained by 
both methods will be comparable and it will be possible to 
identify similarities and differences in plant colonization 
strategies of these two PGPR strains. B. atrophaeus UCMB-
5137 was selected for this study because being as active 
PGPR bacterium as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42, it 
showed some alterations in root colonization behaviour, 
which will be discussed in the conclusion. 
III. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Root exudate was extracted as it was described 
previously [13]. B. atrophaeus UCMB-5137 was grown up 
on the liquid medium (1 C medium containing 0.1% glucose) 
with (experiment) and without (control) 0.25 mg/ml maize 
root exudate. RNA from two independent experiment 
samples and three control samples were extracted using ZR 
Fungal/ Bacteria RNA Mini Prep kit and sequenced by 
MiSeq 500 Illumina in Inqaba (Pretoria, South Africa). They 
were quality controlled and trimmed, and then mapped 
against the available complete genome sequence of UCMB-
5137 [2] using CLC Genomics Workbench 7. EDGE 
statistics approach was used to identify significantly up- and 
down- regulated genes (at least 3 folds difference) with a p-
value ≤ 0.01.  
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Tiny amounts of root exudate caused a significant up and 
down regulation of many genes. A remarkable up-regulation 
was observed for genes responsible for the following 
mechanisms: 
stress 
response, 
biofilm 
formation, 
transcription and translation regulation, heme synthesis, 
ribosome proteins, cell division, vitamin synthesis and 
quorum sensing. Meanwhile, down-regulation of genes 
belonging to the following functional categories: transport 
proteins, DNA replication, purines and pyrimidines 
synthesis, sporulation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis 
were observed. Remarkable, it was the complete silencing of 
multiple phage associated genes. Approximately, 70% of the 
genes regulated by root exudates were annotated with known 
functions whilst 30% were annotated as hypothetical, 
putative or unknown proteins. An overview of regulated 
genes is shown in Table 1.

One of the important observation was a strong up-
regulation of synthesis of the alarmone (p)ppGpp (guanosine 
pentaphosphate). This alarmone is known to be responsible 
for the stringent response in bacteria, usually associated with 
starvation [3]. It controls many metabolic reactions including 
inhibition of protein synthesis, DNA replication and 
transcription when bacteria experience a shortage of 
nutrients. Surprisingly, this alarmone activation was in 
response to the root exudate stimulation while the control 
bacteria did not experience any shortage of nutrients. It was 
hypothesized that the stringent response in this PGPR 
bacterium was needed to prepare the organism for root 
colonization. It was interesting to compare genes expression 
profiles under root exudate stimulation against the classical 
stringent response described by Eymann et al. [3]. One 
similarity was that the general stress response pathways were

up regulated in both cases. Another similarity was down-
regulation of the amino acid biosynthesis, DNA replication, 
thiamine biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis and nucleotide 
biosynthesis metabolic pathways. Silencing of phage-related 
genes was also reported in both cases. However, a number of 
discordances were also observed. Pathways of cell wall 
biosynthesis, 
ribosome 
proteins, 
protein 
translation, 
maturation, activation and utilization were negatively 
controlled by stringent response, but they were up-regulated 
in this study. Contrary, cross-membrane transportation, urea 
degradation and preparation for sporulation were up-
regulated by the stringent response but down-regulated by 
the root exudate.  
Stress related proteins were up-regulated by maize root 
exudates. A stress state in bacteria was defined by Lengeler 
et al. [4] as any change in the environment that provokes a 
significant change in cell physiology. Up-regulated stress 
related proteins included heat stress induced protein, 
manganese superoxide dismutase, organic hydroperoxide 
resistance reductase B, alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, cold 
shock protein CspA and  integral membrane protein YggT 
responding to heat, oxidative, cold and osmotic stresses 
respectively. Bacteria may produce multiple stress resistance 
proteins to anticipate for future stress [5]. Some of these 
stress resistance proteins are detoxifying enzymes, e.g., 
superoxide dismutase and thiol peroxidase, which are used to 
neutralize oxidative burst from plants [6]. 
Transcriptional regulators mediate bacteria adaptive 
responses to continuous changes in their environment [7]. In 
this study, many transcriptional regulators responsible for 
variety of responses were up regulated. Among them there 
were SinR regulator and transition state regulatory protein 
AbrB, which regulate post exponential phase responses 
(competence, sporulation and biofilm formation); transport 
and uptake regulators Fur (iron uptake) and Zur (zinc 
uptake); peroxide stress regulator PerR; thiol specific 
oxidative response regulator Spx; and RsbR positive 
regulator of sigma-B. Sigma-B is a general stress 
transcription top level regulator, which is activated when 
bacteria is exposed to environmental stresses.  
Remarkably, most of carbohydrate, amino and fatty acid 
biosynthesis and degradation metabolic pathways were down 
regulated by the root exudate. This might be connected to the 
observed up-regulation of the GntR family transcriptional 
regulator, which represses the general metabolism. 
Communication within and between bacterial occur 
through autoinducers, among which the most studied are 
quorum sensing autoinducers [8]. Bacteria use quorum 
sensing to control their cell population density and sense 
metabolic potential of the environment [4]. Up regulation of 
luxS gene, which is involved in synthesis of autoinducer 2 
(AI-2), was observed. AI-2 is used for interspecies cell-to-
cell communication. Up-regulation of luxS may be important 
to enable communication between bacteria cells and plant 
cells during root colonization and biofilm formation. Biofilm 
is an extracellular matrix produced by complex aggregate of 
cells that adhere to each other [9]. Bacteria produce biofilm 
to attach and maintain contact with the host plant during 
bacteria-plant interaction [10]. It was observed in previous 
research that B. atrophaeus UCMB-5137 colonize plants by 
forming biofilm on the root surface. Up-regulation of Veg 
protein, which stimulates biofilm formation [9] and YMCA 
protein, – a master regulator for biofilm formation, – is in 
agreement to this observation. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Even though (p)ppGpp was up regulated and some 
pathways might have been controlled by the stringent 
response, we concluded that the bacteria have not been 
starved in our experiment and the gene transcription was 
regulated by several other signalling pathways. Anyway, the 
involvement of (p)ppGpp alarmone regulation in plant root 
colonization have never been reported before including the 
recently published paper on gene expression regulation by 
root exudate in a PGPR strain B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 
[11]. 
In 
general, 
the 
gene 
expression 
profile 
in 
B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 was quite different to that in 
B. atrophaeus UCMB-5137 with strong up-regulation of 
motility proteins and antibiotic biosynthesis. Also, dissimilar 
was the pattern of root colonization observed by luminescent 
microscopy (Figure 1).  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Colonization of barley roots by B. atrophaeus UCMB-5137 (A 
and B) and by B. amyloliquefaciens UCMB-5113 (C and D). 
B. atrophaeus had formed thick colonies on the root 
surface, while B. amyloliquefaciens had been characterized 
by active penetration into plant tissues and an endophytic 
growth [12]. This difference in behavioural strategies may 
explain the observed striking differences in the root exudate 
stimulated gene expression profiles in these two relative 
PGPR bacteria. In the future, we want to repeat this 
experiment with a number of selected PGPR Bacillus, 
belonging to closely relates species B. amyloliquefaciens, 
B. subtilis and B. mojavensis, which have been sequenced 
recently (see NCBI bio-projects with the reference numbers: 
176685, 176687, 176696, 176688, 176703 and 176701).
