Abstract—This paper builds on existing Goal Oriented 
Requirements Engineering (GORE) research by presenting a 
methodology with a supporting tool for analysing and 
demonstrating the alignment between software requirements 
and business objectives. Current GORE methodologies can be 
used to relate business goals to software goals through goal 
abstraction in goal graphs. However, we argue that unless the 
extent of goal-goal contribution is quantified with verifiable 
metrics and confidence levels, goal graphs are not sufficient for 
demonstrating 
the 
strategic 
alignment 
of 
software 
requirements. We introduce our methodology using an 
example software project from Rolls-Royce. We conclude that 
our methodology can improve requirements by making the 
relationships 
to 
business 
problems 
explicit, 
thereby 
disambiguating a requirement’s underlying purpose and value. 
Keywords—Requirements Engineering; Strategic Alignment; 
Quantified Goal Graphs; Requirements Traceability 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The stakeholders of a software project should share an 
understanding of the potential business benefit that a 
software requirement offers. If such an understanding can be 
achieved, the likelihood that a solution will satisfy a real 
business problem will be improved. Although such 
statements may sound obvious, it has been reported that 45% 
of software requirements are never deemed to be useful after 
implementation [1]. These unnecessary requirements cause 
costs and delays that perhaps could have been avoided by 
benefit analysis. The existence of a requirement should be 
questioned if it does not demonstrate potential to offer value 
to the business.  Conversely, valuable requirements are at 
risk of being de-prioritised if they fail to demonstrate their 
potential benefit. In an organisational setting, business 
benefit can be gained from an alignment to business strategy. 
Technically worded requirements or solution oriented 
requirements (i.e., specified for the machine rather than for 
the world [2]) hide the business problem to be solved and 
leave stakeholders with little understanding of the potential 
value. It is therefore important that the strategic alignment of 
such a requirement is explored in order to avoid wastage. 
This paper explores the suitability of goal graphs for 
demonstrating a software requirement’s strategic alignment. 
Current Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) 
standards, such as GRL [3], do not quantify the contribution 
one goal makes to another using metrics from the application 
domain, opting instead to use scales such as high, medium 
and low, or numerical scales such as 0-9. As a result, any 
strategic alignment proposed by the use of goal graphs is not 
specific, measurable or testable. Proposed extensions by Van 
Lamsweerde [4] do not consider that a chain of linked goals 
may contain a variety of metrics that need to be translated in 
order to demonstrate strategic alignment. Additionally, the 
current methods do not consider how the contribution score 
is calculated and how that affects the credibility and 
accuracy of the proposed benefits. This paper attempts to 
demonstrate how the above problems can be addressed, 
thereby allowing goal graphs to be used to analyse the 
strategic 
alignment 
of 
software 
requirements. 
Our 
methodology complements frameworks that require business 
value analysis, such as value-based software engineering [5], 
by making assumptions about business value explicit. 
We have developed and implemented our methodology 
in partnership with an industrial partner (Rolls-Royce) to 
ensure its utility in real world settings. We use examples in 
the context of a software project to be implemented in the 
Transmissions Structures & Drives (TS&D) Supply Chain 
Unit (SCU). The software will automate geometry design 
and analysis for aero engine components, as well as for their 
manufacturing tools such as casting molds. Simply put, 
engineers will input the desired design parameters and the 
software will output the component’s geometry. 
In Section II, we introduce the problem that this paper 
addresses, while in Section III, we present and evaluate the 
extent to which existing solutions address it. Section IV 
presents our methodology and tool as an extension of an 
existing GORE methodology in order to address the gaps 
outlined in Section III. We conclude in Section V with 
remarks on the paper’s contributions and future work. 
II. THE PROBLEM 
Ross and Schoman stated that software requirements 
“must say why a system is needed, based on current or 
foreseen conditions” as well as “what system features will 
serve and satisfy this context” [6]. Popular Requirements 
Engineering meta models [7], [8] and templates [9], [10] 
tend not to focus on  “why”, typically addressing it by 
stipulating that rationale be attached to a requirement. 
However, rationale is not always an adequate description of 
why the requirement is valuable to the business. If only one 
“why” question is asked about the requirement then the 
rationale can still be distant from the true problem to be 
solved (i.e., the essence of the requirement), and it may be 
defined without consideration of its wider implications.  
As an example of the problem that this paper examines, 
we introduce the following high-level requirement taken 
from our example software project: “While operating in an

are of the “AND” type, since both objectives (4 & 5) are 
required if objective (6) is to be satisfied. 
Table 1 shows a sample of the quantifications that 
complement the diagram. They have been separated out of 
the goal graph due to space constraints, but ordinarily would 
be annotated on the edges (connecting links) of the graph.

The quantified contributions in Table 1 tell us that 
objective (4) will be satisfied if requirement (1) is satisfied, 
since objective (4)’s required magnitude of satisfaction 
(80%) will be contributed by link (C) (80%). It is important 
to note that where percentages are used as contribution 
weights on links, this does not infer that a certain percentage 
of the objective’s magnitude will be achieved (in this case, 
80% of 80%). Instead, the focus of the objective (e.g., 
geometry creation time) will be affected by that percentage 
in the context of the activity (e.g., a reduction by 80%). 
Objective (4) is then abstracted until the benefits are 
expressed in terms of high-level business objectives, which 
disambiguates estimated business value by placing the 
quantifications into context (i.e., a large saving from a small 
cost may be less than a small saving from a large cost). 
Confidence levels allow users to represent how sure they 
are that achieving the first objective (or requirement) affects 
the second objective by at least the specified contribution.  
TABLE 2: CONFIDENCE LEVEL ENUMERATIONS 
Confidence 
Description 
0.25 
Poor credibility, no supporting evidence or 
calculations, high doubt about capability
0.5 
Average credibility, no evidence but reliable 
calculations, some doubt about capability
0.75 
Great credibility, reliable secondary sources of 
evidence, small doubt about capability
1 
Perfect credibility, multiple primary sources of 
evidence, no doubt about capability
 
The confidence level concept is similar to that used by 
Gilb for impact estimation [23], so we base our confidence 
levels on a similar scale in Table 2. Basic confidence 
adjustment can be performed by multiplying contributions by 
their associated confidence level so that users are reminded 
of the impact confidence has on estimations. For example, 
when confidence levels are taken into consideration in Table 
1, the satisfaction of requirement (1) still leads to the full 
satisfaction of objective (4). However, when confidence 
levels are considered for links (E & F), the satisfaction of 
objective (6) is in doubt, since (20*1) + (13*0.75) is less 
than the 33% required by the objective’s magnitude attribute. 
Additional confidence levels can be applied to the user’s 
estimations to represent how qualified that user is at 
providing estimations. For example, someone who has 
implemented similar systems should be able to provide more 
accurate estimations than someone who has not. The 
accuracy of previous estimates made by that person could 
also be considered in order to improve the reliability of the 
estimations (i.e., calibration of the confidence levels). 
By traversing the quantified GRL goal graphs, the 
business value of a requirement can be calculated by the 
contribution it makes to business objectives. This calculation 
can be automated by using a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., 
depth-first search) to calculate how much a given 
requirement contributes to a business objective. This 
calculation could then be used to improve the outcome of 
requirements prioritisation methods such as the Analytics 
Hierarchy Process [27], since such pairwise methods depend 
on the practitioners understanding of a requirement’s value. 
It is important to note that software engineers and 
business analysts may not know the objectives (or the goals 
and visions, for that matter) at different levels of the business 
(i.e., the project, the business unit, the department, the 
overall business, etc.). Therefore, managers should work 
with stakeholders to define the business objectives before the 
requirements can be abstracted toward them. Indeed, it is 
likely that some software requirements will be abstracted 
toward business objectives that were not previously elicited. 
Where typical goal abstraction (asking “why?”) would 
allow a non-specific goal such as “improve the engine”, this 
method requires the user to be specific in how the engine is 
to be improved by asking for the metric that will be affected, 
e.g., “component lifespan” from objective (12) in Figure 3. 
Users may resist quantifying benefits of requirements, 
especially for non-functional requirements where the subject 
may be intangible, however, Gilb has found that it has 
always been possible to do so in his experience (e.g., by 
polling customers to quantify customer satisfaction) and has 
provided guidance on doing so in [23]. Even if the 
magnitude cannot be elicited at first, providing a scale by 
which the objective’s success will be measured improves the 
definition of the objective by reducing ambiguity. 
We suggest that this methodology should be performed 
after the high-level requirements have been elicited, so that 
resources are not wasted eliciting lower level requirements 
that do not align well to business strategy. 
Tool support (GoalViz) has been developed (free to 
download at [28]) to support the methodology through:  
 
Input support for the requirement and objective 
templates with prompt question generation. 
 
Automatic diagram drawing to focus the user on the 
methodology and data rather than the graph layout. 
 
Automatic evaluation and summarisation of chains 
of links to enable efficient understanding. 
 
Project libraries to facilitate learning about the 
estimated contributions made in previous projects to 
improve future quantification confidence levels.

 
What-if analysis allowing comparison of outcomes 
for different inputs where there is some uncertainty. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper’s unique contribution is twofold. First, we 
have shown how quantified goal graphs can be used to 
visualise the alignment of software requirements to business 
objectives. We have shown that in order to demonstrate 
strategic alignment, a chain of objectives may contain 
different measurement scales, and, since strategic alignment 
is based on estimated benefit, confidence in the estimations 
should be made explicit. Secondly, we have shown how goal 
link contribution scores can be made testable by specifying 
them in terms of the estimated effect they will have on the 
parent goal’s measurement scale. Our methodology not only 
facilitates disambiguation of a requirement’s business value, 
but more importantly, it requires that the needs of the 
business (i.e., business objectives) are related to requirements 
to ensure that the software can add value to the business. 
Since the requirements are abstracted to several levels of 
objectives, the problem to be solved will have been defined 
even if the requirement was originally solution oriented. 
Future work will evaluate this approach against the 
related work detailed in Section III within different industrial 
settings to examine its benefit in a range of domains. We also 
intend to evaluate integration with SysML [8] to improve 
traceability to the design that will realise the requirements.
