Abstract – In most Western countries, there is substantial 
growth in inter-organizational cooperation in design and 
delivery of health services based on Internet technology. 
However, there is a gap in the literature describing these 
efforts, and future research as well as practice can 
benefit from more elaborate theoretical models to 
understand this phenomenon. In order to close this gap, 
this study reviews the literature on Business Process 
Management in an inter-organizational context with a 
special focus on factors that can explain the success of 
process development in inter-organizational contexts. 
The review identifies several critical success factors that 
may be important as a starting point for future research 
in eHealth.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Integrated processes using eHealth technology in inter-
organizational collaborations are needed to accommodate 
future increasing demands and provide better utilization of 
scarce specialized-care resources and preventive medicine 
and care. Such collaboration is not without challenges.  
For example, in Norway a new legislation has been 
passed to ensure close collaboration between hospitals and 
municipalities, with a strong incentive for more inter-
municipal and public-private collaboration (the Norwegian 
Collaboration reform ‘Samhandlingsreformen’, passed as 
law no. 30, June 24, 2011).  
Such calls for action often entail a need for process 
collaboration and integration at an inter-organizational level. 
What factors determine success or failure of such 
collaborations? 
The purpose of this paper is to study whether literature on 
Collaborative Business Process Management (CBPM) in an 
inter-organizational context may inform researchers and 
practitioners on existing gaps in our knowledge of the 
sociotechnical 
factors 
critically 
impacting 
inter-
organizational CBPM success, with consequences for 
eHealth process integration. 
We looked at Business Process Management (BPM) as a 
management strategy [11], supported by more or less 
integrated tools, ranging from Business Process Modelling 
Notation as an illustration of ‘AS-IS’ and ‘TO-BE’ 
scenarios, to BPM systems with full workflow integration 
using service-oriented architecture. BPM has evolved as a 
synthesis of business process reengineering involving an all-
or-nothing redesign of business processes, and total quality 
management 
[13] 
with 
emphasis 
on 
continuous 
improvement, customer orientation, employee involvement, 
and other benefits [7, 17]. The BPM subfield of CBPM is 
defined here as coordinated initiatives that involve actors 
from inside or outside of an organization, as opposed to 
non-collaborative BPM, where individuals conduct non-
coordinated efforts to alter business processes [14].  
Despite growing interest in the subject, there is a gap in 
the literature as to the importance of context for successful 
CBPM (Niehaves et al. 2012; ref. Appendix; J15), including 
inter-organizational contexts where BPM is coordinated 
between two or more corporations as separate legal entities. 
EHealth can be defined as the application of the Internet and 
other related technologies to improve the access, efficiency, 
effectiveness, and quality of clinical and business processes 
utilized by healthcare organizations, practitioners, patients, 
and consumers [9]. This definition is not exhaustive, as 
eHealth also entails IT-supported measures to promote good 
health in the general population. 
Understanding and succeeding with CBPM in inter-
organizational contexts, such as the health sector, represents 
an increasing relational challenge for many organizations 
and is thus particularly difficult [15]. Issues may arise due to 
politics [6], culture [19], or factors related to ‘people’ [8] 
and the ‘soft side’ of organizations [12], which are even 
more elusive or blurry concepts in an inter-organizational 
context.  
The paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we 
describe the methods chosen for the literature review in 
addressing our research questions. Then, we present the 
results for each research question before we end with a 
discussion and conclusion regarding the status of the 
research on CBPM and implications for further research in 
eHealth. 
II. 
METHOD 
First, we looked for existing literature reviews on BPM 
research; specifically, we looked for overviews of critical 
success factors for CBPM. We found literature reviews 
summing up intra-organizational factors, collaboration 
using external consulting resources, culture factors, and 
general feasibility studies. We did not find any literature

reviews summing up inter-organizational CBPM critical 
success factors. We addressed this gap by performing our 
own review of the information system (IS) literature.  
This research addressed the following questions:  
RQ1: Is successful inter-organizational CBPM perceived 
differently in eHealth than in current research? Here we 
want to know how current research has assessed success in 
terms of the value that is generated from CBPM.  
RQ2: Is the success rate of inter-organizational CBPM 
reported differently in eHealth than in current research? 
RQ3: Are the factors that influence successful inter-
organizational CBPM in general also identified in the 
eHealth context?  
    We adopted the guidelines of a systematic literature 
review suggested by Webster and Watson [20], von Brocke 
et al. [18], and Okoli and Schabram [16]. In screening and 
collecting data from the articles, we adopted the guidelines 
suggested by Kitchenham et al. [10]. 
   The process of identifying the literature was organized in 
three steps. The first step involved ten database searches in 
several databases (Scopus, IEEE, Emerald, ISI Web of 
knowledge, 
and 
others) 
using 
the 
search 
words 
‘collaborative business process management’, ‘BPM’, and 
‘inter-organizational’. We used different truncations of these 
terms and in different combinations: for example, ‘business 
process’, ‘management’, ‘collabo*’ OR ‘coop*’, or ‘inter 
org’. We also did special searches on IS sources with a 
special focus on BPM, including journals like Business 
Process 
Management 
Journal 
and 
Journal of Enterprise Information Management. We also 
did a special search for ‘BPM’ in the proceedings of the 
Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 
(HICSS).  
   We only included articles in English and that were 
published after 2004. Our last search was performed on 30 
June 2013. This step returned 5.361 titles. However, a 
screening of the found articles showed that the majority of 
the articles were irrelevant to our research questions. We 
excluded articles that did not describe inter-organizational 
process collaboration or success perspectives or factors, e.g., 
articles focusing solely on technical feasibility. This 
screening of articles thus resulted in 47 relevant articles. 
This led to the third and final step in our search process. We 
combined forward and backward searches for articles either 
cited by or citing the previously identified articles, as 
recommended by Webster and Watson [20]. In this last step, 
we also included articles from before 2005. This step led us 
to three additional articles, for a total of 50 (see Appendix). 
Eleven of these 50 articles reported studies from an eHealth 
context (Appendix; J1, J3, J5, J7, J11, J12, J15, J28, C8, C9, 
and C16). 
   Our search criteria may have omitted articles that focused 
on inter-organizational CBPM but used other terms. In 
screening the articles, we may also have omitted articles that 
should have been included.  
III. 
RESULTS 
   In this section, we present the findings from our review of 
the literature according to the three research questions 
outlined above.  
A. How is success assessed in CBPM research? 
   CBPM is often believed to add substantial value to 
organizations [15]. Still, the concept of value or successful 
CBPM is multi-faceted and often implicit in most studies. 
As a result, we wanted to identify the perspectives used to 
describe CBPM success in the identified literature. Table 1 
shows that CBPM success involves many dimensions, from 
efficiency of project teams and processes, to effectiveness in 
goal achievement and quality of work practices involving 
production of design, products, and services. Success is also 
understood in some articles as the satisfaction of 
stakeholders involved in the collaborative processes. For 
example, in a healthcare context, doctors, patients, and their 
relatives are examples of important stakeholders in 
interpreting success.

to be a gap in the inter-organizational CBPM eHealth 
literature concerning the use of important performance 
indicators of satisfaction (job effectiveness, information 
system 
quality, 
achieving 
legitimacy 
through 
standardization), effectiveness (improved work practices, 
improved user interface, IT innovation), competitiveness 
(market share, profitability, growth, return on investment, 
cost leadership), active user participation, customer 
responsiveness, 
products 
and 
services 
innovation 
(complementarity, lock-in), and (organizational) political 
benefits.  
B. Success rates in the eHealth studies compared to other 
contexts 
   Our review shows that the literature reports a lower rate of 
success for inter-organizational CBPM in eHealth than in 
other sectors. Of the 11 articles on eHealth contexts, three 
articles (27%) described successes, while three articles 
(27%) described full or partial failures. In five of the 11 
eHealth articles (45%) this classification was not applicable.  
   Three articles combine eHealth and other contexts. A total 
of 42 articles reported on other contexts. Of these, 18 
articles (43%) described successful outcomes. Eleven 
articles (26%) described full or partial failures, and in 13 
articles (31%) this classification was not applicable. 
   From the studies, we cannot conclude whether eHealth has 
a lower success rate in inter-organizational CBPM projects, 
or that this level of success is not reported. This may be an 
indication of gaps in our knowledge on inter-organizational 
CBPM in eHealth. 
C. What critical success factors are identified in inter-
organizational CBPM research? 
   We define critical success factors in the context of CBPM 
(following Butler and Fitzgerald [3] and Eid et al. [4]) as the 
areas or functions where things must go right to ensure 
successful performance of the Collaborative Business 
Process Management efforts. These areas or functions 
represent barriers or drivers that need managerial attention 
to ensure that CBPM achieves the projected benefits. In 49 
of the 50 articles we identified critical success factors 
(CSFs), or what could be inferred as CSFs from the 
narratives, related to CBPM cases or other studies. We 
organized the list of identified CSFs by the level of analysis 
of the studies and by the phase of development they reflect 
in the collaborative BPM projects. The level of analysis 
ranges from the inter-organizational or network level to the 
intra-organizational level. Three phases in the life-cycle of 
CBPM can be identified, following the same pattern as in 
the work of Blut et al. [2]: phase one, initiation and 
development; phase two, implementation and early 
maturation; and phase three, late maturation and renewal or 
termination. One final group includes studies of critical 
success factors that did not fit into this framework of phases.

   The CSFs found are synthesized into concepts following 
Webster and Watson’s recommendation [20], and numbered 
for later reference. We identified 36 different concepts 
reflecting critical success factors for CBPM. These factors 
can describe different activities depending on the phases of 
the collaboration life cycle they represent.  
   Looking at an inter-organizational unit of analysis, 
successful management style (CSF #1) changes from highly 
adaptive in early phases (J17, J21) to less adaptive and more 
determined closer to implementation (J21), with the 
exception of one study (C8), which also includes adaptive 
management style in a later phase. Process maturity (#2) is 
important throughout the first phases, but emphasis changes 
over the phases from collaboration maturity to technological 
maturity, including the capability to use CBPM tools. 
Partner knowledge (#3) is important for the outcome on a 
business network level. New joint processes, IT solutions, 
and inter-organizational standards must be scalable (#4) and 
simple (#5).

   One study (J27) stresses the importance of governance and 
measurement systems for the collaborative network (#6). 
Another study claims that it is important that the owners of 
the e-business ‘hubs’ do not profit at the participants’ 
expense (finance sector; J11).  
   On the individual participating organization level, benefit 
management (#7) seems important. Participants must have a 
clear idea of what benefits to expect, how to realize them, 
and how to measure them. Co-opetition in terms of 
simultaneous cooperation and competition (#8) must be 
managed throughout the collaboration lifecycle, or benefits 
may be lost. 
   Democratization of decision-making and the development 
of a common vision (#9) are important in the earliest phases 
of collaboration. Diffusion of collaboration (#10) offers 
participating organizations additional market and innovation 
channels, and helps to overcome resource scarcity.  
   Joint community learning is also identified as a positive 
side effect of this diffusion. Some studies (C5, C17) found 
that prior experience with collaboration and experience with 
performance during the implementation phase (#11) 
explained success on an organizational level.  
   Cost reduction (finance; #12) is important. In the 
implementation phase the financial status of partners may 
also explain success or failure (J15). Good governance of 
projects, contracts, and IT are identified as a CSF (#13). 
One paper (J4) argues for a service broker function for 
better governance (in the context of implementing cloud 
computing services; J4). Information and knowledge sharing 
across functions (#14) are dominant factors, especially in 
the early phases of collaboration (J27, J28, C12, C20). One 
study from the health-care sector explores the importance of 
information handoff processes for patient safety. User 
involvement (#15) is a dominant factor in both the 
development (J17, J28, C3) and implementation phases (J3, 
J24). Resources (competence, capacity, capabilities; #16) 
are needed for change management, and training employees 
in new practices. Support (#18) must be provided for the 
innovation and collaboration processes. Many studies 
emphasize the need for transparency (#19) in process design 
and technological solutions. 
   User accessibility plays a great role in e-government 
solutions (#20). The need for coherent public policies is also 
apparent in e-government standards development (C4; #21). 
Within supply chains it is suggested that collaborative 
solutions (using the Internet) should have a consistent 
strategy and focus on value creation, not just cost reduction 
(J6; #22). Other special critical success factors found in 
some studies are continuity (in use of collaborative tools; # 
23), contract clarity (#24), and management of cultural 
differences (#25). Decision promptness is identified by 
some studies (J17, J27, J28, C17; #26), but seems to 
contradict other studies (e.g. J21) that emphasize adaptive 
management and democratization. Equality of participants is 
found to be a factor in some business networks (J11, J27; 
#27). Legitimacy of the change process in the eyes of the 
organization’s constituents is found to be of importance, 
especially in public administration (J12, C15, C17; #28). 
Organizational size is also identified as a success factor in 
public sector CBPM projects (J15; #29), with smaller 
organizations more eager to collaborate with others. 
Concentrating the portfolio of partner relationships is 
identified as a success factor in some chemical and 
mechanical industries (J18; #30). Organizational size and 
portfolio concentration may arguably be related to the 
resource concept (#17) as a success factor. Relationship 
quality (#31) involves external partners in business process 
outsourcing (J8) and process collaborations in industries 
(J18). Responsibility (commitment to change process 
objectives; #32) is identified as a success factor by a panel 
of BPM experts (J24). Standardization can in some 
instances be a barrier for performance. Transparency (#19) 
is important, but premature standardization that conflicts 
with actual workflows has in one case proven to be 
detrimental to collaborative performance in healthcare (J7), 
so an adaptive standardization process is a success factor 
(#33). A stepwise implementation of new processes can be 
one way to avoid issues (J1; #35). Developing a common 
terminology stimulates CBPM in processes characterized by 
high quality and intensity, such as in healthcare (J5; #36). 
   We found some CSFs that seem to be of potential 
significance in eHealth: 
 
Decision promptness (#26): Prompt actions when issues 
were raised in an implementation project, taking feedback 
seriously, and solving issues before further rollout of new 
solutions were significant factors in a physician order entry 
system and in patient health record systems (J28). 
 
Equality of participants (#27): 
Power 
balances 
in 
partnerships are necessary to attract participants, as reported 
by case studies in the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) 
(J11). 
 
Legitimacy (#28): Legitimacy of initiatives (in the eyes of 
stakeholders) is necessary for successful e-government 
initiatives and in the adoption of Service Oriented 
Architecture (SOA) and information infrastructure for 
governmental services (C15, C17), and is a prerequisite for 
implementing welfare technologies for assisted living at 
home for elderly and chronically ill patients [42; p. 90]. 
 
Organizational size (#29): Smaller organizations, such as 
smaller municipalities, may have restricted opportunities for 
sourcing new services internally and are more dependent on 
external sourcing and collaboration (J15). In Norway, as in 
other countries with a geographically scattered population, 
ideal municipality size is debated. The assumption is that 
bigger municipalities may provide better services, but 
smaller organizational size can make collaboration less 
complex and easier to manage and may be a positive driving

force for CBPM. This might result in a higher success rate 
of CBPM in small municipalities. 
 
Flexible/mature 
standards 
(#33) 
and 
a 
stepwise 
implementation (#34): Kauffman and Tsai (J7) cite a case 
study 
in 
Norwegian 
hospitals 
where 
a 
premature 
standardization project (electronic patient record) had 
negative effects on organizational performance and care 
practices. The proposed new standards did not fit the 
information system environment and did not capture the 
needs of the work processes, resulting in more fragmented 
patient records. Albani and Dietz (J1), using examples from 
healthcare, argue for a stepwise implementation, where 
experiences are gradually taken into consideration when 
going from local to global coordination. They call this the 
‘choreography of business processes’. 
   On the other hand, many inter-organizational non-eHealth 
CBPM critical success factors are missing in the eHealth 
context (Table 2; CSF# 3-5, 7, 10-11, 21-25, 30-32, and 35). 
We cannot conclude whether awareness of some factors is 
irrelevant to eHealth or simply not reported. This gap 
indicates that further research is needed. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
   In general, studies from the public sector are more often 
concerned with satisfaction of involved stakeholders and 
quality of services and less concerned with efficiency and 
competitiveness. As McNulty (J12) reports, an emerging 
process perspective on eHealth, with its emphasis on value 
creation, 
will 
challenge 
deeply 
rooted 
functional 
perspectives that emphasize control. 
   Most 
studies 
have 
adopted 
a 
perspective 
where 
collaboration in the inter-organizational context of BPM is 
seen as largely free from competition and conflict. Five 
notable exceptions study competition as a barrier to 
collaboration (J2, J9, J12, C2, C17). Organizations also 
compete in the public sector; for example, municipalities 
and institutions compete for positions, location of shared 
functions, and funding resources. Competition as a barrier 
may extend from an individual level to become an inter-
organizational challenge. These barriers can become a major 
problem for society. 
   In the cases described, some critical success factors seem 
to be particularly context-dependent (CSF # 6, and 20-36 in 
table 
2). 
Further 
studies 
should 
investigate 
their 
generalizability. More research is needed to understand 
critical success factors across different sectors and phases of 
collaboration, and to create a more holistic understanding of 
inter-organizational CBPM.  
   As we have shown, there are gaps and inconsistencies in 
success factors within eHealth. For example, intra-
organizational governance is also important in the eHealth 
sector, but there is limited information on what performance 
measures or perspectives of success such governance 
initiatives should focus on. This corresponds also with some 
of the lacking critical success factors, for instance the 
benefits concepts and relates to the success rate of eHealth 
research in general. These gaps suggest a need further 
research. We believe that researchers of CBPM in eHealth 
can benefit from critical success factors identified in other 
contexts and can use them as a basis for conceptualization 
and empirical testing in an eHealth context.  
   The eHealth sector in particular poses special challenges 
for both decision-makers and lawmakers. A coherent 
roadmap for successful implementation of complex eHealth 
inter-organizational CBPM initiatives will require attention 
to multiple factors; thus far, we only have scattered case 
studies on which to build our understanding of these factors. 
   Our review identified a wide variety of theoretical 
approaches used to date. A unified theoretical framework 
could stimulate further development in the field. An 
interesting starting point for this integration could be studies 
of value creation in e-business models (Amit and Zott [1]) 
that are inter-organizational and process-focused [5], 
covering many challenges similar to those in inter-
organizational CBPM. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
   There 
are 
gaps 
in 
our 
understanding 
of 
inter-
organizational process collaboration in eHealth. Many 
critical success factors and perspectives reported in other 
contexts are missing in the eHealth context but could prove 
important in the field of eHealth. The reported success rate 
of CBPM in an eHealth context seems to be lower than in 
other contexts, but the sample size of eHealth-related studies 
is too small to allow for any decisive conclusions. Some 
critical success factors must be given special consideration 
in an eHealth context. Are we missing pieces of the puzzle 
for successful inter-organizational CBPM implementation in 
eHealth? 
   Further research is needed on the content, relevance, and 
impact 
of 
sociotechnical 
factors 
like 
co-opetition 
management (ref. Appendix; J2, J9, and J12), as the 
successful balance between simultaneous cooperation, or 
collaboration, to achieve coherent patient treatment, and 
competition for positions, resources, and funding. Further 
research is also needed on the relative weight of the 
different factors over different phases of collaboration.  
   This research will inform further eHealth research and 
successful eHealth initiative implementation, and will be of 
use to lawmakers and regulators.
