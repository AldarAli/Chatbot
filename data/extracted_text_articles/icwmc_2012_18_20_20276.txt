Abstract—Relay assisted OFDMA networks are promising
solutions for provision of high-data-rate services in wide
coverage areas. However, the deployment of relays makes
the resource allocation a more challenging and complex task.
In this paper we study dynamic allocation of power and
subchannels in an OFDMA downlink system with regenerative
relays which have the capability of buffering the users’ data
to transmit in a suitable time. We model the network as a
multicell scenario with small serving areas and provide a novel
framework for resource allocation, in which each of the relays
and Base Station (BS) allocate resources based on the queue
and channel state information of their own users. We propose
a dynamic distributed resource allocation algorithm for this
purpose, where BS and relays decide about the allocation of the
power and subchannels by passing messages among themselves
and based on the local queue and channel state information.
Simulation results show signiﬁcant improvement in terms of
system throughput and users’ queue stability.

composition; distributed resource allocation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
is a promising solution for multiple access in high speed
wireless networks such as IEEE 802.16 Worldwide Interop-
erability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and Long Term
Evolution (LTE). Based on this technique, it is possible
to provide high spectaral efﬁciency, multiuser diversity,
robustness against multipath fading and ﬂexibility in radio
resource allocation. However to make it possible for all the
users in a large area to get access to the network, wide
coverage is another important objective for next generation
of mobile networks. For this purpose, wireless relays have
gained signiﬁcant attention in both industry and research
bodies, due to their cost effective and fast deployments.
Relays can improve the transmission link between Base
Station (BS) and users which are far from BS or have
blockage between BS and themselves.
Resource allocation and scheduling are important issues
in wireless networks due to increasing demand of users for
data trafﬁc and the scarcity of radio resources [1]. It becomes
even more challenging and crucial in relay assisted OFDMA
networks[2]. Recently there has been remarkable work done
in this ﬁeld [3][4][5][6]. In [3], authors studied the capac-
ity of relay assisted OFDMA networks for both amplify-
and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) schemes.
Adaptive scheduling algorithms have been studied in [4] and,
based on a Time Division Duplexing (TDD) frame structure,
Greedy Polling (GP) and Partial Proportional Fair (PPF)
algorithms have been proposed. In [5] authors assumed that
the frequency band is partitioned between users connected
directly to BS and users connected through relays. They
studied the cross layer scheduling for the relayed users in
an AF relay network, as an optimization problem with the
objective of maximizing the received goodput and proposed
a distributed algorithm for it. Most of the works in this
area use two common assumptions. First one is that users
have inﬁnitely backlogged buffers in BS, meaning that they
always have data to transmit; However in realistic scenarios,
this assumption is not true and users have random and bursty
trafﬁc arrival of packets which feed users’ buffers in BS.
Therefore the channel aware scheduling without considering
the availability of data, would lead into inefﬁcient use of
resources. The other common assumption is that relays are
“prompt” and the relaying is performed in two consecutive
transmission epochs [4]. In other words, time slots are
assumed to be divided into two subslots where in the ﬁrst
one, BS transmits to the relays and in the second one, they
forward the received data to their users. However having
relays with the capability of buffering data and forwarding
them in a later time, can provide more ﬂexibility for Radio
Resource Management (RRM) as it is possible to keep a
user’s data in the queue and forward it in a suitable time
slot, i.e., when the user’s channel gets better or the user gets
higher priority. Such a system has been considered in [6],
and based on that authors have studied the joint routing and
subchannel allocation in a relay assisted OFDMA cellular
network. They have considered concurrent transmission for
relays where a relay can receive data on some subchannels
and at the same time transmit on some others. Assuming
equal power allocation and equal number of frequency
subchannels being used by either of BS and any of the relays,
a centralized algorithm has been proposed. However optimal
power allocation is another important factor for efﬁcient
utilization of the system resources and providing Quality
of Service (QoS) for users in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER)
and queue stability [7][8].
In this paper, we consider a relay assissted OFDMA
network with buffering capability in relays and availibility
of all of the subchannels to all of the BS and Relays.
We formulate joint channel and power allocation as an
optimization problem and introducing some concepts, we

show its similarity to a multicell OFDMA scenario with
smaller cells. Moreover, to make the problem tractable, we
transform it into a convex optimization problem and using
dual decomposition, we propose an iterative Dynamic Dis-
tributed Resource Allocation (DDRA) algorithm, where BS
and each relay solve their own problem based on their users’
Queue and Channel State Information (QCSI) and some
global variables exchanged among them. DDRA provides
a novel framework for exploiting the system’s power and
subchannel resources in an effeicient and adaptive way over
time, with lower overhead of the CSI feedback and lower
computational complexity at the BS compared to optimal
centralized scheduling which requires global CSI at the BS.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we outline the model for the relay assisted OFDMA
system. In Section III, we formulate the resource allocation
algorithm design as an optimization problem and solve it by
dual decomposition, where distributed closed-form solutions
for power and subcarrier allocation are derived. Simulation
results for the distributed algorithm are studied in Section
IV with conclusion ﬁnally presented in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a single cell time slotted OFDMA system
in downlink (DL) with K users and M relays. Users are
uniformly distributed in the cell, K1 of them being served
directly by BS while others receive data through one of the
relays. As it is shown in Figure 1, we assume that each user
has been assigned to either BS or any of the relays based
on a criteria such as average Signal to Nosie Ratio (SNR),
distance from the BS and relays, etc.
Relays’ locations are ﬁxed and can have different dis-
tances from BS, based on the topology of the service area.
BS and relays are equipped with buffers, where BS has
one for each user but relays have one for each of only
the users connected to them. Users’ packets arrive at the
BS buffer according to their trafﬁc model and are queued
until transmission to the directly connected users or to relays
serving other users. Relays do not need to transmit the
received packets immediately in the next time slot and it is
possible to keep them in the buffers and serve them based on
the scheduling policy. This gives ﬂexibility to the scheduler
to utilize the resources more opportunistically by postponing
the transmission until the user gets higher priority or better
channel. We use QB
k , k = 1, . . . , K to denote the queue size
of user k in BS, and QR(k)
k
, k = K1 + 1, . . . , K to denote
the queue size of user k in its serving relay, R(k).
We assume that transmission bandwidth is divided into N
subchannels where each subchannel can be used exclusively
by BS or relays in one of the groups of the links, i.e., BS-
to-users, BS-to-relays and relays-to-users. Any relay has the
ability to transmit on some subchannels and at the same time
receive data from BS on other ones. The channels in all the
links are assumed time variant and frequency selective, but

ratio corresponding to the link between BS and user k as
follows:

(1)
where HB
kn is the small scale fading coefﬁcient between BS
and user k in subchanel n, GB
k is the path loss attenuation
between BS and user k and σ2
n is the variance of Gaussian
noise. eR(k)
kn
and eBR(k)
n
can be deﬁned in a similar way for
the links between R(k) and user k and the links between
BS and R(k). Assuming that M-ary QAM modulation is
used for transmission, the achievable transmission rate can
be computed as follows[9]:

where, without loss of generality, the bandwidth of a sub-
channel has been assumed equal to 1. rB
kn is the achievable
transmission rate between BS and user k on subchannel n.
xB
kn denotes subchannel allocation indicator which would be
one if subchannel n is used by BS to transmit data to user k,
k = 1...K1, and zero otherwise. pB
kn is the power allocated
by BS to user k on subchannel n. Γk is the SNR gap due
to the limited number of coding and modulation schemes
and is related to bit error rate of user k (BERk), through
equation Γk = − ln(5BERk)

III. CROSS LAYER SCHEDULING AND RESOURCE
ALLOCATION
In this section, we formulate the cross layer scheduling
and resource allocation and then using some deﬁnitions and
modiﬁcations, we propose a new perspective with simpliﬁed
convex optimization problem.
A. Problem Formulation
In each time slot, the resource allocation policy aims
at efﬁcient use of the system resources, i.e., power and
subchannles, while considering the QoS for the users, in
terms of BER and queue stability. For this purpose, a weight
is considered for each of the users on their links and the
objective is to maximize the weighted throughput over the

links. The cross layer scheduling and resource allocation can
be formulated as the following optimization problem:

where wB
k , wBR(k)

, and wR(k)
k
are the weights of the users
over the links of BS-to-users, BS-to-relays and relays-to-
users. Constraint C1 is the total power constraint for the BS
and the relays. The problem (3a) is a complex combinatorial
optimization problem, which needs an exhaustive search to
ﬁnd the optimal solution. In order to make the problem
tractable, we relax the subchannel assignment variables
xB
kn, xBR(k)
kn
, xR(k)
kn
to be real value between zero and one,
instead of a Boolean, i.e., 0 ≤ xB

≤ 1,
which is known as time or tone sharing. Furthermore, we
consider the buffers of users k = K1, . . . , K in their relays,
as virtual users that are directly connected to BS. In other
words, we interpret the links between BS and relays as the
direct links between BS and some virtual users. As shown
in Figure 2, this perspective helps us to divide the serving
area (single cell) into smaller areas (multi cells) served by
M +1 nodes, where node 1 is BS with K users and has the
complicated RRM capability and act as a central controller
while nodes m, m = 2, . . . , M + 1, are the relays with
their own users, totally K − K1 users, and acts as antennas
distributed in the serving area and connected wirelessly to
the controller. We denote the set of users of node m with
Um; in particular U1 = 1...K. Each node has the buffers
of its own users and transmits data independently; however
in the beginning of each slot they all communicate with a
central controller in node 1 to decide about their shares of
power and subchannels in order not to make interference to
other nodes.
We use the following notations for each user:

kn and pm
kn can be deﬁned in a similar way. We deﬁne

kn ∈ [0, 1]} as the domain of the
problem. Due to tone sharing, SNR will be equal to pm
knem
kn

Figure 2.
Similarity of the model to multicell network
this SNR is because of viewing pm
kn as the energy per time
slot that node m uses for user k on subchannel n [10]. As
a result the rates will be computed by rm
kn = xm
kn log2(1 +

knΓk ). Assuming that the system is stabilizable, similar to
[11], it can be proved that queue stability can be provided
by deﬁning the weights of users as follows:

k
, m=1, k=1, . . . , K
QR(k)
k
, m=2, . . . , M +1, k=K1+1, . . ., K, k ∈ Um
(4)
Considering these weights for queue stability provision,
makes it possible for BS and relays to utilize only local
QCSI for resource allocation algorithm provided in the sub-
sequent subections. Using the framework mentioned above,
resource allocation problem can be represented as follows:
max
p,x ∈D

It is worth to note that the ordinary OFDMA networks can
be considered as a special case of this formulation where
M=0; in that case the virtual users will become the real
users directly connected to BS.
Problem 5 is convex and the strong duality holds [10]
(This can be veriﬁed by deﬁning ˜pm
kn = pm
kn

kn and substituting
in the objective and constraints). Therefore, using dual
decomposition, an iterative algorithm can be designed to
solve the problem.
B. Dual Problem Formulation
In this subsection, we formulate the dual problem for the
resource allocation optimization problem. For this, we ﬁrst
obtain the Lagrangian function of primal problem. After

where µ is the Lagrangian multiplier associated with total
power constraint and δ is the Lagrangian multiplier vector
for the subchannel allocation constraints. The dual problem
is given by:
min
µ,δ≥0
max
p,x∈D L(p, x, µ, δ)
(7)
Similar to the method in [10], the dual problem can be solved
by a centralized iterative algorithm in BS. In this case, since
the BS has the information of the previous transmissions, it
would have QSI of all the relays, but it will need to ask
for the CSI for the links between relays and their users
on all the subchannels which will lead to an overhead in
the order of O((K − K1)N). Alternatively, as in [5], using
dual decomposition and concept of pricing, we propose an
iterative distributed algorithm where in each iteration, BS
and relays, solve their own problem based on the global
variables and their local QCSI.
In the following subsection, we solve the dual problem
in (7) by decomposing it into two parts: the ﬁrst part is the
local subproblem to be solved by each of the serving nodes,
BS and relays, and the second part is the main dual problem
to be solved by BS.
C. Dynamic Distributed Resource Allocation - DDRA
By dual decomposition, the dual problem is decomposed
into a main global problem and M +1 local problems which
can be solved iteratively. In each iteration, using the dual
variables, which are global for all the nodes, BS and relays
solve their local subproblem based on their QCSI. Then
relays report their results to the BS and BS updates the
dual variables and broadcasts them to relays. In this way,
dual variables act as prices that BS adjusts to control the
demands. The local subproblem in each node is given by:
max
p,x∈D Lm(p, x, µ, δ),

In some time slots, more than one users might have V m
kn =
(V m∗

)+. This happens mostly for the virtual users of BS
that represent the links belonging to the same group, i.e.,
between BS and a particular relay, as these links have the
same channel condition over a subchannel. In such cases,
subchannel is allocated to the user that has larger queue size
or better channel condition. According to (4), (10) and (12),
queue sizes of users, their channel conditions and required
BER will affect their share of power and subchennals.
D. Solution of Main Dual Problem at BS
Based on the information of the powers and channel
allocation variables reported by relays and using subgradient
method, BS will update the dual variables through the
following iterations:

In this algorithm, the overhead of messages reported by
relays will be in the order of O(NM) multiplied by the
number of iterations, which would be considerably lower
than that of centralized algorithm in the networks with high
number of users. Number of iterations can be optimized to
reach fast convergence, by choosing suitable step sizes and
initial values [5].
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
To evaluate the system performance, we have considered
a system with M=3 and N=20 and have conducted extensive
Matlab simulations over 1000 time slots. Simulation param-
eters are shown in table I. For the links from BS or relay
to users, Rayleigh channel model is used, while the links
from BS to relays, are modeled with Rician channel with
κ factor equal to 6 dB. Results are presented in terms of
system throughput as well as average and maximum queue
sizes in the system. For baseline, we have used the PPF
method proposed in [4] in which power is equally allocated
over subchannels and relays are prompt, i.e., they transmit
in a time subslot immediately after the reception subslot.
We have adjusted PPF for our scenario by considering the
availability of data in the queues of users in BS; we call
it Queue Aware PPF (QAPPF), as it computes the achiev-
able rates of users based on their queue size and channel
conditions. Figure 3 shows the average system throughput
in each time slot, with two values of systme total power.
It is observed that DDRA is able to utilize the wireless
resources more efﬁciently, compared to QAPPF. The reason
is that although both of them share the system power and
subchannels for the users directly connected to BS and users
connected through relays, in DDRA BS and relays allocate
power and subchannels adaptively and also have ﬂexibility
over time to transmit to users and as a result they are able to
get higher beneﬁt from resources and from time diversity.
Also it is observed that as the number of users increases,
DDRA is able to utilize the multiuser diversity and get more
gain. This is also displayed in Figure 4, by the Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of throughputs in each time
slot, in the case of 10 users. The jumps in the diagram

of DDRA are because of the fact that it utilizes resources
efﬁciently and is able to empty the queues sometimes. Then
when a new packet is arrived in a time slot in one of the
queues, it is transmitted completely. It is clear frrom Figure
4 that DDRA is able to provide higher bit rates with higher
probability.
Figure 5 demonstrates the average queue size in the
system over time, with 10 users. While DDRA keeps queues
stable, QAPPF is not able to reach this goal and therefore
queue sizes increase unboundedly. We also show the CDF of
maximum queue sizes in a system with 10 users in Figure 6.
QAPPF results in higher probability for large queue sizes in
the system, which would cause higher probability of buffer
overﬂow. On the other hand, DDRA is able to keep queue
sizes in smaller ranges and guarantee system stability. This
is due to the fact that according to (4) DDRA gives higher
weights to the users with larger queue sizes and using (10)
and (12), it is able to allocate resources adaptively based
on queue size, channel condition and required BER of the
users. As the results conﬁrm, DDRA is a throughput optimal
algorithm, meaning that it is able to keep the queue sizes
bounded if it is feasible at all [11].

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we provided a novel framework for joint
power and subchannel allocation in a relay assisted OFDMA
network, with the assumption that relays are able to buffer
data and transmit in a later time. Deﬁning the links between
BS and relays as virtual users, a new perspective was pro-
vided and similarity of the system to a multicell network was
shown. We formulated the resource allocation problem as a
convex optimization problem and using dual decomposition,
we proposed an iterative Dynamic Distributed Resource
Allocation (DDRA) algorithm, in which each of the BS
and relays solve their own problem based on some global
variables and their local information about queue and chan-
nel states of their users. The closed form equations derived
for power and subchannel allocation, reveals the adaptive
characteristic of our resource allocation algorithm based on
queue size, channel condition and required BER of the users.
The propsed perspective and algorithm, is highly scalable
which is of great appeal for deployment and radio resource
management of relay assisted OFDMA networks. Numerical
results conﬁrm the throughput optimality of DDRA and
show signiﬁcant improvement in the system performance
in terms of average throughput and queue stability. As the
future work, we will consider separate power constraints for
BS and relays and will extend DDRA for a scenario with
both delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant services.
