Abstract—Various studies have been conducted to analyze 
social media data in real time and to extract events in the real 
world. A benefit of analysis using data with position 
information is that it can accurately extract the event from a 
target area to be analyzed. However, because the proportion of 
data with position information in social media data is small, 
the amount to analyze is insufficient in almost areas. In other 
words, the problem indicates that we cannot fully extract most 
events. Therefore, efficient analytical methods are necessary 
for accurate extraction of events with position information, 
even in areas with few data. For this research, we conducted an 
experiment using information interpolation to estimate the 
times for biological season observation using tweets with 
Twitter 
location 
information. 
Then 
we 
evaluated 
its 
effectiveness. Herein, we explain results obtained using 
interpolated information and analysis of cherry blossoms in 
Japan in 2016.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, because of wide dissemination and rapid 
performance improvement of various devices such as smart 
phones and tablets, diverse and vast data are generated on the 
web. Particularly, social networking services (SNSs) have 
become popular because users can post data and various 
messages easily. Twitter [1], an SNS that provides a micro-
blogging service, is used as a real-time communication tool. 
Numerous tweets have been posted daily by vast numbers of 
users. Twitter is therefore a useful medium to obtain, from a 
large amount of information posted by many users, real-time 
information corresponding to the real world. 
Here, we describe the provision of information to tourists 
using the web. Such information is useful for tourists, but 
providing timely and topical travel information entails high 
costs for information providers because they must update the 
information 
continually. 
Today, 
providing 
reliable 
information related to local travel is not only strongly 
demanded by tourists, but also by local governments, 
tourism organizations, and travel companies, which bear 
high costs of providing such information. 
Therefore, 
providing 
current, 
useful, 
real-world 
information for travelers by ascertaining the change of 
information in accordance with the season and time zone of 
the tourism region is important for the travel industry. As 
described herein, we define "now" information 
as 
information that travelers require for tourism and disaster 
prevention, such as best flower-viewing times, festivals, and 
local heavy rains. As one might expect, the period estimated 
for disaster prevention information would be an estimate of 
the “worst” time instead of the best time. 
We propose a method to estimate best-time viewing for 
phenological observations for tourists, such as cherry 
blossoms and autumn leaves, in each region by particularly 
addressing phenology observations that must be made “now” 
in the real world. Tourist information for the best time 
requires a peak period: the best time is not a period after or 
before the falling of flowers, but a period when one can view 
blooming flowers. Furthermore, such best times differ 
among regions and locations. Therefore, it is necessary to 
estimate a best time of phenological observation for each 
region and location. To estimate best-time viewing, one must 
collect large amounts of information with real-time 
properties. For this study, we use Twitter data obtained from 
many users throughout Japan. 
However, to analyze the information of each region from 
Twitter data, it is necessary to specify the location from 
tweet information. Because geotagged tweets can identify 
places, they are effective for analysis, but because the 
proportion of geo-tagged tweets accounts for a very small 
proportion of the total information content of tweets, it is not 
possible to analyze all regions. Therefore, we propose an 
information interpolation method using geo-tagged tweets. 
We conducted experiments to estimate the position around 
areas not identified by location information. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents earlier research related to this topic. In 
Section III, we propose a method for estimating the best time 
for phenotypic observations using information interpolation.

Section IV describes experimentally obtained results for our 
proposed method and a discussion of the results. Section V 
presents a summary of the contributions and future work.

RELATED WORK 
The amounts of digital data are expected to increase 
greatly in the future because of the spread of SNSs. Reports 
describing studies of the effective use of these large amounts 
of digital data are numerous. Some studies use microblogs to 
conduct real-world understanding and prediction by 
analyzing 
information 
transmitted 
from 
microblogs. 
Kleinberg [2] detected a "burst" of keywords signaling a 
rapid increase in time-series data. Sakaki et al. [3] proposed a 
method to detect events such as earthquakes and typhoons 
based on a study estimating real-time events from Twitter. 
Kaneko et al. [4] proposed a method of detecting an event 
using geotagged non-photo tweets and non-geotagged photo 
tweets, as well as geotagged photo tweets. Yamagata et al. 
[5] proposed a real-time urban climate monitoring method 
using geographically tagged tweets, demonstrating the 
effectiveness of tweets for urban risk management. 
Consequently, various methods for extracting event and 
location information are discussed. However, event detection 
has been done in earlier studies, but discussion of the validity 
period of the event has not been reported. As described in 
this paper, we propose a method for extracting such 
information. Then we estimate “now” in relation to tourism 
information, such as the full bloom period of phonological 
observations. Additionally, we treat a crucially important 
difficulty related to analysis of geotagged contents: what 
amount of data is effective for an analyzed area. 
III. 
OUR PROPOSED METHOD 
This section presents a description of an analytical 
method for target data collection and presents our best-time 
estimation to obtain a guide for phenological change from 
Twitter in Japan. Our proposal is portrayed in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Our proposal. 
A. Data collection 
This section presents a description of the Method of (1) 
data collection presented in Figure 1. Geotagged tweets sent 
from Twitter are a collection target. The range of geo-tagged 
tweets includes the Japanese archipelago (120.0°E ≤ 
longitude ≤ 154.0°E and 20.0°N ≤ latitude ≤ 47.0°N) as the 
collection target. Collection of these data was done using a 
streaming API [6] provided by Twitter Inc. 
Next, we describe the number of collected data. 
According to a report described by Hashimoto et al. [7], 
among all tweets originating in Japan, about 0.18% are 
geotagged tweets: they are rare among all data. However, the 
collected geo-tagged tweets, shown as an example in Table I, 
number about 70,000, even on weekdays. On some days 
during weekends, more than 100,000 such messages are 
posted. We use about 30 million geo-tagged tweets from 
2015/2/17 through 2016/4/30. For each day of collection, the 
number during the period covered was about 72,000. We 
calculated the best time for flower viewing, as estimated by 
processing the following sections using these data.

TRANSITION OF GEOTAGGED TWEETS 
(2015/5/9 – 6/3) 
 
B. Preprocessing 
This section presents a description of the method of (2) 
preprocessing presented in Figure 1. Preprocessing includes 
reverse geocoding and morphological analysis, with database 
storage for data collected using the process explained in 
Section III.A. 
Reverse 
geocoding 
identified 
prefectures 
and 
municipalities by town name using latitude and longitude 
information from the individually collected tweets. We use a 
simple reverse geocoding service [8] available from the 
National Agriculture and Food Research Organization in this 
process: 
e.g., (latitude, 
longitude) 
= 
(35.7384446N, 
139.460910W) by reverse geocoding becomes (Tokyo, 
Kodaira City, Ogawanishi-cho 2-chome). Furthermore, 
based on latitude and longitude information of collected 
tweets, data are accumulated for each division of land using 
tertiary mesh data provided by the Land Numerical 
Information download service of the Ministry of Land, 
Infrastructure, and Transport [9]. The tertiary mesh is a 
section of about 1 km square. 
Morphological analysis divides the collected geo-tagged 
tweet morphemes. We use the “Mecab” morphological 
analyzer [10]. As an example, “桜は美しいです” (“Cherry 
blossoms are beautiful.” in English) is divisible into "(桜 / 
noun), (は / particle), (美しい / adjective), (です / auxiliary 
verb), (。 / symbol)". 
Preprocessing performs the necessary data storage for the 
best-time viewing, as estimated based on results of the 
processing of data collection, reverse geocoding, and 
morphological analysis. Data used for this study were the 
tweet ID, tweet post time, tweet text, morphological analysis 
result, latitude, and longitude.

C. Estimating the best-time viewing 
This section explains the method of (3) best-time 
estimation presented in Figure 1. In our method of estimating 
best-time viewing, we first process the target number of 
extracted data and then calculate a simple moving average, 
yielding an inference of the best flower-viewing time. The 
method defines a word related to best-time viewing, 
estimated as the target word. The target word includes 
Chinese characters, hiragana, and katakana, which represents 
an organism name and seasonal change, as shown in Table II. 
TABLE II.  
TARGET WORD EXAMPLES 
 
 
Next, the granularity for estimation is shown. For an 
estimate for Japan as a whole, prefecture units are assumed 
and acquired by reverse geocoding. However, when 
conducting more detailed analyses, a difficulty arises: it is 
impossible to estimate the number of geotagged tweets for 
each city or town or village or tourist spot. Therefore, we 
attempted estimation through information interpolation using 
data aggregated for each section of tertiary mesh data. For 
interpolation, we used Kriging [11], an estimation method 
used for estimating values for points where information was 
not acquired, to ascertain the distribution of the information 
in the whole space in geostatistics. The estimated value of 
the target data at a certain point S0 is represented in formula 
(1) as a weighted average of the measured values  Z(Si) (i = 1, 
2..., N) at N points Si existing around point S0. As described 
in this paper, we experimentally assigned a +1 weight for 
'full bloom' and 'beautiful', and assigned -1 on 'still' or 
'falling'. Then we assigned value Z to tweets including the 
target word and Z. N denotes the 30 nearby targeted tweets. λ 
has adopted a spherical model that decreases the influence as 
the distance increases.

𝑆0 : Predicted position

Next, we describe the simple moving average calculation, 
which uses a moving average of the standard of the best-time 
viewing judgment. It calculates a simple moving average 
using aggregate data on a daily basis by the target number of 
data extraction described above. Figure 2 shows an overview 
of the simple moving average of the number of days. 
We calculate the simple moving average in formula (2) 
using the number of data going back to the past from the day 
before the estimated date of the best-time viewing. 
Standard lengths of time we used for the simple moving 
averages were seven days and one year. A 7-day moving 
                                 𝑋(𝑌) = 𝑃1 + 𝑃2 + ⋯ + 𝑃𝑌

Figure 2.  Number of days simple moving average. 
average has one week as the criterion of the estimated 
period of full bloom because, as shown in Table I, a 
tendency exists for a transition of geotagged tweets of the 
increases on weekends compared to weekdays. In addition, 
phenological observations are based on the moving average 
of best-time viewing estimated in prior years because  many 
such “viewing” events occur every year: cherry blossom 
viewing, autumn leaf viewing, and even moon viewing. 
A simple moving average of the number of days is 
described for each type of event to compare the 7-day 
moving average and the one-year moving average. In this 
study, the period of the best-time viewing depends on the 
specified type of event, the individual event, and the number 
of days during the biological period related to the event. 
As an example, we describe cherry blossoms. The Japan 
Meteorological Agency [12] carries out phenological 
observations of "Sakura," which yields two output items of 
the flowering date and the full bloom date observation target. 
"Sakura flowering date" [13] is the first day of blooming 5–
6 or more wheels of flowers of a specimen tree. "Sakura in 
full bloom date" is the first day of a state in which about 
80% or more of the buds are open in the specimen tree. In 
addition, "Sakura" is the number of days from general 
flowering until full bloom: about 5 days. Therefore, 
"Sakura" in this study uses a standard 5-day moving average. 
Next, we describe an estimated judgment of best-time 
viewing, which was calculated using the simple moving 
average (7-day moving average, 1-year moving average, and 
another biological moving average). It specifies the two 
conditions as a condition of an estimated decision for best-
time viewing. Condition 1 is the number of data one day 
before expression. Formula 3 is a simple moving average 
greater than that of the estimated best-time viewing date.

Condition 2 is a case that follows formulas 4 ((A) / (2)) or 
more.  
 
                                       𝑃1 ≧ 𝑋(365)                                        (3) 
                                  𝑋(𝐴) ≧ 𝑋(𝐵)                                            (4) 
 
Finally, an estimate is produced using conditions 1 and 2. 
By the proposed method, a day that satisfies both condition 
1 and condition 2 is estimated as best-time viewing. 
D. Output 
This section presents a description of the method of (4) 
output presented in Figure 1. Output can be visualized using 
a best-time viewing result, as estimated by processing 
explained in the previous section. A time-series graph 
presents the results inferred for best-time viewing. The 
graph presents the number of data and the date, respectively, 
on the vertical axis to the horizontal axis. We are striving to 
develop useful visualization techniques for travelers. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTS 
In this section, we describe an estimation experiment of 
best-time viewing for cherry blossoms using the method 
proposed in Section III. 
A. Dataset 
Datasets used for this experiment were collected using 
streaming API, as described for data collection in Section 3.1. 
Data are geo-tagged tweets from Japan during 2015/2/17 – 
2016/4/30. The data include about 27 million items. We are 
using these datasets for experiments to infer the best time for 
cherry blossom viewing in 2016. 
B. Estimation experiment for best-time viewing of cherry 
blossoms 
The estimation experiment to ascertain the best-time 
viewing of cherry blossoms uses the target word in Table II: 
"Sakura". The target word is “cherry blossom,” which is “桜” 
and “さくら” and “サクラ” in Japanese. The subject of the 
experiment was set as tourist spots in Tokyo. In this report, 
we describe “Takao mountain,” “Showa Memorial Park," 
“Shinjuku gyoen,” and “Rikugien.” 
Figure 3 presents the target area location. A, B, C and D 
in the figure respectively denote “Takao mountain,” “Showa 
Memorial Park,” “Rikugien,” and “Shinjuku Gyoen.” A and 
B are separated by about 16 km straight line distance. B and 
C are about 32 km apart. C and D are about 6 km apart. 
The following two experiments were conducted. The 
first is an experiment using the number of tweets including 
the target word and the sightseeing spot name without 
information interpolation. This is Experiment 1 described in 
this paper. The second is an experiment using information 
interpolation for tertiary mesh including sightseeing spots. 
In the second experiment, the numerical value obtained by 
summing the result of the information interpolation and the 
first experiment result was used for observation estimation. 
This is Experiment 2 in this paper. 
 
Figure 3.  Position of target area. 
C. Experimental result 
We can present experimentally obtained results from 
tweets including a target word and a tourist spot name. 
Figure 4 shows those results for the estimated best-time 
viewing in 2016 using the target word ‘cherry blossoms’ in 
the target tourist spots of Figure 3. The dark gray bar in the 
figure represents the number of tweets. The light gray part 
represents best-time viewing as determined using the 
proposed method. In addition, the solid line shows a 5-day 
moving average. The dashed line shows a 7-day moving 
average. The dotted line shows a 1-year moving average. 
At tourist spots targeted for the experiment in 2016, as 
portrayed in Figure 4, much data was obtained in C and D. 
The maximum number of tweets per day was about 30. For 
this reason, it was confirmed that some estimation can be 
done by near-sight estimation method without interpolation. 
However, best-time viewing cannot be done in A and B 
because of the very small number of tweets. 
Next, Figure 5 portrays an experimentally obtained 
result from interpolation results for a tertiary mesh including 
tourist spots we examined. The notation is the same as that 
in Figure 4.

Figure 5.  Experimental results obtained using interpolation. 
Apparently, A and B were able to produce an estimate 
using the proposed method by increasing the number of 
tweets using information interpolation with surrounding 
tweets. In C and D, there are days when it can be 
determined more accurately by interpolating the number of 
tweets. However, because there were tweets of negative 
judgments such as "still" or "scattered" among surrounding 
tweets, in some cases, interpolation excluded the day 
determined as the best time in Experiment 1. Therefore, the 
judgment condition of the tweet is subject to further study. 
These results confirmed the possibility of estimating the 
peak period, even in an area without tweets, using data 
interpolation and overall tweet number interpolation. 
Table III presents results of the optimal time for viewing 
in 2016, as estimated using the proposed method. 
Experiment 1 used co-occurring words in tweets including 
the sightseeing spot name coexisting with the target word 
"Sakura." Experiment 2 used information interpolation on a 
tertiary mesh including sightseeing spots. The numerical 
values in the table are the numbers of tweets including the 
target word and co-occurrence word in Experiment 1. 
Experiment 2 uses the sum of the number of tweets in 
Experiment 1 plus numerical values by interpolation. The 
light gray area indicates the date when the fullness 
prediction was made using the proposed method. 
Confirming the flowering day and full bloom period of 
each sightseeing spot using JMA data is difficult, but this 
experiment to evaluate SNS data for flowering is valid also 
for weather forecasting companies [14] and public service 
organizations [15] to evaluate optimum times for viewing 
based on services and blogs that are used. Arrows indicating 
the flowering time can be checked manually at tourist sites. 
Experimental results confirmed the tendency by which 
the relevance ratio and the recall rate become higher for 
tourist spots with few tweets. Therefore, we presented the 
possibility of estimating sightseeing sites with few tweets 
using information interpolation. However, because the 
interpolation information amount is insufficient in the 
current method, it is necessary to improve the information 
interpolation method further. In addition, sightseeing spots 
with many tweets are affected by tweets of minus judgments 
in the surroundings, so accuracy is lower than in Experiment 
1. However, one might be able to estimate more details, 
such as the start time, using interpolation.

V. 
CONCLUSION 
As described herein, to improve best-time estimation 
accuracy and thereby enhance tourist information related to 
phenologic observation, we proposed an information 
interpolation method. For the proposed method, information 
was interpolated using neighbor-weighted tweets on a 
tertiary mesh including sightseeing spots, thereby indicating 
the optimum time to view flowers at sightseeing spots. 
The results of cherry blossom experiments at sightseeing 
spots in Tokyo in 2016 confirm the tendency for 
improvement of accuracy of estimation by information 
interpolation. The proposed method using information 
interpolation for tweets related to organism names might 
improve the accuracy of estimating the best time in the real 
world. We confirmed the possibility of applying this 
proposed method to estimation of the viewpoint and line of 
sight in areas and sightseeing spots with few tweets and 
little 
location 
information. 
However, 
because 
the 
experimental case was related only to cherry blossoms, it is 
necessary to verify other cases as well. 
Future research with manual experimental weighting and 
geotagged tweets will facilitate further improvements to 
overcome insufficiencies in measured values used for 
interpolation. Additionally, we expect to reconsider the 
viewing angle estimation conditions. Eventually, this system 
might be extended to a system by which travelers can obtain 
travel-destination-related event information and disaster 
information in real time.
