Abstract—The Internet of Things will connect billions of 
devices to the Internet. However, our current Internet 
infrastructure does not support this amount of connected 
devices and cannot process the amount of data generated by 
them. In order to improve our Internet, a novel architecture 
has being proposed, Information Centric Networks. This work 
has the objective of identify and analyze the current state of 
the art solutions for Caching Schemes in Information Centric 
Networks. To achieve that, a mapping of these solutions was 
conducted. This mapping resulted in the finding of 127 works, 
of which 20 were identified as primary studies. This mapping 
shows what is being researched and which directions have been 
considered for improving Caching in Information Centric 
Networks. 
Keywords-Information Centric Networks; Caching; In-
network Cache; Internet of Things; Systematic Mapping.  
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Everyday, different types of objects are being connected 
to the Internet. Objects like an irrigation monitor and control 
systems, thermostats, refrigerators, and door lockers that 
were not previously connected are now part of a network of 
things with the purpose of providing data and/or acting on 
its environment. This trend is called Internet of Things 
(IoT), and it is a concept that has the potential to change our 
day to day lives.  
The IoT is enabling business models that rely on data 
from a variety of different physical objects, like health 
systems that monitor pacemakers. Current forecasts estimate 
that 28-34 billion devices will be connected by the year 
2020, from which 17.5-24 billion will have IoT as their 
primary purpose [1]–[3]. They also estimated that, by 2020, 
nearly 6 trillion dollars will be invested in IoT solutions 
focusing on lowering costs, increasing productivity, 
expanding business to new markets, and developing new 
products [2].  
This amount of connected devices provides us with a 
unique opportunity to create solutions capable of interacting 
with different areas of human knowledge to improve our 
lives, 
like 
Urban 
Infrastructure, 
Agriculture, 
and 
Manufacturing. Among the currently targeted areas, Health 
Care is considered as the most promising of those [4]. 
Digitally delivered services like disease prevention, 
diagnose, monitoring, and treatment are expected to create a 
global growth in economy by 2025 of $1.1-2.5 trillion [4].  
 
Even though the predictions for the IoT reveal a 
promising area, it is not yet a reality. Challenges like 
interoperability, 
security 
and 
privacy, 
scalability, 
performance, availability, and device mobility [5][6] are still 
being researched before we are able to connect the amount 
of devices the IoT requires or to process the amount of data 
that will be produced by these devices.  
In order to solve these issues, researchers and companies 
are working on multiple fronts. For example, the 
interoperability and scalability issues are being tackled by, 
among other things, the development of IoT platforms. 
These platforms enable the connection and communication 
of devices under a single protocol, like KNoT [7], Xively 
[8], and Amazon IoT [9]. Regarding the performance issue 
in IoT, a novel solution has emerged. It is called 
Information Centric Networks (ICN).  
ICN is a novel network architecture that aims to replace 
TCP/IP as the default protocol of the Internet. The ICN 
architecture proposes a shift in paradigm, from a host-
centric network to a data-centric network. In ICN, the focus 
is on the data the user is trying to retrieve instead of from 
where the data is coming. Focusing on the data means that 
the data the user is looking for can come from anywhere in 
the network. That encourages the use of in-network caching 
[10][11], allowing popular data to be stored near the users 
that request them the most.  
In this paper we will map the state of the art of Caching 
approaches in ICN. We will use a process defined by [12] in 
order to minimize any possible bias during the analysis of 
papers. This work aims to be a concise overview of the 
research being made in this field.  
This paper is organized as follow: Section II briefly 
explains ICN’s protocol, how it works and what is still 
being researched. Section III will describe the methods, 
processes, and protocols that were used in this mapping. In 
Section IV, we will present the analysis made in the primary 
studies found during the process described in Section III. 
Finally, in Section V, we will depict the results found in our 
mapping.  
II. INFORMATION CENTRIC NETWORKS 
ICN is a novel approach to network architecture that 
changes the paradigm from a host-centric Internet to a data-
centric Internet. In order to achieve that, content is promoted 
to a first class citizen in ICN. That means that instead of 
requesting data to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 
192

ICSEA 2017 : The Twelfth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

through TCP/IP and URL, in ICN the user requests the data 
through an Unified Content Name. This approach decouples 
data from its host and allows it to be stored anywhere in the 
network [10].  
In ICN, users do not connect directly with a host in order 
to access their data. Instead, they send an Interest Packet to 
all nodes in its Forwarding Information Base (FIB). Upon 
receiving an Interest Packet, the node looks for the data in 
its Content Store. If it is present, then the node consumes 
the Interest Packet and answers the message with the desired 
Data Packet [13]. In case the data is not present, the Interest 
Packet is queued in the Pending Interest Table (PIT) and the 
node forwards the Interest Packet to all nodes in its FIB. 
Once the Packet reaches a node that has the desired data – 
be it an ISP or another node in the network – it answers the 
message with a Data Packet. The Data Packet then follows 
the trail of breadcrumb left by the Interest Packet in the PIT 
of each node in the network until it reaches the original 
requester [13]. While following the breadcrumb, the Data 
Packet meets nodes that implement and nodes that do not 
implement cache policies. The ones that implement cache 
policies will evaluate the Data Packet to decide if it is worth 
caching or not, depending on the criteria configured for that 
node. This characteristic of ICN allows Data Packets to be 
spread in the network, making it easier to be accessed. 
Because of the protocol described in the previous 
paragraph, cache has gained primary importance in ICN. 
Through in-network caching, data can be retrieved from 
neighbor nodes in the network, instead of the ISP, 
decreasing the delay of data retrieval. 
The default implementation of the caching protocol in 
ICN is called Cache All [13]. However, this protocol 
imposes a high storage cost to all nodes in the network. 
Moreover, duplicating all data in all nodes can lead to 
duplication where the data is not necessary. In order to make 
ICN viable for day to day use, ICN's Caching Scheme needs 
to be improved. Several research are being made with this 
goal in mind. This work will map some of these research.  
III. APPLIED PROTOCOL 
The objective of this mapping is to identify the state of 
the art solutions for Caching in ICN. In order to identify the 
studies related to this topic, the following question was 
thought:  
• How the Internet of Things will affect the performance 
of the Internet? 
From this question, secondary questions were developed 
in order to help the comprehension of the solutions:  
• How is Information Centric Networks handling 
information cache? 
• In what ways can we use cache to improve the data 
availability in the Information Centric Networks? 
• What are the main challenges in using cache in 
Information Centric Networks? 
The protocol used in this study is based on the protocol 
used in [12], which is based on the guidelines of 
Kitchenham [14] and the analysis of [15]. This review 
process is composed of the following five stages: (1) 
identification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, (2) search 
for relevant studies, (3) critical assessment, (4) extraction of 
data, and (5) synthesis. Each of these stages is elaborated in 
the next sections.  
A. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
For this review, we focused on studies that present novel 
caching solutions for ICN. These solutions ranged from 
novel forwarding algorithms to monetized caching policies. 
Since the focus was to analyze the state of the art 
considering Caching for ICN, the studies were excluded in 
case they did not fit at least one of the following criteria: 
• 
Published after 2015.  
• 
Published in English.  
• 
Studies that were not available online.  
• 
Call for works, prefaces, conference annals, 
handouts, summaries, panels, interviews, and news 
report.  
B. Search Strategies 
The studies gathered for this review were found in the 
databases below: 
• 
IEEE Xplore.  
• 
ACM Digital Library.  
• 
SpringerLink. 
Keywords were identified and combinations of those 
were used to make sure relevant content were not missed. 
The queries below were the result of these combinations:  
• 
ICN AND cache  
• 
ICN AND caching  
• 
"information centric network" AND cache  
• 
"information centric network" AND caching 
These queries were combined into one query and used in 
order to search the databases. The searches were performed 
in March 2017. The results of each search were grouped and 
were later examined in order to remove duplications. Table I 
shows the amount of studies found on each database.

C. Studies Selection Process 
This section describes the Selection Process from search 
in the databases engines all the way through the 
identification of the primary studies.  
In the first stage, the studies gathered in the databases 
through the queries were grouped in a spreadsheet for 
further analysis. This search returned 127 non-duplicated 
studies.  
The second stage consists of the analysis of the titles of 
all the resulting studies to determine its relevance for this 
mapping. At this point, many works that were not related to 
caching in ICN were discarded. From the original 127 
193

ICSEA 2017 : The Twelfth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

works, 40 remained after selecting them by titles. Among 
the works left, some were put aside to be analyzed in the 
next stage due to ambiguous titles.  
After analyzing the titles, the abstracts of the remaining 
studies were analyzed in the third stage. In this stage several 
other studies were discarded since many did not match our 
expectations of presenting solutions for caching in ICN. 
After this stage another 18 works were discarded, leaving 22 
to be analyzed.  
Table II summarizes the amount of studies left after each 
stage of the Selection Process.

D. Quality Assessment 
In this stage, the remaining works went through a careful 
analysis. This analysis took into account not only the title 
and abstracts, but the whole content of the study. During 
this analysis, 2 (two) studies were considered uninteresting 
for this mapping so they were discarded.  
In this analysis, relevance grades were used to classify 
each of the studies according to five questions. These 
questions helped in the identification of studies related to 
our mapping of caching solutions in ICN. From these five 
questions, the first two were crucial to the process of 
assessing the study contribution for this mapping. The 
remaining questions were used to assess the quality of the 
studies. The questions were: 
• 
Does the study propose a solution to improve the 
performance of Information Centric Networks? 
• 
Does the study adequately describe the proposed 
solution? 
• 
Was the solution adequately tested? e.g., did it use 
an ICN Simulator? 
• 
Were the conditions of the test adequately 
described? 
• 
Were the results adequately compared with other 
solutions?  
Of the remaining 22 works, 20 were selected as primary 
studies. These studies then went to the Data Extraction and 
Synthesis stage. The quality assessment process will be 
explained in more details in the Results section, along with 
an assessment of the 20 studies.  
IV. RESULTS 
As stated before, 20 works were selected as primary 
studies [15]–[35] after the Selection Process. These studies 
approached the caching issue in ICN in a variety of ways. 
Some proposed novel Replication and Content Eviction 
algorithms [17][18]. Some proposed Collaborative Caching 
polices among routers [23]. And some worked on the 
possibility of using monetization to incentive popular 
content caching throughout the network [27][28]. 
The following sections will dive deeper into the 
qualitative and quantitative analysis of the selected studies. 
A. Quantitative Analysis 
This section brings a quantitative analysis of the selected 
studies. This analysis intends to show who is studying 
Caching in ICN, where they are, and which keywords to use 
in order to find these studies. 
The 20 selected studies were written by 66 authors 
affiliated to institutions in 12 countries. These studies were 
published between January 2015 and March 2017. In total, 
the studies used 63 different keywords. 
The most common keywords used in these studies were: 
information centric network (13), caching (6), ICN (6), ccn 
(3), content centric networking (3), in-network caching (3), 
cache (2), content delivery networks (ccn) (2), game theory 
(2), named data networking (2), and network pricing (2). All 
the other keywords appeared only once. It is worth noticing 
that the first seven keywords are directly related to the 
theme of this mapping. 
An analysis of these keywords can show how the 
primary studies are subdivided. The most frequent keywords 
represent the common theme among the studies, keywords 
like caching, networking, and information centric are 
present in all studies. Moving past these keywords, we can 
see keywords that state some of the concerns of these 
studies, like performance and bandwidth. One step further 
revels keywords that represent the strategies used by the 
researchers, like forwarding, replication, and popularity 
based algorithms. At last, the least common keywords are 
the names of the proposed solutions. Fast-Start [24], CLCE 
[17], LFRU [17], and RB-CCC [32] are a few of them.  
Regarding the country of origin, China had the most 
published studies (4.07). United States came in second place 
with 4 publications, Japan in third with 3 studies, India and 
France with 1.66 each. Brazil, Canada, Greece, United 
Kingdom, and South Korea came in fifth place, all with 1 
publication, Germany in sixth with 0.33, and Sweden in 
seventh with 0.25. 
B. Qualitative Analysis  
As described before, each of the selected primary studies 
have been assessed according to five quality criteria related 
to their relevance. When considered, these five criteria can 
provide a clear view of how much each of the primary 
studies is relevant to this work. Each study has been 
classified for each of the criteria using a positive or negative 
answer.  
Table III presents the result of this analysis. Each row 
represents a study and the columns 'Q1' to 'Q2' represent 
each of the defined quality criteria: Solution Proposal and 
Description, Validation, and Comparison with other 
solutions. For each criteria, '1' is used to represent a positive 
answer and '0' is used to represent a negative one. 
All but [19][27][28] had positive answers for 'Q1' and 
'Q2'. As stated before, these questions were used as a way of 
measuring the contribution each study could have to this

mapping. However, even though these studies did not 
proposed any novel approaches to ICN caching, they were 
included in the study since they either evaluated [19] an 
approach that was not present in the database search or 
proposed improvements in an already existing approach 
[27][28]. Including these studies allows us to have a bigger 
picture of the research in ICN caching.

Other than the studies discussed above, [35] was the 
only other study that did not met all the expected criteria. It 
does describe a new approach to ICN caching, but the 
validation is not properly described nor it is compared to 
other approaches. 
V. DISCUSSION 
After the analysis and data extraction phases, it was 
possible to notice some aspects of the research that have 
been made regarding ICN caching. Firstly, almost all of the 
studies analyzed proposed a novel approach to ICN caching. 
This shows that there is currently no agreement on which 
solution should be considered standard. Secondly, a great 
variety of solutions have been proposed. From simply 
replacing the Storage [17] or Forwarding [20] algorithms, to 
solutions involving monetization in order to incentive other 
routers to cache data relevant to the payer router [27][28]. 
Finally, although most of the research have been made for 
caching in applications of general use, some research have 
also been made for niche-specific applications, like video 
streaming [24].  
The next sections will discuss the questions that guided 
this mapping, and a important aspect of the performance 
evaluations made in the studies. 
A. How is Information Centric Networks handling 
information cache? 
The analysis of the primary studies reviewed several 
different approaches to in-network caching. The first (and 
most common) approach was to replace the algorithms used 
in the Content Store. According to [17], the Content Storage 
of a network is composed by two elements – the Replication 
Algorithm and the Eviction Algorithm. The Replication 
Algorithm defines the policy used to spread the content 
throughout 
the 
network. 
Examples 
of 
Replication 
Algorithms are Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE) [13][37] and 
Leave Copy Down (LCD) [38][39]. The Eviction Algorithm 
defines the rules used to decide whether an arriving content 
should replace an existing one. An example of Eviction 
Algorithm is the LRU (Least Recently Used) [40].  
Here are a few examples of the proposed algorithms:  
• 
Conditional Leave Copy Everywhere (CLCE) and 
Least Frequent Recently Use (LFRU), by [17]. 
• 
Progressive and Fast Progressive, by [31]. 
• 
Object-Oriented Packet Caching, by [29]. 
These algorithms were built using different assumptions 
and techniques. Some do popularity-based decisions [31], 
others use assumptions regarding user behavior as input for 
its algorithm [35], and some try to fix issues in previously 
proposed approaches [17]. 
One of the studies leverages the use of monetization in 
order to incentive nodes of the network to store data in their 
caches. The studies [27][28] try to improve the original 
approach by improving the algorithm used to determine the 
price. Another study proposes a fixed network layout in 
order to achieve optimal result with video streaming [24]. 
At last, one study proposes a change in the Routing 
Algorithm [20] to improve the changes of finding the data 
that the user is looking for in neighbor nodes, different than 
the usual Routing Algorithm that creates a tree-like 
structure. 
This variety of approaches shows that there are many 
aspects that can be tackled when improving Cache in ICN, 
not only the most common one: improving the heuristic 
behind the Eviction and Replication algorithms. 
B. In what ways can we use cache to improve the data 
availability in the Information Centric Networks? 
An analysis of the primary studies shows that, although, 
most of the proposed solutions are not domain specific, 
some have very specific niches. At one hand, general-
application solutions have the advantage of being able to 
deal with a broader set of situations. These solutions can 
handle applications like web searching, file downloads, and 
195

ICSEA 2017 : The Twelfth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

so forth. On the other hand, however, these solutions have 
the disadvantage of not being fully optimized for demanding 
niches, like video streaming.  
According to a forecast by Cisco [36], by 2020 82% of 
Internet traffic will be video stream; against 70% in 2015. 
This shows a significant growth in video consumption. 
In order to minimize network traffic, ICN can be used as 
a way to cache video content near the consumers. Requiring 
less hops to find the desired content and creating less 
overhead in the network nodes. However, it can also be used 
to store other types of streaming, like music, for example, as 
well as for general web applications like news feed and data 
access when the main ISP is offline. 
ICN’s distributed cache nature allows us to improve the 
Quality of Service in several different application domains, 
as well as decrease the load in data centers and Internet 
Providers, by increasing data availability. 
C. What are the main challenges in using cache in 
Information Centric Networks?  
Even though caching can be used to improve the 
performance of many different application domains, not all 
domains have the same requirements and not all protocols 
work the same way. Because of this, caching schemes that 
deliver great performance for video streaming may not work 
so well when caching data in for autonomous vehicles. 
Moreover, these protocols are not always compatible among 
each other. 
In order to ICN to become commercially viable, the 
authors identified three requirements: 
• 
The network nodes should be able to cache relevant 
amount of data. Consider as "relevant amount of 
data”, data quantities appropriate to the context. 
Hub nodes should be able to store more data than 
the local nodes the users will have at his/hers home. 
• 
These nodes should be widely spread in order to 
ICN to truly show its potential. 
• 
The caching scheme should either be universal, i.e. 
caching regardless to the protocol, or multiple 
protocols that are compatible and can work together 
to complement each other. However, it is necessary 
to point out that caching protocols should be fast in 
order to deliver the requested packets as fast as 
possible. And that this limitation should be in mind 
when designing a caching scheme for ICN. 
D. Performance evaluation 
As shown in Section IV, most of the primary studies 
evaluated their solutions and compared to others. After 
analyzing the experiments performed, some trends were 
noticed. 
Firstly, the majority of studies used a Zipf distribution 
[41] to generate the randomness in the network traffic. It is 
based on the the fact that many types of studied data have a 
similar distribution. This uniformity in input ensures the 
comparisons are unbiased, distribution-wise. 
In order to implement and test the proposed solutions, 
most of the primary studies used network simulators. Here 
are a few simulators related to ICN: 
• 
NS-3 network simulator [42] 
• 
ccnSIM [43] 
• 
ndnSIM [44] 
• 
Icarus [45] 
These aspects should be followed in order to lessen the 
bias and create a more uniform approach to evaluate the 
performance of ICN caching schemes. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The objective of this mapping was to identify and 
analyze studies that contributed to the state of the art of 
Caching Schemes in ICN. In the search phase, 127 works 
were found. From which 20 were considered as primary 
studies, after the phase of quality assessment. These studies 
were then classified regarding the aspects of the solution 
proposed.  
The analysis of these studies showed that there is the 
need of a standardization of the Caching Scheme in ICN. 
Several different approaches were mapped, but none have 
been particularly successful in establishing itself as a 
standard. Most of the proposed approaches were only 
compared to simpler solutions, other than the most 
sophisticated ones. Leaving a gap of how these solutions 
compare to each, performance-wise.  
This mapping shows how ICN can improve the Quality 
of Service in many areas. It also lists the approaches used by 
the studies to try and improve the Caching performance in 
ICN. And which techniques are being used in order to 
validate new Caching solutions.  
Regarding future works, we propose a comparison 
between the mapped solutions in order to point the direction 
to be followed by future researchers of ICN.
