works. Also, we present an application of the
theorem - an idle time model from the com-
puter network practice.

Introduction and statement of the
problem
The modern queueing theory is one of the most
powerful tools for a quantitative and qualitative anal-
ysis of communication systems, computer networks,
transportation systems, and many other technical sys-
tems.
In this paper, we analyze queueing systems,
arising in the network theory and communications the-
ory (called an open queueing network). In this paper,
probability limit theorems are considered by investi-
gating the values of a virtual time of a customer and
an idle time of a customer in an open queueing net-
work.
One of the main directions of research in the the-
ory of queues corresponds with the asymptotic anal-
ysis of formulas or equations, describing the distribu-
tion of this and another probabilistic characteristic of
a queue. For such a development of the analysis, there
must be formulas or equations and besides that an un-
limited convergence of the queue to the critical own
point.
This way, the ﬁrst results about limited be-
haviour of single channel queues in heavy traﬃc are
achieved (see [6, 7]). In the single phase case, where
intervals of times between the arrival of customers are
independent identically distributed random variables
and there is one single device, working independently
of the output in heavy traﬃc, is fully investigated in
well known papers [2, 3]. Probability limit theorems
for a virtual waiting time of a customer in a single
queue are proved under various conditions of heavy
traﬃc (see [8]). Probability limit theorems for a vir-
tual waiting time of a customer in heavy traﬃc and an
idle time of a customer in light traﬃc are closely con-
nected. Also probability limit theorems for the waiting
time of a customer and the queue length of customers
in a multiphase queue are proved under various condi-
tions of heavy traﬃc (see [10]).
So, in the sequel, we present a probability limit
theorem in conditions of light traﬃc for another im-
portant probabilistic characteristic of an open queue-
ing network (idle time of a customer). Note that there
are only some works designed for the investigation of
the idle time of a customer in a single-server queue (see
surveys [16, 18] and paper [17]). Also, note that the
research of the idle time of a customer in more general
systems than the classical system GI/G/1 (multiserver
queue, multiphase queue, open queueing network, etc.)
has just started (see again [16, 17, 18]).
The idle function of computer networks shows in
which part of time the computer network is not busy
(idle).
So in this paper, we present the probability
limit theorem for the idle time of a customer in light
traﬃc in the queueing network. The service discipline
is “ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served” (FCFS). We consider the
open queueing network with the FCFS service disci-
pline at each station and general distributions of inter-
arrival and service time. The queueing network stud-
ied has k single server stations, each of which has an
associated inﬁnite capacity waiting room. Each sta-
tion has an arrival stream from outside the network,
and the arrival streams are assumed to be mutually in-
dependent renewal processes. Customers are served in
the order of arrival and after service they are randomly
routed either to another station in the network, or out
of the network entirely. Service times and routing de-
cisions form mutually independent sequences of inde-
pendent identically distributed random variables. The

basic components of the queueing network are arrival
processes, service processes, and routing processes.
We begin with a probability space (Ω, B, P) on
which these processes are deﬁned. In particular, there
are mutually independent sequences of independent
identically distributed random variables

ing matrix. In the context of the queueing network,
the random variables z(j)

function as interarrival times
(from outside the network) at the station j, while S(j)
n
is the nth service time at the station j, and Φ(j)
n
is a
routing indicator for the nth customer served at the
station j. If Φ(i)
n
= j (which occurs with probability
pij), then the nth customer, served at the station i, is
routed to the station j. When Φ(i)
n = 0, the associated
customer leaves the network.
At ﬁrst, let us deﬁne Ij(t) as the idle time
of a customer at the jth station of the queue-
ing network in time t (time t at which an open
queueing network is not busy (idle) serving cus-
tomers at the jth station of the queueing network),

Idle time function of a computer
network
Now we present a technical example from the com-
puter network practice. Assume that queues of cus-
tomers requests arrive at the computer vj at the rate λj
per hour during business hours, j = 1, 2, . . . , k. These
queues are served at the rate µj per hour by the com-
puter vj,
j = 1, 2, . . . , k. After service by the com-
puter vj, with probability pj (usually pj ≥ 0.9), they
leave the network and with probability pji, i ̸= j, 1 ≤
i ≤ k (usually 0 < pji ≤ 0.1) arrive at the computer
vi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Also, we assume the computer vj
to be idle, when the idle time of the waiting for service
computer is less than kj, j = 1, 2, . . . , k.
In this section, we prove the following theorem on
the idle time function of the computer network (proba-
bility of idle time in a computer network).A computer
network is idle when it is not busy.
Theorem 2. If t ≥ max
1≤j≤k

and conditions (1) - (3)
are fulﬁlled, all computers in the network are idle.
Therefore, using Theorem 1, we get

Let us investigate a computer network which con-

Denote

Note that {Xj = 1} = {Ij(t) < kj},
j =
1, 2, . . . , k.
Assume the structural function of the system of
elements is connected with scheme 1 from k (see, for
example, [2]) as follows:
φ(X1, X2, . . . , Xk) =
(
1,
Pk
i=1 Xi ≥ 1
0,
Pk
i=1 Xi < 1.
Suppose y = Pk
i=2 Xi. Let us estimate the idle
function of the system (computer network) using the
formula of the full conditional probability
h(X1, X2, . . . , Xk) = Eφ(X1, X2, . . . , Xk) =
P(φ(X1, X2, . . . , Xk) = 1) = P(

P(X1 + y ≥ 1) = P(X1 + y ≥ 1|y = 1) · P(y = 1)+
P(X1+y ≥ 1|y = 0)·P(y = 0) = P(X1 ≥ 0)·P(y = 1)+
P(X1 ≥ 1) · P(y = 0) ≤ P(y = 1) + P(X1 ≥ 1)
= P(y = 1) + P(X1 = 1) ≤ P(y ≥ 1) + P(X1 = 1)

P(Ii(t) ≤ ki).
Thus,
0 ≤ h(X1, X2, . . . , Xk) ≤

X
i=1
P(Ii(t) ≤ ki).
(5)
Applying Theorem 1 (with t = 1), we obtain that
0 ≤ lim
t→∞ P(Ij(t) < kj) = lim
n→∞ P(Ij(n) < kj) =
lim

Ij(n) − βj · n

(6)
Then (see (6)),
lim
t→∞ P (Ij(t) < kj) = 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , k.
(7)
So, h(X1, X2, . . . , Xk) = 0. (see (5) and (7)). The
proof of the theorem is completed.
Further, we suppose that the following alternative
conditions are fulﬁlled:
λj +
k
X
i=1
µi · pij > µj, j = 1, 2, . . . , k.
(8)
Let us deﬁne Vj(t) as a virtual waiting time of a
customer at the jth station of the queueing network in
time t, j = 1, 2, . . . , k. Note that this condition guar-
antees that, with probability one, there exists a virtual
waiting time of a customer and this virtual waiting
time of a customer when is constantly growing. One
of the results of the paper is the following theorem on
the probability limit for the virtual waiting time of a
customer in an open queueing network.
Theorem 3. If conditions (8) are fulﬁlled, then
lim
n→∞ P
 
Vj(nt) − βj · n · t
ˆσj · √n
< x
!
=
Z x
−∞
exp(−y2/2)dy,
0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and j = 1, 2, . . . , k.
Proof.
This theorem is proved under conditions
λj > µj, j = 1, 2, . . . , k (see, for example, [12]). Ap-
plying the methods of [15], it can be proved that this
theorem is true under more general conditions(8). The
proof of the theorem is complete.
Applying Theorem 3, we get the following result.
Theorem 4. If t ≥ max
1≤j≤k
kj
ˆβj
and conditions (1), (2),
and (8) are fulﬁlled, the computer network becomes un-
reliable (all computers fail). So, in that case, all the
computers are busy.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.
The proof of the theorem is complete.
Finally,
we
ﬁnd
the
exact
expression
for
h(X1, X2, . . . , Xk), t > 0.
Next, we prove the fol-
lowing theorem on this probability.
Theorem
5
h(X1, X2, . . . , Xk)
is
equal
to
exp(− Pk
j=1 P(Ij(t) < kj)).
Proof. First denote λj, j = 1, 2, . . . , k as inten-
sivities of structural elements, that form a complex
stochastic system. Then the probability of stopping
this system is equal to e−Pk
j=1 λj.
However,
λj = MXj = P(Xj = 1) = P(Ij(t) < kj), j = 1, 2, . . . , k.
(9)
Applying (8), we obtain that h(X1, X2, . . . , Xk) is
equal to
e−Pk
j=1 λj = e−Pk
j=1 P(Vj(t)<kj).

The proof is complete.
As a result, using Theorem 5, it is possible to es-
timate the idle time of a complex computer network.

Concluding remarks and future
research
1.1. Conditions (1)-(3) mean that the number of jobs
arriving at the node of the network is greater than the
number of service jobs at the same node of the net-
work. It is clear from this note, that the length of jobs
in the node of the network is constantly growing with
probability one.
1.2. Conditions (1), (2), and (8) mean that the total
number of jobs arriving at the node of the network
is less than the number of service jobs at the same
node of the network.It is clear from this note, that the
length of jobs in the node of the network is constantly
decreasing with probability one.
2. Now all the cases of traﬃc in computer networks
are investigated – light traﬃc (see Theorem 1), average
traﬃc (see Theorem 3) and heavy traﬃc (see Theorem
2). The investigation of all these cases is new.
3. If the conditions of the Theorem 1 and Theorem 4
are fulﬁlled (i. e., conditions (1) and (8) are satisﬁed),
the network is either idle or busy. Conditions (1) and
(8) are fundamental, - the behaviour of the whole net-
work and its evolution is not clear, if conditions (1)
and (8) are not satisﬁed. Therefore, this fact is the
object of further research and discussion.
4. The theorems of this paper are proved for a class of
open queueing networks in light traﬃc with the service
principle FCFS, endless waiting time of customers at
the each node of the queueing system, and the intervals
between the arrival of customers at the open queue-
ing networks are independent identically distributed
random variables. However, similar theorems can be
applied to a wider class of open queueing networks in
the light traﬃc: when the arrival and service of cus-
tomers in a queue are distributed in groups, also, when
interarrival times of customers at the open queueing
network are weakly dependent random variables, etc.
