Abstract— During the last decades, the potential impact 
of indoor air quality on human health has stimulated an 
interest in hazardous compounds survey, such as carbon 
monoxide (CO). The detection of these compounds has 
consequently become a vital need. To address this issue, 
we propose a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) device 
functionalized with metallocorroles used for the selective 
detection of CO. Here, we insist on the necessity to detect 
CO in the presence of interferents, such as O2 that is 
obviously present in the air, carbon dioxide (CO2) 
present in significant quantity in urban area (400 ppm) 
and humidity (H2O) which is a well-known interferent in 
the case of SAW-based gas sensors. Here, we report on 
the interest of a differential configuration of the sensor 
that takes advantage of accurate organic layers, to 
improve the stability of the sensor’s signal and lower the 
sensitivity to interferents. As an introduction, we 
provide the context of this study and introduce the two 
main components of our sensor, which are the SAW 
device and the metallocorroles.

INTRODUCTION 
Indoor air quality monitoring has become a subject of 
increasing importance since a few decades [1]. Among 
gases (such as CO, CO2, NOx, etc) produced by combustion 
or delivered (such as formaldehyde, benzene, ethylene 
glycol) by furniture, detection of carbon monoxide is of 
great importance due to its characteristic: this colorless, 
tasteless and odorless gas is impossible to detect by human 
beings. Moreover, the LCLo is about 5 000 ppm in 5 minutes 
[2]. The French Institute for Health Surveillance (INVS) 
reports that accidental domestic poisoning by the CO affects 
about 1000 households [3], and is responsible for about 100 
deaths in France each year. So, both individuals and 
industrials interests on that topic have led to the 
development of new solutions to measure carbon monoxide 
concentration in the air [3][4].  
In this paper, a new type of carbon monoxide sensor 
relying on nitrogen-based macrocyclic molecules that show 
a great affinity towards this gas is studied. In this paper, we 
firstly present experimental data to attest the efficiency of 
cobalt corroles to trap CO molecules with high selectivity, 
and secondly, we establish the capability of a Surface 
Acoustic Wave (SAW) device to probe the mechanical 
properties of the corroles layer to reveal the adsorption of 
the target gas. Among the technologies available, we chose 
the SAW devices for their ability to deliver real time 
response, low power consumption, high sensitivity to 
gravimetric perturbation, stability and eligibility in wireless 
sensor [5][6][7]. Their intrinsic lack of selectivity represents 
the major disadvantage of this technology. But we intend to 
overcome that issue by the association with highly selective 
cobalt corroles. Indeed, the robustness of SAW devices in 
delay line configuration allows for the deposition of a 
selective layer compatible with its normal operation [8][9]. 
Finally, we propose a differential configuration for the 
sensor to overcome the sensitivity to outer parameters and 
interferent gases. In that purpose, a reference device based 
on copper corroles was implemented as part of the sensor. 
Measurements of carbon monoxide concentration in the 
100-7000 ppm range in the presence of major interferents, 
such as O2, CO2 and H2O (humidity) were achieved. Based 
on the experimental results, we have shown the capability of 
cobalt corroles as sensing material as well as the interest of 
copper corroles as part of a reference device to improve the 
stability of the phase signal. The advantage of the 
differential configuration in terms of sensitivity and 
repeatability of the measurements is discussed as a 
conclusion. 
In Section II, we describe the configuration and 
manufacturing of the SAW device as well as the gas 
sorption properties of both copper and cobalt corroles used 
for the functionalization of our sensor. In Section III, we 
show CO measurements, in presence of major interferents, 
that 
emphasize 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
differential 
configuration. In the conclusion, based on the presented 
data, we highlight the validity of our approach for the 
development of a selective CO sensor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this section, the design and fabrication of the SAW 
device are briefly described as well as the surface 
functionalization process. The sorption properties of 
metallocorroles are also exposed emphasizing their interest 
for the functionalization of the sensor’s surface.  
A.
Surface Acoustic Wave sensor 
In designing our sensor, we chose a double delay line 
configuration allowing for differential measurement. Fig. 1 
shows the geometry of the sensor composed of these two 
delay lines. Both lines are composed of two Inter-Digitated 
Transducers (IDT) for both generation and detection of the 
acoustic wave at the input and output of the delay line. The 
IDTs are made of aluminum deposited on YXl36 quartz and 
shaped by mean of a lift-off process using negative 
photoresist. In order to allow the Love-mode acoustic wave 
to propagate at the surface of the device, a silica guiding 
layer is deposited by mean of a PECVD technique on top of 
the IDTs. Both IDTs consist of 50 splitted finger pairs with a 
grating period of 10 µm yielding an acoustic wavelength 
equal to 40 µm. The aperture of the delay lines represents 75 
wavelengths and the propagation path length is 5 mm. As the 
wave velocity approaches 5100 m.s-1, the frequency 
operation is in the vicinity of 125 MHz. 
Figure 1. SAW device used for the manufacturing of the gas sensors. 
The first line is coated with cobalt corroles, described in 
the next section, which allows for the selective trapping of 
carbon monoxide. The second line is coated with copper 
corroles, which does not show affinity to carbon monoxide. 
The first will be used to measure the target gas concentration 
and the second will be used as a reference for this 
measurement. The deposition of the metallocorroles is 
achieved by mean of a spray-coating technique. To ensure 
the reproducibility of the deposition process, the amount of 
corroles deposited on the SAW’s surface is monitored by 
mean of the gravimetric sensitivity of the SAW sensor. 
B.
Metallocorroles as functionalization layer 
The 
metallocorrole 
[5,10,15-tris(2,6-dichlorophenyl) 
corrolato]cobalt(III), named here cobalt corrole, was 
synthesized as already described in our previous work [10]. 
The reactivity of the complex was studied by adsorption 
measurements in static and dynamic conditions. The gas 
adsorption isotherms for CO, O2 and CO2 recorded at 298 K 
are shown in Fig. 2a. Solid lines represent the fitting curves 
using a triple-site Langmuir model for CO and a single one 
for O2 and N2. The isotherms show that the cobalt corrole 
presents a high CO uptake and low adsorption capacities for 
N2 and O2. For these two last gases, the uptake values are 
respectively equal to 1.9 cm3.g-1 and 4.8 cm3.g-1, 
respectively. The cobalt corrole shows a CO sorption volume 
equal to 21.9 cm3.g-1 (2.7% (w/w)) at 1 atm and the isotherm 
can be described by a combination of two different 
processes. The first one is assigned to an adsorption 
phenomenon with a high affinity in the low-pressure range 
(0-0.05 atm) thanks to the coordination of one carbon 
monoxide molecule on the cobalt center. These outcomes 
make cobalt corroles an suitable compound for the 
functionalization of the measurement line.

cobalt corrole recorded at 298 K; b) Adsorption isotherms of CO (blue) for 
cobalt corrole compared to CO (green), O2 (pink) and N2 (red) for copper 
corrole recorded at 298 K.  
In view to design a differential configuration of the sensor, 
the use of an accurate organic layer with no affinity for CO is 
required as a reference sample using a two delay lines system 
(vide infra) in order to reduce the outer parameters as well as 
interfering compounds. As a result, the copper complex 
[5,10,15-tris(2,6-dichlorophenyl)corrolato] copper(III) was 
chosen for the reference line, since this complex shows no 
sorption properties of CO (Fig. 2b).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fig. 3 shows the signal on the measurement line 
functionalized with cobalt corroles (red curve) and the 
reference line covered with copper corroles (blue curve). 
One can notice a drift of the phase attributed to outer 
parameters. The black curve represents the differential signal 
obtained by subtracting the phase of the reference to the

phase of the measurement line. This differential signal (green 
curve) shows the compensation of the phase drift that results 
in a stable basic level of the signal.  
Fig. 4 shows a series of measurements of CO 
concentrations in various conditions with (Diff) and without 
(Raw) the use of the differential system. We notice a 
dramatic reduction of the measurements dispersion when 
using the differential system. A statistical characterization of 
these data reveals that the standard deviation induced by CO2
at 20 000 ppm is reduced by a factor 4.5 compared to an 
ideal case in pure nitrogen. In the case of oxygen at 20%, 
which is one of the main interferents, the deviation is greatly 
reduced by a factor 30. These results emphasize the interest 
of a differential configuration of the sensor to improve the 
repeatability of the measurements. It also strengthens our 
will to synthesize organic compounds for the development of 
a well-designed reference line.

red), the reference line (in blue) and the differential signal (in green).  
Figure 4. Influence of the differential acquisition on the repeatability of the 
measurements of 7000 ppm of CO in various carrier gases. Raw data 
represent the signal from the measurement line and the Diff data the 
differential signal. The mean value is represented by the cross. 
The impact of O2 and CO2 at high concentration has been 
determined. As expected from previous works [11], a linear 
correlation between CO concentration, from 100 ppm to 
7000 ppm, and the phase shift velocity undergone by the 
sensor is observed. Experimental results, presented in Fig. 5, 
show that this linear behavior stands regardless of the 
composition of the carrier gas for both measurement line 
and differential sensor. From there, the sensitivity of the 
sensors could be determined. In pure nitrogen, the 
measurement line sensitivity is 263±124 n°/s/ppm. The 
uncertainty on the sensitivity drops dramatically in the case 
of the differential sensor for which the sensitivity is 238±6.5 
n°/s/ppm. It appears that in the presence of 20% of oxygen 
the uncertainty remains equivalent for both sensor 
configurations. In the presence of CO2 at 20 000 ppm the 
measurement line sensitivity is 166±29 n°/s/ppm while the 
differential sensor exhibits a selectivity of 225±3 n°/s/ppm. 
The same characterization was made in the presence of water 
in the carrier gas and a spectacular difference between the 
raw measurements without reference and the differential 
acquisition has been observed. As shown in Fig. 5, the 
uncertainty on the sensor sensitivity is divided by 50 with the 
use of a differential acquisition.

on the sensor selectivity will draw our attention in further

works. Even if the quartz substrate used for the 
manufacturing of the sensor is a temperature compensated 
AT-cut, a sensitivity to temperature may rise from the 
functionalization of the device. The effect of temperature on 
the sensor stability will, consequently, provide a focus of 
work.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this research, we developed an original sensor for 
carbon monoxide monitoring based on a SAW device and 
metallocorroles. This approach takes advantage of the 
intrinsic high sensitivity to gravimetric phenomena of SAW 
sensors, combined with CO selective sorption capabilities of 
the cobalt corroles. Copper corroles have been exploited for 
the development of a dedicated reference line. We have 
shown that the use of a proper reference line as part of a 
differential sensor provides improvement in the repeatability 
of the measurements and allows for the diminution of the 
uncertainty in the sensor sensitivity. These results pave the 
way for the detection of other gases with acoustic waves 
devices 
associated 
with 
dedicated 
functionalization 
compounds for the development of a multi-gas monitoring 
system.
