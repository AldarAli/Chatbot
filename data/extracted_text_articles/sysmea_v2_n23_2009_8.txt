Localization in WiMAX Networks Depending on
The Available RSS-based Measurements
Mussa Bshara, Student Member, IEEE, and Leo Van Biesen, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—Recently,
localization
in
wireless
networks
has
gained a lot of interest; especially after some of the most
interesting positioning application areas have emerged in wireless
communications. The most important are the Federal Communi-
cations Commission (FCC) and the European Recommendation
E112, both of which require that wireless providers should be
able to locate within tens of meters users of emergency calls.
In this paper, ﬁngerprinting-based localization depending on
the available RSS-based measurements has been addressed in
WiMAX networks. Fingerprinting is a good way to overcome
signal propagation peculiarities caused by the propagation en-
vironment. And using the available RSS-based measurements is
of great interest because of their availability during the normal
operation of the standard modems, and the simplicity of obtaining
them. The obtained results show that using the available RSS-
based measurements to locate users in WiMAX networks is
feasible and provides the required positioning accuracy for
most of location-based services (LBS), if ﬁngerprinting-based
approaches are used to obtain localization. The available RSS-
based measurement in the current WiMAX modems is called
SCORE. The term SCORE is used by modem manufacturer to
indicate the quality of the connection between the base station
(BS) and the subscriber station (SS). However, using the actual
received signal strength (RSS) values gives higher accuracy than
using SCORE values, but obtaining them is more difﬁcult and
not feasible using the current modems.

I. INTRODUCTION
T
HERE are several ways to position a wireless network
user. Global positioning system (GPS) is the most
popular way, it provides positioning accuracy that meets all
the known location-dependent applications requirements. The
main problems with GPS -despite that the user’s terminal
must be GPS enabled- are the battery high consumption,
the limited coverage and the latency. The battery high
consumption means that the user can be positioned during
a short period of time. Also GPS performs poorly in urban
areas near the high risings and inside the tunnels, i.e. it has a
poor performance when it is needed the most. And it needs
about 4 minutes (cold start) before the ﬁrst position ﬁx is
available. Another way to position a user, is to depend on
the wireless network itself by using the available information
such as SCORE information [1], or Cell-ID which has been
used widely in global system for mobile communications
(GSM) despite its limited accuracy [2]. One can also make
measurements on the network to obtain localization, some

Electricity and Instrumentation, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium

of these measurements are hard to obtain such as time of
arrival (TOA) which needs synchronization, and some are
easy to obtain such as RSS measurements [3], [4]. Adding
new hardware to the base stations (BSs) to improve the
measurements accuracy (for example using array antennas or
adding localization measurement unit (LMU) to each base
station) can provide high localization accuracy, but this option
suffers from the high roll-out cost. Some of the measurements
can be conducted by the terminal itself, others can be
only obtained by the network. From now on, we will refer
to the measurements as network measurements regardless
where these measurements have been conducted; in the
network itself (network side), in the user terminal (terminal
side) or in both. Many localization approaches depending
on network measurements have been proposed in GSM
networks and sensor networks. Most of the work focused on
range measurements depending on TOA, time-difference of
arrival (TDOA) and RSS observations, surveys [3], [5] and
[6]. These approaches improved potentially the localization
accuracy achieved by using the Cell-ID. The exponential
path loss model which is known as the Okumura-Hata
(OH) model [7], [8] was the ﬁrst approach to be used to
obtain positioning. In [9] the authors propose using statistical
log-normal model of RSS measurements and the sequential
Monte Carlo localization technique, to get better localization
accuracy. In [10] an enhanced object tracking with RSS using
Kalman Filter is proposed by obtaining velocity information
of the mobile sensor node which is used to improve the
accuracy of the tracking. The authors of [11] proposed using
a grid-based centralized localization using RSS to locate a
target using the maximum and minimum path loss exponents.
The proposed method achieves higher localization accuracy
than the conventional localization method using the same path
loss exponent when the distribution of the path loss exponents
over the ﬁeld is uniform, and has worse performance when
the distribution of the path loss exponents over the ﬁeld is
normal distribution. An indoor localization method based
on received signal strength using discrete fourier transform
has been proposed in [12]; the method provided satisfactory
positioning accuracy if the environment stay consistent
from the radio building phase. The ﬁngerprinting approach
which depends on comparing the on-line measurements
obtained by the user with an already built database, proved
to provide better performance than OH alternative [2]. In
[13],[14] the authors used ﬁngerprint approach to mitigate
the effect of multipath components and the inconveniences
related to OH approach to provide better positioning accuracy.
In this paper, we propose using ﬁngerprinting-based local-

ization depending on SCORE observations for positioning in
WiMAX networks. The importance of the contributions of this
paper can be summarized as follows:
• This paper provides a detailed description of all the RSS-
based quantities that can be measured using the current
WiMAX networks.
• The used RSS-based quantity, which is the SCORE, is
new and has never been used before in any localization
approach in wireless networks.
• Introducing an important enchantment to the classical
ﬁngerprinting approach based on the fact that the Cell-
IDs are less affected by the propagation environment than
RSS-based values.
We also argue that this approach meets the requirements
of most of the known LBS such as discovering the nearby
places, whereabouts of a friend, user tracking and many other
services.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses
the positioning possibilities in WiMAX networks. Section III
discusses the RSS-based measurements in the current WiMAX
networks. The ﬁngerprinting-based localization approach de-
pending on RSS-based measurements is discussed in section
IV, and we conclude in section V.
II. POSITIONING POSSIBILITIES IN WIMAX NETWORKS
The topology of WiMAX network is similar to GSM one;
the two of them use base stations to establish a wireless
connection with subscriber stations (GSM terminal or WiMAX
enabled computer for example). And almost the same quan-
tities can be measured using both networks. In WiMAX
networks the following quantities can be used for possible
localization application:
• The Timing Adjust (TA): This concept is similar to timing
advance (TA) or time of arrival (TOA) concept in GSM
networks [15].
• The Time Difference of Timing Adjust (TDOTA): This
concept is similar to the time difference of arrival
(TDOA) concept in GSM networks. The idea of this
measurement is to compare more than one TA values
measured to different base stations to eliminate the mea-
surement error caused by the terminal clock synchroniza-
tion as long as the network is synchronized.
• The Angle of Arrival (AOA): WiMAX uses directional
antennas which allow the determination of the azimuth
of a terminal seen by a certain base station. The current
antennas used in Pre-WiMAX network in Brussels pro-
vide this information as sectors (60 , 90 and 120 degrees).
WiMAX networks started to use advanced antenna arrays
where beamforming allows rotating narrow beams. The
narrow antenna patterns will increase the accuracy of the
measured terminal azimuth.
• The Base Station Identiﬁer (BSID): This concept is the
same as Cell-ID in GSM networks. The position of a
terminal can be determined depending on the serving
base station coordinates. This value can be obtained -by
the terminal- by obtaining the serving base station MAC
address which is broadcasted over the control channel.
• The Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI): WiMAX
terminals can measure the received power broadcasted by
a base station (Extra software needed). This measurement
gives information about the distance between the terminal
and the corresponding base station. The RSSI values
depend on the operating environment and a path loss
model has to be developed for a certain environment.
• The SCORE values: The current standard WiMAX ter-
minals measure the SCORE values of the available BSs.
The SCORE values are related directly to the RSSI
values. However, they can be considered -with some
approximations- as rough RSSI measurements.
In addition, the support of short-range communications
among the terminals (mesh networks) was proposed in
WiMAX networks [15]. The rationale for introducing short-
range communications is mainly due to three arguments:
1) The need to extend the coverage to places not covered
by a base station.
2) Support peer-to-peer (P2P) high-speed wireless links
between the terminals.
3) The need to enhance the communication between a
terminal and the base station by fostering cooperative
communication protocols among spatially proximate de-
vices.
The accuracy of the location estimation can be enhanced
by utilizing the additional information gained from measuring
the relative distances between the terminals. The support
of short-range communications is very attractive, but the
practical implementation is very complicated and has a lot
of complications. Therefore, the use of mesh networks could
be avoided or be limited to security and emergency cases.
For example, a police car (or an ambulance) can establish a
direct connection to other cars; or in case of being outside
the coverage area of the wireless network, a connection can
be established to the main network backbone by using the
available modems in its range.
Therefore, WiMAX networks have all the resources to
locate their subscribers without relying on any external system.
The most attractive resources for localization are the ones that
are easy to obtain and already available during the normal
terminal operation such as RSS-based values.
III. THE RSS-BASED MEASUREMENTS IN THE CURRENT
WIMAX NETWORKS
In this section, we consider the received power measure-
ments. The received power is usually measured in watts (or
dBm) and can be obtained by using special equipments such
as power meters, base station analyzers or spectrum analyzers.
In many applications the use of the mentioned equipments (or
similar ones) is not possible due to many different reasons
including the size and weight, the power consumption, the
usage complications and the price. In real life, the choice of
a certain measurement equipment depends on the application
requirements, i.e., the received power could be measured using

different equipments for different purposes or applications.
For example it could be measured using a small sized and
simple equipment, if the measurement accuracy is enough for
a certain decision or application. Take for example a GSM
terminal, it continuously measures the received power from
the neighboring base stations. It is true that the measurement
accuracy is not that high, but it is certainly enough to decide
the best base station. The same thing applies to WiMAX
modems, they also measure the received power and they use
this measurement to decide the quality of the connection
between the modem and the neighboring base stations. In this
research, we distinguish between three types of RSS-based
measurements:
1) The Received Signal Strength (RSS): The RSS values
represent the actual measured power (in dBm). Usually
they are presented as real values with 2 decimal digits
resolution, however they can be found as integer values
depending on the used measurement equipment. These
values are measured using dedicated equipments such as
spectrum analyzers.
2) The Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI): The RSSI
values are presented as positive integer values. They are

217

obtained by WiMAX modems and are presented only
for the serving BS.
3) SCORE : The SCORE values are obtained by the
standard WiMAX modems simultaneously for all the
available base stations and presented as positive integer
values.
In this research, only the quantities that can be measured by
WiMAX modems are used; i.e, RSSI and SCORE values. And
all the used values were converted to RSS values measured in
dBm as explained in sections III-A and III-B.
A. Converting RSSI values to RSS values
To obtain the actual received power measured in dBm from
RSSI measurements, a calibration table has to be used. For
each used modem (in measurements), a calibration table is
generated. Figure 1 shows the used calibration table in our
measurements (only channel 12 can be found in the provided
table, but in the original table channels 2 and 27 can be also
found). The table contains information about the measured
WiMAX signals, such as channel number (frequency), coding,
Viterbi decoder information etc ..., and it also contains the
equivalent RSS values to a set of RSSI ones. The conversion
from RSSI to RSS is done by searching the calibration table
for the equivalent RSS value to a certain RSSI one.
B. Converting SCORE values to RSS values
There are no available calibration tables that give the
equivalent RSS values to SCORE measurements. Therefore,
the solution is to convert the SCORE values to RSSI ones
using the equation 1, and then using the calibration tables
to obtain the equivalent RSS values in dbm. The relation
between SCORE and RSSI values according to the information
provided by the modem manufacturer is given by the following
equation:
SCORE = (RSSI − 22) − (0.08 × AvgV iterbi)
(1)
Where, AvgViterbi is a value generated by the modem
decoder.
C. Practical issues on obtaining RSS from RSSI and SCORE
values
Using calibration tables directly to convert RSSI values to
RSS is not practical due to the following reasons:
1) Converting a large number of values needs relatively
long time to look up the tables to ﬁnd the equivalent
RSS values to the measured RSSI ones. The processing
power is an issue in portable devices solutions.
2) Finding the exact RSSI values in the calibration table is
not guaranteed. The calibration table is generated for a
set of RSSI values, so it is not guaranteed to ﬁnd all the
measured values in the table. In many cases, only close
values to the exact ones can be found.
3) It is possible - in few cases- to ﬁnd more than one equiv-
alent RSS value to the same RSSI measurement. For
example, in the table shown in ﬁgure 1, the equivalent

RSS values to the RSSI value of 21, are: -107 dBm, -
106 dBm and -105 dBm. And for the RSSI value of 22,
the equivalent RSS values are: -104 dBm, -103 dBm,
-102 dBm, -101 dBm and -100 dBm.
Therefore, to generalize (to take all the possible values into
account) and for the sake of simplicity, a ﬁt curve has been
generated for each channel (i.e., for each curve of the three
conversion table curves shown in ﬁgure 2).
The modem has been calibrated only for three channels:
channel 2, channel 12 and channel 27. The channels have been
chosen to cover the used frequency range, channel 2 is the
lower frequency bound, channel 12 is the middle frequency
and channel 27 is the higher frequency bound. If the number
of the observed (measured) channel does not exist in the
calibration table, the closest channel is to be chosen.
Three curves have been generated depending on the cali-
bration table, one curve for each channel. The ﬁtting equation
is given by:
RSS
=
p1 × RSSI4 + p2 × RSSI3 + p3 × RSSI2
+p4 × RSSI + p5
(2)
The Coefﬁcients p1, p2, p3, p4 and p5 differ from one
channel to another as shown in table I. Therefore, it is enough
to store only the coefﬁcients instead of storing the complete
calibration table. R-square measures how successful the ﬁt
is in explaining the variation of the data; a value closer to
1 indicates a better ﬁt; and RMSE is the root mean squared
error, a value closer to 0 indicates a better ﬁt. One can choose
a less complicated ﬁtting curve (linear curve), but the 4th
degree polynomial curve was chosen, because it gives the
highest R-square value and the lowest root mean squared
error, with a price of only storing few numbers (coefﬁcients)
more.
Obtaining RSS values from SCORE ones requires knowing
AvgViterbi information (refer to equation 1). Unfortunately this
information is not available for all the measured BSs (It is only
available for the serving BS). The available calibration tables
show that the value of AvgViterbi takes considerable values
only for weak signals, and takes the value of zero (or very
small) for strong signals. Thus, setting AvgViterbi to zero will
affect the most the accuracy of low signals. However, this will
make the overall SCORE measurements accuracy lower than
RSSI one.

D. Measurement accuracy
Measuring RSS values directly using advanced measure-
ment equipments (such as spectrum analyzers) is the most
accurate way, it gives the values directly in dBm as real values.
These values will be considered as our reference values to
evaluate the accuracy of the other types of measurements.
1) RSSI measurements accuracy: The RSSI values are less
accurate than RSS values due to the following reasons:
• The RSSI values are integer numbers, i.e., each of the
original values is rounded to the closest integer.
• Using the modem calibration table will produce an ad-
ditional error due to calibration table production and the
conversion error.
• The modem is calibrated only for three channels, for
the lower, medium and high frequency bands, and the
closest channel to the measured one will be used. This
approximation will affect the accuracy of the obtained
values.
• The ﬁtting curves are also approximations to real values,
thus using these ﬁtting curves to convert RSSI to RSS
will affect also the accuracy of the ﬁnal values.
However, the real RSS values (measured directly in dBm by
dedicated equipments) are not used in this research; and from
now until the end of this paper the term RSS will be used to
indicate the RSS values obtained using RSSI measurements.
2) SCORE measurements accuracy: SCORE values are less
accurate than RSSI measurements due to the lack of AvgViterbi
information. Setting this information to any constant value
(such as zero) will affect negatively the conversion accuracy
of some values and keep the accuracy unchanged for the rest
of the values. Thus, some obtained values will keep their
accuracy unchanged and some will lose some accuracy due to
this assumption. This approximation will produce an additional
error in addition to the error resulting from converting RSSI to
RSS. Equation 1 shows that the minimum obtained RSSI value
from SCORE measurements is 22. But when RSSI values are
obtained by direct measurements, values such as 17, 18, 19,
20, 21 can be found, refer to calibration table shown in ﬁgure 1
(recall that the provided calibration table in 1 is only a sample
and doesn’t show all the values and channels).

E. The relation between the measured SCORE and RSS values
in the area under study
The relation between the measured SCORE and RSS values
in the area under study has been studied by computing the
average error and the covariance between the two quantities.
The results show good correlation between SCORE and
RSS values which means that using SCORE values instead
of RSS values is possible, but lower positioning accuracy
is expected. Some antennas (BSs) have better correlation
between the SCORE and RSS values comparing to other
antennas. This is because these antennas have a stronger
signal in the area under study. For example antennas 1,2,3
and 4 have better correlation than antennas 6 and 7 (refer to
ﬁgure 5). Indeed the BSs 6 and 7 are experimental BSs and
have lower transmission power than the rest of the BSs in the
area under study. Also, the correlation is bad for low signals
in all the antennas. This is due to the approximation made
about AvgViterbi value. This value was set to zero while for
low signals AvgViterbi takes large values refer to ﬁgure 1.
Figure 3 and ﬁgure 4 depict the actual RSS and SCORE
values along with the related OH model. The two obtained
OH models show good correlation between the two quantities
and proves that using SCORE values to obtain localization is
plausible.
In this research, the focus is on using the practically avail-
able RSS-based measurements for localization. In fact the only
practically available RSS-based measurements for localization
is the SCORE measurements. Because they are the only RSS-
based measurements that can be obtained simultaneously for
all the available BSs, which is indeed a vital condition for
realistic applications.

IV. FINGERPRINTING-BASED LOCALIZATION DEPENDING
ON RSS-BASED MEASUREMENTS
Localization depending on RSS measurements suffers from
the high variations in signal strength due to the propagation
environment effect on the traveling signal from the transmitter
to the receiver. Therefore, the focus is on ﬁnding localization
approaches that can cope with these variations and minimize
their effect on positioning accuracy. one of the most known

and effective approach is the Fingerprinting.
In general, The received power can be expressed as
Pr = atPt
R2 + nt.
(3)
Where, Pr is the received power, Pt denotes the transmitted
power, at is a constant related to the signal frequency and the
gain of the receiver and transmitter antennas, R is the distance
between the transmitter and the receiver and nt is the noise
component. The previous equation shows that the transmitted
power decades with the distance between the transmitter and
the receiver. This fact has been used to estimate the distance
between the receivers (SSs) and the transmitters (BSs) to
obtain localization. The classical model of RSS measurements
is based on the so-called Okumura-Hata model [7], [8] which
is given as
OH model:
y = PBS − 10α log10(∥pBS − pSS∥2) + n.
(4)
where PBS is transmitted signal power (in dB); α is the
path loss exponent; n is the measurement noise, pBS is the
position of the BS and pSS the position of SS; the standard
∥ · ∥2 norm is used. This model has been used in many
proposed localization algorithms [3], [16], but it suffers from
the following shortcomings:
1) It is global, this means that the used path loss exponent
is not accurate, because it is related directly to the local
environment.
2) The position of the transmitters needs to be known.
3) The transmitted power also needs to be known.
And, the most important is the high signal variations due
to the fading, especially is urban environments where the
multipath phenomena is strongly present. Figure 3 depicts the
actual RSS measurements for one of the base stations in the
area under study and the related OH model. It is clear that
the difference between the actual measured values and the
ones obtained depending on theoretical models (such as OH)
is relatively big and plays an opposing role on localization
accuracy. Therefore, obtaining localization depending on a
certain model will be strongly affected by the difference
between the actual measured values and the values obtained
by using this model. And the more the model can minimize
this difference, the best localization accuracy can be obtained
depending on this model such as in ﬁngerprinting localization.
Currently, ﬁngerprinting-based positioning in wireless net-
works is a new and very active ﬁeld. The key idea of
ﬁngerprinting -as the name says- is that each location has a set
of unique features, and this set of features or the “ﬁngerprints”
will be used to identify a speciﬁc location in the same way a
person’s ﬁngerprint is used to identify him / her. To be able
to use this methodology a database of all the ﬁngerprints has
to be ready and stored on the system as vectors [(x, y), Fv]
where, (x, y) is the location coordinates and Fv is the set of the
considered features in the said location. The features could be
any wireless network related values like: TA, AOA, RSS or a
combination of them. This database implicitly takes care of the
line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) problems that
are difﬁcult to handle [17]; and partially includes the effects
of slow and fast fading. The total effect can be approximated
as a gain in SNR with a factor of ten compared to the OH
model, see [3]. The mentioned database can be built using two
approaches:
1) Collect the “ﬁngerprints” by using direct measurements.
This method gives the most accurate database but it is
time consuming.
2) Predict the “ﬁngerprints” to avoid the time consuming
job by using the radio propagation formulas to predict
the RSS values. This method is not accurate as the
ﬁrst one because it is not possible to model all the
propagation effects.
In this research, the ﬁrst method was adopted, and the RSS
values (the used feature) have been collected from all the
possible roads in the area under study, we assume that the
target or the user is using the public road network (in fact this
assumption has no value in our case as we obtain localization

in the static case). The RSS values were collected by using
a special calibrated modem with extra software installed on
(provided by Clearwire, Belgium). The measurements have
been manipulated and stored in a database for later use. The
area under study is the measurement area shown in ﬁgure 5.
The power maps of all the available sites in the measurement
area have been generated and plotted, see ﬁgure 9. The
mentioned power maps were manipulated and stored in a
database in forms of vectors (RSS vectors). Each vector
contains all the RSS values in a speciﬁc location (x, y); i.e.
the database contains a set of vectors (ﬁngerprints) of the form
[(x, y), RSS1, RSS2, ...RSSn], where n is the number of the
received base stations in the location (x, y).
The localization is obtained during the ﬁngerprinting on-line
phase by ﬁnding the best match between the target’s (user’s)
vector (RSS vector) and the vectors stored in the database
or, in other words, compare the target’s “ﬁngerprint” with all
the database “ﬁngerprints” and choose the best match. The
matching process is based on calculating the distance between
the target’s ﬁngerprint with all the ﬁngerprints stored in the
database, and choosing the ﬁngerprint with the minimum dis-
tance. The current WiMAX modems don’t measure RSS val-
ues, but instead they measure RSS-based values called SCORE
values; therefore, the target’s ﬁngerprint will contain the set
of the received SCORE values, and the online measurement
vector is of the form [SCORE1, SCORE2, ...SCOREm],
where m is the number of the received base stations.
A. Fingerprinting-based localization using SCORE measure-
ments
The on-line target’s ﬁngerprint contains all the received
SCORE values in the target’s current location. A distance
metric approach was used to compare all the “ﬁngerprints”
stored in the database with the target’s ﬁngerprint . In case of
comparing vectors with different lengths (this happens when
some BSs are not received by the target but they already exist
in the database’s vector or the vise versa, when the database’s
vector doesn’t contain some BSs that have been received by the
target); the missing information is considered as not a number
value (NaN) and two approaches were followed:
1) The classical ﬁngerprinting approach: Ignore the NaN
values and compute the distance between the two vec-
tors.

2) The BS-strict ﬁngerprinting approach: Hard punishment
to be applied on the points that have NaN values by
excluding them (the distance between the two vectors
is considered to be inﬁnite). It is called “BS-strict”
because the two vectors must have the same BSs to be
considered.
The SCORE values were obtained using the test points shown
in ﬁgure 6. While choosing the test points, a special attention
has been paid to considering all the possible situations; i.e., in
some points only one BS can be measured (one SCORE value),
in others 2 or more BSs can be measured, etc.... Building
the off-line database is the main concern in ﬁngerprinting
localization. It requires extensive measurement campaigns, and
once it is built, it has to be updated continuously to stay
consistent with the changing environment (new BSs, new con-
structions etc. . . ). More convenient solution than conducting
measurements is to use radio planing programs. This solution
produces less accurate databases but it is preferred in some
cases. Another alternative is to allow users with positioning
capabilities (such as GPS) to contribute on-line to the database.
Some users could be stationary (at home, in the ofﬁce),
others could be mobile users (for example a taxi driver).
This option is a good way to keep the database accuracy
and consistency, and to overcome the direct measurements
difﬁculties. In this research, the off-line database was built
using direct measurements, and the RSS values were chosen
to build the database due to the following reasons:
1) Using radio planning tools produces RSS databases only.
2) Some RSS databases are already available and provided
by some specialized companies for all the available
wireless networks.
3) SCORE values are subject to higher variations than RSS
ones. Because they depend on the signal strength and the
output of the Viterbi decoder.
The two mentioned ﬁngerprinting approaches were applied,
the classical and the BS-strict approach. The obtained results
show that the BS-strict approach performance is slightly better
than the classical one. This is due to the fact that the BSID
values (Cell-IDs values) are more robust against the noise
than the RSS-based values; i.e. the same Cell-ID will be read
regardless the presence of a strong noise or not, but different
RSS-based values will be read.
B. The relation between the positioning accuracy and the
number of the detected base stations
The relation between the positioning accuracy and the
number of the detected BSs has been studied using RSS
values.
Four
positioning
accuracy
intervals
have
been
considered as shown in table II. The percentage of the points
that have one BS (type 1), two BSs (type 2)...etc, has been
calculated for each accuracy interval. It has been found that
for high accuracy intervals, most of the points have 3 BSs or
more; and for low positioning accuracy, most of the points
have only one BS. Figure 8 plots the relation between the
number of the detected BSs and the positioning accuracy.
TABLE II: The relation between the positioning accuracy and
the number of the detected BSs. The percentage of each type
has been calculated in each accuracy interval. The table has
to be read column by column.

2%
Table II gives detailed results about the percentage of
each type in each positioning accuracy interval. For example,
consider type 1 (i.e., the ﬁngerprint vector contains only one
BS), we found that only 25% (17% + 8%) of the points
were positioned in an accuracy less or equal to 50 m against
75% of the points that were positioned with low accuracy
. On the other hand, 67% (49% +18 %) of the points that
have 3 or more BSs were positioned with high accuracy
(≤ 50 m) against 33% of the points that were positioned
with low accuracy. In fact increasing the length of the ﬁn-
gerprints increases their diversity (higher distinction between
the points); and therefore, increases the possibility of making
the right match between the on-line ﬁngerprint and the stored
ones (database). Therefore, the localization accuracy will be
improved by increasing the network density as more BSs will
be available.
V. CONCLUSION
This
paper
has
discussed
using
ﬁngerprinting-based
positioning to locate users in WiMAX networks depending
on SCORE measurements. A novel ﬁngerprinting approach
was introduced depending on the fact that base stations
identiﬁcations numbers (Cell-IDs) are more robust against
the multipath and fading than RSS-based values. The new
approach is called BS-strict because the compared vectors
(i.e., ﬁngerprints) must have the same BS values to match.
The relation between the number of the detected base stations
and the positioning accuracy has been investigated and it has
been found that increasing the network density will increase
the positioning accuracy.
The obtained results show that using SCORE values to
position users in WiMAX networks is feasible with enough
positioning accuracy to satisfy most of the known LBS re-
quirements. The achieved accuracy is obtained in the static
case (static positioning) and the target’s motion information
was not used. In dynamic positioning, the target’s motion
information will be used and better positioning accuracy is
expected. Moreover, using the public road network information
(assuming that the user is always on the road) will produce
additional positioning accuracy improvement [18]. The future
work will focus on improving the accuracy by using the
motion model information in addition to the public road
network information.
