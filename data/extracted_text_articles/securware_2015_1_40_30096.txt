Abstract—Space 
experiment 
“Kontur-2” 
aboard 
the 
International Space Station (ISS) is focused on the transfer of 
information between station and on-ground robot. Station’s 
resources are limited, including communication ones. That is 
why for the space experiment “Kontur-2” it was decided to use 
the methods of priority traffic management. New access 
control mechanisms based on these methods are researched. 
The usage of the priority traffic processing methods allows 
using more efficiently the bandwidth of receiving and 
transmitting equipment onboard the ISS through the 
application of randomized push-out mechanism. The paper 
considers methods of dynamic traffic management and access 
control that are used during international space experiment 
“Kontur-2” performed aboard the ISS.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Access control to the network resources is an important 
task of the information security. Especially it is necessary 
for the advanced modern space applications, for example 
during space experiments onboard the International Space 
Station (ISS). Such digital resources have to be available for 
authorized usage by cosmonauts and the mission control 
center, and protected against unauthorized access. In the 
modern computer networks, including ISS onboard network 
and satellite communicational channels TCP/IP stack is 
used. That is why the informational interaction between 
nodes is occurred using application protocols over virtual 
transport connections. 
As the result, the problem of traffic management and 
access control can be presented as the task of identifying the 
characteristics of virtual connections and traffic control 
using virtual connection content code. This code is 
calculated according to the connection content and it shows 
the requested quality of service (QoS). The complexity of 
this problem is the fact that the content code can be 
calculated exactly only after the virtual connection is 
finished. However, in this case, the access control problem 
cannot be solved, because the access becomes irreversible. 
The paper considers methods of dynamic priority traffic 
management and access control methods that have been 
used in international space experiments performed aboard 
the ISS. The proposed methods are probabilistic, but they 
could improve the effectiveness of information traffic 
management by various control throughput mechanisms of 
such virtual connections. 
To solve the problem of calculating the dynamic content 
code we consider to use the indicator function, whose 
properties depend on: the information model of the network 
resource and the description of the access policy, which 
defines the rights of users and QoS requested by virtual 
connection (VC). 
In this paper, we propose a new approach to access 
control flexibility enhancement based on active queuing 
management mechanism and randomized preemptive 
procedure. In “Kontur-2” space experiment, the offered 
solution was implemented by the access gateway – 
specialized device, based on hardware firewall that realizes 
several functions: 
1) organization of informational interaction between 
robotic devices; 
2) communication with operator; 
3) traffic management; 
4) enforce security policy. 
The access gateway is a two-component device. The first 
part is the firewall, and the second one is the security server, 
which generates access rules and enforces the access policy. 
The adaptability of the proposed mechanism improves 
network security, but it requires large computational 
resources of the access gateway. That is why the security 
server was realized using cloud technologies. Security 
server analyzes network traffic and generates access rules 
for firewall considering current state of connections, 
available resources of internal network, and access policy. 
The parameters of access gateway (firewall) rules 
depend on the set of network environment and/or protocols 
characteristics A. This set can be divided on two classes 
with different access conditions. In proposed approach the 
classification decision is based on access code F and 
firewall has three modes in accordance to possible F (A) 
values (Figure 1): 
 
“–1”, if the data flow is forbidden according to the 
access policy (filtering rules); 
 
“1” and “0” for permitted VCs. 
The state of the virtual connection is controlled 
throughout its lifetime. When the network environment is 
congested or when VCs have different QoS requirements 
the subset of permitted connection has to be divided into 
new subsets with different access codes: 
 
“1” for prior VCs that have low throughput and 
demand low stable delivery time; 
 
“0” for background ones that demand high 
throughput and have no delivery time requirements.

For more accurate data sorting we propose to use 
multiple priority levels. In our space experiment, we 
consider the simplest situation with two priority levels 
(control commands and video data). But it may be not 
enough for some practice tasks so we propose some easy 
ways to increase the number of levels using subsets of 
permitted VCs (see Figure 1).

To provide this classification procedure we have 
proposed active queuing management mechanism, which 
based on randomized preemptive control [1][2]. Therefore 
in the firewall, the data flow throughput and time that 
packets spend in queue (minimum value for priority 
permitted flows and infinity for denied) are the functions of 
randomized control parameter  . 
In this paper, we propose to use the Access Gateway 
with the architecture described in [1]. This architecture 
includes several modules: Network Monitor, Access Policy

Firewall Rules Generator and Firewall that implements the 
rules and manages the traffic flows. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes 
the priority queueing model and basic equations. Section III 
is about practical application of proposed method in space 
experiment “Kontur-2”. Section IV concludes the paper. 
II. MODEL OF NETWORK ENVIRONMENT 
According to the VC models written above we consider 
the preemptive priority queueing system with two types of 
customers. First type of customers has priority over the 
second one. The customers of the type 1 (2) arrive into the 
buffer according to the Poisson process with rate 
1
  (
2
 ). 
The service time has the exponential distribution with the 
same rate   for each type. The service times are 
independent of the arrival processes. The buffer has a finite 
size k  (
1 k  
) and it is shared by both types of 
customers. The absolute priority in service is given to the 
customers of the first type. Unlike typical priority queueing 
considered system is supplied by the randomized push-out 
mechanism that helps precisely and accurate to manage 
customers of both types. If the buffer is full, a new coming 
customer of the first type can push out of the buffer a 
customer of type 2 with the probability  . 
The summarized entering stream will be the elementary

Problems of research priority queueing have arisen in 
telecommunication with the analysis of real disciplines of 
scheduling in operating computers. During the last years, a 
similar sort of queueing model, and also their various 
generalisations are widely used at the theoretical analysis of 
Internet systems. 
As shown in [3], the probability pushing out mechanism 
is more convenient and effective in comparison with other 
mathematical models of pushing out considered in the 
literature. It adequately describes real processes of the 
network traffic and is simple enough from the mathematical 
point of view. The randomized push-out mechanism helps 
precisely traffic management and security [4]. The other 
control and security factor is the telematics device buffer 
size. It can be varied to increase the throughput of necessary 
connections and reduce throughput of suspicious ones.

Exploring these formulas we found some useful 
properties of this system described in this article. When 
incoming stream of priority packets getting more intensive, 
system starts to prohibit admission of non-priority packets. 
While the total flow rate is less than unity (
1
2
1
   
), the 
probability of loss is equal to zero. This means that the 
system is fully copes with the load.  
In Figure 3 an expected result can be seen that the 
probability of losing priority packet decreases with 
increasing size of a buffer. Probability of loss is not 
decreasing more than 5% for small values of  . Therefore, 
only for large probability values increasing buffer size 
effectively influences the losses. For priority stream 
influence of this effect is the same for all values of alpha, 
but for non-priority packets the situation is different. Figure 
6 shows that it is sometimes advantageous to have a buffer 
of smaller size. With a small buffer probability of be pushed 
out much lower, what explains this effect.

In [2] and [3], we have calculated different variable like 
average queue length of priority packets and the relative 
time that the priority packet spend in queueing system. So 
the   parameter is strong enough to influence the filling of 
the queue. 
In [3] it is shown that proposed queueing mechanism 
provide a wide range of control feature by randomized push-
out parameter   and buffer size k. According to the 
packet’s mark (Forbidden, Priority, Background) the period 
that packet spend in queue can vary from 1 to 1014 times, 
which can be used to enforce requested QoS for traffic. For 
highly congested network the priority type is much less 
important, than the push-out mechanism and the value of   
parameter. The push-out mechanism allows enforcing 
access policy using traffic priority mechanism.  
By choosing   parameter we can change the time that 
packets spend in the firewall buffer, which allows to limit 
access possibilities of background traffic. So by decreasing 
the priority of background VCs and increasing the push-out 
probability   we can reduce the VC throughput to low 
level without interrupting it. 
The most wide range of control can be reached in 
intermediate environment conditions when linear law of the 
losses has already been broken, but the saturation zone has 
not been reached yet. Numerical experiment [3] has been 
made to detect conditions in which

III. PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT 
Good example of practical application of such 
mechanism is the problem of controlling remote robotic 
object, which telemetry data and a video stream are 
transmitted on global networks [5]. In this case, control 
commands are transmitted by TCP, and a video stream data 
are transmitted by UDP. A mean values of throughput of our 
robotic object: throughput of TCP channel (control and 
telemetry packets) ~100Kb/s, throughput of UDP video 
stream ~1,2Mb/s. 
 
Figure 5.  The scheme of space experiment "Kontur" 
In a considered example from Figure 5 (ROKVISS 
(Robotic Component Verification on the ISS) mission and 
space experiment “Kontur” [6][7]), the choice of a priority 
of service and loss-probability of a priority packet   allows 
to balance such indicators of functioning of a network, as 
loss-probability of control packets 
)1(
ploss
 and quality of 
video stream for various conditions of a network 
environment. The parameter   can vary for delay 
minimization in a control system’s feedback. 
The given problem is important for interactive control of 
remote real-time dynamic objects, in a case when the 
complex computer network is the component of a feedback 
control contour, therefore minimization of losses and 
feedback delays, is the important parameter characterizing 
an effectiveness of control system. 
The same traffic management system is used in space 
experiment “Kontur-2”, where the operator is onboard ISS 
and robotic system is on Earth surface in Saint-Petersburg, 
Russia and in Munich, Germany (see Figure 6). 
During the space experiments “ROKVISS” and 
“Kontur” that were minutely considered [1][6]-[8], it was 
established that an important component of effective remote 
control for robotic object is a high degree of “dipping” of 
the operator in the robot’s functioning environment [8]. 
Thus a telepresence for operator in such an environment is 
ensured by outputting a video stream coming from the 
camera of the robot into a workplace of operator-cosmonaut. 
Simultaneously the tactile capabilities of the robot are 
reproduced by the special joystick, which is connected with 
the operator through man-machine interfaces with the force-
torque feedback. That is why the development of the space 
experiment “Kontur” was considered a study on the effect of 
weightlessness on the opportunity of operator-cosmonaut to 
control remote robots using force-torque joystick. The 
necessity to send the equipment, which will interact with the 
cosmonauts onboard ISS gives us new requirements for 
reliability and security for all systems’ components, 
including communication channels. 
An actual scientific and technical problem of the new 
space experiment “Kontur-2” is the creation of methods and 
development of the technology for remote control onsurface 
robots and robotics groups from orbiting spacecraft for 
solving planetary exploration. 
The ability to effectively control robots on the surface of 
planets from a manned orbital spacecraft is determined by 
the following factors: 
 
reliability of telecommunication channels used for 
transmitting control commands, telemetry and video 
data between an operator and robot, their capacity 
for reconfiguration and scalability; 
 
performance of communication channels in order to 
minimize the delay of transmitted data; 
 
adequate response of the operator in weightlessness 
to the impact from the joystick with force-torque 
feedback, taking into account the time delays and 
discontinuity of video feedback received from the 
controlled robotic object. 
The study of these factors significantly differs this work 
from the previous ones [7][9]. 
 
Figure 6.  Functional scheme of space experiment "Kontur-2" 
In future this method of preemptive access management 
could be used in new joint space experiment “Kontur-3” 
(New international space experiment) that will be carried 
out on ground and on-board the ISS, in order to research 
efficiency and security of robotic operations in space and 
ground environments, including the configuration of robotic 
control systems as a part of robotic communication network 
[5]. The joint experiments will focus on the analysis of how 
well astronauts can operate complex robotic systems based 
on operation networks with mobility and manipulation 
capability from within the highly constrained ISS and

micro-gravity environment. Multiple human-robot interfaces 
will be used in combination, while simulating realistic 
robotic 
remote 
operations 
with 
round-trip 
time 
communication conditions representative of future human 
planet exploration missions. The structure of data 
transmission of future experiment is presented in Figure 7. 
 
Figure 7.  Data streams in future space experiment "Kontur-3" 
For communication experiments, the primary focus will 
be on the usage of real-time duplex commanding, in 
combination 
with 
Delay 
Tolerant 
Network 
(DTN) 
approaches. Real-time channel will have low delay         
(15-20 ms) and high throughput (4 Mb/s), but the 
connection would be established only when the space 
station is in the radio-optical range (7-10 min). DTN 
channels have high delay and low throughput, but function 
for 24/7. 
To enforce access policy and provide information 
security we had to consider the use of various 
communication channels in future experiments. That is why 
the access gateway has two levels of filtering: static and 
dynamic. Static level allows us to control unchanging policy 
requirements (such as the use of white lists IP addresses and 
user authentication process). Dynamic control checks 
suspicious actions of the permitted users, as well as controls 
transmitted data, taking into account the used transmission 
channels and the QoS requirements. Some components of 
the system have been worked out by us in the framework of 
a contract with Ford Motor Company [8][10]-[12]. 
The basis of every robotic operation network is high-
performance cloud, which is used to decompose the 
complex 
task 
from 
operator 
and 
to 
monitor 
its 
implementation by each robot. So robotics objects within 
multipurpose operation network 
would execute the 
programs and interact without human involvement. 
However there would be always situations when the robot 
could not make a decision by its own. In that case the 
human-operator will have two main opportunities: 
1) remote telecontrol through real-time channel; 
2) to send new program through DTN. 
 
Figure 8.  Robotic cloud platform with heterogeneous computing 
resources 
Heterogeneous cloud platform provides not only remote 
access for computing resources or applications, but also 
intelligent services. Using the resources of modern cloud-
based engineering centers it is possible to create equivalent 
social networks that bring together multiple agents to 
perform coordinated actions, computation, verification of 
test results based on the use of different materials, virtual 
prototyping, and data visualization. These problems, from 
the point of view of the computational algorithms, can be 
combined into chains, which form a network of operations. 
Their implementation is provided within a heterogeneous 
cloud. The components of the platform (see Figure 8), based 
on the OpenStack, include: IaaS cloud class segment, 
computing infrastructure within the cluster, the specialized 
high-performance hybrid system based on reconfigurable 
computing nodes. 
Virtualization has changed the approach of deploying, 
managing, and using enterprise resources by providing new 
opportunities 
for 
consolidation 
and 
scalability 
of 
computational resources available to applications; however, 
this leads to the emergence of new threats posed by the 
complexity and dynamic nature of the process of resources 
provisioning. These threats can lead to the formation of 
cascade security violations, which traditional data protection 
systems are unable to deal with. The existing approaches 
such as “Scan and Patch” do not work in a cloud 
environment — network scanners cannot track changes of 
13

resources configuration in real time. These approaches do 
not accurately identify the change in level of risk and take 
steps to block dynamically emerging threats. 
To solve the problem of controlling access in the cloud, 
it is necessary to continuously monitor resources, and it 
cannot be achieved without the automatic generation of 
rules for filtering and firewall log files analysis. Information 
security management products in a dynamic cloud 
environment should include mechanisms that provide: total 
control over processes for deploying virtual machines; 
proactive scanning the virtual machines for the presence of 
vulnerabilities and configuration errors; tracking the 
migration of virtual machines and system configuration to 
control access to resources. Therefore, within the space 
experiment "Kontur-2" series of measures are set out to 
improve information security resources, namely: 
 
Enhanced Control of virtual machines. Virtual 
machines as active components of the service are 
activated in the cloud application random moments, 
and Administrator cannot activate or deactivate a 
virtual machine until the security scanner checks the 
configuration and evaluates the security risks. 
 
Automatic detection and scanning. Information 
security services are based on discovery of 
vulnerabilities in the computing environment. This 
discovery in turn is based on the current virtual 
machine configurations and on reports of potential 
threats that come from trusted sources, such as 
antivirus update servers. 
 
Migration of virtual machines. Proactive application 
migration is an effective method to control security. 
Each of these data will have its own priority level. 
The number of priorities could be increased by using 
the recursive application of prioritization method 
described above. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The paper illustrates one of the possible applications of 
access control and traffic management approach in the tasks 
of robotic remote control in space experiment “Kontur-2”. 
Proposed model considers computer network as the set 
of VCs, which throughput is easy controlled by proposed 
classification procedure and algorithm that divides the set of 
non forbidden VCs in two subsets: non forbidden priority 
connections and non-forbidden non-priority ones or 
background connections. 
In this paper, we considered in detail the preemptive 
queueing mechanism, which provides a wide range packet 
loss probability ratio using flexible randomized push-out 
algorithm. The most interesting result obtained in congested 
network allows keeping priority VC throughput near the 
requested value, which is important for specific space 
experiment onboard ISS. 
Described a practical application example of proposed 
model in joint space experiment “Kontur-2” onboard ISS 
where several types of operations are serviced by access 
gateway in robotic communication network. 
Proposed an architecture of access gateway for robotic 
cloud platform with heterogeneous computing resources that 
expected to be used in future space experiments onboard 
ISS.
