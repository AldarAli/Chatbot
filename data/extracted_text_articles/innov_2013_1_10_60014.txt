Abstract— To increase the throughput of transmission systems, 
MIMO-OFDM technology allows for a better reach and rate of 
transmission and improves the reception. The synchronization 
between the transmitter and the receiver has become a big 
challenge. A bad timing synchronization causes the loss of a lot 
of information in a MIMO-OFDM system. In this paper, we 
propose a novel compact preamble structure based on 
orthogonal CAZAC sequences. Simulations results show that 
the proposed solution presents a good performance at a low 
SNR in AWGN and multipath fading Rayleigh channels. 
Keywords- MIMO-OFDM system; Timing synchronization; 
CAZAC sequences; Compact preamble.

 INTRODUCTION  
The world of wireless communications and mobile 
communication is currently at a very important crossroads in 
its evolution. This crossroads introduces a variety of 
challenges such as multi-path signal reflections, and 
interference. These can reduce the performance of a receiver. 
To address these challenges, Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation combined with Multiple 
Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) is proposed in 802.11n [1]. 
 
The OFDM [2]-[5] is a transmission technique of 
distributing 
symbols 
on 
multiple 
orthogonal 
carrier 
frequencies. To transmit a signal, OFDM divides a frequency 
range into several closely spaced sub-carrier frequencies to 
carry data thanks to the Fast Fourier Transform's algorithm 
(FFT). The Inverse Fast Fourier Transformer (IFFT) 
algorithm is also used to demodulate the message at the 
receiver. 
 
The main advantage of OFDM system is the 
orthogonality between subcarriers. The orthogonality of 
frequencies is primordial to eliminate the Inter Carrier 
Interference (ICI). The ICI occurs, especially, when the 
duration of a symbol is short compared to the delay spread 
involved by the channel. On the other hand, it should be 
noted that the most important disadvantage of the OFDM is 
the 
sensitivity 
to 
Doppler 
shift 
and 
frequency 
synchronization problems. 
 
MIMO technique can be divided into two main 
categories: Space Time Code (STC) and Space Division 
Multiplexing (SDM). SDM transmits independent data 
streams over different transmit antennas. SDM can increase 
throughput rate of wireless communication links between 
transmitter and receiver. Foshini et al. [6] and Telatar [7] 
have shown that the theoretical capacity of the MIMO 
channel, with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas, 
increases linearly with min(Nt, Nr). MIMO systems are 
mainly 
used 
to 
increase 
the 
flow 
of 
wireless 
communications. The STC increases the performance by 
sending redundant data over different transmit antennas [8].  
 
In this paper, we will focus on Space-Time Block Code 
(STBC) [9] [10]. Several applications, based on MIMO 
technology, are already considered in wireless and local area 
networks, and 3rd and 4th generation of mobile network. The 
combination of MIMO-OFDM systems is proposed in the 
standard of wireless LAN IEEE 802.11n [1], where the 
objective is to achieve 100 Mbps for video applications. 
 
One of the main challenges for MIMO-OFDM system is 
the synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Two 
types of synchronization are necessary, the timing and the 
frequency synchronization. The frequency synchronization is 
based on the detection of the frequency offset between the 
transmitter and the local oscillator at the receiver [11], while 
the coarse timing synchronization detects the arrival of the 
OFDM frame and the fine timing synchronization needed to 
detect the beginning of OFDM symbols.  
 
In the literature, several synchronization approaches have 
been proposed for OFDM and MIMO-OFDM systems [12]-
[16]. The main idea is the use of good synchronization 
preamble, at the transmitter, in order to detect the packet 
arrival, at the receiver. 
 
In this paper, we propose a novel compact preamble 
structure for timing synchronization in MIMO-OFDM 
systems using Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation 
(CAZAC) sequences. The CAZAC sequences [17] are a 
class 
of 
complex-valued 
sequences 
with 
cyclic 
autocorrelation equal to zero. The main characteristics of 
CAZAC sequences are their Zero Auto-Correlation; it means 
that a CAZAC code is always orthogonal with its cyclic 
shifted versions. Furthermore, they have constant amplitude. 
The main benefits of CAZAC sequences are the reduction of

Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), they avoid interferences 
between multiple antennas, and have a lower Peak-to-
Average Power Ratio (PAPR). As a result, CAZAC 
sequences 
are 
regarded 
as 
preamble 
for 
timing 
synchronization in MIMO-OFDM systems. 
 
Based on this approach, a compact preamble design for 
synchronization in distributed MIMO-OFDM Systems has 
been proposed in [18]. Wang et al. [18] have designed 
training symbols based on exclusive subband. The main 
drawback of this approach is that this approach is limited 
when the number of transmit antennas increases. With a 
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of 15dB, [18] shows a good 
timing synchronization. On the other hand, our proposed 
method at low SNR shows a perfect synchronization against 
the proposed method in [18]. 
 
The aim of this paper is to present a novel timing 
synchronization approach based on CAZAC sequences. 
Section II briefly describes the MIMO-OFDM system 
structure based on STBC code. The proposed method and 
preamble structure are presented in Section III. Simulation 
results and conclusion are given in Sections IV and V, 
respectively. 
 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
Like any telecommunications system, MIMO-OFDM 
system consists of a transmitter, a channel, and a receiver. 
Figure 1 presents a MIMO-OFDM system with Nt transmit 
antennas and Nr receive antennas using M-ary Modulation 
and N subcarriers per transmit antenna. A parallel data 
stream is generated by data generator’s block. The parallel 
data is encoded according to a QAM constellation and 
distributed over different sub carriers with OFDM 
modulator. The output of the OFDM modulator is fed into 
STBC encoder in order to encode the data stream with 
Alamouti encoder [9].

Then, we apply the IFFT on these symbols to convert the 
signal into time domain. A cyclic prefix (CP) is appended to 
the beginning of each OFDM data symbol, containing a 
copy of the latest samples. 
 
A synchronization preamble is added at the beginning of 
each OFDM frame. The preamble may be generated in the 
time domain [19] or in the frequency domain. In our case, 
the preamble is generated in the frequency domain. At the 
receiver, the synchronization is performed in the time 
domain.

presented to remove the cyclic prefix, because it has no

PROPOSED METHOD 
The proposed frame timing synchronization method aims 
to estimate the beginning of the OFDM received frame and 
to detect the beginning of OFDM symbol. Our timing 
synchronization method relies on sending a preamble 
structure performed in the frequency domain, as shown in 
Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2. Preamble Structure in Frequency Domain 
  
The combination of a CAZAC sequence with its minus 
conjugate (-Conj) gives a time-domain complex envelope 
form that have a good autocorrelation and cross-correlation 
functions. 
This 
combination 
does 
not 
destroy 
the 
orthogonality between subcarriers, and it retains the 
orthogonality between different transmit preambles over 
different transmit antennas. The preamble structure in time 
domain is presented in Figure 3.   
 
Different orthogonal preambles are transmitted on each 
transmit antenna Ti, as shown in Figure 4. Each preamble 
contains a CAZAC (C) sequence mapped on the odd 
subcarrier, and the "-Conj" of C is mapped on the even 
subcarrier. The length of each sequence LC is:

SIMULATION RESULTS 
The simulations have been done, in both AWGN channel 
and multipaths fading channel, to evaluate the performance 
of our proposed preamble against existing preamble. A 
Single-Input/Single-Output 
(SISO) 
and 
MIMO-OFDM 
systems up to 8x8 transmit and receive antennas were 
simulated. An OFDM system with 512 and 1024 subcarriers 
(LFFT=512, LFFT=1024 resp.) was considered in Rayleigh 
multipath fading channel with 6 paths sample-spaced with TS 
(Sampling Time), suggested by the IEEE 802.11 Working 
Group [20]. The simulations parameters are summarized in 
Tables I and II.

At each jth receive antenna a correlation function 
rjseq j
(7), in time domain, is applied in order to detect the 
synchronization point. Due to the distribution of CAZAC 
sequence C and 
C*
 in each preamble, the correlation 
between received signal and the local sequence may give a 
high peak's value.  
 
By correlating the received signal rj with a local sequence 
seqj at each receive antenna Rj, a timing synchronization 
estimate (

The

successful 
timing

synchronization PSYNC is evaluated in Figures 5 and 6. The 
figures showed the acquisition probability for different 
OFDM systems (SISO-OFDM 1x1, MIMO-OFDM up to 
8x8), using CAZAC sequences.  The lengths of preamble are 
1024 and 512, respectively (LFFT=1024, LFFT=512 resp.). 
 
 
Figure 5. Timing synchronization performance of the proposed method 
(LFFT=1024) 
 
Figure 5 shows that the system has achieved a 
synchronization probability over 95% at an SNR=-5dB for 
both SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM 2x2 systems. For a 
MIMO-OFDM 4x4 system the PSYNC > 95% at an 
SNR=0dB. On the other hand, for MIMO-OFDM 8x8 
system the acquisition probability PSYNC reaches 90% at an 
SNR=0dB.

In Figure 6 and for LFFT = 512, it should be mentioned 
that the acquisition probability PSYNC is greater than 99% for 
both SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM 2x2 systems at an 
SNR=-5dB,  and PSYNC>90% for MIMO-OFDM 4x4 system 
at an SNR=0dB. For MIMO-OFDM 8x8 system the PSYNC 
reaches 80% at an SNR=3dB. 
 
For MIMO-OFDM systems, the limitations of all timing 
synchronization methods, are the large number of transmit 
antennas and the length of the synchronization preamble.  
 
The simulation results of our proposed method (Figure 5) 
show a good performance in terms of timing synchronization 
acquisition probability for MIMO-OFDM system up to 8x8, 
where the length of preamble is equal to 1024 (samples). A 
degradation of performances in term of PSYNC (Figure 6) is 
observed when the length of preamble is smaller than the 
length used in Figure 5. The degradations of PSYNC, for a 
large number of transmit antennas, are due to the length of 
the synchronization preamble. Otherwise, at the receiver, as 
the length of the preamble is longer, the value of the 
correlation peak is higher. 
 
 
 
Figure 7. Comparisons between the proposed approach and subband-based 
preamble [18] 
 
In Figure 7, we compared the performance between our 
proposed approach and the synchronization scheme of [18], 
based on a compact preamble design for synchronization, 
using Zadoff-Chu sequences [17] to generate the training 
preamble in distributed MIMO-OFDM systems. At a low 
SNR and by using the same simulation parameters presented 
in Tables I and II, our proposed method has a good 
performance against those obtained by [18]. The acquisition 
probability PSYNC of our method is greater than 90% at an 
SNR > 3dB for both MIMO-OFDM 2x2 and 3x3 system, 
while the method proposed by [18] shows that the 
acquisition probability is between 50% and 75% at the same 
SNR value.    
V. 
CONCLUSION 
One of the main challenges in a MIMO-OFDM system is 
the synchronization. We proposed a novel compact preamble 
structure, in order to detect the timing frame synchronization. 
At the receiver, and due to the combination of CAZAC 
sequence C and –C*, the correlation function between 
received signal and local sequence shows a good frame 
detection with a large number of transmit antennas. In 
comparison 
to 
the 
subband-based 
preamble 
timing 
synchronization method proposed by [18], our approach 
presents a better timing frame synchronization at a low SNR. 
This approach can be implemented in MIMO-OFDM 
systems, with a large number of transmit antennas.
