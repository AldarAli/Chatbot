Abstract—Data are growing rapidly, and technological 
breakthroughs are adding new methods and strategies to tackle 
big data. Thus, research challenges exist to explore the value of 
big data in supporting improved decision-making and public 
service delivery across various industries. In recent years, many 
countries have started to utilize Open Government Data (OGD) 
in developing open environments and platforms to improve 
their economies, enabling small and medium enterprises (who 
may lack the resources to undertake their independent market 
analysis) to use them. Qatar is no exception; it has begun to 
promote and make it available to everyone, including small and 
medium-sized companies. That is due to the potential economic 
returns and enhanced transparency. This research looks at 
aspects of OGD and the situation in Qatar. In addition, we 
collected data from various organizations and stakeholders 
using two questionnaires. The key goals of the two independent 
questionnaires were to investigate the amount of knowledge of 
OGD as a concept, how Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) 
in Qatar perceive present OGD platforms, and how OGD may 
be improved to fulfill the requirements of SMEs. Further, 
regardless of gender or educational level, most Qatari youth and 
adults reacted positively to using OGD.

 INTRODUCTION 
SMEs adopt data analysis and management tools, enabling 
them to visualize information by synthesizing data from 
multiple value chain processes [1]. In addition, introducing 
and utilizing Big Data in any SME requires establishing a 
model to gather and analyze the data. A good data analysis 
model will help analyze raw data sets to understand and 
realize the information they contain and discover patterns in 
the data to derive valuable insights. Furthermore, adopting a 
data analysis model aims to overcome data handling difficulty 
and exploit the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity 
elements that necessitate a significant data flow in a 
constantly evolving system [2]. It generates a convenient 
analysis to solve the challenges caused by a growing amount 
of data. Further, with the appropriate data analysis model, 
SMEs can maximize their performance effectively, cutting 
costs by developing more efficient ways to conduct business 
and maintaining enormous volumes of data. SMEs using 
readily available data to provide high-quality services will 
advance in a competitive climate. Therefore, utilizing Big 
Data is an opportunity for SMEs to innovate and offer value-
added services to their customers. 
 Furthermore, governments are seeking new ways and 
methods to support diversification and promote SMEs in the 
economy. Using data analysis and management platforms 
allows governments to understand the needs of their citizens 
better, eliminate systemic flaws, and improve operations, 
cutting costs and boosting the services provided by any 
government entity [3]. OGD can help maximize the benefits 
of using big data. In addition, OGD is a subset of open data 
and is government-related data open to the public [4]. It refers 
to publicly accessible information about the government [2]. 
Multiple datasets, including those related to finance, 
population, geography, the public, transportation, traffic, 
education, etc., may be included in government data. 
The economy of Qatar is among the most robust in the 
region and one of the most promising in the world. Qatar 
maintained balanced growth rates in the face of global 
concerns, and its GDP increased by more than 12% in the third 
quarter of 2021 compared with the first. According to the 
policies put in place by the Qatar National Vision 2030, which 
aims to lay the groundwork for a competitive and diversified 
knowledge-based economy, Qatar has succeeded in bolstering 
its economic standing on the global stage over the past few 
years [5]. Moreover, the Qatari government promotes using 
Open Data to encourage openness, public participation, better 
governance, inclusive economic growth, and innovation in 
Qatar [5]. 
SMEs utilize OGD for different reasons. However, due to 
limited resources, SMEs, particularly small start-ups, need 
help to use big data analytics effectively [4]. SMEs throughout 
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Qatar are still in the 
early stages of using OGD [6]. They encounter a number of 
difficulties when implementing OGD, including the fact that 
the datasets are not updated frequently and are only available 
in unprocessed formats, there is no interpretation or clear 
description for these datasets, the majority of the datasets are 
only available in Arabic, some GCC countries lack a clear 
OGD policy and classify OGD under other topics, users are 
discouraged from adding to the datasets, and the formats and 
interactive maps and usability are limited. 
The current OGD platforms, generally and in GCC 
countries mainly, only employ data from government 
agencies; they do not mix data from other sources, such as 
third-party data and social media, with analytics. The OGD 
lifecycle classification was one of the most significant 
categories lacking. In other words, these difficulties should be 
categorized according to the various stages/phases of the 
OGD lifecycle. Furthermore, they might be classified based 
on the actions performed at each step of the OGD lifecycle. 
As a result, the decision maker or end user may effectively 
track, monitor, and address the difficulties. 
As a result, the Qatari government needs to provide SMEs 
with an OGD platform to use big data analytics to achieve

more innovation and growth. The required OGD platform 
must give more than the available platforms and state-of-the-
art currently allows. The government, companies, and the 
general public via social media are the most known data 
sources. With the help of these various data sources, SMEs 
will be able to capture the information needed that will aid 
them in analyzing trends and seeking new business 
opportunities [7]. Information acquired from social networks 
and other sources should be merged with public data. 
This paper provides research into the use of OGD and the 
deployment of OGD in Qatari SMEs to investigate the Qatari 
government’s and SMEs’ readiness for employing OGD. Two 
separate surveys were undertaken to measure the amount of 
understanding of OGD as a concept, as well as how SMEs in 
Qatar perceive the present OGD platforms and how they could 
be improved to fit their needs. 
To do this, we developed the following research questions, 
which will be addressed in this paper: 
 
What is the level of awareness in the public and 
private sectors about OGD? 
 
Are there policies and practices to encourage the use 
and publication of GD in Qatar? 
 
Is data mainly supplied directly, indirectly, or both 
on Qatar's Open Data Portal? 
 In this research, firstly, we selected different types of 
organizations 
to participate 
in 
the data collection. 
Organizations may be governmental, semi-governmental, or 
private. We assume that the selection of varying organization 
types may affect the data collection method and the procedure 
for 
requesting 
accessibility 
for 
both 
organization’s 
stakeholders and data; secondly, the choice of stakeholders 
that will participate from these organizations. The 
organization’s type and the stakeholder’s background and 
experience may impact their responses, recommendations, 
decisions, and selections. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
presents the related background for OGD, its terms, OGD pros 
and cons. Section 3 introduces the methodology used in our 
study and the surveys that were undertaken. Section 4 presents 
the evaluation process and the analysis of the results. Finally, 
we give our conclusions in Section 5. 
II. 
BACKGORUND AND RELATED WORK 
A. OGD Terminology 
Many concepts are related to OGD, such as open data, 
public data, e-government, linked data, and data portal. 
Firstly, there is a need to differentiate between open data, 
public data, and OGD. 
1) Open data: The open definition states the principles 
and guidance that open data should conform to regarding data 
and content [8]. Open indicates how anyone can freely 
access, use, reuse, and redistribute data for any purpose 
regarding the requirements that preserve provenance and 
openness. Therefore, data is published in open data format, 
machine-readable, platform-independent, and open to the 
public without restrictions or under an open license [8]. 
Therefore, open data refers to data that is free of charge to the 
public without limitations [9]. Open data is considered a key 
enabler of open government [2]. 
2) Public data: public data is made freely available to the 
public but only sometimes open. An example of public data 
is the archive of legal documents, which are accessible freely. 
On the other hand, if these public data are organized in a 
digital format, sorted and indexed, and made available online 
in a standard format. This public data will be open also. Open 
data contains heterogeneous data from several sources. So, 
there is a need for a body to host these data centrally, and the 
government is a clear choice. 
3) OGD: OGD is a subset of open data and is 
government-related data open to the public [2]. Government 
data might contain multiple datasets such as finance, 
population, geographical, public, transportation, traffic, 
education, etc. [10]. [11] defined another definition for OGD 
as follows: “Open data is data that anyone can access, use, or 
share. Simple as that. When big companies or governments 
release non-personal data, it enables small businesses, 
citizens, and researchers to develop resources which make 
crucial improvements to their communities.” 
Secondly, other terms such as e-government, linked data, 
and data portal are defined, which also relate to OGD. 
1) E-government: there are many definitions of e-
government existing in the literature; the one related to the 
government’s use of technology is used to improve its offered 
services to other entities, including citizens, employees, 
partners, suppliers, and other government agencies [12]. 
Therefore, by supporting the connection between citizens and 
their government, e-government can develop better 
relationships and deliver information and services more 
efficiently. While initially, e-government just referred to the 
presence of government on the Internet as an informative 
website; the concept has since evolved. With the introduction 
of the ‘open government’ concept, open government data 
initiatives are considered a subset or an extension of e-
government [13]. 
2) Linked data: it is the process of following a set of best 
practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the 
web [14]. Linked data refers to data that is published on the 
web, and it is also connected to other external datasets. 
3) Data portal: the open data movement targets making 
data open for government and public sector information to 
boost its reuse. A typical implementation is to gather and 
publish datasets into central data portals or data catalogs to 
provide a “one-stop-shop” for data consumers [15]. While a 
data catalog would act as a registry of data sources, providing 
links, a data portal is more commonly a single entry point 
hosting the actual data, where end users can, search and 
access the published data and interact with it suitably [16]. 
One of the main functions of a data portal is the 
administration of metadata for the datasets, potentially 
including metadata harmonization. Different tools are

enabled on government data portals, for example, data format 
conversion, visualization, query endpoints, etc. Therefore, 
Open Data Portals (ODP) are essential, and the solution will 
provide an ODP with a data analytics framework for SMEs. 
III. 
USE SMES MOTIVATIONS FOR THE UTILIZATION OF 
OGD 
A. Generated Economic Value Through Open Data 
Open data is already contributing to the economic growth 
of countries worldwide [23][24]. They also support creating 
and strengthening new markets, companies, and jobs [19]. 
Government plays a vital role in creating value from open 
data, not only in its publication stage. Organizations can create 
value with open data in various companies and industries in 
three ways [20]: for traditional companies or new non-
technological startups to make decisions, in the same way as 
their governments use open data to improve decision-making, 
the same can happen for the vast private sector; to generate 
new products or services that create value for the clients of the 
companies; and to be accountable in a market where 
consumers require more information and reward transparent 
companies: by releasing data, companies can guarantee that 
their actions are transparent [13]. 
B. Promote Greater Openness of Public Data  
One of the mechanisms available to the government to 
encourage the use of open data by the private sector is to 
strengthen the supply of these data in quantitative and 
qualitative terms. In South Korea, the government has 
promoted a series of measures to promote open data, allowing 
the development of many digital applications from public 
open data. One of the most active Open Data sites is the Seoul 
Open Data Plaza (data.seoul.go.kr), managed by the 
metropolitan government of Seoul [21]. In 2012, Seoul 
initiated an open data initiative sharing public information to 
create diverse business opportunities for the private sector and 
develop IT industries. This portal is an online channel to share 
and provide citizens with all public data of Seoul, such as real-
time bus schedules, subway schedules, Wi-Fi public service 
places, and facilities for disabled people, among others [22], 
[23].  
C. Promote or Regulate the Opening of Data in Other 
Sectors 
Governments, international organizations, and civil 
associations have been at the forefront of open data 
proliferation and openness [18]. As governments have 
adopted the open data agenda, citizens and consumers demand 
transparency in other sectors, such as business, academia, and 
government organizations [24]. As noted in this document, 
data has become the currency of modern economics. A recent 
study published by the "Future of Privacy Forum" 30 projects 
that the global data volume will grow from approximately 0.8 
zettabytes (ZB) in 2009 to more than 35 ZB in 2020 [25]. 
Likewise, the government can play a role in encouraging 
companies to share their data safely and respectfully regarding 
the privacy of consumers and citizens [26]. Universities and 
academia (in their various institutions such as science and 
technology agencies) also have to take a step forward to 
publicize and give access to their data in different formats to 
other societal actors [27]. 
D. Promote Data Entrepreneurship 
The recent success story of ODINE (Open Data Incubator 
Europe) 32 and the well-known emergence of data ventures in 
the United Kingdom and the United States have demonstrated 
the opportunity to generate value, scalability, and profits with 
open data ventures. In Latin America, there are also cases of 
successful data ventures that have received foreign investment 
and have grown in the last 5 years, for instance, OPI, Data4, 
and Atlantia [25]. Moreover, in the United Kingdom, the 
government has offered open government data of the highest 
quality through data.gov.uk. The Open Data Institute (ODI), 
in its Open Data Means Business research, has analyzed 270 
companies in the United Kingdom that use, produce, or invest 
in open data as part of their business strategy. These 
companies (also called "open data companies") invoice more 
than 110 billion dollars a year and employ more than 500 
thousand people [26]. 
IV. 
CHALLENGES AFFECTING SMES FULL UTILIZATION 
OF OGD  
A set of classifications and categories for the challenges 
that prevent SMEs in the GCC region from utilizing the OGD 
effectively are discussed. Saxena [6] applied the models 
which have been developed to the status of OGD in the GCC 
countries [28]. Sieber and Johnson have introduced four 
models of open data that define the relationship between 
citizens and government (also called the Citizen engagement 
model of OGD) [29]; for more details about the benefits and 
costs of these four models (See [29]). 
1) Data over the wall - Government publishing of open 
data: the government publishes open data via an online open 
data portal that acts as a unidirectional conduit from the data 
owner/collector (government, community, organization) to 
the end user (citizen, community organization, or private 
sector). 
2) Code exchange - Government as open data activist: the 
government supports the reuse of open data to directly extract 
or create value from its offering, e.g., through app 
development contests. 
3) Civic issue tracker - Data from citizen to government: 
the government accepts direct feedback from citizens on a 
limited range of issues in a crowdsourcing paradigm. Data 
may or may not also come from the government. 
4) Participatory open data - Open data as open 
government: the government-citizen co-production of data 
where open data becomes a direct conduit between citizen 
and government, where citizen contributions are dynamic, 
and the government becomes responsive to demand-side 
requests for data. 
According to [6], most GCC countries fall into the first 
model outlined above, “Data over the wall”. Therefore, all 
GCC is still at an early stage or phase for utilizing and 
implementing OGD [6]. They face a number of challenges in 
21
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2023.     ISBN:  978-1-68558-041-4
ALLDATA 2023 : The Ninth International Conference on Big Data, Small Data, Linked Data and Open Data

the OGD implementation, such as the datasets are not 
regularly updated, the available datasets are in unprocessed 
format, there is no interpretation or clear description for these 
datasets, and most of the datasets are available in the Arabic 
language only, some GCC countries have no clear OGD 
policy and classify OGD under other topics, discouraged users 
from contributing to the datasets, and limited formats and 
interactive maps and user-friendly formats. 
Saxena discussed drivers and barriers to reusing OGD in 
Oman as one of the GCC countries [30]. A qualitative 
approach has been applied to the national OGD portal of 
Oman (https://data.gov.om). The national data portal of Oman 
is a free data-sharing portal where anyone can access data 
relating to the Sultanate of Oman. The data portal provides 
datasets from different entities for everyone - citizen, investor, 
researcher, or developer [31]. The national OGD portal of 
Oman has published over 56 data sets across 12 sectors. 
Moreover, there are 17 data providers or entities and three 
mobile apps which may be used by different users [30], [32]. 
Saxena concluded that Oman’s OGD initiative could be 
classified as a hybrid of the three models [29]; Data over the 
wall, Code exchange, and Participatory open data [30]. 
Having discussed the challenges and barriers of SMEs so 
far, especially for GCC, various challenges/issues and 
classifications still need to be mentioned. For example, the 
OGD platforms use exclusive data from governmental 
entities; they do not incorporate data from different sources, 
such as third-party data and social media combined with 
analytics. Therefore, one of the essential classifications that 
needed to be included in the OGD lifecycle classification. 
Moreover, it could be categorized by the different activities in 
each stage of the OGD lifecycle. Therefore, the end user could 
track, monitor, and tackle the challenges effectively. 
V. 
METHODOLOGY 
Data collection facilitates and improves the decision-
making process and the quality of those decisions. Thus, to 
answer our research questions related to the role of SMEs in 
Qatar in utilizing and spreading the use of OGD, we used a 
mixture of quantitative and qualitative data collection 
methods, such as surveys [33]. The primary objectives of the 
two independent surveys were to examine the level of 
awareness of OGD as a concept, how SMEs in Qatar view the 
current OGD platforms, and how OGD may be enhanced to 
meet the needs of SMEs. 
We targeted two categories of stakeholders for the survey. 
The first category is the public, i.e., citizens and residents, and 
the second category is SMEs and Investors. So, we have 
designed a survey for each category as follows. 
The first survey was called the " OGD Awareness 
Survey", which aims to evaluate the awareness of citizens and 
residents in Qatar of the Open Government Data.  Further, the 
second survey was called " OGD – SMEs and Investors 
Survey", which aims to evaluate the awareness and utilization 
of OGD by SMEs and Investors in Qatar.  The surveys were 
divided into several sections. 
VI. 
RESULTS AND EVALUATION 
A. Selection of Organizations and Stakeholders 
We have selected various organizations and stakeholders 
participating in the data collection process. Examples of 
organizations are the Ministry of Interior (MOI), Ministry of 
Justice (MOJ), Qatar Development Bank (QDB), Qatar 
International 
Court 
and 
Dispute 
Resolution 
Centre 
(QICDRC), Ministry of Commerce and Industry and 
Hukoomi. 
B. Survey Data Analysis Procedure and Used Tools 
The surveys were introduced in English to manage the 
different terms included in the survey. Two channels for the 
targeted stakeholders of the first survey (OGD Awareness 
Survey) were used. The first channel used was a request for 
an official email list of consumers or end users of the Ministry 
of Interior (MoI) and State of Qatar services, either citizens or 
residents, through an SMS application. After receiving the list 
of four hundred emails from MoI, these emails were added to 
an email group and sent an email containing the survey’s 
purpose and URL. The second channel was conducted 
through a series of visits to MoI service locations, connecting 
us with participants willing to participate in our study. Then, 
we met with another one hundred participants to complete the 
survey using an iPad. Therefore, this survey was distributed to 
500 participants. The survey was designed to be online using 
a tool called Microsoft Forms, which we have authorized 
access to through Loughborough University within Microsoft 
Office 365. As a result, 422 responses received a return rate 
of 84%. The output of Microsoft Forms is a Microsoft Excel 
file containing participant records. 
In the distribution plan of the second survey (OGD – 
SMEs and Investors Survey), we requested an authorized 
email list of SMEs from the MoI and State of Qatar services. 
After receiving the list of 125 emails from MoI, we added 
them to an email group and sent them an email containing the 
survey's purpose and URL. The survey was designed to be 
completed online using Microsoft Forms. Finally, we received 
101 responses, a return rate of 81%. 
Moreover, we performed an initial analysis in Microsoft 
Excel files to check which responses should be included in the 
statistical analysis. For the first survey, we found that 94 
records of the total records answered "No" in the consent 
section, which means they did not participate in our survey. 
As a result, we found that 328 were valid for analysis. For the 
second survey, only one record of the total records answered 
"No" in the consent section, which means they did not 
participate in our survey. Thus, 100 SMEs or investors were 
considered valid for analysis. Finally, cleaning and 
transformation steps were necessary to prepare an Excel file 
for statistical analysis. Firstly, we changed or renamed the 
names of columns in the first row or header to meaningful 
names. Secondly, we carried out two main transformation 
steps in Microsoft Excel using a Power Query Editor such as 
the following: 
 
Remove a set of columns related to Microsoft Forms, 
such as Start time, completion time, and email.

 
Replace the null values in columns with the Not 
Available (NA) value. 
Furthermore, the transformed Microsoft Excel files for the 
two surveys were imported into IBM Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences (SPSS) to provide further analysis of the 
survey results. SPSS is one of the best-known statistical 
techniques researchers use to deliver advanced statistical 
analyses, including the Chi-Square Test, which provides a 
reliable estimation of research results and can define the 
relationships between research variables [40][41]. 
C. OGD Awareness Survey - Data Analysis Findings 
We selected all questions from Section A: Demographic 
Information and questions Q8, Q9, and Q10 from Section B: 
OGD Awareness. First, general analysis shows the number of 
responses that express the relationship between two variables 
using cross-tabulation analysis. Then, we performed an in-
depth study that shows the dependency or independency 
between two questions or variables using the Chi-Square as 
statistical analysis.

1) We examined the relationship between Q2- Age 
Group and the three questions: Q8- OGD Reaction, Q9- OGD 
of QatarGov Usability and Q10- OD Qatar Third Parties 
Usability. Figure 1 shows the responses of the   Q2- Age 
Group to question Q9 (OGD of QatarGov Usability). Both 
responses from age groups range 18-30 and 30-44 indicate 
that they are mostly Extremely likely to use OGD. These 
numbers indicate that OGD from the Qatar government is 
trusted and could be used or utilized by youth and adults. 
Moreover, we performed the Chi-Square analysis using IBM 
SPSS between questions Q2, Q8, Q9 and Q10. For example, 
the Chi-Square value is 29.023 for the relation between Q2 
and Q9. Moreover, the degree of freedom "df" is 12, mapped 
to a p-value of 21.026 with a confidence of 0.95 according to 
the Chi-Square distribution. Therefore, there is a dependency 
between the two questions because the Chi-Square value is 
greater than the p-value. We found that there is an indication 
that a high percentage of youth and adults show their interest 
in OGD as a positive topic in responses to Q8, and they will 
utilize both governmental and third-party’s open data. 
Moreover, these findings are confirmed by performing the 
Chi-Square analysis between Q2 and the three questions as in 
Table I. 
 
Figure 1.  OGD Usability per Age Group. 
2) We checked the relationship between Q3- Gender and 
the same three questions Q8, Q9 and Q10. Figure 2 shows the 
responses to question Q8. Both responses from gender, either 
male or female, mostly range between Very positive 117 for 
males and 73 for females, and somewhat positive 52 for 
males and 60 for females. These numbers represent a good 
indication that OGD is something required by both genders. 
Moreover, the Chi-Square value between the questions Q3- 
Gender and Q8, Q9 is 9.878, and the degree of freedom "df" 
is 4, which is mapped to a p-value of 9.488 with confidence 
0.95 according to the Chi-Square distribution. Therefore, 
there is a dependency between the two questions because the 
Chi-Square value is greater than the p-value. Truly, there is 
an indication that a high percentage of males and females 
show their interest in OGD, and they may utilize both 
governmental and third-parties open data as in responses to 
OGD of QatarGov Usability and OGD QatarThirdParties

confirmed by performing the Chi-Square analysis between 
Q3- Gender and the three questions, as shown in Table I. 
 
Figure 2.  OGD Reaction per Gender. 
3) We 
examined 
the 
relationship 
between 
Q4- 
Nationality and the three questions Q8, Q9 and Q10. Figure 
3 shows the responses of Q4- Nationality to the variable. Both 
responses from Qatari or Non-Qatari are mostly Extremely 
likely to use OGD (140 Qatari and 84 Non-Qatari), and the 
other values have a slight difference for citizens. These 
numbers indicate that OGD from the Qatar government is 
trusted and could be used or utilized by citizens and residents. 
Furthermore, there is evidence of significant interest in using 
OGD from citizens and residents. These findings are 
presented in Table I. 
 
Figure 3.  OGD Usability per Nationality. 
4) We checked the relationship between Q5- Highest 
Qualification and the three Q8, Q9 and Q10. Figure 4 shows 
the Q5- Highest Qualification responses to the Q9- OGD of 
QatarGov Usability. Both responses for a Bachelor’s degree 
or a Postgraduate degree mostly range between Extremely 
likely 99 for a Bachelor’s degree and 87 for a Postgraduate 
degree, and Very likely 26 for a Bachelor’s degree and 32 for 
a Postgraduate degree. These numbers indicate that OGD 
from the Qatar government is trusted and could be used or 
utilized by highly educated people in Qatar. Moreover, the 
Chi-Square value is 22.812, and the degree of freedom "df" 
is 12, which is mapped to a p-value of 21.026 with a 
confidence of 0.95 according to the Chi-Square distribution. 
Therefore, there is a dependency between the two variables 
because the Chi-Square value is greater than the p-value, as 
in Table I. 
 
Figure 4.  OGD Usability per Highest Qualification. 
5) We examined the relationship between Q6- Computer 
Knowledge Level and questions Q8, Q9 and Q10. Both 
responses from Computer Knowledge Level Ranges Expert 
or Intermediate mostly range between Very positive 91 for 
Expert and 52 for Intermediate, and Somewhat positive 62 
for Expert and 39 for Intermediate, as illustrated in Figure 5. 
These numbers represent a good indication that OGD is 
something required by people who have expert or 
intermediate computer knowledge levels.  Furthermore, 
facilitating data access for persons with limited computer 
abilities is a barrier and should be addressed in the available 
OGD platforms. The Chi-Square value is 30.359, and the 
degree of freedom "df" is 12, mapped to a p-value of 21.026 
(see Table I) with a confidence of 0.95 according to the Chi-
Square distribution. Therefore, there is a dependency 
between the two variables because the Chi-Square value is 
greater than the p-value of expert or intermediate computer 
knowledge levels interested in utilizing advanced features 
from government and third-parties open data. 
 
Figure 5.  OGD Reaction per Computer Knowledge Level. 
6) We 
checked 
the 
relationship 
between 
Q7- 
Employment Situation and the three questions Q8, Q9 and 
Q10. Figure 6 shows the responses of Q7- Employment 
Situation to question Q10 - OD QatarThirdParties Usability. 
Both responses from qualification ranges Expert or 
Intermediate mostly range between Very likely as 127 for

Working-Full-Time and 41 for in Education. These numbers 
indicate that open data from Qatar Third-parties are trusted 
and could be used or utilized by people working Full-Time or 
in Education. Moreover, the Chi-Square analysis between the 
question Q7- Employment Situation and the three questions 
(Q8, Q9 and Q10). For instance, the Chi-Square value for 
Q10 is 55.700, as shown in Table I, and the degree of freedom 
"df" is 16, which is mapped to a p-value of 26.296 with 
confidence 0.95 according to the Chi-Square distribution. 
Therefore, there is a dependency between the two variables 
because the Chi-Square value is greater than the p-value.

D. OGD – SMEs and Investors Survey - Data Analysis 
Findings 
This section discussed how we performed the statistical 
analysis for the second survey, " OGD – SMEs and Investors 
Survey,” General Analysis, and In-Depth Analysis. We 
selected Q3, Q6, and Q7 from Section A (Demographic 
Information), question Q9 from Section B (OGD Awareness), 
Q12 and Q13 from Section C (OGD Organizational 
Information), Q18, Q19, Q21, and Q23 from Section D (OGD 
Technical Information) as in Table V. Through our analysis 
both general and In-depth, we used keywords of each question 
to express its meaning for simplicity.

1) We examined the relationship between Q3- Age 
Group and the seven questions: Q9- SMEs Utilization 
Published OGD, Q12- Verify QatarGov OGD Policy, Q13- 
QatarGov Verify OGD Access, Q18- Qatar ODP Usability 
Purpose, Q19- Qatar ODP Registration Provided Data 
Method, Q21- Qatar ODP Registration Dissuade Status and 
Q23- Qatar ODP Verify Data Analytics Usability. Figure 7 
shows the responses of Q3- Age Group to question Q13- 
QatarGov Verify OGD Access. Both responses from age 
groups range 18-30 and 31-44 are mostly free of charge, as 
37 for (18-30) and 35 for (31-44). These numbers indicate 
that responses from these age groups need free-of-charge 
access to Qatar government OGD. Moreover, the Chi-Square 
analysis between the question Q3- Age Group and the seven 
questions mentioned above are presented in Table II. For 
example, the Chi-Square analysis between Q3 and Q13- 
QatarGov Verify OGD Access is 20.747. According to the 
Chi-Square distribution, the degree of freedom "df" is 6, 
mapped to a p-value of 12.592 with confidence 0.95. 
Therefore, there is a dependency between the two questions 
as the Chi-Square value is greater than the p-value.  After we 
performed the analyses between Q3 and these questions, we 
found no difference between age groups. Q9, Q12, Q13, Q18, 
Q19, Q21 and Q23. Furthermore, there is an indication that a 
high percentage of youth and adults need free-of-charge 
25

access to Qatar government OGD as in responses to 
QatarGov Verify OGD Access. Thus, access to Qatar 
government OGD should be free of charge according to youth 
and adults’ feedback. 
 
Figure 7.  OGD Access per Age Group. 
2) We examined the relationship between Q7- Computer 
Knowledge Level and the seven questions (Q9, Q12, Q13, 
Q18, Q19, Q21 and Q23). Figure 8 shows the responses of 
Q7 - Computer Knowledge Level to question Q23- Qatar 
ODP Verify Data Analytics Usability. Both responses from 
computer knowledge levels range between Expert and 
Intermediate or mostly between Yes 34 for Expert and 10 for 
Intermediate, and 33 No for Expert and 16 for Intermediate. 
These indicate that responses from these computer 
knowledge levels had no difference, which may have 
happened because they did not use an analytics platform. 
Moreover, the Chi-Square analysis using SPSS between the 
variables Q7 and the seven questions is illustrated in Table II. 
For example, the Chi-Square analysis between Q7 and Q23- 
Qatar ODP Verify Data Analytics Usability is 10.199, and the 
degree of freedom "df" is four which is mapped to a p-value 
of 9.488 with confidence 0.95 according to the Chi-Square 
distribution. Therefore, there is a dependency between the 
two variables because the Chi-Square value is greater than 
the p-value. After we performed both general and In-Depth 
analysis between Q7 and these questions, we found no 
difference between computer knowledge levels in their 
responses to the registration process ODP will dissuade the 
SMEs from utilizing the OGD. 
 
Figure 8.  Data Analytics Usability per Computer Knowledge Level 
3) We checked the relationship between Highest 
Qualification and the seven questions. Figure 9 shows the 
responses of Q6- Highest Qualification to question Q9- 
SMEs Utilization Published OGD. Both responses from the 
highest qualification range from a Postgraduate degree and a 
Bachelor’s degree are between 35 Yes for Postgraduate 
degrees and 16 for Bachelor degrees, and 20 No for a 
Postgraduate degree and 21 for Bachelor’s degree. These 
numbers 
indicate that 
SMEs' highest qualifications 
(Postgraduate and Bachelor degrees) utilize the published 
OGD. Moreover, the Chi-Square analysis using SPSS 
between question Q6 and the seven questions Q9, Q12, Q13, 
Q18, Q19, Q21, and Q23 are shown in Table II. For example, 
a Chi-Square analysis between Q6 and Q9 - SMEs Utilization 
Published OGD is 10.743, and the degree of freedom "df" is 
four which is mapped to a p-value of 9.488 with confidence 
0.95 according to Chi-Square distribution. Therefore, there is 
a dependency between the two variables because the Chi-
Square value is greater than the p-value. After we performed 
the analysis between Q6 and these questions, we found that 
there is an indication that a high percentage of highly 
educated people will utilize Published OGD, need free-of-
charge access for Qatar government OGD, believe in the full 
or semi-full utilization of the open data portal and believe in 
that Qatar government OGD is provided from both direct 
(i.e., through ODP) and indirect (i.e., through the website of 
the ministry or the OGD source).

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper explored the existing literature regarding the 
definition of OGD, its history, benefits that could be brought 
by using it, and any drawbacks. As a result, this paper paved 
the way for future researchers to develop prominent data 
analytics theories that would benefit the Qatari economy and 
company. Furthermore, we have conducted intensive surveys 
to gather information regarding the readiness to use and enjoy 
the fruits of OGD. The results showed how this open data 
could impact society and SMEs. The analysis is concluded 
with a set of key findings as follows: 
26
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2023.     ISBN:  978-1-68558-041-4
ALLDATA 2023 : The Ninth International Conference on Big Data, Small Data, Linked Data and Open Data

1) Most youth and adults in Qatar reacted positively to 
utilizing OGD, as seen in their responses to the OGD 
Reaction and how they will use governmental and third-party 
open data. Therefore, there is a need for a plan to increase 
awareness of OGD between different age groups. 
2) Gender appears not to be a factor in the willingness to 
utilize OGD in Qatar. 
3) It does not matter what nationality is (i.e., Qatari or 
Non-Qatari) in Qatar towards the OGD, i.e., residents and 
citizens show interest in OGD as a positive topic with no 
distinction. 
4) Regardless of education, gender, and employment 
status, people in Qatar have a positive reaction and are keen 
on OGD. For this reason, the OGD portal must be simple and 
easy to use by all people, regardless of their education level. 
5) According to the replies to Qatar Gov Verify OGD 
Access, many youths and adults who are SME investors or 
owners want free access to OGD. As a result, OGD should be 
made available to SMEs at an accessible cost to help the 
Qatari private sector, as they may not utilize it if they have to 
pay. 
6) Owners and investors of SMEs of different ages did 
not differ regarding the following questions: SMEs Use 
Published OGD, Verify QatarGov OGD Policy, Qatar ODP 
Usability Purpose, Qatar ODP Registration Provided Data 
Method, Qatar ODP Registration Dissuade and Qatar ODP 
Verify Data Analytics Usability. 
7) Highly educated investors and owners of SMEs will 
utilize Published OGD, need to have free access to Qatar 
government OGD, and believe in full utilization (i.e., 
accessed, downloaded and used) or semi-full utilization (i.e., 
accessed and downloaded) of the ODP, and believe in that 
Qatar government OGD is provided from both direct (i.e., 
through ODP) and indirect (i.e., through the website of the 
ministry or the OGD source). 
8) All qualifications are the same regarding their belief 
that the policy of OGD and the registration process of ODP 
will dissuade SMEs from utilizing the OGD.  
9) Many expert and intermediate computer knowledge 
levels who are SME investors or owners will utilize OGD. 
They believe that the Qatar government OGD policy should 
exist and need free-of-charge access for Qatar government 
OGD. Additionally, they believe in the open data portal's full 
utilization (i.e., accessed, downloaded, and used) or semi-full 
utilization (i.e., accessed and downloaded). Moreover, they 
think that the Qatar government OGD is provided directly 
(i.e., through ODP) and indirectly (i.e., through the ministry's 
website or the OGD source). 
10) There is no difference between computer knowledge 
levels in their responses to the registration process of the 
ODP will dissuade the SMEs from utilizing OGD. 
The Qatari government should create a national-level, 
centralized service where SMEs utilize big data analytics 
tools and examine open data supplied by the government and 
others to improve business decision-making and discover 
new chances for expansion and innovation. We are now 
working completion completing the development of an OGD 
platform that encourages the use of OGD and overcomes the 
issues raised in this article. With big data analytics, the 
planned OGD platform would assist SMEs in achieving more 
innovation and growth. Additionally, it establishes a 
centralized, national service where SMEs may use big data 
analytics tools and techniques and evaluate open data 
provided by the government and others to enhance corporate 
decision-making and find new opportunities for growth and 
innovation. Additionally, data from social networks and 
outside sources will be combined with open data to give 
additional information to SMEs, reflecting the whole 
economic picture and assisting decision-makers in delivering 
better conclusions.
