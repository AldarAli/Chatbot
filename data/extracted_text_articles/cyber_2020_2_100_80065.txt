Abstract—In  the  era  of  digitization,  proper  online
authentication is as important to public administration as it is
to the economy. In  the  past,  different solutions  have  been
developed, such as postal authentication, identification by video
or by eID-Cards. All of these solutions either take days or even
weeks, rely on human interaction or require additional, possibly
expensive, hardware. At the current moment there is a lack of a
fast, automated, secure and most importantly simple process to
properly authenticate yourself online. Therefore, fast electronic
identification  (SEIN)  has  conceptualized  a  new  way  of
automatically authenticating natural and legal entities, using
tokenization and already authenticated data sets collected by
financial  institutions  as  a  result  of  the  German  Money
Laundering Act (GwG) which are made accessible through the
Payment Service Directive (PSD2) using well known and widely
used technologies such as OAuth 2.0, OpenId Connect and
Transport  Layer Security  (TLS) 1.3. The  startup  company
SEIN aims to provide fast authentication at substantial trust
level without collecting any data from the user and without a
data transfer between the bank and the inquiring entity. The
bank will not know who made the request for authentication
and vice versa, the inquiring party will not know which bank
has provided the user data. In this paper, we will go into more
detail on how SEIN plans to provide a new and innovative way
to authenticate yourself online.

 INTRODUCTION  
Registering for insurance, getting a new mobile phone
contract or paying a mortgage online and many other online
services as shown in Figure 1 require you to authenticate
yourself.  The  commonly  used  methods  for  online
authentication are postal identification, video identification
or identification via electronic Identification  (eID) Card.
Waiting for the posted authentication documents, queuing up
for an online  video conference with an employee  of an
identification provider while possibly relying on an unstable
Internet  connection  or  needing  specific  and  potential
expensive hardware takes a heavy toll on the overall user
experience and usability.
Our goal is to make online identification  more easily
accessible, not only in Germany but in Europe. Our solution
requires no hardware,  doesn’t involve any human contact
and most importantly aims to provide authentication within
minutes instead of days or weeks. The only requirement is
that the person requiring authentication has access to an
online banking account. According to the European Banking
Federation (EBF) that means more than half the population
(54%) of the EU (state of 2018) [1]. This means there are
more than 240 million [2] registered online bank accounts,
which have already been properly authenticated.  This figure
has been increasing steadily for years and it is assumed that
it will continue to increase in the future.
Figure 1. Possible applications  of  SEIN [4].
Why identify manually, if you could use  the already
authenticated data sets from a trustworthy institution? We
aim to provide a fully automated electronic identification,
authentication and trust service. Our service is compliant at
the  substantial  trust  level  with  the  regulations  of  the
electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services
(eIDAS) [3] while only using  the  data  provided by the
already authenticated identities from financial institutions.
The  eIDAS  Commission  implementing  regulation  (EU)
2015/1502 [5] specifies the criteria for trust and security at
substantial level. Trust at substantial level can be achieved
by guaranteeing  trust at low level plus one of the 4 listed
points:
(1) The person has been verified to be in possession of
evidence when applying for the electronic identity and
the evidence is checked to be genuine or according to an
authoritative source is known to exist and relate to a real
94

person and steps have been taken to minimize 
the risk that the person’s identity is not the claimed
identity, taking into account for instance the risk of lost,
stolen, suspended, revoked or expired evidence.
(2) An identity document is physically presented during a
registration  process  and  steps  have  been  taken  to
minimize the  risks  of  known identification fraud as
mentioned above.
(3) Procedures used previously by an company or entity for
a  purpose  other  than  the  issuance  of  electronic
identification provide  for  an equivalent assurance  to
those set in the points listed above, do not have to be
repeated  provided  such  equivalent  assurance  is
confirmed  by  a  conformity  assessment  body  or  an
equivalent body.
(4) The electronic identification requests are issued on the
basis  of  a  valid  notified  electronic  identification
provider having the assurance level substantial or high,
and taking into account the risks of known identification
fraud,  namely  the  risk  of  lost,  stolen,  suspended,
revoked or expired evidence. The assurance level must
be confirmed by a conformity assessment body or an
equivalent body.
The  account  holding  bank  has  to  fulfill  all  the
prerequisites that the eIDAS regulation establishes. So, we
can assume a trust level of substantial or higher as a result of
regulations  such  as  eIDAS,  the  Money  Laundering  Act
(GwG)  [6]  and  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation
(GDPR) [10] in place. The  GwG requires each financial
institution to properly check the authenticity of an account
when  opened and  to  make  sure  that  the  presented
authentication is at minimum risk of known identification
fraud. 
Furthermore, the Interpretation and Application Guide  in
relation to the German Money Laundering Act [8]  states,
that the verified identities can be used as proof of identity for
third parties. Henceforth,  SEIN will use the data already
securely collected by financial institutions and thanks to the
guarantee provided by the  eIDAS regulation provide a level
of trust equal to that provided by the financial institutions.
The identifying data is accessible  via a corresponding
Application Programming Interface (API), which has to be
provided  according  to  the  Payment  Service  Directive  2
(PSD2) [7]. The access to the saved data is usually secured
via  a  strong  two-factor  authentication  using  a  Personal
Identification  Number  (PIN)  and  a  Transaction
Authorization Number (TAN),  thus  providing us  with a
legitimization check. 
Not only is the data we access already verified to be
secure and at least at substantial trust level but SEIN plans
on being ISO 27001 [9] certified. This will ensure an even
higher level of security, a functional Information Security
Management  System  (ISMS)  and  will  also  add  to  our
compliance to the GDPR.
In Section I we provide an introduction. Section II gives
additional information about the directives and regulations
we reference and apply. Section III outlines how SEIN plans
on deriving an identity at a modular level as well as an
example of a web service. Section IV states our approach to
privacy by design. The conclusion lists some of our goals for
the future, and the acknowledgements close the paper.

TERMINOLOGY
A. Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust 
Services [2]
eIDAS  is  an  EU  regulation   managing  electronic
identification and trust services for electronic transactions in
the European Single Market and the European Economic
Area. It was first introduced in the EU regulation 910/2014
and became effective on July 1st 2016. It states that any
organization  that  provides  a  public  digital  service  must
recognize  electronic  identification  from  all  EU  member
states,  provided  that  the  provider  meets  the  established
eIDAS standards.
It also sets standards for electronic signatures, qualified
digital certificates, electronic seals, timestamps and other
forms of proof of authentication to give them an equal legal
standing  as  the  transactions  performed  on  paper.  
Moreover,  eIDAS  introduces  three  levels  of  assurance
namely low, substantial and high to better assess the security
different authentication services provide.
B. Payment Service Directive 2 [7]
Revised Payment Services Directive or Payment Services
Directive  2  (EU)  2015/2366  replaced  the  former  EU
Directive  2007/64/EC  to  expand  the  pan-European
competition and participation in the financial industry, not
exclusively  limit  to  banks  by  coordinating  consumer
protection and defining rights and obligations for payment
providers  and users.  The PSD2  establishes a  framework
within which all payment service providers must operate.
Most importantly for us, the PSD2 regulation declares
that  any  bank  must  grant  customer Access  to  Account
(XS2A) data to third party providers.
C. Access to Accounts [11]
XS2A is the abbreviation used to express  Access to
Accounts and denotes the API  financial establishments can
use to implement certain online-banking-features. The API
enables  third  party  providers  to  give  non-discriminatory
access to the linked  customer account.  This also makes
administering multiple accounts distributed among different
banks within one central software solution possible.
It is expected that that different financial establishments
will harmonize their API access to further enhance the user
experience.  While  there  have  already  been  some
amalgamating actions, it is still an ongoing process. 
D. German Money Laundering Act [6]
The  German  Money  Laundering  Act  (GwG
german: Geldwäsche  Gesetz), which was passed in June
2017,  obligates  every  bank  to  properly  authenticate  the
95

customer whenever they open a new bank account. This is to
prevent money laundering and terrorist funding. The GwG
stipulates  the data which must be gathered and  verified for
both the natural person and the legal person. 
Natural person:
 first name and surname
 place of birth
 date of birth
 nationality
 residential addresses 
Legal person or company:
 company or trading name
 legal form
 commercial register number (if available)
 address of registered office/head office
 name of the members of its representative bodies/ names
of its legal representatives
 name  of  owner  (additional  data  from  owner  may be
required)
E. International Standard for Organization 27001 [9]
Published in 2005 and revised in 2013 the International
Standards  Organization (ISO)  27001  is  the  international
standard on how to manage information and data security.
 To achieve our goal of trust at substantial level we have
to prove that, we meet the requirements of ISO 27001 and
this has to be verified by a neutral entity. Therefore, not only
will  SEIN need  an  Information  Security  Management
System (ISMS) that ensures that the information security
controls  continue  to  meet  our  organization  information
security  needs  but  also  systematically  examine  our
information  security  risks  in  regards  to  threats,
vulnerabilities and impacts.
F. General Data Protection Regulation [10]
The General Data Protection Regulation  has been law
since April 2016 and regulates who the GDPR applies to and
the consequences if the held data is ever jeopardized. The
mainstay of the GDPR is a rule set for organizations and
companies forcing them to take the protection of personal
data seriously. 
III.
APPROACH IN DETAIL
A. Concept of deriving an identity
A schematic overview, on how inquiring mandates verify
the identification of a customer is shown in the Figure 2
below.  First, the customer has to select the bank which will
provide the  authorization. The authorization works via a
strong  2-factor-authentication,  (eg.  PIN/TAN).  After  a
successful authentication, the bank forwards the personal
identification data which in the final step will authenticate
the user.
SEIN will not require any additional hardware, which
will greatly improve the user experience since there are no
media discontinuities. Furthermore the encryption and the
reliability of the data of the financial institutions provide us
with  a  high  level  of  security.  Finally,  SEIN plans  on
maximizing the level of automation, so the service can be
available 24/7 without any human interaction. 
Figure 2. Approach of deriving an identity.
This should mean that there is no queue time and the
cancellation  rate  should  be  minimal  since  the  internet
connection has only got to send and receive  small  data
packages. The planned maximal time it should take to verify
an identity is 90 seconds, thus greatly increasing the overall
user experience. 
B. Derived identification
The main idea is to use a derived identity, to ensure  that
SEIN never has access to critical data. This differentiates our
solution from other methods such as Screen Scraping. We
never have access to the users TAN and/or PIN.
Figure 3. Detailed process of deriving an identity.
The process of deriving an ID is as follows (using the
example of a Web service) as shown in Figure 3:
96
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2021.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-818-1
CYBER 2020 : The Fifth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

(1) A user or an account holder requests access to a service,
which requires authentication.
(2) The  inquiring party  will be forwarded to our service
(SEIN) by their web browser.
(3) Our service will request the user to select their bank;
they will then be redirected to the financial institution of
their   choice.
(4) The user logs into their online banking account. This
process may differ for different financial institutions, but
most of the time a PIN and a TAN are required. The
TAN in this case is used as the verification to verify the
users agreement for his personal data to be transferred to
the  potential  mandate/entity.  Upon  properly
authenticating themselves, an authorization code will be
sent back from the bank to the users web browser and
then transparently passed onto our service.
(5) SEIN forwards the received authorization code to the
bank. 
(6) The  received  authorization  code  will  be  then  be
automatically exchanged for an access token and sent
back from the bank to SEIN.
(7) As part of the automated process the access token and
the  URL  will  be  sent  to  the  bank.  So  that  the
authentication data required can be fetched by the bank.
(8) The personal identification data will then be sent back by
the bank to SEIN as a derived ID.
(9) Finally, the website requesting authentication for the
user will receive said authentication from SEIN.
(10)Access to the requested service is granted to the user.
C. Security analysis and evaluation
The technical security measures are implemented by the
OAuth 2.0 protocol [12]. The protocol inhibits the theft of a
user session. Additionally it ensures no unknown third entity
can impersonate our service to steal data.  Its framework
enables a third party entity to obtain limited access to an
HTTP Service. In order not to store critical data, gain undue
access to the users protected resources or to comprise any
passwords  from  the  user  OAuth  2.0  has  introduced an
authorization layer which separates the role of the client
from  that  of the end user [15].  Furthermore  OAuth 2.0
supports  Transport  Layer  Security  (TSL)  1.3   and  is
compliant with the most up-to-date data protection standards.
Our start-up project also uses OpenID Connect [13] for a
fast  proof of identity. OpenID  Connect is based on the
OAuth 2.0 protocol with the extension of a JSON web token
which we use for further authentication. These protocols and
frameworks enable clients of all sorts, including but  not
limited to  web  based,  mobile  and  JavaScript-Clients  to
receive information about authenticated sessions and users.
As  a  result  OpenID  Connect  optimizes  the  OAuth-
authentication process and extends the  OAuth2.0 protocol
with the necessary functions for Login and Single Sign-On. 
In our search as part of the  preparation for the first
security evaluation we found 4 papers discussing the security
of OpenID. In the following  section we will provide a short
summarization of each of the papers.
The first paper  is “Analysing the Security of Google’s
Implementation of OpenID Connect” [18] which was the
first field study in this field. It examined 103 of the relying
parties (RP) that implemented the Google OpenID service,
revealing a series of vulnerabilities of a number of types. It
provides  recommendations  for  both  RPs  and  OpenID
Provider  (OP)  to  improve  the  security  of  the  OpenID
Connect systems. These enhancing recommendations for the
RPs include not customizing the Hybrid Server-side Flow,
taking  countermeasures  to  Cross-Site-Request-Forgery
(CSRF) attacks and improving the use  of state value to not
be predictable. The OPs are advised to remove the token
from the authorization request in the Hybrid Server Flow and
add a state value in the sample code.
In  “OpenID  Connect  Security  Considerations”  the
authors  Vladislav  Mladenov  and  Christian  Mainka  [19]
examine  specification  and  implementation  (client  and
Identity Provider side) flaws. For each flaw they list different
kinds of possible attacks. For example the specification flaws
open OpenID Connect up for 4 attacks using the malicious
Discovery service: the Broken End-User Authentication, the
Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), the Code Injection
Attack and the Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack. The paper
also  highlights the  problem  of  Session Overwriting and
Identity provider (IdP) Confusion.
The third paper was “Securing Digital Identities in the
Cloud  by  Selecting  an  Apposite  Federated  Identity
Management from SAML, OAuth and OpenID Connect”
[20] by Nitin Naik and Paul Jenikins. It assesses 3 different
Federated Identity Management (FidM) standards, namely
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAMPL), OAuth and
OpenID Connect (OIDC), on architectural design, working,
security  strength  and  security  vulnerability  to  ascertain
effective usages for secure online identification. It compares
these three standards in depth to help other FidM users and
researchers  to  select  an apposite  FidM  service  for  their
projects.
The final paper “SoK: Single Sign-On Security – An
Evaluation of OpenID  Connect” [21] categorized known
attacks on Single-Sign-On (SSO) into two classes: Single-
Phase Attacks which abuse the lack of single security checks
and Cross-Phase Attacks which require a complex setup and
a  manipulation  of  multiple  messages  during  the  entire
protocol  workflow.  Furthermore  the  paper  provides  an
evaluation of  official  open  source  OpenID  libraries  and
worked with the corresponding developers to help them fix
the issues. From this paper we have identified the OpenID-
Connect-Service-Libraries “MITREid Connect” and “Ruby
OpenID Connect” as secure candidates.  These two libraries
are secure against all known SSO Single-Phase Attacks and
97

CYBER 2020 : The Fifth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

Issuer Confusion Cross-Phase Attacks. In the case of attacks
abusing specification flaws such as IdP Confusion all tested
libraries were vulnerable. This is because even a correct
implementation, following every rule is still susceptible.
D. Security concept
To further secure the platform we plan to also use a
network firewall, as well as a Web Application Firewall
(WAF), similar to Apache-webserver using ModSecurity or
nginx-webserver using NAXSI. The identification through
SEIN as an identity provider will exclusively rely on TLS-
certificates with Extended Validation,  which we  plan to
archive  through  Qualified  Website  Authentication
Certificates (QWAC) according to eIDAS and the BaFin /
PSD2-Registration-KID. Qualified Website-TLS-Certificates
used  to authenticate  and  encrypt  the  communication for
applications implementing the PSD2-policy can be acquired
through D-Trust (Bundesdruckerei). To ensure the integrity
of   the  IT-based-processes  our  Information  Security
Management System (ISMS) must fulfill all the ISO/IEC
27001/2013  requirements  set  by  IT-Grundschutz
Methodology/BSI-Standard  200-2  [16].  Additionally  the
Technical Guideline TR-03147 Assurance Level Assessment
of Procedures for Identity Verification of Natural Persons
[17]  requires  an  identity  provider,  especially  the  E-
Government ones, to be ISO/IEC 27001 certified.
IV. DATA PROTECTION
A. Privacy by design
There will not be any data transfer between the system
managing the online bank account and the inquiring party.
Therefore,  the  bank  will  not  know  who  inquired  for
authentication and vise versa the inquiring party will not
know  which  bank  has  provided  the  user  data.  This
guarantees the highest level of data protection and privacy by
design. All the data of the user required for authentication is
already stored by the financial institutions. A derived version
of that data will be sent to the requesting entity. Every
connection  will  be  protected  by  the  current  security
procedures. 
Our start up fulfills every requirement set by the GDPR,
and also established  a compliance-,  a data protection and a
GwG detection management.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The  regulations  and  directives  provide  us  with  the
necessary information we  need to authenticate an entity.
With this legal foundation (eIDAS, GwG, GDPC, PSD2), the
secure technologies  we plan on using (OAuth 2.0, OpenID
Connect, TSL 1.3) and the measures we take to secure our
product (ISO 27001), we hope to innovate the way online
authentication  works.  The  start-up  SEIN  has  begun  to
implement the ideas presented in this paper and is currently 2
months deep into development. Evaluations and results will
be part of another paper, to be expected at the end of next
year (2021).
