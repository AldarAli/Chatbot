Abstract—Cognitive 
Radio 
Networks 
(CR) 
is 
an 
advanced growing technique and a promising technology for 
the 
upcoming generation 
of the wireless networks. 
Deployment 
of 
such 
networks is 
hindered 
by 
the 
vulnerabilities that these networks are exposed to, in this 
paper we focus on security problems arising from Primary 
User Emulation Attacks (PUEA) in CR networks. We study 
the impact of this attack on CR networks, detection and 
defense approaches. We have setup the system model using 
Matlab software; the Neyman-Pearson composite hypothesis 
test NPCHT is used to obtain the hypothesis test and detect 
the PUEA. Simulation results proved that using NPCHT it is 
possible to keep the probability of successful PUEA low, and 
this depends on the threshold values; the number of 
malicious users in the system can significantly increase the 
probability of false alarm in the network, Also it shows that 
there is a range of network radii in which PUEA are most 
successful.

INTRODUCTION 
Spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing are important 
functionalities of CR which enables the secondary users to 
monitor the frequency spectrum and detect vacant channels 
to use [1]; it is also important to address the security and 
reliability issues in the CR. An example of CR networks is 
the usage of unused spectrum (white spaces) in the 
television band where the TV transmitter becomes a 
primary transmitter, i.e., the TV receivers are primary 
receivers or licensed users and while the other users who 
are not TV subscribers but wish to use the spectrum in the 
TV band for their own communication becomes secondary 
transmitters/receivers. 
The essential purpose of spectrum sensing employment 
in a CR network is to identify empty spectral bands (white 
spaces) and once these white spaces have been identified, 
CR nodes opportunistically utilize these unoccupied bands 
of spectrum by wirelessly operating across them while 
simultaneously avoiding interference with the primary 
users [2]. In a CR network, primary users possess the 
priority to access the spectrum band, while the secondary 
users must always give up access of the spectrum band 
over to the primary users and ensure that no interference is 
caused. Subsequently, if a primary user begins to transmit 
across a frequency band occupied by a secondary user, the 
secondary user is ideally required to vacate that specific 
spectral band immediately. But when there is no active 
primary user communication in the spectrum, all other 
users enjoy equal right to access the unoccupied spectrum 
band. For a secondary user to gain equal rights as the 
primary user, the secondary user may tend to modify the 
air interface so as to mimic the primary user’s 
characteristics causing the secondary user to behave 
maliciously. The resultant effect of this is that the other 
secondary users will identify the malicious user as a 
primary user there by vacating the occupied spectrum band 
for the malicious user believing that it is a primary user. In 
this way, the malicious user gets access to the primary 
user’s spectrum band. In literature, this kind of attack 
against CR networks is considered as a Primary User 
Emulation Attack (PUEA) [3]. 
Therefore, we can define PUEA as an attack in CR 
networks where the malicious user pretends to be the 
primary user to obstruct idle channels by transmitting a 
similar signal as the primary user [3]. Masquerading of a 
primary user allows threat identifies the malicious 
masquerading of a primary user like a digital TV 
broadcaster. The malicious attacker may mimic the 
primary user characteristics in a specific frequency band 
(e.g., white space band), so that the legitimate secondary 
users erroneously identify the attacker as an incumbent and 
they avoid using that frequency band; the attacker primary 
focus is to disrupt the secondary user’s transmissions by 
making contact with it as many times as possible, each 
time the jammer does this it forces the secondary users to 
change channels as they cannot differentiate it from a 
primary user. The presence of PUEA causes a number of 
troubles for CR networks. A PUEA can be launched while 
the spectrum is being sensed or detected by using 
cyclostationary, energy or matched filter detection signal 
features [4]. 
We can classify the protection techniques against these 
types of threats in the following categories: (i) protection 
techniques based on reputation and trust of the CR nodes 
[5], (ii) identification of the masquerading threat though 
signal analysis [6], (iii) authentication of the CR node 
through cryptographic techniques [7], and (iv) geolocation 
database of primary users [8]. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  In 
Section II, the model design and simulation setup are 
Introduced. Section III describes the model analysis and 
probability density function of the received signal. Our 
simulation results, conclusion and future work are 
discussed in Section IV and section V, respectively.

A. Objective of adversarial attackers 
       The objectives of an attacker have a direct correlation 
with the way the attacks are launched, and therefore, they 
determine the nature of attacks [9][10]. 
        1)  Selfish attacks: The attacker’s motive is to acquire 
more spectrum for its own use by preventing others from 
competing for the channels and unfairly occupying their 
share.  In this type of attack, adversaries will defy the 
protocols and policies only if they are able to benefit from 
them [11][12]. 
        2) Malicious attacks: The attacker’s only objective is 
to create hindrance for others and does not necessarily aim 
at maximizing own benefits. They do not have any 
rational objective and identify protocols and policies to 
just induce losses to others [13].  
B.  Impact of PUE attacks on CR Networks 
 The presence of PUE attacks causes a number of 
troubles for CR networks. The list of potential 
consequences of PUE attacks is: 
•  Bandwidth waste: The ultimate objective of 
deploying CR networks is to address the spectrum 
under-utilization that is caused by the current fixed 
spectrum usage policy. By dynamically accessing 
the spectrum “holes”, the SUs are able to retrieve 
these otherwise wasted spectrum resources [14]. 
•    QoS degradation: The appearance of a PUE attack 
may severely degrade the Quality-of-Service 
(QoS) of the CR network by destroying the 
continuity of secondary services [14]. 
•   Connection unreliability: If a real-time secondary 
service is attacked by a PUE attacker and finds no 
available channel when performing spectrum 
handoff, the service has to be dropped. This real 
time service is then terminated due to the PUE 
attack. In principle, the secondary services in CR 
networks inherently have no guarantee that they 
will have stable radio resource because of the 
nature of dynamic spectrum access. The existence 
of PUE attacks significantly increases the 
connection unreliability of CR networks. Also the 
Hidden Node Problem (HNP) can cause unreliable 
connection; the most common approach against 
HNP is based on collaborative sensing to identify 
the incorrect spectrum perception of the affected 
CR node. This is the approach adopted in standard 
IEEE 802.22 [15], where decision rules (e.g., 
voting algorithm) are used to correct errors in the 
spectrum sensing function. In a similar way, this 
approach is also described by Prasad [16], even if 
the term distributed spectrum sensing is used.   
      •     Denial of Service: Consider PUE attacks with high      
            Attacking frequency; then the attackers may            
            occupy many of the spectrum opportunities. The     
            SUs will have insufficient bandwidth for their         
            transmissions, and hence, some of the SU services  
            will be interrupted. In the worst case, the CR           
            network may even find no channels to set up a        
            common control channel for delivering the control  
            and this is called Denial of Service in CR networks. 
                           
 
 
II.   MODEL DESIGN AND SIMULATION SETUP 
In our scenario, all secondary and malicious users are 
distributed in a circular grid of radius R, as shown in Fig. 
1.

Figure 1.   CR Network Model 
 A primary user (e.g., a TV tower), is located at some 
distance from all the users, the secondary users are 
randomly and uniformly distributed within a network 
radius from the primary transmitter. In order to detect the 
white spaces or the return of the primary, the secondary 
users measure the received power, if the received power is 
below a specified threshold then the spectrum band is 
considered to be vacant (white space). If the received 
power is above the specified threshold, then based on the 
measured power, a decision is made as to whether the 
received signal was transmitted by a primary transmitter or 
by a set of malicious users [17]. We design a Neyman-
Pearson Composite Hypothesis Test (NPCHT) to obtain a 
criterion for making this decision. To perform the analysis, 
the assumptions below are taken: 
 The distance between primary transmitter and all 
the users is d𝑝=120Km. 
 There are M malicious users in the system. M is a 
geometrically distributed random variable. 
 The locations of malicious users are uniformly 
distributed in the circular grid of radius R=500m 
as our simulation shows in Fig. 2 when M=30.The 
received power at the secondary user from each of 
the malicious user is Independently and Identically 
Distributed (IID). This is valid due to the 
symmetry of the system and the fact that the 
malicious users presented uniformly in an annular 
region between the centered at (0, 0) and radii (R0, 
R), if the received power is not IID, then the SU 
will use another power control scheme.

5W. All the values of the system parameters we 
have used are in Table I below. 
 The primary transmitter co=ordinates are fixed at a 
point (rp, θp) and this position is known to all the 
users in the grid. 
 The secondary user co-ordinates (r, θ), no 
malicious users are present within a circle of 
radius R0=40m known as “exclusive distance from 
the secondary user” centered at (r, θ).in case of this 
condition is not met then the received power at the 
secondary due to transmission from any subset of 
malicious users present within a distance R0 from 
the secondary becomes too large to create PUEA 
[17]. 
 
TABLE  I .     SYSTEM PARAMETERS FOR OUR SIMULATION 
 
 The transmission from primary transmitter and 
malicious users undergo path loss and log normal 
shadowing with mean 0 and variance σ2p and σ2m, 
respectively [18]. 
 The path loss exponent chosen for transmission from 
primary transmitter is 2 and from malicious user are 4. 
III.   MODEL ANALYSIS AND PROBABILITY DENSITY 
FUNCTION OF THE RECEIVED SIGNAL: 
     First, we have to obtain the Probability Density 
Function (PDF) of the received power at the secondary 
user due to transmission by the primary and by the 
malicious users in order to obtain a hypothesis test using 
Neyman-Pearson composite hypothesis test NPCHT [18]. 
A.  Probability Density Function of the Received Signal 
One of the applications of the probability density 
function of the received power is using it in Neyman 
Pearson’s Composite Hypothesis Test NPCHT or any 
other statistical test to identify intruders and impostors in 
CR networks and also investigate the impact of PUEA in 
the network. 
We consider M malicious users located at co-ordinates    
(rj, θj) 1 ≤ j ≤ M. Since the position of the jth malicious 
user is uniformly distributed in the annular region between 
R0 and R,  rj and θj are statistically independent ∀ j. The 
pdf of rj , p(rj) ∀ j is given by

B. Detecting PUEA using Neyman-Pearson Criterion 
     We have used the two hypotheses in Neyman-
 Pearson decision criterion, which are given as below:    
M1 : Primary Transmission in progress 
M2 : Emulation attack in progress 
In this hypothesis test, there are two types of errors that 
secondary user can make [20]: 
False alarm: The secondary makes a decision that the 
transmission is due to primary but the malicious user is 
transmitting. 
Miss Detection: The secondary makes a decision that the 
transmission is due to malicious user but the primary is 
transmitting. 
In our simulation, the power of the received signal is 
measured in order to calculate the decision variable which 
is given by the ratio of Λ=
Pm()
 /
( )
PPr 
  
where 
( )
PPr 
 and 
Pm()
is the pdf of received power 
from the primary and from all malicious users respectively. 
Λ is then compared with predefined threshold and the 
secondary decides the following 
 
     Λ ≤ λ                                     D1: Primary transmission 
 
Λ ≥ λ                                     D2: PUEA in progress 
 
      First, secondary user may decide D2 when M1 is true, 
and second secondary user may decide that D1 when M2 is 
true. Each of these errors has a probability associated with 
it which depends on the decision rule and condition 
densities [14]. Miss Probability: P{D2|M1}= Probability of 
making decision D2 when M1 is true.  
False Alarm Probability: P{D1|M2}=Probability of 
making decision D1 when M2 is true.

C.    Decision Rule 
In Fig. 3, we plot the decision rule showing Miss 
Probability and Probability of false alarm under 
Gaussian distribution. It shows the two conditional

by 
the

Figure 3.  The Decision Rule 
We compare the decision rule with the threshold value; 
Lambda (λ) and the miss probability and probability of 
false alarm are calculated accordingly [21]. 
IV.  RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
 In this section, we present the results obtained using 
Matlab simulation and also the theoretical results for the 
similar setup for the probability density function of the 
received power at the secondary user due to the primary 
transmitter and the received power at the secondary user 
due to the malicious users.  
Also, we determined the performance of the network 
for PUE attack in terms of probability of miss detection 
and false alarm, in addition to the relationship between the 
false alarm probability (i.e., the probability of successful 
PUEA) and the network Radius R. 
In our simulation, we have used the following system 
parameters, as shown in Table II. 
 
TABLE II.  SYSTEM SIMULATION PARAMETERS 
 
 We can see from Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 that the results of 
the probability density function using simulations 
considerably match with the one derived mathematically.   
There is a slight mismatch and the reason behind this is 
duo that the theoretical derivation is for ideal setup and 
over an unlimited duration of time while the simulation 
testing times are limited in number and also have random 
effects as per the simulation settings. 
 
 
 
It is clear that the probability density functions of the 
received power at the secondary user from the primary 
transmitter differ from the received power at the secondary 
user from the malicious user.

Based on the PDF which we have achieved in our

Test NPCHT approach, we have obtained the probability 
of successful PUEA (False Alarm),  
Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the false alarm 
probability (i.e., the probability of successful PUEA) and 
the network Radius R, we set the threshold value λ at 2. It 
is observed that the probability of false alarm rises and 
then falls down with increasing value of R and also there is 
a value of R for which the probability of false alarm is 
maximum; this is as expected because: 
Case 1-  for a given R0, if R is small, the malicious 
users are closer to the secondary user and the total received 
power from all the malicious users is likely to be larger

than that received from the primary transmitter, thus 
decreasing the probability of successful PUEA. 
Case 2- for large R, the cumulative received power at 
the secondary from the malicious users may not be 
sufficient to successfully launch PUEA. 
 We have done the simulation with different values of 
M, as shown in Fig.6; our results prove that when the PDF 
is used with NPCHT, the number of malicious users in the 
system has a significant impact on the network causing the 
secondary users suffer from degradation in the quality of 
their communication due to the transmission from the 
malicious users.

Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 are the plots for the probability of 
miss detection vs. the number of simulation times and 
False alarm vs. the number of simulation times 
respectively, Probability of miss detection and false alarms 
are calculated for 600 times of simulations. The threshold 
value for this simulation is set to 2, i.e. λ=2. The number of 
malicious users in this case is set to be M=35, the radius of 
outer region R=400m, Radius of primary exclusive region 
R0=40m, primary transmitter power Pt=120Kw, malicious 
transmitter power Pm=5w, σm =5.5dB, σp = 8dB.  
As we can see from the experiment, the probability of 
false alarm ( Successful PUEA) is always close to 0.326 
(within ±0.04 of this value) for the all number of 
simulation runs and this is because the high number of 
malicious which we set at  M=35. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The miss detection probability is averaged at 0.187 for 
the whole 600 runs, as one can see in Fig. 8.

We have done the simulation with different values of λ, 
as shown in Table III, and we have noted that when λ is 
decreased, the probability of successful PUEA decreased 
and the miss detection probability is increased; this is as 
expected, since NPCHT only allows a threshold to be set 
on either false alarm or miss detection probabilities.

V.     CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we presented an analytical and 
experimental approach to obtain the PDFs of received 
powers at the secondary users due from malicious users 
and also due from the primary transmitter in a CR network 
by a set of malicious users.  
The PDF obtained was used in Neyman-Pearson 
Composite Hypothesis Test to show the probability of false 
alarm in the network. Our results show that number of 
malicious users in the system has a great impact on the 
network causing the secondary users to suffer degradation 
in the quality of their communication due to the 
transmission from the malicious users.  Also we show that 
there is a range of network radii in which PUEA are most 
successful.  
The future work will be as a second stage of this work; 
in this stage, we will propose a security algorithm for 
transmitter verification scheme based on two parameters 
(distance and received signal power level) in order to 
identify the primary and malicious users; this kind of 
mitigation technique for PUEA does not rely on 
examination of PDF, but rather on localization of signal 
source.
