Abstract— The launch of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
has always been a challenging operation and witnessed various 
failures in the past decades. The current traditional ramp 
launchers are employing a rail and are powered by 
pneumatic/hydraulic systems. This paper discusses a new 
launch system for fixed-wing UAVs powered by linear 
synchronous motors and a special track. This novel idea has the 
potential to be developed to a new technique for launching fixed-
wing UAVs. In this paper, linear synchronous motor is 
recommended as a source of generating launch thrust. The 
control of launch process is conducted utilizing an optimal 
controller. Advantages for this method are lower cost, higher 
reliability, stability, and safety.  The verification and validation 
of the technique are documented using MATLAB simulation. 
This novel automatic launch system - powered by linear 
synchronous motors - provides a lower cost and a higher 
reliability than current launchers.

 INTRODUCTION 
    The vast majority of ﬁxed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
(UAV) employ conventional launch and recovery techniques 
(i.e., conventional takeoff and landing). UAVs without a 
landing gear do not require a runway and are launched via 
various techniques, such as rail launchers; rocket launch; 
hand launch; and vertical takeoff. 
    A rail/ramp launcher eliminates the need for conventional 
landing gear for the purposes of takeoff. A ramp launcher is 
a mechanical device to accelerate a fixed-wing UAV to a 
minimum controllable airspeed before releasing it from 
launcher. The current traditional ramp launchers are 
employing a rail and are powered by pneumatic/hydraulic 
systems.  
     The current launch techniques have a few challenges 
including reliability, cost, stability, and safety. The electric 
launch technique that has not been employed so far in any 
unmanned aerial systems, have the potential to solve all these 
challenges. The novel technique presented in this paper is for 
the first time for launching an unmanned aircraft. 
     The pneumatic launching systems are typically designed 
as a catapult rail launcher. The energy storage is a 
compressed gas, usually the air is used, due to its availability 
and no cost. Air is pressurized by a compressor; and is stored 
in a high-pressure accumulator tank. The launch is performed 
by applying the compressed air force on UAV through a 
cylinder/pipe/tube along the ramp. The applied force can be 
regulated by adjusting the air pressure in order to support 
UAVs of different mass.  
    The hydraulic launching systems are much like the 
pneumatic ones. To perform a launch, a valve is quickly 
opened, so that the oil is pumped inside the cylinder to push 
the piston. Consequently, the gas is compressed on the other 
side. 
    The electric launching system is very much different from 
pneumatic and hydraulic ones. External power is usually used 
for starting the engine or maintenance activities on the UAV. 
The external power system allows operation of various 
electrical systems without discharging the onboard battery. 
The idea here is to use a special type of electric motors, 
referred to as the Linear Synchronous Motor (LSM). A LSM 
is a motor by which the mechanical motion is in synchronism 
with the magnetic field. A linear electric motor is a motor that 
has its stator and rotor unrolled. So, instead of producing a 
torque, it generates a linear force along its length.  
    To achieve benefits similar to those seen in hybrid-/all-
electric ground-based and marine vehicles, large electric 
machines have been developed for aircraft electric propulsion 
[1][2]. 
Subsonic 
LSMs 
with 
high-temperature 
superconducting magnets are designed [3] to accelerate to a 
velocity of 1200 km/h in the near-vacuum tubes of 0.001 atm. 
A method for designing DC-excited linear synchronous 
motor as a drive system is presented by [4]. Design and 
characteristic analysis on the short-stator LSM for high-speed 
maglev propulsion is provided by [5]. 
    The application of LSMs has revolutionized the high-
speed passenger transport systems and trains [6][7] in a 
number of countries including Europe, Japan, and China. 
Linear synchronous electric motors have been widely 
employed in industry applications such as in roller coasters. 
They can drive a linear motion load without gears and 
mechanical intermediates. For instance, the Incredible Hulk 
roller coaster [8] was designed in 1999 as part of a 1-billion-
dollar park construction. In this roller coaster, 230 electric 
motors power a series of drive tires which provides 0 to 40 
mph in 2 seconds at a 30° incline. Section III provides 
fundamentals and technical specification of LSMs. 
    In the past decade, a number of new launch techniques and 
new launch power sources have been developed. DARPA and 
Aurora have developed a new runway independent UAV 
launch and recovery system; called SideArm [9]; which is 
capable of both land and sea-based operations. It brings

runway independence to a new class of fixed wing UAVs. 
The SideArm is a self-contained, portable apparatus to launch 
and retrieve other unmanned aircraft from trucks, ships and 
fixed bases. 
    The Insitu [10] trailer-mounted Mark 4 launcher - a self-
powered by an onboard diesel fuel generator and air 
compressor - is compatible with all of Insitu’s unmanned 
aircraft. The setup of this launcher with a weight of 4,200 lb, 
a deployed length of 22 ft, and with two operators, takes 
about minutes. The AAI RQ-7 Shadow is also launched from 
a trailer-mounted pneumatic catapult. Its pneumatic launcher 
can accelerate the 170 kg air vehicle to 70 knots in 12 m. 
    The rest of the paper is organized as follow. In Section II, 
fundamentals of launch technique and governing equations 
will be described. The launch power system using Linear 
Synchronous Motors are discussed in Section III. The launch 
control system employing an optimal controller is presented 
in Sections IV and V. The verification and validation of the 
technique are documented using MATLAB simulation in 
Section VI.

FUNDAMENTALS OF RAIL LAUNCHERS 
   In a rail launch, the aerial vehicle is placed on the rail; when 
started, moves in the launcher along the rail for a very short 
time. In an ideal situation, a straight motion is desired for the 
UAV along the launcher. Major elements of a launcher 
(Figure 1) are ramp/slipway, elevation platform/mechanism, 
mobility wheels, transportation truck, power source, and push 
mechanism. Unlike missiles, there is often no rush in 
launching a UAV; thus, the azimuth and elevation platforms 
are adjusted by human operators, rather than through a 
closed-loop control system. 
    In the design of a launcher, parameters such as launcher 
length, launcher weight, launch angle, and the required force 
and power must be determined. Moreover, the type of source 
of launcher power (here, electric) needs to be formulated. 
 
 
Figure 1. Major elements of a launcher 
    The launch process is basically a linear accelerated motion, 
where the UAV is accelerating along the ramp. The 
relationship between acceleration, launch speed, and 
launcher length has signiﬁcant implications for launcher 
design. In launch operation, a large structural load on the 
UAV is often imposed, due to a high linear acceleration. 
When a moving object with an initial velocity of V1 
accelerates to a new velocity of V2, the distance (x) covered 
is governed by the following equation: 
𝑉𝐿
2 − 𝑉1
2 = 2𝑎𝐿𝑅   
        
      (1) 
where “a” represents the linear acceleration. For an UAV 
launcher, the initial velocity is often zero, and the distance 
traveled is equal to the length of ramp launcher (LR). In order 
for a launcher to create such acceleration, it must provide a 
sufficient launch force (FL). Along the launcher ramp, sum of 
the forces along x-axis creates the acceleration. The 
contributing forces in this accelerated launching motion are 
launch force (including UAV engine thrust); FL; UAV-ramp 
nonlinear friction force; Ff; UAV weight (W = mg), UAV 
drag (D), UAV lift (L), where m denotes the UAV mass. In 
the x direction (along the ramp), the momentum equation is: 
𝐹𝐿 − 𝐹𝑓 − 𝐷 = 𝑚𝑎 
          
      (2) 
The aerodynamic forces of lift and drag [11] are:  
𝐿 =
1
2 𝜌𝑉2𝑆𝐶𝐿  
       
          
      (3) 
𝐷 =
1
2 𝜌𝑉2𝑆𝐶𝐷             
           
     (4) 
where ρ is air density V is velocity, S is wing planform area, 
and CL and CD are the lift and drag coefficients respectively. 
The friction force is proportional to the UAV normal force 
(x-component of the weight minus lift), N. It is the product 
of the coefficient of friction  with the normal force N, and 
acts to oppose the motion. Hence, the UAV-Ramp friction 
force (Ff) is: 
𝐹𝑓 = 𝜇𝑁  
    
  
      (5) 
where  is the friction coefficient between launcher rails and 
the UAV (indeed, two metals), and N denotes the normal 
force on the ramp. UAV weight and UAV lift are two 
contributing forces to the normal force. The ramp (Figure 2) 
has frequently a launch (i.e., climb) angle, . 
𝑁 = 𝑊𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 − 𝐿  
          
      (6) 
 
 
Figure 2. Contributing forces on a launcher 
    The friction coefficient () between a UAV and the 
launcher rails is typically about 0.05-0.12. When the friction 
force from equations 5 and 6 is substituted into equation 4, 
we obtain: 
𝐹𝐿 = 𝑊𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃(1 + µ) + 𝑚𝑎 
      (7) 
    This is the force (FL) that the launcher (indeed, the 
LSM) and UAV engine must provide to generate the desired 
acceleration during the launch operation. The engine thrust is 
contributing to the launch process; it will create a portion of 
the required launch force.

LINEAR SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR PROPULSION SYSTEM 
    A launcher requires a power supply for the activation of 
mechanisms such as the elevation platform. This paper 
introduces a new launch system for fixed-wing UAVs 
powered by LSM and a special track. Basically, the idea is 
that by launching the UAV along the rails at an angle, using 
LSMs and an electric power supply.  
    In general, a linear synchronous motor propulsion system 
is composed of two components, one is the LSM and the 
other is the power supply. A linear synchronous motor [12] 
is a motor by which the mechanical motion is in synchronism 
with the magnetic field. The force is generated as an action 
of traveling magnetic field produced by a poly-phase winding 
and an array of magnetic poles or a variable reluctance 
ferromagnetic rail. To reduce cost, synchronous linear motors 
rarely use commutators, so the rotor often contains permanent 
magnets, or soft iron. 
    To minimize the vehicle’s weight, the electric system 
interconnections should be optimized (e.g., use smaller 
diameter wires). In wiring modules, it is recommended to 
place the wiring to one side of the module rack, so that, the 
other side will be free and available for temporary hookups. 
LSMs are currently in use in amusement parks around the 
world as a method to launch roller coasters, and they have 
been proven to be reliable at quickly and smoothly 
accelerating large payloads hundreds of times a day.  
    A linear electric motor is a motor that has its stator and 
rotor unrolled (one part over the launcher aril, and one part 
attached under the UAV). So, instead of producing a torque, 
it generates a linear force along its length. In a linear 
synchronous motor, the mechanical motion is in synchronism 
with the magnetic field. LSM drives a load (here, a UAV) 
linearly without a need to gears and mechanical 
intermediates. Linear synchronous motors are the low-
acceleration, high speed and high-power motors with an 
active winding on one side of the air-gap and an array of 
alternate-pole magnets on the other side. Figure 3 illustrates 
the free-body diagram of a synchronous linear motor.

Figure 3. Free-body diagram of a linear synchronous motor 
    The UAV is lay attached to a cart on the rails and will 
accelerate to the desired speed. The track (rail) contains on-
board exciting magnets for LSM. Flux from the exciting 
magnet interacts with the traveling magnetic wave from the 
stator to generate launch force. The launch force is generated 
as an action of traveling magnetic field produced by a poly-
phase winding and an array of magnetic poles or a variable 
reluctance ferromagnetic rail. The part that generates the 
magnetic flux or variable reluctance is referred to as salient 
pole rail. The part that generates the traveling magnetic field 
is referred to as the armature.  
    The length of required track is mainly a function of UAV 
weight, launch angle and launch power. LSMs benefit from 
high efficiency due to low magnetizing current and zero slip. 
This leads to a significant reduction of inverter rating, 
resulting in a substantial cost saving. 
    The LSM is selected as a source of generating launch thrust 
along the track. The model modeling of LSMs nonlinear, 
long, and complicated. The electromagnetic launch force 
developed by a LSM is obtained by: 
𝐹 =
𝑃𝑒𝑙𝑚
𝑢𝑠   
 
    
      (8) 
    where Pelm is the electromagnetic power and us is the 
synchronous speed. The Pelm and us are functions of 
frequency of primary supply, the number of armature phase, 
rms value of the input voltage, and the rms value of armature 
current. The electromagnetic power and the synchronous 
speed are obtained by: 
𝑃𝑒𝑙𝑚 = 𝑚𝑉1𝐼𝑎𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜙) − 𝑚𝑅1𝐼𝑎
2  
         
      (9) 
𝑢𝑠 = 2𝑓𝜏  
 
        
    (10) 
    where 𝑚 represents the number of armature phase 
number, cos() is the input power factor, Ia is the rms value 
of armature current, R1 is armature winding resistance, and 
𝑉1 is the rms value of the input voltage, 𝑓 is the frequency of 
primary supply, and  is the mover (pole) pitch. The armature 
current is a function of desired launch force (FL): 
𝐼𝑎 =
𝐹𝐿𝑢𝑠(1
𝜂−1)
𝜌𝑤𝑙𝑤𝑗𝑐   
 
        
    (11) 
     where 𝑗𝑐 is the amplitude of linear current density, 𝜌𝑤 is 
the electrical resistivity of the primary windings, and 𝑙𝑤 is the 
primary windings length. The parameter 𝜂 is estimated in 0 - 
1 range and will be finalized during the design. The two most 
generally used conductors (for wire windings) are copper and 
aluminum.  Copper has a higher conductivity (about 40% 
more); is more ductile; has relatively high tensile strength; 
and can be easily soldered.  Copper is more expensive and 
heavier than aluminum.  
    This launch system has a number of significant 
advantages as compared with conventional launchers. 
Loading UAV and setting them up would also take much less 
time and effort than other power systems. 
IV. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL 
    To optimize the launch operation, a closed-loop optimal 
control system is employed. The optimal control - Linear 
Quadratic Regulator (LQR) [13] - is based on the 
optimization of some specific performance criterion; or 
Performance Index; J. In this technique, no disturbance, 
noise, or uncertainty is considered.  
    We are interested in minimizing the error of the system; 
any deviation from equilibrium point is considered an error. 
To this end, an error-squared performance index is defined. 
For a system with one state variable, x1, we have

    An optimization technique for a dynamic system in state-
space format is employed. The LQR is an optimal controller 
and is defined as follows. The system of interest is of the 
form: 
 𝑥
• = 𝐴𝑥 + 𝐵𝑢                         (13a) 
𝑦 = 𝐶𝑥 + 𝐷𝑢 
                   (13b) 
    Given the weighting matrices Q and R, the design task is 
to find the optimal control signal u(t) such that the quadratic 
cost function: 
𝐽 =
1
2 ∫ (𝑥𝑇𝑄𝑥 + 𝑢𝑇𝑅𝑢)𝑑𝑡
∞
0
         
    (14) 
is minimized. The solution to this problem is:  
𝑢 = −𝐾𝑥  
       
    (15) 
where 
𝐾 = 𝑅−1𝐵𝑇𝑃 
        
    (16) 
and P is the unique, positive semi-definite solution to the 
Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE): 
𝑃𝐴 + 𝐴𝑇𝑃 + 𝑄 − 𝑃𝐵𝑅−1𝐵𝑇𝑃 = 0   
    (17) 
    Based on this technique, the LQR gains are calculated 
using a MATLAB code, and then a control system is 
designed. The engineering judgment skill must be utilized in 
the selection of Q and R. Tuning techniques are 
recommended in the determination of design parameters. For 
instance, Q and R must be such that the detectability (i.e., 
(√𝑄, 𝐴) must be detectable) and observability requirements 
are met.  
    The LQR is a popular optimal control technique that has 
been successfully applied to control several UAV 
configurations. The LQR was successfully used [14] in 
stabilizing a Yamaha RMAX helicopter. 
V. 
LAUNCH CONTROL SYSTEM 
The electromechanical mathematical model of the stage with 
loads is formulated by employing the governing equation 
presented in Section III. The equation of motion can be stated 
in terms of electric current (i) and distance travelled (x) as: 
m𝑥̈(𝑡) = 𝐹𝑒 − 𝐹𝑓 − 𝐷 
 
    (18) 
By inserting models of electromagnetic force, friction force, 
and drag into equation 18, we obtain: 
m𝑉̇ (𝑡) = 𝐾𝑒𝑖(𝑡) − 𝐾𝑓𝑥̇(𝑡) − 𝐾𝐷𝑥̇(𝑡) 
    (19) 
or,  
𝑉̇ (𝑡) =
𝐾𝑒
𝑚 𝑖(𝑡) −
𝐾𝑓+𝐾𝐷
𝑚
𝑥̇(𝑡)                      (20) 
where Fe denotes the electromagnetic force (here, the launch 
force, FL), Ke represents thrust coefficient and the Kf and KD 
denote friction and drag factors respectively. The inherent 
force ripple and the effects of the magnetic flux distortions 
and saturations are neglected for simplicity. The launch angle 
is assumed to be constant, and two parameters of velocity (V) 
and acceleration (a) are controlled. By reformatting equation 
20, the state space representation of the launcher from is 
obtained: 
[𝑥̇

 (21) 
    According to Equation (21), and the relation between 
linear acceleration and linear speed, the block diagram of the 
linear motor positioning system is illustrated in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Block diagram of the electric launcher control system 
    In literature, various aspects of LSMs including their 
modeling, analysis, design, and control have been discussed. 
For instance, Ref. [5] has presented the design and 
characteristic analysis on the short-stator LSM for high-speed 
Maglev propulsion. Here, we use a linear model, since the 
objective of this paper is mainly to provide the effectiveness 
of hybrid launch system.  
    Two important motion parameters need to be controlled 
during a launch operation: 1. Velocity (V), 2. Acceleration 
(a). This objective requires a closed-loop feedback control 
system using an appropriate control law. The goal of control 
law is to have a near-constant acceleration at start of the 
launch but ease off slightly at the end. Proximity sensors 
should be installed at increments along the track to measure 
and report UAV position and speed to calculate the linear 
acceleration. For safety reasons, some other parameters such 
as the armature current (i) of LSMs may be controlled too.  
    The block diagram of closed-loop control system of the 
launch operation is shown in Figures 5. There are motion 
sensors for three outputs: 1. Position is measured, 2. Velocity 
is calculated by differentiation of position, and incorporating 
time of measurement, 3. Acceleration is calculated by 
differentiation of velocity, and incorporating time of 
measurement. 
 
 
Figure 5. Block diagram of control system of the launch operation 
    The controller sends full-power signal to the motor when 
triggered. Due to the linear motion of the UAV along the 
track, an optimal control law will suffice in effectively 
controlling the launch operation. This dynamic system is 
modeled with two state variables, one input, and two outputs. 
The state space model is: 
𝐴 = [

The state and output variables are:

The control signal u is given (Figure 6) by 
u = k1(r - x1) - k2 x2 = k1 r - (k1 x1 + k2 x2)              (23) 
For a zero-reference input (i.e.,  r = 0):

u = -k1 x1 - k2 x2 = - Kx                               (24) 
To determine the state-feedback gain matrix K, where 
K = [k1  k2]                                       (25) 
 
Figure 6. Quadratic optimal regulator system for the launcher 
    The modified state-space representation is developed by 
incorporating two feedbacks into the original plant: 
𝑥
• = 𝐴𝑥 + 𝐵(−𝐾𝑥 + 𝑘1𝑟) = (𝐴 − 𝐵𝐾)𝑥 + 𝐵𝑘1𝑟     (26) 
    Therefore, the revised state-space model matrices are: 
A1 = A – B*K; B1 = B*K(1); C1= C; D1= D        (27) 
    The new state-space model can be used in the simulation 
to determine the behavior of the system. Two objectives of 
control are: 1. Keep the acceleration below 7g, 2. Keep the 
launch speed to follow the desired velocity profile. UAV 
weight plays a major role in control parameters due to incline 
angle. The controller is generating a signal to the actuators 
(i.e., LSM) based on the control law. The LQR gains are 
functions of LSM features and UAV weight. Tabular values 
for LQR gains may be determined for various UAVs weights.  
    The main output of the LQR controller is the rms value of 
armature current (Ia or just i), which will be the input to the 
LSM. The main output of the LSM and the track is the launch 
force (F), which will be the input to the UAV. To reduce 
“jerk”, we need to have an overdamped velocity profile. To 
have a successful launch, the wind speed and direction should 
be measured at the launch site and incorporated in the control 
process.  
VI. 
SIMULATION AND RESULTS  
    In order to validate the design outcome, a launch system 
including a linear model of LSM for launching a UAV with 
a mass of 20 kg has been simulated by matlab Simulink. It is 
desired that the UAV reaches the velocity of 10 m/sec along 
the track before the end of launch operation. 
    The simulation is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of 
the proposed launch system with the control algorithm. 
Figures 7 through 11 illustrate the simulation results for: 1. 
LSMs current in Amps, 2. Velocity of UAV in m/sec, 3. 
Vehicle 
non-dimensionalized 
acceleration, 
4. 
UAV 
displacement in meter, 5. Force generated by LSM in N, and 
6. Electric power provided to LSMs in W, respectively.  It is 
assumed that voltage for LSMs is 120 Volts.  
 
Figure 7. Variations of LSM current (in Amps) 
    From Figure 7, the maximum current is about 30 Amps at 
0.1 seconds to the launch. When the UAV reaches the desired 
velocity, the LSM current is reduced to almost zero.  
 
 
Figure 8. Variations of UAV velocity (in m/sec) 
    In Figure 8, the desired velocity of 10 m/sec (blue line) is 
a given value and shown. It can be seen that the UAV reaches 
this velocity in about 0.5 seconds (intersection of red graph 
with blue line) and continue to increase to about 10.5 m/sec 
due to the UAV linear momentum. Since no brake is 
considered in the launch system, the velocity is not reduced 
back to 10 m/sec during launch.  
 
 
Figure 9. Variations of normalized acceleration 
    As shown in Figure 9, the maximum non-dimensionalized 
acceleration, i.e., (in g) is about 7, it happens in the beginning 
of launch. When the vehicle reaches the desired velocity, the 
acceleration will become zero. 
 
 
Figure 10. Variations of vehicle displacement (in m) 
    As shown in Figure 10, after 1 second, the vehicle has 
displaced about 9 m. From this part of the simulation, it is 
concluded that a launch track with the length of 9 meters is 
required to launch a UAV with a mass of 20 kg. To have a 
launch site for UAVs with various masses, a longer launch 
track should be constructed. 
    As Figure 11 indicates, the maximum force generated by 
LSM is 1400 N at the beginning of launch. When the vehicle 
reaches the desired velocity, this force will become almost 
zero. Afterward, a small amount of force is needed to cover 
the track friction and UAV drag.

Figure 11. Variations of the LSM generated force 
        The maximum electric power provided to LSMs is 3.5 
kW after about 0.1 seconds. The engine of the vehicle should 
be started when the vehicle reaches the desired velocity (i.e., 
before UAV reaches the end of launch track). However, if the 
UAV own engine is operating along the track (concurrent 
with LSM), the vehicle will have a much faster velocity at the 
end of the launch operation.  
    By examining the simulation results, one can conclude that 
launch operation utilizing electric power is feasible. Using 
the LQR controller, the UAV is tracking and following the 
desired velocity on the track. For other UAVs with different 
weights, the LQR gains should be adjusted/changed. As the 
simulation results indicate, the launch operations using LSM 
is successful. Since the vehicle is along the ramp and uses a 
special rail connection, the UAV is stable and reliable.  
    Moreover, this system can be employed over and over 
again for various UAVs, so the overall launch cost is much 
lower than a vertical launch. The investment for the track and 
LSM is for a long run application. Furthermore, there is no 
possibility of explosion by UAV engines, since the launch 
power system is of electric type.  
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
    This paper presented a new launch system for fixed-wing 
UAVs powered by linear synchronous motors and a special 
track. This novel idea has the potential to be developed to a 
new technique for launching fixed-wing UAVs. In this paper, 
LSM was recommended as the source of generating launch 
force. The control of launch process was conducted utilizing 
an optimal controller. The most notable advantages of this 
technique are lower cost, higher reliability, stability, and 
safety. A difficulty in this technique is a relatively heavy 
equipment. For the future work, the next technical step would 
be to focus on reducing weight of the power system and 
improving the efficiency of this electric launcher.
