Abstract—In this paper, a CMOS down-conversion mixer for 
UWB applications is presented. The mixer circuit is designed 
using a VIS 0.25μm RF CMOS technology, working at the 
0.9GHz-10.6GHz frequency range; it will be used in 
applications such as IEEE WiFi, GSM and WiMAX. The core 
of the mixer has been designed based on double-balanced cell 
architecture, and uses the current bleeding method to increase 
the linearity and improve the conversion gain. We put a 
resistor on the drain of the MOS between two RF inputs, which 
will improve the flatness of conversion gain. Regarding the 
arrangement of the mixer, the RF frequency is set at 0.9GHz-
10.6GHz, the LO frequency 0.8GHz-10.5GHz and the IF of 
100MHz. The simulated conversion gain of the mixer is 7±
1dB. The 1dB compression point is higher than -11dBm at high 
frequency and -9dBm at low frequency. The RF input return 
loss is well below -11dB, and the LO input return loss is below 
-10dB. The noise figure is 12.93dB while IF is 100MHz, and the 
mixer core dissipates 9.8mW under a 1.8 V supply.

 INTRODUCTION 
The requirements of wireless communication systems 
have been increasing rapidly over the last few decades. 
Higher speed transportation, lower power consumption, low 
cost and operating on multi-band have been very important 
considerations in wireless development [1]. The new design 
technique for ultra wide-band wireless communications must 
be carried out with future high-precision applications in mind. 
Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), worldwide Interoperability for 
Microwave Access (WiMAX) [2-5] and Global Systems for 
Mobile Communications (GSM) are very common in 
modern life. A lot of mobile devices, like personal computers, 
mobile phones, and digital music players can be connected to 
Wi-Fi networks, but only within a limited area. 
WiMAX is a form of wireless communication; its 
standard is  known as IEEE 802.16x. The area of WiMAX is 
very large and can be used within entire residential districts, 
remote areas, or in SOHO internets. Its application will 
benefit the mobility of individuals, families and companies. 
GSM is the most popular standard of mobile phones. By 
Q4 2012, over 3.2 billion people were using GSM 
technology [6] and the world market share of GSM is over 
80% [7].   
In this work, a 0.9GHz~10.6GHz ultra wide band (UWB) 
down conversion mixer was designed for use in a variety of 
applications, such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and GSM. However, 
the linearity and noise figures of a mixer should be 
continuously 
improved 
for 
future 
high-sensitivity 
applications. In Section II, the circuit design aspect is 
described. Section III includes post-simulation results, and 
conclusions are presented in Section IV. 
II. 
CIRCUIT DESIGN 
This circuit uses the process of standard complementary 
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 0.25μm 1P5M 
technology, and we used Advanced Design System (ADS) 
requirements to simulate the circuit. The Radio Frequency 
(RF) input frequency was between 0.9GHz and10.6GHz, and 
the Local Oscillator (LO) input frequency was set between 
0.8GHz and 10.5GHz. The Intermediate Frequency (IF) 
output frequency was 100MHz. The Gilbert structure [8] was 
modified to complete this circuit, and improve it over a 
double-balanced mixer. Figure 1 shows the whole circuit 
diagram. 
  
Figure 1.  Down-Conversion Mixer 
As shown in Figure 1, LO stages of transistors from M5 
to M8 are designed using MOS switches. M1 and M2 are 
operated on the saturation region to act as conductors and to 
permit RF signals to go through the gate and become current 
signals. M3 and M4 act as the paths of current bleedings to 
make more current flow into M1 and M2, thereby increasing 
the conversion gain and reducing noise. R3 and R4 block the 
signals into M3 and M4, and can also act as the self-bias 
voltages of M3 and M4. C7 and C8 prevent the bias voltages 
and allow the signals to go through them to M3 and M4. If 
this is the case, M3 and M4 can not only provide the paths

for current bleeding but can also amplify the signals. 
Capacitors from C1 to C6 act as DC blocks, and a common 
source amplifier is implemented to be the IF output buffer. 
The flatness of conversion gain is also very important to 
the UWB mixer, so a resistor is embedded between the 
drains of M1 and M2.  Figure 2 shows that C7, R3 and R5 
combine to form a high pass filter, as shown in Figure 3.  
This decreases the gain of low frequency to improve the 
flatness of conversion gain, as shown in Figure 4. The 
conversion gain can be sacrificed to improve flatness.

SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS  
Figures 5 to 11 depict the post-simulation result using 
ADS software. The supply voltage and power consumption 
are 1.8V and 18.3mW, respectively. The maximum 
conversion gain of the mixer was simulated at 8.8 dB at a 
frequency of 2.9 GHz, while the minimum was 5.7 dB at 
10.6 GHz, and an average of 7.25 dB over the band. A plot 
of the conversion gain versus frequency is shown in Figure 5. 
Figures 6 and 7 show RF and LO input matching, since it is a 
UWB mixer and the return loss is less than 8dB.  Figure 8 
represents P-1dB, with three frequencies chosen for 
simulation. The results range from about -8.5 to -11dBm.

conversion gain. LO power was set at 0dBm in the

The layout of this circuit is shown in Figure 13, and will 
be fabricated in a VIS 0.25μm RF CMOS process. The total 
area of the chip is less than 1.33 mm2.  As observed, there 
are two pairs of on-chip spiral inductors in this design. Their 
values have been selected to be as small as possible, so that 
first-order parameters: inductance and resistance remain 
almost unchanged within the operating frequency.  
The performance of the proposed wideband mixer and a 
comparison with other existing mixers [9-11] around the 
same frequency range are summarized in Table II. The 
advantage of the proposed mixer represents excellent 
properties of linearity and low noise figures.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This UWB down-conversion mixer combines the 
advantages of the current-bleeding technique and a variable 
MOS-resistor with the VIS process of CMOS 0.25μm 1P5M. 
We used the technique of current bleeding and put a resistor 
between the drains of the RF input conductors to benefit the 
flatness of conversion gain. Since there are four different 
supply voltages, it was necessary to reduce the number of 
voltages to achieve lower cost. Combining these techniques 
with the use of a wideband low noise amplifier and voltage 
controlled oscillator to act as a SOC chip is our ultimate goal.
