Abstract—The objective of this study is to evaluate the
quantification
process
of
geometric
parameters
such
as
material volume, when different computed microtomography
spatial resolutions are employed. To this end, two reservoir
rock samples were scanned with a three-dimensional high
energy computed microtomography system. The results show a
strong difference in the acquisition, reconstruction and image
processing times, but do not present a significant loss of
information on the micro structural parameters such as
porosity between the two resolutions.
Keywords-X-ray; microtomography; rock.

INTRODUCTION
High
resolution
3D
computed
microtomography
(microCT) is a powerful technique used to visualize and
characterize the internal structure of objects. It is a non-
destructive method that produces images of the internal
structure of an object which does not need to be previously
modified, i.e., the object inspected does no need to be
subjected to a preparation method such as impregnation,
thinning or polishing [1]. In this technique, contiguous
sequential images are compiled to create 3D representations
that
may
be
digitally
processed
to
obtain
relevant
quantitative
geometric
and/or
morphologic
parameters,
depending on the focus of the investigation [2]. The great
advantage
of
microtomography
is
that
quantitative
information such as volume, size, shape, distribution and
connectivity of the rock pores can be obtained through the
entire 3D volume of the samples, from micro-scale to nano-
scale.
MicroCT physical principle is based on the attenuation of
X-rays when they interact with the object. The intensity of
the photons crossing the object depends on the number of
atoms by volume unit (density) and on the type of the atoms
throughout the beam. In order to obtain the image of a
section of a test specimen it is necessary to obtain many
projections in constant angular steps [3]. Beam hardening
artifacts in gray level, which may show up in the images,
manifest due to the preferential attenuation of low energy
photons. This process can be minimized using metallic
filters to eliminate low energy photons from the incident
radiation. When the object is a rock sample it is common to
insert a combination of two metallic filters such as
aluminum and copper [4].
It is know that the better the spatial resolution of the
images in microCT the better the visualization of small
details. However, the quantification of structural parameters
in microCT is extremely dependent on image resolution,
which may affect final data interpretation [5-7].
The objective of this study is to evaluate the changes that
occur in the entire quantification process (acquisition,
reconstruction and processing) of geometric parameters,
such as porosity, of reservoir rocks when different image
resolutions are employed. For that purpose it will be used
high resolution microCT equipment and several holes in two
rocks will be the focal point of this investigation.
In
the
next
sections
it
will
be
described
all
the
experimental conditions that the carbonates were submitted,
as well as the methodology used to characterize the rocks.
The geometric parameters used in this study were the total
volume of the binary-converted objects within the volume
of interest, the percentage of the volume of interest occupied
by binary, the total porous space volume and total porosity.
After that section, for each experimental condition and
imaging processing, the results are analyzed and discussed
and the 3D microCT visualization will be presented
together.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The reservoir rocks used in this study are of the
carbonated type and were named samples 1 and 2 (Fig. 1).
Five holes were made in the sample 1 and nine holes in
sample 2, in a way that their dimensions are known. Thus, it
is possible to evaluate the accuracy and precision of 3D
quantification by microCT.
MicroCT's
were
obtained
in
a
high
energy
microtomography system (Skyscan/Bruker, model 1173).
The samples were placed in the experimental equipment
inside an acrylic cylinder with a 1.0mm thickness for
sample 1 and a 3.1mm thickness for sample 2. This ensured
that the samples
would
not move during the entire
acquisition process, which lasted about 1 or 2 hours,
depending on the resolution used.
The system was calibrated to operate at 130kV of energy
and a current of 61 μA. The microCT system has 2 built-in
metallic filter options: aluminum (with a thickness of
65

1.0mm) and brass (0.15mm thick). The intention of these
filters is to reduce the contribution of low energy photons to
minimize the effects of beam hardening. In the present
study, a combination of two filters was used: copper
(0.15mm thick) and aluminum (1.0mm thick).
The spatial resolutions used in this study were 10 μm and
20 μm. In these conditions the distances source- sample and
source- detector were of 72.8mm and 291.2mm for the
10μm resolution and of 148.3mm and 215.7mm for the
20μm resolution, respectively. A flat panel detector was
used (2240 x 2240 pixels) to register the cone X-ray beam
transmission. The projection images were taken 360º at each
step of 0.50º rotation.

in the spotlight and (b) photograph of sample 2, also with their dimensions
and the holes in the spotlight.
After the acquisition process, the radiographic images
were rebuilt. For such, Nrecon ® [08] - version 1.6.4.1 and
InstaRecon [09] - version 1.3.5.0 softwares were used, the
algorithm of which is based on the works of Feldkamp [10].
The reconstruction software used allows the selection of
many parameters thus creating a better quality image.
Artifact corrections can be made in the image such as
correction of the ring artifact that shows up as total or partial
rotation-axis centered circles, caused by changes on the
output
of
individual
detectors
or
set
of
detectors.
Corrections of beam hardening can also be made, which
turns the object borders shinier than the center even in
homogeneous
materials
since
low energy
X-rays
are
attenuated more promptly than high energy X-rays.
The most important parameters are the use of smoothing
filters in different degrees (1 to 10), reduction of ring
artifacts in different levels (1 to 20) and beam hardening
correction in different levels (1% to 100%). In this study,
Gaussian smoothing filters with degree 1, a ring artifact
reduction with level 15 for sample 1 and level 10 for sample
2 and a beam hardening artifact correction with a degree of
20% for sample 1 and of 25% for sample 2 were used. The
Kernel Gaussian smoothing filter is characterized as a
smoothing applied to projections. It smoothes each pixel
with a MxN neighborhood, where M is the horizontal
dimension and N the vertical dimension. It reduces noise
and searches for a proper smoothing level. Ring artifact
reduction is also applied to projection before image pre-
processing so that the average projection is used for this
purpose. It is possible to select the depth of this correction
in a 1 to 20 pixel gap. Beam hardening can be obtained
through linear transformation and depth correction can be
chosen according to the material density. A high order in the
polynomial function can also be used for this purpose.
The Skyscan, CTAn ® [11] (v.1.11.8.0) software was
used for image processing and analysis. In this stage the
objective was to quantify geometric parameters related to
the holes created in each of the samples at the laboratory.
These holes were made with a 0.9 mm wide drill in sample
1 and a 1.0 mm wide drill in sample 2. Thus, the final
dimension of the holes drilled were of 9.3 mm, 3.7 mm,
3.4 mm, 3.0 mm and 4.1 mm depth for sample 1 and of 9.0
mm, 4.9 mm, 3.5 mm, 4.5 mm, 4.0 mm, 4.4 mm, 4.1 mm,
4.35 mm and 4.3 mm depth for sample 2. Considering a
cylindrical
geometry
and
disregarding
the
narrowing
obtained at the end of each hole it is possible to say that the
volume of the holes were 14.92 ±0.02 mm3 in sample 1 and
33.75±0.02 mm3 in sample 2. The quantified parameters
were: total volume of the binary-converted objects within
the volume of interest, VOI, (BV, mm3), percentage of VOI
occupied by binary objects (BV/TV, %), total porous space
volume (Po. V(tot), mm3) and
total porosity percentage
(Po.(tot), %).
A region of interest (ROI) that contemplates both holes in
each sample and in each resolution was defined to conduct
the quantifications. All objects inside the ROI
were
analyzed. In this study, circular ROIs with a diameter equal
to 23.16mm and 14.48mm for samples 1 and 2, respectively,
were used.
It is important to highlight that a threshold (TH) value
separating both objects comprised in the ROI must be
chosen for the quantification process. There is no standard
method to determine the TH value. In this study a global TH
value equal to 30 was used, considering a 0 to 256 gap.
Thus, we could separate the pores (white) from the rock
matrix (black). Then, the parameters where quantified
directly in 3D based on a model of the rendered surface
volume. All objects in the selected region were analyzed
together and the integrated results were calculated as the
total volume of all objects.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The acquisitions generated data matrixes of 4224 x 4224
pixels and of 2240 x 2240 pixels for the 10 µm and 20 µm
resolutions,
respectively.
Such
matrix
sizes
have
the
disadvantage
of being
too
difficult
to
be
processed;
especially by microCT once their files can reach a 34.7GB
size (1200 images for each microCT test). Aiming to

improve the time for image processing the images passed
through a resize process before they were quantified. This
process allows reducing the size of an image and of a data
set by the average of voxel gray levels in a cube of specified
size. For example, resizing in a 2 factor opens a version of
the data set with 8 times less voxels (2x2x2). This allows a
very
quick
handling,
geometric
measuring
and
the
construction of models of lower spatial resolution. In this
study resizes of 2 and 4 were used.
Tables I-IV show the time for image processing obtained
in each condition used. The quantifications showed in
Tables III-IV were made based on the values of the matrixes
presented
in
Tables
I-II.
These
numbers
take
into
consideration the entire volume of the holes, which are the
objects of interest in this study.

As expected, this table shows that the higher the spatial
resolution the higher the time required for the data to be
obtained. However, when resize is used there is the need to
consider the change in the pixel's size, which may impair
the quantification of small structures. In this case, the size of
the pixel is increased, making us 'see' only the structures
from this new value, which leads us to analyze the
cost/benefit of this procedure.
Tables
III-IV
show
the
results
of
the
geometric
quantifications for 20 µm resolutions in both samples with
different pixel sizes obtained through the resize process and
without resize. Being the real volumes of the holes 14.92
±0.02 mm3 in sample 1 and 33.75 ±0.02 mm3 in sample 2
there is no significant difference in relation to the values
quantified in the 3D analysis.
The difference of less than 1% in the results of the
percentages of each parameter calculated in the 3D analysis,
of each sample between resolutions, is noticeable. Thus,
when necessary to characterize objects with the dimension
of the holes assessed in this study, a microCT test in the
quickest acquisition and image processing conditions can be
used since losses in the data obtained wee not significant.
Obviously, the smaller the size of the pixel the more detail
can be visualized in the image, generating more precise and
accurate quantitative results.
The tridimensional models built after the 3D analysis of
the holes may be observed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The 3D Computed Microtomography technique is adequate
for
the
characterization
of
reservoir
rocks,
supplying
internal
micro
structural
parameters
that
allow
the
petrophysical study of these materials. The differences
presented
in
all
stages
(acquisition,
reconstruction,
processing and analysis) show that for a high resolution
long acquisition and reconstruction periods are needed and
processing is difficult, demanding the use of resize. This
pixel size reduction tool proved to be very useful since it
optimizes the analysis process not causing a significant loss
of information. The next stages of this work is to analyze all
the pore space of rocks, not only the created holes and
further investigate the metrology associated with parameters
related to the porosity space.
