Abstract - The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is widely 
employed in a field of decision making, and its inner 
dependence version is useful for cases in which criteria are not 
enough independent. In this research, we investigate “partial 
inner dependence” structure, i.e., only some elements (subset)  
of the criteria are independent. For the partial inner 
dependence AHP, we propose a new kind of fuzzy weight 
representation that is valid even if a data matrix is not 
consistent or reliable enough. The representation can be 
defined by using the results of two kinds of the sensitivity 
analyses and fuzzy set.  
Keywords -  AHP; fuzzy set; sensitivity analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed by T.L. 
Saaty in 1977 [1] is widely used in decision making, 
because it reflects humans feelings naturally. The normal 
AHP assumes independence among all criteria, although it 
is difficult to choose enough independent elements. The 
inner dependence AHP [2] is used to solve this kind of 
problem when criteria have dependency. However, inner 
dependence method requires dependency matrix for all 
elements even if some criteria are independent.  In this 
research, we employ “partial inner dependence” structure. 
Our method divides a set of criteria to two subsets such as a 
dependent part and an independent part, then we can easily 
understand a relation among elements. 
On the other hand, the comparison data matrix may not 
have enough consistency when AHP is applied, because, for 
instance, a problem may contain too many criteria to make 
decision. It means that answers from decision-makers, i.e., 
components of the matrix, do not have enough reliability. 
They may be too ambiguous or too fuzzy [3][5]. To avoid 
this issue, we usually have to revise again, but it takes a lot 
of time and costs. Then, we consider that weights should 
also have ambiguity or fuzziness. Therefore, it is necessary 
to represent these weights using fuzzy set.  
In our research, we first apply sensitivity analysis to 
normal AHP to analyze how much the components of a 
pairwise comparison matrix influence the weight and/or 
consistency indices of the matrix. Next, we define new 
fuzzy weight representation of criteria for partial inner 
dependence AHP using L-R fuzzy numbers [4][6][7][8]. At 
last, we then propose overall fuzzy weight of alternatives 
when a comparison matrix among elements does not have 
enough consistency. 
In Sections 2 and 3, we introduce the partial inner 
dependence AHP, consistency index and sensitivity analyses 
for AHP. Then, in Section 4, we define fuzzy weight for 
partial inner dependence structure, and Section 5 is a 
summary. 
II.  CONSISTENCY AND INNER DEPENDENCE  
In this section, we introduce the processes of the normal 
AHP, its consistency and inner dependence extension. 
A. 
 Normal AHP 
    Usually, the AHP consists of following 4 processes.  
(Process 1) Representation of structure by a hierarchy. 
The problem under consideration can be represented in a 
hierarchical structure. At the middle levels, there are 
multiple criteria. Alternative elements are put at the lowest 
level of the hierarchy. 
(Process 2) Paired comparison between elements at each 
level. A pairwise comparison matrix A is created from a 
decision maker's answers. Let n be the number of elements 
at a certain level, the upper triangular components of the  
matrix aij (i< j = 1,…,n) are 9, 8, .. , 2, 1, 1/2, …, or 1/9. 
These denote intensities of importance from element i to j. 
The lower triangular components aji are described with 
reciprocal numbers, for diagonal elements, let aii = 1.  
(Process 3) Calculations of weight at each level. The 
weights of the elements, which represent grades of 
importance among each element, are calculated from the 
pairwise 
comparison 
matrix. 
The 
eigenvector 
that 
corresponds to a positive normalized (so as sum of 
components is 1) eigenvalue of the matrix is used in 
calculations throughout in the paper. 
(Process 4) Priority of an alternative by a composition of 
weights. With repetition of composition of weights, the 
overall weights of the alternative, which are the priorities of 
the alternatives with respect to the overall objective, are 
finally found. 
B. 
Consistency 
Since components of the comparison matrix are obtained 
by comparisons between two elements, coherent consistency 
is not guaranteed.  In AHP, the consistency of the

comparison matrix A is measured by the following 
consistency index (C.I.)  
where n is the order of comparison matrix A, and λA is its 
maximum eigenvalue (Frobenius root). 
If the value of C.I. becomes smaller, then the degree of 
consistency becomes higher, and vice versa. It is said that 
the comparison matrix is consistent if

C. 
Partial Inner Dependence Method  
The normal AHP ordinarily assumes independency 
among criteria, although it is difficult to choose enough 
independent elements in practice. The dependency means 
some kind of interaction among the elements. Inner 
dependence AHP [2] is used to solve this type of problem 
even for the case that criteria have dependency.  
In the inner dependence method, using a dependency 
matrix F={ fij }, we can calculate modified weights w(n) as 
follows, 
where w represents weights from independent criteria, i.e., 
normalized weight of normal AHP and dependency matrix 
F consists of eigenvectors of influence matrices that 
represent dependency among criteria. However, inner 
dependence method requires dependency matrix for all 
elements even if some criteria are independent.  In this 
research, we employ “partial inner dependence” structure, 
and then we can easily understand a relation among 
elements. 
     In a partial inner dependence AHP, we can divide a 
criteria set

Using this modified criterion weight, we can easily 
calculate the priority of alternatives, i.e., overall weight of 
alternatives with respect to overall objective.  
III. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
When we use AHP in some applications, it often occurs 
that a comparison matrix is not consistent or that there is not 
great difference among the overall weights of the 
alternatives. In these cases, it is very important to 
investigate how components of the pairwise comparison 
matrix influence its consistency or the weights. In this 
study, we use a method that some of the present authors 
have proposed before. It evaluates a fluctuation of the 
consistency index and the weights when the comparison 
matrix is perturbed. It is useful because it does not change 
the structure of the data. 
Since the pairwise comparison matrix is a positive 
square matrix, Perron-Frobenius theorem holds. From 
Perron-Frobenius theorem, the following theorem about a 
perturbed comparison matrix holds. 
Theorem 1 Let A = (aij), (i, j = 1,…, n) denote a comparison 
matrix and let A(ε) = A+εDA, DA=(aijdij) denote a matrix 
that has been perturbed. Let λA be the Frobenius root of A, 
w be the eigenvector corresponding toλA, and v be the 
eigenvector corresponding to the Frobenius root of 
transposed A'. Then, a Frobenius root λ(ε) of A(ε) and a 
corresponding eigenvector w( ε ) can be expressed as 
follows

Then, we can evaluate how the components of a 
comparison matrix impart influence on the weights, to see 
hij

 Proofs of these corollaries are shown in [4]. 
IV.  FUZZY WEIGHTS REPRESENTATIONS 
When a comparison matrix has poor consistency (i.e.,  
0.1<C.I.<0.2), components of the comparison matrix are 
considered to be fuzzy because they are results from human 
fuzzy judgment. Therefore weight should be treated as fuzzy 
numbers [4][6].

crisp weight of criterion k of partial inner dependence 
model, and gij | hij

V.   CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
There are many cases in which data of AHP does not 
have enough consistency or reliability and structure of a 
problem does not contain complete independent criteria. For 
these cases, we propose a fuzzy weight representation and 
compositions for incomplete inner dependence structure 
using results of sensitivity analyses and fuzzy set.  Our 
approach can not only show how to represent weight of 
criteria and alternatives, but also makes it possible to 
investigate how the result of AHP has fuzziness even if data 
are not enough consistent or reliable. 
In the next step, we will compare the partial inner 
dependence AHP and the normal AHP with real data.
