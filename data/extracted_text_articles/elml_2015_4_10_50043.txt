Abstract—This paper is part of our ongoing research on the 
ways interaction affects student immersion within a virtual 
world and, consequently, student engagement with the 
educational activities that take place within it when a hybrid 
learning method is used. We confirm and further enhance our 
hypothesis investigating student feelings and thoughts about 
the interaction taking place within a virtual world when that is 
used in higher education. Specifically, 111 university students, 
both at undergraduate and postgraduate level, who used our 
“in-house” OpenSim virtual world for roughly 8 weeks, were 
asked to indicate their opinion and feelings about the virtual 
world and the various kinds of interaction they had. The 
results of this study validated our initial hypothesis that 
interaction plays a crucial role in student engagement, 
underlying that the nature and the design of the educational 
activities substantially affects student engagement.

INTRODUCTION 
One of the most overwhelming achievements of the 
technological evolution in the past decades (early ’80s) lies 
in the field of virtual reality [1]. Virtual worlds were initially 
introduced as computer-aided 3D artificial environments, 
remotely or locally accessible to individual people and 
capable of simultaneously hosting their actions and 
interactions [2]. Even though their initial purpose was to 
provide an alternative for leisure (computer games) [1], 
within the last decade virtual worlds have massively 
progressed and serve various purposes such as socialisation, 
recreation, exploration, collaboration and education [3] [4]. 
This is attributed to the unique features of virtual worlds, like 
Second Life (http://secondlife.com/) or OpenSimulator 
(http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page), as they allow 
users to modify, design, and control the virtual environment 
[5]. 
Several studies have been conducted with the focus being 
on the use of virtual worlds in education [2] [4] [6] [7]. 
Researchers and educators [5] [8] agree that the 3D element, 
the use of avatars (users’ virtual representations), the 
manipulation and development of environmental content, the 
embodied / real time communication (verbal/non-verbal) and 
the interaction, are some of the core features which turn 
virtual worlds into appropriate for learning activities. In [9], 
the author claims that the next generation of learners will be 
“learning in technology” whilst, other researchers [4] [10] 
agree with this statement and also add that virtual worlds 
allow learners to “learn by experiencing” the subject. The 
aforementioned claims are based on Vygotsky’s [11] 
constructivist theory according to which learners construct 
their knowledge in virtual worlds by experiencing it as active 
participants [7]. 
A wide range of traditional learning styles has been 
identified and employed within virtual worlds under different 
learning approaches [12] [13] [14] [15]. This is attributed, to 
some extent, to the wide and complex network of interaction 
which can be developed within virtual worlds [6]. Even 
though the importance of interaction upon learning activities 
has attracted the interest of researchers and educators, as 
shown from the related literature [16] [17] [18], very few 
attempts have been made to develop and introduce 
frameworks and taxonomies for the evaluation of the 
educational activities [13] [19]. 
In an attempt to fill this gap, de Freitas et al. [16] and 
Childs [17] presented and assessed their framework for the 
evaluation of the learning affordances of virtual worlds. 
After assessing their own framework, they concluded that 
even though studying virtual worlds as a distance learning 
tool can be a sound method to extract some results, there is 
still need for further investigation with regard to the use of 
virtual worlds in hybrid-learning approaches (students’ 
virtual and physical simultaneous co-presence) [18]. 
Likewise, Bronack, Rield and Tashner [13] developed their 
social constructivist framework and evaluated it using 
distance 
education 
environments 
with 
some 
quite 
encouraging conclusions. 
Virtual worlds are, indeed, a great example of a tool to 
support distance education, but several approaches have also 
been made to utilise virtual worlds as a supplementary 
material to traditional learning. Camilleri and de Freitas [15] 
used a hybrid-learning approach to investigate and 
understand the level of engagement of learners with virtual 
worlds. The conclusions drawn from their experiments 
highlighted some of the benefits that student engagement has 
(e.g., 
development 
of 
working 
presence, 
increased 
collaboration and enthusiasm for learning). They also 
suggested that further research should be conducted in order 
to better understand how student engagement can be 
achieved and measured, as this is a key-factor to design 
successful educational activities within virtual worlds. The 
link between engagement and learning is believed to be

interaction, as described by Childs [17] (e.g., interacting with 
the world, interacting with others, interacting with the avatar, 
finding and searching). 
The above studies constitute a rather small example of 
the existing literature about interaction and engagement 
within virtual worlds. However, most of them are focusing 
either on distance education or, when a hybrid-learning 
approach is used, on the inner side of the virtual world 
disregarding the interaction occurring within the physical 
classroom. Specifically, a very limited –almost nonexistent– 
number of studies exist about the interaction occurring 
within the physical classroom, while a hybrid-learning 
approach is utilised [20] [21], or as a combination of the 
interaction occurring both within the virtual world and the 
physical classroom at the same time. This gap in the existing 
literature has been identified and suggested for empirical 
investigation and evaluation by several researchers [12] [16] 
[19] [20] [21]. 
We believe that interaction related to the use of the 
virtual world when occurring within the physical classroom 
affects student engagement with the virtual world. Therefore, 
we focus our ongoing research to that direction aiming to 
define, understand and map the way interaction (in-world 
and in-class) affects student engagement (positively or 
negatively). 
Our initial attempt to identify and categorise the 
structural elements of learner engagement was made by 
Christopoulos and Conrad [22]. Based on that study, the 
conclusions that immersion and engagement are not inherent 
features of a virtual world were drawn and triggered further 
research that resulted in our previous attempt to investigate 
this subject [23]. That study allowed us to develop a 
taxonomy which mapped and described how interaction can 
be defined and understood in relation to learner engagement. 
In this research, we validate and further enhance our 
taxonomy aiming to generalise our findings on the kinds of 
interaction that affect student engagement. 
 
Figure 1. The four dimensions of interaction. 
For clarification purposes, Figure 1 illustrates the four 
dimensions of interaction and the conjunctions that they may 
form. The term student-to-student interaction includes any 
kind of interactivity between students, either that may take 
place in the virtual world through avatars (e.g., chatting, 
emoticons, gestures, etc.), or in the physical classroom 
between the physically co-located students (e.g. talking, 
commenting, exchanging ideas, sharing thoughts etc.) On the 
other hand, student-to-world interaction seen from the in-
world perspective includes all the possible interactions a user 
can have with the 3D content of a virtual world (e.g. 
building, scripting, using 3D objects, exploring etc.), whilst, 
seen from the in-class perspective, includes the use of the 
virtual world’s technology per se. All kinds of the 
investigated interaction are analysed under this point of view 
in this paper. 
The paper is structured as follows. First we provide a 
general overview of virtual worlds and the theoretical 
framework from which our main hypothesis is derived. We 
contextualise it within existing work with regard to higher 
education in virtual worlds, interaction and its effects on 
student engagement. In Section II, we briefly describe the 
situation in which the study has been conducted, and the 
research method followed to investigate this subject. In 
Section III, the reader can find the analysis of the findings in 
detail, while Section IV highlights and summarises the most 
important dimensions of interaction and its impact on student 
engagement. Finally, Section V concludes the paper. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Description of the Context of the Survey 
The examined practical sessions took place from 
February until June 2014 with a cohort of undergraduate and 
a cohort of postgraduate students, both of which were using a 
virtual world in the context of similar units. The 
institutionally hosted OpenSim virtual world of the 
University of Bedfordshire was used as an innovative tool 
for students to deal with, in the concept of working and 
collaborating in groups with task division, similar to 
circumstances taking place in companies. Each group had to 
choose an emerging technology subject, run a research about 
it, create a virtual show case for its promotion, and document 
all the aspects of their work. During these practical sessions 
students were simultaneously co-present in the physical 
classroom and in the virtual world. The questionnaires were 
distributed to the students after the completion of the course.  
B. Survey 
The use of surveys as a research method in studies 
related to education has several advantages. Surveys are 
considered to be one of the most sufficient methods to gather 
opinions of a large-scale sample. They are used to reveal 
participants’ feelings, thoughts and beliefs about the subject 
under investigation, and also to justify their actions and 
behaviors. Furthermore, they allow researchers to draw 
accurate conclusions and make generalisations through the 
statistical analysis of the collected data. Finally, they are 
thought to be participant friendly, since participants are used 
to answering surveys with multiple-choice answers based on 
the Likert scale methodology [24]. 
C. Structure and Sample 
The survey consisted of thirty (30) statements on a five-
point Likert scale (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) and 
was divided in two parts: the first part (14 statements) 
56

examined students’ interaction with the content of the virtual 
world in the context of the practical sessions, and the second 
part (16 statements) examined students’ interaction with 
other users of the virtual world in the context of the practical 
sessions. 
Among the students who participated, forty-seven (47) 
were undergraduates and sixty-four (64) postgraduates. More 
than 4/5 of the participants were male (91), while less than 
1/5 were female (20). More than half of the participants 
(59.45%) were aged 18-25 years old, several were 26-35 
years old (38.75%), only two were 36-45 years old, and none 
was older than the age of 45. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Student-to-world interaction had slightly more positive 
results than student-to-student interaction, and at the same 
time statements regarding student-to-student interaction 
gathered more neutral and negative responses than those 
regarding student-to-world interaction. 
The majority of the participants agreed to all the 
statements provided, while in all cases the total of positive 
responses (“Strongly Agree” and “Agree”) was higher than 
the total of negative responses (“Strongly Disagree” and 
“Disagree”). Moreover, participants responded neutrally 
(“Neither Agree nor Disagree”) very frequently. However, 
the number of statements that gathered considerably more 
negative responses was not negligent either. It is worth 
mentioning that in several statements the sum of negative 
responses is higher than the amount of neutral responses (see 
Tables I and II).

What follows is the analysis of the answers to the 
statements, some of which are examined in pairs so that a 
direct comparison is possible. In each pair, the first statement 
is about Interacting with the content of the virtual world in 
the context of the practical sessions, while the second one 
deals with Interacting with other users of the virtual world in 
the context of the practical sessions. 
Statements 1 and 15 (…is a good reason for me to use a 
virtual world). The findings clearly demonstrate that 
participants used the virtual world for both kinds of 
interaction it offers. However, when thoroughly comparing 
the positive with the negative responses, we can see an 
indication that they would opt to use a virtual world slightly 
more for the interaction occurring with the world itself and 
less for the interaction occurring with others. 
Statements 2 and 16 (…made me feel I am actually present in 
the virtual world). Because of the sporadic nature of these 
responses, no conclusion that students were truly immersed 
can be safely drawn. In fact, the number of the neutral as 
well as the negative responses was considerably high, too. 
However, the sum of the responses with positive values 
provides an indication that interaction can actually have a 
strong impact and important outcomes on students’ 
engagement and immersion. Nevertheless, the nature and the 
design of the activities play an important role and, therefore, 
clear and careful design for the enhancement of both kinds of 
interaction ought to be set as a priority. 
Statements 3 and 17 (…made me “experience” the 
knowledge). As shown by these findings, both kinds of 
57

interaction may have a significant impact on the experience 
of the learning material. However, the fact that the number of 
neutral and negative responses was not low raises concerns 
about the cases and the conditions when a virtual world can 
truly help students “live” the lesson and learn by doing and 
interacting. 
Statements 4 and 18 (…was real-time and that helped me 
have real-time awareness and feedback of the results of my 
work). Even though responses demonstrated as more 
important for the students the advantages such as the real-
time awareness of their work had, it became apparent that a 
significant number of students used the virtual world as a 
medium to host their meetings, provide feedback to other 
team members and fellow-students, and also discuss matters 
that were non-related to their project. 
Statements 5 and 19 (…made the learning material more 
attractive for me). It seems that both student-to-student and 
student-to-world interaction can have a very positive impact 
on the attractiveness of the learning material accessed in the 
virtual world. Indeed, students used to enjoy working with 
their teammates in-world and to collaborate trying to perform 
their tasks. 
Statements 6 and 20 (…made me participate gladly in the 
practical sessions). Indeed, for most of the participants the 
opportunities given to them to interact with this tool 
increased their willingness to participate and engage gladly 
with their assignment. However, taking into consideration 
the server’s data logs, it became apparent that the number of 
students who were using the virtual world initially was 
decreasing significantly over time. This explains, to some 
extent, the high percentages of the neutral and negative 
responses. 
Statement 7 (...was interesting since I had the opportunity to 
see my creations ‘alive’). These results clearly demonstrate 
that the interactive 3D content of a virtual world and, even 
more so, the students’ opportunities to create and alter it 
according to their needs and preferences can be an 
interesting part of the use of a virtual world. Besides, coding 
in a virtual world differs dramatically from coding on a 
compiler and that is the element that makes a virtual world 
interesting to use. 
Statements 8 and 25 (...was fun).The use of a virtual world to 
assist the learning process, to give students the feeling of 
actually participating in it, and, by extension, to make it 
more amusing and entertaining is something which was 
acknowledged by most of the participants. Indeed, not all the 
students learn the same way and this is where special 
attention should be given. 
Statements 9 and 26 (…made the practical session more 
attractive for me). These findings clearly demonstrate that 
the use of the virtual world had a very positive impact on the 
attractiveness of the practical session. It is really interesting 
that the unique element of student interaction with the 3D 
content of the world that cannot be replaced by other features 
of the physical classroom contributed more, compared to 
student 
interaction 
with 
their 
classmates, 
on 
the 
attractiveness of the procedures that take place during the 
sessions. It is supposed that the innovative nature of this tool 
was the main reason why students were attracted to it and the 
practical sessions, by extension. 
Statements 10 and 27 (…made learning easier for me 
compared to just studying). A quite large portion of students 
agreed that this tool had a positive impact on their 
engagement and that they learned a lot of things along the 
way. Indeed, several educators and researchers have focused 
on the advantages of the so-called learning by doing. 
However, for a significant number of students it had no 
impact, and in several cases the results were not positive at 
all. 
Statement 11 (… pleased me a lot, especially when I was 
building and scripting). These results, though encouraging, 
raise serious concerns about the use of virtual worlds in 
educational context. Despite the fact that most of the students 
considered building and scripting as a pleasant part of their 
student-to-world interaction, a noticeable number of others 
probably considered it as just one more educational activity 
with nothing special to offer, or others even disliked it 
maybe because of the difficulties they faced when using this 
new tool. 
Statement 12 (…pleased me a lot, especially when I was 
exploring and sightseeing). Once again the sample showed 
that the students tended to have neutral feelings towards the 
chance they had to explore the content of the virtual world. 
Nevertheless, most of the students enjoyed that part of the in-
world interaction. While students were exploring the virtual 
world, they also had the chance to see their classmates’ 
creations, use them, and get new ideas. Cross-studying the 
responses derived from this statement with the one from 
statement 11, we can understand that for some students using 
virtual objects existing in the virtual world might be more 
pleasant than creating their own artefacts from scratch. 
Statement 13 (…pleased me a lot, especially when I was 
using the virtual objects I created). According to the 
students’ answers, using their own artefacts can be a pleasant 
activity. However, when cross-studying the responses in this 
statement with those in statement 11, a question is posed: 
Why students enjoyed using their own virtual artefacts but 
did not enjoy creating them? The speculation that students 
were struggling with the technology and, thus, building was 
a painful and time-consuming procedure can be made. 
Statement 14 (…pleased me a lot, especially when I was 
using others’ virtual objects). Since it was a group project 
and in order to show that they were actually a part of that 
group, students had, by default, to at least use their 
classmates’ objects in order to work on and complete their 
assignment. However, using them does not necessarily 
means that it can offer any kind of pleasure. That can 
explain, to some extent, the high amount of neutral or even 
negative responses the participants gave. On the other hand, 
there were many students who found the whole process 
pleasant, as it allowed them to get ideas that could have 
helped them to develop or further enhance their own 
artefacts. 
Statement 21 (…made me more open and positive to 
collaborations). It seems that collaboration is enhanced 
through the use of the virtual world. Given that students had 
to complete a collaborative project working in groups with 
58

task division, the fact that most of them felt inspired to work 
harmonically with their teammates is really encouraging. 
However, the high counts of neutral and negative responses 
raise concerns regarding the ways collaboration can be aided 
through the use of a virtual world as a learning tool. 
Statement 22 (…made me learn what other users already 
knew). Participants’ replies to this and the following 
statement form a very clear view of peer-tutoring in virtual 
worlds. When students are interacting in a virtual world, they 
learn what their fellow-students already know, usually 
subconsciously and without being directly taught, while 
sharing their experiences and working together for a 
common goal. 
Statement 23 (…made me teach other users things I knew). 
Most of the students were keen to provide support to others, 
initially related to the use of the virtual world regarding its 
tools and capabilities, and then more focused on their 
assignment. Considering statement 22 along with this 
statement, it can be postulated that the use of the virtual 
world had a positive effect on peer-tutoring and social 
learning. 
Statement 24 (…was interesting since I had the opportunity 
to chat with others about our projects). An interesting form 
of interaction for most of the participants was talking about, 
commenting on, and exchanging ideas about their projects. It 
seems that the use of a virtual world encourages the use of 
this form of communication. Nevertheless, this kind of 
interaction had not been as interesting as for the rest of them. 
The fact that several students thought of it as not particularly 
interesting or not interesting at all can be attributed to the 
fact that they conceived it as nothing more than part of their 
project routine.  
Statement 28 (…pleased me a lot, especially when 
collaborating with others for a common goal). Managing or 
working together with others to achieve common goals is 
always a tough process, taking into consideration the diverse 
personalities that people, and, by extension, students have. 
However, the high percentages of positive replies indicate 
that the use of the virtual world seemed to have a positive 
effect on that, helping students to overcome their difficulties 
and making them feel more confident. Nevertheless, there 
were several students who felt uncomfortable in the virtual 
world for several reasons, some of which have already been 
mentioned, and this had a negative impact on their 
collaboration with others. Therefore, it is very important to 
determine the factors that increase student collaboration and 
those who decrease it. 
Statement 29 (…pleased me a lot, especially when we were 
laughing with our mistakes). Most of the students seemed to 
enjoy working in-world even when the results of their work 
had not been the expected ones. Building and scripting can 
be a very interesting form of in-world interaction for 
students, as already noticed through the responses in 
statement 7. On top of that, when students have the chance to 
share the results of their work, even the most uncommon, 
unexpected, and funny ones, with their class and team mates 
in a virtual space where 3D representations are the key 
element, even their mistakes can prove to be pleasant and 
enjoyable. 
Statement 30 (…pleased me a lot, especially when we were 
having breaks from our work). Taking into consideration the 
data logs, it was revealed that several times students spent 
considerable time in-world wandering, chatting, and 
modifying their avatars. However, there were several 
students who kept a neutral position or even a negative one. 
Since this virtual world was introduced in the context of a 
university assignment, many students faced it as a medium to 
complete their assignment and not as a game-like 
environment. In addition, there were several students who 
either did not have spare time to spend in-world or could not 
find anything interesting enough for them to do other than 
complete their assignment. 
IV. REFLECTION OF THE SURVEY DATA 
The data collected through this survey greatly validate 
our taxonomy. Even though student opinion about several 
aspects of the use of a virtual world on education is 
confirmed and enhanced, a number of other aspects is 
altered. This alteration can be attributed not only to students’ 
different personalities, but also to the difference in the 
learning material, the learning approach, the design of the 
learning activity, and the difference in the ways the virtual 
world was used, as well as the purposes it was used for. 
The general outcome, comparing the means of each 
couple of statements and the mean of each single statement, 
is that the impact that student-to-world interaction has on 
student feelings towards the use of a virtual world is slightly 
more positive than that of student-to-student interaction. 
Nevertheless, both kinds of interaction seem to enhance 
student engagement with learning activities, but this needs to 
be further investigated. 
A. In-world interaction both with the world and among 
students 
Both kinds of interaction that students performed in-
world had equally positive results in their engagement with 
the learning material and in the educational activities. As 
students stated, both interacting with the content of the 
virtual world and with their classmates made them have a 
sense of presence in the virtual world mostly because these 
kinds of interaction made them spontaneously engage with 
the activities and focus on their in-world tasks. Besides, in-
world student-to-student interaction and student-to-world 
interaction were rated as equally responsible factors that 
affect students’ willingness to participate in the practical 
sessions. On top of that, all the complex network of 
interactions that students performed in-world allowed them 
to experience the learning material, and as a result their 
learning outcomes were enhanced.  
B. In-world interaction with the content of the world 
Participants named the student-to-world interaction as a 
particularly worthwhile reason to use a virtual world. This 
interaction was described as the main reason for both the 
learning material and the practical sessions to become more 
attractive for students. Students stated that building, 
scripting, exploring, sightseeing and interacting with the 
content of the virtual world using 3D objects were some of

their in-world actions that made the learning process pleasant 
for them. In addition to that, the fact that all student-to-world 
interaction was synchronous, and the fact that students could 
receive immediate feedback from the content of the world 
upon their actions was conducive to students’ real-time 
awareness of the results of their work and actions, in general. 
That feature was characterised by students as particularly 
interesting, since it gave students the feeling of a “living” 
world that responded to their actions. 
C. In-world Interaction with fellow-students 
The use of a virtual world as a tool in the practical 
sessions was deemed as particularly beneficial by the 
participants not only because of the student-to-world 
interaction they had the opportunity to perform, but because 
of the in-world student-to-student interaction, as well. The 
fact that students not only became open and positive to 
collaborations, but also enjoyed their collaborations in the 
virtual world is underlined. These kinds of interaction and 
collaboration encouraged peer-tutoring and peer-assisted 
learning, since participants mentioned that they both taught 
their classmates and were taught by them in the context of 
their in-world collaborations. Moreover, students stated that 
the fact that they had the chance to talk in-world with their 
classmates about their projects made the whole process more 
interesting for them. Students also evaluated as particularly 
helpful the fact that they could have immediate feedback on 
the course of their projects from their fellow-students. Even 
in cases when the results of their work had not been the 
expected ones, students still enjoyed the whole process, since 
their mistakes could be observed as funny reactions on the 
3D representations. Finally, it seemed that having the chance 
to use the virtual world not only for educational reasons but 
also to spend some leisure time, made students enjoy the use 
of the virtual world and engage with it and with the project. 
However, the extent to which activities that are irrelevant to 
the educational project itself are conducive to student 
immersion in the virtual world and, by extension, conducive 
to the engagement within the project, is still to be 
investigated. 
V. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 
At this point we should note the limitations of this study 
and the factors that have potentially influenced the results, 
even though these influences were intended to be kept to a 
minimum. The participants of the survey were students of 
the University of Bedfordshire, which is where all the 
authors of this paper work. Despite the fact that the 
questionnaires were completely anonymous and participants 
were ensured that their participation in the survey would 
have absolutely no consequence on their academic 
progression, some of them were potentially forced by some 
biases to answer in certain ways, which could not have been 
avoided by the authors 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
The findings derived from this study validated our 
taxonomy and confirmed our initial hypothesis that both 
kinds of interaction have the potential to affect student 
engagement. The interaction that occurred between the 
students and the virtual world was shown to be more intense 
compared to the one that occurred among the students. 
However, student-to-student interaction was also affected by 
the one that occurred between the students and the world 
indirectly. Our hypothesis is enhanced compared to our 
previous one since it identified a need for careful planning of 
the educational activities, taking into consideration the wide 
and complex network of interactions that can be developed 
in order to achieve engagement. However, further research is 
deemed necessary in order to shed light on the design 
principles which educators should take into account when 
creating learning activities that involve the use of a virtual 
world with an aim to engage their student with their learning 
material.
