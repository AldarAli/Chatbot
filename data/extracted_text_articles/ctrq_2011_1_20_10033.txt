Abstract— In this paper, an analytic model is proposed for the 
performance evaluation of vehicular safety related services in 
the dedicated short range communications (DSRC) system on 
highways. The generation and service of safety messages in 
each vehicle is modeled by an M/G/1 queue. A semi-Markov 
process (SMP) model is developed to capture contention and 
backoff behavior in IEEE 802.11 broadcast ad hoc networks. 
Furthermore, this SMP interacts with the M/G/1 queue 
through fixed point iteration. Based on the fixed-point solution, 
performance indices including transmission delay and packet 
delivery ratio (PDR) are derived. Hidden terminal problem is 
taken into account for the PDR computation. Analytic-numeric 
results are verified through extensive simulations under 
various network parameters. Compared with the existing 
models, the proposed model is more general and accurate.

 INTRODUCTION 
Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC), as a vital part of 
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) [1], has been 
extensively researched in recent years.  In the vehicular ad 
hoc network (VANET), the transportation safety is one of 
the most crucial features needed to be addressed. Safety 
applications usually demand direct vehicle-to-vehicle ad hoc 
communication due to highly dynamic network topology and 
strict delay requirements.  Such direct safety communication 
will involve a broadcast service because safety information 
can be beneficial to all vehicles around a sender. 
Broadcasting safety messages is one of the fundamental 
services in dedicated short range communications (DSRC) 
[1], which is adopted by IEEE and ASTM.  
 The performance of vehicular safety communication in 
DSRC system has been studied in [2][3][4]. However, the 
evaluations are mainly based on simulations.  Recently, a 
few analytic models based on discrete time Markov chain 
(DTMC) are developed in [5][6][7] to analyze the 
performance of the broadcast service incorporating the 
backoff counter process, hidden terminals and message 
generation interval. Nevertheless, these cited papers conduct 
performance assessments in a discrete time fashion by 
synchronizing system behavior to unit time slot, which will 
lead to some approximations in the results. In addition, 
according to 802.11 DSRC MAC layer protocol, a vehicle 
can directly transmit a packet without undergoing backoff 
process. Such phenomena has been ignored in the previous 
work [5][6][7], which will result in further approximations.  
In this paper, we develop more accurate analytic models 
using a semi-Markov process (SMP) [8][9] interacting with 
an M/G/1 queue for the performance evaluation of the 
broadcast service in DSRC safety communication system. 
Fixed point iteration [10] is applied to derive the converged 
solution in the steady state. New approaches to calculate the 
transmission delay of safety related messages and PDR 
utilizing features of SMP models are also developed in this 
paper. The analytic results are verified by simulations.  
This paper is organized as follows.  Section II briefly 
describes the system behavior in 802.11 MAC layer protocol 
and assumptions in the system to produce a simplified 
model. Section III presents the analytic models and the fixed 
point iteration. Performance indices including mean delay 
and PDR are derived in Section IV. The analytic and 
simulation results are compared in Section V. Conclusions 
are presented in the last section.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
A. Broadcast protocol 
In the 802.11 MAC layer protocol [11], distributed 
coordination function (DCF) is the primary medium access 
control technique for broadcast services.  This section 
briefly explains the basic access mechanism of DCF for 
broadcast. 
Each vehicle in the network can occasionally generate 
safety related packets and compete for the channel resource 
to transmit the packet. For a newly generated packet in a 
vehicle, the vehicle senses the channel activity before it 
starts to transmit the packet. If the channel is sensed idle for 
a time period of distributed inter-frame space (DIFS), the 
packet can be directly transmitted. Otherwise, the vehicle 
continues to monitor the channel until channel is detected to 
be idle for DIFS time period. Subsequently, according to the 
collision avoidance feature of the protocol, the vehicle 
generates an initial random backoff counter and goes 
through the backoff process before transmitting the packet. 
Moreover, a vehicle must go through the backoff process 
between two consecutive packet transmissions even if the 
channel is sensed idle for the duration of DIFS time for the 
second packet. Therefore, a packet can directly transmit 
without undergoing the backoff process only when the 
following two conditions are satisfied:  
• 
The packet is generated when the queue is empty; 
• 
The channel is sensed idle for DIFS time starting 
from the time instant that the packet is generated;

Regarding the backoff process for a packet transmission, 
the initial backoff counter is chosen randomly from a 
uniform density over the range (0, W0-1). The backoff time 
counter is decreased by one if the channel is sensed idle for 
a time slot σ. The counter is frozen when channel is sensed 
busy and reactivated when the channel is sensed idle again 
for more than the DIFS duration. The packet is transmitted 
as soon as the backoff counter reaches zero.  
In broadcast services, the transmitting vehicle does not 
receive any feedback from the receivers and will not 
retransmit a packet. The detailed descriptions for IEEE 
802.11 standard can be found in [11].       
B. System assumptions 
Several assumptions are made in the broadcast system to 
produce a simplified yet a high fidelity model.  
• 
The vehicular ad hoc network is considered to be 
one-dimensional. The number of vehicles in a lane 
is Poisson distributed with parameter β (vehicle 
density), i.e., the probability P(i, l) of finding i 
vehicles in a lane of length of l is given by: 
(
)
(
)
,
!
i
l
l
P i l
e
i
β
β
−

(1) 
• 
All vehicles have the same transmission range as 
well as receiving range R. 
• 
Each vehicle is assumed to generate packets as a 
Poisson stream with rate λ (in packets per second). 
• 
Each vehicle has an infinite queue to store the 
packets at the MAC layer. Hence, each vehicle can 
be modeled as an M/G/1 queue, which has 
exponentially distributed packet inter-arrival time 
(represented by M), an arbitrary distribution for 
service time (represented by G) and one server. 
Due to the contention medium, the overall problem can 
be seen as a set of interacting M/G/1 queues. We simplify 
the problem by developing an SMP model for the tagged 
vehicle that does not directly keep track of the queued 
requests but captures the channel contention and backoff 
behavior. This SMP model interacts with the M/G/1 queue 
hence we need to use fixed-point iteration to solve the 
overall model. 
III. 
ANALYTIC MODELS 
A. SMP model 
The behavior of a tagged vehicle for packet transmission 
can be characterized using the SMP model in Figure 1.    
The tagged vehicle is in idle state if there is no packet in 
its queue. After a packet is generated, the vehicle senses 
channel activity for DIFS time period. If channel is detected 
not busy during this period (with probability 1-qb), the 
vehicle goes from idle state to XMT state, which means that a 
packet is transmitting. Otherwise, the vehicle will randomly 
choose a backoff counter in the range (0, W0-1). The backoff 
counter will be decreased by one if channel is detected to be 
idle for a time slot σ (with probability 1-pb), which is 
captured by the transition from state W0-i to state W0-i-1. If 
the channel is busy during a backoff time slot σ (i.e., another 
vehicle is transmitting a packet), the backoff counter of the 
tagged vehicle will be suspended and deferred for the 
duration of  packet transmission time T, which presents the 
transition from state W0-i to 
0
1
W
i
D
− −  with probability pb. When 
the backoff counter reaches zero, the packet will directly be 
transmitted (an SMP transition occurs from state 0 to state 
XMT with probability one). In XMT state, a packet is 
transmitting. After the packet transmission, if there is no 
packet left in the queue of the tagged vehicle (with 
probability 1-ρ), the vehicle will go from XMT to idle state 
and wait for a new incoming packet. If there are packets left 
in the queue after a packet transmission (with probability ρ), 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the vehicle will sense the channel again for DIFS time and 
then randomly choose a backoff counter before transmitting 
the next packet.

Although the sojourn time in XMT state is T, the real 
packet transmission only occupies a portion of this sojourn 
time, which is E[PA]+TH+δ=T-DIFS. Hence, the probability 
that a vehicle transmits in steady state is πXMT(T-DIFS)/T. 
In Equation (7), three unknown parameters are: 
• 
ρ: the probability that there are packets in the queue 
of the tagged vehicle. 
• 
pb: the probability that the channel is detected busy 
in one time slot by the tagged vehicle. 
• 
qb: the probability that the channel is detected busy 
in DIFS time by the tagged vehicle. 
In Section III.C, we will see that pb and qb are functions 
of ρ, whereas ρ depends on the mean service time to transmit 
a packet. Therefore, the service time is derived first in the 
next subsection. Section III.C subsequently illustrates the 
relationships between these parameters and fixed point 
iteration algorithm is utilized to compute the numerical 
results for these parameters as well as the service time.   
B. Service time computation 
As mentioned above,  each vehicle in the network can be 
modeled as an M/G/1 queue. The MAC layer service time is 
defined as the time interval from the time instant when a 
packet becomes the head of the queue and starts to contend 
for transmission, to the time instant when the packet is 
received.  
The SMP model in Section III.A describes the behavior 
of a tagged vehicle continuously transmitting packets in its 
queue. In this section, the service time for any one packet in 
the queue needs to be derived. Therefore, the SMP model in 
Section III.A can be modified to contain an absorbing state 
as shown in Figure 2. By properly allocating the initial 
probability, the time to reach the absorbing state will be the 
service time for a packet transmission.      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For a newly generated packet in the tagged vehicle, if 
there is no packet in the queue and the channel is sensed idle 
for DIFS time with probability (1-ρ)(1-qb),  the packet will 
be directly transmitted. In other words, the initial probability 
that a packet starts its transmission in  XMT state is (1-ρ)(1-
qb). Otherwise, the vehicle will randomly choose a backoff 
counter before the packet transmission. Therefore, the initial 
probability that a packet starts its transmission in state i 
(i=0,1,…,W0-1) is [1-(1-ρ)(1-qb)]/W0. Hence, the initial 
probabilities for all states are:

Since the Markov chain contains an absorbing state, the

Let Xij be the random variable denoting the visit counts to 
state j before entering the absorbing state, given that 
embedded DTMC started in state i.  The expected number of 
visits to state j starting from state i before absorption is given 
by the (i,j)th element of the fundamental matrix M. Hence,

      Due to the acyclic nature of the DTMC model in Figure

definition of Xij instead of computing (10).

C. Fixed point iteration 
In the previous section, the mean service time is shown to 
depend on three unknown parameters ρ, pb and qb, whereas ρ 
depends on the mean service time according to the M/G/1 
queue behavior. Therefore, relationships between ρ, pb and  
qb are determined first in this section, and then the fixed 
point iteration algorithm is used to obtain the final solution. 
Let Ncs denote the average number of vehicles in carrier 
sensing range of the tagged vehicle, whereas Ntr denote the 
average number of vehicles in transmission range of the 
tagged vehicle. Hence, without loss of generality, we have

From the tagged vehicle’s point of view, pb is the 
probability that it senses channel busy during one time slot in 
the backoff process. Since the channel is detected busy if 
there is at least one neighbor (i.e., a vehicle in the 
transmission range of the tagged vehicle) transmitting in a 
backoff time slot of the tagged vehicle, we have

where PXMT is the probability that a neighbor  is transmitting 
in a backoff time slot of the tagged vehicle, to be derived 
next.  
Equation (7) shows that the probability that a vehicle 
transmits a packet in steady state is πXMT(T-DIFS)/T. In 
addition, the time to transmit a packet is T-DIFS. Therefore, 
we can abstractly define the total time to be Ttotal as shown in 
Figure 3. Hence, πXMT(T-DIFS)/T =(T-DIFS)/ Ttotal.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Suppose a neighbor of the tagged vehicle transmits a packet 
as shown in Figure 3 in time duration Ttotal, a backoff time 
slot of the tagged vehicle can occupy any one time slot 
within Ttotal.  
For the first backoff time slot of the tagged vehicle, the 
time duration that can capture the transmission of the 
neighbor is T-DIFS+2σ. One extra time slot σ is the one just 
before transmission and another is the one just after 
transmission, which can capture the starting time instant and 
ending time instant of the packet transmission. Therefore, the 
probability that a neighbor’s transmission is detected in the 
first backoff time slot of the tagged vehicle is πXMT(T-
DIFS+2σ)/T. 
For a backoff time slot that is not the first backoff time 
slot of the tagged vehicle, the time duration that captures the 
transmission of the neighbor is 2σ, which captures the 
starting time instant of the transmission. This is because 
when the neighbor’s transmission is detected in the first 
backoff time slot by the tagged vehicle, the backoff counter 
will suspend and wait until the end of this transmission for 
further decrement. Therefore, if the first backoff time slot 
detects the transmission, there is no chance for the later 
backoff time slots to detect the same transmission. As a 
result, the non-first backoff time slot can only detect the 
transmission when the starting point of the transmission falls 
within this time slot. Therefore, the probability that a 
neighbor’s transmission is detected in non-first backoff time 
slot of the tagged vehicle is πXMT·2σ/T. 
Since the probability that a backoff time slot is the first 
backoff time slot is 1/W0 and non-first backoff time slot is 
(1-1/W0), the probability that a neighbor’s transmission is 
detected by a backoff time slot of the tagged vehicle is:

Next, qb denotes the probability that channel is detected 
busy by the tagged vehicle in the DIFS duration. Therefore, 
we can similarly define PXMT’ to be the probability that a 
neighbor’s transmission is detected in the DIFS duration by 
the tagged vehicle.

From the above analysis of the relationship between two 
parameters ρ and pb (qb can be expressed in terms of pb), we 
notice that pb depends on ρ and pb itself. Hence, we denote 
pb=g(ρ,pb)  and the reciprocal of mean service time for 
M/G/1 queue to be µ=h(ρ,pb). The fixed point iteration 
algorithm is outlined as follows according to the import 
graph in Figure 4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fixed point iteration algorithm: 
Step 1: Initialize ρ=1, which is the saturation condition; 
Step 2: With ρ, solve pb according to (24)(25)(7)(28); 
Step 3: With ρ and pb, calculate service rate µ=1/E[S] 
according to (20); 
Step 4: If λ<µ, ρ=λ/µ; otherwise, ρ=1; 
Step 5: If ρ converges to the previous value, then stop the 
iteration algorithm; otherwise, go to step 2 with the 
updated ρ. 
By utilizing the fixed point iteration algorithm, the 
parameters ρ, pb, qb, πXMT as well as the mean and the 
variance of the service time can be determined, which are 
used for performance indices computation in the next 
section.

PERFORMANCE INDICES 
A. Transmission delay 
The packet transmission delay is defined as the average 
delay a packet experiences from the time the packet is 
generated, until the time the packet is successfully received 
by all neighbors of the vehicle that generates the packet. The 
transmission delay E[D] includes the queuing delay and 
medium service time (due to backoff, packet transmission, 
and propagation delay, etc.)  
The expected queuing delay can be obtained from the 
Pollaczek-Khinchin mean value formula of M/G/1 queue:

B. Packet Delivery Ratio 
The PDR is defined as: given a broadcast packet sent by 
the tagged vehicle, the probability that all vehicles in its 
transmission range receive the packet successfully. Taking 
account of hidden terminals, we have 
(

)
cs
ph
PDR

(31) 
where P(Ncs) is the probability that no vehicles in the 
transmission range of the tagged vehicle transmits when the 
tagged vehicle starts transmission, and P(Nph) is the 
probability that no transmissions from the vehicles in the 
potential hidden terminal area collide with the broadcast 
packet from the tagged vehicle.  
  P(Ncs) can also be interpreted as the no-concurrent 
transmission probability, i.e., two packets do not start 
transmission at the same time. Since DCF employs a 
discrete-time backoff scheme, if the backoff process is 
involved, a vehicle is only allowed to transmit at the 
beginning of each slot time after an idle DIFS. Therefore, if 
the tagged vehicle has not gone through the backoff process 
before transmitting the packet (with probability (1-ρ)(1-qb)), 
the concurrent transmission will not occur. Otherwise, the 
packet transmission is synchronized to the beginning of a 
slot time, and concurrent transmission may occur if other 
vehicles’ transmission is also synchronized by the backoff 
process. From the model, we know that the probability that 
a neighbor starts to transmit a packet at the beginning of the 
same time slot with the tagged vehicle is π0= πXMT·σ/T. This 
is because the sojourn time in state 0 is one time slot σ as 
shown in the SMP model, hence, π0 is the probability that a 
vehicle starts to transmit in the beginning of a time slot 
immediately after the backoff process. Hence, P(Ncs) is:

Since the transmission time for a packet is T-
DIFS=E[PA]+TH+δ, the event that transmission from hidden 
terminals collides with the tagged vehicle’s transmission 
only happens when hidden terminals start to transmit during 
the vulnerable period 2(T-DIFS)=2(E[PA]+TH+δ) [6]. Using 
πXMT=T/Ttotal as an abstraction of the steady state behavior 
shown in Figure 3, the probability that a vehicle starts to 
transmit during the vulnerable period is:

network settings in [1]. Figures 5 and 6 present the mean 
transmission delay and PDR, respectively, vs. the vehicle 
density β (# vehicles per meter), data rate Rd (Mbps), packet

Figures 5 and 6 show that the analytic results from the 
model have better match with the simulation results than 
those from the model in [6]. The 95% confidence intervals 
are shown in the figures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the SMP model considers the fact that a packet can 
be directly transmitted without undergoing backoff process, 
the delay is lower compared with [6]. Another observation in 
Figure 5 is that high data rate and shorter packet length 
facilitate the decrease of the transmission delay. 
The PDR decreases fast as the density β increases as 
shown in Figure 6. Similar to the delay, PDR also benefits 
from high data rate and short packet length.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a more general and accurate analytic model 
using SMP has been developed to characterize the behavior 
of DSRC for highway safety communications. The model is 
cross validated against simulations.  Moreover, the 
performance with different input parameters is analyzed to 
suggest better parameter settings that will improve the 
performance by decreasing the delay and increasing PDR. In 
future, performance optimization will be conducted for more 
parameters including W0. The tradeoff between delay and 
PDR will be evaluated based on optimization results. In 
addition, the SMP model will be extended to incorporate 
different packet arrival processes such as Markov modulated 
Poisson process (MMPP), Markov arrival process (MAP) 
instead of Poisson arrival. Besides one-hop direct broadcast 
transmission 
strategy, 
multi-hop 
and 
multi-cycle 
transmission strategy will also be considered in future.
