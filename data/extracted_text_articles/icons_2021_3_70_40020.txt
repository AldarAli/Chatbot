Abstract— This paper seeks to understand the Zero Emission
solution that the Norwegian Railways Directorate adopted in
its 2019 report. The report presented the battery with partial
electrification
as
an
ideal
solution
for
achieving
the
government's goals of reaching Zero Emission. Using the
battery as a replacement for diesel engines is a new technology
in Norway. The newly proposed technology for use in the
railway sector is a new challenge and raises many questions
about its suitability to operate on the Norwegian railway. In
this paper, we applied the concept of Systems Thinking
methodology. We applied this methodology to get deeper
understanding
of
the
system
and
its
boundaries.
Understanding the issues could be of influence now or in the
future, as well as identifying and defining the stakeholders and
understanding their needs. The tools we used in this paper are:
applying Cynefin framework to sort the set of issues that
managers face in five contexts, applying Openness (context
diagram)
to
manage
the
chaos
and
complexity
by
understanding
the
context
of
its
environment,
applying
CATOWE analysis to understand the stakeholder perspective
and the impact of the issues, applying WHY question to
understand why
the
actors do what
they
do, applying
Systemigram to understand and model the system of interest
and also to visualize the representation of the system structure,
& applying Leverage points to identify places in the system
that a small force change can cause a large effect in system
behavior.

I. INTRUDUCTION
A.
Understanding the new technology
This paper discusses many factors that have impact on
systems
and
their
environment
by
applying
System
Thinking. This will help us to increase the understanding of
the
internal
and
external
requirements
of
the
new
technology. The early understanding of the demands of the
desired system are also mentioned in the system engineering
handbook [4] and defined as a factor for developing and
improving the systems.
Using the battery train as a new solution in the Norway
Railway System will increase the uncertainty and make the
boundary unambiguous. In this project, it would be difficult
to predict the issues caused by interaction of the human –
machine and the environment. We need to understand the
system type to predict the possible issues that can face our
system. This new technology requires more analyzing and
studies to improve their performance and to ensure the
operational safety in the Norwegian Railway Sector.
The Cynefin framework identified five contexts, as
introduced by Snowden and Boone [2]. The framework
offers the decision makers five contexts to demonstrate the
differentiation among them by showing the nature of the
relationship between cause and effect, as shown in Figure 1.
The Cynefin framework will help the management of an
organization to select the right context and involve the right
stakeholders to make a proper decision.
Figure 1. Domains of the Cynefin framework; the dark domain in the center
is disorder.
Figure 1 shows the five-decision making contexts,
namely:
obvious,
complicated,
complex,
chaotic,
and
disorder (the actual context is not known), in order to aid or
help the managers to make sense of a situation. Cause and
effect on the new battery train system have no answers and
cannot
be
deduced,
unless
in
retrospect.
"Instructive
patterns ... can emerge," write Snowden and Boone, "if the
leader conducts experiments that are safe to fail." Cynefin
calls this process "probe–sense–respond" [2].

B.
Battery Train - with partial electrification
This new technology is still under study and testing
process in Norway. The National Directorate for Norway,
using this solution, aims to reduce the CO2 (Carbon dioxide)
emission to the community and provide clean energy for the
environment. “This concept is compatible with today’s
technology and can therefore be used on the entire existing
rail network,” says the Railway Directorate.
Figure 2. Bombardier train
The train will become more stable, less noisy, will have
less vibration and zero emissions after replacing the diesel
engines with a battery-powered engine. This solution
optimizes the energy efficiency and provides maximum
safety. The batteries will be installed on the roofs of the
locomotives. The batteries will supply the motors and the
mount with the power necessary to control all moving parts.
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate a bombardier train which can
travel at a maximum of 160 km/h for more than 7 hours
without the need for additional impetus, such as diesel
engines or electric power.
Figure 3. Recharging the battery for Bombardier train
The batteries can be recharged within 7-10 minutes and
this is done by connecting the wattage to the batteries as
they travel along the lines that have electrical power. Each
battery has 5-8 years lifetime with daily operation.
II. BACKGROUND
The Norwegian Government Transport Committee has
requested
the
Railway
Directorate
to
investigate
the
possibility of a test project with Zero Emissions Solutions
for railway vehicles. The Norwegian National Railways
Directorate Performed a study in 2019. The study was
performed in partnership with Bane NOR SF (infrastructure
manager) and Norske Tog AS (a train company) and Trains
manufacturers [9]. The study was called The Null Emissions
Solutions for Non-Electrified Railways (NULLFIB) [9].
The study suggested many alternatives to replace the
fossil fuel with zero emission solutions for non-electrified
stretches, considering best financial alternatives.
The options that have been selected were:
•
Hydrogen
•
Biogas
•
Biodiesel
•
Battery
•
Battery operation with partial electrification
The study selected the battery with partial electrification
as the most durable and robust alternative to replace the
diesel engines because it would be expensive and require
more international coordination to refill the other forms of
fuel (hydrogen, biogas or biodiesel) in case of crossing
borders. This solution will increase the socio-economic
savings according to the National Railway Directorate “A
transition
to
zero-emission
solutions
will
reduce
the
railway’s carbon footprint, and will provide favorable
socio-economic savings”.
III. PAPER METHOD AND SOLUTION CHALLENGE
The paper is based on outcomes from the National
Directorate and Bane NOR infrastructure, and we applied
qualitative research methods using reports and article
outcomes observations and informal communication with
suppliers.
This
paper
applies
the
System
Thinking
methodology to provide the understanding of the solution.
The National Directorate collaborated with Norske Tog
AS to provide battery-powered engines to their vehicles by
using Bane NOR infrastructure to ensure the Zero Emission.
All three actors (National Directorate, Norske AS & Bane
NOR) have focused on the new technology, which is still
unclear and unambiguous. The battery solution is new to the
market and unknown for a lot of railway companies. The
Norwegian government requires adopting the new solution
with a high level of focus on Zero Emission to provide an
operational
and
cost-effective
rolling
stock
to
the
Norwegian community.
IV. APPLYING THE GENERAL SYSTEM THINKING (GST)
One of the challenging aspects is knowing the boundary
of the systems and their environment. The formalization of
systems
thinking
goes
to
Ludwig
Von
Bertalanffys
formulation of the General System Theory in 1940, which
states “… an important means of controlling and instigating
the transfer of principles from one field to another, and it
will no longer be necessary to duplicate or triplicate the
discovery of the same principle in different fields isolated
from each other” [7]. In his book, the author mentions that
the characteristics of the complex will manifest as new or
emergent. Further, he explains the system complexity by
interfaces. The elements are interacting and they are open to
interact with their environments. We can introduce the
environments as variables or circumstances surrounding the
system of interest and the interaction between the two is
done through interfaces. Therefore, the system context and
interaction with their environments is the major principle to
provide an understanding of the Openness of the system.
A. Openness of Battery Train
Stephen G. Haines stated “All systems have boundaries
which separate them from their environments. The concept
of boundaries helps us understand the distinction between
open and closed systems. The relatively closed system has
rigid, impenetrable boundaries; whereas the open system
has permeable boundaries between itself and the broader
environment.” [10]. The battery train as a system has
elements that interact with each other and with their
environments, therefore, we can consider the system as an
Open System.

J. Gharajeddaghi stated “the controllable variables, the
uncontrollable
variables
we
can
influence
and
the
uncontrollable variables we cannot influence but will have
to appreciate.” [5]. The battery train has controllable
variables
that
come
to
have
influence
within
their
environment
and
uncontrollable
variables
that
have
appreciating variables.
Figure 4 shows a context diagram of the battery-powered
train and we can see the Openness of the battery-powered
train. Figure 4 also shows the system boundary and the
interaction
between
controllable
and
uncontrollable
variables, on one side, and the system of interest, on the
other side.
Figure 4. Openness Shows system boundary.
Openness consists of:
a)
Control - refers to the system of interest
Battery-powered train
b)
Influence
-
refers
to
the
controllable
variables that have influence within the system of interest
environment
Operators can include railway companies such as VY or
Cargo
Net,
The
Norwegian
Railway
Authority,
the
Norwegian National Railways Directorate, staff working on
the
project,
including
managers
and
employees.
The
solution owner is the Government. Politicians that propose
or create laws have power over the governmental strategies.
Bane NOR SF Management wants to ensure good and safe
solution for operators. Norske Tog AS wants to ensure good
service to citizens.
c)
Appreciate – Refers to the uncontrollable
variables
The global coronavirus pandemic has a huge effect on
CO2 emissions.
This
abnormal
situation
caused
CO2
emissions cuts, maybe the largest fall we have seen. The
global warming is another factor that is an uncontrollable
variable. European railways companies can increase the
emergence occurring. European railways standards and
regulations have an effect on the Norwegian battery –
powered train according to the operational conditions.
Media Agencies will share the information of the new
technology
with
the
citizens
to
decrease
the
worry
surrounding
the
new
technology.
They
can
provide
feedback from the potential users to the working staff or to
the competent authorities.
B. CATWOE and Variable behavior
We identified two groups of controlled and uncontrolled
variables that affect the system. The uncontrolled variables
are predictable and the system should be prepared for such
an environment. The controlled variables are influenced by
the system and have a significant effect on decision making.
We will analyze the controlled variables behavior because
the organizations can change the controlled variables, but
cannot change the uncontrolled variables.
Figure 5 shows the CATWOE analysis from Bane NOR
SF’ viewpoint to ensure a better understanding of the system
of interest.

C. Influencing the actors
The actors have a significant effect on the system and we
need to understand why they do what they do. This effect
can
have
an
effective
role
in
system
transactional
environment. Understanding the actors needs and their
influence
on
the
process
makes
the
system
more
understandable
and
gives
the
decisions
maker
more
confidence over their decisions. Those actors have influence
on the systems output.
J. Gharajeddaghi stated “Thereafter, to be an effective
player, one has to move yet higher, to the level of
understanding, and learn why they do what they do. The
why question is the matter of purpose, that of choice” [5].
We can gain knowledge by asking the why question. Figure
6 shows the actors and why they do what they do.
In the past years, the Norwegian railway sector and
politicians with government support showed increased
interest in environmental purity and reducing the sources of
energy that are harmful to the environment. This supports

the global organization trends such as the global warming
and European Railway Management. The reduction of CO2
will support global organization orientation and this project
could have funding as an advantage.
The operators of the battery train are motivated by
politicians and railway managers to replace the current
trains with diesel engines by battery trains to ensure
reducing the CO2 and to participate in the railway activities
to provide Zero Emission. Bane NOR SF is an agency that
manages the railway infrastructure and has the responsibility
for the safety of worker and the passengers. Norske Tog AS
collaborated with Bane NOR SF while working on the first
battery with partial electrification train as a pilot project
within the Norwegian Railway infrastructure sector. The
National Railway Directorate leads and supervises the
project to ensure the performed work is within Norwegian
laws
and
regulations.
They
will
ensure
a
good
communication
with
the
regulation
authority.
The
Norwegian Railway Authority will also provide guidance to
ensure that the project is within Norwegian and international
laws and to ensure sustainable and safe operation.

Figure 6. The actors and Why question.
The project manager will gain knowledge on the new
system and how to deal with different situations the working
staff could face. They ensure the staff has the necessary
tools and the necessary documents to perform their work.
The working staff also would gain work experience and
probably better salary.
The Directorate study reports will probably take the
uncontrolled variables into consideration and try to make
them more predictable in order to position the battery train
as a new solution to the market with high level of CO2
reduction until getting the Zero Emission.
D. Systemigram
Sytemigram is derived from “Systemic Diagram” and
provides a tool to help managers, working staff and project
stakeholder to have a better understanding of the system
concepts, processes, and events. This tool, through the
diagram, allows the system to tell a story and catch shallow
leverage points (Material & Processes) & deeper leverage
points (Design & Intent).
The systemigram shows the interfaces, improves the
communication and makes the stakeholders part of the
decision-making. The systemigram was developed by John
Boardman as a part of his approach to develop and provide
the systems thinker with a conceptual modelling tool aligned
with the soft systems method [8].
“Integration is the word we use to introduce the subject
matter of this chapter, which is systemic diagrams (referred
to as systemigrams): what they are, how they are created,
who would want to use them and why, and where they are
headed as a decision-support tool, in our opinion” [6].
Integration is the word that can be used to describe the
Systemigram. Through the systemic diagram, we can define
the system and how it interacts with the environment, define
the different stakeholders and why they have interest, and
express how they could be used to enable the system to
achieve its goal effectively.
The systemigram in Figure 7 shows, from the top-left, the
system of interest (battery train) and runs towards the
purpose of the system, which is located down-right (Zero
Emission). The battery train should be resilient in order to
achieve its purpose by performing the system adaptability.
The elements of the system are classified into 5 groups
with different colors. The selected groups are: Agencies
(orange color), Physical Train (black color), Emission
(green color), Infrastructure (gray color), and Financial
influence (yellow color).
E. Leverage Points
The leverage point for any system has a significant effect
over the entire system, where any small changes or
modification can cause a large effect, as seen in Figure 7.
The Norwegian Railway Directorate has selected the
battery train with partial electrification as a proper solution
to the Norwegian Railway Sector. This will help the global
effort
to
support
zero
emission.
That
means,
the
Government should provide the funding to the project.
Adapting this solution means we should adapt laws,
regulations, legislation, and commercial structure.
Applying the new battery on trains will make the
transportation more cost effective and the load of the work
for railway sector could be increased and cause new
challenges to our system. D. H. Meadows stated “Missing
information flows is one of the most common causes of
system malfunction. Adding or restoring information can be
a powerful intervention, usually much easier and cheaper
than rebuilding physical infrastructure” [3].

Figure 7. Systemigram for battery train
In Figure 7, we can see from the Systemigram how
important
the
communications
and
feedback
among
Directorate Authorities and the train manufacturers is, in
case modifications to satisfy the European and Norwegian
railways are required. Therefore, the system should have a
new method of communication and feedback for better
response, such as putting the information on a website and
giving access to the users, depending on their positions in
the organization.
Additionally, Bane NOR SF must change the stretches to
build new electrified stretches to enable recharging the new
battery train. This will make the railway sector ready to
receive more battery-operated trains that cover the entire
Norway stretches. However, this will also cause an increase
in the cost to Bane NOR, due to the need to build a new
stretch.
One of the new impacts that could affect the new project
is the Coronavirus global pandemic. The world has become
increasingly isolated and the advice from experts goes
against
being in
groups,
which could further spread
infection. Among the measures taken is to reduce the use of
public vehicles, including locomotives. This approach may
have a negative impact in terms of financing the project and
in terms of continuing to implement it.
Another leverage point is how the new battery train
influences human factors. The new technology will require a
new type of working staff with a high education level. In
addition, it requires a new type of data and IT systems to
deal with it.
V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
We need to rethink the design of the Norwegian Railway
infrastructure and understand the impacts of the new
technology on the cities. Rebuilding or building new lines to
fit the new system will require resource, money, and time to
perform the works.
The battery train is considered a railway solution for Zero
Emission, but not as the only one. This solution will
increase the awareness in the community and have a
positive impact on the global environment in terms of global
warming, noise, and clean air. However, at the same time,
increasing fears of lack of clarity of the new technology
system and the need to improve the quality of train service
exist.
This paper has presented the new battery train technology
of with partial electrification by using the Systems Thinking
Methodology Framework. The purpose was to understand
the complexity of the system, locate the system boundaries,
identify and define the uncontrollable and controllable
variables within the system environment, allocate the
stakeholders and their roles, and visualizing the system
through applying the Systemigram.
The paper used Openness to categories the system
variables. Some of the variables can be controlled by actors
68

categorized under Influence such as operators. Another
group no one has control over are variables which are
unpredictable, categorized under Appreciated, such as the
global Coronavirus pandemic.
The paper used the WHY question technique to find out
why different actors do what they do. This method helps the
project
managers
to
understand
the
expectation
of
stakeholders for this new system. In addition, CATOWE
analysis is performed from the stakeholder viewpoint.
Using the Systemigram allowed us to see the system from
a different and bigger point of view. This tool demonstrates
the complex systems in a simple way and helps visualize the
elements and their influence in the system. This tool makes
the communication among different stakeholder easier and
effective.
Further, we want to recommend Systems Thinking
methodology to be used. It can be used in any field of
Engineering research or analysis and many different areas of
specialization. This methodology makes the system better
understood by identifying its strengths and weaknesses and
how the system elements are connected internally and
externally. Also, it facilitates the process for developing and
improving the system's outputs.
