Abstract—This paper presents experimental results of 
cluster analysis using self-organising neural networks for 
identifying failing banks.  The paper first describes major 
reasons and likelihoods of bank failures. Then it 
demonstrates an application of a self-organising neural 
network and presents results of the study.  Findings of the 
paper demonstrate that a self-organising neural network is 
a powerful tool for identifying potentially failing banks.  
Finally, the paper discusses some of the limitations of cluster 
analysis related to understanding of the exact meaning of

I. INTRODUCTION 
In 2008, a series of bank failures triggered a financial 
crisis.  By any historical standard, this crisis was the 
worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  The 
immediate cause of the crisis was the bursting of the 
United States housing bubble.  This, in turn, caused the 
values of securities tied to real estate pricing to nose-dive, 
damaging financial institutions worldwide.  Bank 
insolvencies and lack of credits reduced the investor 
confidence and, as a result, the stock market plummeted.  
In 2009, the global economy contracted by 1.1%, while in 
advanced countries, the contraction reached 3.4%. After 
intervention by central banks and governments of an 
unprecedented scale, the global economy began to 
recover.  However, the global financial system remains at 
risk. 
The danger of cascading failures of major banks 
would be reduced significantly if we could identify banks 
with potential problems before they face solvency and 
liquidity crises.  There are many reasons for bank 
failures.  These include high risk-taking, interest rate 
volatility, 
poor 
management 
practices, 
inadequate 
accounting standards, and increased competition from 
non-depository institutions.  Since the crisis, bank 
regulators have been increasingly concerned with 
reducing the size of deposit insurance liabilities.  It has 
even been suggested that the best regulatory policy is to 
close banks before they become undercapitalised.  
Therefore, identifying potentially failing banks as early as 
possible is essential for avoiding another major financial 
crisis. 
Over the last thirty years many tools have been 
developed to identify problem banks.  While early models 
mostly relied on statistical techniques [1], [4], [6], most 
recent developments are based on fuzzy logic and neural 
networks [2], [7], [9].  Most of these models use a 
dichotomous classification – bankruptcy versus non-
bankruptcy.  In real world, however, banks are ranked in 
terms of their likelihood of bankruptcy.  What regulators 
really need is an early warning system that can “flag” 
potentially failing banks.  Once such banks are identified, 
different preventive programs tailored to each bank’s 
specific needs can be put in place, thereby avoiding a 
major banking failure. 
In this paper, we “flag” potentially failing banks using 
cluster analysis. First, we introduce bank rating system 
used in the U.S., select 100 banks and obtain their 
financial data. Then, we use a self-organising map with a 
5-by-5 array of 25 neurons in the Kohonen layer to 
cluster the selected banks. We demonstrate how to 
determine the number of clusters in a multidimensional 
data set. Finally, we analyse the results and discuss 
challenges related to applications of self-organising maps 
to real life problems. 
 
II. CLUSTER ANALYSIS 
Cluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis 
technique that divides different objects into groups, called 
clusters, in such a way that the degree of association 
between two objects is maximised if they belong to the 
same cluster and minimised otherwise. 
The term “cluster analysis” was first introduced over 
70 years ago by Robert Tryon [8].  Since then, cluster 
analysis has been successfully applied in many fields 
including medicine, archeology, astronomy, etc.  In 
clustering, there are no predefined classes – objects are 
grouped together only on the basis of their similarity.  For 
this reason, clustering is often referred to as unsupervised 
classification.  There is no distinction between

independent and dependent variables, and when clusters 
are found the user needs to interpret their meaning. 
We can identify three major methods used in cluster 
analysis.  These are based on statistics, fuzzy logic and 
neural networks.  In this case study, we will apply a self-
organising neural network. 
In this paper, we “flag” potentially failing banks are 
identified using cluster analysis. 
III. 
BANK RATING SYSTEM 
Our goal is to cluster banks using their financial data.  
The data can be obtained from annual reports of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  The 
FDIC is an independent agency created by the Congress 
of the United States. It insures deposits, examines and 
supervises 
financial 
institutions, 
and 
manages 
receiverships.  To assess the overall financial state of a 
bank, regulators use the CAMELS (Capital adequacy, 
Asset, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity 
to market risk) rating system.  The CAMELS ratings have 
been applied to 8,500 banks in the U.S.  It was also used 
by the United States government in selecting banks for 
the capitalisation program of 2008. 
For our case study, we select 100 banks and obtain 
their financial data from the FDIC annual report for the 
last year.  We adapt the following five ratings based on 
the CAMELS system: 
1. NITA – Net Income divided by Total Assets.  NITA 
represents return on assets.  Failing banks have very 
low or even negative values of NITA. 
2. NLLAA – Net Loan Losses divided by Adjusted 
Assets.  Adjusted assets are calculated by subtracting 
the total loans from the total assets.  Failing banks 
usually have higher NLLAA values than healthy 
banks. 
3. NPLTA – Non-Performing Loans divided by Total 
Assets.  Non-performing loans consist of loans that 
have past their due dates by 90 days and non-accrual 
loans.  Failing banks usually have higher values of 
NPLTA than healthy banks. 
4. NLLTL – Net Loan Losses divided by Total Loans.  
Failing banks have higher loan losses as they often 
make loans to high-risk borrowers.  Thus, failing 
banks usually have higher values of NLLTL than 
healthy banks. 
5. NLLPLLNI – Sum of Net Loan Losses and Provision 
for Loan Losses divided by Net Income.  The higher 
the 
NLLPLLNI 
value, 
the 
poorer 
the 
bank 
performance. 
Preliminary investigations of the statistical data can 
reveal that a number of banks may experience some 
financial difficulties.  Clustering should help us to 
identify groups of banks with similar problems.

SELF-ORGANISING MAP 
Fig. 1 shows a self-organising map (SOM) with a 5-
by-5 array of 25 neurons in the Kohonen layer.  Note that 
neurons in the Kohonen layer are arranged in a hexagonal 
pattern. 
The input data are normalised to be between 0 and 1.  
The network is trained for 10,000 iterations with a 
learning rate of 0.1.  After training is complete, the SOM 
forms a semantic map where similar input vectors are 
mapped close together while dissimilar apart.  In other 
words, similar input vectors tend to excite either the same 
neuron or neurons closely located to each other in the 
Kohonen layer.  This SOM property can be visualised 
using the weight distance matrix, also known as the U-
matrix.

Fig. 2 shows the U-matrix and the SOM sample hit 
plot for the bank financial data.  In the U-matrix, the 
hexagons represent the neurons in the Kohonen layer.  
The colours in the regions between neighbouring neurons 
indicate the distances between them – the darker the 
colour the greater the distance.  The SOM sample hit plot 
reveals how many input vectors are attracted by each 
neuron of the Kohonen layer.

Typically, a SOM identifies fewer clusters than the 
number of neurons in the Kohonen layer, and thus several 
input vectors attracted by close neighbouring neurons 
may, in fact, represent the same cluster.  For instance, in 
Fig. 2(a), we can observe that distances between neurons 
3 – 8, 7 – 8, 7 – 12, 7 – 13, 8 – 9, 8 – 13, 8 – 14, 9 – 14, 
11 – 12, 12 – 13, 12 – 16, 12 – 17, 13 – 14, 13 – 17, 13 – 
18, 14 – 19, 16 – 17, 17 – 18, 17 – 22, 17 – 23, 18 – 19, 
18 – 23, 21 – 22 and 22 – 23 are relatively short (the 
colours in the regions between neighbouring neurons are 
lighter, so the distances are shorter).  Thus, we can 
reasonably assume that neurons 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 
16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 and 23 form a single cluster.  At the 
same time, we should also notice that the distance 
between neurons 3 and 7 is much greater than the 
distances between neurons 3 and 8, and 7 and 8.  
Therefore, it might be useful to examine what makes the 
input vectors associated with neuron 3 so different from 
these attracted by neuron 7.  Table I shows results of 
clustering. Interpreting the meaning of each cluster is 
often a difficult task.  Unlike classification where the 
number of classes is decided beforehand, in SOM-based 
clustering the number of clusters is unknown, and 
assigning a label or interpretation to each cluster requires 
some prior knowledge and domain expertise. 
For a start, we need a way to compare different 
clusters. As we discussed in Case Study 6, the centre of a 
cluster often reveals features that separate one cluster 
from another. Therefore, determining the average 
member of a cluster should enable us to interpret the 
meaning of the entire cluster. In Table I, the last column 
“Financial profile of the cluster” contains mean, median 
and standard deviation (STD) values of the CAMELS 
ratings utilised in this study.  Using these values an 
expert can identify groups of banks that exhibit similar 
patterns of behaviour or experience similar problems. 
Let us begin out analysis by identifying problem 
banks with negative returns on their assets.  As can be 
seen in Table I, three clusters, E, F and G, have negative 
values of NITA.  For example, banks included in Cluster 
E have mean net losses of 0.06% of their total assets.  On 
the other hand, healthy banks usually report a positive 
return on their assets.  Thus, banks included in Cluster A, 
which has the highest value of NITA, could be 
considered healthy.

Regarding the NLLAA rating, Cluster D has the 
highest mean value, followed by Cluster E.  Note that 
although banks in Cluster E are problem banks, their 
NLLAA values are at least 12 times lower than these of 
Cluster D (a 3.63% mean against 44.48%).  This could be 
a clear indication that the three banks associated with 
Cluster D experience severe difficulties with their loans 
(even though they still have a positive return on their 
assets).  Banks in Clusters A, B and C show negative 
NLLAA values, which is normal for healthy banks. 
The value of NPLTA is highest for Cluster B, 
followed by the problem banks in Clusters E, F and G.  
This may indicate that the bank in Cluster B (Cluster B is 
a solitary cluster) experiences difficulties in recovering its 
loans.  In fact, the situation with this particular bank 
could be even worse than with the problem banks 
associated with Clusters E, F and G. 
Finally, the values of NLLTL and NLLPLLNI are 
highest for the two banks in Cluster H, followed by the 
problem banks.  Because higher values of NLLTL 
indicate higher loan losses, we may find that banks in 
Cluster H are involved in providing loans to high-risk 
borrowers.  High risk-taking also contributed to the poor 
performance of these banks, reflected by the high 
NLLPLLNI values. 
An important part of cluster analysis is to identify 
outliers, objects that do not naturally fall into any larger 
cluster.  As can be seen in Table I, there are three banks 
that are viewed as solitary clusters – Cluster B, Cluster F 
and Cluster G.  These banks are outliers, and each of 
them has a unique financial profile.  While conventional 
clustering algorithms, such as K-means clustering, do not 
handle outliers well, a SOM can easily identify them. 
It is difficult, however, to determine the number of 
clusters in a multidimensional data set.  In fact, when a 
clustering algorithm attempts to create larger clusters, 
outliers are often forced into these clusters.  This may 
result not only in poorer clustering but, even worse, in 
failing to distinguish unique objects. 
As an example, let us cluster the same set of banks 
using a 2-by-2 SOM.  The SOM is trained for 1,000 
iterations.  Fig. 3 shows the U-matrix and the SOM 
sample hit plot.  Obviously, now we have only four 
clusters.  Further investigation reveals that based on their 
average values, banks associated with neurons 1, 2 and 3 
can be classified as healthy, while 13 banks attracted by 
neuron 4 as failing.  Two failing banks and two banks 
with unusually high values of NLLPLLNI, previously 
identified by the 5-by-5 SOM, are now absorbed by the 
“healthy” cluster.

V. 
SOM TESTING 
In order to test a neural network, including a SOM, 
we need a test set.  From the FDIC Annual Report we can 
obtain a list of failed banks, and collect appropriate 
financial statement data.  Several studies of bank failures 
suggest that failed banks could be detected between six 
and 12 months before the call date, and in some cases as 
early as four years before a bank fails [2], [5].  Although 
solvency and liquidity are the most important predictors 
of failure close to the call date, asset quality, earnings and 
management practices become increasingly significant as 
the time before failure increases.  To test the SOM 
performance, we select 10 banks that failed last year, and 
collect their one-year-prior financial statement data.  
Table II contains mean, median and standard deviation 
(STD) values of their CAMELS ratings.  Now we can 
apply 10 input vectors to see the SOM response. 
As expected, in the 2-by-2 SOM, all 10 input vectors 
are attracted by neuron 4.  In the 5-by-5 SOM, the 
situation is more complicated.  Six input vectors are 
attracted by neuron 5, two by neuron 10, one by neuron 
20 and two by neuron 24.  Thus, in both cases, failing 
banks are clustered correctly. 
Finally, a word of caution.  Although a SOM is a 
powerful clustering tool, the exact meaning of each 
cluster is not always clear, and a domain expert is usually 
needed to interpret the results.  Also a SOM is a neural 
network, and any neural network is only as good as the 
data that goes into it.  In this case study, we have used 
only five financial variables.  However, to identify 
problem banks well in advance of their failure, we might 
need many more variables that hold additional 
information about bank performance (researchers in the 
industry use up 29 financial variables based on the 
CAMELS rating system). 
A good example of challenges associated with 
clustering is given in [3].  A large bank decided to 
increase its market share in home equity loans.  It 
gathered data on 5,000 customers who had home equity 
loans and 5,000 customers who did not have them.  The 
data included appraised value of a house, amount of 
credit available, amount of credit granted, customer age, 
marital status, number of children and household income.  
The data was then used to train a SOM.  It identified five 
clusters.  One of the clusters was particularly interesting.  
It contained customers who took home equity loans.  
These customers were in their forties, married with 
children in their late teens.  The bank assumed that they 
were taking loans to pay college tuition fees for their 
children.  Thus, the bank organised a marketing campaign 
to offer home equity loans as a means to pay for college 
education.  However, results of the campaign were 
disappointing. 
Further investigation revealed that the problem was in 
the interpretation of the clusters identified by the SOM.  
Consequently, the bank decided to include more 
information about its customers such as type of accounts, 
deposit system, credit card system, etc.  After retraining 
the SOM, it was discovered that customers who took 
home  equity  loans  in  addition  to  being  in  their  forties

accounts.  So, the bank concluded that when children left 
home to go to college, parents took out home equity loans 
to start new businesses.  The bank organised a new 
marketing campaign targeting this group of potential 
customers, and this time the campaign was successful. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A very large number of bank failures in 2008 
triggered a financial crisis.  Although unprecedented 
intervention of central banks and governments helped 
economies to recover, the global financial systems 
remains at risk.  As a result, identifying failing banks as 
early as possible is essential.  This paper has clearly 
demonstrated a great potential of a self-organising neural 
network as a tool for performing this task. The results 
show that self-organising maps can successfully carry out 
bank clustering tasks and identify banks that require 
immediate attention from the regulatory bodies.
