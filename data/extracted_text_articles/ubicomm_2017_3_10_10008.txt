Abstract—In this paper, we address the performance analysis of
the extended adaptive threshold based relay selection (ATRS)
scheme for multiple type-2 relays. More speciﬁcally, the symbol
error rate (SER) analysis of 2-bits feedback based ATRS scheme
is presented. For validation of our analytical results, derived
analytical results are cross-veriﬁed with results obtained via
Monte-Carlo simulations. Some selected results show that with
more reﬁned feedback information, the potential performance
degradation caused by the minimum (i.e., 1-bit) feedback can be
compensated, especially with a 1-bit increase in terms of feedback
data rate and additional single comparison process in terms of
complexity.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, in [1], the adaptive threshold based relay se-
lection (ATRS) scheme with minimum (i.e., ‘1-bit’) feedback
information was proposed by complying with the speciﬁcations
for type-2 (or user equipment (UE)) relay to meet backward
compatibility with the LTE-Advanced standard [2] [4]. Type-
2 relay must be transparent to the end user (D) and the
retransmitted signal from a selected relay is seen at D, like
from the source (S) [1] [2]. If S only has the information of
average channel gain of R-D link, like type-2 relay relaying,
then the end-to-end error performance is degraded severely
due to the insufﬁcient information about R-D link. Here, to
meet such backward compatibility required for type-2 relay,
one of the possible solutions for selecting relay is that the
relay selection process is performed at the transmitter (i.e.,
the source). In [3], it is done at end user and it turns out
that [3] increases the complexity due to selection processing
at end user, which is undesired for the mobile UE with
limited complexity. In this transmitter-oriented scheme unlike
the conventional receiver-oriented method, the relays (Rs) can
use in the limited feedback information to the source about
channel status information and then the source can use them
for selecting the best relay. Based on these observations, in
[1], the author proposed the threshold-based relay selection
method that requires the minimum feedback load (i.e., ‘1-bit
feedback information’).
With [1], there is no need to feedback the full channel
information to S that may cause a system overhead. This
overhead caused by the channel status information (CSI)
exchange is the bottleneck of practical implementations so that
the reduction of overhead due to the required CSI exchanges
is crucial. Instead of transmitting the full channel information,
each relay simply reports to S about its R-D link status (e.g.,
“unacceptable” or “acceptable”). Then, S selects the relay with
the highest S-R link gain among acceptable relays which have
“acceptable” R-D link status. Therefore, with ATRS proposed
in [1], there is no need to exchange the control (scheduling)
message between Rs and D and as a result, it lead to satisfy the
backward compatibility with type-2 relay. Further, [1] provides
bandwidth efﬁciency and reduced complexity while it still
provides an acceptable performance.
However, with the ATRS scheme [1], there may exist
a potential performance degradation caused by applying the
minimum (i.e., ‘1-bit’) feedback information instead of the full
CSI. More speciﬁcally, it is likely to mistakenly discard some
links with better R-D channel links. For example, there may
exist a relay that does not provide better S-R link compared
to the scheduled relay among selected candidates only with
two levels R-D link status information. Here, this poten-
tial performance degradation can be compensated with more
reﬁned feedback information. More speciﬁcally, instead of
selecting acceptable or unacceptable relays with one threshold,
by adopting one more threshold as shown in Figure 1, the
status of each relay according to its R-D link gain is classiﬁed
as three levels (i.e., “unacceptable”, “good”, or “better”). Then,
after selecting each best relay from the good candidate group
and the better candidate group, respectively, S selects the best
one among these two relays. Here, since each relay needs to
notify one of R-D link status among three status levels, 2-bit-
based feedback is required. Therefore, with this 2-bits feedback
based ATRS scheme, the potential performance degradation
can be compensated with a 1-bit increase in terms of feedback
data rate and additional single comparison process in terms of
complexity.
Based on these observations, in [5], one more threshold
was adopted. According to [5], by adopting one additional
threshold to ‘1-bit feedback’ based ATRS scheme [1], system
can provide the symbol error rate (SER) performance very
close to that of the perfect feedback case. Although the pos-
sibility of missing better channel links can be eliminated, the
authors of [5] provided the SER performance results only from
the computer simulations without any analytical derivations.
Since the SER results from simulation show the performance
only for the tested parameter range, we need the versatile
analytical performance results which provide important insight
on general range of parameter values [6]–[8]. However, we still
need an accurate and efﬁcient performance analysis, since, as
far as we are aware, the general performance analysis results
are not currently available.
Main Contributions: In this work, we statistically analyze
the SER performance of ‘2-bits feedback’ based ATRS scheme
for multiple type-2 relays. More speciﬁcally, the closed-form

result of SER is derived and validated with results obtained
via Monte-Carlo simulations. Note that the derived closed-
form results of SER can be easily evaluated numerically in the
standard mathematical packages, such as MATHEMATICA,
MATLAB and MAPLE.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we present the system and channel models including the mode
of operation. Then, we provide in Section III the SER perfor-
mance analysis for M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) signaling
based on the statistical analysis. Finally, some selected results
are provided followed by concluding remarks, in Sections IV
and V, respectively.
II.
SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODELS
Similar to [1], we assume that all channel links are quasi-
static (or block ﬂat fading) and mutually independent, which
means that the channels are constant within one transmission
duration, but vary independently over different transmission
durations. In addition, the fading conditions follow Rayleigh
fading model. In the performance analysis, we assume that all
relays are statistically identical.
We also consider a network with multiple type-2 relays and
decode-and-forward (DF) protocols [9] [10], where a source
node, S, communicates with a destination node, D, with the
help of multiple type-2 relays, Ri, (there exist N possible
relays). The channel gains of S-D, S-Ri, and Ri-D links are
denoted by hs,d, hs,ri, and hri,d which are assumed zero-mean
complex Gaussian random variables with variances δ2
s,d, δ2
s,ri,
and δ2
ri,d, respectively.
Each node has only one omni-directional antenna. There-
fore, all the nodes operate on half-duplex mode. Furthermore,
it is assumed that each relay knows the CSI of its S-Ri
link and CSI of its Ri-D link based on ACK/NACK from
end user (D) [1] [2]. More speciﬁcally, based on the system
model of the type II relay shown in [1] [2], each relay can
overhear the reference signal including ACK/NACK signal
periodically sent from D to S. Such overheard signals can
be used for estimating each R-D link quality by comparing
with pre-determined thresholds. Therefore, it is possible to
partially feedback the R-D link channel conditions to S [1].
Given some form of network block synchronization, carrier
and symbol synchronization for the network can build equally
between the individual transmitters and receivers. Exactly how
this synchronization is achieved, and the effects of small
synchronization errors on performance, is beyond the scope
of this paper.
In the relay selection scheme, similar to [1], we assume
TDD mode where hs,d and hs,ri are known at S, and hri,d
are known at R, but hri,d must be fedback to S by R
that causes system overhead. Here, we extend the proposed
ATRS scheme with ‘1-bit feedback information’ in [1] as
‘2-bits feedback information’ based scheme by adopting two
thresholds to improve the SER performance while slightly
increasing system complexity. Note that [5] shows that more
speciﬁc information assures better R-D channel condition for
the best relay, resulting in an improved SER performance [5].
The relay selection strategy is similar to the ATRS scheme
with 1-bit feedback [1]. In [1] [5], the relay selection protocol
proposed in [11] is adopted to compensate the drawbacks of the

performance degradation due to the limited feedback. In [11],
they proposed the relay selection protocol using a modiﬁed
harmonic mean, which is an appropriate metric to represent the
relay’s ability on how much help a relay can offer. According
to [11], the optimal relay is the one which has the maximum
value of the relay’s metric, which is a modiﬁed version of
the harmonic mean function of its source-relay and relay-
destination instantaneous channel gains. Therefore, if multiple
relays are available and we need to choose one relay only,
then the relay with maximum value in terms of the modiﬁed
harmonic mean is selected. Similarly, in [5], the optimal relay
is the one which has the maximum value of the modiﬁed
version of the harmonic mean among candidate relays. Specif-
ically, the scheme with limited feedback information selects
the relay, which maximizes the modiﬁed harmonic mean of
S-R and R-D links: i) S transmits both to all relays and to D;
ii) D transmits an ACK/NACK message, which is overheard at
multiple relays to acquire information about the R-D links; iii)
eligible relays must communicate their eligibility to S; iv) S
selects the best relay in terms of the modiﬁed harmonic mean.
Here, the main difference of the 2-bits feedback based scheme
compared to [1] is to quantize the R-D link with three levels,
i.e., “unacceptable”, “good” or “better” as shown in Figure
1. The quantized R-D channel gains value can be written as
βri,d ∈ {0, βth1, βth2} (for i = 1, 2, . . ., k and k ≤ N). More
speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst stage, each relay notiﬁes S of being
“better” or “good” if
βri,d ≥βth2 −→available with a better link condition,
or
βth2 >βri,d ≥ βth1 −→available with a good link condition,
for i = 1, 2, . . . , k2,
(1)
where k1 + k2 = k, βx,y = |hx,y|2, and βthj (for j = 1, 2)
is the threshold (βth1 < βth2). Similar to [1], since such
relays are considered as candidates for the best relay and
their SNR values are one of the two threshold values (i.e.,
βth1 or βth2), choosing the relay who can maximize the
modiﬁed harmonic mean function of S-R and R-D channel
gains based on the S-R link condition will select the best
relay. Speciﬁcally, the source selects one candidate from the
‘better’ candidate group whose R-D channel gain exceeds the
threshold βth2 is βb = max{βs,r1, βs,r2, . . . , βs,rk2 } and the
other candidate from the ‘good’ candidate group whose R-
D channel gain below the threshold βth2 but exceeds the
threshold βth1 as βa = max{βs,r1, βs,r2, . . . , βs,rk1 }. Then,
the source chooses the best S-R link from these two candidates
to maximize the modiﬁed harmonic mean of S-R and R-D
channel gains. Consequently, the optimum relay will have
a metric, which is equal to max

, especially for P1 =P2. If
there exists no candidate (k = 0), the source randomly chooses
one relay among N relays similar to [1].
For cooperative transmission (upon reception of NACK) in
the second stage, the best relay forwards data to the end user
if decoding is performed correctly and otherwise, the relay
remains idle. In addition, we also assume that the system has
the total power constraint of P =P1+P2, where P is the total
maximum transmit power available, P1 and P2 are the transmit
powers at the source and at the selected relay, respectively.
Further, we also assume maximal-ratio combining (MRC) for
the signals from source and selected relay to destination, for
which the destination estimates the CSI for coherent detection.
Then, the instantaneous SNR of MRC output can be evaluated

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, by adopting the performance analysis
framework applied in [1], the SER performance of the ATRS
scheme with 2-bits feedback is analyzed for M-PSK signaling.
With the help of [1], the average SER conditioned on the
number of candidates k1 and k2 can be formulated as
SERtotal=
X
k1
X
k2
SER (k1, k2) P (K1 = k1, K2 = k2) ,
(2)
where SER (k1, k2) is the SER at the destination when there
are k1 candidate relays with ‘good’ R-D links and k2 candidate
relays with ‘better’ R-D links and P (K1 = k1, K2 = k2) is
the probability of having candidate relay subsets of size k1
and k2. In deriving P (K1 = k1, K2 = k2), the problem can
be simpliﬁed as “How many candidate relays in each group
(‘good’ and ‘better’) exist?” because we assume that all the
relays are statistically identical. As a result, the probability
of having k1 and k2 candidates follows the multinomial
distribution [12]. Therefore, we can obtain the probability of
having k1 and k2 candidates in each group as
P (K1 =k1, K2=k2)=
N!
k1!k2!(N−k1−k2)!

In deriving SER (k1, k2), if there is no relay for co-operation
mode, the direct transmission is performed. Otherwise, the
relay cooperation mode is performed. As a result, we can
formulate SER (k1, k2) with two SER terms of the direct
transmission mode and the relay cooperation mode as
SER (k1, k2)=Pe(s, ri| k1, k2) Pe(s, d)
+[1−Pe(s, ri| k1, k2)] Pe(s, ri, d|k1, k2) ,
(4)
where Pe (s, ri|k1, k2), Pe (s, d), and Pe (s, ri, d|k1, k2) repre-
sent the conditional decoding error at the best relay, the SER
for direct transmission, and the conditional SER for coopera-
tive transmission, respectively. Then, we need to evaluate three
conditional decoding error terms at the best relay in (4).
A. For the conditional decoding error at the best relay,
Pe (s, ri| k1, k2)
In this case, we overall need to consider two cases,
separately. More speciﬁcally, if the βk∗

cooperation is selected from k2 candidates and otherwise, the
relay for cooperation is selected from k1 candidates as

Figure 3 shows that as our original expectation, the pro-
posed ATRS scheme with 2-bits feedback information achieves
better performance than 1-bit feedback based scheme. More
speciﬁcally, the possibility that the 2-bits feedback based
scheme can provide the better performance compared to the
1-bit feedback based scheme is high because through one
additional bit in terms of a feedback information and one
additional comparison operation in terms of the complexity,
the 2-bits feedback based scheme has the higher ability to
compensate the potential performance degradation. Further, if
we consider that the S-R link condition of each candidates
selected from both ‘better’ and ‘good’ candidate groups is
similar, the performance improvements of the 2-bits feedback
based scheme is getting increasing compared to the 1-bit
feedback based scheme as the threshold, βth2, increases.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we analyzed the SER performance of the
extended ATRS scheme based on ‘2-bits feedback’ informa-
tion as closed-form expressions. For validation of analytical
results, derived analytical results were cross-veriﬁed with
results obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations. Based on some
selected results, we conﬁrmed that with more reﬁned feedback
information, the potential performance degradation caused by
the 1-bit feedback can be compensated, especially with a 1-bit
increase in terms of feedback data rate and additional single
comparison process in terms of complexity.
