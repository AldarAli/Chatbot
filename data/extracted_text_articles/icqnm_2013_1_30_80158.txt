Abstract—We analyze the angular distribution of photoemis-
sion (PAD) from irradiated C60 clusters focusing on the impact
of resonances on emission properties. We make a prospective
investigation in terms of a widely used jellium approach, devel-
oping an improved version thereof. The jellium allows a simple
access in terms of reduced dimension, which is a priori justiﬁed
by the high degree of symmetry of C60. We show that the PAD
is strongly affected by optical resonances, an effect, which would
be certainly even enhanced if using a more realistic description
of the ionic background.
Keywords—C60, optical resonances, photoemission, jellium
model, time-dependent density-functional theory.

INTRODUCTION
Photo-induced reactions constitute a key tool to explore the
properties of molecules and clusters. Detailed measurements
of the emitted electrons provide useful data for analyzing
irradiation dynamics. We think here, in particular, of their ki-
netic energies and angular distributions, coined Photo-electron
Angular Distributions (PAD) [1], [2]. Such measurements have
a long history in cluster physics [3], [4], [5], [6]. The steady
upgrades of light sources and target setups now allow to
gather such data with high precision in a large variety of
systems [7], [8], [9], and even to analyze dynamical features
[9]. Amongst these many studied systems is also the much
celebrated fullerene C60 [10], which can be viewed as a
particularly symmetric large molecule or as a cluster. This
interesting system has also been analyzed with respect to
photo-emission properties [9]. Although it is rather convenient
to handle in experiments, C60 remains a demanding object for
a theoretical description, particularly if one aims to analyze
its dynamics in full detail. However, the increasing number
of experimental results calls for more systematic theoretical
analysis of the dynamical response to irradiation, especially in
terms of the properties of emitted electrons.
In this contribution, we consider, in particular, the PAD
on C60 and analyze it as a function of laser frequency.
The aim is to investigate the relation between PAD and the
optical excitation spectrum, especially its resonances. The
optical response is the ﬁrst important observable because it
provides the entrance door for the coupling of a system to
light pulses. The detailed analysis of the structure of the
optical response is thus the crucial ﬁrst step. In particular,
its resonances strongly inﬂuence ionization dynamics [11].
For a ﬁrst exploration, we choose as simple approach a
spherical jellium proﬁle as model for the ionic background.
This can be justiﬁed by the fact that the highly regular
shape of C60 is close to spherical symmetry and because we
restrict ourselves to rather short laser pulses during which
ionic motion can be neglected. Moreover, we remind that
experiments in gas phase deal with an isotropic ensemble of
cluster orientations. This, in turn, requires involved orientation
averaging when dealing with detailed ionic background [12].
Spherical jellium represents as such an isotropic system and so
provides a simple way to account for the necessary orientation
averaging. As a further technical advantage, the spherical
jellium background allows us to use a cylindrically symmetric
approximation for describing electronic wavefunctions, which
represents enormous computational savings and so allows
systematic studies. The theoretical description of electrons
relies here on Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory
(TDDFT) [13] at the level of Time-Dependent Local-Density
Approximation (TDLDA) with the xc-functional of [14] and
LDA augmented by an average Self-Interaction Correction
[15]. Electronic wavefunctions are discretized on a cylindrical
grid and absorbing boundary conditions are used to remove
gently the escaping electrons [16], [17], which also provides
a simple estimate of the PAD [18].
The paper is outlined as follows: Section II introduces a
spherical jellium model for C60 with soft jellium boundaries.
The obtained values for the Ionization Potential (IP) and
the HOMO-LUMO gap are discussed as a function of the
model parameters and compared to experimental results. The
following section, Section III, discusses the structure of the
absorption spectrum determined within the TDLDA approach
for the presented jellium model and points out the main
features in the spectrum such as resonances and the collective
Mie surface plasmon. Section IV analyzes in detail the impact
of optical resonances on photoemission observables, e.g., on
total ionization and angular distribution of emitted electrons.
Thereby, the molecule is irradiated by a femtosecond laser
pulse with frequencies tuned around the resonances above
the IP.
II.
THE JELLIUM BACKGROUND
The spherical jellium model for C60 has been used since
long because it is an efﬁcient approach for many principle
studies, for often used parametrizations see [19], [20]. A
slight disadvantage of these jellium models is that they deliver
an electronic shell closure at electron number Nel = 260,
rather far away from the experimental Nel = 240. (The latter
comes from the fact that each carbon atom provides 4 valence
electrons taking part in binding which altogether make 240
active electrons.) Not only this, the steep jellium boundaries
are not well suited for computations using a grid representation
as we do.
In order to have a robust jellium model usable on ﬁnite
size meshs, the model should display a smooth transition from
the homogeneous bulk density to zero. This can be achieved

The pseudo-density ρjel is the positively charged counterpart
of the electron density forming both together a neutral system.
In addition to the Coulomb potential of ρjel, we also con-
sider a pseudo-potential Vshift, which consists in a localized
potential shift to put energetic relations right. Similar as for
the previous steep jellium models, we choose R = 6.7 a0 and
rs = 1.15236 a0. New is the parameter for the surface width
σ. It allows some further ﬁne tuning. But it should also be
chosen sufﬁciently large for numerical convenience. We will
consider a series of σ. The jellium width ∆R is to be chosen
such that the total charge ﬁts N, i.e.
4π

dr r2 ρjel(r) = N
.
(4)
Actually, we ﬁnd with the soft jellium model a shell closure
at Nel = 238, thus very close to the expected value of Nel =
240. Thus we choose for the background N = Nel = 238.
Altogether we have the model parameters
N = 238 , rs = 1.15236 a0 , R = 6.7 a0
σ = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 a0
.
(5)
The radius width ∆R is adjusted according to condition (4).
We consider three models with surface widths σ = 0.5, 0.6,
and 0.7 a0. The strength v0 of the potential shift depends on σ.
The v0 is listed in Table I together with IP and HOMO-LUMO
gap. The table shows that the IP is robust and already well
tuned by the choices for rs, R and v0. The HOMO-LUMO
gap is extremely sensitive to the softness parameter σ. The
experimental data are also found in Table I for comparison. It
indicates that σ = 0.6 a0 is the preferred choice concerning
the HOMO-LUMO gap.

DIPOLE SPECTRA
As a ﬁrst step, we will look at the optical absorption
spectrum of C60 in terms of the dipole strength. To this end,
we use TDDFT with the techniques of spectral analysis as

outlined in [21]. We compare the results for the three values
for σ under consideration.
Figure 1 shows the results. The low energy peak at about
0.3 Ry is surprisingly robust against variation of σ in spite of
the fact that the HOMO-LUMO gap is strongly dependent on
σ. This indicates that this low energy peak is of collective
nature. The Mie surface plasmon peak resides around 1 Ry. It
is strongly fragmented and broadened. The largest dependence
on σ is seen in the upper branch of the surface plasmon peak.
There is some down shift with increasing σ and a strong
change of fragmentation. Only the case σ = 0.7 a0 displays
one clean upper peak while the two other σ produce double and
triple peaks. We have also checked the impact of box size and
number of absorbing points. Comparing with results from a
50% larger box and another case with twice as much absorbing
points (32 instead of 16 points). The spectral structures are
practically independent of the box. Thus we have to conclude
that they are a physical feature of the given jellium model.
As these structures appear in the particle continuum, they
correspond to scattering resonances. The upper panel shows
the spectrum in logarithmic scale and over a larger frequency
band. This points out even better the dominance of the Mie
surface plasmon and it indicates furthermore a broad resonance

TREND OF ANISOTROPY AND EMISSION TIME WITH
LASER FREQUENCY
The full angular distributions dσ/dΩ are functions of
the angles θ and φ for each laser frequency ωlas. Spherical
symmetry reduces this to a function of θ only. Even then,
it is extremely hard to study systematic trends with such
bulky observables. Fortunately, it turns out that the most
characteristic pattern in the regime of weak laser excitations
(one photon processes) is the anisotropy β2. Indeed, the PAD
cross section dσ/dΩ can be shown to be proportional to
1 + β2P2(θ), where P2 is the second Legendre polynomial
and θ the angle with respect to the laser polarization axis [12].
We will now investigate the anisotropy β2 as function of laser
frequency. For reasons of numerical convenience, we use here
the softest model with σ = 0.7 a0. The laser frequencies used
here are all in a range above the IP of C60 and the intensities
are moderate such that we deal with one-photon processes
throughout. The PAD can thus be simply analyzed by means
of the anisotropy parameter β2.
Figure 2 shows observables from electron emission com-
puted with the soft jellium model with surface width σ =
0.7 a0. The intensity was kept constant throughout all frequen-
cies. The upper panel repeats the dipole strength from TDLDA
and compares it with the strength of the pure one-particle-
one-hole (1ph) states as deduced from the static calculations.
This shows that the Mie surface plasmon peak resides in a
vacuum of 1ph states. A bunch of fragmented strength below
the resonance is caused by the coupling to the many 1ph states
there. The middle panel shows the total ionization Nesc(ωlas).
It follows nicely the trends of the dipole strength.
The lower panel ﬁnally shows the anisotropy β2(ωlas).
Large ﬂuctuations are seen at the lower frequency side where
we have the 1ph dominated states in the spectrum (see upper
panel) and also the values are generally larger in this region.
Above that 1ph region, the values drop to lower level and
remain rather constant over a broad range of ωlas. The ﬁrst
three vertical dashed lines mark two minima and one maximum
of β2 while the fourth vertical line goes through the resonance
peak. It is interesting to note that the minima of β2 are related
to the position of strongest slope upwards wings of the dipole
strength before a peak. The maximum in β2 seems to be related
to a minimum in the dipole strength. Nothing special for β2
can be spotted at the resonance frequency and along the right
wing of the resonance.
It is known that the time proﬁle of dipole oscillations and
ionization depends on the laser frequency in relation to system
resonances, see e.g. [22]. In order to allow tracking a frequency
dependence, we reduce the time proﬁle of ionization Nesc(t)
to three key values: maximum slope ∂tNesc, the time tmax
at which maximum slope is reached, and the “ﬁnal slope”
∂tNesc

t=tfin at the end of the simulation time. The deﬁnition is
illustrated in Figure 3. We see that the off-resonant case shows
signiﬁcant emission only during the laser pulse of 500/Ry
while the resonant case is accompanied by long persisting
dipole oscillations, which lead to emission after the pulse has
died out. This feature is characterized by the ﬁnal slope. Zero
ﬁnal slope indicates an off-resonant excitation. The ﬁgure also

indicates that resonant emission is associated with some delay
leading to later tmax.
Figure 4 shows the three key values of ionization as
function of laser frequency. The upper panel shows the time
tmax where Nesc(t) has maximum slope. Peaks in dipole
strength (resonances) are clearly related to delay in emission
thus larger tmax. However, the small peaks in the 1ph region
make a much larger effect than the broad Mie surface plasmon
peak. A similar behavior is seen in the maximum (relative)
slopes as such, which are shown in the middle panel. It is
plausible that large tmax correlate with low maximum slopes
and vice versa. Large ﬂuctuations reside in the region of 1ph
strength. The lower panel shows the ﬁnal slopes, evaluated at

the end of the computation (tﬁnal = 1000/Ry). It indicates the
amount of post-oscillations, which persist after the laser pulse
is over. And again, we see large effects in the 1ph region, none
at all at Mie plasmon resonance.
We have seen in the above discussion that the position of
1ph states relative to the resonance peak may have a decisive
impact on the pattern of β2 and slopes. We check this by
comparing the soft jellium model used above (σ = 0.7 a0)
with the steep jellium model from Bauer et al [20]. The results
are shown in Figure 5. The resonance position for the steep
jellium is a bit higher. This is due to the fact that we use
here 260 electrons, instead of 238 in the soft jellium. The
important point is the relative position between 1ph strength
and the resonance. And here it is clear that the steep jellium
produces a much larger overlap between resonance and 1ph
band. Moreover, the 1ph spectra of steep jellium are less
bunched than those of soft jellium. (This may be a result from
the coarse numerical reproduction of steep jellium on a ﬁnite
grid.) The resonance is thus more strongly fragmented and
more fuzzy for steep jellium. The anisotropy seems to yield
at ﬁrst glance different pattern. But the qualitative ﬁndings
are the same: we see high β2 with large ﬂuctuations in
the energy range of the 1ph bands but a smaller and more
constant β2 above the band. The ﬁnal slope (right lower panel)
conﬁrms this sensitivity to the 1ph region. This also holds
for the maximum slope and time thereof where ﬂuctuations
are correlated with the 1ph band and constant trends above.
However, in these latter two observables we see much smaller
ﬂuctuations for the steep jellium. Altogether, this comparison
shows the extreme sensitivity of the results to the detailed
spectral fragmentation. The effects may be now understood
qualitatively. But a quantitative prediction will require a very
reliable model of C60.
V.
CONCLUSION
This ﬁrst investigation, although preliminary, already pro-
vided several interesting conclusions. The soft jellium model
delivers an acceptable description of C60 with Nel = 238
electrons while allowing conveniently large grid spacings.

There is a signiﬁcant fragmentation (depending on model
parameters) of the surface plasmon resonance, which is caused
by a high density of 1ph resonances in the continuum. A
possible weakness is that the spherical model leads to a too
pronounced structure due to the bunching of s.p. levels into
degenerated angular momentum blocks. The lower symmetry
of the actual fullerene structure may deliver a more diffuse
sequence of resonances, which, in turn, could allow the surface
plasmon to look more like one broad resonance peak. The
question is what effect the bunching may have on the trends
of the anisotropy parameter β2. Comparison of results from
steep with soft jellium indicates that more diffuse 1ph spectra
reduce the amplitude of the fast ﬂuctuations in anisotropy

and slopes. The soft jellium model allows robust and stable
calculations of basic emission properties as anisotropy and
emission time. The results conﬁrm a relation between dipole
strength and minima or maxima in the anisotropy as function
of laser frequency. These effects are, however, much more
pronounced in the regime of 1ph fragmentation than in the
surface plasmon resonance. This qualitative result seems to be
conﬁrmed by calculations in the steep jellium model. The next
step is certainly to explore these trends in a more detailed
manner using a full ionic background and thus a full 3D
description of the system. The ﬁrst results of such more
complete computations are presently being produced.
