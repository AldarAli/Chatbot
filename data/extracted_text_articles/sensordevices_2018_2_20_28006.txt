Abstract—This paper describes the novel concept of the optical 
sensor, which utilizes the physical nature of the light 
propagating in a silicon wire with the periodic segmented 
grating placed in the waveguide vicinity over the silica buffer. 
In specific cases, this segmented grating works as a virtual 
leaky waveguide, which radiates power as an outcoming 
optical beam having small both wavelength band and beam 
divergence. The radiation angle strongly depends on the 
refractive index of the grating environment. Thus, this device 
can be used as an optical sensor with the readout to be 
arranged by measuring the far field pattern in the focal plate 
of the lens, which is placed near the sensor element. The device 
concept is verified by direct numerical modelling through the 
Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The most popular optical sensors are based on the high 
precision measuring the optical wavelength that propagates 
in the photonic structure and whose properties depend on the 
environment of the sensor element. It can be done by a 
tunable laser with a fine linewidth or by launching into the 
waveguide the optical beam, which contains a broad 
wavelength range, say, from the super-luminescence diode, 
and measuring the transmitting signal by the Optical 
Spectrum Analyzer (OSA). Both these variants provide the 
possibility to develop advanced optical sensors with the 
sensitivity depending on the design of optical element and 
the spectrum resolution of the tunable laser or the OSA. Both 
of these readout schemes are rather costly, which prevents 
the wide spread of these sensor technologies. 
The current paper presents the new concept of the optical 
sensor design. The idea of this sensor comes from the 
background of optical phenomena, which takes place in the 
silicon 
wire 
with 
the 
periodic 
segmented 
grating 
evanescently coupled through the silica buffer. 
When the guided optical beam, which contains a broad 
spectral range, arrives in the grating area (see Figure 1), 
different optical processes can occur, depending on the ratio 
between the optical wavelength 0 and the grating period  
[1]. In this paper, we will not discuss the well-known effect 
of the Bragg reflection to the guided wave propagating in a 
silicon wire in the opposite direction and the broadband 
interaction with radiation modes that provides the outcoming 
optical wave with the radiation angle depending on the 
optical wavelength. Our investigation is focused on the 
resonance-type interaction of incoming guided wave with the 
virtual leaky wave that is supported by the periodic grating 
structure, coupled by the evanescent field with the 
underplayed silicon wire. We call this type of diffraction 
regime “abnormal blocking” [2]. It is interested to note that 
this interaction is a resonance type, like a Bragg reflection, 
and it is supported by the outcoming optical beam, like a 
coupling with the radiated modes. However, in contrast to 
the last process, the coupling to radiated modes has a 
resonance feature and thus this effect of “abnormal blocking” 
can be used for sensing applications [2]. 
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II we 
define the sensor design and features, while in Section III we 
summarize the conclusions.

of the guided wave with the virtual leaky wave of the segmented grating. 
Here,  = d0 + d2 is the period of grating, H and d2 are the height and the 
width of the segmented grating, d0 is the spacing between the strips, d and 
h are the waveguide and buffer heights, respectively.  
II. SENSOR DESIGN AND FEATURES 
The principle of this type of sensor is based on the 
utilization of the radiated feature of coupling the guided to 
the virtual leaky wave, which takes place in the segmented 
grating structure placed in the vicinity of the silicon wire 
waveguide. This interaction has the maximum effect when 
the well-known Bragg condition on conservation of the 
momentum is satisfied: 

NL =  Ng - p/ = n0sin() 

where NL and Ng are effective indices of the leaky and 
guided waves of the silicon waveguide with the segmented 
grating structure, p is the diffraction order of the grating,  
and n0 are the radiated angle (relative to the structure normal) 
and the refractive index of the grating environment, say, the 
water for the case of a liquid sensor, respectively.  
The changing of the grating environment index by the 
amount dN leads to the change in the condition (1) of 
diffraction observation. This change is the subject of the 
measurement by the optical sensor. The main sensor 
parameters could be derived from Eq. (1) in the form of the 
following set of equations: 

NL/n =  Ng/n - /np/


Sn = /n = /p(NL/n -/+ Ng/n)


n = /n = - p/[ n0cos()]

Eq. (2) is characterized by the mode index sensitivity of 
the sensor. In order to improve the sensitivity, one can use 
the waveguide near the cutoff, the slot [3][4] or segment 
waveguide structures [5]. Eq. (3) describes the homogeneous 
sensitivity of the typical sensor, which works by measuring 
the Drop wavelength of the structure. The last Eq. (4) 
corresponds to the homogeneous sensitivity feature of our 
sensor, which measures the small index variation by the 
determination of the diffraction angle of the radiated power, 
which is generated during the interaction of guided and 
virtual leaky waves. This effect of “abnormal blocking” [2] 
has a resonance feature and thus this radiated angle  has 
also the resonance behavior on the optical wavelength. By 
the analysis of the far field diffraction, corresponding to the 
condition of realization of the “abnormal blocking”, one can 
get information about the index change in the grating 
vicinity. This analysis can be done by using the field 
distribution in the focal plate of the lens obtained by the 
charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. 
The structure design, which is under investigation, is 
shown in Figure 1. The silicon wire having the height h = 
250 nm and the width w = 450 nm is placed on a thick 2 µm 
silicon dioxide buffer. It corresponds to the optical 
waveguide, which supports a transverse electric (TE)-
polarized single mode (electric field in the plane of the 
waveguide). The segmented structure is achieved by the 
periodic ( = 1.3 µm) strips from polymer SU-8 (index 
np=1.56) with length 0.50 µm, height H = 1.0 µm and width 
W=1.0 µm and which is separated from the silicon 
waveguide by a silica overlayer from a flowable oxide (FOx) 
having height d = 200 nm and index 1.4. 
This structure is investigated by numerical modeling, 
which has been performed using the Finite Difference Time 
Domain (FDTD) method through the commercial software 
package RSoft-SYNOPSYS [6]. In order to examine the long 
structure, we utilize FDTD under the two dimensional (2D) 
approximation based on the effective index method (EIM) 
[7], as in Figure 2. Previously, we have shown that the EIM 
method has a fundamental limitation [8][9], which takes 
place when trying to analyze the pulsed excitation of 
waveguide structures by 2D FDTD method.

propagation of a short pulse containing a wide spectral 
composition. Therefore, the classical EIM can be used only 
for the monochromatic excitation of a waveguide.  
We found an original solution to this problem. The 
presence of waveguide dispersion leads to the fact that the 
wavelengths of anomalous blocking m found using the 2D 
FDTD modeling depend on the wavelength 0, at which the 
impulse excitation and spectrum analysis of the waveguide 
structure is carried out. However, for the case when m = 0 
this value is exactly equal to the desired value. Therefore, by 
constructing the dependence 0 on the difference 0-m and 
having determined the values 0 at the zero coordinate (see 
Figure 2), it is possible to find the wavelengths of the 
anomalous blocking for different values of the perturbation 
of the refractive index of the environment. This optical 
wavelength (determined for different values of the 
environment indices and structure parameters) is used for all 
simulations. This algorithm allows to determine the correct 
values Sn and n, by 2D FDTD plus EIM.

wave, which propagates along the silicon wire with segmented grating:      
a) M=512, b) M=1024.  
The sensor element, based on segmented grating over the 
silicon waveguide, can be used through different readout 
schemes. The traditional variant based on measuring the 
transmitted spectrum is illustrated in Figure 3 for different 
number of segments M=512 and M=1024. One can see that 
the suppression of the Drop wavelength is increased with 
increasing the grating length (×M), but this does not 
increase the filter resolution (half width 3.3 nm), which is 
restricted by the optical decay of the leaky wave supported 
by the grating. Nevertheless, by measuring the optical 
wavelength, one can determine the index variation. For the 
case of water environment, we have the homogeneous 
sensitivity Sn=/n = 440 nm/RIU. For the case of an 
Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA) resolution of 0.01 nm, it 
provides the sensor resolution of 1.3 10-5 RIU. 
Similar sensitivity can be achieved by measuring the far 
field distribution of the optical wave, radiated by the grating 
structure, in regime of “abnormal blocking” effect. In order 
to prove this statement, we plot in Figure 4 the angle 
variation of the far field pattern of radiated power, 
corresponding to the 20 different wavelengths around the 
drop wavelength of “abnormal blocking”. These far field 
patterns produce the index-dependent variations in the power 
distribution in the focal plate of the lens (see Figure 5), 
which could be measured by the matrix photodetector.

The thick lines in Figure 4 correspond to the far field of 
the monochromatic wave incidence at drop wavelengths 
1.5768 µm and 1.5725 µm for dN=0.0 and dN=0.01, 
respectively.  
The structure has a limited bandwidth (3.3 nm) of 
wavelength response (see Figure 3). Thus, the part of the 
optical wave at different wavelengths (around the drop one) 
will be also scattered by the grating and will propagate at 
different angles (see (4)). These additional far field patterns 
are shown as thin lines in Figure 4 and Figure 5. They also 
increase the beam divergence relative to monochromatic 
wave. Our analysis proves that this device is suitable for 
measuring the small variation of the refractive index of the 
grating environment. Besides, the sensor resolution is 
increased with increasing the number of segments in the 
grating. For 1024 segments, the angle deviation for dN=0.01 
is twice the optical beam divergence.

patterns corresponding to different optical wavelengths around the Drop 
one; b) the total power distribution (as a sum of 20 different wavelengths), 
which has to be measured by the photodector array.  
It means that under the same condition (the ratio of the Drop 
resolution to the pattern half width) the proposed sensor will 
provide 1.5 better resolution than in the OSA readout of the 
same device, with an arrangement for measuring the far 
field pattern much simpler and cheaper.

CONCLUSION 
We have proposed and carried out numerical modelling 
of a novel type of optical sensor, which utilizes a segmented 
periodic structure over the silicon wire. The tunnel coupling 
of the guided wave to the segmented structure provides 
excitation of the virtual leaky wave in the periodic 
segmented structure. The last radiates the power as an 
outgoing optical beam. This process has a resonance nature 
and takes place at small wavelength range (around 3.3 nm), 
thus the outgoing optical beam has a small divergence (0.33 
degree), which makes possible to determine small index 
environmental variations by measuring the change in the far 
field pattern distribution. This can be accomplished by 
commercial CCD arrays placed in the focal plate of the lens 
in an optical solution much simpler and cheaper than a 
tunable laser or an OSA.
