Abstract—In this paper, we develop an approach and Web-
ontology model for globally distributed structured data 
processing related to junior professionals. This information is 
represented using linked data. The proposed approach is based 
on Representational State Transfer and Semantic Web 
technologies. The proposed approach and model were applied 
in a Web-application for extracting and searching information 
about competences of junior specialists to build teams for small 
IT-projects.  
Keywords- Linked data; OWL; RDFa; globally distributed 
data processing; web-ontologies; competences. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
According to some investigations [17], more than 50% 
of the industrial projects in the sphere of Information 
Technologies (IT-projects) are not successful. According to 
marketing research and experience of project managers [17], 
inadequate organizational structure of the project teams is 
one of the main reasons for the project’s failure. 
Competence model can help to increase the validity of 
decisions taken by project managers in this situation. This 
paper is focused on elaboration of ontological competence 
model and its further use in the Web-application.  
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The area of interest is explored in a number of scientific 
works [1-16]. Semantic search, semantic Web, Web-
ontologies, descriptive logic are studied in [18-21]. 
Numerous 
researches 
are 
dedicated 
to 
knowledge 
representation models and architecture of global distributed 
information systems [11][13][15-16]. 
Here, we develop a competence model for knowledge 
representation. A competence model is a set of skills (or 
competences) [4], which are required to execute tasks of the 
project. In this case, the competence model will be assumed 
in the context of management and recruitment projects. 
Competences can be classified as follows [5]: 
 
Corporate competences, which do not depend on the 
specific position and are common for all employees 
of the entire enterprise; 
 
Managerial competences, which are specific to 
managers who carry out strategic vision, business 
administration and other high-level tasks; 
 
Professional competences, specific to concrete units. 
The authors of [5] added levels for each competence to 
the competence model. “Level” in this model means the 
assessment of competence, with specific descriptions. A 
clear competence model is constructed in [4], however the 
classification of competences is very diffuse (social 
competences, socio-psychological competences, conceptual 
competences, etc.). In [6], no clear distinction between 
competence and skill is made. The skills are separated into 
knowledge and abilities. All skills may depend on strengths 
and weaknesses (soft). Basically, this model was constructed 
for students of technical colleges, but it can be adapted to 
other areas. It is based on the ontological approach.   
Competences in the model from [7, p.4] are divided into 
characteristics, motives, skills, knowledge and self-esteem. If 
they are directly used in the taxonomy of competences, they

complicate the model too much and will not lead to desired 
results [7]. However, some of them may be useful as 
additional characteristics of competences, in the form of 
relations in the domain of competences. i.e., "negotiation 
with the customer" is a skill, and "overcoming stressful 
situations" is a feature. 
In [9], IT-supported strategic competence management is 
considered as a part of a human resource management 
system. For the competence estimation, a scale from 0 (not 
assessed) to 9 (excellent) is used. The values are evaluated 
by using the period of time, when a person has used the 
competence. 
More approaches to the solution of this classification 
problem, taken from the experience of HR managers [6, pp. 
762], may be viewed as follows: skills, knowledge, ability, 
attitude. These competences are divided into 4 levels. 
To assess the competences of students directly, the 
competences are classified as connected to computer science, 
business, or behavior [6]. In accordance with this 
classification, the score ranges from 0 to 1. Each competence 
is assessed by the level of knowledge (beginner, intermediate 
and 
advanced) 
and 
experience 
(basic, 
intermediate, 
advanced). The competence is determined by three 
attributes: the name (a unique identifier for use in HR-XML 
profile), the scale, and the traceable calibration to assess the 
strength. In [10], components of competence are knowledge, 
know-how and behavior. Knowledge is what gets people 
through the education system. Know-how can be obtained 
from personal experience and practice. Behavior is a 
personal characteristic, allowing knowledge to become a 
know-how. According to the HR-XML [10, p.762], it is 
necessary to admit a competence model comparison study 
(validity) and ensure the privacy of the information provided. 
The ability to compare two people in terms of possession of 
a competence can be achieved by describing the selection of 
competences from the dictionary, giving the relationship of 
similarity of competences and competence assessment. 
 
III. 
CONTRIBUTION OVERVIEW 
 
Within the framework of this research a new approach is 
proposed, which we call "Globally Distributed Processing of 
Weakly Structured Data" (GDPWSD). The proposed model 
is slightly different from the existing approaches in three 
aspects: it uses Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) 
instead of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a three-tier 
architecture instead of the client-server, and mediators in the 
form of Web ontologies to unify the process of extracting 
heterogeneous data sources. 
 
A novel technique is used for ontology creation. This 
technique is similar to the stages of database design 
(conceptual, data and physical description models). Its use 
allows the following: 
 
• visualizing the relationship between the concepts of the 
domain in the form of a conceptual model; 
• formalizing relations from the conceptual model in the 
form of a logical model; 
• constructing an ontological model on the basis of the 
logical model. 
IV. 
GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING INFORMATION 
ABOUT JUNIOR SPECIALISTS 
The proposed hybrid approach is based on the 
Representational State Transfer (REST) approach and 
mediator-wrapper approach [11, p. 30; 12, p. 94], which 
uses Semantic Web technologies, including linked data 
formats. 
The main concepts of the approach are the following:  
 
information processing is based on a three-level 
architecture (client, Web server, and a knowledge 
base / database server);  
 
the server does not store the view state. It applies a 
uniform interface to access the resources based on 
the use of IRI;  
 
three levels of abstraction are used: 
o 
application layer, where the search is 
made (managed by users);  
o 
intermediate level (the use of mediators), 
which implements data collection and 
aggregation; Web ontology, which brings 
together various descriptions, is developed 
at this level (managed by ontologists).  
o 
data sources level, using linked data 
(managed by site administrators). 
 
The project and junior specialists are associated via 
role and competence; 
 
It is taken into account that some competences are 
equal (synonyms) and some can be part of others 
(meronyms). 
The features of the proposed approach allow:  
 
flexible and scalable data processing;  
 
unified access to heterogeneous data sources by 
implementing semantic integration 
via Web 
Ontology;  
 
increasing the number of relevant search results. 
V. 
ONTOLOGY MODEL DESCRIPTION 
The ontology model is aimed at describing the necessary 
information [1-2]. It is possible to visualize the relationship 
between key concepts and roles using UML (OMG ODM 
standard). Description logic SHOIN (D) allows to define 
logical axioms. Web Ontology Language with description 
logics (OWL DL) is used to create Web-ontology and then 
utilize it in Web-applications. The basic classes of the 
research domain and their relationships are represented in 
Figure 1. It is assumed that competence and competency are 
synonyms.

Figure 1. Representation of the Ontological Model Using UML Class Diagrams 
 
Here, the concept of the project corresponds to Project, 
which consists of a series of operations Operation: 
Project ≡ ∀ consistsOf.Operation 
The concept that corresponds to the notion of project 
team is ProjectTeam. In this model, it is a composition of 
roles in the project team: 
ProjectTeam ≡ ∀ consistsOf.Participant 
In turn, the role Role can be formal and informal. 
Informal types of roles are taken from the socio-
psychological models. Competence may be professional or 
personal. Hence, the formal role is associated with 
professional competence and the informal role is associated 
with personality: 
Formal⊆∃ posess.Personal 
Informal⊆∃ posess.Professional 
 
The relation between the performer (Executor) and the 
Project is Complex_Competence, which is associated with 
the operation of the project Operation. Every complex 
competence consists of one or several single competences.  
Each professional complex competence Professional is 
tied to a profession with the role belongsTo; it may be 
convenient to group competences, since sometimes one may 
need to immediately specify the profession a person should 
have to perform this role. For a hierarchy of occupations, the 
Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) was used, 
taking into account the specifics of the Russian employment 
market. 
Each of the concepts belongs to its ontology. Their 
relationship is shown in Fig. 2. 
Applying developed Web-application for searching about 
100 various competences for 5 IT-projects showed 
increasing number of appropriate applicants for these 
projects by 10%.

WEB-APPLICATION 
The Web-application based on our Web-ontology model, 
was implemented within the project ProfPort.org [14]. 
Information is extracted from the blogs and from the 
portfolios of the applicants and represented with RDFa, 
hCard microformat standard and simple HTML5/CSS3 
sometimes. The Web-app is implemented with RubyOnRails 
framework as an application server, using document-oriented 
database 
MongoDB 
and 
RDF-store 
BigData. 
The 
deployment diagram and corresponding component diagram 
are presented in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively.

VII. EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS 
The main purpose of the effectiveness analysis is to find 
out how the search results will change upon using synonymy 
and inheritance relations or without them. The main criteria 
that allows evaluating the effectiveness are completeness and 
relevance of the search. 
Presently, 617 employment-seekers are registered in the 
ProfPort system; 428 competencies and 4 professions from 
the field of information technologies are introduced. These 
values allow rough designation of the search space. 
To evaluate the speed of query execution, we use a 
standard 
personal 
computer 
with 
the 
following 
configuration: 
 
Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.40GHz 
 
Motherboard: ASUSTek P8Z77-V LK 
 
Memory: DDR 3 Kingston 2xDIMM 4096 MB 800 
MHz 
 
OS: Windows 8.1 Professional 64 bit 
 
SSD: OCZ Vertex3 224 GB 
 
Local server: Endels 1.64 Freeware 
 
The fragment of the algorithm associated with the 
SPARQL query is used for the longest time using ARC2.The 
results of the experiment are shown in Table. 1.

Now, let us look at how the completeness is changed by 
using synonymy and inheritance relations. Coding is 
synonymous with the competence of Programming, which is 
the parent for several competencies, such as "Programming 
with PHP", "Programming in C#", "Programming with 
JAVA", and so on. Due to the use of ontology, these 
relationships can be taken into account in the search. Table 2 
clearly shows the results of comparing the completeness of 
the results of the search for the keyword "Coding".

Based on the results shown in this table, it can be 
concluded that using an ontological approach for creating an 
information model that supports synonymy and inheritance 
relations, it has been possible to achieve a significant 
increase in the completeness of search results. 
Let us now consider how the secondary search affects the 
relevance of the search results. For example, find 
employment seekers by searching the words PHP and git. By 
this query, quite a lot of results were found, about 10 
competencies and 63 carriers of this competence. Let us 
assume the person conducting the search would want to 
clarify the results. To do this, it would be only necessary to 
enter those who are found in PHP. Accurate results are then 
obtained, with 6 competencies and 26 employment seekers, 
which more closely match search requests. After that, if there 
is a desire to find from the identified employment seekers 
only the ones with the competence of "Application of the 
basic PHPUnit testing techniques," our search would result 
in one specific competency left from the initial 6, and 6 
employment seekers who own it. The search results and their 
quantitative estimates are summarized in Table 3. 
TABLE III.  
THE IMPACT OF SECONDARY SEARCH ON THE RELEVANCE 
OF SEARCH RESULTS 
 
The data given in Table 3 allows drawing the following 
conclusion: the use of detailed search for the results obtained 
has made it possible to increase relevance due to a gradual 
narrowing of the search area. 
VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, an approach for processing information 
about junior specialists is proposed. It allows extraction and 
gathering of necessary information taking into account 
“synonyms” and “meronyms”. 
A Web-ontology model is created using the concepts of 
the proposed approach. It allows storing all necessary 
information about junior specialists and their competences. 
A Web-application is developed using RubyOnRails 
framework. The created ontology is used for information 
representation. It allows a search for necessary specialists 
and building teams for projects. 
Testing the developed Web-app showed an increased 
number of relevant junior specialists for IT-projects.
