INTRODUCTION 
 
Wireless sensors and sensor networks can be deployed 
almost anywhere at a far lower cost than can a wired system. 
With the recent advances in embedded systems and wireless 
technology, 
the 
hardware 
used 
is 
becoming 
more 
inexpensive and more widely available. Wireless sensor 
devices connect sensors wirelessly among each other as well 
as to monitoring and management setups. According to the 
MarketResearch.com the global market for wireless sensor 
devices used in end vertical applications totaled $ US 790 
million in 2011 and expected to increase at a 43.1 % 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach an 
estimated $ US 4.7 billion by 2016 [1]. 
Because wireless sensor networking is built around low-
power radios, the nodes that make up the network play a key 
role in wireless communication. From a physical perspective, 
the deployment of nodes may take several forms depending 
on the sensor application and the desired pattern of 
communication. Deployment may also be a one-time 
activity, where the installation and use of a sensor network 
are strictly separate activities. It can also be a continuous 
process where more nodes are deployed over the lifetime of 
the network [2]. The application can vary from a single 
sensor node to multiple sensor nodes. 
A wireless sensor net is made up of a group of sensor 
nodes. Wireless sensor nodes are the essential building 
blocks in a wireless sensor network. Each sensor node 
possesses the ability to monitor some aspect of its 
environment, and each is able to communicate its 
observations through other nodes to a destination where data 
from the network is gathered and processed. Recent 
developments 
in 
wireless 
technologies 
and 
the 
semiconductor fabrication of miniature sensors are making 
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) smaller and more cost-
effective for a growing number of uses [3]. 
Cost reduction in wireless sensor networks becomes a 
requirement to extend their application in fields where a 
great amount of sensors is needed [4], for example, industrial 
applications. In this case it should be a good solution to 
connect many existing low-cost sensors both: analog and 
quasi-digital to one sensor node to reduce the cost of nodes. 
Traditional approach to use multichannel analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC) and/or analog multiplexers for analog 
sensors will not give any reduction in price. Moreover, the 
analog multiplexer introduces additional measuring error. 
Hence, the analog signal must be preliminary converted to 
the quasi-digital signal (frequency, period, duty-cycle, time 
interval, phase-shift, pulse number or pulse-width modulated 
(PWM) output). 
The described in [4] sensor interface transforms the 
voltage provided by various sensors with different output 
ranges to a pulse signal, which frequency will depend 
proportionally on the input voltage. The conversion of the 
sensor signal to a frequency value will bear much less 
sensitivity to interferences. The further frequency-to-digital 
conversion is performed by using the classical direct 
counting method. This technique counts the number of 
pulses Nx of a signal of unknown period Tx=1/fx during a gate 
time window T0 determined by n periods of a signal of 
known, reference frequency f0. The unknown frequency fx is 
calculated by the number of pulses into the counting 
window:

Such classical method has two well known disadvantages: 
the dependence of relative quantization error x on frequency 
fx, and redundant conversion time determined by the constant 
gate time T0. In order to achieve acceptable performance in 
the conversion to digital values of the frequency signal, it is 
necessary to the different sensor output ranges are converted

into the same frequency range. For this, the conditioning 
electronics must be able to change sensor’s gain and offset 
voltage depending on the sensor signal characteristics. 
The circuit [4] consists of two operational amplifiers, 
analog multiplexer, two programmable potentiometers and 
voltage-controlled 
oscillator, 
which 
performs 
the 
transformation to the frequency range. The low resolution 
serial digital-to-analog converter is used for self-calibration 
purposes. When a node of the network is activated, the 
microcontroller selects the sensor to be read by means of the 
control lines of the analogue multiplexer and carry out the 
conditioning and the conversion. However, such sensor 
interface has some disadvantages. It introduces additional 
error, because of mainly based on analog electronics 
components.  
Mantracourt 
Electronics 
Ltd. 
(UK) 
manufactures 
Wireless Telemetry Pulse Acquisition Module (T24-PA) for 
quasi-digital sensors and transducers with frequency range 
from 0.5 Hz to 3 kHz and relative error 0.15 ... 0.25 % [5]. It 
can not be used with various quasi-digital sensors and 
transducers, which as rule have very broad dynamic 
frequency range: form part of Hz to some tens MHz, and low 
relative error 0.01 % and better [6]. In order to get the 
optimal trade-off between metrological performances and 
price for the sensor node it is expediently to use other, 
universal, advanced solutions based on the novel frequency-
to-digital conversion method. 
In order to design cost-effective sensor nodes, which 
satisfy to modern requirements, the following measures must 
be realized. Instead of voltage or current sensors, so-called 
quasi-digital sensors with frequency, period, time interval, 
phase-shift, pulse number or PWM output must be used. The 
frequency-to-digital converter should be based on the 
advanced method for frequency measurements, which have 
not disadvantages, mentioned above. In case of analog 
output sensors, the intermediate voltage-to-frequency 
converter(s) should be used. 
The aim of this paper is to describe in details the 
developed advanced but cost-effective sensor nodes' 
architectures suitable for further integration in a node-on-
chip for wireless sensor networks. The paper consists of four 
parts and is organized as follows. The first part includes 
state-of-the-art review and task definition. The second part 
describes a design approach for sensor nodes architectures 
based on a Universal Sensors and Transducers Interface 
circuit (USTI) and are suitable for any quasi-digital sensors 
and analog sensors, and the third part is devoted to the 
further design of a node-on-chip based on the USTI-WSN 
IC. The forth part includes results of experimental 
investigation of sensing sub-system based on the USTI IC. 
The last part of the paper provides conclusions and future 
research directions. 
 
II. 
SENSOR NODES' ARCHITECTURES 
A sensor node in a wireless sensor network is capable of 
performing some processing, gathering sensory information 
and communicating with other connected nodes in the 
network. Its architecture consists of the following 
components: sensing sub-system, processing sub-system, 
communication sub-system and power management sub-
system. The sensing sub-system directly influences on 
metrological performances on the whole. However, during 
the last years a lot of publications have been devoted mainly 
to communication and power management sub-systems. This 
article will be focused on the sensing sub-system design, 
which satisfies to the modern requirements of relatively low 
cost, expansibility and power-aware [7]. The low cost means 
that sensor node should be cheap since wireless sensor 
network may have hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes. 
The expansibility signifies that hardware design must be 
expandable with a number of different quasi-digital and 
analog sensors to support a variety of applications. The 
power-aware means that hardware supports intelligent 
function, which allows algorithms to adapt themselves to the 
available power. 
Let consider several advanced sensor node architectures 
for analog and quasi-digital sensors and transducers. All 
these architectures are based on novel USTI ICs developed 
by authors [8]. 
 
A. 
Sensor node architecture with analog multiplexer 
A simple sensor node for analog and quasi-digital sensors 
with analog multiplexer and time division channeling is 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Sensor node with analog multiplexer. 
Sensing sub-system in such architecture contains an 
analog multiplexes (MUX), voltage-to-frequency converter 
(VFC), 
and 
USTI 
ICs. 
A 
processing 
sub-system, 
communication sub-system and power management sub-
system are realized on a separate microcontroller. The USTI 
is a core component of the sensing sub-system. It is based on 
advanced, modified patented frequency (period)-to-digital 
conversion method of the dependent count with a constant 
quantization error in all broad frequency range and non-
redundant conversion time [8-10]. The dependence of 
relative error on conversion time is shown in Figure 2. 
In this case it is not necessary to convert the different 
sensor output ranges into the same frequency range, as it was 
proposed in [4]. Only one voltage-to-frequency converter is 
used to convert sensor's output to frequency. As usually, 
integrated VFCs have broad frequency ranges and good 
metrological performances [11, 12]. In addition, one quasi-
digital sensor can be directly connected to the second 
channel of USTI IC, and one sensing element (resistive,

capacitance or resistive bridge) can be also connected to this 
IC [13].

B. 
Sensor node architecture with digital multiplexer 
The analog multiplexer and VFC introduces additional 
measurement errors. To eliminate the error due to analog 
multiplexer, it is possible to convert voltage to frequency for 
each of analog output sensors before the multiplexer, and use 
a digital multiplexor (MX), instead of analog multiplexer. 
Such sensor node with the digital multiplexer and combined 
(time for digital signal domain and space for analog signal 
domain) channeling is shown in Figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Sensor node with digital multiplexer. 
 
For the time-division channeling, the cycle polling time  
can be calculated according to the following equation [14]:

where delay1 is the time delay between the ending of the 
conversion in the previous sensor and the command to poll 
the next sensor; delay2 is the time delay of the frequency 
conversion starting after the sensor connection; n is the 
number of sensors in the sensor node; Tmeas is the 
measurement time. The measurement time Tmeas for the USTI 
includes three main components: conversion rate (tconv), 
communication time (tcomm) and calculations time (tcalc) [13]. 
The digital multiplexer does not introduce any additional 
error. However, the VFCs still do it. So, the solution with 
minimum 
possible 
hardware 
and 
high 
metrological 
performance is possible if instead of analog sensors to use 
quasi-digital sensors. 
C. 
Sensor node architecture for quasi-digital sensors 
A low-cost sensor node with high metrological 
performance for quasi-digital sensors and transducers is 
shown in Figure 4, which addresses the challenges of 
metrological performance improvement and  node's cost 
reduction [4, 7, 13]. In this sensor node architecture no any 
VFC is necessary. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Low cost sensor node for qusi-digital sensors. 
By this way it is possible to decrease the total 
measurement error, for example, from 0.14 % to 0.08 % (for 
the numerical example, described in [13]), and reduce the 
sensor node's price. For example, at the same price for 
analog and quasi-digital sensors, the core of sensor node - 
the 24-bit resolution, 8-channel ADC ADS1278 [15] costs 
23.95 $ US (in quantities of 1,000) while the USTI IC with 
significantly better metrological performance and a digital  
8-channel multiplexer costs only 18.95 $ US in the same 
quantities.  
The space division and combining channeling also can be 
realized in this sensor node. In such sensor node instead of 
one USTI and the n-channel digital multiplexer, n ICs 
(according to the number of channels) and a microprocessor 
system with n inputs are used. That is, for simultaneous 
measurement of several frequencies, there is an independent 
channel with the USTI. The microprocessor simultaneously 
starts all converters and at the end of the measurement 
processes reads results. Quasi-digital sensors and transducers 
can be also connected in pairs to one USTI. In addition, one 
resistive, capacitive of resistive bridge sensing element can 
be also connected directly to the USTI. For one's turn, all 
USTI can be connected to a master microcontroller or 
microprocessor with the help of SPI or I2C buses. Each 
USTI IC can serves up to 3 channels by itself in a sensor 
node. 
The cycle polling time  for the space-division 
channeling is decreased approximately in k times in 
comparison with the time-division channeling and should be 
calculated as:

= Tmeas + treadout, 
(3) 
 
where treadout, is the time for result reading by a 
microprocessor. 
In the case of analog sensors, an addition VFC in each 
channel should be also used. Such solution lets achieve 
maximum possible speed at a little bit increased cost for a 
sensor node. 
Another benefit to use quasi-digital sensors and 
transducers instead of analog sensors in WSN is a possibility 
to transmit frequency-time signals without preliminary 
conversion to digital. Two examples are described below. 
The RF transmitter using pulse width modulation (PWM) 
method is reported in [16]. It does not use an analog to 
digital converter for the RF transmission of analog data. The 
transmitter consists of a pulse width modulator, a voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO) and on-chip antenna. The PWM 
method digitally encodes analog signal levels, but the PWM 
signal remains quasi-digital. By keeping the signal quasi--
digital, noise effects are minimized. The modulated signals 
are inputted into the VCO using PWM. If the voltage of the 
modulated signal is the high level, the VCO is oscillated, and 
the RF carrier waves for transmission can be obtained. Then, 
the output of the VCO is transmitted by the on-chip antenna 
[16]. The transmitter was possible to transmit with low 
power dissipation of 0.75 mW the carrier of 315 MHz. 
An interdigital capacitor based battery-free wireless 
pressure sensor is described in [17]. It consists of an 
interdigital capacitor (IDC) that serves as a pressure sensing 
element and an inductor, which works as a passive power 
source and data communication element. These two 
components work together as an LC resonator to realize the 
wireless pressure sensing and remote power to eliminate the 
need for wire connection in conventional pressure sensor. 
The sensing element is comprised of a set of linear parallel 
electrodes coated with Polyvinylidene Fluoride pressure 
sensing material on the top. The change of capacitance in the 
IDC is a function of the geometry of the electrodes and the 
electric properties of the sensitive layer. The sensor 
prototype demonstrated that it performs well in the range of 
0 psi to 60 psi with an average pressure sensitivity of  
25 kHz/psi [17]. 
III. 
NODE-ON-CHIP 
The future step to reduce hardware expenses is to use the 
recently designed IC USTI-WSN of node-on-chip instead of 
the USTI IC and C [13]. The USTI-WSN IC contains all 
sensor node's sub-systems (see Figure 5). The USTI-WSN 
IC prototype is shown in Figure 6. 
The prototype can work with two various quasi-digital 
sensors or transducers and one sensing element at the same 
time. It has a high speed embedded transmitter with high 
data rate transceiver for the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The radio 
transceiver provides high data rates from 250 kb/s up to  
2 Mb/s for wireless communications and provides frame 
handling, outstanding receiver sensitivity and high transmit

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
The USTI IC has been tested with various quasi-digital 
temperature, humidity, acceleration, light, displacement, etc. 
sensors with frequency, period, duty-cycle and PWM 
outputs, and sensing elements such as resistive, capacitive 
and resistive bridges. The maximal possible input frequency 
of a square waveform pulse signal for the USTI was 9.1 
MHz without prescaling, the minimal possible frequency 
was 0.04 Hz. The IC was programmed to measure frequency 
with the minimal possible relative error x=0.0005 %. 
Experimental results of measurements for 9 MHz and  
0.05 Hz frequencies square waveform pulse signals are 
shown in Figure 7 (a) and 7 (b) respectively. 
Before measurements, the USTI was calibrated in the 
working temperature range: +23.5 oC … + 25.4 oC with the 
purpose to compensate the quartz oscillator’s systematic 
error [18]. The statistical characteristics are presented in 
Table I. 
As it is visible from the table, the maximal relative error 
does not exceed the programmable x <  0.0005 % in all 
frequency range including high and infralow frequencies.

The absolute and relative errors for infralow frequency

between observed data in the histograms and the theoretical

At probability P = 97 %, and 5 equidistant classes (k=5), 
the hypothesis of Gaussian distribution law can be accepted 
for all sets of measurement data because of S < 2
max, where  
S = 1.7593 is the sum of deviations between the dataset and 
the assumed distribution; S < 2
max = 7 is the maximum 
possible allowable deviation in the 2 distribution. Hence, 
the hypothesis of normal (Gaussian) distribution can be 
accepted. 
Experimental results confirmed high metrological 
performances and justified, that the USTI IC can be used 
with all quasi-digital sensors existing on the modern market 
[6]. The comparative analyze of proposed solution for sensor 
nodes and convenient solution described in [4] is shown in 
Table II. 
The comparative metrological and technical performance 
of proposed solution and wireless module T24-PA available 
on the market [5] are shown in Table III. As it is visible from 
this table the wireless sensor node based on the USTI IC has 
significantly better metrological performance. In addition, 
the USTI IC has much wider functionalities and can work 
not only with frequency and period output sensors but also 
with any duty-cycle, pulse-width modulated, phase-shift, 
time interval, pulse number output sensors and transducers.  
The further reduction of power consumption will be able 
due to the use of advanced method for frequency-to-digital 
converter with non-redundant, programmable reference 
frequency [20]. It will allow to change accuracy for power 
consumption and opposite dependent on sensor node's 
activity, measuring algorithm and available power.

CONCLUSIONS 
The proposed sensor node architectures and design 
approach are suitable for any quasi-digital sensors and 
transducers. It is based on the designed USTI IC, which lets 
to achieve high metrological performances at relatively low 
cost, and get robust solution, less sensitive for various 
interferences, noises and distortions. Due to the USTI's broad 
frequency range of input signals and constant quantization 
error, it is not necessary to convert the different sensor 
output ranges into the same frequency range. The proposed 
sensor node architectures can also work with analog sensors. 
In this case the output voltage must be preliminary converted 
to the frequency with the help of voltage-to-frequency 
converter. In addition, the advanced, modified method of the 
dependent count for frequency measurements provides the 
best tradeoff between accuracy and operation time, giving a 
relative error less than ±0.0005 % at 0.32 s conversion time 
or ±1 % at 0.00016 s conversion time respectively. 
The USTI IC is available on the market since 2011 from 
the Technology Assistance BCNA 2010 S. L., Spain. The 
USTI-WSN IC will be introduced on the market in 2013-
2014.
