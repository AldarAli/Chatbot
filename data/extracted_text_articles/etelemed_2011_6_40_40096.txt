Abstract—Pediatric 
diabetes 
is 
an 
increasingly prevalent public health problem, 
especially among low-income and minority 
populations. 
In 
an 
effort 
to 
address 
disparities in care management among inner-
city adolescents with diabetes, the Visiting 
Nurse Service of New York developed a two-
year intervention program that combines 
structured education and lifestyle visits by a 
diabetes educator with a mobile technology 
application. This paper provides an overview 
of the program and describes the design of an 
evaluation study to assess outcomes among 
clients who complete the program. The 
evaluation study employs data collected 
through the mobile technology devices and a 
clinical website portal where the diabetes 
educator records demographic information, 
clinical 
characteristics, 
and 
service 
utilization.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
An increasing number of children are 
diagnosed with diabetes each year [1]. This 
trend is especially notable in low-income and 
minority 
populations, 
among 
whom 
hospitalization rates for adverse diabetic events 
are very high [2]. In an effort to address 
disparities 
in 
effective 
diabetes 
self-
management, the Visiting Nurse Service of New 
York (VNSNY), the largest not-for-profit home 
health care agency in the United States, 
developed a home-based care management 
program 
for 
inner-city 
adolescents 
with 
diabetes. The program focuses on behavior 
modification and is facilitated by trained 
clinicians 
educated 
in 
diabetes 
care 
management. The program is enhanced by a 
mobile technology application and clinical 
website developed to provide feedback to 
patients and clinicians. This paper provides an 
overview of the program and information about 
the mobile technology application, and presents 
preliminary data from an evaluation designed to 
monitor program activities and assess outcomes 
among patients who complete the two-year 
program.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW  
 
The Diabetes Care Management (DCM) 
program targets inner city adolescents with

uncontrolled diabetes for a comprehensive 
intervention. On a pilot basis, approximately 50 
patients will be recruited from two local health 
care providers that specialize in treating 
pediatric 
diabetes. 
The 
program 
enrolls 
adolescents 11-17 years old who are residents of 
the Bronx or Upper Manhattan and have Type 1 
diabetes with an HbA1c level greater than 8.0% 
in the past six months. Patients are ineligible if 
they do not speak English or Spanish, are 
pregnant, show signs of or are being treated for 
substance abuse, are under mental health care 
for psychosis or schizophrenia, or live in an un-
safe home environment. 
Patients enrolled in the DCM program receive 
home visits provided by a Certified Diabetes 
Educator (CDE). The CDE assesses patients’ 
clinical stability and acuity (e.g., blood glucose), 
describes the program to patients and attains 
their informed consent, conducts clinical and 
environmental 
assessments, 
and 
provides 
structured education to patients about their 
diabetes. The CDE or Care Manager (a social 
worker trained in behavioral management) also 
visits patients to counsel them and their family 
on making sustainable lifestyle changes. These 
visits are made to patients in their homes 12 
times during the first year, and are followed by 
12 phone calls over the course of the second 
year. 
 
III. USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE 
PEDIATRIC DIABETES CARE 
 
The DCM program utilizes a cell phone-based 
diabetes management software system and a 
web-based clinical portal. These tools, designed 
by WellDocTM Communications [3], provide an 
interactive platform for patients and providers to 
receive 
real-time 
diabetes 
management 
information. 
During 
the 
DCM 
program 
development phase, this mobile application was 
customized for a pediatric population.  
Patients enrolled in the program receive a 
Blackberry 
cell-phone 
equipped 
with 
the 
WellDocTM diabetes software. The phone 
includes a plan with phone services and 
unlimited text messaging. Patients receive 
individual instruction on how to use the phone 
and features of the application.  
 
IV. PROGRAM EVALUATION AIMS 
 
An evaluation is underway to understand 
challenges to implementing program elements 
and to provide an initial assessment of the 
impact of the program on clinical and 
behavioral outcomes. The evaluation has two 
primary aims. The first aim includes monitoring 
the process of providing care and instruction to 
patients who enroll in the program and 
summarizing the performance of key program 
activities and outputs (e.g., the number of visits 
and phone calls to patients among each type of 
care provider, program attrition, usage of the 
mobile technology application, achievement of 
targeted program objectives). The second aim 
involves assessing the impact of program 
participation 
on 
clinical 
and 
behavioral 
outcomes (e.g. A1c, diabetes knowledge and 
self-care activities). 
 
V. 
DATA AND MEASURES 
 
Data collected from the mobile diabetes 
application is stored in a central database 
maintained by WellDocTM. The database also 
includes demographic, behavioral, and clinical 
information entered into the web-based clinician 
portal. The complete database is then transmitted 
to VNSNY in a secure format on a monthly basis 
and transformed on-site for statistical analysis.  
Demographic measures that are collected at 
baseline 
include 
age, 
sex, 
race/ethnicity, 
language, and level of education. Clinical 
measures that are collected at baseline and at 
three 
month 
intervals 
include 
A1c, 
hospitalizations and emergency visits, and 
hypoglycemic 
and 
hyperglycemic 
events, 
Behavioral measures collected at baseline and at 
six-month intervals include patient self-care 
practices, willingness to change [4], diabetes 
knowledge [5], quality of life [6], and depression 
[7].

VI. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL 
CHARACTERISTICS 
 
The program has enrolled approximately 30 
patients between February and September 2010. 
The demographic and clinical characteristics of 
patients who are currently enrolled in the 
program are presented in Table 1. The average 
baseline A1c of patients currently enrolled in 
the program is 11.6, which is substantially 
higher than the target recommended by the 
American Diabetes Association (A1c < 7.0%) 
[8].

VII. SUMMARY 
 
The DCM program aims to improve self-care 
management among inner city adolescents 
with diabetes through a combination of 
mobile technology and structured clinical 
education and support. The use of the 
WellDocTM application and clinical website 
portal has enabled VNSNY to gather a broad 
range of data on patients for program 
evaluation purposes. When completed, the 
evaluation will produce useful information for 
program stakeholders and provide an initial 
assessment 
of 
the 
program’s 
clinical 
effectiveness. An analysis of the evaluation 
data will also indicate whether the mobile 
application is a popular mechanism for 
sending 
and 
receiving 
diabetes-related 
information and feedback to a pediatric 
population.
