Abstract—The aim of this research is to develop a sound 
methodology enabling the profiling of coachees that are being 
supported by a lifestyle coach. This profiling is to be useful for 
the professional coaches to personalize their approach for 
helping people acquire and maintain a healthier lifestyle. For 
the coachee profiling, the known relevant factors for a healthy 
lifestyle are gathered, e.g., sleep duration and activity level. 
Based on coachee input in a questionnaire, to be filled in with 
support of the coach, a qualitative profile is generated in terms 
of food and liquids consumption, physical activity, personality 
and cardiovascular risk. The modeling and reasoning 
environment is realized with semantic technologies. We find 
that semantic technology is an efficient technology for 
performing user profiling in a digital coaching context.

 INTRODUCTION  
This research has been performed within a large 
ARTEMIS EU project WITH-ME [18], which aims to 
provide a digital coaching platform that continuously 
monitors, advises and interacts with coachees to help them 
acquire and maintain a healthier lifestyle. To reduce the 
variability of coachees, an initial coachee profile is 
constructed, based on answers to a questionnaire that is filled 
in by the coachee, together with a personal coach during the 
first coaching session. The part of the WITH-ME platform 
that generates an initial coachee profile is technically 
realized as an ontological model with a reasoning layer. This 
initial profile is used by the coach to determine the best 
strategy for helping the coachee acquire and maintain a 
healthier lifestyle. 
Ontologies have been proven to be effective means for 
modeling user context [1]. Ontologies model concepts and 
relationships in a high level of abstraction, providing rich 
semantics for humans to work with and the required 
formalism for computers to perform mechanical processing 
and reasoning. 
Using an ontology to model a user profile has already 
been proposed in various applications like web search [9], 
[12] and personal information management [7]. Up to this 
point, ontologies modeling user profiles are application-
specific. Namely, each one has been created specifically for 
a particular domain. Taking into account the continuing 
incorporation of ontologies in new applications, there is an 
emerging need for a standard ontology to model user 
profiles. Such a standard ontology would facilitate the 
communication between applications and will serve as a 
reference point when profiling functionalities need to be 
developed. 
In this work, however, we present an ontology for 
modeling coachee profiles in the domain of medical services 
including a variety of areas such as patient care, clinical and 
administrative decisions, assisting devices and patient 
diagnostics. The developed ontology will be put to use in a 
web-based software application that accepts input data from 
a form-based interface and then presents a coachee profile in 
the field of healthcare. The ontology development process 
starts with the requirements analysis phase where concepts, 
attributes, relationships and axioms are identified. In the 
design phase, a consistent conceptual model is defined over 
a set of tasks, which increases the complexity of the 
ontology step by step. In the development phase, a suitable 
ontological language is used to formalize the ontology, 
which can help to update the ontology according to the 
domain concepts in the maintenance phase.  
In the remainder of this paper, we first discuss related 
work for applying ontologies in the medical domain 
(Section II). Then, we discuss a number of practical issues 
one can encounter during the creation of an ontology 
(Section III). Finally, we describe the software and results in 
some detail (Section IV). The paper ends with a conclusion 
(Section V). 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Generally, an ontology is defined as a formal, explicit 
specification of a shared conceptualization [13]. An ontology 
describes the concepts and relationships that are important in 
a particular domain, providing a vocabulary for that domain 
as well as a computerized specification of the meaning of 
terms used in the vocabulary [13]. The aim of an ontology is 
to formalize domain knowledge in a generic way and to 
provide a common understanding of a domain, which may be 
used and shared by applications and groups. An ontology is 
also an emerging technology for knowledge representation 
[14], with applications for reasoning to infer new knowledge, 
and with applications for data integration [15]. 
An ontology consists of classes, properties and 
individuals. A class defines a concept; individuals realize a 
class; individuals are linked to each other via properties; 
individuals are linked to data values via properties. The use

of the term “individual” might seem confusing, since in 
natural language, it refers to a person. However, in the 
remainder of this paper, we will use “individual” consistently 
to refer to an instantiation of a class in an ontology. 
Ontological technology has been widely adopted in the 
business and scientific communities as a way to share, reuse 
and process domain knowledge. Ontological technology is 
also central to many applications in fields including 
information management, systems integration and semantic 
web services [16]. Many studies have also demonstrated that 
ontologies are essential for the development of knowledge-
oriented systems. 
The most widely used terminology resources in the 
biomedical domain are the Gene Ontology and the Unified 
Medical Language System. The Gene Ontology (GO) project 
[19] is a collaborative effort to address two aspects of 
information integration in several domains of molecular and 
cellular biology. Namely, the GO project provides consistent 
descriptors for gene products in different databases and 
standardizes classifications for sequences and sequence 
features. The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 
[21] is maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine 
in order to facilitate the development of computer systems in 
the field of biomedicine and health. The UMLS consists of 
files and software that bring together many health and 
biomedical 
vocabularies 
and 
standards 
to 
enable 
interoperability between computer systems. 
Huang et al. [4] developed a medical ontology to serve as 
the foundation for an intelligent Chinese Medical Diagnostic 
System (CMDS), which acts as a human expert to diagnose a 
number 
of 
digestive 
system 
conditions 
including 
stomachache, vomiting, hiccups, diaphragmatitis, diarrhea, 
dysentery, constipation, jaundice, tympanites, etc. In [5], 
Bouamrane et al. presented the design and implementation of 
an ontological knowledge-based pre-operative assessment 
support system, which is a generic clinical screening process, 
intended to identify early in a patient’s journey the potential 
risk of complications during or after surgery. Juarez et al. 
proposed in [13] an ontology-based medical knowledge base 
called the Causal and Temporal Knowledge Acquisition 
(CATEKAT2), which provides physicians with a broad 
spectrum of medical knowledge. Kola et al. developed an 
ontological knowledge base to drive an Occupational Health 
Application (OCHWIZ), which provides suggestions as to 
possible causes and industries associated with a given 
clinical finding related to a specific occupation [15]. Based 
on these suggestions, it is also capable of inferring other 
diseases and conditions to watch out for. Alexandrou et al. 
described an ontological software platform SEMPATH, 
which can offer personalized treatment plans by using and 
managing health care business processes (clinical pathways) 
[14]. During the execution of clinical pathways, the system 
considers the patient’s clinical status and reaction to the 
treatment scheme according to the Semantic Web Rule 
Language (SWRL) [29] rules in reconfiguring the next 
treatment steps.  
Other important works with clinical relevance are 
SNOMED Clinical Terms (CT) [22] and ISO/EN 13606 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) communication paradigm 
[23]. SNOMED CT [20] provides a consistent information 
interchange and is fundamental to an interoperable electronic 
health record. It allows a consistent way to index, store, 
retrieve, and aggregate clinical data across specialties and 
sites of care. It also helps in organizing the content of EHR 
systems by reducing the variability in the way data is 
captured, encoded and used for clinical care of patients and 
research. EHR Archetypes are formal and standardized 
specifications for the representation and organization of 
clinical information inside electronic health records. ISO/EN 
13606-2 incorporates the “openEHR” archetype approach as 
a 
standard 
information 
model, 
and 
an 
exchange 
representation, for the communication of electronic health 
record archetypes [23].

ONTOLOGY CREATION ISSUES 
A. Application Context 
The goal of this research is to develop an application 
capable of generating a complete and qualitative lifestyle 
profile based on the input of a coachee. An initial ontology 
model together with the reasoning layer implemented in 
SWRL has been conceived and validated as a part of the 
Master Thesis work of Sara Mikolajczak at the KU Leuven, 
Belgium.  
Lifestyle can be modelled taking into account different 
aspects, e.g., eating and drinking habits like calorie and 
nutrient intake, activity levels, body and weight levels like 
BMI (Body Mass Index), WC (Waist Circumference) and 
WHR (Waist-Hip Ratio), levels of motivation and levels of 
general (un)healthy habits (risk factors) like smoking and 
sleeping habits.  
To collect the relevant factors that influence a healthy 
lifestyle, an extensive study of the literature [16][17] has 
been performed as part of a master thesis. From this 
literature study, important life style areas have been 
extracted with relevant data, such as boundary values and 
possible conditions that may be the consequence of 
exceeding these boundaries. These data have been used in 
the construction of the coachee profile. 
For some areas, it was not possible to find scientifically 
validated specifications of the boundary values. In this case, 
non-scientific values were used to provide a full proof-of-
concept implementation. Therefore, further research is 
required to refine these values in order to provide a correct 
and justified tool to the coach and coachee.  
B. Definition 
An ontology is a “hierarchal structuring of knowledge 
about concepts by sub-classing them according to their 
properties and qualities” [6]. It can also be defined as “a 
declarative model of a domain that defines and represents 
the concepts existing in that domain, their attributes and the 
relationships between them” [2][6]. Thus, our lifestyle 
ontology gives a formalization of concepts (e.g., person, 
habit, motivation) in their respective classes (e.g., Person, 
Habit, Motivation) and the relations (e.g., is a Person, has a 
80

Habit, has a Motivation) that can exist between them. A 
correct definition of classes is very important for data 
sharing and knowledge representation.  
C. Classification 
Ontologies can be classified according to the level of 
detailed knowledge they provide. Upper ontologies provide 
very generic knowledge with low domain specific 
knowledge. For example, a disease ontology is an upper 
ontology compatible for any biomedical domain. General 
ontologies represent knowledge at an intermediate level of 
detail independently of a specific task. Domain ontologies 
represent knowledge about a particular part of the world, 
such as medicine, and should reflect the underlying reality 
through a theory of the represented domain. Finally, 
ontologies designed for specific tasks are called application 
ontologies. 
D. Description 
We have defined an ontology as a specification and 
formalization of concepts and relations between them. The 
domain concepts are represented by “classes”. The features 
of a concept are described by “properties”. These properties 
can be either relationships between classes, or data values of 
“individuals”, which are the instantiations of a class. 
Together with these “individuals”, this is what constitutes 
the domain knowledge base. 
Classes are the main focus in an ontology. Classes can 
be sub-classed to describe more specific features of a class. 
For example, if we define a class Habit, it includes all the 
habit classes in the habit domain. The Habit class can be 
sub-classed 
to 
specify 
more 
specific 
habits 
like 
ConsumptionHabit or SleepingHabit. 
Properties can be created to describe properties of a class 
or individual. For example, we can define a property of a 
class named “hasSleepingHabit”, which connects a Habit 
Class to the SleepingHabit class. An individual that 
instantiates the SleepingHabit class can have a property 
sleepingHabit, which holds a data value that gives the 
amount of hours somebody typically sleeps. We can also 
mention that it is possible to store a data value range as a 
property of an individual, e.g., sleepingHabit could contain 
a range of the amount of hours somebody sleeps. Moreover, 
fuzzy logic reasoners can be applied to optimally leverage 
the concept of a range. 
Figure 1 shows a summary of the above discussion. The 
description of an ontology domain includes [3]: 
 
The definition of a concept in the domain as 
classes. 
 
The definition of an instantiation of the class as 
individuals. 
 
The definition of attributes of classes or individuals 
as properties. 
E. Ontology structure 
The ontology model contains three ontologies in layers: 
a Core Ontology Layer, a Profiling Ontology Layer and a 
Reasoning Ontology Layer. They are depicted in Figure 2. 
1. Core ontology – is the main ontology, which 
contains the classes and properties. It also contains a 
Standard_Profile, which is an individual that 
contains the boundary values that were recorded 
during the literature review phase. 
2. Profiling ontology – contains multiple individuals 
that describe different parts of the final coachee 
profile. The final coachee profile is divided into an 
“eating and drinking profile”, a “motivation 
profile”, a “physical profile” and a “health profile”. 
These four aspects are discussed in some more 
detail below. 
3. Reasoning ontology – This layer contains the 
individuals that are to be populated with coachee 
data. 
 
 
Figure 1: The amount of hours that a coachee habitually 
sleeps is stored in the ontology. 
 
 
Figure 2: Ontology structure. 
 
Below, we discuss in some more detail the four aspects of 
the Profiling ontology layer: 
Eating and Drinking Profile - In this part of the 
ontology, the daily consumed food is evaluated. The 
evaluation of calorie intake is based on the daily calorie 
requirement (DCR), which in turn is based on the activity 
level in combination with the basal metabolic rate (BMR). 
The evaluation of protein, fat and carbohydrate intake is 
based on the recommended rate of each nutrient in the total 
amount of calories.

Motivation profile - Based on answers given on a 
list of multiple choice questions, the coachee receives a 
score for being intrinsically and extrinsically motivated. The 
reasoner evaluates these scores and returns an optimal 
approach for motivating the coachee.  
Physical profile - The physical profile is further 
split into two parts: the first part concerns the body 
profiling, the second part the activity profiling. The body 
profile consists of a body mass index level, a waist-hip ratio 
level and a waist circumference level. These levels indicate 
a risk for a cardiovascular disease, given a certain BMI, 
WHR and WC. The activity profile contains five activity 
levels going from "sedentary" to "extremely active". The 
assignment of an activity level to a coachee is based on the 
her job(s), hobbies and means of transportation.  
Health profile - In this part of the ontology, the 
sleeping and smoking habits are modeled. The optimal daily 
number of hours of sleep is defined according to certain age 
categories, e.g., the optimal number of daily hours of sleep 
for younger people is higher than for older people. The 
smoking habit class is defined by the daily amount of 
tobacco products being consumed.  
F. Rules  
Two formalization approaches for expressing rules have 
been investigated in this paper. First, the Semantic Web 
Rule Language (SWRL) can be used to create rules in an 
ontology. The SWRL is a proposed language for the 
Semantic Web that can be used to express rules as well as 
logic by combining Web Ontology Language (OWL) 
Description Logic (DL) or OWL Lite with a subset of the 
Rule Markup Language. Second, rules can also be 
implemented in the format specific for Apache Jena [28], 
which is a Java-oriented system for handling ontologies. 
Jena provides an Application Programming Interface (API) 
to extract data from and to write to Resource Description 
Framework (RDF) [24] graphs. Since the syntax of Jena 
rules is more readable, and since these rules can be more 
easily integrated in a software production environment, we 
preferred the Jena approach over the SWRL approach. 
One can see below a rule that is written in Jena syntax. 
This rule calculates the DCR of a coachee. DCR is the 
amount of calories the coachee should eat in a day to 
maintain her current weight at the current height and age. It 
is calculated based on the coachee’s level of Basic 
Metabolic Rate (BMR) and how active the coachee is: 
 
[DCR: 
 
(?p rdf:type core:Person) 
 
(?p physical:hasActivityProfile ?activityProfile) 
 
(?activityProfile physical:activityValue ?activityValue) 
 
(?p core:hasExternalExaminationResult ?BMRCalc) 
 
(?BMRCalc core:examinationType 'BMR') 
 
(?BMRCalc core:externalValue ?BMR) 
 
product(?activityValue, ?BMR, ?DCR) 
 
(?p core:hasExternalExaminationResult ?DCRCalc) 
 
(?DCRCalc core:examinationType 'DCR') 
 
-> (?DCRCalc core:externalValue ?DCR) 
] 
IV. 
DESCRIPTION OF SOFTWARE AND RESULTS 
The software implementation that we used to build a 
proof-of-concept for the WITH-ME project [18] adopts a 
decoupled architecture, where the evaluation of the data 
values by the ontology and its rules is strictly separated 
from the web-based interface. These two components 
communicate via a so-called messaging system, where the 
output of the first component (the interface) becomes the 
input for the second component (the ontology and rules). 
The web interface contains a number of questions that 
need to be filled in, some of which are depicted in Figure 3.  
The decoupled architecture of the web-based software 
requires that the data, i.e. answers to the questionnaire, from 
the web-based interface is communicated to the separated 
ontology processing backend. To communicate between 
these two components, a shared message format is used, i.e. 
Java Script Object Notation (JSON) [25]. JSON is a 
lightweight data-interchange format, that is easily readable 
for humans, and easily generated and parsed by machines. 
The messaging system that is being used in WITH ME is 
Microsoft Azure Service Bus [26]. 
 
 
Figure 3: A screenshot of the web-based questionnaire 
interface. 
 
The collected personal data are sent to the backend, 
which consists of a Apache Jena implementation around the 
ontology. The backend accepts the input data and stores 
them as properties in the appropriate individuals of the 
ontology model. A Pellet reasoner [27] is then used in the 
developed system. Pellet is an open-source Java-based 
OWL 2 reasoner. The Pellet reasoner analyzes the received 
data from the web system and generates newly inferred data. 
The inferred data together make up the coachee profile. The 
output of the backend is again a JSON message, which is

being submitted to the messaging system. From there, it can 
be picked up by another decoupled component that could, as 
an example, generate visualizations of the coachee profile. 
The proposed profiler will be evaluated on multiple 
coachees during the pilot phase of the WITH ME project, 
starting September 2015. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper has presented an approach for designing a 
semantic reasoning engine for coachee profiling. An 
ontological approach to knowledge representation in 
healthcare has been selected in the coachee profile design.  
The developed system uses a web-based interface for 
collecting coachee data and an ontology to analyze and 
process the entered coachee data. Тhe performed analysis 
generates a coachee profile as a result. This profile can be 
used to optimize the coaching activities of a professional 
lifestyle coach, or as a basis for the creation of other 
software applications that expand the applicability of the 
developed one. For the former, an example is that a 
professional lifestyle coach can choose a motivational style 
on the basis of the motivation profile that is generated by the 
profiler. For the latter, an example is that a software 
application can use the profile to automatically recommend 
objectives to the coachee, on the basis of objectives of other 
coachees with similar user profiles.
