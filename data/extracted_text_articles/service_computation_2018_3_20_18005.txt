Abstract— The applications available on the Internet can 
generally be divided into three categories: audio, video and 
data. This has given rise to the popular term Triple Play 
Services. Quality of Service is currently especially important in 
digital networks and can now be measured in two ways: 
subjective techniques and objective techniques. This paper 
elaborates on the most important techniques for measuring 
Quality of Experience (QoE) and Quality of Service (QoS) in 
Triple Play Services, comparing the most widely used QoE and 
QoS measurement methods in several series of analyses.

INTRODUCTION 
In modern digital networks, it is not difficult to identify 
three parties: network providers, service providers, and users. 
All three parties have a common interest: Quality of Service 
(QoS). When the quality of service in networks is there, 
everybody is happy. In order to be sure that quality of service 
is being delivered, QoS measurements must be constantly 
made, and should the quality of service fall for any reason, 
countermeasures must be taken immediately. Preventive 
measures are, of course, preferable to corrective measures, 
and monitoring is best done unobtrusively in the background 
and fully automatically (cf. Figure 1).  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  The three parties in digital networks. 
In order to determine the QoS/QoE in a network, two 
models are generally used: a) the dual-ended model and b) 
the single-ended model [1]. In the case of the dual-ended 
model, two signals are used: a) the original signal and b) the 
degraded 
signal. 
These 
two 
signals 
are 
available 
uncompressed. For this reason, measurements can be carried 
out for both Quality of Experience (QoE, a subjective 
evaluation) and Quality of Service (QoS, an objective 
evaluation). In the case of the single-ended model, only the 
impaired signal (compressed) is available. This allows 
normally only an objective evaluation of QoS to be made 
(exception ITU-T P.563 [2]). 
Two measurement techniques can be used in the two 
models cited: a) signal-based and b) parameter-based 
measurement. The dual-ended model uses specialised 
algorithms to compare the input and output signals of signal-
based measurements. In the case of the single-ended model 
this comparison is not possible. In this case, the QoS will be 
determined by using the degraded signal only. In both cases, 
the system to be assessed is treated as a “black box”. When 
carrying out parameter-based measurements, a distinction is 
made between two types: a) “glass-box” and b) “black-box”. 
In the first case, both the structure of the system to be 
assessed and the reaction of the individual system 
components to the reference signal are known. This 
knowledge is then taken into consideration in a suitable 
model. Additionally, the network parameters measured can 
be included in the calculation of the QoS. In the second case, 
not all details of the system to be assessed are known, so 
only the measured network parameters and the characteristic 
parameters for the respective service are taken into account. 
QoE refers to the appraisal of quality by test persons—
the end users. It is an extremely complicated method: among 
other things it relies on reference signals that have been 
specially recorded in sound and video studios. The room, 
too, in which the audio and video tests are conducted, must 
also be specially designed. Even the selection of the test 
persons proves to be problematic. To achieve any reliable 
results at all series upon series of tests must be run. This 
understandably takes a lot of time and involves a lot of 
specialised equipment. The method is therefore fully 
unsuitable for analyses of quality in real networks. That is

why great efforts have been made to simulate the human eye 
and the human ear with electronic means and to incorporate 
those simulations in QoE algorithms. 
QoS works on the principle of parametrised models. 
Naturally, test persons had to be involved during the 
development stage of the models, which was costly, time-
consuming and elaborate. Once developed, however, QoS 
models can be used quickly and without the need for test 
persons in real environments to evaluate all manner of 
electronic service. This is the great benefit of using 
parametrised QoS models and the reason why they were 
developed.  
This paper will review and discuss the application of 
common QoE/QoS measuring methods to Triple Play 
Services (audio/video/data).  
In Section II, the QoE/QoS in the VoIP service (audio) 
will be described. Section III provides information about 
QoE/QoS in the VSoIP service (video). Following that, 
Section IV discusses QoE/QoS in the WWW service (data). 
The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook on 
future work. 
II. 
QOE AND QOS IN THE VOIP SERVICE 
The most widely used QoE measurement techniques for 
the VoIP service are currently PESQ [3] and POLQA [4]. 
Both techniques are very accurate; they are, however, time-
consuming and can often only be implemented with a 
licence. Both algorithms incorporate an electronic emulation 
of the human ear, so it is permissible here to speak of QoE 
values. 
The most widely used QoS measurement techniques for 
the VoIP service are currently the E Model [5] and E(IP) 
Model [6]. Both of them are parametrised models. They are 
very practical: easy to use and time-saving. They do not need 
reference signals, which is a great benefit in practice. But 
how good are parametrised models in comparison with QoE 
measurement techniques?  
To answer this question several analyses were conducted 
during the course of the work presented in this paper, using 
the numerical tool QoSCalc(VoIP) [7] (see there also the 
setting parameters for investigations). Figure 2 shows some 
quite representative results. 
 
 
Figure 2.  QoE/QoS values as a function of packet loss for different 
measurement techniques (codec iLBC). 
It is evident that the curves from the PESQ algorithm and 
the E(IP) Model agree whilst the curve for the E Model 
deviates significantly. The E Model is unsuitable for 
analyses in an IP environment. The study has confirmed that 
with a suitable parametrised QoS model values can be 
achieved that come very close to QoE values. This is of 
substantial practical benefit! 
III. 
QOE AND QOS IN THE VSOIP SERVICE 
The most widely used QoE measurement techniques for 
the VSoIP service are currently PEVQ (J.247) [8] and 
VQuad-HD (J.341) [9]. These techniques are very accurate; 
they are, however, time-consuming and can often only be 
implemented with a licence. Both algorithms incorporate an 
electronic emulation of the human eye and so one can 
justifiably speak of QoE values. 
The most widely used QoS measurement techniques for 
the VSoIP service are currently Rec. ETSI 101 290 [10] and 
the VSoIP Model [11]. Both measurement techniques are 
classed as parametrised models because they work on the 
basis of network and service parameters. In practice, they are 
quick and easy to use. They need no reference signal, which 
is of great practical value. But how good are parametrised 
models in comparison with QoE measurement techniques? 
To answer this question several analyses were conducted 
during the course of the work described in this paper, using 
the numerical tool QoSCalc(IPTV) [12] (see there also the 
setting parameters for investigations). Figure 3 presents some 
typical results. 
 
 
Figure 3.  QoE/QoS values as a function of packet loss for different 
measurement techniques (codec H.264/720p). 
It is evident that the curves for the PEVQ algorithm and 
for 
the 
VSoIP 
Model 
concur. 
This 
demonstrates 
unequivocally that by using a suitable parametrised QoS 
model it is possible to achieve values that come very close to 
QoE values. Another great practical benefit for all involved! 
IV. 
QOS/QOE IN THE WWW SERVICE 
At present there is only one standardised technique for 
measuring QoE in the WWW service: Rec. ITU-T G.1030 
[13]. This method requires the participation of test persons 
and takes only one criterion into consideration: the web page 
51

opening time, which is actually of little practical 
significance.  
The widely used QoS measurement techniques for the 
WWW service are currently Apdex Index [14] and Power 
Metric [15]. But they have not been standardised, meaning 
that there is an enormous need for further developments in 
this area, especially in view of the fact that the WWW 
service is one of the most widely used applications in the 
Internet and accounts for the lion’s share of traffic. Here, too, 
the question arises: Just how good are the parametrised 
models in comparison with QoE measurement techniques? 
In order to answer this question, some results from 
analysis [16] (see there also the setting parameters for 
investigations) are presented here. Figure 4 shows quite 
typical results that were gained (black dots indicate the mean 
values, the rectangles the standard deviation). 
 
 
Figure 4.  QoE values as a function of web page opening time for the 
service WWW. 
It is evident that the QoE curve is subject to a logarithmic 
function [15]:

where T is the web page opening time. 
 
The parametrised QoS model (given in (1)) is so simple 
because it is contains only one system variable: web page 
opening time. In order to take further system variables into 
consideration, the metric called Power [14] must be used. It 
has been demonstrated yet again that a parametrised QoS 
model is quick and easy to use. This is of great practical 
benefit! 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper has reviewed and discussed briefly the 
application of common QoE/QoS measuring methods in 
Triple Play Services (audio/video/data). The strengths and 
weaknesses of the individual QoS/QoE measurement 
techniques have been spelt out. It has been shown that by 
using suitable parametrised QoS models values can be 
achieved that come very close to QoE values. In practice it is 
highly beneficial to work with parameterised QoS models. 
The number of electronic services in the Internet is 
increasing steadily. The philosophy behind the networks has 
changed: whereas networks have had clearly defined 
properties until recently, they are now assuming new 
properties dynamically during live operation. What effects 
will this have on the Quality of Service? Should we perhaps 
in future speak of Quality of Live (QoL) instead of Quality 
of Service (QoS)? It is a development in networks that must 
be followed at all costs. The authors are already planning 
future work in this direction.
