Abstract—In this paper, we present an outline of our livestock 
monitoring system using long range (LoRa) in a low-power 
wide-area network and evaluate the performance of our LoRa 
device for use as a livestock monitoring system. We herein 
present the purpose of the project, an evaluation of LoRa 
transmission distance on a farm, and the application of our 
results. On the basis of our evaluation of LoRa, we confirm that 
it is a feasible technology for monitoring the behavior of 
livestock, particularly cows, on large farms.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Several changes recently occurred in the methods of farm 
management in Japan. Farm size has become more extensive 
and efficient, promoting the American large-scale herd-
management method. As a result, Japanese-style breeding 
management, which is based on a relationship of trust with 
livestock, has been lost. Breeding selection has dramatically 
improved the lactation ability of cows, but it led to a decline 
in body condition and weakening of reproductive behavior, 
primarily because of the lack of energy. Accordingly, artificial 
insemination at the correct time presents difficulties; it was 
reported in U.S. that the rate of successful pregnancies of 
cattle has been reduced to roughly 30% in the late 1990s 
(which was previously 60% in the late 1970s) [1], and in Japan 
to roughly 46% in 2009 (which was previously 60% in 1989) 
[2]. As a result, the number of cows and the production of raw 
milk have decreased.  
Fine-grained, low-stress feeding management can reduce 
morbidity, increase reproductive efficiency, and improve the 
quality of raw milk. Breeding management that involves 
taking care of each animal and maximizing its individuality 
and ability can lead to the production of high-value-added 
milk. In this context, grazing is currently attracting attention 
for its ability to manage cows in a less stressful and more 
natural environment. The relationship between the production 
of high-value-added milk through pasturing and observing the 
feeding behavior of cows while grazing and the overall health 
status is not entirely clear. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
explain the design of our proposed system. Section III 
introduces related research. In Section IV, we discuss the 
long-range (LoRa) [3] technology (included in ARIB STD-
T108 in Japan [4]). In Section V, we explain an experiment 
for measuring the communication distance of LoRa in a 
different environment in detail. Finally, Section VI presents 
our research results and Section VII concludes the paper.

II. 
 SYSTEM DESIGN 
Generally, cow health must be maintained to ensure the 
production of high-quality raw milk. Fig. 1 shows the 
relationship between a cow’s health and its behavior. An 
outline of this study is presented in Fig. 2.  
To measure the effect of grazing, we set three technical 
targets as follows: 
• 
Target 1: Real-time tracking of cow-feeding 
behavior 
• 
Target 2: Real-time measurement of cow rumen pH 
levels 
• 
Target 3: Application of a machine-learning model 
to estimate the quality of raw milk 
The outline of each target is explained in the following 
subsections.  
A. Real-Time Tracking of Cow-Feeding Behavior 
Purpose: To understand the behavior of cows while 
grazing and investigate the relationship between 
this behavior and milk quality. 
Tasks: 
Develop a sensor box that can detect location (Global 
Navigation 
Satellite 
System, 
GNSS) 
and 
accelerometer data. Send the data to a server via LoRa. 
• 
The number of steps and the number of chewing 
cycles are estimated from accelerometer data. 
• 
Activity is estimated from the walking distance 
calculated using location data. 
B. Real-Time Measurement of Cow Rumen pH Levels  
Purpose: To understand the health situation of cows and 
clarify the relationship between the pH level and 
the quality of raw milk.  
Tasks: 
• 
Develop a pH sensor that can be used on rumen and 
that can send data external to the cow’s body. 
• 
Develop a communication system to send a pH sensor 
outside the rumen. 
C. Machine-Learning Model for Estimating the Quality of 
Raw Milk 
Purpose: To estimate the quality of raw milk from the 
behavior and pH level of cow rumen. 
Task: 
• 
Develop a machine-learning model to estimate the 
quality of raw milk from the behavior and pH level of 
cow rumen. 
In the following two sections, related work and a technical 
outline of LoRa will be described. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
Many studies have measured the behavior of livestock. In 
[5], a method was introduced to track the movement of cows 
using a black-and-white pattern of the surface of a cow house. 
In [6], a location-detection technique in a cow house using 
ultrawideband and tags was presented. In [7], a technique for 
observing the cow-feeding behavior using an accelerometer in 
a cow house was addressed. All of these technologies focus 
on the use of a cow house. 
In [8], a technique for monitoring locomotion and posture 
activity was presented, but no function for transmitting data to 
the server in real time was provided. The work in [9] explains 
system aspects such as nodes, gateways, and servers and is 
based on a LoRa wide-area network (LoRaWAN). However, 
in that study, no real field tests were conducted. In [10], the 
performance of LoRa and custom protocols for monitoring 
livestock was discussed; however, hypothetical situations are 
always slightly different from the conditions on a real farm.

LORA 
It is highly expected that LPWA will be used for 
communication technologies in IoT systems. This technology 
has the following features: 
• 
Low cost 
• 
Low-power consumption, except for Bluetooth 
Low Energy and ordinary near-field 
communication technologies, which require a 
generous power supply 
• 
Long-distance coverage (from several hundreds of 
meters up to several kilometers) 
• 
Connectivity to multiple devices 
• 
Transfer of small amounts of data at speeds 
ranging from 100 bps to 1 Mbps 
The most popular LPWA standard is LoRa [3]. The LoRa 
Alliance particularly defines LoRaWAN [12]. LoRa defines 
the modulation technology of the physical layer of a chip, and 
LoRaWAN also includes a media access control layer. 
Furthermore, LoRaWAN specifies the interoperability of

Low-Power Wide rea (LPWA) [11] is a type of network 
that is becoming popular for LoRa license-free wireless 
communication technologies. This type of network can 
provide news services for long-distance communication 
(from several hundreds of meters up to several kilometers) in 
rural areas. Additionally, LPWA operates at the subgigahertz 
(sub-GHz) band, which has excellent penetration. It is 
expected that LPWA will be able to provide several useful 
features for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as low 
cost, low-power consumption, long-distance communication, 
connection of a significant number of IoT devices, and small-
scale data transmission (ranging from 100 bps to 1 Mbps).

LoRa devices. LoRa employs chirp spectrum spread, thereby 
allowing long-distance communication. 
When using LoRa, two parameters must be included: 
bandwidth (BW) and spreading factor (SF). A smaller BW 
allows for communication across a longer distance, whereas 
a larger SF allows for communication over a longer distance. 
However, if we wish to achieve communication over even 
longer distances, we need to select appropriate parameters. 
The relationship between the BW and the SF of the ES920LR 
LoRa chip that we used in 2019 is described in Table I. 
V. 
EXPERIMENT 
We performed several trials to check the communication 
distance of LoRa.  
A. Locations 
In order to check the communication distance, we used 
four locations as follows:  
(1) Oku-Nikko: flat, wide forest and marsh in the Nikko 
National Park (400 ha, roughly 4 × 4 km). 
(2) Utsunomiya University Farm: flat farmland with some 
trees (50 ha, roughly 1 × 0.5 km). 
(3) Near the Engineering Department: city area with 
buildings and factories surrounding the campus area.  
(4) Ozasa Farm: one of the largest livestock farms in 
Japan (362 ha, roughly 4 × 4 km).  
B. Devices and GNSS Data 
 We developed a LoRa device using the following 
parameters. 
 In these experiments, the transmitted data, including the 
GNSS location data, were 35 bytes. According to Table I, we 
estimated that one data could be transmitted within 5 s. Fig. 3 
shows the receiver and transmitter that we used in the 
experiment conducted at Ozasa Farm, both of which used the 
same LoRa chip (ES920LR [13]). The transmitter had a GNSS 
receiver and sent location data to the receiver. 
C. Okumura-Hata Model 
The Okumura–Hata model [14][15] is an approximate 
curve used for estimating the radio-wave propagation 
characteristics of wireless devices at the development stage 
of mobile communication systems in different environments 
in open areas; suburbs; and small, medium, and large cities. 
The equations shown in Fig. 4 were used for loss calculation. 
In the experiment, we measured not only the communication 
distance but also the fitting of the Okumura–Hata model. If

the results showed a good fit with the Okumura–Hata model, 
we would be able to use that model to estimate the reach of 
LoRa. 
D. Experiments 
We started performing LoRa tests in 2018 (see [16][17]) 
under different situations (e.g., in city, forest, and farm areas), 
as described in Table II. In [16][17], we reported the LoRa test 
results for three different cases (Cases 1, 2, and 4 in Table II) 
and confirmed that the communication distance closely fit the 
Okumura–Hata model. 
We herein explain a recent experiment (December 3, 2019) 
conducted on a farmland in a mountainous area (Case 3 in 
Table II). 
As previously noted, Ozasa Farm is one of the largest 
livestock farms in Japan (362 ha). Fig. 5 shows a panoramic 
view of the farm. We set a LoRa receiver at the center of the 
farm on a tripod (at a height of roughly 2 m) and then traversed 
the farm on foot holding two LoRa transmitters. As noted in 
Section 5-B, data including the GNSS location were 
transmitted every 5 s. We used a BW of 62 and an SF of 12 to 
achieve the highest possible sensitivity. Fig. 6(a) shows the 
trace of the transmitted location, and Fig. 6(b) shows the trace 
of the received data with location. The log shows that LoRa 
was able to cover almost all areas. Table III shows the 
message-receiving rate, which was on average greater than 
80%. We believe that this result indicates that LoRa is a 
feasible measure for monitoring livestock. Fig. 7 shows fitting 
of the Okumura–Hata model with these results. The results 
show that a loss occurred between open land and suburbs but 
that the results nonetheless met the requirements for Ozasa 
Farm. The Okumura–Hata model can, therefore, be used to 
estimate the potential of LoRa in a farm environment.  
In the next step of our research, we will design sensor 
devices and a matching receiver for cows. If the transmitter 
sends data every 5 min and each data transmission requires 5 s, 
we will be able to obtain data from 60 cows using the same 
band. Each transmitter will have a GNSS device, allowing the 
scheduling of the transmission time for each cow without 
congestion. The LoRa device [13] will have 37 channels if the 
BW is narrower than 125 kHz; this will enable us to monitor 
2,220 cows at the same time. Ozasa Farm generally supports 
1,500 cows grazing on its pasture. As such, our system will be 
able to monitor them all. 
VI. 
APPLICATION OF THE RESEARCH RESULTS 
The Japanese Government is currently promoting the 
notion of Society 5.0 [18], an idea that was proposed at the 5th 
Science and Technology Basic Plan (2016–2020) for 
conducting a future Japanese society. The aim of Society 5.0 
is to achieve a high degree of convergence between 
cyberspace (virtual space) and physical (real) space. In 
Society 5.0, a significant amount of information from sensors 
in physical space is accumulated in cyberspace. In cyberspace, 
this big data is analyzed by AI, and the analyzed results are 
fed back to physical space in various forms to support society, 
business, and economics. 
An outline of Society 5.0 for agriculture is described in Fig. 
8. In order to solve problems related to agriculture and food,

AI and big-data analysis technology are used to produce 
higher-quality primary products, such as milk, meat, and rice. 
Then, these high-quality products allow smart food chain and 
smart production systems to produce high-quality secondary 
and tertiary products. In addition, robots support the primary 
agricultural industry to solve problems such as aging among 
farmers. After realizing a new style of agriculture, we expect 
developing a new business model as illustrated in Fig. 9. Once 
we can produce high-quality raw milk, we will be able to 
produce high-quality butter and cheese and, subsequently, 
flavorsome sweets and dishes. The effect of such products and 
services is expected to promote gastronomy and health 
tourism.  
The results of this research provide a potential platform for 
gathering real-time data from livestock within a wide area 
using LPWAs such as LoRa. Developing such a platform to 
gather data from sensors by LPWAs will serve as an important 
basis for reforming agriculture in a Society 5.0 context. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we introduced our research results for 
developing a monitoring system that can track the behavior of 
cows and pH levels for grazing and an AI model to estimate 
the quality of raw milk. With this research ongoing, we were 
able to explain in detail the performance of LoRa in a real 
situation. Accordingly, LoRa was able to cover the entire area 
of farmland evaluated. Furthermore, we also briefly addressed 
the broader scope of a new food chain business model based 
on the Society 5.0 context. 
We hereby plan to develop a system based on the results 
of this research in the second quarter of 2020 and to evaluate 
said system by the end of 2020.
