Abstract‚ÄîOrganizations have begun to leverage both 
internal and external sources for innovation. Specifically, 
organizations are increasingly relying on end users that 
engage via user innovation communities to identify 
potentially valuable ideas for an organization to adopt.  
However, research has shown that organizational success in 
leveraging these communities relies on a thorough 
understanding of how users behave within the community.  
The purpose of this manuscript is to provide further analysis 
and develop a richer understanding of user behavior in the 
Dell IdeaStorm user innovation community. Findings 
illustrate different patterns of user behaviors when they 
comments or rate posted ideas. 
Keywords-user innovation; open innovation; online 
community; social network analysis.

 INTRODUCTION 
Organizations have widely acknowledged the role of 
innovation in economic growth. However, not all firms are 
successful when appropriating returns from innovations.  
Consequently, research is needed to understand the 
innovation process and how organizations can increase the 
likelihood of positive gains from innovation.  According to 
[1], there are three building blocks which explain this 
phenomenon: 1) the appropriability regime, 2) the 
complementary assets, and 3) the dominant design 
paradigm. These building blocks are still central to the 
analysis of innovation in the 21st century. 
 Innovation can be divided into two primary types: 
product and process innovations. Both of them have 
traditionally taken place within the boundaries of a firm, 
and have been seen as the primary source of competitive 
advantage for organizations. This suggests the need for 
control of critical aspects of the innovation process in 
order to protect their competitive advantage. [2]. However, 
a new form of business innovation, called open innovation, 
has strongly emerged during the last years [3]. Open 
innovation means a firm opens up its boundaries to 
identify and capture innovative external ideas and 
knowledge to create value beyond the firm‚Äôs limited 
resources and capabilities [4], [5].  
Commercial firms, unlike individuals, face the 
additional problem that free revealing of its innovation 
process will benefit their competitors [6]. However, there 
are two conditions that explain why firms would expose 
themselves to such risk [7]. First, sharing may provide 
firms with valuable selective benefits, that are unavailable 
to free-riders [8], and which could be classified into 
economic (reduced production cost or enhanced value of 
complementary assets), social (improved reputation and 
image), and technological (increased network externalities 
and exploration of new technologies) [9]. Second, the 
potential negative impact of sharing may be quite low 
compared to the expected private gains. The act of 
revealing source code via the Internet is nearly costless, 
suggesting that even the prospect of minor benefits is 
sufficient to induce community participation [8]. Recent 
developments along the open innovation paradigm [4] 
suggest that firms need to reject the idea that control 
implies ownership and open themselves up to the broad 
array of resources available to the firm. To do this, 
managers must find new ways to conceptualize the ‚Äòpost- 
Chandlerian firm, where innovation proceeds along less 
hierarchical lines [10] since ‚Äúthe network of relationships 
between the firm and its external environment can play an 
important role in shaping performance‚Äù [11]. 
Based on virtual world technology and using open 
innovation mechanisms, consumers and manufacturers 
jointly develop innovations in a media-rich and interactive 
environment. The idea of involving customers and end-
users as co-innovators has become highly popular [12]. 
For example, Osram, a light manufacturer, started an idea 
contest and invited Second Life residents to contribute 
ideas on the topic of lightning; Toyota Scion launched a 
virtual car model and encouraged participants to modify 
and customize their cars. Before Aloft, a new hotel 
concept from Starwood Hotels was built, a virtual mockup 
was discussed, evaluated, modified, and further developed 
in Second Life, resulting in several changes to the overall 
design [13]. 
Prior research has focused on identifying the factors 
that influence an organization's adoption decision when 
innovations come from outside the organization's formal 
boundaries [14]. More specifically, [15] and [16] have 
examined 
how 
participation 
in 
open 
innovation 
communities influences the innovative and financial 
performance 
of 
the 
services 
sector 
and 
firms 
commercializing open source software, respectively, 
revealing that participation is more strongly related to 
performance for firms that also exhibit high levels of 
40

social participation, for firms of larger size, and for firms 
with high R&D intensities [15]. 
The aim of this paper is to increase our understanding 
of the social interactions that occur within a user 
innovation community. Using Social Network Analysis 
(SNA), we propose that insights into member roles and the 
nature of interactions among individuals and the 
organization 
can 
provide 
additional 
guidance 
to 
organizations that utilize these communities. Moreover, 
SNA can be considered an appropriate tool for identifying 
lead users that can help an organization identify promising 
ideas and/or users to adopt or follow. 
This paper is structured as follows. First, the 
importance of user innovation communities is highlighted. 
Then, the methodology of our research is shown. Section 4 
introduces to our case of study. Results are shown in 
section 5. And finally, Section 6 stands for our 
conclusions.  
II. 
USER INNOVATION COMMUNITIES 
Technology is enabling new forms of producer‚Äì
consumer collaboration in an organization‚Äôs innovation 
process. As opposed to the traditional models, the 
development work in the open innovation model is based 
on the needs and co-creation activities of a community of 
users that interact with one another and the organization 
[4]. User innovation communities can be defined as 
‚Äúdistributed groups of individuals focused on solving a 
general problem and/or developing a new solution 
supported by computer mediated communication‚Äù [14]. It 
is a customer-centric innovation process, where new 
products and/or services are co-created together. Open 
innovation characterizes an innovation process where the 
customer is involved as a source for ideas, technical 
solutions, design or even first prototypes [17]. Instead of 
the firm creating innovations and exchanging it with their 
customers, during open innovation consumers take an 
active role and co-create these innovations together with 
the company [18]. For virtual co-creation the participation 
of engaged customers is crucial. Customers‚Äô actual 
experiences and their beliefs about the expected benefits 
significantly influence their actual continued participation 
in such forums. 
This creates a context that is highly different from 
traditional Internet applications. To co-create value, the 
firm and its customers representing the open innovation 
community must reconcile their objectives and define both 
the role and effort required from each party and an 
equitable division of the returns [4]. In fact, changing the 
focus from ownership to the concept of openness in 
projects requires a reconsideration of the processes that 
underlie value creation [19]. The process of co-creation is 
mainly influenced by the user, and therefore also the 
experience largely depends on the users [17]. 
Firms participate in user communities because they 
feel that they can influence the direction of development, 
gain legitimacy to use the innovation, and benefit from the 
expertise of a large base of skilled users [2]. Strong ties to 
the developer communities allow firms to access important 
complementary assets [1] such as technological know-how 
and information on emerging user needs or interests that 
facilitate the appropriation of rents from internally 
developed innovations [2], [20]. Thus, the work developed 
in the user community can be used in conjunction with the 
firm‚Äôs internal expertise to develop competitive products 
and/or services. Firms that engage in these communities, 
therefore, have a certain type of business model [21], [4], 
which works as a cognitive script and shapes the mindset 
of the firm towards looking for ideas in the community. 
Although this engagement in the community creates value 
for the firm, it is more difficult to appropriate because 
competitors may interfere. Firms with a strong knowledge 
base are in a better position to generate unique 
configurations of internal and external resources, which 
support their capacity to generate and appropriate returns 
from innovations [2], [22]. The presence of such 
‚Äúcomplementarities‚Äù [23] thus suggests that a firm‚Äôs access 
to community resources is conditioned by its internal R&D 
activities. As firms with technological know-how can 
make more valuable contributions to the communities, 
they are also more likely to obtain valuable resources in 
return that contribute to higher performance. Firms with 
strong technical know-how have the absorptive capacity to 
recognize, assimilate, and apply the knowledge resources 
that are available in the community [24]. Similarly, 
community engagement stimulates the discovery of new 
opportunities that may redirect a firm‚Äôs internal R&D 
towards more lucrative business activities [16]. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
Social Network Analysis has been frequently used to 
analyze the behavior of online communities. The idea 
consists of representing communities as a graph G = (N, E) 
where N denotes a finite set of nodes and E denotes a finite 
set of edges or arcs such that E ‚äÜ V √ó V [25]. In the case 
of online communities, nodes represent users, while arcs 
represent possible interactions among users. The number 
of vertices represents the number of community members 
and the arcs represent the interactions among them. 
Density is defined as the number of lines in a simple 
network, expressed as a proportion of the maximum 
possible number of lines. However, this definition does not 
take into account valued lines higher than 1 and it depends 
on the network size. A different measure of density is 
based on the idea of the degree of a node, which is the 
number of lines incident with it [26]. A higher degree of 
nodes yields a denser network, because nodes entertain 
more ties, and the average degree is a non-size dependent 
measure of density. 
IV. 
CASE STUDY: DELLIDEASTORM 
Dell IdeaStorm [27] is a user innovation community 
where end users freely reveal innovative ideas with 
community members and Dell [14]. This website 
represents a new way to listen to customers on how to 
build the best products and services. Through IdeaStorm, 
customers can post their ideas about existing or new Dell 
41
COLLA 2011 : The First International Conference on Advanced Collaborative Networks, Systems and Applications

products, services and operations [28]. Moreover, users 
have the option of voting for the best or the worst ideas as 
well as discussing the ideas with other users. Using this 
information, Dell shares the ideas with top management, 
department managers, and key employees that work within 
relevant subject domains. 
Users can comment on ideas by other (identified by an 
alias) as well as promote or demote ideas using the 
IdeaStorm vote feature. Promotion means adding ten 
points to the current rating of the idea while demotion 
means subtracting ten points. Dell takes part in the 
community commenting ideas through the user with alias 
bill_b.  
Using the proposed methodology, the community can 
be modeled as a graph considering users as nodes and arcs 
as interactions among users. Using comments, promotions 
and demotions to set arcs among nodes, up to three graphs 
can be obtained for representing the community: 1) 
comment, 2) promotion, and 3) demotion. The analysis of 
obtained graphs can illustrate different pattern of user 
behavior when commenting or voting on ideas. 
V. 
RESULTS 
An automatic tool has been programmed for extracting 
reported ideas in IdeaStorm one year beginning January 
2010. A total of 1482 ideas have been processed, obtaining 
the data for each idea detailed in Table I.

A. Comment network 
The comment network is built as follows: nodes are 
users and arcs are set between users commenting an idea 
and the author who posted this idea. Thus, ideas represent 
the basic unit of analysis. This step is repeated through the 
1482 extracted ideas. The obtained graph is a valued 
directed graph, where incoming links means comments 
received by a user. Figure 1 shows the obtained network. 
The total number of users (nodes in the network) is 1361. 
These users can be categorized as: 
‚Ä¢ 
Users who have posted at least one idea (n = 1153) 
‚Ä¢ 
Users who have commented ideas but they have never 
posted an idea (n = 208) 
In-degree means the number of arcs that a node 
receives. In our comment network, in-degree of a node 
represents those users whose ideas are most commented. 
Actually, nodes of Figure 1 have been represented with an 
area proportional to their in-degree. 808 users exhibit an 
in-degree value of 0 (the 208 user who have never posted 
an idea plus those users who posted an idea but never 
received a comment). The number of users with an in-
degree higher than 1 is 24. Obviously, user with alias 
‚Äúbill_b‚Äù shows an in-degree of 0, as the role of this 
employee from Dell is commenting ideas, not posting 
them. Table II details the in-degree partition, showing only 
those authors with low and high in-degree value.

Figure 2 shows the out-degree network. Size of nodes 
is now proportional to the number of arcs a node sends 
(posted comments). As expected, 953 users of Figure 2 
have an out-degree of 0 while just 408 users have posted at 
least one comment, following the typical participation 
inequality of online communities (the majority of 
contributions are posted by small fraction of the 
community) [29]. The number of users with an in-degree 
higher than 10 is 25 (nodes with a bigger area in Figure 
2). The user in the second position of out-degree ranking is 
‚Äúbill_b‚Äù (from Dell), with an out-degree value of 111. 
Table III details the out-degree partition, showing only 
those authors with low and high out-degree value.

B. Promotion network 
The promotion network is built considering users as 
nodes and arcs as the links between users promoting an 
idea and the author who posted this idea. In this case, the 
network size is 2151. Again, it can be distinguished among 
users who have posted at least one idea at IdeaStorm 1153, 
and users who have promoted ideas but they have never 
posted an idea, 998.  
 
 
Figure 3. In-degree 2010 promotions network. 
 
The in-degree network allows discovering those users 
who have posted ideas which have been most promoted 
(Figure 3). However, this network does not distinguish 
how many ideas have been posted by each author. 
Therefore, it is possible a node with a high in-degree due 
to posting a lot of ideas (for instance with a medium 
number of promotions). Regardless, it is clear that in 
general, ideas are receiving more promotions than 
comments if we compare this network with the in-degree 
comment network. The number of users with an in-degree 
higher than 1 is 1153, and the number of users with an in-
degree higher than 10 is 341. 
Figure 4 shows the out-degree promotion network. 
Nodes are overlapping, but we have maintained the same 
area scale for nodes‚Äô areas to highlight the high out-degree 
values of certain nodes as compared with the in-degree of 
Figure 3. There are five nodes with an out-degree higher 
than 500. It is also interesting to mention that there are just 
6 nodes with an out-degree of 0, and 1281 nodes with an 
out-degree of 1. That means that the majority of users have 
at least promoted one idea. The high value of users with an 
out-degree of 1 could be explained if we assume that new 
users usually engage in exploratory behavior prior to full 
engagement. Therefore, they promote an idea to see how 
the site functions.  
 
 
Figure 4. Out-degree 2010 promotions network. 
C. Demotion network 
Demotion network is built in a similar way to the 
previous network but using demotions instead of 
promotions. Network size is 1459 (users who have posted 
at least one idea at IdeaStorm 1153, and users who have 
demoted ideas but have never posted an idea, 306). The 
meaning of the demotion network is the same as the 
promotion network, but using the idea of demotion instead 
of promotion.

Figure 6. Out-degree 2010 demotion network. 
 
Figure 5 illustrates the in-degree demotions network. 
22 users exhibit an in-degree demotion value higher than 
10. Figure 6 is the out-degree demotion network. In this 
case, it can be easily noticed the presence of a very active 
‚Äúdemoter‚Äù user with an out-degree of 795! 
 
D. User behavior  
The obtained partitions of the three referred networks 
have been correlated to analyze to what extent the patterns 
of behavior in one network are similar to the rest of 
networks. Table IV details the obtained Spearman's rank-
order correlations for the 1153 who have posted at least 
one idea. IN and OUT-COM refers to the in and out 
degree partition of the comment network, and a similar 
notation is used for the rest of rows and columns of Table 
IV. The Spearman's rank-order correlation is the 
nonparametric version of the Pearson product-moment 
correlation, and measures the strength of the association 
between ranked variables, that is, how closely several sets 
of rankings agree with each other [30].

In-degree partition of the comment network is 
positively correlated with the in-degree partitions of 
promotion and demotion networks. However, the low 
value of correlation coefficients means that authors of 
most commented ideas are not always the ones who 
receive most promotions and demotions. Perhaps, a large 
number 
of 
comments 
signals 
controversy 
and 
disagreement among users making popularity of the idea 
ambiguous. The correlation coefficient of IN-PROM and 
IN-DEM is almost zero meaning there is no clear 
relationship among users receiving promotions and 
demotions. 
In the case of out-degree partitions, correlation 
coefficients are also positive but higher meaning people 
frequently commenting on ideas are usually the same 
people who promote and demote most ideas. In fact, the 
correlation coefficient of OUT-PROM and OUT-DEM is 
the higher of Table IV.  
In general, the participation inequality pattern can be 
distinguished in the three obtained networks, and most 
active users comment and vote on ideas. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper deals with the concept of open innovation 
from a social network analysis perspective. For this 
purpose, the open innovation community from Dell has 
been modeled as a graph, considering three networks 
attending to the interaction possibilities offered through 
this web. More specifically, the in-degree and the out-
degree distributions for these networks have been 
analyzed, obtaining several patterns of behavior of 
community members. A possible extension of this work 
would consists of identifying lead users, which represent 
the most important subset of the community from the 
organization perspective.
