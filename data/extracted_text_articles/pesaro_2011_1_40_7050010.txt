Abstract-The dedicated protection method uses the spare 
capacity as a “dedicated” resource and the backup 
capacity is allocated for the sole use of the connection or 
link. This method will be used by polynomial methods of 
the finite differences. The latter provides two methods, the 
first is the accurate polynomial method and the second is 
the approximate polynomial one. These methods are 
arithmetical, 
solving 
successfully 
the 
survivability 
problems and used for the verification of their results. The 
advantage of the polynomial methods is no use of the large 
matrix which shows the network active links that is used in 
the linear method. In this paper, the regression analysis is 
used to study the absolute error of polynomial finite 
differences methods (statistical method).  
 
 Keywords: finite differences; accurate polynomial; approximate 
polynomial; dedicated protection; regression. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
     The WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplex) optical mesh 
networks are high capacity telecommunication networks based 
on optical technologies that provide routing, grooming and 
restoration at the wavelength level as well as wavelength based 
services.  
     A fiber cut can have massive implications because network 
planners use more network elements to increase fiber capacity. 
For a WDM system with many channels on a single fiber, a 
fiber cut would result in multiple failures, causing many 
independent systems to fail. The optical path with dedicated 
1+1 protection on optical layer of optical WDM mesh 
networks can perform protection switching faster and more 
economically. In the present paper the objective is study the 
absolute error of the polynomial function methods by 
statistical method. So, we solve the optical path with dedicated 
1+1 protection problem using the polynomial methods of the 
finite differences calculating the final available capacity by 
two polynomial finite difference methods, the accurate one and 
the approximate one. Then the absolute error of two methods is 
calculating. The procedure is executed for a large number of 
experiments and the regression analysis is used to study the 
error. Research has been done in relation to the methods and 
the problems associated with planning, protection and 
restoration of optical networks. In [1] the authors present OTN 
(Optical Transport Network) evolution from an operator’s 
point of view, including the history of the transport network, 
the role of the OTN, and the motivations and requirements for 
OTN evolution. For a WDM system with many channels on a 
single fiber, a fiber cut would results multiple failures, causing 
many independent systems to fail [2][3][5][6][8][9][10]. There 
are also several approaches to ensure fiber network 
survivability [2][3][5][6][9]. Network survivability is defined 
as the capability of a communication network to resist any link 
or node interruption or disturbance of service, particularly by 
warfare, fire, earthquake, harmful radiation or other physical or 
natural catastrophes.The existing methods in solving these 
problems use special algorithms. We suggest a proposal that it 
is an approach based on the finite differences polynomial 
methods and represents the detail algorithm description and its 
program. The advantage of this approach is that the 
polynomial methods of finite differences solve the same 
telecommunication problem (of this kind) by two different 
methods simultaneously and they can verify each other in 
accepted tolerances. These methods also can compare with the 
linear one [11] and it is another verification way.  
     The following analysis presents the solution of the 
problems associated with the survival optical networks on the 
basis of the finite differences and the following problem is 
solved. The role of the Difference Calculus is in the study of 
the Numerical Methods. Computer solves these Numerical 
Methods. The subject of the Difference Equations [6] is in the 
treatment of discontinuous processes. The network final 
available capacity is revealed as a difference equation because 
the final available capacity of the individual working optical 
fibers is also a difference equation. The reduction of the 
available capacity of each working optical fiber is a 
discontinuous process when connection groups of several sizes 
pass through it. In [10], the authors begin with an overview of 
the existing strategies for providing transport network 
survivability and continue with an analysis of how the 
architectures for network survivability may evolve to satisfy 
the requirements of emerging networks. In [11], the author 
presents the finite differences, their methods and their 
problems when they are used to solve problems of this kind. In 
[12], two link disjoint paths, a dedicated working path and a 
shared protection path are computed , for an incoming light 
path request based on the current network state but the 
protection approaches to optimize the resource utilization for a 
given traffic matrix, do not apply because lightpath requests 
come and go dynamically. 
    This paper is broken down in the following sections:  
Section II shows how the finite differences are used for each 
optical fiber and illustrates the optical fiber final available 
capacity; Section III describes the problem, its formulation, its 
algorithm, an example and the proposals with discussion; 
Section IV draws conclusion and finally ends with the 
references.

II. THE OPTICAL FIBER AND THE FINITE 
DIFFERENCES 
 
     Before studying finite differences and their use in optical 
WDM mesh networks survivability, it is necessary to provide a 
short comprehensive presentation of the finite differences 
computation. Let’s assume that y1,y2,…,yn  is a sequence of 
numbers in which the order is determined by the index n. The 
number n is an integer and the yn can be regarded as a function 
of n, an independent variable with function domain the natural 
numbers and it is discontinuous. Such a sequence shows the 
available capacity reduction of a telecommunication fibre 
network link between two nodes when the telecommunication 
traffic of 1,2, …, n  source-destination node pairs pass through. 
It is assumed that the telecommunication traffic unit is the 
optical 
channel 
that 
is 
one 
wavelength 
(1λ). 
The 
telecommunications traffic includes optical connections with 
their protections. The total connections of a node pair form its 
connection group. The first order finite differences represent 
symbolically the connection group of each node pair that 
passes through a fiber. This connection group occupies the 
corresponding number of optical channels and it is the 
bandwidth that is consumed by connections of a node pair 
through this fiber. The first order finite differences are used to 
represent the connection groups in optical channels of the node 
pairs that pass through an optical fiber .An equation of the first 
order finite differences gives the available capacity of an 
optical fiber network link when a connection group passes 
through it. This available capacity is provided for the 
connection groups of the other node pairs that their 
connections will pass through this optical fiber. When the first 
connection group of ∆y1 connections passes through an optical 
fiber network link with installed capacity of y1 optical channels 
the first order finite difference equation gives the available 
capacity y2 ( y1 +1)  which is written as following  
y1 +1= y1 –∆y1 
The sequence ∆y1, ∆y2, ∆y3,…, ∆yn represents the connection 
groups that pass through this optical fiber network link .When 
∆y1 subtracted from y1, creates y2, when ∆y2 subtracted from y2, 
creates y3,…, when ∆yn subtracted from yn creates yn+1 which is 
the total unused available capacity of this optical fiber.  Thus 
the total unused available capacity of each network optical 
fiber is calculated after n connections groups pass through it. 
The total unused available capacity of each network optical 
fiber is also written as a polynomial function, and there are two 
polynomial function methods. The assessment of the 
polynomial function coefficients is done with the values that 
the polynomial function represents for 1, 2,…, n, n +1. The 
values of the function yn+1 for each n must be integral because 
each value represents optical channels.  There are more details 
in the [11] but for helping the reader we write them again.  
    The general form of a polynomial function that gives the 
available capacity of the optical fiber network link after the 
serving n connection groups, is as follows  
               
        n  
                         yn +1=   Σ αr*( n+1) r       
                        (1)                                         
                                   r=0 
     The assessment of the polynomial function coefficients is 
done with the values that the polynomial function represents 
for 1,2,…, n, n +1 .The values of the function yn+1 for each n 
must be integral because each value represents optical 
channels.  
-If the equation (1) is written analytically as follows 
y0+1= α0*( 0+1)0 
y1+1= α0*( 1+1)0 +α1*( 1+1)1 
y2+1= α0*( 2+1)0 +α1*( 2+1)1+α2*( 2+1)2 
y3+1= α0*( 3+1)0 +α1*( 3+1)1+α2*( 3+1)2 +α3*( 3+1)3 
………………………………………………………. 
yn+1= α0*( n+1)0 +α1*( n+1)1+α2*( n+1)2 +…+αn* 
          ( n+1)n 
The value of the function has high accuracy of 15 decimal 
digits. This method is an accurate one. 
-If the equation (1) is written analytically as follows 
y0+1= α0*( 0+1)0 +α1*( 0+1)1+α2*( 0+1)2 +…+αn*( 0+1)n 
y1+1= α0*( 1+1)0 +α1*( 1+1)1+α2*( 1+1)2 +…+αn*( 1+1)n 
y2+1= α0*( 2+1)0 +α1*( 2+1)1+α2*( 2+1)2 +…+αn*( 2+1)n 
y3+1= α0*( 3+1)0 +α1*( 3+1)1+α3*( 3+1)2 +…+αn*( 3+1)n 
………………………………………………………. 
Yn+1= α0*( n+1)0 +α1*( n+1)1+α2*( n+1)2 +…+αn*( n+1)n 
The value of the function has reduced accuracy and depends of 
the value of n. This method is an approximated one. 
They are systems of n+1equations with n+1unknown 
coefficients. The values of the coefficients depend of the 
number of the connection groups and the connections of each 
connection group. The 1st method is more accurate than 2nd one 
because only one factor is added to new equation when the 
polynomial degree increases versus one factor is added for all 
equations respectively.

III. THE PROBLEM AND ITS SOLUTION 
     A. The problem   
     The network topology and other parameters are known as 
WDM and optical fiber capacity, one optical fiber per link with 
an extension to a 1+1 fiber protection system. So this network 
is characterized by one working fiber per link, edges of two 
links, links of two optical fibers, one for working and one for 
protection. The connections are lightpaths originating in the 
source nodes and terminating at the destination nodes 
proceeding 
from 
preplanned 
optical 
working 
paths. 
Additionally, the same number of optical paths is preselected 
for the preplanned fully disjoint backup paths, (1+1 dedicated 
protection connection). So the connections are protected. The 
connections of the same node pair form a group along the 
network. The preplanned protection paths do the dedicated 
protection of the connection groups. So a suitable number of 
wavelengths per link along the network uses. The solution is 
the calculation of the final available capacity of the network 
for a given table. This table contains the number of the node 
pairs, the node pairs and the number of the connections of each 
node pair when their working and protection paths are 
preplanned. This procedure is executed for polynomial 
accurate finite difference method and for the corresponded 
approximate on and the absolute error is calculated. In [11] I 
have proved that the linear finite difference method (which is 
an ILP method with the disadvantage the large matrix A 
(2pxn) which occupies large memory and has difficult 
treatment)) and the polynomial accurate method are not 
introducing errors in the solution of the problem. The 
polynomial approximate one does it. The absolute error is 
calculated statistically when the procedure is executed for a 
large number of experiments and the number of the 
connections of each node pair takes its value by a random 
number generation with adjusted maximum value. The 
maximum value must be small in comparison with the WDM 
and fiber system capacity so that network is a strictly non 
blocking network, in which it is always possible to connect any 
node pair, regardless of the state of the network. So all requests 
for connection are satisfied and form connections. The 
regression analysis is used to study this absolute error. The 
regression analysis focuses more on how much each curve of 
table 2 is better fitting to the error data that introduced by the 
approximate method. These fitted curves can aid for data 
visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are 
available, and to summarize the relationships among the 
variables. The curves of the regression analysis are in the table 
2. 
     B. The formulation 
     The network is assumed to be an optical mesh network with 
the circuit switched (or packet switched but the packets are 
adjusted to follow preplanned paths) as a graph. Each vertex 
represents the central telecommunications office (CO) with the 
OXC while each edge represents two links. Each edge link has 
a couple of optical fibers. All optical fibers have the same 
capacity as the WDM system. All nodes are identical. The 
numbers of working and protection connections that pass 
through each optical fiber are different. Two finite difference 
polynomial equations are calculated for each optical fiber, one 
for polynomial accurate method and one for the polynomial 
approximate one. For all network links, the general equation of 
the polynomial function has two column matrices, the left one 
that is equals with the right one. When all connections have 
been set up then each element of the column matrix must be 
greater or equal to zero. In other cases some connections are 
not possible. The total final available capacity of the network 
for the polynomial methods is given by the equation (2). This 
is the formulation of the polynomial function method problem.

    C. The algorithm  
    Our algorithm describes the operation of the WDM optical 
fiber mesh network and we investigate the polynomial finite 
difference methods.  TURBO PASCAL is used to program the 
model [4].  The algorithm has the following steps and phases. 
    First step Network parameters 
    Initially the following data are known: network topology, 
node number, edge number, link number per edge, working 
optical fiber number per link, protection optical fiber number 
per link, wavelength number per optical fiber, optical fiber 
numbering. This information allows the computer to draw a 
graph and an OXC is on the vertex of the graph [10]. Each 
edge corresponds to two links with opposite direction to each 
other. All fibers have the same wavelength number and all 
links the same fiber number. The computer reads the adjacency 
matrix and is informed about the network topology.  
      Second step Connection selections 
     In this step, the number of the connection node pair, the 
connection node pair selection for connections and the desired 
connection group size are done. The preplanned working and 
the protection optical paths for connections of every node pair 
are also provided. When many experiments are executed a 
random number generator with adjusted maximum value (max) 
is activated to give the connection group size. 
    Failure-free Network Phase 
    Third step Wavelength allocation  
     In this step, wavelength allocation is initiated.  A working 
connection starts from the source node and progresses through 
the network occupying a wavelength on each optical fiber and 
switch to another fiber on the same or other wavelength by 
OXC, according to its preplanned working optical path up to 
arrive at the destination node. Simultaneously, the protection 
connection starts from the source node and progresses through 
the network occupying a wavelength on each optical fiber and 
switch to another fiber on the same or other wavelength by 
OXC, according to its preplanned protection optical path up to 
arrive at the destination node. So there is full and dedicated 
protection for this connection. The number of connections of 
each node pair is equal to its connection group size.  After a 
connection (working as well as protection) has been 
established, the available capacity is also calculated under both 
methods of the finite differences. Thus the available capacity 
of the one method is compared to available capacity of the 
other method for one connection. 
     Forth step. Presentation of the finite differences

     The total available capacity of each optical fiber is 
calculated and represented under both polynomial methods of 
finite difference. Thus the total fiber capacity available under 
the first method is compared to the total fiber capacity 
available of the other method for all connections. 
     Fifth step. Results and comparisons thereof  
     Having the desired connection group size the total results 
are computed under each finite difference method that are the 
total sum of the individual connection group size, the total 
installed capacity, the total protection capacity, the total busy 
capacity and the available residual capacity. These results of 
the accurate method are compared to the results of the 
approximated method. The results of these methods must be 
equal or to have the desired tolerances. In other cases the worst 
results are rejected.  
    The max value must be small in comparison with the WDM 
and fiber system capacity so that network is a strictly non 
blocking network, in which it is always possible to connect any 
node pair, regardless of the state of the network. So all requests 
for connection are satisfied and form connections. 
    Network with failure Phase 
    When a failure occurs and a link is cut, the optical fibers of 
this link are also cut and the optical fiber protection 1+1 and 
the network topology change. The connection groups that 
passed through the cut link are also cut and the restoration is 
carried out passing through the preplanned protection paths of 
other links. The computer is informed of the cut link and 
modifies suitably the network parameters. The cut optical fiber 
sets its wavelengths to zero. The connection groups that 
passing through the cut link set their using wavelengths to zero 
and through the others to free.  
 
     D. Example 
    The network and the results are presented shortly because 
the paper must be short. The topology of the network is 
presented by the graph G (V, E). The vertex set has q=6 
elements and the edge set has p=9 elements. Each edge is an 
optical link of two directions with one working fiber for each 
direction. Thus there are 2*p=2*9=18 optical fibers. 
Connection groups transverse the mesh network and 
correspond to n source-destination node pairs. WDM system 
capacity has 30 wavelengths. The accurate polynomial 
function method and the approximated polynomial function are 
presented.

The problem is solved for n=12 of 30 possible connection 
groups. These have their order and sizes for each source-
destination node pair, their working paths and their protection 
paths as shown in table 3. The results with finite differences 
are showed. It is obvious that the dedicated path protection 
mechanisms use more than 100% redundant capacity because 
their lengths are longer than their working paths. The total 
length of working paths is seventeen, (17) and the total length 
of protection paths is twenty-five, (25).Similarly for the same 
connections requested group size the capacity that is used by 
the protection paths is larger than the corresponding working 
paths. 
     The synoptic presentation is used for the finite difference 
tables. So the higher order finite differences and the number of 
connection groups that pass through each optical fiber are 
showed in the table 4. (Fiber, i) shows the optical fibers. The 
n(i) shows the number of the connection groups that pass 
through each optical fiber. The ∆m(i)yi the order finite 
differences with m(i)=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of the fiber i. The 
intermediate order finite differences are not showed. The 
16teen has only 1st order differences.

     When none group goes through the optical fiber, then the 
degree of the polynomial function is 0, when one group goes 
through, then the degree of the polynomial function is 1, when 
two groups go through, then the degree of the polynomial 
function is 2, etc.  
     The polynomials that calculate the available capacity of 
each optical link for the accurate (first) method for all possible 
values up to four and for the following cases are represented. 
The number, the order and the size of ∆yi,j are critical. 
-If no one-connection group passes through an optical link the 
polynomial function is constant, etc. 
yj,0+1= α0*( 0+1)0  
 yj,0+1=30.  
-If only one-connection group passes through an optical link 
the polynomial function is of the first degree.

This method is an accurate one but if all coefficients are not 
written completely with 15 digits there are errors in the results. 
The above ones are rounded to the closest integer to agree with 
the real ones. 
The polynomials that calculate the available capacity of each 
optical link for the approximated (second) method for all 
possible values up to four and for the following cases are 
represented. The number, the order and the size of ∆yi,j are 
critical. 
-If no one-connection group passes through an optical link the 
polynomial function is constant. 
yj,0+1= α0*( 0+1)0

-If only one-connection group passes through an optical link 
the polynomial function is of the first degree.

  If the degree of polynomials increases then the above writing 
of the polynomial numerical coefficients has error because 
they are difficult to be represented.    
    The total available capacity for the accurate (first) method is 
Cavp1=426 wavelengths and for the approximated (second) 
method is Cavp2=426.214 wavelengths. Thus, the total busy 
capacity for the accurate (first) method is given Cb1 =114 
wavelengths and for the approximated (second) method is 
given Cb2 =113.786 wavelengths. The network installed 
capacity is Cinst=18*30=540 wavelengths. So the following 
sum is valid Cb1+Cav=Cinst or 114+426=540.    The absolute 
error between the accurate and approximated methods is 
∆C=|(Cav2 - Cav1)|=0.214.  
      For the best study of the precision, 100000 experiments are 
executed. The average is 0.324037, the variance is 0.005072. 
The width of the variance is 0.47999999515712 with the 
minimum error equal to 0.088000000454485 and maximum 
error 0.56799999997019. So the range of the errors is 
separated in nine intervals (classes) with width 0.06. The 
classes are showed in the table 5 second column (class).  The 
median of each class is showed in the table 5, third column 
(xi). For the better representation of the data that are measured, 
the graphical method is used figure 2, curve absolute (the 
measured distribution) and figure 3, curve athristikh (the 
measured accumulated distribution). The parameters of the 
measured frequencies are showed in the table 6, second 
column (absolute).The parameters ASYM and CURV mean 
the coefficient of asymmetry and the coefficient of curve 
respectively. After it is tried to understand, model and analyze 
the relationship between a dependent variable (error 
frequency) and one independent variable (error class that is 
showed by its median). It is a regression analysis. The curves 
of figure 2 are the normal distribution and parabola one. The 
curves of figure 3 are the log normal distribution and the 
parabola one. The parameters of the curves of figure 2 are 
showed in the table 6. The coefficient of correlation between 
the random variable error class and error frequency is a 
quantitative index of association between these two variables. 
In its squared form, as a coefficient of determination R2 
indicates the amount of variance in the criterion variable error 
frequency that is accounted by the variation in the predictor 
variable error class. These coefficients for the curves of the 
Figures 2 and 3 showed in the next Table 7.

The curve-fitting techniques will (in most practical cases) 
produce functions that will not precisely fit all the data points 
(sometimes none of the points exactly lie on the curve such 
that the residuals Rin=fin-fia and Rip=fip-fia are existed). 
These are showed for the curves of figure 2 in the figure 4. 
There are two fittings with their error patterns. The different 
two colors are indicating two different fits. It is obvious that 
the residuals are scattered between negative and positive. This 
bar chart gives limited visual impressions about the two fitting 
residuals. We can recognize a random pattern showing us the 
two fits of the residual distribution for the error class number 
from 1 to 9. Every abscissa should have two different color 
bars. The first fit is black and the second white with shadow.  
We can see that some bars are missing which indicates a zero 
(or a very small) residual. For example, we may say that at the 
error class number 1 and 9, the first fit is very accurate (we 
cannot see the bright black rectangle), while in error class 
number 5 the black rectangle is larger which means that the 
first fit function, represented by black color, has a very bad fit 
there. At the figure 5, the absolute residuals are showed and

the comparison is presented better. At the figure 6, for the 
better presentation of the fitting, the error class number is 
replaced by the error grade and the absolute residuals are 
sorted. The first error grade (1) represents the minimum 
absolute residuals (or deviations) for everything of the two fits 
and last one (9) represents the maximum absolute residuals. 
The error grade number two (2) also represents residuals that 
come in the second grade for everyone of the two fits, and so 
on. Therefore, instead of comparing only maximum errors 
(mostly occurring at different two points) as indications of how 
good is the fit, we may compare all the 9 grades of errors and 
find out which fit would sum up the least errors and that would 
be our required fit. The same analysis could be represented for 
the curves of the figure 3. 
        The complexity of this algorithm for the node number q 
depends on the square of the node number and the total 
number of the requests for connection (s) so it is written as

O(s*q2). Consuming time for 100000 experiments for the 
accurate method is 16’ 43’’ 10 and for the approximate one 16’ 
46’’ 46. On a 133MHz computer the approximate method 
consumes more time than the accurate one to solve the same 
problem in the same network. The worst consuming time 
depends of network size for the same computer. The matrix of 
coefficients of the accurate method is low triangular and of the 
approximate one is square. So the approximate method needs 
more memory for solving.   
     E. Discussion and Proposals 
     In this protection scheme, when a single failure of a cut link 
occurs and the main connection also cuts then the connection 
is routed by backup path.

      The use of the polynomial methods of finite differences is 
possible for the study of the problems related to the protection 
and restoration of connections and has the advantage versus 
the linear method that is not using the large matrix with the 
active links of the network. The active links are the links that 
pass through the optical paths. For better presentation of this 
research a short example is used that depicts the results in 
these methods. The algorithm provides for each source-
destination node pair and a desired connection group size, a 
value of the total available capacity of the network. The 
connection length depends on the number of hops. The   
network has a complete protection for optical path connection. 
It is a switch circuit network (or a packet switch network but 
the packets are adjusted to pass through preplanned paths) so 
that one lightpath corresponds to one optical connection. 
Different wavelengths may be used for each connection in 
each hop, so that wavelength conversion is used at each node.

     These methods solve problems with small networks 
because when the connections groups that pass through a link 
increases, then the number of the (n+1) equations with n+1 
unknown of the system also increases and it is difficult to be 
solved to calculate the coefficients. The accurate method is 
easier and more accurate than the approximate one because 
only one factor is added to each new equation when the 
polynomial degree increases versus one factor is added for all 
equations. In Turbo Pascal for the PC, the best precision is 15 
decimal digits and some differences that appeared are ought to 
the difficulty to write all decimal digits for each polynomial 
coefficient of the polynomial methods. For the precision, the 
double type is used that is a floating point format and provides 
good dynamic range in addition to high precision.  
      The coefficient of determination R2 value is an indicator of 
how well your data fits a line or curve. This coefficient value is 
in the range (0, 1). When a distribution (curve) has larger R2 
than another, it has also best dependent for its variables than 
another one. In other words, if the R2 value is closer to 1, 
means more likely your data points are solutions to the 
equation that defines your curve. This indicates how well your 
data fits the model you are testing. The normal distribution has 
best fitting than the parabolic one to the measured distribution 
and the log normal distribution has also best fitting than the 
parabolic one to the measured accumulated distribution. These 
are showed in the figures, 2 and 3. For better presentation of 
the curve fitting, the residuals are showed in the figures, 4 up 
to 9.

          The solution of the optimization problem that means the 
solution of a problem that more approaches to our demands is 
more complex. The general solution of this problem is difficult 
so it is transformed as a NP-complete problem. It is also noted 
that ILP formulations are practical only for small networks 
because the number of the equations and the variables should 
be as less as possible. The statistical method solves the 
problem but in a long time.  For larger networks only heuristic 
methods are used because they are faster and give a very good, 
if not optimal, result. A heuristic method tries to solve the 
optimization problem in one or two steps ignoring whether the 
solution can be proven to be correct, a good or better solution 
is produced. So the computation performance is improved 
obtaining in a short time the solution of this problem at the 
cost of the accuracy. The simplex method is impractical for 
larger networks because there are a lot of scenarios, it is an ILP 
problem and the number of the variables and the number of 
equations also increase rapidly.

    In this paper, the dedicated protection optical path method 
has been researched on the basis of the polynomial methods of 
finite differences statistically. The methods of finite 
differences make it possible to research and study the 
dedicated protection problems of the optical paths. They 
provide suitable, accurate arithmetical methods to solve 
telecommunication problems such as planning of a completely 
protected network, complete protection for any failure occurs 
on optical path, node or link e. t. c.
