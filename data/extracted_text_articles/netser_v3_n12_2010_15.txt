Abstract—Sensor networks are becoming one of the most 
used technologies in our lives. Although there are several 
surveys about sensor networks, almost all of them focus 
on theoretical basis with little simulations. Some studies 
only explain where this kind of networks can be used, 
without details on how they can be applied. This paper 
classifies applications of wireless sensor networks and 
describes real implementations. There is not any survey 
like the one presented in this paper. The target is to 
complement the existing surveys, by presenting details on 
real implementations in order to understand how these 
networks run, and how they are designed, maintained 
and operated. 
 
Keywords: sensor, sensor networks, sensor applications,

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Latest advances in sensor technology are leading to 
the development of distributed mechanisms and small 
devices with both low cost and low energy 
consumption. In addition, these devices are capable of 
processing information locally and communicating 
wirelessly with other elements. These devices are 
called sensor nodes or motes. 
In some cases, amount of sensors are necessary to 
sense an environment or take measurements from the 
surroundings. While they are sensing, they have also to 
communicate between them and/or with a central 
server. On the other hand, a monitored environment 
doesn’t have infrastructure to supply energy for 
communication. So, motes must work with small 
batteries and use wireless channels. 
Another feature of the sensor networks is their 
capacity of distributed processing. It is necessary 
because, the communication is the process that 
consumes more energy. A distributed system means 
that some sensors need to communicate through long 
distances. So, it is a good idea to process locally data 
as much as possible in order to minimize the bit rate. 
Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs) are formed 
dynamically because the connectivity between nodes 
depends on their position and their position variation 
over the time (if they are mobile). This kind of 
networks is characterized as being easy to be deployed 
and self-configuring. A sensor node is composed by a 
transmitter, a receiver, and it offers services of routing 
between nodes without direct vision, as well as records 
data from other sensors. 
The following are some of the main features of 
WSNs: 
• 
Dynamic topologies: In a wireless sensor network, 
the topology is always changing because nodes 
can fail or new nodes can join the network. These 
changes affect the communication between 
sensors. 
• 
Variability channel: The radio channel is highly 
variable. There are several phenomena, such as the 
attenuation, fast fainting, slow fainting and 
interference that can cause data errors. 
• 
Ad hoc networks: Generally, sensor networks do 
not have a wired network infrastructure. All motes 
are transceivers and routers simultaneously. 
However, the concept of sink node is important; 
this node collects the information and sends it to a 
central computer capable of processing these data. 
• 
Failure tolerance: A sensor node should be able to 
continue operating despite of the existence of 
errors in the system. 
• 
Multi-hop or broadcast communications: This type 
of networks use any routing protocol to enable 
communications multi-hop, although it is also very 
common the use of messages sent in broadcast. 
• 
Power saving: It is one of the most important 
features in these networks. Currently, the motes 
have limited energy. A sensor node should have 
an 
ultra 
low 
consumption 
processor 
and 
transceiver radio. It is one of the most restrictive 
features. 
• 
Limited hardware: In order to get an adjusted 
consumption, the hardware should be simple; this 
brings a limited process capacity. 
• 
Production costs: Sensor networks are formed by 
high number of nodes. Motes must be economic to 
create a reliable network. 
Since sensors can collect data from environment, a 
sensor network has many application areas, such as 
habitat monitoring, fire detection, motion tracking, 
reservoir water controlling, or intruders controlling. In

order to control, monitor, tracking or detect, it is 
necessary a large quantity of sensor nodes which detect 
the monitored event (light, pressure, sound, heat, 
humidity, electro-magnetic field, proximity, location, 
etc.), and transmit it to a base station, where last action 
will be made. Sensor networks have become very 
useful for our lives and they have penetrated in 
domains such as health, home care, environment 
monitoring, etc [1].  
The structure of the paper is as follows. The related 
work and our motivation are presented in Section 2. 
Section 3 describes the most important parts of the 
WSN 
architecture. 
Our 
classification 
of 
the 
applications of WSNs is shown in Section 4. This 
section is divided in five parts and each of them 
analyses an application and shows several real 
implementations. Then, in Section 5, we present a 
comparative study of different real deployments. In 
section 6, we show limitations and challenges of WSN. 
Finally, in section 7, we conclude the paper. 
 
II. RELATED WORK AND MOTIVATION 
Wireless sensor networks and their applications 
have been a popular research field because they 
provide a lot of facilities in our society.   
Nowadays, the WSNs literature has large number of 
researches and studies. A pioneering work related to 
sensor networks identified the main characteristics of 
this type of networks. An example is the paper “A 
Survey on Sensor Networks” [2], which analyses the 
state of the art of sensor networks and describes their 
characteristics, architecture, and protocols. Another 
work is the paper presented by K. Akkaya and M. 
Younis [3], where only some routing protocols and 
types of networks are analyzed. The authors show the 
advances in designing WSN’s new algorithms. Ning 
Xu, in his technical report [4], describes several 
installed systems of sensor networks, but only in the 
health and environment fields. Standards, protocols, 
and others important aspects about sensor networks are 
described in the paper “Wireless Sensor Networks and 
Applications: a Survey” [5]. 
Most of the surveys related to sensor networks 
describe their characteristics in great detail, but, in our 
case, the main contribution is that the survey is focused 
on analyzing and describing the fields of application. 
In addition, examples about real implementations will 
be explained in each field of application. 
 
III. WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK ARCHITECTURE 
In this section, we will present the generic 
architecture of sensor networks. First, we introduce the 
motes, their architecture, and their main features. After 
it, we will describe the communication protocol stack 
used in these networks and we will briefly analyze 
each layer. 
A. Motes 
A network of sensors is formed by sensor nodes, 
also called motes. Despite of what they are measuring 
with their sensing unit, a mote needs to process the 
data, to store it, using a processing unit, and transmit 
the information to the network, by using the 
transmitter/receiver unit and taking care of how much 
energy is available in its power unit [2][6]. The 
processing unit has a processor chip, usually a 
microcontroller, a volatile memory, and a non-volatile 
memory if the data needs to be stored. In order to 
transmit the information, some specific protocols for 
sensor networks have been created. When the 
information of many motes is coordinated using a 
protocol, the environment can be measured in great 
detail. Its main components are shown in Fig. 1. 
The main issue in today’s mote development is to 
minimize their size for optimizing their power supply. 
A sensor network is a group of motes that cooperate 
to do a specific task [7]. The precision of their tasks 
depends on the density of the scatter and on their 
coordination. Originally, they were formed by a small 
number of motes that were connected with a central 
station. Nowadays, WSNs allow distributed networks 
having more measurements and closer to the event. 
B.  Embedded operating systems for sensors 
platforms 
In order to manage the hardware of a mote, an 
operative system is needed. It is responsible to make 
the mote to carry out its operations and tasks.  
A major difference between sensor networks and 
more traditional computing platforms, it is the extreme 
emphasis in sensor networks on power management. A 
large number of applications require battery-powered 
operation for extended periods of time. In order to 
manage power efficiently, each subsystem of the 
platform is powered individually. 
For example, a radio should have to be turned on 
only during active communication, and it should be 
possible to shut down the CPU between processing 
requests. Similarly, it should be possible to power 
down the sensor and I/O subsystems individually when 
not in use.

In spite of WSNs have a short history, there are 
several enterprises working in this technology. For 
example, Crossbow [8] is a company that develops 
hardware and software platforms for WSNs. Some of 
their products are Mica, Mica2, Micaz, Mica2dot, telos 
and telosb. Moteiv [9] developed the Tmote Sky and 
Tmote Invent platforms. Tmote Sky is a platform 
focused for low consumption and high collection of data 
applications. It has integrated sensors, radio, antenna 
and microcontroller. Besides it can be easily 
programmed. Finally, Shockfish is a Switzerland 
enterprise that developed TinyNode [9]. Table I 
summarizes the main features of these motes. 
Several operative systems have been developed for 
the motes such as Bertha[11], MagnetOS [12], LiteOS 
[13], TinyOS [14], and so on. Their main features are: 
• 
Bertha (pushpin computing platform). It is a 
software platform designed to deploy a distributed 
WSN with a lot of identical nodes. Their main 
functions are divided in the following subsystems: 
- Management of processes. 
- Management of structures of data.  
- Organization of neighbours 
- Network interface  
• 
MagnetOS: It is a distributed operative system for 
sensor or adhoc networks. Its objective is to run 
network applications of low consumption devices. 
It is very adaptive and easy to implement. 
• 
LiteOS: It is a multi-threaded operating system 
that provides Unix-like abstractions for wireless 
sensor networks. It offers a hierarchical file 
system and a wireless shell interface for user 
interaction. 
• 
TinyOS: It is used for Tmote Sky. It is a reduced 
multi tasks core useful for small devices, like the 
motes. It is an “event-driven” operative system, 
that is, when an event happened, this calls to the 
corresponding functions. It has been developed for 
WSNs with limited resources.  
The programming of sensors is quite complicated 
because they have a limited calculus capacity and very 
few resources. Several programming languages have 
been developed to program the motes. Some of them 
are nesC [15], Protothreads [16], Giotto [17], and so 
on.  
The libraries and applications of TinyOS are written 
in nesC, a version of C designed to program embedded 
systems. In nesC, the programs are composed by 
linked components. 
C.  Protocol stack 
In order to enable the communication and data 
transfer between two sensor nodes there have to be 
some rules and conventions. A protocol defines the 
behavior of their connection and how they exchange 
information 
over 
a 
network 
medium.

information from a mote moves through a network 
medium to another mote is implemented using layers.  
Each layer is reasonably self-contained so that the 
tasks assigned to each layer can be implemented 
independently. This enables the solutions offered by 
one layer to be updated without adversely affecting the 
other layers.  
The sensor module shown in Fig. 1 has 4 layers. 
The first three layers handle data transport issues. A 
wide variety of communication protocols exist for each 
one of them. Here it is a brief description and some 
protocol examples:  
1. 
Physical Layer: It is the closest to the physical 
network medium and tells a sensor node how to 
transmit to the medium and how to receive from 
it. Sensors transmission medium could be any 
wire, such as copper or fibber, or wireless 
(wireless sensors could use 433 MHz, 915 MHz 
or 2.4 GHz). 
2. 
Data Link Layer: It provides the functional and 
procedural means to transfer data between 
network sensor nodes and to detect and possibly 
correct errors that may occur in the physical 
layer. Some data link layer protocols are mainly 
deployed for sensors such as S-MAC [18], IEEE 
802.15.4 [19], Zigbee [20], and so on.  
3. 
Network Layer: It provides the functional and 
procedural means of transferring variable length 
data sequences from a source to a destination 
through a path. Many routing protocols have 
been designed for ad hoc and sensor networks. 
They can be grouped in Pro-active Routing, 
Reactive Routing, Geographical Routing, and so 
on [3]. 
4. 
Transport Layer: This layer becomes necessary if 
it is wanted to access the system from Internet or 
other 
external 
networks. 
To 
our 
current 
knowledge, there is no any work discussing or 
proposing other mechanisms, different from the 
ones used in Internet, to be applied in sensor 
networks exclusively. 
5. 
Application Layer: It offers to the applications 
the possibility of gaining access to the services 
provided by the rest of the layers. In addition, 
this layer defines the protocols used by the 
applications to exchange data.  
The following section shows the main fields where 
wireless sensor networks can be applied. 
 
IV. WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS APPLICATIONS  
This section presents a few applications where 
WSNs have been usefully implemented or have a big 
potential to be implemented.  
A. Real deployments for Health 
Fielding health-related deployments, WSNs can 
provide a better quality of life for people with physic 
or psychic difficulties. There are several main sub-
fields, such as:  
1) 
Human 
body 
implementations 
and 
body 
parameter measurements 
Sensors let control important parameters of the 
human body like the heart rate or the blood pressure in 
order to diagnose the illness and identify a particular 
health problem. Some similar applications include 
Glucose level monitors [21], organ monitors [22], 
cancer detectors [23] and general health monitors. The 
idea of embedding wireless biomedical sensors inside 
human body is promising, although many additional 
challenges exist: (i) the system must be ultra-safe and 
reliable, (ii) it requires minimal maintenance, and (iii) 
must deal with the energy-harnessing from body heat. 
With more researches and progress in this field, better 
quality of life can be achieved and medical cost can be 
reduced. One of the examples given is the 
Swallowable sensor [24]. It is a wireless capsule that is 
ingested and can help to diagnose of stomach disorders 
[25]. A little medical device developed by Buffalo 
[26]. The intelligent pill is taken in by a patient and 
begins to transmit information to a receiver. This 
receiver is carried by same patient and gathers data 
from the stomach while the pill goes over it. Some of 
these devices include a microscopic camera. This 
system helps to diagnose stomach-ache and others 
stomach disorders that affect 20% of the humans. 
Sensor (pill) transmits information on levels of acidity, 
pressure, or time of digestion, while it is travelling in 
stomach. The capsule is thrown out two days after and 
it is recovered for its analysis and for downloading 
data. Another example was presented by Loren et al. in 
[27]. This work describes a biomedical application:, 
i.e., the artificial retina. Retina prosthesis chip consists 
on 100 microsensors that are built and implanted 
within human eye. This allows patients with no vision 
or limited vision to see at an acceptable level. The 
wireless communication is required to suit the need for 
feedback control, image identification and validation. 
TDMA is used for this application to serve the purpose 
of energy conservation because the communication 
pattern is deterministic and periodic. 
Huan-Bang Li et al. proposed body area networks 
for 
three 
categories 
Medical 
and 
Healthcare 
Applications, Applications for assisting persons with 
disabilities, and Entertainment applications [28]. 
Authors proposed Zigbee and Bluetooth technology 
for the sensors.

Bartosz P. Jarochowski et al developed an 
application to rehabilitation centres [29]. In this system 
a personal node is located on the patient, for example 
on a belt clip or incorporated into an arm-band. This 
node stores information about the patient’s session 
rehabilitation exercises and it is possible to obtain 
some statistics. Finally, the information can be sent to 
the medical control centre. Then, it can be analyzed by 
the doctors in order to improve the treatment for the 
next session, if it is needed. 
2) 
Health control, monitor, and tracking systems 
These systems have many applications. They can be 
used by patients who are very ill and can’t go out. 
They can be controlled remotely by doctors. There are 
many proposals for monitoring elderly people and for 
tracking people with Alzheimer. In 2006, Bo Sun 
Hwang et al. developed a monitoring system which 
was focused on the activities of an individual daily 
living in a home [30]. Sensors communicate through 
the Bluetooth protocol [31]. The system detects the 
movements of a subject and then his/her activity 
pattern and position in a home is analyzed by a 
tracking algorithm. The system can be used to monitor 
disabled and elderly people by means of the graphical 
activity obtained from their system. Another work was 
presented by Hyung Jun Kim et al., in 2006 [32]. They 
proposed a home-based monitoring system that was 
continuously and unobtrusively monitoring a patient’s 
condition. The system was implemented using Zigbee 
technology. A. Wood et al. presented ALARM-NET in 
[33], a wireless sensor network for assisted-living and 
residential monitoring. It integrates environmental and 
physiological sensors in a heterogeneous architecture 
to determine circadian activity rhythms of residents. In 
2007, Yaw-Jen Lin et al. presented a ubiquitous 
monitor system integrated with biosensors and Radio 
Frequency Identification (RFID) technology [34]. The 
system was expected to improve the Activity of Daily 
Living of the disabled and elderly people, to detect the 
emergencies or accidents in order to enhance the 
quality of care.  
3) 
Developments to make the life easier for 
disabled and elderly people 
Marjorie 
Skubic 
presented 
in 
[35] 
a 
multidisciplinary project to investigate the use of 
sensor technology to provide early identification of 
problems in mobility and cognition, helping residents 
manage illness and impairments and stay as healthy 
and independent as possible. It uses an event-driven, 
video sensor network that hides identifying features of 
the residents and a reasoning component that fuses 
sensor and video data and analyzes patterns of 
behavioural activity. F. Brunetti et al. presented a 
system in [36] for motion caption and assessment in 
biomechanics using a wireless inertial sensors network 
using the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. The platform 
expands the frontiers of movement analysis for motion 
caption. Many other sensor networks deployments 
exist for a wheelchair to avoid collisions such as the 
one presented by Holly A. Yanco et al in [37] and the 
one presented by R W. Gunderson et al. [38]. Their 
development consisted on a range of sensors mounted 
onto wheelchairs to provide navigation feedback and 
obstacle detection. 
More sub-fields can be found but there are not so 
many deployments as the ones described before. One 
of them is to control drug administration in hospitals. 
Patients have sensor nodes that monitor their diseases 
and required medications. So, any doctor will prescribe 
always correctly drugs for that patient. In addition, 
doctors may also carry a sensor node, which allows 
other doctors to locate them within the hospital. The 
other one is the use of sensor networks to control and 
monitor epidemics produced in any place of the world. 
Maps of risk can be extracted using sensors, that is, 
knowing which places are infected or could be in the 
near future. 
Paulo Bartolomeu Vasco Santos et al. have 
combined both health care and home automation in 
[39]. This modular system is formed by different 
subsystems and it can combine them according to the 
patient needs. Its most interesting contribution is the 
capacity of automating the house. It is a great advance 
for reduced mobility people. For example, the system 
can open a door; close a window or turn down a blind. 
Besides, this system can sense some vital signals. 
A healthcare service for home has been presented 
by Nuri F.Ince et al. in [40]. It has a useful application 
for elderly and cognitively disabled people. This 
system is composed by several fixed sensors that 
locate a patient at home and, working together with 
wearable sensors, collect data to determine what 
bathroom activities are being done in order to know 
the state of the patient. 
To control the main vital statistics and the intensity 
and duration of rehabilitation exercises that a patient 
has to make at home is possible with the system 
proposed by Chris Otto et al. [41]. However, its main 
advantage is its ubiquity, that is, wherever the patient 
is placed. It is possible thanks to the combination of 
ZigBee (or Bluetooth) and a personal device like a 
mobile phone or personal digital assistant (PDA) with 
GPRS/3G data network connection. 
B. Real applications for the environment 
This type of applications should have a not-
invasive character in order to avoid alterations to the 
environment. Besides, it should be a robust and precise 
174

system in order transport all the data to the control 
point without errors. It should also be a low cost 
system, because it is implemented outdoors with 
batteries and maybe some nodes break down and 
should be replaced. Applications based on the 
detection of natural disasters, monitoring and control 
of agriculture, ecosystems and geophysical studies, 
flood detection, precision agriculture, biological 
complexity mapping of the environment and forest fire 
detection can be also included in this field. Some real 
applications for the environment are the following: 
At the island Great Duck, close the coasts of 
Maine, USA, there is a network of sensor nodes used 
for 
monitoring 
microclimates 
at 
refuges 
and 
surrounding areas where marine birds nest [42]. It 
allows investigators to supervise at-risk species and its 
habitats. Intel Research Laboratory in collaboration 
with Atlantic College (Bar Harbor) and University of 
California in Berkeley distributed 32 motes in the 
island. Each mote had a microcontroller, a low potency 
radio, a memory and some batteries to monitoring 
temperature, 
humidity, 
pressure, 
and 
infrared 
emissions at mid-range. Motes send their data to 
station bases of the island and they are connected to 
Internet by satellite to permit the access.  
A network of little sensors was placed in the River 
Ribble for disasters detection [43]. They monitor the 
water level and the flow preventing the flooding. The 
system obtains more data and with bigger precision 
than monitoring present-day systems and they provide 
the opportune photos of decision to prevent imminent 
risks. The final network consisted of three types of 
sensors. One measures the pressure under the water 
line to determine the depth and the others take care of 
the velocity of the flow of water, using ultrasounds 
underneath the surface and cameras web above it to 
accomplish a follow-up of objects. All these data are 
sent to a control point, in order to accomplish the 
opportune tasks according to the received data. 
 
A deployment of a network of sensors has been 
performed by the Australian agriculture departments 
[44]. It is intended to save great quantities of water, 
and to help to hold agriculture by using wireless sensor 
nodes. The system irrigates better than other systems, 
so it saves water. It has been set up in a greenhouse 
and in a vineyard with satisfactory results. 
 
A system to irrigate cotton fields at arid zones of 
Israel and Texas is shown in [45]. These systems are 
based on plantation temperature. Infrared sensors are 
localized near the trees and when they detect 
temperature superior to 82ºF for more the 4 hours, 
water is activated. It is proved that an optimum 
temperature for a correct growth of cotton is between 
73ºF and 90ºF. 
 
Fire Information and Rescue Equipment (FIRE) is 
a project developed by Berkeley’s Mechanical 
Engineering department and the Chicago Fire 
Department (CFD) [46]. Fire-fighting and catastrophes 
in general generate extremely chaotic environment, 
where it is decisive to make a fast decision. The 
possibility of having information about different 
aspects of the catastrophe in these situations becomes 
an inestimable value. The WSN is used to monitor the 
firemen, policeman, and other players in the building, 
sending to a central point the status of the fire, status of 
health, etc. Each fireman gathers data from the sensors 
(SmokeNet) with a small computer which has the maps 
of the building.  
There are also implementations for fire detection 
and verification, such as the one presented by the same 
authors of this paper in [47]. The system was 
developed to detect and monitor any fire in rural and 
forest environments, while it is being used to show the 
rural area to the visitors. It is composed of several 
wireless sensors distributed on an area and some 
wireless IP cameras. The information is distributed in a 
different manner based on the type of content delivered 
(video steaming, sensor information or sensor alarms). 
When a fire is detected by some sensor node, this send 
a signal to the server and the nearest camera focus this 
zone. The system has multiple video and sensor 
sources and two types of users: the regular users and 
the firefighters. An extension of this paper has been 
presented by the same authors in [48].  
The ALERT system [49] is the most significant 
example of the flood detection. In this system, there 
are several types of sensors that are deployed, such as 
rainfall, water level, and weather sensors. These 
sensors supply information to the centralized database 
system in a pre-defined way. 
The COUGAR Device Database Project [50] 
presented a distributed data management infrastructure 
where sensor nodes interact with in the field to provide 
snapshot and long-running queries. The system resides 
directly on the sensor nodes and creates the abstraction 
of a single processing node without centralizing data. 
Environmental 
Observations 
and 
Forecasting 
System (EOFS) is a large distributed system that spans 
large geographic areas and monitors, models and 
forecasts physical processes, such as environmental 
pollution, flooding, etc. Usually it consists of 3 
components: sensor stations, a distribution network, 
centralized processing farm [51]. 
There are also wireless sensor networks developed 
for food monitoring. G. Manes et al. presented in [52] 
a user defined scenario oriented to agro-food 
production phase monitoring. Their results show 
advantages both in terms of cost and complexity

reduction and experienced QoS enhancement as well. 
Several indoor environmental control researches can 
be found. The applications are focused on the control 
of the air conditioning in the buildings. These systems 
are based on sensors of temperature distributed in 
different plants of the building. These sensors take 
upon 
themselves 
to 
send 
information 
of 
the 
temperature to a central or distributed system and it 
takes the appropriate actions. 
C. Real deployments for industry 
WSNs 
can 
improve 
many 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
applications 
for 
monitoring 
office 
buildings, intelligent museums, industrial sensing, 
product quality control, robot control and guidance, 
etc. These areas are very different, but WSNs can be 
used in all of them in order to monitor and help to 
manage the systems. 
WSNs are also widely used for vehicle industry. 
They are used for a large variety of issues related with 
monitoring 
and 
control 
functions 
for 
motor 
management and systems of certainty and comfort 
(ASR, ABS, airbag, adjustment of the safety belt, air 
conditioning, etc.). Sensors are used to register the real 
status of the motor, motor’s pressure of oil, 
temperature of motor, the number of revolutions and 
so on. There are other types of applications, such as to 
detect car thefts [53] and sensor networks for vehicle 
tracking [54]. 
An example given about the use of sensors in 
production is the one presented by Jenna Burrell et al 
in [55].  Using ethnographic research methods, the 
authors studied the structure of work activities and the 
needs and priorities of people working in a vineyard in 
order to understand the potential for sensor networks 
in agriculture. They discovered a need for localization 
functions to track the movement of objects, people, 
and equipment through the vineyard.  
The application of WSNs in the household space is 
called smart house. We could have a system of remote 
metering with the networks of sensors, intelligent 
household appliances, a technical electric management 
of conditioning, illumination, water resources, home 
security, etc. There is a wireless sensor network 
deployment for light control in reference [56]. Fig. 2 
shows an example of a smart house with many types of 
sensors placed. 
 
Figure 2. Smart house. 
 
MeshNetics [57] has developed several sensor 
systems based on Zigbee for monitoring and control in 
building Automation.  
The “Wireless Space Count System” is a system 
used for parking management [58]. This application 
was developed by NEDAP in January 2007. It can 
count the number of free places in the parking, thanks 
to a wireless sensor network distributed on every 
parking place.  
In 
2006, 
a 
mote 
network 
was 
designed, 
implemented, deployed and tested on the Golden Gate 
Bridge in San Francisco by some researchers of the 
Centre for Information Technology Research of the 
University of California [59]. Their objective was to 
monitor its structural condition. Sixty-four motes were 
distributed over the main span and southern tower, 
comprising the largest wireless vibration sensor 
network ever installed for structural health monitoring 
purposes. The spatially dense array resulted in an 
increase in effective signal-to-noise ratio compared to 
single, isolated, sensors. The array also allowed the 
values obtained from both vertical and torsional, to be 
analyzed easily and accurately. 
Another interesting sensor application has been 
developed in the Loch Rannoch by BP. This project 
produced an efficient automated data collection system 
for machine monitoring and predictive maintenance 
that eliminated many of the manual processes by using 
handheld devices. It is equipped with 160 wireless 
motes [60]. 
 
There are applications that although they could be 
included in some aforementioned fields, they are also 
applications by themselves, e.g., intelligent nurseries 
personalized publicity, management of urban parking 
to know if there are empty places and where they are, 
and notification of the status of traffic at a city to know 
what way is the best-suited to get to a destination or to 
inform of the situation of the traffic at places where 
cameras do not cover up.

Finally, like a curious application, the interactive 
art is presented. Asholk Sukumaran presented the 
“Park View Hotel” in [61]. Using specially-built 
pointing devices, audiences in the park can access 
interior hotel spaces, by "pinging" them optically. 
Passers-by can emit infrared rays from several points 
of the street, and active sensors inside the building can 
illuminate rooms and change the colours. The color of 
the interior propagates leaking out of the building skin, 
jumping across the street, and entering some street-
lights in the park below. The park enjoys a certain 
neighbourly access to the hotel, inverting the usual 
character of the relationship. 
There are also some sensors deployments used to 
monitor the environment without battery that generate 
their energy from the environment. An example is the 
one developed by Enocean [62]. These sensors can 
produce 50 miliwatts, with variations of 3 degrees. 
Embedded EnOcean radios transmit around 300 meters 
in a free field or 30 meters in indoor (with walls and 
obstacles). Fig. 3 shows the schematic of free wireless 
sensors using ambient energy 
There are other implementations published, but 
they appear in informative articles, so the technical 
depth is very low. On the other hand, there are motes 
developers, which products can be used in many types 
of applications. 
D. Real deployments for military applications 
The need of WSNs emerged during the Cold-War, 
especially for submarine surveillance and battlefield 
monitoring. But it was not available for the public use 
until the 1980s, when the first commercial distributed 
sensor network was developed by the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This 
WSN is called first-generation. 
We can find several applications based on WSNs 
for 
service-based 
C4ISR 
(Command, 
Control, 
Communications, 
Computers, 
Intelligence, 
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) [63]. They can help 
or can be part of a military system due to some their 
embedded features like their rapid deployment, self-
organization, and fault tolerance [64]. Wireless sensor 
networks can be an integral part of defense/offensive 
military systems [65].  
Typical military applications of sensor networks 
are: 
• 
Monitoring forces: reconnaissance of opposing 
forces and terrain and battlefield surveillance 
• 
Monitoring of equipment and ammunition 
• 
Targeting 
• 
Battle damage assessment 
• 
Nuclear, biological and chemical attack detection 
and reconnaissance 
• 
"fog of war" clearing 
• 
Space exploration  
• 
Undersea monitoring 
Rockwell Scientific has been working with the 
U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army to test and refine 
WSN performance in desert, forest, and urban terrain. 
For the urban terrain, WSNs are expected to improve 
troop safety as they clear and monitor intersections, 
buildings, and rooftops by providing continuous 
vigilance for unknown troop and vehicle activity [66]. 
E.  General Purpose Indoor Location and Location 
tracking systems 
Several position detection and location tracking 
systems based in wireless sensor networks exist. On 
the other hand, the growth of wireless networks caused 
multiple possibilities to calculate position. In indoor 
location, the main issue is that the system has to 
consider walls losses, interferences, multipath effect, 
humidity, temperature variations, etc. 
One of the main applications of the Indoor Location 
and Location tracking systems is to locate people with 
Alzheimer or to locate disabled people with very little 
motion. An example of this kind of systems using the 
Zigbee technology was presented by Li-wei Chan et al. 
in [67].  
MIT’s Cricket [68] is an indoor location system 
which uses ultrasounds to determinate user’s location 
that are moving in indoors, using mobile and fix nodes. 
Based on this system, interactive maps, personal 
location and access control to certain resources have 
been developed. 
Jaime Lloret et al. [69] have analyzed two 
approaches where wireless sensors could find their 
position using WLAN technology inside a floor of a 
building. The first approach uses a training session and 
the position is based on a heuristic system using the 
training measurements. The second approach uses 
triangulation model with some fixed access points, but 
taking into account wall losses and signal variations. 
Both approaches are based on the Received Signal 
Strength Indicator (RSSI). Then, the authors compare 
their deployments with other deployments in [70]. 
Moreover, the same authors of this paper developed 
a new stochastic approach [71], which is based on a 
combination of deductive and inductive methods. In 
this system, wireless sensors can find their position 
using WLAN technology inside a floor of a building. 
Fundamental advantage of this system is that reduces 
the training phase in an indoor environment; but, 
without losing precision.

V. COMPARATIVE STUDY 
A comparative of the practical deployments 
presented in this paper is shown in table II. Not all the 
works presented have been added because some of 
them have been published without any technical depth 
and some main information was missing. The S letter 
means that the network has a small (few meters), M 
means medium size (from few meters to less than 1 
Km), L means large size (more than 1 Km). In the 
communications type column we have used C when 
the information is sent to a server in order to process it 
and D when the information is distributed in the 
sensors. We added the “Single use” column in order to 
show if the deployment could be used in other 
environment or only in the environment where it has 
been created. When some information is not provided 
by the authors we used a dash “-“. 
In order to show our conclusions from this 
comparative, we provide the following graphs, in order 
to show the global view of the state of the art of the 
practical deployments. 
Fig. 4 shows that most of the deployments are 
medium, but there is not so much difference with the 
number of large and small size networks. Although 
many researchers study the scalability of the sensor 
networks, they are most used to cover less than 1 Km. 
When wireless technologies are compared (see Fig. 
5), we can observe that the most used technology has 
been Wi-Fi and the second one has been ZigBee. 
There are many implementations that use several types 
of technologies in their deployments. 
Fig. 6 shows that there are more decentralized 
implementations than centralized implementations, but 
the difference is quite low. 
Almost 
all 
the 
implementations 
have 
been 
performed for its specific purpose without the 
possibility of being able to be used in other 
implementations. Fig. 7 shows the measurements 
obtained. 
Fig. 8 shows the comparison of the domains of the 
studied WSNs. We can see that WSNs are most used 
for health. The second domain has been agriculture 
and environment. This comparative gives us a view of 
where WSNs are most applied. 
Finally, table III shows which sensor, software and 
hardware are used by some of the real deployments 
aforementioned. Not all the deployments appear 
because not all of them provide this information. In 
table III, N/A means that the information is not 
available. 
 
VI. LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES 
Generally, wireless sensor networks are deployed to 
work in hostile, remote and changeable environments, 
so it is necessary to incorporate security mechanisms 
when they are being designed. However, several 
limitations should be taken into account. 
First, nodes can't be protected physically in these 
environments. For example, in a battlefield any enemy 
can capture them and analyze the information 
gathered, so, fundamental information could be 
extracted. 
The 
challenge 
for 
researchers 
and 
developers is to design resilient protocols or others 
solutions to provide security to these networks, even if 
one or several sensor nodes are compromised. Their 
goal is to ensure that, if a node is captured, sensitive 
information stored on it cannot be taken off easily. 
Another issue to be considered is the random 
distribution of sensor nodes. When a sensor network is 
deployed in a hostile environment, it is done through a 
random distribution. So, in this case, to gather several 
encryption keys on nodes, in order to establish 
encryption among a group of neighbours, isn't 
possible, because the neighbourhood cannot be known 
a priori. So, the challenge is to design key agreement 
protocols that do not require neighbourhood between 
nodes, and also do not require storing encryption keys 
on sensors before the deployment.  
On the other hand, the small size of the sensor 
nodes and the lack of wires is another important 
limitation of WSNs. Although these characteristics are 
fundamental for many applications, it involves limited 
resources, such as the energy, computational power, 
and storage resources. Besides, a large WSN contains 
hundreds to thousands nodes working by batteries, so, 
it is difficult both to replace and recharge them in some 
environments.

The 
communication 
between 
sensor 
nodes 
consumes most part of the sensor energy, much more 
than sensing and computation. Any encryption 
algorithm to guarantee a secure communication 
introduces a communication overhead between nodes, 
because it is necessary to exchange more messages, for 
example 
for 
authentication, 
initialization 
and 
encryption data. So, the adoption of strong and 
computationally expensive cryptographic algorithms, 
such as the RSA public key algorithm, is not an 
efficient 
idea. 
Instead, 
symmetric 
encryption 
algorithms are used because they don’t require as 
computational power as asymmetric encryption. 
However, 
providing 
security 
with 
symmetric 
encryption is limited. Therefore, another challenge for 
researchers is to design other security solutions to 
cover the weaknesses of symmetric encryption and so, 
establishing a secure communication among the nodes 
participating in a communication.  
The limited capability of sensor nodes for storage is 
another problem for security algorithms. Each sensor 
node needs to store as different keys as sensor nodes 
network has. However, when a network is composed 
by a large number of sensor nodes, it requires a lot of 
memory, which probably cannot be provided. If a 
single encryption key common to all nodes is used, an 
enemy could compromise the whole network by 
compromising only a single node. So, the challenge to 
make up for storage restrictions is to design security 
protocols that minimize the number of keys must be 
used to provide adequate protection to the network. 
There many theoretical works that propose security 
systems, but we have not found any wireless sensor 
network deployment with security published. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
WSNs are needed to improve the quality of life of 
the disabled people. They are also a basic piece of the 
future medical applications. These reasons make 
WSNs a main research area for many research groups. 
WSNs help the humans to control, examine and survey 
places that they are not able to do because it is very 
difficult to achieve the place or because the human is 
not able to measure by itself.  
Actually, 
more 
research 
is 
needed 
and 
developments of new sensors in order to get cheaper 
products and make them affordable. Lower prizes will 
help to introduce WSNs in our life. 
All surveys on WSNs found in the literature show 
simulations and network tests in reduced and 
controlled environments, but this survey shows real 
implementations and practical deployments. There is 
not any survey published like the one presented in this 
paper. 
We have compared the real deployments studied in 
this paper in terms of network size, technology used, 
the communication type, if it has being built for a 
single use and the domain where it is applied.
