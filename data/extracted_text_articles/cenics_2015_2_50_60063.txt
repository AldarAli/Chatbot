Abstract A 94 GHz down-conversion mixer for image radar 
sensors using standard 90 nm CMOS technology is reported. The 
down-conversion mixer comprises a double-balanced Gilbert cell 
with peaking inductors between RF transconductance stage and 
LO switching transistors for Conversion Gain (CG) enhancement 
and Noise Figure (NF) suppression, a Marchand balun for 
converting the single RF input signals to differential signals, 
another Marchand balun for converting the single LO input 
signals to differential signals, and an IF amplifier. The mixer 
consumes 22.5 mW and achieves excellent RF-port input 
reflection coefficient of 7.1~ 35.9 dB for frequencies of 82.6~96 
GHz, and LO-port input reflection coefficient of 10~ 35.9 dB 
for frequencies of 88.2~110 GHz. In addition, the mixer achieves 
CG of 3.4~ 6.4 dB for frequencies of 85~97 GHz (the 
corresponding 3-dB CG bandwidth is 12 GHz) and LO-RF 
isolation of 41~47.2 dB for frequencies of 90~100 GHz, one of the 
best CG and LO-RF isolation results ever reported for a down-
conversion mixer with operation frequency around 94 GHz. 
Furthermore, the mixer achieves an excellent input third-order 
intercept point (IIP3) of 3 dBm at 94 GHz. These results 
demonstrate the proposed down-conversion mixer architecture is 
promising for 94 GHz image radar sensors.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, several excellent GaAs down-conversion mixers 
for operation frequencies around 94 GHz have been reported 
[1]-[3]. For example, in [1], a 90~112 GHz image reject down-
conversion mixer with an improved Lange coupler in 0.15 m 
GaAs PHEMT process is demonstrated. Though wide 
bandwidth of 22 GHz was achieved, its performances, such as 
CG of 10 dB, LO-RF isolation of 30 dB, and chip area of 4 
mm2 are not good enough. In [2], a 90~97 GHz single balanced 
down-conversion mixer using a rat-race hybrid ring with five 
ports and two GaAs Schottky diodes is reported. Though wide 
bandwidth of 7 GHz was achieved, its conversion gain of 
12.6 is not satisfactory. In [3], a 94 GHz single balanced 
down-conversion mixer using branch line couplers in 0.1 m 
GaAs process is demonstrated. Similarly, its performances, 
such as CG of 14.7 dB, LO-RF isolation of 34.2 dB, and chip 
area of 3.38 mm2 are not good enough. In this work, to 
demonstrate that low power dissipation (< 25 mW), high CG (> 
 dB), excellent LO-RF isolation (> 40 dB) and small chip

conversion mixer with excellent CG, 3-dB bandwidth (3dB) 
and port-to-port isolation properties using cost-effective 
standard 90 nm CMOS technology. In Section 2, circuit design 
is introduced. In Section 3, we demonstrate the measurement 
results and provide some discussions. Section 4 presents the 
conclusion. 
 
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN 
The 94 GHz down-conversion mixer was designed and 
implemented in a standard 90 nm CMOS process provided by a 
commercial foundry. This technology offers 9 metal layers, 
named MT1 to MT9 from bottom to top. The thickness of MT9 
is 3.4 m, and that of MT8, MT7~MT2 and MT1 is 0.85 m, 
0.31 m and 0.24 m, respectively. The interconnection lines 
as well as the microstrip-line (MSL) inductors were 
implemented with the 3.4-m-thick topmost metal to minimize 
the resistive loss. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the 
proposed 94 GHz down-conversion mixer.  
Figure 2(a) shows the schematic of the 94 GHz CMOS 
down-conversion mixer. The mixer comprises a double-
balanced Gilbert cell, a miniature wideband Marchand balun 
for converting the single RF input signal to differential signal, 
another miniature wideband Marchand balun for converting the 
single LO input signal to differential signal, and an IF 
amplifier (which constitutes a resistive source-degeneration IF 
differential amplifier followed by a source-follower IF buffer 
amplifier). Note that the double-balanced Gilbert cell has 
peaking inductors between RF transconductance stage and LO 
switching transistors for CG improvement and NF suppression. 
With the addition of the tail current source comprising 
transistor M7 and resistor R9, the RF transconductance stage 
operates as an elegant, yet robust differential pair. The current 
of the tail current source is also mirrored to the IF buffer 
amplifier constitutes transistors M10~M13 and resistors R12~R13. 
The driving current of the IF buffer amplifier can be tuned by 
varying the resistance of resistors R12~R13. The chip 
micrograph of the mixer is shown in Figure 2(b). The chip area 
is only 0.690.84 mm2 excluding the test pads. 
Figure 3(a) shows the schematic diagram of the Marchand 
balun used in the mixer. It is designed based on the "lumped-
element" Marchand balun structure proposed in [4]. Such a 
balun structure is advantageous in terms of its excellent 
amplitude/phase match and broadband response compared with 
the traditional single-to-differential transformers. Instead of the 
area-consumed straight-line or U-shaped MSL structures, the 
miniature spiral coil MSL structure, i.e. with the patterned MT1 
ground plane (with MT1 density of about 56%) underneath and 
around the MSL structure, as shown in Figure 3(b), is adopted 
to implement the needed inductor elements in the baluns. The 
metal width and space are 4 m and 2 m, respectively. The 
balun consists of an unbalanced input (Port 1) with 50  
terminal impedance, an open terminal (O.C.), two short 
terminals (GND) and two balanced outputs (Port 2 and Port 3)

with 50  terminal impedance. Note that the coils of the balun 
are implemented by the 3.4-m-thick topmost metal (MT9) to 
minimize the resistive loss. Only the underpass interconnection 
lines are realized by MT8. 
Figure 3(c) shows the lump-element balun equivalent 
circuit [4]. The spiral coil couple-line is modeled by the lump 
inductor L, and the capacitor C models the coupling 
capacitance effect produced from the spiral coil couple-line. 
That is, the capacitors are realized as the parasitic components 
of the inductors. Port 1 is the unbalanced RF input port (or LO 
output port), and port 2 and port 3 are the balanced RF+ and 
RF output port (or LO+ and LO input port), respectively. In 
a network, this lump-element balun can be regarded as an out-
of-phase power splitter, including a parallel-connected high-
pass filter and a band-pass filter. The signals through the 
output ports of the ideal balun have equal power but are 180o 
out-of-phase; all ports (except the O.C. port) have an input 
impedance of 50 i.e. Z0.

simulated 10 dB input matching bandwidth at RF-port is 5.7 
GHz. What is also shown in Figure 4(a) is the simulated input

reflection coefficients at LO-port (S22) versus LO frequency 
characteristics of the down-conversion mixer. The mixer 
achieves S22 of 12.8 dB at 94 GHz, and S22 smaller than 10 
dB for RF frequencies of 85~110.2 GHz. That is, the simulated 
10 dB input matching bandwidth at LO-port is 25.2 GHz. 
Figure 4(b) shows the simulated input reflection 
coefficients at IF-port (S33) versus IF frequency characteristics 
of the down-conversion mixer. The mixer achieves excellent 
S33 of 10.3~ 15.3 dB for IF frequencies of 0~3 GHz. 
Figure 5 shows the simulated CG versus frequency 
characteristics of the mixer both with and without the IF 
amplifier. RF input power is 40 dBm and LO input power is 4 
dBm. The mixer achieves CG of 8.7 dB at 94 GHz, and CG of 
~8.72 dB for frequencies of 90~100 GHz, one of the best 
CG results ever reported for a down-conversion mixer with 
operation frequency around 94 GHz. The corresponding 3-dB 
bandwidth is larger than 21.8 GHz (78.2~100 GHz). In the 
case without the IF amplifier, the mixer achieves inferior CG 
of 0.84 dB at 94 GHz, and CG of 0.36~0.85 dB for frequencies 
of 90~100 GHz. The corresponding 3-dB bandwidth is larger 
than 21.1 GHz (78.9~100 GHz). 
 
 
III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
On-wafer measurements were performed by an Agilent’s 
110 GHz RFIC measurement system. The down-conversion 
mixer is biased in the condition of VDD = 1.3 V and IDD = 17.3 
mA. That is, the simulated power consumption of the mixer is 
22.5 mW. Figure 6(a) shows the measured S11. The mixer 
achieves excellent S11 of 8.3 dB at 94 GHz, and S11 of 7.1~ 
35.9 dB for frequencies of 82.6~96 GHz. Figure 6(b) shows 
the measured S22. The mixer achieves excellent S22 of 14.9 
dB at 94 GHz, and S22 of 10~ 35.9 dB for frequencies of 
88.2~110 GHz. That is, the measured 10 dB LO input 
matching bandwidth is larger than 21.8 GHz. 
Figure 7 shows the measured CG versus frequency 
characteristics of the down-conversion mixer. The mixer 
achieves maximum CG of 3.4 dB at 91 GHz and CG of 3.4~ 
6.4 dB for frequencies of 85~97 GHz, one of the best CG 
results ever reported for a down-conversion mixer with 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
operation frequency around 94 GHz. The corresponding 3-dB 
bandwidth is 12 GHz (85~97 GHz).  
Figure 8 shows the measured LO-RF isolation versus 
frequency characteristics of the mixer. The mixer achieves LO-
RF isolation of 41~47.2 dB for frequencies of 90~100 GHz, 
one of the best LO-RF isolation results ever reported for a 
down-conversion mixer with operation frequency around 94 
GHz. Furthermore, the mixer achieves an excellent IIP3 of 3 
dBm at 94 GHz (not shown here). 
Figure 9 shows the measured and simulated NF versus 
frequency characteristics of the down-conversion mixer. As 
can be seen, the measured results conform with the simulated 
ones well. The mixer achieves NF of 23.2 dB at 94 GHz, and 
NF of 22.4~24.4 dB for frequencies of 90~100 GHz. 
Table I is a summary of the implemented 90~100 GHz 
CMOS down-conversion mixer, and recently reported state-of-
the-art down-conversion mixers with operation frequency 
around 94 GHz. Compared with the 90~112 GHz image reject 
down-conversion mixer in [1], the proposed mixer exhibits 
better CG and LO-RF isolation, and smaller chip area. 
Compared with the 90~97 GHz single balanced GaAs down-
conversion mixer in [2], the proposed mixer exhibits better CG. 
Compared with the 94 GHz single balanced GaAs down-
conversion mixer in [3], the proposed mixer exhibits better CG 
and LO-RF isolation, and smaller chip area. These results 
indicate that our proposed down-conversion mixer is suitable 
for W-band transceiver systems. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this work, we reported a 90~100 GHz CMOS down-
conversion mixer comprises a double-balanced Gilbert-cell, a 
miniature wideband RF Marchand balun, a miniature 
wideband LO Marchand balun, and an IF amplifier. The 
mixer consumes 22.5 mW and achieves excellent CG of 3.4~ 
6.4 dB for frequencies of 85~97 GHz, that is, the 
corresponding 3-dB bandwidth of RF is 12 GHz. Moreover, 
excellent LO-RF isolation is also achieved. These results 
highlight the potential application of the proposed down-
conversion mixer architecture in 94 GHz and even higher 
frequency communication systems.
