Abstract—The Geospatially Enabled Ecosystem for Europe 
(GeoE3) project has commenced with the main goal to develop 
use case-oriented, cross-border and cross-domain geospatial 
services conforming to the second-generation interface 
standards. The five-nation project focusses on cross-domain 
integration of content by applying dynamic, service level 
methods for joining meteorological and statistical data with 
geospatial features. Various technologies will be tested for 
providing seamless, cross-border access to geospatial resources 
in context of the new Open Geospatial Consortium’s family of 
service interface standards. 3D aspects of geospatial data will 
also be considered, both from content encoding and service 
interface point of view. The project aims at supporting 
renewable energy- and smart city-related applications.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In an interoperable computing environment, every 
participating actor should gain benefits. This is the main 
guiding principle in the spatial data ecosystems currently 
being developed. A major action, Geospatially Enabled 
Ecosystem for Europe (GeoE3), has commenced to establish 
an ecosystem of use case-oriented geospatial services in five 
European countries [1]. The action is part of the Connecting 
Europe Facility (CEF) programme advancing European 
transport, energy and digital infrastructure development [2]. 
The project runs for three years and involves five national 
mapping and cadastral agencies, together with a few other 
governmental organizations and private companies. The main 
goals of the project include adaptation of modern geospatial 
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to establish 
cross-border services for renewable energy and urbanization 
related use cases, use of dynamic service-level mechanisms 
for cross-domain content integration, and promotion of the 
developed approaches through extensive online innovation 
and education programme. 
GeoE3 consortium membership includes the national 
mapping or cadastral agency from Finland, Norway, Estonia, 
The Netherlands and Spain. Furthermore, the consortium 
includes the national meteorological and statistical agency of 
Finland: Finnish Meteorological Institute and Statistics 
Finland, respectively. Private companies include Spatineo 
from Finland and Aventi Intelligent Communication from 
Norway. Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Europe 
participates in the project as a representative of the 
standardization community. National Land Survey of Finland 
coordinates the project that will be finalized by Sep 2023 [3]. 
The main use cases identified by GeoE3 include 
renewable energy applications, specifically in the context of 
buildings construction and use. In particular, this involves 
solar energy potential, based on solar panels on rooftops. 
Wind energy and heating/cooling facilities of the buildings are 
considered too. The other use cases deal with traffic 
applications, in particular efficient use of electric cars, and 
with various urbanization challenges. The last one is 
considering urban expansion efficiency employing the United 
Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 
11.3.1 ‘Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth 
rate’ [4]. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the 
envisioned service architecture of the GeoE3 platform is 
described. Section III discusses various mechanisms for 
content integration. In Section IV, some novel ideas 
concerning OAPIF functionality are discussed. Section V 
presents the initial considerations of the project on dealing 
with 3D geodata. The paper ends with conclusions in Section 
VI. 
II. 
SERVICE ARCHITECTURE 
The GeoE3 project aims at establishing a set of use case -
oriented services that enable content integration both across 
national borders and domain boundaries. The idea is to set up 
an integration layer on top of national services. The 
integration layer would provide modern service interfaces to 
the client side and accommodate various categories of source 
services on country level. The GeoE3 services are to be based 
on the OGC API family of second-generation, internationally 
standardized service interfaces [5]. These include services like 
OGC API Features [6], OGC API Coverages and OGC API 
Records. Internally the GeoE3 platform will apply at least 
OGC API Processes [7] for introducing analysis-based 
content layers to the clients and Table Joining Service (TJS) 
[8] for content integration across domain boundaries. OGC 
API Environment Data Retrieval (EDR) [9] interface will be 
used for requesting meteorological data, particularly for 
supporting transport-related applications.

The illustration in Figure 1 shows the envisaged GeoE3 
service architecture. The WxS box in the left bottom corner 
represents all the country level data resources that will mostly 
be accessed through service access points conforming to the 
OGC standard interfaces, like WFS, WCS and the OGC API 
family of services. The databases at the bottom emphasize the 
GeoE3 goal of integrating spatial data with statistical and 
other tabular data sets. All the data resources will be made 
available via modern interface standards and be integrated in 
a cross-border manner by the GeoE3 integration platform. 
Metadata records of all GeoE3 services will be stored into the 
European Data Portal (EDP) and also be available from the 
OGC API Records service interface maintained on the GeoE3 
platform. An implementation of the TJS standard is an 
essential component of the GeoE3 service architecture. It will 
be responsible for joining tabular data sets with geospatial 
features. The resulting combined resource is then made 
accessible to client applications via OGC API Features 
services. 
 
III. 
CONTENT INTEGRATION 
A. Content Integration with OAPIF 
An essential component on the GeoE3 integration layer is 
OGC API Features (OAPIF) service interface. The successor 
for the OGC’s Web Feature Service (WFS) interface 
specification, OAPIF follows the principles of the so-called 
REST (Representational State Transfer) service architecture. 
The output of the service consists of individual geospatial 
features, organized as a GeoJSON -encoded feature collection 
[10], geometries expressed in WGS84 Coordinate Reference 
System (CRS). The OAPIF service instance offers a set of data 
collections, accessible from the given service address paths. 
This provides a natural setting for organizing individual 
countries’ data sets as collections inside a single OAPIF 
instance. For instance, the buildings data sets of Finland, 
Norway and Spain could be organized as follows. 
 
• 
/geoe3/buildings/collections/buildings_FI/items 
• 
/geoe3/buildings/collections/buildings_NO/items 
• 
/geoe3/buildings/collections/buildings_ES/items 
 
 
The OAPIF implementation adopted in the GeoE3 
platform is the OAPIF reference implementation, called 
pygeoapi [11], a Python library supporting OAPIF and 
partially supporting OGC API Coverages [12], OGC API 
Tiles and OGC API Processes. pygeoapi provides a flexible 
plugin architecture for content provision and formatting. The 
off-the-shelf library supports, via OpenGIS Simple Features 
Reference Implementation (OGR) [13] and rasterio [14] 
provider plugins, a vast array of vector and raster source 
formats and services. For example, WFS is supported as 
source service. OGR provider also supports OAPIF service 
access, thus enabling cascading OAPIF service approaches. 
Specific project-related needs can be accommodated by 
developing a tailored plugin. As the plugin architecture is 
based on Python language, all the Python-based geospatial 
libraries can be easily utilized. The set of already available 
preliminary GeoE3 components include plugins for WFS 
versions 1.1.0 and 2.0.0 with basic schema transformation 
capabilities, and a plugin for WCS version 1.0.0. 
 
B. Content Integration with OGC API Processes 
OGC API Processes is a new resource-based process 
definition standard. The standard defines how the client 
program can start the process and how the process inputs are 
provided, and where the results of the process are stored.  
Computational tasks are wrapped inside the process and 
the results are provided to the client application. Processes can 
be for example geometry buffering or routing from point A to 
point B. The process can be either synchronous, giving the 
result immediately, or asynchronous, in which case the service 
informs the client, when the results are ready and where they 
can be found. 
The GeoE3 project develops a process, in which the 
footprint of a building is taken as a starting point and the 3D 
geometry of the building is analysed using the Digital Surface 
Model (DSM). In addition, a process is being developed to 
calculate the average amount of solar energy in a building 
area. This dynamically created information can then be 
integrated back to the original features. 
The OGC API Processes interface standard follows the 
same principles as the other OGC API standards (e.g., 
OAPIF). The path structure of the GeoE3 OGC API Processes 
services might be as follows.

C. Content Integration with Table Joining Service 
OGC Table Joining Service (TJS) provides a method for 
joining spatial and tabular data. The standard is currently 
being revised by the OGC and the new draft standard is going 
to be used in GeoE3 [15]. It allows integration of statistical 
(tabular) data to the platform. 
To carry out the join, the service needs the spatial and 
tabular data and a common identifier between them. Several 
columns of the tabular data can be joined at once. Both the 
spatial and tabular data can either be configured to be 
available from the server or they can be uploaded on demand. 
Spatial data can thus be delivered via OGC Features APIs and 
tabular data, e.g., via PX Web API. 
The goal of the project is to evaluate the fitness for purpose 
of TJS in the use cases identified in the project. A TJS instance 
will be set up and configured, along with a browser-based end 
user interface. While TJS can be demonstrated and used with 
a user interface, it can be more valuable when used in the 
background as a part of an automated process. The obvious 
benefit of joining data is that spatial data need not be stored in 
several places. 
The output of a TJS has several options. The combined 
data can be downloaded for further use in several spatial 
formats, such as GeoJSON. Furthermore, results from the 
joining operation can be calculated from the data. This 
includes information about successful joins, unsuccessful 
joins and extra data rows. In the project this derived data will 
be visualized in the user interface as a report for the user. 
 
IV. 
OAPIF RETHOUGHT 
Some of the OAPIF concepts have been rethought in the 
development of the preliminary GeoE3 platform. For instance, 
the HTML-formatted feature browsing in the OAPIF 
development is understood as a tabular presentation of feature 
properties, browsed through the feature collection page by 
page. When there are potentially millions of features in the 
national databases, and when the order of features presented 
is arbitrary, the browsing process becomes unfeasible. The 
feature browsing in the GeoE3 OAPIF is returned back to the 
traditional spatially organized, map-based browsing. A plain 
background map is first shown to the user. The individual 
vector features are requested and presented only when the user 
zooms in deep enough. 
Another new concept introduced in the GeoE3 project is 
the idea of treating the HTML-formatted visualization of an 
individual spatial feature as an application-specific dashboard 
of the feature [16]. Into this dashboard, a wide set of feature 
properties and visualizations can be collected by the GeoE3 
integration platform. For example, a sun energy-related 
building dashboard could contain all the relevant building 
attributes - like the area, volume and heating information, and 
the DSM from the building’s area - useful for solar energy 
analyses. Furthermore, climate-related information could be 
integrated to the same dashboard on the GeoE3 platform by 
accessing appropriate values from a meteorological service. 
The dashboard could be seen as a shop window for the 
available content, and could later be downloaded into a digital 
analysis process as the corresponding JSON-formatted data 
set. An example of a prototypical building dashboard for 
renewable energy related applications is shown in Figure 2. 
OAPIF browsing by map view is shown on the left. On the 
right, a detail window of the selected feature (The Finnish 
Parliament) is shown, together with the DSM rendered inside 
the building footprint, and average speed of wind in the area 
shown below.

energy dashboard from the GeoE3 platform. 
V. 
3D CONSIDERATIONS 
The GeoE3 project introduces the idea of HTML-
formatted application-specific dashboard, especially in the 
context of building construction and use with renewable 
energy applications, such as solar energy potential. While 
computing the energy potential, many data sources and 
service interfaces can be utilized, depending on the computing 
tasks in hand. Using gridded Digital Elevation Models 
(DEMs), DSMs and building footprints, one can automatically 
compute a 2D raster layer that indicates rooftops suitable for 
solar energy production. This raster layer can then be 
portrayed together with the DSM and the orthophoto for 3D 
visual exploration. 
In the exemplary visualization shown in Figure 3, 
locations suitable for solar panels are presented with yellow 
colour. The visualization is a result of a parameterized on-the-
fly process, in which the DMS slope and aspect values are 
used, together with the building footprints and the height 
difference between the DSM and the DEM, to compute the 
areas well exposed to sun energy. Figure 3 shows a three.js-
based [17] Web application that requests the analysis result

layer and the DSM from OGC-compatible service interfaces 
and drapes the raster on top of the DSM. Corresponding 
visualization could also be integrated as part of the GeoE3’s 
HTML-based feature dashboard.

Analysis is based on the use of DSM slope and aspect values, height 
differences between the DSM and the DEM, and building footprints. 
 
One of the goals of the GeoE3 project is to make use of 
3D vector data, provided that project partners are able to 
produce 3D data during the project’s lifetime. For instance, 
the project coordinator, NLS Finland, aims at making 3D 
building models available by the end of 2021. The production 
process is based on the use of the building footprints and 
DSM, and aims at constructing LoD2 category building 
geometries. A widely accepted, production-level service 
interface specification for 3D models does not exist yet. A 
possible workaround for this situation is to store the 3D 
geometries into a 3DCityDB database and export them as a 
CityGML, CityJSON or gltf -formatted file on demand. 
At this moment, CityJSON format is the most interesting 
proposal for the 3D vector representation. CityJSON is a 
JSON-based subset of the OGC’s CityGML [18] data model 
and is designed for storage and transfer of 3D city models. 
CityJSON is not yet standardized by the OGC, but is currently 
being considered as an official OGC Community Standard. 
Current version of the CityJSON standard is available at the 
CityJSON development site [19]. 
Freely 
available 
browser-based 
applications 
for 
visualization of CityGML does not yet exist. However, JSON 
processing is widely supported in browsers, and CityJSON 
can naturally benefit from this too [20]. There are 
development initiatives for providing an easy-to-use 
CityJSON-supporting 
software 
component 
for 
Web 
applications. On the left side in Figure 4, an example is 
presented of browser-based visualization displaying NLS 
Finland buildings in CityJSON format utilizing a software 
component called Ninja [21]. On the right side in Figure 4, the 
same features are presented using the 3D map view of the 
QGIS application [22]. GeoE3 is also interested in utilizing 
3D Tiles, an OGC Community Standard for visualizing 3D 
geospatial content in desktop, Web and mobile applications 
[23].

VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
GeoE3 project has commenced with the main goal of 
developing a geospatially enabled ecosystem of use case-
oriented services conforming to modern, second-generation 
interface standards. The project will tackle the challenge of 
cross-border and cross-domain integration of content 
employing a flexible, state-of-the-art development platform, 
based on OGC API Python library called pygeoapi. The 
plugin architecture of pygeoapi facilitates development of 
tailored components for connecting the platform to various 
different country level source services. 
The overall service architecture of the GeoE3 project can 
be seen as a three-tier architecture with country level services 
forming the bottom data layer. The GeoE3 integration 
platform with advanced capabilities for dynamic content 
integration and use case-specific adaptation of the resulting 
data sets works as the middle processing layer. Finally, end 
user applications form the third architecture layer.  
An application-specific output from an OAPIF service can 
be provided in the form of an html-formatted dashboard of the 
feature in focus. Based on the user needs, an appropriate set 
of information items can be collected and put together by the 
GeoE3 platform, and the resulting data set be formatted in 
html as a shop window for potential users. Finally, the same 
data set could be requested as a JSON-encoded package, to be 
fed into an external analysis process. 
The project will continue developing the described 
functionalities over the coming two and half years and aims at 
wide adoption of the services by actors working in the 
identified use case domains.
