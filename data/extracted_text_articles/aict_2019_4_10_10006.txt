Abstract—The worldwide broadband demand is increasing.
However, often the research regards the demand for a better
broadband availability and higher broadband connection
speeds on the base of residential broadband demand, whereas
the
need for
higher bandwidths
and estimation
of
the
broadband
performance
of
enterprises
are
mostly
unconsidered. Since only a few market analyses explicitly
include the broadband requirements of companies, these
requirements have been given little attention in Germany up to
now. To deepen the research-based knowledge about the needs
of enterprises regarding the usage of broadband connections, a
survey of enterprises in Germany (with focus on the Rhein-
Main area) has been performed. Based on the analysis, the
broadband performance, which are available for enterprises,
with special regard of the received broadband connection
speeds and the price-performance ratio, this study, shows that
the satisfaction of companies depends in particular on the
extent to which broadband access covers their future needs and
less on the current situation.

INTRODUCTION
On the base of the upcoming digitization of workflows
and an increasing linkage between different enterprise
locations and between enterprises and customers in the
virtual world, the broadband provision and the availability
of high broadband connection speeds get more and more
important for enterprises in the business and industry sector
[1]. Since the availability of broadband accesses is a key
factor for enterprise and private household settlement,
broadband accesses need to be stable, appropriate to the
needs and comprehensively available [2]-[7].
Based on the economic significance of a sufficient
broadband provision for enterprises, a situation analysis
about the current broadband provision of enterprises is
necessary. In this context, an online survey has been
conducted to figure out how the enterprises in Germany
(with
focus
on
the
Rhein-Main
area)
evaluate
the
performance and sufficiency of their current broadband
provision. Here, information about the currently achieved
broadband
connection
speeds,
the
perceived
price-
performance ratio and the satisfaction about the broadband
performance has been also collected by the survey. The
main intention was to identify how enterprises experience
the performance of their current broadband access and if the
performance will be sufficient for the future by satisfying
the enterprise needs regarding the different kinds of
business purposes and activities.
Therefore, the paper is structured as follows. After the
introduction, the second section covers the literature review.
Here, the first subsection contains an in-depth definition of
broadband. The second subsection of the literature review
regards the challenges by the consideration of the enterprise
broadband demand. The following subsection compromises
the conceptual model and the set hypotheses. Based on the
structure of these three subsections, the next section presents
the methodology and research approach of the study.
Section 4 contains the data analysis and the main results of
the survey. In the fifth section, the results will be briefly
discussed.

LITERATURE REVIEW
A. Definition of Broadband
Broadband means an uninterrupted access to a great
number of services, using fast connection speeds [7]. Since
the access speeds and demand for Internet services are still
increasing the definition of the speed at which a broadband
connection is established must be adjusted from time to
time, with this (lower) limit being adjusted from 0.5 Mbps
to 4 Mbps in the period before 2011 [8]-[11]. This limit was
increased to (up to) 25 Mbps downstream in the last update
2015 [12].
B. Challenges
In general, the studies and reports from the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) [13] and Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) [14][15]
focus on the broadband provision of private households,
whereas the broadband supply of enterprises is often
unconsidered.
On the base that residential customers represent 80% of
broadband users [16], the focus on the consideration of the
broadband provision of private households is naturally.
However, since companies, for example as employers, have
a decisive influence on the (economic) importance of a
region, the significance of broadband connections for
business customers must be taken into account. In principle,
it can be assumed that business customers have a higher
demand for broadband and a higher willingness to pay than
residential customers [17]. In Germany, for example, users
58

of broadband access with at least 100 Mbps are mainly
companies and a few private heavy users [18]. Generally,
enterprises have a strong necessity to send and receive large
amounts of data between different enterprise locations or in
the enterprise-customer communication.
On the expectation that enterprises have a greater
willingness to pay for higher broadband connection speeds
(compared to private households), network operators believe
that business customers have a significantly higher revenue
potential per line (compared to residential customers).
However, the network operators can only benefit from the
higher willingness to pay from the enterprises if they are
able to satisfy the enterprises broadband needs. This study is
intended to contribute to the question if the performance of
the current broadband access is sufficient to satisfy the
enterprise needs.
C. Conceptual Model
In this subsection, the conceptual model (see Figure 1)
for the comprehension about the enterprise perceptions
regarding
the
broadband
access
performance
will
be
deepened.
The core problem is that enterprises see the own
broadband access with connection speeds as one important
economical location factor, which they need to keep their
status in business competition [2]-[7]. From this point of
view, the presence of high quality broadband infrastructures
indicates a key factor for enterprises in their choice of
location,
economic
success
and
future
(international)
competitiveness [19]. If the availability of broadband access
in a specific region or area do not satisfy enterprise needs,
the enterprises get directly limited by doing their business
purposes and they may choose another location for doing
their business activities. In this respect, a non-existent local
broadband
provision
directly
deters
the
enterprise
productivity and service quality in the specific region.
In addition, the availability of broadband Internet builds
the base for the collection of information and exploiting the
potential of electronic markets in the digital world [10][20].
In this regard, a sufficient broadband access with high
connection
speeds
is
the
base
for
the
national
competitiveness and profitability of enterprises [9][21]-[23].
Figure 1. Conceptual Model
The
technological
progress
of
telecommunications
infrastructures
allows
the
achievement
of
broadband
connection speeds of 100 Mbps and more. From the
technological perspective, the network operators should be
able to satisfy the bandwidth needs of the enterprises
[24][25].
Besides the availability of a high quality broadband
network, enterprises expect that the broadband access would
be also cover the enterprise needs in future. Furthermore,
the
broadband
access
should
have
a
(a)
fair
price-
performance ratio, (b) availability in other enterprise
locations,
(c)
guaranteed
stable
connections,
and
(d)
appropriate lead times [26]-[28].
The evaluation of the performance of the current
broadband access directly depends on the paid prices and
the network availability [29]. For example, the evaluation of
the perceived broadband access performance gives a direct
feedback if the needs of the enterprise are fulfilled.
In this context, the authors assume that the overall
broadband performance is rated as good if the broadband
connection speeds are sufficient to meet companies' current
and future broadband needs and if the price-performance
ratio is perceived as fair.
Based on this, the hypotheses for this paper are:
H1: A positive assessment of the speed performance of
the current broadband access by enterprises has a positive
impact
on
the
overall
perceived
broadband
access
performance.
H2: A positive assessment of the sufficiency of the
current broadband access for future needs positively affects
the overall perceived broadband access performance.
H3: A positive assessment of the price-performance-ratio
of the current broadband access positively affects the overall
perceived broadband access performance.
H4: A positive assessment of all the above-mentioned
performance
parameters
positively
affects
the
overall
perceived broadband access performance.
III.
METHODOLOGY
To verify appropriateness of the hypotheses, the authors
have performed a survey about the current performance of
enterprises’ broadband accesses. Especially, the survey
captures information regarding (a) the current broadband
connection speeds in downstream and upstream, (b) the paid
prices and the perceived price-performance ratio, (c) the
level of Internet interruptions, as well as (d) the expected
broadband demand. The main intention is here to figure out
how the enterprises evaluate the total performance of the
received broadband access and how the different indicators
affect this evaluation.
As our university is located in the Rhein-Main area
(Hesse) in Germany, the survey was mainly distributed via
local multipliers located in the municipalities to reach all
types of businesses (from micro to large).
For the
simplification of the data collection, a cross-sectional
online-survey (“one-shot survey”) have been prepared [30].

Although an online survey can in principle reach a wide
range of potential respondents, the absence of a high
participation rate and the completeness and accuracy of the
answers cannot be guaranteed for such online surveys. In
addition, the questionnaire was designed in such a way that
individual questions can be skipped without ending the
survey. The survey was distributed during the period from
May to July 2018 and 364 companies had opened the
questionnaire. However, only 81 of the 364 companies have
completely passed the questionnaire.
In the first part of the survey, the enterprises were asked
about their industry, enterprise size and degree of Internet
usage in general. The second part covers questions about the
Internet provider, broadband technology, and the broadband
connection speed in downstream and upstream. The third
part include questions about the importance of different
Internet services. The following fourth part of the survey
deals with the question to what extent the current broadband
situation satisfies the needs of the company. These are
supplemented in the fifth part by questions on service
quality and fault frequency. The last part regards questions
about the price of the current broadband access and the
willingness to pay for a better broadband access.
The collected data were analyzed using quantitative
research methods and the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences
(SPSS)
statistical
program.
To
examine
the
reliability and validity of the data, the estimation of the
Cronbach’s Alpha and the Exploratory Factor Analysis were
performed.
The questions regarding the broadband performance are
determined on the base of 5-Point-Likert-scale questions
[31]. Here, the measurement of the broadband performance
follows the scale from a very strong to a very weak
evaluation of the performance. Furthermore, the scope of
disturbances gives an overview about fault frequency of the
used broadband access (5-Point-Likert-scale: very rarely to
very often) [31]. Lastly, the price-performance-ratio (5-
Point-Likert-scale: very strong to a very weak performance)
and the willingness to pay (5-Point-Likert-scale: fully
disagree to fully agree) for a better broadband connection
are queried.
As introduced above, the used approach for assessment
the hypotheses partly deviate from the original model of the
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2
(UTAUT2).

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
A. Result Conditions
The further analysis assumes that the participants of the
survey will answer these from their position as business
customers. In the following, first the descriptive results and
the correlation analysis are presented. After a validation of
the concepts used, the results of the validity and reliability
analyses are briefly discussed. Finally, the results of the
ordinary least square regressions of the hypothesis test are
presented.
B. Descriptive Results
In the beginning of the analysis, the classification of the
involved companies will be discussed. 23.5% of the
responding enterprises are directed in the IT section,
whereas 17.3% of the enterprises are situated in provision of
services. The other participating companies are distributed
almost evenly across the other 11 industrial sectors and each
represents only a small proportion of the total distribution.
Regarding the classification of the enterprise size in
Table I, it can be seen that micro enterprises and small
enterprises take the biggest shares of the responding
enterprises with 38.5% and 37.2%, respectively. On the base
of the assumption that the distribution of the enterprises in
Germany in regard to their size would be quite similar with
the distribution of the enterprises in Hesse, it must be
admitted that the shares of micro enterprises in the survey is
underrepresented.
Contrary,
small,
medium,
and
large
enterprises are overrepresented.
Although the distribution of enterprises does not coincide
with the distribution of enterprises in Germany and Hessen,
the available data can provide detailed feedback on the
broadband connections available to small, medium-sized
and large enterprises.
It can be assumed that larger enterprises tend to require
higher
broadband
connection
speeds
than
small
and
medium-sized
enterprises,
in
particular
due
to
the
connection of different business locations. On the base of
evolving Internet services and applications and by linking
these pieces of information in relation to the degree of
Internet usage, it is not surprising that in over 60% of the
companies surveyed, over 80% of employees have to use
Internet connections to perform their daily business tasks
(see Table II).
As shown in Table III, more than half of the companies
surveyed have only one business location. The remaining
approx. 45% of companies with more than one location
depend on a good quality of links between these locations.
Otherwise, problems could arise that lead, for example, to
loss of information, longer work processes or a delay in
processing business transactions.
The
current
broadband
coverage
of
enterprises
is
described below. Figure 2 shows that 60% of companies use
copper-based broadband connections. In second place are
fiber optic lines with just over 20%. (In contrast, coax cable
infrastructure is the second most important connectivity
technology after copper for residential lines in Germany).
Although fixed broadband connections are best able to
secure
stable
broadband
connections
with
a
defined
connection
speed
without
frequency
and
weather
interferences, 5.2% of the companies surveyed still access
the Internet via mobile networks and 1.7% via satellite
connections.

Figure 2. Distribution of the Broadband Access Technology
Only 20% of the companies have access speeds of 100 to
1,000 Mbps. Therefore, it is not surprising that about 70%
of the queried enterprises companies assume that their
current broadband connection speed will not be sufficient to
provide the services and products of the future business life.
In this respect, 77.6% of the companies surveyed
responded that they immediately needed higher bandwidths,
which is in line with the previous studies [1].
Since, the main part of the copper infrastructures in
Germany are provided by the incumbent, it is not wondering
that 69.6% of the enterprises are connected to broadband
Internet by the incumbent of the German broadband market.
As shown in Table IV, approx. 48% of the enterprises use
broadband connection speeds of less than 30 Mbps in
downstream. In earlier studies, for the German market,
values
of
about
40%
of
companies
with
broadband
connections of (up to) 16 Mbps are mentioned, which is
compatible with the figures given in Table IV (27.3% less
than 16 Mbps and 47.8% less than 30 Mbps) [1].

The fact that over 50% (70%) of companies still have
download (upload) speeds of less than 50 Mbps is critical.
Especially in view of the increasing digitalization of society
and business activities, it can be assumed that such
bandwidths will not be sufficient in the near future [1].
The
problems
with
broadband
coverage
are
also
illustrated by the fact that 58.8% of respondents have not
changed their broadband contract in the last four years (see
Table V). In this context, it needs to be assessed whether
respondents could change their broadband access to improve
broadband coverage. In addition to the performance of
broadband access in terms of downstream and upstream
bandwidth, quality also depends crucially on how often the
service is unavailable. 44.3% of companies have stated that
they have interruptions in Internet access at least once a
month.
Although once a month sounds less dramatic, the duration
of the failures could be a critical problem. 54.4% of the
failures lasted at least 8 hours, which means that the
company was cut off from the commercial world for one
working day.
Although 77.6% of the queried enterprises are not
satisfied with their broadband access, most of the enterprises
are not able to change the current broadband provision,
which are shown in Figure 3. Nearly 60% of the queried
enterprises face the problem that a better broadband
infrastructure is not available. Round about 15.5% of the
queried enterprises do not want to change the broadband
access in regard the current access satisfies the broadband
needs. On the one hand, 22.4% of companies reply that they
have no need to use higher bandwidths.
On the other hand, only 15.5% of companies surveyed
said they did not want to change their broadband access
because it covers their current access. This means that some
of the respondents who do not need (directly) higher
bandwidths still want to change their current broadband
access as a precaution.
In the last step, the questions consider (a) the paid
monthly subscription fees and (b) the enterprise perceptions
regarding the price-performance ratio, as well as (c) the
degree of the satisfaction with the whole broadband access.

performance ratio perceived by enterprises, it can be noted
that 80.8% of the enterprises are not satisfied with the price-

Figure 3. Reasons for the not performed Change of the Broadband
Provision
Due to this high level of dissatisfaction, companies are
increasingly willing to change the broadband infrastructure
and/or the network operators as far as this is technically
possible. The dissatisfaction is directly related to the fear of
the companies that they may not be able to carry out their
business activities in full scope due to the insufficient
Internet connections [1]. The shortcomings can lead to e-
mails (e.g., with large file attachments) not being processed
at all or only very slowly, or video conferences with
customers/business partners not being possible, which
would have a negative effect on customer relations) [1].
Besides the consideration of the price-performance ratio,
the focus of this study targets on the evaluation about the
performance of the broadband access. In this regard, only
19.4% of the responding enterprises rates the overall
satisfaction with their broadband access as good or very
good (see Table VII).
One quarter of the queried enterprises rates the broadband
performance on a medium ("neutral") level (see Table VII).
In summarizing the whole estimation of the total broadband
performance, it needs to be concluded that approx. 55% of
the enterprises are not satisfied with their broadband access
and rate the broadband performance as weakly or very
weakly (see Table VII).

In addition, it can be noted that some companies notice
large differences between the ordered/paid and the actual
connection speeds provided, which further exacerbates their
dissatisfaction
C. Correlation Analysis
Although a statistical analysis would normally begin with
a review of reliability and validity, it exceptionally begins
with a correlation analysis to find out which of the variables
correlate with broadband access satisfaction. Based on the
hypotheses, the authors assume that (a) the currently
received connection speeds, (b) the degree of Internet usage
in the company, (c) the failure rate, (d) the price-
performance ratio, (e) the (monthly) price, (f) the demand
for higher bandwidths, and (g) the estimate of whether the
connection speeds will cover broadband demand in the
future
will
influence
the
overall
perception
of
the
performance of the current broadband access.
Correlation analysis measures the degree of relationship
between two individual variables. Here, it is necessary to
distinguish that a correlation analysis would measure the
proportionality between two variables instead of a degree of
dependency. A correlation coefficient of 1.000 shows a
‘perfect’ relationship. A correlation coefficient higher than
0.500 is classified as a good correlation. Below the mark of
0.300, the correlation coefficients are weak [32][33].
As shown in Table VIII, most variables fulfill the
assumption of significant linear proportionality (positive or
negative) to the variable evaluation of total broadband
performance. However, two variables, (1) the monthly
subscription fee, and (2) the level of Internet usage, do not
correlate significantly with the evaluation of total broadband
performance. For this reason, the presented conceptual
model in the second section will be adjusted and the two
named variables will be excluded, since on the base of a
missing
significant
correlation,
an
analysis
regarding
dependency does not make any sense.

In a further consideration of Table VIII, it can be seen
that most of the other variables present strong correlations
with the overall estimated broadband performance. Here, the
assessment of the extent to which the connection speeds can
cover
the
future
demand
shows
the
clearly
highest
correlation
coefficients
(downstream:
0.789;
upstream:
0.800).
The price-performance ratio (0.648) and the need
for higher bandwidth (-0.669) also show high correlation
coefficients with respect to the overall rating of broadband
performance.

Only for the frequency of failure, there is only a mean

the variables appear to be good predictors for regression
analyses with the overall rating of broadband performance.
However,
the
correlation
analysis
cannot
give
any
information about the degree of dependency or the direction
of causality.
D. Explanation fo the Research Concepts
Before the results of the validity and reliability analyses
will be introduced, the four research concepts will be
explained. In general, all the research concepts include
variables, which are used to analyze the stated hypotheses
from the second section. The first research concept includes
the downstream and upstream connection speed of the
current broadband access. The second research concept
covers
the
questions
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
downstream and upstream speeds and the need for higher
bandwidths in the future. The following third research
concept comprises the questions of the perceived price-
performance ratio and the overall broadband performance.
The
subsequent
last
concept
includes
all
correlating
variables from Table VIII and the dependent variable of the
perceived broadband performance. The following reliability
and validity analysis will verify the truthfulness of the
outcomes.
E. Reliability and Validity Analysis
Table IX and Table X illustrate the outcomes of the
reliability and validity analyses to verify if all the concepts,
which are used in the research model, stay valid and
reliable.
To estimate the validity of the concepts and hypotheses,
an exploratory factor analyses will be performed. Here, the
factor analysis includes the examination of the Kaiser-
Meyer-Olkin value (KMO), the significance test from
Bartlett, the consideration of the communalities and the
examination of the cumulative variance [34]-[38]. To
achieve a good validity, the estimated concepts should reach
significant p values below the mark of 5% in the Bartlett-
Test and KMO values above 0.7 [34]-[38].
Further the communalities
of the
variables in the
considered concept need to exceed in average the value of
0.6. To verify the validity in a further step, the variables will
be split in so-called factors. Here, the validity would be
given if the cumulative variance of all factors (with
eigenvalue above 1), which show the degree of explained
variance in the research concept, of the different possible
factors achieve more than 50% [34]-[38].
It should be noted that the concepts are valid as they all
meet the Bartlett-Test (see Table IX). With regard to the
KMO values, only the concepts of perceived broadband
usage and total broadband performance achieve satisfactory
values (of at least 0.7). If (as recommended by some
references [34]-[38]) less stringent KMO limits are applied
and if it is assumed that KMO values from 0.5 are
acceptable, the research concepts of speed performance
(KMO value 0.677) and perceived broadband performance
(KMO value 0.500) can be classified as acceptable.
If one considers the results to date together with the
results of the municipalities and the cumulative variance, it
can be seen that all research concepts have a cumulative
variance above 50%, which indicates that the existing
variance can be explained quite well. Regarding the
communalities, only the concept with all included variables
do not achieve an average of the variable communalities
above 0.6. However, the average value of 0.593 is close to
the mark 0.6 and therefore the communalities of this
concept could be weakly accepted.
Overall, the stated research concepts describe a good
validity.

Table X shows the results of the reliability analysis.
Reliability is evaluated using Cronbach Alpha, whereby the
Cronbach Alpha of a research concept for good reliability
should be greater than 0.7 [39]-[41].
With the exception of the concept of the perceived
broadband supply, for which good reliability could not be
proven, all research concepts are to be classified as reliable,
since these have Cronbach alpha values of over 0.7.
F. Regression Analysis
The regression analysis is performed on the base of the
method of a multiple ordinary least square regression. Here,
the regression analysis examines the degree of dependency
and
linear
relationship
between
the
dependent
and
independent variables For example, it will be examined, in
which degree the predictor variables are able to explain the
values of the dependent variable [42].
In the taken regression analysis, the following four
indicators will be considered in deeply. Firstly, the r-square
describes the explanatory power of the whole regression
model. Here, the r-square presents the part of the dependent
variable, which can be explained by the independent
variables. Following Chin [43] and Cohen [44], the r-square
should be at least 33%.
Secondly, the Analysis of the Variances (ANOVA)
measures the model fit whereby the F-value needs to be
higher than 3 and the probability needs to be significant.
Thirdly, the regression coefficients of the independent
variables need to be significant (p<0.05). Lastly, the test of
multicollinearities by the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
needs to be performed to figure out, whether the variables
included in the regression analyses have an identical
relation. In case of existing multicollinearities, the VIF
values would exceed the mark of 10 (or in a stricter
definition 3). In this case, it must be assumed that the
outcomes of the regression analysis are biased [37][45][46].
Table XI identifies results of regression analysis of the
different
independent
variables
and
their
degree
of
dependency regarding the enterprise perceptions about the
overall performance of their broadband access. The r-square
of 78.3% describes a high explanatory rate of the dependent
variable. For example, the independent variables are able to
explain more than 3/4 of the result of overall perceived
broadband performance. The ANOVA analysis shows a
significant F-value higher than three, which indicates that a
good model fit is given and the assumed model is better than
a simple mean model.
The regression outcome shows that, three variables have
a significant influence on the evaluation about the overall
broadband performance. The price-performance have a
positive significant regression coefficient of 0.266, which
means if an enterprise perceives a good balance of price and
performance, the overall performance of the broadband
access will be also well rated.
The sufficiency of the upstream connection speed is also
a significantly positive indicator for the estimation of the
overall broadband performance. For example, if enterprises
perceive that the upstream connection speed would be
sufficient, the overall broadband performance would be
rated positively.
Finally, it becomes clear that if companies find that they
need a higher bandwidth (than they currently have), they
will consider the overall performance of the (current)
broadband connection to be weak.

In
other
words,
there
is
a
"negative
regressive
correlation" (due to the binary coding of these variables)
between (a) the need for higher bandwidth and (b)
satisfaction with the performance of the (current) broadband
connection.
However, it should be noted that the speed variable VIF
values are above 3, suggesting that multicollinearities could
influence the regression results.
In this respect, a stepwise regression analysis is carried
out.
The
stepwise
regression
analysis
implements
systematically the significant independent variables in the
regression outcome. On the base of this approach, the
strength of the single independent variables as predictors for
the dependent variable can be identified. In addition, this
approach
implies
the
exclusion
of
the
insignificant
variables. For the reason of the exclusion of variables, the
bias problem of existing multicollinearities can be bypassed.
The results of the stepwise regression analysis in Table
XII show a high r-square of 77.0%, indicating a strong
model fit. Furthermore, four significant indicators for the
explanation of the dependent variable of the overall
broadband performance are presented. Since the stepwise
regression
implements
systematically
the
significant
indicators for dependent variables, the strongest predictor
for the overall broadband performance would be the
sufficiency
of
the
upstream
broadband
connection.

Furthermore, the price-performance ratio and the need for
higher bandwidth do also significantly explain the overall
broadband performance in the same way as in the regression
analysis on the base of the enter method displayed in Table
XI. Compared to the previous regression analysis, the three
indicators mentioned are slightly stronger in their impact on
the evaluation of overall broadband performance.
However, in contrast to the previous regression analysis,
the current downstream broadband connection speed would
be also seen as predictor variable for the perceptions
regarding
the
overall
broadband
performance.
.
The
regression coefficient of 0.139 shows that companies
achieving higher downstream speeds rate overall broadband
performance more positively.
In the consideration of the
VIF values, all the significant parameters indicate VIF
values below 3. For this reason, multicollinearities can be
excluded.

Other variables are excluded from the regression on the base of
insignificance.
Given that broadband contracts contain fixed conditions
for the speed of downstream and upstream connections, it is
not surprising that these two speeds depend on each other
and present precisely high multicollinearities. To avoid bias
in the assumed regression models, the enterprise statements
regarding the current downstream and upstream speed will
be combined in the term of the access speed. This is done by
a simple average of the two variables. The same procedure
will be performed for the variables of the sufficiency of
downstream and upstream speeds. Here, the resulting
variable will be named sufficiency of access speed.
Table XIII presents the regression outcome regarding the
estimated overall broadband performance on the base of a
further model adjustment by the authors. The r-square with
78.1% presents a high explanatory rate of the dependent
variable. The ANOVA analysis identifies a working model
fit.
With
the
exception
of
default
frequency,
all
the
implemented independent variables are significantly. The
results shown in Table XIII are quite similar to the results of
the first regression analysis (Table XII), especially for the
regression coefficients (a) price-performance ratio (0.264)
and (b) need for higher bandwidth (-0.637). In this respect,
reference can be made here to the explanations given above
for Table XII.
Regarding the results of the “new combined” speed
variables, it can be seen that both kinds of variables do
significant positively influence the evaluation of the overall
broadband performance. Here, the sufficiency of the access
speed (regression coefficient: 0.385) has a greater impact on
the satisfaction with the overall broadband performance than
the current access speed of the companies (regression
coefficient: 0.114).
From this point of view, it can be concluded that
enterprises with a higher current access speed perceive a
better broadband performance. Here, it is independently if
the broadband connection speed mean the downstream or
upstream speed. Since both kinds of speed have normally a
(proportional) relation, it can be assumed if an enterprise
gets a higher downstream speed, it also gets a higher
upstream speed.

Furthermore, if enterprises perceive that the current
access speeds would be sufficient to deliver the business
services in future, they evaluate also broadband performance
better. The same relation of access speeds and sufficiency of
access speeds in regard to the evaluation of the broadband
performance bases on the positive correlation of these both
variables. If enterprises get currently a higher broadband
connection speed, they perceive that the current access is
sufficient for the provision of the business services in future.
Despite the significant results in Table XIII, it should be
noted that the sufficiency of access speeds has a VIF value
greater than 3. For example, it could be that the results in
Table
XIII
are
distorted
by
possible
existing
multicollinearities.
Nevertheless, all four hypotheses (presented in the second
section) can be accepted.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
The statistical analysis has shown which indicators are
responsible for how companies evaluate their broadband
access. In general, the satisfaction of enterprises about their
broadband access depends in a larger degree on the
perception about the sufficiency of the broadband access for
the future business life, the price-performance ratio of the
65

current broadband access and the need of the enterprise to
use higher bandwidths in future. In a lower degree, the
current access speeds in downstream and upstream would
affect the satisfaction regarding the broadband access.
Interestingly, the failure frequency of the broadband Internet
access does not sustainably affect the satisfaction regarding
the performance of the current broadband access.
Although further research will be necessary to get
responses of more enterprises and to rise the quality of the
results, it can be concluded that the enterprise satisfaction
regarding their broadband access is mostly affected by the
sustainability of their broadband access in future. In this
respect, it is less important for companies how they
currently assess their broadband access. Instead, it is much
more important how the current broadband performance can
meet future requirements from the companies' point of view.
If this is the case, broadband performance will be assessed
positively, otherwise it will be assessed negatively.
Network operators and government institutions should
therefore primarily pay attention to what broadband services
companies will need in the future in order to create the
appropriate
conditions.
Otherwise,
companies
will
be
dissatisfied with their location and will think about moving
to another location.
