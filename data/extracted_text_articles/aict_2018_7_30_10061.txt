Abstract— In this paper, we propose a blind interleaver 
parameters estimation algorithm. By modeling the distribution 
of the ranks of the random matrices as a multinomial 
distribution, we can easily identify the parameters of the 
interleavers blindly. Experimental results show that the 
proposed algorithm outperforms other blind interleaver 
parameter estimation algorithms.

 INTRODUCTION  
Under the inherent channel impairments during 
communication, Error Correcting Codes (ECC) are 
indispensable for reliable transmission. In general, many 
ECCs are robust to the random errors but they are very weak 
to burst errors. For this reason, the interleaver which 
permutes the symbols (or bits) from several codewords so 
that any given codeword are well separated is introduced to 
handle this problem. Note that, for reliable communication, 
the receiver has to synchronize the data and deinterleave 
them before a channel decoder starts to operate [1].  
In a non-cooperative context, an eavesdropper tries to 
find 
information 
without 
any 
knowledge 
of 
the 
communication parameters used. For a perfect recovery of 
data, one of the most important steps is blind estimation of 
the interleaver parameters using only the intercepted 
sequences. 
Some algorithms exploiting the linearity of ECCs are 
proposed in the literature [2]-[11]. Algorithms using the 
properties of the dual codes are proposed in [2]-[4]. By 
finding a basis of a dual code by using the parity check 
relations, interleaver parameters can be blindly estimated. 
Algorithms using the linear dependence within a codeword 
were also proposed in [5]-[9]. Sicot et al. used both of the 
approaches and showed very good results [10]. Another 
approach 
exploiting 
the 
linear 
dependence 
among 
codewords and the specific distribution of the ranks of the 
random matrices are first proposed in [11]. Their algorithm, 
first, tries to identify errorless symbols by exploiting the 
distribution of the ranks of the random matrices and makes a 
rectangular matrix using the errorless symbols. If the 
interleaver period is not the same as the (horizontal) 
dimension of the rectangular matrix, it will have full rank. 
Otherwise, it does not have full rank [11]. 
In this paper, we propose a blind interleaver parameter 
estimation algorithm by modeling the distribution of the 
ranks of the random matrices as a multinomial distribution. 
By this modeling, we can transform the problem of 
estimating interleaver parameters into that of the probability 
matching. Using this probabilistic setup, we can efficiently 
determine interleaver parameters in a non-cooperative 
context. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
gives a review of some previous algorithms. In Section III, 
we explain our proposed algorithm. Simulation results and 
analyses are in Section IV, and we conclude in Section V. 
II. 
PREVIOUS WORKS 
In this section, we describe the system setup. And we 
explain in detail the property of linear dependence among 
codewords and the distribution of the ranks of the random 
matrices since the proposed algorithm is heavily dependent 
upon these properties. 
A. System Setup 
Let C be an (n, k, d) linear code over GF(2), where n is 
the codeword length, k is the code dimension, d is the 
minimum Hamming weight of the codewords, and GF(2) 
represents the Galois field of order 2. By linearity, we can 
represent any codeword c∈C as follows: 
 
G

c m
 
(1)
 
where c is a 1  n row vector, m is a 1  k row vector, and G 
is a k  n matrix having full rank.  
Since in almost all the communication systems, the 
interleaver size S is a multiple of the codeword size, we can 
represent S = βn, where β is the number of codewords 
within an interleaver. We assume that the channel is a 
Binary 
Symmetric 
Channel 
(BSC) 
with 
transition 
probability of Pe. Let l be a predicted interleaver period.  
Note that the most fundamental and frequent operations 
of the proposed algorithm are the calculations of the ranks 
of the matrices. In this case, the matrix is of size l  (l + q) 
(q ≥ 0). When making a sequence into a matrix of size l  (l 
+ q), we pile up the received symbols from leftmost top to 
rightmost bottom in raster scanning order. 
B. 
Linear Dependence among Codewords 
The (n, k, d) linear code C over GF(2) is a k-dimensional 
subspace in an n-dimensional vector space. Due to this, there 
are k basis vectors in the n-dimensional vector space. If there 
are k + 1 codewords, at least one of the codewords can be 
described by the linear combination of k basis vectors. This

property of linear dependence among codewords can 
elucidate the rank behavior better than the property of linear 
dependence within codewords [11]. 
C. Distribution of the Ranks of the Random Matrices 
Let the probability Ps be the probability that the rank of 
the l  l square matrix is l – s (s ≠ 0) when l → ∞. In this 
case, we assume that the entries in an l  l square random 
matrix take the values in GF(2) with equal probability. In 
[12], Ps is given by

Table I shows the values of Ps for some values of s. Note 
that as l increases, the calculated Ps rapidly converges to 
theoretical values. From Table I, we can see that an l  l 
square binary random matrix would very rarely have a rank 
as low as l – s (s ≥ 3). 
 
 
If the rank of an l  l square binary matrix A happens to 
be (s ≥ 3), we can assume that there are some structures in 
this matrix A. That is, we can presume that the matrix has l – 
s – m (m ≥ 1) basis vectors and m distinct errors [11]. If we 
plug such ideas into the blind interleaver parameters 
estimation algorithm, when l = S, low ranks can happen 
frequently. When l ≠ S, the rank of matrix A follows the 
distribution in Table I. 
III. 
PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
As is pointed out in Section II-C, when l = S, the l  l 
square matrices would have low ranks frequently. Otherwise, 
i.e., when l ≠ S, the ranks of the l  l square matrices follow 
the distribution in Table I. Therefore, we can consider the 
problem of finding the interleaver parameters as that of the 
probability matching. That is, when l ≠ S, the distribution of 
the ranks of the l  l square matrices would be very close to 
the distribution in Table I. If the distribution of the ranks of 
the l  l square matrices is very different from the 
distribution in Table I, we can assume that l = S.  
To assess the closeness between the distribution of the 
ranks of the l  l square matrices and the distribution in 
Table I, we consider the distribution in Table I as a 
multinomial distribution [13]. For brevity, we partition the 
events into 4 categories: EVENT_0 (whose rank is 0), 
EVENT _1 (whose rank is 1), EVENT _2 (whose rank is 2), 
EVENT_3 (whose rank is no less than 3). Then, we have the 
following table of cell probabilities in Table II. 
 
Assume that the number of trials is N and the numbers 
of events are (x0, x1, x2, x3) in N. Note that N = x0+x1+x2+x3. 
We assume that the random vector (x0, x1, x2, x3) follows the 
multinomial distribution. We also assume that the 
dimension of the matrices are l  l. Then, the probability Pl 
of this random vector is calculated as follows [13]:

Note that when the random vector follows the 
distribution in Table II, the probability Pm would be 1. 
Otherwise, its probability would be very small. 
The proposed algorithm can be summarized as follows: 
 
1) Randomly select l vectors and construct an l  l 
square matrix. 
2) Calculate the rank s of the matrix. 
3) Count the number of EVENT_i. 
4) Repeat steps from 1) to 3) N times. 
5) Calculate (4). If Pl is less than a predetermined 
threshold. Go to 7). 
6) Increment l as l + 1 and go to 1). 
7) Declare that the interleaver period is l. 
 
Note that a predetermined threshold is calculated 
according to the false alarm probability. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
We carry out some experiments to validate the proposed 
algorithm. In all the experiments, we use (7, 4) binary 
Hamming code and random interleavers. In this case, when 
the interleaver period is S, the search range of the interleaver 
period is set from 7 to S + 1, and the delay parameter is 
chosen randomly from 0 to S – 1. We set the threshold 
(which is related to a false alarm probability) as 10-10. For 
each Bit Error Rate (BER) the number of iterations is set to

10,000. The number of intercepted samples available is 
50,000. We compared the performance of the proposed 
algorithm with that of Gauss-Jordan Elimination Through 
Pivoting (GJETP) algorithm [10] and that of the Selecting 
the Errorless Symbols (SES) based interleaver parameter 
estimation algorithm [11].  
Figure 1 shows the detection performance of algorithms 
when the interleaver period is 28. As can be seen from the 
figure, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other 
algorithms. The false alarm probability of the proposed 
algorithm and the SES based algorithm is 0 over the BER 
range [0.0175, 0.0475] from the figure 2. On the contrary, 
the false alarm probability of the GJETP is relatively high 
and when BER is 0.0475, its false alarm probability is 
3.72%. 
Figure 3 shows the detection performance of algorithms 
when the interleaver period is 35. As with the figure 1, the 
proposed 
algorithm 
almost 
perfectly 
estimates 
the 
interleaver period and outperforms the other algorithms. 
Figure 4 shows the false alarm probabilities of the 
algorithms. To be specific, the false alarm events did not 
occur for the SES based algorithm. For the proposed 
algorithm, the false alarm events occurred only when BER = 
0.04. In this case, the false alarm probability is 0.02%. As 
with the figure 2, the false alarm probability of the GJETP is 
relatively very high.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we proposed an interleaver parameters 
estimation algorithm based on the probabilistic matching. By 
modeling the ranks of the random square matrices as a 
multinomial distribution, we can easily estimate the 
interleaver parameters. Experimental results show that the 
proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of 
detection performance and the reliability.
