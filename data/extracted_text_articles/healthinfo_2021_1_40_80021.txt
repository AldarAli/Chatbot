Abstract— The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources 
(FHIR) advanced the Health Level 7 v2 (HL7), Extensible Markup 
Language v3 (XML), and Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) 
standards by defining over 135 resources that conceptualize the 
different aspects of healthcare data to facilitate the secure 
exchange of data for patients using cloud-based Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs). As part of the design and 
development process of FHIR applications, a subset of the 
resources would be chosen to satisfy application requirements. 
While the FHIR standard is excellent at conceptualizing resources, 
this process is very targeted at the implementation level. FHIR 
provides no higher-level constructs to organize resources in a 
predevelopment process similar to what is available in software 
design patterns, which arose when developers noticed that they 
were constantly reimplementing the same types of functionalities 
in the same way for different applications. Our prior work 
extended the FHIR standard with meta resources, a conceptual 
construct that defines the involved resources and their interactions 
into one unified artifact akin to a design pattern, with the ability 
to generate a FHIR XML schema bundle that could serve as the 
foundation in a development workflow. This paper examines the 
way that our previously defined meta resource extension to FHIR 
can be positioned within the FHIR standard by: considering the 
relation between meta resources and resources that extends the 
FHIR Unified Modeling Language (UML) model; assessing the 
ability of the abstract DomainResource to implement containment 
in meta resources; exploring FHIR modules that provide 
organizational and contextual information different resources; 
examining the way that meta resources fit into the FHIR 
information architecture; and, determining if it is possible to 
employ a composition of Library resources and ActivityDefiniton 
resources in support of realizing meta resources.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) [1] 
was introduced in 2014 to support and continue to advance 
interoperability and Health Information Exchange (HIE) and 
promote the secure sharing of healthcare data. The standard has 
passed through an initial maturity level and is currently widely 
endorsed and accepted by stakeholders, policymakers, and 
healthcare application developers. As a prominent example, The 
Office of the National Coordinator mandates FHIR [2] for 
making data available via APIs to patients and for data sharing. 
The FHIR standard defines over 135 resources, which are data 
elements to capture all types of healthcare data organized into 
different layers; the base resource layer contains patients, 
practitioners, family relationships, organizations, services, 
appointments, and encounters; and, the clinical layer has 
resources for a patient’s health history, diagnostic data, 
medications, 
care 
provision, 
and 
request/response 
communication. Resources are also organized in the foundation, 
financial, and specialized layers. 
In support of HIE and interoperability, we have prior work 
[3] on software architectural alternatives (e.g., service-oriented, 
grid computing, publish & subscribe paradigm, and data 
warehousing) with follow-up work [4] using FHIR to integrate 
health information technology (HIT) systems to facilitate 
collaboration among medical providers. Our most recent work 
[5] explored the inclusion of a design pattern-like concept of a 
meta resource in the FHIR standard. Meta resources can 
logically organize FHIR resources into a conceptual unit that, 
like a design pattern, can be customized and reused across 
multiple applications. With a collection of meta resources, it 
becomes possible to take design decisions in application 
development on a higher conceptual level, lower the overall 
development effort through the reuse of knowledge and 
introduce tool support and automated requirement validation of 
implemented solutions. Our focus in this paper is to explore 
integrating the meta resource concepts directly into the FHIR 
standard. 
Design patterns are a classic and widespread approach in 
software engineering and development pioneered in [6]. The 
idea originated in an investigatory process when software 
engineers and developers realized that they constantly copied 
and reimplemented similar code in different projects. A well-
known example is the Observer pattern for defining a one-to-
many relationship between a subject (active object) and 
observers (passive objects), in which observers are notified 
about changes to the subject. The Observer pattern is 
instantiated to solve the problem of having one object change 
multiple other objects (e.g., reacting on an incoming HTTP 
request). Another widely used example is the Model View 
Controller pattern, which consists of: a model that captures the 
Enterprise data and the business rules associated with accessing 
and updating the data; a view that renders the contents or subset 
of the model for the presentation of the stored data; and, the 
controller that translates interactions with the view (button 
clicks, user interface (UI) actions, Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
(HTTP) calls, etc.) into actions on the model. This initial work 
subsequently led to the definition of higher-level architectural 
design patterns [7] that are more conducive to use application 
development using FHIR to facilitate HIE.

Design patterns can fit into the Enterprise architecture [8] of 
FHIR [9] as part of its overall information architecture. In 
addition to resources organized in the aforementioned five 
layers, the broader FHIR architecture model also includes a sixth 
resource contextualization layer containing FHIR profiles and 
graphs. Meta resources can fit into the FHIR’s resource 
contextualization layer, thereby extending its architecture with 
additional relationship types, attributes, and constraints. Our 
recent work [5] leverages the extension concepts of FHIR 
profiles along with the grouping operation of Bundle resources 
to integrate meta resources seamlessly into the FHIR standard. 
This approach provides a design pattern-like capability that can 
augment and extend the existing functionality of FHIR by 
higher-level conceptual named constructs that, for particular 
workflows, clearly define the involved resources and their 
interactions into one unified artifact. 
The main objective of this paper is to provide a detailed 
examination of the way that our meta resource extension to 
FHIR [5] can be positioned within five facets of the FHIR 
standard. The first facet is the inclusion of meta resources that 
would extend the FHIR UML model of resources [10]. The 
second facet will assess whether the abstract DomainResource 
[11] can be leveraged to implement containment in meta 
resources. The third facet explores FHIR modules [12] to see if 
they can provide the organizational and contextual information 
required for meta resources. The fourth facet examines the way 
that meta resources could fit into the FHIR information 
architecture [9]. The final facet explores the extent to which 
meta resources can be realized as a composition of Library 
resources [13] and ActivityDefiniton resources [14]. 
To illustrate the potential of the concepts of this paper, we 
will focus our work on the development of a mobile health 
application and framework [15] for medication reconciliation 
that integrates information from multiple EHRs. Please note that 
FHIR is an evolving standard (normative version v.4.0.1 at the 
time of writing). Therefore, the concepts in this paper and a 
discussion of the facets may be subject to change in future 
releases. As a result, the paper explores these facets as 
alternative approaches for incorporating meta resources into the 
FHIR standard instead of suggesting one fixed approach.  
The remainder of this paper has four sections. Section 2 
provides background information on medication reconciliation 
concepts and the FHIR concepts, both of which are used for 
examples throughout the paper. Section 3 summarizes our prior 
work [5] to present an outline of our model that extends FHIR 
with meta resources from which FHIR bundles can be 
automatically generated. Section 4 explores the aforementioned 
five facets to fully understand the way that meta resources can 
be included in the FHIR standard, thereby supporting a design 
pattern-like capability. Section 5 contains concluding remarks 
and outlines ongoing work. 
II. BACKGROUND 
This section provides background material in two areas. 
Section II.A explores medication reconciliation and its 
importance for healthcare. Section II.B presents FHIR concepts 
relevant to the paper.  
A. Medication Reconciliation 
Since a patient’s medication regimen is the basis for 
treatment decisions, medication lists must be accurate to 
maximize therapeutic impact and prevent potentially life-
threatening events. Discrepancies between the medication lists 
in HITs where patients receive care can potentially harm 
patients. This challenge is significant enough that in Connecticut 
(CT), the CT General Assembly passed Special Act 18-6: An 
Act Requiring the HIT Officer to Establish a Work Group to 
Evaluate Issues Concerning Polypharmacy and Medication 
Reconciliation [16] which produced several recommendations 
to the legislature which includes the development of technology 
to support the ability to generate the Best Possible Medication 
History via an automated electronic means [17]. To substantiate 
the discussion in this paper, we provide examples from our work 
[15], which presents a medication reconciliation solution that 
integrates information from multiple EHRs. We can combine 
the FHIR resources used by this solution (Patient, Medication, 
MedicationStatement, etc.) into a MedicationReconciliation 
meta resource which supports the actions of the application, 
including: retrieving medications from multiple EHRs, personal 
health records, and other HITs; combining and reconciling 
medications into a best medication list that identifies potential 
conflicts between the same or different medications; and, 
supporting an adaptive multi-use algorithm for medication 
reconciliation.  
B. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource, FHIR 
FHIR is structured around the concept of resources, which 
are comprehensive data elements that hold the information 
expressed in FHIR. Formally, a FHIR resource R is defined as 
an entity with the properties set P = (Identity, Type, (Data 
Item*), Version). The identity property is used to address a given 
resource entity within a FHIR system consisting of one or more 
FHIR servers. The type property specifies one of the resource 
types that are provided by the FHIR specification. The data 
items property is a set of structured data elements, which holds 
the resource’s actual data content as specified by its definition. 
The version property implements a version counter which tracks 
changes that occur to the contents of a resource through its 
lifetime. The record version automatically changes each time the 
resource changes, allowing a complete audit trail that tracks the 
evolution and the provenance of a resource. The FHIR standard 
defines representation formats in XML, JavaScript Object 
Notation (JSON), and Terse RDF Triple Language (Turtle).

III. SUMMARIZING META RESOURCE CONCEPTS 
This section reviews the meta resource model of our prior 
work [5], highlighting the key concepts necessary for the 
remainder of the paper. Section III.A reviews the model for 
describing a meta resource and provides examples. Section 
III.B explores the generation of a FHIR bundle that, combined 
with the meta resource definition, represents a design pattern-
like for a particular problem. 
A. Meta Resource Capabilities and Example 
To begin, a FHIR resource is a four-tuple of identifier, type, 
date, 
and 
version 𝑅 = < 𝑅𝐼𝐷, 𝑅𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒, 𝑅𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎, 𝑅𝑉𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 > . 
Example 1 illustrates a Patient [18] instance according to this 
definition.  
Example 1. 
A FHIR Patient resource instance for patient 
John Doe after five changes is represented by 
𝑅1 =< 𝑅𝐼𝐷1, 𝑡1, 𝑅𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎1, 𝑥 > 
where 
𝑅𝐼𝐷1 =  ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑝://𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡. 𝑓ℎ𝑖𝑟. 𝑜𝑟𝑔/𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡/𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡/123 
and 
𝑡1 = 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 
and 
𝑅𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎1 = {{"𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑟" ∶  "ea44426f", 
"active": "true", 
"name": "John Doe", 
"telecom": "555-370-8047", 
"gender": "male", 
"𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒" ∶  "1970 − 12 − 12", . . . } 
and 
𝑥 =  5 
 
Next, we review the concept of meta resources to leverage 
the design pattern idea and define higher-level design 
constructs that can represent multiple resources needed to 
implement a particular application. This transcends the 
resource-centric view of FHIR on clinical data. Meta resources 
provide reusable workflow-centric patterns that allow a 
conceptual view for implementing functionalities in an already 
FHIR enabled system. Sample workflows include medication 
reconciliation, patient admission, or vaccination support. 
The definition of a specific meta resource determines the 
properties, components, relationships, and requirements that 
the given meta resource has to an implementing system. To 
implement a particular workflow, a meta resource from a 
library of previously implemented solutions can be used as a 
pattern for the high-level design of applications and as a schema 
against which actual implementations are checked for full 
functionality. The overall objective of a meta resource is the 
larger granular organization of resources for a specific health-
related workflow, described via human-readable description. 
Example 2 has an instance of a MedicationReconciliation 
meta resource for the medication reconciliation as introduced 
in Section II.A and implementing the meta resource structure 
shown in Figure 2: the Patient resource holds demographic 
information of the affected patient. It references one or more 
MedicationStatement resources. The MedicationStatement 
identifies that a patient is or was taking a medication. It contains 
a Medication resource identifying the actual medication. It also 
references one Endpoint resource to indicate from where the 
statement was retrieved. Finally, it also references one 
Practitioner resource that identifies the individual who should 
be notified if issues regarding this statement are detected. A 
DetectedIssue resource references two or more medication 
statements, indicating a potential problem between those 
statements, which must be resolved during reconciliation. An 
Endpoint records information on which system needs to be 
notified regarding a discovered issue. It represents a health 
information technology system such as an electronic health 
record at a hospital, a rehab facility, a clinician’s office, etc., 
that must be notified whenever a change is made. The Endpoint 
references a Practitioner resource to identify a practitioner who 
needs to be contacted regarding issues detected during 
reconciliation for a given medication statement. In summary, 
the MedicationReconciliation meta resource comprises six 
different FHIR resource types and models their relationships in 
the scope of a medication reconciliation workflow. 
Example 2. 
In the formal model introduced in [5], the 
meta resource MedicationReconciliation is represented by 
𝑀𝑅1 = < 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝐷1,𝑀𝑅𝑁𝑎𝑚𝑒, 𝑀𝑅𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑐1, 𝑀𝑅𝑃𝑅1  , 𝑀𝑅𝐴𝑃𝐼, 
𝑀𝑅𝑅𝐸𝐹1,𝑀𝑅𝐶𝑂𝑀1 > 
where 
𝑀𝑅𝐼𝐷1 = ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑝://𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡. 𝑓ℎ𝑖𝑟. 𝑜𝑟𝑔/𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡/𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑎 
/𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛/123 
and 
𝑀𝑅𝑁𝑎𝑚𝑒1 = 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 
and 
           𝑀𝑅𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑐1 = ”Medication reconciliation is the process of 
comparing a patient’s medication orders to all the medications 
that the patient has been taking and eliminating potential 
errors, resulting in a new up to date list of medications.”  
and 
 
and 
𝑀𝑅𝐴𝑃𝐼 = < 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 > 
and 
𝑀𝑅𝑅𝐸𝐹1 = {< 𝑝𝑟𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑝𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 >, < 𝑝𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 >,
< 𝑝𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑝𝑟𝑝𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑟 >,
< 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑒, 𝑝𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 >}

and 
𝑀𝑅𝐶𝑂𝑀1 =< 𝑝𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑝𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑 > 
 
Each resource in a meta resource is classified according to the 
service it provides, such as consumer, producer, data source, 
or data generator. For example, in Figure 2, the Medication 
resource will serve as a data source for performing the 
reconciliation. In contrast, the FHIR MedicationStatement can 
serve as a producer of further medication resources. 
Fundamentally, a meta-resource is a composition of standard 
FHIR resources enriched with meta-information to define the 
structure and interactions of FHIR resources on the design 
level. A meta-resource definition contains a specification of 
FHIR resources that must be available to instantiate the meta 
resource, known as the participating resources.

B. FHIR Bundle Generation 
This section briefly reviews our approach for automatically 
transitioning a meta resource definition into a destination FHIR 
bundle at the schema level. Details of the process and the 
associated algorithm were documented in our previous work [5]. 
FHIR Bundle resources [19] are container resources built 
explicitly into the standard to group other references, for 
example, in the context of search results or for the exchange of 
messages. Conceptually, a bundle consists of meta-information 
about the bundle itself (such as an identifier), entries 
encapsulating FHIR resources, and links between those entries 
and potentially other outside resources. FHIR bundles allow 
references and containment and are capable of reflecting the 
relationships shown in the meta resource in Figure 2.  
As one transitions from design to the development of the 
healthcare application, the FHIR bundle can facilitate the 
exchange with another system. This approach aims to ensure 
baseline compatibility with systems that are not aware of meta 
resources 
while 
simultaneously 
leveraging 
existing 
communication APIs for interacting with other meta resource-
enabled systems. To illustrate the process, a meta resource needs 
to be transitioned to a suitable FHIR artifact to construct a 
representation that is amenable to realization within a particular 
healthcare application. 
 
Our algorithmic process documented in [5] takes the meta 
resource of Figure 2 and creates a meta resource bundle that 
captures all of the components and relationships conforms to the 
FHIR bundle XML schema and generates a bundle resource as 
given in Figure 3. Specifically, for every medication 
reconciliation meta resource, the initial generation is the top-
level bundle element and a single patient element. Then the 
participating resources, as given in Figure 2, are processed into 
matching bundle entries and explicitly connected by bundle 
links to express their interactions and relationships.  
IV.  INTEGRATING DESIGN PATTERNS INTO FHIR 
This section reviews five facets of the FHIR standard that 
give anchor points for extending the standard and explores 
multiple approaches for conceptually including the meta 
resource model concepts of Section III.A into the standard. The 
first facet in Section IV.A investigates the relation between meta 
resources and FHIR resources, which is explored by extending 
the relevant UML model. Section IV.B, the second facet, 
inspects 
the 
functionality 
provided 
by 
the 
abstract 
DomainResource resource as a potential candidate to implement 
the containment of resources in meta resources. Section IV.C, 
the third facet, explores the organization of FHIR resources in 
FHIR modules and identifies modules that would be affected by 
the meta resource extension. Section IV.D, the fourth facet, 
details the way that meta recourses fit into the FHIR information 
architecture. The fifth facet in Section VI.E explores the 
composition of the Library and ActivityDefiniton resources. The 
concepts discussed in this section are partially at the initial 
stages of development (e.g., the FHIR module definitions) and 
may be subject to change in future releases. Therefore, we 
explore several alternative approaches for incorporating meta 
resources instead of suggesting a fixed direction.

A. Meta Resource Capabilities and Example 
To begin, in the first facet we consider, meta resources are 
directly related to the published resources [10] defined in the 
FHIR standard. They assemble a set of participating resources 
enriched with additional context information into higher-level 
artifacts. On a schema level, this enhances reusability by 
tailoring extensive resources that can be used to solve specific 
workflows in different parts of the health care domain. This is 
similar to the way that design patterns are used to tackle 
reoccurring problems across the software engineering domain. 
Then on an instance level, meta resource instances directly 
group instances of FHIR resources containing medical data and 
share them across systems that use FHIR seamlessly. This direct 
relationship between meta resources and participating FHIR 
resources allows for incorporating meta resources into FHIR by 
regarding them as entities related to FHIR resources. Figure 4 
shows the UML structure of meta resources in the context of the 
FHIR resource UML structure, with new UML classes added for 
MetaResource and ResourceTuple at the top of the figure (top 
two boxes).

Figure 4. Meta Resource UML Structure. 
Figure 4 demonstrates the UML artifact of a FHIR resource 
class defined by the FHIR specification [10] and the UML 
artifact of a meta resource class with its attributes as defined in 
Section III. The meta resource relates directly to FHIR resources 
by the participation relation, which models the collection of 
participating resources. Furthermore, the reference relation 
which models the referenceStructure property relates the meta 
resource to a ResourceTuple class, which combines two FHIR 
resources into a directed pair. For this use case, the from 
resource in the tuple references the to resource. A similar 
application is modeled for the composition relation, which 
models the compositionStructure property of a meta resource. 
Here the from resource contains the to resource of the tuple.  
B.  Domain Resources 
The abstract resource DomainResource is the second facet 
we explore and is a foundation resource that provides common 
functionality to resources from which they were derived [11]. 
As an abstract resource, it is not directly instantiated, but 
because all of the standardized resources (except for Bundle, 
Parameter, and Binary) extend the DomainResource, its 
functionality is broadly available in the resource model. There 
is a property to a DomainResource that initially appears highly 
useful for including meta resources in the FHIR framework: the 
option to specify additional contained resources within a 
resource that closely relates to the grouping nature of meta 
resources. Since the contained property allows a designer to 
assemble other resources within a given resource (which then 
becomes 
a 
container), 
it 
provides 
functionality 
that 
fundamentally could express participating resources. Based on 
this, a possible approach would be to define a meta resource as 
a resource derived from DomainResource as illustrated in Figure 
5. In the figure, the inheritance relation of DomainResource and 
Resource, the contained property, and a suggested extension 
relation of the MetaResource in the upper left would make the 
contained property available to all of the meta resources. 
Resource <<Resource>>

-meta: Meta [0..1]

-referenceStructure: ResourceTuple[0..N]
-containmentStructure: ResourceTuple[0..N]
 
                Figure 5. DomainResource Inheritance Structure. 
However, closer inspection shows some significant 
limitations to this property and its application within the current 
version of the framework, limiting its value for incorporating 
meta resources into the standard. The resources referenced by 
the contained property are conceptually only existent in the 
scope of the container resource [11] and can neither be referred 
to without the container nor be passed around in their own 
transactions. This prohibits the idea of disassembling and 
partially using meta resources where they cannot be understood 
by plain FHIR systems and poses a problem to implement the 
reference and containment structures since they cannot reliably 
reference the contained elements without them having an own 
identity. Finally, contained resources may not contain further 
nested resources; therefore, a meta resource based on this 
property could not assemble arbitrary participating FHIR 
resources but would need to explicitly prevent them from 
nesting any data, which would harm the expressiveness of the 
model. As a result, the DomainResource functionality alone is 
not suitable to model meta resources within the FHIR standard.  
C. FHIR Modules 
The FHIR specification is organized in different functional 
areas to provide high-level guidance to implementers of the 
standard to make appropriate decisions on which parts of FHIR 
are required to model a particular healthcare process for solving 
a specific problem. These areas are reflected by FHIR modules 
[12] which is the third facet that we examine and aims to provide 
organizational and contextual information about the parts of the 
standard they cover. Towards this goal, modules are utilized to 
define: a scope and index, use cases, security and privacy 
information, and a roadmap for their content. The scope and 
19

index provide developers with an introduction to the module, 
which consists of a textual description of the conceptual goals 
of the module and the envisioned functional range of the 
module. Furthermore, scope and index also summarize the 
technical content (i.e., the resources) of the module. The 
included use cases provide guidance and examples on using the 
contents of the module for implementing solutions. The security 
and privacy information component of the modules highlights 
areas of special caution and overall consideration for securing 
data expressed by the module. With FHIR still evolving as a 
standard, the roadmap provides information on the state of the 
evolution in maturity of the module's contents with respect to the 
overall standard. 
As shown in Figure 6 [12], modules are classified into 
multiple levels, which offer a comprehensive and goal-focused 
view of FHIR information architecture. Levels 1 and 2 provide 
the technological foundation starting at low-level data types and 
exchange formats and extending to implementation basics and 
external specifications. Levels 3 and 4 contain parts of the 
standard used to model the healthcare domain's content and 
processes. Finally, Level 5 provides the means for reasoning 
over the information recorded and exchanged in the lower 
levels. Again, concepts from higher levels logically depend on 
the concepts introduced in the lower levels. 
 
 
Figure 6. Organization of FHIR in Modules. 
Note that modules are not necessarily mutually exclusive in 
their content. To illustrate this, consider that the PlanDefinition 
resource is used to define executable plans such as a 
chemotherapy regimen which means that it is both conceptually 
part of the workflow module in Level 4 as well as of the clinical 
reasoning module in Level 5. Similarly, the meta resources 
introduced by this proposal crosscut the module classification 
and can be primarily assigned to multiple levels specifically:  the 
implementer support module in Level 2; the workflows module 
in Level 4; and, to some extent, to the clinical reasoning module 
in Level 5. Fundamentally, a meta resource (as with a design 
pattern) intends to simplify the development process of FHIR 
applications and eliminate repetitive decision processes by 
providing a specific framework for resource assembly. At the 
schema level, this is initially unrelated to the actual content of 
the resources and therefore fits into the implementer support 
module (at the technological foundation provided by Level 1 and 
Level 2). However, the composition of resources as part of the 
meta resource naturally allows for simplified and reusable 
modeling of generic workflows; therefore, actual instances of 
meta resource would be used to improve the workflow module 
in Level 4. Finally, the management of meta resources as 
artifacts that bundle lower-level resources, enrich them with 
additional knowledge about their relationships, and are provided 
as an advanced toolset in the standard would be classified into 
the clinical reasoning module in Level 5. Figure 7 illustrates the 
selected FHIR modules of the module architecture extended by 
meta resources (reduced to just the affected modules). 
 
 
Figure 7. FHIR Modules extended by Meta Resources. 
D. Information Architecture 
Meta resources can be introduced into the FHIR standard as 
part of the information architecture, the fourth facet we explore, 
depicted as the composition framework in Figure 8 [9]. The 
resource contextualization Layer 6 of the architecture is 
designated to adapt FHIR resources to a specific environment. 
In contrast to the other layers, the information architecture 
serves a special purpose, as it does not contain resources but 
represents concepts that extend, constrain, add additional 
attributes, or provide meta information to the resources that are 
assigned to Layer 1 (Foundation Resources) through Layer 5 
(Specialized Resources). Figure 8 illustrates a suggested 
extension of Layer 6 (hosting FHIR profiles and graphs) by the 
meta resource concept. 
Profiles are used to tailor the FHIR specification to a specific 
environment. They achieve this by providing rules that allow a 
designer to restrict or extend the specification. In terms of 
resource attributes, profiles offer the ability to either disallow 
the use of specific attributes or add additional attributes to 
resources. An example use-case for this functionality is to 
facilitate the enforcement of adequate terminologies for a given 
domain. Profiles also allow the extension/restriction of the API 
that a FHIR server supports, therefore enabling an implementer 
to add custom services to the rest interface. In summary, profiles 
allow the modification of the data model of the specification and 
extend the supported means of communication, which is 
fundamental for supporting our meta resource extension.

Figure 8. Information Architecture in FHIR. 
For example, consider the mapping of the components of a 
meta resource serving for a medication reconciliation workflow 
to the relevant framework layers as displayed in Figure 9, where 
the box in the lower-left labeled MedRec Meta Resource 
indicates the system borders of the meta resources. The 
implementation of such a medication reconciliation meta 
resource (see Section III.A again) requires at least six FHIR 
resources: Medication, MedicationStatement, and DetectedIssue 
resources (Clinical resources in Layer 3) for modeling the 
medication information; the Patient and Practitioner resources 
(Individuals resources in Layer 2) for representing the involved 
individuals; and the Endpoint resource (Entities resources in 
Layer 2) to identify and address participating HER systems. 
Finally, the functionality of a specific MedRec FHIR profile is 
required to describe the APIs functionality for interacting with 
the meta resource (Layer 6).

E. Composition of Library and ActivityDefiniton Resources 
In addition to Bundle resources, the FHIR standard offers 
further resources that can define collections of other resources, 
such as the Library resource and the ActivityDefinition resource, 
the fifth facet we explore, that can be combined to model an 
advanced level of resource composition. The FHIR Library 
resources are general purpose containers for expressing and 
sharing clinical knowledge assets independently of a particular 
patient [13]. The content of a Library resource (i.e., the 
knowledge asset) may consist of arbitrary non-FHIR data (e.g., 
the XML schema for an information model) but can equally 
consist of nested FHIR resources. Furthermore, Library 
resources also allow the definition of parameter properties for 
enforcing prerequisites to using the library’s functionality. In 
this function, Library resources can provide some degree of 
composition of FHIR resources as required for the proposed 
meta resource.  
The FHIR ActivityDefinition resource describes an activity 
in a sharable and potentially machine-consumable form [14], 
which can then be utilized to define parts of a workflow, to 
describe a protocol, or to create a catalog of activities. This 
functionality is consistent with our objective of realizing meta 
resource as a reusable, shareable, design pattern-like 
component. An ActivityDefinition is intended to be interpreted 
by humans but can also be filled with enough structured data to 
instantiate resources that reflect the modeled information. The 
combined use of Library resources and ActivityDefinition 
resources has the potential for utilization to represent a 
significant portion of the meta resource concept. The structure 
of this approach is illustrated in Figure 10, which shows the 
realization of meta resources together with a supporting 
ParticipantTuple structure (both extensions are at the bottom of 
the figure) through the extension of a Library resource that 
references an Activity resource definition (Library and 
ActivityDefinition are reduced in the diagram to the attributes 
relevant for the discussion).

Figure 10. Composition of Library and ActivityDefinition. 
The name and description elements of the meta resource can 
be realized by the respective description and usage attributes in 
Library and ActivityDefinition resources. The participating 
resources are defined by the parameter relation of the Library to 
a set of ParameterDefinition structures. Among a series of other 
types, ParameterDefinitions can be of type Resource, and 
therefore can encode the knowledge about required resource 
types for a meta resource. The Library resource then references

an ActivityDefinition, which in turn groups the instances of the 
participating resources as Participant structures and provides the 
necessary FHIR profile for interacting with the resource. As a 
result, the meta resource extension is only left with defining the 
referenceStructure and the compositionStructure, which can be 
achieved by introducing a directed ParticipantTuple relation 
between Participant instances (in the same fashion as suggested 
for ResourceTuples in Section IV.A) 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper has presented the extension of the FHIR standard 
with the concept of a meta resource for design pattern-like 
capabilities and provided an examination of the alternative ways 
that meta resources can be positioned within five different facets 
of the FHIR standard. To present our work, we reviewed the 
background on medication reconciliation concepts and FHIR 
that we use for examples in Sections III & IV. We briefly 
reviewed the formal model for meta resources and the 
algorithmic translation of meta resources to FHIR bundles in 
Section III. In Section IV, we examined five facets of FHIR as 
alternative approaches for integrating meta resources into the 
FHIR standard. Specifically, we: explored meta resources as an 
extension to the FHIR UML model; assessed the relationship of 
the abstract DomainResource to meta resources; examined 
FHIR modules and the organizational and contextual 
information they could provide for meta resource integration; 
included meta resources into the FHIR information architecture; 
and considered meta resources as a composition of Library 
resources and ActivityDefiniton resources. Overall, we believe 
that meta resources offer an important design pattern-like 
capability to expand the FHIR standard and promote a much 
higher level of abstraction. 
Ongoing work focuses on several different areas. To fully 
determine the benefits from using the meta resource concept, we 
intend to work with the team of the medication reconciliation 
application to assist in reformulating their usage of FHIR 
resources into a MedicationReconciliation meta resource as 
given in Section III. Another area is to fully formalize the 
appropriate notation so that the meta resource can fully fit into 
the defined FHIR standard by using only predefined FHIR 
conventions. Finally, we will explore generation options for 
FHIR facets introduced in Section IV in addition to the 
discussed bundle generation.
