Abstract— Due to the lack of funding and expertise, small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs) have largely been excluded from 
benefiting the spill-over effect of web services-based supply 
chain systems. Theoretical and empirical researches are at a 
dearth in that the unmet needs of SMEs have not yet been 
promoted soundly. This paper assists in filling this gap by 
contributing to the literature through proposing an integrated 
model-driven service oriented supply chain framework that 
makes supply chain for SMEs affordable, easily accessible and 
free from technical ‘hurdles’. The proposed services oriented 
supply chain system uses a novel framework with five core 
services coupled with a mathematical optimization model to 
achieve cost minimization, inventory optimization and 
reasonable lead time. Simulation results show that our 
proposed solution is better than the traditional supply chain 
systems without optimization. Furthermore, it is dynamic and 
flexible in normal business operation environments. Several 
simulation run-time examples are used to illustrate the 
proposed solution.  
Keywords - Optimal model-driven framework; Web Services-
based Management Services;  supply chain management. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) comprise the 
largest business segment worldwide. For example, in Europe 
it is estimated that over 20.7 million SMEs make up 99.8% 
of all enterprises [1]. Similarly in Australia, they account for 
99% of all businesses and are the engine room of the 
economy. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
[2], these business entities comprise less than 200 employees 
and contribute to over 60% of the national employment, 
innovation, research and development (R&D) and industry 
value-added [3].   
Globally, SMEs generate a huge share of the GDP and 
are a key resource for new jobs and ongoing employment. 
They are also a breeding ground for entrepreneurship and 
new business ideas. As of July 2006, nearly 140 million 
SMEs around the world employed 65% of the total work 
force. Apparently, SMEs have been contributed to boosting 
economic and social development worldwide [4]. Recently, 
with the advent of online trading, businesses have been able 
to reach new markets and shorten their supply chains to 
greatly improve their business connections. 
Although 
there 
is 
significant 
SME 
participation 
contributing to the global economy, SMEs are relatively 
under-represented in the global economy, performing only 
between one quarter and one third of all manufactured 
exports, and accounting for less than 10% of Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) [5]. The main barriers that prevent SMEs 
from being globally active are related to: (1) high cost of 
hardware and software systems; (2) poor business 
infrastructure; and (3) inexperienced users of sophisticated 
software solutions.  
As the theoretical and practical literatures of cost-effective 
and feasible supply chain solutions to SMEs are still sparse 
[6] [7], this research investigates a service oriented supply 
chain system. In this, services management operations are 
integrated with a formal approach in order to address some 
of the above issues concerning SMEs. The paper is 
structured as follows. The next section briefly reviewed the 
literature and our research goal. In Section 3, a supply chain 
services-based integration framework is proposed and an 
optimal model is developed for the system, furthermore, 
solution process associated is provided. Thereafter Section 4 
figures out the proposed system architecture and gives out 
the random simulation example and related results. The last 
section concludes with the discussions of the limitations and 
the potential future directions. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH GOAL 
In contrast to SMEs, the number and scope of successful 
applications of supply chain operation systems in large 
companies has grown significantly in recent years. As an 
illustration, Procter & Gamble drove out non value-adding 
supply chain costs to save the company over $200 million by 
using an optimization model with an interactive approach 
[8]. United Parcel Services (UPS) implemented an 
optimization 
modeling 
system 
that 
simultaneously 
determined aircraft routs, fleet assignments, and package 
route to ensure overnight delivery at minimal cost. Changes 
based on a modeling system saved UPS over $87 million 
between 2000 and 2002 [9].  
  To tackle the limitations of SME business engagements 
with its trading partners using the available e-business 
infrastructure and resources, Supply Chain Management 
(SCM) has been studied. SCM is about active management 
of supply chain activities and relationships to maximize

customer value and achieve a sustainable competitive 
advantage [10]. It coordinates all the activities including the 
materials‟ physical transformation and information flow 
from suppliers to the end users. SCM represents a conscious 
effort by a firm or group of firms to develop and run supply 
chains in the most effective and efficient ways [11].  NAS 
defined an integrated supply chain as an association of 
customers and suppliers who work together to optimize their 
collective performance in the creation, distribution, and 
support of an end product (NAS 2000). Zaremba [12] stated 
that the supply chain aims to be able to link different 
functions and entities within and outside the company from 
raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, transportation, 
warehousing, and product sales. Along the supply chain, a 
potentially large number of trading partners such as 
manufacturers, 
parts 
suppliers, 
logistics 
suppliers, 
wholesalers 
and 
retailers 
work 
cooperatively 
[12]. 
Furthermore, Charleworth assumed that SMEs are not only 
seeking ways to integrate the disparate systems within the 
organization, they also intend to extend the whole domain 
beyond the boundaries of the organization to include their 
trading partners and customers [13]. 
E-business and supply chain applications often involve 
heterogeneous information resources that may take different 
standards, protocols and forms and operate in different 
environments with various complexities. Services-based 
system platform has advantages in meeting all these potential 
challenges. Momentum is gathering to apply services system 
solutions to supply chain problems and proves to be effective 
[14]. In 2008, Bose, Pal and Ye [15] introduced integration 
of ERP and SCM systems using the case of a valve 
manufacturer in China. The improved system successfully 
reduced lead time and up-grated inventory accuracy. Very 
recently, To achieve the environmental dynamics, Pan et al. 
[16] proposed Petri-net-based task model and achieved the 
connection of low level task with high level system services 
effectively through the task-to-service mapping algorithm. 
The research aims to establish a bridge between the arising 
tasks and potential services to achieve seamless tasks 
migrations among different application environments. Whilst 
considering the dynamic cooperation between services 
system and task framework from Pan et al. [16], our research 
focuses on the integration of services system and optimal 
modeling based on the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). 
More recently, Choi and Wacker‟s paper [17] discussed the 
main theoretical research in the operation management and 
supply chain management at the aspect of theory building 
over a period of recent 10 years.  
On the other side, in order to help resolve the systematic 
problems arising in the supply chain process substantially, 
many researchers are dedicated in the improvement and 
integration of mathematical models. Huang and Zhen [18] 
proposed the essential models of the processing in supply 
chain. In his research, by using the supply chain production 
strategies with symmetry information, the difference of 
production strategies under diverse information conditions 
was analyzed through simulation. However, the reality of 
producer and consumer determining the production strategies 
under the asymmetric information condition would cost more 
at storage and production processing stages. Moreover, for 
current global network system, not only the producers and 
stock-keepers relationship as addressed in this research but 
also the whole supply chain process partners need to be 
considered. Chang, Wang and Huang [19] studied the cost 
structure in supply chain. In his research, having the 
minimum Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and minimum 
net profit requirements, the static cost optimization model for 
distributor was established, with the adjustable parts of 
customer order quantities as the control variables. Still, the 
research only discussed some parts of the supply chain 
operations. In the area of the responsive capacity planning 
and scheduling, Agrawal, Sephan, and Tsay [20] described a 
methodology for managing capacity, inventory, and 
shipments for an assortment of retail products produced by 
multiple vendors to maximize the retailer‟s expected gross 
profit with varied capabilities and demand uncertainty. By 
systematic examination of the models in SCM research, 
Narasimban [21] illustrates the five supply chain decision 
models that demonstrate the importance of integrating the 
decisions across the SC with their application in global SCM 
and potential areas. The global economic network also led to 
the researchers work on global or integrated supply chain 
models, such as Huang [22], Miller [23].   
Though there have been well developed researches on the 
service 
management 
and 
operations 
optimizations 
respectively to support SCM, there is few system that 
successfully combined service management with optimal 
modeling seamlessly to achieve the real-time integration. To 
fill this gap, this article illustrates a model-driven based 
integrated supply chain service framework so that the 
participants can implement their roles and engagements for 
efficiency and profitability 
III. 
SOLUTION APPROACH 
A. The Proposed Model-driven Integrated Supply Chain 
Services-based Framework 
The main reason behind the SOA adoption is its support 
for flexible resources allocation, selection and management 
for SMEs. The model driven approach is to enable a dynamic 
solution model to match the nature of the tasks. This is to be 
incorporated into the proposed SOA architecture. The 
alternatives would be a grid or cloud-based model where the 
proposed solution model for SMEs would be generated.  
Our 
proposed 
system 
incorporates 
the 
optimal 
mathematical modeling into the practical supply chain 
services management framework through combining both 
theoretical foundations and business functions within a web 
services-based system. Further to the research work of Dai 
and Uden [24], the integrated supply chain service system 
designed in this paper aims to address the entry barriers of 
SMEs through the development and provision of core system 
services that are dynamically integrated with business 
services to facilitate business operations among trading 
partners (i.e., consumers and suppliers) in the supply chain. 
This will require a novel infrastructure in the aspect of 
integrating formal modeling with supply chain management 
processes among trading partners for SMEs. To ensure the

effectively using of available trading network resources and 
delivering practical benefits to SME users, our system help 
SMEs interacting with each other more easily and 
economically. This is achieved through the integration of 
global market resources and the real-time communication 
and interaction support by the proposed service system. 
The proposed services oriented supply chain integration has 
a specialized centre service that coordinates all the 
businesses including consumer and provider participants 
within its landscape. The system integrates all the resources 
within a defined landscape to achieve the goal of optimizing 
the whole supply chain management through five core 
services in SOA. These five core services are in the 
following categories: Knowledge Management Services, 
Data Management Services, Task Management Services, 
Information Services and Communication Management 
Services [24]. With the help of the core services, the higher-
level services such as Goal Directed Inference (GDI) service 
and Event Driven Inference (EDI) service are developed. 
GDI and EDI services respond to SME users‟ needs in 
different ways, e.g. event-driven by triggering purchase order 
issuing when sales or inventory reaches to a certain level, 
and goal driven by focusing on user specific request such as 
fulfilling a specific purchasing request. GDI is particularly 
supported by two services that are plan generation and plan 
execution 
that 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
mathematical 
programming in the next section. GDI provides a model-
driven solution in the proposed system. Figure 1 t as attached 
to this paper shows the technical configuration of the 
services system.  
The participants are supposed to be SME users, who can 
access the market information in relation to their objectives 
including low cost and timely delivery through highly 
optimized and dynamically integrated supply chain channels. 
The requirements on SME users are to make their consumers 
requirements for certain product and service in standardized 
format. The system is to ensure the requirements are 
transparent to services providers. The process of running the 
supply chain is executed by the Knowledge Manager (as 
shown in the Figure 1), which will be improved by the 
optimization model mentioned in the next section.  
 
B. Optimal Model-driven Development in the System  
One important contribution towards services oriented 
supply chain system is to incorporate an optimization model 
into the service system that includes GDI service. . In order 
to achieve maximum benefits among the SMEs within the 
objective supply chain system, a nonlinear optimization 
model is introduced and described as below. 
The annotations for the model are listed as follows. 
Sets: 
Q :  Quantity of the primitive order 
Functions or variables in the objective function: 
:  Functions for the final integrated supply chains profit; 
:    
Each sub- supply chain profit; 
:  
The total income; 
 :  
The material cost; 
:  
The inventory expense; 
:  
The transportation fare; 
Parameters: 
:     The time the whole proposed supply chain process in 
our system will take; 
: Requirement of the time spending; 
:   Presents the quantity of each independent supply chain. 
 
Optimal Model: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 where Objective function defines the maximum function 
which including the objective function for the system profits. 
The part of constraint (1)
 
 is the quadratic penalty function to limit the expectation 
minimum profit. 
 is the penalty factor, 
 is set to be 
company‟s minimal profit requirement. The second 
constraint 
 minimizes the fee of all 
expenditure therefore to control the cost of the whole supply 
chain process. The third constraint 
 is set to meet 
time requirement from order. Last,
 presents the quantity 
of each independent supply chain. The objective is to 
maximize profit, or reciprocally minimize cost.  
    To simplify the understanding and usage of the optimal 
model, we supposed the incoming order with certain price of 
the productions including unit cost for the inventory, and 
transportation fare. However, it could certainly be extended 
to sub-functions for each supply chain processes. For 
example, the material cost function 
 could be 
calculated depending on the different proportions of 
ingredients.  
Comparing to the previous supply chain models being 
used practically, we introduce a penalty function into our 
optimal system to keep track of the control of the system 
profit. We also set time constraint to ensure the implement 
procedure complying with certain required delay time.  
 
C. Solution Process  
The algorithm of our proposed optimized supply chain is 
depicted in Figure 2. 
Once order requirement comes in, it will trigger the real-
time response procedure of our service oriented supply chain

system. The basic rules for the system considering the 
optimal model are, „first come first serve‟, „simultaneous 
processing of multi-services under time and capacity 
constraints‟, and „check the stock inventory before  
manufacturing‟.  Figure 2 describes the main process of the 
plan generator processing the orders under optimal rules. 
This algorithm follows up the optimal model described 
earlier in Section III B.  
When the primitive order task entered into the system 
shown as „Demand‟, the procedure is activated. The system 
will check the inventory based on the „check the stock 
inventory before manufacturing‟ rule. The system then 
calculates the cost involved and generating production order 
under the constraints of the model discussed in Section III B.

SIMULATION AND APPLICATION 
The optimization process adopts a multiple objectives, 
multiple agents approach [25]. The global optimal solution is 
obtained by mathematical programming. Scenario analysis 
approach is adopted to illustrate how the proposed system 
works and compare the performance of the proposed system 
with the other alternatives. 
The processes of one scenario as an example which is 
simulated by our model-driven based supply chain services 
system are listed as below. This system is currently under 
experiment with twelve business entities across four sectors, 
i.e., retail, distribution, manufacturing and material supply. 
For run-time simulation, retailers issued purchase orders that 
trigger dynamic supply chain channels formation. The initial 
status of simulation in our system is conducted by randomly 
generated purchase orders from retailers, , e.g., retailer 1 
ordered 670 items in figure 3. Secondly, these figures are 
screen shots that were dynamically taken during the running 
of our experimental system. Since the initial situation for 
order is produced randomly by the system, the scenarios 
could be different when every time you run the experimental 
system. Last, to help understand our example, it needs to 
emphasize that our system is working on integrating all the 
participants‟ resources of the supply chain and endeavoring 
to optimize the allocations and chains arrangement.  
Therefore, the optimization process of our system is trying to 
work out optimal supply chain solutions for all the 
participants to save time and cost.   
Briefly introducing, the processes for the simulation are 
divided into: set up the model (including the request, 
available resources, manufacturing and inventory capability, 
etc.), e.g., figure 3; calculate the scenario with traditional 
approach which is not using combination of services 
management and optimal model-driven, e.g., figure 4; give 
out our proposed optimal supply chain services management 
solution, e.g., figure 5.

Setting Up the Model 
 
Figure 4 
Traditional Approach to this Scenario 
 
Figure 5 
Proposed optimal supply chain services management solution 
The result shows that for the scenario absent of supply 
chain integration, the three different supply chains‟ total cost 
adds up to $35016 and the lead time is 57 days.  While 
through using our proposed model in this paper, the total cost 
is reduced to $16995, which saves more than 50% overall.

Though the savings in the costs are disproportionately 
distributed, it is apparently that all the SMEs are better off. 
The lead-time reduced to 0, which is consistent with the 
“just-in-time” approach. 
SME users can conveniently access our new integrated 
model-driven service through a Web browser or hand-held 
devices such as mobile phones from any corner of the world.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
  The research proposed a feasible and cost-effective way 
to enable SMEs to access supply chain management tools, 
which used to be the privilege of large corporations. The 
marriage between supply chain integration and mathematical 
optimization techniques is a critical contribution to 
innovation by this research. The simulation results show that 
our proposed framework significantly improves SMEs‟ 
situation by saving costs and reducing the lead time. 
  This paper is subjected to the following limitations: (1) 
the simulation is not robust enough to produce any general 
conclusions; (2) minutes of all the details within the supply 
chain has yet to be specified; (3) the input and output 
communication among all the parties have not been 
considered. 
  Future research will focus on applying the proposed 
framework to the real world situations. In addition, a mobile 
set- based model can also be designed to free users from all 
the details of supply chain and arduous supply chain 
management activities.
