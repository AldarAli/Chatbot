for two models of OFDM receivers. Performance of VBLAST 
and LD-STBC-VBLAST receivers has been compared. The Bit

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, WLANs have gained on popularity. This 
is due to the fact that thanks to the advanced technologies 
they already offer high quality (with low error rate) and high 
speed transmissions. Simultaneously, constant grow of 
demand in even higher network throughput and quality 
transmission are observed. Therefore, insightful research on 
WLANs is necessary to change the existing standards [1]. 
As theoretical and practical research carried out lately [2-4] 
has shown, transmission through multi-path wireless 
channels may improve the system’s capacity if used 
adequately. According to Bäolcskei and Paulraj [3] a 
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system enables 
increasing of a wireless channel’s capacity proportionally to 
the growing number of transmit and receive antennae. A 
practical implementation of a MIMO system is shown by 
Wolniansky et al. [5]. It is the so-called Vertical Bell 
Laboratories Layered Space Time (VBLAST) system, 
which has a simple structure, yet it offers high spectral 
efficiency. In VBLAST, a single data stream is divided into 
several sub-streams transmitted simultaneously by several 
antennae as a result of which transmission speed may be 
improved.  
Literature suggests many options to form receivers that 
would receive signals transmitted in MIMO system [2-5]. 
One of the methods is Maximum Likelihood (ML). This 
detection method offers the lowest error rate but is rather 
difficult to implement. Wolniansky et al. [5] propose MIMO 
signal detection based on the Zero-Forcing (ZF) criterion. 
The ZF method is characterized by relatively low 
computational requirements. However, its weakness is 
certainly the so-called noise enhancement occurring in the 
case of minor SNR values. Considerably effective detection 
algorithms that use the so-called QR decomposition of 
channel matrix have been proposed in [6] [7]. Another 
advantage of MIMO transmission is quality improvement 
with reference to drop in error rate. This is obtained by 
using Space Time Block Codes (STBC) [8].  
The superior purpose of spatial multiplexing is to 
maximize data transmission speed while the essence of 
space-time coding is to ensure high quality resulting from 
maximizing the diversification. These two advantages 
offered by MIMOs exclude each other. The so-called Linear 
Dispersion (LD) method was proposed by Hassibi and 
Hochwald [9]. The method attempts to use both the 
aforesaid advantages of MIMO transmission: spatial 
multiplexing and diversification gain. As test results show 
[9-11], owing to the method high transmission speed may be 
obtained with any configuration of antenna systems on both 
sides of the radio connection with simultaneous code gain. 
Solutions known for the MIMO transmission, such as the 
VBLAST [5] algorithm or ZF, may be applied for receiving 
[4-7].  
The LD-STBC-VBLAST method was used by the 
authors for OFDM transmission in a WLAN system. 
Simulation results for selected receive algorithms that may 
be used for WLAN 802.11n MIMO/OFDM system are 
presented. Performance, in the terms of BER, LD-STBC-
VBLAST and VBLAST receivers has been compared. The 
analyzed system uses a multi-stream transmission in which 
a part of spatial streams is STBC-coded and a part is 
transmitted without coding. It was assumed that individual 
subcarriers are modulated with 2-PSK, 4-PSK or 16-QAM 
signal. The purpose hereof is to compare the operation of 
the aforesaid system for two different receivers: LD-STBC-
VBLAST, using the LD (Linear Dispersion) algorithm [9] 
and VBLAST [5] and to check the suitability of the 
abovementioned receivers for the improvement of data 
transmission quality in WLAN 802.11n. 
The BER and PER were determined for the E type 
transmission channel model [12]. The simulation referred to 
transmission through E type WLAN channel because, as test

results shown by Kotrys et al. in e.g. [4], the lowest error 
rate has been obtained in a MIMO transmission using the 
channel. It was also assumed that the Channel State 
Information (CSI) is known in the receiver. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes 
the simulation model. Section 3 presents the receptions 
algorithms used in researches. Section 4 contains simulation 
results that have been carried out, and, finally, Section 5 
includes a summary and conclusions. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
In order to assess the quality of operation of the LD-
STBC-VBLAST receiver in WLAN, many simulation 
experiments have been made. We used to the simulation the 
MATLAB environment. The model of the simulated system 
enables BER and PER determination. A block diagram of 
the transmitting part of the simulated system is presented in 
Fig. 1.  
 
In the transmitter, the information sequence d is coded 
by a convolutional encoder [171 133] with rate R=½, used 
in the 802.11n standard [1]. The coded u sequence 
generated by the encoder is divided into Nss spatial streams 
u1,…,uNss. Three different variants of MIMO transmissions 
are possible: a non-coded multistream transmission, an 
STBC-coded stream transmission, a transmission where a 
part of streams is non-coded and a part is STBC-coded.  
Each of the spatial streams is subject to interleaving in 
blocks reflecting the successively assigned OFDM symbols 
as per the 802.11n recommendation [1]. Depending on the 
valence of the applied modulation, the bits of the interleaved 
sequence v are adequately grouped and mapped into the 
elements of 2-PSK, 4-PSK or 16-QAM constellations. 
Signals Xt(k) represent the signals transmitted on the k-
subcarrier of the OFDM symbol. Signals that modulate 
subcarriers within the t-symbol OFDM form a vector of Xt 
signals. Samples of the OFDM symbol in time domain are 
formed using the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) 
algorithm. They make up the xt vector. Then, samples of the 
OFDM symbol are supplemented with a Cyclic Prefix (CP) 
and transformed from Digital to Analogue (D/A). 
To adhere to the 802.11n standard [1], in the tested 
system, each OFDM symbol uses the 52 sub-carriers to 
transmit data, 4 subcarriers are used to transmit the so-called 
pilot signals. OFDM is performed with the use of the 64-
point Fourier transform. The duration time of a single 
OFDM symbol is 4µs with the sampling frequency of 
20MHz. To avoid the intersymbol interference, the 0.8µs 
cyclic prefix is added. The transmission throughput of the 
analyzed system depends on the number of spatial streams 
that were used and valence of modulation applied to each 
subcarrier of the OFDM signal. A specification of the 
analyzed system variants is shown in Table I.

RECEPTION ALGORITHMS  
In the analyzed system, data transmission is performed 
using two, three or four spatial streams. Correct 
synchronization and estimation of the channel state in the 
receiver was assumed. A total of signals transmitted by all 
transmit antennae (modified as a result of channel passing) 
reaches each receive antenna. The signal from receive 
antenna after sampling is transformed, with the Fast Fourier

Transform (FFT), from time domain to frequency domain 
and subsequently demodulated. Two receiving methods 
have been analyzed in the paper, VBLAST and LD-STBC-
VBLAST receivers.  
The VBLAST receive algorithm consists in iterative 
reduction of the intersymbol interference between signals 
transmitted by different transmit antennas and may be 
illustrated as follows [5]:

The receive method based on the LD-STBC-VBLAST 
algorithm has been adopted by Longoria-Gandara et al. [10] 
to OFDM WLAN transmission. The method is applied in 
the case where in the MIMO system non-coded streams are 
transmitted by selected antennae and simultaneously STBC 
coded streams are transmitted by other antennae. 
The transmit part of the LD-STBC-VBLAST system is 
presented in Fig. 1. The basic idea of the systems is 
concurrent transmission of spatial streams both non-coded 
and space-time block coded. Then, is was assumed to denote 
the system having nS of non-coded spatial streams and nB of 
STBC coded spatial streams as (nS,nB)-LD-STBC-VBLAST, 
for example the description (0,2) denotes the system which 
use two STBC encoded streams. 
In the LD-STBC-VBLAST receiver, the theory of linear 
dispersion described by Hassibi and Hochwald [9] was used 
to demodulate. Therefore, during modulation signals 
received from both non-coded and STBC coded streams 
may be treated the same. 
Further on, the following designations have been assumed: 
nA – number of antennae in a single STBC stream; 
NT – number of transmit antennae; 
NR – number of receive antennae; 
nB – number of STBC coded streams; 
nS – number of streams not coded with STBC 
Table II below shows which signals are transmitted by 
two individual antennae in subsequent time intervals [11]. 
This constitutes a description of the time and space coding 
performed for a given antenna configuration [9].

In the receiver, similarly to [10], the so-called QR

This decomposition consists in splitting the channel matrix 
into two matrixes whose product equals the channel matrix: 
 = () 
(16) 
Matrix Q is a rectangular matrix 2NR x nSYM. Whereas 
matrix R is a square, upper triangular matrix nSYM x nSYM,, 
where nSYM=2(nS+nB). A detailed description of the QR 
decomposition algorithm may be found in [6]. 
After determining the Q and R matrix for the H channel 
matrix, linear detection of the received signal takes place in 
the receiver. The detection algorithm [7] is as follows:

IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS  
By means of the computer simulation, we have 
determined the BER and PER depending on the SNR value. 
An assumption has been made that transmission takes place 
in E type WLAN channel [12]. A comparison of the quality 
of MIMO systems operation using the following two types 
of receivers has been presented: LD-STBC-VBLAST and 
VBLAST depending on the number of spatial streams and 
selected modulations: 2-PSK, 4-PSK, 16-QAM. In the 
simulations, ideal synchronization has been assumed as well

as that the receiver knows the CSI. The transmitted packets 
were 1000-byte long. OFDM technique has been applied. 
The 64-point IFFT/FFT has been implemented, where data 
is transmitted on 52 subcarriers. Additionally, four 
subcarriers have been used to transmit pilot signals and 8 
subcarriers constituted a protection interval. To assess 
correctness of operation of the proposed simulation model, a 
series of tests confirming the results taken from literature 
[4][5][7] have been performed. Different combinations of 
parameter setups for the investigated MIMO systems have 
been simulated. The most representative results have been 
selected for the presentation.  
In Figures 2 and 3, PER and BER curves are illustrated 
for the VBLAST and LD-STBC-VBLAST receive systems 
including two and three spatial streams for different number 
of transmit Nt and receive Nr antennae. Transmission in 
these systems takes place at the speed of 52 and 78Mb/s 
respectively with the WLAN channel type E [12].  
Considering the transmission with two spatial streams 
(Fig. 2), with PER at 10-3, (0,2) LD-STBC-VBLAST system 
proved the best properties. Here, transmission takes place 
using four transmit and receive antennae. The (0,2) LD-
STBC-VBLAST system offers 1% PER with about 17 dB. 
The (1,1) LD-STBC-VBLAST system including three 
transmit and receive antennae is by approximately 6 dB 
inferior. The system employing VBLAST receiver, where 
the number of antennae equals the number of spatial streams 
for the same level of PER (at 10-3), is inferior to (1,1) LD-
STBC-VBLAST system by 0.2 dB. The (0,2) LD-STBC-
VBLAST system offers approximately 7 dB gain comparing 
to the (1,1) LD-STBC-VBLAST and VBLAST systems 
with the BER of about 10-4, respectively. The throughput for 
these systems is equal 52Mb/s. 
 
Figure 2. PER and BER for two-spatial-stream-systems, modulation 
16QAM, 52Mb/s. 
Fig. 3 represents the simulation results for systems with 
three spatial streams and obtained throughput 78Mb/s. For 
1% PER the best results have been noted in the case of (1,2) 
LD-STBC-VBLAST system including five transmit and 
receive antennae. This level is obtained when SNR equals 
19 dB. The (2,1) LD-STBC-VBLAST systems is inferior by 
3.5 dB. It has four transmit and receive antennae. The 
number of antennae in the system employing VBLAST 
receiver equals the number of spatial streams and is equal 3. 
This has proven to perform (PER at 10-43) poorer than the 
best presented (1,2) LD-STBC-VBLAST system by 6 dB. 
The (1,2) LD-STBC-VBLAST system offers approximately 
3 dB gain comparing to the (2,1) LD-STBC-VBLAST and 
BLAST systems with the BER of about 10-4, respectively. 
 
Figure 3. PER and BER for three-spatial-stream-systems, modulation 
16QAM, 78Mb/s. 
A system that uses LD-STBC-VBLAST receive enables 
enhancement of transmission speed with coincident quality 
improvement through application of an additional spatial 
stream. To improve quality, an STBC coding on additional 
spatial stream must be used. If the number of spatial streams 
grows from one to two, a 100% increment of speed is 
obtained with simultaneous minor improvement in PER for 
2-PSK, 4-PSK and 16-QAM modulation. If the number of 
spatial streams grows from two to three, the speed increment 
is 50% with 1% improvement in PER by 3 dB for 2-PSK 
modulation and by 4 dB for modulations 4-PSK and 16-
QAM. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented a proposal of use LD-STBC-
VBLAST reception for WLAN systems with a hybrid 
transmission. A multistream transmission was suggested 
where a part of spatial streams was STBC coded and a part 
was transmitted without any codes. The impact of transmit 
diversification on the quality of transmission has been 
analyzed. Based on the simulation results it may be clearly 
observed that the transmit diversification offers better 
properties of the transmission system. The LD-STBC-
VBLAST receiver proves the best results in BER and PER 
when compared to the system with a VBLAST receiver at 
the cost of increased number of antennae.  
As it results from the performed tests, the method that 
has been applied (LD-STBC-VBLAST) allows increasing of 
the transmission speed with no deterioration of the error rate 
through suitable selection of the transmitted spatial streams.

The system with LD-STBC-VBLAST receiver allows 
iterative reduction of interference. Therefore, the BER and 
PER results are considerably better than in the case of the 
VBLAST receiver system. Given the presented simulation 
results, we can suppose that the investigated LD-STBC-
VBLAST receiver could be successfully used in next 
wireless networks which are currently being developed. 
 As a future research task, another reception methods 
should be examined and complexity evaluation of 
investigated reception algorithms should be perform.
