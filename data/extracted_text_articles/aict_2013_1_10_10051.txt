Abstract—In this paper, we propose a new call 
admission control (CAC) scheme for wireless cellular 
systems supporting a hot-spot cell. Two strategies for CAC 
are assumed. One is based on the number of calls, which are 
accepted or not, the other is based on the interference level. 
The proposed CAC can regulate the call attempts with 
packet by adopting measured interference used for matrix. 
A function, specifically a linear interpolation function based 
on Inverse Transform theory is used to convert controlled 
predictive average admission ratio in a call rejection ratio. 
Then, a call admission ratio is obtained from the call 
rejection ratio. Numerical results show that the proposed 
scheme yields better performance than the conventional 
scheme does under the heavy calls on a hot-spot cell.

INTRODUCTION 
In the future wireless communications, the main 
problem is focused on how to efficiently utilize the 
limited frequency spectrum. The CAC schemes have 
been mainly developed in switching system maintained 
by stored program control. The system is formed with a 
plurality of processors, which are distributed and are 
formed in a hierarchical structure. The base station 
performs a predetermined call control process and a non-
call control process in accordance with the internal 
process. In addition, a designated protocol is performed 
through an interaction between base stations. When 
interference of a base station is increased, such a load 
affects other base stations and the entire cells. As a result, 
the service of the system may be interrupted thereby. 
Hot-spot activation scheme in classical wire telephone is 
based on weighted interference. The conventional call 
admission schemes are directly used by the weighted 
interference so as to ensure the rapid response of control 
[1]. However weighted interference provides only rough 
information on the predictive offered calls, because the 
offered load is caused by a call. To reduce this 
degradation, precise CAC scheme based on interference 
is required. This paper analyzes the effect of weighted 
interference and call fail ratio on the system performance 
in theory. Weighted interference efficiency equations are 
derived for both systems with and without CAC. Analysis 
results show that call admission can get maximum call 
efficiency while adjusting call admission can improve 
call fail for systems without CAC. 
This paper is organized as follows: In section II, 
related works have been studied and in section III cell, 
traffic and system model are proposed, and also we 
classifies calls in terms of their characteristics. Section 
IV describes the call admission activation scheme using 
interference and call success ratio considering matrix, 
and also shows the theoretical backgrounds by re-
analyzing the relation between interference and wireless 
channel resources. In section V, we evaluate the 
proposed CAC model. Finally, Section VI presents the 
conclusion.  
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
The capacity of a cell is limited by its interference 
and channel resource, which depends on offered calls [1]. 
The CAC schemes associated with communication 
systems have been mainly developed on switching system 
maintained by stored program control [2]. Recently CAC 
has been dealt with for data service only [3], [4]. CAC is 
necessary to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) for 
the users in service, which is mainly concentration on a 
hot-spot area. In hot-sot area, cell poses significant 
challenges because of interference, user mobility, and 
limited channel resource. To efficiently accept call 
attempts and effectively maximize cell capacity, the cell 
size is getting smaller. However the smaller cell size is, 
the higher interference is. So we need to improve the call 
admission ratio in bad interference environments.  
The CAC thresholds derived from the traffic theory 
[5] and [10]. In [10], the tri-threshold bandwidth 
reservation scheme supports multi-class services bearing 
differentiated QoS requirements. It is directed to a 
mobile switch formed with processes for a judgment such 
as an admission, a control and a release. We used 
weighted interference as traffic load for CAC. A QoS-
aware wireless MAC protocol called Hybrid Contention-
Free Access (H-CFA) and a VoIP call admission control 
technique called the Traffic Stream Admission Control 
(TS-AC) algorithm has been presented in [11] to support 
VoIP, specially on WiFi technologies which have already 
matured commercially. 
It is practically, however, hard to apply to the real-
time system. In this paper we suggest that CAC scheme 
safely maintain the call service by analyzing the 
characteristics of the weighted interference and the call 
fail ratio due to congestion, and increases the call

admission ratio [6]. We deal with data traffic as well as 
voice. 
III. PROPOSED MODEL 
A. Cell Model 
Fig. 1 depicts a cluster of 19 cells being built around 
interfering base stations. Base station density is based on 
[9] (cell radius of 4 km for rural/macro and 1.5 km for 
urban/macro have been assumed). Some comparative 
simulations were also performed with cell radio as low 
as 500m and as high as 9 km. The contribution from 
interferers beyond the closest 19 is considered to be 
insignificant.

B. Traffic Model 
We consider that the call arrival process at the base 
station is Poisson [7]. Assuming that the call generating 
process of all the users in a hot-spot cell are independent, 
the call arrival process from each and every user is also 
Poisson [8], with a mean call arrival ratio l , where

The movement of each user is modeled by the two-
dimensional random walk and is stationary process 
including handover from/to neighboring cells. User’s 
channel holding time follows a negative exponential 
distribution with mean

. 
The call admission activation function periodically 
audits the intensity of call, weighted interference, and call 
success ratio by time t, in order to avoid the degrading of 
the performance of system and service ratio. Gradually, a 
grading limitation of execution module is performed in 
accordance with the call admission status. The following 
calls are commonly used to simulate call admission 
situations [6]: 
l 
Incoming call (new calls) 
l 
Incoming handover call (from other cell) 
l 
Outgoing handover call (to other cell) 
l 
Terminating call 
Table I shows the characteristics of call services 
according to the location-generated services. 
C. System Model Description 
Considering hot-spot area in base station, some 
strategies for base station on which calls may concentrate 
is needed. To obtain the current interference level, a call 
admission activation scheme must be able to manage 
interference. For a simple expression of the calculations 
latter, we use a matrix presentation. The weight sequence 
in base station can be written as a vector by

is required. Interference among base stations can be 
written as a matrix by

IV. CAC MODEL 
A. Call Admission Activation Scheme 
The call admission activation scheme is an 
autonomous 
call 
admission-monitoring 
module 
to 
calculate interference on a base station. As a call 
admission activation scheme starts, it measures weighted 
interference according to the cell situations. It also shows 
the scheme showing the entire detecting of the process of 
CAC feature, which is formed by an initialization, a 
judgment, activation, and a release. As heavy call 
attempts disappear, call admission state is released and 
the system returns to the normal state and the following 
four cases will happen; 
 
1). 
Initialization of call admission activation: upon 
starting this call admission activation scheme, stores the c
urrent weighted interference for adaptive average weighte
d interference after call admission monitoring time interv
al, 
2). 
Reanalysis of weighted interference: the scheme
 selects the blocking ratio of call services and calculates a
 new value of weighted interference with maximum interf
erence. After calculating a new weighted interference, the
 current adaptive average weighted interference sets up b
oth new weighted interference and previous adaptive aver

age weighted interference, 
3). 
Adjustment of heavy transient status: when the a
daptive average weighted interference from the weighted 
interference including blocking ratio of call services can 
be calculated, the gradient is adjusted to adopt a heavy tr
ansient status, 
4). 
Activation of call admission situations: finally, 
we get the adjusted predictive average weighted interfere
nce by multiplying adaptive average weighted interferenc
e by the degree of heavy transient status and we activate t
he call admission according to the adjusted predictive av
erage weighted interference. 
B. Inverse Transform for Call Admission Ratio 
The call admission ratio is generated that adjusted 
predictive average weighted interference compares with 
interval for basic call admission ratio (BCAR) and linear 
interpolation is used for calculating basic call admission 
ratio. The basic call admission ratio has a capability for 
admitting a call according to weighted interference. The 
real underlying distribution, 
F(x)
, of basic call 
admission ratio (the lower line curve in Fig. 2) can be 
estimated by the empirical cdf, 
F (' x)
 (the upper line 
curve in Fig. 2). The particular curve in Fig. 2 illustrates 
one changed shape of this underlying distribution, and 
also that 
F (' x)
 is an estimate of 
F(x)
.

F (' x)
) and theoretical (

The empirical cdf 
F (' x)
 is defined by using the 
information in Table II. Each interval defines two points 
on the graph, which are connected by a straight line. The 
inverse transform technique applies directly to generating 
call admission ratio variation, X. Recalling the graphical 
interpretation of the technique, first select adjusted 
predictive average weighted interference, x. Symbolically 
this is written as [8]

C. Concept of Call Admission and Rejection 
Assuming that call state keeps in one state in one 
period, the switching probability between in-adjacent 
states is very small, so it can be assumed switching just 
happens 
between 
adjacent 
states. 
In 
wireless 
communication systems, if the call admission scheme of 
next call is determined according to current call 
processing condition, and call state is normally in j-th 
state, the following three cases will happen. 
l 
Call admission scheme is adjusted according to 
(j-1)-th call state in which calls are allowed, in t
his case, call efficiency is lost but communicatio
n quality can be achieved.

-th call state that comes up to maximum boundar
y to be processed, in this case, no call efficiency 
is wasted and communication quality can also be
 achieved.  
l 
Call admission scheme is adjusted according to 
(j+1)-th call state that exceeds maximum bounda
ry to be processed, in this case, the call cannot s
atisfy communication quality request, accordingl
y call rejection scheme adjusted by call type is n
eeded.  
D. CAC Scheme 
CAC scheme shows the entire controlling process of 
the call admission situations, which is formed of an 
interval selection, a call rejecting ratio calculation, 
gradient calculation through linear interpolation, and call 
control by the variable call admission ratio (VCAR). The 
variable call admission ratio can be derived from BCAR 
by calculating the linear interpolation, which can improve 
the call admission ratio. According to the variable call 
admission ratio, the decision of whether or not to accept 
calls from mobile subscriber is subject. The CAC scheme 
on base station is as follows: 
1). 
We calculate total interferences of base station b
y using an matrix of each base station.  
2). 
Adjusted predictive average weighted interferen
ce (
ri _apawi
) receives from call admission activation 
module monitored a weighted interference to activate a h
eavily loaded situations, 
3). 
The scheme tries to find an interval for 
adjusted predictive average weighted interference from T
able II, 
4). 
If found,

to calculate the BCAR is g

5). 
Then, calculate VCAR through linear interpolati
on based on the calculated BCAR, 
6). 
Finally, call requested from base station is adjus
ted by variable call admission ratio according to the 
adjusted predictive average weighted interference value. 
If the level of interval for adjusted predictive average wei
ghted interference is 1, state is normal. If it is 2, state is r
eady. Otherwise each type of call can be accepted or reje
cted by the level of interval for adjusted predictive avera
ge weighted interference. 
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
A. Simulation Assumptions 
Here numerical results are given for adaptive CAC. 
The processing of calls in base stations usually takes 
place in several consecutive steps, separated in time. 
When such systems are simulated, the calls are generated 
pseudo-randomly, for instance with an exponential 
distribution of inter arrival times. We suppose the 
number of the maximum subscriber 12,000 if the busy 
hour traffic per subscriber is 0.06 Erlang, when the total 
Erlang is 720(12,000 * 0.06). For CAC, the blocking 
ratio is calculated by using the well-known Erlang B 
formula. The calls are assumed to have a constant 
holding time of 100 seconds for busy hour call per 
subscriber: 2.16 calls (0.06 * 3,600 / 100). Completed 
calls in busy hour are 25,920 (12,000 * 2.16). For offered 
calls, it is still possible that maximum base station 
efficiency (= permitted weighted interference) used for 
base station is below 95%. From the assumptions 
mentioned above, we simulated that the traffic is from 
12,960 up to 38,880, when the offered load is from 50% 
(normal call state) to 150% (heavy transient call state) 
[1]-[2], [10]. 
 
 
B. Performance Analysis 
Fig. 3 compares the proposed scheme with the 
conventional one in terms of weighted interference, 
where the ordinate represents the weighted interference 
and the abscissa the time that is determined by call 
admission activation scheme.  Fig. 3 shows the examples 
of between without_cacl and with_cac under the call 
admission state as the weighted interference. The 
without_cac means that the offered load results from the 
processing of the conventional scheme. The with_cac 
means the results from the processing of scheme. The 
adjusted 
predictive 
average 
weighted 
interference 
increases due to the increase of weighted interference 
depending on lots of call fail. There is a difference in the 
figure, which system performance of proposed scheme is 
higher than conventional one under with_cac. It is 
observed that a hot-spot cell has to reduce the number of 
calls to maintain the same QoS. The difference between 
proposed scheme and conventional one can be explained 
by the reanalysis of weighted interference with calls. The 
main simulation performance measures are variable call 
admission ratio for basic call admission ratio.

admission state as the weighted interference. VCAR 
decreases due to the reduction of BCAR depending on 
the with_cac. Especially, in time period-7, note that 
BCAR decreases to 5%,  whereas the proposed scheme is 
able to keep  20% of VCAR on a level with the previous 
state(time period-6). The result shows that VCAR does 
have a higher capacity than that of conventional approach 
based on BCAR. This phenomenon can be explained by 
the fixed value of BCAR for the conventional scheme. It 
is observed that a hot-spot cell has to reduce the number 
of calls to limit the heavy traffic load as an interference 
of base stations.

VI. CONCLUSION 
We proposed new CAC scheme that offers stability of 
calls in a hot-spot area possibly, and ensures both QoS on 
call arrival and handover processing. We regard call 
arrival ratio as a traffic load as interferences, which 
means that it obtains performance improvement of about 
4.3% compared with the conventional approach is not 
capable of detecting the heavy transient call attempts, 
whereas our proposed scheme allows system to overcome 
the problems encountered in the conventional approach 
regulating calls well. The call arrival, handover, 
interference, and call success ratio are derived based on 
the hot-spot environment and traffic model. In conclusion, 
it is emphasized that in addition to the weighted 
interference and offered load presented here, congestion 
control mechanism among base stations must also take 
into account a variety of technological issues (e.g., a 
number of admission ratio, an admission/rejection 
interval, cell radius).
