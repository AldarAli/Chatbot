Abstract—Recent reviews in Telemedicine (TM) detected 
methodological flaws in economic assessment. Our brief review 
addresses the perspective adoption problem, investigating to 
what extent adopting a broader point of view could have an 
impact on TM economic studies and consequential diffusion. 
Out of 486 articles found, 15 studies were selected for full-text 
assessment. Most of them showed an improvement in 
methodology if compared with the past TM economic 
evaluations. However, only 4 papers reported data from the 
social perspective and among them 3 presented productivity 
loss. Although some positive results in economic evaluation 
were observed, to date it is not clear to what extent TM is paid 
for by third parties or has to be paid by the patients. 
Keywords-economic evaluation perspective; cost-effectiveness; 
cost-utility; review;  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Telemedicine (TM) is a relative recently established 
field, nonetheless it is dominating the debate in the scientific 
community. Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICT) constant improvement resulted in various benefits for 
the users. In fact it should be considered the revolution in 
users’ life when the ICT reached a wide diffusion. In less 
than 30 years, the average consumer passed from barely 
communicating with Total Access Communication System 
(TACS), to gathering lap-top duties in smart-phones. This 
overturn in everyday lifestyle, completely changed habits 
and therefore the time spent in different daily life tasks. 
While mobile communications and Internet diffusion have 
already shown to have a positive effect on GDP and 
productivity growth, [1,2] the same could not be stated for 
telemedicine. In the global financial crisis setting, resources 
allocated to the healthcare sector were significantly 
diminished; this scenario asks for cost-saving initiatives, but 
also for innovative and effective strategies able to make the 
healthcare system financially sustainable. Within this 
framework, Medicare and Medicaid provided reimbursement 
for many telemedicine programs for preserving high quality 
healthcare and pursuing a cost-saving strategy in those areas 
where specialized employees are not available (e.g., rural 
districts) [3]. The forecasted market value for telecare was 
predicted to double from $9.8 billion (2010) to $27.3 billion 
(2016); 18.6% being the compound annual growth rate, 
having not substantial hinders on its growth [4]. 
Nevertheless, 
effectiveness 
and 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
telemedicine and its related fields are not clear yet. Both 
early and the most recent literature reviews [5-10] report 
contradictory results on the actual impact of telemedicine in 
terms of costs and effectiveness. However, most of the 
reviewers observed a high prevalence of poor designed and 
developed studies, probably responsible for reluctance in 
adopting telemedicine. In addition, it is not clear to what 
extent telemedicine should be considered an only third-party 
payer's matter or not. There is a common agreement about 
cost-utility analysis to be performed adopting National 
Health Service (NHS) perspective. Nonetheless, estimating 
only third-party payer's costs could be responsible for partial 
cost assessment, and consequential partial benefit estimation. 
NHS perspective disregards all patients’ related cost, 
excluding indirect and out-of-pocket costs. Productivity loss 
is a very controversial point in economic evaluation in 
healthcare. In health economics it was extensively discussed 
whether indirect costs (productivity loss) should be included 
in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), without reaching a 
final and wide consensus [11,12]. The explanation for that 
could be found in the necessity for the NHS to optimize 
resource consumption as it is driven by spending cap issues. 
However, patients (and potential informal caregivers) 
perspective could consequentially report extra information 
able to influence society itself. Other issues frequently 
disregarded in economic evaluation are direct non-medical 
costs (i.e., travelling and accommodation expenditures), 
which account for a considerable amount of resources 
consumed if considering high prevalence diseases. The 
societal perspective is able to embrace all these costs, 
merging NHS costs (medical and not medical direct cost) to 
patient ones (out-of-pocket medical and non-medical direct 
cost; indirect and intangible costs). The object of our brief 
review is to investigate to what extent economic evaluations 
in telemedicine published up to 2013 were able to capture 
potential benefits considering the social perspective issue.  
The article is composed by five sections. Introduction 
addresses state of art and the systematic review aim. 
Methods section describes the procedures used to select 
the included articles. Results section explores and 
highlights the main findings. Discussion reports issues 
and possible solution to assess properly telemedicine. 
Finally, conclusion accounts for authors considerations.

II. 
 METHODS 
In order to identify all published studies inherent to 
economic evaluation in telemedicine, a systematic review 
was conducted throughout the following databases: EBSCO 
host (Medline; Cinahl; EconLit; PsycInfo); Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE); ISI 
Databases (Science Citation Index; Social Science Citation 
Index; Arts and Humanities Citation Index); Embase; NHS 
Economic 
Evaluation 
Database; 
Health 
Technology 
Assessment Database and the Cochrane Databases. The 
studies included in the review are full economic evaluations 
according to Drummond [11]; therefore, the following terms 
were included in the search strategy: Cost-Minimization 
Analysis (CMA), Cost-Consequences Analysis (CCA), Cost-
Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), 
Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) of telemedicine and its 
explosion in mesh tree. Studies reporting only costs or only 
effectiveness were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were: 
email-only or telephone-only based studies and different 
languages than English. Results were limited to the period 
January 1st, 2013 to November, 2013, as previous reviews 
extensively reported and discussed data and methodological 
issues [8,10]. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Once identifying the article titles, duplicates were deleted 
using MS excel 2013 (Microsoft Corporation). 486 articles 
were obtained from search strategy terms research. After 
titles revision 451 articles were excluded because they were 
not economic evaluation. Abstracts revision has led to 
exclude 20 articles: 6 considered only cost, 4 were reviews, 3 
considered only effectiveness, 2 were study protocols and 5 
were excluded for other reasons (telephone based, different 
language than English, patients preference, validation study). 
After the abstract assessment, 15 articles were included for 
full-text evaluation (Figure 1). NHS and Social perspective 
were the most adopted respectively 10 and 4 studies. 
A. NHS perspective 
Among the included trials (Table I), the majority adopted 
the NHS perspective. The whole set of studies was assessing 
performance of telemonitoring devices in chronic diseases 
(Heart failure, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, 
Diabetes, Hypertension), reporting in most of the cases 
utility outcomes (e.g., Quality Adjusted Life Years - 
QALYs). Time horizon ranged from 6 months to 16 months. 
Out of 6 decision models (Table II), 4 of them were Markov         
model-based economic evaluation and 2 decision tree ones. 
Although most of them adopted a third-party payer point of 
view, QALY was chosen as effective outcome in 5 studies. 
The time horizon covered period ranging from 3 years up to 
lifetime. Beyond clinical trials and decision models, 2 out of 
5 studies with various designs (Table III) assessed TM from 
the NHS perspective. The interventions were compared with 
results belonging to the same patients, but observed before 
telemedicine procedure started. No Health Related Quality of 
Life (HRQOL) outcomes were considered; authors chose 
monetary benefits or clinical outcomes. 
B. Social perspective 
Most of the studies assessing costs alongside clinical 
trials adopted NHS perspective. Nevertheless, Zanaboni et al. 
[13] showed costs experienced by patients for travelling and 
private visits in both study arms; however, patients’ costs 
were excluded in CUA. No significant difference in cost for 
NHS was observed, on the other hand patients in TM arm 
experienced a lower expense of 100€ per patient/year 
(p<0.05). This difference was detectable in all the patients' 
related costs (Protocol-defined visits and Emergency 
Department visits) with exception of “Non-urgent in-office 
visits”, where usual care was less expensive (p>0.05). The 
authors concluded that remote monitoring led to cost saving 
for patients of about 24% of their cost per year. However, 
limiting analysis to patients for whom QALY was available, 
it was considered only NHS costs and was observed a cost 
reduction of €888.10 per patient over 16 months. Only one 
Markov model assessed CEA from both the NHS and social 
perspective [14]. Once household costs were considered, the 
TM intervention cost increased. However, Rachapelle et al. 
[14] stated that most of TM costs are related to additional 
hospital fees rather than to travelling costs or productivity 
loss. Among studies adopting different design than clinical 
trials or decision models, 2 of them developed the study from 
the society point of view. No HRQOL outcomes were used 
in these studies. Levin et al. [15] performed an uncontrolled 
retrospective study, assessing cost reduction adopting 
telemedicine in diabetes teleconsulting in Denmark. In this 
case, results compared haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in 
diabetic patients using TM to Dansk Voksen diabetes 
database (DVDD) patients’ levels [15]. Isetta et al. [16] 
results compared telemonitoring for low risk newborns with 
usual care in terms of Emergency Department (ED) accesses. 
Indirect costs concerning one of the newborn’s parents were

assumed to be €15 for missed hour of work, while €30 for 
travelling expenses to reach the hospital. Sensitivity analyses 
varied the following costs by ±75%: Emergency Department 
visit, hospital visit, nurses’ salary per hour, travelling to 
hospital and parents’ productivity loss. Even in these cases, 
the ICER was in favour of telemonitoring.  
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
 In the last years, many authors questioned the 
methodological approach to capture costs and effectiveness 
of telemedicine [5-10]. The most important problems 
identified were: study design, small samples, limited time 
horizon, heterogeneous cost-related variables and proxies for 
effectiveness, control group absence and cost analysis 
perspective. In the papers published in 2013, we registered a 
somewhat improvement with regards to most of these 
elements. In particular, most of the studies retrieved have a 
sufficiently broad sample and used well-defined cost items 
and outcomes variables. However, the perspective of 
analysis remains an unsolved issue. In Italy, it is not clear if 
telemedicine should be reimbursed or not [13].  
In this setting, a narrow perspective is not suitable to 
properly answer to this question. The societal point of view 
is by definition the broadest one, embracing NHS, patients 
and caregivers perspective. From the patients and the 
caregivers point of view, direct (medical and non-medical), 
indirect, and intangible costs (HRQOL) should be assessed 
[11]. In effect, telemedicine, theoretically, could sharply 
decrease all of these cost items. One of the focal points of 
telemedicine 
adoption 
is 
abridging 
distances 
and 
consequentially to reduce productivity loss, and delivering 
high quality healthcare outside the healthcare centre. This 
has of course an influence in patient’s expenditure in terms 
of travelling and/or accommodation. Zanaboni et al. reported 
reduction in out-of-pocket costs for in-office and clinic 
visits. Even if the authors did not report non-medical direct 
and indirect costs, it is consequential that a reduction in the 
number of visits was reflected in a reduction in travelling 
costs and productivity loss for the telemonitoring arm. 
Likewise, Isetta et al. [16] reported positive results in their 
cost-effectiveness study including non-medical direct and 
indirect costs (estimated by assumption). On the other hand, 
Rachapelle et al. assessed TM intervention adopting the NHS 
and societal perspective. From the latter point of view, the 
intervention was no more cost effective in the same 
timeframe where it was for NHS. In all the cases the 
introduction or exclusion of productivity loss and 
travelling/accommodation costs was able to influence the 
study results. 
 The other 10 studies reported only the third-party payer's 
perspective. However, in comparison to the previous 
reviews, 2013 brought an improvement in terms of 
methodological reliability in telemedicine studies. Although 
the number of well-designed studies has somewhat 
increased, further methodological reliable studies have to be 
developed 
in 
order 
to 
confirm 
telemedicine 
cost-
effectiveness. In addition, the adopted perspective and 
indirect cost assessment still represent a pivotal unsolved 
point. Introduction of indirect cost in CEA and CUA was 
extensively discussed; the main issues raised in the literature 
were equity, measurement, double counting in HRQOL 
benefits and opportunity cost [17]. Of course, to convert 
productivity loss in monetary terms, therefore, limiting it to 
employed patients, could influence the equity purpose in 
healthcare, giving priority to employed patients [18]. 
However, unpaid job could be involved in the analysis 
attempting to overcome this problem (e.g., considering the 
avert cost for the closest paid job) [17].  
Another important issue to be considered is the 
measurement of indirect costs, as there is little agreement 
about what methods among human capital or friction 
approach is the best in capturing indirect cost. The first one 
estimating the productivity gain as an averted earning, while 
the latter depend on the productivity reduction of each 
patient during the condition and the amount of time (friction 
period) required to completely restore patient’s productivity. 
Double counting point concerns about whether the observed 
monetarized outcome (productivity loss) has been fully 
incorporated in the non-monetarized effectiveness unit. 
Therefore, double counting could be avoidable considering 
clinical outcomes instead of HRQOL ones, as in this case 
outcomes would not express patient’s preferences. However, 
it would lead to lose all the comparability and generalization 
advantages in using HRQOL outcomes like QALYs. 
Regarding to this topic Olsen et al. [19] stated that whether 
the preference based outcome did not report dimension 
clearly describing income changes related to health gain, it is 
not possible to know if the patient provided or not these data 
in his/her utility. In our review the productivity loss was 
included in 3 studies [14-16], two of them assess indirect 
cost by assumption, while Rachapelle and colleagues 
reported productivity loss only for those who had a paid job. 
On the other hand, Isetta et al. [16] included an estimation of 
indirect cost for only one of the newborn parents.  
A constrained number of studies adopted a broad 
perspective, and even a smaller number introduced 
productivity loss. In a public healthcare setting, opportunity 
costs should be carefully assessed. Although NHS 
expenditure reduction is straightforward to assess, assessing 
productivity gain is more complex. Let us consider a 
hypothetic innovative procedure to be no more expensive 
than usual care from the NHS perspective, but less expensive 
from the societal one, the additional resources obtained could 
be invested directly or indirectly in healthcare again. This 
would be reflected in extended budget for every single 
activity able to influence QALYs in favour to the least 
expensive procedure from social perspective [17]. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Although the controversial issue about including indirect 
costs in CUA, societal perspective should be adopted 
considering non-medical direct costs, while productivity loss 
could be assessed in terms of usual activities loss, but not 
included in CUA. This would report all the most remarkable

items of cost and highlight indirect gains (included in 
QALY, but perhaps hidden in it), resulting in the best 
informing data for policymakers. 
Further methodologically robust studies should be 
designed and conducted in order to drive both the adopters 
and the policy makers to more informed and reliable 
investment decisions.
