Abstract—In a wireless network, the signals transmitted
from one sender to different users have independent channel
ﬂuctuation characteristics. The diversity that exists between
users is called multiuser diversity and can be exploited by
the sender to enhance the capacity of wireless network.
In multiuser diversity OFDMA system, exploiting channel
ﬂuctuation diversity is in essence done by selecting the user
with the strong subcarrier channels. The individual subcarrier
selection for each user can achieve the best system performance
but high signaling overhead and high system complexity are
required. On the other hand, the adaptive subcarrier block
method achieves worse BER than that of individual subcarrier
selection. This is because the selected block contains the
poor channel subcarriers. To overcome this problem, in this
paper, we propose an adaptive subcarrier block selection with
frequency symbol spreading for an OFDMA system.

I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is
one of the most promising physical layer technologies for
high data rate wireless communications due to its robustness
to frequency selective fading, high spectral efﬁciency, and
low computational complexity [1]. Moreover, OFDM has
been chosen for several broadband WLAN and broadcast-
ing standards like IEEE802.11a, IEEE802.11g, European
HIPERLAN/2, terrestrial digital audio broadcasting (DAB)
and digital video broadcasting (DVB) [2]-[4].
OFDM allows only one user on the channel at any given
time. To accommodate multiple users, a strictly OFDM
system must employ time division multiple access (TDMA)
or frequency division multiple access (FDMA). Neither of
these techniques is time or frequency efﬁcient. Orthogo-
nal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) is a
multi-user OFDM that allows multiple access on the same
channel. It has been adopted for both uplink and downlink
air interfaces of WiMAX ﬁxed and mobile standards, i.e
IEEE802.16d and IEEE802.16e respectively [5]-[8]. It has
also been adopted by third generation partnership project
(3GPP) long-term evolution (LTE) downlink air interface
[9].
In a wireless network, the signals transmitted from one
sender to different users have independent channel ﬂuc-
tuation characteristics. The diversity that exists between
users is called multiuser diversity and can be exploited
by the sender to enhance the capacity of wireless network
[10]. In multiuser diversity OFDMA systems, exploiting
channel ﬂuctuation diversity is in essence done by selecting
the user with the strong subcarrier channels [11]. In this
case, one subcarrier is selected at once, users do not share
the same subcarriers. Therefore, multiuser diversity tech-
niques promise dramatically increased system throughput
and spectral efﬁciency. However, high signalling overhead
and high system complexity are required to select the strong
subcarrier for each user.
To reduce high signalling overhead and high system
complexity, the adaptive subcarrier block (ASB) method has
been proposed. Low signalling overhead and low system
complexity are merits of an ASB method. It means that an
amount of feedback information (FBI) can be reduced. How-
ever, an ASB method contains the deep faded subcarriers.
Therefore, many errors occur in the deep faded subcarrier. If
we can improve the system performance of an ASB method
with reduced FBI, the resource allocation is a promising
method. In this paper, we propose the resource allocation
of an ASB method with frequency symbol spreading for
multiuser diversity OFDMA for enhancement of the BER
performance. This paper is organized as follows. The system
model is described in Section II. In Section III, we describe
the proposed multiuser diversity for OFDMA with frequency
symbol spreading. In Section IV, we show the simulation
results. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section V.

A. Channel Model
We assume that a propagation channel consists of L dis-
crete paths with different time delays. The impulse response
¯hk(τ, t) for user k is represented as [12]

where ¯hk,l and τk,l are the complex channel gain and

erage operation, respectively. The channel transfer function

B. Resource Allocation for Multiuser Diversity OFDMA
Figure 1 shows the magnitude of channel transfer function
for different users in a single cell. From Figure 1, each
subcarrier fades differently from user to user. Therefore,
exploiting channel ﬂuctuation diversity is in essence done by
selecting the user with the strong subcarrier. The diversity
that exists between users is called multiuser diversity and can
be exploited by the transmitter to enhance the capacity of
wireless network. Moreover, the combination of multiuser
diversity and resource allocation makes great synergy to
increase the capacity of wireless network. In multiuser
diversity OFDMA systems, the resource allocation criteria
for each user is given by

the number of subcarriers, and K is the number of users,
respectively. This resource allocation method is called the
maximal sum capacity (MSC) as shown in Figure 2 [12].
From Eq. (3), the subcarrier is selected for maximization of
Z. In this case, one subcarrier is selected at once, users do
not share the same subcarriers. Therefore, multiuser diversity
techniques promise dramatically increased throughput and
spectral efﬁciency. However, no data rate proportionality
among users and high signalling overhead are serious mat-
ters [12]. To improve the data rate fairness, the maximal
weighted sum capacity (MWSC) method has been proposed.
The resource allocation criteria of the MWSC method is
given by
Zmwsc=

(4)
where ωk,n is the weight. However, the MWSC method
has no guarantee for meeting proportional user data rates,
high signalling overhead and high system complexity are
still remained [13]. In an OFDM, the channel response
at a particular subcarrier frequency is not supposed to be
totally different from its neighboring frequencies, and hence,
they must have correlation which depends on the coherence
bandwidth of the channel Bc. By using the concept of
coherence bandwidth, resource allocation method with the
adaptive subcarrier block (ASB) has been proposed for user
data rate fairness with reduced complexity as shown in
Figure 3 [14]. The resource allocation criteria of an ASB
method is given by

An ASB method achieves worse BER than that of a MWSC
method. This is because an ASB method contains the deep
faded subcarriers. Therefore, many errors occur in the deep
faded subcarrier. However, low signalling overhead and low
system complexity are merits of an ASB method. It means
that an amount of FBI can be reduced. Although, the perfor-
mance degradation of an ASB method is still considerable
problem. If we can improve the system performance of an

ASB method with reduced FBI, the resource allocation is
a promising method. In this paper, we propose the resource
allocation of an ASB method with frequency symbol spread-
ing for multiuser diversity OFDMA for enhancement of the
BER performance.
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM
A. Transmitter Structure
The transmitter block diagram of OFDMA with an ASM
method using frequency symbol spreading is shown in Fig-
ure 4(a). The binary data sequence for user k is modulated,
and Np pilot symbols are appended at the beginning of the
sequence. The symbol sequences consist of serial to parallel
(S/P) converted to NSF parallel sequences. The NSF paral-
lel sequences are assigned on the adequate frequency symbol
spreading block by using Eq.(5), as illustrated in Figures 4(a)
and 5(a), where NSF is the spreading code length. Each
parallel sequence(subcarrier bock) feds into the frequency
symbol spreading block is copied by the same length of
spreading code NSF , as shown in Figure 5(a). These copied
parallel sequences are spread by the spreading code with
NSF and combined. The transmitting signal waveform is
obtained by applying an inverse Fourier transform (IFFT).
The proposed transmitting signal for user k can be expressed
in its equivalent baseband representation as [12]
sk(t) =
Np+Nd−1

i=0
g(t − iT) ·
nr
2S
Nc
Nc−1
X
n=0
uk(n, i)

(6)
where Nd, Np are the number of data and pilot symbols, Ts
is the effective symbol length, S is the average transmitting
power, T is the OFDM symbol length, and uk(n, i) is
the nth subcarrier of the ith OFDM symbol for user k.
The power spectra of the input and output signals of the
frequency symbol spreading block are shown in Figure 5(b).
As indicated by Figure 4, the parallel converted data dk(n, i)
is fed into the ξkth frequency symbol spreading block. The
input data dk(n, i) is copied NSF times and multiplied as
shown in Figure 5. In the same frequency symbol spreading
block, the output spread signals are combined. Therefore,
all data are superimposed over the frequency domain. As
shown in Figure 5(b), the energy of each input data is divided
over NSF subcarriers by means of a spreading subcode, and
each subcarrier conveys NSF divided data. The frequency
separation between adjacent orthogonal subcarriers is 1/Ts
and can be expressed, by using the nth subcarrier of the ith
modulated symbol dk(n, i) with |dk(n, i)| = 1, as
uk(n, i) =

applying the FFT operation, the received signal r(t) is
resolved into Nc subcarriers. First, the received signal is
frequency equalized to reduce the frequency distortion due

in the equivalent baseband representation can be expressed
as

of the ith received signal ˜r(n, i) is given by

Observing Eq. (12), we can see that the received signals have
frequency distortion arising from the frequency-selective
fading. To reduce this frequency distortion, frequency equal-
ization combining is necessary. Here, we explain a channel
estimation scheme using Np pilot symbols. The channel

where {p(n, i), 0 ≤ i ≤ Np − 1} and P are the transmitted
pilot symbol and the power, respectively. In frequency-
selective fading, the orthogonality among spreading codes
may be destroyed. To compensate for the possible broken
orthogonality among the spreading codes, frequency equal-
ization schemes such as orthogonal restoration combining
(ORC) and minimum mean square error combining (MM-
SEC) are used for detection.

proportional to the channel transfer function H(n/Ts), in
order to perfectly restore the orthogonality. The ORC weight

where dintr is the interference term. From Eq. (17), we
can observe that the ﬁrst term is the desired signal, the
second term is the interference, and the third term is a
noise term. From the third term, ORC scheme can restore
the orthogonality, but it enhances the noise term for a deep

Eq. (20) is made by Eqs. (12) and (18). In OFDMA with
an ASB method using frequency symbol spreading, each S/P
transformed signal is spread by an orthogonal spreading code
with length NSF over NSF subcarriers and combined. This
means that each subcarrier holds several superimposed S/P
transformed signals with the same power rate. In this case,
frequency-selective faded subcarriers are obtained with the
same power rate for each S/P-transformed signal. Therefore,
the detected signals also have the same SINR. As a result,
each subcarrier shows the same BER performance under the
frequency selective fading. From this reason, the proposed
method can improve the system performance with main-
taining low signalling overhead and low system complexity.
Moreover, each operation is carried out symbol by symbol.
Therefore, the latency is necessary only one symbol time.
Since the current systems such as LTE and WiMAX, use the
subcarrier block method for each user, it is easy to embed
the proposed method on the current systems.

radio channel after cyclic extensions have been inserted. The
transmitted signals are subject to broadband channel prop-
agation. In this model, L = 15 path Rayleigh fadings have
exponential shapes with path separation Tpath = 140nsec
and the RMS delay spread is τrms = 0.65µs. This situation
causes severe frequency selective fading. The maximum
Doppler frequency is assumed to be 10Hz. The packets
consist of 64 subcarriers and 22 OFDM symbols (number
of pilot signals: Np = 2, number of data signals: Nd = 20).
Table 1 shows the simulation parameters.
Figure 7 shows the BER of non adaptive selection, the
ASB method and the MSC method for multiuser diversity
OFDMA system with 4 users and NSF =16 for Doppler
frequency of 10Hz. From the simulation results, the MSC
method achieves the best BER performance compared with
non adaptive selection and the ASB method. This is because
the MSC method can select subcarriers with highest SNR
for each user. On the other hand, the ASB method shows
worse BER than that of the MSC method. This is because
the selected block includes the poor subcarriers.

This is because the ORC based non adaptive selection with
frequency symbol spreading enhances the noise although no
error ﬂoor is seen. The MMSEC provides the best BER
performance, since the MMSEC minimize the power loss
while suppressing the noise enhancement.

MMSEC with 4 users and NSF =16 for Doppler frequency
of 10Hz. From the simulation results, the proposed ASB
method with frequency symbol spreading and MMSEC
provides the best BER performance in high Eb/No, since
the ASB method obtains the highest SNR subcarrier block
and the frequency symbol spreading and MMSEC minimize
the noise enhancement.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed the ASB method with
frequency symbol spreading for OFDMA system. From the
simulation results, the proposed ASB method with frequency
symbol spreading and MMSEC achieves 1dB gain compared
with the conventional MSC method at BER of 10−4. More-
over, the proposed method can reduce the quantities of FBI
compared with the MSC method.
