Abstract—Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) contain con-
siderable amounts of cash and process sensitive customer data 
to perform cash transactions and banking operations. In the 
past, criminals mainly focused on physical attacks to gain ac-
cess to cash inside an ATM’s safe. They captured customer 
data on the magnetic strip of an ATM card with skimming 
devices during insertion of the card. These days, criminals 
increasingly use logical attacks to manipulate an ATM’s soft-
ware in order to withdraw cash or to capture customer data. 
To understand the risks that arise from such logical attacks, 
we have conducted a risk assessment of an ATM platform that 
is running in a real banking environment. The result of this 
assessment has revealed the main issues that are responsible 
for vulnerabilities of an ATM platform. In this paper, we dis-
cuss the findings of our risk assessment as well as counter-
measures to mitigate serious risks in order to ensure a secure 
banking environment. The risk assessment has revealed effec-
tive countermeasures and has additionally provided a prioriti-
zation of activities for ATM manufacturers.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) have their roots 
back in the late 1930s, but they began to revolutionize the 
banking environment in the 1960 [1]. With the integration of 
real-time terminals, ATMs have been developed to data pro-
cessing units that contained commercially available comput-
ers. Today, almost all three million ATMs around the world 
are running on operating system (OS) Windows [2]. On top 
of Windows, the ATM platform controls all peripheral de-
vices and uses the OS to communicate with device drivers. 
The ATM platform also provides an interface to multi-
vendor ATM software, i.e., bank applications that utilize the 
platform’s functionality. Besides Windows, ATMs use the 
Internet Protocol (IP) for communication in the banking 
network [3]. Consequently, the ATM network is part of the 
banking network, which in turn is part of the Internet. ATMs 
have developed from stand-alone equipment with simple 
cash dispensing capabilities to a network of connected devic-
es for bank transactions. ATMs contain a remarkable amount 
of cash for their daily operation. Thus, they have always 
been an attractive target for thieves and fraudsters [4]. Also, 
they were available around the clock and often located off-
premises [5]. Fraudulent activities are not only attracted by 
cash, but also by data that is required to conduct full bank 
transactions. Risk assessments provide information to select 
adequate countermeasures and controls for mitigating the 
likelihood or impact of risks. We have conducted such a risk 
assessment concentrating on logical risks of an existing 
ATM platform. The proposed method can easily be extended 
to physical risks and risks resulting from card and currency 
fraud. 
In this paper, we will first provide an overview of attacks 
to ATMs as well as their countermeasures. We will then 
evaluate the countermeasures for logical attacks by a risk 
assessment. As a result, we can confirm that suggested coun-
termeasures work for the identified risks. Additionally, we 
can prioritize these countermeasures and provide a guideline 
for those responsible for ATM security. The paper is struc-
tured as follows. In Section II, we describe criminal activities 
in the context of ATMs and discuss traditional attacks and 
countermeasures. Section III concentrates on logical ATM 
security. Section IV presents a risk assessment approach, 
which is then used in Section V to determine the risks of an 
ATM platform. Findings are discussed in Section VI. Relat-
ed work and a conclusion follow in Sections VII and VIII, 
respectively. 
II. 
AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES 
An ATM is a cash dispensing machine with the capabil-
ity to credit or debit a customer account without human in-
tervention [1]. The term ATM has been used synonymously 
for cash machines, cash dispensers or cash recyclers. How-
ever, the designation ATM is inappropriate when a machine 
cannot perform a complete financial transaction initiated by 
the customer. Thus, ATMs support synchronous or asyn-
chronous electronic data processing operations in an online 
and real-time manner [1]. ATMs have revolutionized the 
banking sector. Their widespread dissemination has grown to 
a world-wide use of around 2.8 million ATMs. This number 
is expected to reach 3.7 million by 2018 [6]. ATMs have 
always been an attractive target for thieves [4]. Reinforced 
by the fact that ATMs are typically available 24/7 and often 
located off-premises, they are vulnerable to cash thefts [5]. 
However, ATM crime, including ATM fraud, goes beyond 
stealing cash. Illegally obtaining customer's personal infor-
mation, such as bank account data, card number and PIN is 
an additional security issue that is related to ATMs [5][7]. 
These digital assets do not provide an immediate profit, but 
they can be sold on illegal credit card data markets on the 
Internet [8].

There are three different types of attacks, i.e., card and 
currency fraud, physical attacks and logical attacks [9][10]. 
Various Information Technology (IT) security standards 
have been developed and vendors have recommended securi-
ty concepts pertaining to ATMs [11]. The goal is to secure an 
entire ATM and its environment. Similar to ATM crime, 
ATM security can be divided into the three different core 
areas card and currency protection, physical security, and 
logical security. The former two will be described in the next 
subsections. Logical ATM security will follow in Section III. 
A. Card and Currency Fraud 
Card and currency frauds include direct attacks to steal 
cash or cards as well as indirect attacks to steal sensitive 
cardholder data that is later used to create fake cards for 
fraudulent withdrawals [10]. The target of these attacks is a 
single ATM, which may be physically manipulated for 
skimming, card fishing and currency trapping. Skimming is 
the approach to install an additional device, called a card 
skimmer, to capture the card’s information on the magnetic 
strip. Lower tech card fishing and currency trapping focus on 
either card or cash capturing, typically using thin plates, thin 
metallic stripes, transparent plastic film, wires and hooks [5]. 
There are several security methods that deal with this threat 
category. Jitters, for example, vary speed and movement of 
cards or introduce motion. In other words, it distorts the 
magnetic stripe details and makes it difficult for the skimmer 
to read data while the card reader pulls the card into the 
ATM [12]. A further approach of an anti-skimming module 
is a jammer with the aim to disrupt a skimmer attached to the 
ATM dashboard. Instead of working on a mechanical level, a 
jammer uses an electromagnetic field to protect the cards’ 
magnetic strips. Hence, the card reader can generate an error 
code that can be traced by remote monitoring tools [5]. 
B. Physical Attacks 
Attacks that result in the physical damage of the entire 
ATM or a component thereof  primarily focus on stealing 
cash from the safe [10]. But, some of these attacks are also 
conducted to prepare a further malicious activity on a single 
ATM. Vulnerable and easy targets for such attacks are off-
site ATMs that are open to the public, less protected and 
lighter compared to bank-located machines [13]. Physical 
security guidelines recommend seismic detectors, magnetic 
contacts, alarm control panels, access control and heat sen-
sors as alarm equipment [14]. Seismic detectors indicate 
abnormal vibrations and can cry havoc if an ATM is about to 
be raided. Heat sensors detect any form of unnatural temper-
ature rise. Volumetric detectors on the wall can detect 
movements in the ATM's surrounding area. Intelligent bank 
note neutralization or degradation systems use bank note 
staining. A trigger becomes activated in case an inapprop-
riate movement of the cassettes takes place. As a result, sto-
len banknotes get marked with a degradation agent or a dye. 
III. 
LOGICAL ATM SECURITY 
Logical attacks have become more sophisticated and their 
execution has typically been well organized [5][7][8][15]. 
Thus, recent examples, such as Skimer [16], Ploutus [17], 
Stuxnet [18] and a logical attack demonstrated at the chaos 
computing club congress [19] are indicators that these at-
tacks bring up new methods and approaches to ATM crime. 
ATM malware is designed to steal cardholder data and PINs 
or to withdraw cash [9][13][15]. Typically, malware hides in 
the system to remain undetected as long as possible. It im-
pairs confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of transaction 
data for its particular intention [5][10]. ATM networks are 
based on the Internet protocol and face the same attacks as 
other IP-related networks, e.g., denial of service (DoS), sniff-
ing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or eavesdropping [3][10]. 
Communication between ATM and host can be used as entry 
point to launch remote attacks [5]. Even network devices like 
routers and switches can be targeted [3]. Logical security 
focuses on maintaining a secure network, protecting the OS 
and designing a system so that intruders cannot threaten 
cardholder's data and software components [5][10]. Subse-
quent subsections describe such measures. 
A. Cardholder Data Protection 
Sensitive data is the main target of logical attacks [20]. 
The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard 
(DSS) is for the protection of sensitive cardholder and au-
thentication data. It proposes a set of twelve requirements 
divided into six areas [20]. Based on these requirements we 
have identified four security controls, which are needed to 
protect cardholder data:  
 
Change control, to guarantee that necessary and 
wanted changes are made only 
 
Data masking, to disguise cardholder data 
 
User access control, to restrict permsissions 
 
Password policy, to hamper password guessing 
B. Host-based Firewall 
To operate a secure ATM network, logical ATM security 
systems must be in place [5]. A firewall and a monitoring 
system to analyze and authenticate connection attempts are 
recommended in order to build such a layer of defense [5]. 
Instead of installing a central firewall, an integrated firewall 
on the ATM is feasible, controlling network communications 
on the processes, protocols and ports level [8]. 
C. Application Control 
Traditional security software like antivirus software is 
used on desktop PCs to prevent unauthorized software exe-
cution. But, antivirus software requires processing power 
that often goes beyond the capabilities of an ATM and relies 
on a signature database that needs periodic updates. These 
updates can only provide protection against known malware. 
Consequently, malware prevention must operate within the 
limited resources and with a minimal “footprint” to avoid 
complications with ATM software [8]. Whitelisting restricts 
software running on an ATM to a known set of applications 
[8] that are tested and approved for execution. Unapproved 
software outside the list and malware are prohibited. 
D. Full Hard Disk Encryption 
Some logical attacks bypass security protection by boot-
ing the ATM from an alternative medium, such as a USB 
356

stick or CD-ROM. This circumvention provides the possibil-
ity to manipulate configurations or to put malware in place 
[21]. As a countermeasure, the ATM hard disk can be pro-
tected with full hard disk encryption [21]. In addition, it is 
recommended to encrypt data on an ATM's hard disk to 
make it unreadable in case of theft or unauthorized access 
[10]. Physically protecting the hard disk is an additional 
safeguard, because data access becomes more difficult.  
E. Patch Management 
Logical security includes the handling of software vul-
nerabilities by patch management to ensure the efficiency 
and security of ATMs in a timely and efficient manner [22]. 
Continuous patch management provides protection against 
viruses, worms and known vulnerabilities within an OS [22]. 
An example in this context is the Slammer virus, which was 
responsible for network outages of different systems, such as 
ATMs with Windows [23]. The incident could have been 
prevented because Microsoft had provided a patch covering 
the exploited vulnerability six month before the virus spread 
out [23]. Needless to say, precautions have to be taken to 
avoid malicious misuse of update mechanisms. 
F. Device-specific Requirements 
Depending on the actual installation of ATMs, additional 
security controls are required for a higher level of defense. 
Examples of countermeasures include secure test utilities and 
device controls. Test utilities that are built in an ATM plat-
form must be protected via access control mechanisms. Ex-
ternally available devices, especially USB ports, must be 
controlled on BIOS or OS level. 
IV. 
RISK ASSESSMENT 
Risks must be controlled by countermeasures or 
safeguards [24]. Risk management is an important part of an 
organization’s security program. It provides support in man-
aging information security risks associated with an 
organization's overall mission [25]. Risk management must 
repeatedly be conducted in periodical time spans [26]. Each 
iteration begins with risk assessment [26], which is initiated 
at a predefined time, e.g., once a year or after a major IT 
change [27]. It results in the identification, estimation and 
prioritization of IT risks based on confidentiality, integrity 
and availability [24]. The result represents a temporary view 
that will be used for further risk management decisions [26]. 
A. Risk Model 
The risk model specifies key terms and assessable risk 
factors including their relationships [24]. It defines all factors 
that directly or indirectly determine the severity and level of 
a particular risk, such as assets, threat source, threat event,  
likelihood, impact and countermeasure. Assets represent 
resources of value that need to be protected [28]. Thus, a 
person, physical object, organizational process or imple-
mented technology can represent an asset. A threat is the 
potential for a malicious or non-malicious event that will 
damage or compromise an asset [28], e.g., unauthorized 
modification, disclosure or destruction of system compo-
nents and information [24]. Depending on the degree of de-
tail and complexity, it is possible to specify a threat as a sin-
gle event, action or circumstance; or as a set of these entities 
[24]. A vulnerability is a weakness in the defense mechanism 
that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm to an asset 
[26][28]. This weakness can be related to security controls 
that either are missing or have been put in place but are 
somehow inefficient [24]. 
The likelihood of a risk consists of two aspects, i.e., the 
likelihood of occurrence (initiation of an attack) and the like-
lihood of success [24]. The likelihood of occurrence demon-
strates the probability of a threat to exploit a vulnerability or 
a set of vulnerabilities [24]. Factors that determine this like-
lihood value are predisposing conditions, the presence and 
effectiveness of deployed countermeasures and the consider-
ation of how certain the threat event is to occur. The likeli-
hood of success expresses the chance that an initiated threat 
event will cause an adverse impact without considering the 
magnitude of the harm [24]. The impact describes the magni-
tude of expected harm on an organization [28]. To determine 
the impact, it is important to understand the value of the asset 
and the value of an undamaged system. Besides, it is advisa-
ble to consider an impact not only as a one-time loss because 
it can have relationships to other factors that cause conse-
quential damage [24]. A risk is a combination of the likeli-
hood that an identified threat will occur and the impact the 
threat will have on the assets under review [24]. Risk factors, 
such as threat, vulnerability, likelihood and impact determine 
the overall risk. Impact and likelihood are used to define the 
risk level [27]. 
B. Risk Assessment Process 
Different risk assessment processes, frameworks and 
methodologies build on the same underlying process 
structure, which may vary in abstraction level and granu-
larity [24][26]. These steps, which are listeted below, do not 
have to be strictly adhered to in sequential order. For 
example, it is useful to perform threat and vulnerability 
identification side by side to cover all risk possibilities. Also, 
some step iterations are necessary to get representative 
results [24]. 
1. Definition of Assets - No action can be taken unless it is 
clarified what the assets are. Asset definition seeks to 
identify the processes, applications and systems that are 
highly important and critical to an organization's daily 
operation [28]. 
2. Identification of Threat Sources and Events - Threat 
sources can be characterized based on their capability, in-
tent and target to perform a malicious activity [24]. Once 
the list of sources is complete, threat events must be iden-
tified that can be initiated by a threat source. Predefined 
checklists are an easy way to verify whether the listed 
threat events can occur in the context of the assessment. 
But, an exclusive use of checklists can negatively influ-
ence the outcome because it may impair the free flow of 
creative thinking and discussing. An important step is the 
determination of the relevance of each threat event. If 
considered relevant, an event will be paired with all pos-
sible threat sources that can initiate it.

3. Identification of Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Condi-
tions - Next, we have to identify vulnerabilities that can 
be exploited as well as the conditions that may increase 
or mitigate susceptibility. Tool support is feasible for this 
task. For example, vulnerability scanners automatically 
test internal and external system interfaces in order to 
find known and obvious weaknesses. 
4. Determination of Overall Likelihood - The overall likeli-
hood represents the probability that the threat exploits 
vulnerabilities against an asset [28]. To get an adequate 
value and to keep focused on specific aspects, the overall 
value is divided into likelihood of initiation/occurrence 
and likelihood of success. These are an assessment of the 
probability that a non-adversarial threat happens or an 
adversarial threat source launches an attack [24]. In con-
trast, the likelihood of success is the probability that an 
initiated threat event results in an adverse impact [24].  
5. Determine Magnitude of Impact - It is necessary to de-
termine the impact the event will have on the organiza-
tion [28]. For this task, the values of reviewed assets are 
an important input because they show the potential harm 
and the severity of the impact in case of a full or partial 
loss. The harm can be expressed in terms of monetary, 
technical, operational or human impact criteria [27]. 
6. Determine Risk - The risk level is determined by comb-
ing impact and overall likelihood [24][27]. It shows the 
degree to which an organization is threatened [24]. 
Formulas, matrices or methods that are used for merging 
likelihood and impact must be consistent and precisely 
defined. 
V. 
CASE STUDY 
The aim of this case study is a risk assessment to 
establish a baseline assessment of risks that are faced by an 
ATM platform of a specific manufacturer. Thus, the risk 
assessment identifies all threats, vulnerabilities and impacts 
that cause a risk to an ATM asset. The focus on the ATM 
platform limits our investigation to software aspects. Thus, 
we mainly focus on logical risks. We’d like to mention at 
this point that we have to refrain from describing attacks in 
too much detail, because this would provide valuable 
information to potential attackers. However, the given 
information is sufficient for readers to follow the conclusions 
that we will draw. 
A. System Characterization  
The logical system structure of an ATM consists of three 
layers as shown in Figure 1. On the bottom end is the OS, 
which is on top of the hardware layer (not considered here) 
and builds the base for all layers above. The second layer is 
the ATM platform that uses the functionalities of the OS in 
order to communicate with hardware components. The ATM 
platform provides a public interface to multi-vendor ATM 
software and bank applications that depict the third layer. 
The ATM platform is designed to run on various releases of 
Microsoft Windows. Some of these releases are optimized 
for point of sale solutions, i.e., Embedded POSReady. The 
ATM platform implements the eXtension for Financial Ser-
vices (XFS) interface specification defined in [29]. XFS does 
not differ between a multi-vendor ATM software and a bank 
application, but considers both forms of an ATM software as 
a Windows-based XFS application [29]. The key element of 
XFS is the definition of an Application Programming Inter-
face (API) and a corresponding Service Provider Interface 
(SPI). The API provides access to financial services for 
Windows-based XFS applications. The SPI is similar to the 
API, but is utilized for the direct communication with ven-
dor-specific service providers. Each of the service providers 
represents a peripheral device of the ATM. The XFS manag-
er handles the overall management of the XFS subsystem. 
Thus, this component is responsible for establishing and 
mapping the communication between API and SPI.  
 
Figure 1. Logical System Structures of an ATM 
B. Logical Risk Assessment 
The risk assessment conducted in this case study is based 
on the risk assessment published in [24]. The focus of the 
assessment is on the ATM platform, i.e., from the ATM 
manufacturer’s perspective. The operating system and any 
bank applications or other ATM software have not been 
considered in the evaluation (the bank’s perspective). 
1. Assets - The main assets are sensitive data, cash and the 
company's reputation. Cash can be more precisely de-
fined as real cash represented by bills and coins as well 
as book money transferred from one bank account to an-
other. The general term of sensitive data summarizes data 
and information that refers to an individual or is required 
to secure the system. For instance, card data, personal 
identification number (PIN), account data or secret keys 
belong to this category. 
2. Threat Sources and Events - We have derived threat 
sources by interviewing ATM platform engineers and 
customer solutions employees. The resulting sources are: 
attacker (or hacker), thief, cash in transit (CIT) employee, 
IT specialist (in data center), bank clerk, helpdesk em-
ployee, service technician and employee of ATM manu-
facturer. Threat events were identified in form of brain-
storming sessions. Threats were grouped to categories, 
which were derived from the primary objective of the 
threat events or an important key passage in an entire sce-
nario:  
 Denial of Service, making the ATM platform una-
vailable to a customer by dominating some of its 
resources.   
358

ICSEA 2015 : The Tenth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

 Malicious Software Injection, injecting malicious 
software, such as Trojan horses, viruses or worms 
at the OS level or the ATM platform level.  
 Sensitive Data Disclosure, gathering unprotected 
cardholder data.  
 Configuration File Modification, changing configu-
ration files of the ATM platform. 
 Privilege Settings Modification, modifying configu-
ration files, focusing on the change of the user ac-
cess control model to gain more privileges.  
 Software Component Modification, modifying an 
executable or an assembly of the ATM platform, 
assuming the adversary can decompile the target 
file. 
 Test Utility Exploitation, exploiting test utilities 
used by service technicians, IT specialists and ATM 
platform engineers for maintenance.  
 Eventually, the events were connected to threat sources 
and logically ordered to create entire scenarios. As a re-
sult, a directed graph was designed for each threat group. 
Figure 2 shows a snippet of the graph regarding the dis-
closure of sensitive data. With this graphical visualization 
on the table, the relevance of all threat scenarios was as-
sessed and classified as either confirmed, likely, unlikely 
or not applicable. This is shown in Figure 2 by a label 
next to the threat source. 
3. Vulnerabilities - In order to disclose vulnerabilities in the 
ATM platform, we have analyzed the threat scenarios 
based on countermeasures recommended in Section III. 
For instance, as is shown in Figure 2 by the second of the 
two lock symbols, missing hard disk encryption may al-
low a thief or service technician to access and read data 
on an ATM’s hard disk. 
4. & 5. Likelihood and Magnitude of Impact - We have de-
rived the likelihood of occurrence from the characteris-
tics of particular threat sources. These characteristics had 
been determined in discussions with employees from the 
ATM manufacturer and included capabilities of threat 
sources as well as intent and targeting, see (24). The like-
lihood of success has been determined by the vulnerabili-
ties of the ATM platform. Results of threat scenarios, 
which were linked to the three assets of the ATM, were 
assessed as very high (10) or high (8), because they 
caused an immediate loss when they get stolen or dam-
aged. Harm to the ATM manufacturer is evaluated as 
high (8) and the impact of indirect harm is considered as 
moderate (5). The latter is weighted as moderate because 
a further threat scenario is necessary to actually cause an 
impact. 
6. Risk - Risk determination has the aim to aggregate all as-
sessed aspects of the risk factors to the risk level. We 
have used a likelihood impact combination matrix for 
that purpose, see [24]. Table I shows the distribution of 
threat sources for risks assigned to the seven threat 
groups. The numbers do not represent individual scenari-
os, but threat sources of such scenarios. For example, in 
Figure 2 we have one threat scenario with two different 
threat sources, i.e., thief and service technician. Table II 
changes the perspective and shows how countermeasures 
affect risks of different risk levels. The Roman numerals 
I to VI on the left correspond to sections III.A through 
III.F as well as to sections VI.A through VI.F. Thus, this 
table helps in identifying security controls that are useful 
to mitigate multiple risks at once. Similar to Table I, the 
numbers do not represent single threat scenarios but 
threat sources.  
VI. 
DISCUSSION 
The discussion about countermeasures in the literature 
reflects the result of the assessment in our case study. The 
case study additionally highlights security approaches and 
technologies, which were identified as most appropriate for 
dealing with logical ATM risks.  
A. Cardholder Data Protection 
We have identified change control and efficient user 
access control as most appropriate for protecting cardholder 
data and also for threat scenarios that focus on settings 
changes or software components of a running ATM plat-
form. The main purpose is to guarantee that neither unneces-
sary nor unwanted changes are made. A change control sys-
tem also supports the documentation of modifications, en-
sures that resources are used efficiently and services are not 
unnecessarily disrupted. With reference to ATMs, it can be 
additionally applied for ensuring PCI compliance because 
the change control system provides an overview of software 
that is deployed within the ATM environment. Although data 
masking is activated by default by the investigated ATM 
platform, there are threat sources capable to disable this

feature. Consequently, the approach of obfuscating data be-
comes inadequate if user access control is not in place. The 
most efficient way of implementing a user access control 
mechanism is by applying the user management that comes 
with the OS. Not a technical but an organizational counter-
measure is the implementation of a password policy, which 
enforces a periodical change of passwords that are either 
used for locking user accounts or for switching to the 
maintenance mode of the ATM platform. 
B. Host-based Firewall 
Malicious use of the network interface can be mitigated 
through a host-based firewall. Such a firewall has to work on 
the level of protocols, ports and processes, i.e., the configura-
tion of the firewall must specify protocols and ports that can 
be used by a particular process for outgoing connections. The 
same applies for incoming traffic. All ports and protocols 
that are not in use must be blocked by default.  
C. Application Control 
Protection against unauthorized software on ATMs has to 
focus on whitelisting, where the execution of applications 
and executables is limited to a predefined set. This set in-
cludes files that are required to run the OS and the ATM 
platform. All other executable files not in the whitelist can-
not be launched, even if not malicious. As a consequence, 
threat scenarios that install known or tailored malware on the 
ATM platform fail in the execution of the malicious soft-
ware. Whitelisting solutions offer a simple device control by 
removing the device’s driver from the whitelist.  
D. Full Hard Disk Encryption 
Hard disk encryption is a powerful countermeasure 
against alternatively booting the system for malicious activi-
ties. Several threat events require access to an ATM's com-
puter to boot the system from an alternative medium. Al-
though launching an alternative OS would work because the 
environment is running in the RAM, access to the encrypted 
hard disk fails. As a result, an adversary is not able to search 
for sensitive data, to drop malicious files, to collect executa-
bles and dynamic link libraries from the ATM platform or to 
change the privileges of restricted objects. Hard disk encryp-
tion tones down threat scenarios that concentrate on stealing 
or exchanging a hard disk as encrypted hard disks cannot be 
used on another system. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
chip, which is mounted on a computer's main board, can be 
used to establish this connection. Other approaches do not 
require additional hardware, but can compute the encryption 
key based on unique characteristics of installed hardware 
components or network location of the ATM.  
E. Patch Management 
A fundamental base for an effective patch management is 
appropriate hardening of a system. Compared to a firewall 
that works at the network side, system hardening focuses on 
the OS level and removes or disables all unnecessary appli-
cations, users, logins and services. For instance, non-
essential applications, which may offer useful features to a 
user at a workstation, must be removed because they could 
provide a backdoor to an ATM environment. Next to harden-
ing, a rule policy with defined user privileges must be in 
place. The reason is that managing a distributed system like 
an ATM network still provides a vector for the installation of 
malware by maintenance staff. Based on that groundwork, a 
continuous patch management allows a financial institute to 
provide protection against known viruses, worms and vul-
nerabilities within an OS.  
F. Device-specific Requirements 
For dealing with the potential danger arising from test 
tools used by ATM platform engineers, service technicians 
and IT specialists, it is important that these tools function 
only under certain circumstances. Especially, when the ATM

is in maintenance mode, the tools should support the activi-
ties on the ATM. But, in all other cases they must be disa-
bled. Device control comes into play when the USB ports of 
an ATM represent possible entry points for a malicious ac-
tivity. Similar to the concept of application control, device 
control can be implemented by whitelisting solutions too. 
Instead of blocking an application, a whitelisting solution 
can block the USB driver resulting in disabled USB ports.  
VII. RELATED WORK 
DeSomer demonstrates that card skimming provides the 
highest ATM risk [30]. In order to detect a card skimming 
device or the installation of a camera for PIN capturing, the 
author highlights risk mitigation measures, such as jitter de-
vices, lighting improvements or fraudulent device inhibitors. 
A survey about ATM security highlights that some of the 
security measures are obsolete and inadequate  [31]. Thus, 
fraudulent activities can be easily performed on an ATM. 
The work proposes improvements in the authentication pro-
cess by installing a finger vein technology or a facial recog-
nition system. Bradbury has conducted ATM security from a 
logical point of view [15]. He concludes that logical fraud 
activities on ATMs are increasing and executed as organized 
and highly sophisticated attacks. Adversaries are capable to 
manipulate the software inside of ATMs to directly withdraw 
money. The severity of this issue is underlined by the fact 
that both banks and customers are facing heavy losses. Ra-
siah discusses the topic of ATM risk assessment from the 
same perspective as we did [32]. The author adapts a non-
technical approach and investigates risk management and 
controls by defining general ATM security goals. The paper 
provides a general overview on ATM risk related topics. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
We have discussed various aspects of ATM security, i.e., 
card and currency fraud, physical attacks as well as logical 
attacks. Logical risks of a specific ATM have been assessed 
in a case study to evaluate and prioritize appropriate coun-
termeasures. The risk assessment has provided information 
about countermeasures in general and their importance in 
particular. This allows the ATM manufacturer to better plan 
resources for security and concentrate on the most important 
countermeasures first. Also, we have found out that coun-
termeasures suggested in the literature are effective for the 
identified risks. By multiplying risk levels and the number of 
threat sources of Table II, we have identified application 
control, full hard disk encryption, and user access control to 
be most effective, as they provide protection to most identi-
fied risks. A host-based firewall is also a must for ATM se-
curity, as it protects against very high risks.
