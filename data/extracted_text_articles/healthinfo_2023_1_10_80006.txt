Abstract—Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle
that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. Previous
studies have focused on the left ventricle, but in recent years the
relevance of the right ventricle has been the focus of current
research. The aim is to determine those clinical and cardiac
parameters that influence right ventricular involvement in is-
chaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The used database
is composed of 56,447 subjects collected from 2008 to 2020 by
ASCIRES Biomedical Group. The methodology is divided into
two blocks: in the clinical aspect, decision trees are used to gain
interpretability and in the technical aspect, Machine Learning
(ML) is used for a greater degree of prediction. The results show
the influence of the difference in aortic artery beat volume and
vascular pulmonary volume as key factors, reaching an Area
Under the Curve (AUC) of 92.3% using RapidMiner tool with
decision trees algorithm. The conclusions demonstrate the ability
to identify clinical variables of right ventricular involvement and
consequently reduce the number of diagnostic tests and associated
times in a situation of cardiomyopathy.
Index Terms—Machine Learning; right ventricular involve-
ment; Pulmonary Vascular Resistance; Cardiomyopathy.
I. INTRODUCTION
Among cardiovascular diseases, ischaemic heart disease
accounts for 16% of all deaths worldwide, rising from over 2
million deaths in 2000 to 8.9 million in 2019, and has become
the disease attributed with the largest increase in deaths since
2000 [1]. Other cardiac conditions, such as non-ischaemic
cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, and heart
failure are highly prevalent in developed countries and also
cause high morbidity and mortality [2]. Due to the complexity
and high prevalence of these diseases, a better understanding
of the pathophysiology, as well as earlier diagnosis is of
vital importance to increase the success rate of therapies,
which is reflected in a reduced level of disability and lower
mortality. To this end, for decades, all attention has been
directed to the study of the left ventricle, making the right
ventricle the ”forgotten side of the heart”. On the other hand,
a direct extrapolation of the knowledge acquired about the
physiology of the left side of the heart to the right side is
not possible, as the normal right ventricle is anatomically
and functionally different from the left ventricle. However,
in recent years, advances in non-invasive cardiac imaging
techniques have made it possible to discover the importance of
the right ventricle in different cardiac diseases [3]. Therefore,
there is a need for a better understanding of those factors that
influence right ventricular dysfunction, given the accumulating
evidence of their clinical relevance from both a symptomatic
or diagnostic and prognostic perspective.
Numerous researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of
applying Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in health studies
to predict strokes [4], ICU patients with Covid-19 [5], prostate
cancer [6] or acute coronary diseases syndrome [7] and others.
The joint use of this type of algorithms with visualisation
tools, such as Power BI is used in numerous areas [8] [9]

[10]. However, the diagnostic use of decision-making tools
is still rare in the health sector. In recent years, these types
of diagnostic aid tools have become popular. For example, a
success story is the application of this type of tools in the
private health sector in Finland, which has based its health
system’s decisions on data, identifying key factors [11].
Previous studies have identified influential variables in right
ventricular compromise, such as: pulmonary arterial hyperten-
sion (PAH) associated with pressure overload [12]; diabetes,
dyslipidemia [13], blood flow [14] and habits, such as smoking
[15] and others.
The main objective of this project is to determine those
clinical and cardiac parameters that influence the involve-
ment of the right ventricle in ischemic and non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy using ML techniques. To this end, predictive
models capable of identifying patients with right ventricular
dysfunction will be developed and the key parameters used
by the models will be studied from the point of view of their
clinical implication.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 presents the
details of dataset and it describes the methodology for Power
BI and RapidMinner. Section 3 describes the results focusing
on significant variables, distributions and decision trees .
Finally, Section 4 presents the conclusions and directions for
future work.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The methodology used makes a comparison of the most
common supervised classification algorithms in ML: Support
Vector Machines (SVM) [16], decision tree [17], Random
Forest [18] and neural networks [19]. To compare results, the
following metrics have been used: precision, sensitivity, speci-
ficity and Area Under the Curve (AUC). This last variable has
been used to evaluate the performance of binary classification
models.
The data used for the study comes from the ASCIRES
Biomedical Group database. This database has 56,447 records
of variables collected from 2008 to 2020.
A. Software used
The research uses two software tools: Power BI and Rapid-
Minner.
• Power BI is a data analytic service from Microsoft that
provides interactive graphs focused on analytic intelli-
gence to generate reports [20]. In the present research it
allows easy visualisation of the database to automate the
analysis.
• RapidMiner is a software for data analysis and data
mining by chaining operations in a graphical environment
[21]. Version 9.10.013 is used to obtain the results of the
ML models.
B. Data preparation
At this point, clinical filters and patient labels are made
according to age, gender, systole and diastole of the right
ventricle. The volume of data cleaning by means of the filters
means, that the initial database has 56,447 patients and 1,815
variables; after applying the filters, these are reduced to 12,083
patients and 120 variables. Of the latter subgroup, 7153 are
labelled as unaffected and the target group is 4944 with right
ventricular involvement.
The process applies logical cleaning, such as: (i) Removal of
inconsistent data, such as the presence of letters in numerical
values. (ii) Elimination of erroneous data, heights < 1 metre
and > 2.3 metre or ages < 0 and > 120 years. (iii) Checking
whether the numeric value zero represents such a value or
is a null value (NULL). (iv) For having the same content as
other variables, but with a different name, e.g., Vol.eyec.Ao
for vol.lat. (v) For having all data set to 0; (vi) Transformation
into international units of certain variables, such as wood
units. (vii) For containing inconsistent data from the clinical
perspective (outlayer).
An additional step is the elimination of variables with higher
correlations, in order to avoid multicollinearity in our database.
These steps are the following:
(i)
Frac.reg.Ao.por.vol.lat
to
Ao.reg.Vol.beat.vol.dif
with
ρ
=
0, 91
(ii)
Ao.reg.Vol.beat.vol.dif

with

(iii)

to NLVESV with ρ = 0, 94 (vi) Weight (kg) to S.Corp
with ρ = 0, 95 (vii) NRVSV to RVSV with ρ = 0, 95
(viii) NLVSV to LVSV with ρ = 0, 95 (ix) NRVEDV to
RVEDV with ρ = 0, 95 (x) RWT...relative.wall.thickness to
RWT.2...relative.wall.thickness.pwd.sd with ρ = 0, 90 (xi)
LVEDV to LVESV with ρ = 0, 93 (xii) NLVEDV to LVEDV
with ρ = 0, 95 (xiii) NLVEDv to LVESV with ρ = 0, 90 (xiv)
IVTSVD to RVESV with ρ = 0, 97 (xv) NLVESV to LVESV
with ρ = 0, 97
C. Data labels
Aligned with the main objective of the research, the
database is labelled to assess whether the patient has right
ventricular involvement. For the identification of these pa-
tients, the consensus tables specified by the European Society
of Cardiology [22] establishes ranges of variables (age, gender,
systoles, diastole and others) to identify RV involvement.
These values are adapted in Table I, The normal values of
RV systolic and diastolic parameters vary according to age and
gender. The standard of normal values used for the recognition
of impairment is used with a similar range in current papers,
such as that of the researchers Petersen et al. (2019) [23].
The absolute values of end-systolic volume (ESV), end-
diastolic volume (EDV) and body mass have been used, whose
values are provided automatically within the framework of
clinical tests. Clinics automatically provide based on clinical
evidence frameworks.
Systolic volume (SV) is calculated by the difference be-
tween EDV and ESV; Additionally, ejection fraction (EF) is
calculated as SV/VDE. Sex, body surface area (BSA), and
age are independent predictors of several RV parameters,
as suggested by previous well-established studies [24]. The

standardised values of EDV/BSA and ESV/BSA are obtained
from these variables.
The filtered database uses functions to apply binary labeling
of patients: Normal or Abnormal (RV involvement). As an
example, a 62-year-old male patient with an EDV of 211 EDV
(mL) is labeled as abnormal (RV impairment) because he is not
within the range of (105,205) set in the parameters of Table
I. If the same patient has an EDV of 204 EDV (mL), the
patient is considered to have no RV involvement (normal), if
the patient also meets the other variables in their corresponding
ranges.
The database input and output variables are described in
Table II. The X is the average; SD is the standard deviation;
Max is the maximum value and Min is the minimum
value. The database contains 12,083 patients, of which 76.6%
(n = 9260) are men and 23.4% (n = 2823) are women. The
mean age is 62.49 years with a standard deviation of 14.1. The
average body mass index (BMI) is 27.87 (SD = 4.69), the
formula is BMI = Weight(kg)/[Height(m)]2. According
to the BSA, the average is 18.04 (SD = 2.8).
The output result corresponds to the classification of RV
involvement with patients without RV involvement (normal) in
a percentage of 59.1% (n = 7139) and with RV involvement
(abnormal) in a percentage of 40.9% (n = 4944). Missing data
is 0 because these records are removed in the preprocessing
step so as not to distort the output of the ML algorithms in
later steps.
In the first tests, the variables in the table are eliminated due
to their direct relationship in the table calculations. These are
discarded, as detailed in Table III: right ventricular systolic
volume (RVSV), left ventricular systolic volume (LVSV),
right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), left ventric-

(LVESV). However, they are reintroduced in the prediction
tests, as there is no clear correlation with the output variable
and they are not detected as primary variables for predicting
RV involvement.
III. RESULTS
After data preparation with a single model, the samples
of the training set (n-train) and test sets (n-test) are 8458
and 3625, respectively. These patients are changed by cross-
validation in the tests.
The results of the algorithms are shown in the table IV,
which are Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (SE), Specificity (SP),
Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value
(NPV) and Area Under the Curve (AUC).

The algorithm with the highest AUC in RapidMiner is per-
formed with XGBoost (AUC = 0.87), although the difference
is small with the neural network algorithm (AUC = 0.85),
determining a predominance of neural networks as predictors
RV involvement. Although Random Forest algorithms have a
(AUC = 0.82), and the lowest of the results is from Support
Vector Machine (SVM) with a AUC =0.79. The results are
quite promising, as it means that we can predict almost with
an accuracy of 9 out of 10 patients performing the clinical
tests whether they have RV involvement.
However, direct comparisons of the algorithms should be
treated with caution. On the one hand, XGBoost provides the
best results of the study but the complexity of ML algorithms
makes them ”black boxes”. On the other hand, decision trees
obtain inferior results but allow for great interpretability of the
results gaining a value-added clinical perspective. The size of
the database and the optimisation of the algorithms used allow
low processing times of less than 3 minutes with a MacBook
Pro 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 2.6 GHz 6-core computer with 6
GB 2400 MHz DDR4 memory.

The Table V shows the main variables with the greatest
weight detect in the ML algorithms, whose selection is auto-
matic as key risk predictors. The descriptive analysis of the
variables are gender in male with 76.6% (n = 9260) and
female 23,4% (n = 2823), This is logical as it is a necessary
variable for patient labelling. Dyslipidemia is present in 51.6%
(n = 6231) of patients, hypertension has a 59.0%(n = 7133),
diabetes has a low presence with a prevalence rate of 0.7%
(n = 85), however, type II diabetes (low involvement) has a
high incidence with 67.3% (n = 8131). The rest of the patients
of each typology do not present the pathology. Smoking
patients are high with 72.8% (n = 8800). Stent implantation
is high with 82.2% (n = 9937) because the database is made
up of patients who go to the cardiologist and suffer from
some kind of affectation or signs of affectation of the heart.
The stress study as a medical test is performed in 48.5% of
patients (n = 5857), although the use of this aggressive test
is decreasing every year.
In reference to the numerical variables, the most relevant
is RVP [Wood] with X = 14, 99 (SD = 1, 27). El aortic
arch is X = 25, 71 (SD = 3, 68), height is X = 167, 86
(SD = 9, 13), Weight (kg) is X = 78, 63 (SD = 14, 96).
The Regurgitate Volume of the Aorta Artery (Reg.Vol.Ao.)
is available for X = 4, 31 (SD = 24, 27). The Diameter of
the Aorta with Pulmonary Artery (DoA.PA) is X = 0, 96
(SD = 0, 25). The Descending Thoracic Aorta (Desc.T.Ao)
es de X = 24, 43 (SD = 3, 85). Sinus pressure (Sinus.P) is
X = 34, 1 (SD = 4, 77). Posterior Wall in Diastole (PWD)
has an average of X = 8, 63 (SD = 2, 75). Finally, the ratio
of diastolic volumes (diastolic RV) are of X = 1, 59 (SD =
0, 71).

A. Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR)
Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) is the mean pressure
drop from the main pulmonary artery to the divided left atrium.
The units of measurement are Wood’s units, which arise from
the equivalence one Wood’s unit = 80·s·cm−5.
PVR is defined by the Swan-Ganz catheter from a central
vein [25], the formula is:
PV R = 80 ∗ (PAP − CEP) ∗ CO,

therefore depend on Pulmonary Arterial Pressure (PAP) in
mmHg units; the Capillary Locking Pressure (CEP) in mmHg
units; and Cardiac Output (CO) in l/min units. The normal
value for a subject is 1-2 [Wood], but this increases with age,
as determined by the correlation table and Vizza et al. (2022)
[26], increasing by 0.2 Wood in subjects over 50 years of age.
The database provided uses an estimation model [27]:
PV R[Wood] = 19.38−(4.62∗Ln(PAAV )−(0.08∗RV EF))
(2)
where PAAV are in centimeter per second and RVEF in
percentage.
B. Distributions
The raw database model not shown in the results of the
paper has an AUC value of 98%, the reason is that most of
the patients in the database do not have RV involvement. This
caused the algorithms to estimate a normal value by default
and thus be right in most cases (sensitivity almost 0). But after
data filtering, the database is balanced, preventing this negative
event in the analysis of the observations. Another noteworthy
aspect of the distributions is the elimination of data in the
filtering that are empty in any of the variables, which may
cause a bias by eliminating patients who intrinsically did not
complete the data due to some particularity. As the volume
is high, this is not an impediment to the analysis and the
algorithms yield better results.

The use of Power BI makes it possible to visualise these
and many other particularities quickly, avoiding bias or incon-
sistencies in the data. The Figure 1 shows the histogram of
the number of patients by age and gender, quickly showing
how an increase in age means a higher incidence, as well as
a predominantly male gender. The 60 to 80 year age range
accounts for almost half of the RV affectations. In reference
to height and weight, there is a clear correlation between the
increase in height and weight, which is why BMI is used as
a predictive variable in the labelling of the database.

Figure 2 shows the multivariate analysis of RVEDV ac-
cording to gender and number of patients, in the analysis it
can be seen that the female anatomy has a smaller volume
than the male anatomy. This situation is contemplated in
the labelling of RV involvement, so this differentiation from
previous studies is correct. Regarding the lower figure, it rep-
resents the dispersion in relation to NRVEDV with ICTSVD,
this analysis allows the detection of outliers to eliminate
patients with highly distorted values. These graphs allowed
to establish minima and maxima in the variables without
interfering negatively in the algorithms. The interactive graphs
allow for easy filtering of the outliers in order to reach a
consensus with the doctors on their discarding and clinical
criteria with a range limit for each variable. This process is
repeated for each of the variables used in the labelling of the
data.

data distributions concentrated in the ranges of 12 to 18
[Wood], establishing a valid variable quality to be considered
relevant in the research. This concentration allows us to discard
outlayer patients (higher than 6) to avoid confusion of the
algorithms in the predictions.
C. Decision trees
The decision tree has a couple of advantages, the first, as al-
ready mentioned, have and easily interpretability for clinicians
in decision making, the second is easy data manipulation, and
the third is speed of execution and design. The disadvantage
is an algorithm with low predictive power.
A pruning is performed on the best decision tree, however,
if it is too high we can produce an overfitting. The hyperpa-
rameters used are adjusted for avoiding overfitting. Overfitting
is not observed.
According to the algorithm, the patient can be classified
with an AUC (91.2%) for RV involvement, based on the
interpretation of the provided tree, Figure 4:
• RV involvement (Abnormal): If PVR.en.units.wood >
15.221 + Height > 1.40m + DoA.PA > 0.087 + Aor-
tic.arch > 14.
• No RV involvement (normal): If PVR.en.units.wood ¡
15.221 and Ao.reg.Vol.beat.vol.dif >-90.500.
With this philosophy, decision trees are generated to gen-
erate visualisations that follow the branches to generate those
visualisations on the medical side. On the technical side we use
more complex but less visual algorithms to fit higher quality
predictor data. Another important variable in the decision tree
is Aortic Regurgitation Volume by Beat-Volume Difference
(Ao.reg.Vol.beat.vol.dif).
The following tree would be a similar interpretation, if
we remove the variable PVR.in.wood.units, the variable rea-
son.of.diastolic.volumes stands out, but the accuracy is re-
duced to 66.6% in the decision tree and 78.03% in the Gradient
Boosted Trees.
If we include the variables gender and age, which were not
initially included because they are used to classify the DV
affectations, the results do not change. However, if we prune
the tree, the variables age and gender are included, but they
are not decisive, and a test with grouping by decades of age
is carried out to ensure that they win.
The left ventricular involvement variables have been in-
cluded; the algorithm does not identify them as a key element
for right ventricular involvement. Although it is true that there
is joint involvement and influence.
Previous studies with ML algorithms in cardiology achieve
predictions greater than 90%, as they focus on achieving the
best results, not on their interpretability [28]. It is interesting to
see that our study achieves close values with interpretability by
combining both tools (RapidMiner and Power BI). The results
obtained are in line with recent research, which states that
neural networks are the most predictive of cardiac parameters
[29] [30].
This investigation has some relevant points. The main one
is the creation of a tool to support clinical diagnosis that
cardiologists can use for the prescription of new tests and
a more detailed follow-up, similar to previous experiences
already carried out [4] [31]. A second point is the creation of
a visual interface, which allows dynamic monitoring, which
facilitates dynamic interpretation, generating reports of high
statistical value. It is worth exploring new algorithms to im-
prove the interpretation of those key factors in the involvement
of the right ventricle, thus improving the possible diagnosis.
Tests could be carried out with different databases to create an
algorithm that is robust enough to be able to limit any bias that
the database used may contain. On the other hand, the authors
aim to create a standardized protocol of measurements and
tests that is carried out in daily clinical practice. The benefits
of data analysis in cardiology using these types of techniques
are evident, allowing them to increase the quality of diagnosis,
prognosis and therapy.
IV. CONCLUSION
The ML algorithms and decision trees described, demon-
strate the ability to identify the variables of greatest weight
in right ventricular involvement with a reduced number of pa-
rameters. As a result, the number of diagnostic tests and their
associated times can be reduced, allowing faster intervention
in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Therefore,
the main objective of determining the clinical parameters that
influence the involvement of the right ventricle in ischaemic
and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy is fulfilled.
The results show the influence of pulmonary vascular
resistance and aortic artery beat volume difference as key
factors, reaching an AUC of 87,7% with XGBoost in deci-
sion trees. Other variables with height (BMI), DoA.PA and
Ao.reg.Vol.beat.vol.dif stand out as variables with a high
weight in the predictions.
