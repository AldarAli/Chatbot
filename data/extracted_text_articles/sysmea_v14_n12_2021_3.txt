Abstract— Connected sensors and devices, the Internet of
Things, already today produce more data than data connectiv-
ity and cloud services can handle. This gives rise to various
forms of distributed sensor data handling, from surveillance
cameras with built-in feature detection to alarm functionality
in temperature sensors. There is an increased interest in being
able to use this sensor data for distributed intelligence. The
term ”Edge Computing” is often used to denote this distributed
computing, performed close to the sensors providing the data.
Edge Computing enables services typically provided by cloud
services with less communication, lower latency, and indepen-
dence of the internet infrastructure. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive, unbiased overview of state-of-the-art research
on edge computing and analytics. From the taxonomy of the
90 identified articles, most articles address task scheduling and
operation partitioning while data management and engineering,
image and facial recognition, power optimization, and anomaly
detection are generally also covered. Simulation remains the most
used approach for validation, and research results based on
implementations of edge systems in real-life environments are
still sparse.
Index Terms— edge computing; systematic mapping study;

I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we discuss the new trends in terms of scientific
publications related to edge computing and analytics. We
present the protocol of the Systematic Mapping Study (SMS)
that we use to select the scientific publications. This article is
an extension of a previous SMS we conducted on the same
topic [1], which was published at the Cloud Computing 2020
conference. This paper contains all the new publications that
have resulted after proceeding with the SMS methodology in
continuation to the previous results from April 10th 2019, up
to August 25th 2021.
The number of Internet-connected devices, Internet of
Things (IoT), was in the year 2018 estimated to be 23 billion
and is estimated to grow to 75 billion by year 2025 [2]. The
amount of data transferred over the internet is measured in tens
of zettabytes per year [3]. Most of the data on the internet
is from people sharing and consuming videos, pictures, and
sound, but a substantial and growing part is today’s data from
sensors. There are estimates that in the future, 75 % [4] of
the data generated from sensors will be handled close to the
sensors. The concept of handling data close to the sensor is
often called Edge Computing.
Edge Computing as a term has been used since 2015 [5],
solving the issues with providing the emerging amount of
data to end-users by content distribution systems and content
caches [6]. Today, Edge Computing commonly symbols the
distributed computing performed on sensor data, refining the
value and usability of the data. This is also driven by the need
for distributed intelligence, where subsystems directly or inter-
mittently connected to the Internet should provide autonomous
and independent operations. Edge Computing is also driven
by the need for low latency [7] and reduced communication
costs [8]. Typical use cases for edge computing varies depend-
ing on the domain in where is implemented. For industrial
implementations, the objective for edge computing is often
reduced maintenance costs, optimized operation performance,
predictive maintenance, quality improvement, and safety [9].
Edge computing is a technology that can be applied to
numerous different areas and domains. It is possible to also
learn between domains, where edge computing architectures,
equipment, or infrastructures have been successfully deployed
and provided value to the operator. The goal of this paper is to
find the state-of-art of experimentation, research, and scientific
contributions when it comes to edge computing and related
technologies.
Our main contributions are as follows:
• We study in which application domains edge computing
is applied. Our results indicate that smart cities and homes
are the most common targets for edge computing.
• We identify that algorithms doing task scheduling and
operation partitioning are the most common algorithms
in edge computing.
• Most of the primary studies contribute to architectural
edge computing approaches.
• The most commonly used metric for evaluating edge
computing systems in the primary studies is the energy
efficiency of the proposals.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the protocol used for the SMS used to find and
evaluate papers in this study. Section III presents the results
of the study according to the research questions from Section
II-A. In Section IV we discuss the threats related to the validity
of the study. Section V summarizes our work.
II. THE SYSTEMATIC MAPPING STUDY
This section describes the protocol used for the Systematic
Mapping Study. The protocol is largely based on the one used
in [10], but it has been modified according to the topic of this
paper.
A SMS is ”a broad review of primary studies in a specific
topic area that aims to identify what evidence is available
on the topic.” [11]. The SMS follows a set of guidelines for
articles to include in the primary studies: search for articles,
remove duplicates, go through screening phases, perform a
study quality assessment checklist and procedure. After the
screening phase, researchers extract the most important data
from papers for performing the data synthesis.
Subsections II-D – II-G describe how the screening phases
and the data extraction and synthesis were performed. Since
this paper is a continuation on [1], here we only describe how
we worked in this extended version.
A. Research Questions
The research questions (RQ) are as follows:
RQ1: In which fields are edge computing applied?
RQ2: What methods or algorithms are used in edge comput-
ing?
RQ3: What proposals exist regarding edge frameworks?
RQ4: What kind of performances do proposed solutions have?
RQ5: What is the standardization level on edge computing?
RQ6: How are the proposals evaluated?
B. Search Strategy for Primary Studies
This section presents our search strategy. It is based on the
Systematic Literature Review guidelines from [11] [12].
1) Search Terms: Table I lists the search terms used when
searching for original papers for this study. The search terms
are derived from the research questions.

2) Search Strings: The search terms listed in Table I were
combined into two search strings for use in the digital libraries.
These are shown in Table II.
3) Databases: The search strings shown above was applied
in the following digital libraries:
• Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
Xplore
• Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital
library
• ScienceDirect
The first search string was mainly used for the three
databases. For the IEEE Xplore database, we used the second
search string when searching in abstracts. This was done to
reduce the number of papers found because the first search
string resulted in more than 32.000 papers in the abstract
search. The third search string was used for the Science Direct
database because the maximum number of search strings is
limited to 8, and asterisks can not be used. We decided to skip
the last search term from the original search string. From the
collected results from all databases, duplicates were removed.
C. Study Inclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria for primary studies were as follows:
• Written in English AND
• Published in a peer-reviewed journal, conference, or
workshop of computer science, computer engineering,
embedded systems, signal processing, or software engi-
neering AND
• Describing any of the following:
– Methods or approaches for edge computing or ana-
lytics OR
– Infrastructural or architectural approaches to edge
computing and analytics OR
– Performance evaluations of existing edge computing
and analytics approaches
If several papers presented the same approach, only the most
recent was included, unless the contributions of those papers
were different.
D. Title and Abstract Level Screening
In this phase, the inclusion criteria in Section II-C were
applied to publication titles and abstracts. One researcher first
screened all the titles from the databases. Consequently, two

29

2021, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
researchers independently screened the abstracts, excluding all
papers that were not relevant for this study. When a researcher
was uncertain about including or excluding a particular paper,
he discussed it with the other researchers to decision. The
results from this phase were used as starting point for the full
text screening.
E. Full Text Level Screening
In this phase, the remaining papers were analyzed based on
their full text. Four researchers applied the inclusion criteria
in Section II-C on the full text. Here, each of the four
researchers screened a quarter of the total number of articles.
The researchers also documented a reason for each excluded
study [13].
F. Study Quality Assessment Checklist and Procedure
The selected papers were assessed based on their quality.
Four researchers assessed the quality of the selected papers,
each one assessing a quarter of the total number of papers.
Any papers not meeting the minimum quality requirements
were excluded from the set of primary studies. The output
from this phase was the final set of papers listed in Table VI.
Table III presents the checklist for the study quality assess-
ment. For each question in the checklist, a three-level numeric
scale was used [13]. The levels were: yes (2 points), partial
(1 point), and no (0 points). Based on the checklist and the
numeric scale, each study could score a maximum of 34 and a
minimum of 0 points. We used the first quartile (34/4 = 8.5)
as the cutoff point for the inclusion of studies. Therefore, if a
study scored 8 points or less, it was excluded due to its lack of
quality with respect to this study. The researcher documented
the obtained score of each included/excluded study.

H. Synthesis of the Extracted Data
The extracted data from the papers was used for analysis in
order to obtain a high-level view of different aspects related
to edge analytics. The papers were categorized in different
ways, and collective results were extracted. The results from
this phase are presented and discussed in Section III.
III. RESULTS
In this section, we present the main findings of the research.
We did the first paper search on April 10th 2019, and the
results from that search are reported in [1]. On August 25th
2021, we performed the second paper search. The results
presented in this section summarise both of the searches
performed.
Several contexts of research contain search terms such as
”edge” and ”algorithm.” Out of the results gathered, some
findings did not relate to edge computing. They focused on
other examples, such as analysis of image edges or parsing
methods for graph edges.
Table V shows the number of papers at the end of each
phase of the study. As can be seen, the initial paper search
resulted in a large number of papers. From the initial number
of papers found using the search strings mentioned in Section

II-B2, we decided to discard papers from earlier than 2016.
The discarding of papers was done after the title and abstract
screening. To our understanding, the term ”edge computing”
was introduced at the end of 2015 [5]. In addition, we also
discarded papers related to mobile edge computing, as our
research relates to the industrial environment. On the other
hand, papers related to fog computing were not discarded,
because the technologies used in fog computing are closely
related to edge computing.

The initial paper search from the previous study and the
search performed in this study resulted in 3524 papers after
removing all duplicates. After the title and abstract screening,
only 236 papers were included for the next screening phase.
Less than half of these papers were included after the full text
screening, resulting in 123 papers for the quality assessment.
In the quality assessment phase, a few papers were excluded.
The number of primary studies included in this research is
90. Of the 90 primary studies, 51 have been published in
conference proceedings. The remaining 39 papers have been
published in journals.
The term ”edge computing” was firstly mentioned by the
ending of 2015, according to a publication of Garcia Lopez
et al. [5]. Figure 1 illustrates the publication years of the
primary studies. During 2018 many publications related to
edge computing appeared. During the following years, there
has been a noticeable decrease in the number of publications.

A. Application Domains of Edge Computing (RQ1)
Research question 1 strives to identify the domain in which
edge computing has been applied in the primary studies.
Figure 2 illustrates those domains. Smart cities and homes are
the dominating domain of application in the primary studies,
and professional vehicles, the health sector, and the industry
have also been the application domain in other primary studies.
We also included a category named ”Other.” This category
covers more domain-specific applications such as tracking
systems for drinking activity, micro-services, social media
applications, or data centers.
In the majority of the primary studies, however, the domain
of application was not specified. Consequently, those papers
provided more general contributions that possibly could be
applied in several different fields.
B. Edge Computing Method or Algorithm (RQ2)
Table VII shows the purpose of algorithms used in the
primary studies.
Approximately one-third of the primary studies relied on
algorithms used for task scheduling and operation partition-
ing, which is understandable since those characteristics are
essential when implementing edge systems. One of the second
most addressed uses for algorithms was addressing power
optimization. It is understandable since often edge computing
is applied to small devices with limited resources, most notably
computing power and battery. Therefore, power optimization

Fig. 2. Edge computing application domains from reviewed studies
is a necessary factor to consider in edge computing. Many
primary studies contributed with algorithms related to image
and video processing, data transmission, reduction, and min-
ing. A smaller number of primary studies contributed with
algorithms related to anomaly detection, audio measurements,
or time efficiency. When comparing Table VII with the results
we presented in our previous work [1], it is evident that there
has been a noticeable increase in publications that contribute
with algorithms.
C. Edge Computing Framework (RQ3)
Figure 3 shows the number of papers that contributed to
architectures or infrastructures. In some study identifiers, the
design was presented as a framework, while others proposed
a method. However, the proposals were widely varying, and
we were unable to classify the frameworks any further. This
research question was consequently challenging to answer.
Also, the distinction between architecture and infrastructure
may be vague, considering that the infrastructure describes
the set of components that make up a system whereas, the
architecture represents the design of those components and
their relationship. In our rough classification, we considered
architecture mostly device-internal and infrastructure on an
edge device network level.
Fig. 3. Articles organized by the type of edge framework proposed
D. Performance of the Proposals (RQ4)
The purpose of RQ4 was to evaluate the performances of the
edge systems presented in the primary studies. As can be seen
in Table VIII, 40 primary studies provided energy-efficient
solutions by reducing the energy requirements for performing
tasks. Real-time solutions exist in 23 of the primary studies.
With real-time, we mean that results were available with
minimal but approximately constant delay, and the papers
included in this category were such that it was evident that they
were real-time solutions. Some 33 primary studies focused
on the improvement computational efficiency of the system
by reducing the time required to complete specific tasks and
reducing the overall memory usage. In addition, nine primary
studies focused on network performance issues. Nine primary
studies could not fit into the above classes. These primary
studies were on task scheduling, road anomaly detection, and
superiority in lane switching scenarios.
E. Edge Analytic Standardization Level (RQ5)
In this research, we analyzed the level of standardization
used in edge computing and references to ongoing stan-
dardization initiatives for edge computing systems. In our
previous study, no publication relied on any edge computing-
related standard. The situation is still the same based on
our extended search. A few primary studies used standards
such as Controller Area Network (CAN), IEEE P1363, and
NGSI when implementing edge computing, but these are not
strictly edge-related. Corresponding references were made to
communication standards such as IEEE 802.11, Wi-Fi, and
video codecs MPEG and H.264/H.265 (HEVC) used in edge
system implementations. Considering that edge computing
standards were not used in the research, a reference to edge
level standardization existed that was at the time ongoing
within ETSI [104]. It was published in 2017 by ETSI Industry
Specification Group with the title: “Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) - Mobile Edge Platform Application Enablement.” An-
other potential reference that may support the implementation
of edge systems in the future was the preparatory work of
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41. This Subcommittee 41 is currently
preparing standards on the area of the Internet of things and
digital twins [105].

F. Proposal Evaluation Methods (RQ6)
The evaluation of the proposed approach is an essential
part of research and scientific papers. The performance and
effectiveness of the contribution can be assessed when eval-
uating the proposal concerning the requirements. The same
applies when compared to other approaches. In this study, we
analyzed the evaluation methods that were used in the primary
studies. Figure 4 illustrates that approaches evaluations were

achieved using analytical, simulation, or empirical studies.
In most of the primary studies, simulations were used for
evaluation. However, empirical studies were used in almost as
many cases. The earlier study shows that there is an increase in
the share of empirical evaluations about simulations. Different
evaluation methods combinations were used in several studies.
In 15 primary studies, empirical evaluation was supported by
simulation. In four primary studies, simulation was used along
with analytical evaluation. Among the primary studies that
were evaluated by empirical studies, case studies were the
dominant method chosen. Even though the case studies relied
on real-implementations for the evaluations, they used a lab
environment for experiments. It means that the conditions for
assessment were constructed and controlled by the researchers.
In lab test circumstances, there are typically some differences
when compared to the actual operating environment. Due to
this, some case-specific events that might take place in natural
environments may not be admitted in the evaluation phase.
IV. THREATS TO VALIDITY
A threat to the validity of this study is that we dismissed pa-
pers related to mobile edge computing since this study focused
on edge computing and analytics in non-mobile environments.
Consequently, the authors may not have added some relevant
papers to this study.
This study also only included papers published from 2016
onward. The reason was that the appearance of the term ”edge”
came towards the end of 2015. This way, there may be papers
published related to this paper’s topic that was published
earlier and subsequently missed.
Another threat to validity is that the screening phases
were performed partially by different persons. No researcher
followed the entire protocol from beginning to end, but instead,
the screening work was divided between the researchers due
to time constraints. The researchers may have had different
views regarding paper relevancy, potentially excluding relevant
papers.
The work-related data extraction was divided between the

researchers. The data extracted in our previous work [1] was
double-checked by other researchers, but due to time con-
straints, we were not able to double-check the data extracted
in this extended work. The authors may have missed some of
the data during the data extraction phase.
We point out, however, that in our previous work [1], we had
consensus discussions in every phase of the protocol. In this
extended work, whenever a researcher was uncertain whether
to include or exclude a paper, he discussed the matter with
the other researchers. Therefore, we believe that the risk of
researchers having made mistakes while following the protocol
is small.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented a systematic mapping study on
edge computing and analytics. The term ”edge computing”
is moderately new, but it is the same category as other
terms such as Internet of Things or fog computing. The term
shifts nowadays towards being included in a more widespread
section of ”distributed intelligence.”
We have found an increased number of papers that focused
on the application domain of smart homes and cities, pro-
fessional vehicles, industry, and health. However, among the
primary studies we selected, power supply and networking had
lower application domains, indicating a clear gap for those
fields.
Most of the primary studies we identified focused on task
scheduling and operation partitioning. Data management and
engineering, image and facial recognition, power optimization,
and anomaly detection are other targets for using algorithms
within the primary studies. Similar to the previous article, the
simulation remains widely used as a tool for validation. The
implementation of edge systems is still somewhat sporadic
with a few real-life experiments.
Many of the primary studies did not specify the application
domain. A similar situation is happening within the specifica-
tion of the edge framework. Those indicate a lack of strategy
for implementing the authors’ proposals.
