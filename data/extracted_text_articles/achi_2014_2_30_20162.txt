Abstract— The usage of multi-touch interfaces on a tabletop 
device, has been very explored for elder users in several 
domains. This interaction technique is an alternative to 
reducing the obstacles that older adults face in the use of 
computer systems, e.g., handling of peripherals. Many design 
guidelines are proposed in the literature for a wide range of 
products and systems for elders, e.g. websites, TV user 
interfaces. However, there is a lack of set of design guidelines 
and design recommendations of multi-touch interfaces that 
matches elder’s needs. This paper presents a set of design 
guidelines and design recommendations distilled and extracted 
from most relevant works on design of multi-touch interfaces 
for elders available in the literature. The results are a set of 
design guidelines, useful for designers, application developers, 
usability specialists and researchers.

 INTRODUCTION  
Globally, we can verify that the population is aging [1]. 
Mamolo and Scherbov [2] revealed that overall population 
is decreasing with a substantial increase of the elderly 
population. The number of people aged over 65 years in the 
world is predicted to be about 1 billion by 2030, a 
significant growth in comparison with 420 million verified 
in 2000 [3], registering the largest number ever. Zaphiris et 
al. [4] referred that in 2030, one habitant out of four will 
have above the age of 65.  
The growing number of elders makes evident the need of 
development of technologies for this user group [5][6] that 
accommodate their needs [4][7].  
This user group presents own characteristics that differ 
from other user groups [8], part of them are age-related 
changes, e.g., physical and cognitive changes [9]. 
Nevertheless, there are in the literature several studies 
researching on age-related changes and how they influence 
the design of user interfaces [1][5][6][10][11] and others 
that focused the relationship of older adults with 
technologies [26][29].  
The interaction through of traditional input devices, such 
as mouse and keyboard, is difficult for elders [7][12], and 
other interaction techniques have been explored to surpass 
these limitations [9], e.g., using multi-touch interfaces [7] 
[9][13] as a more natural user interface [14]. 
The design of a touch-based user interface should suit 
elder’s needs [11] to be easily used [5], becoming an    
elder-friendly user interface. 
A considerable amount of works has been published on 
design guidelines for older adults, e.g., for design of 
websites [4][15], design of mobile user interfaces [16][17], 
design of TV user interfaces [8][18]. These studies usually 
propose a list of guidelines for designing and evaluating the 
user interfaces. This is not verified in works with a list of 
design guidelines of multi-touch interfaces, which are scarce 
in the literature. 
Although the design guidelines of other types of user 
interfaces can be used partly in the design of a multi-touch 
interface, some characteristic aspects are not addressed, e.g., 
the identification of the most suitable gestures for this target 
audience.  
In that sense, this paper contains a set of design 
guidelines and design recommendations refined and 
extracted from most relevant works on design of          
multi-touch interfaces for elders existing in the literature.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
reviews the background of this work, including, age-related 
changes, multi-touch interfaces, as well as designing multi-
touch interfaces for elders. Section III describes the 
methodology used. Section IV provides a review of design 
guidelines of multi-touch interfaces for elders. Section V 
presents the final set of design guidelines. Finally, Section 
VI concludes and presents future research directions of this 
paper.

BACKGROUND 
In this section, we briefly outline the main concepts 
associated with this work, including, age-related changes, 
followed by an overview of suitable input devices and 
multi-touch interfaces for elders and concludes with 
considerations 
regarding 
the 
design 
of 
multi-touch 
interfaces for elders. 
A. Age - Related Changes 
The aging process is typically accompanied with 
physical changes (namely visual, auditory and motor 
changes) and cognitive changes (decline in memory and 
attention) [10][19][20][21].  
Visual problems are noticed around the age of 40 [6]. 
The visual capabilities of a person are affected with aging, 
being the most significant changes observed in the visual 
41

acuity [22], presbyopia [21], peripheral vision [21] and dark 
adaptation [21][22].  
Hearing loss is verified in approximately 50% of all men 
over the age of 65 and 30% of women [6]. The human ear 
can hear sounds from the range of frequencies from 20Hz to 
20000Hz. Aging causes a decrease in hearing [21], resulting 
in a loss of the capability to detect tones in all the 
frequencies. However, this loss is more recognized in the 
high-pitched sounds [23], where some elders do not 
recognize sounds with frequencies higher than 2500Hz [24]. 
With respect to motor changes, these are caused by a 
loss of muscle mass and flexibility [6]. The main changes 
are specifically, gait disturbances (i.e., immobility), balance 
difficulties (i.e., instability), and certain motor control 
problems (i.e., tremor) [25] and arthritis [12]. 
Memory is a multi-component system that combines 
aspects of storage and processing [26]. Normal aging, 
produces different degrees of decline in the several forms of 
memory [20], namely short-term memory (i.e., working 
memory) used for example in learning and interacting with 
new devices and long-term memory (i.e., permanent 
memory) used to store information over a long period of 
time. 
Finally, attention that consists in the ability to focus on 
the items needed to perform a certain task [20][22] is also 
affected by aging. Individuals over 60 years old, have a 
substantial difficulty in processing complex tasks [27], and 
have problems maintaining attention span for long periods 
of time [28]. 
The use of touchscreens through multi-touch interfaces 
can accommodate largely these age-related limitations [6]. 
We will briefly summarize the most appropriate input 
devices for elders. 
B. Suitable Input Devices for Elders 
 Human-computer interaction enables the use of a wide 
variety of input devices, such as keyboards, mice, 
touchpads, touchscreens [10]. These input devices can be 
divided in two categories, direct and indirect input devices 
[29]. A direct input device is characterized by direct user 
input on a display [10], e.g., touchscreen. An indirect input 
device needs coordinate spatial information, hand-eye 
coordination, and finger dexterity to operate the device and 
interacting with the user interface [30], e.g., touchpad. 
Touchscreen devices reduced cognitive and coordination 
demands [29], being referred by research community as 
appropriated and preferred for elder users [6]. However, 
these devices present some disadvantages, such as, users 
hands may obscure the screen, the risk of inadvertent 
activation, as well as difﬁculties in the precision tasks [31].  
Several interaction techniques are possible in the 
touchscreens devices [30], e.g., single-touch or multi-touch 
interaction [32]. 
In the single-touch interaction, only a point of contact is 
recognized, e.g., using a finger. This way of interaction 
allows performing basic operations, e.g., open and close 
programs or pushing buttons. On the other hand, most 
recent devices enable multi-touch interaction, detecting 
multiple simultaneous touch points [33], e.g., using the 
fingers of a single hand or the both hands for interacting 
with the user interface, through of certain gestures on 
surface. 
Comparisons of touchscreens with other input devices 
are often referred by the scientific community [29][34][35]. 
Wood et al. [29] analyzed the performance of older 
adults in simple drag-and-drop tasks, using four different 
input devices, namely, touchscreen, enlarged mouse (EZ 
Ball), mouse and touchpad. As performance measures was 
used accuracy and time to complete parts of a game. 
Additionally, it was held a set of measurements, to assess 
visual memory, visual perception, motor coordination, and 
motor dexterity of the users. The results showed that mouse 
was the device that demanded greater effort to accomplish 
the proposed tasks. 
Findlater 
et 
al. 
[34] 
studied 
the 
psychomotor 
performance between young adults and older adults using 
desktops and touchscreens. The evaluated tasks were 
pointing, dragging, crossing and steering in both devices 
and pinch-to-zoom in the touchscreens. The results showed 
that older adults have slower performance than younger 
adults, however, the use of touchscreen reduced the time in 
comparison with desktop and mouse in the tasks performed 
by older adults. 
Schneider et al. [35] presented a study to compare the 
performance of different input devices, namely, mouse, 
touchscreen, eye-gaze input, and a hybrid interface, 
composed by eye-gaze input with other input devices. The 
better results were achieved using touchscreen and worst 
results using mouse, in the group of the elder users. 
In addition to comparisons with other input devices, the 
touchscreens allow innumerous interaction techniques that 
are also focused in the literature, e.g., Motti et al. [30] 
presented 
a 
review 
on 
interaction 
methods 
using 
touchscreens by older adults. 
The multi-touch interaction capabilities of touchscreens 
enable the use of sophisticated multi-touch interfaces that 
will be addressed in next section. 
C. Multi-Touch Interfaces for Elders 
Natural User Interfaces (NUI) were formed to establish 
new natural ways of communication between users and 
computer systems [14]. The term NUI enables the 
manipulating of a user interface in natural and intuitive form 
for human being [9][36]. NUI can be developed using the 
natural capabilities of humans, such as, touch, gestures, 
speech, facial expressions, body language, eye-gazing, or 
combining 
several 
input 
modalities 
designated 
by 
multimodal interfaces. 
Multi-touch interfaces are a type of NUI, in which 
multiple simultaneous touch points on a user interface are 
recognized [33], allowing direct mapping of the input in the 
user interface [13][37], considered ’natural’ and ’intuitive’ 
their use [6][7][14].  
The use of multi-touch interfaces has been receiving an 
increasing attention in recent time, given the diversity of 
devices that supports multi-touch and gestural input [38], 
such as mobile devices [31], tablet devices [13], tabletop 
42

ACHI 2014 : The Seventh International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

devices [39], becoming these type of interfaces very popular 
[7], promoting easier hand-eye coordination [6], and 
interesting to users of all ages [6].  
Multi-touch interfaces using the fingers of one or two 
hands were evaluated through different gestures on 
touchscreen, e.g., tap, drag, rotate, resize [11][32][34][40]. 
Piper et al. [40] showed that older adults are appropriate 
to performing multi-touch gestures, however, with difficulty 
in gestures that involve fine motor movements, i.e., gestures 
involving two or more fingers, e.g., rotate gesture. Leonardi 
et al. [11] mentioned that tap gestures using a single finger, 
are easy to understand and remember by older adults but 
with difficulties in drag gesture, due to lack of constant 
pressure. Findlater et al. [34] verified the presence of some 
errors in the “zoom out” gesture and the absence of errors in 
the  “zoom in” gesture. Stößel et al. [31], referred that older 
adults are slower than young adults in multi-touch 
interaction, but with similar error-prone.  
Tabletop devices are a type of touchscreens, very 
appropriate for elder’s, making use of a large interaction 
area and with multi-user support [37][39], a playful way for 
promoting their face-to-face social interaction, like their 
daily activities, e.g., playing board games.  
Gaming is an interesting domain for multi-touch 
interfaces. An illustrative example is [37], that explored 
multi-touch interfaces as a gaming platform for older adults. 
The designing of multi-touch interfaces for elders 
requires the consideration of a diversity of aspects that will 
be addressed in the next section.  
D. Designing of Multi-Touch Interfaces for Elders 
As mentioned before, tabletop devices are appropriate 
for elder users, and the designing of multi-touch interfaces 
for this type of devices will now be described. 
It is well known that aging inevitably brings changes to 
the physical and cognitive abilities of humans [41] and 
consequently the design of a user interface should 
accommodate the limitations caused by these changes [7], 
stimulating the development of technologies more usable by 
older adults [6]. 
Lists of design guidelines of multi-touch interfaces for 
elders are not abundant in the literature, however,     
Boustani [7] presented a set of touch-based design 
guidelines for elders, that is a good starting point for 
designing of multi-touch interfaces for elders, however 
some important aspects are missing, e.g., the reference of 
gestures desirable and avoidable by this type of users and 
guidelines to help the interface testing. 
Although, in multi-touch interface design be possible the 
use of guidelines of other types of user interfaces, e.g., web 
design guidelines, given that, some guidelines are similar in 
both user interfaces, such as content layout design, text 
design, use of colors. However, specific aspects of multi-
touch interfaces, e.g., the adequacy of gestures, ideal display 
size and feedback are not covered and are crucial in the 
design of an elder-friendly multi-touch interface. Designing 
of multi-touch interfaces for elders should aim at attenuating 
the limitations caused by aging. To this end, some practical 
guidelines will be mentioned according to age-related 
change: 
 
Visual changes - is suggested that the user interface 
should have an appropriate size of design elements 
and text [6][13], making use of high contrast colors 
[1] [6][7][8][18]; 
 
Hearing changes - is recommended the presence of 
a control to adjust audio [1][6][8][20][21];  
 
Motor changes - the design of user interface should 
contains large targets for accurate selections [6][7] 
[8], avoid the use of scrolling [6][7][8][18] and 
exhibit slower response times [6][40]; 
 
Memory changes - the interface should have 
appropriate feedback [1][42], including the current 
location in the system [7][8][18] and the use of 
meaningful icons [1][7][8][18]; 
 
Attention changes - potential distracting elements 
should be avoided, such as, animations [7][8] and 
irrelevant informations [6][7][8][18]. 
In addition to the last practical guidelines mentioned, 
other considerations should be taken into account, e.g., tap 
gestures are easy to understand and remember being 
appreciated by elderly people, as well as iconic gestures 
[11]; positioning at the surface is critical, the user should be 
able to reach the entire interface and tactile user feedback 
and natural affordances are also needed [42].  
The reviewing of works on design guidelines of       
multi-touch interfaces for elders is more detailed in    
Section IV.

METHODOLOGY 
The list of design guidelines was reached using the 
methodology described in the following steps. 
 
1) Selection of relevant works on design guidelines of 
multi-touch interfaces for elders: From literature were 
selected a set of most relevant works that focused on design 
guidelines of multi-touch interfaces for older adults. 
2) Creation of an initial set of design guidelines: From 
the analysis of the works identified in step 1, it was created 
an initial set of 138 design guidelines. 
3) Review, grouping and organization of the initial set 
of design guidelines: The initial set of design guidelines was 
reviewed, in order to: discover and associate identical 
guidelines, detect and resolve the guidelines that are in 
divergence 
and 
rewrite 
indistinct 
guidelines. 
After 
reviewing guidelines, 10 meaningful groups of guidelines 
were created, associating each guideline with a group, 
originating the final list of design guidelines.  
4)  Completing data of each design guideline: For each 
design guideline were filled the following fields: guideline 
number,

title, 
guideline 
group, 
guideline 
description, an illustrative example, the works that referred 
the guideline denominated guideline source and a set of tags 
that classifies the guideline.

guidelines, focusing the essential aspects on design of multi-
touch interfaces for elders. The goal is to be a useful 
resource for designers, application developers, usability 
specialists and researchers. 
IV. 
REVIEW OF DESIGN GUIDELINES OF MULTI-TOUCH 
INTERFACES FOR ELDERS 
In this section, a selection of the most relevant works on 
design guidelines of multi-touch interfaces for elders 
available in the literature, will be presented and 
summarized. 
Leonardi et al. [11] conducted a preliminary study on a 
touch-based gestural interface (Mobitable), to assist elders 
in the use of social networking. The study verified the 
appropriateness of this type of interfaces, mentioning some 
considerations on design, e.g., tilted or adjustable display, 
can ease the interface visualization. 
Apted et al. [39] described the design of SharePic - a 
collaborative digital photograph sharing application. An 
easy to learn and remember multi-touch and gestural 
application used by multiple users on a tabletop. An 
evaluation was conducted, with young and older adults, 
verifying difficulty in two-handed gestures, performed by 
older adults. Design guidelines were pointed, e.g., should be 
possible to enlarge the interface elements and the 
interactivity should be focused on learnability and 
memorability. 
Kin et al. [43] studied the performance in multiple target 
selection using a mouse, a multi-touch workstation, with a 
single finger, two fingers (one of each hand) and multiple 
fingers interaction. The results revealed greater speed with 
the use of multi-touch interaction, independently of the 
number of targets. Moreover, it was mentioned some design 
considerations of applications whose target selection is the 
primary task, e.g., the use of two-fingers in the multi-touch 
interaction does not provide any performance improvement 
in the multi-target selection. 
Piper et al. [40] examined accessibility issues in the use 
of surface computing by older adults and investigated the 
appeal of this interaction technique for health care support. 
A study that involved the performing of set of tasks by older 
adults was done. The results showed that participants had 
difficulty with gestures involving two or more fingers, e.g., 
resize and rotate. Additionally, it was referred some design 
guidelines, such as, provide cues for interaction and the 
display size may be intimidating. 
Silva and Nunes [5] conducted usability tests with older 
adults in the context of the European project Enhanced 
Complete 
Ambient 
Assisted 
Living 
Experiment 
(eCAALYX). From their experience a set of guidelines of 
usability tests for older adults was presented. These include 
guidelines, such as informing the older adult of the goal of 
the project beforehand, talk to privileged informers, and 
make it clear that they are not being tested. 
Bachl et al. [42] discussed eight challenges in designing 
multi-touch interfaces, grouped in three categories, 
specifically, screen-based, user-based and input-based 
challenges. Some examples of challenges debated were: the 
necessity of tactile user feedback during the interaction, 
individual differences of the users, for instance hand size are 
relevant in designing of multi-touch interfaces and 
distinguishing and identifying users in the multi-user 
support. 
Nunes [8] presented a set of design guidelines to guide 
the design and planning of usability tests of TV-based user 
interfaces for older adults, derived from the knowledge of 
the analysis, design and evaluation of a TV system for the 
European project eCAALYX [18]. Guidelines, such as, give 
them time to learn, use simple phrasing, use a very large 
font type, remove sound distractions and provide a good 
navigation are examples included in this collection. 
Caseiro [13] created an Android tablet gaming platform 
to provide cognitive games. User management and the 
cognitive performance of players were the main features of 
this platform. Design considerations highlighted, use of big 
button size; use of colors with good contrast; use a suitable 
text size, among others. 
Banovic et al. [44] explored the efficient design of 
context menus manipulated by a single hand on multi-touch 
surface. A context menu design for a horizontal tabletop 
surfaces was proposed, as well as, design guidelines for 
single hand multi-target selection using multi-touch 
interactions, e.g., interfaces should encourage users to 
approach from south (S), southeast (SE), or east (E) to the 
primary target and the use of index finger (index-anchored) 
or the thumb (thumb-anchored) to select the primary target 
does not influence the performance. 
Boustani [7] presented a list of twenty nine guidelines 
distributed by ten groups of touch-based interfaces design 
guidelines for the elderly people, derived from a set of 
related works available in the literature. Examples of 
guidelines referred, irrelevant information on the screen 
should be avoided and blue and yellow or red and green 
tones should not be used. The identified guidelines were 
used in the design of application Keep in Touch (Kit) a 
platform easy to learn and understand in the communication 
between older adults. 
Caprani et al. [6] investigated the use of touchscreen 
technology for elders. The research was focused on several 
aspects, such as, study of main characteristics of the older 
user, use of technology by older adults, comparison of 
touchscreens with other pointing devices, design guidelines 
for touch-screen devices, among others. Examples of 
referenced guidelines in this work: use high contrast 
between the elements of the user interface, use of buttons 
with big size and scrolling should be avoided. 
Farage et al. [1] summarized the main age-related  
changes, addressing specifically, changes in the visual 
function; hearing; touch and temperature perception, 
mobility, and balance; memory and cognition. For each one 
age-related change were suggested concrete design 
guidelines to attenuate these limitations, e.g., use colors 
with good contrast (visual changes), increase duration of 
sound signal (hearing changes) and use of icons along with 
labels (cognitive changes). 
Jin et al. [45] investigated the spacing and size of 
buttons in a touchscreen user interface used by older adults. 
During the experiments it was measured the reaction time, 
44

accuracy and user preferences. The results of this research 
showed that large button have shorter reaction times and 
larger 
space 
between 
buttons 
does 
not 
improve 
performance. 
Nunes et al. [18] presented a set of thirteen 
recommendations for designing TV user interfaces for older 
adults. These recommendations were based on design, 
testing, and development of a TV-based health system. Use 
consistency to facilitate recognition, show the current 
selection clearly and give users time to read, are examples 
of recommendations suggested. 
All works detailed here were used to form the list of 
design guidelines, presented in the next section. 
V. 
FINAL DESIGN GUIDELINES 
The final design guidelines are composed by 113 distinct 
guidelines, grouped under 10 distinct category headings, as 
illustrated in Figure 1. The categories used in the grouping 
of guidelines was based on classification used by       
Boustani [7] and Kurniawan and Zaphiris [46]. Some 
selected examples of each category are listed below. 
 
 
Figure 1. Guidelines Categories [47] 
G1 - Target Design 
 
 
Ensure the user can easily make interface elements 
larger (adjustable); 
 
Different physical properties have to be considered 
while designing the interface (e.g. size of buttons); 
 
Provide a cursor showing clearly the selected target. 
It should be obvious to older adults what can be 
selected and what cannot. 
 
G2 - Use of Graphics 
 
 
Use icons along with labels. Icons should be simple 
and meaningful; text incorporated with the icon 
when possible; 
 
Use high contrast between the elements of the user 
interface. A high contrast between the foreground 
and background should exist; 
 
Blue and yellow or red and green tones should be 
avoided. Warm colors are the most suitable. 
 
G3 - Navigation and Errors 
 
 
Provide a good navigation; 
 
Show the current location clearly; 
 
Design error messages that make it clear that the 
user is not the cause of the error; 
 
Make it easy for user to correct input errors. 
 
G4 - Content Layout Design 
 
 
Concentrate information on the center of the screen; 
 
Avoid the use of scroll; 
 
Maintain consistency in the user interface. Screen 
layout, navigation and terminology used should be 
simple, clear and consistent; 
 
Remove user interface elements calling attention as 
soon as they are not needed. 
 
G5 - User Cognitive Design 
 
 
Be prepared for older adults that refuse to learn; 
 
Make use of behaviors developed by older adults to 
cope with memory loss; 
 
Give them time to read. Older adults usually read 
more slowly (than younger adults); 
 
Avoid forcing users to read at very close distances. 
 
G6 - Audio 
 
 
Enable older adults to adjust the volume at their will; 
 
Increase duration of sound signals; 
 
Use male voices for delivering auditory information; 
 
Remove sound distractions. 
 
G7 - Text Design 
 
 
Use a very large font type; 
 
Use left-aligned text; 
 
Use an easy to read font family; 
 
Use medium or bold face type, e.g., Sans Serif type 
font, i.e., Helvetica, Arial. Avoid other fancy font 
types. 
 
G8 - User Feedback and Support 
 
 
Accessibility issues should be taken into account, for 
example giving tools to allow the use by blind 
people; 
 
The lack of tactile user feedback also affects the user 
experience of data input on multi-touch interfaces;  
 
Use supporting peripherals if needed. 
 
G9 - Multi-Touch Interaction 
 
 
Tap gestures (when applied to well recognized 
objects) are the easiest ones to understand and 
remember;  
 
Iconic gestures are very engaging; 
 
Provide cues for interaction for initial learning and 
sub- sequent use of the technology;

 
Positioning at the surface is critical; the user should 
be able easily reach the interface corners. 
 
G10- Interface Testing 
 
 
Inform the older adult of the goal of the project 
beforehand; 
 
Keep the test short and make use of breaks; 
 
Respect the opinions of the test participants. 
 
Due to space restrictions for this paper, certain guidelines 
were omitted, as well as, descriptive data, including, 
guideline description, works that cited the guideline, 
illustrative examples, etc. The complete list of design 
guidelines can be obtained from [47]. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we presented a properly organized set of 
design guidelines of multi-touch interfaces for elders, 
refined and extracted from most relevant works presented in 
the literature. This set of design guidelines was structured in 
a very detailed and comprehensive way, covering the main 
age-related changes that might affect the usability of the 
interactivity in the multi-touch interfaces, becoming an 
important resource for designers, application developers, 
usability specialists and researchers to guiding and 
evaluating the design of this type of user interfaces for elder 
users.  
As future work, we are considering the possibility of 
incorporating the design guidelines in an automatic 
detection system that identifies and suggests guidelines 
during the testing of a multi-touch interface; increasing the 
list of design guidelines with inclusion of other design 
guidelines; the reviewing and rating of the design guidelines 
by experts, in order to validate their usefulness, as well as a 
comparison of the design of a multi-touch interface for 
elders with and without the use of proposed guidelines to 
verify its impact on usability.
