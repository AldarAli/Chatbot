Abstract — The fact that training classification algorithms in a 
within-subject design is inferior to training on between subject 
data is discussed for an electrophysiological data set. Event-
related potentials  were recorded from 18 subjects, emotionally 
stimulated by a series of 18 negative, 18 positive and 18 neutral 
pictures of the International Affective Picture System. In 
addition to traditional averaging and group comparison of  
event related potentials, electroencephalographical data have 
been intra- and inter-individually classified using a Support 
Vector Machine for emotional conditions. Support vector 
machine classifications based upon intraindividual data 
showed 
significantly 
higher 
classification 
rates 
[F(19.498),p<.001] than  global ones. An effect size was 
calculated (d = 1.47) and the origin of this effect is discussed 
within the context of individual response specificities. This 
study clearly shows that classification accuracy can be boosted 
by using individual specific settings.

I.       INTRODUCTION  
Human life is increasingly influenced by complex 
information technology. Some years ago it was clear for a 
given user whether and how he interacted with a technical 
system. Today and in the future people will interact with 
various elements of this information technology to a far 
greater extent and in very heterogeneous ways. Ambient 
Intelligence for example, will be able to assist users smartly 
while preserving security and privacy [1]. Also, systems 
must automatically adapt to different communication 
modalities and the cognitive, emotional and motivational 
needs of users. Conceptualization of user-friendly features 
(usability) must go beyond traditional improvement of 
dialogs and develop empathic machines [2]. Particularly, 
methods are required, which allow one to use features and 
expressions of a user's emotional behavior for functional 
features and interaction design. Psychobiological parameters 
of the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS) 
are a continuously available source of emotion indicators. 
Using psychobiological measurements, predictions are more 
reliable as they show a decreased amount of reactance 
compared to the assessment via questionnaire or rating. 
A. Individual data analysis 
The concept of individuality and the associated 
specificities is nothing new in psychological research. 
Dealing with these circumstances in technical context means 
that one can calculate formulas or train classifiers and 
achieve very good results, but if the application on a single 
person is tried, classification rates are not ideal. This is 
especially problematic in an affective context, where things 
are quite fuzzy. Therefore, we tried to address this 
phenomenon and discuss the effect.  
B. Individual psychobiological classifications 
The 
question 
is 
whether 
there 
are 
specific 
psychobiological emotion patterns that can be assigned to 
certain emotional states? In past decades, several studies 
have been done searching for corresponding emotion 
patterns by means of regression analysis and analysis of 
variance, and demonstrated differences between subjects 
(interindividually) [3] [4]. In these psychobiological studies, 
patterns can be found that differentiate along emotional 
states: heart-rate variability (HRV) [5], skin conductance 
level (SCL) [5] or the late positive potential (LPP) [6] [7] 
for example. The present study shows, when interindividual 
and 
within 
subjects 
(intraindividually) 
determined 
psychobiological patterns are compared, the intraindividual 
approach shows superior results in classifying emotional 
states compared to the interindividual (global) one. We 
statistically tested (by using the effect size) the hypothesis 
that classification based upon intraindividual variance of the 
psychobiological reaction [4] shows more accurate results of 
emotion classification compared to classification based on 
interindividual variance. The influence of individuality on 
emotional experience is well known [8] [9], but so far, does

not have a big impact on computer based emotion 
recognition.  
Kim and Andre [5], for instance, argue that emotional 
experience 
is 
a 
construct 
of 
cognitive 
processes, 
physiological arousal, motivational tendencies, behavioral 
reactions and subjective feelings. They further report that 
physiological activity is not an independent variable, but 
rather reflects experienced emotional states with consistent 
correlates. We support this view and additionally believe 
that variance caused by the subjective character of the 
emotional experience can be used to achieve a more precise 
classification. To demonstrate this effect, we used very 
reliable stimulus material - the International Affective 
Picture System (IAPS) [10]. This stimulation material is 
described very well in its ability to induce emotions as well 
as to evoke CNS activity. Visual stimuli are often used in 
emotional psychobiology. Many studies have proven the 
IAPS-stimuli [3] [6] [7] to be a valid tool for controlled 
induction of emotion.  
C. Analyzing central nervous responses   
Apart from imaging methods, the electroencephalogram 
(EEG) is designed for the operationalization of the activity 
of the central nervous system. EEG is the method of choice 
for processing emotional stimuli, particularly when 
processing of emotional information takes place in a rapid 
temporal state on a scale of seconds [6]. As Schupp and 
colleagues showed, the time window between 350-750 ms 
after stimulus onset is profoundly relevant for processing of 
emotional pleasure. This CNS activity is called late positive 
potential (LPP) due to its relatively positive change in 
potential and it’s delayed (as far as EEGs go) onset [11]. 
LPP differentiates CNS processing of negative, neutral and 
positive visual emotional stimuli in a characteristic manner 
[6] [7]. 
D. Aims of this study 
The aim of the present study is to determine the affective 
state post hoc via EEG-analysis by means of mathematical 
classification algorithms. The influence of individual 
variances on classification rates is quantified giving their 
effect size. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used as  
classification method. SVMs transform the underlying data 
set into a higher dimensional space, in which a complex 
geometric separation plane is then drawn. This separation 
remains even after the subsequent transformation back to 
"normal" space [12]. Furthermore, this study intends to 
demonstrate statistically – with p-level and effect size [12] - 
that a classification approach, in which the SVM is trained 
with all data sets of all available subjects is inferior to 
training with individual data. 
E. Article structure 
In the following subsections, experimental conditions are 
described, followed by an overview of the classification 
procedure. Afterwards, results are presented for a) statistical 
analysis of preprocessed EEG data and b) comparison of 
two classification approaches, optimized using individual- 
and global fitted parameter settings. Finally, in the 
discussion 
part, 
individual 
specific 
influences 
on 
classification rates are discussed. 
II. 
METHODS 
In this subsection, data assessment and the experimental 
setup will be described.   
A.  Subjects 
18 (9 female) subjects (age range 18-30) were involved 
in the study. All subjects were right-handed, healthy, with 
no psychiatric history and had normal or corrected vision. 
The study participants received 15 euro remuneration. 
Subjects were informed about the content and procedure of 
the study. Following the respective briefing, which was 
conducted according to the criteria of the Ethics Committee 
of the Medical Faculty of the University of Ulm, the 
individual participants signed a written consent form 
concerning their participation in the study. The present 
study was classified as ethically unobjectionable (sfb ethics 
vote no. 245/08). 
B. Experimental conditions 
The subjects were instructed by the experimenter, about 
the course of events during the experiment, relevant tasks 
and the rating procedure using the Self-Assessment Manikin 
(SAM) [13]. The experiment took place in a darkened room 
within the Emotion Lab at the University of Ulm 
(Germany).  
Psychobiological parameters were measured using 
sensors 
with 
a 
MindMedia 
NeXus-32 
amplifier 
(http://www.mindmedia.nl) on 19 EEG and two EOG 
(horizontal, vertical) channels. EEG was recorded from 19 
sites according to the 10/20 system [14] using an Easycap. 
Ag/AgCl electrodes were placed at FP1, FP2, AFz, F3, F5, 
F7, F6, Fz, C3, C5, Cz, FCz, P3, P5, Pz, O1, O2, T7 and T8. 
The linked mastoid (A1, A2) served as a reference. Data 
were digitized at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. Subjects were 
instructed to autonomous start the experiment with a mouse 
click as soon as the researcher left the room. After 
completing the experiment, subjects were asked to fill out 
some questionnaires about their personal constitution (NEO-
FFI, 16 PF-R). 
C. Experimental design 
During the experiment, a set of selected images from the 
International Affective Picture System [10] was presented 
on a 21” CRT display at a distance of approximately 50 cm 
from the subject. Eighteen negative, eighteen positive and 
eighteen neutral pictures (54 in total) were presented in 
random order. Each image was presented for 6 seconds, 
followed by a variable jitter between 6 and 12 seconds. This 
served to prevent expectations. The individual impression of 
the subject was captured directly after each picture using the 
SAM [13]. Stimuli were presented using custom written 
72

software [15]. The same software was used for data 
acquisition.  
D. EEG Preprocessing 
Because 
of 
typical 
characteristics 
of 
an 
electrophysiological channel, the EEG signal recorded at the 
skull must be significantly amplified. This makes the 
analysis of the overall signal more difficult. The amplifier 
not only amplifies the desired psychobiological signals but 
also the background noise (mains hum, etc.). EEG signals 
can 
easily 
be 
corrupted 
and biased by 
applying 
inappropriate preprocessing, which has to be performed 
carefully for this reason. Therefore, we used the EEGLAB 
toolbox [16] developed for MATLAB.  
First, the recorded data were imported and visualized by 
EEGLAB. The EEG signal was visually screened for 
artifacts. Whenever there was an artifact of more than 
100mV in amplitude, the entire trial was excluded from 
further analyses. Subsequently, the EEG-signal was 
corrected for vertical and horizontal eye movement artifacts 
as described previously [17]. Only artifact-free trials with 
congruent subjective and normative categorizations of the 
pictures were included. Overall, 6.4% of all data were 
excluded from further investigation due to artifacts. To 
extract the EEG frequency range relevant for this study, data 
were band-pass filtered. The lower threshold of the filter 
was set to 0.1 Hz (high-pass) to eliminate linear trends in 
signal recording, while an upper threshold of 20 Hz (low-
pass) cut off high-frequency noise. Preprocessed data were 
epoched in a further step – this means, separated by the 
stimulus category and edited to represent a time window of 
one second pre-stimulus to 6 seconds post-stimulus. In an 
averaging procedure data of the individual images of the 
respective categories were averaged across all subjects. 
Results of the averaging procedure are shown in Fig. 2.  
Statistical analysis of EEG data was carried out with SPSS 
13. A t-test was used to compare the conditions of positive, 
negative and neutral conditions. The mean value of 350-750 
ms after stimulus onset was used as a basis for statistical 
analysis. 
E. Classification procedure 
For classification of different psychobiological affective 
states we chose SVMs, as they have been proven to be very 
effective before [18] [19] [20], and to maintain enough 
flexibility with regard to their main parameter optimization 
(as discussed below) [21]. The goal of a SVM is to develop 
a predictive model from a given training data set , so that 
respective training sets  and their associated labels y can 
be applied to an unlabeled test set in order to assign the test 
set to a particular class. In this case the SVM [22] aims to 
find an optimal solution for the following problem: 
minimize with respect to:  
 
w, b, ξ: 
	

 ww  C ∑
ξ

	   (1) 
 
So that the following constraint applies:  
 
ywx  b  1  ξ,  1  i  m, ξ  0  (2) 
 
By means of a kernel function : 
 
,  ! " #$# !  (3) 
 
the training sets   are transformed to a higher 
dimensional space, in which the SVM finds a separating 
hyperplane with maximum width. In the present case the 
Gaussian kernel was used 
 
 ,  ! = exp'(   (²),' * 0  (4) 
 
because it is able to handle non-linear dependencies 
between class labels and input attributes. Furthermore, the 
Gaussian kernel has the advantage that the complexity of the 
model is not influenced by too many parameters, but is only 
limited to two main parameters (C;γ, C>0), which enter into 
the above equation as a penalty parameter for the error term 
in (1).  
For more details, the reader may refer to [12]. In the 
present study the classification was applied on the LPP 
using SVM. The time window for the LPP was ranging 
from 350-750 ms after stimulus onset [6]. Furthermore, the 
results of [7] served as a guide, as they show that, among 
others, the data of the EEG channel Fz are particularly 
effective in separating the three affective states. After the 
abovementioned preprocessing of EEG data from the Fz 
channel and subsequent epoching of all data of all subjects 
within the mentioned time window, every epoch was 
baseline corrected with a time segment of 350-400 ms after 
stimulus onset in order to make them more comparable. 
This step should create a distribution of the values around 
the baseline. The remaining data resulted in a 89 samples 
array (350ms measured at 250Hz). Finally the epochs were 
labeled according to the pleasure information (positive, 
negative or neutral). Thus, for every subject remained a data 
set with 54 epochs of 90 values each (89 time samples - 
corresponds to 89 features + 1 label attribute). No further 
features were added.  
The SVM was developed as a binary classifier, but since 
this work intends to differentiate three states (negative, 
positive and neutral), the use of the LIBSVM learner 
developed by Chang and Lin was utilized, since it extends 
the principle of the traditional SVM and is able to 
differentiate multiple classes [23]. To obtain the influence of 
individuality on affective computing, optimal SVM 
parameters a systematic grid search was performed for C 
and γ with concluding leave-one-out cross-validation. 
Individual pairs of C- and –γ values are taken, plugged into 
the SVM and their classification accuracy is calculated 
using the leave-one-out cross-validation. After explorative 
testing of all combinations, the pair with the highest 
accuracy was finally selected as the optimal parameter set.

When choosing the parameter values, we followed the 
procedure of Hsu, Chang and Lin. [21], who recommend 
exponentially growing sequences for C and γ. In the first 
processing step, all steps of the classification procedure 
were carried out with the combined data set of all subjects 
(global), and the corresponding optimal parameter pair 
(Cglobal and γglobal) was determined (see Classification 
results). In a further processing step, the parameters Cglobal 
and γglobal of the SVM already identified by means of the 
global sample were applied to the data sets of the 
individuals (individual). The results are shown in Fig. 2. In 
an exploratory study, a parameter optimization on an 
individual level (Cindividual and γindividual) was also performed, 
and the results of this optimization are also shown in Fig. 2.

RESULTS 
In this subsection, results are shown of a) preprocessed 
data and b) the classification procedure. 
A. EEG Preprocessing

average across all subjects) of the three conditions.  
 
Figure 1.  Grand averages of the evoked potentials on Fz for the three 
different conditions neutral(_ _ _), positive(      ) and negative(_._._). 
Further 
statistical 
analyses 
illustrated 
significant 
differences for the neutral versus negative and neutral 
versus positive conditions. A t-test for negative versus 
positive did not show any significant differences in the time 
frame of interest. Results of the Tukeys test for Fz electrode 
showed a significant difference for positive vs. neutral 
[t(11.4) = 3.59, p< 0.01] and negative vs. neutral [t(11.4) = 
3.25, p < .05]. No significant differences were found for the 
conditions negative vs. positive [t(11.4) = 0.45, p = 0.661]. 
B. Classification results 
Using the obtained optimal parameters Cglobal (= 215) and 
γglobal (=2-11), the classification across all subjects (global) 
using leave-one-out cross-validation, resulted in an accuracy 
(relative number of correctly classified epochs) of 38.77%. 
The outcome of using global optimal parameters for 
calculating the detection rate at the individual level is shown 
in Fig. 2 for the respective subjects. However, if one 
calculates the optimal parameters specifically for each 
individual and uses them for classification, classification 
rate for each individual increases significantly.

determined optimal parameters: classification rates with globally 
determined optimal parameters applied to each individual (black bars);

the classification demonstrated here is based on the use of intracellular 
variance of CNS activity. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Although statistical analysis was not able to show a 
difference between the classes positive and negative, 
classification rates were mostly above chance level. 
A. Conclusion of aims and scopes 
Objectives of this study were a) to classify emotional 
categories positive, neutral and negative using EEG signals 
and b) to demonstrate the influence of individual 
specificities on affective computing. Classification of the 
respective categories was performed with SVMs for each 
individual subject. In contrast to state of the art 
classification studies [6], this study used only filtered EEG 
data without any additional feature extraction. We did not 
use any special feature extraction due to the research 
question of individual differences and their impact on 
classification. Using pre-defined settings for detecting 
emotions (a global approach), some accuracy gets lost 
compared to use of a special trained classification 
(individual approach) process. This loss of accuracy may

have several origins. On the one side, there is the accuracy 
of the classifier itself, which is more specified to unique 
patterns of an individual when it is trained only on 
responses of this particular person. On the other side there 
are the influences of the person itself, of their body and 
mind. These influences are known as individual specificities 
[9] and shall be discussed in the following subsection.  
Using this knowledge of the origin of the variance 
caused by individual specificities, a model can be found, 
which provides more accuracy in the prediction of the 
emotional state than it would be possible by using further 
and further improved predefined settings. 
B. General discussion 
Using 
global 
determined 
optimal 
parameters 
for 
classification, detection rates that are not much higher than 
the mathematically random chance rates of 33.33% were 
calculated. If one determines the optimal parameters 
specifically for each individual, detection rates of over 40% 
up to 100% are possible (Fig. 2). This improvement is 
statistically significant [F(19.498), p< .001] with an effect 
size of d=1.47. Despite of the obtained individual, optimal 
parameters, there can be no question of overfitting. It is not, 
due to the fact that in the majority of data, an influence of 
variance caused by false true detection can be seen. The 
exceptions, which show a classification rate of 100% are 
owed to an extraordinary good physiological response of the 
subjects.  
If one wants to deduce emotions of a person from their 
psychobiological reactions, it is necessary to keep the 
individual patterns, with which that person responds to 
emotional stimuli, in mind. This information would not be 
needed if all people would react equally to emotional 
stimuli. Since this is not the case, the individual variance of 
the psychobiological reaction enters into the error term. The 
theoretical starting point of this approach goes back to 
Lacey and colleagues, who were the first to empirically 
research the concept of response specificity (RS) [25]. The 
concept of RS is based on the assumption that variance of 
psychobiological reactions is due to situational, individual 
and motivational influences [26]. According to Lacey there 
are two types of individual response specificities (IRS) – 
intra stressor specificity, which can be observed in moments 
of stressful stimulation like showing a picture of a snake to 
a woman who is sensitive for this kind of fear.  
The second concept is Symptom-stereotypy, which is 
characterized by the form of the maximal physiological 
response to a stimulus. The fact, that these responses are 
stable within the individual user is of great interest for 
interpretation of the physiological signal by a technical 
system. RS and especially IRS have been shown to have an 
impact on psychobiological empirically by Marwitz and 
Stemmler [27]. In the context of the results shown in this 
study, this means that there are response patterns to 
emotional stimuli, which are user-specific and therefore 
help to increase classification accuracy within the individual 
subject. If it is tried to generalize these findings to a 
between subject design, the classifier is over-fitted and 
prediction accuracy is decreasing, which would not be the 
case, if everyone would be responding in the same way. 
Using this knowledge, one can think of a sort of calibration 
technique, which supports the classifier to find a unique 
setting for a unique user. 
Stemmler and Wacker [9] showed in their experiments 
that individual variance can be found in both the central and 
the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, the results of this 
study should not only be of interest for EEG analysis, but 
also for peripheral channels such as heart rate or skin 
conductance. But there are other sources of variance, too. 
Gender for example is known to have an influence on the 
shape of an ERP signal [28]. And there is even more, age, or 
the state of physical- and mental-health. All these factors are 
confounding the signal of one particular person and 
therefore decrease the accuracy of a classifier system.   
As far as we know, the effect of individual variance is 
well known but the strength of the effect, which is of great 
interest for technical use, has not been quantified yet. 
Therefore we calculated the effect size, which is a much 
more reliable predictor for comparing these conditions than 
a simple correlation could be [24]. In the related literature, 
classifications using EEG data are quiet common, Schaaff & 
Schultz [29] for example were also using SVMs for the 
classification of EEG-data recorded by an EEG-Headband 
to recognize emotions for a humanoid robot the recognition-
rate of 47,11% was achieved by a separated training and 
classification for each subject (N=5). If a relatively small 
group-size is used, the chance of measuring a homogenous 
group-effect is quite high. To get a more representative 
sample, we used a larger group consisting of both genders at 
heterogeneous age. In addition we used an Easy-cap, which 
is standard in EEG-research and therefore very reliable. 
Using these setting, we found the effect reported above, 
which plays an important role in the variance of the 
psychophysiological signal. This leads to several new 
questions for further research. According to the approach of 
individual specificities, one can try to quantify the different 
variances-sources and separate the error term in an 
individual manner, which will be more reliable than training 
on a steadily changing signal. This is economical as well. 
Due to the change of these individual factors, the training of 
the classifier will have to be done several times again, if the 
accuracy should not drop. But the more variance is solved in 
terms of known individual factors, the less is changing over 
time and situations.    
We suggest that there has to be some sort of calibration, 
where the variance, caused by individual specificities can be 
identified and therefore gets solved. In general, it is likely 
that the classification rate in this study could have been 
improved by using an increased number of features; for 
example by adding means, variances or amplitudes and 
latencies of certain peaks, etc. see [20] for a detailed 
overview. In contrast to other studies [4] [5] [6] [8], further

optimization of the classification rate was not the objective 
of this study. These sorts of techniques can be used 
additionally to explain the variance of the signal. What 
should be shown in this study is that there is a big effect, 
which has not been used yet that provides the opportunity to 
extract a more stable and more precise prediction of the 
affective state of a user. In future work, we will try to 
identify factors that explain the individual variance in a 
stable way. Therefore, a sample has to be chosen, which is 
big enough and heterogenic enough to vary the most 
common ways of individual specificities in a controlled 
paradigm.
