Abstract - Since the 2012 National Hockey League (NHL) 
Lockout, there have been many economic trends in the league 
that one might argue inconsistent. While many players’ 
salaries were significantly altered as results of buy-outs or 
extravagant contract signings, the salary cap has fluctuated 
dramatically in the following years due to these chaotic 
activities. To understand the seemingly contradicting NHL 
economic trends, in this paper, we discuss League Adjusted 
Salary Model (LASM) applying Local Polynomial Regression 
Modeling to properly gauge a player’s monetary vs. 
production feasibility value. The League Adjusted Salary 
Model is a approach that is dependent on a player’s League-
Relative Salary Percentages and his Individual Production. 
The League Relativity is emphasized to account for the 
different payrolls of all 30 NHL teams and to understand the 
year-by-year economic trend. The Individual Production is a 
user flexible element of the individual level model that can be 
improved with utilizations of “Enhanced Statistics” such as 
Unblocked 
Shot 
Attempt 
Relative 
Percentage 
values. 
Combining these two data sets, we apply the Local Polynomial 
Regression Modeling to compute the feasibility of cost and 
production.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
After the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) 
in 2012, National Hockey League (NHL) teams were 
granted opportunities to buy-out players under contract. A 
record number of 26 players were bought out since June 23, 
2013. Of the 26 players, only 16 remain in NHL at reduced 
salary (with a notable exception of Christian Ehrhoff). 
Unfortunately, the rate of reduction in salary is seemingly 
random. The sudden decrease in salaries for these players 
impacts the overall economy of the game. The new cap 
space acquired by the decrease in salaries allows (1) teams 
to sign more players, or (2) teams to re-sign players with a 
bump in salary. These two scenarios present difficulties in 
projecting salaries of other players based on performance.  
Once a player’s decrease or increase in salary can be put 
into the context of whole league, then we may establish a 
regression model that projects a player’s upcoming salary, 
which we’ll call “League Adjusted Salary Model.” League 
Adjusted 
Salary 
Model 
employs 
Local 
Polynomial 
Regression Modeling to account for random noises and 
possibly misunderstood NHL contracts. League Adjusted 
Salary Model is an improvement from the simple linear 
regression on salary vs. performance, which is the 
traditional school thought in hockey analytics community 
[1].  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
explains the methodology behind League-Relative Salary 
Percentage, League-Relative Cap Percentage, and League-
Adjusted Salary Model. Section 3 describes the application 
of the model on training set data from the 2010~2011 NHL 
season to 2013~2014 NHL season. Section 4 concludes the 
paper with final remarks on the potential of the proposed 
model and possible improvements to it. 
II. 
THE LEAGUE ADJUSTED SALARY MODEL 
The League Adjusted Salary Model is a two-part process, 
where the League-Relative Percentages (Salary and Cap) 
must be computed first. Then, a comparison of Linear 
Regression and Local Polynomial Regression Modeling is 
performed to provide a method that better fits the Cap and 
Salary. With the League Adjusted Salary Model, one may 
apply it for various purposes such as for determining the 
Expected Future Salary or possible statistical areas of 
improvement to maximize the salary potential.  For this 
research, only the data for forwards and defensemen were 
considered, 
as 
goalies 
have 
independent 
valuation 
processes. 
A. League-Relative Percentages 
In order to compensate for the uncertainty level of 
buyouts, we introduce “League-Relative Salary Percentage” 
and “League-Relative Cap Percentage.” The League-
Relative Percentages ignore the unpredictability of contract 
buy-outs and re-signing, as one player moves from one team 
to another, the relative worth changes in respect to the 
particular team. The League-Relative Salary Percentage 
allows for low-market teams that are bounded by internal 
payroll amount. The League-Relative Salary Percentage is 
essentially a proportion of a player’s True Salary/Cap to a 
sum of all NHL team’s payrolls. We make a note that True 
Salary and Cap will be treated separately as explained 
further later. 
If a player was bought-out, we create a rule to apply 
weighted average of salary/cap as the adjusted predictor in

respect to performance before and after the buy-out. Since it 
is difficult to measure if a player was initially overpaid 
and/or still overpaid after the buy-out. A striking example is 
of Scott Gomez who received the cap and salary of 
$7,357,143 and $7,500,00 in the 2011-2012 season, while 
receiving $700,00 for cap and salary, after the buy-out. He 
had .289 Points per Game (PPG) in 2011~2012 and .385 
PPG in 2012~2013 season. By having the weighted average 
on production for the years a particular player was bough-
out, it relaxes the noise it would be created in the ratio of 
“bought-out” cap/salary vs. production. The formulas for 
League Relative Cap and Salary (shortened for Sal) are,

where   indicates a particular player on a team.  
 
The advantage of League-Relative Salary Percentage is that 
each NHL season is treated as an independent economy as a 
whole.  
B. League Adjusted Salary Model 
With League-Relative Percentages, we compare two 
methods: 
Linear 
Regression 
and 
Local 
Polynomial 
Regression Modeling on Production vs. League-Relative 
Percentages. The results of the comparison in Section III 
will show why linear regression is insufficient for modeling 
Salaries and Cap, and need a more flexible methods that is 
capable of modeling general nonlinear relationship [2]. 
For the predictors, we utilize Points Per 60 Minutes 
(P60), Offensive Zone Start Relative % (OZS%), Unblocked 
Shot Attempt Relative % (USAT Rel%), and Time on Ice 
(TOI), as they are the modern day go-to-metrics for 
evaluating a player’s game, in addition to the two traditional 
statistics, Goals and Assists. The number of different 
metrics we compare may not be limited to these six. The 
general model for the linear regression may be represented 
as follows:

where   is desired expected League-Relative Percentages. 
   is the training set of above predictors. For the Local 
Polynomial Regression, we use the traditional tri-cube 
kernel weights [3]:

III. 
CASE STUDY 
In this section, we discuss the procedure of obtaining the 
proper NHL data, and correctly modeling it, by separating 
fixed and random effects.  
A. Data Sources 
The data sources for the two components of the 
proposed model are [4]–[9]. During the research, many data 
sources had to be aggregated and cross validated into a 
single database, since the industry leading [9] ceased its 
operation in 2014. For the League Relative Salary 
Percentage, we utilize statistics beginning with 2010~2011 
season. 
It must be noted that for the purpose of the analysis, we 
make a distinction between Cap and Salary, as they are 
indicators of their monetary compensation, but hold 
different meanings. These two numbers will be treated 
differently, as Cap Space, due to its nature, is uniform 
through the duration of the contract, while the true Salary 
usually changes from year to year and it may trend upwards 
or downwards, depending on age, and whether a player is 
entering his prime or not.  
For production, we gather data exclusively from [4] and 
[5]. In addition to conventional statistics, such as Goals/60 
and Assists/60, we utilize advanced shot metrics to compare 
across different linear regressions and Local Polynomial 
Regression. As previously stated, we utilize Points Per 60 
Minutes (P60), Offensive Zone Start Relative % (OZS%), 
Shot Attempt Relative % (SAT%), and Time on Ice (TOI), 
as initial predictors because they give contextual clues to a 
player’s game. 
Combining the six data sources, we create one data 
frame to help compute League Adjusted Salary Model. The 
final data frame will include two extra columns of 
predictors in League Adjusted Cap Percentage and League 
Adjusted Salary Percentage. The initial plot of the two 
League Adjusted Percentages against USAT Rel% (Figures 
1 and 2) shows that Salary and Cap have different spreads.

Figure 2.  Disbrituion of League Adjusted Salary Percentage over USAT% 
For this particular example in showing the difference in 
spreads, we use the 2014~2015 season data due to its 
availability in salary/cap information, but incompleteness in 
games played. The rest of the paper utilizes only 
2010~2014 season data as training set for the model. 
B. Applications of the Model and its Results 
With the new data frame including League Adjusted 
Salary Percentage, we proceed with Linear Regression and 
Local Polynomial Regression on the proposed Enhanced 
Statistics. Utilizing R package, ‘loess,’ we compute the 
following results.

Tables 1 and 2 display the feature scaled distribution of 
the League Adjusted Cap and Salary Models, respectively. 
Numbers suggest that the Salary Model has wider ranges of 
residuals than the Cap Model. This can be attributed to the 
fact that the cap numbers of a contract are uniform through 
out the duration of the contract, and salaries are often front or 
back-loaded by age, resulting in little changes despite a 
possible improvement or a decline in a player’s performance. 
In accordance to the Residuals and Variances in the tables, 
the plots of the League Adjusted Cap Model (Figure 3) and 
League Adjusted Cap Model (Figure 4) display smooth lines 
with a concave dip in the center. The concavity of the plot is 
the result of players who possess large contracts with high 
variability in statistics across G60, A60, P60, OZS%, SAT, 
and TOI.

Tables 3 and 4 are the direct results (coefficient 
estimates, standard errors, R-squared) of the Linear 
Regression and Local Polynomial Regression on the 
Enhanced statistics vs. League Adjusted Cap and Salaries. 
Standard Errors of all the estimates are negligibly small. 
There exist many counterintuitive results from the League 
Adjusted Salary Model. As can be seen in Tables 5 and 6, 
Time on Ice has the strongest R-squared value at .3379 and 
.3325 for both Salary and Cap. This may suggest that 
despite any type of production, Time on Ice is the most 
likely determining factor contract signings. What may be 
surprising is that the next highest determining factor of 
salary is the P60. In modern Enhanced Statistics, USAT Rel 
% is generally accepted as better indication of a player’s 
ability than P60. However, this result may shows that 
perhaps obvious numbers in production are more valued in 
contract signing than, possession numbers (USAT Rel %). 
In addition, as evident by near-0 Residuals for the 
random effect (Teams), the team association has zero impact 
on the salary itself. In other words, given a set of on-ice 
production, you will not be paid higher or lower by playing 
on a certain team.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The League Adjusted Salary Model proposed in this 
paper is not just a predictive model to gauge a player’s 
potential salary. As discovered through this analysis, with 
the weighting the bought-out players, and by deriving the 
League-Relative Salary Percentage, we can create a 
meaningful training set for which a plethora of statistical 
models, not limited to Local Polynomial Regression 
Modeling, may be applied. While this model is at an early 
stage with comparisons of only six advanced statistics as 
dependent variables, with expanded parameters and caution, 
League Adjusted Salary Model has the potential to become 
a powerful tool in analyzing sports economics. 
There are many possible areas of improvements to 
League Adjusted Salary Model. As is the case in most 
statistical analyses, it is possible to improve the underlying 
statistical model. While we incorporated Local Polynomial 
Regression Modeling to account for standard error in Linear 
Regression, a more advanced modeling technique could be 
applied to better fit the data and reduce errors. Another area 
of improvement could be within the data itself. There were 
assumptions made in the data and methodology that may be 
deemed unnecessary in the hockey analytics community. 
Incorporating more independent variables, such as age and 
nationality may result in a better training set for the League 
Adjusted Salary Model. Inclusion of goalies in a much more 
complicated model is due next. An examination of previous 
lockout years such as the 2004 NHL Lockout may be 
another relevant area of research. Finally, valuation of 
contract clauses, such as No Trade Clause (NTC) was 
ignored for this paper. The author believes that these issues 
could have a significant impact in salary models to come.
