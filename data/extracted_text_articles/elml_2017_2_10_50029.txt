Abstract—A number of E-learning models have been proposed 
in the literature capturing critical success factors of E-learning 
in an attempt to denote how E-learning can be made effective 
to achieve the best learning outcomes. In fact, E-learning has 
redefined the way education is dispensed across the world. It is 
viewed as a modern, effective and efficient alternative to 
education for a number of reasons including an alternate 
means to cater for the increasing demand for higher education 
and to cater for the increasing expectations to make the 
learning process more customised to learners’ needs to 
achieved the best learning outcomes. The concept of Web 3.0 is 
often associated with the Semantic Web, which is a recent 
effort to make the Web more meaningful to machines. In fact, 
the Semantic Web is seen as a promising technology to meet E-
learning requirement. Consequently, this study represents an 
attempt to provide a holistic representation of E-learning 
critical success factors as well as Semantic Web characteristics. 
The study proposes a combined E-learning and Semantic Web 
model, E-learning 3.0, derived from the literature review 
outlining 
four 
main 
characteristics 
namely 
Content 
Management, 
Teaching 
and 
Learning, 
Support 
and 
Technology.  It focuses on two of these characteristics namely 
Content Management and Support, which are further analysed 
via surveys conducted within the Mauritian higher educational 
sector from students and lecturers. Results following an 
exploratory factor analysis on the 2 dimensions surveyed 
provided a regrouping of their sub characteristics allowing for 
a more integrated representation of these characteristics 
within the combined model.

 INTRODUCTION 
In the research and development world, there is 
great stress upon the need to develop educational models 
that will meet the expectations of the higher-education 
community where effective learning occurs with the best 
outcomes. In fact, over recent years, more emphasis is given 
to the development of education systems that involve 
intelligent technologies and the World Wide Web [11]. With 
the need to make the learning process faster with well 
organised learning materials specific to learners‟ needs as 
well as customised online services initiated by user profiles, 
efforts are now being directed in building 3.0 E-learning 
systems in line with the Semantic Web [15]. 
As the name suggests, the Semantic Web aims to 
add a level of meaning to the Web so that it can be more 
easily manipulated by computer programs, and thereby used 
more effectively by humans [23]. In fact, the semantic web 
is about adapting content to specific users where instead of 
having to search a long list of web sites for the required 
information, users have access to a customised file where 
the content is translated, personalised and adapted to meet 
specific needs [1]. It encompasses efforts to build a new 
WWW architecture that enhances content with formal 
semantics, which enables better possibilities for navigating 
through the web and accessing its contents [22].  
As a matter of fact, the static approach to learning 
content limits the willingness of many people to use 
information and communication technologies to learn [29]. 
Expectations with regards to E-learning  lie in having a 
learning process which is timely and efficient capturing the 
needs for suitable learning content, as well as a mechanism 
to organise learning materials based on learner‟s needs and 
pace [22]. The concept of Web 3.0 is often associated with 
the Semantic Web and is seen as having the potential to 
improve the semantics interoperability for e-learning 
components and as such provide the best capabilities for 
learning content composition and access [35]. Central to this 
is the use of ontologies which is the backbone of the 
Semantic Web. Ontologies allow for learning domains to be 
described from different perspectives allowing for a richer 
description and retrieval of contents [7].  
In an effort to remain competitive and maintain 
their market share, many traditional higher education 
institutions  are offering web-based or web supplemented 
learning to compete with the growing number of virtual 
higher education institutions[25]. As such, E-learning is 
carving its way as an alternate medium of course delivery in 
many countries including Mauritius which aims to be the 
centre of excellence in education, attracting international 
universities and students from all over the region. In fact, in 
the wake of being a digital island, Mauritius regroups all the 
necessary ingredients in fostering E-learning as an 
alternative mode to traditional method of teaching [34]. 
However, one of the biggest drawbacks of the current 
17

educational system in the country is the under utilisation of 
technologies to enhance learning. E-learning platforms in 
Mauritius are usually used as means of delivery information 
on the Internet in static ways [34]. With internal university 
politics, omnipresent technological transformations in 
education and Government policies to democratise tertiary 
education, tertiary institutions, particularly public ones, are 
forced to reconsider the traditional class room delivery 
model and the roles that educators and learners play in the 
learning environment [33]. Undeniably, Mauritius is no 
exception to the growing need for post secondary education.  
With limited capacity of existing classrooms at academic 
institutions and the prohibitive cost of building new 
facilities, E-Learning is an attractive alternative [27]. In line 
with the aim to become a knowledge based economy, E-
learning is seen as part of the solution in converting the 
island into a knowledge hub, complementing educational 
infrastructure needs, widening access and eliminating 
distance barriers and promoting a student centered learning 
environment [34]. 
With the numerous benefits that E-learning could 
bring to countries like Mauritius coupled with Semantic 
Web technology, which is seen as a promising technology to 
meet E-learning requirements, this paper aims to look at 
current literature and provide an overview of E-Learning 
critical success factors (CSFs) and Semantic Web 
characteristics in a combined 3.0 E-learning model. The 
paper will then empirically validate two characteristics 
outlined from the proposed 3.0 E-learning model namely 
Content Management and Support through surveys 
conducted within tertiary institutions in Mauritius. Section 
II of the paper describes the initial proposed model based on 
existing literature, Section III outlines the research 
methodology followed by the survey analysis of the 
characteristics Content Management and Support in Section 
IV. The paper ends with the conclusion and directions for 
future explorations in Section V.  
II. 
INITIAL PROPOSED 3.0 E-LEARNING MODEL  
A comprehensive literature search and review 
clearly revealed that E-learning CSFs which are relevant to 
the Semantic Web are often omitted or seldom integrated 
into existing 3.0 E-learning models. In an attempt to provide 
a holistic representation of a 3.0 E-learning model based on 
the combined characteristics of the Semantic Web and E-
learning CSFs, an initial 3.0 E-learning model is proposed in 
Fig. 1 as an effort to synthesize existing literature review on 
E-Learning CSFs and Semantic Web characteristics. It seeks 
to capture the most prominent set of E-learning CSFs and 
Semantic Web characteristics derived from the literature 
review. However, for any E-learning system to be effective, 
users‟ perceptions and needs must be taken into 
consideration. As a result, this review cannot be claimed to 
be exhaustive. In order to ensure that the new model meets 
the needs and expectations of higher education E-learning 
users, namely students and lecturers, the model needs to be 
evaluated.  For this purpose, the proposed 3.0 E-learning 
model is evaluated within the higher education sector in 
Mauritius. It consists of four main characteristics which are 
further broken down into a number of sub characteristics as 
follows. 
A. Content Management consisting of: Content Creation,  
Content Retrieval, Content Reuse and Knowledge 
Representation 
A systematic approach to managing knowledge is 
considered to be an essential pre-requisite for knowledge 
seekers to access relevant learning materials as and when 
required [16]. In fact, the prevalence of materials and 
resources to support the learning settings is deemed as 
critical to the success of online delivery strategies within 
higher education institutions [32].  As such, content 
management, which refers to the access, manipulation and 
maintenance of learning content, is seen as a key 
characteristic for 3.0 E-learning [31]. Central to this is the 
creation and retrieval of learning materials based on their 
degree of difficulty and knowledge levels of students. 
Furthermore, the Semantic Web is seen as an opportunity to 
enhance learning content descriptions via the use of 
ontologies, which provide a formal representation of 
learning content allowing for better conditions for 
composing and reusing learning materials [12][30].  
B. Teaching and Learning consisting of: Curriculum, 
Pedagogy, Personalised Learning and Collaboration 
According 
to 
[17], 
well-designed 
courses, 
curriculums and learning materials are key factors that 
influence learning performance. He further stated that that 
the structure and coherence of the curriculum components 
and of the learning material are major factors for facilitating 
meaningful learning.  Additionally, personalised learning 
where students are provided with learning content which 
meet their specific needs and motivations as well as 
knowledge and skills level based on their particular learning 
and cognitive styles, is considered key to the success of E-
learning environments [11]. Reference [4] further stated that 
productive learning outcomes are most likely to occur when 
learners perceive that their actual learning environment 
matches their preferred learning environment.  In fact, 
according to [10], E-learning is concerned with ensuring 
learners‟ learning goals are met, synchronous and 
asynchronous 
communications 
occur, 
as 
well 
as 
collaboration between learners and instructors. The 
Semantic web is seen to further support teaching and 
learning, allowing students to determine their learning 
agenda and be in control of their learning [8]. 
C. Support consisting of: Instructional Support, Systems 
Support, Organisational Support and Government 
Support 
According to [27], the success of E-learning in 
higher education is a shared responsibility between e-
learning stakeholders.  Students, lecturers, educational 
18

institutions and the Government have key roles to play in 
the success of E-learning. In fact, organisational support is 
identified as a critical success factor for E-learning success 
in the literature review [14][36][38]. Reference [28] stated 
that successful implementation of e-learning requires the 
same management commitment as other mission-critical, 
university-wide initiatives. This includes the right teaching 
and learning support to lecturers and students  to faciliate 
online learning acceptance and the necessary technical 
infrastructure and  technical to support the E-learning 
environment. Students should be provided with the 
resources to develop and enhance their skills and knowledge 
of online learning management systems in terms of  timely 
feedback on learning progress, appropriate online learning 
tools such as FAQs, discussion forums, emails and 
collaboration among peers [2] [20]. Similarly, lecturers 
should be provided with the support needed to allow for the 
shift in mindset and skillset necessary to perform effectively 
in an online learning environment [32]. It is even argued 
that the perception of how one is supported within an E-
learning environment contributes significantly to its success 
[20]. In addition, especially in developing countries, such as 
Mauritius where public tertiary institutions rely a lot on 
Government‟s funding,  political backing and support from 
policy makers are essential [3]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Initial proposed 3.0 E-learning model.
D. Technology consisting of: IT Infrastructure, Usability 
and Accessibility and Semantic Web 
The acceptance of E-learning depends a lot on the 
efficient and effective use of Information Technology [5]. A 
reliable IT infrastructure capable of supporting online 
delivery is considered as a critical success factor for E-
learning [14]. Systems usability and accessibility are key as 
systems users, especially students, will not care about 
didactics as long as as they can find the information they are 
looking for and their needs are satisfied [16]. The interface 
design as well as the ease of navigation and consistency in 
the manner that the online learning environment is presented 
and organised play vital roles in fostering a friendly and less 
intimidating learning environment [5]. In addition, the E-
learning environment can be further enhanced by Semantic 
Web technologies where personal profile of students 
including previous knowledge and experience, preferred 
learning styles and educational goals can facilitate semantic 
web retrieval of content to allow for best individuals 
learning experiences. Semantic Web technologies through 
the use of ontologies can provide well structured databases 
to allow better knowledge handling by machines opening 
the gate to a learner centered learning environment which 
promotes collaboration, reuse and where learners can 
manage their own learning content [2]. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
Two web-based surveys were conducted to gather the 
perceptions of students and lecturers on the initial proposed 
3.0 E-learning model. One survey was directed towards 
students from the Mauritian higher education sector and one 
19

eLmL 2017 : The Ninth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

was directed towards lecturers of the Mauritian higher 
education sector.  Web-based surveys have several 
advantages including short response time, lower cost to the 
researcher(s), instant access to the audience irrespective of 
their geographical location, better design options, speed and 
accuracy of data collection and immediate access to results 
in different formats [6] [18] [39]. However, there have been 
concerns about the reponse rate of web-based surveys which 
is highly dependent on Internet and email technology as 
well as participants characteristics [37]. Bearing these in 
mind and looking at the target participants for this study, 
namely students and lecturers from Mauritian higher 
education institutions, web-based surveys were considered 
as appropriate.  
The development of the survey required a thorough 
understanding and accurate interpretation of E-Learning 
CSFs and the Semantic Web characteristics from the 
literature review. The surveys‟ questions were then based on 
the characteristics identified in the initial proposed model as 
per Fig. 1 in order to gather the perceptions of Mauritian 
students and lecturers on these characteristics.  
In order to collect a sample that represents the 
point of view of Mauritian higher education students and 
lecturers, a research agency in Mauritius was contacted to 
distribute the survey. The respective links of the surveys 
were distributed to students and lecturers  from both public 
and private tertiary institutions via emails. With the 
response rate of web-based surveys also dependent on the 
number of contacts made to participants, participation rate 
was monitored and follow ups emails were sent to 
participants to ensure as many responses as possible 
[24][21].The data collection process was anonymous. 
Participants provided consent before moving to the next part 
of the survey by reading the Informed Consent form. The 
fom clearly stated that by completing the survey, they are 
consenting to participate. 
Both surveys were structured in a simple manner  
and consisted of different types of questions including 
multiple choice questions, five-point Likert scale questions 
and free text  boxes. Participants were provided with a brief 
explanation of each section at the beginning of each section.  
Section one of both surveys captured general 
information about participants‟ demographics. Each of the 
characteristics in the proposed model had a dedicated 
section to it with a number of statements using a five point 
likert scale to determine how strongly participants agree or 
disagree with the statements. The scale ranged from one to 
five and consisted of the following values: Strongly Agree, 
Agree, Neutral, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree with a „5‟ 
representing the participant strongly agree with the 
statement and a „1‟ representing the participant strongly 
disagree with the statement. At the end of each section, 
participants were given the option to write any comments 
regarding each section should they wish to do so via a free 
text box.

SPSS software version 22.0 was used to analyse 
the surveys‟ results. Exploratory factor analysis was used to 
“explore the underlying dimensions of a construct” in order 
to ensure a more consistent interpretation of data from the 
original groupings in the proposed model [9]. To ensure the 
appropriateness of factor analysis for this study, the Kaiser-
Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) and the 
Bartlett‟s test of sphericity which examines if variables are 
related were used [13] [26]. KMO recommends a minimum 
of 0.5 while the Bartlett‟s test of sphericity is significant 
when p = .05 or smaller [19]. The KMO for statements

related to Content Management and Support characteristics 
are outlined in Table II. The KMO results met the minimum 
standards required for both groups although Content 
Management seemed to be a concept more familiar to 
lecturers as compared to students. The Bartlett‟s tests were 
significant for both characterisics and groups. Factor 
analysis was therefore deemed appropriate for this study.

With these initial tests and findings, factor 
extraction was then performed on both characteristics to 
determine the smallest number of factors that can be used to 
best represent the interrelationships among the set of 
variables [19]. Kaiser‟s criterion  where only factors with an 
eigen value greater than 1.0 was then used to determined the 
number of factors to be retained [19].  
For Content Management for both the lecturer‟s 
and the student‟s survey, there were 2 components with 
eigenvalues greater than 1; these 2 components accounted 
for 57 %  (lecturer‟s survey) and  62%  (student‟s survey) of 
the total variance of the data set.  Similarly, for Support, 2 
components accounted for 54 %  (lecturer‟s survey) and  
57%  (student‟s survey) of the total variance of the data set.  
To assist further in the analysis of these 2 characterisitcs, 
Varimax rotation method, a widely used orthogonal method 
which attempts to minimise the number of variables by 
keeping the high loadings variables for each factor, was then 
used to determine which factors loaded on each of the 
dimensions [9][19]. 
With respect to Content Management, for the 
lecturers‟ survey, the items that cluster on the same 
components suggest that component 1 represented Content 
Relevance 
and 
Responsibility 
while 
component 
2 
represented  Content Representation. As for the students‟ 
survey, component 1 was very much related to that of the 
lecturers‟ survey and was termed as Content Relevance and 
Accessibility while component 2 was termed Content 
Responsibility 
. 
Based 
on 
these 
results, 
Content 
Management was reviewed to include Content Relevance, 
Content Accessibility, Content Responsibility and Content 
Representation as per Table III  and Table IV.

Figure 2.  Revised Content Management and Support characteristics. 
As for Support, for both surveys, factor loadings 
after rotation showed clustering on component 1 to 
represent  the types of support expected and therefore  
renamed as Type of Support. Component 2 for both surveys 
converged towards the idea of who should  be providing the 
support and was renamed as Stakeholders‟ Support. Table V 
and Table VI outline the factors for Support chactacterisitcs. 
The revised Content Management and Support 
Characteristics are shown in Fig 2. For Content 
Management, the resulting factors Content Relevance and 
Content Responsibility were derived from both the students‟ 
and lecturers‟ surveys while Content Accessibility and 
Content Representation were factors derived from the 
students‟ and lecturers‟ surveys respectively. The Support 
characteristic consists of Types of Support and stakeholders‟ 
Support resulting from analysis of both students‟ and 
lecturers‟ survey.  Table VII provides a summary of the 
factors derived , clearly outlining factors common to both 
surveys‟ analysis.  
To examine the internal reliability of each 
dimension, Cronbach alpha was calculated on the 2 
dimensions resulting in alpha coefficients of 0.737 and 
0.778 respectively indicating sufficient level of reliability. 
Based on these results, it can be concluded that these two 
dimensions namely Content Management and Support 
represents different aspects of the 3.0 E-learning model.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Higher educational institutions are required to 
understand the critical success factors affecting E-learning

to be able to make the best use of the Internet. With 
Semantic web technologies viewed as a promising 
technology to meet E-learning requirements, the need for a 
combined model capturing the CSFs of E-learning as well 
as the main characteristics of the Semantic Web is deemed 
necessary.  
This study is significant because it proposed a 
combined model representing the CSFs of E-learning with 
the Semantic web, namely a 3.0 E-learning model. The 
study identified four main characteristics within the 
proposed 3.0 E-learning model and provided empirical 
evidence and indicative support of the importance of two of 
these characteristics namely Content Management and 
Support.  This study additionally provided a deeper analysis 
of Content Management and Support characteristics via 
exploratory factor analysis further regrouping the sub 
characteristics of these two dimensions to provide a more 
holistic view of what they represent within the model.  
In terms of future directions, since the results of 
this study are based on survey outcomes from Mauritian 
Higher educational sector, they can be further assessed by 
interviewing experts in E-learning within the Mauritian 
higher educational sector. Future research should also aim to 
generalise these results to consider other environments and 
countries. Additionally, more characteristics and sub 
characteristics can be added to the E-Learning and Semantic 
Web Combined Model, as well as new groupings can be 
made following further analysis.  
ACKNOWLEDGMENT 
The authors wish to thank all participants for their useful 
insights on the issue at hand and for taking the time to 
participate in the surveys.
