Abstract— The mobile telecommunications services market has 
great relevance in the socioeconomic growth of a country and 
the reduction of the digital divide. However, the high demand 
for these mobile telecommunications services has produced a 
high concentration in this market, which can lead to an 
oligopoly or even a market monopoly. In order to prevent this, 
the state must generate adequate policies for the measurement 
and monitoring of market concentration levels. This article aims 
to 
measure 
concentration 
in 
the 
Colombian 
mobile 
telecommunications market. To achieve the above, the 
databases of mobile internet revenues, traffic, and accesses of 
the telecommunications companies operating in Colombia from 
2012 to 2022, both for postpaid (fixed charge) and prepaid (on 
demand), provided by the Communications Regulatory 
Commission, were used, and through the Linda index, the 
corresponding measurement of the concentration indexes was 
made. In terms of the overall revenue (prepaid plus postpaid) of 
the telecommunications companies, the main result was that, in 
the case of the Colombian mobile telecommunications services 
market, there is a moderate concentration.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The mobile telecommunication services market is moving 
in increasingly flexible and adaptable environments to the 
customers' needs. In addition, there is a bandwidth increase 
due to the emergence of various services and applications on 
mobile internet, increasing the volume of data sales and 
becoming a solid source of income for Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs). As a result, competition among ISPs to 
maintain and attract new customers to their businesses is 
increasing significantly, and they are forced to analyze the 
quality of service and experience to improve interaction with 
their customers. However, the providers' interest lies in 
keeping these customers and increasing the volume of 
consumption of their services [1][2].  
Studies have been carried out to analyze the current state 
of the mobile telecommunications market in Latin American 
countries and show the need for elements such as adequate 
spectrum management and alignment with established 
policies on telecommunications services. As a result of these 
studies, the concentration analysis in these markets is 
identified as a central point of study to improve 
competitiveness and reduce the digital divide, facilitating 
regional development and identifying potential investments. It 
is determined that countries that allocate greater bandwidth 
and achieve more competitive market structures obtain a 
greater amount of demonstrable social benefits. Countries 
such as Mexico have initiated this task, and the analysis of the 
spectrum, its allocation, and management is included among 
the essential variables as a relevant topic of study, 
appropriating the lessons of more mature markets [3][4]. 
Globally, it is clear that Information and Communications 
Technologies (ICTs) are a relevant factor leading to 
socioeconomic development and growth in a competitive 
environment that enables countries, companies, and 
individuals to reap the benefits. It has proven to have a great 
impact in areas such as commerce, health, and education, 
provides new job opportunities, and can help people and 
companies to remain competitive by running their processes 
more efficiently. For example, in Europe, its relevance can be 
seen with the creation of a digital agenda in the Europe 2020 
Strategy that seeks to achieve sustainable and inclusive 
growth for the European economy, which aims to develop a 
digital economy based on knowledge and innovation [5]-[7]. 
A competitive market has various benefits, among which 
good quality, more and better options for goods and services, 
and low prices stand out in favor of the consumer; in favor of 
companies the increase in production, giving a boost to the 
economy in general. According to the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Economic 
Outlook published in June 2020, global activity is projected to 
fall by 6% this year. Likewise, global unemployment rose 
from 5.4% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2020, all this under the 
assumption that there is no additional crisis due to the 
COVID-19 contagions. On the other hand, the World 
Economic Forum estimates that foreign direct investment will 
fall between 30% and 40% globally. 
This article aims to measure the concentration in the 
Colombian mobile telecommunications market. To achieve 
this, we used the databases of mobile internet revenues, traffic, 
and accesses of the telecommunications companies operating 
in Colombia from 2012 to 2022, both for postpaid (fixed 
charge) and prepaid (on demand), provided by the 
Communications Regulation Commission (CRC), and 
through Linda's index we measured the corresponding 
concentration indexes. 
The structure of this paper is as follows: section II provides 
a description of mobile telecommunications services market 
in Colombia. Section III presents the Linda index. Section IV 
describes the methodology used. Section V presents the

results of the measuring concentration in the mobile 
telecommunications services market in Colombia. Section VI 
presents the results analysis. Finally, section VII presents the 
conclusions.  
II. MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES MARKET IN 
COLOMBIA 
Based on figures presented during the third quarter of 2022 
by the Ministry of Information and Communication 
Technologies (MinTIC), the total number of mobile Internet 
accesses in Colombia reached 39.1 million, 3.4 million more 
than those registered in the same quarter of the previous year, 
as shown in Figure 1 [8]. 
Until September 2022, the provider with the largest 
number of mobile Internet accesses was Claro (20.6 million), 
followed by Movistar (8.9 million), TIGO (6.8 million), and 
WOM (1.7 million), as shown in Figure 2 [8].

Figure 2. The number of mobile providers accessed by providers [8] 
 
 
At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the principal mobile 
internet access technology in subscription mode was 4G, with 
32.9 million accesses, while, with a downward trend, 3G 
technology has 5.4 million and 2G registers 0.9 million 
accesses, as shown in Figure 3 [8]. In Figure 3, a greater 
tendency to use the 4G technology network can be observed, 
largely due to the advantages that better technology brings.

During the third quarter of 2022, operating revenues in 
Colombian pesos for prepaid and postpaid modality, 
excluding taxes, produced by the provision of mobile 
telephony service were close to $ 400 billion for postpaid and 
$ 163 billion for prepaid, as shown in Figure 4 [8]. Figure 4 
shows a higher level of income from the postpaid modality 
than from the prepaid modality; this is because the prepaid 
modality works on demand and it is generally people with low 
economic resources who take this modality.

III. CONCENTRATION INDEX 
The concentration index of a market shows the number of 
participants and their position in it. In effect, the concentration 
index will be higher the smaller the number of participants in 
said market and the more unequal their participations are. 
Concentration was measured using three of the most 
widely used indexes in the global telecommunications market: 
the Stenbacka dominance index, the Herfindahl-Hirschman 
index (HHI), and the Linda index. The results obtained with 
the Linda index are described in this paper. 
 
A. Linda Index 
This indicator is usually used to measure the possible 
existence of oligopoly and inequality between different 
market shares. Moreover, similar to the concentration ratio, it 
is calculated for a number n of leading companies in the 
12

market so that their joint relative incidence can be calculated 
about the rest of the participants at that end of the market 
(supply or demand); mathematically, this indicator can be 
defined as shown in (1) [9][10]. 
 
𝐿𝐿 =

𝑁𝑁(𝑁𝑁 − 1) ෍ 𝑋𝑋𝚤𝚤ഥ
𝑋𝑋ത𝑁𝑁−𝑖𝑖
𝑁𝑁−1
𝑖𝑖=1
 
(1) 
 
Where 𝑋𝑋ത𝑖𝑖 is the average market share of the first i firms, 
and 𝑋𝑋ത𝑁𝑁−𝑖𝑖 is the average market share of the remaining firms. 
This indicator presents values between zero and infinity, 
where values close to zero are obtained for markets with low 
concentration, and higher values (greater than one) represent 
highly concentrated markets (see Table I) [9][10].

Very High

Low concentration implies high market competitiveness; 
high concentration implies low competitiveness; and a very 
high concentration implies the presence of a monopoly or 
oligopoly. 
B. Stenbacka Dominance Index 
The Stenbacka index is defined as a dominance threshold 
based on the shares of the two hugest companies in the market. 
The value of the Stenbacka index estimates a threshold above 
which the leading firm could have market power; equation (2) 
calculates this threshold.

Where: 
S1 and S2 correspond to the market share of the two 
market largest companies, with 0 ≤ Si ≤ 1.  
γ ≥ 0 is a given parameter obtained from the particular 
characteristics of each market, such as entry barriers and 
regulations to motivate competition. 
C. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (IHH) 
The HHI is represented by the sum of the squares of the 
shares of the companies in the market, as described in 
equation (3).

Where:

terms.  
IV. METHODOLOGY 
Initially, data corresponding to the analysis variables were 
obtained, such as traffic, revenue, and accesses, for prepaid 
and postpaid, corresponding to each telecommunications 
company that operated in Colombia from 2012 to September 
2022 (inclusive). This information was obtained from the 
post-data database of the Communications Regulation 
Commission [11]. Subsequently, an organization of the data 
was performed in Excel to create a database with the 
information of interest organized chronologically. In the end, 
nine databases were obtained: (1) fixed charge mobile internet 
demand traffic (postpaid); (2) fixed charge mobile internet 
demand revenues (postpaid); (3) fixed charge mobile internet 
demand accesses (postpaid); (4) on-demand mobile internet 
demand traffic (prepaid); (5) on-demand mobile internet 
demand revenues (prepaid); (6) on-demand mobile internet 
demand accesses (prepaid); (7) global mobile internet demand 
traffic (postpaid + prepaid); (8) global mobile internet demand 
revenues (postpaid + prepaid); and (9) global mobile internet 
demand accesses (postpaid + prepaid). 
In a subsequent phase, Linda's index was constructed for 
each of the nine databases mentioned above. It was decided to 
calculate this index monthly to obtain more data that would 
allow a future forecast and projection of the concentration 
behavior in the Colombian mobile telecommunications 
market [12]. According to the procedure required to calculate 
Linda's index, it was necessary that for each period (month), 
the telecommunications companies were ordered from highest 
to lowest according to the value of the variable to be analyzed 
(traffic, revenues, or subscribers). 
During the construction of the Linda index, it became 
evident that when any of the companies had a zero value in 
the variable of interest, the Linda index was indeterminate, 
and if it was very close to zero, it increased exponentially. Due 
to the above, it was decided to eliminate the data equal to zero 
since the interpretation of these data is fundamental that the 
company did not operate in that period. Additionally, it was 
decided to eliminate all data less than 50,000 in the traffic and 
revenue databases, both in postpaid and prepaid, and overall, 
since these data produce inconsistent values of the index; the 
amount of data deleted was 36 in total, which gives 
approximately a value of less than 0.4% of the total database.  
The Linda index determines the level of concentration by 
groups of companies from 2 to N-1; for example, if there are 
3 companies, there is only one Linda, since it compares the 
group composed of company 1 and 2, against 3. For the 
months in which more than three companies were operating, 
more than one Linda index was obtained since this index 
compares groups of companies. The first Linda obtained is if 
at least three companies are competing in the market and 
would correspond to Linda 2 (L2); if there are four companies, 
L2 and L3 would be obtained, and so on. In other words, the 
last Linda corresponds to N-2, where N is the number of 
companies competing in the market. Since there are periods 
where up to 14 companies operate simultaneously, Linda 
indexes of up to L12 are obtained, mapping each of them up

would mean an extension of this document. Therefore, it was 
decided to present the L2 Linda index graph for the case of the 
global 
revenue 
(prepaid 
+ 
postpaid) 
of 
each 
telecommunications company, together with a table showing 
the rest of the Linda index values for the corresponding 
scenario. 
V. MEASURING CONCENTRATION IN THE MOBILE 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES MARKET IN COLOMBIA 
Figure 5 describes the behavior of Linda's index 2 for the 
case of the overall (prepaid + postpaid) mobile internet 
revenue of each Colombian telecommunications company 
from 2012 to 2022. Table II shows the other Linda 2 index 
values for the corresponding scenario. 
According to Figure 5, the first two values of Linda's index 
are very high compared to the rest, which show an almost 
uniform trend of low value. The above can be explained by 
the entry into the market of several telecommunications 
companies.

VI. RESULTS ANALYSIS 
The highest value of Linda 2 is given for the global mobile 
internet demand (postpaid + prepaid) revenue with a value of 
21.11 and a standard deviation of 1.85 and for the number of 
subscribers of the global mobile internet demand (postpaid + 
prepaid) with a value of 20.72 and a standard deviation of 
2.49. On the other hand, the lowest value of Linda is given for 
global traffic with a value of 0.067 and a standard deviation of 
0.0499 and for prepaid traffic with a value of 0.073 and a 
standard deviation of 0.111. 
For postpaid mobile Internet demand (fixed charge), the 
Linda index values, on average, are between 0.23 and 0.32, so 
there is a moderate concentration. In the case of prepaid (on-
demand) mobile Internet demand, the Linda index values, on 
average, have differences for the traffic of 0.15, low 
concentration, revenues of 0.26, moderate concentration, and 
the number of subscribers of 0.41, moderate concentration. In 
the overall mobile Internet demand, the Linda index values, 
on average, have higher differences for traffic 0.14, low 
concentration, revenue 0.36, moderate concentration, and 
number of subscribers 0.53, high concentration. However, for 
the case of global revenue, if the first two periods (2012-1 and 
2012-2) are not bearing in mind, the average drops to 0.18, 
which would give a low concentration. 
It is important to emphasize that the Linda 2 index 
compares the group of the two companies with the highest 
value of the variable of interest (traffic, revenues, or 
subscribers) concerning the group of the other companies. In 
some cases, it is possible to present a higher concentration, 
evidenced by the group of the 3 or 4 most dominant companies 
in the market. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
The measurement of concentration in the Colombian 
mobile telecommunications market was carried out using the 
Linda index using as input variables the income, traffic and 
mobile internet access of the telecommunications companies 
operating in Colombia from 2012 to 2022, both for postpaid 
(fixed charge) and prepaid (on demand). 
Linda's values for the global revenue of mobile internet 
demand evidence a high concentration in the first two months, 
but then drops low for the rest of the periods, indicating a high 
competition in this market. In the telecommunications market, 
the problem of concentration is an issue that usually affects 
many countries. However, several countries have addressed 
this problem by increasing the availability of radio spectrum 
and reallocating portions of it; even beyond this, the spectrum 
distribution among mobile operators plays a significant role in 
achieving the goal of a freely competitive market. It has been 
empirically demonstrated that the accumulation of spectrum 
by an operator leads to less competition in the mobile voice 
market, so spectrum management strategies should aim to 
avoid unnecessary spectrum accumulation, seeking to achieve 
balance in the market power of telecommunication services. 
As future work, it is planned to propose a new 
concentration measurement index based on the characteristics 
of the Linda, Stenbacka and Herfindahl-Hirschman indices.
