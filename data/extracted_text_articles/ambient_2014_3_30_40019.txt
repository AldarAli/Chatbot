Abstract—Older adults have a growing desire to remain 
independent and age in their own home environment. Policy 
makers support this wish, as the quality and quantity of 
institutional care cannot be guaranteed with the present health 
care budget. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies can 
meet the interests of both parties, by facilitating healthy and 
active aging in the home environment. However, those 
technologies are still in their infancy and the likelihood of their 
adoption remains uncertain. By conducting a literature study 
and a user-requirement study for a conceptual AAL 
application called SONOPA (Social Networks for Older Adults 
to Promote an Active Life), benefits and barriers to the 
adoption of AAL technologies, as perceived by the elderly user, 
were identified. The user-requirement study consisted of focus 
groups and interviews with older adults and elder care 
professionals, conducted in the UK, France and Belgium. 
Together, the literature study and the user-requirement study 
led to several design guidelines which direct the future 
development 
process 
of 
SONOPA 
and 
related 
AAL 
applications.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Worldwide`the proportion of elderly people is increasing. 
With 18.2% of the population being 65 years or older in 
2013, Europe has one of the highest shares of elderly people 
in the world [1]. It is expected that this proportion will rise to 
almost 30% by 2050 [2]. This goes along with a sharp 
increase in the old-age dependency ratio, meaning that the 
number of potential recipients of health and pension funds 
rises (65 years and older), while the number of potential 
providers of funds belonging to the working age population 
(15-64 years), continues to decline [2][3]. While global aging 
can be considered as a great accomplishment of today’s 
socially and technologically advanced culture, it creates 
immense challenges for governments in terms of healthcare 
regulations, pension schemes and state budgets [2].  
To meet these challenges the concept of AAL was 
introduced. AAL is an umbrella term for innovative 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based 
products, services and systems which support healthy and 
active aging at home, the community and at work [4]. By 
promoting a healthy and autonomous lifestyle, AAL 
technologies meet both the elderly people’s desire to remain 
independent and age in place and the demand for controlling 
healthcare cost [5][6]. 
Despite the fact that AAL technologies offer a promising 
perspective on successful aging, the likelihood of adoption of 
those technologies remains uncertain [7]. Usability problems 
[6][8], the lack of perceived benefits [5][7][9] and 
technology self-efficacy [7][10] can form, among other 
factors, severe barriers to technology adoption among elderly 
people. In our view, this heightens the need for a user-
centered approach when designing AAL technologies, to 
access the wishes and needs of the intended user and identify 
potential benefits and barriers at an early stage of 
development. 
The presented work is part of the SONOPA project [11] 
which is carried out in the framework of the AAL Joint 
Programme. The aim of the SONOPA project is to employ a 
set of available ICTs for stimulating and supporting activities 
at home. Various sensors and behavior modelling techniques 
will be used to generate a personal activity profile of the 
elderly user and track variations in the daily activities over 
time. When the user’s activity level is low, the system will 
provide a recommendation, suggesting individual activities 
or social interactions with peers. SONOPA seeks to 
empower elderly people to stay active, independent and 
socially involved in their home environment, so to maintain 
their psychological and physical well-being. The work 
described in this paper was carried out in the first year of the 
project to access the perceptions and needs of the user at an 
early stage of development. Results are used for the further 
development of the SONOPA technology over the remaining 
two years of the project life span.  
In this paper, several design guidelines for AAL 
technologies are identified. Findings are based on both 
insights from a literature study and a user-requirement study 
conducted as part of the SONOPA project. Section II and 
Section III provide an overview of the literature study with 
regard to the perceived benefits and perceived barriers of 
assisted living technologies. The user-requirement study 
points out to what degree benefits and barriers could be 
supported by our user data. Results are described in Section 
IV. Together, these insights led to several design guidelines 
which are directive for the future development process of 
SONOPA and related AAL applications. These guidelines 
are described in Section V. Section VI provides a general 
conclusion and implications for the future development 
process of the SONOPA system and related AAL 
technologies.

PERCEIVED BENEFITS  
To get an insight in the perceived benefits and barriers of 
AAL technologies, relevant literature about AAL and related 
technology applications designed for the purpose of healthy 
and active aging in place was reviewed. We searched several 
scientific databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google 
Scholar) with keywords such as ‘older adult’, ‘assistive 
technology’, 
‘(ambient) 
assisted 
living’, 
‘robots’ 
‘monitoring’, ‘independent’, ‘adoption’, ‘use’ or synonyms 
of these words. After initial screening of titles and abstracts, 
we included sixteen articles applying the following criteria : 
• 
Peer –reviewed 
• 
English language 
• 
Published between 1999 - 2014 
• 
Systematic review, qualitative study, quantitative 
study or mixed method approach 
• 
Research focusing on the adoption and use of 
technology applications designed for healthy and 
active aging 
 The selected papers studied different AAL applications 
such as in-home sensor technologies, social network 
applications, domestic robots or the more general concept of 
technologies for aging in place (see Table 1).

Several studies tested the assistive device (mostly 
prototypes) in the field. We extracted the perceived benefits 
and barriers of those technologies from the selected papers 
and grouped them into categories. Consequently, six benefit 
and eight barrier categories could be identified. The benefits 
are discussed below. The barriers are discussed in Section 
III.  
A. Independent Living and Aging in Place 
Independent living and aging in place are perceived as 
essential benefits of assisted living technologies [5][12]-[16]. 
Steel, Lo, Secombe, and Wong [5] reported, that 
independence is of utmost importance to elderly people and 
technology which can facilitate autonomous living, is 
perceived as useful. This is contributed by the fact that many 
elderly people have a negative view on nursing homes and 
regard institutionalization as a last resort [5][15]. The desire 
for independence is so strong, that it often supersedes other 
concerns, such as privacy and intrusiveness [16][17].  
B. Health and Safety 
Health and safety are prerequisites for aging in place [15] 
and perceived as important benefits of assisted living 
technologies. Hence, responding to emergencies [5][6][12] 
[13][15][16][18][19]; 
detecting 
and 
preventing 
falls 
[5][6][12][13][15][16][19]; 
and 
monitoring 
medical 
parameters [5][6][12][16][18] are regarded as key features of 
those technologies. Other valued features include property 
security [6][18] and detecting safety hazards, e.g., fire or 
unlocked doors [6][15][18]. Automatic and around-the-clock 
monitoring is viewed as a major advantage of sensor-based 
assistive living technologies in comparison with existing 
solutions, such as an emergency button or a human caregiver 
[5][15]. 
C. Social Involvement 
Another benefit of assisted living technologies concerns 
the improvement of the user’s social involvement. Social 
connectedness has been described as a key element of a good 
quality of life [20][21] and successful aging [22]. In the 
‘Building Bridges’ project [23], elderly people met fellow 
seniors via online calls and chat to discuss a broadcast they 
had commonly listened to. Participants stated that they were 
very keen to arrange real-life meetings and get to know their 
conversations partners. The field trial of the ‘Digital Family 
Portrait’ project, revealed that the female participant felt less 
lonely, knowing a family member was watching over her 
with the help of technology [17].  
D. Support with the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) 
With older age physical, cognitive and sensory 
impairments such as muscle stiffness, memory decline and 
poor vision increase [24]-[27]. Assisted living technologies 
can help elderly people to compensate for these deficits and 
help them with their ADLs. Indeed, Smarr et al. [18] found 
that elderly people would value the assistance of domestic 
robots in helping them with chores such as cleaning, fetching 
objects or reminders, e.g., taking their medicine. With those 
57

tasks robotic assistance is even preferred over human 
assistance. Similarly, Demiris et al. [6] found that older 
adults identify assistance with impairments and a reminder 
function as potential advantages of assisted living 
technologies.  
E. Support Care Network 
Both, informal caregivers and the elderly people 
themselves perceive assisted living technologies as good 
tools to support the care network because they provide some 
piece of mind and reduce the overall burden of family 
caregivers [14]-[17]. With the help of in-home monitoring, 
caregivers can gain a better understanding of the elderly 
person’s well-being, and it allows them to detect functional 
and cognitive decline at an early stage [16][17]. 
F. Education and Leisure 
Opposed to common stereotypes, a good proportion of 
elderly people are still capable of learning new things and is 
still fairly active and productive [28]. In the ‘Building 
Bridges’ Project [23], participants were positive about the 
educational element of the tested device. Several of the 
participants acknowledged that modern technologies could 
help them to develop and share their personal interest with 
others. 
III. 
PERCEIVED BARRIERS 
Besides benefits, eight perceived barriers which could 
interfere with the successful adoption of AAL technologies 
were extracted from the literature study. The insights on 
those barriers are discussed below.  
A. Perceived Need and Perceived Usefulness 
The subjective need and the perceived usefulness of a 
new technology are essential for elderly people to adopt it 
[7][9][14][29]-[31]. Consequently, the lack of subjective 
need and perceived benefits forms a major barrier to 
accepting assisted living technologies [5][14][16][19]. The 
subjective need for assisted living seems to be influenced by 
the elderly person’s perceived well-being in terms of health, 
activity and social involvement. Steele et al. [5] found that 
elderly persons with good social ties were less likely to feel 
the need for such a technology. Greenhalgh et al. [19] 
discovered that their participants saw no value in assistive 
technologies if they had never needed to use it before. 
Zimmer and Chappell [31] indicated that the subjective 
health status stimulated the felt need for a technology which 
can improve the independence. However, many elderly 
people struggle to imagine future deterioration where they 
might benefit from features such as monitoring [16]. This is 
confirmed by Peek et al. [14] who concluded that many 
elderly people talk about a hypothetical older person who 
could benefit from assisted living technology rather than 
themselves. The use of existing technologies, such as an 
emergency button and the help of family members or a 
spouse can also reduce the perceived need for assisted living 
technologies [14]. This is contributed by the fact that many 
elderly people do not fully understand the additional benefits 
assisted living technologies can provide [5][19]. While the 
perceived benefits are more abstract, the concerns related to 
those technologies are very specific [14]. 
B. Privacy, Obstrusiveness and Controle 
Concerns about privacy, security and possible intrusion 
are perceived as important barriers to the adoption of assisted 
living technologies [6][12][14][19][23]. Elderly people are 
worried that their personal information can get in the wrong 
hands and be misused. Some are reluctant to the monitoring 
aspect of assisted living technologies, as it feels like 
surveillance to them. Especially the use of cameras, is 
strongly rejected [6][12]. In contrast, some studies find that 
privacy is just a minor concern to their elderly participants 
[5][15][16]. They regard some loss of their privacy as a valid 
trade-off for their safety, independence and health. Another 
reason could be the lack of awareness of potential security 
risks.  
The 
perceived 
obtrusiveness 
of 
assisted 
living 
technologies is another concern which is voiced by the 
elderly target group [5][14][15][19][23]. They are worried 
that technologies are too visible in their home environment, 
and could interfere with their normal routine. Indeed, some 
participants in the study by Van Hoof, Kort, Rutten and 
Duijnstee [15] complained about visible cables, annoying 
sounds and interference with other devices, such as the TV.  
Finally, the level of user control is a matter of concern to 
the elderly user. Most elderly people want to have some level 
of control about the technology, e.g., turn it off manually. 
Consequently, the lack of user control is perceived as a 
barrier [5][14][16]. On the other hand, some elderly people 
argue that a monitoring system cannot assure safety, unless it 
is switched on all the time. Emergencies could happen when 
the system is switched off or when users forget to switch it 
back on [5]. A low level of user-control would also be more 
suitable for people who are not very confident in interacting 
with technologies [6]. 
C. Lack of experience, technology anxiety and self efficacy  
Several elderly people are apprehensive towards 
technology and worry about their abilities concerning 
technology use [5]-[7][14][15][23][29]. They perceive 
technology to be very complex and inaccessible for elderly 
people who miss the necessary skills and experience. Ease of 
use and making mistakes when interacting with the 
technology, are major concerns. However, some of them are 
willing to undertake training and believe that this knowledge 
could make the interaction with the technology easier [5].  
D. Social Stigma  
A social stigma is also identified as a potential barrier to 
the acceptance of assisted living technologies [5][6][14][19]. 
Many elderly people are hesitant to use technologies which 
could stigmatize them as frail or needing assistance. Some 
admit to be ashamed of wearing existing solutions, such as a 
panic button and wanted sensor systems to be as discreet and 
unobtrusive as possible. The concern about the social 
stigmatization seemed to be especially prevalent for female 
seniors [5].

E. Reliability 
Many elderly people worry about the reliability of 
assisted living technologies and question the accuracy and 
ability of those technologies in ensuring the health and safety 
of the user, compared to a human caregiver [5][6][14][15]. 
Indeed, several participants in an earlier study reported false 
emergency alarms when using an assisted living technology 
application [15]. 
F. Lack of Human Interaction 
The lack of human interaction is also a matter of concern 
to the elderly target group. They think that assisted living 
technologies cannot and should not replace human assistance 
and human interaction [5][6][32]. Indeed, Smarr et al. [18] 
revealed that while robot assistance is accepted for certain 
tasks, human assistance is preferred for personal care tasks 
(e.g., wash hair), leisure activities (e.g., playing games) and 
most health related tasks (decide which medication to take). 
Van Hoof et al. [15] found that the video-call feature of their 
assisted living application was hardly used and did not help 
to improve the user’s social connectedness or loneliness. 
Steele et al. [5] found that the elderly participants rejected 
the suggestion to incorporate social aspects in an in-home 
monitoring application as they did not believe this could 
impact their social life. 
G. Cost 
Another barrier concerns the cost of assisted living 
technologies [5][6][14][32]. Several elderly people have 
stated that, due to their limited income, such systems would 
either not be affordable to them, or they would not to be 
willing to spend a lot of money on such technologies. Elderly 
people also mentioned that cost should be subsidized by the 
government. 
H. Health Concerns 
Finally, the last barrier regards health concerns. Several 
elderly people worry that electromagnetic radiation caused 
by wireless sensors could cause health problems [5][14]. 
IV. 
USER-REQUIREMENT STUDY 
To evaluate the perceived benefits and barriers identified 
from the literature study in the context of the SONOPA 
technology, a user-requirement study with older adults and 
elder care professionals was conducted. 
A. Method 
Three focus groups (UK: n = 8; FR: n = 5; BE: n = 9) and 
semi-structured interviews (n = 21) were conducted in the 
UK, France and Belgium. In total, 28 older adults aged 
between 55 and 86 (M = 71.36, SD = 9.45) participated in 
the study. Six older adults participated in both focus-groups 
and in-depth interviews. Of all participants, twelve were 
male and sixteen were female. Nine participants lived on 
their own, while the other participants lived with a partner, 
family members or a friend. The older adults lived 
independently and without the regular help of a formal or an 
informal caregiver. A few seniors depended on their family 
members or external help for certain chores such as cleaning, 
transport, grocery shopping or gardening. The physical well-
being ranged from “perfectly alright” to “I don’t feel myself 
at all at the moment”. However, the majority felt fairly 
healthy. Overall, participants also felt fairly active, ranking 
their own activity level at an average of 7.06 (SD = 2.07) on 
a 10-point scale. Moreover, the majority of the older adults 
felt socially involved, ranking their own level of social 
involvement at an average of 7.32 (SD = 1,59) on a 10-point 
scale. 
The Belgium focus group was conducted with four male 
and five female elder care professionals. The professionals 
were aged between 36 and 61 years (M = 46.50, SD = 9.89) 
and had an average of M = 14.44 years of work experience in 
the care sector (SD = 6.32).  
A video was used to visualize two potential user-
scenarios of the future SONOPA technology [11]. 
Subsequent questions targeted the following topics: 
• 
Problems related to ADLs and the level of social 
involvement 
• 
Opinion about the SONOPA solution 
• 
General level of technical skills and design 
requirements for technology for elderly 
The recorded material was then coded according to the 
benefits and barriers perceived by the participants. 
B. Perceived Benefits 
Almost all of the benefits found in the literature study 
were supported in the user-requirement study with regard to 
the future SONOPA technology, with the exception of the 
benefit ‘independent living and aging in place’.  
1) Health and Safety: Safety was an attribute which was 
highly valued with regard to the future SONOPA 
technology. Older adults and elder care professionals both 
felt that embedded sensors could provide added safety and 
security by detecting abnormal behavior such as falls or 
other emergencies, and automatically contact help. Thus, 
like in previous studies, ‘fall-detection’ and ‘emergency 
response’ were identified as key features. Automation was 
regarded as the main advantage in comparison with existing 
solutions: “I have a panic button on my mobile […]. But as 
far as I’m concerned it is practically useless. Because if 
something serious happens it is either going to be on the 
other side of the room, or in your hand bag, or you’re not 
capable to press the button. So really what you are talking 
about, is a lot more helpful”. Again, this confirms previous 
findings [5][15]. Another feature which was suggested to be 
incorporated to the SONOPA system was a reminder for 
turning off the stove. 
2) Social 
Involvement: 
Social 
involvement 
was 
perceived as an important advantage of the future SONOPA 
technology. Participants from both groups liked that the 
technology would allow elderly people to make new friends 
and strengthen the neighbourhood network: “It’s like a 
social club.” They also valued that one could stay in touch 
with family and other existing contacts. Participants 
appreciated that contact would be one-on-one and could 
59

lead to real-life interaction. They concluded that SONOPA 
could prevent social isolation by getting people outside the 
house, motivate them to participate in social life and 
therefore give them back a sense in life. By aiding social 
involvement, SONOPA could simultaneously stimulate the 
elderly people’s activity level: “If you meet someone, you 
get ready, you clean the house and you get busy with other 
daily chores. And in this way this kind of technology could 
contribute to staying active”. While this is in line with 
finding from some researchers [17][23], it contradicts 
findings from Steele et al. [5] who found that their elderly 
participants strongly rejected the suggestion to incorporate 
social aspects in an assisted living technologies. However, 
one elder care professional argued that particularly these 
social aspects could be the reason that the more healthy and 
active elderly people would be interested in SONOPA: “For 
some people safety would not be such a big problem at first, 
and if that is all there is, they probably would not get [the 
technology] installed. But it also includes some social 
elements which could maybe convince people to get it 
installed anyway. This way they get familiar with [the 
technology] […] and by the time it is needed for safety 
purposes than there is already a good [activity] profile of 
this people and that I consider a strength”. Mynatt and 
Rogers [33] also implicated that the more technologies can 
be incorporated in the homes of fit elderly, the more likely 
they will be to adopt more advanced assistive technologies 
when their health declines. 
3) Support with the ADLs: In line with previous studies 
[6][18], assistance with chores and reminders (e.g., 
medicine, important appointements) was much appreciated 
among older adults and elder care professionals in the 
context of the future SONOPA technology. A few older 
adults especially liked that there would be a possibility to 
get personal advice from peers or family members via 
video-chat. One of the elderly UK participants even 
suggested to use SONOPA to recruit help for chores 
through the network feature: “But imagine if you want to 
decorate your kitchen and you put it on there, you could 
have five people come around and you could go shopping 
and come back and it would all be done”. Additionaly, elder 
care professionals and older adults found the automatic door 
openers which could be incorporated in SONOPA quite 
helpful in aiding people with mobility problems.  
4) Support Care Network: The older adults stated that 
SONOPA could be very valuable to support the care 
network and provide peace of mind for the relatives. One 
participant regretted that a similar technology was not 
available when she was an informal caregiver: “When mom 
was older I looked after her to be sure she is well. And I 
think this kind of solution would have been very valuable in 
that situation”. Again, this is line with previous findings 
[14]-[17]. 
5) Education and Leisure: Some older adults also saw 
the potential SONOPA social network feature as an 
opportunity to share common interests and educate 
themselves. As one elderly participant stated: “I do 
watercolour painting, I might find somebody who wants to 
come in with me once a week and sit.” Another participant 
suggested to incorporate online classes or educational 
videos in the SONOPA system. Wherton and Prendergast 
[23] had similar findings. 
A possible explanation why ‘independent living and 
aging in place’ was not explicitly mentioned with regard to 
SONOPA, is that SONOPA was already presented as a 
conceptual technology for healthy and independent aging at 
home. Therefore participants might have felt that this was an 
obvious advantage and therefore unnecessary to recall. 
However, various statements made clear that independence 
is very important to the participants. This, and the fact that it 
was a major advantage in previous studies lead to the 
conclusion that ‘independent living and aging in place’ 
indeed should be emphasized as a benefit of AAL 
technologies.  
C. Perceived Barriers 
Besides ‘health concerns’, all barriers identified in the 
literature study were supported in the user-requirement study 
with regard to the future SONOPA technology. 
1) Perceived Need and Perceived Usefulness: Although 
the majority of the older adults liked the general idea of 
SONOPA, many felt no need for it in their current situation. 
They found the concept of SONOPA more beneficial for 
people who are less independent, active and healthy; and 
who are more isolated: “I mean we’re not in the position at 
the moment to need any of those things. But thinking of 
other people, I think it is marvellous”. In line with previous 
findings [16], some older adults found it hard to imagine 
that they might feel less healthy in the near future and would 
need more assistance. Like Peek et al. [14], it was observed 
that many older adults talked about a hypothetical older 
person who could benefit from SONOPA, rather than 
themselves. However, eleven older adults indicated that they 
have no need for it at the moment, but could imagine to use 
it in the future, when they felt less healthy and active, or in 
case they would lose their partner. Some older adults found 
that the future SONOPA technology would not offer a lot of 
added benefits. Several older adults indicated to already use 
a paper diary for overlooking their appointments, or a pill-
box to remember to take their medications. However, it also 
became clear that the concept of the technology was still 
quite abstract and therefore some of the participants did not 
fully understand all benefits the SONOPA technology could 
offer to them.  
2) Privacy, Obstrusiveness and Controle: In line with 
previous studies [12][14][19][23], participants from both 
groups considered the loss of privacy as a negative aspect of 
the future SONOPA technology. Some of SONOPA’s 
60

potential functionalities were also regarded as intrusive. 
Several elderly participants felt that the SONOPA 
technology would invade their personal space, and that they 
would feel observed: “I think it is big brother, being 
watched all the time”. The older adults worried that they 
would feel restricted in their freedom and loose spontaneity: 
“But I don’t know whether you would creep around the 
house, thinking oh dear they can see me […] That would be 
horrible, sort of spy on the wall”. Some of the older adults 
were concerned that the data could get in the wrong hands. 
However, the majority of the older adults found the idea of 
sensors acceptable because they perceived them to benefit 
their personal well-being and safety at home: “When I know 
that the sensors are installed in my home for my well-being, 
I don’t have any problems with them being in my home”. 
Earlier studies found that the loss of some privacy is an 
acceptable trade-off for safety and health [5][15][16]. Most 
older adults wanted to be able to switch the future SONOPA 
system on and off, be aware of which data are shared and 
decide with whom the data are shared. On the contrary, 
other participants thought that the system would only work 
to its full potential, when it could not be switched off. 
Furthermore, most of the participants who were comfortable 
with sensors, were comfortable to have them in every room 
of the house as “you can fall anywhere in the house”. 
However, a few older adults would not like to have sensors 
in the toilet, bathroom and bedroom. 
3) Lack of experience, technology anxiety and self 
efficacy: The older adults were worried about the 
complexity of the future SONOPA technology. It was 
repeatedly emphasized that they did not grew up with 
technology and therefore, might lack the necessary skills, 
experience and confidence: “I think a lot of our generation 
are computer shy”. They were worried about the potential 
complexity of the interface, and how much user 
participation is needed to operate the system: “But if you 
got to go to an iPod thing and should do tututututu [push 
buttons] before you find out what you are supposed to do, 
that is not helpful”. Again, this confirms earlier findings [5]-
[7][14][15][23][29].  
4) Social Stigma: While assistance with chores was well 
perceived by a few older adults, others felt no need for 
assistance and almost felt insulted by the idea: “I don’t need 
anybody to tell me how to make a stew”. We observed that 
some older adults were very proud of their independence 
and therefore, rejected anything which would imply 
otherwise. Indeed, one older adult pointed out that seniors 
might be resistant to accepting that they need assistance and 
therefore, would not want to use technology that stigmatizes 
them as frail and dependent. This was also found by other 
researchers [5][6][14][19]. 
5) Reliability: 
Confirming 
earlier 
findings 
[5][6][14][15], older adults were concerned about the 
reliability of the future technology, especially the sensors. 
They worried that SONOPA could give false alarms: “It 
might just go off with your natural things”. Two seniors 
regarded the activity recommendations as ineffective: “I am 
not convinced that a single technology application and 
especially a screen can motivate people to do stuff”. One 
older adult stated that the technology could even work the 
opposite way, by providing too much assistance and making 
people less active because then they do not have to go 
outside the house to have social contact: “It could be that 
you shackle them behind the computer”. Seniors also 
wondered if all parts of the system could be installed in 
different domestic environments: “I can’t honestly visualize 
it to be a possibility. Not in an old house”. 
6) Lack of Human Interaction: Participants from both 
groups stated that SONOPA could not and should not 
replace human care and human interaction: “For me human 
contact is still most important […} Thus, I prefer no 
computer”. Another participant said: “The negative point is 
that this person’s family and the environment cannot fully 
rely on this application. Because the application cannot 
replace the human”. This concern was also found in earlier 
studies [5][6][32].  
7) Cost: Although cost came not up as a top-of-the-
mind concern among the older adults, when asked about 
what they would be willing to pay for the SONOPA 
technology, it became clear that the technology has to be 
affordable for a person living on a pension. Several French 
and Belgium seniors demanded that the government would 
have to cover parts of the costs. Again, cost was identified 
as a critical issue in earlier studies [5][6][14][32]. 
 
V. 
DESIGN GUIDELINES 
Based on the findings from the literature study and the 
user-requirement study conducted within the SONOPA 
project, several design guidelines are formulated and 
discussed below. 
A. Clear, Specific and Flexible Benefits 
To motivate people to use AAL technologies like 
SONOPA, it must not just offer added benefits, but at the 
same time those benefits have to be clear, specific and 
profound. Benefits which should be emphasized include: 
independence, safety, social involvement, support with 
ADLs, support of the care network and education and 
leisure. Keeping in mind that the intended target group is 
partially still very active and social, and therefore, might not 
feel an immediate need for an assistive technology, social, 
leisure and educational benefits should be further developed 
to target this segment. Because the concept of AAL 
technologies is often perceived as abstract, elderly should be 
able to try out or experience SONOPA without immediately 
being obliged to buy it.

B. Ensuring Privacy, Security and Unobtrusiveness 
AAL technologies like SONOPA contain sensitive data 
such as the personal activity patterns. Measures must be 
taken to ensure the security of this sensitive information. 
Privacy concerns can be reduced by giving the user control 
over whether the system is active, where the sensors are 
placed and which data are shared and with whom. However, 
user control has to be weighed against the proper 
functionality and reliability of the system. To avoid that 
people forget to switch the system back on, a time limit for 
deactivation could be applied. Furthermore, caregivers could 
be informed that the system has been switched off. To 
counter obtrusiveness, the technology and the sensors should 
be embedded in the elderly people’s home environment and 
blend with the surroundings. The system should be able to 
communicate wirelessly and without noise, and not interfere 
with other devices in the home environment. For the social 
network element, the use of a closed network is 
recommended. Finally, it should be emphasized that the 
monitoring feature is for the sole purpose of the elderly 
person’s health, safety and well-being.  
C. Simplicity and Familarity 
The interaction with the system should be simple, 
consistent and easy to use and learn. The SONOPA interface 
has to be intuitive and clearly structured. Technical slang 
should be avoided and textual elements should fit the 
elderly’s frame of reference. The challenge is to create a 
simple design but not limit the functionality [23]. 
D. Training and Low Level of Active Interaction 
To simplify the interaction with AAL technologies like 
SONOPA, it is suggested to automate most processes and to 
opt for a minimal level of active user interaction, if desired 
by the user. Special training programs should be designed to 
teach the elderly how to use SONOPA and thereby improve 
the perceived ease of use and the confidence in their skills. 
E. Emphasizing Abilities rather than Disabilities 
When designing and marketing AAL technologies like 
SONOPA, emphasis should be put on the abilities rather than 
the disabilities of the target group. This can be achieved by 
further developing and embedding social, leisure and 
educational features. SONOPA’s functionalities should be 
helpful but not patronizing and be flexible to the wishes of 
the still healthy and active user.  
F. Reliability and Technial Support 
Given that the average experience with technology in the 
elderly target group is rather low, robustness to mistakes is 
another important demand for designers to keep in mind. 
Furthermore, sensors should be accurate and reliable to avoid 
false alarms. Technical support in form of a helpline or a 
well-written manual should be available to all users to 
minimize technology anxiety and promote a successful 
interaction with the technology. 
G. Flexibility and Adaptiveness 
AAL technologies like SONOPA should be adaptive to 
differences in physical constraints, personal preferences, 
technological skills, context and environment. By offering 
high flexibility in content, functionalities and level of 
control, SONOPA can appeal to the different needs of this 
highly divers target group. 
H. Promoting not Replacing Social Interaction 
AAL technologies like SONOPA should promote and not 
replace social interaction. For instance, it is recommended to 
use a local social network so that face-to-face interaction is a 
possibility. 
I. 
Low Cost and Spread Payments 
Keeping in mind that the average income in parts of the 
intended target group is rather low, costs should fit into the 
available resources of the users. Also, a monthly payment 
scheme is recommended. Furthermore, one should keep in 
mind that users might expect that costs are partially covered 
by social security means. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
AAL technologies can offer a promising solution to help 
elderly people to age independently in their own home 
environment, and at the same time control healthcare cost 
[5][6]. However, it is still uncertain if elderly people who are 
generally technology shy and have not grown up with 
technology will be ready to adopt these technologies [7][14]. 
This paper identified six benefits and eight barriers which are 
perceived by the elderly user with regard to assisted living 
technologies. Those benefits and barriers were found as a 
result of an extensive literature study and then supported and 
further specified by the findings of focus groups and 
interviews conducted within a user-requirement study. 
Together, findings led to the following design guidelines: (1) 
clear, specific and flexible benefits, (2) ensuring privacy, 
security and unobtrusiveness, (3) simplicity and familiarity, 
(4) training and low level of level of active interaction, (5) 
emphasizing abilities rather than disabilities, (6) reliability 
and technical support, (7) flexibility and adaptiveness, (8) 
promoting not replacing social interaction, (9) low cost and 
spread payments.  
Our approach is not without limitations. The literature 
study did not follow a strictly systematic approach and 
therefore relevant articles might have been missed. However, 
a very recent systematic review on technology for aging in 
place was included [14]. Secondly, at this stage benefits, 
barriers and consequent design guidelines are based on 
qualitative data which were collected at an early project 
stage and with the use of only video scenarios. Therefore, 
these guidelines should be considered as an initial blueprint 
which will be further evaluated and specified as the 
SONOPA project matures. 
Future work will focus on gathering quantitative data to 
further verify benefits, barriers and other factors relevant for 
the adoption of AAL technologies. Furthermore, instead of 
using scenarios a SONOPA prototype will be developed and 
evaluated in the field.

Although design guidelines need further specification, 
they form a valuable directive for the developers of 
SONOPA and other AAL technologies.
