Abstract— The growth rate of seaweed is significantly affected 
by 
wave 
parameters 
and 
sea 
conditions. 
The 
wave 
characteristics in an aquaculture farm is normally measured 
using expensive equipment, which is not affordable for many 
farmers or researchers, and is not easily relocated from place to 
place to evaluate wave conditions in a variety of locations. In this 
paper, a sensor fusion method is presented which can estimate 
wave height using the data logged by a multi modal low-cost 
seaweed-attached sensor system. The sensor was developed for 
use in an Aquaculture scenario. This method is based on 
combination of extended Kalman filter and artificial neural 
networks. Regarding the importance of studying the impact of 
wave on seaweeds growth rate, this method will avail many 
researchers to use wave height data in their study to fill the gap 
in knowledge of the impact of water motion on aquaculture and 
maximising of seaweed harvests.

 INTRODUCTION 
According to the “fishery and aquaculture statistics” 
published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) 
[1], the contribution from aquaculture to total fish production 
reached 46.0% in 2018 as compared to 25.7% in 2000. This 
rapid growth in fish farming activities causes environmental 
sustainability concerns [2]. As production increases, so two 
the demand on the environment to provide more nutrients and 
the waste generated increases. Another impact on economic 
sustainability comes from the increased maintenance and 
labour costs associated with increased production. 
One promising solution to sustainable aquaculture is to 
employ the practice of Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture 
(IMTA) . IMTA is an aquaculture farming method where the 
by-products and wastes of one aquatic species, for example 
fish, is utilised as food for another species, such as seaweed or 
shellfish. New approaches, such as those developed in the 
IMPAQT project [3], aim to integrate the IMTA model, smart 
systems, and sensors for monitoring, data modelling and 
intelligent management systems [4]. 
Seaweed growth rates are considerably affected by water 
motion and flow rate. In low level water motion, seaweeds 
absorb less nutrients and CO2, which is limiting the growth.  
High movement rates, on the other hand, can dislodge kelps 
and reduced productivity as a result of forcing them to develop 
larger holdfasts [5]. According to Hurd [6], to understand how 
water motion can affect the growth rate of seaweeds, the 
influence of other environmental factors should be measured 
and accounted for in aquaculture site management and 
operation. 
Several studies have investigated this topic, such as [7], 
[8], and [9], where water motion rates and wave exposure 
were not directly measured with wave sensors/loggers, such 
as Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), wave buoys, 
but were indirectly measured  using wind speed and incidence, 
and distance to coastline to estimate the wave exposure index 
[10]. Using this method it was possible to categorise large 
geographical locations as “high exposure” or “low exposure”. 
According to Lindegarth and Gamfeldt [11], using this 
categorical variable method instead of a continuous-type 
variable results in very different explanations of the 
importance of environmental factors. Furthermore, Focht and 
Shima [12], found that the correspondence between in-situ 
measurements by accelerometers and a wave-rider buoy and a 
priori assessments of wave exposure is limited.  
Various research, such as [12]-[14], presented solutions to 
the problem of measuring water motion using inexpensive 
sensors developed using commonly available materials. 
Lyman et al. [14], developed a low-cost open-source pressure 
transducer to record wave height using a PVC pipe as housing. 
In [12], fine-scale wave exposure in different locations have 
been measured using accelerometers, and compared with a 
nearby deployed wave-rider buoy. Their analysis shows that 
there was a significant fine-scale variation in the wave 
movement, as a result of changes in acceleration, timing, and 
frequency of wave events. 
Evans and Abdo in [13], designed a structure that is 
attached to a HOBO Pendant G acceleration data logger, 
moored to the seafloor, and deployed adjacent to a wave-rider 
buoy. They showed that the wave motion data logged by the 
accelerometer is correlated with the daily average, maximum 
Wave-Rider Buoy (WRB), tidal data and found it to be highly 
correlated with daily average total wave height.  The authors 
discussed that using a faster sampling rate for accelerometer 
(with increased data storage), more detailed water movement 
parameters, such as velocities, forces, and wave period; could 
be measured and determined. It would also enable a more 
detailed analysis of the data using spectral analysis. They

conclude that, their method allows researchers to collect 
additional water movement data where advanced devices are 
not available or too costly. 
In another study by Mullarney and Pilditch [15], the 
HOBO Pendant G Accelerometers is attached to the kelp stipe 
by tying it at fixed intervals up the stipe bundle. Pressure and 
velocities were measured by an Acoustic Doppler Current 
Profilers (ADCP) for this study. The objective of the research 
was to find the response of kelp to the wave movement. 
According to the review of literature that has been 
presented, measurements of wave height and/or water motion 
is critical in aquaculture and has been studied in many 
research publications. However, all the solutions and research 
discussed above have problems in common, such as the 
typically large size of the sensors systems that limits the 
deployment method; power requirements such as cables, 
external power supplies, and data recovery. On the other hand, 
a low-cost miniature wave measurement solution has been 
presented in [16] and [17]. To aid in in-situ monitoring for 
IMTA aquaculture farm sites, a seaweed monitoring device 
was developed, which is described in detail in [18]. 
In this paper, a method based on sensor fusion and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is proposed in order to estimate 
current and wave using data recorded by the attached seaweed 
sensor presented in [18]. This method can avail many 
researchers to use wave height data in their study and fill the 
gap in knowledge of exact impact of water motion on 
aquaculture. To achieve this method, the seaweed-attached 
sensors have been deployed in an IMTA site and the 
correlation between the data recorded by the sensor and wave 
height have been studied. The results showed a strong 
correlation and the next step is to train a neural network to 
estimate wave height using data logged by seaweed-attached 
sensor.  
The remainder of the paper is organised as the following. 
In Section II, the methodology of suggested method is 
presented and feasibility of the method is investigated in 
Section III where the initial result from a deployment is 
studied. At the end, in Section IV, the paper is concluded. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY  
The seaweed attached sensor, AquaBit (see Figure 1.), has 
been originally designed to measure ambient parameters 
relevant to seaweeds, such as light, temperature, depth, and 
motion [18]. However, this sensor has significant potential to 
be used in indirect measurement of other parameters based on 
fusion of the readings from different sensors embedded in 
AquaBit. In this section, a method is proposed to estimate 
current strength and wave height. 
The embedded IMU sensor consists of a 3-axis 
accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. The accelerations and 
angular velocities are sampled with the frequency of 12.5 Hz 
and recorded in the internal flash memory of AquaBit. This 
sampling frequency provide much higher accuracy in 
comparison with a data buoy which normally operate with a 
very long sampling interval in range of minutes. 
Motion and displacement of the seaweed-attached sensor 
is the result of current and wave. Faster motion is the result of 
stronger wave or current [19]. Therefore, if we can calculate 
the motion of the attached sensor, we can estimate the strength 
of current or wave. Theoretically, acceleration is the second 
time-derivative of position, and vice versa, position is the 
second integral of acceleration. Therefore, we should be able 
to calculate the position of AquaBit easily from the 
accelerations measured by the IMU. However, this calculation 
results in huge position error as the consequence of 
measurement noise.

On the other hand, it is very hard to find the exact function 
that maps the motion of attached sensor to wave or current. 
The main reason is that the AquaBit is attached to seaweed 
blades and to establish the function, the exact hydro dynamic 
model of seaweed blades and AquaBit are needed which is 
hard (or even impossible) to find in the context of the fast 
growth of seaweeds. 
The proposed method of this paper is to use an Extended 
Kalman Filter (EKF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to 
estimate current and wave base on the readings from IMU 
sensor. The EKF is employed to cope with the noise in 
measurement and the ANN is trained in such a way that maps 
the accelerations to current and wave states.  
The EKF is a well-known optimal state observer for 
nonlinear systems, which can estimate the state of system 
using noisy measurements of system output [20]. EKF has 
also been widely employed as a sensor fusion method to 
estimate the orientation of an object using angular velocities 
and linear acceleration experienced by the object, [21][22].  
 The proposed method is to feed IMU measurements to an 
EKF to estimate the orientation of the IMU with respect to an 
Earth-Fixed coordination Frame (EFF). The EEF is a three-
dimension orthogonal coordination frame fixed to the earth. 
The X-axis is aligned with the North direction in the opposite 
direction of gravity, Y-axis is aligned with the West direction, 
and Z-axis is the cross product of X and Y, which is in the 
opposite direction of gravity. Using the orientation of the IMU 
w.r.t. EFF, we will be able to reject the effect of gravity on 
measurements of accelerometer and estimate the accelerations 
in EFF.  
Artificial intelligence, or more specifically Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANN), is a good solution when it is difficult 
to directly measure a physical parameter but some other 
related parameters are more accessible and easy to measure. 
For example, in the case of the scenario described in this 
paper, it is impossible to measure wave height on each 
29

seaweed growth line in an aquaculture farm. However, it is 
possible to measure the acceleration and angular velocity 
experienced by seaweeds using AquaBit. Therefore, we can 
train an ANN to estimate wave height from AquaBit 
measurements. 
To train the ANN, AquaBit units will be deployed as close 
as possible to a current meter or wave logger/sensor. Then, 
using the IMU measurement of AquaBit, as inputs, and the 
data logged by current meter/wave sensor, as outputs, are 
joined to shape a dataset. This dataset is used to train and test 
the ANN. Then, this ANN is used to map acceleration to 
current or wave. 
III. 
PILOT RESULTS 
To test the feasibility of the proposed method, data 
collected in one of the AquaBit deployment in the Marine 
Institute aquaculture research site (Lehanagh Pool), Galway, 
Ireland is used. In this deployment, AquaBit units have been 
attached to artificial seaweeds, as shown in Figure 2.

The data recorded by the IMU sensor of AquaBit in this 
deployment have been compared with tilt data recorded by the 
data buoy of the same site. 
To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method the 
correlation between magnitude of tilt data and the magnitude 
of reading from AquaBit gyroscope in frequency domain is 
studied using Pearson correlation coefficient.  
The tilt data are recorded as the maximum and minimum 
value of tilt experienced around X- and Y-axis (EEF) during 
a 10 minute period. The magnitude of tilt is calculated as in 
(1) and (2).

where, 𝑤_𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑤_𝑦𝑚𝑎𝑥 , and 𝑤_𝑧𝑚𝑎𝑥  are the maximum 
angular velocity around X-, Y-, and Z-axis (sensor 
coordination frame) during a 10 minute period. Note that, the 
time period for maximum/minimum calculation is exactly the 
same for data buoy and AquaBit.  
Since these measurements are compared in frequency 
domain, the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is used to 
transform tilt and angular velocities into frequency domain.   
The Pearson correlation coefficient for the FFT of 𝑇𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 
and the FFT of 𝑊𝑚𝑎𝑥 is 0.84 with p-value of 5 × 10−97; and 
for the FFT of 𝑇𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 and the FFT of 𝑊𝑚𝑖𝑛 is 0.85 with p-
value of 1 × 10−99, which means the variation in tilt can be 
calculated using angular velocities by a linear function. The 
tilt values from the data buoy approximately represents wave 
height – the higher the wave height the more tilt measured by 
the buoy measures. As the tilt measured by the buoy is 
correlated with the angular velocity measured by the sensor 
device, we conclude that the wave height could be estimated 
by the angular velocity. This supports the expectation that a 
sensor fusion algorithm for accelerometer and gyroscope 
could provide good estimates of wave height and energy. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we presented a work in progress, a novel 
method of estimation of wave height for cost effective 
research project. The method translates the data collected by 
a 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) IMU (accelerometer and 
gyroscope) into wave height by combining EKF and ANN. 
The data analysis of a pilot trial showed that the angular 
velocity is strongly correlated to tilt values recorded by a 
wave-rider buoy. In other words, wave height or other wave 
statistical parameters could be estimated using readings from 
the embedded IMU of AquaBit. The next step is to figure out 
an ANN and train it to estimate the wave height using the data 
recorded by the embedded IMU of AquaBit. The hypothesis 
will continue to be investigated in Flume Tanks [23] 
(dedicated infrastructure for wave measurements) and the 
algorithms developed to establish wave height from IMU 
readings attached to seaweed lines in aquaculture oriented 
deployments.
