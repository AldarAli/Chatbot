Abstract—Video streaming is one of the most data-intensive 
applications of today’s Mobile Internet and YouTube 
generates 20% of mobile networks downstream traffic in 
several regions. YouTube employs the progressive download 
technique for video playback and therefore its traffic is bursty. 
We present the characteristics of the most important burst 
measures of traffic generated by YouTube when accessed via 
mobile broadband connections. Moreover, we also distinguish 
the characterization for non-optimized and optimized traffic 
since mobile operators are using media optimization platforms 
to effectively deliver video content. In this paper, we present 
our 
measurement-based 
analytical 
results 
to 
derive 
characterization of the traffic sources. As a result, we propose 
a generic model and its parameters according to the optimized 
and non-optimized traffic sources based on the experimental 
evaluation of the captured YouTube traffic. The proposed 
traffic models can be used in simulation of future work. 
Keywords-YouTube; video optimization; burstiness; traffic 
characterization; traffic model. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Mobile data traffic is set explode in the upcoming years 
as consumers add more devices to the mobile networks and 
operators deploy faster networks. Mobile operators around 
the world are ramping up deployment of 4G LTE networks 
while subscribers are consuming more and more data. One of 
today’s most data-intensive applications is video streaming. 
In this work, we present the characterization and examine the 
bursty nature of the mobile network traffic generated by one 
of the most relevant video streaming platform: YouTube. 
According to the Sandvine Global Internet Phenomena 
Report from 2014 in most regions, YouTube is the 
application responsible for generating the most bandwidth; it 
accounts for around 20 % of mobile downstream traffic in 
North America, Europe and Latin America. While Netflix 
saw growth in the share thanks to the continued rollout of 
high bitrate Super HD content, in many regions YouTube 
continues to be the largest single source of Real-Time 
Entertainment traffic on both fixed and mobile access 
networks, which makes it the leading source of Internet 
traffic in the entire world. In North America 17.61% of the 
total downstream traffic is generated via YouTube, while in 
Europe it is 19.27% [1]. 
YouTube employs the progressive download technique; 
its video content is delivered by a regular HTTP web server 
rather than a streaming server. Video delivered using this 
technique is stored on the viewer’s hard drive as it’s 
received, and then it’s played from the hard drive; it enables 
video playback before the content download is completely 
finished [6]. It also uses the HTTP/TCP (Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol/Transmission Control Protocol) platform to deliver 
data, which further distinguishes it from traditional media 
streaming [4].  
The present paper aims at four main objectives: (1) to 
highlight the YouTube service traffic characterization when 
accessed via mobile broadband connection; (2) to present 
proper measures for catching the bursty nature of YouTube 
traffic; (3) to distinguish the effect of media optimization 
platform used in mobile networks; and (4) to propose traffic 
models for non-optimized and optimized YouTube traffic 
accessed via mobile broadband connection. 
The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 
provides an overview of the traffic sources and the 
experimental framework used during the analysis and the 
capture method itself; Section 3 provides a summary of the 
most important burst and correlation measures and their 
numerical evaluation on the captured traces; Section 4 
presents the analysis of the experimental results of the main 
characteristics of YouTube traffic accessed via 3G mobile 
network; Section 5 provides the traffic model state machine, 
its parameters and its mode of operation via algorithm; 
finally, Section 6 presents the main conclusions. 
II. 
TRAFFIC SOURCES 
A. Experimental framework 
In this section, we describe the experimental framework 
used to collect traces of data traffic generated by YouTube 
accessed via 3G mobile network. The framework is 
composed of a notebook connected to a mobile service 
provider’s network via USB stick on the move. The modem 
is able to handle downstream traffic up to 42 Mbps via DC-
HSPA+ (Dual Carrier-High Speed Packet Access) and 21 
Mbps via HSPA+ access. Its upstream capability is 5.76 
Mbps. The used mobile technology was at least HSPA+ in 
98.4% of the samples, the remaining part was EDGE 
(Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution). During pilot 
tests it was verified that neither the CPU (Central Processing 
Unit) nor the memory of the notebook impeded the normal 
playback of the video clips. 
A playback monitor tool has been built with the main 
objective of analyzing YouTube traffic and collect available 
information about the videos. The tool includes a web 
application using the YouTube player API (Application

Programming Interface) via JavaScript [11]. It is able to play 
videos sequentially based on video_id list and collect all the 
available information like duration, total bytes into a log file. 
The web application was stored on a public web server and 
was accessed from the notebook via Chrome browser 39.0. 
The other part of the framework is Microsoft Network 
Monitor 3.4 software installed on the notebook. However, 
Wireshark is more popular for trace collection, we had to 
swap it because it was not able to capture on mobile 
broadband interfaces. On the other hand the collected traces 
were compatible with Wireshark as well, so we could use its 
advantages in traffic analysis. It was enough to capture only 
the first 68 bytes of each package, with the help of the 
headers we were able to reproduce the traffic itself [9] [10] 
[12]. 
B. Media Optimization in Mobile Networks 
Video optimization refers to a set of technologies used by 
mobile service providers to improve the consumers viewing 
experience by reducing video start times or re-buffering 
events. The process also aims to reduce the amount of 
network bandwidth consumed by video sessions. While 
optimization technology can be applied to videos played on a 
variety of media-consuming devices, the costliness of mobile 
streaming and increase in mobile video viewers has created a 
very high demand for optimization solutions among mobile 
service providers [8]. 
Video optimization techniques used to improve network 
performance and subscriber experience include: 
 
Caching — local copies of video are stored for 
successive access 
 
Pacing — data is delivered “just in time” rather 
than all at once (and frequently abandoned) 
 
Transrating — changing the frame rate 
 
Transcoding — recoding the video codec for lower 
bitrate 
 
Enhancing TCP — for mobile handling to minimize 
back and forth signaling 
 
Compressing — data reduction of the content 
Lossless Media Optimization offers a low-cost media 
optimization entry-point for operators. It adjusts the video 
transmission rate to match the actual video play rate, without 
changing the video content. Instead of clogging the network 
at the start of the video, the lossless Just-In-Time (JIT) 
technique “spreads” the video delivery over the entire video 
play time. With JIT, videos download as fast as needed, 
rather than as fast as possible, taking additional advantage 
over the fact that most videos are not watched to the end [8]. 
Lossy Media Optimization reduces the amount of data 
transmitted over the wireless network. Operators are using 
static data reduction or dynamic bandwidth shaping, which 
are performed in combination with Just-In-Time (JIT) 
lossless optimization. To achieve the best response time, 
lossy optimization is performed "on-the-fly". The data 
reduction of the media is a function of the media quality. The 
higher the data reduction of the content, the lower is the 
quality of the media provided [8]. Within the measured 
mobile network Lossy Media Optimization is in use. Figure 
1 depicts the high-level architecture of the platform. 
We have two types of traffic in the mobile network. In 
the first scenario video clips were delivered through the 
aforementioned media optimization platform, in the second 
scenario we collected traces without that. The mobile 
network was configured with two different Access Point 
Names to differentiate between the two scenarios. The only 
thing we had to do is to set the APN in use on the notebook 
before connecting to service provider.

C. Collected traces 
A trace set of 95 video clip downloads was collected with 
the recently described experimental framework. This set has 
been collected to understand the main traffic characteristics 
of YouTube traffic accessed via mobile network. All the 
video clips has been downloaded in their default format 
[4][5]. YouTube uses the MP4 container for high-definition 
(HD) clips and uses the Flash Video (FLV) as the default 
format for the majority of non-HD clips. YouTube adapts all 
the uploaded clips to the aforementioned formats before 
posting [4]. 
The trace set was captured two times as follows. We can 
assume that there was no bottleneck in the mobile networks 
backhaul or core network. 
 
SHAPED: This set has been collected using the 
recently mentioned mobile networks Lossy Media 
Optimization function; APN is set accordingly. 
Traffic was affected by the YouTube server, the 
Media Optimization platform and the access 
technology, radio conditions of the used mobile 
network.  
 
UNSHAPED: This set has been collected without 
using the recently mentioned mobile networks 
Lossy Media Optimization function; APN is set 
accordingly. Traffic was affected by the YouTube 
server and the access technology, radio conditions 
of the used mobile network. 
III. 
BURST AND CORRELATION MEASURES 
A simple class of burstiness measures takes only the first-
order properties into account; they are each a function of the 
marginal distribution only of interarrival times (with 
resolution of 0.001 s). These measures can be taken into 
consideration as various characteristics of the marginal 
distribution of the inter-arrival time. The possible set of 
properties are the moments of that distribution [2]. 
More complex measures are utilizing the second-order 
properties of the traffic; they do take account of temporal 
dependence in traffic. From this class indices of dispersion is 
one of the most well-known methods. It includes the 
correlation properties of the traffic and can be very 
informative [2].

A. Measures based on the first order properties 
One of the mostly used measures is the peak to mean 
ratio (PMR). Peak is defined in this paper as inter-arrival 
time between the two closest arrivals. In case of 
UNSHAPED traffic peak may be very high and likely to 
correspond to two arrivals in consecutive slots in practice. In 
the case of SHAPED traffic, the peak tells more about the 
shaper parameters than the traffic itself [3].

281.555 
25.265 
SHAPED 
0.00008560 
254.040 
24.411 
Another widely used measure is the squared coefficient 
of variation (SCV) of the inter-arrival times. It includes 
information from the first two moments and is defined 
𝐶2(𝑋) = 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋)/𝐸2(𝑋) where X is the inter-arrival time 
[3]. As shown in Table I, when comparing the values of the 
SHAPED and UNSHAPED traffic, it is higher for the 
UNSHAPED indicating it is burstier because it includes 
sustained higher intensities. Also, the lower value of the 
SCV indicates a smoother process. 
The SCV takes into account only the set of the inter-
arrival times, the order of that is passed by. However, 
burstiness is mainly caused by two factors [3]: the 
distribution and especially the tail of the inter-arrival times 
and the correlation between them. The squared coefficient of 
variation from the first-order measures class takes into 
account only the inter-arrival distribution. 
Suppose that X is a real-valued random variable. The 
variance of X is the second moment of X, and measures the 
spread of the distribution of X. The third and fourth moments 
of X also measure interesting features of the distribution. The 
third moment measures skewness, the lack of symmetry, 
while the fourth moment measures kurtosis, the degree to 
which the distribution is peaked. 
Higher moments can also tell useful information about 
the traffic characteristics. For example, two traffic with same 
first two moments but different third moment can produce 
very different queueing behavior. The third moment tells 
about the long inter-arrivals. Although inter-arrival times are 
bounded from above for both SHAPED and UNSHAPED 
traffic, higher m3 for UNSHAPED traffic means it has higher 
inter-arrival times. 
B. Measures based on the second order properties 
Indices of dispersion measures are useful because they 
show the traffic variability over different scales and they can 
capture the correlation structure. Two indices of dispersion 
measures are widely used: the index of dispersion for 
intervals (IDI) is related to the sequence of inter-arrivals; the 
index of dispersion for counts (IDC) is related to the 
sequence of counts of arrivals in consecutive time units [2]. 
The IDI is defined for a stationary inter-arrival sequence 
X as follows: 
𝐼𝐷𝐼 =
𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑋𝑖+1+⋯+𝑋𝑖+𝑛)
𝑛𝐸2(𝑋)
= 𝐶𝑗
2 (1 + 2 ∑
(1 −
𝑗
𝑛) 𝜌𝑗
𝑛−1
𝑗=1
) 
𝑛 = 1, 2, … 
𝐶𝑗
2 = 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑋)
𝐸2(𝑋)  
𝜌𝑛 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑋𝑖, 𝑋𝑖+𝑛)/𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑋) 
In the definition, the sum of k consecutive inter-arrivals 
is taken. In the case of bursty process, the sort and long inter-
arrivals are grouped together, and it causes and it causes the 
IDI to increase with increasing k. In fact, the increase or 
decrease in the IDI graph is directly related to the correlation 
of the inter-arrival sequence. 
The IDC for a stationary process is defined as 

𝐼𝐷𝐶 =
𝑉(𝑡)
𝐸(𝑡) =
𝑉(𝑡)
𝑡𝑚 

where V(t) and E(t) are the variance and the expected 
number of the arrivals in an interval of length t, and E(t)=tm, 
where m is the mean intensity of arrivals. The IDC shows the 
variability of a process over different time-scales.

Figure 3.  IDC Graph of traffic sources: (a) UNSHAPED, (b) SHAPED 
As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, in case of 
UNSHAPED and SHAPED traffic the IDI and IDC curves 
both increase. Together they imply that the low burstiness in 
short scales increase over higher scales due to positive 
correlation. The quickly increasing curves and the high value 
at infinity imply that these are very bursty sources. From 
Figure 3, it can be seen, the SHAPED traffic has lower 
squared coefficient variation (start of IDI curve) and a bit 
lower IDI and IDC curves than UNSHAPED meaning lower 
burstiness of the traffic source. 
To have accurate IDC curves, the maximal block size (t) 
should not exceed 10% of the sample size. Using non-
overlapping blocks with size t we need at least 10 values in a 
block to calculate accurate variance. From Figure 3 it can be 
seen that increasing block size t implies more inaccurate IDC 
curves.  
IV. 
ANALYTICAL RESULTS 
This section introduces the experimental results obtained 
to evaluate the traffic generated by YouTube captured via 
mobile broadband access. On the basis of the information 
provided by our experimental framework we depict the 
progressive download of a video clip, which belong to trace 
set UNSHAPED, as an example. Figure 4 plots the time 
evaluation of the instantaneous amount of data received by 
the player at the beginning of the download. 
A. Initial burst 
A video clip download commences with a significant 
burst of data, later the receiving data rate of the client’s 
player is considerably reduced (see Figure 4 (a)). Initial burst 
is identified in each trace by determining the slope change in 
the accumulated data received by the player between the 
initial burst and the throttling phase. To eliminate the effect  
 
Figure 4.  Examples received data at player: (a) instananeous, (b) accumulated
118

of temporary slop changes caused by network bandwidth 
fluctuations, the accumulated data have been filtered with a 
400 ms simple moving average. A slope approximation 
sequence computed as the difference between consecutive 
samples of the filtered series. Then, the maximum slop after 
the initial burst, during the throttling phase is computed by 
considering only the last 20 s of the trace [4]. The observed 
end of the initial burst is measured as the last instant of the 
trace when two consecutive samples of the slope 
approximation sequence surpass the maximum slope of the 
throttling phase. 
Figure 5 (a) depicts the CDF of the amount of data 
(measured in seconds of video data) downloaded until the 
observed end of the initial burst for all downloads of the 
traces. The results show that the majority of the measured 
sizes amount to approximately 52 s and 65 s of the video 
data. 
For 
the 
remaining 
downloads, 
the 
empirical 
measurements of their initial burst slightly differ from the 
above mentioned two values, which is caused by short 
fluctuations in the mobile network’s available bandwidth that 
affect the empirical estimation.  
Our examination highlighted that majority of the 
collected traces from UNSHAPED and SHAPED traffic 
sources has the same initial burst size measures in video 
seconds. However, in case of SHAPED traffic the deviation 
is a bit higher. Only the download duration of the initial burst 
is different: it is significantly higher in case of UNSHAPED 
traffic than SHAPED. It is caused by the traffic shaping 
function of the aforementioned media optimization platform, 
limiting the available bandwidth for a given video clip, 
therefore helping the network not be overloaded.  
It should be noted that in opposite with the results of [4] 
setup parameter burst is not sent via the HTTP request by the 
YouTube client anymore. Our experimental result show that 
the initial burst size is not limited to 40 s but can take on 
different values, higher than earlier.  
B. Throttling algorithm 
We continue our discussion of the experimental analysis 
by focusing on the traffic received by the player after the 
initial seconds of a progressive download. As shown in 
Figure 4 (b), after the initial burst, the slope of the 
accumulated received data at the player was reduced because 
of a decrease in the receiving data rate. Figure 4 (b) shows 
that after the initial burst the steepness of the slope remains 
approximately constant until the download is completed. It is 
caused by the server, which throttles down the traffic 
generation rate increasing the total time required to complete 
file download. From the collected traces throttling factor can 
be calculated easily: 

𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 = 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒
𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒

From the results of Figure 4 it can be concluded that after 
the initial burst, the media server throttles down the traffic 
generation rate, thereby avoiding transferring the data at the 
maximum available bandwidth. A throttling algorithm is 
applied with a throttling factor of 0.92 of the video total data 
rate. Figure 6 also depicts that there is no difference in 
throttling factor of UNSHAPED and SHAPED traffic 
sources. 
This throttling procedure is also used in other platforms. 
It saves bandwidth of media files that might not be played to 
the end [7]. Additionally, it prevents congestion both at the 
server and the network because the data transfer is not 
performed at the Internet’s maximum available bandwidth. 
C. Chunk size 
In the previous section we highlighted that traffic 
generation rate is constant during the throttling period. If we 
magnify Figure 4 (a), it is clearly visible that traffic consists 
of small chunks. Figure 4 shows that during the throttling 
phase, the pattern of reception of data alternates between the 
reception of data chunks and short periods without packets.

To further analyze this characteristic, all video clips of 
trace set UNSHAPED and SHAPED were postprocessed. It 
eliminates the initial burst of each download and 
additionally, groups packets into chunks so that two 
consecutive packets belong to the same chunk if the 
difference between their arrival times does not exceed a 
given time threshold. If the difference is longer than the time 
threshold, the two consecutive packets are assumed to belong 
to different chunks. Thus, the size of a chunk can be 
calculated simply by aggregating the size of the payloads of 
all of its TCP packets. The time threshold used to decide if 
two consecutive packets belong to the same chunk is selected 
to be 200 ms. 
 
Figure 6.  Throttling factor 
From the empirically measured chunk sizes, we observe 
that in case of audio majority of the measured chunk sizes 
are equal 240 KB. Marginally, chunks with size of 182 KB 
were also found. We cannot observe significant difference 
between UNSHAPED and SHAPED traffic sources. In case 
of video we observe chunks with sizes between 400 and 
1500 KB. Very small chunks (40-52 bytes) are ignored since 
these are identified as ACK messages in the TCP sessions. 
V. 
TRAFFIC MODEL 
On the basis of the experiments presented in previous 
sections, a common synthetic model of the UNSHAPED and 
SHAPED traffic sources are proposed by means of a basic 
state machine (see Figure 7.) with pseudo-code describing its 
mode of operation (see Figure 8.). The algorithm provides 
the time instants and burst sizes in bytes to send on the TCP 
layer. The two examined traffic sources are distinguished 
with the parameters of the state machine as follows. 
TABLE II.

The generic traffic model consists of two states: an initial 
burst and throttling state. At the start of a video playback the 
algorithm needs d (video total duration in seconds) and s 
(video total size in bytes) as input parameters. 
 
Figure 7.  Generic traffic model 
To set up the initial burst state first we need to calculate 
the size of the burst to send in bytes. To achieve this, we 
recall that distribution of dib (initial burst size in video 
seconds) shows two distinct values with high probability. 
According to Equation (4) we use the weighted sum of two 
distinct normal distributions as approximation. Parameters of 
the distribution formula of dib can be obtained from Table II. 
The sib parameter (size of the initial burst in bytes) can be 
calculated based on dib easily with Equation (5).

While having b available bandwidth, in the initial burst 
state the algorithm has to send the first sib bytes of the video 
to the player with b available bandwidth. Algorithm 
maintains a variable sremaining, which contains the bytes still 
has to send to the player out of s. Figure 8. presents to 
pseudo code of each state of the state machine. 
After sending an initial burst with sib bytes, in the 
throttling state the procedure write blocks of cs (chunk size 
in bytes) of data into the TCP socket with a period controlled 
by the tf (throttling factor). Chunks are generated based on 
identified chunk sizes.

We have compared the download rates from the original 
YouTube and synthetic model traces for every video clip. 
For the comparison, the instantaneous relative error of the 
accumulated amount of data has been computed at every 
sampling instant n as: 
𝜀[𝑛] = |𝐴̂[𝑛] − 𝐴[𝑛]|
𝐴[𝑛]
 
where 𝜀[𝑛] denotes the instantaneous relative error, 𝐴[𝑛] 
represents the amount of the accumulated data received by 
the player’s buffer in the case  of the download from the 
original YouTube server and 𝐴̂[𝑛] represents the amount of 
the accumulated data from synthetic model. It has to be 
noted that period between consecutive samples of the 
discrete-time sequence 𝐴[𝑛] and 𝐴̂[𝑛] was set to 100 ms. 
Finally the 90th percentile of the discrete-time sequence 𝜀[𝑛] 
has been computed and denoted as 𝜀̂. The results show that 
the relative error 𝜀̂ does not exceed 8%. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper we described the characteristics of YouTube 
traffic from the viewpoint of mobile broadband access. It is 
very valuable for predicting the video quality perceived by 
end-users 
and 
enhancing 
network 
design. 
The 
characterization is based on our executed experiments. 
The present results have shown, that YouTube traffic has 
a bursty nature when accessing via mobile broadband 
connection. It has been also identified, that media 
optimization has its effect on bursty YouTube traffic: using 
lossy media optimization with just-in-time delivery function 
can visibly decrease the burstiness of the traffic. We have 
verified this via first order properties like SCV, PMR and m3, 
and second order properties like IDI and IDC. 
We have depicted the differences between UNSHAPED 
and SHAPED traffic sources: we have presented parameters 
of initial burst, throttling factor and chunk size for both 
traffic sources based on our experiments. It was also justified 
that SHAPED traffic source has the same amount of bytes in 
the initial burst as UNSHAPED, but is consumes less 
bandwidth, it takes longer for SHAPED traffic to download 
the initial burst. It was highlighted that initial burst size 
parameter is not sent via the HTTP request by the YouTube 
client anymore; based on our experimental result it is not 
limited to 40 s. 
We proposed a generic traffic model for the examined 
traffic sources and we also presented its parameters for 
UNSHAPED and SHAPED YouTube videos. The model is 
given with its formulas and can be easily implemented in 
network simulation tools to evaluate service performance 
and end-user quality.  In future work we plan to extend our 
model with the differentiation between audio and video 
streams.
