Abstract— In the past, Always Best Network Connection 
(ABNC) has been presented to selecting an access network 
based on the characteristics of communication session in 
heterogeneous wireless networks. The novelty of ABNC is to 
consider both source and destination access networks when a 
voice session is being setup. However, it is not suitable for 
multimedia service, which consists of video and data in 
addition to voice. This paper presents an Always Best 
Multimedia Network Connection (ABMNC) model to support 
multimedia services. ABMNC is an integration of a Multiple 
Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problem and a utility-
based Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). We present a 
hybrid Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive 
Weighting (SAW) scheme to solve the problem. Finally, a 
heuristic algorithm was proposed to reduce the complexity of 
access network selection. The simulation results show that the 
presented approach performs better than current approaches.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, various access networks such as General 
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) [1], Long Term Evolution 
(LTE) [2], Microwave Access (WiMAX) [3], and Wireless 
Local Area Networks (WLAN) [3] have been deployed 
widely. Each access network provides different levels of 
Quality of Service (QoS), in terms of bandwidth, mobility, 
coverage area, and cost to the mobile users. Next-generation 
networks (NGN) commonly known as 4G integrate these 
different access technologies and support all IP-based traffic. 
Indeed, 4G users will be able to connect seamlessly to 
various access networks that offer the best possible quality at 
any time and any place.  
Despite all potential advantages of 4G, selection of the 
best network connection remains one of the most important 
concerns and critical issues. Based on user preferences, the 
best access network must be selected to establish connection 
between source handset and corresponding handset. A 
widely accepted approach called Always Best Connected 
(ABC)[4] has been proposed to solve this problem. ABC is 
user-centered which means it makes users always choose the 
best available access networks at any place and any time. 
However, in many situations choosing a good access 
network is not good enough. For example, voice 
communication is charged not only based on source access 
network but also on the chosen corresponding access 
network.  
ABNC [5] extends ABC to let users select the best 
network connection, which consists of the source and the 
destination access network pair when handsets are equipped 
with multiple interfaces. It has been shown that ABNC 
indeed works better to meet user’s requirements. However, 
ABNC is designed for voice sessions and is not suitable for 
multimedia services for the following reasons: Firstly, a 
multimedia session can be established on many paths and has 
more than one media type and thus, we may choose more 
than one path and have to assign each media type to the 
chosen paths, which is not considered in ABNC. Secondly, a 
multimedia session contains media type such as video that 
requires much larger end-to-end bandwidth than a voice 
session. This paper presents a more flexible model called 
Always Best Multimedia Network Connection (ABMNC). 
ABMNC extends ABNC to support multimedia services and 
deals with different multimedia sessions such as video, 
voice, and data. ABMNC constructs multiple end-to-end 
connections between users, and then chooses the best 
configuration that comprises one or more connections with 
respect to multiple media sessions. 
In this study, ABMNC is formulated as a Multiple 
Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problem. The ABMNC 
decision hierarchy chooses a set of network connections 
based on attributes such as cost, quality, security, and power 
consumption. The ABMNC decision hierarchy weights all 
media types in a multimedia service and then assigns a 
media type to a network connection. In order to reduce the 
complexity of MADM and have a reasonable number of 
alternatives, the MADM hierarchy is decomposed into many 
iterated sub-MADM hierarchies. Also, the media assignment 
problem is formulated as a utility-based Multiple Knapsack 
Problem (MKP) and a heuristic approach is presented to 
solve the problem. Simulation results show that our heuristic 
approach can perform well as compared with that of an 
exhaustive searching scheme. 
This paper adds contributions to [6] by introducing a 
heuristic path selection algorithm. Also, simulation was 
performed to study the performance of our presented 
algorithms.   
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
summarizes related work. Section III describes the 
multimedia session selection and formulates the problem.

a hybrid scheme of SAW and AHP. ABMNC performance is 
evaluated in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the 
paper.

 RELATED WORK  
ABC has been extensively studied by a number of 
researchers. The concept and architecture of ABC are 
described in [3]. In [7], the ABC problem is formulated as a 
variation of the Knapsack problem with multiple knapsacks, 
and further proved it to be NP-Hard. Given a set of flows, in 
[8], authors formulate ABC as a variant of bin packing 
problem and present a series of approximation algorithms 
based on First Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm that select a 
network to meet user’s QoS requirements and with maximal 
admitted flows for a user. However, the approach used in [7] 
addresses the problem from a network perspective. What it is 
maximized is the admitted flow, not the user satisfaction. 
Roy et al. [9] intends to achieve ABC over WLAN and 
WiMAX by using a new mechanism to detect QoS support 
of the underlie networks.  
The work in [10, 11] take multiple criteria into 
consideration, however, still leaving some problems. For 
instance, weight elicitation has been ignored; and the rank 
irregularity problem is not addressed. [12] considers both 
user preference and attributes of access networks and 
formulate ABC as a problem of MCDM. In addition, in [13-
15], an access link selection management is proposed to 
incorporate user preference profiles as a part of the selection 
policies.  
Many hybrid approaches have been used in solving ABC. 
Liu [16] proposes a hybrid ANP [17] with RTOPSIS  [18] 
based on several decision making algorithms to select the 
best candidate networks(s) from the user perspective. 
Mohamed et al. [19] presents selection strategy based on 
ANP and TOPSIS while [20] integrates AHP and TOPSIS in 
selecting a network. In [21], four MADM algorithms, 
namely SAW, MEW, TOPSIS and GRA, are simulated to 
show the impact of criterion’s weight on the coefficients. 
They solve the rank irregularity problem and eliminate the 
interdependence between criteria. All previous researches in 
ABC focus on source access network selection, which 
appropriates when a multimode handset is in a standby 
mode. However, when a service session is being set up, ABC 
is no longer efficient as the performance of a service session 
depends not only on the source access network, but also on 
the corresponding destination access network.   
In [5], ABNC is proposed to enable users with 
multimode handsets to select the best network connection for 
a voice session, which consists of source and destination 
access network pair, to satisfy quality constraints and users’ 
preferences. However, when a multimedia session with more 
than one media type is being setup, ABNC cannot meet the 
need. Thus, a more comprehensive model than ABNC is 
required to meeting multimedia session services.

MULTIMEDIA SESSION  
A. Problem Definition  
Given a pair of communicating parties, each is equipped 
withn interfaces. Then there exist 
2
n possible network paths 
or connections between them. Media session contains video, 
voice, and data, and each can take any one of the 
connections. Assume one medium can pass only on one 
connection and more than one medium can share one path 
when the path has sufficient bandwidth. With this 
assumption, we have

 possible transmission 
configurations.  
Given source handset S and corresponding handset C. Let
AiS
and 
C
Aj
denote access networks of source handset and 
access networks of the corresponding handset, respectively. 
Let 
Sij
 denote a connection established from source 
handsets interface i  to corresponding handset’s interface j, 
and be defined as

. For example, 
,
SUMTS WiFi
means the connection is established from UMTS interface of 
source to the WiFi interface of corresponding. Due to the 
nature of multimedia session, ABMNC considers more than 
one connection. Let k be a set of configurations that indicates 
how caller and callee are connected through their access 
networks. Then, the configuration

(

means there are two connections established from UMTS 
and WiFi interface of source to the WiFi interface of 
destination. Characteristics of a multimedia session are 
determined by source and destination access networks. 
Connections can be characterized by cost, power, security 
level, and utility. 
• 
Cost (
C k
): The cost information can be acquired 
from ISP. Charging depends on both source and

The 
cost

be 
accumulated on the number of interfaces used by 
both sides during communication.   
• 
Power (

It depends not only on the type of access networks of 
source handset but also on the number of interfaces 
used during a call. 
• 
Security Level (

UMTS, WiMAX, WiFi in a descending order. Since 
a path consists of a number of access networks, so, 
the access network with minimal security level will

The best configuration 
S*
is selected by comparing 
scores of k , which is the addition of the normalized 
contribution from each criterion multiplied by the weight 
factors. 
*
S  is defined as follows. 
 
S∗ = arg max( w C + w P + wU + wSL), 
 
s. t CB > T& and CS < T , 
 
(1) 
 
where wc, wp, wsl, and wu are weights for criteria cost, power, 
utility, and security level, respectively. CB is the set whose 
elements are adequate when they are bigger than a threshold 
TB
. Bandwidth is an example. Also, CS is the set whose 
elements, such as delay, are adequate when they are smaller 
than a threshold 
S
T . Based on (1), ABMNC is modeled as a 
MADM problem. The goal of the MADM hierarchy is to 
select the most suitable configuration 
for transmission at 
the top level and solution alternatives are located at the 
bottom nodes. More information on mathematical model is 
presented in [6]. 
B. Utility-Based Media Assignment  
In this section, a utility-based measurement scheme is 
presented to evaluate the quality of multimedia services, 
based on which, the media session assignment is formulated 
as a MKP, which is a generalization of the standard knapsack 
problem from a single knapsack to m knapsacks with 
different capacity. The objective is to assign each item to at 
most one of the knapsacks such that none of the capacity 
constraints are violated and the total profit of the items put 
into knapsacks is maximized. 
The design of the utility functions is to strike a balance 
between system utilization and system QoS requirements. 
Let 
U km
be the utility function of a given configuration k
for some medium m, where
{
,
,
}
m
∈ video voice data
 and be 
defined as follows. 
 
U

(2)  
where 
X m
and 
m
b are the allocated and requested B.W. for 
media m, respectively. wm is media weight which is obtained 
from AHP. Because humans are more sensitive to the voice 
(speech) than video, and data is considered to be the least 
important, the weight for video, voice, and data are 
>

.  
In MKP, every path of different bandwidth between the 
caller and callee is considered as a bucket of different size. 
Each medium of different bandwidth requirement is 
considered an object of different size that to be included in 
one of many possible buckets. The objective is to assign 
objects to the available buckets such that we can get the 
maximal utility value while each bucket is not overflowed. 
Thus, given N different paths, the media assignment problem 
of the ABMNC is defined as follows.

object assigned to the ith path, and

bandwidth for path i.  
The first constraint ensures that the total allocated 
bandwidth to each path i will not exceed its limit (knapsack 
weight), and the second one indicates that each medium can 
only be assigned to one path.

has bandwidth larger than the threshold value. 
IV. 
ABMNC 
Selecting the best connection for multimedia session is a 
complicated process due to intensive comparison of a large 
number of alternatives. In this section, we propose a hybrid 
scheme of SAW and AHP in order to reduce the number of 
configurations (alternatives) and hence the computation 
complexity. AHP is used to decide relative importance of 
criteria and media, which is then used by SAW for scoring.  
 When the source handset want to start multimedia 
session it initiates a network discovery procedure to detect 
all available networks and candidate paths
ij
S . These paths 
are input to our heuristic algorithm for path selection. To 
speed up the computation of MADM, we integrated the path 
selection scheme with our hybrid AHP and SAW approach. 
The hybrid AHP and SAW rates the path alternatives by 
considering all criteria, except utility, to produce a partial 
score first. We sort all candidate paths by their partial scores 
in a descending order. Then, we select paths based on their 
contribution on utility value or their bandwidth. After the 
heuristic algorithm selects a configuration, the overall score 
is computed by merging the utility value with media 
assignment. Fig.1 shows the process of multimedia session 
selection.

A. SAW-AHP hybrid scheme   
AHP illustrates the importance of each criterion by 
determining the relative weights of the compared criteria 
where weights are decided according to user’s preferences. 
Since our approach deals with media sessions, AHP weights 
both criteria, 
c
w ,
w p
,
w sl
, and 
u
w , and media which is used 
during media assignment. 
Table I shows how AHP weights each media. Voice row 
shows that voice is twice as important as video, three times 
as important as data, and equal to itself. Video row shows the 
video is twice as important as data. We use Arithmetic Mean 
of the Normalized Column Vectors (AMNCV) and get 
wvideo = 0.297
, 
0.539
wvoice
=
,  and 
w data = 0.164
. By a 
similar process, we can readily obtain weight for 
c
w , 
p

w sl
, and 
u
w  from AHP. AMNCV is defined as follows.

SAW is used to produce the overall score of an 
alternative and is computed as the weighted sum of all the 
attribute values. In our study, we use parameters for different 
access technologies and user preferences to construct a 
decision matrix with respect to cost, power, and security 
level. Then, we normalized the table based on whether the 
criteria is beneficial, e.g., security and utility or non-
beneficial, e.g., cost and power. The best configuration is 
obtained by comparing the weighted average of all 
alternatives from the normalized decision matrix as follows.

criterion of the  QMN alternative. 
B.  Heuristic Algorithm. 
Our heuristic algorithm classifies the sub-MADM 
hierarchies into three modes, single-path, dual-path, and 
triple-path. The first mode takes one path while the second 
takes two paths, and so on. Each mode outputs the best 
configuration as input to next mode if it exists. The next 
mode tries to find a better result by combining the input best 
configuration and one of the remaining Sij. Note that each 
mode re-considers all remaining paths again for a better 
result. If a better configuration cannot be found, the result of 
the previous mode is the result. Also, the connection fails if 
nothing is found in the single-path mode. Table II shows 
notations used in the heuristic algorithm.  
The heuristic algorithm is designed to choose the best 
configuration from a set of ranked paths for media 
transmission. The algorithm considers first the path with a 
larger score without utility value, and then a path with a 
larger bandwidth. It reduces the number of candidate paths 
by deleting a path with a lower bandwidth and ranking 
compared with the others.  
Single-path, dual-path, and triple-path mode are shown in 
Algorithm 1. We specify the rules for the dual-path and the 
triple-path mode with some replacements to simplify the 
pseudo code because they’re based on the same concept of 
the single-path mode. For example, SAW

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
This section evaluates the performance of our proposed 
solution, ABMNC, through simulations. Fig.2 shows our 
simulation environment in which two handsets are willing to 
establish a multimedia session. Each handset is equipped 
with three interfaces. We assume there are nine feasible 
paths Sij which satisfy the minimum bandwidth requirement, 
and S1j, S2j, S3j denote the paths from source handset’s 
interface of UMTS, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi to the jth interface 
of destination, respectively.  
Default simulation parameters used to analyse the 
performance are listed in the Table III. For different access 
technologies, the cost is referred by recent ISP charging 
mechanism, the power consumption, i.e., standby time is 
based on the specifications of some representative 
multimode handsets, and the relative values of security level 
are from some wireless technical reports. We assume 
monthly charged cost, and the cost is counted in both caller 
and callee no matter who initiates the call. Media weights are 
calculated from AHP.

We compare ABMNC results with an exhaustive search 
(EX) method. The EX is a very general problem-solving 
technique that examines all configurations as alternatives. 
EX takes a large amount of time to complete a decision 
making when the number of candidates is large.  In the 
simulation, the user is more interested in quality and cost, 
and cares less about security or power. Thus, based on user’s 
preferences we set wp = 0.05, wsl = 0.05, and wu + wc = 0.9. 
Fig. 3 illustrates the scores of all possible configurations at 
various weights of cost wc and the respective weight of 
utility wu.  
Fig. 4 illustrates the decision making results by ABMNC 
and EX. We observed that the result converges to S33 when 
wc increases because S33 has the smallest cost among all 
alternatives, and the cost dominates the overall scores when 
wc is getting large. Thus, S33 is the best connection for 
general users that want to save money. On the contrary,

are 
recommended for the users who strongly demand quality as 
wu becomes large. One can observe that the overall score 
changes when weights change, which is a desirable feature 
for a scoring system. Note that the chosen configuration is 
not shown in this figure. 
 
Figure 4.  Comparison between ABMNC&EX 
It can be observed from Fig. 4 that results are overlapped 
with one another except in the interval wc = [0.25, 0.35]. 
This is due to the nature of the heuristic path selection 
algorithm. In this interval, ABMNC does not perform as 
well as the EX. EX chooses the dual-path or triple-path 
configurations rather than single-path S21 by ABMNC.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a new approach called ABMNC was 
presented to selecting best network connection for 
multimedia communication. Unlike all previous approaches, 
in ABMNC the problem was formulated as a MADM 
hierarchy with MKP media assignment. The complexity of 
the selection process was tackled by combining our hybrid 
SAW and AHP scheme with our novel heuristic algorithm, 
which all together work on reducing the number of 
alternative paths, and thus simplifying the computation 
complexity. Simulation results show that ABMNC can 
choose network connections that match well with EX most 
of the time.
