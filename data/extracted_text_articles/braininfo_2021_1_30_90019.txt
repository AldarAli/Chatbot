Abstract—Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder
(ADHD)
presents in children and adolescents as a persistent pattern
of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interferes
with their development. Computational studies on ADHD focus
on measures of brain activity of the participants and a few
use standardized cognitive tests or behavioral inventories to
assess objective indicators for diagnosis. The paper presents
a computational proposal in which the combination of two
artiﬁcial intelligence methods is used to aid the identiﬁcation
of diagnostic indicators for ADHD. The proposal is to combine
a neural network of self-organizing maps to group factors from
standardized tests and inventories, and a decision tree to classify
the most relevant factors. The study included 127 children and
adolescents from 6 to 16 years old, 48 with ADHD diagnosis and
79 without ADHD (control group). The most relevant result of the
study was the strong contribution of the scores of the Inventory
of Behaviors for Children and Adolescents in the diagnosis of
the disorder.
Keywords—Self-Organizing Maps (SOM); Decision Tree; Atten-
tion Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
I. INTRODUCTION
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 5th edition - DSM-5 [1] Attention-
Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a persistent pattern
of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes
with functioning or development. The disorder is characterized
by inattention involving, for example, difﬁculty sustaining
attention in tasks or play activities, a state in which the
mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious
distraction, difﬁculty to follow through with instructions and
failing to ﬁnish schoolwork, often forgetful in daily activities,
chores, or duties in the workplace, losing things, expressing
excessive activity or restlessness, and inability to wait one’s
turn, always in ways that are excessive for one’s age or
developmental level. ADHD has its initial expressions in
childhood and usually persists into adulthood, resulting in
impairments in social, academic, and occupational functioning.
The diagnosis of ADHD is clinical, based on the individual’s
history and expression of symptoms. Because this diagnosis
is often based on reports of symptom severity and because
these symptoms are also part of other clinical conditions,
the diagnostic difﬁculty is present in the daily lives of the
interdisciplinary teams responsible for the evaluation process
[2] [3]. Because of the complexity of the diagnostic eval-
uation, the American Association of Pediatrics recommends
the use of an algorithm, both for evaluation and treatment of
children and adolescents with ADHD [4]. To support clinical
decision making, neuropsychological, behavioral, and adaptive
functioning assessment procedures have often been used in
conjunction with neurological assessments [5]. Considering
the social importance involved in properly issuing a correct
diagnosis of ADHD in both children and adolescents, studies
must be proposed that discuss which are the best indicators
of clinical-neurological, neuropsychological, and behavioral-
adaptive diagnostic evaluation when children and adolescents
present with complaints of inattention and hyperactivity. Fur-
thermore, for appropriate assessments and interventions to
be implemented, differential criteria are needed to correctly
characterize and identify attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity among
children and adolescents. Comprehensive assessments in this
regard allow a better understanding of the complexity of
each case for appropriate guidance, design of the therapeutic
intervention, and evaluation of the need for educational and
emotional support for patients and families [5].
Computational studies can help professionals in diagnostic
assessments, especially using machine learning algorithms.

decision tree for screening ADHD by monitoring the school
activities of 153 children using 3-axial actigraph and obtained
results consistent with previous studies. In turn, Lee et al.
[8] analyzed the classiﬁcation of ADHD in children through
brain activity measurements. In their work, they used a neural
network algorithm called self-organizing maps allowing cate-
gorizing characteristics of children with and without clinical
indicators of ADHD.
Unlike previous proposals presented in the literature, this
work aims to combine two artiﬁcial intelligence techniques. In
the ﬁrst step, standardized test results are grouped by means
of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and, in a second step, the
groups with a high level of overlap are analyzed using a
decision tree algorithm, which helps discover which attribute
is discriminative in the diagnosis of children and adolescents
with suspected ADHD.
Besides Section I, that aims to contextualize the work and
present the objective, the work is organized into six parts.
Section II presents the theoretical framework and justiﬁca-
tion of the study. Section III presents the proposed use of
two artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms to aid in the diagnosis.
In Section IV, the procedures for developing the study are
described, including the computational development with the
application of two artiﬁcial intelligence techniques. In Section
V, the contribution of standardized cognitive tests or behavioral
inventories is described, as well as the proposal to solve the
diagnostic doubt within the self-organizing maps and then
the classiﬁcation by the decision tree for understanding the
characteristics of the diagnosis of the disorder. Finally, in
Section VI, we present the conclusion and recommendations
for further studies.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Elements
of
Attention
Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity
Disorder
(ADHD)
ADHD is part of the group of neurodevelopmental disorders
beginning in childhood, but a substantial proportion of children
with ADHD remain relatively impaired into adulthood [9].
From a cognitive-behavioral point of view, it is characterized
by deﬁcits in several cognitive functions, such as attention,
especially selective, sustained, alternating, and divided at-
tention, deﬁcits in inhibitory control, processing speed, or-
ganization, ability to inhibit distracting information, deﬁcits
in cognitive ﬂexibility, hyperactivity behaviors, restlessness,
and impulsivity. ADHD affects 5.29% of the world’s child
population. Of this population, 30% up to 70% maintain
symptoms into adulthood [11] [12]. According to DSM-5 [1],
ADHD can be classiﬁed according to the predominance of
symptomatic axes as predominantly inattentive presentation,
predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, or com-
bined presentation. Behavioral patterns are important in the
diagnosis of ADHD. Here are some descriptions from parents
regarding the children: difﬁculty listening, obeying, following
routine rules, often postponing and forgetting daily activities,
difﬁculty following direct instructions, difﬁculty regulating
feelings of frustration, exacerbation of motor activity, maybe
impulsive in changing activities before they are completed,
having difﬁculty waiting their turn, may have impairments
in social relationships. These behaviors may contribute to
high-stress [13] family or school environments. Given the
importance of collecting various pieces of information in
cognitive neuropsychology and behavior analysis, the treat-
ment and multivariate analysis of the data can help us obtain
relevant information in understanding ADHD complaints, and
the artiﬁcial intelligence techniques used become key elements
in diagnostic discrimination.
B. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
According to Mer´enyi et al. [14], a SOM network provides
clustering and visual representation of data in low dimension.
This technique preserves the topological structure of the data
in a lattice of neurons. The grid can be deﬁned as a rectangular
or hexagonal grid, as in Figure 1, usually two-dimensional,
in an ordered manner such that the most similar neurons
are grouped with neurons that are close in the grid, and the
opposite is true for less similar neurons that are far apart in
the grid, providing a topological view of the data. All neurons
in the grid must undergo exposure to different realizations of
the input dataset to ensure that the self-organization process
matures. The algorithm then proceeds to initially randomly
choose synaptic weights with small values. Once the grid
has been initialized, we have the presence of three essential
processes used to construct the self-organizing map. They were
summarized by Kohonen [15] and Kubat [16] as follows:
Figure 1. Topological Map - Rectangular and Hexagonal Grid
( [17, p.451] )
1) Competition: The synaptic weight vector is calculated
for each j neuron of the grid with the same dimension
as the input dataset through the inner product between
the synaptic weight vector and the input data vector, this
function being the basis for choosing the winning neu-
ron. The maximization of this function has mathematical
equivalence with the minimization of the Euclidean
distance between the synaptic weight and input data
vectors.

X = [x1, x2, ..., xm]T
(1)
X is the input vector of the space m transposed.
Wj = [wj1, wj2, ..., wjm]T, j = 1, 2, ..., l

Wj is the synaptic weight vector of each neuron in the
grid.
i(X) = arg minj
X − Wj
, j = 1, 2, ..., l
(3)
i(X) is the index that summarizes the competitive
process between neurons.
2) Cooperation: The basis for cooperation between neigh-
boring neurons is provided by the winner neuron that
shows the spatial location of the topological neighbor-
hood of neurons neighboring the winner hj,i(X);
hj,i(X) = exp

where dj,i is side distance and σ is the effective width
of the topological neighborhood.
3) Adaptation: Neighboring neurons to the winner increase
their discriminant function values based on the input
dataset and as appropriate adjustments applied to their
synaptic weights improve a subsequent input dataset.
Wj(n+1) = Wj(n)+η(n)hj,i(X)(n)(X−Wj(n)) (5)
where n equals epoch, η(n) is the learning rate, and
hi,j(x)(n) is the neighborhood function.
C. Decision Tree
A decision Trees is an Artiﬁcial Intelligence algorithm
capable of organizing attributes from a dataset in priority,
so that it can generate a path that leads to a decision for a
classiﬁcatory attribute [18] [19].
The entropy (Shannon’s) [20] measures the impurity of the
dataset, being a measure of the heterogeneity of the input
dataset (S) relative to its classiﬁcation (c). The Gain(S,A) is
given by the equation 6 and the entropy of S is given by the
equation 7. Thus, the key factor is the use of a gain function
that allows the attributes (A) to be compared to select the most
relevant one. The attribute chosen is the one that maximizes
the information gain which is calculated as being [20]:
Gain(S, A) = Entropy(S) + Θ
(6)
S is the input dataset, A are the attributes Θ represents the
probability of A multiplied by its entropy.
Entropy(S) =
c
X
k=1
−pilog2pi
(7)
Θ = −
X
v∈V alues(A)
p(Av)Entropy(Av)
(8)
The information gain is given by the equation 6 and
represents the expected reduction in entropy when the value
of the attribute A is known, since the process calculates the
gain for each attribute, choosing the attribute with the highest
gain to be tested in the set S. This process creates the division
of objects to form the decision tree, giving rise to the node,
labeling the attribute, and creating branches for each attribute
value.
III. PROPOSED METHOD
The work presents a proposal for an unsupervised learning
model as a method used in the identiﬁcation of the neurons
of the grid with greater diagnostic doubt of ADHD, that is,
the diagnostic doubt in the neuron shows that it is difﬁcult
for both a machine learning algorithm and an expert to make
a diagnosis. Thus, the paper brings a proposal to apply a
decision tree on the neurons that show overlap to suggest
which attributes are more discriminative. To understand this
overlapping, the entropy (of Shannon) was calculated with
the purpose of measuring the impurity of the neuron with its
dataset, that is, the closer the entropy is to one, the greater the
impurity of the neuron’s dataset. Given this fact, a combination
of SOM with the decision tree algorithm, which is a supervised
model used in data classiﬁcation to help identify one or
more attributes from standardized assessment tools, such as
cognitive tests and behavioral assessment inventories were
sought. These tools were used to test the learning of ADHD
characteristics. The objective of this decision tree algorithm
was to verify the accuracy of the model for the conﬁrmation of
cases with ADHD diagnosis by identifying which assessment
tools best contributed to this ADHD conﬁrmation.
IV. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study sample consisted of 127 children and adolescents
between 6 and 16 years old, 48 with a clinical diagnosis of
ADHD and 79 from the control group, with no diagnosis of
ADHD. The attributes that make up the neuropsychological
tests and behavioral inventories applied in this study are
Attention Cancellation Test (TAC), Trails (TT), Wechsler Intel-
ligence Scale for Children (WISC-III), Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children (WISC-IV), Wechsler Abbreviated Scale
of Intelligence (WASI), Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-
18 (CBCL/6-18) and Teacher’s Report Form for ages 6-18
(TRF/6-18). These attributes were normalized by the z-score
method [21] to standardize the different scales of the attributes.
The normalized data property is used to train the network SOM
using the package available in R language [22]. In this library,
the functions somgrid and som are used to parameterize and
train the map, respectively. For the size of the map topology,

the dimension 4x4 was chosen. With this, the hypothesis of
the study was to ﬁnd neurons with a representative density of
objects and with a signiﬁcant class distribution.
With the trained map, the analyses made were the density
of objects in each neuron, the distance between neurons, the
quality of adjustment of the neurons, the contribution of the
attributes in the formation of neurons, and the distribution
of the label of each object in each neuron. In addition to
the outputs analyzed, the representativeness of the number
of objects contained in each neuron with the label attribute
was sought in the table generated by the SOM. In this way,
the neurons of greater relevance were identiﬁed, that is, with
larger numbers of objects generated by the SOM algorithm.
From this point on, the entropy algorithm (Shannon’s) was
used on each neuron in the network to select the neuron with
the highest class overlap along with the representativeness of
objects that are difﬁcult cases to diagnose.
By identifying neurons with overlapping classes, their ob-
jects are selected from the database generated by the SOM net-
work for training and validation of the decision tree algorithm.
The result of the decision tree brought a hierarchy of attributes
in order of discrimination for cases of diagnostic doubt, and
the validation of the algorithm shows the performance of the
classiﬁcation.
A. Rating Performance Evaluation
Table I shows the confusion matrix that was used to analyze
the classiﬁcation performance of the decision tree. The table
indicates the prediction of the positive and negative scenarios,
as well as current true and false scenarios [23]:
• TN is the correct number of negative predictions;
• FP is the number of false positive predictions;
• FN is the number of false negative predictions;
• TP is the correct number of positive predictions.
Table I. CONFUSION MATRIX
Predicted Negative
Predicted Positive
Current False
TN
FP
Current True
FN
TP
From the confusion matrix, it is possible to measure the
performance of the algorithm by calculating the accuracy, as
follows:
Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)
(9)
Error = (FP + FN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)
(10)
After this stage, it is possible to better understand the
model’s contribution to the understanding of Attention Deﬁcit
Hyperactivity Disorder, as well as to the diagnostic evaluation
of patients. The next section presents the results obtained in
this work.
V. RESULTS
The training result of the SOM network can be seen in two
different visualizations, depicted in ﬁgure 2 and 3. ﬁgure 2
presents the attributes, common to the trials, graphically dis-
tributed in each neuron. The sizes indicate the contribution that
each attribute has to the formation of the neuron. Note that
neighboring neurons have similarities among the attributes. In
ﬁgure 3, the diagnosis, an attribute that is not used in training
the SOM, is projected on the map, allowing visualization of
which neurons have the overlap of class 1 (group diagnosed
with ADHD) and 2 (control group without ADHD). The
network could not separate the diagnosed cases in neuron 4.
Table II presents for each neuron the percentage of objects
of each class. Neuron 4 is the one with the highest concen-
tration of objects (40%) and overlapping classes in the whole
dataset.

Figure 3. Scattering of objects diagnostic within neurons
The result of the decision tree with the data mapped onto
neuron 4 can be seen in Figure 4. The result shows that the
Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18 attribute, speciﬁcally
the probability of attention problems scale (T-score) [24] [25]
neurons had the highest discrimination.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Data from the behavioral assessment inventory presented in
[5] can generally be more susceptible to respondent bias be-
cause it is based on the answers of the subject. This bias is less
so when using cognitive tests which are assessment measures
applied directly to the person. Mathematical understanding and
model generation is likely to become more difﬁcult using only
behavioral inventories. Since ADHD demands the use of both
types of measures, in this study both tools were used to apply
the decision tree. In the study, it was possible to group the
children with and without ADHD by SOM, which made it
possible to understand from the perspective of each grouping
what was most important in their formation.
The self-organizing map contributed especially to the for-
mation of groups and the understanding of clusters with class
overlapping, which is the proposal of this work. In this case of
overlapping to diagnose a disorder, the decision tree was used
to classify the attributes that contributed to the formation of the
ADHD group. With this, the predominance of characteristics
that helped in the understanding of ADHD in children and
adolescents in the study was observed.
The application of the decision tree identiﬁed six attributes,
namely two of cognitive assessment and four of behavioral
assessment, that showed relevant discrimination to make the
diagnosis. The Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18 attribute
the one that showed the highest discriminative power. How-
ever, the incidence of low T-scores on the attention problems
scale and attention deﬁcit scale does not necessarily imply
that the child has ADHD. The results presented showed the
difﬁculty and complexity of ﬁnding indicators that deﬁne
ADHD, as already signaled by some authors [5] [6] [8]
[26] [27]. Importantly, the diagnosis of ADHD is a clinical
diagnosis that considers the measurement of behavioral cor-
relates of attentional deﬁcits and indicators of hyperactivity
and impulsivity in more than one environment. With the
Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18 attribute being a
parent-reported measure, the validity of these two scales for
identifying ADHD will likely be conﬁrmed. However, when
disregarding the scales, one should consider the evaluations
made with the cognitive tests that directly make cognitive
measurements and are essential to decide the diagnosis of
ADHD. In this study, the tests that contributed the most to
this decision tree were the Attention Cancellation Test (ACT)
and the Trail Test (TT).
The study presented as a relevant factor the case of over-
lapping diagnoses of neurons when using the SOM and,
in conjunction with the decision tree, was able to separate
88% of the cases. This way, future works can collaborate
with the technique addressed in the study through supervised
data procedures. These tools can help in making comparisons
between results of standardized tests aiming to reduce possible
biases of behavioral evaluations based on informants’ reports.
Future studies can test the same decision tree on larger
samples to see if the attributes that showed higher accuracy
are maintained. By doing so, the best indices of cognitive
and behavioral assessment instruments that contribute to the
increased accuracy of ADHD diagnosis may be identiﬁed.
Since this study controlled for no comorbidities in the ADHD
group, it is recommended for future studies to use sample
groups with and without ADHD comorbidities from other
psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. This type of
sample may allow the testing of new and more complex
models due to the natural overlap of signs and symptoms
between ADHD and some of these comorbidities.
