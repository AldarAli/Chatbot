I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Multipath fading degrades the system performance and it 
limits the system capacity. Received signal experiences 
fading resulting in signal envelope variation. There are more 
distributions that can be used to describe signal envelope 
variation in fading channels, which are dependent on 
propagation environment and communication scenario. The 
most frequently used statistical models for description of 
signal envelope variation are Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, 
α-µ and k-µ [1] [2].  
Rayleigh distribution can be used to describe small scale 
signal envelope variation in linear non line-of-sight 
multipath fading channels. In linear line-of-sight multipath 
fading environments, signal envelope variation can be 
described with Rician distribution. Rician distribution has 
Rice factor k. The Rice factor k is related to the ratio of 
dominant component’s power and scattering component’s 
power. In multipath fading environments with two or more 
clusters signal envelope variation can be analyzed with 
Nakagami-m distribution. Nakagami-m distribution has 
parameter m. The parameter m is related to the fading 
severity and to the number of clusters in multipath fading 
propagation environment.  
By setting m=1, Nakagami-m distribution reduces to 
Rayleigh distribution. The one sided Gaussian distribution is 
obtained from Nakagami-m distribution for m=0,5. When 
parameter m goes to infinite, Nakagami-m fading reduces to 
no fading case. As parameter m decreases, the fading 
severity increases.  
The α-µ fading can be applied for analyzing small scale 
signal envelope variation in nonlinear multipath fading 
environment [3]. The α-µ fading is general fading model. 
The Rayleigh, Weibull and Nakagami-m distributions can be 
derived from α-µ distribution [4].  
The Weibull distribution can be obtained from the α-µ 
distribution by setting µ = 1. From the Weibull distribution, 
by setting α = 2, the Rayleigh distribution is obtained; (then 
the Rayleigh distribution can be obtained from α-µ 
distribution by setting α=2 and µ=1).  
For α = 2, the α-µ distribution reduces to Nakagami-m 
distribution. 
Now, from the Nakagami-m distribution, by setting µ= 1, 
the Rayleigh distribution is obtained. 
Still from the Nakagami-m distribution, the one-sided 
Gaussian distribution is obtained using as parameter µ = 1/ 2. 
The k-µ distribution can be used to describe small scale 
signal envelope variation in linear line-of-sight multipath 
fading propagation environments [5]. The k-µ distribution 
has two parameters. The parameter k is related to ratio of 
dominant component’s power and scattering component’s 
power. The parameter µ is related to the number of clusters 
in propagation environments. 
The k-µ distribution is also general distribution. From k-µ 
distribution 
the 
Rayleigh, 
Rician 
and 
Nakagami-m 
distributions can be derived as special cases.  
By setting for k=0, k- distribution approximates 
Nakagami-m distribution. For =1, from k- distribution can 
be derived Rician distribution and for =1 and k=0, k- 
distribution reduces to Rayleigh distribution [6]. 
There are several combining techniques which can be 
used to reduce k-µ multipath fading effects on level crossing 
rate of wireless system depend on complexity restriction put 
on communication system and quality of service required 
from communication system [7]. 
The most frequently applied combining techniques are 
maximal ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining 
(EGC) and selection combining (SC). The MRC diversity 
technique provides the best performance and it is the most 
complex for practical implementation [1]. 
In telecommunications, maximal-ratio combining (MRC) 
is a method of diversity combining in which the signals from 
each channel are added together, the gain of each channel is 
made proportional to the root mean square (rms) signal 
level and inversely proportional to the mean square noise

level in that channel. The different proportionality constants 
are used for each channel. It is also known as ratio-squared 
combining and predetection 
combining. 
Actually, 
with 
Maximal-ratio combining, the diversity branches are 
weighted by their respective complex fading gains and 
combined. The MRC is the optimum combiner for 
independent AWGN channels. MRC can restore a signal to 
its original shape [8]. 
The first and second order performance measure can be 
evaluated for wireless communication system. The first order 
performance measures are: the outage probability, the bit 
error probability and the system capacity. The second order 
performance measures are: the average level crossing rate of 
output signal envelope and the average fade duration of 
wireless communication system [9]. The average level 
crossing rate can be calculated as average value of the first 
derivative of received output signal and the average fade 
duration can be obtained as ratio of outage probability and 
average level crossing rate.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 
II, it will be spoken about related works. Section III 
describes the derivation of level crossing rate of MRC output 
signal. Numerical results are presented in Section IV. Section 
V gives last details and concludes the paper.

RELATED WORKS 
There are more works in open technical literature 
considering the second order performance measures of 
wireless communication system operating over multipath 
fading channels. In [10], wireless communication system 
with SIR based dual branches SC receiver operating over 
Rician multipath fading environment in the presence of 
cochannel interference subjected to Rayleigh multipath 
fading is considered. The average level crossing rate and the 
average fade duration are derived for proposed system. The 
average level crossing rate and average fade duration of SC 
receiver operating over multipath fading channel are 
evaluated in [11] and [12] respectively. The performance 
analysis of selection diversity over exponentially correlated 
α- µ fading environment is done in [13].  
In [6], an exact closed-form expression for the phase-
envelope joint distribution of the k-μ fading environment, a 
general fading model that includes the Rice and the 
Nakagami-m models as special cases is derived. The derived 
joint statistics are obtained for both, Rice and Nakagami-m 
cases. 
In paper [14], the ratio of product of two random 
variables and random variable is considered. The product of 
two random variables in the numerator of the ratio can 
represent desired signal envelope subjected to two multipath 
fading. The random variable in denominator of the ratio can 
represent cochannel interference signal envelope affected to 
multipath fading. The results obtained in the paper can be 
used in performance analysis of wireless communication 
system operating over multipath fading channels in the 
presence of cochannel interference which suffer to multipath 
fading. 
The outage performance and symbol error rate analysis 
of L-Branch MRC for k-μ and η-μ fading are given in [15]. 
The first order system performance analysis of L-branch 
MRC for k-μ fading is done by Milišić, Hamza and 
Hadžialić. They made outage performance, outage and 
Symbol Error Probability performance and BEP/SEP and 
outage performance analysis in [16], [17] and [18], 
respectively. 
Analysis of channel capacity per unit bandwidth of L - 
branch MRC receiver operating over k-μ fading channels for 
two adaptive transmission schemes is presented in [19]. 
Using proposed system model, the optimal power, rate 
adaptation and constant transmit power policies are analyzed. 
The expressions for capacity evaluation are derived in the 
terms of finite sums and the effects of diversity order and 
fading parameters on the channel capacity for given 
techniques are considered and numerically presented.  
The closed-form expressions for the level crossing rate 
and average fade duration of k-μ distributed fading signal 
envelope is presented in [20]. The proposed equations are 
validated by reduction to known Rice, Rayleigh and 
Nakagami-m distributions as special cases. They are also 
compared with measured data and shown that provide good 
agreement. 
There are many new studies in the area such as [21].  In 
this report, a dual-hop decode-amplify-forward (DAF) 
transmission system over Nakagami-m fading channel is 
studied. The DAF relay system is a hybrid of decode-and-
forward and amplify-and-forward relay systems that show 
the benefits of both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-
forward relay systems and is also called hybrid relay system 
or hybrid DAF relay system. Signal-to-noise ratios and BERs 
for various system models with varying number of transmit 
and receive antennas have been discussed. 
In this paper, the wireless communication system with 
MRC diversity receiver operating over multipath fading 
channel will be analyzed. The received signal is subjected to 
k-µ multipath fading. MRC diversity receiver is used to 
reduce multipath fading effects to outage probability and 
average level crossing rate of proposed system. The closed 
form expressions for average level crossing rate and average 
fade duration will be derived. The probability density 
function and cumulative distribution function of MRC output 
signal envelope will also be calculated as expressions in 
closed form. To the best author knowledge the average level 
crossing rate of MRC output signal envelope in the presence 
of k-µ multipath fading is not reported in open technical 
literature. The results obtained in this paper can be used in 
designing and analyzing of wireless communication system 
operating over k-µ multipath fading environments.

LEVEL CROSSING RATE OF MRC OUTPUT SIGNAL 
The wireless communication system with MRC receiver 
operating over k-µ multipath fading environments is 
considered. The k-µ multipath fading is presented at the 
inputs of MRC receiver. The MRC is applied to reduce k-µ 
fading effects on system performance. The k-µ multipath 
fading is identical and independent. 
Assuming that thermal noise power is equal among 
branches, the squared MRC receiver signal envelope can be

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In Fig. 1, the level crossing rate of MRC output signal 
versus MRC output signal envelope is presented for different 
values of Rice factor k, the number of clusters in propagation 
environment m, power of MRC output signal and the number 
of inputs of MRC combiner. 
The level crossing rate of MRC output signal increases as 
envelope z increases for lower values of envelope z and the 
level crossing rate decreases as envelope z increases for 
higher values of z. The average level crossing rate decreases 
as MRC output signal envelope power increases. The power 
of MRC output signal z has greater influence on average 
level crossing rate for lower values. The influence of 
parameters on average level crossing rate decreases as signal 
envelope increases.

CONCLUSION 
The wireless communication system with MRC diversity 
receiver operating over multipath fading channel is 
considered in this paper. Received signal is subjected to k-µ 
multipath fading environments. The k-µ distribution can be 
used to describe small scale signal envelope variation in 
linear non line-of-sight multipath fading environment with 
two or more clusters. The MRC diversity receiver is used to 
mitigate k-µ multipath fading effects on system performance. 
The MRC receiver provides the best performance and has the 
highest implementation complexity. The closed form 
expressions for average level crossing rate of MRC receiver 
output signal and average fade duration of proposed system 
are evaluated. The average level crossing rate is calculated as 
the average value of the first derivative of MRC output 
signal and average fade duration is calculated as the ratio of 
outage probability and average level crossing rate.  
The outage probability and the bit error probability are 
the first order performance measures and the average level

crossing rate of output signal envelope and the average fade 
duration are the second order performance measures. 
Numerical results are presented graphically to show the 
influence of k-  multipath fading parameters on level 
crossing rate. The expression for average level crossing rate 
of MRC receiver output signal has four parameters. The 
parameter  is fading severity. The average level crossing 
rate decreases as the parameter  increases. The parameter  
has greater influence on average level crossing rate for lower 
values of parameter . The parameter k is defined as a ratio 
of dominant components power and scattering components 
power. The average level crossing rate decreases as the 
parameter k increases. The influence of parameter k on 
average level crossing rate is bigger for lower values of 
parameter .  
L is the number of branches of MRC receiver. The 
average level crossing rate decreases as parameter L (number 
of branches) increases. The parameter Ω is average squared 
value of signal envelope at the input of the receiver. The 
average fade duration increases as parameter Ω increases.  
The obtained results in this paper can be used for 
analyzing and designing of wireless communication system 
with MRC receiver operating over k-µ multipath fading 
environments.
