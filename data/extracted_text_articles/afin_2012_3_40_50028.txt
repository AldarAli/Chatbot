Abstract—The
relevance
of
machine-to-machine
(M2M)
communications is growing signiﬁcantly, largely driven by
wireless networks. Internet of Things (IoT) applications will
create new demands and challenges that will require high
bandwidth, real-time communications or reliability in remote
locations. Since M2M applications will generate trafﬁc and
transactions that compete for bandwidth and priority, network
operators must be concerned of how to handle the enormous
increases in their signaling trafﬁc and, in particular, in ﬁnding
new ways to meet each M2M application’s requirements and
service level agreements, while protecting the network and
making a more efﬁcient use of the available resources. An
efﬁcient design and control of the future Internet needs to take
into account the main characteristics of the supported trafﬁc
and, therefore, accurate and detailed measurements of M2M
trafﬁc have to be carried out in order to perform a complete
characterization and develop stochastic models that are able to
capture the most important statistical properties of the network
trafﬁc. This paper considers a particular case of a M2M
service, a video surveillance application, and proposes a general
methodology that performs a detailed statistical characterization
of its trafﬁc, while addressing the main challenges that are
involved
in
the
development
of
an
appropriate
stochastic
modeling approach. The M2M trafﬁc analysis relies on the use
of wavelet scalograms, which describe the signal energy on a
timescale/time domain and are constructed based on the wavelet
coefﬁcients obtained from the multi-scale decomposition of the
trafﬁc process, to identify all the different trafﬁc features. An
innovative M2M modeling framework based on a multiple state
machine is also proposed: its parameters should be inferred
from the salient features of the trafﬁc and it should be able
to characterize both the download and upload trafﬁc and
quantify the overhead that is necessary to guarantee a secure
communication.
Keywords - M2M applications, wavelet transform, scalogram,
trafﬁc modeling.
I. INTRODUCTION
Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications have emerged
as a cutting edge technology for next-generation networks,
undergoing a rapid development and inspiring numerous ap-
plications. Recently, this topic has attracted much attention
from the industry and research communities, mainly due to the
following factors: the emergence of wireless communication
systems became a premise for the advance of M2M communi-
cations; (ii) the development of advanced software components
that enable devices to operate intelligently and autonomously;
(iii) sensors that can be used to collect information for M2M
systems are being widely used and increasingly adopted.
According to the Machina Research’s Report ”M2M Global
Forecast & Analysis 2010-20” [1], global M2M connections
will increase from one billion at the end of 2010 to 12 billion
at the end of 2020, accounting for half of all global data
connections. Connections will be dominated by two sectors:
consumer electronics (including cameras, music players and
TVs) and intelligent buildings (e.g. security and surveillance,
HVAC systems), which will account for over 60% of the total.
Over 70% of the M2M devices will be connected by short-
range technologies (mostly WiFi), while of the remainder
wireless cellular technologies (mostly applied to utilities and
automotive applications) will dominate. At the end of 2010,
M2M accounted for 2% of cellular connections and by 2020
they will reach 19%, or 2.3 billion connections.
This trafﬁc growth will have an increasing impact in
network management and dimensioning activities [2]. Mo-
bile network providers are starting to offer M2M integrated
applications, which will require the dimensioning and joint
management of multiple network elements for an optimal
operation. These operations will greatly beneﬁt from the
development of new mathematical tools that are able to predict
network behavior under new M2M trafﬁc scenarios. A rigorous
statistical characterization of the M2M trafﬁc is essential: in
the past, several studies have shown that IP trafﬁc properties
like burstiness, self-similarity and/or long-range dependence
had a signiﬁcant impact on network performance and behavior
and should be included in the modeling frameworks; a similar
analysis should now be applied to these new applications,
whose trafﬁc should be rigorously characterized in order to
design accurate and parsimonious modeling approaches.
The wavelet scalogram, which describes the signal energy
on a timescale/time domain and is constructed based on the
wavelet coefﬁcients obtained from the multi-scale decompo-
sition of the trafﬁc process, will be used as the statistical
ﬁngerprint of each trafﬁc trace segment. The wavelet scalo-
gram communicates the time frequency localization property
of the discrete wavelet transform, being possible to capture
the correlation that exists between the time variability of the
process and the different scales. Wavelet analysis allows the
degree of localization to be automatically and appropriately
adjusted - large window widths are used for analyzing low
frequency components, whereas small window widths are
used for investigating high frequency components. Thus, this
methodology is able to identify different peculiar behaviors

even if this information is somehow hidden when performing
a classical statistical analysis of the trafﬁc. In this paper, M2M
video surveillance trafﬁc will be used to illustrate/evaluate the
suitability of the proposed analysis and modeling framework:
a set of trafﬁc measurements was made in order to obtain long
duration (one week) traces that allow us to identify the main
characteristics and trends of this new communication paradigm
and understand which features/properties should be taken into
account when designing an accurate modeling framework.
The characteristics of M2M trafﬁc are fundamentally in-
dependent from human behavior: in particular, the timings of
the information exchange are no longer deﬁned by humans [3],
although many services may indirectly reﬂect human activities
in some way (like for example M2M video surveillance and
M2M car ﬂeet telemetry services in case of non-authorized
movement/entries or car accidents, whose periodicity tend to
follow exponentially distributed human patterns). So, M2M
trafﬁc can no longer be modeled and predicted by tradi-
tional approaches and a new modeling paradigm should be
developed. The new modeling framework must be a trade-
off between generality and mathematical complexity, must be
sufﬁciently generic to incorporate all possible M2M applica-
tions and heterogeneous characteristics, while maintaining a
low mathematical complexity and high applicability. Privacy
and security will be important features of any M2M service
and therefore the ability to characterize the additional trafﬁc
overhead, to generate and maintain the communication keys,
should also be incorporated in the M2M trafﬁc modeling
framework.
The accurate characterization and modeling of M2M trafﬁc
can be exploited to enhance different trafﬁc engineering and
management tasks. In fact, one way to improve network
utilization is to mix in the same set of network resources trafﬁc
with contrasting behavior (e.g. trafﬁc sources whose periods
of higher utilization are in disjoint time intervals). In general,
it is beneﬁcial for network operators to cluster their trafﬁc
sources into groups of similar trafﬁc proﬁles and to apply
routing policies that are a function of the clustering solution.
So, following a measurement phase, a trafﬁc source can be
classiﬁed into one of predeﬁned groups and its routing can
be adjusted accordingly; this may free some resources, which
in turn, will allow additional sources to access the network.
This functionality can work in pseudo real time and should
be applied in a distributed way, mainly at the network trafﬁc
entry points.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses
the most relevant related work on M2M trafﬁc statistical
characterization and modeling; Section III proposes a new
modeling framework for M2M trafﬁc; Section IV presents
a brief background on wavelet transforms and scalograms;
Section V presents some trafﬁc measurements that were made
for a particular case of a M2M service, a video surveillance
service, in order to illustrate the applicability/suitability of
a statistical analysis methodology that is also proposed to
identify the main statistical properties of the trafﬁc; ﬁnally,
Section VI presents the main conclusions.
II. RELATED WORK
IP trafﬁc modeling has been an active research ﬁeld for a
long time. The growing diversity of services and applications
for IP networks has been driving a strong requirement to
make frequent measurements of packet ﬂows and describe
them through appropriate trafﬁc models. Several studies have
shown that IP trafﬁc may exhibit properties of self-similarity
and/or long-range dependence (LRD) [4], [5], [6], [7], [8],
peculiar behaviors that have a signiﬁcant impact on network
performance. The heavy-tailed characteristic of the probability
distributions (quite different from the simple Gaussian shape)
explained network performances that were quite different from
the ones predicted by traditional renewal and Markovian
models. Besides, the multifractal nature of network trafﬁc,
ﬁrstly noticed by Riedi and L´evy V´ehel [9], lead to the
proposal of random cascades [10], [11] and L-system models
[12] to describe the scaling behavior of IP trafﬁc. However,
the mathematical tractability of Markovian models lead to the
development of several ingenious inference procedures that
were able to account for these peculiar behaviors [13], [14],
[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]: these trafﬁc models were able
to match the complex statistical properties of IP trafﬁc while
maintaining an analytical simplicity that allow their use for
calculating network performance metrics and predicting future
trafﬁc values.
Several reports describing the increase of machine-to-
machine services, their relevance and future trends have been
recently published [1], [2], [21], [22]. However, we did not ﬁnd
any trafﬁc model speciﬁcally designed to describe their statis-
tical characteristics: reference [23] is one of the few publicly
available studies on this topic, proposing a theoretical model
to calculate some characteristics of WPAN (Wireless Personal
Area Networks) trafﬁc, although the model still needs some
modiﬁcations to account for application speciﬁc behaviors.
So, it is absolutely necessary to conduct a rigorous statistical
analysis of real M2M trafﬁc applications and develop a generic
analytical framework that is able to describe their relevant
properties and predict future trafﬁc values.
III. M2M TRAFFIC MODELING FRAMEWORK
The most efﬁcient traditional trafﬁc models usually include
multiple space states where the transition dynamics are prob-
abilistic and based on underlying exponentially distributed
timings. These dynamics are frequently mapped into Markov
chains that modulate the data generation process (deterministic
or exponentially distributed). Examples of these processes are
the Markov Modulated Deterministic Process (MMPP)[24]
and the Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP)[17],
which assume that the time spent in each state of the space
state is exponentially distributed and information objects are
generated in periodic and exponentially distributed intervals,
respectively.
An efﬁcient M2M trafﬁc model must jointly incorporate tra-
ditional deterministic characteristics of automated mechanisms
and random characteristics of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, network
and human processes. Therefore, we propose a modeling
66

framework based on a process ruled by a multiple space
state with heterogeneous (deterministic and random) dynamics
and generic information (e.g. messages, packets or bytes)
generation processes. This framework model will be called
Heterogeneous Chain Modulated Generic Process (HCMGP).
The HCMGP modeling framework is a multistage space
state process able to model the security bi-directional trafﬁc
overhead, the M2M bi-directional communication process and
admits the deﬁnition of multiple possible events that reﬂect
different application proﬁles. As a result, each state will deﬁne
the type of generation process (deterministic, exponential or
other) and its corresponding parametrization. Moreover, the
dynamics of the state transitions are heterogeneous and can
be ruled by deterministic or exponential processes that deﬁne
the time of permanence in each state and the destiny of the
next transition.
The modeling framework parametrization will agree with
the assumption that state transitions can follow a deterministic
or random distribution. State transitions are ruled in parallel
by two (or more) parametric matrices that deﬁne, respectively,
the next transitions after a deterministic amount of time and
the probabilistic transitions after a random period of time.
The probabilistic/random transitions can follow an exponential
distribution (analogous to Markovian models) or any other
distribution. The information generation processes associated
with each state will also be parametrized by two (or more)
vectors deﬁning, respectively, the deterministic values and
distribution function parameters for the rates and the amount
of generated information.
The chain modulated nature of the HCMGP modeling
framework will allow the usage of the traditional mathematical
tools (used on Markovian models) to determine the trafﬁc
model resulting from the superposition of multiple M2M
sources. Existing mathematical tools allow the computation
[17] and reduction [25] of the matrix form descriptors of the
superposition model.
The M2M model framework is depicted in Figure 1. The
underlying space state of the model comprises two base states:
standby and active. The standby state models the terminal
conditional upon boot, and may include speciﬁc bi-directional
start-up transmissions (e.g. conﬁguration, localization or log-
ging messages). The active state models the non-event related
operation of the terminal (e.g. localization, logging or periodic
metering). The remaining states will model event driven ac-
tions of the terminal (e.g. failure report, security event report,
non-scheduled metering/logging, upgrades or (re)conﬁguration
actions). Two (optional) extra states were included to model
the security channel establishment and maintenance (key es-
tablishment and renegotiation). The security keys establish-
ment actions are perform upon boot (between the standby and
active states) and keys (re)negotiation actions are treated as any
other event and can be periodically or protocol based deployed.
IV. BACKGROUND ON WAVELET SCALOGRAMS
The inability of conventional Fourier analysis to preserve
the time dependence and describe the evolutionary spectral
Figure 1: M2M trafﬁc model framework
characteristics of non-stationary processes requires tools that
allow time and frequency localization. Wavelet transforms
can provide information concerning both time and frequency,
which allows local, transient or intermittent components to
be elucidated. Such components are often obscured due to
the averaging inherent within spectral only methods, like Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) for example.
Wavelets are mathematical functions that are used to divide
a given signal into its different frequency components. They
consist of a short duration wave that has limited energy.
Wavelets enable the analysis of each one of the signal compo-
nents in an appropriate scale. Starting with a mother wavelet
ψ(t), a family ψτ,s(t) of ”wavelet daughters” can be obtained
by simply scaling and translating ψ(t):
ψτ,s(t) =
1
p
|s|
ψ(t − τ
s
)
(1)
where s is a scaling or dilation factor that controls the width
of the wavelet (the factor
1
√
|s| being introduced to guarantee
preservation of the energy, ∥ψτ,s∥ = |ψ|) and τ is a translation
parameter controlling the location of the wavelet. Scaling a
wavelet simply means stretching it (if |s| > 1) or compressing
it (if |s| < 1), while translating it simply means shifting its
position in time.
Given a time-series x(t) ∈ L2(ℜ) (the set of square inte-
grable functions), its Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
with respect to the wavelet ψ is a function of two variables,
Wx;ψ(τ, s), obtained by projecting x(t) onto the family {ψτ,s}
[26]:

In analogy with the terminology used in the Fourier case, the

energy ( ˆEx(τ, s)), for all possible translations (sub-set S) and

The existence of a peak in the scalogram of a time series
at a high (low) level indicates that a high (low) frequency
component is present in the time series. The volume bounded
by the surface of the scalogram is the mean square value of
the signal.
Scalograms reveal much information about the nature of
non-stationary processes that was previously hidden, so they
are applied to a lot of different scientiﬁc areas: diagnosis
of special events in structural behavior during earthquake
excitation, ground motion analysis, transient building response
to wind storms, analysis of bridge response due to vortex
shedding, among others [27].
V. USE CASE - A VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SERVICE
M2M video surveillance services in public areas, buildings
and transportation facilities will be very common in a near
future. M2M devices will provide security by means of stan-
dard movement alarms or video surveillance cameras. Some
applications transmit video continuously, while others only
transmit video upon movement detection (triggered by external
alarms or image analysis).
When we try to apply the general M2M modeling frame-
work to the video surveillance service, different proﬁles can be
identiﬁed, differing only in the amount and rate of information
generated when in the active state. In this state, the M2M
terminal will periodically transmit video and alarm data with a
deterministic rate and size. A generic system can be modeled
by a framework with two event states, one that models the
alarm reporting and other that models the start/rate change
of video streaming upon movement detection. Both event
states, which depend on human actions, will occur according
to exponential distributions, while their duration will also be
exponentially distributed. However, the information generation
rate will be deterministic (constant report size and average
video rate).
A. Measurement setup
In order to fully characterize the trafﬁc generated by this M2M
service, we made an intensive set of trafﬁc measurements at
our networks laboratory. The experimental measurement setup
is depicted in Figure 2, where two computers, a webcam and
a layer 2 switch were used. Computer 1, which is responsible
for creating the data stream, is a micro ITX system with
an Intel Dual Core N330 processor with 1.6 GHz, a 2 GB
DDR 2 memory and 120 GB of disk capacity. A generic USB
2.0 webcam, with a 640x480 pixel resolution, is attached to
computer 1. Computer 2 is a common workstation built with
an Intel Core 2 Duo, model E 8500, operating at 3.16 GHz,
4 GB of DDR 2 RAM and 320 GB of disk capacity. Both
machines operate using a Linux Ubuntu distribution, version

is a common 10/100Mbps Ethernet switch.
The ’gst-launch’ software was used to compose a continu-
ous MPEG2 video stream, running over UDP, with a resolution
of 640x480 pixel and 30 frames per second.
B. Trafﬁc characterization
Figures 3 and 4 represent the number of bytes and packets,
respectively, received by Computer 2 during a whole week
period. As can be seen, there is a clear periodic trend in these
plots, corresponding to the repetitive daily activities of the
laboratory users. The ﬁrst peak of these plots corresponds to
Saturday, and we can see that the activity levels on Saturday
and Sunday are slightly different from the levels of the
remaining week days. On weekend days the movement activity
is very small, so the variability of the curves is also smaller:
on Saturday the laboratory is open, although with a small
number of users; on Sunday, it is closed, explaining the drop
of the curves in the late afternoon. In fact, on Sunday the
activity level corresponds exclusively to sunlight variations
(artiﬁcial lights are obviously turned off). On working days,
the activity level presents some degree of variability (due to
the presence of several users in the lab premises) and drops
abruptly at 12:00 PM because the lab closes at this instant
and lights are turned off. Finally, note that, for all days, there
is a marked peak in the early morning, corresponding to the
sunlight appearance.
A scalogram analysis was applied to the measured data-
streams, inferring the normalized energy ( ˆEx(τ, s)) in all time
slots τ and for time-scales 1 to 64 (s ∈ S, S = {1, . . . , 64}).
The top plots of Figures 5 and 6 represent, respectively, the

trafﬁc amount and the number of packets per minute corre-
sponding to a single day (since their patterns are repetitive),
while the bottom plots illustrate the corresponding scalograms,
in terms of normalized energy over time and timescale (darker
means more energy). The scalograms allow us to identify
and quantify the most relevant trafﬁc variations, knowing
exactly the time instants and resolutions where they are more
noticeable. If a more detailed analysis of any segment of
the data trace is necessary, it is possible to calculate a new
scalogram that is conﬁned to a small portion of the signal. As
an illustrative example, the top plots of Figures 7 and 8 repre-
sent the trafﬁc amount and the number of packets per minute
corresponding to a generic dawn period, respectively, while the
bottom plots illustrate their corresponding scalograms. This
type of detail can be used to identify important frequencies
that are characteristic of some particular behaviors of a M2M
service. This analysis step will have obvious consequences in
the modeling phase of the M2M service: the knowledge of
the different energy components and of the timescales where
they are visible is an important input to the modeling effort,
allowing the identiﬁcation of the different model states and
contributing to the inference of the various model parameters.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper discussed the new paradigm that M2M trafﬁc
carries for network operators. In face of several new challenges
that are imposed by M2M services, namely the periodicity
of the trafﬁc proﬁles and the partial/total absence of human
inﬂuence, a new modeling framework able to conform with
the major current and future M2M applications was presented.
This approach is based on a multiple state machine and
can be a valuable tool for dimensioning, optimizing and
maintaining M2M services over future networks. In order to
perform a complete characterization of the M2M trafﬁc, this
paper considered a particular case of a M2M service, a video
surveillance application, and proposed a general methodology
that is able to perform a detailed statistical characterization
of the generated trafﬁc: the trafﬁc analysis framework relies
